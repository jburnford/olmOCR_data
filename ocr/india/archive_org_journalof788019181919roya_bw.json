Corresponding Members may, on the recommendation of two Members of the Council, be elected by a majority of the Council, in recognition of services rendered to any Scientific institution in British Malaya, or to Science generally in British Malaya. They shall pay no subscription: they shall enjoy the privileges of members except a vote at meetings, eligibility for office and free receipt of the Society\u2019s publications.\n\nWith a corresponding change in Rule 10 b, by the addition of the words \u201cand corresponding\u201d after the words \u201cto elect Ordinary.\u201d\n\nThe hon. sec. explained the object of the alteration.\n\nMr. Boden-Kloss criticised it and suggested that it was not needed.\n\nThe alterations were adopted by thirteen votes to four.\n\nThe Chairman for the Council proposed that Mr. C. O. Blagden, Reader at the School of Oriental Studies, be elected an honorary member of the Society.\n\nMr. Boden-Kloss considered that honorary membership should be confined as a rule to those who had done active work for the Society in Singapore.\n\nIt was pointed out that Mr. Blagden had been Secretary to the Society, and that he had largely contributed to the Journal.\n\nMr. Blagden was unanimously elected a Honorary Member.\n\nA vote of thanks to the Auditor, Mr. See Tiong Wah was carried.\n\nA vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Makepeace for his address.\n\nA vote of thanks to the Chairman concluded the meeting.\nAnnual Report of the\nStraits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1917.\n\nThe active membership of the Society is estimated at 290.\n\nThe death in action of four further members has been ascertained since the last report was written\u2014namely, Lieut.-Colonel V. A. Flower, Captain H. Millard, Mr. M. Thunder and Mr. R. B. Williams. Of Honorary Members, the loss of His Highness the late Rajah of Sarawak is regretted, and of members of the Hon. Tan Jiak Kim, C.M.G., Mr. J. C. Hermansen and Mr. G. C. Morant.\n\nThe Council has elected the following New Members:\n\nDr. J. W. Adams. Mr. E. P. Jones.\nMr. R. H. Adams. Mr. V. V. Lemberger.\nMr. P. T. Allen. Rev. J. S. Nagle.\nMr. G. P. Bradney. Mr. R. Pears.\nMr. C. F. W. Clifford. Mr. D. Y. Perkins.\nMr. R. Crichton. Dr. M. Rattray.\nMr. G. E. S. Cubitt. H. E. Maj.-Genl. D.

Yates.\n\nThe personnel of the Council was changed during the year only by the resignation of Professor J. Argyll Campbell.\n\nThe Journal was published thrice\u2014in April, August and December: and the year\u2019s volume, so made up, is of normal size. Its cost was about $1,250, the bill of the last part not entering into the years\u2019 accounts.\n\nIn the report for the year 1915 it was mentioned that the Council had undertaken to publish the Reports on the Robinson-Kloss expedition to Korinchi Peak, Sumatra, as additional to the Journal. In the end, however, partly owing to the increased cost of paper, the Council has to content itself with handing to the authors the illustrations already prepared for the work, together with the balance of the \u00a3100 which had been granted by the Council.\nThe appeal in the last report for short papers for the Journal had an excellent effect, and the Journal contains 30 articles, which is many more than usual: four are on Malay history, seven on the language and literature, five on customs, one on art, one on ethnography, one on zoology, ten on botany, and one on the physiological difference in digestive power between Europeans, Chinese, Malays and Natives of India.\n\nMr. E. D. Merrill made to the Society an offer of his valuable Index to the Bornean Flora: but the Council feeling that other matter in sight for the Journal had a prior claim transmitted it with the author's consent to His Highness the Raja of Sarawak who will cause the index to be printed in the Sarawak Museum Journal.\n\nFor the purpose of illustrating an early Journal, photographs of the tombstones of Sultan Mansur have been procured from Malacca.\n\nSome of the Malay texts published by the Society are being used in the higher schools of the Peninsula; and the Council felt justified in reducing the price at which they are sold.\n\nThe Library has received the usual exchanges.\n\nThe Hon. Treasurer's balance sheet shows $4,700 invested, including $2,200 in the Straits Settlements War Loan, and $845.62 in current account.\n\nI. Henry Burkill,\nHon.

Mr. Burkill the Secretary has compiled an index which was of great assistance; (2) the Index to Journals 1-50, compiled nine years ago by the late Mr. W. D. Barnes. A work awaiting some member is the index of the following numbers, which should follow the same plan, and if not published at once, should be ready for publication when No. 100 is issued; (3) The papers themselves as a criterion of the subjects dealt with and as assessing the zeal of the members in carrying out what is perhaps the most important function of the Society, namely the record of investigations of subjects connected with the Straits of Malacca and the neighbouring countries. By diligent study of the Journals issued new members are put in touch with what has already been done, have suggested to them lines of study and investigation, are saved much original research, become imbued with the spirit of the best of the past members, and will also, I am convinced, be filled with admiration at the industry of those who laid the foundations of the Society. The indices of the various numbers issued since No. 50 are useful for the same end as Mr. Barnes's index, with which they should be read.\n\nThe original Asiatic Society of Bengal was founded by Sir William Jones (1746-1794) a Puisne Judge, and the date of its foundation was Jan. 15th, 1784. The Centenary of the \"Asiatick Society\" was celebrated by the publication of a Centenary Review, a bulky volume Part I dealing with the History of the Society, Part II with Archaeology, History, Literature, etc., Part III with Natural Science. As the original society the A. S. of B. is our parent, I may quote these words from the founder's letter: \"in the fluctuating imperfect and limited erudition of life such enquiries and improvements could only be made by the united efforts of many, who are not easily brought, without some pressing inducement or strong impulse, to converge into a common point.\"\nThe association of this Society with the A. S. of B. has been of a cordial nature. Dr. Wallich, who was in Singapore in 1822, had presented some botanical works to the Society. The earlier journals contain the following papers by men connected in early years with the Straits.\n\nRaffles, Thomas\u2014On the Malayan Nation (As. Res. XII, 102).\n\nFarquhar, Major (died 1839)\u2014An account of a new species of Tapir in the Malay Peninsula (As. Res. XIII, 417).\n\nLogan, J. R.\u2014Two papers on the Geology of Singapore (J. XVI, 667; J. XVI, 519).\n\nLow, Col. J. (see references in Buckley\u2019s Anecdotal History)\u2014The Geological Appearances and General Features of the Malay Peninsula, etc. (As. Res. XVIII, pt. 1, 128)\u2014An account of several inscriptions found in Province Wellesley (J. XVII, pt. 2, 62)\u2014An inscription from Kedah (J. XVIII, 247).\n\nMarsden, W.\u2014Traces of Hindu Literature and Language among the Malays (As. Res. IV, 221).\n\nNewbold, Capt. J. W. T.\u2014Eleven papers on Malayan Geography, J. II, 497; III, 601; IV, 241, 297, 537; V, 61, 257, 505, 561, 626, 670.\n\nOur Members are entitled to attend the meetings of the A. S. of B. when in Calcutta, which right is reciprocated.\n\nThe Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in London was founded in 1823, by Thomas Henry Colebrooke, who was president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1806-16. The record of our own connection with the R. A. S. (London) is contained in our minutes, 1902. Mr. Ridley interviewed Dr. Rhys Davids, the Secretary, who expressed a desire for closer union with us, wished to exchange papers, and said that members of affiliated Societies could attend the meetings of the London Society and \u2018in other ways the parent Society would be willing to assist the Straits Branch.\u2019 Closer union was urged again in 1910. In 1912 our Society resolved that members of the R. A. S. of London be accorded the privileges of membership without election.\n\nThe Bombay Asiatic Society was founded in 1827, the Ceylon in 1845, the China Branch in 1858 and the Japan Branch in 1872. With all these we are in cordial correspondence and it might be well if members visiting the head-quarters of these Societies were to attempt to get into personal touch with them. The Empire of Knowledge knows no geographical boundaries.\n\nThe Straits Branch.\n\nTurning to the history of the past forty years of our Society, the initial meeting was held on Nov. 4th, 1877, when it was resolved \u201cthat the gentlemen present form themselves into a Society\nfor collecting and recording scientific information in the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago.\u201d Possibly the meeting had not considered the \u201cliterary\u201d branch of the Society, although with Mr. Hose, then Archdeacon, Mr. D. F. A. Hervey, Mr. W. E. Maxwell, and Mr. W. A. Pickering, the thought of this important branch of work must have been present in their minds.\n\nThe provisional committee met again on Jan. 21st 1878, and the draft rules having been agreed to, the first election of officers took place, and an Editorial Committee was chosen.\n\nThe Inaugural Address was delivered at the meeting of Feb. 28th 1878, at which meeting 35 members were elected. Also Mr. Miklucho-Maclay, a Russian traveller who had extensively explored the Malay Peninsula and the Coasts of New Guinea, was elected an Honorary Member of the Society. And Mr. Skinner exhibited a sketch map of the Peninsula, which was to occupy so much of the Society\u2019s energy in coming years.\n\nArchdeacon Hose\u2019s inaugural address can be read in No. 1 of the Journal. Like all the addresses of the founder of the Society, it was markedly scholarly, and I would fain quote it at length, but time forbids. These points are striking: the praise he had for Mr. J. R. Logan, who for fifteen years edited \u2018The Journal of the Indian Archipelago\u2019 in Penang and was a first Vice President in Penang; the hope he expressed that the resident families of the Straits, the Baumgartens, the Neubronners, the Westerhouts would continue to add to the common knowledge; the stress he laid on the value of association in stimulating the accumulation and record of facts; his plans for the journal a six-monthly issue to begin with, as a chief instrument in the work of the Society; co-operation with the Raffles Library, which is to this day a valuable feature in the Society\u2019s work; the need for study of the developments of Islam among the races of this part of the world\u2014the Society has not done too much in this respect; the field there is in the Malay language for study, in which he himself excelled; the development of the Native States then first associated with the Colony by the inauguration of the Residential System by Sir Andrew Clarke; the geography of the Peninsula, about which little was known; the map with immense spaces entirely blank, which map was to play so important a part in the work of the Society.\n\nThe inaugural address was a great and useful stimulant and should be read by young members keen on co-operating in the plans there sketched out.\n\nBesides the inaugural address on Feb. 28th, 1878, Mr. A. M. Skinner, whose work in the Society was mainly geographical, introduced \u201cThe Map\u201d which has been so useful to the public, so profitable to the Society, absorbing so much of its time. A paper which recalls the local controversy of a few years ago \u201cBreeding Pearls of Borneo\u201d was read by Dr. Dennys.\nThe Society met monthly. The earliest papers were \"Chinese in Singapore,\" Mr. J. D. Vaughan; Malay Proverbs, Sir W. E. (then Mr.) Maxwell; \"Notes on Gutta and Caoutchouc in the Malay Peninsula\"\u2014with no foreknowledge however of the Hevea brasiliensis; and a notice was issued as to the method of collecting vocabularies for comparison.\n\nBy May 6th, communication has been established with the Royal Asiatic Society of London, agreeing to exchange publications. The present full name of the Society was adopted. Languages were fairly recognised and a paper from the first honorary member, Mr. M. Maclay was entitled \"The dialects of the Melanesian tribes in the Malay Peninsula.\" Three papers were read and four native gentlemen elected.\n\nThe first rules of the Society state that the objects of the Society shall be \"The Investigation of Subjects connected with the Straits of Malacca and the neighbouring Countries; (b) publication of papers in a journal; (c) formation of a library of books.\n\nRule 25 provides that \"occasional popular lectures upon Literary or Scientific subjects may be delivered, under the sanction of the Council on evenings other than those appointed for General Meetings of the Society.\" This rule has never been put into operation, to the detriment of the educative value of the Society, I venture to think. A few years ago the Council declined to have an important public lecture on Malarial Mosquitoes by a Medical expert, delivered under its auspices; and still more recently on a proposal for popular lectures 1913-14, it was thought that they \"cannot be arranged with success.\" The idea seemed to be that if lectures were popular, they could not be exact enough to satisfy the literary and scientific instincts of the Council, after a reply to a member \"that the subject had not been lost sight of.\"\n\nThe Society was now in full swing. The first year's work was prodigious, and if similar energy has not been always shown during the 40 years of the Society there has never been a cessation of work, as a glance at the contents of the 71 numbers of the Journal, and especially No. 51\u2014the index of the first fifty numbers\u2014will show. A note should be kept of the completion of No. 100, in order that a second (or preferably complete index) may then be issued. Mr. Barnes, who compiled the index, made no attempt to compile a subject index but placed them under appropriate headings. These naturally fall into two classes, Physical and Literary, the former embracing natural history, philosophy, medicine, improvements of the Arts, and whatever is comprehended in the general term of physics. Subjects under the second head would be literature, philology, history, antiquities and ethnology\u2014to which may be added recording knowledge for the use of future generations.\n\nVery much has been done by members of the Society on the literary side. The Malay language and literature, such as it is, has been studied and recorded; Malay Customs and Amusements,\nlegends and traditions, and to some extent religion and superstition have been made the subject of papers. In bulk, this side of the Society's work looks well, but in the matter of religion there seems to have been a want of complete and accurate observation. As the first President observed \"Nearly all Malays are Mohammedans and people seem to consider that when they have said that, they have said all that need be said on the subject.\" National policy not to interfere with the religion of the people in our Colonies; and the natural (or assumed) diffidence of the British to speak about religion and belief are no doubt responsible for what looks like a lost opportunity. \"A man's religion is the chief fact with regard to him; a man's or a nation of men's.\" The main literary publications include four Hikayat, beginning with that of the famous Abdullah; four volumes of Miscellaneous papers relating to Indo-China, reprinted for the Society; a good many miscellaneous vocabularies; lists of place-names; disease-names; plant-names; Malay fairy tales, etc. Sir W. E. Maxwell's work in this respect stands easily first, and there are indications of fields yet to be worked and willing workers, but on the whole I diffidently suggest that the Literary side of the Society's work as judged by publications under its auspices has not come up to expectation. The author is a jealous father, disinclined to share with any one or any Society the honours of paternity.\n\nOn the physical side, the Society has had the inestimable benefit of the Government Specialists attached to the Forests and Museums as very active members. Mr. Ridley quite recently gave an address on the progress made by members of the Society in the different branches of physical research, and this address should be read as part of any record of forty years of the Society.\n\nLet us now praise famous men. Forty years of a Society existing under circumstances such as ours is the equivalent of four generations. I think the oldest member of the Society now in Singapore is Mr. Seah Liang Seah, elected in 1888. Dr. Shellabear came in in 1894 and we may hope that he will be able to return to the Colony. The activities of Mr. C. J. Saunders began in 1896, so that your Chairman has passed his majority, and but for the fact that he is present I would speak of his constant interest in the Society and regular attendance at the Council meetings as an exemplar.\n\nThe father of the Society is indubitably Bishop Hose, whose portrait hangs in this room, and whose memory is ever-green. It was to him that the Society owed its inception and much of its vigour for the thirty years during which he occupied the office of President, almost without a break, till the actual day of his retirement in 1908, after forty years service in the Straits.\n\nIn 1890 two well-known members of the Society were elected, Messrs. H. N. Ridley, Mr. C. O. Blagden; the late Mr. Arthur Knight joined in 1888. He brought to the Council that long and\nuseful service at once a source of inspiration and of help in carrying on what may be called the machinery of the Society. Mr. Ridley came at a very critical time, in 1890. He took up the Honorary Secretaryship in the same year and if Bishop Hose was the mainspring of the Society, Mr. Ridley was certainly the escapement, and with his colleague Dr. Hanitsch, still our honorary treasurer, has kept us going to this day. Many useful contributions to the Journal have come in from Scientists of \"the neighbouring countries\"\u2014Sarawak, especially, but of late years the multiplication of departmental journals, while no doubt gratifying to the editors and writers, has diffused energy and made much useful knowledge less accessible than it would be if published in a Journal with editions of 500, to which the Journal of the R. A. S. (Straits Branch) has now attained. If all the writings of all the savants were concentrated, the issue of our Journal could be made regular, of fair dimensions, and of more general interest. With the passing of the Map, the Journal becomes increasingly important to the Society, and more and more valuable as a record.\n\nThis subject of \"record\" brings me to a matter which was last under consideration in 1914\u2014the forming of a collection of photographic records. Nothing has yet been done in this respect. Many of our members must have prints and negatives of interest in our brief-lived community. The questions of permanency of interest and of the record are not easily solved\u2014but to my mind a useful field lies open to the Society, and a small Photographic Records committee of members skilled in the \"dark\" art could probably devise a means of making the Society's Library a valuable and permanent record of the times and useful to the generations that come after us.\n\nTime does not permit me to deal with any history of the financial or other machinery of the Society. And my own conviction is that no good organisation in the Straits languishes for lack of funds as long as its members are keen. We have had \"downs\"\u2014as when Mr. Ridley took charge, and \"ups\" as when Dr. Galloway secured a large number of new members some few years ago. Our chief income, now that the Map has passed into other hands, professional hands, must be Members Subscriptions, and a careful eye must be kept on the list, so that losses by retirement on departure from the Colony may be made good by new additions. The life of the Society depends, however, upon the spirit which animates its members. The practice of permitting new members to purchase back copies of the Journal at a very small price would not only convert locked-up capital into liquid assets, but would stimulate the interest of new comers, inform them somewhat of what has been done in the past, indicate directions in which their work for the Society might lie, and secure members to carry on the ideals of the founders and early members of the Society, which may be lost sight of with a comfortable bank balance and an efficient working machine. The Society, I conceive it, will be judged not by the machinery, but by the results. One wants to concentrate all scien-\ntific and literary study, and if the medical, scientific planting and mining, industrial, literary and philosophic interests of Malaya could be concentrated in the Society, a decade would be sufficient to make its foundations more secure than ever. Its functions may be summed up: to investigate, to record,\u2014and record is a useful step to further investigation\u2014to collect knowledge, not only among its members but from all earnest inquirers and workers.\nList of Members for 1918.\n\n*Life Members. \u2020Honorary Members.\n\nPatron His Excellency Sir Arthur Young, G.C.M.G., Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner for the Malay States.\n\nDate of election.\n18 Jan., 1903.

The Royal Asiatic Society has its headquarters at 22 Albemarle Street, London W., where it has a large library of books, and MSS. relating to oriental subjects, and holds monthly meetings from November to June (inclusive) at which papers on such subjects are read.\n\n2. By rule 105 of this Society all the Members of Branch Societies are entitled when on furlough or otherwise temporarily resident within Great Britain, and Ireland, to the use of the Library as Non-Resident Members and to attend the ordinary monthly meetings of this Society. This Society accordingly invites Members of Branch Societies temporarily resident in Great Britain or Ireland to avail themselves of these facilities and to make their home addresses known to the Secretary so that notice of the meetings may be sent to them.\n\n3. Under rule 84, the Council of the Society is able to accept contributions to its Journal from Members of Branch Societies and other persons interested in Oriental Research, of original articles, short notes, etc., on matters connected with the languages, archaeology, history, beliefs and customs of any part of Asia.\n\n4. By virtue of the afore-mentioned Rule 105 all Members of Branch Societies are entitled to apply for election to the Society without the formality of nomination. They should apply in writing to the Secretary, stating their names and addresses, and mentioning the Branch Society to which they belong. Election is by the Society upon the recommendation of the Council.\n\n5. The subscription for Non-Resident Members of the Society is 30/- per annum. They receive the quarterly journal post free.\n\nAsiatic Society of Bengal. Members of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, by a letter received in 1903, are according to the privilege of admission to the monthly meetings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, which are held usually at the Society's house, 1 Park Street, Calcutta.\nJelebu Customary Songs and Sayings.\n\nCollected by A. Caldecott,\nwith preface and notes by R. O. Winstedt.\n\nThese t\u00e9romba 'Songs of Origin,' and these 'Customary Sayings' p\u00e9bilangan adat, as they are called in Negri Sembilan or p\u00e9patah to use their Minangkabau name, were collected by Mr. Caldecott in Jelebu, of which State he has written an adequate history (Papers on Malay Subjects; second series, No. 1: F. M. S. Govt. Press, Kuala Lumpur, 1912).\n\nA great deal of material has been printed on the Minangkabau Malays of Negri Sembilan\u2014Martin Lister's careful articles, Mr. Humphreys' Naning Proverbs and excellent Wedding Speech from Naning, papers by O'Brien and Hervey and Bland, and Messrs. Parr and Mackray's exhaustive \"Rembau\" have all been published in past Journals. Mr. Wilkinson, who had then never lived in Negri Sembilan, wrote an extraordinarily illuminating introduction to the adat p\u00e9rpateh in \"Law II\" in \"Papers on Malay Subjects.\" Many of the articles that have appeared overlap, and the present collection is no exception. But all is grist to the mill of comparative method. \"Knowledge is knowledge of relations,\"\u2014especially in the Minangkabau world!\u2014and this paper has profited by comparison with those earlier articles; as well as with the adat of Minangkabau and its Sumatran colonies as delineated in Willineck's \"Het Rechtsleven bij de Minangkabausche Maleiers\" (Leiden, 1909) and in the series of volumes on Malayan custom published by \"Het Koninklijk Instituut voor de Taal-, Land en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb\" ('s-Gravenhage) and entitled \"Adatrechtbundel.\"\n\nThe comparative method has helped, for example, to explain the line yang b\u00e9rs\u00e9ap, yang b\u00e9rf\u00e9rami which puzzled the authors of \"Rembau;\" it has proved that for their impossible b\u00e9rsa-orangan the Minangkabau word p\u00e9rsuarangan (common enough in N\u00e9gri Sembilan) should be restored; it has shown us that for g\u00e9mak b\u00e9rpupok on p. 39 of Mr. Caldecott's \"Jelebu\" should be read g\u00e9mak di-p\u00e9rg\u00e9pokkan.\n\nIt may be said that textual points are of dilettante interest. Well, the comparative method helps also to reveal how funda-\nmental principles of very practical importance are apt to be warped by chiefs biased in some particular case in the local court.\n\n*Sa-kali ayer g\u0113dang*\n*Sa-kali t\u0113pian b\u0113ranjak;*\n*Sa-kali g\u0113dang b\u0113rganti,*\n*Sa-kali adat b\u0113rubah.*\n\n\"Every time a flood comes,\nLanding-places shift;\nEvery time a chief succeeds,\nCustom changes.\"\n\nSo runs a Minangkabau saying, and local wit has satirized the custom of the four important States of the Negri Sembilan:\n\n*Pioh pilin tangkai j\u0113ring adat R\u0113mbau;*\n*B\u0113rpusing adat J\u0113lebu bagai kinchir;*\n*\u0112ntah-lah, hai! adat S\u0113mujong;*\n*B\u0113rya b\u0113rtidak adat J\u014dhol.*\n\n\"Custom in Rembau is knotty and twisted as the stem of the j\u0113ring;\nIn Jelebu it goes round like a water-wheel;\nIt is doubtful in Sungai Ujong;\nIt is contradictory in Johol.\"\n\nBut Malays recognize, as European students have failed often to recognize, that despite this and despite modifications admitted to make the *adat* keep pace with the times, at bottom there is only one *adat Minangkabau*:\n\n*adat datar, p\u0113saka suatu.*\n\nAnd so well is it enshrined in old-world sayings that deviations from it can be detected easily enough. European enquirers have been too apt to accept every interested party's interpretation as correct and peculiar to his State; instead of seeking for the catholic interpretation of saying or custom:\n\n*sa-lengkong alam Minangkabau*\n\n\"throughout the circle of the Minangkabau world,\" where the custom has been so wonderfully conserved through centuries, even by the most distant colonists from that upland home.\n\nFor instance. On pp. 70 and 72 of \"Rembau,\" it is stated:\n\n\"If misfortune is all his bachelor life brings him, then (a man's) family is responsible for his debts......These duties of a mother to her son arise from the principle that the holder of ancestral property is responsible for the life and blood of all members of the family........Under Malay rule an insolvent debtor be-\n\n*The N. S. version reads pasir hanyut for t\u0113pian b\u0113ranjak and raja for g\u0113dang in the third line.*\ncame the slave of his creditor: he paid his debts in his body. The settlement of his debts alone preserved his free life and hence became a duty of his mother's family. The obligation of payment extended not only to the private debts of the bachelor, his unpaid bills, his less happy speculations and his losses at the gaming table\u2014but also to the utang adat (and utang p\u0113saka).\u201d Now this is true still so far as utang adat and utang p\u0113saka are involved. Is it true to-day of a bachelor's irresponsible debts? Certainly the adat tanggong-m\u0113nanggong is not so construed in Johol or in Jelebu or in Minangkabau itself. Yet judgment was once given on appeal against a Rembau's man's unfortunate female relation, the judge being loathe to reject evidence collected by the \u201cintelligent enquiry of the local magistrate:\u201d though in a later case of the same kind, another judge derided such an interpretation as ludicrous and opposed to principles of equity, adding caustic comments on the adat in general.\n\nThe Court, unlike the authors of \u201cRembau,\u201d did not recognize that honest involvency does not now entail imprisonment or affect the liberty of the debtor, so that the axiom nyawa darah pulang ka-waris no longer applies. Apart from that, where land speculations have undone a man, one might contend that rules framed by a frugal pastoral people did not contemplate comparatively large speculations in rubber or tin. And again private individualistic dealings in land would have been quite impossible in a strictly communal society. And the adat is not an inelastic code of law but bows to altered conditions.* In any case, so far from conserving the adat whole, our criminal courts daily give judgments anathema to its principles. But is any of this special pleading necessary? Let us hear, what Willineck writes about the adat tanggong-m\u0113nanggong as interpreted in Minangkabau itself:\n\n\u201cA Minangkabau Malay at all times can bind himself validly ex contractu only so far as his harta p\u0113ncharian go: ex delicto not only he but his whole family were bound in adat times\u2014his family only if he himself could not pay for his misdeed or crime, in which case his family became liable for the smart-money according to the adat tanggong-m\u0113nanggong. So a whole tribe or n\u0113g\u0113ri could become liable for smart-money, when one of its people had committed a crime, and the criminal's relatives even might become debt-slaves of the avenger. . . . . . . A Minangkabau Malay can never validly of his own self conclude bargains ex contractu, which affect harta p\u0113saka: if he contracts a bargain, no action thereon can be taken by the creditor against the man's family, but always only against the debtor and even then only against his harta p\u0113ncharian. . . . . . . The principle difference the adat makes between debts ex contractu and debts ex delicto is this: a man's family is liable for the former only if they are incurred properly, that is, contracted by the head\n\n* Vide \u201cRembau,\u201d p. 69, 70; and with the growth of population in the tribes (suku), tribal exogamy is no longer observed everywhere.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 78.\nof the family after agreement (sa-kata) of its members; debts ex delicto were claimed ipso jure from the whole family, if the guilty member were unable or unwilling to pay.\"\n\nNow that passage is perfectly clear, even though its application of terms of Roman law to the humble customs of Sumatran villagers must strike a note jarring to any ear sensitive to style and atmosphere. And Willinck's account holds good of Jelebu and of Johol. Pusing anak Rembau! Did they circumvent that local magistrate? Anyhow, there is plenty of evidence to support rejection in practice of an interpretation absurd and opposed to equity.\n\nAs I said above, a great deal has been written on the customs of Negri Sembilan and a great mystery made of them. But we still lack the evidence of the people themselves, their customary sayings and maxims, their speeches on occasions of ceremony. Students generally have recorded only disjecta membra of the adat. Mr. Humphreys was the first to give us scholarly versions of long speeches. Now Mr. Caldecott gives us these t\u0113romba or 'songs of origin' and a coherent set of sayings. For a later Journal I am preparing a collection of speeches from the district of Kuala Pilah; and I hope also to print one of the several versions I have obtained locally of Undang-Undang Minangkabau. Only when sufficient Malay material has been recorded, can we expect to get a readable definitive and comparative account of Minangkabau custom in the Negri Sembilan.\n\nWe are indebted to Mr. J. E. Nathan for the explanation of several abstruse passages.\nSongs of Origin\nand\nCustomary Sayings\nJELEBU CUSTOMARY SONGS AND SAYINGS.\n\nT\u00c9ROMBA.\n\nI.\n\nAllah b\u0115lum b\u0115rnama Allah,\nMuhamad b\u0115lum b\u0115rnama Nabi;\nBumi b\u0115lum b\u0115rnama bumi,\nBumi b\u0115rnama pusat n\u0115g\u0115ri;\nLangit b\u0115lum b\u0115rnama langit,\nLangit b\u0115rnama payong n\u0115g\u0115ri;\nBumi itu sa-g\u0115dang talam,\nLangit itu sa-g\u0115dang payong;\nGagak puteh, bangau hitam,\nDato\u2019 bujang, nenek gadis;\nSa-jaman raja jatoh t\u0115rdiri\nSa-jaman p\u0115nghulu jatoh t\u0115rp\u0115kur,\nSa-jaman l\u0115mbaga jatoh t\u0115rsila,\nT\u0115rbit adat dua t\u0115ripar,\nKa-laut T\u0115nggong\u00b9, ka-darat P\u0115rpateh,\nAdat b\u0115rt\u0115ntu, bilang b\u0115ratur;\nB\u0115runtok b\u0115rharta masing-masing.\nBuloh bilah, tanah di-tanam,\nB\u0115si b\u0115rd\u0115nting, puntong b\u0115rasap,\nSa-bingkah tanah di-tanam,\nTumboh aur nan b\u0115rjijir.\nTo\u2019 Kali Padang G\u0115nting,\nTo\u2019 S\u0115nama\u00b2 di-Suasa,\nTo\u2019 Kalifah di-n\u0115g\u0115ri Tambang,\nTo\u2019 M\u0115ngkudum di-n\u0115g\u0115ri Sumanik.\nDi-sambut raja Pagar Ruyong;\nLalu ka-Siak, ka-(?)

Jelebu, like Remban, has the saying Raja tiada m\u0113mpunyai n\u0113geri dan tiada boleh m\u0113nchukai kh\u0113rajat, m\u0113lainkan b\u0113rk\u0113adilan sahaia s\u016brta p\u0113rmakanan-nya. (\"Rembau,\" p. 110 translates kh\u0113rajat \"war-levy,\" but why? In Arabic it means, \"land-tax,\" and that fits the context exactly. In N. S. the phrase kh\u0113rajat mati is always used of \"funeral expenses.\" B\u0113rk\u0113adilan = \"possessed of the powers of a justiciar.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) \"Transplanted it (the custom) withers, uprooted it dies\" (Rembau, p. 100, VIII.) The saying is also used of the dismissal of a chief from office, and of removing an offender from the path of evil or eradicating him from the tribe.\nThe tribal headmen by common consent can elect or dismiss a chief.\nThe chiefs by common consent and with the support of the tribal headmen can elect or dismiss the king.\nWhat is transplanted withers, what is uprooted dies:\nIs a saying of our hereditary custom.\nWhen custom does not obstruct,\nNor religion prevent,\nOne can marry and give in marriage.\nWhen a man marries into any tribe,\nIt is clear, says custom,\nHe becomes a drawer of water and hewer of wood.\nWhen a man marries and goes to his wife's family,\nHe will be a friend in council, if clever;\nIf foolish, he will be ordered about.\nA tall man, he will be as a sheltering buttress;\nProsperous he will be as a well-laden branch that gives shade.\nThe married man must go, when he is bid\nAnd halt, when he is forbid.\nWhen we receive a man as a bridegroom,\nIf he is strong, he shall be our champion;\nIf a fool, he will be ordered about\nTo invite guests distant and collect guests near;\nClever and we'll invite his counsel;\nLearned and we'll ask his prayers;\nRich and we'll use his gold;\nIf lame, he shall scare chicken,\nIf blind, he shall pound the mortar,\nIf deaf, he shall fire our salutes.\nIf you enter a byre, low;\nIf you enter a goat's pen, bleat;\nFollow the customs of your wife's family.\nWhen you tread the soil of a country and live beneath its sky,\nFollow the customs of that country.\nA bridegroom among his bride's relations\nIs like a cucumber among durian fruit;\nIf he rolls against them, he is hurt,\nAnd he is hurt, if they roll against him.\n\n3 = m\u0113nghambat.\n4 \"If he is clever, I will try to cajole him\" (Rembau, p. 116 XLVII). \"Rembau\" accepted this translation from Mr. Hale, who had excuse for rendering t\u0113man \"I,\" as he had been a Perak officer. T\u0113man is a Perak and not a N. S. word for \"I,\" and b\u0113runding does not mean \"cajole.\"\n5 Tinggi banir and rimbun dah\u0101n do not necessarily imply one and the same person (\"Rembau,\" p. 117 XLVII): they contrast the strong man and the rich man.\n\nR.

I think there is little doubt that the first line is a N. S. paraphrase for the Minangkabau terms of the fifth line, and that the two lines are identical and refer to joint earnings of husband and wife. Line 5 always takes the place of line 1 in real Minangkabau pepatah and line 1 does not occur. \u00b2 Cf. note 1, p. 30. \"Rembau\" reads ber-suarangan, obviously corrupt, because ber\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026an is a plural formative and sa\u2014a singular and their conjunction unthinkable: persuarangan is a Minangkabau form common in N.

Willineck (p. 629) found Sumatran pundits\ntaking the same view. \"Rembau,\" p. 114 translates \"while\nat one, share alike,\" an impossible rendering because b\u0113l\u0101h =\n'divide,' not 'share.'

O. Winstedt.\n\nOf late years the Dutch Government has published many of its journals on Medicine and Agriculture in English as well as Dutch, and recently a Year-Book of the Netherlands East Indies, 1916. It is a pity that cost will probably preclude private societies from following this example, or British students would have a better chance to become acquainted with the abundant fruits of Dutch scholarship. In this paper I propose to invite attention to notes on the derivation and meaning of some Malay words printed in the Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb, uitgegeven door het Koninklijk Instituut.\n\nDeel LIV, 1902 p. 311-312 contains a note by H. Kern, pointing out that the Malay word b\u0113dil is derived from the Tamil vedil or vediyal \u2018explosion of gun-powder.\u2019\u2014cf. vediluppu \u2018saltpetre\u2019 with the Batak sira bodil \u2018saltpetre.\u2019 For the change from v to b one may compare B\u0113landa from Wolanda. For the change in the accent from the penultimate to the final syllable, one may compare the Malay p\u0113li with the Tamil petli, the Malay k\u0113dai with the Tamil kadai. Where the paroxytone is retained, as in Tamil, then the indeterminate vowel is not found:\u2014Tamil s\u2019atai \u2018meat,\u2019 Malay s\u0101tai, Javanese sate.\n\nIn Deel LV pp. 50-52, Dr. Ph. S. van Ronkel has a paper on the derivation of satai and other Malay words from the Tamil\u2014bagai, ragam, s\u0113gala, badai, jodo, kod\u012b, patam, m\u0113t\u0113rai.\n\nOn p. 483 Deel LVIII., derde en vierde Afllevering (1905) the same writer has a short paper on \u201cKuda S\u0113mb\u0113rani.\u201d\n\nKlinkert interpreted the word s\u0113mb\u0113rani as s\u0113m + b\u0113rani \u2018fiery, spirited.\u2019 Pijnappel derived it from the Sanskrit suwarna \u2018bright coloured,\u2019 for which Riau-Johore Malay has s\u0113mburna and Kedah s\u0113mbawarna Prof. Kern thought it might be from sauparni or sauparneya, \u201coffspring of Suparna\u201d one of the names of Garuda. Lexicographers have translated the word \u2018a mythical breed of horse,\u2019 \u2018winged steed,\u2019 \u2018a Pegasus.\u2019\n\nTwo forms of it are found: s\u0113mb\u0113rani and s\u0113mburani. In the Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 66, p. 32) occur\nthe phrases kuda semberani, anak kuda Parasi and kuda galak kelabu semberani anak kuda Parasi:\u2014The Romanizer has wrongly put kelak for galak and Perasi for Parasi, it should be noted. The horse is one that tiada penah di-kandarai manusia \u201chas never been ridden by man.\u201d The passage makes it clear that reference is not to a mythical steed but to an unbroken horse, of mixed breed: \u2018anak Parasi\u2019 = \u2018having a Persian sire\u2019 only, while pure Persian would be simply kuda Parasi. P\u00e2raci is the Tamil form of \u2018Persian\u2019, while the usual Malay form is disyllabic Parsi. Kelabu \u2018ash-grey\u2019 describes generally the colour of mouse or wolf, but van Ronkel thinks it may perhaps be used of \u2018bay\u2019 horses. A half-breed Persian horse would be quite likely in the Malay archipelago: certainly horses were imported from India; even the word kuda is the Sanskrit ghola in its Deccan form koda.\n\nNow in Tamil \u2018bay\u2019 red is cem:\u2014cembadai \u2018red hair,\u2019 cembalam \u2018yellowish fruits,\u2019 cemmari \u2018red short-haired sheep.\u2019 Again there are two Tamil words puram and purani both meaning \u2018the outside, bark, hide.\u2019 Cem + purani would properly become cemburani = semberani = semberani: and the word would mean \u2018with reddish hide, bay.\u2019 Perhaps the word occurs for the first time in this passage form the \u201cChronicles of Pasai;\u201d if so, the unusual Tamil form Parasi would lead us to expect almost any other unusual word in the sentence to have a Tamil form. Professor van Ronkel\u2019s interpretation seems very plausible.\n\nIn Deel LXVI the late Professor Ch. A. van Ophuijsen has published lexicographical notes elicited by the appearance of Klinkert\u2019s Nieuw Maleisch-Nederlandsch Zakwoordenboek in 1910. It is too long an article for me to notice any but a few points here. He remarks that in the S\u00eajarah Melayu we have a meaning of nagara \u2018hill-top\u2019 (naga \u2018hill,\u2019 agra \u2018top\u2019) which has escaped lexicographers:\u2014di-ikut baginda ka-atas bukit, bertemu di-nagara bukit itu. He surmises that padusi is derived from the Sk. vidushi \u2018wise,\u2019 and periidi from the Sk. vriddhi \u2018growth, increase.\u2019 He points out that in Minangkabau kain ainul-banat becomes kain Indabanat, and Inda = Indera and suggests that it is a fabric labelled with the name of some place like Ind\u00e9rawanat. The whole paper is valuable to the lexicographer and corrects many errors of Klinkert, even if some of the derivations suggested for words may be doubtful.\n\nOn p. 422 Deel 68, derde Aflevering (1913) G. P. Rouffaer discusses the derivation of the words kachi, chengkurai and chindai. Klinkert interpreted kain kuchi = \u2018fine shirting,\u2019 and chaul he derived from the Persian sal and muri from \u201cmoir\u00e9\u201d and Belati from berhati! Prof. Kern (Bijd. Kon. Inst. 7, I p. 442) pointed out in 1903 that Malay chaul and old Javanese chaweli were derived really from the Indian trading port \u201cChaul.\u201d Wilkinson derived Belati from the Skr. vilayati, apparently printing \u201cSkr.\u201d by a slip for \u201cArabic,\u201d the Arabic being wilayati, walayti \u201cof the motherland\u201d and thence \u201cEuropean.\u201d Malay muri = muris = molis = Jay. mori \u201cwhite calico.\u201d\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nRouffaer points out that the Arabic long \\( i \\) is suffixed often to names of places to form adjectives.\n\nMalay \\( B\u0113rochi = Bharochi = (silk) from Bharoch (Broach). \\)\n\n\\( S\u0113lampuri = S\u0113rampuri = (blue cotton) from S\u0113ram-pore. \\)\n\n\\( Surati = (Cotton) from Surat. \\)\n\n\\( Kachi = (White cotton) from Cutch. \\)\n\nRouffaer expresses wonder that Klinkert had not consulted Wilkinson's Dictionary for the derivations of \\( B\u0113lati \\) and \\( Kachi \\).\n\nSo many Malay words for fabrics are geographical. \\( Kain K\u0113mbayat 'cloth from Cambay;' kuin P\u0113lekut 'cloth from Palikat*; kain Ch\u0113mpa 'cloth from Champa.' Rouffaer would derive Ch\u0113ngkurai from an Arab pronunciation of Singgora:\n\n\\( S\u0113nggora-i = Ch\u0113ngkurai = Ch\u0113ngkurai \\)\n\nVon de Wall interpreted \\( kain chindai = 'a patterned silk fabric from Surat.' \\) The Livro of Duarte Barbosa, published in 1516, quotes the word as \\( chande \\) and translates it \"large silk mantillas worn by the women of Gujerat.\" Rouffaer claims that \\( Chindai \\) means \"from Sind,\" through the Javinese form \\( Chinde: Chindai \\) he considers a bastard corruption of the older Javanese form, a corruption for which he finds parallels in certain place-names\u2014Mal. \\( K\u016btai = Jav.

Winstedt.\n\n(With two plates)\n\nWhen I was last in Europe, Mr. Blagden gave me a transcript of the inscription on a tomb purporting to be that of Sultan Mansur Shah, one of the rulers of Malacca before the advent of the Portuguese. Mr. Hervey had got two of the inscriptions transcribed and had told Mr. Blagden that the tomb still existed. Mr. Blagden asked me if I could trace it. On a visit to Malacca, I found the two stones of the tomb placed against the wall of the Residency; Mr. Wolferstan kindly arranged for them to be photographed and undertook to take steps for their preservation. The photographs have been reproduced for its Journal.\n\nAn account of Sultan Mansur Shah\u2019s reign will be found on pp. 24-26 of Wilkinson\u2019s \u201cHistory, Part I\u201d in the \u201cPapers on Malay Subjects\u201d (F. M. S. Govt. Press, Kuala Lumpur).\n\nAccording to Hervey\u2019s version, the inscription of the face at the bottom (or left) of Plate I should be deciphered as follows:\n\n\u201cHadza raudzat al-mukaddasat wa\u2019t-daulat al-tamih, al-matharat al-Sultan al-munawar al-adil al-malik al-badzil al-Sultan al-marhum Mansur Shah, kad antakala min dar al-mahal ila dar al-wird yaum al-arbaa sanat dua Rajab wa thamanin wa thaman mi\u2019ah.\u201d\n\nThe translation is.\n\n\u201cThis is the tomb of the illustrious high and righteous glorious and just Sultan, the beneficent prince, the ruler loved of God, Mansur Shah. He departed this mortal abode for the abode of bliss on Wednesday, the second day of the month of Rejab in the year of the Hegira 880.\u201d\n\nThe inscription on the two edges of the tomb is deciphered:\u2014\n\nwhich means\n\n\u201cAl-asma\u2019 al-dufana\u2019 al-Sultan al-Ali.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name of the deceased, the most exalted Sultan.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd of R\u0113jab 880 A.H. = Wednesday, Nov. 1, 1475 A.D. But unfortunately the bottom line of the inscription would seem to have been chipped and damaged since Hervey\u2019s day. If the date is correct, the tomb will be the oldest known relic in Malacca, perhaps with the exception of the Hindu makara at the foot of the Residency hill.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 78.\nIt is fair to add that a local Arab pundit to whom photos of the tomb were submitted could not make the above version out of the inscription and failed to give an intelligible interpretation. It would require a scholar acquainted with the carved Arabic script of that period to give a final interpretation: possibly Hervey got his version from such a scholar but there is no record. The hole in the other stone finds a parallel in the hole of the Pengkalan Kempas tomb.\nGordonia concentricicatrix, Burkill,\n(Kelat samak, Samak pulut, Kelat merah\u2014Malay)\n\nBy G. E. S. Cubitt.\n(With one plate)\n\nThis new species, of which a botanical description was published in pages 152 and 153 of No. 76 of the Society's Journal, is illustrated in the frontispiece. It is a large evergreen tree attaining a height of over 100 feet with a maximum girth so far recorded of 8\u00bd feet at 4\u00bd feet from the ground. The stem is cylindrical and slightly thickened at the base, but not buttressed. The bark has been variously described as light brown, reddish brown, and fawn-coloured, and peels off in flakes a foot or more in length and an inch to three inches wide, the peeling usually being from below upwards. The flakes in falling leave a light terra-cotta coloured smooth new bark, marked with lozenge-shaped concentric scars resembling a contour map. The scars are not always as conspicuous as those shown in the plate, but are always perfectly evident, and can at any time be exposed by removing the loose bark. The scars are also clearly visible on the inside of the old bark, but tend to disappear with age on the outside. The bark, when cut or wounded, exudes a dark blood red or crimson sticky juice, which turns black on drying. Below the bark the blaze is white. The crown is fairly open.\n\nIt is not unlikely that the tree flowers and fruits twice yearly, the fruit taking about 6 months to ripen. In Selangor on the 21st May, 1917, the tree was in full flower; on the 31st May, 1916, the stamens had fallen, and the fruit was just beginning to form; in June, 1916, ripe capsules were collected; in July, 1917, old fallen fruit was found on the ground; in October, 1917, the fruit of the flowering of the previous May had not yet ripened. In Pahang the tree is said to flower in December and January; in August, 1917, neither flower nor fruit was obtainable.\n\nGordonia concentricicatrix is somewhat uncommon but is widely distributed, being recorded from Malacca and the Dindings, as well as from Selangor and Pahang. So far as is known at present it grows only at low elevations, probably not above 1000'. In the Rantau Panjang Reserve in Selangor it occurs over a small area in large numbers, 25 trees from 15\" to 8\u00bd' (average 4\u00bd') in girth at breast height having been counted on two acres. This is however exceptional and, elsewhere it occurs sporadically. Its chief associates in the Rantau Panjang Reserve, where the soil is a loam,\nare Ochanostachys amentacea and various species of Shorea, with Eugei-\nssonia tristis in the under-growth. In the Bangi Reserve in Selangor it is found with Kelat Merah (Eugenia sp.), and its resemblance to this tree no doubt accounts for its being known to some Malays by the same name. The Eugenia bark is similar in colour to that of the Gordonia, but does not peel off in the same long flakes. The Eugenia also has scars on the new bark, but they are not very conspicuous and are wavy rather than concentric. Finally the blaze of the Eugenia is quite dry.\n\nGordonia concentricicatrix yields a tough close-grained pinkish to red-brown timber somewhat lighter than water and said by the Malays to be suitable for house-building. The bark is used in Pahang for dyeing fishing nets and clothing for rough use, cloth treated three times with the dye becoming, so it is said, fairly waterproof.\n\nThe following corrections should be made in the botanical description already referred to:\n\n(i) Under figures 10 and 11 \"Abdul Rawi\" should read \"Abdul Rani.\"\n\n(ii) Under figure 11 \"898\" should read \"878.\"\n\n(iii) In the particulars of occurrence the sentence \"ex Selangor.............et cum fructibus\" should read \"ex Selangor ad Rantau Panjang colegerunt sub numero C. F. 878 J. G. Watson et Abdul Rani mense Maio cum floribus et mense Junio cum fructibus.\"\nEnglish Tombs and Monuments in Bencoolen.\n\nBy C. J. Brooks.\n(With three plates).\n\nBencoolen, as an early English settlement in the East, may lay claim to more than passing interest from the historian of English pioneer colonisation, and to the naturalist, as a centre where early researches were made, in a country of which the fauna and flora are but still incompletely known, and whose vast forests are yet unexplored.\n\nIt was in connection with the latter that the writer's attention was drawn to the old English tombs in Bencoolen while seeking the burial place of Joseph Arnold, the discoverer of the Rafflesia, and that of William Jack, the author of Malayan Miscellanies, both were presumably buried there\\(^1\\). Neither can be located, possibly they are among the majority whose tombs bear no inscription, together with Sir T. S. Raffles' son and Capt. Auber, both mentioned in Jack's letters to Wallich as dying during this period in Bencoolen\\(^2\\), while that of Jn. Lancaster, Surgeon\\(^3\\), is in evidence.\n\nThey may however rest in some forgotten spot, perhaps adjoining the old Residency, wherever it was, for interments were not confined to the burial ground, although in existence at the time, and the earliest inscribed grave bears the date 1775, but are somewhat scattered at least those of the governing class. For instance Capt. Hamilton's tomb is even now on the outskirts of the town while others are in Fort Marlboro, and the site of Governor Watts' is unknown.\n\nIn this record it has been assumed that old tombs bearing no inscription belong to the period under consideration, at the same time it must be admitted there is little justification for doing so; in either case it is difficult to understand why so many tombs bear no inscription, 46 in a total of 73. In nearly every instance a recess exists for the insertion of a tablet, possibly some have been stolen, but in many cases the sides are so smooth that it is unlikely one was ever inserted.\n\nMagnificent casuarinas and crotons give a picturesque effect, and lend a solemn shade during the hot hours of the day. The tombs are well tended as far as the removal of vegetation and whitewashing is concerned, many show large cracks in the masonry probably\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Jack's letters to Wallich, vide introduction This Journal No. 73\n\\(^2\\) \" \"\n\\(^3\\) \" \"\n\nJour.

Jansen, T. Pzn., for assistance in compiling these notes.\n\n**Tombs in Fort Marlborough.**\n\nTo the right on entering the barbican and below the barbette, are three altar tombs, side by side, each surmounted by a massive slate slab.

In one case it seems that it was erected to his order, this would then follow for the other.\n\n**The Monument to Resident Parr.**\n\nThis handsome monument, a well proportioned domed pavilion, stands by itself in a small grass square in the busiest part of the town, at the top of the main Pasar adjoining the recreation ground.\n\nThere is no inscription indicating the purpose for which it was erected, and at the present time the inhabitants both European and Native are almost entirely ignorant of its origin.\n\nResident Parr was murdered by the natives in 1805.\n\nThe condition of affairs preceding the tragedy, and later the revenge taken by the Government on the natives is described in Nahuy's Letters, and Lady Raffles's Memoir, (vide, Onze Indische Financien, by E. de Waal, p. 8 & 9.) of which the following is a brief summary:\n\nThe business of the East India Company was essentially in pepper, and to insure the largest profits against the lowest prices only elementary agreements were made with the head natives.\n\nThe Governor and other functionaries were allowed to trade on their own account, especially in the importation of opium and piece goods to Java.\n\nThe total trade of the port at this time was worth about \u00a3100,000 per annum, while the Company's trade in pepper was declining, they\u2014the Company\u2014decided to economise.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nOLD BRITISH TOMBS IN BENCOOLEN.\nIn 1801 under the Governor-General Lord Wellesley a commissioner was sent from the High Court of Bengal to Bencoolen with authority to suspend the Governor and his two councillors and reduce the number of functionaries, prohibit private trading, and reduce the Settlement to a dependency of Bengal.\n\nIt appears that the commission was executed in a tactless manner. The garrison of Fort Marlboro was assembled in arms and the commission read in public.\n\nA considerable outcry resulted from this insult, some of the dismissed received compensation, while others were dismissed without pay and being bound to the place became impoverished. These conditions caused great discontent which was increased among the natives by the action of Resident Parr, who was sent from Bengal to succeed the late Governor.\n\nHe proceeded to reform the native administration of justice without consulting the native chiefs, assuming a despotic power over them. To the cultivation of pepper he added coffee and made both compulsory.\n\nMoreover being used in his former position in Bengal to absolute obedience he personally insulted many of the most important natives.\n\nBefore long a conspiracy against his life was deliberated, this was known but Parr although warned would pay no attention.\n\nOn a determined night his house at Mt. Felix\u2014some three miles south of the Fort\u2014was attacked by a band of natives who overpowered the guard, then entered the room where Parr lay ill and decapitated him, in an attempt to defend him his wife and secretary Murray were wounded, but no attempt was made on their lives nor on the lives of other inhabitants of Bencoolen.\n\nThe attack was a personal matter.\n\nThe action of the Government relative to this is described in Lady Raffles's Memoir:\n\nThe measures that followed were of a doubtful cast.\n\nAs soon as it was discovered that the designs of the people were confined to the assassination, and not directed against the settlement generally, search was made for the perpetrators of the act. Rewards were offered for the apprehension, alive or dead, of the assassins.\n\nIt was thought unsafe to touch the chiefs. Several of the people were blown from the mouths of guns. As the danger diminished, the spirit of indignation and revenge seemed to have increased. An order was given to burn and destroy every village within a certain distance, and the work of de-\nvastation was carried on as if it where intended to place the future security of the settlement in surrounding it with a desert. The fruit-trees, venerable by their age, that surround a Malay village, are the protecting deities of the place, and are regarded with reverence and respect; Their destruction is looked upon as little less than sacrilege; Yet the axe was laid to their roots, and what ever could shelter or protection was levelled with the ground, and the whole population of the suspected villages turned loose upon the country.\n\nTo retain this in the memory of the people a handsome monument was erected by the natives to the order of the Government, in honor of Parr.\n\nIt serves now as an ornament to the town, and a very suitable shelter to President Watts tombstone, the original site of this stone is now unknown. It leans against the inner wall, a massive granite slab, artistically inscribed as follows:\u2014\n\nRichard Watts Esq.\nSometime of Council for the Rt. Honble Compas Affairs in Fort St. George.\nAnd in the year 1699 came over Deputy Governor of this Place.\nAnd in about three years after made by Commission from the Company the first President of this Coast.\nIn which station he departed this life December 17, 1705.\nAnd in the 44 year of his age.\n\nThe Obelisk to Capt.

Hanitsch,\nDirector, Raffles Museum, Singapore.\n\n(With two plates.)\n\nTwo French gentlemen, Monsieur Louis Chocho and Monsieur Gabriel Saint-Poulof, of Quinhon, Annam, presented last year (1917) to the Raffles Museum the skin and skeleton of a Goat-Antelope or Serow, together with the photographs of the living animal, careful measurements and an account of its capture and of its behaviour in captivity.\n\nThe animal had been picked up in the sea by native fishermen on the morning of February 5th, 1917, off the peninsula of Phu'ong Mai (lat. about 13\u00b0 30' N) in Annam, having apparently fallen from the high cliffs there. Monsieur Toulouse, Commissioner of Police, was the first to hear of it and informed M. Chocho and M. Saint-Poulof of this strange occurrence. They hastened to the spot and found the animal alive, tied to a tree and surrounded by gaping Annamites. The animal was uninjured, but seemed much frightened and pulled hard on the rope. It allowed itself to be touched and to be caressed, though all the same its eyes were rolling for terror. Once it pulled so hard that its feet slipped, causing it to fall heavily to the ground.\n\nM. Saint-Poulof bought the animal from its captors, placed it on a cart and took it to his house where he photographed it. It continued to make desperate efforts to get free from the rope. It drank readily, but refused to feed although it was offered leaves and grass from the hills specially gathered for its benefit, and died three days after.\n\nThe natives knew nothing definite about the haunts and the distribution of this animal. They said it lived in the mountains and moved about at night time only; they affirmed that it was rare and that only woodcutters and charcoal burners occasionally met with it. They regarded its flesh as edible, though it brought ill luck to those who ate it. The horns were said to have wonderful medicinal properties, and the Chinese apothecaries pay high prices for them for treating nervous diseases.\n\nThe Annamite name of the animal is \"con de nui\" which really signifies \"wild horse.\" The French of Indo-China, however, call it \"mouflon,\" and French sportsmen state that it occurs along the coast of central Annam, on a small island opposite Tourane,\ncalled \"Ile aux mouflons,\" also on the islands of the Bay of Along and in the neighbourhood of Ninh-Binh, Tonkin. (The Bay of Along and Ninh-Binh lie due East and South-East of Hanoi respectively).\n\nThe occurrence of a \"Wild Goat,\" or more correctly, of a \"Goat-Antelope\" or \"Serow,\" in South-Eastern Asia has been known for more than a hundred years. The first description of a Serow is by William Marsden, who in his \"History of Sumatra,\" 1st edition, 1783, p. 93, says:\n\n\"Goat: Cambing. Beside the domestic species, which is in general small, and of light brown color, there is the cambing ootan, or goat of the woods. One which I saw was three feet in height, and four feet in length of the body. It had something of the gazelle in its appearance and, excepting the horns, which were about six inches long, and turned back with an arch, it did not much resemble the common goat. The hinder parts were shaped like those of a bear, the rump sloping round off from the back. The tail was very small, and ended in a point. The legs clumsy. The hair, along the ridge of the back, rising coarse and strong, almost like bristles. No beard. Over the shoulder was a large spreading tuft of greyish hair: the rest of the hair black throughout. The scrotum globular. Its disposition seemed wild and fierce, and it is said by the natives to be remarkably swift.\" Bechstein, in his \"Allgemeine Ubersicht der vierfu\u00dfigen Thiere,\" 1799, Vol. I, p. 98, based upon this description his Antilope sumatraensis, and Raffles (Transactions, Linnean Society, Vol. XIII (1822), p. 266) and others corroborated the occurrence of a Serow in Sumatra. Raffles says that he kept one for months, but found it impossible to tame it, and that it finally died from impatience of confinement.\n\nThe Raffles Museum has one specimen of a Serow from Sumatra, obtained at Lebong Tandai, near Beukoeien, and presented in August of last year (1917) by Messrs. P. Jansen T. Pzn and C. J. Brooks. According to Mr. Brooks the animal seems to be common in the neighbourhood, as he once saw a number of Serow skins at a native auction at Tijroep. This Sumatran form appears by Blanford, Lydekker, S. S. Flower, Butler, Rowland Ward and others under the name of Nemorhaedus sumatrensis, though Pocock has since shown that it should be known as Capricornis sumatraensis. (See his papers in A. M. N. H. (8) Vol. I. pp. 183-188, and P. Z. S. 1908, pp. 173-202).\n\nTo Dr. N. Wallich who had so many connections with Singapore, belongs the honor of having exhibited before the Zoological Society, London, the first specimen of a Serow from the mainland of Asia. This was in January 1832, and the skin had been transmitted to him by Mr. B. H. Hodgson, British Resident at Katmandoo (or Khatmandu), Nepal. Hodgson's detailed description of this animal, under the name of Antilope bubalina, is found in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, Part II (1832), pp.\nHe says: \"It is seldom found in herds, however small, and the grown males usually live entirely alone, except in the breeding season. Of all the Deers or Antelopes of these hills (viz: in Nepal) it is the most common. It tenants the central region equidistant from the snows on the one hand, and the plains of India on the other.\" This Antelope has now to be called *Capricornis sumatraensis* sub-sp. *thar* Hodgson (see Pocock, P. Z. S. 1908, p. 176).\n\nThe first record of a Serow inhabiting the Malay Peninsula is, as is to be expected, by Theodore Cantor, in his \"Catalogue of Mammals inhabiting the Malayan Peninsula and Islands,\" originally published in the Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. XV (1846), p. 272, and subsequently reprinted in \"Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China,\" ser. 1, Vol. II (1886), p. 57. However, his remarks are disappointingly meagre. He merely says: \"It appears to be numerous on the Malayan Peninsula, but exceedingly difficult to obtain, as it frequents the steepest hilly localities, and is very shy and active.\" This Malay Peninsular Serow which is now well-known, is, if not identical with, so at least closely allied to, the Sumatran form, and two geographical races of it have been described, viz: *Capricornis sumatraensis swettenhami*, Butler and *Capricornis sumatraensis robinsoni*, Pocock. These, together with five other sub-species, are discussed by Pocock, Proc. Zool. Soc., London, 1908, pp. 173-190.\n\nThe Raffles Museum possesses two pairs of horns of this animal, one from Tanjong Rambutan, Perak, and the other from Chankat Mandai, Ulu Kinta, both presented by Mr. E. M. Schwabe in 1905, and the sportsman will find in George Maxwell's \"In Malay Forests\" full directions as how to obtain this elusive \"Wild Goat\" or at least to get within a mile of it! (see pp. 167-185). Locally it is known as \"Kambing gerun,\" besides as \"Kambing utan,\" the name recorded by Marsden.\n\nFurther species of Serow were recorded from other parts of South-Eastern Asia, from Kashmir, the Himalayas, China, Tonkin and Burmah, Father Heude especially distinguishing himself by describing no less than 24 species from China and Tonkin alone which in the eighties and nineties of last century he with the help of numerous other Catholic Missionaries had collected. The specimens were deposited in the Sikawei Museum, Shanghai. Sowerby (P. Z. S. 1917 pp. 7-26) undertook the trouble of working through this vast collection and succeeded in reducing Heude's 24 species and David's one species to the following:\n\n*Capricornis argyrochates*, Heude. The Province of Chekiang, S. E. China.\n\n*vidianus*, Heude. The region of N. E. Ssuchuan and S. Shensi, Central China.\n\n*milne-edwardsi*, David. W. Ssuchuan, N. W. Ssuchuan and S. W. Kansu, W. China.\n\n*collasinus*, Heude. Kuang-tung Province, S. China.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 78.\nCapricornis rocherianus, Heude. Along Bay, Tonkin, S. W. China.\n\nTo come now to a description of the Serow from Annam, secured by Messrs. Chochoh and Saint-Poulof:\n\nMale; not quite adult, as the condition of the skull shows; coat shaggy; hair coarse; mane well developed. Colour: fore head, from nose to base of horns, rufous; cheeks black; from behind the eyes to base of ears, rusty; back of ears, rusty; inside of ears, white; upper lip, white; under lip, white, enclosing below a median patch of black; beard, white; throat and breast, black; mane long, composed of two sorts of hair: some entirely white, the others, more numerous, white at the base, black distally; belly black, behind with a few grey hair; sides of back with hair white at the base, black distally, producing together a greyish effect; forelegs, black down to the knees, except for a rusty patch at the inside; below knees, rusty, darker in front than behind; hind legs, black down to the hocks, without any grey; below the hocks, rusty brown; tail, black above, white beneath.\n\nIts measurements, taken immediately after death, were: height at the shoulder 821 mm.; total length from between the horns to the tip of the tail 1300 mm.; ears 220 mm.; horns 170 mm.; tail 110 mm.\n\nPocock, in P. Z. S. 1908, p. 189, gives the measurements of the skulls of four different forms of Serow (Capricornis sumatraensis) from Kashmir, Nepal, Chamba (Western Himalayas) and Selangor respectively, and to allow a ready comparison with the skulls of the Serow from Annam and of the above mentioned Serow from Sumatra, presented by Messrs. Jansen and Brooks, I reprint herewith his table, adding the measurements of the two latter Serows. The Sumatran skull, unfortunately, was partly broken, so that two of the measurements could not be taken. It was that of an old male.\n\nThe table shows that the Annamite form approaches in its skull measurements nearest the Serow from Chamba, Capricornis sumatraensis sub-sp. rodoni, Pocock, yet differing from it by being narrower across the premaxillae, zygomata and the posterior portion of the palate, by its longer, but narrower nasals, and by its greater height at the frontals. The Sumatran skull has in most respects the smallest dimensions, with the exception of the palate which anteriorly is extraordinarily wide. Naturally, a much larger series of skulls would be necessary to arrive at safe conclusions.\nSKULL OF A SEROW (CAPRICORNIS Sp.) FROM PHU'ONG MAI, ANNAM. X 1.\nA. FROM THE SIDE; B. FROM BELOW; C.

Z. S. 1908, p. 190) for identifying his seven geographical races of *C. sumatraensis*, we find, however, that the Serow from Annam differs markedly from the subspecies *rodoni*, the latter having \u201cbreast and underside white, and sharply defined from the dark colour of the rest of the body,\u201d and that it comes nearest to the sub-species *jamrachi*, from Darjiling, though differing from it by its forehead being rufous, instead of coal black, by its coat being shaggy, instead of \u2018short at all seasons,\u2019 and other characters.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 78.\nNeither does Sowerby's revision of Heude's 24 species (see P. Z. S. 1917, pp. 7-26) lead to a satisfactory conclusion as to the specific position of our Serow. According to locality it ought to be *Capricornis rocherianus* Heude, from Along Bay, Tonkin, but this latter species is distinguished by its creamy-white stockings. Mr. Kloss who has been working up the Mammals of Siam, tells me that he has from there Serow skins with brown legs which he considers to come under *milne-edwardsi* or *vidianus*. So it is very possible that the Serow from Annam may belong to one of these two species. But more material and much more study will be required before this question can be settled satisfactorily.\n\n**LITERATURE.**\n\n1783. **William Marsden**, History of Sumatra, 1st ed., p. 93.\n1799. **Bechstein**, Allgemeine Uebersicht der vierfu\u00dfigen Thiere, Vol. I, p. 98.\n1801. **Shaw**, Gen.

BAKER.\n\nOn August 21st, 1917, during a period of frequent showers, an hour's work in a narrow strip on the east side of the Gardens' Jungle in the Singapore Botanical Gardens produced specimens of sixteen species, representing four generic groups, of the Boletinae. It would not have been possible to duplicate this remarkable showing on any subsequent day of the year. Evidently there had been optimum conditions for Boleti just previous to August 21st.\n\nDiagnoses of all these species were prepared from the living plants, measurements taken from many specimens, and vertical section outlines made, after which the material was rapidly and carefully dried. The species fall into four generic groups, provided Boletopsis be considered of generic value. The genus Phylloporus of Quelet, with spores formed by anastomosing lamellae, is well represented by Phylloporus malaccensis (No. 5004). Strobilomyces finds a characteristic representative in S. porphyrius (No. 5002). The genus (or subgenus) Boletopsis is represented by three very distinct species, B. icterinus, B. singaporensis, and B. corrugatus.\n\nAmong the sixteen species there are represented three distinct types of spores: 1st, the usual type for Boletus, including those of most of the species; 2nd, a banded type, the spores bearing narrow longitudinal bands in relief, as in Boletopsis singaporensis and Strobilomyces prophyrius; 3rd, a reticulate type, the spores being strongly reticulate-alveolate, a remarkable feature found also in Tuber, but quite unique in Boletus. This type is represented by one species, Boletus retisporus.\n\nAll of these species have been compared, with great care, with species which have been recorded from the Far East by Berkeley, Petch, and others, and especially with those described by Massee from the collections of Ridley. With the full descriptions taken from living specimens, it has been found impossible to crowd any of these species into the congeries of forms under previously recorded names. Indeed, it would be only the purest guess-work, with any comparisons of existing herbarium material. It must be understood that most of the conspicuous characters of the living plants are evanescent and that but the remotest conception of the living plant can be had from a dried specimens unaccompanied by detailed data taken from the living plant. Colored drawings alone will not suffice, since many clearly diagnostic characters cannot be\nshown in such drawings. Even the simple process of drying, which was uniform for all the species, brought out various striking differences. For instance in *Boletus spinifer* and *Boletus umbrinellus*, as well as in most of the other species, the flesh is very firm and holds its form well while drying, whereas in *Boletus retisporus* and *Strobilomyces porphyrius*, the flesh softens very rapidly, collapse taking place before drying is accomplished. On the other hand, one species, *Boletus tristis*, dried out very readily and rapidly without the aid of heat, just as it lay, on an open table.\n\nThe characterisations of all the species under consideration are presented herewith in synoptical form, using for separation, where possible, the most readily recognizable characters, so that other students may easily follow up the work and make more extensive comparisons of living material and of material from other parts of the Peninsula.\n\nSection I.

Marshall.\n\nGunong Say, mentioned in this Journal, 1917, p. 265, as one of the localities where James Motley collected, is situated on the right bank of the river Brunei approximately $2\\frac{1}{4}$ miles S. by W. of the town itself which is built on the water in a bend of the river. The hill is directly facing the residency which is on the opposite side of the river and bears nearly due N. E. and $2\\frac{1}{4}$ miles from Gunong Say, so that it is about equidistant from the town and residency. A neighbouring hill is Gunong Sumur, a mile to the S. E. from Gunong Say. It is named on the Admiralty Charts \"Hamilton Hill,\" possibly after some naval man who had been surveying in Brunei. The height of Gunong Say is 760 feet.\n\nThey are both conspicuous landmarks and can be seen by steamers plying between Singapore and Labuan.\nContents of Journal\nNos. 52\u201477\n\n(An Index to Nos. 1\u201450 was published in Journal No. 51)\n\nA History of Santubong, by Harold H.

Funkhouser.\n\n(Contribution from the Entomological Laboratory of Cornell University.)\n\nThrough the courtesy of Professor C. F. Baker, Dean of the College of Agriculture at Los Banos, Philippine Islands, I have been permitted to study a very interesting series of insects of the family Membracidae collected during the Summer of 1917 at Singapore and the Island of Penang.\n\nThe collection contains twelve new species and records of a number of species of Walker, Distant, Melichar and Bierman which form a valuable addition to our knowledge of the distribution of the Indian homopterous fauna.\n\nAll of the species listed were collected by Professor Baker.\n\n1. Xiphistes orientalis, sp. nov.\n\nUniform reddish-brown; thick bodied; horns heavy and blunt; tegmina opaque; scutellum largely exposed.\n\nHead dark brown with faint median ferruginous line, rugous, closely and finely punctate, sparingly pubescent with brownish hairs; eyes large, prominent, grayish-white; ocelli prominent, pearly, about equidistant from each other and from the eyes and situated on a line drawn through centers of eyes; clypeus much longer than wide, extending for more than half its length below inferior margin of face, pubescent, tip rounded.\n\nProthorax black-brown, rough, very pubescent with short, reddish-brown hairs which almost entirely conceal the weak punctuation; humeral angles very large, heavy, triangular and blunt, projecting directly laterad; suprahumeral horns short, very stout, about as long as their width at base and about as far apart at their bases as the basal width of one horn, projecting upward, outward and slightly forward, upper surfaces very rough and nodulose with irregular carinae, tips blunt, rounded and somewhat deflexed; median carina strongly percurrent; posterior process long, almost straight, slightly deflexed at tip, strongly centrally carinate, base laterally carinate on each side, tip gradually acute and extending about half way between internal angles and tips of tegmina, base only lightly touching scutellum; scutellum plainly visible on each side.\nSides of thorax thickly pubescent with reddish hairs. Tooth of prothorax very prominent; that of mesothorax very weak.\n\nTegmina opaque, reddish-brown, slightly pubescent and punctate at base, veins prominent, tip acute, marginal border very narrow or lacking. Hind wings with four apical areas.\n\nUndersurface of body very dark brown, almost black. Ovipositor black. Ventral surface of abdomen somewhat pubescent with whitish tomentose patches at base.\n\nLegs dark brown; femora swollen and smooth; tibiae triangular and finely spined; tarsi ferruginous.\n\nLength 8 mm.; width between extremities of suprahumeral horns 4 mm.\n\nType: female (Baker's duplicate No. 9084).\n\nLocality: Singapore.\n\n2.

Scutellum entirely exposed, triangular, as long as its width at base; base thickly covered with white tomentose pubescence; tip rounded in general outline, notched with the point on each side of notch extended into a fine tooth.\n\nTegmina long, narrow, smoky-hyaline, much wrinkled; base white and punctate; costal margins ferruginous; veins prominent, somewhat hairy; tips rounded, extending well beyond extremity of abdomen.\n\nSides and undersurface of the thorax white tomentose; undersurface of abdomen brown.\n\nLegs reddish-brown, slender, hairy; tarsi flavous.\n\nLength 7 mm.; width between tips of suprathumerals 4 mm.\n\nType: female (Baker's duplicate No. 9086).\n\nLocality: Island of Penang.\n\n8. Anchoonoides variegatus, sp. nov.\n\nGolden brown with white tomentose stripes; tegmina smoky-hyaline with broad, clear band across centers and with bases brown; posterior process strongly sinuate with two elevations behind suprathumeral horns.\n\nHead wider than long, rugose, brown with white tomentose patches, finely and closely punctate, densely pubescent; base sinuate; eyes brown, reflexed; ocelli prominent, brown, farther from each other than from the eyes and situated above a line passing through centers of eyes; clypeus much longer than wide, sublobate, extending for more than two-thirds its length below the inferior margin of the face, densely white pubescent, tip rounded; inferior margins of genae produced in blunt angles; antennae prominent.\n\nProthorax brown, finely punctate, sparingly pubescent; metopidium somewhat nodulate; four white tomentose lines on cephalic prothorax, one arising above each eye, extending dorsomesad to meet the line from the other side at the median carina at a point about even with the bases of the suprathumeral horns; another originating beneath each humeral angle and extending upward between the suprathumeral horns and backward to base of posterior process; a narrower line extending along lateral margin of pronotum from beneath the suprathumeral horn to base of posterior process. Humeral angles prominent, blunt, triangular, extending outward about half as far as the suprathumeral horns. Suprathumeral horns heavy, sinuate, extending outward and a little upward, upper middle portion much elevated and nodulate, tips obliquely truncate with posterior angle produced. Median carina strongly percurrent. Posterior process heavy, nodulate, thrown upward in two strong loops, one above the scutellum and one above the internal angles of the tegmina, the anterior elevation about twice as high as the\nposterior; tip extending almost as far as the end of the abdomen but not reaching the extremities of the tegmina. The entire dorsal outline as seen from the side showing three elevations, one between the suprathumeral horns, one above the scutellum and one above the internal angles of the tegmina.

Gibbs.\n\nIn 1913, in the course of Phytogeographical work at about 7 to 8,000 ft. in the Arfak Mountains, of Dutch N. W. New Guinea, my carriers, both men and women, were drawn chiefly from the Warlap and Stari, small \"campongs\" on the S. W. coast of Geelvink Bay.\n\nWhile on the March these people collected the leaves of Laportea or Fleurya, sp., tying them neatly into bundles. As soon as climbing began they constantly rubbed these leaves on forearms and legs to the knees with great zest and evident enjoyment. On another occasion during the ascent, the grandson of the \"Korano\" or headman of Warlap, a most active and intelligent young fellow, stood stoically while the skin of his calves was sliced in spirals, deep enough to let blood flow freely from each cut. This operation was performed by the Malay, or rather Timorese, sergeant (in charge of the escort kindly provided by the Dutch authorities) who thoughtfully explained beforehand what was about to happen. Beyond the fact that it was a peculiarity of the \"Papuas\" to suffer in the head, I unfortunately did not gather the further drift of his remarks.\n\nOn the return journey, a young woman of Stari was brought up as \"sakit prut\" and given a good dose of Glauber's Salts. She appeared next morning to thank me for her recovery\u2014her forearms and legs to the knees thickly smeared with faeces and accompanied by several companions similarly treated.\n\nIt would be interesting if readers of the \"Asiatic Journal\" could parallel similar instances amongst other native tribes, or possibly those ethnologically conversant with the customs of primitive peoples may be able to elucidate these examples.\n\nAppendix I.\n\nI have read with interest Miss Gibbs' note on \"Some peculiar Papuan Customs\" and amongst them I have noticed a Papuan Custom which corresponds with much similarity to a custom of the Arawaks and Macusi Indians of British Guiana.\n\nDuring several surveying journeys in that Colony, I have noticed that when on long journeys especially if carrying heavy baggage, the natives have often rubbed themselves with a kind of\nnettle (Kamari ?) in order they said to stimulate themselves, and give quicker action to the blood, and the same after a time gives them a most soothing effect, which enables them to carry on their work.\n\nIt is also done I understand for anyone suffering from backache, when the back is beaten with the nettle, until it sometimes bleeds.\n\nW. R. Humphreys, F.R.G.S.,\nLieut. R. F. A.\n\nAppendix II.\n\nGiraldus Cambrensis states that the Roman nettle *Urtica pilulifera* was introduced into Great Britain by the Romans under Julius Caesar. The soldiers brought some seed of it and sowed it at Romney for their use to rub and chafe their limbs when through extreme cold they should be stiff and benumbed, being told before they came from home that the climate of Britain was so cold that it was not to be endured without some friction to warm their blood. I cannot get any confirmation of this from any of the Greek and Latin authors, but it seems to be a parallel to the accounts of Miss Gibbs and Lieut. Humphreys, as to the use of urtication for relieving chill and stiffness in the limbs.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\nHoseanthus Merrill, n. gen.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley, F.R.S., C.M.G.\n\nIn Journal No. 76, p. 114, Mr. Merrill gives as a New Genus Hoseanthus for my genus Hosea (Verbenaceae) on the ground that Dennstedt had previously published a genus Hosea. This is quite unnecessary additional synonym. Dennstedt got hold of a copy of Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus a work in several volumes of rather poor drawings of South Indian plants, and published a Schluessel zum Hortus Indicus Malabaricus in 1818.\n\nIn cases where the drawing was so poor as to be not identifiable he gave it a new generic and specific name, but as no description whatever was published by him or even any suggestion as to the order of the plant these names rank as nomina nuda and are valueless. One of these plants was apparently a shrub which was so ill done that it is impossible to certainly identify it and to this sketch Dennstedt gave the name in his list of Hosea. Whatever the picture was intended to represent, it has doubtless long ere this received a properly accredited name and description, but I cannot find that any one has ever identified it and I do not know what it is meant for. Where the drawings in this work have been later identified Dennstedt's name has sometimes been retained, though as he did not ever describe one of them, the names were mere nomina nuda and might have been dropped. This being the case it is quite unnecessary to add to the ever increasing synonyms by substituting Hoseanthus for Hosea to retain the latter name for a plant which no one has ever identified and probably never will identify, and which the author Dennstedt never saw in his life nor I expect, would have recognized if he did see it. Dennstedt was evidently not so much a botanist as a compiler of lists; after publishing a Flora of Weimar in Germany he published about 4 compilations of lists of cultivated plants and the above mentioned Schluessel, and nothing else. One cannot protest too strongly against the unnecessary increase of synonyms for plants. Scientifically it has no value at all and only adds to confusion, and bulk of literature for no useful purpose.\nThe Bornean Species of Eugenia, Schefflera, and Saurauia, represented in the Singapore Herbarium.\n\nBy E. D. Merrill.\n\nBureau of Science, Manila, P. I.\n\nThrough the kindness of Mr. I. H. Burkill, Director of the Botanic Garden, Singapore, I was recently loaned the Bornean material of the genera Eugenia, Schefflera, and Saurauia in the herbarium of that institution for study. My original request for this material was prompted chiefly by the idea that through a study of it I would be able specifically to determine a number of specimens of these three genera in the herbarium of the Bureau of Science which were inadequate or incomplete. On receiving the material, however, I found that although most of it comes from Sarawak, from the same general regions whence I have received most of my own Bornean material, comparatively few of the specimens match unidentified material in the herbarium of the Bureau of Science, and a number of sheets represent species entirely different from any of the named species in the latter herbarium. This fact impresses me with the belief that as yet the extant Bornean botanical material represents a relatively small part of the species that actually occur in Borneo, and that intensive field work in botany will add several thousand species to the list of those already recorded from this relatively little known Island. The results of my study of the Singapore material of the three genera under discussion are given below.\n\nEugenia, Linnaeus.\n\nAn examination of the Bornean material representing this genus in the Singapore herbarium has induced me to propose and describe six new species, and to enumerate the specimens representing other species so far as I have been able to identify them. In addition to the twenty-seven species listed below at least eleven others are represented, but in most cases the material is scarcely sufficient to determine whether or not they represent described forms, and if described to which species they appertain. There are now about eighty-five species of the genus credited to Borneo; but the list will certainly be greatly extended. There are, in addition to the eleven Bornean species in the Singapore herbarium\nthat I cannot specifically determine, twenty others represented in the herbarium of the Bureau of Science by collections which I have not as yet found expedient to determine except generically; more than one-half of the known Bornean species are represented by named specimens in the latter herbarium.\n\n**Eugenia kuchingensis**, Merr. in J., S.

It differs radically from Eugenia baramensis, Merr., another Bornean species that has very short, few-flowered cymes not only in its vegetative characters but also in its pale, terete, not 4-angled branches and branchlets.\n\nSchefflera, Forster.\n\nSix species of this genus were definitely known from Borneo, and an examination of the material in the Singapore herbarium has enabled me to increase the list to ten. Of the previously described species I was able to match but two in the Singapore herbarium, these being Schefflera tetrandra, Merr., represented by Ridley 12251 from Matang, and Haviland s.n. from Kuching, and S. borneensis, Merr., represented by a Kuching specimen probably collected by Haviland. There are four additional species in the Singapore herbarium, and five in the Bureau of Science herbarium, making a total of nineteen Bornean species; however, as the material representing these additional nine species is decidedly inadequate in each case, I do not consider it advisable to attempt to carry the classification beyond the genus at the present time.\n\nSchefflera borneensis, sp. nov.\n\nArbor parva, inflorescentiis perspicue brunneo-furfuraceis: foliis longe petiolatis, 8- vel 10-foliolatis, foliolis oblongis, integris, coriaceis, usque ad 26 cm. longis, breviter acuminatis, basi obtusis vel acutis, nervis turinque circiter 12, utrinque cum reticulis distinctis: inflorescentiis ut videtur terminalibus, ramis primariis numerosis, confertis, racemose dispositis, usque ad 20 cm. longis: umbellis numerosis, tenuiter pedunculatis, 15\u201420-floris: floribus parvis, 5-meris: petalis extus parceissime et minutissime furfuraceis, ovatis, circiter 2 mm. longis: fructibus circiter 4 mm. longis, subellipsoideis, acute 5-angulatis, sulcatis.\n\nA small tree, glabrous except the conspicuously brown-furfuraceous inflorescences.

H. Burkill.\n\nIn Britten and Boulger's useful Biographical Index of British and Irish Botanists (London, 1893) the following is the entry regarding James Motley, its abbreviations expanded for clearness:\n\nMotley, James, (fl. 1847-55). Murdered in Borneo by Mohammedan settlers. Of Aberafon, Glamorganshire, and afterwards of Labuan. Contrib.[utor] to Phyt.[ologist] ii. (1847) and Journ.[al of] Bot.[any], 1847 and [of] Carmarthen plants to Top.[ographical] Bot.[any], (551). Collected in Malaya, 1852-55. [Published] \"Contrib.[utions] to [the] Nat.[ural] Hist.[ory] of Labuan\" (with L. L. Dillwyn), 1855. Plants [collected by him are] at Kew. [Vide] Linn.[ean Society's] Trans.[actions], xxiii, 157; R.[oyal] S.[ociety's] C.[atalogue], iv, 495. [Commemorated in] Barclaya Motleyi, Hook, f.\n\nThe statement that he was murdered by Mohammedan settlers is derived from the Transactions of the Linnean Society, loc. cit., where Sir Joseph Hooker in dedicating to him the jungle water-lily, Barclaya Motleyi, states that the examination of it was almost the last botanical work that he did. The implication that the murder was done in 1855 arises from want of evidence as to the date. But the events which led up to his death are recorded in the Singapore Free Press for 1859; and as apparently there appears to be only one file of the paper existing, it seems desirable to recall them. The word \"settlers\" disappears from the story.\n\nJames Motley was a Civil Engineer, who about 1852 went to Labuan in connection with coal-mining there, and became later the Superintendent of the coal-mining operations of a private company upon a concession in the territory of the Sultan of Banjermassin. This concession was along the Sungei Banyu Irang at two or three days journey to the south of Banjermassin town. There he was in 1859. In the very commencement of that year sinister whispers of sedition brewing in Banjermassin reached the Dutch Government in Batavia; but so badly was the Government served by their Resident at the Sultan's court that they were told in answer to their immediate enquiries that it was nothing. It was in fact a court-intrigue to replace the ruler by his brother, and, in doing so, to overthrow Dutch authority by which the reigning\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 79.\nSultan was maintained. The plotters played upon religious fanaticism, producing for their purpose a man who claimed to have come from heaven, and instigated the Dyaks to rise. They rose on April 28th,\u00a7 and attacked the mines at Pengaron which is on the east of Banjermassin, about as remote from it as the Sungei Banyu Irang is to the south. Though they were beaten off, they succeeded in arresting the messenger sent to Banjermassin to report, and killed him.\n\nThree days later \u00a7 they attacked Motley's mines, killing Motley at a place called Bangkal,\u2020 and Motley's wife and three children at a place called Kalangan;\u2020 where also they murdered the rest of the company's staff, their wives and children, all except a few infants. They murdered also about the same date in the same region a Dutch political officer and several missionaries. They all but got possession of the country, so that the fighting extended to Banjermassin itself, and it was not for two years that there was quiet again.\n\n\u00a7Singapore Free Press of 2nd.

The seedling of *Shorea robusta*, Roxb., and the conditions under which it grows into pure forests.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nIn this *Journal*, 1917, pp. 163\u2014167, outline figures of the seedlings of some Malayan Shores were given; and the remark was made that the Indian *Shorea robusta*, well known as *Sal*. differs from them in the elongation of the stalks of its cotyledons. It is now possible to illustrate the remark by an outline figure of the seedling of *Shorea robusta* at the same stage as the Malayan species: and if the reader, after glancing at it, will turn back to the pages named, he will see at once how wide is this difference.\n\nIn my material of *S. robusta* the stalks of the cotyledons attained 6 cm. in length; whereas those of the Malayan species figured before never exceeded 1 cm.\n\nI owe the material to the kindness of Mr. R. S. Hole of the Indian Forest Service, Botanist at the Imperial Forest Research Institute, Dehra Dun.\n\n*Shorea robusta* is one of the most important of Indian Forest trees: for instance, Pearson estimated in 1913 that the annual production exceeded eight million cubic feet (*Economic Value of Shorea robusta*, *Indian Forest Memoirs*, ii. part 3, 1913, p. 70); and while the Government conserves large forests of it, there are also considerable areas privately owned and worked. The distribution of the Government forests may be gathered easily from Caccia\u2019s paper entitled \u201cDevelopment of Sal\u201d in the *Indian Forest Records*, vol. 1, part 2, 1908, p. 85, to which a map is appended. The privately owned forests lie in the same regions, which may be summarised thus:\n\n(i) a belt, extending along the base of the Himalaya, and up its slopes to about 4000 feet (in favoured localities somewhat higher) between the Kangra valley on the west and the Darrang district in Assam on the east.\n\n(ii) the country east of the Bengal plains comprised in the Garo, Khasi and Jaintea hills, and the hilly district of Nowgong to the north.\n\n*Jour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc.*, No. 79.\n(iii) the hills south west of the Bengal plains, westward to Pachmarhi, and southward into the Circars, as far as Jeypur.\n\nIn a general way these three areas are together the rim of the cup into which the monsoon current from the Bay of Bengal pours its moist air from May to September, with precipitations from June. At the extreme western points the average annual rainfall is reduced to below 40 inches. In other places the precipitation is upward of five times as much. On the hills and also to some extent in the plains, Sal withstands frost. Everywhere it demands good drainage.\n\nThe Sal tree flowers in March or April when the dry season is on, changing its leaves rapidly just previously or at the same time; and this in every year: but a good seed crop is only yielded about once in three years. McIntyre (Notes on Sal in Bengal, Forest Pamphlets Series, 1909, p. 2) attributes to unfavourable weather the failure to yield annually: but this is a point which demands investigation. The seeds are ripe in the commencement of the rains, and are ready for immediate growth; in fact they often germinate on the tree (vide Brandis, Forest Flora of the North-west and Central India, 1874, p. 27, and also earlier writers): if drought follows their fall to the ground, they are likely to die.\nThey are starchy (about 60 per cent of starch on dry weight); but they fail as a food on account of tannins present to the extent of 8 per cent. These tannins act on man as poisons causing indigestion, constipation and ultimately death (see Reinherz, in *The Agricultural Ledger*, 1904, No. 5, pp. 33\u201436). It is obvious that they serve to protect the seed, but not altogether;* for many animals feed on them\u2020: and, as with all vegetation, there are specialised insect-enemies.\u2021\n\nThe seeds of the Malayan Shoreas seem very similar in being relatively rich in tannins; and to have similar enemies.\n\nThe parent Sal tree many attain 20\u201425 feet in girth, but it is recorded that it may be a seed-bearer with as little girth as 7\u00bd inches (Troup in *Forest Bulletins*, New Series, No. 8, 1912). Troup was unable to show any laws of variation relating to the viability of seed got from trees of different sizes, of different degrees of soundness, of different localities, or of seed ripened in the beginning, middle or end of the seed-time, but he suspected a possible law in regard to the last, the middle of the season being best. Haines (*A Forest Flora of Chota Nagpur*, 1910, p. 178), has said that the earliest are generally bad.\n\nThere is no albumen around the embryo plant in the seed, but all its store of food is in its gorged bilobed cotyledons. It has been shown for *S. leprosula* (this *Journal*, 1917, p. 161) how the lobes of the cotyledons, enwrapping in their growth the placentae and the sterile cells of the ovary, push themselves into the apex of the fruit. In *S. robusta* the two lobes of the inner cotyledon alone attain it, shutting out the outer, as suggested in the illustration above.\n\nThe seeds, upon falling to the ground, thrust the radicle to the soil chiefly by the growth of the stalks of the cotyledons, the cotyledons themselves remaining loosely apposed, and scarcely functioning as assimilatory organs. Herein is a great divergence from what is to be found in those Malayan Shoreas that are known to me, a divergence which carries *S. robusta* to a position in the order close to the genus *Dipterocarpus*; for the cotyledons in *Dipterocarpus* remain imprisoned within the wall of the fruit, do not assimilate, and as the young plant grows are depleted of their food through their stalks which elongate, although not exactly to plant the radicle as those of *S. robusta*, but accommodatingly to the elongation of the hypocotyl.\n\n---\n\n* Tannins are present also in the bark of the Sal tree to the extent of 8\u201410 per cent (vide Pearson, Economic value of *Shorea robusta*, in *Indian Forest Memoirs*, ii. part 3, 1913).\n\n\u2020 In Mr. Hole's experiments porcupines were troublesome (*Indian Forest Records*, v, part 4, 1916, p. 52).\n\n\u2021 E. B. Stebbing describes the Indian insect enemies of *Shorea robusta* in a paper entitled *some Assam Sal insect pests*, Forest Bulletin Series, 1907.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 79.\nThis relationship of *S. robusta* to the genus *Dipterocarpus* finds confirmation in the anatomy as determined by Heim. Heim, (*Recherches sur les Dipterocarpac\u00e9es*, Paris, 1890, p. 40), having divided *Shorea* into nine sections, and having put *S. robusta* into the first of them, called *Eu-Shorea*, wrote of it, \"This section seems to make connection with the genus *Dipterocarpus* especially by reason of the distribution of its vascular bundles in the leaf-stalk, and in the number of resin canals; but in the shape of the stamens it diverges more than do other sections such as *Antho-Shorea*.\"\n\nUnfortunately of Heim's Eu-Shoreas there are many species yet to study.\n\n*S. robusta* at its best, where the drainage is excellent and the soil is deep, makes pure forests, of a beautiful dark green, and often with the ground coated by seedlings struggling up under the parent trees. Hole (*Indian Forest Records*, v., part 4, p. 52) has found that the seedlings will grow healthily under an artificial shade which reduces the light to .015, demonstrating so how well the species is able to tolerate, when young, the deep shade those forests, wherein it asserts itself continuously against other trees. This power of making pure forests is possessed by some other Dipterocarps; *Dipterocarpus* itself possesses it, and *Dryobalanops Camphora*, and *Shorea assamica*, none in competition against another, but each in its own particular geographic region:\u2014*S. robusta* round the rim of the Bengal plains, *S. assamica* in Upper Assam, *Dipterocarpus* chiefly through Burma, Siam and Indo-China, and *Dryobalanops* in Sumatra, Borneo and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nSome observers have written of the success of *Shorea robusta* as connected with forest fires. Gamble pointed out that it drops its seeds after the season of fires is over, and shares the profit got thereby in its less pure forests with *Stereospermum chelonoides*\u2014a rather constant companion which sheds its seeds at the same time. Brandis (*Forest Flora* XIII, p. 53) remarked that the reproduction of Sal may be materially increased by the circumstance that the seed falls after the fires have passed. Many foresters, the last Troup (*Indian Forester*, 1916, p. 57), have pointed out that if fire is withheld the coating of dead leaves on the forest floor prevents the sprouting seeds from sending their roots down, and betrays them by drying rapidly when a dry spell comes. Others have pointed to the way in which a coating of grasses and other herbs may hold the seed from off the ground by its wings, so that it germinates in the air, to be dried up soon: and that as these leaves and grasses are destroyed by the fires, a way is thereby prepared for the seed.\n\nHaines (*Indian Forester*, 1917, p. 311) has stated that fires are advantageous in another direction, namely that they diminish the abundance in the forests of the fungi which attack Sal.\nBut if the fires be repeated too soon any occasional advantage is lost*. And after all what is the advantage where conditions are favourable to Sal, for there considerably over ninety-nine per cent of the seeds which fall must fail for want of room.\n\nIt cannot be that the liability of Sal or Dipterocarpus forests to fires assists at all in maintaining pure forest other than perhaps as Haines suggests in destroying fungi. So much is this recognised that every Indian forester of experience advocates fire protection, as a principle. But fire applied not more frequently than, say, triennially beyond the edge of pure forest may assist the Sal or Dipterocarpus in extending by clearing the way for the seed and damaging the competitors. Unfortunately forest fires where likely to occur, are annual. And under this view, the failure of the Malayan Shoreas to make pure forests is scarcely to be ascribed to their freedom from them.\n\nIt is on deep open soils that Sal makes the pure forests\u2014soils such as happen to be peculiarly well developed by rapid rivers from out of the rocks of the Himalaya, soils where the water may sink in dry periods in such a way\u2020 as to injure many plants which compete elsewhere. Sal finds on these soils the combination of yet unanalysed conditions ideal to it: and obviously it has a peculiar physiological adaptation to their nature to which its success may be ascribed. This physiological adaptation it shares somewhat with Shorea assamica: for Shorea assamica makes its pure forests on just the same kinds of soil.\n\nSal seedlings have a wonderful power of replacing the primary stem if it be lost, even right from the axils of the cotyledons. So far I have seen nothing like it in the Malayan Shoreas. Not once only can the seedling make good the leader, but it may renew it again and again through some years. Hole has illustrated this process in three places (Indian Forest Records, v, part 4, 1916, plate 1; Indian Forester, 1916, plate 23, p. 336; and Agricultural Journal of India, Indian Science Congress Number, 1916, plate 1.)\n\nThis loss of the leader is usually caused by something which is not a forest fire, though forest fires may of course cause it; and in at least ninety per cent of cases it comes from some underground influence acting through the root. Hole finds that the mixing with the soil of leaves, especially of Sal leaves, increases it, and he suggests that a toxic body is produced in the process of their decomposition directly or indirectly. If this be so, then light forest fires by removing the leaves on the forest floor may do good.\n\n*For the destruction of the Sal forests at the foot of the Himalaya between the rivers Gandak and Teesta, by repeated firing, see my note in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1916, p. 267.\n\n\u2020Cf. Milward\u2019s statement (Indian Forester, xxviii, 1803, p. 411) that under excellent Sal in Oudh the water may be 40 feet down.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 79.\nThis dying back of Sal seedlings is most intense in the rains; the seedling in appearance dies back exactly as it does also from drought, as if the plethora of water at the roots works in the same way as its want. But Sal seedlings can be grown in water cultures, and therefore contact with water itself has nothing to do with it. It would rather seem to be something shut out from or brought to the roots (Hole's toxic body for instance) by the water. Death can be caused in pots without the neighbourhood of other plants, and therefore by no toxic excretion of another plant (Hole in *Indian Forester*, 1916, p. 337). The Malayan Shoreas too die in wet periods, as far as I have observed, but there is this difference that Sal dies back only, whereas they die out. Herein is a difference between the two, perhaps connected with the greater success of the Sal (within its area),\u2014a difference which demands investigation.\n\nFor the purpose in hand, namely to form a sound classification of the order to which these trees belong, two facts may be useful, (i) that the Indian species *S. robusta* and *S. obtusa*, are more able to make pure forests than any of our many Malayan Shoreas, and (ii) that *S. robusta*, at any rate, is in its seedling more similar to the genus *Dipterocarpus* which also forms pure forests, than are the Malay Shoreas, *S. leprosula*, Miq., *S. rigida*, Brandis, *S. macroptera*, Dyer, *S. bracteolata*, Dyer, and *S. gibbosa*, Brandis. The pure forests are not the creation of man through firing: but the mixed forests may carry his impress.\nA new Dendrobium, D. gracilipes, from the Rhio Archipelago.\n\nBy I. H.

It is much more slender than either, and indeed is a really graceful little orchid. From *D. longipes* it differs also in its narrow petals and the straighter side to the lateral lobes of the labellum. These lateral lobes are folded upwards so as to make the walls of the rectangular tunnel into which insects are invited that they may fertilise the flowers. The mid lobe of the labellum is very much as in *D. longipes* (vide Hooker's *Icones plantarum*, plate 2617): its bright yellow centre set off by the purple at its back on the side lobes and the reddish brown in the back under the column. The rest of the flower is ivory white. The long slender ovaries are as in *D. longipes*, and as in *D. macropodum*.\n\nOn the whole the flower superficially suggests a *Coelogyne*.\nThe Cannibal King in the \"Kedah Annals.\"\n\nBy C. O. Blagden.\n\nThe story of the cannibal king on pp. 1-7 of the \"Hikayat Marong Mahawangsa\" (J. R. A. S., N. B., No. 72, May, 1916), differs a good deal in setting and incident from the similar tale in Number 537 of Fausb\u00f6ll's series of the \"Maha-Sutasoma-Jataka\" (vol. V, p. 246 seq. of the translation by Francis in Cowell's edition); but these two tales have so many points of agreement that it is difficult to suppose they are unconnected. I shall mention a few of the chief differences, as they occur in the course of the narrative; but my main purpose will be to draw attention to points of resemblance.\n\nThe openings differ. In the Indian story the king of Benares develops cannibal propensities in accordance with Buddhist ideas of transmigration, because in a previous existence he has been a Yakkha or ogre; and he has occasion first to taste human flesh, because one day a dog steals his plate of meat and the king's cook (a man) dishes up instead a portion of flesh cut from a fresh corpse in the cemetery.\n\nIn the Malay story, the cannibal king of Kedah is the son of an ogress or Gergasi; and he first tastes human blood, when one day his cook, a woman, cutting her finger by accident lets the blood drip into a vegetable curry and there is no time to prepare another dish.\n\nIncidentally one may surmise that the detail of the \"fresh corpse\" in the Indian version is an instance of the old Buddhist custom (similar to the Parsi habit) of exposing corpses to be eaten by birds of prey; and one may compare Groeneveldt's \"Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca,\" s.v. Tun-Sun, in \"Essays Relating to Indo-China, Second Series,\" vol. I, p. 240, where however the dying are so exposed.\n\nAfter the opening the two stories agree in many details. In both, the king takes great pleasure in his horrid meal, even before he is aware of its ingredients. In both, the cook is threatened with death in default of confession as to the recip\u00e9! In both, the cook confesses, and the king, so far from being shocked, orders more of the gruesome fare, battening first on prisoners from the gaol and later kidnapping the bodies of innocent people to supply the royal table; until at last there is uproar in the realm.\n\nIn the Indian tale the cook is caught taking flesh from the body of a woman he has just killed; in the Malay, the king is attacked by a bravo and a great fight ensues. In both tales, the king's\nministers, moved by popular clamour, warn their master; and he rejecting the warning is expelled from his country, peaceably in the Indian version and taking his sword and cook with him, ignominiously in the Malay story after a desperate onslaught on the palace, whence he escapes by a private door.\n\nIn the Indian story, the king after a number of adventures in the jungle is converted from cannibalism by Sutasoma, an incarnation of the Buddha in a previous existence\u2014for the \"Jatakas\" purport to be stories of the Buddha's earlier births: he is brought to Benares a changed man, and is welcomed by the son who reigns in his stead. In the Kedah version, the king mates with a girl of good family in a remote part of the country and, after once more escaping his enraged pursuers, is lost sight of; but the son of that union is restored to reign in the capital by virtue of the magical sagacity of an elephant in detecting the royal infant and by virtue of the king of Siam's warrant.\n\nWhen it is remembered that in Buddhist countries the \"Jatakas\" are known not only to the literate but in popular folk-lore, it becomes reasonable to infer that the Kedah tale has been borrowed from a Siamese source. Man-eating ogres are usual enough; but in the two tales considered, coincidence of small detail seems to demand explanation more particular than the common uniformity of the human mind in the invention of folk-tales.\n\nFor a parallel in Sinhalese legendary history those interested may consult p. 234 of my \"Catalogue of European Manuscripts in the India Office Library, vol. I, part I.\"\nThe Hadramaut Saiyids of Perak and Siak.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nOn pp. 2-5 of Law Part II, The Ninety-Nine Laws of Perak, in Papers on Malay Subjects, published by the F. M. S. Govt., Mr. R. J. Wilkinson pointed out the great influence a certain Sayid family exercised on the history of Perak in the XVIIth century. The family acquired the highest state offices, those of Orang Kaya Besar and of Mant\u00e9ri, and one of its members acted even as Benda-hara. Scions of this Sayid house were sought for eagerly in marriage and married into the families of all the greater Perak chiefs. One married the sister of Sultan Iskandar,\u2014Marhum Kahar (whose reign is described in the Misa\u2019 Melayu) and was the father of a Perak Sultan. Another married a daughter of the raja of Siak and from their union were descended the rulers of Siak. Several were accounted saints.\n\nHow came this family to win such prestige and power?\n\nTheir genealogical tree copied by a former mufti of Perak, Raja Haji Yahya who in his youth gave Sir William Maxwell some Perak royal genealogies (J. R. A. S., S. B. XIV, p. 305) explains the matter. They were of the great house of Ahmad bin Esa al-Mohajir, the founder of the Sayid house of Hadramaut, which considers its nobility better established than that of all the other descendants of the Prophet\u2019s daughter, and refuses the hands of its daughters, even its half-caste daughters to Sherifs and Sayids come from other places. Van den Berg\u2019s \u201cHadramaut and the Arab colonies in the Indian Archipelago\u201d gives the following particulars of this family: I quote from Sealy\u2019s translation (Bombay, 1887).\n\n\u201cThe founder of the Sayids of Hadramaut is a certain Ahmad bin Isa, surnamed al-Mohajir who, according to tradition, established himself in the country about ten centuries ago. He was a native of Bassora. His genealogy is as follows: bin Esa bin Muhammad an-Nakib bin Ali al-Oraidthi bin Ja\u2019far as-Sadik bin Muhammad al-Bakir bin Ali Zainu\u2019l-abidin bin al-Husain. To distinguish themselves from other Sayids those of Hadramaut call themselves al-Alawiyin descendants of \u2019Alawi, grandson of Ahmad bin Esa. Seven generations after Ahmad bin Esa the genealogical tree of the Sayids branches off with the two sons of Muhammad surnamed Sahib a\u2019r-Robat. After this division, we see the genealogical tree of the Sayid divide itself more and more into separate families. I will give the names of the families so far as they exist in our days and their descent is generally acknowledged authentic:\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A.

In the same way that of Ba\u02besh-Shaiban exists in Java and that of al-Kadri at Pontianak.\u201d\n\nBelow I give the leading names in the Perak genealogical tree.\n\nR. A.

Sayid Husain al-Faradz bin Jamal-al-ail is reputed to have been the religious teacher of the first Sultan of Perak. (\"Notes and Queries, R. A. S., S. B., No. 3, (1886), p. 70). He is recorded as having had a brother Sayid Yusuf and a sister Siti Kepayan, but that is all we hear of them.

No. 2 (1885), p. 47:\nAlso Misa Melayu. Floruit, 1765 A.D.\nNew and Rare Malayan Plants\n\nSeries X.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley, C.M.G., F.R.S.\n\nDuring the continuation of my studies of the Malay Peninsula flora I continue to find a good many species which have not been described, or have been for various reasons confused with others. In this series which is a continuation of the preceding ones, it is noteworthy that there are no less than four species quite common in the country but which are nameless, these are Memecylon Wallichii, n. sp. confused with M. amplexicaule, Roxb. Morinda elliptica, n. sp. one of our very commonest trees, confused with M. citrifolia, L.; Fagraea gigantea, n. sp. confused with F. fragrans, Roxb. and F. speciosa, Bl. and Allomorphia malaccensis, n. sp. confused with A. exigua, Bl. In some cases the cause of the error was due to the badness of specimens sent home; often the commoner the species the more seldom is it collected, as the botanist is apt to think it has been frequently sent home and neglects to collect it. In other cases the mistake is due to Botanists not having sufficiently carefully compared the type specimens and the description. Thus both in the case of Memecylon and Allomorphia, the types or co-types are preserved and readily accessible and in good condition yet early botanists have confused with the original species totally different plants, and have been followed by later botanists to the present day.\n\nOther new species are due to more recent discoveries in our flora.\n\nSTERCULIACEAE.\n\nSterculia brachycarpa, n. sp.\n\nA tree 50-60 feet tall, stem 8-12 in. through. Leaves chartaceous, dull, deep green, elliptic or obovate-elliptic abruptly acuminate, base blunt or shortly narrowed, glabrous above except the red pubescent midrib, beneath midrib and nerves 9 pairs and reticulations distinctly elevate and covered with stellate hairs, red on the midrib, 6-11 in. long and 3.5-5.5 in. wide, petiole 1.5 to 2 in. long, hairy. Racemes 3-3.5 in. long, slender dense, dark red velvety. Pedicels 25 in. long, red, velvety. Sepals oblong lanceolate narrowed a little to tips, densely hairy 2 in. long. Andraeicum half as long glabrous, anthers 7. Female flowers not seen. Carpels 3-4 ovate shortly pointed 1.5-2 in. long and as wide, densely velvety red. Seed 2 to a carpel, oblong .75 in. long, black.\nSelangor, Sempang mines. (Ridley 15635). Perak, Batang Padang district 300 to 500 ft. (Kunstler 7972).\n\nThis has been confused with *S. rubiginosa*, Vent., but is very distinct in its much larger leaves, much longer petioles, broader sepals, and short, broad 2 seeded carpels. It is also much less hairy and the pedicels much shorter and the flowers are in a simple raceme.\n\n**MYRTACEAE.**\n\n*Eugenia formosa*, Wallich. In the Materials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula, King gives this species as occurring in Perak, the only specimens however, so labelled by him that I have seen are certainly the much smaller plant, *E. pseudo-formosa*.\n\n*E. formosa*, Wallich. is a big tree with axillary red flowers borne below the leaves on the branches while *pseudo-formosa* is a shrub or at most a small straggling tree with white terminal flowers, the venation of the leaves quite different and the thick white corky petiole is very characteristic. The very narrow-leaved form which grows in Penang, by Richmond pool is the *Jambosa lanceolata* of Miquel, it is also my *E. nemoricola* but is I think now only a form of *pseudo-formosa*.\n\nAn Eugenia I collected in Selangor at Klang (No. 10200) more nearly resembles Wallich's *formosa* than anything else I have seen from the Malay Peninsula, but as it differs from the type in many respects I prefer to leave it doubtful until further specimens of the plant should be obtained.\n\n**Eugenia limnoea**, n. sp.\n\nTree with red flaky bark. Leaves elliptic coriaceous, base very shortly narrowed, tip long, acuminate, blunt, nerves very fine and numerous distinctly raised beneath inarching close to the edge, 5.5 in. long, 2 in. wide, petiole .3-.4 in. long. Panicle terminal 2 in. long, 2.5 in. wide, dense, many flowered on a peduncle 1.5 in. long. Calyx campanulate with a slender pseudo-stalk .2 in. long and as wide; lobes short rounded. Petals free, orbicular glandular .1 in. long. Stamens .3 in. long.\n\nOpen low lying, damp country. Province Wellesley, Nibong Tebal (Ridley 12783) Krian (Ridley 9378). Perak (Scortechini). Penang, Batu Feringhi (Ridley 12576).\n\nThis plant has been identified as *E. densiflora*, Duthie by King and what appears to be identical is *E. oblongifolia* var. *robusta*, King, collected in Perak by Scortechini.\n\nIt has nothing to do with *E. oblongifolia*, Duthie. *E. limnoea* is allied to *E. densiflora* and appears to replace it in the northern part of the Peninsula. It differs in the flowers being only half as long, and the nerves, nervules and reticulations being very fine and close. The intra-marginal nerve lies close to the edge of the leaf, instead of a long way from it,\nwith a second intramarginal between it and the leaf-edge as in *E. densiflora* the base of the leaf is broader and more rounded and the leaves are generally more ovate. As in *E. densiflora* the midrib is deeply sunk above, prominent beneath, and the whole surface of the leaf beneath is pustular.\n\n**Eugenia pauper**, n. sp.\n\nA small tree, branches rather slender, bark light reddish. Leaves thinly coriaceous, punctate above, pustulate beneath, elliptic, abruptly cuspidate, base cuneate, nerves 10 to 12 pairs depressed above, elevate beneath inarching to form an intramarginal nerve .1 in. from the edge, midrib channelled above, elevate beneath 5.5 to 6 in. long 2.5 in. wide, petiole .4 in. long, slightly thickened, black. Cymes axillary solitary in each axil .5 to .75 in long with 2 or 3 flowers on the ends of the 2 or 3 branches. Bracts minute at the base of the flowers. Calyx cup-shaped, truncate, suddenly narrowed to a slender pseudo-stalk .1 in. long, pustular. Petals calyptrate.\n\nJohor, in Gunong Pulai and Gunong Pantai (*Ridley* 12175 and 4200).\n\nThis is nearest to *E. oblata*, Duthie which it exactly resembles in the inflorescence, but the venation and shape of leaves is quite different.\n\n**Eugenia cyrtophylloides**, n. sp.\n\nA tree with pale reddish bark. Leaves stiffly coriaceous, lanceolate, acute or cuspidate, base narrowed, decurrent on the petiole, black-dotted beneath, nerves very numerous, fine, visible above, very inconspicuous beneath; midrib strongly elevate, 3.5-4 in. long 1-1.5 in. wide, petiole .2 in. Panicle terminal 2 to 3 in. long, peduncle 1-2 in. long, branches 1 in. long terete, thick branchlets, 3 terminal on the branches, ending in 3 sessile flowers. Bracts caducous. Calyx .1 in. long gradually narrowed to a broad base, the lower part cylindric; lobes ovate, short. Corolla calyptrate. Stamens very short and few.\n\nPahang. Wray\u2019s Camp, Gunong Taban (*Ridley* 16274).\n\nThis belongs to the group of *E. punctulata*, with an urn-shaped calyx and calyptrate corolla and few stamens.\n\n**Eugenia Klossii**, n. sp.\n\nA tree. Branchlets terete, black. Leaves in distant pairs, elliptic, acuminate, acute, base cuneate, thinly coriaceous, nerves about 20 pairs, elevate beneath, secondary nerves nearly as conspicuous, inarching .1 from the edge, reticulations wide conspicuous beneath, all inconspicuous above 5.5 in. long 2.25 in. 2.5 in. wide, petiole .2 in. long. Panicles 1-2 terminal 3 in. long or less, branches few, short with 1 to 3 terminal\nflowers. Calyx broad, campanulate .2 in. across, truncate edge recurved, base abruptly narrowed to a slender pseudo stalk .3 in. long. Petals calyptrate. Stamens .4 in. long. Style .5 in. long.\n\nSelangor, Rantau Panjang, July, 1914 (C. B. Kloss).\n\nThis is perhaps most nearly allied to *E. inophylla*, Roxb. but the nerves of the leaves are fewer and the panicle shorter, laxer and fewer flowered.\n\n**Eugenia cordifoliata**, n. sp.\n\nBranches terete, pale coloured. Leaves elliptic with a short, blunt point, base narrowed, blunt, slightly cordate, membranous, drying blackish above, paler beneath, nerves about 18 pairs nearly invisible above, slightly elevate beneath inarching .1 in. from the edge, 4 in. long 1.5 in. wide, petiole short, thick .1 in. long. Panicle terminal lax, 6 in. long, peduncle 2 in. long, branches angled, the lowest 3 in. long, branchlets crowded at the tip with pear-shaped buds narrowed to a slender pseudo-stalk. Calyx lobes ovate.\n\nPerak; without locality (Scortechini).\n\nThis is one of the two quite distinct plants quoted and labelled by King as representing his *Eugenia Swettenhamiana*. The other species which as represented in Herb. Kew, (all I have seen) collected in Larut by Kunstler, No. 7590, is very poor specimen in bad condition, and does not appear to be an *Eugenia* at all. The description of *E. Swettenhamiana* however, applies better to this specimen than to Scortechini\u2019s plant which is only in young bud. This latter plant is very distinct from any species I have seen in the rounded, cordate almost peltate leaf-base. It may perhaps be allied to *E. densiflora* but more developed specimens are required before deciding on its affinities.\n\n**MELASTOMACEAE.**\n\n**Melastoma scabrum**, n. sp.\n\nShrub about 5 ft. tall, branchlets sparingly covered with small ovate lanceolate acuminate scales, very varied in size from minute irregular ones to lanceolate subulate ones, very short and appressed, on the leaves almost reduced to slight roughness, rather longer on the petiole. Leaves narrow, lanceolate, subacute, base rounded or shortly cuneate, above sabrid with short thornlike processes, nerves 5 with larger scales, 4-4.75 in. long, 1.25 to 1.50 in. wide; petiole .6 in. long. Flowers as big as those of *M. decemfidum*, pedicels .4 in. long. Calyx .4 in. long, campanulate, sparsely covered with lanceolate, acuminate scales, longest at the top, lobes linear acuminate with scales, long linear subulate outside.\nPetals glabrous 1.5 in. long, pale rose pink. Stamens half the length of the petals, unequal, long ones 1.2 in. long. Style rather stout 1 in. long, ovary with long bristle-like hairs on the top.\n\nKEDAH. Lankawi at Burau near Telayah Tujooh, April (Ridley 15813).\n\nOsbeckia perakensis, n. sp.\n\nShrub about 8 feet tall much branched, twigs angled, young parts, petioles, leaves above and the nerves beneath covered with stiff bristly hairs. Leaves elliptic to ovate blunt base, round nerves 5 elevate beneath 1.25 in. long, 75 in. wide, petiole .15 in. long. Flowers 3 to 5 in a terminal head sessile in the terminal pair of leaves, in fruit a short pedicel .1 in. long is developed. Calyx .4 in. long, ovoid eventually semi-oblong, entirely covered with short, stiff bristles and star-shaped whorls of bristles on a distinct pedicel, lobes lanceolate, acuminate, fringed and keeled with simple bristles about 2 in. long. Petals obovate 1 in. long, deep pink-rose. Stamens 10, filaments slender, anthers .3 in. long, shortly acuminate. Style long and stout. Capsule semi-oblong .4 in. long .3 in. through, densely covered with stellate-hairy processes.\n\nPERAK, Taiping Hills on Gunong Hijau at 5,500 ft., first obtained by Mrs. Bland, in 1905, later by J. W. Anderson.\n\nPerhaps nearest to O. buxifolia, Thw. of Ceylon.\n\nOXYSPOREAE.\n\nThe sorting out of the species of Oxysporeae of the Malay Peninsula into genera, is, it proves, a somewhat difficult task. I attempted it in vol. 57 of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, but in the further light of later discoveries and investigations I find a modification is necessary. The following are the genera as I now propose them:\n\nOxyspora, Woody, often tall shrubs with large stiff leaves and big terminal panicles of fairly large flowers. The stamens in the original species of De Candolle are 8 in number but of two forms four long and purple and four alternating shorter and yellow. In the Malay Peninsula we have only one species which exactly agrees with this viz. O. stellulata, King, a beautiful tree-like shrub with great panicles of light rose pink flowers. The other species which have the same habit and general structure have all the 8 stamens yellow and the two series almost or quite as long and similar. The capsule in the type species and in some others is long and funnel-shaped, but in O. microcarpa it is subglobose and small, and in O. collina short and cup-shaped. The following are our species:\u2014\nOxyspora stellaulta, King\n\n\" acutangula, King\n\" hirticalyx, Ridl. Allomorphia hirticalyx, Ridl.\n\" Curtisi, King\n\" macrophylla, Triana.

Soc.\n\n\" rosea, Ridl. Allomorphia rosea, Ridl. Trans. Linn.\nSoc. ii. iii. 301.\n\n\" hispida, Ridl.\n\nAllomorphia, Bl. includes the shrublets with small inconspicuous flowers and small elliptic fruits. I excluded from King's species A. Wrayi under the genus Campimia (a plant allied to Dreissena) in the paper above referred to, leaving the type species A. exigua, and A. alata, Scott. with A. porphyranthera, Ridl. A. exigua, Jack. Trans. Linn. Soc., xxviii, 74, a native of Penang. It is a low shrublet with white flowers and violet stamens, and is the A. exigua var. minor, King, but it is quite distinct from the common plant of the South of the Malay Peninsula, a shrub about 6-12 feet tall with greenish flowers in a large panicle. This plant has been confused with it by Clarke, Cogniaux, King, and in fact nearly all botanists since Jack's time. My Allomorphia capillaris seems to be a form of A. exigua, Bl. It is a native of Perak and the Dindings and differs from the Penang plant in the extremely slender, long branches of the panicle, and is perhaps better classed as a variety of A. exigua. The typical plant is confined to Penang where it grows on rocky spots near the waterfall. To this species belongs Wallich's 4048a of his Catalogue (there is no No. 4048 in the herbarium) but 4048b seems distinct in its rather larger flowers and quite round based ovate leaves. It was from Herb. Finlayson without locality. Many of Finlayson's plants are from Siam. I have never seen anything quite like it from Penang or elsewhere.\n\nA. porphyranthera, Ridl. Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Straits Br. 57, p. 39 from Ulu Temengoh resembles A. exigua, but the panicle is scurfy and the flowers larger. There remains now the commonest species of all, the exigua of the later botanists but not of Blume. King and Cogniaux give as a synonym Melastoma impuber, Roxb. Flor. Ind. ii, p. 405, but the description hardly fits this plant to which is also given the Molucceas as a habitat.\n\nIn Griffith's Notulae is a description of a Sonerila bullata which Cogniaux makes a species of Allomorphia under the name A. bullata. The description is very incomplete and though some parts of it would fit the common plant which he must have been familiar with and indeed collected, I do not think it can have been what he intended.\nI cannot find in fact that this common and conspicuous plant has ever received any name at all. I therefore propose for it the name *Allomorpha malaccensis* as it is particularly common in Malacca and give a description of it.\n\n**Allomorpha malaccensis**, n. sp.\n\nA tall plant, usually about 6 feet tall and often more with a slender, woody stem, glabrous all over except for a reddish (when dry) meal over the panicle and petioles. Leaves ovate, acuminate, dark green, edge entire, base very shortly cuneate, nerves 5 from base 3 very prominent and 2 outer ones very slender, the transverse nervules conspicuous, elevate, 10 in. long and 6 in. wide, petiole 3-4 inches long. Panicle 6 to 12 inches long and nearly as wide pyramidal, branches lax spreading subwhorled. Flowers umbelled on the ends of the branchlets about 10, or in distant pairs of umbels sessile on the main branches. Flowers small .2 in. long. Bracts lanceolate .1 in. long, caducous. Calyx funnel-shaped, short with 4 short, ovate lobes. Petals smaller, white or greenish. Stamens yellow .1 in. long, anthers acuminate, bases divaricate. Capsule .1 in. long, ovoid narrowed below the dilated calyx limb.\n\nMalacca, common in woods; Negri Sembilan, Tampin hill; Selangor, Rantau Panjang and Sungei Buloh; Perak, Gunong Kerbau at 4,000 ft. (Robinson). A form with leaves more lanceolate.\n\n*Allomorpha subsessilis*, Craib of Siam also belongs to this genus, but I should exclude *A. umbellulata*, Hook. fil. of Tenasserim. *A. setosa*, Craib (Siam) *A. hispida*, Kurz and *A. Beccariana*, Cogn. and *A. Griffithii*, Hook. fil., both of the latter seem to be species of *Phyllagathis*.\n\n**Anerincleistus**, Korth.\n\nThe type of this genus is *A. hirsutus*, Korth. to which I add *A. macranthus*, King, and *A. pauciflorus*, Ridl. They are all small trees or tree-like shrubs with a few umbelled flowers in the axils. The venation of the leaves is quite peculiar. The outer slender pair of nerves rises from the base of the blade, the second pair rises from the midrib as much as an inch from the base in *A. pauciflorus* and occasionally the lowest pair does the same. This nervation occurs also in *Pomatostoma*. *A. sublepidotus*, King, is very different from the other species in its panicle of many flowers in whorls but the inflorescence is axillary and the venation of the leaves identical, so I retain it in the genus as well as *A. glomerulatus*, King and *A. Beccarii*, *A. cordata*, Stapf, and *A. anisophyllus*, Stapf of Borneo, though some of these may be *Pomatostomas*. I exclude all the rest included under this genus by King and myself formerly.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 79.\nThe section *Coriaceae*. (Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Str. Br. 57, p. 45) forms the genus *Oritrephe*, Ridl. and *A. collinus*, Ridl. is referred to *Oxyspora*. *A. fruticosus*, Ridl. which seems most nearly allied to *Oritrephe*, but has a fruit more resembling that of a *Sonerila* cannot be fitted into any of these genera and I separate it into a distinct genus under the name of *Perilimnastes*.\n\n**Perilimnastes**, gen. nov.\n\nShrub, leaves subcoriaceous lanceolate acuminate, flowers 1-3 subumbellate calyx tube little dilate, lobes subulate. Petals 4 lanceolate acute stamens 8 anthers unequal acuminate base emarginate not appended, capsule obconic 4 angled smooth, with 4 inflexed valves, as in *Sonerila*. Species 1, *Anerincleistus fruticosus*, Ridl.\n\n**Pahang.**\n\n**Sonerila patula**, n. sp.\n\nA much branched spreading shrub about 12 in. tall, branched from the base, stems hairy with dense appressed hairs. Leaves lanceolate, acute with base acute, appressed hairy all over, subequal nerves 3, lowest leaves biggest 1.75 to 2-5 in. long, .3-.5 in. wide, petiole .1 in. Cymes chiefly solitary axillary in leaf axils and between the branches, peduncle 1 in. Flowers small, white 2-3 in a cyme. Calyx campanulate, lobes lanceolate acute, subulate. Petals triangular acuminate .1 in. Stamens 3, anthers elliptic blunt. Capsule trigonous turbinate, smooth, .2 in. long, pedicel stout .4.\n\n**Pahang**: in forest at Wray\u2019s Camp Gunong Tahan at 3,300 ft. alt.\n\nThe leaves of this are occasionally markedly unequal in size. It is allied to *S. albiflora*, Stapf, but its narrow leaves and spreading branches make it unlike anything in the Malay Peninsula.\n\n**Sonerila belluta**, n. sp.\n\nA delicate unbranched herb. 2-4 in. tall, base creeping quite glabrous. Leaves crowded at the top, narrow, lanceolate, subacute, narrowed to the base spine-toothed on the margin, dark green above, pale beneath .75 to 1.25 in. long .2 in across, nerves pinnate ascending about 4 pairs, petiole very slender, .3 in. long or less. Flowers about 5 cymose on a slender peduncle .75 in. long. Calyx slender cylindric, campanulate teeth short, triangular, green. Petals oblong cuspidate rose-pink .2 in. long. Anthers short, acuminate. Capsule smooth, obconic gradually narrowed to the pedicel .2 in. long, pedicel .1 in.\nJohor, on rocks on Gunong Banang near Batu Pahat (Ridley 11102).\n\nAllied to S. sarosa of Penang Hill, but the leaves are much narrower, the fruit smaller and it is quite glabrous.\n\n**Sonerila setosa**, n. sp.\n\nStem over 8 in. tall, densely bristly, hairy as are the petioles nerves beneath, and edge of leaf, inflorescence and calyx, slightly woody. Leaves very dissimilar, large one elliptic, oblong, acuminate base narrowed, unequally cordate, sprinkled with coarse hairs above membranous, nerves ascending from the lower third of the midrib, transverse nervules fine, conspicuous, 4.5 to 5 in. long, 1.5-2 in. wide. Petiole 1-1.5; small, leaves orbicular, reniform 1 in. long. Cymes dense, many flowered in all the axils of the small leaves and terminal about an inch long, densely setose, with red bristles. Flowers small, white. Calyx 1 in. long cylindric, campanulate, red. Petals small, linear, oblong, acute, bristly. Stamens 3, anthers oblong obtuse. Capsule campanulate, muricate, bristly .1 in. long, .2 in. wide, narrowed to its peduncle .2 in. long.\n\nPahang, on Gunong Tahan (Ridley 16036).\n\nAllied to S. caesia for a form of which I first mistook it.\n\n**Medinilla rubicunda**, Bl. was based on Jack's *Melastoma rubicunda* which is *Pogonanthera pulverulenta*, Bl.\n\nNo type specimen of Jack's seems to exist but in Wallich's collection No. 4086, is a specimen of *Pogonanthera* collected at Cape Rachado in Malacca (not Penang as Cogniaux gives it) which is queried for *Melastoma rubicunda*, Jack, by Wallich, as also is a *Medinilla* from Silhet. Jack's plant was collected at Singapore. Cogniaux gives *Medinilla rubicunda*, Bl. as a species and compounds it of the Sylhet plant *M. erythrophylla*, Lindl. (*Melastoma erythrophylla*, Wall. Cat. 4085) and Jack's species. *M. rubicunda*, Bl. therefore goes out as a synonym of *Pogonanthera pulverulenta* and the Sylhet plant which does not occur in the Malay Peninsula, retains the name of *M. erythrophylla*, Lindl.\n\n*Medinilla venusta*, King is apparently a somewhat variable plant. King described it as having 8 stamens and acute petals. His type specimens in the Herb. Kew have 8 stamens but I would not call the petals acute, they seem to be rounded. Stapf in Kew Bulletin, 1906, p. 73 describes under *M. chionantha*, a plant which was sent from Perak by Curtis and cultivated at Kew. It has round petals and 10 stamens, but except for the latter character it is quite like King's, *M. venusta* from Perak, I conclude it is a variety.\nMemecylon Cantleyi, n. sp.\n\nA large shrub, bark of branches pale. Leaves thin, coriaceous drying greenish, elliptic, acuminate to both ends equally; nerves 5 pairs, very faint on both sides, 3.5-4.5 in. long, 2-2.3 in. wide, petiole 1 in. long. Flowers few in axillary simple cymes .5 in. long. Peduncle .15 to .2 in. long, rather thick pedicels half as long. Calyx wide cupped, rather flat when expanded, narrowed to base, truncate or very minutely dentate .1 in. long, .15 in. wide, white with a pale violet tinge. Petals (cuspidate in bud) pale blue subquadrate shortly apiculate below apiculate above, nearly .3 in. across. Stamens deep violet, ovary with 12 ovules crowned by an elongate punctate style. Fruit not seen (there is some in a capsule with one of Maingay's specimens (which are all in flower but being detached it is probable that they do not belong).\n\nSingapore; (Cantley): Garden jungle (Ridley 13012). Malacca (Maingay).\n\nThis was named *M. laevigatum*, Clarke and *M. garcinoides* by King in Herb. Kew, but it seems to me abundantly distinct, not only in the longer, narrower leaves but in the much larger flower. I have taken part of the description from Maingay's mss. notes. He adds that it is a remarkably elegant, large shrub in flower.\n\nMemecylon longifolium, n. sp.\n\nTree, branches with grey bark. Leaves elliptic, lanceolate, long, cuspidate tip blunt, narrowed to the rounded base nerves about 20 pairs, the secondary ones being nearly as prominent as the primary ones, but all slender and not prominent inarching 4 in. from the margin, thinly coriaceous, light green when dry, 7-8 in. long, 2-2.25 in. wide, petiole very short .05 or less. Flowers in very short .2 in. axillary sessile fascicles about 10 in. a fascicle, very small pink, pedicels .05. Calyx at first subpyriform with four short rounded lobes eventually campanulate, truncate .1 in. long. Petals ovate triangular subobtuse.\n\nDindings, Lumut (Ridley 9475). Referred by King to *M. amplexicaule*, Roxb., but the leaves are not cordate and the flowers much smaller. It is certainly allied to this species as also to *heteropleurum*.\n\nMemecylon gracilipes, n. sp.\n\nSmall tree with slender, grey twigs, slightly winged below the nodes. Leaves thinly coriaceous drying green, almost sessile ovate, cuspidate base round, midrib beneath elevate as are 4-5 pairs of conspicuous nerves depressed above inarching .25 in. from the edge 2.5 to 3 in. long, 1.5 in. wide. Cymes very slender 1-1.5 in. long, lower ones once branched, upper\nones simple, peduncle very slender .5 in. long, pedicels .2 in. long, very slender. Flowers umbelled, 3. Calyx .1 in. long, the base subglobose, the limb wide saucer-shaped .2 in. across, teeth minute, petals ovate, acute .1 in. Style rather long. Fruit globose .5 in. through on a pedicel .45 in. long. Seed globose testa brown shining.\n\nPerak, Waterloo Estate 1,000 ft. (Curtis 1295).\n\nThe only plant at all like this is M. arnottianum, Thw. of Ceylon but that has 3-nerved leaves. The petals appear to have been white, the calyx tinted red.\n\nM. terminale, Dalz. of Southern India also resembles it but shows no nerves.\n\nMemecylon floridum, n. sp.\n\nTree 40 to 50 feet tall, branches subterete, fuscous. Leaves thin, coriaceous, lanceolate acuminate, nearly equally to both ends, tip blunt, nerves very faint on both sides, a faint intramarginal nerve along each edge rising from base, laterals about 7 pairs 3-4 in. long by a 125 wide, petiole winged nearly to base .3 in. long. Cymes 1-3 in the axils of each leaf, peduncles thick .3 in. long, bearing an umbel of three or more flowers on thick .1 in. pedicels, with lanceolate, blunt bracts at base. Calyx base cylindric obconic limb broad, in bud widely cupular, in flower .1 across. Petals ovate, in bud conic blunt. Style long and stout.\n\nPerak, Larut 500-1,000 ft. Nov. 1882 (Kunstler 3551).\n\nI cannot fit this plant into any described species, the larger flowers, and short, dense cymes and the long acuminate leaves showing a distinct pair of intramarginal nerves, seem to keep it distinct from anything.\n\nMemecylon malaccense, Clarke mss.\n\nM. amabile, Bedd. var. malaccensis, Clarke Flor. Brit. Ind. ii, 555.\n\nProbably a shrub, with slender, grey angled and faintly winged branches. Leaves ovate, lanceolate, base rounded tip acuminate, blunt, fleshy coriaceous opaque, drying brown above reddish beneath with no visible nerves on either surface, 2-2.75 by 1-1.25 in. wide, sessile or with a minute petiole. Cymes very short, .3 in. long, peduncle .15 or much shorter. Flowers 4-5 umbelled on the end of the peduncle. Calyx cup-shaped, truncate with a broad base, fleshy (drying black). Petals forming a blunt cone in bud, ovate.\n\nMalacca (Maingay 2531, 2528) \u201cNepus Kolite\u201d (Nipis Kulit).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 79.\nThe specimens of this are very poor, and King puts it under the doubtful species. In the branches and form of the flowers it suggests an affinity with *M. fruticosa* but its opaque nerveless small leaves make it quite distinct. I cannot place it under any of our known species.\n\n**Memecylon laxiflorum**, Wall. Cat. 4472. A large shrub with grey branches. Leaves stiffly coriaceous ovate, obtuse or acuminate, base round, nerves very faint and slender about 8 pairs when dry, dark above, reddish below 4-4.5 in. long, 2-3 in. across, petiole .4-.5 in. long, stout. Cymes 1-4 from axil of fallen leaves. Peduncle .3 in. long bearing a number of cymules on short pedicels .1 in. long with longer, slender pedicels .2 in. long. Calyx campanulate, base hemispheric, limb larger, truncate. Petals 8, short, subacute, blue. Fruit globose with very little trace of the calyx limb, .25 in. through on a cyme 2.5 in. long.\n\nSingapore (Wallich 4472). Johor; Minyak Buku (Ridley 11092) and Pinerong (Ridley 15396). Penang; Beach behind Muka Head (Curtis 723).\n\nThis seashore shrub differs from *M. oleaefolium*, Bl. in its stiffer, round leaves with a longer petiole and fewer pedicels with shorter cymes. The nerves though slender and not elevate are quite visible, they inarch into a lateral nerve close to the margin.\n\n**Memecylon amplexicaule**, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. p. 260.\n\nA specimen of this plant so labelled by Roxburgh occurs in the British Museum, and is certainly *M. microstomum*, Clarke. Roxburgh\u2019s description agrees perfectly with the specimen and does not at all agree with the plants put under this name by Wight, Clarke, King or other botanists. Roxburgh states that his species is veinless which is the case in *microstomum* but the species named *amplexicaule* by other botanists has peculiarly strongly developed veins on the leaf. Wight\u2019s plant so named in Icones 279, is not Roxburgh\u2019s and may be *M. Wightii*, Thw. of Ceylon. *M. depressum*, Benth. Wall. Cat. 4101 was never described. There are 2 or three plants mixed under the number 4101 and it is impossible to guess which Bentham intended, nearly all Wallich\u2019s specimens labelled *M. amplexicaule*, Roxb. are the correct plant. His only sheet of the Penang plant *M. amplexicaule*, King, etc.) is labelled doubtfully as *M. grande*, Retz. which it is not. There therefore appears to be no name for this plant, and as King\u2019s description is apparently mixed, I separate and describe this plant under the name of *M. Wallichii*. A small tree, branchlets 4-angled, leaves lanceolate acuminate or ovate, base minutely cordate, coriaceous, nerves about 18 pairs inarching .1-.15 in. within the margin, very nearly sessile the thick petiole concealed by the lobes of the leaf at the base, 7-8 in. long,\n2.75-3 in. wide. Cyme axillary peduncle .1 stout. Flowers numerous, crowded. Calyx cup-shaped, base blunt, edge truncate, not lobed but minutely-irregular, pedicel stout nearly as long .1 in. long. Petals white or pinkish, broad, ovate, blunt. Style rather stout, short. Fruit black, globose .2 in. through.\n\n*M. amplexicaule*, King and others not of Roxburgh.\n\nPenang; (Wallich 4101C.) Experimental Nursery; (Curtis 965 and 457); Moniot\u2019s Road (Ridley). Perak; (Scortechini 231); Larut, 800-1,000 ft. (Kunstler, *M. heteropleurum* var. *olivaceum*, King! and 3058 Kunstler), Waterloo (Curtis 1294).\n\nThe Penang plants have long, narrow lanceolate leaves, while those of Perak have shorter, broader, ovate ones, but there are intermediate forms. Generally speaking the plant resembles *M. heteropleurum*, Miq. but that has the leaves very shortly cuneate, never rounded or cordate and the flowers about half as big.\n\n*M. costatum*, Miq. Verh. Ned. Inst. 1850, p. 29 is recorded by King from Perak (Kunstler 10785); I have not seen this specimen and there is no specimen of Miquel\u2019s species from the Peninsula at Kew. King\u2019s description differs from Miquel\u2019s in \u201cbase of leaves rounded or slightly narrowed, not cordate\u201d whereas Miquel\u2019s species had cordate leaves, and in \u201cflowers in axillary glomeruli\u201d instead of widely spreading panicled cymes. So it seems clear that King\u2019s *M. costatum* is not Miquel\u2019s.\n\n**Rubiaceae.**\n\n*Uncaria parviflora*, n. sp.\n\n*Uncaria lanosa* var. *parviflora*, Ridl. Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Str. Br. lix, p. 109.\n\nClimber with 4 angled stems, .2 in. through, sparsely hairy, branches more densely hairy with short rough hairs. Leaves lanceolate, acuminate, base broad, membranous, scabrid hairy above, beneath velvety hairy; nerves about 7 pairs, slender elevate beneath, 2.75 in. long, 1.25 in. wide; petiole .1 in.

Corolla sparsely silky, hairy; tube very slender .2 in. lobes oblong ovate blunt, glabrous within.\n\nPerlis, Chupeng in open country, forming large bushes (Ridley 15019).\n\nOn further examination I find that this plant is specifically distinct from *U. lanosa*.\nCoptosapelta parviflora, n. sp.\n\nLofty climber, nearly glabrous. Leaves elliptic rather long, sharply acuminate, base cuneate, dark shining green, glabrous except for a few rather long hairs on the midrib, nerves 4 prs. fine, reticulations visible on both sides, 3-5 in. long 1.5 in. wide; petiole white-hairy .3-.4 in. Stipules triangular acute, .1 in. long. Panicle terminal 2.5 in. long in flower, with thin branches, lax, sparsely white-hairy. Bracts narrow, linear, lanceolate acuminate .1 in. long. Flowers green. Pedicels white-hairy .1 in. long. Calyx .1 in. obconic ridged, white-hairy, limb campanulate about as long with 5 ovate lobes. Corolla-tube cylindric .2 in. long, white, silky, lobes linear, oblong, nearly as long, glabrous keeled, mouth of tube white-hairy. Stamens hairy. Fruit panicle 3 in. long 6 in. across. Branches angled, nearly glabrous. Fruit .2 in. long, globular, ovoid.\n\nSingapore, Bukit Timah (Ridley 14117). Penang; (Curtis) Borneo: Sarawak (Beccari 2518).\n\nThis species differs in being subglabrous and having the flowers much smaller in a short terminal panicle. The fruit is also smaller and quite glabrous.\n\nArgostemma rugosum, n. sp.\n\nStem fleshy, branched, erect 4 inches or more, transversely rugose as are the petioles and midrib, hairy. Leaves very unequal, larger one oblong or elliptic, shortly acute, base rounded or cuneate, unequal glabrous above, nerves hairy beneath 10-11 prs., reticulations conspicuous 2-3 in. long, 1-1.5 in. long, petiole .2 in. long. Small leaf, lanceolate, subacute .2 in. long. Stipules lanceolate acute, as long. Peduncle 1 in. or less with an umbel of several large flowers on pedicels .5-75 in. long. Bracts at base of umbel lanceolate. Calyx-tube short, campanulate, with lanceolate acute lobes, much longer; .2 in. long. Corolla .8 in. across lobes oblong, lanceolate subacute. Staminal column shorter curved.\n\nSelangor; Gunong Mengkuang 3,600 ft. (Kloss).\n\nI took this at first for an abnormal specimen or variety of A. spinulosum, Clarke, but in view of the greater size of calyx lobes and corolla, which is longer, not shorter than the staminal column, I conclude it is a distinct species.\n\nArgostemma nervosum, n. sp.\n\nStem rather woody ascending for 8 inches, dense, hairy, rather stout. Leaves very unequal, large ones subsessile, oblong, oblanceolate, abruptly acute, narrowed to the unequal rounded base, membranous above with pale hairs scattered sparsely and thicker on midrib; nerves 11-12 prs., conspicuous both sides much elevate parallel and hairy beneath, reticula-\ntions hardly visible 2.5 in. long, 1.25 in. wide, small leaf, sessile, ovate acute sessile .5 in. long 13 in. wide edges hairy.\n\nStipules similar smaller. Cymes terminal and in upper axils densely hairy up to calyx. Peduncle .25 in. long, pedicels 1.5 in. long. Flowers in pairs. Calyx campanulate, dense, hairy lobes short, toothlike. Corolla .6 in. across lobes narrow, lanceolate, acuminate, hairy on the back. Staminal cone slightly longer. Fruit globose campanulate .2 in. long, hairy.\n\nSelangor, Sempang, Mines (Ridley 15658).\n\nNear A. elatostemma, Hook. fil., but a much stouter plant very hairy all over, with stiffer leaves, larger, sessile, and strongly nerved but not reticulate. Cymes with short peduncle, long pedicels and flowers hairy.\n\nArgostemma grandiflora, n. sp.\n\nAscending herb, 5 in. tall, glabrous, entirely except a little hairiness on stem. Leaves unequal, larger ones lanceolate, fleshy or ovate lanceolate, narrowed to both ends, nerves invisible .-1.4 in. long, .3-.4 in. wide; petiole slender .1, small leaves ovate lanceolate .2 in. long, .1 in. wide. Stipules similar. Flowers solitary, terminal, and in upper axils peduncle 1.5 in. long with 2 pairs of bracts, one obcuneate toothed and .2 in. long and one smaller, three-toothed, ovate .1 in. long above. Calyx tube short, obconic, lobes narrow, linear, lanceolate acuminate .15 in., glabrous. Corolla .7 in. across, lobes ovate acute .2 in. across. Staminal column shorter .2 in. long, thick.\n\nPerak: Gunong Kerbau 4,500 ft. (Robinson) a single specimen.\n\nI took this for an abnormally glabrous specimen of A. involucratum, Hemsl., but it differs so markedly in its nerveless fleshy leaves, the curious involucral bracts, all toothed conspicuously, and the large broad lobed corolla that it must be considered distinct.\n\nArgostemma trichanthum, Ridl.\n\nWhole plant 4 inches long, stem ascending, hairy, with curled viscid hairs. Leaves very unequal, larger one lanceolate, subacutely acuminate narrowed or not to unequally cordate base, membranous, glabrous above, sparsely hairy beneath, more so on the midrib and on the seven pairs of slender nerves 1.75 in. long, to 3 in. long, 1-1.5 in. wide; petiole hairy .1, small leaf ovate, acute, base round .12 in. long. Stipules resembling the small leaf. Cymes several in the uppermost axils 1.5-2 in. long, hairy all over, peduncle .5 in. and branches several, slender. Bracts oblong, lanceolate .1 in. long, glabrous. Calyx campanulate, lobes short, ovate, triangular, hairy. Corolla lobes narrow, lanceolate, acuminate, backs hairy, .2 in.\nlong. Stamens nearly as long, acuminate. Fruit campanulate, hairy.\n\nSelangor, Ulu Langat (Kloss).\n\nThe leaves appear to have a white longitudinal fascia as in A. elatostemma and other species.\n\nNearest to elatostemma, but the leaves acuminate, lanceolate, the flowers more numerous and smaller and the whole inflorescence more hairy.\n\nMussaenda spectabilis, n. sp.\n\nShrub. Branches hairy with many linear lenticels. Leaves chartaceous ovate\u2014oblong base round abruptly short, acute cuspidate, above glabrous except the midrib, beneath thickly sprinkled with short hairs, midrib and nerves about 10, slender rather faint pairs, appressed-hairy, 5-6 in. long, 2.25-2.75 in. wide; petiole 1.25. Stipules triangular, setaceous densely hairy; Cymes terminal several, densely hairy, peduncles about 1 in. long, generally two branched. Bracts lanceolate acuminate, hairy. Calyx-lobes lanceolate acuminate, subfalcate 1 in. long unequal, hairy .1 in. across or less. Corolla tube densely hairy 1 in. long, limb 2.25 across, lobes 1.1 long .5 inches across pubescent on the back, puberulous velvety above, the mouth with short dense yellow hairs running from the centre up to the midrib of each petal.\n\nPahang; Pulau Tioman (C. B. Kloss, June, 1916).\n\nA very fine species allied to M. mutabilis var. hirsuta but the flowers are considerably larger and much more hairy and the calyx lobes are very much longer and as long as the corolla tube. The leaves though usually round at the base are occasionally narrowed.\n\nUrophyllum coriaceum, n. sp.\n\nSmall branched tree with white corky bark. Leaves coriaceous elliptic or oblong acuminate, cuspidate, base very shortly narrowed quite glabrous; nerves about 12 pairs, elevate as are the reticulations on both sides; midrib depressed above 3.5-6 inches long 1.5-2 in. wide; petiole .5 in. long. Stipules short lanceolate acuminate blunt. Cymes few-flowered about .4 in. long including .2 in. long peduncles. Calyx widely cupular .05 in. long, .1 in. wide truncate, entire. Corolla .15 in. long coriaceous, tube very short, lobes 5, splitting nearly to the base, acute, hairy within at the mouth; Anthers narrow, linear, acute. Style very short, stigma fusiform.\n\nPahang; Gunong Tahan at Wray's Camp, (Ridley 16247, 16070).\n\nThis shrub or small tree had much the habit of an elder-bush with stout branches from the base covered with white\ncorky bark. It was about 8 or 10 ft. tall. In life the leaves and flowers suggested those of *U. glabrum* but they are much more coriaceous, the flowers larger and rigid, the edges of the petals run down nearly the whole length of the corolla as ridges, and are separate or nearly separate for most of the way. The whole plant is almost completely glabrous.\n\n**Randia (Ceriscus) oocarpa**, n. sp.\n\nShrub. Branchlets slender, long, white-barked, spines on the lower part only, 1 in. or less, terminal branchlets short, distant 1 in. long, knotted. Leaves membranous ovate to oblong, obtuse or subacute base narrowed or lanceolate 1-3.5 in. long, .5-1.25 in. across; nerves about 4 pairs, slender elevate beneath, thickly sprinkled by short hairs on both sides, especially hairy on midrib both sides and nerves, bigger leaves becoming glabrescent; petiole hairy .1 or less. Stipules ovate, acuminate keeled. Flowers 1-2 terminal, white, becoming orange; pedicel .05 in. hairy. Calyx .3 in densely rather long hairy lobes, ovate, less than half as long, in flower. Corolla as long as calyx-tube, short, thick, hairy, white becoming orange-coloured. Fruit obovoid 2 in. long, 1.75 in. wide, rough when dry, glabrous.\n\n**Pahang**: Pekan *(Ridley)*. **Perak**: Relau Tujor *(Wray 2599a)*; Taiping *(Scortechini)*. **Kedah**: Lankawi, Kwah *(Curtis)*, Burau *(Ridley 15016)*. **Perlis**: Kanga *(Ridley 15007)*.\n\nThis plant was identified by King with *Randia Dumetorum* Lam., a native of India, and following the Flora of British India he gives as synonyms a large number of what I should consider distinct species. The nearest species to this is *R. stipulosa*, Miq. of Java, which he gives as a synonym, but that has smaller leaves and larger flowers with larger calyx lobes. From the true *R. dumetorum* of Lamark, this species differs in the thinner, larger leaves, and smaller flowers, more lax habit and smaller and scantier thorns.\n\n**Randia incurva**, n. sp.\n\nA tree. Leaves thinly coriaceous, elliptic, shortly acuminate, base cuneate, nerves 9 pairs, the lowest very fine from the base, the others widely inarching .2-.4 in. from the edge, reticulations wide .75-8 in. long, 2.75-3.25 in. wide; petiole .3 in. long, stipules triangular mucronate. Cymes panicled terminal 2.5 in. long and wide, peduncle .3 in. long and like the branches, woody. Flowers numerous, fragrant. Pedicels .1-.2 in. long, pubescent. Bracts small, ovate. Calyx campanulate, pubescent .2 in long with very short teeth. Corolla cylindric, rather narrow .3 in. long, lobes oblong rounded .1 in. long. Anthers linear. Stigma cylindric, thick, shorter than lobes.\nPenang; West Hill at 1,000 ft. (Curtis No. 818).\n\nThis is one of the species included under *R. Forbesii*, King, by King and Gamble in the materials, but it is utterly different from the other plants on which the species is based. It is an unarmed tree, *Forbesii* a climber. The foliage is quite different, that of *Forbesii* being coriaceous with only the primary nerves visible, those of *R. incurva* are thin, large with very conspicuous, inarching veins. The calyx of *Forbesii* is cylindric truncate, the corolla tube nearly twice as long, the lobes narrower and smaller.\n\n*R. longiflora*, Lam. Dict. ii. p. 227. Ill. t. 156 f. 3.\n\nThough there can be little doubt as to which species Lamarck intended, there has been a great mixture made under this name in the Flora of British India. This appears to have been due in the first instance to De Candolle, who thought that *Posoqueria longiflora*, Roxb. was Lamarck\u2019s *R. longiflora*. To this species Hooker in Flora of British India has added (1) *R. scandens*, Dec. *Tocoyena scandens*, Bl. and (2) *Gardenia patula*, Horsfield, both utterly different plants. *R. longiflora*, Lam. is the thorny, half scandent bush, so common in the tidal swamps of the Malay Peninsula. It occurs also in Borneo, and is absent entirely from India. The Indian plant is totally different, and does not seem to have any name. The only evidence of its occurring in the Malay Peninsula is Wallich\u2019s specimen numbered 8284 D, collected by him in Singapore in 1822.\n\n**Randia Roxburghii**, n. sp.\n\nA glabrous, woody climber with numerous recurved spines .5 in. long in pairs at each node, bark whitish. Leaves coriaceous, elliptic, shortly acuminate, blunt, base cuneate, nerves 4 pairs depressed above, raised beneath slender, secondary nerves and reticulations invisible, 4 in. long, 1.75 in. 1.8 in. wide; petiole .2 in. long. Cymes nearly all axillary lax, peduncle .3 in. long branches spreading few about as long. Bracts small, ovate, persistent. Pedicel nearly .1 in. long. Calyx urn-shaped, narrowed at the base with triangular, short teeth .2 in. long. Corolla tube 1 in. long, cylindric, lobes broad, oblong, subacute .4 in. long, .1 in. wide. Fruit globose, ribbed, about 5 in. long, crowned with the remains of the calyx.\n\nSingapore; (Wallich 8284 D), (Lobb). Chittagong. Assam (Jenkins). Silhet (Wallich 8284 B).\n\nIt is quite possible that Wallich\u2019s plant came from Chittagong and another specimen in Herb. Hooker is labelled \u201cChittagong (Wallich) 8284 D.\u201d but there is a ticket on the specimen in Wallich\u2019s own herbarium saying he got it in Singapore. It has not been met with in the Peninsula since.\nGardenia elata, n. sp.\n\nA very big tree nearly 100 ft. tall. Leaves subcoriaceous oblanceolate, apiculate, base cuneate, nerves 17 pairs, sub-horizontal, with transverse nervules all elevate beneath, 9 in. long, 3.5 in. wide, petiole 1 in. long.

Raceme dense .5 in., few flowered, cone-like, 4-angled heads. Bracts ovate, coriaceous ciliate along the edge, nearly as long as sessile flowers. Calyx obconic with 5 short broad triangular lobes densely woolly hairy at tips .15. Corolla .15 in. long tube short, thick glabrous outside, pubescent within, lobes oblong blunt as long as the tube, hairy at tips. Anthers linear, sessile on the mouth of tube. Style as long as calyx lobes, stigmas 2, thick linear blunt, all pubescent.\n\nApparently rare. Singapore in the Garden Jungle. (Ridley 10722).\n\nTimonius hirsutus, n. sp.\n\nSmall shrub with slender purplish brown twigs, young parts with long white hairs. Leaves membranous on the ends of bare shoots, lanceolate acuminate, base rounded, nerves 7 prs. elevate beneath sparsely short-hairy on nerves above, and sparsely hairy beneath, nerves and midrib with dense appressed hairs 3-4 in. long, .5-1.25 in. wide, petiole very hairy .12 in. long. Stipules triangular elongate, acuminate, setaceous, glabrous .1 in. Cymes hairy axillary in the uppermost axils .6 in. long. Peduncle slender .25 in. long. Cymes in pairs 3-flowered, outer flowers, with pedicel .1 in. long, central flower sessile. Calyx very small, campanulate, lobes linear as long as tube. Corolla white .25 in. long, tube very slender, lobes very short oblong, blunt, white, silky all over but the back of the lobes long-bearded.\nCurtis collected this without fruit or flowers in the Langkawi Islands (No. 2544) I made a note on it in Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Str. Br. 59, p. 115. Now good flowering specimens come from Pulau Dayang Bunting collected by H. C. Robinson, No. 6229 of his collection labelled \"small bush flowers, white.\" The hairs on this plant are described by me as red, the foliage was however, older. In Robinson's specimens the leaves are mostly hardly developed and the hairs are white and silky.\n\n**Coffea viridiflora**, n. sp.\n\nShrub glabrous 12-14 ft. tall. Leaves fleshy, membranous elliptic, oblong, cuspidate (cusp blunt 1 in. long) nerves 8-9 pairs, slender ascending, midrib channelled above, base cuneate decurrent on the channelled petiole, 8 in. long, 3 in. wide; petiole rather thick .75 in. Stipules caducous. Flowers in axillary heads in each leaf axil, sessile or shortly peduncled, few green. Calyces connate in a head sessile gummy. Corolla .2 in. long, tube cylindric, lobes linear acuminate 4, contort half as long. Anthers shortly projecting, rather large. Fruit globose .3 in. through crowned with circular calyx scar.

Corolla light red, tube .75 in. long, lobes broad, oblong, rounded.\n\nPerak, Gunong Kerbau (Aniff).\n\nThe specimen is very imperfect but it seems quite distinct from *I. opaca* which is the nearest thing to it.\n\n**Ixora grandifolia**, Zoll & Moritz Verz. 65.\n\nUnder this name Hooker and King have collected a variety of species forming a group of species rather than a single one. Among the plants thus included by King are *Ixora grandifolia*, Zoll. and Mor. a big tree with white flowers, of which he describes a variety *gigantea*, but I see no difference between this variety and his type-species (which is not Zollinger's plant) and is described below. Next comes his variety *coriacea* in which following Hooker he includes at least two distinct\nspecies, one the comparatively thin leaved plant with rose-pink flowers, the *I. coriacea* of Brown in Wallich's Herbarium No. 6151 the other a thick leaved plant with dense corymbs of white flowers collected by Griffith in Malacca. All the species want describing.\n\n**Ixora coriacea**, Br. in Wall. Cat. 6151.\n\nApparently a tree. Leaves coriaceous, elliptic acuminate acute base shortly narrowed and blunt, nerves about 12 pairs sunk above, elevate beneath, 10 in. long, 3.5 in. wide; petiole thick .5 in. long. Stipules broad, coriaceous, ovate truncate rounded, mucronate. Cyme panicles 3 terminal, peduncles 2.5 -3 in. long, panicle 4 in. across, 3 in. long, branches puberulous.

Leaves very thick coriaceous and smooth, shining, elliptic lanceolate, blunt base, narrowed, nerves about 10 pairs, often deep-sunk above, elevate beneath, midrib stout, 8-9 in. long, 3-3.5 in. wide, petiole thick .25 in. Stipules broad, triangular mucronate. Inflorescence of several stout branches, thickly short, hairy with dense umbellate cymes of white flowers crowded together 3 inches long, 4 in. wide primary peduncles very short. Calyx subcampanulate with small rounded lobes. Corolla .4 in. long, tube slender, lobes narrow nearly as long, white, base red.\n\nMalacca, Ayer Panas heavy jungle (Griffith).\n\nAll the specimens are in bud or fruit.\n\n**Ixora patens**, n. sp.\n\nLeaves elliptic, lanceolate, acuminate, acute, base narrowed, thin coriaceous, nerves fine about 18 pairs, secondaries nearly as prominent, midrib elevate 7 in. long, 2 in. wide, petiole .25 in. long. Corymb spreading, 5 branches, 2 lower ones with peduncle 2 in. long, spreading horizontally, the upper 3.1 in. from them, forming an umbel with small lanceolate bracts at base, peduncles one inch, all the cymes of several branches about one inch long, many-flowered, branchlets very short.

(Robinson).\n\nI am not sure of the color of this but it seems to have been red. All this set differs entirely from King's *grandifolia* and his variety *arborescens*, in having the base of the leaf narrowed to a point. The variety *arborescens*, Hook. fil. has as a Synonym Hasskarl's. *I. arborescens*, Retzia I. p. 22 which is a distinct species. *I. gigantea*. *Ixora grandifolia*, Hook. fil. and King not of Zollinger.\n\nTree to 60 to 80 feet tall, 15-20 in. through with spreading branches. Leaves very coriaceous, elliptic, tip round, base round, 10 in. long, 5.5 in. wide or less, nerves prominent about 6 pairs, petiole thick 1 in. long.

Fruit globose, pea-shaped, .15 in. through, bright red.\n\nPerak, Larut, (*Kunstler* 5609, 5466; Wray 2973).\n\nThe leaves of the true plant of Zollinger are less coriaceous much smaller and narrowed at the base, the inflorescence much smaller. In fruit the inflorescence of *gigantea* becomes stout and woody and is as much as 8 inches long, the peduncle nearly .25 in. thick.\n\n**Ixora fluminalis**, n. sp. *I. grandifolia* var. *arborescens*, King not *I. arborescens*.

Perak, Goping (*Kunstler*). Kedah, Lankawi, Gunong Raya, (*Aniff*).\n\nThe true *arborescens* of Hasskarl, of which there is a cotype in Herb. Kew, has thinner leaves narrowed at the base. The inflorescence more slender and lax. Calyx lobes larger. Corolla more slender with narrower lobes and said to be white. In fruit the panicle though longer is not so thick as in *I. fluminalis*. The bracts at base of inflorescence are more lanceolate.\nLasianthus bractescens, n. sp.\n\nA shrub. Branches, midrib above and nerves beneath and inflorescence hairy.

Kedah; Kedah Peak (Ridley 5549).\n\nClarke suggested that this was a Saposma and says it is not a Mephitidia but it does not seem to me to resemble a Saposma at all.\n\nMorinda elliptica, n. sp. M. citrifolia var. elliptica, King and Gamble in Materials.\n\nIt seems most extraordinary that this plant by far the commonest species in the Malay Peninsula, and most abundant in newly cleared ground should be up to the present time nameless, but indeed it is so common and well-known in its habitats that hardly any botanist has troubled to collect specimens. There are only one or two poor specimens in the Kew herbarium and I think none at the British Museum. These specimens have been mistaken for the very different Morinda citrifolia, L. or of a variety of it M. elliptica a small tree or shrub with pale bark about 12-14 feet tall occasionally larger.\nLeaves narrow elliptic or oblanceolate shortly acuminate and long narrowed to base, dull green rather fleshy drying black, nerves about 7 pairs: 5 in. long, 1.25 in. wide, petiole .4 in. long. Peduncles slender 1.25 in. long. Head of flowers .25 in. long, green, flowers white. Fruit head oblong green hardly pulpy .5 in. long, common all over the Peninsula in cleared ground among lalang, and more bushy on rocks by the sea to complete the account of this plant additional specimens are badly needed. It is quite different from Citrifolia which has large ovate round leaves, much larger heads of flowers, and oblong white pulpy fruit as big as the fist. This species I have never seen really wild. It is common in Campongs, and is the true Mengkudu of the Malays. It may be a native of India.\n\nCoelospermum biovulatum, Clarke MSS. Herb. Kew.\n\nLeaves thin, coriaceous, not fleshy elliptic abruptly cuspitate acute or shortly acuminate, base cuneate unequal, glabrous, shining above 6 in. long, 2.75 in. wide, nerves hardly visible above, beneath conspicuously elevate inarching .2 in. from edge, reticulations elevate, petiole .7 in. long. Stipules short acute. Peduncle 1.5 in. long with 4 or 5 branches .25 in. long bearing 5-6 terminal umbellate flowers. Calyx puberulous, campanulate with rather a wide rim .12 in. across. Corolla in bud clubbed fusiform, .4 in. tube .3 in. slightly dilate upwards lobes linear recurved, more than as half as long, yellow. Stamen filaments long, projecting. Anthers long, linear curved ovary 2-celled, ovule one in each cell on the middle of the septum.\n\nMalacca: (Maingay No. 3053).\n\nThis has been referred by Hooker to C. scandens, Bl. and to C. truncatum by King. It totally differs from either species in which the texture of the leaves is so fleshy that they dry black and hardly show the nervation. It is apparently a very rare plant as no one but Maingay has collected it.\n\nPsychotria rudis, n. sp.\n\nShrub, not branched. Leaves elliptic lanceolate, long acuminate, long narrowed to base, membranous sparsely hairy on nerves and nervules above thickly sprinkled with hairs on back, nerves 10 pairs elevate beneath 6-8 in. long, 2-2.5 in. wide, petiole slender, hairy .75 in.

Leaves coriaceous lanceolate, glabrous narrowed to both ends, the acumination longest at base from the middle of the leaf, underside paler than upper, nerves 12 pairs, faint, 4-5 in. long, 1.5 in. wide, petiole .5 in. long. Stipules broad oblong truncate with a long setiform cusp rising from the back. Cymes terminal 3, peduncle 2 in. long glabrous branches .5-1 in. long puberulous, bearing 1-3 globose umbelled cymules at the tip .3 in. through. Bracts lanceolate acuminate. Bracteoles usually blunt.\n\nSelangor; Gunong Mengkuang Lebar (Robinson).\n\nThis plant (only in young bud unfortunately) resembles P. angulata, Korth., but the stipules are quite different, the leaves more coriaceous and the inflorescence puberulous.\n\nPsychotria minutiflora, n. sp.\n\nStems glabrous. Leaves membranous elliptis, lanceolate acuminate, base long, narrowed, drying black, nerves 13 pairs conspicuous elevate beneath 6-7 in. long, 1.5-2 in. wide, petiole slender 1.5-2 in. long. Stipules broad, oblong, abruptly blunt acuminate, connate edge ciliate .6 in. long. Cyme panicled sessile, many-flowered, 1.5 in. long, 2 in. wide. Calyx short cup-shaped, narrowed below the broad short toothed limb. Corolla .05 tubular, short, lobes as long as tube, 5 reflexed, mouth tomentose. Anthers short, filament in mouth of tube projecting. Style longer bilobed with thick lobes at apex. Ovary 2-celled. 2-seeded.\n\nSelangor; Ginting Sempah (Ridley).\n\nCephaelis.\n\nThe Malayan species of this genus have been much confused in the Flora of British India and especially in King's Materials. The succulence of the plants makes them often difficult to dry properly and consequently specimens are often troublesome to make out.\n\nC. cuneatum, Korth. This plant a native of Mount Singa-lan in Sumatra cannot possibly be the narrow leaved plant of Mount Ophir, as it is described by Korthals as having obovate leaves. It is however, so identified in both the works above referred to. I propose for the Mount Ophir plant the name of Cephaelis angustifolia, n. sp.\n\nHerbaceous plant, stem slender, not or hardly branched. Leaves linear lanceolate acuminate, long\u2014narrowed to the base, and to the apex from the middle, fleshy membranous, nerves fine, about 15 pairs, slender curved ascending, 6-9 in. long, 1-1.5 in. wide, petiole 1.5 in. long. Stipules connate in a tube with two acuminate points .2 in. long. Peduncle slender\n2-3 in. long. Capitulum .75-1 in. across. Bracts ovate orbicular rounded truncate .4 in. long and as wide. Calyx truncate. Corolla honey yellow, tube cylindric curved. Fruit oblong .5 in. long when dry, light blue.\n\nMalacca, Mount Ophir (all collectors). Johor, Gunong Pantai and Negri Sembilan, Gunong Tampin, a form with broader leaves.\n\nCephaelis Ridleyi, King and Gamble. This seems to have been based on a plant collected by me at Bukit Kutu in Selangor, a remarkably stout species about 2 feet tall, the stem thick and fleshy, with the leaves all deeply tinted with purple. The flowers also purple. To this I would add a plant collected at Gunong Inas by Yapp at an altitude of 3,500 feet. But the plants collected in Singapore and Curtis's plant from Penang appear to me to be totally different though King and Gamble call these also C. Ridleyi.\n\nI would separate them under the name of C. singapurensis. Whole plant about 2 feet tall, stem moderately slender. Leaves elongate lanceolate acuminate long-narrowed to base nerves 16 pairs, 9 in. long, 2.5 in. wide, petiole 1 in. long. Stipules connate into a tube with 2 blunt points .15 in. long. Peduncle 1-2.5 in. long. Head about 1 in. across. Bracts outer pair broad, ovate subacute or blunt, inner ones oblong. Calyx very short, truncate. Corolla 1.25 in. long, tube thick, lobes ovate obtuse, all honey yellow. Fruit light blue.\n\nIn damp woods. Singapore; Bajau. Johor; Gunong Pulai and Gunong Pantai.\n\nCephaelis elliptica, n. sp.

Flowers not seen. Fruit oblong, rounded at tip and base with a strong rib on each side .4 in. long, .3 in. wide (dry).\n\nPahang, Telom (Ridley 13636).\n\nI have not seen flowers of this plant but the foliage in texture and shape is very different from any other species and the fruit is much less pulpy.\n\nCephaelis triceps, n. sp.\n\nAbout a foot or more tall. Leaves somewhat or very unequal in size, rather fleshy, membranous, elliptic, shortly blunt acuminate, base shortly cuneate, nerves about 12 pairs, slightly prominent beneath, 5.5 to 6 in. long, 2.1 in. wide, petiole not\nwinged .5 in. long. Stipules coriaceous connate with short ovate points .25 in. long. Peduncle 1.75 in. bearing 3 pedunculate heads, peduncles thick .5 in. long.

I find on comparison does not belong to that species, but is an Erigeron allied to E. linifolius, Willd. a plant of unknown origin, to which it has also been referred, but it more distinctly fits the description of E. sumatrense, Retz., only known from his description however. It is a hairy weed from 3-6 feet tall. Leaves membranous lanceolate strongly sparsely toothed, gradually narrowed to the base of the petiole 3.5 in. long and .5 in. across. The upper leaves among the inflorescence-branches are linear 1 in. long .05 in. wide and entire. All are coarsely white; hairy. The terminal panicle is large, much branched and hairy. Heads in flower .1 in. long, yellowish on pedicels .25 in. long in fruit they are .4 in. across. The involucral bracts very narrow, hairy and shorter than the white pappus. The outer flowers are very narrow, 2 lipped with 2 minute staminodes quite sterile. The inner (disk) flowers tubular, whitish green, lobes acute, short sepaline hairs as long as the tube, anthers projecting brown-yellow turning brown after fall of pollen.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nI is a common weed in clearings, in Singapore, Johor, Pahang, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Dindings and Penang and also occurs in Siam, Java and the Philippines at Benguet (Loher 3615).\n\nIt is known as Sari Bulan and Sumbong Jantan.\n\n**Erigeron oreophilum**, n. sp.\n\nA simple unbranched leafy herb. 6-8 inches tall softly pubescent.

Heads racemose or with 1 or 2 short branches at the base of the raceme .1 in. long in flower .20 in. across in fruit, on short slender peduncles .12 in. long. The involucral bracts very narrow linear acuminate pubescent or glabrous, not imbricating. Outer florets with a minute oblong ligule. Achene unripe glabrous pappus white.\n\nPerak, Gunong Kerbau at 6,600 ft. (Robinson).\n\nReferred by me formerly to *E. linifolius*, but the foliage will not suit that plant as it seems to be always entire, and I do not think it can be a mountain form of that. It does not appear to be closely allied to any other species.\n\n**Vacciniaceae.**\n\n**Vaccinium ardisiflora**, Ridl.

The pedicels are also thicker and the corolla tube very short. The set of Palaquioms to which this species belongs are generally very scantily represented in herbaria on account of the immense height of the trees usually 80 ft. to the first branch and the small inconspicuous flowers.

M. polyantha, Miq. and M. elliptica, Hook. fil. Of the latter the Malay form is given as a variety *Scortechinii*, based on a plant of which I have only seen a poor specimen. It seems however, to be quite different from the Himalayan species M. elliptica and so I separate it as M. Scortechinii both leaves and flowers are considerably bigger than in Melliptica. M. polyantha, Miq. as described by King and Gamble appears to comprise at least 3 species exclusive of the true plant of Miquel.\n\nM. furcata, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nA rather stout climber, stems slightly angled.

(Robinson).\n\nI do not know any Dischidia as woody a shrub as this, the stem being quite stout with grey bark, the branchlets light green and herbaceous. The very thick racemes are quite sessile and floriferous from the base, the flowers falling off as the raceme grows.\n\nDischidia rosea, Ridl. Journ. Roy. As. Str. Br. p. 31.\n\nI find Schlechter has used this name for a Philippine plant a few years earlier. I therefore substitute the name rhodantha for rosea.\n\nDischidia astephana, King and Gamble. This plant is described as having white flowers, mainly on the strength of this apparently. Schlechter described his Conchophyllum angulatum as a distinct plant with red flowers. As a matter of fact the flowers are sealing-wax red entirely, except the spaces between the prominent ridges which are blue black.\n\nDischidia nummularia, Br. Prodr. Fl. Nov. Hall. i p. 461. On examining the type of this plant and the excellent original drawing of J. Miller in the British Museum Herbarium it is difficult to imagine how this plant could have been confused with the common Malayan plant so identified by most botanists to the present day. The true plant has ovate flat leaves somewhat like those of albida of Griffith, considerably larger umbels of white flowers tipped with yellowish apparently (certainly not scarlet as given by King and Gamble). It is confined as far as I know to North Australia. The leaves of the Malayan Peninsula plant are about a quarter of the size, elliptic to ovate in outline, very fleshy nearly as thick as they are wide, glaucous and mealy, usually yellow. The flowers are white, fewer and small than in nummularia. The plant seems to be quite identical with D. Gaydichaudii, Deene, and occurs through the Malay Islands to Ambon, and all through the Malay Peninsula to Tenasserim.\n\nLOGANIACEAE,\n\nFagraea (Cyrtophyllum) caudata, n. sp.\n\nA tree thirty feet tall, branches slender. Leaves coriaceous lanceolate caudate, base narrowed to the petiole and de-\ncurrent thereon, nerves about 4 pairs widely inarching .05-1 from the edge, slightly elevate beneath and nearly or quite invisible above, midrib sunk above, raised beneath, 4 in. long, 1 in. wide, petiole .5 in. long. Inflorescence axillary in upper axils and lower down, peduncle very slender 2 in. long bearing 3 flowers on pedicels as long and as slender. Calyx small .12 in. tube very short, lobes ovate subacute. Corolla yellow, tube narrow cylindric .4 in. long, limb .5 across, lobes ovate, rounded, .2 in. across. Stamens exsert about .4 in. beyond corolla. Style from base 1 in. long, filiform. Stigma small capitate.\n\nBorneo, Lobb 1853 in Herb. Kew. \"Tree 30 feet, yellow.\"\n\nThis species is allied to F. Wallichii of Penang Hill, differing in the more coriaceous lanceolate cordate leaves, and extremely slender peduncles and pedicels, cylindric corolla tube and shorter stamens. It would probably be best to keep up the genus Cyrtophyllum for the Tembusu trees, which differ so much from the epiphytic true Fagraeas with their fleshy leaves and flowers, and included stamens, from the tall trees with their leaves and flowers and long projecting stamens. The genus Cyrtophyllum would thus contain C. fragrans, Malay Peninsula to S. Siam and Cambodia, C. giganteum, Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, C. Wallichii, Penang, C. caudatum, Sumatra and Borneo, C. speciosum, Bl., Java and Borneo. This however, has much smaller flowers and thicker leaves.\n\nFagraea gigantea, Ridl. F. speciosa, Ridl. Journ. Roy. As. Soc. S. Br. 50, p. 122 not of Blume.\n\nSince writing my account of the Tembusu Fagraeas in Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Str. Br. vol. 50, I have seen at Kew specimens of the true F. speciosa, Bl. agreeing entirely with Blume's figure in Rumphia. It is quite a different plant from our Tembusu tembaga which is confined to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This plant is unnamed, and I therefore give it the name of Fagraea gigantea on account of the great size to which it attains. It is fully described in the Journal at the page quoted.\n\nGaertnera acuminata, Benth. Journ. Linn. Soc. i p. 112 was based on a plant collected by Wallich in Singapore (No. 8342). It was reduced to a variety of Koenigii of Ceylon, a much larger plant, with large leaves and flowers, by Clarke and following him by King and Gamble. It is obviously a different plant and I retain the name acuminata for it. Wallich also (8374) got a somewhat different looking plant narrower leaves in Singapore which he called Psychotria oxyphylla, Bentham separated this also into a distinct species G. oxyphylla.\nIt seems however, to pass into *G. acuminata* and had better perhaps be kept as a variety of that species. Besides these lowland plants we have a whole series of specimens from our mountain regions which differ in their more compact habit, more coriaceous leaves, dense cymes and short, thick pedicels. They seem to be mountain forms of *oxyphylla* and could be classed as sub var. *Montana*. An allied plant which was obtained by Mr. Robinson on Tampin hill, differs in having the flowers sessile in small heads, and a truncate corolla. This I propose to separate under the name of *G. sessiliflora*.\n\n**Gaertnera sessiliflora**, n. sp.\n\nA glabrous shrub. Leaves chartaceous, lanceolate acuminate, cuspidate, long narrowed at the base, nerves 7 pairs, slender, elevate beneath 4.5-5.5 in. long, 1.10-1.25 in. wide, petiole .1 in. long. Stipules forming a tube with 2 setaceous points .5 in. long. Cymes 3 of about 6-10 sessile flowers in dense heads .2 in. long, peduncle thick, .3 in. long.

The only plant at all resembling it is an undescribed species from Port Darwin in Australia collected by Mr. C. E. F. Allen, which may be named as follows:\n\n*M. australasica* apparently a submersed plant about 18 inches long. Leaves linear 18 in. long, .15 inches wide.

Marriott.\n\nAccompanying this note is a chart showing the times of sunrise and sunset at Singapore and Penang throughout the year.\n\nEach space on the chart represents horizontally an interval of five days and vertically one minute.\n\nA dotted curve shows the 'equation of time' (i.e. the difference between apparent solar time as indicated by a sun-dial and mean-time as recorded by the clock). Bearing in mind that by using the standard time of the 105th degree of longitude instead of that of our own longitude of 103\u00b0 50', our clocks in Singapore are 4 minutes 40 seconds ahead of the true time, this dotted line shows how very small is the variation due to our small northern latitude. In Penang the corresponding amount of 'daylight saving' is 18 minutes 36 seconds, but in addition there is quite an appreciable variation on account of latitude. In Singapore the difference between the lengths of the longest and shortest days in the year is only about 9 minutes, in Penang the difference is 36\u00bd minutes. At both places there are two maxima and two minima in the curves, but while in Singapore the longest evenings are in February and are entirely caused by the 'equation of time,' in Penang the effect of latitude is sufficient to make the evenings longer in July than in February.\n\nThe times calculated are the Singapore standard times at which the centre of the sun's disc is visible on the horizon to an observer at the sea level, allowance being made for the fact that owing to refraction the sun is visible when in reality it is 36' below the horizon.\nBegonia Haniffii, a small tuberous species of the Islands of Lankawi.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nIn 1896 Mr. Curtis obtained at Kasoom in the Siamese Malay States a tuberous Begonia which Mr. Ridley described in this Journal (No. 50, 1911, p. 106) as *Begonia Curtisii*. The new species here to be described is its counterpart from the islands of Lankawi. Both Kasoom and Lankawi are limestone regions, and both Begonias grow on the limestone rocks, dying down before November and surviving to February, when they sprout, by underground tubers.\n\n*Begonia Haniffii* was obtained some five years ago by Mr. Mohamed Haniff, and brought into the Waterfall Gardens, Penang, where it persists. From the underground tuber it attains a height at about eight inches; if a weak plant it may have one stem only; if a strong plant it may have up to six. These stems carry 2-4 leaves of which the largest appears to be one with the cordate half to the right of the midrib. The leaves in outline are as drawn here; they are of a dark green thickly covered with small silvery spots, each spot a patch of 40-100 air-containing cells often but not always around the base of a short air-containing hair. Such spots in this species often touch the larger veins. The stem is slightly translucent, crimson, with a little entangled dark hair here and there, but chiefly below: it zigzags at the nodes. The colour, translucency and slight hairiness extend to the petioles. The stipules are pale with a little of the crimson colour along their nerves. The flowers\nare segregated, the females occupying the best places, the males on lateral branches. The flowers are white with a slight amount of the crimson pigment along the veins. The male flowers may be \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch across and 1 inch from top to bottom. The stamens are about 120 in a globose cluster, not having the connective extended. The female flowers are 5-merous, about \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. across. The style bifurcates close to the base, and each half with a considerable amount of fullness ends in a dull yellow typically marginal stigma. The ovary has two cells with the placenta in each as two plates. The wings of the fruit outside these two cells make nearly equilateral triangles; but the unpaired wing is much elongated, and slightly hooked at the point. The surface of the capsule before maturity is somewhat mealy by reason of sloughing cells.\n\n*Begonia Haniffii*, species in sectione Platycentro, ad *B.

O. Winstedt.\n\nIt is well-known that a Malay raja when marrying a secondary wife of inferior rank often does not appear in person but is represented by his keris. As one might expect, this would appear to be a custom of Indian origin. Among the Tottiyans a caste of Telugu cultivators, who are probably descendants of the soldiers of the Nayakkan kings of Vijayanagar\u2014\"if a man belongs to a Zamindar's family, he is said to be of the Raja Kambala caste...... If a marriage is contracted with a woman of an inferior class, the bridegroom does not personally take part in the ceremony: a dagger (katlar) or rude sword is sent to represent him and the tali is tied in the presence thereof. In a Zamindar's suit, details of which are published in the Madras Law Reports, Vol. XVII, 1894 the judge found that the plaintiff's mother was married to the plaintiff's father in the dagger form; that a dagger is used by the Saptrur Zamindars who are called Kattari Kamaya, in the case of inequality in the caste or social position of the bride; that though the customary rites of the Kambala caste were also performed, yet the use of the dagger was an essential addition; and that though she was of a different and inferior caste to that of the plaintiff's father, yet that did not invalidate the marriage.\" (E. Thurston's Castes and Tribes of Southern India, Vol. VII, p. 190).\nDiet Nutrition and Excretion of the Asiatic Races in Singapore.\n\nNo. 2. MANUAL WORKERS.\n\nBy J. ARGYLL CAMPBELL.\n\nThis is the continuation of the work published in August, 1917, when the diet, nutrition and excretion of the local medical students were dealt with (1). In the present paper, manual workers are under observation.\n\nAs might be expected considerable difficulty has been experienced in obtaining material from labourers, but with the faithful co-operation of several of the medical students and of others, a number of analyses were possible. It is hoped that more will be done in the future.\n\nMETHODS.\n\nKidney Excretions.\u2014The same methods were employed for the estimations of nitrogen, ammonia, urca and chloride, as those used in the previous research (1).\n\nIn addition, quantitative estimations of the phosphates and uric acid were carried out. Phosphates were estimated by titration with uranium nitrate in a solution of acetic acid, which precipitates all the phosphate. The end reaction is either the brown colour which is produced by an excess of uranium nitrate in the presence of potassium ferrocyanide or the green colour formed by tincture of cochineal with a surplus of uranium nitrate.\n\nThe Hopkins-W\u00f6rner method was used to estimate the amount of uric acid present.\n\nDiet.\u2014In some cases details, of the kinds and amounts of food allowed to their workers, were obtained from employers.\n\nIn other cases it was possible to weigh the food before each meal.\n\nThe compositions of the foods and their heat values have been taken from standard books on the subject (2).\n\nVARIOUS WORKERS.\n\nChinese Bakers.\u2014Two Chinese bakers, employed by the father of one of the students, supplied material for eight observations. The average figures for the kidney excretions will be seen in Table I. The amount was scanty, 807 c.c. This was due to perspiration\nwhilst in the bakery. The total nitrogen was 8.3 grammes. The ammonia, 1.04 grammes, was high and therefore, so was the ammonia co-efficient, 10.3%. The reason for this is not clear. Probably further experiments will elucidate the problem. The amount of chloride was 5.1 grammes and of uric acid 0.48 gramme.\n\nThe diet consisted of rice with small quantities of pork, beef and fish.\n\n*Tamil Gardeners.*\u2014Fourteen observations were made from material furnished by two Tamil gardeners, working at the Medical School Hostel. The average amounts of kidney excretions were nitrogen 7.2 grammes, urea 13.4, uric acid 0.49, ammonia 0.73, chloride 7 and phosphate 1.25 (Table I). Their average weight was 101 lbs. and their average age 23\u00bd years. The average diet consisted of bread 224 grammes, condensed milk 2, sugar 12, butter 13, boiled rice 1376, fish 84, green vegetables 213. This contains 76 grammes of protein, 19 of fat and 468 of carbohydrate. The heat value is 2407 kilocalories. Judging from their nitrogen excretion they metabolised only 45 grammes of protein, so that they did not metabolise all their food (Table II).\n\n*Malay Gardener.*\u2014This man worked at the school; two observations were made with his kidney excretions. His average figures were nitrogen 7.9 grammes, urea 15, uric acid 0.6, ammonia 0.61, chloride 5 and phosphate 1.5 (Table I). Rice was his chief food, but no details were obtained. He weighed 120 lbs.\n\n*Chinese Rickshaw Runner.*\u2014This runner was employed privately by the author. One specimen of kidney excretion was obtained when a full day\u2019s running (about 15 miles) was done. His figures were, nitrogen 9.8 grammes, urea 20.4 uric acid 0.54, ammonia 1.06, chloride 2 and phosphate 1.8 (Table I). His diet consisted chiefly of rice with small quantities of beef, pork and fish, but no details were obtained.\n\n*Chinese Rubber Estate Coolies.*\u2014Five weavers and tappers working on a local rubber estate, owned by a student\u2019s father, supplied material for fifteen observations. On an average they excreted by the kidney 10.4 grammes of nitrogen, which is equivalent to the metabolism of 65 grammes of protein. Their daily allowance of food contained 86 grammes of protein, 17 grammes of fat and 611 grammes of carbohydrate, the diet being rice (weighed uncooked) 728 grammes, pork 14, fat 7, fish 112, dried peas 56, green vegetables 224. This gives a heat value of 3015 kilocalories (Table II). It is evident that they did not metabolise all this allowance, only 65 out of 86 grammes of protein in the food being accounted for in the kidney excretion.\n\nThe figures for the other excretion were urea 19.4 grammes, uric acid 0.65, ammonia 1.09, chloride 6.6 and phosphate 1.78 (Table I). The average age was 32 years and the average weight 122 lbs.\nChinese Prisoners.\u2014Six first class prisoners at the gaol were next employed, under the supervision of the assistant surgeon. They furnished material for 36 observations. Their daily diet, which is fixed by statute and which is considered to be generous for local labourers, consists of cocoanut oil 28 grammes, fresh meat (with bone) 112, rice (weighed uncooked) 448, salt 7, fish (with bone) 84, vegetables 336 and bread 112. This contains 84 grammes of protein, 50 of fat and 432 of carbohydrate, the heat value being 2580 kilocalories.\n\nThe average age of the prisoners was 40 years and the average weight 137 lbs. The average length of time on the above diet was 3 years 4 months. The prisoners were all employed in the prison kitchen. Before their confinement they were variously employed\u2014fisherman, rubber estate coolie, tapioca estate coolie, bullock cart driver, shopkeeper and shop coolie.\n\nThe average figures for the kidney excretions were nitrogen 11.4 grammes, urea 21, uric acid 0.43, ammonia 0.75, chloride 5.5 and phosphate 1.8 (Table I).\n\nJudging from the nitrogen excretion they metabolised on an average only 71.2 of the 84 grammes of protein of the food. (Table II).\n\nCommentary.\n\nLooking at the average figures for the kidney excretions (Table I) it will be seen that there is considerable variation for different occupations, after making allowance for the weight. The amount of nitrogen excreted per kilogram of body weight is shown in one column of Table I. The average figures usually given in text books of Physiology for Europeans in Europe are appended. These figures are the standard figures used for teaching purposes, and the figures for manual labourers in Europe are higher than these. A glance will show that the figures for the nitrogen and urea are much lower in the case of the Asiatic labourer in Singapore. This is due to the fact that he metabolises less protein than the European. He also has less energy. Our local gardeners cannot be regarded as hard workers from a European point of view. The estate coolies and rickshaw runner rank amongst our hardest muscular workers. McCay (3) has shown that a European possesses better physique and greater muscular energy than an Asiatic because the former metabolises a larger quantity of protein. Looking at Table II it will be seen that my figures support this view. The average figure for a European doing moderate labour in Europe is 125 grammes, whereas 71.2 is the highest figure obtained in my experiments with the local labourer. On the other hand the carbohydrate part of the diet is increased in amount, relatively and absolutely, in the case of the Asiatic.\n\nJudging from the amount of protein of the diet, accounted for in the kidney excretion the calorific value of the Asiatic labourer\u2019s metabolised food (Table II) is a good deal below that of the European, allowance being made for the difference in weight.\nThe former does less work. Gentlemen, who have controlled labour both in this city and in Europe, have no doubt that the European labourer has better physique and is capable of heavier work than the tropical Asiatic. Undoubtedly climate plays an important part in this matter. The continuous heat and moisture of the atmosphere in Singapore, do not readily allow escape of heat from the body. Work and food increase body heat, so that the natural remedy is to lessen these. One does occasionally see coolies doing very heavy work but they do not keep this up for any length of time.\n\nReturning to Table I, it will be observed that the uric acid, phosphate and chloride are also present in smaller quantities in the local labourer's kidney excretion than in that of the European. This is due to the fact that the diet of the former contains smaller quantities of the substances from which these are derived.\n\nIn all cases the ammonia co-efficient for the local Asiatic is higher than that of the European. This is due to the fact that the former excretes a smaller amount of nitrogen.\n\nNo reference has been made to the nitrogen excreted by the skin. This is not sufficient to interfere greatly with the results obtained.\n\nConclusions.\n\nI. As far as these experiments go, the figures obtained show that on the whole the amounts of kidney excretions for local labourers differ considerably from the standard amounts given for Europeans in Europe.\n\nII. The total nitrogen varies from 7.2 to 11.4 grammes, the urea from 13.4 to 21, the uric acid from 0.43 to 0.65, the ammonia from 0.61 to 1.09, the chloride from 2 to 7, and the phosphate from 1.25 to 1.8.\n\nIII. The local labourer uses less protein and fat, but more carbohydrate than the European. The metabolised food of the former has a smaller calorific value. Two reasons, closely connected with one another may be given for this. They live in a continuously hot and moist climate. They do less work.\n\nThe author is indebted to the following for assistance in this work\u2014V. Gopalan, Lee Kek Soon, V.

The Royal Asiatic Society has its headquarters at 22 Albemarle Street, London, W., where it has a large library of books, and MSS. relating to oriental subjects, and holds monthly meetings from November to June (inclusive) at which papers on such subjects are read.\n\n2. By rule 105 of this Society all the Members of Branch Societies are entitled when on furlough or otherwise temporarily resident within Great Britain, and Ireland, to the use of the Library as Non-Resident Members and to attend the ordinary monthly meetings of this Society. This Society accordingly invites Members of Branch Societies temporarily resident in Great Britain or Ireland to avail themselves of these facilities and to make their home addresses known to the Secretary so that notice of the meetings may be sent to them.\n\n3. Under rule 84, the Council of the Society is able to accept contributions to its Journal from Members of Branch Societies, and other persons interested in Oriental Research, of original articles, short notes, etc., on matters connected with the languages, archaeology, history, beliefs and customs of any part of Asia.\n\n4. By virtue of the afore-mentioned Rule 105 all Members of Branch Societies are entitled to apply for election to the Society without the formality of nomination. They should apply in writing to the Secretary, stating their names and addresses, and mentioning the Branch Society to which they belong. Election is by the Society upon the recommendation of the Council.\n\n5. The subscription for Non-Resident Members of the Society is 30/- per annum. They receive the quarterly journal post free.\n\nAsiatic Society of Bengal. Members of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, by a letter received in 1903, are accorded the privilege of admission to the monthly meetings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, which are held usually at the Society's house, 1 Park Street, Calcutta.\nHindustani, Tamil, Sanskrit and other loan words in Malay.\n\nBy A. W. Hamilton.\n\nIn this paper I have collected a list of Malay words whose derivations have not been given in R. J. Wilkinson's Malay-English Dictionary, but all of which are to be found in any good Hindustani Dictionary with the exception of the few words I have marked 'Tamil.' When this list is taken in conjunction with those published already by R. O. Winstedt in this Journal, and the Hindustani derivations mentioned in R. J. Wilkinson's Dictionary and elsewhere; and it is borne in mind that practically all Malay words of Persian origin and a very large number of those of Sanskrit and Arabic origin are also to be found in Hindustani, it becomes an open question as to how far these words have been incorporated into Malay through the medium of Hindustani and not from their direct sources.\n\nIn case some of the Tamil and other words should not prove very familiar to some readers I should add that they are current in Penang which has a large admixture of Indian blood in its native Malay population, and has always had a very close connection with Southern India ever since it's foundation.\n\nI am very much indebted to Mr. R. O. Winstedt for looking over this list and pointing out those words whose derivations have already been noted by Dutch authorities.\n\nadu contest: reference to a tribunal.\n\n[madu\u2014a rival wife\u2014derived from the same source].\n\naleja a kind of cloth.\n\nalmari a wardrobe: a cupboard.\n\n*amah a nursemaid\u2014especially Chinese.\n\n*amil the title of a government official in Riau.\n\n*ayah a nursemaid\u2014especially Indian.\n\nandika descent; hereditary dignity.\n\n'adu (Ar.) an enemy: foe.\n\nil\u00e2ch\u00e2 (H.

Fullaway,\nEntomologist, Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry.\n\nIn the course of a search for natural enemies of the cane borer (Rhabdocnemis obscura), conducted by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters in the years 1906-1911, an extensive collection of insects was made by Mr. Frederick Muir, field entomologist on the Planters' Experiment Station staff, as well as by the late Frank W. Terry, assistant entomologist, who also had part in the field work. The Braconidae from this collection were referred to the writer for study, and the present paper describes some of the new genera and species appearing in the collection, the types of which remain in the H.

Argyll Campbell.\n\nThese records have been taken from the same subject with the same clinical thermometers during residence in various climates\u2014Scotland, Malaya, Java and Australia. They cover a period of six years.\n\nIt is well known that, so delicate is the heat regulating system of man, his temperature is only slightly influenced by the temperature of his surroundings. This fact is shown by records of temperature in the Tropics and in the Arctic regions. By wearing appropriate clothing and living in suitable quarters the temperature remains practically the same.\n\nIn this paper the temperature of the well-closed and dry axilla is taken as a guide to the temperature of the body. The temperature of the mouth as well as the wet and dry bulb readings for the atmosphere are also given. Observations were made in the same room always, in each case. The thermometers were left in situ for four minutes. With the clinical thermometers employed, this was found to be sufficient, although Pembrey (1) says \"in order to obtain accurate results the thermometer should be retained for eight minutes in the mouth and eleven minutes in the well-closed and dry axilla.\"\n\nMeals were taken as follows, morning tea between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., breakfast between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., lunch between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., afternoon tea between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., dinner between 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m., except in the case of the Blue Mountains where the evening meal was taken between 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. There is a rise in temperature after a meal (2).\n\nExercise\u2014walking, golf or tennis\u2014was taken fairly regularly. The letter E on the charts denotes exercise. Exercise produces a rise in temperature, which disappears soon after cessation of the exercise (3).\n\nStandard works state that, speaking generally, the temperature rises during the morning and the afternoon, but falls during the evening and early part of the morning (4).\n\nIn the present work all the records are comparable as regards daily routine. They were taken during holidays.\n\nThe subject is a thin healthy man aged 34 years, 5 ft. 9 ins. in height and 10 stone 4 lbs. in weight.\n\nThe readings are given in Fahrenheit scale.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 80, 1919.\nRecords in Various Climates.\n\nEdinburgh, Scotland.\u2014During residence in Edinburgh, the temperature in the axilla averaged $97^\\circ$ (Chart I). This was the case for at least eight years. This axillary temperature is much below the mean daily temperature of the average man, which is usually given as $98.45^\\circ$ (3). The low temperature is explained by the fact that the subject has a normal temperature below the average. The records given on Chart I. were taken during residence at a hospital in Edinburgh. The mean annual atmospheric temperature for Edinburgh is $47.7^\\circ$.\n\nBungalow No. I. Singapore.\u2014This bungalow is situate on a hill, about 150 feet above the sea. It looks out over the harbour and nearly always enjoys a cool breeze. Whilst in this bungalow the subject very rarely felt uncomfortably hot. On these occasions there was no breeze. On Chart II it will be seen that the average axillary temperature was $97.1^\\circ$, practically the same figure as for Edinburgh. The mouth temperature averaged $97.7^\\circ$. It occasionally fell below that of the axilla. This was probably due to mouth-breathing, the subject suffering fairly frequently from nasal catarrh. The mouth is always liable to considerable local variation of temperature, but the axilla is not.\n\nIt was observed that an axillary temperature of $97.6^\\circ$ produced discomfort.\n\nThe average wet and dry bulb readings were $76.3^\\circ$ and $81.4^\\circ$ respectively, the atmosphere being warm and moist.\n\nOrdinary white ducks with light woollen vests were worn. Ninety nine people out of a hundred in Singapore wear white ducks or very similar clothing. This is sufficient proof of their comfort to the ordinary individual. Some object to them because of the glare. Wearing dark coloured spectacles will overcome this trouble.\n\nLembang, Java.\u2014On Chart III are given records of nine days' residence at Lembang, 4000 feet above the sea. The average axillary and mouth temperatures were $96.7^\\circ$ and $97.2^\\circ$ respectively, the subject, feeling comfortably cool. The atmospheric temperature was fairly low, the readings being $64.7^\\circ$ for the wet bulb and $69.1^\\circ$ for the dry bulb. Warm clothing was worn during the evenings.\n\nBetween the hours 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., the hottest time of the day it was occasionally uncomfortable, the axillary temperature being $97.6^\\circ$ or more.\n\nBungalow No. II. Singapore.\u2014During succeeding years the subject experienced several uncomfortably hot bungalows. Chart IV. gives the records taken in such a bungalow. The average axillary temperature was $97.6^\\circ$. This caused discomfort. It will be seen that as far as atmospheric temperature and moisture were\nconcerned the conditions were similar to those given for Bungalow No. I. The wet and dry bulb readings were 76.3\u00b0 and 81.4\u00b0 respectively for No. I., and 76.7\u00b0 and 81.5\u00b0 respectively for No. II. Why then did No. II feel much hotter? Because it is situate almost on sea level, and it is closely surrounded on three sides by hills and dwellings. The fourth side is not open, but the hills and dwellings here are further off and very rarely a breeze finds its way in by this side. There were no electric fans; had these been available the conditions would have been much improved. Heat is lost by radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation. The skin and respiratory tract are especially concerned. Radiation, conduction and convection from the body are lessened in a warm atmosphere; and a moist atmosphere retards evaporation; but a breeze aids conduction and convection and cools the skin. Therefore, in our warm and moist climate, maximum use should be made of any breeze that is available and hill sites should be chosen for bungalows. All buildings should be supplied with electric fans.\n\nTaiping Hill, Perak. Chart V shows the records obtained during a holiday on this comfortable hill-station 3,400 feet above sea level. Only once or twice, for short periods, did the subject feel uncomfortably hot and on these occasions the axillary temperature was 97.6\u00b0 or more. The average wet and dry bulb readings were 68.7\u00b0 and 71.3\u00b0 respectively. The average axillary temperature was 96.9\u00b0 and the average mouth temperature 98.1\u00b0. Fires and warm clothing were employed after 5 p.m.\n\nKatoomba, Blue Mountains, Australia.\u2014Several months were spent near Katoomba, 2,300 feet above the sea. Some few days were fairly hot, but on the whole the weather was wet and cool, the wet bulb average being 66.2\u00b0 and the dry bulb 67.6\u00b0. The average axillary temperature was 97.2\u00b0 and the average mouth temperature was 97.8\u00b0. Warm clothing and fires were used frequently.\n\nSummary.\n\nIt will be seen from Chart VII that so long as the axillary temperature of the subject, under observation, was about 97\u00b0, he felt comfortable. A rise to 97.6\u00b0 produced an uncomfortably hot feeling. For each person there will be similar temperatures, varying slightly in each case.\n\nIt is of interest to note that in the breezy bungalow No. I. Singapore, the axillary temperature was about the same as that given for various cooler climates. A bungalow properly built, equipped and placed in Singapore, offers very comfortable conditions. In our warm and moist climate maximum use should be made of any available breeze and hill sites should be chosen for residences. There is no doubt that, in unfavourably placed residences, the temperature of the body is higher than it should be. It may be only slightly higher, but this is sufficient to produce considerable discomfort and in time, considerable damage to health.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 80, 1919.\nO\u2019Connell (6), in discussing the etiology of malaria, points out that hot, moist and still air has a good deal to do with outbreaks of this disease. It is well known that, in badly ventilated factories at home, this atmospheric condition causes a definite rise of temperature, great discomfort and a weakening of the system. O\u2019Connell also quotes, H. M. Chief Inspector of Factories\u2014\u201cThe general opinion I have formed from the detailed study of the observations (in the cotton sheds) is that a rise of mouth temperature makes itself felt when the wet bulb (temperature of the air) exceeds 75\u00b0 F.\u201d In my records it will be observed that 75\u00b0 was exceeded in both bungalows No. I. and No. II.; but in bungalow No. I the cool breeze, by aiding conduction and convection of heat, counteracted the ill effects of the excessive heat and moisture, thus producing bodily comfort. In bungalow No. II. the absence of a breeze caused great discomfort; electric fans would have improved conditions.\n\nThe chances of a breeze in the thickly populated areas of this town are small and undoubtedly our unfavourable atmospheric conditions\u2014heat and moisture\u2014are free to exert their greatest ill in these quarters. Our high death rate shows that they do so.\n\nReferences.\n\n1. Pembrey M. S. Text Book of Physiology, Vol. I, edited by E. A. Sch\u00e4fer, page 786.\n2. Ibid, page 809.\n3. Ibid, page 806.\n4.

T. Dussek.\n\nWhile reading Dr. C. Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s book, \u2018The Acehnese\u2019 (the late Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s translation), I came across some notes on a game called \u2018main pacheh,\u2019 and on enquiring I found that the game is well known among Penang Malays. The board used, however, and the scoring are so different as to be worthy of record.\n\nI attach diagrams and short notes in order to point the contrast.\n\nMain Pacheh.\n\nThe Aceh Game.\n\nThis game can be played by 2, 3, or 4 persons, each player sitting at one extremity of the cross-shaped board, (see Diagram 1).\n\nEach player has four pieces which at the commencement of the game he places in the central circle i.e. opposite A, B, C, D, respectively.\n\nThe idea of the game is similar to our children\u2019s race-games, all the pieces having to career round the board, and the player all of whose pieces reach home first wins the game. [The course to be taken by one of C\u2019s pieces is dotted in the diagram].\n\nThe players throw by turn with seven cowrie shells, which must fall with the opening either upward or downward, and score as follows:\n\n| Shells | Score |\n|--------|-------|\n| 7      | 14*   |\n| 6      | 30*   |\n| 5      | 25*   |\n| 4      | 4     |\n| 3      | 3     |\n| 2      | 2     |\n| 1      | 10    |\n\n* Secures an extra throw.\n\nAfter each throw a player moves any one of his pieces (at his own selection) over a number of squares equal to the number of his throw.\n\nA great point of the game is to try and \u2018pukul\u2019 an opponent i.e. to reach a square on which an opponent is already standing, in which case the opponent\u2019s piece has to go back to the starting point.\n\nThe only squares on which two or more pieces are allowed to stand at one and the same time are those marked X. On such squares no penalties are incurred by any piece.\n\n[Note.\u2014I find that the game is too slow, and to brighten things up a bit we use 8 shells, score as above, with the addition of\n\n| Shells | Score |\n|--------|-------|\n| 8      | 50*   |\n| 8      | 40    |]\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 80, 1919.\nMain Pacheh.\n\nThe Penang Game.\n\nThis game can be played by 2, 3, or 4 persons, each player sitting at one of the four points A, B, C, D (see diagram 2).\n\nEach player has four pieces which at the commencement of the game he places in the crossed square facing his position: these four squares opposite A, B, C, D, are the respective starting points.\n\nThe course to be taken by one of B\u2019s pieces is dotted in the diagram. It seems rather confusing in its twists and turns, but the Malays do not seem to find it so.\n\nThe players throw by turn with four cowrie shells and score as follows:\n\n| Shells Opening Upwards | Score |\n|------------------------|-------|\n| 4                      | 4*    |\n| 3                      | 3     |\n| 2                      | 2     |\n| 1                      | 1     |\n| 4                      | 8*    |\n\n* Secures an extra throw.\n\nThe method of procedure is exactly the same as in the Acehnese variety; a square marked (X) has the same meaning, and a piece which is caught (pukul) must go back to its starting point.\n\n[Note.\u2014I find that this game also is tedious, and hasten things by introducing 5 shells, scoring as before with the addition of\n\n| Shells Opening Upwards | Score |\n|------------------------|-------|\n| 5                      | 12*   |\n| 5                      | 12    |\n\nJour.

A generally places his first piece as in diagram 3, it being considered worth while to separate the 'harimau' at the sacrifice of a piece.\n\nA is allowed to place his pieces one by one at any of the points on the board, endeavouring all the time to enclose the two 'harimau' completely.\n\nIn order to try and avoid being hemmed in, X is allowed to move either of his pieces any distance he pleases along any of the parallel or diagonal lines passing through that piece's position, provided that none of the intervening spaces are occupied.\n\ne.g. in diagram 3, X may move one of his pieces from P to any one of Q, R, S, T, etc.:\u2014\n\nX is further allowed to take the 'kambing' and this is done exactly as in draughts (English variety, not Malay). The dotted line in diagram 3, shows X ('harimau') capturing A ('kambing'). The 'kambing,' of course, is removed from the board.\n\nIf A's 24 pieces are exhausted and the 'harimau' are not hemmed in, then A has lost.\n\nDiagram 4 shows a defeat of the 'harimau.'\nOn a Collection of Birds\n\nfrom\n\nN.

Sumatra, has recently entrusted us with a collection of birds made by him in that and neighbouring districts. The collection is so large that it merits listing in detail, and we therefore have prepared the following account of it.\n\nThe literature dealing with the area is fairly considerable, but to economize space we have only quoted the list given by Hartert (Novitates Zoologicae, IX, pp. 194-220 (1903), and our own paper on the avifauna of Korinchi where a more detailed synonymy will be found (Journ.

VIII, part II, 1918).\n\nWe have had occasion to describe four new forms in this paper, viz.,\n\nMacropygia ruficeps sumatranus.\nBrachylophus chlorolophus vanheysti.\nCyornis vanheysti.\nBuchanga leucophaea batakensis.\n\nwhile four species which have not hitherto been recorded from Sumatra,\n\nCollocalia linchi cyanoptila, Oberholser.\nCollocalia innominata, Hume.\nGeocichla citrina citrina (Lath.).\nMachaeramphus alcinus, Westerm.\n\nwere also obtained by Heer van Heyst who has supplied the following account of the various localities whence his collection was derived.\n\nLaboean Deli. On the coast with the ordinary mangrove forest.\n\nPolonia Estate, Deli. A tobacco estate in flat country not exceeding 20 metres (65 ft.) in altitude. Large fallows overgrown with lalang or secondary jungle. When in July the tobacco crop has been gathered, rice is grown on the fields until March. After that the land lies fallow for seven or eight years. The secondary jungle attains a height of about 24 feet and is very thick. There\nis also a certain amount of arable land besides the tobacco as well as kampong land and a little swampy country. Throughout the country are scattered lofty trees (toalang).\n\nMabar Estate. Similar country, about 15 metres (50 feet).\n\nHelvetia Estate\n\nTandjong Morawa in the Serdang district is somewhat more undulating land up to about 30 metres (100 ft.) with a strip of primaeval forest along the Batang Koeuris (the stream forming the boundary between the Deli and Serdang districts where most of the birds were collected).\n\nDeli Toewa Estate. In the Deli District on hilly country ranging up to about 200 metres (650 feet). Most of the birds were collected in primaeval forest at the south side of the estate.\n\nToentoengan Estate. Like Deli Toewa, height ranging up to about 150 metres (480 feet).\n\nGambir. An old tobacco estate now in lalang and secondary jungle with some old forest.\n\nBandar Baroe, Deli Dist. A mountainous district about 860 metres (2800 ft.) consisting of rubber estates and primaeval jungle.\n\nBrastagi in the Simeloengan District in parts mountainous and partly plateau land, height 1,390 metres (4,520 ft.), Brastagi is on the Karo Plateau which is undulating country overgrown with lalang. Near the kampongs the Battaks cultivate rice and potatoes. Most of the birds were collected in forest along the south sides of the Sibajak Mountains.\n\nTengkeh. Mountainous country somewhat below Brastagi at the foot of the Dolok Baros: old primaeval jungle.\n\nBoeloe in Serdang District: flat low country.\n\nTandjong Selamat. A rubber estate in the Langkat District with primaeval jungle in the vicinity.\n\nPHASIANIDAE.\n\n1. Arboricola rolli, Rothschild.\n\nBull. Brit. Orn. Club XXV, p. 7 (1909).\n\n? juv.

Sumatra, 27th June 1918 [No. 1035].\n\nThe first bird is little more than a chick and has the head still in down so that its identification is a matter of considerable uncertainty. The bill in life would appear to have been red at the tip as in *A. rubrirostris* but there is a large patch of silky white feathers on the ear coverts, characteristic of *A. rolli*, so we have determined it as that species.\nThe second bird is an adult male, undoubtedly of this species, though it does not quite agree with the description of the type, differing as follows. Upper lores grey, superciliary stripe black posteriorly, the feathers with white bases. A narrow black band starting at the nostrils completely surrounding the eye. Beneath this, starting at the chin, a broad silky white band ending at the ear coverts, which are silky white; this again is bordered by a black band. The feathers in the centre of the throat black with white bases and ultimately white with black tips. A clearly defined narrow black band separating the black and white throat from the olive brown breast. Wing 142 mm., tail 57, tarsus 44, bill from gape 26 mm.\n\n2. **Excalfactoria chinensis chinensis** (Linn.).\n\nSalvad., Bull. Mus. Torin. XI, p. 12 (1896); Hartert, Nov. Zool.

They differ from the insular form *E. c. lineata* (Scop.) which is recorded from S. & W.

We have had before us over seventy specimens from the various localities and after eliminating all birds that are in the slightest degree immature find that the Javan bird, which is the typical *M. r. ruficeps*, can be distinguished at a glance by the almost total absence of black lateral spots on the feathers of the breast. The Bornean bird *M. r. nana* differs from the Javan in having large black lateral spots on the crop feathers and in having the back and mantle very much darker.\n\nThe Sumatran birds differ from the Bornean in having the head a paler cinnamon buff and the back much more barred; the amythystine gloss on the side of the neck and\nmantle much reduced, but the green glossy barring much more marked. The white tips to the feathers of the breast are much reduced and the black markings are much more pronounced.\n\n**Type.** Adult male. Gunong Talaman, 1300 m. (4250 ft.) Ophir district, W.

In size and in the character of the white stripes on the under surface, which are not very conspicuous, they are nearest the former; in their upper surface which is darker, with the head rather greyer forming a quite perceptible cap they are closest to *N. s. scutulata*, which is a migratory form. Possibly these specimens represent a resident Sumatran race. For the present we place them with *N. s. malaccensis* on account of their size.\n\n34.

On the whole, however, there is less white than in Malayan and more white than in West Sumatran specimens. Of the large number of specimens available from all localities, those of Borneo certainly have least, and those from the Northern Malayan Peninsula most. Unless a new name is to be given to these birds, which is undesirable, their position can be best expressed by the somewhat cumbrous nomenclature used by Stresemann as *Cymorhynchus macrorhynchus lemniscatus malaccensis*, Salvad.\n\nHIRUNDINIDAE.\n\n113.

In this we were incorrect as we find that a specimen collected by Martin in 1894 from an unspecified locality has been recorded by Parrot (Abhandl. der Konigl. Aayer. Akad. der Wissensch. II. Kl. XXIV, Bd. 1. p. 239 (1907)). This author noted certain apparent differences between this specimen and descriptions and other specimens from West Java and gave it the provisional name of *Pycnonotus aurigaster martini*.\n\nComparison of Mr. Van Heyst's two skins with eleven freshly collected specimens from East and West Java show no difference whatever between the birds from the two islands either in size or colour.\n\n211. **Bhringa remifer** (Temm.).\n\nantea, p. 54.\n\nOur name *Bhringa remifer attenuata* for the Malayan form of this Drongo has been antedated by Mr. Stuart Baker who has described birds from Telom, Perak\u2014Pahang boundary, collected by ourselves, as *Bhringa remifer peracensis* (Bull. Brit. Orn. Club XXXIX, p. 18 (November 30th 1918)).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 80, 1919.\nSome More Malay Words.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nI venture to suggest Sanskrit derivations for\u2014\n\nMalini, in the name Wan Malini in the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu, the name of one of the daughters of D\u0113mang Lebar Daun. Malini (Skt.) = 'garlanded.'\n\nSiamang 'the black long-armed Gibbon, Symphalangus syndactylus.' Dutch dictionaries throw no light on the word. This ape occurs only in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, but must have struck the attention of strangers. May it not have acquired a Skt. name in the days of Hindu predominance? Sy\u0101ma = 'black,' and sy\u0101m\u0101nga 'black-bodied.'\n\nEnglish dictionaries have not made it clear that in the name ular chintamani 'a snake which brings success in love?' chintamani = the 'wishgem,' the Hindu 'philosopher's stone,' said to have belonged to Brahma, who is himself sometimes called by the name.\n\nKedah is sometimes called Zamin Turan. In Persian Zamin = 'country' and Toran 'Tartary' or 'Turkestan.' Probably the name is due to wilful or unintelligent identification of Kedah with some place mentioned in an Hikayat.\n\nSimilarly Perak is called Kustan Zor\u012ban. Possibly Zor\u012ban is a corruption of the word Zuzan, an ancient city in Khuzistan. But anyhow the name Kustan Zor\u012ban is likely to be due to some 'romantic' identification.\n\nM\u0113ny\u0113roka 'to open up a country, making rice-fields.' N.S. m\u0113nch\u0113laga:\u2014'orang m\u0113nch\u0113laga' = 'person next in succession to an office, heir (bakal).'\n\nThese two are Negri Sembilan words, the first in common use; the second found in Ulu Muar.\n\nM\u0113ndiang 'become a spirit,' a Selangor word said to have a Sumatran origin.\n\nL\u0113nggara, kel\u0113nggara 'to cherish, tend?' \"Akan Raja Fatimah tiada-lah kel\u0113nggarakan anakanda baginda Raja Abd\u016bl-Jalil itu lagi\" S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu (Rom. ed.), Vol. II, p. 260.\n\n\u0113ndul (cf. Khassi do\u014d-do\u014d) 'a swing support, a hammock, cradle' = Skt. hindola 'a swing, a swinging cradle or hammock.' (\"Le handoul qui es semblable \u00e0 une liti\u00e8re, soutenu sur les \u00e9paules\"\u2014Kitab Ajaib a'l-Hind, 1013 A.D.).\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 80, 1919.\nandor 'a litter, a machine with four arms in which images or reliques of the saints are borne in processions.' This word is evidently from Skt. hindola in the form han-dul, but it is hard to say if Portuguese borrowed andor from Malay or the contrary.\n\n(redi 'a sort of hammock-litter':\u2014Wilkinson. P. della Valle (1614-1626) describes three kinds of shoulder-borne vehicles in use at Goa (1) reti or nets, which were evidently the simple hammock, (2) andor and (3) the palankin. I have not discovered from what language redi is derived).\n\nb\u0113rahi 'passion, love'\u2014Skt. virahi (cf. Khassi br\u0101i).\n\nbahara 'a weight = 3 pikul'\u2014Skt. bhara 'a load.'\n\nmas 'gold': 1/6th of a tahil'\u2014? Skt. masha 'a bean, a particular weight of gold.'\n\nm\u0113ngkona 'tuskless, of an elephant'\u2014Skt. matkuna 'a bug, a flea, a beardless man, a tuskless elephant.' Hind. makha.\n\ns\u0113nggirek, rusa s\u0113nggirek 'unicorn.' May not this be a corruption of Hind. singhara, Skt. sr\u012bnga 'a horn?'\n\nbangsal 'cooly lines, shed.' A very early Anglo-Indian word, suggested by Yule and Burnell to be a corruption of one of the following:\n\n(a) Beng. bankasala from Skt. banik 'trade' and sala 'a hall.'\n\n(b) Skt. bhandasala, Malayalim pandisala 'a storehouse or magazine.'\n\nIn Sea Hindustani bansar and bangsal = 'store room.'\n\nbaldi 'a horse-bucket,' 'metal bucket or foot-bath.' Wilkinson gives this as Hindustani, but the Hind. form is balti and borrowed from the Portuguese balde.\n\ns\u0113rambi 'a closed verandah.'\u2014Malayalim srambi 'a gate-house with a room over the gate, a chamber raised on four posts.'\n\nchukai 'import customs dues'\u2014Hind. chauki 'a toll-station, lock-up (cf. our 'choky'), dues levied.' Chauki is said to be connected with Skt. chator 'four' (in Malay = 'chess') and if so, may explain the Malay game chuki 'a kind of draughts.'\n\nchunam 'prepared lime' used in the betel-quid. Skt. chur-na 'powder': Hind. chuna: Malayalim chunnamba. Chunam is the form of the old English \"trade\" name, common in India.\n\nchita 'chintz.' Wilkinson derives from the Hindustani, but the forms are 'chita Port., Mahr. chit, Hind. chint,' all, it is suggested by Yule and Burnell, derived from Skr. chitra 'variegated, speckled.' Like baldi, this word would seem to have reached the Malays through the Portuguese.\nkendi 'a water-kettle'\u2014Malayalim kindi, Telugu gindi, Tamil kinni. In Malabar, it is a 'vessel without a handle, used to drink from.'\n\nmisru 'shot with gold, of cloth'\u2014Wilkinson. \"Mushrues\" are an old trade fabric. Hobson-Jobson explains\u2014\"Pers. mashr\u016b 'lawful': it is usually applied to a kind of silk or satin with a cotton back. 'Pure silk is not allowed to men' (Yusof Ali, A Monograph on Silk Fabrics produced in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, 1900). 'All Mushroos wash well, especially the finer kinds, used for bodices, petticoats and trousers of both sexes' (Forbes Watson, The Textile Manufactures and the Costumes of the People of India, London, 1866).\"\n\nkasi 'to give.' This word does not occur in Malay literature and has found its way into colloquial Malay apparently from Singapore. It has never, so far as I am aware, been explained. With diffidence, I venture to suggest it may be derived from one of the forms of 'cash' (Skt. karsha, Tam. kasu, Singalese kasi, Portuguese caixa)\u2014\"a name applied to sundry coins of low value in several parts of India.\" In 1598 Linschoten found copper caixa current in Sunda; and in 1727 Hamilton found leaden money called Cash current at Acheen. But the use of the word kasi 'to give' would seem to be of much later date, or probably it would have been accepted in literature.\nThe Fern-Allies and Characeae of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley, C.M.G., F.R.S.\n\nThe Fern-allies are taken to mean all the vascular Cryptogams exclusive of the true ferns and thus include the Lycopodiaceae, Selaginellaceae and Rhizocarpeae.\n\nThe only other group of existing Fern-allies, Equisetaceae, is not represented in the Malay Peninsula, though the common tropical Asiatic species, *Equisetum debile*, Roxb., may be expected to turn up in the mountains as it occurs in all the countries surrounding our area.\n\nThe most important works consulted for this paper are Spring\u2019s Monographe de la famille des Lycopodiac\u00e9es 1842-1849, Baker\u2019s Fern-allies, published in 1887, and Van Rosenburgh\u2019s Malayan Fern-Allies dated 1915. In the Kew Herbarium, British Museum and Linnean Society\u2019s collections, I have seen all the types of Linnaeus, Spring, Baker, Hooker and Hieronymus which relate to our country, the only exceptions being one or two types of Spring\u2019s collected in Penang by Gaudichaud. Col. Beddome was identifying my specimens at Kew at the time of his death, and had nearly finished them.\n\nDistribution. As all these plants except the Rhizocarpeae possess dust-like spores like the Ferns, it would appear at first probable that most species would have a world-wide distribution or at least there would be a very limited number of endemic species, owing to the long distances to which such spores can be borne on the wind, as also to the great antiquity of the group. In the Lycopodiaceae we have two species of *Psilotum* and one *Lycopodium* of very extended range. The two *Psilotums* range over all tropical countries and as far as Florida and New Zealand. *P. triquetrum* being the commonest. It grows on trees, especially Mangroves, rocks, walls, etc., very readily establishing itself. Though at least ten species have been made out of it, it really varies very little, the forms made into species by Karl Muller being merely states due to its habitat. *P. complanatum* seems more of an island plant and to be absent from the Peninsula of India and from Africa. It is generally to be found on Mangrove trees.\n\n*Lycopodium cernuum* extends all over the tropical regions and into Japan, the Azores, New Zealand and St. Paul\u2019s island. It frequents rather dry spots on the edges of woods and in open country, and especially poor soil. It used to come up persistently in some of the grass plots in the Singapore Botanic Gardens where the soil was exceptionally poor. It frequented indeed much the same kind of country as does the bracken (*Pteris aquilina*) though its distribution is not so wide. It is quite absent from our dense wet forests and from very wet ground, but it is often to be found\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 80, 1919.\non banks of roads through the forests up to 2,000 or more feet altitude. Here it becomes a slender, weak plant with fine leaves. Like the widely dispersed bracken it varies really very little except where local circumstances are abnormal to it. In dry xerophytic spots it becomes more stout with stiff incurved leaves, var. curvalum and on wet mountains long and slender with fine spreading leaves, var. salakense. Karl Muller has however, made some species out of these habitat forms.\n\nOf the other species of *Lycopodium* we have one which may be called Palaeartic viz., *L. complanatum*, our form however is very different in habits from the Arctic type.\n\nThe rest run thus:\u2014\n\n| Tropical Asia and Polynesia to America | 2 |\n| India to Polynesia | 1 |\n| Africa to Polynesia | 3 |\n| Malay isles only | 3 |\n\nNo species, is endemic. The terrestrial species are more widely distributed than the epiphytic ones as the area where epiphytic plants can grow is less extensive than the non-epiphytic area.\n\nThe *Selaginellas* are none of them epiphytic; they inhabit shady, wet forest. Outside our area there are a certain number which are adapted for existence in dry, open regions, but most of ours are to be found in the forests on the ground or on rocks; one species *S. Ridleyi* grows on rocks in streams under water or at least is usually covered by water. Thirty-two species occur, of these we have:\n\nEndemic, 21 species, India only, 3, Indo-Malaya, 4,\nMalay isles only, 2, All tropics except Africa, 1.\n\nIt is quite possible that further collecting may show that some of the endemics occur also in Borneo and Sumatra, but I cannot find specimens or reliable records of any of those classed as endemics here in the Kew or British Museum herbaria. The most widely distributed species is *S. flabellata*, originally described from South America. The Asiatic form hardly differs from that of *S. America*. The little *S. Belangeri* appear generally to grow in rather dry, open spots, and is possibly an introduction from India, where it appears to be common.\n\nThe *Rhizocarpea* call for few remarks, being aquatics, there are few suitable localities for these in the Malay Peninsula. The remarkable *Salvinia cucullata*, abundant in the ponds in India and in West Australia has recently been met with in Setul. *Marsilea erosa*, an Indo-Malayan species, occurs in rice-fields in the plain country, and *Azolla pinnata* is an introduction which rapidly spreads wherever it can. It was perhaps introduced by natives from Java. The Chinese constantly cultivate *Pistia stratiotes* for pig food, and carry it about as they shift their quarters. *Azolla* a duckweed-like plant is easily carried about with it and grows covering their pig-food ponds with great rapidity. It may also be dispersed by water fowl, adhering to their feathers.\nI. LYCOPODIACEAE.\n\nEpiphytic or terrestrial plants. Rhizome when present creeping.

It then produces towards the ends of this stem one or more tufts of stems which take root. The under side of the leaves on the branches becomes reddish-silvery and they are very stiff and dry.\n\nII.

The base of the stem is creeping for about 6 inches and though often fruiting from short branches, at times sends up an erect often bushy stem with much longer spikes which is usually yellow-brownish. The leaves of the lower plane are usually glabrous, but in some specimens strongly ciliate. The bracts are nearly always distinctly minutely denticulate, often ciliate. Baker\u2019s variety *sphaerophylla* has little ovate round leaves, rather close set on the stem, but it is easy to find every grade from the larger almost triangular, oblong leaves to these little round ones in the same locality. Specimens occur too, in which the bracts\nare shorter than usual, perhaps not fully developed. Baker's S. Tansleyi is one of those. The type of this species is preserved in Herb. Kew, but the description of the specimen hardly accords with it.\n\n31. **S. Morgani**, Zeiller, Bull. Bot. Soc.

The branchlets are simple or one or more times forked into rays with partial or complete whorls of secondary branchlets (bracts). The male and female organs are developed at the extremities of the branchlets or at their nodes in the axils of the bracts. The male organs (globules) are spherical at first, green, later red or yellowish. The female (nucules) sub-globular, ovoid or fusiform, reddish yellow or olive, consisting of a nucleus with 5 cells coiled spirally round it and terminated by a corona of 5 cells in 1 row or 10 less prominent in 2 rows.\n\nThese plants have not been carefully collected in the Malay Peninsula, but I have preserved some specimens which Mr. J.

The collection showed marked affinities to Australian forms; novel genera were rare. My facilities would not allow me to study the others, regrettable because I could have made a comparative study, and collections of these very numerous insects are not common nor their study at all well-advanced. Remarkable and attractive as they are, they seem to escape ordinary observation while even the trained entomologist sees only the larger kinds. The myriads of minute kinds form a wonderland whose marvels are known to the very few only and these fortunates are charmed amongst what seems to be a never-ending scene of glory and magnificence.\n\nI feel indebted to Mr. Baker for allowing me to see his collection and to your Society for publishing this scanty return.
