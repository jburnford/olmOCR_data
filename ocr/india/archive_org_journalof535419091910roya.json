Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nThis account of some of the animals of the Peninsular Region* will probably be of little service to the Zoologist and is not intended for him. But the Straits Asiatic Society has recently agreed to aid a survey of the mammalian fauna of the Malay Peninsula and its lay-members and other local residents who take an interest in such matters should be able with the aid of the keys\u2014which apply only to Peninsular species inter se\u2014together with the descriptions\u2014which I have endeavoured to keep free from technicalities\u2014to identify such animals of the three orders now dealt with as may come within the range of their experiences.\n\nThe first order contains the monkeys, which, owing to their similarity and near relationship to ourselves, are interesting to all; the other two include those more important and conspicuous mammals that, as big and small game, claim the attention of the shikari.\n\nOf species marked with an asterisk our knowledge is still incomplete, and further information, particularly of their exact distribution beyond that given, is required; to ask for more assistance would probably be useless; nevertheless skins, however roughly made, if accompanied by skulls would be greatly valued.\n\nThe reference given as \"Blanford\" is to the volume entitled \"Mammalia\" by W.

A naked gular pouch beneath the chin SYMPHALANGUS.\nB. No naked gular pouch beneath the chin HYLOBATES.\n\nGenus SYMPHALANGUS.\n\nThis genus contains the \"Siamang,\" the largest ape inhabiting the Malay Peninsula. The arms are so long that the knuckles of the hand touch the ground when the animal is standing erect. Small naked callosities are present on the buttocks and a pronounced web connects the toes of the feet. The hair of the forearm is directed upwards towards the elbow and the species has a more developed chin than any other ape. The voice is very powerful.\n\n1.* SYMPHALANGUS CONTINENTIS, Thomas.

S., especially in hilly country, from Upper Perak to Negri Sembilan and eastward to Gunong Tahan: not known in Johore.\n\nGenus HYLOBATES.\n\nThe Gibbons are, with the exception of one species of Symphalangus, the smallest of the anthropoids. They have no naked gular sac, the membrane between the toes, though occasionally present, occurs only in a very modified form, the hair of the forearm grows towards the wrist and the mandible is relatively the lightest and most fragile of all the Simiidae; otherwise their general resemblance to the Siamang is very close. Their cry is a series of loud ringing calls uttered most frequently in the early morning.\n\nKey to the Species.\n\nA. Hands and feet distinctly whitish ... H. LAR.\nB. Hands and feet of the same colour as body ... H. AGILIS.\n\n2. HYLOBATES LAR, (Linn.) The White-handed Gibbon. Blanford, p. 7.\n\nColour of fur varies from pale brownish buff (biscuit-colour) to sooty brown, and is sometimes piebald. The dark form is most numerous but individuals of every tint mate together and parents of one colour often have infants of the other. Hands feet and a ring of hair round the face whitish, always to be distinguished even in the palest individuals. Length of head and body about 18 inches.\n\nThroughout the Peninsula but not in the adjacent islands.\n\n3.* HYLOBATES AGILIS, F. Cuvier. The Agile Gibbon. Cantor Jour. As. Soc. Bengal, 1846.\n\nResembles Hylobates lar in colour and in variability but hands and feet are always concolorous with the limbs and body.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIn examples from the Larut Hills, Perak, some individuals show a narrow whitish brow-band broadening on the cheeks into bush-like whiskers (which sometimes include the ears and extend beyond them below) and then narrowing again on the throat leaving, in dark specimens, the chin and sides of throat dark. Others have only a brow-band white. Length of head and body about 18 inches.\n\nOne young specimen is brownish to ochraceous-buff with the entire head pale buff in strong contrast with the body.\n\nA very large female from the same locality with a narrow brow-band has the same pale extent only indicated in her infant.\n\nLimits of range in the Peninsula unknown but recorded from the Larut Hills, Perak, and from Temerloh, Pahang.\n\nFamily CERCOPITHECIDAE.\n\n(Monkeys).\n\nKey to the Subfamilies.\n\nA.

Cheek pouches present; muzzle elongated; tail variable, often shorter than head and body\n\nCERCOPITHECIN\u00c6.\n\nSubfamily SEMNOPITHECIN\u00c6.\n\nGenus PRESBYTES.\n\nThis genus contains a number of slender-limbed, crested monkeys of active habits and purely herbivorous diet. The stomach is divided into a number of pouches and from their habit of feeding mainly on leaves and young shorts the animals have been given the name of \"leaf-monkeys:\" they rarely\nsupport confinement for any length of time. In the skull the nasal aperture extends considerably above the lower level of the orbits. The thumb is well developed and a row of stiff black hairs projects above the eyes. The young differ in colour from the adults. Malay name \"Lotong.\"\n\nKey to the Species.\n\nA. Last lower molar with five well-developed cusps; inner side of thigh not lighter than outer side.\n\na.

Penang and Langkawi Islands.\n\n6. **Presbytes femoralis** (Horsf). The Banded Leaf-Monkey. *Semnopithecus femoralis*, Blanford, p. 42.\n\nMalay name \"Kaka.\"\n\nGeneral colour sooty or brownish black; crest, nape and back paler; hands and feet, terminal half of tail, forehead and cheeks black. Inner sides of arms, lower abdomen, and entire inner side of thigh, extending thence narrowly to heels whitish: the latter areas sharply margined. Sometimes a whitish stripe down the centre of chest and on the under side of base of tail. Skin of eyelids and lips pale. Head and body about 21 inches tail 30 inches.\n\nYoung, white with crown and end of tail black.\n\nThroughout the Peninsula and Singapore Island.\n\nSchlegel (Mus. Pays-Bas, VII, p. 47) has separated the Singapore animal under the name of *Semnopithecus neglectus*. The characters of this are:\u2014black, slightly guzzled with whitish:\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nwith hands, feet and temples clear black and nuchal crest and back sooty; middle line of chest, abdomen and inner side of limbs white; tail uniformly black. Animals of this form however also occur in Johore where they completely intergrade with those having the appearance described above.\n\n7.* **Presbytes albocinereus** (Cantor).

Skin of eyelids and lips pale. Head and body about 21 inches, tail 30 inches.\n\nMany individuals have their colouration less clearly defined than as described above and very nearly approach in appearance the browner phases of *P. femoralis*. From the latter however they can always be distinguished by their paler under surface and by the white areas which are always present to some degree on the sides of neck and buttocks. The two species are very closely related.\n\nYoung, darker than adult above and white below, colours distinctly margined.\n\nRange not defined but recorded from Kelantan to Selangor in which latter locality it is very common.\n\n**Subfamily CERCOPITHECIN\u00c6.**\n\n**Genus Macaca.**\n\nThe Macaques are stout-limbed, crestless monkeys with pronounced muzzles and a less striking colouration than the lotongs. The species vary greatly in length of tail. In the skull the nasal aperture is placed between the lower edge of the orbits and the extremity of the muzzle. In habit they\nare semi-arboreal and their diet is both animal and vegetable: they thrive well in confinement.\n\n**Key to the Species.**\n\nA.

The Crab-eating Macaque. *Macacus cynomolgus*, (Linn); Blanford p. 21.\n\nMalay name \"Krah.\"\n\nCrown of head, neck and back a speckle of black and ochraceous giving a general golden-brown or rufous effect but becoming gradually greyish on the limbs, sides of neck, tail and under parts. Eyebrows black. Head and body about 20 inches; females smaller. In immature animals the tail is longer than the head and body, in adults it is often a little shorter.\n\nThroughout the Peninsula and adjacent Islands.\n\n9.* **MACACA NEMESTRINA** (Linn). The Pig-tailed Macaque. Blanford, p. 20.\n\nMalay name \"B'roh.\"\n\nMales:\u2014Eyebrows, centre of forehead, crown, upper nape, lumbar region, rump and upper side of tail sooty black, everywhere distinctly margined except on neck and back. Behind and above ears, the eyes, sides of forehead, cheeks, throat and chest and a small area surrounding the callosities greyish white; muzzle and abdomen yellower. A line from crown running round the front of ears mingled ochraceous and sooty. Under side of tail greyish-buff, tipped ochraceous. Remainder of pelage, including the back across shoulders, strongly annulated ochraceous-buff and sooty, producing a speckled russet effect darkest on sides and hind limbs which\nare concolorous, the fore limbs being paler on the inner sides. Base of fur greyish white throughout except on crown and back. Only the pale grey and sooty areas are unspeckled, the grizzling being very marked across the shoulders. Head and body about 21 inches, tail 8 inches.\n\nFemales generally resemble the males but are much smaller, the dark areas are less intense and sharply margined, the annulations, except across the shoulders and on the sides, are very indistinct and there is no pale border to the callosities.\n\nMr. G. S. Miller in his paper on \"The Monkeys of the Macaca nemestrina group,\" (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., Vol. XXIX, p. 555-563) has separated Tenasserim animals from the typical Sumatran form under the name of Macaca adusta.\n\nHis characters for the latter are:\u2014fur distinctly annulated back so little darkened that the blackish tail forms a conspicuous contrast, noticeably paler than sides and thighs, canines not excessively heavy, skull broad.\n\nIn Macaca nemestrina typica the fur is either not annulated or indistinctly so, the back so dark that the blackish tail forms no noticeable contrast with it, buttocks not noticeably paler than sides of thigh, canines excessively heavy and skull elongate.\n\nThe Peninsular animal as represented in specimens from the F.M.S. agrees with neither of these. In the concolorous back and tail it approaches M. nemestrina while in the strongly annulated fur and pale buttocks it agrees with M. adusta.\n\nSkull and teeth however exactly resemble those of M. nemestrina from Sumatra as figured and cited by M. Miller except that the condylo-basilar, basilar and palatilar lengths are a little greater. Because of this and because I don't wish to make another geographical race out of the local representative of a group in which I think there is much individual variation, I have kept the older name for the Peninsular animal. It is possible however that the other form will also be found to occur in the northern districts of our area.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n10. **Macacas rufescens**, Anderson. The Ruddy Macaque. Anderson, Zoological Researches, 1879, p. 79. Bonhote, P.Z.S. 1900, p. 871.\n\nFace red, most brilliant round the eyes. General colour of pelage a warm reddish brown, darker on the back. Crown light in colour, hair short and radiating from a central point. Tail about an inch long and covered with hair.\n\nOnly one authentic specimen is known from the Peninsula; a female collected at Patalung, 7th April, 1899, by Messrs. Evans and Laidlaw. The two previously collected examples in existence were purchased at Singapore and Calcutta. None of them are fully adult and further material is required before the standing of the species can be properly determined. (An adult female was obtained a few years ago by Dr. W. L. Abbott at Victoria Point, the southern extremity of Tenasserim, but it has not yet been reported upon).\n\n**Suborder Lemuroidea.**\n\n(Lemurs).\n\nOnly one genus, *Nycticebus*, of this suborder occurs in the Peninsular area. Young Malayan animals always have four upper incisors, though sometimes one or two are missing in adult individuals; the lower canines only differ from the incisors in their greater depth and the first premolar is so large as to be mistaken for a canine. The tail is very short as is the second digit of both hand and foot while the first of each is long, opposable and widely divergent. The fur is exceedingly dense and woolly and covers the face with the exception of the muzzle.\n\n**Genus Nycticebus.**\n\n11. **Nycticebus malayanus** (Anderson). The Peninsular Slow Lemur.

Tail less than half the length of head and body, terminal portion entirely blackish, basal portion like body, with three or four dark semi-rings.\nBlanford gives 37 inches for the length of head and body, but all Peninsular examples I have seen are considerably smaller than the last species.\n\nThe Peninsula.\n\n21.* VIVERRA TANGALUNGA, Grey. The Malayan Civet.\n\nMalay name \"Tangelunga.\"\n\nGeneral ground colour pale buffy-grey; a black median line along the back and tail; sides covered with rows of small blackish spots which sometimes tend to form stripes; under surface much paler and scarcely spotted. Head buffy grey, sides of muzzle white, a whitish patch below the eyes; back of ears with black bases and whitish tips; chin dark ashy grey; feet and lower portion of limbs blackish ashy.\n\nTail ringed black and buffy, there being about fifteen broken or indistinct pale bars which almost disappear on the terminal portion. Upper side of tail almost unbroken black, lower buffy. Head and body about 25 inches, tail 15 inches.\n\nThe Peninsula. The above description is taken from Perak specimens but the range is unknown.\n\n(Bornean animals, which I have compared with local individuals, appear to differ slightly in having the pale tail bars broader and more distinct but rather fewer).\n\nGenus VIVERRICULA.\n\nContains animals smaller than those of the preceding genus and more arboreal in habits. Nails more curved and the front toes smaller. Tail ringed but no stiff crest along the back. Only one species occurs here.\n\n22.* VIVERRICULA MALACCENSIS, Gmel. The Smaller Civet.\n\nBlanford, p. 100. Bonhote, A. M. N. H., 7, I, p. 119.\n\nMalay name \"Musang bulan.\"\n\nGeneral colour brownish grey to brownish yellow. Dark stripes on the back and rows of dark spots along the sides\nsometimes indistinct: the stripes occasionally entirely absent. Neck with dark stripes and bars. Feet dark. Tail, more than two-thirds the length of head and body, with a light tip and seven light bands. Head and body about 25 inches.\n\nSpecimens of this animal seem to have been frequently sent home from the Peninsula during the first half of the last century but it is now decidedly rare. The suggestion has been made to me that it never was native but only an introduced cage animal that has not succeeded in establishing itself: as it is now found in such remote and unusual spots as the Comoro Islands and Socotra, I think this theory very reasonable.\n\nGenus Hemigale.\n\nThe tree-civets of this genus are peculiar in being banded instead of striped and in having the hair on the back of the neck growing upwards. The soles of the feet are naked only to a small extent, the body and neck are elongated and slender and the muzzle is very pointed. One local species only.\n\n23.* Hemigale hardwickei (Gray). The Slender Banded Civet. Blanford, p. 117.\n\nMalay name \"Musang blang\" or \"Musang batu.\"\n\nGround colour pale brownish. Two dark brown stripes on the nape broadening on the shoulders, five or six broad bands across the back and others on the basal portion of the tail, the terminal half of which is dark brown. Face striped with dark brown. Head and body about 21 inches.\n\nThe Peninsula: recorded from Trang but not reaching Tenasserim.\n\nGenus Prionodon.\n\nThe Weasel-civets are of an exceedingly slender form and are clad with velvet-like fur. The feet are covered with hair beneath and are armed with sharp retractile claws: the tail is very long and cylindrical. They are the smallest members of the family.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n24.* PRIONODON MACULOSUS, Blanford. The Malayan Weasel-Civet. Blanford, p. 104.\n\nMalay name \"Anga prau\" or \"Musang buah.\"\n\nGround colour pale whitish brown. Across the back six irregular dark brown patches bordered laterally by a broken longitudinal stripe and by a row of spots of dark brown. Two broad dark brown stripes on the nape, and a row of dark irregular spots on the sides of the neck. Outer sides of limbs spotted, inner sides and lower surface of body unmarked. Tail with seven dark brown rings and a pale tip. Length of head and body about 18 inches.\n\nThe Peninsula, known southward to Malacca.\n\n(P. gracilis, a smaller species of similar colouration, occurring in the Archipelago, has also been reported from the Peninsula by Cantor. Blanford thinks however, from the dimensions given, that his specimen was P. maculosus. Photographs taken by myself of Sumatran animals collected in Siak show a similar colour pattern to that of mounted specimens of P. maculosus in the Perak Museum).\n\nGenus PARADOXURUS.\n\nThe palm-civets are more numerous in the Peninsula than any other species of the related genera. They are of medium size and dull colouration; a large extent of the soles of the feet is naked and there is a naked patch on the lower abdomen: the claws are completely retractile. They are arboreal and nocturnal and subsist on a mixed diet. The Malay name for the genus is \"Musang.\"\n\nKey to the Species.\n\nA. Body spotted or striped.\n\na.

No white rump patch. Horns in cows extremely small.\n\nThe Peninsula.\n\nThe validity of this race or sub-species is at present extremely doubtful. The only actual material on which it is founded is a skull obtained by Captain J. C. Lamprey in Perak and imagined to be that of a cow. The horns are about 6 inches in length. The animal was only\ndiscovered after having been mauled by a tiger and was described as being entirely of a rich reddish chestnut colour with no white rump patch and with blackish stockings and muzzle.\n\nThe second record is an observation record of an old bull, 18 hands high (!), called by the Malays \"Sapio\" and described by the late Mr. W. Davison as being black; with belly, inner sides of legs, and stockings chestnut. Forehead rusty grey and inner side of ears strongly tinged with chestnut. (A young bull with this appearance was shot in Jelebu by Dr. E. A. Travers). Juveniles are said to be entirely chestnut and cows to have the chestnut areas darker and richer than bulls.\n\nFinally there is the description of a cow \"Sapi\" killed at Bukit Kepong on the Muar River in 1850 and described (Oxley, Jour. Ind. Arch. Vol. IV p. 354) as being much like the Bali Island race of *Bos sondaicus* but without the white patch on the buttocks; the horns small, curved inwards, white tipped with black; forehead flat with a tuft of long hair particularly in the bulls; the back curved, the highest point being at about the centre; total height 6 ft. 2 inches; the hair of a brown colour except on the feet which were dirty white; a mane about 2 inches long the whole length of the spine and no dewlap. Misled by the application of the name \"Sapi\" to it, this animal has hitherto been regarded as a specimen of the Banteng and so added to the uncertainty that already exists with regard to the appearance of the Peninsular form; it was however undoubtedly a Sladang. The absence of white on the rump; the parti-coloured horns, with pale bases and black inward-curving tips; the notable high withers and absence of dewlap are all differentiating features which are possessed by *Bos gaurus* but do not appear in the Banteng. The height given is doubtless a printer's error and should probably read 5 ft. 2 inches.\n\nWhile the above descriptions indicate the presence of some form of red-legged bovine in the Peninsula there is as yet no certain evidence that they apply to any form of *Bos sondaicus*.\nThe chief characters of the typical Banteng are (Blanford p. 489):\u2014General colour of old bulls blackish, of cows and young bulls bright reddish brown, approaching chestnut. Stockings below knees and hocks white. A white rump patch. Lips and inner sides of ears white. A pronounced dewlap.

He was born in 1755 and was trained for the medical profession. Being appointed doctor to an East Indiaman he started for the East but his ship met with an accident in the Syriam river in Pegu, being dismasted in rough weather. During the delay for repairs Hunter collected materials for his work, \"A concise account of the Kingdom of Pegu,\" which was published in 1785. He became assistant-surgeon to the East India Company in Bengal in 1783, and Surgeon in 1794. From 1798 to 1802, and again later he was Secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. After the capture of Java by the English in 1811 he was appointed Superintendent Surgeon there, and died at Batavia in 1812.\n\nHunter was a very versatile author, writing papers (chiefly published in the Asiatic researches) on a variety of subjects. Besides the account of Pegu, he published a number of papers on Botanical and Astronomical subjects, an essay on the diseases of Lascars on long voyages, and a Hindustani-English dictionary. He seems to have visited Penang in 1802 or early in 1803 when he wrote this manuscript which has not hitherto been published, and about the same time he must have written his account of Gambier cultivation, which was published in the Transactions of the Linnean Society IX p. 218 and read in England in 1807.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc. No. 53, 1909.\nIn this manuscript he gives first an account of Penang as it was at the time of his visit and an account of the plants he met with. This interesting as showing the early date of the introduction of many useful plants into Penang through the East Indian Company, who then possessed spice gardens, cultivated for the purpose of introducing spice plantations to the English colonies and to break down the monopoly of the Dutch. In this manuscript we have the records of the first fruiting of the nutmeg and mangosteen in Penang. An account of the cultivation of pepper was published by Hunter in the Asiatic Researches Vol. IX 1809 and is very much the same as what is written by him here, but as the original published paper is rare and difficult to procure now, it is well worth reprinting from his manuscript.\n\nI have identified most of the plants described by Hunter in this paper, but there are several I have been only able to guess at from description. He seems to have made a number of drawings of his plants to which there are references in the manuscript, but I do not know what has become of these drawings.\n\nReference is made in many parts of the manuscript to the spice gardens of the Honourable East India Company and the locality given for these the first Botanic Gardens in the Straits Settlements is recorded definitely for the first time viz. at Ayer Hitam. The stories of these gardens is this. On the settling of the island by Captain Light in 1786, there were practically no cultivated plants there except a few coconuts and fruit trees. The East India Company, anxious to break the Dutch monopoly of spices, appointed Christopher Smith their Botanist in 1794, and sent him in 1796 to the Moluccas to collect plants of spice trees. He sent from Amboyna 71,266 nutmegs and 55,264 clove-plants and quantities of canary nuts (Canarium commune), and the sugar palm, Arenga saccharifera. These were grown (except for a number sent to Kew, India and the Cape) in the spice-gardens at Penang. He probably sent also the other ornamental and useful plants mentioned as introduced from Amboina. After his return he was appointed in 1806 Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens and died about the same year.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe gardens founded for the Government in 1822, also at Ayer Hitam, were probably on the same spot, but to this we have no clue. A botanical School-master, George Porter had charge of them till 1834 when they were sold cheap by Governor Murchison, as his wife could not get enough potatoes and other vegetables from them for her table, it is said.\n\nNames of plants etc. within brackets (\u2014) are added by myself, otherwise the manuscript is not altered.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\nTo\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Most Noble\n\nMarquis Wellesley,\n\nGovernor General, &c., &c.\n\nThis Outline of a Flora of Prince of Wales Island,\n(Penang),\nis most respectfully presented,\n\nBy\n\nHis Lordship's\nMost obedient and very humble\nservant,\n\n(Signed) Wm. Hunter.\nPlants of Prince of Wales Island.\n\nPrince of Wales's Island is of a form nearly rectangular, its length from North to South being about eleven or twelve miles, and its breadth, from East to West about half that space. Its North-east point, on which stand George Town and Fort Cornwallis, is in Lat. 5\u00b025' N. and Long. 100\u00b018' east. It is divided into an easterly and westerly region, by a ridge of hills, extending through nearly its length. On the highest part of the ridge, is erected a flag-staff, for notifying, by signal, the appearance of ships at sea. The height of this peak, (if it may be called so as the table is about eighty yards in length) has been variously estimated; and all the conjectures I heard on the subject were beyond the truth. To ascertain it, I measured a base of 670 feet, on a plain, as near as could be obtained to the bottom of the hill, which gave the perpendicular height of the highest point 1192 feet. The length of the flag-staff on the hill is fifty feet. This, being viewed from a Bungalow in George Town, through a three foot reflecting telescope, and measured by an object glass micrometer attached to the telescope, was found to subtend an angle of 6' 54\", giving the distance, in a straight line, about $4\\frac{3}{8}$ miles.\n\nThe table land on the top of the hill runs from North to South. On the North extremity is the flag-staff, and on the South, a Bungalow, belonging to the Lieutenant Governor. There are two roads cut in the side of the mountain, for ascending to the summit, one from the South-ward, and another from the North-ward. The last of these was finished during my stay on the Island. It is something longer than the former, but of much easier ascent; and the bottom of this road being nearer to the town than the other, the whole journey, from town to the top of the hill, is considerably shortended by it. About half way up these two roads unite, so that the upper part is common to both.\n\nThe forest trees, by the road-side, have the lower part of their trunks, for above five or six feet above the ground, formed\ninto projecting and re-entering angles, so that a transverse section of one of them would resemble a star. Thence it ascends, round and perfectly straight, without branches, to a great height, perhaps above one hundred feet. The branches at top are pretty much crowded, but that top is small, in proportion to the size of the tree. This form seems to be occasioned by the trees growing so close together that there is not room for the branches to spread wide.\n\nThe lofty forest overhead, forming an impenetrable shade, the mountain on one hand, and a rugged precipice on the other, the murmuring of a stream in the valley below, with the song of a few birds, and the perpetual shrill hum of numerous beetles, have a striking effect.\n\nThe view from the hill, to the North and South is very extensive over the sea. To the East, it is bounded by a very lofty ridge of mountains on the Malay continent. This ridge is not seen from the plain; being concealed behind a nearer chain, of much less elevation. To the West-ward is a hill, somewhat higher than that whereon the Bungalow and Flag-staff are erected. This intercepts the view of nearly one fourth part of the horizon, that is from N. 65 W. to S. 32 W. So that, if it should be requisite to notify at Fort Cornwallis, the appearance of ships between these points, it must be done by erecting a second flag-staff on the Western hill, the signals on which should be repeated from that to the east-ward.\n\nImmediately to the West-ward of the ridge which joins the Bungalow and flag-staff, is a deep valley to which a kind of road has been formed by cutting the sides of the hill into steps and supporting them with sticks laid across. This valley enjoys a perpetual shade; and at the bottom is a slender stream of very clear and cool water, which running under large masses of rock, is collected in a little basin. The water is hard, from some saline, or mineral impregnation, which I had not the means of examining.\n\nAbout half a mile farther on, in the valley which contains the beginning of the new road up the hill, is a cascade, formed by a small river, precipitating itself from the mountain. This river winds through the valley, and the road crosses it five\ntimes, by means of wooden bridges. The lowest fall is not above twenty feet in height the water limpid as crystal, and always cool. Thence, by a steep and winding ascent, amid thick forest, you come to the foot of the great fall, the height of which has been reckoned two hundred feet, though I suspect this estimate of exaggeration. However, the fall of no despicable stream, from such an elevation, skirted on both sides with most luxuriant foliage, forms an object at once pleasing and sublime. Although the air in the wood, when I first visited it, was exceedingly close; yet on approaching the bottom of the fall, I found it so cold, that I was glad to make a speedy retreat, being apprehensive of bad effects from such a sudden change of temperature when heated. The water is perfectly sweet and well tasted. This river, called the Waterfall river, after quitting the valley, takes its course to the South-ward, and joins its stream to another, the Ayer Hitam (or black water) which comes from the South-ward. The united trunk, called the Penang River, falls into the harbour about two miles to the South-ward of George Town; and from this place, ships are generally supplied with water. But, as far as their boats are able to navigate the river, its water is said to be slightly brackish; on which account, it has been proposed to conduct the purer stream of the Water-fall, by pipes, to George Town for the use of shipping as well as of the inhabitants.\n\nThe harbour is formed by the strait, intercepted between the Island and the Malay shore. For capacity and security from tempests, it is hardly inferior to any in the World. But its advantages have been so ably detailed by Sir Home Popham, that I cannot pretend to add anything to the information contained in his report. Whether it is capable of being fortified, so as to be tenable against the temporary superiority of an enemy at sea; and, if so, what are the best means of effecting that purpose, are questions that have undergone much discussion, and still remain unanswered.\n\nThe forests produce a great variety of timber for the construction of ships, as well as houses, and for household furniture. I have seen specimens of about thirty different kinds, but was able to ascertain the botanical characters of very few. From\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\ntheir great height, and the larger circumference of the trunk, it is very difficult to climb the large trees, so as to obtain the flowers. These can only be got, either by cutting down the trees, or by tying bamboos along their trunks, to climb upon. Colonel Kyd, in his reports, has given the names of some of the trees, and mentioned the properties of the timber which they yield. But the timber of those trees has yet been seen in most instances to disadvantage, as they have never been allowed time enough to be seasoned.\n\nOn the eastern side of the Island, or that part intercepted between the hills and the harbour, almost all the great timber has been cut down; but much ground still remains to be cleared of underwood and planted. The soil is various. In low valleys, nearly surrounded by hills, there is much vegetable mould; on higher spots and extensive plains, we find a stiff red clay, mixed with sand.\n\nThe chief article of cultivation is pepper. Large groves of Betel-nut and Cocoa-nut have also been planted, as these trees require but little labour. Almost the only grain raised on the Island, is rice, and that in very small quantity. The price of labour is here, as in all newly settled countries, excessively dear; and therefore crops of small value will not defray the expense of cultivation.\n\nThe eastern side of the Island is divided into districts, in the following order commencing from the north.\n\nPoolo-Tikoos; a narrow plain, rather elevated, and open to the sea.\n\nPoolo Penang; extensive plain, containing many plantations of pepper and betel-nut.\n\nAyer Hitam; a valley, inland, and surrounded on three sides, by hills. In this are situated the Honble. Company's spice plantations. In the parts of this valley which lie near the banks of the river, is some of the richest soil on the Island.\n\nBatoe Lanshun; receives its name from a hill, of no great elevation, close on the shore of the eastern straits; which commands a most interesting prospect of the town, the harbour, and almost the whole eastern plain.\n\nSoongey Groogur; a small district, of very uneven surface.\nSoongey Dooa; In this district, near the shore, is another beautiful hill, the sides of which swell very gently, and the summit has a view of the whole strait, as well as of the adjacent country.\n\nSoongey Neebong; so named from a kind of palm. The road through this district is difficult, consisting of steep ascents and descents, winding among the hills. In this district is a considerable plantation of Nutmeg and Clove trees, belonging to the estate of the late Mr. Roebuck.\n\nSoongey Clooan; This district is the richest and most completely cultivated on the Island. It contains the oldest and best Pepper plantations. Here is a large plantation of betel-nut forming on account of the Honourable Company. Opposite to the north-west point of the Island is the small island Poolo Tikos (or Rat Island). It is rocky, almost bare of vegetation, but produces plenty of oysters.\n\nWithin the straits are the islands Poolo Juraja and Poolo Kra; and at the southern extremity lies Poolo-Remoo, or Tiger Island. All these are woody. On Poolo Juraja is found good lime-stone, and a reddish clay, which being mixed with sand, and spread on the roads, forms an excellent hard surface.\n\nThe climate, as might be expected so near the equator, admits of little variety of seasons, in respect to heat and cold. And these depend, not so much on the meridian zenith distance of the sun, as on the variety of dry or rainy weather. The following abstract of a register of the thermometer for ten months, will show the extent of its variations.\n\n|        | Morning | Noon | Evening |\n|--------|---------|------|---------|\n| April  | 80      | 84   | 80      |\n| May    | 79      | 83   | 80      |\n| June   | 80      | 83   | 80      |\n| July   | 79      | 83   | 81      |\n| August | 77      | 82   | 79      |\n| September | 78     | 82   | 78      |\n| October | 78      | 81   | 78      |\n| November | 76     | 80   | 78      |\n\nR. A Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nIn the months of September, October and November was much heavy rain. From the middle of December, to the beginning or middle of March, is the driest Season. The heat in the middle of the day then rises high, but the nights and mornings are cool. During the remaining six months, frequent showers fall, which cool the air, but there is no heavy or long continued rain. In clear weather, the morning from a little after sun-rise, till ten or eleven o'clock, is usually sultry; but about that time, the sea breeze sets in, to temperate the heat, and restore the elasticity of the atmosphere. And it is remarked that exposure to the sun after that hour, is less hurtful than before.\n\nThe temperature on the top of the hill is at all times about ten degrees lower than that on the plain. Hence, during the dry season, convalescents derive great benefit from a residence on the hill; the journey to which from the Town, may be performed in one hour and three quarters. But in rainy weather the hill is frequently enveloped in a thick fog, which is hurtful to invalids. A fog is hardly ever known to reach the point on which the Town is built.\n\nFor some years after his Island was ceded to the English Government, during the process of cutting down the woods and clearing the ground, the place was found to be unhealthy. Fever and dysentery, with obstructions of the liver and spleen were prevalent and often fatal. But at present, there is probably no Settlement in India where Europeans enjoy better health, or can endure with impunity more exposure to the vicissitudes of the weather.\n\nThe number of inhabitants may be safely estimated at 20,000. Of these at least one third are Chinese, who are divided into two classes. Those from the province of Canton are chiefly artificers, and the people from Chin-chew are employed in the cultivation of the ground. These two classes\ncannot understand each other's language and an antipathy prevails between them, as great as between the natives of two hostile kingdoms.\n\nThe Choolias, a race of musulmans from the Southern part of the Coromandel Coast (above Nagore especially) may be reckoned to form another third. Many of these are engaged in trade; the boatmen, fishermen, and coolies, who carry burdens are all of this class.\n\nThe remaining third is chiefly composed of Europeans, Armenians, Portuguese Malays and Burmas. The concourse of various nations is so great, that I have been assured that fourteen languages are in constant use in the Bazaar; English, Portuguese, Armenian, Chinese of Canton, Chinese of Chin-chew, Buzguese Malay, Siamese, Hindostanee, Bengalee, Tamil, Telinga, Arabic, Burma.\n\nThe vegetable productions which have fallen under my observation are as follows:\n\n**MONANDRIA\u2014MONOGYNYA.**\n\n*Canna Indica*-cultivated in gardens.\n\n1. *Amomum zingiber*, Ginger, Alia, Malay.\n   Cultivated, nearly sufficient for the use of the inhabitants.\n\n2. *Amomum globosum*?

But as it is the most important article of produce on Prince of Wales\u2019s Island, the manner of cultivation pursued there merits a particular detail.\n\nIt is propagated by cutting, or suckers. These are generally planted at a distance of about $7\\frac{1}{2}$ feet; that is 1,000 plants in an Oorlong, which is a measure of 80 yards square, nearly equal to $1\\frac{1}{3}$ acre. But some experienced cultivators think that the distance should be greater; perhaps nine feet; as the roots would be better nourished and the produce more abundant.\n\nWhen a plantation is to be commenced, the large timber is cut down by Malays, at the rate of five dollars per Oorlong. The remaining labour is performed by Chinese, who dig out the roots, burn them and the trunks, pulverise and level the\nsoil, plant the pepper vines and the trees which are to support them. It is usual to contract with them for making the plantation in this manner, and taking care of it for three years, at the end of which time it is in bearing at the rate of 225 dollars for 1,000 plants. The sum is liquidated by instalments, as the contract requires it, to pay his workmen. Something more than one third is paid in the first year, because the labour is then greatest; but about one fourth of the whole is generally reserved, till the contract is completed, and the plantation delivered over. This does not include the price of the plants, or cuttings, which are found by the proprietor of the plantation.\n\nThe vine is first made to climb on a pole. At the end of ten or twelve months, it is detached from the pole, to undergo the process called laying down. A circular hole, about eighteen inches in diameter, is dug at one side of the plant. At the bottom of this the plant is carried round in a circle, and the end of it is brought to the tree which is in future to form its support. The depth of the hole, in which the vines are laid down, varies, according to the situation and nature of the soil; and much judgment, to be acquired by practice, is requisite, to adapt it to these circumstances. In high and dry situations, the depth must be considerably greater than in those which are low and moist. Too little depth in the former would expose the roots to be parched in dry seasons; and too much in the latter would occasion them to rot, from excess of moisture.\n\nThe trees used for supporting the pepper vines on Prince of Wales's Island are the *Morinda citrifolia* (Munkoodu) and the *Erythrina coralloidendron* (Dudup). The Chinese planters alledge that the pepper supported by the Erythrina thrives better, and lasts longer than that supported by the Morinda. One instance I heard quoted in proof of this assertion, was a plantation which had long been neglected, and overgrown with weeds. When it came to be examined the vines which had grown on the Morinda were all dead; while those on the Erythrina were still strong and productive. The reason assigned by the planters, for the difference is, that the roots of the Erythrina do not spread so much, or penetrate so deep as\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nthose of the Morinda; whence they interfere less with the pepper, and do not draw so much nourishment from the earth.\n\nThe Morinda was formerly made to grow with one stem, but this was not found to afford sufficient spread for the vines. Therefore when that tree is used, the practice now is to break off the principal stem, at a height of about two feet from the ground. This obliges the trees to put out lateral branches at that height. When these have attained a length of about a foot or fifteen inches, they are cut off. From their end arise erect shoots each of which forms a stem, so that the vine has four or five stems to climb on, instead of one.\n\nThe vines, at three years of age, begin to produce, and they are reckoned to be in full bearing at five or six. They continue nearly in the same state for eight years more, or till they are fourteen years old. From that period they are reckoned on the decline; but the planters on Prince of Wales's Island cannot yet judge from experience at what rate, or in how long a time they decay. Some Chinese, who have cultivated the plant, on the Malay coast, say the vines have not arrived at their point of greatest produce till they are fourteen years old; that from this gradually declining, they continue bearing till near thirty.\n\nThe first year of bearing, or at three years old, the vines do not yield more than half a catty each. But plants kept in good order, when in their prime, will produce three catties. A plantation of 3,000 vines at Soongey Clooan, now in its eleventh year, has been let for three years at seventy picols yearly, or at the rate of $2\\frac{1}{3}$ catties each plant. It must therefore produce as much more as will pay the tenant for his labour and risk. They are generally let for the first five years of bearing, or from three to eight years old, at 160 picol per Lukcha (10,000) or at 160 catties for 100 vines.\n\nThe vines yield two crops yearly. The first gathering commences in December, after the heavy rains are over; and at the same time, the vines have put out new flowers. This first collection may be finished in February. The flowers which spread in December have ripened their seeds in April or May. The second collection then begins, and ends in July.\nDuring this time blossoms have expanded, which are to furnish the crops of next December. But, with the most careful cultivators, who gather only the bunches which are fully ripe, these two harvests run so nearly into one another, that the collection is in a manner continued without interruption, from December till August; so that there is only an interval of four months in the year, which is the season of the heavy rains.\n\nThe bunches are plucked off entire, taking care to pull only those that are ripe. They are thrown into baskets, and allowed to remain for a day. Then they are spread on mats, and trodden with the feet, to separate the fruit from the stalk. The grain is then winnowed, to clear it from the stalks and the lighter grains; and then the good heavy grains are spread on mats, in the sun, to dry, for three days. It is calculated that one hundred catties of green pepper, with the stalks, yield thirty five catties of clean and dry pepper. The collection of one day from 46,000 plants of three years old, was 500 catties of green, or 175 of dry pepper.\n\nIt is usual, as was before noticed, when the plantation is delivered over to the proprietors at the end of three years, to let it to a Chinese farmer for five years more; as the proprietor is thereby less liable to imposition, the only precaution necessary being to see that the tenant is careful of the vines during the last year, and leaves them in good condition at the expiration of the lease. This is the only way in which an extensive plantation, or one whereon the proprietor cannot bestow his whole attention, can be managed to advantage. But, if the proprietor has time, and is careful and acute, he may render it something more productive, by keeping it in his own hands. The labour of cleaning the vines, throwing up earth about the roots, and collecting the produce of the plantation above mentioned, of 46,000 plants, was performed by sixteen Chinese workmen.\n\nIn an Appendix to a letter from the Superintendent of Prince of Wales\u2019s Island, dated 12th of November 1796, is an estimate, whereby it would appear that a plantation of 100,000 vines should yield, at the end of twelve years, a clear profit to the proprietor, of 153,000 Spanish dollars. But the value of\nthe pepper is stated too high at 14 dollars per picol; and the interest of money, on both sides of the account, is neglected. Yet if we value the pepper only at ten dollars for which it is presumed it may always be sold on the field, and compute the interest, the result will give an advantage, exceeding the Superintendent's calculation, by 31,000 dollars. See Appendix A.\n\nThe whole quantity of pepper produced last year on the Island, was estimated at something between sixteen and twenty thousand picols. Taking the medium quantity at 12 dollars, which was the selling price, this article must have amounted to 2,16,000 dollars. The pepper is more esteemed than that which comes from the Malay continent and Sumatra, and it sells for about one dollar more per picol. The difference is occasioned by the haste of the Malays to gather the fruit before it is sufficiently ripe.\n\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nEstimated expense and produce in 12 years, of 100 Oorlongs, planted with Pepper.\n\n| Dr. | Cr. | Ballance. |\n|-----|-----|-----------|\n| Sp.

The modes of preparation are two. The first is by boiling the leaves. See Marsden's Sumatra p. 243, where he quotes for a particular account of the manufacture, the second volume of the Transactions of the Batavian Society. This process was performed under my inspection by a Chinese of Prince of Wales's Island.\n\nSeven catties (or $9\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs.) of the leaves, plucked clean from the stalks, were boiled, in a large pot, for one hour and a half, adding more water, as the first wasted, till towards the end of the process, when it was inspissated to the consistence of a very thin sirup. When taken off the fire, and allowed to cool, it became solid. It was then cut into little squares, which were dried in the sun, turning them frequently. After one month, I weighed them, and found ten ounces and two drachms, troy weight.\n\nThe Gambeer prepared according to this process is of a brown colour, but from some parts of the Malay coast, and of Sumatra, it is brought in little round cakes, almost perfectly white. According to Dr. Campbell of Bencoolen, this is made by cutting small the leaves and young twigs, and infusing them in water for some hours; when a foecula is deposited, which is\ninspissated by the heat of the sun; and moulded into round cakes.\n\nThe Gambeer, when first tasted, impresses on the palate a strong sensation of bitter and astringency. But it afterwards leaves a sweetish taste, which remains a long time. From these sensible qualities, it may reasonably be expected to prove useful in medicine.\n\nA plantation of this shrub, and a manufacture for this drug, was set on foot, some years ago, by a Chinese near Batoo-Lanshun. But he found the same obstacle to this, that has proved fatal to most other manufactures hitherto attempted on the island. The pay of his workmen came so high, that the drug cost him more than the market price of that which is imported. He has therefore rooted out the plants, and put pepper vines in their place.\n\nFrom the sensible qualities of the Gambeer, it appears likely to yield a considerable quantity of tanning substance, which has lately been the subject of inquiry from the Honourable the Court of Directors, respecting the Kut, or Cutch. And, some rough trials which I have made on it, with animal gluten, compared with those of Dr. Roxburgh on Kut, evince it to be richer in that material than the Kut.\n\nNot having found the flowers expanded, I was unable to give that most essential part in my drawing; but the deficiency has been supplied by the favour of Dr. Roxburgh from a drawing transmitted to him by Dr. Berry of Madras.\n\n2. *Nauclea acida*, H.\n\nClimbing; branches four cornered, smooth; Leaves ovate, pointed, smooth; Stipules four, pointed; Peduncles axillary, solitary, simple, jointed, bracted, recurved after flowering, persistent.\n\nPerhaps *N. aculeata*, Willden 929. *Uncaria aculeata*.

The following are the chief particulars in which they differ.\n\n1. The trunk of the Culilaban is erect and straight, and the foliage rises in a conical form, terminating in a point. The trunk of the Cinnamon is crooked and its foliage spreads irregularly.\n\n2. The leaf of the Culilaban is three nerved, exactly like that of the Cinnamon; that is the nerves meet in the base, or as near it as those of the Cinnamon, and like it they vanish towards the point. But this leaf is more oblong and pointed that of the Cinnamon, so as to become lanceolate.\n\n3. Not having seen the tree in flower, I cannot say whether a mark of distinction can be taken from the situation and structure of the panicle; or from the parts of the flower. But if the fruit is truly represented by Rumphius it is very remarkable.\n\n4. The young leaves of the Cinnamon have a yellow colour richly streaked with red.

In the first of these situations, the trees are usually planted at the distance of four fathoms, or one hundred in an Oorlong; in the latter five fathoms, or sixty four. The price of planting by contract, which is the usual mode, is 350 dollars per thousand, for which they are to be taken care of for three years, or till the stems are, according to the Malay term, of the circumference of an elephant's head. The plants are furnished by the proprietor.\n\nThe trees are reckoned to produce 100 nuts each, and the net value of the crop, after deducting one third for charges of management &c., is estimated at one Spanish dollar each tree.\n\n**Areca**, Schreb. 1696.\n\n*Areca catechu*, Gmel. 2, 649.

Bishop, R.G.A.\n\nThis is a medium sized beetle a little less than half an inch in length and breadth, of orange colour marked with black spots.\n\nIn the classification of the Cambridge Natural History it belongs to:\u2014Order Coleoptera, Sub-Order Phytophaga, Family Chrysomelidae, Subfamily Cryptostomes, Group Cassidides.\n\nDescription.\n\nIts head and neck are protected by a chitinous shield, which encircles the neck, and beneath which the head can be entirely withdrawn. The thorax and abdomen are entirely covered by strong chitinous elytra, which fit closely along the margin of the head shield, and together with it form a more or less hemispherical covering.\n\nThe head shield is semi-transparent and has no black spots on it. The portions of the elytra that cover the thorax and abdomen are of a dull whitish colour which changes to a bright orange as the insect grows older, and these inner portions are each ornamented with, as a rule, eight small black spots, (Fig. 4), (some specimens have only six spots), while the outer rims of the elytra, which are semi-transparent, have each two somewhat larger black spots, and a thin edging of black. The male and female are almost indistinguishable having no difference in their markings, but the female is, as a rule, slightly larger than the male.\n\nThe largest specimen yet seen by the writer measured 12'5 mm. from front of head shield to the extremity of elytra, and 11'5 mm. across the widest portion of the elytra; the width of the abdomen being 6 mm. This was a female.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nThe smallest perfect specimen measured 9.5 mm. by 8.5 mm. breadth of abdomen being 4 mm. This was a male.\n\nThe largest males are however larger than the smallest females.\n\nThe antennae, length from 3 to 3.5 mm. consist of eleven segments. The first segment, fitting into the head between the eyes with a ball and socket joint, is a long and thick one, the second small, almost spherical; the next four are short and thick, the remaining five rather thicker and covered with fine hairs, the last being long and pointed.\n\nThe last four segments of the flagellum are coloured black, all the other segments being transparent.\n\nThe wings of the insect have two main folds when lying shut against the slightly convex dorsal surface of the abdomen, one fold running from the apex to nearly the centre of the posterior margin, the other fold across from about a third of the anterior margin from the apex almost parallel to the posterior fold. Each main fold has a fan-like fold in it, before turning under the other portion of the wing.\n\nThe veins of the wing are strongly marked, all lying within that portion of the wing which lies flat on the abdomen.\n\nThe diagrams above (not to scale) show (a) the positions of the wings lying flat on the abdomen, and (b) one wing extended, with its venation.\n\nLarva.\n\nThe eggs from which the larvae hatch out, are laid in bunches. The size of each egg is about 2 mm. long, and 6 mm. in greatest diameter.\nThe larvae are, at first, of a uniform light greenish yellow colour, semi-transparent so that when seen under the microscope by transmitted light, their internal organs appear as dark patches of varying size and shape. (Fig. 1).\n\nThey are very active, but if the proper food be near, they as a rule settle down in a flock together, and only move on as the surface of the leaf is eaten.\n\nFor the first few days of life they only eat half through the leaf, but as they grow larger they eat all but the largest veins.\n\nThe only food as yet found acceptable to them, though several have been tried, is the leaves of the *Ipomea carnea* (Woodrow), *I. superbiens* (Ferminger).\n\nThe larva, (Figs. 1 & 2) is oval in shape, with six legs, and has 32 processes projecting in all directions from the circumference of its body. These processes are furnished with spines, and vary slightly on each successive larval skin. In the youngest forms they are of unequal lengths, and longer in proportion to the size of the body, while in the later forms, they become more regular in size and shorter in proportion.\n\nIn addition to these the larva has a forked process projecting from the dorsal surface of the abdomen, which in the young forms is very long and slender, and in all forms slightly longer than the lateral processes.\n\nThis forked process by means of which the Cassidides are commonly said to cover themselves with a shelter or sunshade of excrement, is not much used in that manner by this species. The process is used in throwing off each old larval skin, during which proceeding the skin is often retained on the process for a considerable time, but the larvae almost invariably obtain shelter from the sun and rain by remaining on the under surface of the leaf they are living on, and the forked process is, as often as not, quite clean.\n\nLarvae take from 18 to 21 days to arrive at maturity and stop feeding, during which time they shed their skins some 5 or 6 times, increasing in size and developing black marks on the dorsal surface of the abdomen. They then attach themselves to a leaf by a false foot dropped from the abdomen.\nbehind the legs, and this state lasts approximately 48 hours, after which the pupa emerges from the last larval skin but does not separate from it, the skin being retained at the extremity of the abdomen, as the connection between the pupa and the leaf, on which it remains stationary.\n\nPupa.\n\nThe pupa stage (Fig. 3) lasts from 4 to 5 days, as a rule, though some few exceptions remain as long as 7 days and yet eventually turn into the fully developed imago.\n\nDuring the pupa stage no external changes take place, except that on the ventral surface the limbs of the insect may be observed developing.\n\nImago.\n\nThe imago when it is ready to burst forth from the pupa, begins to stretch and strain until it breaks the pupa skin near its head. It then pushes out its head and chitinous head shield until it can release its antennae and front pair of legs.\n\nThe elytra may then be observed to be quite soft, folded closely around the thorax and abdomen, and as it emerges from the pupa skin the elytra gradually spread out, while at the same time the insect pulls out its second and third pairs of legs.\n\nUntil the actual process of emergence has been closely watched, it is hard to realize how so large an insect can have come out of so small a pupa case.\n\nThe imago is at first of a clear yellow colour without a spot visible on it. The black spots appear in about an hour, but if the insect be observed under a microscope the positions of the spots which are to come are found to be marked by pores in the elytra which have a speck of black pigment visible. There are some 15 or 16 of these pores to each black spot.\n\nAbout half an hour after emerging from the pupa the insect unfolds its wings so that the ends emerge beyond the elytra, but it does not, at this stage, attempt to fly, or even to\nopen its elytra which are still quite soft and liable to be creased and deformed.\n\nAt this stage also, if laid on its back, the insect is incapable of turning over, unless it can reach something to hold on to with its feet, the elytra not being strong enough to aid it in turning over. The elytra harden in about a week or ten days, but the insect takes considerably longer to reach maturity.\n\n**Habits.**\n\nFemales about the end of their fourth week of life, begin to lay egg bunches, even though they have been kept quite separate from the male. These eggs are unfertile.\n\nAbout the same time, or perhaps a little sooner, the males begin to try to copulate.\n\nWhen both male and female have fully reached maturity they breed fairly rapidly.\n\nThey appear, as a rule, to copulate in the heat of the day, never being observed *in coitu* before 9:30 or 10:0 a.m., and seldom before noon.\n\nThey remain *in coitu* for several hours, almost invariably till after 10:0 p.m.; the longest time observed being from 10:30 a.m., till 10:30 p.m., but the time of separation was not then observed.\n\nThis occurs perhaps for several successive days, then, as a rule, no copulation takes place for some 24 hours, after which the female lays an egg bunch.\n\nCopulation again begins within 5 or 6 hours of the egg bunch being completed.\n\nThis excessive copulation observed to be the rule with almost all pairs kept in captivity by themselves, may not be so prevalent in a state of freedom if the females are more numerous than the males, especially as it appears to be quite unnecessary.\n\nThe female is provided with a spermatheca which is fertilized by the male, so enabling her to lay several fertile egg bunches after complete separation from the male.\n\nA female isolated on the 2nd June laid egg bunches on 6th, 9th, 13th, and 15th June, all of which contained fertile eggs which hatched out in due course.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nA female isolated on 23rd May, laid egg bunches on 26th and 30th May, 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 11th June, all of which hatched out.\n\n**Egg Laying.**\n\nThe eggs are laid in bunches of variable sizes, usually containing from 30 to 50 eggs, but as the female grows old the bunches often decrease in size, some only containing about 10 eggs.\n\nThe method of procedure is as follows:\u2014Starting with her abdomen depressed on to the surface on which she is standing, the insect raises a concave vertical shield of chitin exuding it from her cloaca as she raises her abdomen. This is repeated 3 or 4 times, each shield adhering to the last and overlapping it slightly to one side or the other. The abdomen is then raised and an egg exuded from the ovipositor which directs the egg into its proper vertical position as the abdomen is again lowered.\n\nAfter each egg is laid another sheet of chitin is erected as a covering.\n\nThe eggs are laid in four rows, not in succession from one side to the other, but always in the same order throughout the laying.\n\nThe rate of laying is from 1 to 2 minutes for each egg, made up as follows:\u2014\n\n| Activity                  | Time       |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| Depositing egg            | 10 to 20 seconds |\n| Covering with chitin      | 40 to 80 seconds |\n| Interval before next egg  | 10 to 20 seconds |\n\nHaving deposited the last egg, two or three layers of chitin complete the egg bunch, which is normally a compact mass measuring about 5 mm. by 4 mm. in transverse section, and from 4 to 7 mm. long.\n\nThe time occupied in laying a normal egg bunch varies from 40 minutes to 1\u00bd hours.\n\nEgg bunches take from 10 to 13 days to hatch out.\n\nThe number of egg bunches laid by one female varies considerably. Many of the pairs of insects kept, during captiv-\nity, in Petri capsules either died after a few days, escaped when their food was being changed, or were killed for dissection and study of their anatomy. The following are a few examples of the number of egg bunches laid by females which lived for two or three weeks:\n\nA female kept for 39 days, laid 13 egg bunches in that time.\ndo. 18 do. 3 do.\ndo. 18 do. 3 do.\ndo. 28 do. 11 do.\ndo. 20 do. 7 do.\ndo. 25 do. 6 do.\ndo. 28 do. 8 do.\ndo. 16 do. 5 do.\n\nShewing an average of one egg bunch every $3\\frac{1}{2}$ days.\n\nThe longest lived of any of the insects kept in captivity was a female, which lived for 110 days, during which time she was twice paired, and laid 23 egg bunches in 75 days.\n\nAn exceptional pair, both of which died after being kept for 12 days, were observed in coitu for 9 consecutive days, but no egg bunch was ever laid.\n\nAn experiment of confining together 3 males and 3 females, distinguished by paint marks of different colours, shewed that they paired indiscriminately, and as freely as when kept by separate pairs.\n\n**Mortality.**\n\nAfter keeping the insects in captivity for about 5 months some 60 or 70 were put out free upon four small bushes of *Ipomea carnea*, and observed for the next 7 months.\n\nTheir habits as noted when kept in captivity, appear to be much the same when living in a state of freedom, though owing to their moving from one bush to another, and to the impossibility of distinguishing individuals, no very accurate observation could be made.\n\nFrom the numbers of egg bunches found on the leaves it would appear that they breed at the same rate when either\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nfree or in captivity; the great difference between the two states being in the mortality during the larval stages of life.\n\nDuring the earliest attempts at rearing the insects from the eggs, a very high rate of mortality was found to be the general rule. Egg bunches kept in a moist condition and exposed to the sun by day failed to hatch out at all. Young larvae similarly exposed to too great heat or moisture often lost 80 or 90 per cent of their numbers in the course of 24 hours. Young larvae if left too near to water at night, were frequently found with 50 per cent of their numbers drowned the next morning.\n\nConsequently out of a great many egg bunches, which hatched out an average of 30 to 40 larvae each, it was frequently the case that no more than 5 or 6 per cent reached the stage of pupa.\n\nThis very high rate of mortality was found to be, to a considerable extent, avoidable with extra care, the eggs being kept in well corked specimen tubes until they hatched out, the very young larvae being kept completely isolated from ants, with but little moisture, and plenty of shade.\n\nYet even when better methods of preserving them were practised, the mortality among young larvae was still, in most cases, as high as 30 or 40 per cent, apparently from natural causes, variations in weather, or in the quality of the food.\n\nThere is a considerable mortality too during the changes from larva to pupa, and from pupa to imago, in the free state as well as when in captivity; the following instances were noted:\n\nDuring the change from larva to pupa:\n\n| Out of | 20 larvae | 4 died |\n|-------|-----------|--------|\n| do.   | 5         | 3      |\n| do.   | 12        | 1      |\n| do.   | 20        | 2      |\n| do.   | 37        | 1      |\n| do.   | 41        | 1      |\n\nAverage nearly 9 per cent.\n\nJour.

This insect penetrating the chitinous covering of the Aspidomorpha\u2019s egg bunches, lays its eggs in the bunch.\n\nRain storms, when windy weather exposes the under surface of the leaves, wash off whole colonies of young *Aspidomorpha* larvae.\n\nProbably many larvae are destroyed by birds, though no actual instances of this have yet come under the observation of the writer.\n\nOf 60 or 70 insects put out to live in freedom, at first a good many disappeared. For some months afterwards the numbers gradually increased, but owing to the Ipomea bushes being very small, their growth was not able to keep pace with the destruction of their leaves, and after 7 months the total number of *Aspidomorpha* remaining had decreased to between 40 and 50, with a fair proportion of egg bunches, but very few larvae or pupae.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nNotes on Malay History.\n\nBy C. O. Blagden.\n\nI. Introductory.\n\nAbout a dozen years ago a comparison of the details of Malay history as given in the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu' (or \"Malay Annals\") with the information contained in the Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca (extracted and translated from various old Chinese sources by Mr. W. P. Groeneveldt) and with the section in the Commentaries of Alboquerque relating to the history of Malacca led me to the conclusion that the usual chronology, which dated the fall of Singapore and the foundation of Malacca in the year 1252 A.D. or thereabouts, was hopelessly untenable. The evidence available seemed to make it pretty clear that these events must be put somewhat more than a century later, probably somewhere about the year 1377 A.D., in fact. A short paper embodying this conclusion and some of the arguments leading to it was read by me before the Xlth Oriental Congress at Paris in 1897, and subsequently appeared in the printed transactions of that congress.\n\nThe arguments, in outline, were these. First, the received chronology gave absurdly long reigns to the Malacca Rajas: for instance four generations of them, from Sultan Muhammad Shah to Sultan Alauddin Shah inclusive, are made to cover a space of 201 years; which is extremely improbable and next door to impossible. Similarly the life of the great B\u0113ndahara Paduka Raja, a leading minister of state in Malacca in the 15th. century and one of the most striking figures in the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu, would (if we accept the ordinary chronology) cover about 130 years, during more than 100 of which he must have held the office of B\u0113ndahara! This is manifestly absurd. Secondly, the Chinese records, which in some cases are contemporary with the events they relate, give a list of the names\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nof the later Malacca Rajas. These names (with the dates attached to them) make it clear that their reigns fell within the 15th century and did not extend to the abnormal lengths that the ordinary chronology makes out. Thirdly, there is no mention of Malacca anywhere, in any authority that has hitherto come to light, prior to the early years of the 15th century. (1) This negative evidence, for what it is worth, supports the view that Malacca was not founded (or at any rate did not rise to the position of an important commercial emporium) much before the beginning of that century. On the other hand we find mention of the State of Pasei (better Pas\u00e8) in Sumatra at an earlier date. An abstract of its history is inserted in the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu as a sort of episode just before the account of the fall of Singapore. According to this account, with which the Hikayat Raja-raja Pasei in the main agrees, the first Muhammadan ruler of Pasei was a person who on his conversion to Islam took the name of Malik-al-Salih. His successor was his son Malik-al-Dzahir. Now the last named was reigning and was already a fairly old man when he was visited by the celebrated Arab globe-trotter Ibn Batutah in 1345 or 1346 A.D. The inference is that Muhammadanism became the established religion in Pasei somewhere about the year 1300 A.D. The Commentaries of Alboquerque record a native tradition that Iskandar Shah, one of the early Rajas of Malacca, was converted from Hinduism to Islam on the occasion of his marriage with a daughter of a Raja of Pasei. Whether that be so or not, the general trend of tradition goes to show that Pasei was regarded as being an older state than Malacca. All this evidence combined negatives the ordinarily received view that Malacca became Muhammadan in the reign of a Raja whose accession according to the commonly accepted chronology took place in 1276 A.D. or thereabouts. Fourthly, the Hikayat Raja-raja Pasei, which however is a work of uncertain and probably rather late date, speaks of a Javanese expedition of conquest successfully directed against Pasei, Jambi and Palembang, and shortly afterwards speaks of the\n\n(1) A possible exception, which I had not at that time seen, is dealt with in the present paper. It does not affect the argument.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nconquest by the Javanese of the dominions of the Raja of Ujong Tanah. This latter country is of course the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, known since the 16th century as Johore, and the dominions of its Raja included a number of island groups, such as the Riau-Lingga Archipelago, the Natunas, Anambas, etc., which are duly enumerated in the Hikayat Raja-raja Pasei. Now we know from Groeneveldt\u2019s Chinese sources that Palembang was taken by the Javanese in the year 1377 A.D. The inference is that the conquest of Ujong Tanah and its insular possessions (which must have included the island of Singapore) took place shortly after 1377 A.D. The foundation of Malacca must then be put at some intermediate date between 1377 and 1400 A.D.; and the establishment of Muhammadanism in that State cannot have taken place very many years before the close of the 14th century. When first visited by Chinese envoys in the first decade of the 15th century, it was a Muhammadan State.\n\nII. Allusions to Malays in the \u201cPararaton.\u201d\n\nI propose here to draw attention to a few additional data which confirm the conclusions already stated and throw a little more light on a very obscure period of Malay history. At the time of reading my paper I had not had access to the Javanese historical work styled the \u201cPararaton\u201d (i.e. Book of Kings), which has been edited and translated (with the addition of copious and valuable notes) by the late much lamented Dr. J. L. A. Brandes, a most eminent authority on the history of the Eastern Archipelago. This appeared in 1896 in Deel XLIX of the Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen. It is a work of uncertain date and authorship, but is probably in part based on more or less contemporary records of the events it relates, and is certainly older than 1600 A.D. It is of no great length; but it is one of the few professedly historical works in this part of the world that can really lay claim to some historical value. (Most Javanese and Malay histories are a blend throughout of fact and myth; but in the Pararaton only the beginning bears the stamp of being merely legendary). It contains\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\na large number of dates and covers the period 1222-1481 A.D. (in the original 1144-1403 Caka). This period includes the time when the great Javanese State of Majapahit was founded and flourished; and the Pararaton gives many interesting details about the history of Java during this epoch.\n\nIts allusions to Malay history are unfortunately (as is natural) much scantier. I will give them here briefly.\n\nThe first one occurs in the account of the reign of Cri Kertanagara, the last king of Tumapel, who reigned' (according to the Pararaton) from Caka 1194 to 1197' (1272-1275 A.D.) This king, we are told, \"sent his troops against Malayu.\" The immediate result of this unwise expedition, which left Tumapel almost defenceless (\"there were very few men left at Tumapel, most of them having been sent to Malayu\"), was the fall of his kingdom in the same year at the hands of another Javanese Raja, one Jaya Katong, of Daha. \"The expedition against Malayu and the fall of Tumapel occurred in the same year, 1197 Caka,\" i.e. 1275 A.D. Assuming this date to be correct, the expedition must have been on a considerable scale, and not a mere raid, for the troops, we are told, did not return till many years later, apparently in 1293 A.D. They brought back with them, as part of their booty, it may be presumed, two Malay princesses: one of these, by name Dara Petak was, subsequently married to Raden Wijaya, the first king of Majapahit, who bore the royal style of Cri Kertarajasa; the other, called Dara Jingga, became the wife of a high chief and the mother of the prince Tuhan Janaka, styled Cri Marmadewa, with the title of Ratu ring Malayu, and afterwards also styled Aji Mantrolot.\n\nThere is nothing to show us which Malay state in particular was the victim of this onslaught. But as from the close of the 7th century at least (and perhaps earlier) and for many centuries later the term \"Malayu\" was especially applied to the homeland of the Malays, i.e. Central Sumatra north-west of Palembang, it is probable that the Javanese expedition was directed against this region. In any case some\npart of Sumatra is almost certainly intended. During the interval between the despatch and the return of this expedition stirring events had occurred in Java. Majapahit had been founded and the well-known invasion of the island by the forces of Kublai Khan, the Mongol Emperor of China (called in the Pararaton \"Ratu Tatar\") had taken place. It is described in the Pararaton, but its details do not concern us here.\n\nI ought perhaps to add that while it seems to follow from the account in the Pararaton that King Kertanagara was killed by his enemies of Daha at the time when Tumapel fell, the facts are really otherwise. We know from an inscription dated Caka 1272' (1350 A.D.), reproduced with transliteration, translation and commentary by Professor Kern in the Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb' (Deel LVIII), that he did not actually die till the year Caka 1214' (1292 A.D.), shortly before the arrival of the Mongol expedition' (which reached Java in 1293 A.D.). This seems to throw some doubt on the correctness of the date on which the expedition is supposed to have been despatched to \"Malayu.\" But the point is not really very material.\n\nThe next mention in the Pararaton of Malay countries occurs in or after the account of the reign of a certain queen of Majapahit styled, (from her place of residence) Bhreng Kahuripan, whose reign began in 1331 A.D. In the year 1346 A.D. the celebrated Gajah Mada, whose name is familiar to the readers of Malay chronicles (which wrongly introduce him into their somewhat legendary accounts of the 15th. century) became apatih amangkubhumi, that is to say prime minister, of Majapahit. On a certain undated occasion' (but certainly after 1334 and presumably after 1346 A.D.) we are told that \"Gajah Mada, the apatih amangkubhumi\" made a vow that he would eat no palapa' (whatever that may be) \"until Nusantara shall have been subdued, until Gurun, Seran, Tanjung Pura, Haru, Pahang, Dompo, Bali, Sunda, Palembang and Tumasik shall have been subdued; then will I eat palapa,\" said he.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nOf these names, Nusantara is believed to denote the Archipelago generally, Gurun is Goram, Seran is Ceram, both in the Moluccas, Dompo is a state in the island of Sumbawa, Bali is the island lying immediately to the east of Java, Sunda is the western end of Java itself, and Palembang is of course the well-known place of that name in south-eastern Sumatra. Haru, which is often mentioned in the Sejarah Melayu, was a state on the east coast of Sumatra, Tanjung Pura is evidently Borneo or some particular spot in Borneo, where a place bearing that name did in fact exist. (I follow here the identifications given by Brandes). The names that particularly interest us are Pahang and Tumasik: the former requires no comment, the latter is certainly Singapore. In the Sejarah Melayu the old name of Singapore is given as, \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0643 which the Malays nowadays pronounce Temasak. It is evident, however, that there has been a break in the tradition here: they ought to call the place Temasek, as it is printed in the Romanised (1898) edition of the Sejarah Melayu, for that would be the proper Malay equivalent for the Javanese form Tumasik, and we shall meet with the latter form again in another Javanese work in the same connection. Brandes derives the name from tasek, \"sea\", and imagines an identification with Samudra' (near Pasei) but refers to the possibility of Singapore being meant. The Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb (s. v. Tochten, vol. IV, pp. 383-4), following Professor Kern, correctly identifies it with Singapore.\n\nEvidently, (and this is important as confirming the amended chronology of the Peninsula), Singapore was still in existence as a state unsubdued by Majapahit at the time when Gajah Mada made his vow, somewhere about the year 1346 A.D. probably. It could not therefore have been finally destroyed by the forces of Majapahit in 1252 A.D. (in which year, it may be remarked, Majapahit had not yet been founded).\n\nMost unfortunately there is at this point a lacuna in the text of the Pararaton and nothing whatever is told us of the important events which took place in pursuance of Gajah\nMada's declared policy of conquest, except that in 1357 A.D. he picked a quarrel with the Sundanese which ended in a bloody battle wherein they were defeated and slaughtered, and that in the same year an expedition from Majapahit conquered Dompo. \"Thereupon,\" we are told, \"Gajah Mada again made use of palapa.\"\n\nAre we entitled to infer that the whole of this great minister's programme of aggressive imperialism had been carried out at that date? Alas, no: for we know from Chinese sources that Palembang was not conquered till 1377 A.D., nine years after Gajah Mada's death (which the Pararaton puts in Caka 1290, i.e. 1368 A.D.). It would seem that he was not particular in adhering to the very letter of his vow (assuming it to be correctly-reported) but was content to put up with an instalment of his ambitious plan. Unfortunately the Pararaton thus leaves us in the dark as to the precise date when Singapore was taken and destroyed; but it makes it plain that the event must have happened in the 14th and not, as the old chronology has it, in the 13th century. I have already mentioned the fact that the Hikayat Raja-raja Pasei puts the conquest of \"the dominions of the king of Ujong Tanah\" shortly after that of Palembang. But it does not specifically mention Singapore, though its list of the islands conquered on this occasion includes Timbalan, Siantan' (in the original, Siatan), Jemaja, Bunguran, Serasan, Subi, Pulau Laut, Tioman, Pulau Tinggi, Pemanggilan, Karimata, Belitong, Bangka, Lingga, Riau, Bintan and Bulang.\n\nIII. The Evidence of the \"Nagarakretagama.\"\n\nProbably we shall never know the exact date of the fall of Singapore. But the evidence available may at any time be strengthened by some accidental discovery of a hitherto unknown record. Such a discovery occurred a few years ago when the Nagarakretagama unexpectedly turned up. This is a panegyric poem composed (according to the Encyclop\u00e6die van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb) in the year 1365 A.D. by a Javanese court poet, a Buddhist bearing the name of Prapan\u00f1cha, in hon-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nour of the then reigning sovereign of Majapahit. The king in question was Hayam Wuruk, known by the royal style of king Rajasanagara and also as Sang Hyang W\u00e9kasing Sukha, not to mention all his other titles. This monarch, who was a son of the queen already mentioned, appears to have ascended the throne at the age of 16 in the year 1350 A.D., his mother (who till then had acted as regent) having handed over the government to him in that year; and he reigned till his death in the year 1389 A.D. It was during his reign that the power of Majapahit really culminated and its political expansion reached its widest extent.\n\nThe poem, written in the Javanese language of that period, is an important historical document. The unique manuscript containing it was discovered by the late Dr. Brandes among the books of the last Balinese ruler of Lombok, when that island was taken under the immediate control of the Dutch colonial government. Dr. Brandes published it in Deel LIV of the Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen in 1902. Unfortunately he only gave the poem in the original Balinese script, without transliteration, translation notes or commentary, a circumstance which leaves it a sealed book except to an extremely limited number of specialists; for it is given to few (even amongst Dutch scholars) to understand 14th century Javanese and read the Balinese character readily. Under the circumstances one must be thankful that Professor Kern has given some information on the subject for the benefit of the general reader, who is not a Kawi scholar. In the Indische Gids for 1903 (I, pp. 341-360) he gave a general account of the contents of the poem, with particular reference to some of its geographical data, and in Deel LVIII (1905) and Deel LXI (1908) of the Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb he returned to the subject and dealt more particularly with some of the genealogical and chronological details contained in the poem. Colonel G. E. Gerini further dealt with some of the geographical data of the N\u00e1garak\u00e9t\u00e1gama, especially those connected with Siam and the Malay Peninsula, in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (July 1905), to which I wrote a\nreply contesting his claim of an ancient Siamese occupation of the whole Peninsula (J. R. A. S., January 1906). In the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb (s. v. Tochten, vol. IV, p. 384) the geographical data relating to the Archipelago and the Peninsula are again examined and some identifications suggested.\n\nThere is still scope for a few more remarks on these matters: the subject is one of local interest to the readers of this Journal, and some of the identifications that have been suggested require to be amended. The N\u0101garak\u0113t\u0101gama mentions a considerable number of places in the Eastern Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula as being subject to the empire of Majapahit. Beginning in Canto 13 with Sumatra, it specifies Jambi, Palembang, T\u0113ga, Dharm\u0101c\u0101raya, Kandis, Kanwas, Manangkabo, S\u012byak R\u0113kan, Kampar, Pane, Kampe, Haru, Mandahiling, Tumihang, Parlak, Barta, Lwas, Samudra, Lamuri, Batan, Lampung and Barus. \"These and some others lie in the land of Malayu,\" says the poem, as abstracted by Professor Kern. It then proceeds to deal with the dependencies on the island of Ta\u00f1jungnagara, which is clearly the same as the Ta\u00f1jung Pura of the Pararaton and is certainly Borneo, as the names of the several places on it sufficiently prove. They are: Kapuas, Katingan, Sampit, Kuta Lingga, Kuta Waringin, Sambas, Lawai, Kadangdangan, Landa, Sam\u0113dang, Tir\u0113m, S\u0113du, Buruneng' (probably for B\u0113runai-Brunei), Kalasaludung, Solot, Pasir, Baritu, Sawaku, Tabalung, Tu\u00f1jungkute, Malano, and the capital town Ta\u00f1jungpuri.\n\nThe poet next proceeds (in the second strophe of Canto 14) to enumerate a list of places, which like those in the two preceding lists, though not in strict geographical order, have evidently been grouped together because they belong to one definite region. This region, to which no general name appears to be attached, is the Malay Peninsula. The four lines in which they occur appear to me to read as follows in the printed text:\u2014\n\nikang sakahawan Pahang pramuka tang Hujung Medini\nre L\u0113ngkasuka len ri Sai mwangi Kalant\u0113n i Tringga\u00f1o\nNa\u00e7or Paka Muwar Dungun ri Tumasik ri Sang Hyang\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nHujung K\u0113lang K\u0113da J\u0113re ri Kanjapiniran sanu\u00e7a pupul.\n\nI cannot claim to be a Kawi scholar and it is quite possible that in my attempted transliteration I may have divided some of the Javanese words wrongly; the original runs most of them together without a break. But I am only concerned with the proper names which the passage contains, and as in the interpretation of some of these I venture to differ from previous commentators, it was necessary to quote the whole passage. The poet then goes on to detail the dependencies lying to the east-ward of Java, beginning with Bali and including a number of places in the Lesser Sunda Islands, the Moluccas and Celebes and even as far as New Guinea; in fact, covering practically the whole Archipelago except the Philippines. It is not necessary for my purpose to enumerate these places here. But the whole list gives a very good summary of the Archipelago as known to the Javanese in the 14th century of our era; and though in a good many cases the claim of supremacy may have been of a somewhat shadowy kind, yet the list is evidence of the predominant position held by the kingdom of Majapahit at this period.\n\nTo return now to the place-names more particularly connected with the Malay Peninsula: Pahang, Kalant\u0113n, Tringgano, K\u0113lang' (nowadays less accurately written Klang) and K\u0113da' (i.e. Kedah) are obvious and require no explanatory comment. It must not be assumed that they stand for the names of states: they probably represent the rivers, with tiny settlements at the mouth of each, that were the nuclei round which the respective states have developed. Hujung Medini is rendered by Professor Kern as \"Hudjung, Tanah;\" but I think the comma must be a misprint and agree with the Encyclop\u00e6die in interpreting it as the southern end of the Peninsula, the already mentioned Ujong Tanah, nowadays called Johore. \"Medini\" appears to mean the same thing as tanah. L\u0113ngkasuka has been rightly identified by Col. Gerinei with the Langkasuka mentioned in the Hikayat Marong Mahawangsa as an old capital of the state of K\u0113dah. It lay near Gunong J\u0113rai (K\u0113dah Peak), a considerable way south of the K\u0113dah\nRiver, and that is no doubt the reason why the two are separately mentioned. The Encyclop\u00e6die conjecturally identifies Lengkasuka with Selangor, which is certainly a mistake. Sai is one of the Patani states and lies to the north-west of Kelantan. At this point my reading differs from Professor Kern's. He reads the words Sai mwang together as one proper name, which he transliterates \"Semong.\" But I know of no such place-name and take mwang to be a particle, as in the passage in Canto 13 which reads Samudra mwang i Lamuri Batan Lampung mwang i Barus. Where the text has, apparently, \"Nacor,\" Professor Kern writes \"Nagor.\" Perhaps \"Na\u00e7or\" was a misprint. If it is right I do not know what it stands for. Nagor has been identified by the Encyclop\u00e6die with Ligor and I have no alternative explanation to suggest. But there is a difficulty here: for a place called Dharm\u0101\u1e45gari mentioned in Canto 15 of the poem has also (by Col. Gerini) been identified with Ligor. Moreover Ligor was at this period certainly tributary to Siam and could not with any show of reason be claimed by Majapahit.\n\nThe next two names, which I take to be Paka and Muwar, are read as one expression \"Pakamuwar\" by Professor Kern. The Encyclop\u00e6die suggests that they represent \"p\u0113kan Muar,\" that is to say a mart in the district of Muar or on the Muar river. I incline to think that they stand for two distinct places, viz. (a) Muar, which now forms part of Johore, (i.e. the mouth of the Muar river, not its upper course) and (b) a river on the East coast lying between Kemaman and Dungun in the state of Terengganu. Newbold' (vol. ii, p. 60 of his well known work on the Peninsula \"British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca\") spells it Pakaa; Skinner in his \"Geography of the Malay Peninsula\" (p. 29) calls it Paka; my friend Mr. W. W. Skeat informs me that the Society's map spells it Pake. The identification is conjectural, of course, and I put it forward with some diffidence. But it seems on the whole rather more probable than the \"p\u0113kan\" interpretation. The next name, Dungun, which is also a river-name, has just been incidentally accounted for and requires no further explanation. Tumasik,\nidentified in this connexion with the Island of Singapore by Professor Kern, Colonel Gerini and the Encyclop\u00e6die, may safely be said to be determined beyond all doubt or question: an additional piece of evidence regarding it will be mentioned later. Jere may, as the Encyclopaedie suggests, be Jering in the Patani states. But it might equally well stand for Gunong Jerai; only this district is already referred to by the mention of Lengkasuka.\n\nKanjapiuran has received no satisfactory explanation as yet. Clearly, if it is a Malay place-name and not altogether corrupt, the expression must be a compound one, not a single word.\n\nThere remains only Sang (Hyang) Hujung. This is rather an interesting name. Professor Kern writes it \"Sang Hyang Hudjun,\" but the original distinctly has a guttural nasal as the final of the last word. The Encyclopaedie conjecturally identifies it with Ujong Salang, i.e. Junk Ceylon. For this there is no shadow of evidence or probability. We must look for it elsewhere. I lay no stress at all on the fact of the name occurring between those of Tumasik and Kelang: the N\u0101garak\u1e5b\u0113\u1e6d\u0101gama is a poem, not a geography book' (the more's the pity, for our purpose), and the exigencies of metre may have influenced the writer more than any considerations of topography. But the very form of the name appears to me to speak for itself. It is evidently the \u0633\u0646\u062c\u0648\u06a0 of the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu, which we must transliterate San-yang' (or Saniang or Seniang, not Sening) Hujong (or Ujong). Shellabear's Romanised edition of 1898' (pp. 43 and 81) has Sening Ujong. Leyden in his translation' (\"Malay Annals\" 1821), being no doubt guided by native tradition, has on p. 88 Sangang Ujong and on p. 191 Senyang Ujong. In short it is the district now known as Sungai (or Sungei) Ujong, locally often called S\u0113mujong (on the same principle that the title Yang di-pertuan becomes in the Menangkabau dialect Yampituan and Yamtuan). This name Sungai Ujong has long been a puzzle to etymologists. If it meant anything, it could only mean \"the river of the cape (or corner) or else \"the Ujong river,\" whatever\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthat might be. But there exists no river of that name: the name is not a river-name at all but the name of a small stretch of coast-line, and though there is an important cape there it has no river alongside of it. One popular etymology is reported by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey in No. 13 of this Journal, p. 241. But it is as impossible as most popular etymologies usually are and is moreover mixed up with an equally improbable explanation of the name of the state of Rembau. It is really not worth repeating here, for the 14th century Javanese name explains everything. The modern name Sungai Ujong is evidently a corruption (through the 17th century San-yang Hujong) of the old Sang Hyang Hujung, which means much the same as our \"Holyhead.\"\n\nThe reference is to the promontory usually called Cape Rachado, from the Portuguese name, which the Malays nowadays style Tanjong Tuan. It is a celebrated kramat or shrine and has of course its local legend. (1) Nowadays I fancy it is supposed to be the tomb of some orthodox Muhammadan saint or worthy. But in fact it is an old animistic holy place going back to very ancient times and owing its origin to a simple natural phenomenon. The reason for the special sanctification of the spot is incidentally given by Begbie' (\"The Malayan Peninsula,\" p. 422) and Newbold' (op. cit., vol. ii, p. 38). It is merely that at this cape two strong and opposing currents meet and cause a dangerous eddy or race in which boats are liable to be upset. Hence it has naturally come about that, to use Newbold's phrase, \"the Dattu Tanjong Tuan, the elder of Cape Rachado, is a saint of no ordinary celebrity among the sea-faring class of natives.\"\n\nThat exhausts the names connected with the Peninsula contained in the passage I have extracted from the N\u0101garakre\u1e6d\u0101gama. I gather from Professor Kern's abstract that the last two words imply that besides the places specified there were several groups of islands which the poet has not thought it\n\n(1) The legend has been put on record by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey in \"Man\" (1904), pp. 266; but at the moment of writing I am unable to refer to it for the purpose of seeing whether it throws any additional light on the origin of the name Sungai Ujong.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nnecessary to name. Unfortunately these old names tell us very little about the condition of the Peninsula at the period when the N\u0101garakr\u0113t\u0101gama was written. But they tell us something. We need not follow the loyal and courtly Prapa\u00f1cha in claiming that Majapahit exercised a real supremacy over all these places; Palembang was not conquered by the Javanese until a dozen years later and yet it is included amongst the dependencies of Majapahit in the poem. It is equally improbable that such outlying places as K\u0113lant\u0101n and Sai were genuinely subject to Majapahit. But the list of Peninsular names suffices at any rate to negative the view recently put forward by Mr. R. J. Wilkinson in \"Papers on Malay Subjects\" (History, Part I, p. 8) that the Malay colonisation of the Peninsula dates only from the year 1400 A.D. Evidently there were already in the middle of the 14th century a number of settlements scattered along the coast-line, both on the east and on the west side of the Peninsula. (It is noticeable that unlike the names relating to Sumatra none of the Peninsular names given in the N\u0101garakr\u0113t\u0101gama have any reference to the interior of the country: they are settlements on the coast or barely a few miles inland). Some of these settlements even then bore the same names as they do at the present day and one or two of these names are distinctly Malay. Langkasuka is no doubt of Indian origin, Nagor (if that be the right reading) is Indian modified by Indo-Chinese pronunciation, K\u0113lang K\u0113dah and J\u0113re may possibly be of Mon-Khmer origin, Sai is perhaps Siamese, and most of the others I would not try to explain. But K\u0113lant\u0101n seems to be Malayan in form, and Dungun is the Malay name for a common seashore tree (according to Mr. H. N. Ridley in No. 30 of this Journal, pp. 87 & 44). Of course Sang Hyang Hujung is Malayan also, but it is just the sort of name that mariners give to a notable landmark and by itself it would not be evidence of actual Malay settlement but merely of Malay navigation and trade. Taking these names, however, as a whole, I think they support the inference that before 1365 A.D. the Malays had already colonised both coasts of the Peninsula. It is also pretty clear that at that date Singapore was still in existence and that Malacca had not yet been founded: for a list that enumerates K\u0113lang, Sun-\ngai Ujong, Singapore and (probably) Muar would hardly have omitted Malacca, which lies between these places, if it had existed at that time. This string of names therefore once more confirms the amended chronology that I have suggested.\n\nWithout laying any particular stress on the fact, I think it is worth while drawing attention to the considerable gaps left by the N\u0101garakr\u0113t\u0101gama in its enumeration. The Encyclopaedia points out the omission of S\u0113nggora and Patani. It is equally noticeable that there is a complete blank between K\u0113dah and K\u0113lang: not a single place on the coast of Perak is mentioned. The same is true of the coast-line intervening between the Pahang river and Point Rum\u0113nia. It may be surmised that there were at that early date no settlements of any note along those two strips of coast.\n\nIV. Further Details from the Wu-Pei-Pi-Shu Charts.\n\nA brief reference must be made to some additional almost contemporary evidence which serves to confirm that of the N\u0101garakr\u0113t\u0101gama in some points and to supplement it in others. For reasons which will presently be obvious I cannot pretend to do justice to this independent source, and I regret that I can only use it as a sort of appendix to what has already been said, instead of dealing with it as adequately as it deserves. The evidence in question is that of the Chinese charts appended to a Chinese work called the Wu-pei-pi-shu, by one She, Yung-t\u2019oo. This work, it appears from two papers in Vol. XX., pp. 209-226 and Vol. XXI., pp. 30-42 of the Journal of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, is a relatively modern compilation but embodies much material taken straight out of considerably older books. Mr. G. Phillips, the author of the two papers just referred to, considers that the charts appended to it are older than the commencement of the fifteenth century. They are alleged to be the charts used by the Chinese captains who navigated the vessels conveying the celebrated Chinese envoy Ch\u0113ng Ho (commonly called Sam-po) and his suite to the various southern and western countries which he visited. (This envoy, I may parenthetically observe, is recorded to have visit-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909\ned Malacca in 1409 A.D. The list of many other places which he visited in the course of his official career is given in an extract from the History of the Ming Dynasty by Mr. W. P. Groeneveldt in his valuable \"Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca,\" reprinted in \"Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China and the Indian Archipelago,\" 2nd Series, Vol. I., p. 170. He went as far afield as Magadoxu in East Africa.\n\nMr. G. Phillips has published facsimiles of these charts in the form of a long continuous strip, divided for convenience into two parts. The part relating to the regions to the eastward of Tenasserim appears in Vol. XXI., of the S. China Branch R.A.S. and is the one that concerns us here. It contains a great deal of geographical information in a much distorted shape. There is no approach to accuracy in its plotting of the outlines of the different countries set down in it. Thus the coast of the Malay Peninsula is laid down as an irregular line, following one almost uniform direction from right to left of the chart, all the way between Senggora and Tenasserim. In fact it is plainly the record of an actual coasting voyage or voyages. Islands are marked in various places along the coast; and both on these and on many points of the coastline itself appear Chinese characters. Many of these characters represent in transcription the native names of places. Others appear to be Chinese descriptive names. A good many of these various place names have been identified by Mr. Phillips. But he appears to have omitted a certain number of others. His transliteration of the Chinese characters follows a dialect which is evidently not the one in which they were intended to be read and does not tend to facilitate identification. Probably too a good deal of additional light could be thrown on these names by some one possessed of local knowledge. I therefore venture to invite the attention of Chinese scholars in the Straits to these charts and suggest that they should bring their combined local knowledge and Chinese scholarship to bear upon them.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Phillips' labours enable me to quote a certain number of place names recorded in this chart. Pro-\nceeding from right to left and starting at S\u00ebnggora \u5b6b\u59d1\u90a3 Sun-ku-na, we pass four groups of unexplained Chinese characters and then arrive at the K\u00e9lantan river \u5409\u862d\u4e39\u6e2f Keih-lan-tan-kiang. Next on the coastline comes Tr\u00ebngganu \u4e01\u52a0\u4e0b\u8def Ting-kia-hia-lu, then the Pahang river \u5f6d\u5751\u6e2f P'eng-keng-kiang, then a place called \u7b54\u90a3\u6eaa\u5dbc(1) Ta-na-ki-seu which Mr. Phillips has not identified, and then \u6de1\u99ac\u932b Tan-ma-seih, which, as Colonel Gerini has rightly pointed out, is our old acquaintance Tumasik or Temasek, otherwise Singapore. Curiously enough this is represented as being on the mainland, which shows that at this date the Chinese shipping already passed through the New Straits to the south of the island of Singapore, not through the Old Straits to the north of it.\n\nThus far we have been coasting along the east coast of the Peninsula. Dotted alongside of it in the chart, from a little to the right (i.e. north) of K\u00e9lantan onwards, are figured a number of named islands, some of which have been identified by Mr. Phillips, others not. Nearly opposite Ta-na-ki-seu the course laid down on the chart runs past an island marked \u767d\u7901 Pei-chiao, leaving it on the left or port side. This island Mr. Phillips identifies with Pedra Branca. The course then runs amongst a number of islands, leaving three to the right\u2019 (starboard, north) and four islands and a shoal, all named,\n\n(1) \u5dbc = \u201cisland\u201d\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nto the left (port, south) side. (1) Tan-ma-seih is marked on the coast just opposite the second of the starboard islands. After passing the shoal to port, the course runs between Karimun\n\n\u5409\u5229\u9580 Keih-li-men, which it likewise leaves to port,\n\nand Pulau Pisang \u6bd4\u5b8b\u5dbc Pi-sung-seu, leaving the latter to starboard. This seems to me to clinch the Tumasik = T\u0113ma-sek = Tan-ma-seih = Singapore equation absolutely. (2)\n\nOf course the chart is not evidence that Singapore was still an inhabited settlement at the time when it was compiled. Maps and charts often contain names that are merely traditional: they are usually compilations embodying the notes and records of several generations of travellers and navigators. Besides, names often adhere to sites long after they have ceased to be inhabited. We shall see in a moment that this is probably the case in the present instance, for the next thing on the chart after Pulau Pisang 'and wrongly put quite close to\n\n(1) The starboard islands, so far as I can make out, are marked\n\n(a) \u5b98\u5dbc (b) \u7435\u7436\u5dbc (c) \u9577\u8170\u5dbc the port islands\n\n(d) \u99ac\u9769\u5c71 (e) \u7435\u6493\u5dbc (f) \u725b\u5c4e\u78bc (g) \u51c9\u5098\u5dbc\n\n(f) and (g) lie just opposite (below) (c). The shoal (h) \u6c99\u7cd6\u6dfa lies just to the felt (west) of (g) and a bit further, on the south-west apparently, comes Karimun.\n\nMr. Phillips conjecturally identifies (c), which he transliterates Chang-yau-seu, with Singapore island; but I think it represents some small island lying to the south of Singapore island. Perhaps it is Pulau Panjang: the Chinese name means \"Long Waist Island.\"\n\n(2) Cf. Pelliot, in Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extr\u00eame Orient, 1904, Tome IV., p. 345 and Gerini, J. R. A. S., July 1905, Part III., pp. 500-1. The first named paper is a long and learned dissertation in which a very large number of problems of historical geography relating to South-Eastern Asia are exhaustively discussed. It teems with references to all manner of sources, Asiatic and European, and should be referred to by all who are interested in these questions.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nit) is an estuary in the coastline, on the further (right geographical) bank of which is a mountain or headland marked \u8eab\u7bad\u5c71 Sia-ch'ien-shan, presumably Tanjong Sagenting, Batu Pahat, as Mr. Phillips suggests. The course after leaving Pulau Pisang passes some half a dozen unnamed islands on the starboard side and then puts in at an inlet or river-mouth on the left geographical bank of which is the entry \u6ee1\u523a\u52a0 which Mr. Phillips transcribes Muan-la-kia, adding that the Amoy pronunciation of the characters is Moa-la-ka. There is no sort of doubt that Malacca is intended: the same characters are uniformly used in the various Chinese sources translated by Groeneveldt. Probably if the other names in the chart were read with their Hokkien sounds it would make the whole thing more intelligible. On the right geographical bank of the same inlet is the entry \u5b98\u5ee0 which Mr. Phillips has not explained.\n\nI may add that the sailing directions inscribed on the chart rectify the rough drawing of the chart itself. They run in the opposite direction to that which I have been following, and go from Samudra via Malacca to China. I extract the following from Mr. Phillips' version of them: \"Going from Malacca for five watches the vessel sights Sejin Ting and Batu Pahat river, three watches from which Pesang island is reached, and in five watches more Carimon is reached, five watches more S.E. by E. brings the vessel off Long Waist island (Singapore?) and into the Linga Straits, (') through which for five watches on a course E. by a very little N. the White Rock, Pedra Branca, is reached.\" The course then proceeds in five more watches N.E. by N. to the eastward of Pulau Aor, and thence to Pulau \"Condor\" and so on past Cape St. James to China. It is plain that these sailing directions confirm the identifications already given.\n\n(1) This term is here improperly transferred from the Lingga Straits to the Straits of Singapore.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nContinuing to follow the coast of the Peninsula as laid down in the chart, I find next after the inlet where Malacca is marked, a place called \u5047\u4e94\u5dbc Kia-wu-seu, which Mr. Phillips identifies as \"Fisher's islet (?)\". The Chinese name appears to mean \"False Five Islands\" but the characters are on the mainland itself. Remembering that \"Five Islands\" is an old Chinese name for Malacca, it may be conjectured that this entry refers to the neighbourhood of Port Dickson and Cape Rachado. Next, after coasting a considerable distance, is reached \u7dbf\u82b1\u5dbc Mien-hua-seu, as it appears to read in Mr. Phillips' dialect (though he has not transliterated it), just near which in the sea is marked \u7d72\u82b1\u6dfa Mien-hua-chien, which Mr. Phillips identifies as South Shoals. The names appear to be purely Chinese descriptions, not attempts to reproduce genuine native names. The second name appears in the midst of four or five small unnamed islands lying off the mouth of an inlet marked \u5409\u4ee4\u6e2f Keih-ling-kiang, \"Kling river.\" I should like to read \"Kelang river\" if the Chinese characters allow of such a pronunciation, as to which question I express no opinion. Next, somewhat inland, is marked \u5409\u90a3\u5927\u5c71 Keih-na-ta-shan, unidentified. Then, but some distance further, we pass an island marked \u4e5d\u5dde Kin-chou, \"Sambilangs,\" evidently the group of islands off the Perak coast known as Pulau Sembilan, the Nine Islands: the Chinese name means the same thing as the Malay one. Next, but somewhat further out to sea, are put two islands close together, they second and larger of which is marked \u9673\u516c\u5dbc which name Mr. Phillips does not explain. These lie nearly opposite a wide river-mouth. A very little further on, but quite close to the mainland, lies\nPing-lang-seu, which (if these charts are really over 500 years old) is, I suppose, the first recorded mention of Pulau Pinang, commonly called Penang. On the same assumption, that they are the charts used for Cheng Ho's voyages, the above noticed mention of Malacca is also the first on record; for apart from these charts Malacca is first described in the account written by Ma Huan in 1416 A.D., this Ma Huan being a Chinese Muhammadan who had accompanied Cheng Ho as interpreter on his travels. Cheng Ho's first voyage was undertaken in 1405 A.D. and as it may be assumed that his ship-captains made use of the most up-to-date charts they could obtain, the mention of Malacca need not surprise us, for that town had then probably been in existence for 20 or 25 years. But of course we cannot be sure that the charts, even supposing them to be really old, have not been somewhat modified and brought up to date since Cheng Ho's time. My point is that whatever may be their actual date in their present shape, they undoubtedly embody some very ancient data, as the case of Tan-ma-seih sufficiently proves. Whether the entry referring to Penang goes back 500 years or not I leave as an open question, though I see no reason why it should not: the island is a very conspicuous object to mariners navigating along that coast.\n\nNext after Penang island is a well-marked river-mouth in the coastline, lettered Keih-ta-kiang, that is to say the Kedah river, and a little further on an island marked Lung-ya-kiao-yi, undoubtedly from its position representing the Langkawi islands though the Chinese name is much distorted from the original. Next comes an island bearing the five characters \u53e4\u529b\u7531\u4e0d\u6d1e which Mr. Phillips does not explain, and here we appear to be pretty well at the limit of the Malay Peninsula proper, for the next place\nmarked on the coastline bears the characters \u7368\u639b\u982d\u5c71 (also unexplained: perhaps they represent Takua headland, if there is one?) and then, after passing two rivers and several unnamed islands, we reach Tenasserim, which lies outside my present sphere of interest.\n\nV. Prehistoric Speculations and Conjectures.\n\nThe evidence here put together gives, I think, an outline picture of what the Malay Peninsula was in the second half of the 14th century, which though very sketchy is not altogether without interest to us moderns. One would like to peer further back into the dim past of this region and form some sort of idea as to when the process of Malay colonisation began. But unfortunately there is very little evidence to help us. Mr. Wilkinson hypothetically gives Singapore a very short lease of life, (from 1360 (?) to 1377 A.D., he suggests). That however is quite impossible: to have made the impression that it did on Malay legend and tradition, it must have lasted much longer and I see no reason why it should not have flourished during the reigns of five generations of kings, as the S\u0113jarah Melayu asserts. That would give it an existence of about a century as a Malay settlement, say from about 1280 A.D. to the time of its destruction about 1337 A.D. As a matter of fact there is some evidence that a settlement had existed upon this spot at an even earlier date: but we do not know that it was a Malay one and it may have been a Mon-Khmer colony. Crawfurd in his Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Island, p. 402, records that among the ruins of the old Singapore (which amounted to very little when we acquired the place in 1819 A.D.) were found some Chinese coins the oldest of which bore the name of an emperor who died in 967 A.D. Unfortunately he omits to tell us what the dates of the remaining coins were and how many different specimens of Chinese coinage were represented in the find, although that information would have been very much to the point. Of course it is not safe to assume that there was a settlement at Singapore as\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nearly as the 10th century simply because a Chinese coin of that period has been found there. But on the facts it does seem probable that there was a trading station there considerably before the middle of the 13th century.\n\nColonel Gerini, in his article already referred to, has devoted a good deal of ingenious speculation and conjecture to the question of the antiquity of Singapore in pre-Malay times. But I fear that the conclusions he arrives at are merely hypothetical. They depend largely on suggested etymologies of local names which do not carry conviction. If, however, he is right (as I think he probably is) in his theory that there was once an old Mon-Khmer trading station on the island of Singapore, it is certain that it must have been abandoned somewhere about the middle of the 13th century (if not earlier). For at that period the Siamese became finally the masters of the whole Menam valley and a generation or so later Ligor, as well as Tenasserim and Tayoy, became tributary to the Siamese kingdom whose capital was at Sukhothai. *Colonel Gerini claims that about 1280 A.D. the Siamese conquered not merely Ligor but the whole of the Malay Peninsula. One can only say that up to the present there is no sufficient evidence to support such a claim. If they conquered it then, why did they let it go again a few generations later?\n\nAlthough there seems to be no sufficient reason for believing that the Siamese ever subdued the whole of the Peninsula, there is evidence that at this period they came into conflict with the Malays. In the History of the Yuan dynasty there is an entry stating that in the first year of the period Yuan-Cheng (i.e. 1295) an embassy was sent by Siam to the court of China, on which occasion \"as the Siamese had for a long time past been at war with the \u9ebb\u91cc\u5b50\u5152 (Malays), both peoples submitted (i.e. to the majesty of China) and an Imperial order was issued to the Siamese saying: 'Do no hurt to the Malays, so that you may keep your promise'.\" This entry is quoted in Bowring's Kingdom and People of Siam, Vol. I, p. 71 and has\n\n*Gerini, Historical Retrospect of Junkceylon Island, in Journal of the Siam Society, 1905, p. 131.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nbeen discussed by the late Professor Schlegel in T'oung Pao, Vol. IX, No. 4. *He thinks that it must refer to the Malays of the Peninsula: it does not seem likely that the Siamese could have had prolonged hostilities with Sumatra at this period. I think he is right as to that point and interpret the entry as recording the fact that when the Siamese, after asserting their supremacy over Ligor, pressed further southward into the northern parts of the Peninsula, they came into conflict with the Malays who had already at that time colonised the country. This would throw back the beginnings of regular Malay settlement in the Peninsula well into the middle of the 13th century, if not earlier, and I see no reason why that should not be so. At any rate it is quite certain that Mr. Wilkinson's 1400 A.D. is much too late. Malacca was not, in point of time, the first Malay settlement on the mainland; it rose rapidly to a position of predominance which overshadowed its older neighbours, but it by no means marks the beginnings of Malay immigration into the Peninsula.\n\nHere I must take leave of this subject. It may be convenient if I state briefly the general conclusions which the evidence here adduced appears to me to establish. They are as follows:\n\n(1) that the Malay colonisation of the Peninsula was already in progress in the 13th century;\n(2) that Singapore, as a Malay settlement, was founded in that century (or possibly even earlier);\n(3) that Singapore was still in existence throughout the first 60 or 70 years of the 14th century and must have been conquered and destroyed by the Javanese of Majapahit shortly after 1377 A.D.\n(4) that Malacca was not founded till some short time after 1377 A.D.\n(5) that the reigning family of Malacca did not become converted to Muhammadanism until very near the end of the 14th century\n\n*Pelliot, loc. cit. p. 242, gives the same entry as well as a number of others' (p. 324 et seq.) mentioning the Malays. I have followed his version.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nFrom Central India to Polynesia:\n\nA NEW LINGUISTIC SYNTHESIS.\n\nBY C. O. BLAGDEN.\n\nIn the undermentioned essay (1) that indefatigable worker, Professor W. Schmidt, of M\u00f6dling, Austria, has taken another great stride along the line of research that he has marked out for himself and made peculiarly his own. In order to appreciate the nature and importance of his latest contribution, it is necessary to refer to the history of the problems he has been investigating. A quarter of a century ago the existence and extent of the principal language-families of Southern and South-Eastern Asia and the Indian Archipelago had been established in broad outlines. (2) But there remained a considerable number of forms of speech, some of them known only by name in those days, others already more or less adequately put on record and studied, which did not seem to fit into the accepted classification and had to be left, in little groups of doubtful coherence or even as isolated stragglers, outside the general scheme. This was the case in particular of the Kolarian (now renamed Munda) languages of Central India, of Khasi, of the Mon or Talaing language which is gradually dying out in Lower Burma, of Khmer or Cambojan, Annamese, and an endless string of dialects, some of them hardly known even now, in the inland parts of Indo-China, of the dialects of the Nicobar islanders, and those of the Sakai and Sembang of the Malay Peninsula.\n\n(1) Die Mon-Khmer-V\u00f6lker, ein Bindeglied zwischen V\u00f6lkern Zentralasiens und Austronesiens.\u2014Archiv f\u00fcr Anthropologie, Neue Folge, Band V, Heft 1 und 2.\u2014Braunschweig, 1906.\n\n(2) R. N. Cust's \"Sketch of the Modern Languages of the East Indies\" may be referred to for particulars of what had been ascertained about that time.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nIt is true that long before the period referred to attempts had been made to include some of these unsorted items in the regular system of classification which comparative philology endeavours to achieve. Beginning more than half a century ago with Logan's suggestive but too speculative dissertations, it has pretty frequently been pointed out that there are some apparent points of resemblance, if not of connexion, between several of these linguistic derelicts. But as often as a connexion was asserted by one scholar it was denied by another; and as strict proof was not (and in most cases, owing to the inadequacy of the available evidence, could not be) offered, the matter remained unsettled. Of late years additional material for the study of most of these languages has been collected, making it possible to undertake a more systematic investigation into their peculiarities and mutual relations. On this latter task Professor Schmidt has been engaged for some time past. Starting with the conclusions arrived at by Kuhn in his valuable \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Sprachenkunde Hinterindiens,\" (3) that there is a common element running through these different languages but that it would be rash to group them all in one family, Professor Schmidt began in his monograph \"Die Sprachen der Sakei und Semang auf Malakka und ihr Verh\u00e4ltnis zu den Mon-Khmer-Sprachen\" (4) with an enquiry into the Sakai and S\u00e9mang dialects of the Malay Peninsula and their relations to the most ancient group of Southern Indo-Chinese languages.\n\nThis important paper was reviewed at some length in No. 39 of this Journal: it suffices to say here that it claimed to establish by strict proof a real genealogical relationship between these two groups of languages, the Southern Indo-Chinese and the Peninsular. In the year 1905 the learned author followed it up with two more studies in the same line of research. His\n\n(3) Sitzungsberichte d. K. Bayer. Akad. d. Wissensch., Phil.-hist. Kl., 1889, I, p. 219 seq.\n\n(4) Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb, 6e Volgreekse, 8e Deel (Deel LII), 1901.\n\"Grundz\u00fcge einer Lautlehre der Mon-Khmer-Sprachen\" (5) laid down for the first time the main lines of the comparative phonology of the Mon, Khmer, Stieng and Bahnar languages. Although perhaps subject to future modification in matters of detail, there can be no doubt that this work gives a new insight into the phonetic structure and past history of these tongues and is an acquisition of permanent value. In his \"Grundz\u00fcge einer Lautlehre der Khasi-Sprache in ihren Beziehungen zu denjenigen der Mon-Khmer-Sprachen\" (6) he goes on to show that Khasi, a language spoken in Assam, which had generally been regarded as standing quite alone, is really a distant relative (though not an actual member) of the Mon-Khmer group, and exhibits a similar structure, both phonetic and morphological. All these languages are in fact built up on the same system, viz. from very simple monosyllabic roots to which are added in many cases one or more prefixes or infixes. The same work also for the first time established the fact that the Palaung, Wa and Riang dialects of Upper Burma and the Shan States constitute a linguistic group standing midway between Khasi and the Mon-Khmer family, a fact which agrees remarkably well with the relative geographical position of these several groups.\n\nIn his most recent work on this subject Professor Schmidt points out that to this list of cognate languages must now be added the Nicobar dialects, which are not (as had previously been maintained) essentially polysyllabic but are built up just like all the others from monosyllabic roots. In the Nicobarese dialects, however, there is the important difference that not only prefixes and infixes but also suffixes are used in the structure of their words. This last fact is regarded by Professor Schmidt as a material piece of evidence in favour of grouping the Munda languages, which make a great use of suffixes, with the others already mentioned.

Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nis a considerable common element, as he shows, in the vocabularies of all these different groups of languages and also a good deal of similarity in the way they use their prefixes and infixes. Professor Schmidt claims, therefore, to have made out their common origin and connexion as a new family of languages, which he proposes to call the \"Austroasiatic\" family on account of the geographical position of its members, lying as they do scattered over the south-eastern corner of the Asiatic continent. This family is to include all the above mentioned languages, extending from Central India to the Malay Peninsula, inclusive.\n\nSo far, this result may be said to embody and confirm conclusions the probability of which had already been tentatively foreshadowed by previous investigators. Professor Schmidt has accumulated fresh evidence in their favour and invested them with a much higher degree of probability. He now proceeds to take a further step, by connecting his \"Austroasiatic\" family of languages with the great Malayo-Polynesian family (as it has hitherto been called), to which Malay and the other languages of Indonesia, Polynesia and Melanesia (with the exception of the Papuan languages) belong. Thus, if this view be tenable, Sakai and Malay would after all be real, though very distant, relations, linguistically.\n\nThis is indeed a bold conception; but in order to appreciate the value of it, the evidence on which it rests must be considered and for that purpose the article itself must be consulted. No attempt can be made to reproduce its details here. Suffice it to say that in its main lines this conclusion is based on the recognised and generally accepted results of the comparative study of the Malayo-Polynesian languages and is an attempt to carry that line of investigation to its logical outcome. These languages in their present stage of development are (as is well known) made up of stem-words which are mostly of two syllables. There would seem therefore to be a fundamental difference between their structure and that of the \"Austroasiatic\" tongues with their monosyllabic roots. But research into the Malayo-Polynesian languages has shown that in very many cases their stem-words have been built up from earlier monosyl-\nlables. This has usually, as in the \"Austroasiatic\" languages, been done by means of some prefix, and it is therefore as a rule the last syllable of a Malayo-Polynesian stem-word that represents the original root. But sometimes an infix and occasionally a suffix appears to have been used. Professor Schmidt's view is that the Malayo-Polynesian roots were originally all monosyllabic and that the modern stem-words of two syllables with which we are familiar have been formed from the original roots by the agglutination of formative elements. These last, he conceives, once had a more or less definite function in the way of differentiating the meaning of the root, but have now become quite fossilised and being no longer separable from the root are regarded as an essential part of the word. Thus it is that the Malayo-Polynesian languages possess very few monosyllabic words but a very large proportion of words of two syllables.\n\nIf this view of the structure of the Malayo-Polynesian languages is correct (and it is certainly consistent with the results of the study of those languages by several independent scholars of great authority), clearly a great step has been taken towards bridging the apparent gulf between them and the \"Austroasiatic\" family. It must further be observed that on this old fossilised structure the Malayo-Polynesian tongues have superimposed a newer system of formatives which serve the purpose of differentiating grammatical functions. Thus they deal with their stem-words in much the same way as they are supposed to have dealt (and the \"Austrosiatic\" languages are known to have dealt) with the original monosyllabic root-words. There is a considerable amount of analogy between these different families of speech in the use and even in the form of the prefixes and infixes which they respectively employ. The most striking cases, perhaps, are the prefix pa-, which in the Mon-Khmer languages, Nicobarese and the Malayo-Polynesian family forms causatives, and the infixes -n- and -m- which, with somewhat varying functions, are found in a good many of these different languages. There are other points of grammatical analogy enumerated in Professor Schmidt's article: but they are somewhat less cogent and it would take up\ntoo much space to discuss them here. Finally, in an appendix he gives over 200 groups of words in which in his opinion a comparison between the \"Austroasiatic\" and the Malayo-Polynesian' (or, as he proposes to style them, \"Austronesian\") forms shows an identity of root.\n\nWith regard to these verbal comparisons, I must say that while some of them are not at first sight very convincing, yet there is a considerable proportion where the analogy is so striking that one can hardly attribute it to mere chance coincidence. In compiling the comparative vocabulary of aboriginal dialects contained in \"Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula\" I was often struck by the curious analogies presented by Malay words on the one hand and Mon-Khmer words on the other, so that in some cases it seemed impossible to decide with which set of languages a given aboriginal word was most closely connected. In No. 38 of this Journal I had ventured tentatively to account for the occurrence of similar words in Malayan languages and Mon and Khmer by the suggestion that they might be ancient Malayan loanwords in the Mon-Khmer languages, derived by them from the now extinct Malayan dialects of Southern Indo-China. That such loanwords do exist there can be no doubt; but I now see that this explanation is quite inadequate. It cannot account for the large number of analogies pointed out by Professor Schmidt in his last paper, especially now that Khasi and Munda have been brought into the comparison. For here, surely, Malayan influence is quite excluded. Thus the Bahmar word t\u014dl\u0113y, \"rope\", might well be suspected of being a mere Malayan loanword (from the Cham l\u0101lei); but when we find tyllai in Khasi, we no longer feel able to account for the latter form in this way and may even have our doubts about the Bahmar word. On the other hand Professor Schmidt concedes that the Bahmar d\u014dnau, \"lake\", may well be a loanword from the Malayo-Polynesian languages: he has not succeeded in finding it in other Mon-Khmer languages. I may suggest that it comes from the Cham danau.\n\nI think there can be no objection to my giving a small selection from the 215 instances in Professor Schmidt's ap-\nIn the following cases there seems to be really no doubt that the roots are identical (I give extracts only): No. 6 Malay r\u0113k\u0101t (to which I think should be added l\u0113k\u0101t and ik\u0101t) = Bahnar k\u016bt, k\u014dt, \u201cto bind\u201d, Mon d\u0101kat, \u201cto knot\u201d; No. 7 Malay, etc. takut = Khmer kot, Mon tak\u016bt, \u201cto fear\u201d; No. 182 Malay t\u0113l\u016bt = Khmer lut, \u201cto bend (the knee)\u201d, Bahnar lot, \u201cto enter in a bowed attitude\u201d; No. 183 Malay t\u0113lan, etc. = Bahnar l\u016b\u014dn, Stieng l\u016b\u014dn, \u201cto swallow.\u201d There are a good many more that could be quoted. On the other hand some of the comparisons seem to me exceedingly dubious. Even when the correspondence in form is to all appearance very close, it often happens that the connexion in meaning strikes one as being uncommonly far-fetched. There seems to be here a gap in the method of such investigations. What we want to guide us through the mazes of derived and cognate words, is a science of the relations of the secondary meanings of words to their primary ones. I believe that the groundwork of such a science has already been laid down for some of the better known families of language. But it is clear that its lines must be retracted for all the different cultural strata of mankind. What strikes the savage in one way would probably strike the more civilised man in quite another fashion. It requires a really intimate acquaintance with the primitive mind to be able to produce its processes with any approach to certainty.\n\nIn many cases the etymologies suggested by Professor Schmidt are nothing more or less than highly ingenious guesses. Thus, for example, he sees in the Malay dukut, \u201cgrass,\u201d (which does not occur in Wilkinson\u2019s Dictionary and is perhaps a Javanese loanword) a root meaning \u201cgreen,\u201d for which however the only authority given is the Stieng k\u016bt, \u201cgreen.\u201d Malay akar, \u201croot,\u201d etc., is similarly traced to the Bahnar kor, \u201cto go down to the ground.\u201d Malay pandan, \u201cpandanus,\u201d is connected with the idea of sweetness: I believe the juice of its fruit gives a drinkable liquor, but is it particularly sweet? Malay lindak, \u201cporcupine\u201d, again, is explained as the animal which \u201crolls itself up;\u201d one knows that hedgehogs roll themselves into a ball when attacked, but I am not enough of a naturalist to be sure that porcupines do the like, though it\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 53, 1909.\nseem probable. The connexion between the ideas of \"spreading out\" (Malay hampar) and \"flying\" (Mon-Khmer par) seems to me highly conjectural; nor can it be said to be much assisted by the Mon gapaw-a, \"to go around.\"\n\nIn one or two instances we find an unfortunate diversity of opinion among our authorities in Malay-Ploynesian etymology. Thus according to Dr. Brandstetter the Malay word t\u00ealinga, \"ear,\" contains a root ling, identical with ding, which in its variant form d\u00eang also occurs in Malay d\u00eangar, and which he interprets as meaning \"to hear.\" Professor Schmidt on the other hand takes the word t\u00ealinga, to be derived from a root ling (found in t\u00ealiling, etc.) meaning \"to turn,\" \"to return,\" \"round,\" and connects the word with the shape of the external human ear, not with the function of the internal part of the organ. Who can say which is right? True, Professor Schmidt gives a similar etymology for the Malay kuping, which also means \"ear,\" but there is no more certainty in this derivation than in the other. In fact there is less: for the parallels quoted mean not \"to wind,\" as he would have it, but \"to bind,\" \"to plait\" and \"to weave.\" It seems to me that we want something more than mere conjecture to bridge the gap between these conceptions and the idea of the human (or animal?) ear. Again in the word rambut, \"hair,\" Professor Schmidt finds a root but, \"to roll,\" \"to twist,\" \"to fall.\" This does not seem very apposite, but he gets over the difficulty by explaining that rambut, means \"that which is matted.\" The majority of modern Indonesians have lank hair which does not form itself into a mat or mop even when allowed to grow to its natural length. If the explanation is correct, we have here a very valuable piece of prehistoric anthropological information, namely that part of the ancestry of the very mixed modern Indonesian from which he derives the essentials of his language did not have lank but wavy or possibly even curly hair. Unfortunately Dr. Brandstetter quite independently and without any reference to the above suggested etymology points out that the words for \"hair\" in the Indonesian languages display four variants of one root, viz. buk, but, bul, and the simpler form bu. That these are all in some way connected\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwith one another is as good as certain: there are too many similar cases in these languages to admit of our attributing such resemblances to mere accidental coincidence. But how they are connected is a problem that still awaits a solution and until that question is satisfactorily answered Professor Schmidt's derivation is at any rate premature: it is no use accounting for but and leaving its three poor relations out in the cold.\n\nThere are one or two other minor points, not essential to the main argument of the paper, on which I feel compelled to differ from the author. While agreeing with him that B\u00e9sisi has a closer relation to the Mon-Khmer languages than S\u00e9n\u00f3i or T\u00e9mbe' have, I cannot admit that the same proposition holds good of the Jakun dialects. Whatever may be their origin, it seems to me that the Jakun dialects are very remote from the Mon-Khmer family. Further I think his suggestion that S\u00e9n\u00f3i represents a mixture between S\u00e9mang and B\u00e9sisi is quite unarguable: what these three have in common is the element allied to Mon-Khmer and this is very often more archaic in S\u00e9n\u00f3i than in the other two groups. Again I think that his view that the words jung, \"foot,\" s\u00e9lak, \"leaf,\" and dak, \"water\" are Aryan loanwords imported into the Further Indian languages (including the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula) at a remote date when the linguistic ancestry of the tribes that use them were in contact with Aryan races, is an arbitrary assumption. It is based on a resemblance with certain Sanskrit words, which resemblance may after all be purely fortuitous in these three cases. One of the arguments by which Professor Schmidt supports his contention is that these words do not appear in S\u00e9mang. As a matter of fact there is conclusive evidence that the word for \"leaf\" does occur in the S\u00e9mang dialects. But anyhow it seems highly improbable that the native terms for such ordinary everyday objects as \"foot,\" \"leaf,\" and \"water\" should in such a very large number of allied languages have been replaced by Aryan equivalents.\n\nIn another part of his paper Professor Schmidt seeks to show that the great linguistic synthesis which he propounds\nand in support of which he has brought forward such weighty arguments is balanced by a fundamental unity of race among the peoples that speak these various allied languages. I venture to think that this view must be received with much caution. Whether or not there is a thin strain of common blood running through these very diverse races is a point that does not and cannot affect the classification of their languages. Personally I rather regret that the attempt has been made to establish even a qualified racial unity such as this amongst populations which differ physically amongst themselves as much as chalk does from cheese. Not only is it in my judgment premature insomuch as the data available are quite inadequate to support the conclusion, but it is liable to do harm by casting doubt on the validity of the purely linguistic inferences, where the evidence is far more perfect. Everyone remembers the absurd inferences which were formerly drawn from the existence of the Indo-European family of languages: how we were gravely told that the same blood courses in the veins of the Bengali and the Icelander, and so forth, merely because their languages are ultimately derived from a common source. There is a similar danger in the present case. We must not let linguistic relationships blind us to anthropological differences. It is important to remember that such differences are deep-seated and that the new family of languages recognised by Professor Schmidt (assuming its existence as proved) under the name of the \"Austric\" family is spoken by races as different from one another as those which speak the Indo-European languages. Some are Mongoloid in physical type, others approximate more towards the Caucasian form (which of course by no means implies any real relationship with the Caucasian race, commonly so called); some are practically indistinguishable from Dravidians in physique, others again are Negritos of a fairly pure kind, and many are Oriental Negroes indistinguishable from their cousins who speak the quite alien Papuan languages. Professor Schmidt is far too intimately acquainted with the intricacies of his subject to be unaware of these differences and the difficulties to which some of them give rise. What I complain of is that he has not\ndrawn attention to the existence of these complicated problems with sufficient distinctness, so as to warn those who do not know as much about the matter as he does himself. He is inclined, in support of his unifying scheme, to glide quietly over the difficulties that still remain unexplained.\n\nI cannot here go into the other points raised in this interesting and valuable paper, but must refer anyone who wants more information to the original itself or to the French translation which has recently appeared in the Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extr\u00eame Orient, Tome VII., Nos. 3 & 4, under the title \"Les peuples Mon-Khm\u00e9r, trait d'union entre les peuples de l'Asie centrale et de l'Austron\u00e9sie.\" Whether its conclusions be accepted in their entirety or not, there can be no doubt that it is an epochmaking and most important contribution to philological science.\nFruit of Burbidgea.\n\nThe dispersal of seed in the order Scitamineae seems to be nearly always affected by the aid of animals. Thus in the Catimbium section of Alpinia we find the globose capsule often of a bright orange color. It partly dehisces and discloses the small hard aromatic seed, enclosed in a sweet white aril, popular with many animals and birds. In the smaller Alpinias of the Hellenia section, the whole fruit is pulpy, red or black, a berry in fact attractive to birds.\n\nIn the epiphytic and also in some at least of the terrestrial Hedychiums, the capsule which is of a bright orange color dehisces and the valves spreading disclose the seed wrapped in a brilliant read pulpy aril. The Amomums and other Scitamineae with radical inflorescence, have usually dull colored, green or brownish fruit, borne on the short peduncles close to the ground occasionally the fruit is brilliantly colored red, and ornamented with processes of various forms, and these appear to be chiefly dispersed by rats or other small terrestrial mammals. Phaeomeria (Nicolaia) has its fruits borne in a close set head on the top of the stout peduncle usually about two feet tall. In most species the fruit are dull green or brown, though in N. venusta they are bright red and conspicuous, but in all cases squirrels or rats seem to be the dispersers of the seed, gnawing the pericarp and scattering the seed to some distance.\n\nIn Burbidgea we have an entirely different system, the seeds being adapted for wind dispersal, and it is the only case of such modification known to me in the order.\n\nBurbidgea is a genus peculiar to Borneo, apparently always terrestrial, with stems of about 2 feet or less in height, which bear a raceme of red flowers resembling those of a Hedychium. The capsules are cylindric, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long and $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch through, pubescent, at first green then becoming brown, the pericarp thin and papery. When ripe the\ncapsule splits for its whole length along one side. The placenta remains attached by both ends and from it are suspended the very small light seeds attached by a funicle 1mm long. The seeds are 3mm long and 1mm in diameter, cylindric with a short sharp terminal mucro, they are brown and smooth. From the base of each rises a thin papery white aril irregularly cut into laciniae, some of which are nearly as long as the seed. The seeds hang downwards from the placenta waving with every puff of wind, and seem to be easily blown to a distance. They are very light and float on water. The aril is very thin and inconspicuous so that it is hardly likely to be attractive to any animal, and from the curious way in which the seeds are suspended, their lightness and the ease with which they are detached and blown away, there seems no doubt that the whole fruit has been modified from that of an ordinary animal-dispersal form, for dispersal by wind.\n\nThere are two species of Burbidgea known, viz B. nitida and B. schizocheila. It is from a plant of the latter which I received from Mr. J. Hewitt and cultivated in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, that I make these observations. I have however also a wild spray of fruits sent by the same collector.\n\nH. N.

It was considered probable that many would be glad to join if they knew the advantages to be obtained from membership.\nThree volumes of the Journal, viz: 51, 52 and 53, were published during the year and another will shortly be issued. The number of contributors has much increased and many valuable and interesting papers are being obtained by the Society.\n\nAn Index (Vol. 51) to the fifty volumes already published drawn up by Mr. Barnes has been printed and distributed to members.\n\nAs there were a very large number of copies of the previously published volumes in stock, it was decided to offer them to members at a reduced rate.\n\nA new edition of the Map of the Malay Peninsula was completed and the sheets were sent home to Messrs. Stanford for printing and it is hoped it may be ready for distribution early this year.\n\nThe Library was arranged by the Librarian and a catalogue of its contents prepared for the press and rules for the use of the library were drawn up.\n\nA considerable number of journals and pamphlets were received from other institutions in exchange and were incorporated with the Library.\n\nThe Treasurer's account is appended.\n## HONORARY TREASURER'S ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR 1909.\n\n| Description | Amount |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Balance brought forward from 1908:\u2014 | |\n| Mercantile Bank, Deposit | $2700 |\n| Chartered Bank, Deposit | $2300 |\n| Mercantile Bank, Current Account | $183.05 |\n| Chartered Bank, Current Account | $12.36 |\n| Cash in Hand | $5200.41 |\n\n| Payments in 1909:\u2014 | |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Methodist Publishing House, Journal | $50 |\n| Catalogue, Printing of C.

Ridley, F.R.S., F.L.S.\n\nIn going over the herbarium at the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, I find a good many plants not recorded in the Materials of the Flora of the Malay Peninsula, some overlooked, others collected since the publication of the earlier numbers. I have therefore put together notes and descriptions of these plants so that they may be on record. A few orchids too received from Sarawak from Mr. Hewitt and others are also described.\n\nSince Sir George King described the Dipterocarpeae several new ones were described by Sir D. Brandis, and I have given notes on these, rather fuller than in other cases as these trees are of considerable importance to foresters, on account of the value of their timbers. Curiously among the Dipterocarps omitted from the Materials by Dr. King is the well-known Camphor tree, *Dryobalanops camphora* of which I hope to give a full account when I have got certain further information about it.\n\nDILLENIACEAE.\n\nWormia.\n\nThe shrubs and trees of the genus *Wormia* are among the most striking of our local plants, the brilliant colouring of the large yellow, more rarely white flowers, being most conspicuous. The genus is closely allied to the equally showy one *Dillenia*, but is I think very distinct. King in the Materials for a flora of the Malay Peninsula distinguishes the two genera correctly by the absence of an aril in the *Dillenias* and the presence of an aril in the *Wormias*. Martelli in Malesia has mixed the two genera together under the name\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nDillenia, and has by no means made this group of plants easier to understand. The real difficulties of separating the two genera lies only in the difficulty of working from badly preserved herbarium specimens. The plants undoubtedly do not, unless very carefully preserved, dry well, but in life there is little difficulty in distinguishing the two genera. The great characteristic lies in the fruit. In Wormia after the petals have fallen, the sepals close over the pistil and when the fruit is ripe the carpels expand, becoming of a beautiful rose pink or white. They split along the edge and display the small black seeds clad in a scarlet aril. These pink stars of carpels, two inches or more across in the common species W. subsessilis are nearly as attractive as flowers.\n\nIn Dillenia the sepals once closed over the pistil do not expand any more. They become fleshy and sweet or acid, the carpels enclosed inside do not open, and as they do not ever dehisce, the seeds do not possess a coloured aril, which would be useless in seed dispersal.\n\nWormia seed is dispersed by birds which attracted by the brightly coloured aril swallow the seeds. The carpels split in the very early morning, and though I have constantly looked for seed at say 8 or 9 o'clock, it is usually already gone, so early do the birds find it. The chief disperser of W. subsessilis in Singapore is the common bulbul Pycnonotus analis who is very keen on the scarlet arils.\n\nDillenia on the other hand is dispersed by Mammals, or the rolling away of the fruit or its floating away on the river, on the banks of which some species grow. The fruit is green or yellow pulpy and sweet. As it never opens arils are useless, so it possesses none. This character however is not always easy to make out in dried specimens as is evinced by Sir George King's having transferred Dillenia meliosmoefolia correctly referred by Hooker to Dillenia to the genus Wormia.\n\nThe Wormias have been separated into sections according to whether the stamens are all equally long or the inner row is longer than the outer one. This is a good distinction but there is a very good separating point in the petiole. In a certain set, all shrubby and inhabiting swamps, the petioles\nare strongly winged for the whole length. This broad green wing encloses tightly the bud and protects it from injury from rain, till it is sufficiently strongly developed to separate the wings and appear. There are several species ranging from the Malay Peninsula to Australia, which have this curious arrangement. The others mostly trees have simple unwinged petioles.\n\nOf the wing-stalked species we have two in the Peninsula, viz. *W. suffruticosa*, Griff. and *W. subsessilis*, Miq., to which group may be added, *W. Burbidgei* of Borneo, *W. alata* of Australia, and probably *W. Beccariana*, (Borneo), *W. auriculata*, (New Guinea) and some others.\n\nOf our two species in the Flora of British India Vol. I, p. 35, and also in King's Materials Vol. I, p. 8, *W. suffruticosa* is made synonymous with *W. subsessilis*, Miq. Martelli follows this and adds localities from Borneo (Kuching Sarawak) and suggests that *W. Burbidgei* of Borneo is probably the same thing. The first two species however are quite distinct from each other, always keeping so far as I have seen their characteristics true and not mixing.\n\n*W. Burbidgei*, Hooker is a rather puzzling plant. It is based on a plant brought by Burbidge from Borneo and figured in the Botanical Magazine t. 6531. It has smaller and paler flowers than most species. No one seems to have met with it again, and the figure in the Botanical Magazine suggests that it is a deteriorated plant of one of this group, affected by its cultivation in the houses at Kew Gardens.\n\nRound Kuching however lie big swamps in which among other splendid flowers, grows a plant like a glorified *W. suffruticosa*. Like *W. subsessilis* it forms tall and dense thickets layering itself by its branches in the water, but it is taller and is especially conspicuous from the great size of its flowers considerably bigger than those of *W. suffruticosa*, its very large leaves more strongly dentate, and its white not pink fruit. This is probably the plant referred to by Martelli as *W. suffruticosa*. It might be classed as a variety of *W. suffruticosa var. borneensis*.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nAs there has been so much confusion in our two Peninsular species, I give complete description of them.\n\n*Wormia subsessilis*, Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. Suppl. I. 618. Ann. Mus. Lugd. Bat. I. 315, t. 9.\n\nA very large shrub forming large thickets in damp open spots. Stem as much as 6 inches thick branching at the base. Branches decurved and rooting at the nodes, where they reach the ground. Shoots and leaves quite glabrous except for a few hairs along the midrib and bases of the nerves behind. Leaves ovate or oblong ovate obtuse, except for the midrib prolonged into a short mucro, margin distantly and very shortly serrate, nerves about 15 hairs straight and parallel, base broad, passing into the broadly winged petiole, which encloses entirely the bud, blade dark green above nerves lighter coriaceous 8-12 inches long 6-7 inches wide, petiole 1\u00bd inch long. Raceme decurved, of 5-6 flowers. Bracts lanceolate claw-like pinkish \u00bd inch long. Flowers 5 inches across. Sepals ovate obtuse edges ciliate at the tip, 2 outer ones dull red not visibly nerved, nearly \u00be inch long, 3 inner a little smaller green with traces of red coloring. Petals 5 undulate hardly crenate bright yellow 2 inches long 1\u00bd inch wide. Stamens white \u00be inch long, the outer row of staminodes shorter yellow. Styles 7, greenish a little longer than the stamens. Carpels 7, rose pink, sutures and centre white, 1 inch long when fully expanded ovate tipped by the withered style. Seed subpyriform \u00bc inch long black with a red aril.\n\nCommon in the swampy open country of the South of the Peninsula.\n\nSingapore: Tanglin abundant; Pulau Tekong (Ridley 3966); Pulau Ubin. Johor: Pinerong Estate (Cantley); Kwala Sedili Besar (Feilding). Distrib. Banca.\n\nvar. *borneensis*, n. var. A very tall plant forming dense thickets and layering itself by its branches. Leaves very large 18 inches long and 12 inches across, margins strongly dentate, with thorn-like processes at the tips of the teeth,\nyoung parts of the plant branches, buds, petiole and midrib and veins densely silky hairy, adult leaves glabrous. Peduncles over a foot long silky hairy, flowers about 6 to 12. Sepals in flower hairy on the edge. Flowers 4 inches across or more petals bright yellow. Fruit when expanded white.\n\nBorneo, Sarawak: in swamps at Kuching abundant. *Wormia suffruticosa*, Griff. Notul. IV. 706. Ic. IV. t. 6496.\n\nA more stunted plant straggling up to ten feet tall but commonly 4 to 6 feet, and not forming the dense large thickets of *W. subsessilis*. The leaves resemble those of the latter but the bases are broader and run less into the winged petiole, and the margin is distinctly dentate. When young they are covered with close set white woolly hairs on the midrib and nerves on the back, and this hair persists on the petiole. The hair however disappears to a large extent on the adult leaves. It covers too the young parts of the stem. The flower spikes are stouter than in *W. subsessilis* and the peduncles and branches are also woolly. The flowers much resemble those of the latter species but the sepals often are slightly hairy on the edge, and the petals more obovate and larger, yellow. The stamens white.\n\nThe plant is called \"Simpoh Gajah.\" It is rarer in the South of the Peninsula where *W. subsessilis* takes its place. In Singapore it occurs in jungle swamp at Stagmount along the railway, and Jurong. In Johore, I have seen it at Sedenah. In Malacca abundant at Bukit Bruang (Holmberg 713). In Negri Sembilan Cantley's collector sent it from Seremban, and Goodenough collected it (No. 10470) at Rawang.\n\nI have no evidence that it occurs outside the Peninsula.\n\n*W. tomentella*, Mart. Malesia, III. 159. A tree, about 40 feet tall and 2 to 3 feet through with light brown bark. Branches pubescent. Leaves elliptic obtuse at both ends, entire or shortly cuspidate 6-10 inches long, 5 inches wide, above glabrous, nerves 13 pairs, transverse nerves\nconspicuous beneath, hairy especially on the nerves, petiole 1-2 inches long pubescent deeply channelled not winged. Racemes from the upper axils about 6 inches long pubescent, pedicels 1 inch long pubescent. Sepals oblong obtuse dull red glabrous 1 inch long. Petals spatulate broad, apex rounded 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch wide, light yellow. Stamens yellow, in two unequal series inner ones longer reddish, pores 2. Pistils 7, glabrous red, styles long, subulate. Capsule white.\n\nSingapore: Garden Jungle, Selitar (Ridl. 6382), Bukit Timah (Ridley 6809); Johore: Tebrau Road; Borneo: Kuching (Haviland).\n\nThis is no doubt identical with the Borneo plant on which Martelli based his species. It is by no means a floriferous tree like *W. oblonga*, usually only producing a few flowers at irregular intervals through the year. It is omitted from the Materials.\n\n*W. parviflora*, n. sp.\n\nA small tree, branches pubescent. Leaves broadly lanceolate or ovate lanceolate membranous, base somewhat narrowed, apex acute, margin nearly entire or with a few obscure teeth glabrescent above except the midrib, beneath covered with rough hairs especially on the midrib and nerves, nerves about 18 pairs, reticulations prominent, 6-9 inches long, 2-4 inches wide, drying red, petiole slender not winged \\(\\frac{1}{2}-1\\) inch yellow pubescent. Flowers few small on short \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch peduncles, pedicels slender 1 inch long. Bracts linear all densely yellow hairy. Sepals obovate rounded densely yellow hairy \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long. Petals obovate thin little longer, margins crisped. Stamens unequal inner series longer than the outer one glabrous.\n\nMalacca: Merlimau (Derry 1077), Ayer Panas (Curtis 3489).\n\nI have not met with this plant myself and have no note of its colour. It is known as \"Simpoh Bukit.\"\n\n*Wormia albillos*, n. sp.\n\nLarge shrub, very pubescent. Leaves elliptic oblong narrowed towards the base, which is rounded, apex cus-\n\nJour.

Inflorescence from the upper axils panicled, peduncle 3 inches long with two spreading branches of the same length, all softly pubescent. Bracts ovate acute \u00bc inch long pubescent. Buds globose very shortly pedicelled. Calyx lobes 5 obovate obtuse rounded pubescent on the back \u00bd inch long \u2153 inch wide. Petals thin obovate rounded, glabrous white \u00bd inch long. Stamens numerous glabrous all about equal. Pistils silky hairy. Fruit unknown.\n\nJohore: in wet woods at Tebing Tinggi (Ridley 11053).\n\nA very pretty small-flowered white species. The fruit unknown.\n\nDillenia.\n\nD. Scortechinii, King Mss. Wormia Scortechinii, King Materials l. c. p. 366.\n\nThere is I think no doubt but that this plant is a Dillenia as King at first suggested and not a Wormia. The fruit resembles that of D. meliosmaefolia, but is green and not yellow. The plant is by no means rare in the South of the Peninsula and is quite conspicuous in the woods from its possessing large stilt-roots in which the whole tree appears to be supported. So striking is this that visitors on seeing the tree in the Garden Jungle have enquired if it was a mangrove tree. The whole tree is about 60 feet tall with a smooth reddish bark.\n\nIt occurs in the Garden Jungle of Singapore.\n\nDillenia meliosmaefolia, Hook. fil. Wormia meliosmaefolia, King.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nI have carefully examined this plant which is in cultivation in the Botanic Gardens Singapore and cannot find any aril to the seeds, nor does the fruit ever dehisc as those of a *Wormia* do. It is obvious that Sir Joseph Hooker was right in referring this tree to the genus *Dillenia*. It is a fairly tall but not stout tree occurring in the hill forests. In cultivation in the Botanic Gardens in open ground it became more bushy and is flowering at a height of about 12 feet. The leaves are soft and bright green glabrous above and pubescent beneath. The flowers appeared in September. The sepals are in two whorls three outer ones and two inner ones somewhat gibbous and more silky. The petals 5, are narrow oblong obtuse narrowed at the base and lemon yellow 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long and half an inch wide. The outer two or three rows of the stamens are shorter than the inner rows and yellow with an apiculate connective, the innermost row is white longer and appressed to the carpels. These are ten in number white linear and recurved. Each cell contains 6 non-arillate seeds. The sepals in fruit, are swollen yellow pulpy and acid, the carpels sweet and juicy and the whole fruit is eaten by the Sakais and Jakuns. Indeed it is quite refreshing on a hot thirsty day, though the sepals are decidedly acid. The whole fruit is about an inch through. The tree is known as \"Simpoh Bukit\" \"Simpoh hutan\" and \"Simpoh jantan.\"\n\nIt occurs in thick forests in Malacca: Ayer Keroh, Ayer Panas (Goodenough 1983), Selandon (Cantley); Negri Sembilan: on Gunong Angsi (Ridley), Selangor at Kwala Lumpur (Curtis 234), Bukit Hitam (Kelsall); The Dindings at Lumut, and Bukit Tungul (Ridley); Perak at Chenderiang (King's Coll. 5787), Tapah (Ridley).\n\n*Tetracera.*\n\n*T. sylvestris*, n. sp.\n\nA tall woody climber in forests ascending to about 60 feet, with grey bark. Leaves at the ends\nof the branches oblong cuspidate with a rounded base, thinly coriaceous not scabrid, nerves eight pairs, dark green shining above, margin obscurely crenate at the tip, 3 to 6 inches long, 1\u00bd to 3 inches wide, petiole \u00bc inch long, hairy. Panicles short and few branched, bearing a few flowers, pubescent. Bracts very small lanceolate. Pedicels \u00bc inch long pubescent. Buds globose. Sepals 4 obovate rounded, light green \u00bc inch long, margins pubescent, and inner face thickly covered with appressed silky hairs. Petals small white spatulate \u215d inch long, \u2153 inch wide. Stamens shorter, very numerous white, filaments flexuous. Carpels 4 pale green, styles rather stout tapering, stigma capitate. Follicles polished \u00bd inch long longer in proportion to their breadth than in *T. assa*.\n\nSingapore: Garden Jungle (Ridley 6179), Changi; Malacca: Merlimau; Selangor: near the Batu Caves (Ridley 8249); Perak: Tapa (Wray 1266).\n\nThis plant has been it appears confused with the common *Tetracera assa* D. C., from which however it is very distinct. *T. assa* is a sarmentose shrub, often forming bushes in open country, or climbing in hedges but at no great height, the leaves are much smaller than in *sylvestris*; the flowers larger; the sepals glabrous within are often tinted with red at the top; the stamens more numerous, longer and conspicuously tipped with rose pink. Carpels usually 2.\n\n*T. sylvestris* is a high climber in forests, with larger leaves, of a lighter green and not denticulate as in *T. assa*. The flowers are smaller and the sepals lined inside with silky hairs, the stamens shorter fewer and white slightly yellowish at the tip. The carpels are 4 in number. The young leaves are of a beautiful light reddish pink.\n\nThere are a number of species of *Tetracera* more or less described by Miquel and Blume from the Malay islands, Sumatra, Java, etc., but so incompletely in many cases that it is not possible to identify what is meant, and this may be one of them.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nTetracera fagifolia, Bl. Bijdr. 4.\n\nThis species has not been recorded in the Materials, as a native of our region. It occurs in the Garden Jungle and at Selitar in Singapore (No. 6381 and 6381a of my collections) and is too a native of Java. It is easily recognized by its lanceolate leathery leaves, stiff and polished about 3-5 inches long and 2 inches wide quite glabrous with 8 pairs of prominent ribs. The panicle of flowers is lax, about 6 inches long silky hairy. The sepals silky hairy on the edge and in the middle on the inner side. The flowers resemble those of *T. euryandra*, Vahl.\n\nIt does not seem to be very common or more probably seldom flowers as is so often the case with the *Tetraceras*.\n\nMagnoliaceae.\n\n*Talauma elegans*, Miq. Ann. Mus. Lugd. Bat. IV. 70. *Aromadendron elegans*, Bl. Bijdr. 8.\n\nThis fine tree is not recorded for the Malay Peninsula in the Materials. It is a straight tall tree 60 to 80 feet tall, with coriaceous finely reticulated dark green leaves 3 or 4 inches long and 1 to 1\u00bd inches wide elliptic and shortly acuminate, the petiole \u00bd to \u00bc inch long. The flowers of the usual magnolia type are a little over two inches long, the petals narrow linear acuminate, white and fragrant. The sepals lanceolate and glabrous. The stamens very slender and hardly half as long as the petals. The fruit is about 3 inches long obovoid narrowed to the base and smooth green with light pink seeds.\n\nIt grows in the Garden Jungle near the Fernery (No. 4429, and 5592 of my collection) and I have it also from Machap on the Selandor road, Malacca collected by Derry (No. 511), Curtis obtained it too on Government Hill, Penang (No. 3012). Derry gives the name \"Kayu Arang\" possibly by some error as this is usually applied to Ebony, and Curtis \"Chempaka hutan.\"\nANONACEAE.\n\nPolyalthia Curtisi, n. sp.\n\nTree 30 to 40 feet tall, branches dark-colored.

The female flowers however have never been described, and I am quite unable to understand what is meant by the descriptions of the male flowers in either account, as they do not coincide at all with the flowers as I see them. The descriptions however were made from dried and perhaps indifferent specimens. I therefore describe the plant afresh from life adding a description of the female flowers from a dried specimen. The plant is a woody climber usually about three inches thick with a milky latex. The leaves are coriaceous dark green ovate oblong obtuse or usually shortly acuminate. The male flowers are in simple racemes tufted from the stem far below the leaves. The flowers are pale green and $\\frac{3}{16}$ inch across, the pedicel and a small ovate bract at the base are red hairy. The sepals are 3 or 4, very small ovate acute covered with short red hairs. (I suppose these are the \"3 bracts\" mentioned in the other descriptions). The petals are in two series. The six outer ones are linear oblong obtuse, the edges minutely white hairy. They are rather unequal in size and the four sepals are opposite to the four largest. These petals are spreading. The inner series are shorter oblong with incurved edges white and glabrous, 6 in number and connivent. The stamens 6, have thick fleshy filaments swollen at the base then narrowed, dilated again and ending in a thick incurved rather beak-like process. The anther cells are widely separated on the outer edges of the thickened upper portion of the filament. I cannot see any trace of a pistil at all.\n\nThe female flowers are borne on a long pendulous panicle 18 inches or more long, bearing long distant racemes 8 inches or more long, pubescent, with flowers\nremote, singly or in twos or threes, on hairy pedicels \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long, the bracts small ovate and hairy. Sepals 2 lanceolate hairy very small. Outer petals linear oblong obtuse pubescent. Inner petals 6 shorter oblong incurved glabrous. Stamens 6 as in male. Drupe green with white spots elliptic flat.\n\n*Nephroica elegans*, n. sp.\n\nA slender twining plant growing among grasses, stem hairy, laticiferous. Leaves deltoid to lanceolate acute or elliptic lanceolate, base rounded, trinerved reticulations distinct sprinkled with hairs, midrib hairy on both sides, 2 inches or less long \\( \\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2} \\) wide, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) inch long hairy. Racemes axillary \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long hairy. Sepals very small ovate obtuse 5. Petals outer rotundate ovate acute 3. Inner petals ligulate oblong with two long linear points, 6. Stamens as long 6, with fairly stout filaments and globose anther cells transversely dehiscing.\n\nTringanu: Cherating river in grass on the shore, Aug. 25, 1889 (Ridley); Dindings: Lumut (Ridley).\n\nThe Dindings plant has larger and more elliptic leaves than those of the Cherating plant, some of the latter being very narrowed. The genus is referred to *Cocculus* by the authors of the Flora of British India, but it seems to me a very distinct one, as Miers has arranged it.\n\n*Stephania rotunda*, Lour.\n\nSlender climber stem glabrous. Leaves thin ovate petiole glabrous above beneath scurfy on the nerves, nerves 6 elevated above (when dry) \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) long, \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) inch wide reticulations conspicuous, petiole slender scurfy \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long.

Sepals linear oblong narrowed at base obtuse 3. Petals ovate rounded larger 2. Inner petals 3 lanceolate oblique. Stamens connate in a round disc, stalked, anthers below the disc.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.*\nLankawi: Kwah (Curtis), also occurs at Bangtaphan, Siam (Dr. Keith).\n\nThis has not previously been recorded for the Peninsula, but I think I am correct in referring the Lankawi plant to Loureiro's species.\n\nPOLYGALACEAE.\n\n*Polygala cardiocarpa*, Kurz. Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Beng. 1872, p. 291.\n\nSlender herb branched above glabrous 6 or more inches tall.

Selangor: Gua Batu (Ridley 8243); Lankawi: small islands (Curtis 3686), Pulau Sirih (Curtis 2581); Siam: Kasum (Curtis 3256).\n\nI have little doubt that this little herb is the plant described by Kurz under the above name, though his description is rather short. The original plant came from Tenasserim, and this is another instance of this Tenasserim limestone flora descending as far south as the Kwala Lumpur Caves. On the top of the limestone rocks of this spot I met with this little milkwort.\n\nHYPERICINEAE.\n\n*Hypericum japonicum*, Thunb. Fl. Jap. 295 t. 31. Hook. fil. Fl. Brit. Ind.

It is one of the comparatively few species in this region which possess petals and have lax racemes of distant flowers.\n\nGarcinia.\n\nThe Garcinias are often difficult to make out from dried specimens as they do not preserve well and further being unisexual one is apt only to get hold of plants of one sex. Three species of the small fruited ones commonly known as Kandis by the Malays, have thus been confused in the Materials. Indeed under G. nigrolineata, Plouch. King suggests that his description may cover two species. I have been able to study these plants from living specimens in the forests, and find that what he classes as G. nigrolineata covers three species, viz., the true G. nigrolineata of Pierre, a species apparently undescribed for which I propose the name Garcinia globulosa, and the Garcinia parvifolia, Miquel.\n\nGarcinia nigrolineata, Pierre Fl. Cochin-Chinensis VI. p. xxix, t. 81, fig. 1 F.\n\nTree 30 to 40 feet tall, branchlets above subangled. Leaves coriaceous lanceolate acuminate, glabrous, narrow-\ned to the base, 3 to 6 inches long 1-2 inches wide, nerves fine ascending numerous petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Male flowers in umbels of 4 to 10, pedicels \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long, flowers \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long, on the tips of branches. Sepals orbicular fleshy concave 4. Petals longer lanceolate oblong subobtuse. Stamens about 20, forming a compact mass. Filaments very short, anther cells 4 broad with a thick connective, no pistil. Female flowers in umbels of four on the termination of branches, larger than the males, pedicels short thick \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long. Sepals orbicular concave rounded. Petals oblong lanceolate acute, longer. Ovary ovoid, stigma large papillose convex. Staminodes about 8, resembling the stamens. Fruit fleshy an inch through oblong, globose, crowned with the thick apiculus bearing the pustular stigma.\n\nSingapore: Changi (Ridley 5005, 3611, 1967, 4644), Sungei Morai (4643), Tanjong Sukopek (3992); Johor: Gunong Pulai (Ridley); Pahang: near Pekan (Ridley); Malacca: Nyalas (Derry), Bukit Bruang (Ridley 4645); Penang Waterfall; Stone Quarry (Curtis 2412); Dindings: Pangkor (Ridley 7969); Lankawi: Kwah (Curtis); Carimon Islands (Ridley 7111).\n\n\"Kandis Jantan.\" This is a very distinct plant from the common Kandis, and is doubtless the plant referred to by King as the specimens with lanceolate acuminate leaves (p. 165). The typical leaves of this plant are narrow stiff and finely veined but it has also in some specimens which I cannot separate distinctly ovate leaves much broader. I find however narrow leaves as well on all or nearly all the broad leaved specimens. The Lankawi plant has the foliage of the narrow leaved form, but as the flowers, male, are very much larger it may be a distinct variety. This plant is undoubtedly Pierre's G. nigrolineata and I think also Anderson's plant in the Fl. Brit. Ind. though I have not seen the type. King's nigrolineata may be this partly but nearly all the specimens distributed under this name by him belong to a very distinct plant.\n\nR. A.

It often fruits heavily and one can get quite a basket of it from one tree. I once attempted to cook it to see if it would do for a pie, but found it not a success.

The leaves are large rather stiff 6 inches long or more, quite smooth above, beneath the nerves are much raised, and it is dotted all over with little woolly warts from which on the midrib spring single rather stiff hairs. The flowers are white in clusters on short branches of a loose panicle about 6 inches long, are themselves \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, with a silky calyx and oblong petals very silky outside and glabrous within. It has 50 stamens with nearly circular anthers. The fruit is ovoid hardly half an inch long the wings are bright red quite glabrous, linear \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inches long and half an inch wide, (the inner ones 2 inches long and only half as wide), hardly dilated at all for their whole length, finely marked with longitudinal ribs and transverse bars. This fine tree grows in the Garden Jungle (No. 6393) and I met with it too at Perhentian Tinggi (No. 10053). It fruits abundantly and comes up readily.\n\n**Anisoptera.**\n\nOnly one species of *Anisoptera* is recorded in the Materials. There are however three kinds known here *A. Curtisi*,\nKing, easily distinguished by its narrow leaves bright yellow beneath.\n\n*A. costata*, Korth. Verh. Nat. Gesch. Bot. 67, t. 6. A gigantic tree with large buttresses and rather pale colored bark. Leaves oblong coriaceous with a broad base blunt, glabrous above with close yellowish brown tomentum beneath, nerves numerous close set about 25 pairs, and reticulations distinct beneath, 4-6 inches long and 3 inches wide, petiole 1\u00bd very rough. Panicles axillary and terminal 6 inches long covered with scurfy wool in tufts. Flowers \u00bc inch long yellow. Sepals lanceolate acuminate densely pubescent. Petals glabrous lanceolate acuminate mucronate. Fruit globular 1 inch through, tomentose, wings two very large 7 inches long 1\u00bd inch wide slightly narrowed at the base and dilated a little upwards rounded at the tip, with three strong nerves running the whole length and numerous transverse bars the other three wings about 3 inches long very narrow with only 2 main nerves. The whole fruit is light brown. Some magnificent trees of this fine plant grow in the Garden Jungle (Distrib. No. 6684) and in Dalvey ground. The leaves in sunlight have a striking coppery yellow appearance specially conspicuous when wind blows. I have it also from Batu Tiga in Malacca collected by Holmberg under the name of Mersawar Ular. It was originally described from South East Borneo. I believe it is the chief source of the timber commonly known as Mersawar which is in quality like a rather inferior Meranti.\n\n*A. glabra*, Kurz.

It seems to be rare here as I have only seen it from Sungei Morai in Singapore (4630 and 3619a of my collections) and it is not recorded in King's Materials. It has stiff lanceolate leaves quite smooth and polished above and covered with a soft short grey tomentum of minute stellate hairs, the nerves are almost invisible without a lens. The flowers are very numerous in short panicles all covered thickly with stellate woolly hairs about $\\frac{1}{5}$ inch long. The fruit which I have not seen is described as tomentose globular the two large wings free to the base 2 inches long, blunt, the other three linear lanceolate acute and only $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long. It is also a native of Sarawak.\n\n*Hopea globosa*, Brandis l.c. 61. This is based on a plant collected by Wray, at Thaiping, Perak. The only type specimen I have seen is a poor one but I have collected fruiting specimens of a tree rather small for this genus at Chua Chu Kang, in Singapore (No. 6585) and have also received it from Rantau Panjang, in Selangor under the name of Chengal Paya. The leaves are ovate acuminate 4 inches long, rather coriaceous with the nerves prominent on the back. The fruit in Wray's specimen seems young\u2014it is pubescent and does not show the true wing veins. In the others, adult, there are 7 distinct nerves and the wings are glabrous.

This plant is as regards the Singapore plant at least, (the type) a tree frequenting forests, with larger umbels of smaller pure white flowers.\n\n**Euthemis minor**, Jack Mal. Misc.\n\nThis was described by Jack from specimens found in Singapore with the common *E. leucocarpa* Jack, but though I have met with it in Pulau Batam and King records it from Bangka, it appeared to have become extinct in Singapore, I was therefore very pleased when on visiting the banks of the river at Chua Chu Kang to find a quantity of this pretty plant growing with *E. leucocarpa* in the sandy woods above the river. King's description of it is very poor. He merely mentions that its leaves are obscurely veined, a difference which is hardly noticeable in the living plant, and that the leaves are nearly entire, and the berries red. These he gives as distinguishing points, but the berries of *E. leucocarpa* are as often red as white, varying from white to rose and rose to deep red. Jack's description is fuller and gives the points of this plant well. It is smaller and more prostrate than *E. leucocarpa* with dark brown bark. The leaves are more distant and much smaller 3 to 4 inches long 1\u00bd wide or even smaller narrowly lanceolate dark green above and paler beneath, the petiole is winged to the base as in *leucocarpa* but much less distinctly so. The surface of the leaves is quite smooth and though the thickened edge is serrate the minute thorns which arm the teeth are very inconspicuous and often not developed at all. The panicle is very distinct. It is much longer than the leaves, nearly 6 inches long and quite lax, hardly branched, the flowers being mostly in pairs, with green\nlanceolate persistent bracts \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. The flowers, open one in each pair at a time, after which the pedicel elongates somewhat so that the young fruit of one pair is well developed before, the second flower is open. The sepals are ovate ciliate, \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long, green, becoming pink as the fruit ripens and fallen before the fruit is ripe. The whole flower is smaller than that of *E. leucocarpa*. The petals are linear oblong white, and the stamens much resemble those of that species. The ovary is brighter green and conic but angled, while that of *leucocarpa* is nearly white and quite smooth and rounded. The fruit is quite different. It is strongly five angled, and this is most conspicuous before it is ripe and when still green, but when fully ripe the angles are still visible and the top of the fruit nearly flat and very dark red, not at all resembling the globose round topped fruit of *E. leucocarpa*. The plant grew in some abundance in one spot in a sandy wood, where *E. leucocarpa* (some plants of which attained a height of over six feet) was plentiful, and *Dipteris Horsfieldii* formed a large thicket. It was probably more abundant in Singapore at one time as it is not probable that Jack reached this part of the island which must in his time have been quite inaccessible. There is no evidence of its occurrence in Penang as mentioned by Hooker in the Flora of British India.\n\n**SAPINDACEAE.**\n\n*Capura pulchella*, n. sp.\n\nShrub little branched about 6 feet tall.

It will be noticed in the description I have given above that the midrib can hardly be called \"acutangled,\" even at the tip, below it is distinctly rounded and often grooved. I believe I have seen it very commonly all over the low country of the Peninsula, but it very rarely is met with in flower and I have never seen fruit.\n\nSemecarpus glomerulatus, n. sp.\n\nBark grey. Leaves obovate apex rounded base narrowed to the petiole, margin undulate, coriaceous glabrous above, beneath nerves and reticulations covered with short red hairs, nerves about 10 pairs, meeting in arches at the margin reticulations numerous and prominent visible on both surfaces but most elevated beneath 4-8 inches long 2\u00bd-5 wide petiole pubescent \u00bc-\u00bd inch long thick. Panicle 8-12 inches long with numerous spreading branches 4 to 6 inches long, rachis closely valvety pubescent. Flowers in distant glomeruli very numerous \u00bd inch across. Pedicels very short pubescent. Calyx shallow with 5 very short lobes, pubescent. Petals 5 glabrous ovate lanceolate subobtuse valvate. Stamens 5 filaments slender about as long as the petals glabrous. Disc broad flat fleshy hairy in the centre.\n\nLankawi: Pulau Nior Stali (Curtis 3681).\nMeliosma elegans, n. sp.\n\nA small tree 20 to 30 feet tall branches black when dry. Leaves unequally pinnate 6-8 inches long leaflets opposite 3-5 pairs, lanceolate acuminate base cuneate 2 inches long 1 inch wide glabrous except for a few fugacious reddish hairs on the petiolule and midrib, petiolule \u00bc inch long. Panicle lax a foot long, with distant long slender branches 6 inches long or less branchlets 1-2 inches. Flowers subsessile small pink fragrant. Rachis everywhere covered with scattered red hairs. Calyx lobes narrow lanceolate obtuse 4 or occasionally 5 margins ciliate. Petals glabrous 5 outer ones orbicular, inner ones narrow oblong hooded. Stamens 3 glabrous, hooded with a bilobed rounded cup surrounding the anther. Pistil conic pubescent narrowing to a slender style. Fruit small pisiform with a low keel running on one side \u00bc inch through.\n\nSelangor: above the Gap, Gunong Semangkok 3-4000 feet alt. (Curtis 3754).\n\nI cannot match this elegant plant with any described species.\n\nMeliosma monophylla, n. sp.\n\nLeaves simple elliptic acuminate with a rather long blunt point, narrowed to the base, thin in texture glabrous shinning, the nerves slender 7 pairs usually visible above meeting in arches near the margin, length 6 to 8 inches, width 3 to 3\u00bd inches; petiole slender thickened at the base 1\u00bd to 2 inches long. Panicles axillary or terminal 2 to 3 inches long with a slender peduncle about an inch long glabrous, branches few except in the terminal one, and short. Flowers \u00bc inch long shortly pedicelled. Sepals 5 suborbicular, unequal, margins ciliate. Petals 5, three orbicular glabrous, 2 smaller irregular. Stamens 2 fertile. Anthers decurved with a rather wide connective 3 irregular sterile, lobed, adnate at the base to the petals. Ovary conic glabrous.\nPerak: Hermitage Hill (Ridley) a single specimen collected in 1892.\n\nVery distinct from any species known to me is its thin textured simple leaves and general glabrous habit, the flowers too are fewer and larger than usual.\n\nMELASTOMACEAE.\n\n*Anericleistus pauciflorus*, n. sp.\n\nMuch branched shrub about 6 feet tall, stems terete. Leaves elliptic ovate acuminate winged on the petiole glabrous above and beneath except a few hairs on the midrib, 7 inches long 3 inches wide, 5 nerved, with straight parallel transverse conspicuous nerves, petiole 1 inch long, winged in the upper part covered with rough pale hairs as are the young parts. Flowers 2 or 3 in a small raceme terminal on a very short peduncle. Bract hairy ovate acuminate obtuse \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long. Calyx lobes fleshy linear, hairy \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) inch long. Petals ovate acute bright rose pink margins minutely ciliate. Stamens 8 equal and similar filament flat linear narrowed at tip glabrous pink. Anthers longer hardly sagittate base of cells rounded, acuminate upwards opening by terminal pores, glabrous with a pair of short processes or warts rising from the base of an oblong thickened connective. Style thick cylindric. Capsule \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long thickly roughly hairy splitting above into 8 linear lobes.\n\nSelangor: Klang Gates almost out of flower, Aug. 1908.\n\nA much bigger plant than *A. macranthus*, King, with hairy calyx tube and with the capsule valves splitting into 8 linear lobes. From *A. hirsutus*, Korthals, it differs in the very short inflorescence the large bract and the dehiscence, and larger more glabrous leaves.\n\n*Ochthocharis ovalifolia*, n. sp.\n\nA shrublet branched with pale bark young parts covered with dark red curly hairs. Leaves opposite ovate acute or acuminate base rounded, margin crenulate with\nshort thorn-like processes, nerves 5 from the base, transverse bars conspicuous beneath above glabrous except on the midrib at the base, beneath pale, the nerves and reticulations covered with curly red wool, $1\\frac{1}{2}-2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long $1\\frac{1}{4}$ inch wide, petiole red woolly $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long or less. Panicle short terminal, with few short branches and few flowers, red woolly at the nodes. Bracts oblong $\\frac{1}{10}$ inch long, glandular hairy. Calyx $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long, campanulate with short lanceolate triangular lobes, edged with gland tipped hairs. Corolla. Petals 5 lanceolate acuminate ending in a short hair-like mucro. Stamens 8 all similar filaments moderately stout, anthers as long linear oblong obtuse, with a solitary glandular boss at the base on the back. Ovary glabrous, style stout nearly as long as the petals, stigma capitate. Fruit capsular, subglobose, sepals ciliate, top hardly elevate nearly flat, dehiscence apparently irregular, $\\frac{1}{6}$ inch long. Seeds numerous fawn colour cuneate truncate at the top, raphe thickened conspicuous.\n\nJohore: in dense swampy woods at Sedenah Aug. 1908 (Ridley).\n\nThe normal number of stamens in this genus are 10 but I could only find 8 in the flower I examined. The plant was almost out of flower, at the time, and the flower might not be normal. The small usually ovate leaves closely toothed, small panicle, and rufous hairs on the young parts distinguish it from other species.\n\nBEGONIACEAE.\n\n*Begonia paupercula*, King.\n\nI have not seen the type of this species nor is there any record further than Perak as to where the original plant was obtained, but there is a small species of *Begonia* abundant at the Kwala Lumpur caves, which I think may be intended by this description. The plant however described from dried specimens only differs somewhat from King's description and thus I describe the Kwala Lumpur\nplant from the living plants brought from the caves, where it grows abundantly. A small succulent herb with a creeping not swollen rhizome, four to 6 inches tall; the stem pinkish, completely glabrous except for a few glandular hairs on the edges of young leaves, and some scattered processes, (trichomes) on the upper surface. Leaves ovate acuminate blunt cordate at the base unequally bilobed, nerves 5 to 7; 4 inches long \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) to 3 inches wide, polished light green, or in some plants darker with white spots, petiole 2 to 3 inches long pinkish. Peduncle 3 inches long, with a side branch and small leaf about halfway. Cyme terminal small, and few flowered. Bracts lanceolate white with red veins. Male flowers. Sepals orbicular ovate obtuse, retuse or entire white with red nerves, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Petals 2 smaller, spatulate white retuse. Staminal column globose. Anthers subglobose not apiculate. Female flower \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch across. Sepals and petals 6 or 7 very unequal, 4 obovate white lined with red, the others narrower subspathulate white. Styles 2 separate from near the base yellow. Fruit with three unequal wings, two short one long oblong subtriangular blunt half an inch long.\n\nOn Limestone rocks Caves near Kwala Lumpur.\n\nIt will be noticed that King's *B. paupercula* differs in description in the absence of petals in the male, and apiculate stamens, and the larger number of perianth lobes in the female.\n\n*Begonia clivalis*, n. sp.\n\nSmall succulent herb, with a short rhizome 4 to 8 inches tall. Stems red pubescent hairy, once or twice branched above. Leaves orbicular ovate to ovate cordate, lobes nearly equal, tip rounded thin textured, margin undulate with few short teeth, above and beneath covered with stellate hairs, main nerves 7, spreading from the leaf base 1-3 inches long, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to 3 inches wide. Petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) -2 inches long, densely stellate hairy. Inflorescences 3, lax few flowered 2-4 inches long pubescent. Bracts lanceolate \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long.

Petals 2 narrower and shorter obtuse linear oblong. Stamens in a globose head rather few. Anthers sub-globose not apiculate. Female flowers sepals 2 oblong red. Petals nearly as large 2 white. Styles 3 separate nearly to base. Stigmas curved capitate. Fruit capsule red three winged, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch across, 2 wings short triangular, one longer triangular obtuse.\n\nSelangor: Klang Gates on sandy banks, Aug. 1908 (No. 13523); Pahang track (Ridley 8591).\n\nA pretty dwarf begonia with bright red stems and nerves of leaf, allied to \\(B.\\) Forbesii, King. The Pahang track plant is rather stouter and less hairy, but I think is the same.\n\nRUBIACEAE.\n\n*Xanthophytum rupestre*, n. sp.\n\nA little shrub about 6-8 inches tall branched stems slender light brown densely covered with long silky appressed, and somewhat felted hairs pale brown. Leaves obovate to ovate acuminate acute at both ends, subcoriaceous glabrous dull green above densely white felted beneath, nerves ten pairs prominent beneath, reticulations beneath conspicuous, 1-2 inches long \\(\\frac{3}{4}-1\\) inch wide petiole very short \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch long. Stipules as long as the petiole ovate acuminate. Inflorescences axillary, panicled of two branches, scorpioids. Flowers 10 in a panicle, all woolly. Pedicels very short peduncle none. Calyx lobes 5, triangular acute deep green. Corolla \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long white woolly hairy, tube narrow at base then abruptly dilated, lobes 5 short ovate mucronate, tube hairy both within and without. Stamens 5 included, adnate to the tube, with very short filaments. Anthers oblong yellow, with a short muco at the tip. Style included, rather stout. Stigma oblong large, stigmatic surface yellow, capitate transversely grooved. All glabrous, disc annular black. Fruit \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) inch long cylindric-turbinate felted\n2 celled, with numerous angular seeds on an axile placentia. Seeds reticulate dotted brown angular.\n\nLoc, Selangor at Klang Gates, a quartzite dyke alt. 600 feet, flowering August 15, 1908 (Ridley No. 13414).\n\nThe genus *Xanthophytum* is based on a plant discovered in Java by Reinwardt and is allied, if indeed it can be considered distinct to *Lerchea* also a Javanese plant. There are two or three species of the genus recorded, one or two from Java, one from Borneo and one from the Society islands. I have seen none of these species, but this plant is evidently (from description) allied to *X. fruticulosum*, Miq. of Java. Its most important difference lies in the position of the stamens, which are not adnate to the base of the corolla, but in the mouth of the corolla. In this it most resembles *Lerchea*. But the whole habit of the plant is different from that genus and more resembles that of *Xanthophytum*.\n\nThe locality in which I found this curious little plant is of some interest. It consists of a large dyke of quartzite attaining a height of over 1000 feet above sea level. This altitude the short time at my disposal did not permit me to ascend, and the plant was actually gathered on a lower part of the ridge at about 600 feet above sea level. The ridge is of no great width at this point, and is precipitous on both sides. The soil is somewhat peaty and scanty, the rocks projecting bare in many parts. In the crevices of the rock the plant was growing. The whole ridge is very dry, and was exceptionally so at my visit as rain had not fallen for more than a week. Many of the trees and shrubs were out of flower, but the *Xanthophytum* was in good bloom. The lower part of the upper ridge was covered with bracken, *Pteris aquilina*. Above where the soil was more scanty was abundance of the grass *Eriachne Chinensis* very characteristic of dry spots. I saw no other grass there. *Boeckia frutescens* in flower, as a low shrub, was abundant. This is common at high altitudes in dry spots all over the Peninsula, usual-\nly at 3000 feet and upwards, and is stated to be a sea shore plant in Tringanu and near Sandakan. *Rhodoleia championi* was in fruit. This is also a mountain plant, which I have never seen at a lower altitude than 3000 feet. *Cibotium Barometz* and *Oleandra neriiformis* grew under the shade of this and other trees; the latter being also a characteristic fern of our higher hills at 3000 feet altitude. There were a number of other trees of stunted growth on the ridge, none of which were in flower or fruit, but they had all the facies of the trees and shrubs of such hills as Mt. Ophir, and Kedah Peak at 4000 feet elevation. The most conspicuous and abundant plant however was *Pogonanthera pulverulenta*, a common plant occurring as an epiphyte in the low country, in mangrove swamps, and on lofty trees in the forests and often establishing itself when fallen from a tree, on the ground in dry exposed spots and also met with on rocks and trees in the higher hills.\n\nThe flora of this ridge may therefore be considered truly xerophytic, and totally different from the flora of the Batu Caves limestone district at no great distance and from the forests of the Kwala Lumpur environs.\n\n*Chasalia pubescens*, n. sps.\n\nA bush about 5 feet tall much branched, stems soft glabrous when adult, lower internodes about 4 inches long. Leaves herbaceous lanceolate acuminate caudate narrowed to the base, primary nerves about 8 pairs looping within the margins, above glabrous beneath paler, sprinkled all over with pubescence, the keel, nerves, and petiole densely pubescent, 6-7 inches long, 2-2\u00bd inch wide, petiole \u00bc-\u00bd inch long. Stipules \u2153 inch long ovate obtuse pubescent. Cyme compound dense, short 1 inch long, pubescent, pale rosy white. Flowers small sessile in small heads. Calyx short cup-shaped \u215b inch long with 5 short teeth; pubescent. Corolla \u2153 inch long, pubescent except at the base tubular curved, lobes fleshy short, linear hooded obtuse, hairy outside glabrous within. Stamens 5 glabrous, anthers linear not cordate rather\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nlarge, filaments short. Style slender bifid nearly to the base, ovary glabrous cylindric oblong depressed at the top, a little taller than the calyx lobes.\n\nJohore: in woods at Sedenah, hardly out in Aug. 1908. The flowers are white the buds tinted at the tip with lilac.\n\nThis species is very distinct from *C. curviflora* in its pubescence and congested flower heads.\n\n**ORCHIDEAE.**\n\n*Microstylis nemoralis*, n. sp.\n\nStem fleshy purple cylindric creeping ascending, 6 inches long. Leaves ovate acuminate, 4 to 9 red, base rounded, five nerved, 3 to 4 inches long, 2 inches wide. Raceme 5 inches tall, base nude, rachis angled, with a few 2 or 3 linear, narrow bracts \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Flowers \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch across, fairly numerous, close together. Sepals elliptic broad rounded at the tip, strongly reticulate nerved when dry, lower ones broader than the upper ones. Petals linear obtuse narrow, all red. Lip orange-yellow, broad with broad rounded auricles, limb obovate rounded almost quadrate, apex broadest with two rounded angle-lobes, and 5 acute teeth between. Column small pale.\n\nJohore: at Sedenah in wet mud between tree-roots, in a dense wet forest, August 1908.\n\nA very distinct and pretty plant, with the elongate stem of *M. micrantha* but with much larger leaves and flowers. Among Scortechini\u2019s drawings is a pencil sketch of a *Microstylis* which I think is intended for this plant. It is labelled *M. plantaginea* by Sir Joseph Hooker, but is not what I take to be the plant he so named in the Flora of British India of which there is another drawing of Scortechini\u2019s so labelled.\n\n*Liparis Brookesii*, n. sp.\n\nRhizome short, pseudobulbs \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch through at the base, subcylindric but base dilated, covered with loose pale ovate sheaths acute ribbed with 8 to 10\n\nR.

Bracts linear acuminate narrow $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long. Pedicel slender half an inch long. Sepals linear oblong $\\frac{1}{4}$ by $\\frac{1}{16}$ inch long obtuse. Petals very narrow linear. Lip orbicular entire margins minutely crenulate, half an inch long and wide, callus at the base oblong obtuse indented and excavate in the front so as to appear double. Whole flower pea green with a darker spot at base of lip. Column graceful $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long with rather long low wings.\n\nBorneo: Sarawak on limestone rocks at Bidi (C. J. Brookes).\n\nThe nearest species to this plant is I think *Liparis tricallosa* Rehb. fil. of the Sulu Archipelago. It differs in its laxer spike coloring of the flowers and orbicular lip with the very different callus. The callus is rather difficult to describe. It has the appearance of being formed by two portions of nerves picked up into a short elevated part, with a depression in front where the veins had begun to bifurcate.\n\n*Dendrobium (\u00a7 Desmotrichum) crenicristatum*, n. sp.\n\nBranches fairly stout $\\frac{1}{10}$ inch through, internodes an inch long yellowish green, pseudobulbs linear oblong flattened grooved yellowish green 3 inches long, $\\frac{2}{3}$ inch wide, leaf lanceolate, 8 inches long $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch wide coriaceous.

Stelidia rather long linear curved, crest (margin of clinandrium) rather tall rounded crenulate, with 2 longer processes at the sides. Anther cap broad triangular flat yellow, beak short upcurved. Rostellum tooth-like. Stigma large orbicular.\n\nA living plant in flower of this was brought me in June 1909 by Mr. Lewis who obtained it from Mt. Poe in Sarawak, Borneo. What appears to be identical was obtained by Mr. Hewitt on Santubong Mountain, and by Dr. Haviland in the same place. In Mr. Hewitt's plants the raceme has fully developed to a length of over a foot long and closely flexuous. He describes the sepals as light red brown. Column similar but deeper. Petals and lip pale yellow. I am not sure that the saccate portion at the base of the lip does not rather belong to the lip than to the column foot it is difficult to see where the column-base ends and the lip begins.\n\nThis plant would doubtless have been referred by Pfitzer to his genus Chelonostele but it seems almost impossible to break up the genus Caelogyne in the way he has done with any satisfaction. His genera run into each other with so many connecting links.\n\n*Saccolabium fimbriatum*, n. sp.\n\nStem moderately stout over three inches long.

A. Soc., No. 54. 1909.\nA Letter of Instructions from the East Indian Company to its Agent, circ. 1614.\n\nWith Notes by W. G. MAXWELL.\n\nAmong the Cottonian manuscripts in the British Museum is a letter of instructions from the East India Company to its principal agent in the East India.\n\nThe manuscript consists of nineteen pages and is registered as \"Cottonian Manuscript, Otho E. VIII. ff. 231-240 (ink foliation).\" There is no date to the letter, but Mr. W. Noel Sainsbury the editor of the \"Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, East Indies, China and Japan 1513-1616\" assigns to it, with a query, the date 1614. In this case the addressee would be John Jourdain, who was in that year the East India Company's principal agent in the East and who resided at Bantam, some sixty miles north of the present city of Batavia.\n\nIt will be noticed that in the manuscript there is a reference to the date 1620 as the date of Raja Api's death. This, if correct, would of course make the date suggested by Mr. Sainsbury impossible. I think however that there can be no doubt that 1620 is a slip of the pen for 1610. In one of the notes which I have appended to this article, I show that the account of Raja Api is identical with that given by Peter Williamson Floris, who gives the date as 1610. Floris was one of the merchants of the company's seventh voyage in 1611, and the writer of this letter [which gives such \"descriptions and intelligences as he has been able to gather from the advises given by the company's factors\"] almost certainly had Floris' letter before him.\n\nThis manuscript was partially destroyed by fire in 1731, some three lines being consumed at the head of each leaf. The recurring omissions in the transcript mark the places.\n\nJour, Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nThe thanks of the Society are due to Mr. G. F. Warner, Keeper of Manuscripts, for permission to take a copy of this letter which is now for the first time published.\n\nI have prepared some brief notes of the places, people and things specified in the letter. These are given in alphabetical order in an appendix.\n\nThis manuscript appears to me to be interesting in two respects; firstly not so much on account of its contents as for its purport to contain all that was then known in England of this part of the world. Indeed when one sees that the letter was written in 1614, more than a century after the Portuguese had been in occupation of Goa and Malacca, it seems astounding that the Directors of the East India Company (which had been founded some fourteen years before the date of this letter) should have so little information to give their principal agent in the East. The reason that there is no reference to Goa, Malacca or any other Portuguese possession is, of course, that the British could not trade there.\n\nThe document is interesting in a second respect as showing how small a place in the early aims of the Honourable East India Company, India itself occupied. In later years the Company so much confined itself to India that one is apt to think of India and the Company as co-extensive.\n\nBut India at one time stood for nearly everything outside Europe, Africa, and Asia Minor. Thus Marco Polo wrote (A.D. 1298), \"India the greater is that which extends from Maabar to Kesmacoran (i.e. from Coromandel to Mekran) and it contains thirteen great Kingdoms. India the Lesser extends from the province of Champa to Mutfili (i.e. from Cochin-China to the Kistna Delta). Abash (Abyssinia) is a very great province and you must know that it constitutes the Middle India.\"\n\nTo this day each country calls by the name of India that part of this vast area that it has acquired for itself: thus India to us means British India, to the French it means Pondicherry, to the Portuguese it means Goa, and to the Dutch it means the magnificent possession of Netherlands-India. The West Indies were so called because Columbus imagined that he had discovered a new route to the \"Indias\" by sailing West instead of\nEast; and the word \"Indian,\" of which \"Red Indian\" is the best known form, has been applied (so it is said) by discoverers to almost every tribe from the Esquimaux to the Patagonians.\n\nOf course one knows, but perhaps hardly realizes, that when the East India Company started operations it did not own a foot of land in India. It was really the task of making India British that withdrew the operations of the East India Company from the vast area of the East India, with which it first set out to trade, to the comparatively restricted area of British India.\n\n[British Museum.

It is the finest city in Gujerat, and is situated about fifty miles North of the head of the Gulf of Cambay (See Cambaia).\n\nAmboine\u2014Amboyna. (The native name is Ambun). It was first a Portuguese possession: the Dutch took it from the Portuguese in 1605. The British founded a trading station there soon afterwards, and thenceforward there arose, between the British and the Dutch, continuous disputes, bickerings, quarrels and fights, which culminated in the \"massacre\" of 1623, in which the British Settlement was killed by the Dutch.\n\nFor this massacre, which is celebrated in Dryden's Tragedy of Amboyna, Cromwell obtained compensation from the Dutch in 1654. The British held the island from 1796 to 1802. It became Dutch again in 1814.\n\nAndragiri\u2014Indragiri. (Sanscrit, \"the Hill of Indra\"). A Malay State of the East Coast of Sumatra, North of Jambi and South of Kampar.

The latter route is the nearer; the former is the safer, and is the only one followed by all steamships of the present day.\n\nBantam at the western end of Java, not far from the present city of Batavia, was therefore a central place for the principal factor of the East India Company. The China trade came down to him on the one monsoon, and the Indian trade on the other: each was handed transhipped and despatched, westward and eastward, on the succeeding monsoon.\n\nBarocha\u2014Broach\u2014A port in the Gulf of Cambay between Cambay Town and Surat.

The Gulf of Cambay is an inlet of sea lying between the peninsula of Kathiawar and the Indian Coast line. The Portuguese Settlement of Diu lies at its mouth in the Kathiwar Peninsula, and Surat is at its mouth of the Bombay side. The town of Cambay is at the head of the Gulf. It is mentioned by Marco Polo, under the name of Cambaet, as a place\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nof great trade. A tidal bore is causing the gulf to silt up, and trade has now left the place.\n\nThe Kings of Guzerat formerly had their residence at Cambay. The most famous of these Kings undoubtedly was Sultan Mahmud Bizarha, of whom there are lurid accounts in Purchas and Ludovic's de Varthema.

See the article \"Cathay\" in Yule and Burnell.\n\n_Chulia_\u2014A name applied to Muhammadans from the Madras Presidency. The origin of the word is obscure, and its application vague. It is not certain whether it is applied to all Muhammadans of Madras, or whether it applied to the Malabaris, or whether it applied to any particular class of Muhammadans. In old accounts of the Colony the name was frequently used, generally in connection with the word \"Kling.\" The term is no longer used, but a Chulia Street still exists in Penang.\n\n_Comboja Gum_\u2014Gamboge. See the article in Crawfurd.\n\n_Corromandell_\u2014The Coromandel coast was a term applied in old histories and official correspondence to the east coast\nof the Madras Presidency. It was applied in no very definite sense, and now has fallen into disuse. In this account it extends from Negapatam to Orissa and includes the Kingdom of Narsinga, which extends from Negapatam to Montepoli, and the Kingdom of Taligana, which extends thence to Orissa. It will be noticed that the writer of this account gives an etymology of the name, deriving it from Chulia mandel. The true derivation is from Chora, the Tamil form of the ancient title of the Tamil Kings who reigned in Tanjore. There is a very interesting account of Coromandel, with a list of the various fanciful etymologies that have been attempted by different writers, in Yule and Burnell.\n\nThe Coromandel Coast corresponds in extent (more or less) with the Maabar of Marco Polo.\n\nCotobaxa: Cotlobaxa.\u2014Kutab Shah. Kutab Shahi was the name of a branch of the Bahmani dynasty, which established itself at Golconda. Kutab-al-Mulk, tarefdar of Telingana, founded the dynasty and assumed royal title in 1512. The dynasty lasted until 1687 when Golconda was taken by Aurangzib.\n\nDabul (Dabhol)\u2014A famous port of the South Konkan between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries. It lies in the modern district of Ratnagiri about two degrees north of Goa.\n\nBarbosa (A.D.1516) writes of it:\n\nThe Dabul has a very good harbour, where always congregate many Moorish ships from various parts and especially from Mekkah, Aden and Ormuz with horses and from Cambay, Diu and the Malabar country.\n\nDecan\u2014Deccan (or Dakhin) (The Deccan). The name is a corruption of the Sanskrit word dakshina, southern. It is a term generally applied to the high lands of India bounded on the North by the Narbada, on the East by the Eastern Ghats, on the South by the Kistna and on the West by the Western Ghats. The name Maharashtra, or the country where the Marathi language is\nspoken, is applied to the same area. The term Konkan (of which the origin has not been satisfactorily explained) is applied to the narrow tract of land on the West Coast between the Deccan and the Sea. It includes Bombay, Ratnagiri and Goa.\n\nDoa\u2014perhaps a mistake for Goa or Diu.\n\nDroughzangu\u2014I cannot identify the place.\n\nGingam\u2014See the article \"Gingham\" in Yule and Burnell.

She sailed from \"the Downs\" on the 5th February 1611, and after a prosperous voyage arrived at Ceylon in August of the same year. Thence she sailed to Pulikat, Pettipoli, Bantam, Patani (which she reached in June 1612) and Siam\u2014For full details of the voyage of the Globe see the calendar of State Papers and Anderson passim.\n\nGouri\u2014I cannot locate this place.\n\nGrand Mogor\u2014See Mogor.\n\nJacatra\u2014The name by which the town of Jayakarta was known to Europeans.

A place named hang-siangh is mentioned by Mandelses, and is identified by Anderson with huang-praban.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nMadurie\u2014The Madura District lying the east Coast of Madras south of the Native State of Pudukottai, and east of the Western Ghauts.\n\nMananeabo\u2014Menangkabau, an inland district of the southern part of Sumatra.\n\nManar\u2014On the North West Coast of Ceylon. The island of Manar is the beginning of Adam\u2019s Bridge, which runs hence to the Indian Coast.\n\nMartaban.\u2014On the right bank of the Salween almost immediately opposite Moulmein. The capital of the Peguan Kingdom was at one time here. In the many wars between the Peguans, Burmese and Siamese, it was several times besieged and taken. Towards the end of the 16th century it was taken by Siam. Later it became independent again for a time, but afterwards was the seat of a governor appointed by the King, Burmese or Peguan, who happened to be in power at the time.\n\nMesulpatam : Mesulptam : Musilpatam.\u2014Masulipatam. Now headquarters of the Kistna District, Madras. A port which developed a great trade, principally with the ports on the opposite side of the Indian Ocean, in the seventeenth century. The East India Company first traded there, in the \u201cGlobe\u201d in A.D. 1611. In 1628 the English were driven out by the Dutch. They returned in 1632 having obtained a farman from the Sultan of Golconda. The town is described in 1670 as being \u201cfamous along the coast of Corromandel\u201d and as \u201cresembling Babel in the variety of tongues and the differences of garbs and costumes.\u201d Its manufactures of carpets, chintzes and coloured cloths have been crushed out of the market by European piece goods and its trade has been diverted elsewhere by railways.\n\nMogor\u2014The Grand Mogor is the Portuguese form of the title of the Kings of Delhi of the house of Timur (o grao Mogor). The common English form is the \u201cgreat Mogul.\u201d See articles \u201cMogul\u201d and \u201cMogul, the Great\u201d in Yule and Burnell.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nMontepoli\u2014I cannot locate this place.\n\nMulley\u2014A variation of \"Malay.\" It is not unlike Marco Polo's \"Maliurh,\" and is interesting because of its resemblance to the word \"moly\" (sometimes \"moley\" or \"meley\") which survives in luncheon menus, and which simply means a kind of watery curry prepared by an Indian cook in what he considers to be the Malay fashion.\n\nNaicque (Naik)\u2014This word (which is derived from the Sanskrit nayaka, a leader,) is used in several ways in India, its most common application being in the Indian Army to a rank corresponding to that of Corporal.\n\nAmong the Telugus, it is the name of a caste, and the general name of the Kings of Vijayanagara A.D. 1325-1674 and of the Lors of Madura (A.D. 1559-1741). See the article \"Naik\" in Yule and Burnell.\n\nNarzinga\u2014This is the name applied by the Portuguese, and later by the Dutch and British, to the Great Southern Indian Kingdom of Vijayanagara, or Bismagar. The name is not really that of the country (and for this reason it will not be found in any Gazetteer), but is that of Nara Sinha, a prince of Telugu origin (circa 1400-1508) who was reigning when the Portuguese first visited the place. The country bore this name among the Europeans for nearly two centuries after his death. Vijayanagara was the name of the capital that gave its name to the kingdom. It either means the City of Victory, or is a corruption of Vidya Nagara (the City of Learning). \"The Pagan King of Narsinga, who has \"1,500 elephants of war, 49,000 horse, as much foot as \"he wishes and so much territory as can scarce be \"traversed in six months\" is mentioned in the famous letter written on the 6th June 1513 to the Pope, as the head of Christendom, by the King Emmanuel of Portugal to inform him of all the Portuguese successes under Albuquerque. (Letters and papers of Henry VIII, edited by J. S. Brewer. No. 4173 Calendar of State Papers Vol. I. No. 1,\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nNarsinga, Orixen, (Orissa) and Bengalen (Bengal) are mentioned in the report (written in 1660 by Foulke Grevil, Treasurer of the Navy, to Secretary Sir Robert Cecil) which led immediately to the establishment of the East India Company. (*Calendar of State papers Vol. I No. 266*).\n\nVijayanagara was overwhelmed in 1565 by a combination of Muhammadan Sultans of the Deccan in the battle of Talikota, in which the King, Rama Raja, himself was killed. The place is situated in the Bellary District and is entirely in ruins which extend over many square miles. The only part of it now occupied is a little village which bears the undistinguished name of Humpty.\n\n*Nisainxa Adelxa.*\u2014Nizam Shah Adil Shah. The Nizam is the hereditary style of the reigning prince of the Hyderabad Territories. The early Portuguese writers generally used the form Nizamulco, which represents Nixam-ul-mulk, or Nizamoxa, which represents Nizam Shah.\n\nAdil Shahi was the name of a Muhammadan dynasty which ruled at Bijapur from 1489 till 1672 or later. The Adil Shahis were almost continuously at war with Vijayanagar (Vide Narzinga), and they took part in the battle of Talikota in which Rama Raja, the King of Vijayanagara, was killed and his forces defeated.\n\nThe following extract from Garcia de Orta\u2019s *Colloquies* (printed in Goa in 1563) is worth quoting in this connection as it contains the variations Nizamulco and Idalcam (Adil Khan).\n\n\u201cThis King of Dely conquered the Decam and the Cuncam; and retained the dominion a while; but he could not rule territory at so great a distance, and so placed in it a nephew crowned as King. This King was a great favourer of foreign people such as Turks, Rumis, Coraconis, and Arabs, and he divided his kingdom into captaincies, bestowing upon Adelham (whom\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nwe call *Idalcam*) the coast from Anzediva to Cifardam ............and to *Nizamulco* the coast from Cifardam to Hegstana.\u201d\n\n**Ozira\u2014Orissa.** The ancient kingdom and modern district which lies between the Coromandel Coast and Bengal.\n\n**Pacci** \u2014Often written Pacem. A Malay State near the North East point of Sumatra.\n\nValentijn gives this account of it:\u2014\n\n\u201cClose to the East point of Sumatra is the once especially famous city Pasi (or Paem) which in old times, next to Magapahit (sic) and Malakka was one of the three greatest cities of the East\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026but now is only a poor open village with not more than 4 or 500 families, dwelling in poor bamboo cottages.\u201d\n\nSee also the article Pasei in Yule and Burnell.\n\n**Pagado** \u2014(Pagoda). A coin (both gold and silver) which was long current in South India. Accounts were kept in Madras in *pagodas*, *fanams* and *kas* down to A.D. 1818 in which year the rupee was made the standard coin.\n\n8 *kas* (cash)= one fanam.\n\n42 fanams = one pagoda.\n\nA pagoda worth $3\\frac{1}{2}$ rupees. For an interesting account of the derivation of this word see Yule and Burnell.\n\n**Paleacatta** \u2014Pulicat. A town 25 miles North of Madras City. It is the site of the earliest Settlement of the Dutch in India. They built a fort here in 1609, and the place was later the chief Dutch Settlement on the Coromandel Coast. It was at one time a centre of trade with Penang. It has given its name to the cloth known by the Malays as *plekat*.\n\n**Palimbam** \u2014Palembang. A district on the South East Coast of Sumatra. The Palembang river enters the sea in the Banka Straits.\n\n**Patania** \u2014Patani. On the East Coast of the Malay peninsula between Kelantan and Singora. The position of Patani on the map explains its selection, in conjunction with Surat (east coast of India) Coromandel (west coast of\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIndia), and Bantam (in Java) as one of the four principal places where the chief agents of the East India Company should be resident. It has a good harbour, sheltered from the North East monsoon, which makes the East Coast of the Malay peninsula dangerous in the North East monsoon, and it was hoped that it would be a centre for trade with Siam, with China and Japan, and with Borneo.\n\nThese hopes came to little however, and various exactions imposed by the Queen of Patani and the Orang Kayas soon drove trade away.\n\nFor a most interesting account of Patani see the Calendar of the State Papers and Anderson passim.\n\nPedir\u2014On the East Coast of Acheen between Acheen Head and Diamond Point.\n\nPersian\u2014Parsee.

This conqueror, called by the Portuguese the Black King of Siam, died in 1605, and left his kingdom to his brother, whom they designated as the white King. He was a\n\"prince who only desired to reign in peace. He died\n\"in 1610 leaving several children. Thence arose\n\"great troubles for the state for the king, on his death\n\"bed, caused his eldest son, a youth a great promise,\n\"to be put to death, the murder being committed at\n\"the suggestion of one of the nobles, who, being very\n\"rich and powerful, aspired to the throne.

A town on the left bank of the Pegu\nriver about three miles from its mouth. Towards the\nend of the sixteenth century the King of Arakan took\nadvantage of the quarrels between the Kings of Toung-\nNgoo, Ava and Pegu and, with the assistance of Philip-\npo de Brito y Nicote (to whom a reference is made in\nthis manuscript) conquered Pegu. As a reward for\ntheir services he gave the Portuguese the town of\nSyriam which they fortified. He soon had reason to\nregret his liberality for the Portuguese were mere\npirates and committed the most appalling cruelties upon\nthe wretched natives. A few years later the King of\nArrakan formed an alliance with the King of Toung-\nNgoo, and tried to drive out the Portuguese: they\nattacked the town, but were repulsed. In 1613 (the year\nbefore the probable date of this manuscript) the King of\nAva besieged and took Syriam, impaled de Brito alive\nand sent all the surviving Portuguese to Ava as slaves.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe Dutch established a factory at Syriam in 1631; The English were some years later. Both were expelled about the year 1670. The English factory was re-established in 1698 by the Government of Madras. In 1740 the Peguans drove out the Burmese, but left the British alone. In 1743 the Burmese retook the town. They held it only three days, when the Peguans recaptured it, and, suspecting the British Agent of duplicity, burnt his factory and expelled him. The town went through many vicissitudes in the wars between the Peguans and the Burmese in the eighteenth centuries. See article Syriam in Yule and Burnell.\n\n*Solor*\u2014Sulu.

In the early part of the seventeenth century, the East India Company had great hopes of it. Its principal reports were wax and diamonds. One account indeed (Calendar of State Papers, Vol. I. No. 522) says that \"the best diamonds in the world\" were to be procured there. It was once the seat of a Javanese Settlement, and the name, given probably by the Javanese, means, in Sanskrit, \"the parrot's gift.\"\n\n*Surat*\u2014This was a great port at the mouth of the Gulf of Cambay (See Cambaia). When the merchandise of the East was carried to Europe through the Red Sea and thence overland, it was one of the most important trading places in India. With the discovery of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, its importance diminished: and now, with silting-up of the gulf, trade has deserted it.\n\nThe following account of it in the Storia do Mogor (Vol. I p. 61) is interesting from its mention of the trade of this part of our part of the world.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\n\"It is the largest port in India and the best river.

Brooks and John Hewitt.\n\nIn the tropical forests of Sarawak, orchids are relatively very abundant and a great number of species are there found. A fair proportion have large showy flowers or a conspicuous inflorescence but the majority are small flowered and are not conspicuous. As is well known the peculiar structure of the typical orchid flower is a special adaptation to effect cross fertilisation through the agency of insects but in reality many orchid flowers are rarely visited by insects. The well known orchid Phalaenopsis grandiflora produces a spike of large and conspicuous white flowers but though Sarawak is so rich in insect life an insect visitor is never seen on the flowers: and the spike remains in bloom for months until eventually the flowers die without producing a single seed pod. If a single flower be self-fertilised by human agency the whole spike fades in a few days and a seed pod is formed.\n\nIn the swampy parts of Sarawak Bromheadia palustris is very common: it produces conspicuous white flowers at fairly regular intervals of three or four weeks but though these have been under continuous observation for a long time we have never seen a large insect on the flower. Still it may perhaps be visited occasionally as sometimes a seed pod is formed, Vanda hookeriana has fine large flowers, the petals spotted with a rich velvet lake and it is always to be found in flower. These flowers if they are not fertilised may remain in good condition for a week: at the end of that time, or in case they lose their pollinia or are fertilised on the day after the visit of the insect, the petals become much bleached the colour disappearing almost entirely. This orchid not infrequently bears seed pods and I am told by the Malay gardeners that\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nthe large carpenter bees (Xylocopa latipes) sometimes visit the flowers: this is very probably correct for something certainly removes the pollinia occasionally, but nevertheless it cannot be a very common occurrence as I have watched a plant for hours without seeing any insect visitor. On the other hand in the vicinity of this orchid certain trees (a Iacaranda and a Vitex) which bear blue flowers are visited by countless swarms of carpenter bees. These bees every day pass by clumps of Arundina speciosa, Bromheadia palustus and Vanda hookeriana without paying the slightest attention to the orchid flowers. The orchids in question were all growing in cultivated areas and thus to some extent under unnatural conditions but the same facts are revealed when we seek the plant at home: for there too the vast majority of flowers never set a pod. Nevertheless this does not apply to the small flowered orchids: such flowers are generally fertilised and it is quite a usual experience to find a complete spike of seed pods. This is to be attributed probably to the ants which frequent most flowers large or small in numbers: in small flowers an ant is able to remove the pollinia but in large flowers this is not possible.\n\nIn Sarawak the best known orchid is the Dendrobium crumenatum popularly known as the 'pigeon orchid.' It produces conspicuous spikes of sweet smelling white flowers which endure for one day only and then fade away: the spikes appear at irregular intervals of about 50 days. This orchid produces only very few seed pods: nevertheless it is visited by swarms of bees which pass rapidly from flower to flower removing the pollinia from many or all of the flowers on the spike. The pollinia are to be found on the metathorax of the bee dorsally. These bees (Apis dorsata) appear early in the morning and by 7 a.m. they crowd round the clumps of pigeon orchid found on almost every tree: by 8.30 a.m. however only few bees are to be seen and at 10 a.m. an occasional straggler is the sole representative of the early morning swarms. By evening (5 p.m.) the flowers have entirely lost their fragrant odour but they are still open and now they receive the atten-\ntions of a wasp (Vespa dorylloides) but as there remain only very few pollinia this wasp cannot be considered an important agent in effecting the fertilisation of Dendrobium erumenatum. In the morning smaller bees (Nomia elegans, a eratina and several Trigonas) accompany the Apis but they do not remove the pollinia and in fact one of them, (the eratina), does not trouble to enter the flower but pierces the base of the perianth tube and thus reaches the sweet liquid nectar.\n\nIn the case of the pigeon orchid the number of seed pods produced is surprisingly small. An experiment was undertaken to test the possibility for self-fertilisation.\n\n1 'Self-fertilised' a number of flowers.\n2 Crossed 2 flowers on the same spike.\n3 Crossed 2 flowers from different lateral off shoots, arising from the same basal bulb.\n4 Crossed 2 flowers on shoots from different bulbs in the same clump.\n5 Crossed 2 flowers belonging to entirely different clumps.\n\nThe result was that only those belonging to class 5 set seeds shewing that for seed formation cross fertilisation in its limited sense is essential. This however is unusual amongst the orchids of Sarawak for most of them are capable of self-fertilisation. One of the most remarkable facts in the life-history of the pigeon orchid is the simultaneous flowering of all the plants in the same area. The flower spikes make their first appearance a week or so before the day of flowering, they all blossom on the same day, the next day they are faded and the series repeats itself at irregular intervals indefinitely: the point to note is that the intervals are of varying length of time and yet flowering is quite simultaneous throughout. This periodically corresponds with no known seasonal variation and until the flower spikes make their first appearance it is quite impossible to prophesy when the next pigeon orchid day will appear. Such are the main facts of the question but it is somewhat complicated by a more erratic flowering on the part of a few individuals. In the following\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\ntable we give the dates of the pigeon orchid days in Kuching (Sarawak) during 1907 and 1908. For these dates we are indebted to J. E. A. Lewis Esq., who had a large collection of living orchids under continuous observation.\n\n| Date   | Description                          |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|\n| Jan. 10. 07 | general (i.e. all the plants were in blossom) |\n| Feb. 4.    | general                              |\n| Feb. 26.   | general                              |\n| May 1.     | general                              |\n| June 12.   | fairly general                        |\n| July 28.   | general                              |\n| Aug. 23.   | sparse (i.e. only few in bloom)       |\n| Sept. 25.  | very sparse                           |\n| Oct. 19.   | fairly general                        |\n| Nov. 6.    | general                              |\n| Dec. 5.    | fairly general                        |\n| Jan. 26. 08| general                              |\n| Feb. 8.    | sparse                               |\n| Feb. 26.   | very sparse                           |\n| Feb. 29.   | very sparse (only one or 2 spikes seen) |\n| March 13.  | only 2 plants seen in flower          |\n| April 14.  | sparse                               |\n| April 26.  | general                              |\n| May 25.    | fairly general                        |\n| June 14.   | very sparse                           |\n| Aug. 3.    | general                              |\n| Aug. 15.   | very sparse                           |\n| Sept. 9.   | very sparse                           |\n\nIt will be seen that whilst some pigeon orchid days were characterised by a blossoming of all the plants in the area, on other days only a few plants were in flower; and although on the days marked very sparse we have several times noticed just a single flower spike standing alone yet on going to other parts of Kuching there too was found a sparse flowering. At first it seemed possible that in our neighbourhood there existed several series of pigeon orchids each series having its own period and in short that the orchids which blossomed on one sparse day would come into flower on another sparse day but would\nblossom on a full day. But such is not the case as we ascertained from several observations: for instance on Feb. 29.08 one solitary flowering spike found in a large clump of pigeon orchids was marked and on May 25 when the clump produced its numerous spike this very same spike was in flower also. Mr. H. N. Ridley has stated that the pigeon orchid days of Singapore do not synchronise with those of Siam but if plants be brought from Siam to Singapore these introduced plants follow the Singapore dates behaving just like plants native to Singapore.\n\nNow the general flowering of a number of individuals on one particular day cannot be accidental and it is evident that the flowering of Dendrobium crumenatum is not merely a habit induced by endless repetition from time immemorial but also that the species is in such exact relation to the climatic conditions of the environment that a certain series of external conditions produces precisely the same response in many or all of the orchids which are subjected to those conditions: and after all this phenomenon differs only in degree from the seasonal changes of plants in countries where seasons are well marked.\n\nFrom observations on cultivated plants of all orders it appears that the bees of Sarawak affect particularly all blue flowers\u2014the morning glory convolvulus for in instance is daily visited by swarms of bees, these mostly of small species however\u2014and too they are attracted by fragrant flowers of any colour. Now none of the orchids are blue so that speaking generally the only orchid flowers that are visited by bees are such as have a fragrant odour. To this class belongs the aerides odoratum known in Sarawak as the 'Lingga orchid.' This orchid blooms once a year\u2014in 1908 it flowered about the middle of January: the inflorescences are large and conspicuous and there is a fragrant odour. These flowers are visited by large numbers of the big black carpenter bee (Xylocopa latipes): they pass from flower to flower seeking the nectar and at the same time removing some pollinia. In the same neighbourhood there happened to be a big clump of sweet smelling pigeon\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\norchids but these were passed by unnoticed. In the case of this aerides nearly all the flowers produced seed pods which is as I have already stated an uncommon occurrence for a large flowered orchid. By experiment I found that any flower could be fertilised by its own pollinia so that the chances of fertilisation are very much better than those of an orchid which like Dendrobium crumenatum must be cross fertilised.\n\nAnother very common orchid indigenous to Sarawak is the Arundina speciosa popularly called the 'Bau orchid.' According to Dr. Forbes this species has become so modified in Java that self-fertilisation without the intervention of any insect always takes place and all the flowers set seed pods. Now this never occurs in Sarawak though the flowers can be artificially self-fertilised; ordinarily very few seed pods are formed on this orchid and fertilisation when it occurs at all is effected by insect visitors. Dr. Forbes statement has been recently confirmed by Mr. Smith of Buitenzorg who cites other instances of like phenomena viz.: all the specimens of Tainia penangiana from Java and Ambon cultivated in the Buitenzorg gardens shew auto-fecundation but specimens sent over from Singapore and grown in Buitenzorg under exactly the same conditions are never self-fertilised:\n\nSpathoglottis plicata from western Java is self-fertilised but a specimen from Ambon behaves differently: Phajus Blumei in Singapore is in some individuals self-fertilised and in others not so (H. N. Ridley) and Mr. Smith found the same thing in Java where the majority however are self-fertilised. It seems then that it is not very unusual to find orchids which in general floral structure are almost typical and which nevertheless are habitually self-fertilised without the help of insects all the flowers producing good seed pods; as regard those orchids which are dependent on insects the species which are capable of self-fertilisation set far more pods than those which must be cross fertilised. Further all the orchids have good method of vegetative reproduction though this will not effect a wide dispersal of the species except perhaps in such cases as Arundina speciosa whose lateral branches readily break off.\nthe axils and could be carried long distances by violent winds. It is evident then that orchids are not so much dependent on cross-fertilisation for their propagation and dispersal as might be supposed from a study of the floral structure alone.\n\nTo return to Arundina speciosa: this has been under observation for months and on one occasion only a bee visitor was seen in the flowers. On Dec. 16.07 in the morning a solitary bee (Apis dorsata) was observed to enter the flowers of a large clump of this orchid: it visited about a dozen flowers spending about half a minute in each flower. Eventually it was captured and on the thorax posteriorly an accumulated heap of pollinia had collected. It is probable therefore that Arundina speciosa is occasionally fertilised by the agency of bees but nevertheless this is such a rare visitor that we must look elsewhere for the insect which is more usually responsible for the fertilisation of Arundina speciosa. And this is found to be the large skipper butterfly Erionota thrax which on certain evenings at about 6 p.m. pass with rapid flight from flower to flower spending a brief moment at each: sometimes pollinia are removed but often this is not the case. Between the dates Aug. 20.07 and Sept. 28.07 eleven plants were under careful examination. During this time 224 flowers were produced but only 15 capsules resulted.\n\nFertilisation took place only between the dates Sept. 2 and Sept. 21 as follows:\n\n| Date   | Flowers |\n|--------|---------|\n| Sept. 2 | 1       |\n| Sept. 6 | 2       |\n| Sept. 13 | 3      |\n| Sept. 15 | 2      |\n| Sept. 17 | 3      |\n| Sept. 19 | 2      |\n| Sept. 21 | 2      |\n\nDuring this time the Skipper butterfly was observed in some numbers at dusk: the orchids which were fertilised were adjacent to a group of Banana plants on the leaves of which the caterpillars of Erionota feed. In this same period pollinia were removed in no less than 29 observed cases (there may perhaps have been more): sometimes these were noticed after heavy storms of rain and wind and in one case the pollinia had\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\ndropped on to the labellum in another case the pollinia cap had become detached and had caught on the stigmatic surface. Nevertheless no relationship can be found between the rainfall and fertilisation, and though self-fertilisation through the agency of storms is not the usual mode yet it may occasionally happen as the stigma is receptive to pollinia of the same flower.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the butterfly Erionota thrax, which effects the fertilisation of Arundina speciosa in Sarawak is a common insect in Java.\n\nA few structural abnormalities were observed in these flowers: in one case half the labellum was normal and the other half was petaloid: in no less than three cases there were supernumerary pollinia on the column each having a distinct pollinia cap. But there were no variations in the direction of auto-fecundation.\n\nIn a few isolated cases we have observed bees engaged on the flowers of orchids which have no fragrance: for instance Renanthera maingayi and alba of large showy but scentless flowers commonly cultivated in Sarawak are rarely fertilised and we have never seen insect visitors at the flowers but the Rev. John Perham assures us that the carpenter bees occasionally visit the flowers of R. maingayi: and on one occasion, at 6 p.m., we saw a single specimen of the bee apis dorsita very busy at the flowers of a large Cymbidium and the bee was found to have pollinia on the metathorax and yet these flowers are of dull red colour and are scentless.\nStory of the Burong Geruda and the Raja Merong Mahawangsa.\n\nBY HON. R. N. BLAND FROM THE KEDAH ANNALS.\n\nAfter the war of Sri Rama and Raja Handuman, the Island of Langka Puri was deserted except by the bird \"Geruda.\" The Geruda was a descendant of Raja Dewa. He was exceedingly wise and powerful. All birds and beasts feared him.\n\nOne day the Eagle came and said to him \"Has the news reached you O Geruda that the Raja of Rum is going to marry his son to the daughter of the Emperor of China? These countries are very far apart, one at the rising, the other at the setting of the Sun; the sultan is sending his son with a mighty fleet. They are even now weighing anchor and setting sail. The Cockatoo gave me the news. He saw the messengers who went backwards and forwards. Then I the Eagle flew upwards and saw that his report was true.\"\n\nThen said the Geruda to the Eagle \"Such arrogance can not be allowed and I will consult the Nabi Suleiman about it.\" So the Geruda flew to the throne of the Nabi Suleiman and told him what he had heard about the marriage of the prince and princess saying that such a match was not meet or fitting the countries being so far apart. Said the Nabi: \"If it is the will of Allah, no one can separate them.\" Then said the Geruda: \"Give me this task and if I do not succeed let me be banished from the sky, and the earth, and all abodes of men.\" \"Be it so,\" replied the Nabi, \"do what is in your power with this condition that you must tell me whatever you do.\" Bowing before the throne, the bird Geruda promised and departed.\n\nHe flew far over the sea to the land of China. There he saw the princess playing in a garden with a companion and\nfemale servants. He swooped down, and carried off the princess and two attendants in his talons to the Island of Langka Puri. He placed them in his house and went off to find food for them. And whatever the Princess wished for, that did the bird Geruda obtain for her.\n\nNow the Sultan (Raja) of Rum assembled the princes who stood crowned before him, together with his wise men and his officers and his guards and all his vassals in the great hall of his court and declared to them his intention of sending his son to the land of China. He commanded an expedition to be got ready with a fleet and enquired who he could trust to take his place as leader.\n\nNow his friend Raja Merong Mahawangsa who was a royal prince, and who had married a princess sprung from the Indra and Gergasi fairies and Genii was present. He was esteemed very wise and valiant among all the Rajas. To him said the Raja of Rum: \"Oh brother! will you go to marry my son to the daughter of the Chinese Emperor?\" Then the Raja Merong Mahawangsa bowed low and said that he would do whatever his lord commanded.\n\nThus the ships were made ready, many vessels and kechis to accompany the prince. Then on a favourable day they took leave and made for the open sea.\n\nSo with anchors weighed and sails set they followed the ship (bhatra) of the prince, one half of Raja Merong Mahawangsa fleet behind, one half in front to lead the way to the Celestial land.\n\nFor a long time their voyage lay past the countries tributary to the great Raja of Rum, and from many broad rivers and from headlands, kings came to bring provisions and gifts to them. In course of time they came to the land of the Hindoos. There many strange and wondrous sights met their eyes. And they doubled many headlands and sailed through many bays, the appearance of their fleet being like a flock of birds seeking their nest, their masts like a forest of pep\u0101ra trees, and\nthe whole sea resounded with the noise of their gongs and music.\n\nNow when they had sailed as far as Kuala Chingkong, the name of whose Raja was Klanggi, the face of the sun became darkened, and it seemed as if a storm were about to descend on them.\n\nThe ships drew near together, and the Raja Merong Mahawangsa going up on deck with his weapons saw that it was not a storm but an immense bird coming down on them, whose wings made a noise like the rushing of a hurricane.\n\nFor two days the fight with the bird Geruda went on. The ships received it with volleys of arrows and cannon shots. Raja Merong Mahawangsa on the first day brought forth his bow \"Aiyounan\" and the wondrous flame-tipped arrows. These he sent hustling into the air, and straightway they speed with a noise like rolling thunder, as it were a mountain come down, to overwhelm the Geruda, but he swiftly flying evaded them. Neither cared he for the other missiles, they glanced off harmlessly and fell into the sea, neither could Raja Merong Mahawangsa hit him on account of his swiftness.\n\nOn the second day the bird Geruda attacked again. In vain did Raja Merong Mahawangsa draw against him the bow Bran Pura. The fire-tipped arrows flew upwards with a noise like thunder and causing darkness as a storm of wind and rain, but they were all lost, nothing could wound the Geruda, even with the assistance of the Genii and air sprites. With beak and talons he seized six ships, scattering their crews into the sea, or letting them fall on the land.\n\nThen night came on, and the ships clustered together for mutual defence during the night. In the morning they repaired their shattered rigging and searched for some trace of their companions. But the sea gave up nothing, so after many days they sailed on. And when they had traced the mouth of the river, whose name is Marib, again they perceived a terrible darkness growing in the sky with a noise of wind and rain and fearful roaring. Then their hearts sank, but nevertheless they moored the ships and prepared to once more receive the Geru-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nda with missiles and arrows. These, as before, were of no avail. When the Raja Merong Mahawangsa saw that the Geruda was coming down on them, he took his third bow, whose name was Perasa Simpani Gambera, and putting one of his flame tipped arrows to the string he said \"O Perasa Simpani Gambera, go forth and destroy the Geruda.\" Then the arrow flew through the clouds and straightway a troop of Jins and Shaitans appeared to assist against the Geruda. But the bird cared not for them nor was his heart daunted. Swooping down he carried off many ships in his beak and claws, either plunging their crews into the sea or dashing them down amongst the lofty forest trees, so that their bodies were scattered in fragments and utterly destroyed.\n\nAt this great was the anger of the Raja Merong Mahawangsa. With another arrow he shot at the Geruda, and the sky and sea were filled with a noise like rolling thunder. This time the arrow took the form of the bird Jentaigu, rushing to attack the bird Geruda. Now ensued a desperate struggle, the birds fighting with beak and talons. At last the Jentaigu was overcome by the flames breathed out by the Geruda, and, as an arrow, returned to the quiver of Raja Merong Mahawangsa. Thus night fell and the fleet was for a time left unmolested by the bird Geruda. And in the morning seeing that the Geruda did not come, they weighed anchor and sailed on. And after sailing for several days they arrived at Pulau Selang. In the meantime the Geruda had retired to a lofty mountain and was planning how to destroy the whole fleet, for he feared Raja Merong Mahawangsa, who was indeed the bravest and most skilful chief of his time.\n\nNow when the fleet had reached the Island of Selang, they stood in need of wood and water and Raja Merong Mahawangsa was deputed by the Prince to land and fetch it, while the rest of the fleet sailed on. And sailing on they came to the Island of Langka Puri. There, during the night time, they were attacked by the Geruda who had no longer to fear Raja Merong Mahawangsa. The fleet was utterly destroyed. The Prince however, survived. He found himself floating on the\nwater, clinging to a loose plank alone in the wide sea, without food, at the mercy of wind and waves.\n\nWhen Raja Merong Mahawangsa had taken in wood and water, he set sail to rejoin the Prince at day break. Presently he came to the spot where the Geruda had destroyed the fleet. There he found a few men still swimming about, these he picked up and learned from them what had happened. For many days he searched for the Prince, then not finding him he sailed on with his people till they reached the Islands named Seraya, Jambul and Lada. A little further on lay the mainland for with they steered. There the Raja landed and was welcomed by the Genii and other supernatural inhabitants of that land. They at length invited the Raja to become their ruler by reason of his valour and the nobleness of his language. There they built a palace and a fortress for him, and his people, with their wives and families formed a kampong or village around. And in a short time the kingdom thus founded became prosperous and powerful. Many people came to settle amongst them and from all lands to trade with them.\n\nIn the meantime, the Prince was left swimming alone in the sea on his plank.\n\nFor several days he drifted, borne along by winds and currents. He had neither food nor drink, the sun beat on him, the waves buffeted him, his body became all covered over with mussels and limpets. At last he was washed ashore on the shore of Langka Puri. Lying in a cranny of the rocks, he was too exhausted to speak or move, he could only groan.\n\nNow the Chinese Princess with her attendants had been carried off to this very Island of Langka Puri by the Geruda, and it happened that when the Prince of Rum was thrown upon the coast, the Geruda was away finding food, while the Princess and her nurse had come down to the shore to look for shells and crabs and coral; suddenly they heard a noise of groaning, and the Princess bade her nurse go and see what the noise was. She was terribly frightened when looking over some rocks she saw a strange thing like a man, but with a body all covered with sea weeds and limpet. She did not stay to\nlook twice, but ran straight back to the Princess to tell her what she had seen. She declared she could not tell whether it were a man or an evil spirit. Then the Princess smiled and bade her go back and not be afraid, but find out whether it were a man or not and bring back word. So the nurse went and took courage to approach and speak to the Prince, who slowly and with difficulty told her who he was and what had happened to him. When the nurse heard this she felt very sorry for him and returning told the Princess. Then the Princess was glad indeed and with the help of the two attendants she bore the poor Prince and hid him in a cave lest the Geruda should find him, and she told the nurse to give him a bath and scrape the shells off his body and to be careful not to give him rice at first, but only rice water until his stomach should be stronger. And towards evening they piled up stones before the cave and left him for fear the Geruda should find him on its return.\n\nNow it was the Geruda's custom to leave the Island of Langka Puri every morning in search of food, returning only at nightfall; thus it was possible for the Princess's attendants to visit the Prince in his cave every day, to nurse him and bring him food. And after a short time the Prince recovered, and the nurse reported to her mistress that he was superior to the princes of all other countries in appearance and manners, but that he was sadly in want of clothes. So the Princess thought of a plan. When the Geruda returned at evening she addressed him, \"Oh, my father, you have brought us here and are always taking pains to get us what we want, but there is something more I wish for. I have left all my clothes behind. There is in my father's palace in China a room set round with mirrors, and in it a chest hinged with ivory and set with emeralds. In this chest are all my clothes. Will you, oh father, go and get it for me?\" The Geruda replied that he would gladly and immediately set out.\n\nSo the Geruda flew away till he came near the Emperor's palace when he caused a storm of wind and rain and darkness to come on which shook the whole building and roared horrib-\nly overhead. Then the Emperor and his great men who were feasting inside were terribly frightened. They began to tremble, and no man knew what to do or what was going to happen. However, the Geruda did not do them any harm, but simply pulled down part of the wall of the palace and put in his head and seized the box as the Princess had told him, and flew away with it back to Langka Puri. The Princess was not a little glad to get back her box; she pulled out all the things and looked at them and choosing some of the best she gave them to her nurse to take to the Prince, as soon as the Geruda should be out of the way.\n\nAt last the Prince was fit to meet the Princess, and dressed out in his fine clothes like a Raja the Princess thought she had never seen a young Prince like him.\n\nSo they embraced and kissed each other, and sat hand in hand, dreading the time when they would have to separate for fear of the Geruda. But there was no help for it\u2014at evening they had to go, both weeping and lamenting their sad condition. Thus day after day, till at last the Geruda told the Princess that he was going to present himself before the Nabi Suleiman and that she must behave well in his absence. When after flying for many days, the Geruda arrived before the throne of the Nabi Suleiman bending low he told him how he had prevented the marriage of the son of the Sultan of Rum with the daughter of the Emperor of China, and whatever else had happened. Then said the Nabi: \"But suppose the Prince of Rum should be alive, what then O Geruda?\" The Geruda answered: \"Should this be so and the Prince meet the Princess O Nabi, let the former vow take effect, let me depart from all the habitations of men and from beneath the sky, and from the face of the round world.\" At this the Nabi smiled and bade him who ruled over the Imps or Spirits and whose name was Herman Shah take 100 of his Imps and mentris and fly off to Langka Puri, to seize whomsoever they might find there, put them into a large box and bring them back at once. On their return, the Nabi ordered the box to be opened in his presence and that of the Geruda. Out came the Prince of Rum, the Princess of China and the two attendants!\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nThen said the Nabi Suleiman to the Geruda; \"Listen O Geruda, and all ye Rajas, warriors and subjects. From this ye may learn that whatever Allah has decreed will surely come to pass. He provides for all mankind, and watches over their affairs and because, O Geruda you have not believed this and have tried to thwart the design of Allah with regard to the son of the Raja of Rum and the daughter of the Raja of China, I now banish you to the sea called Kolzum (Red Sea) to which mankind cannot approach.\"\n\nThe Geruda replied: \"If this is the command of the Nabi Suleiman, I obey,\" and straightway he flew away in the direction of the Sea of Kolzum where he remains to this day.\n\nThen the Nabi Suleiman commanded his mentris to prepare letters in the language of the Imps addressed to the Raja of Rum and the Emperor of China, to inform them of all that had happened to their children, and at the wish of the Prince of Rum he directed the Raja to recall Raja Merong Mahwangsa who had founded a Kingdom on the Island of Seraya. The letters having been written and addressed in the proper style, the Nabi commanded Hermanshah to proceed with his jins and mentris to the Court of the Emperor of China taking the Prince and Princess and their attendants with them.\n\nNow the Emperor of China was in his Hall of Audience, consulting with his mentris and chief officers, hulubalangs, sidasidas etc., as to what reply should be sent back to the Raja of Rum by the messengers who had come to obtain news of the Prince and Princess. Suddenly the Mangkabumi (Chamberlain) saw Herman Shah, the Raja of the Jins appearing on the threshold. Going forward great was his surprise to learn his name and mission. Taking him by the hand he led him before the Emperor who rose from his seat as a sign of honour. Then Herman Shah presented the letters from the Nabi Suleiman and caused the box containing the Prince and Princess to be brought before His Majesty. The letter having been honoured with all proper ceremony, it was read out by the Mangkabumi. And when the letters had been read the box was opened and the Prince and Princess appeared before the Emperor. Then was\nthe Emperor glad, he kissed and embraced his daughter and was highly delighted with the appearance of the young Prince. So a feast was prepared and all the Jins and ambassadors and nobles were entertained, and the Emperor sent word throughout all his Empire and its tributaries to prepare to celebrate the marriage of the Prince and Princess as the Nabi Suleiman had commanded. And the ambassadors were directed to return to inform the Raja of Rum of the happy ending of his son's adventures.\nMy Trip to Belum.\n\nBy E. W. Birch, C.M.G.\n\nWe started from Grit for Belum on Monday, the 26th July. Hubert Berkeley, J. W. Simmons, the Datoh Sri Adika Raja, I.S.O., the hereditary Chief of Upper Perak, and I.\n\nWe had 21 elephants, one of which is probably the tallest in Perak. He is named Bogeck and stands 9 ft. 4\u00bd ins. at the shoulder. His master, the Datoh Wan Man\u2014the headman of the district for which we were bound\u2014had come down to Grit to meet me and was our guide to Belum.\n\nWe began our journey by walking eight miles to Bersiah, where we camped. The elephants took over seven hours to make the journey. They can go two miles an hour when the going is good, but deep mud, hills, river fords and fallen trees delay them. At \u00bc past 12 we reached Kuala Rui and saw how it empties its muddy water, full of mining silt, into the beautiful Perak river.\n\nWe passed through bamboo country and crossed some fair-sized streams.\n\nBersiah is a village with 64 people of all ages, who live in miserable bamboo huts and have but little cultivation of a permanent nature. The evil of opium smoking is very evident amongst the Patani Malays here and elsewhere and destroys their usefulness as agriculturists. There is some padi land, and some more will be irrigated next year at Banderiang, on the Grit side of Bersiah.\n\nThe people suffer a great deal from goitre (bengok), and this was more noticeable the further we went up country. The Datoh Sri Adika Raja tells me that goitre is a peculiarity of the interior of all the surrounding Malayan countries as one nears the mountains: and that the Malays attribute it to the water the people drink. They believe that the water is infected by some unknown aka\u0159 (root or creeper).\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nOn the 27th, we broke camp at 7.30 a.m., and reached Kuala Temengor at 2.50. The scenery on the river here is beautiful. We went on up the Temengor river and camped at Dusun Memalik at 3.35.\n\nThe Temengor here is bigger and carries a larger volume of water than the Batang Padang river at Tapah. As we turned into Dusun Memalik, some of our men saw a tiger on the path but it did not visit our camp, having been frightened away probably by our elephants. One of the Chinese cooks was suffering so badly from fever that we sent him down on a raft to Kuala Kendrong, two miles from Grit. He is an opium smoker.\n\nWe wake up on the 28th to find it raining, and when we broke camp at 8.30 a.m., Berkeley and I walked on to Berusong, 1\u00bd miles. We waited for the elephants at the turn off of the Temengor path. It is nine miles from there to the village of the Mengkong of Temengor. We followed up the Kelantan path on elephants, the rain having fortunately stopped. There are few more uncomfortable experiences than to travel slowly on elephants when it is raining. Malays say that in elephant travelling there are three things to avoid\u2014darkness, rain and camping near cultivation.\n\nWe had to run the risk of the last of these evils more than once and had to pay trifling sums for what the elephants ate. It is extraordinary that they don\u2019t do more damage. They are bathed on arrival at a camp, turned loose with a chain on one leg which they drag about after them, their gembalas (mahout) visit them when near cultivation before dark and find them again at daybreak when they are again bathed and saddled. Their wooden bells (kerotok) and the cracking of bamboos tell their whereabouts, and are the only noises one hears in the stillness of the forest nights. In my walk of 1\u00bd miles to Berusong I picked 34 leeches off my legs, but that was a trifle to what we experienced later.\n\nBerusong is the field of old gold workings of ages ago, but people still hold land there. That gold is there no one doubts, but the water difficulty prevents systematic working. We\npassed through some fine forest with good merbau trees. No one cuts them, for no one has need of timber up here. We kept the Perak river on our left, at a distance of about five miles all the way and camped at 5 p.m., on the Singor river at Kuala Bubong. The Singor is a fine river with a considerable volume of water and may be compared for size to the Plus.\n\nOur camp was on the habitat of *semut api* (a large black ant), which bites painfully and is feared by Malays. A good deal of sweeping and some kerosene oil drove them away.\n\nJust before we reached our camping ground, an accident, which might have been serious but was fortunately only laughable, occurred. Simmons and our Chaplain (Haji Hamat) were riding on Meh Mas (the golden girl), and she was being immediately followed by Bogek up a steepish bank.\n\nBogek is a queer-tempered elephant, and as Meh Mas was climbing too slowly to please him, he dug her in the rump with his tusks and over she rolled. Her small gembala and the two occupants of her saddle (*rengka*) were thrown out but luckily without bruises.\n\nOn the 29th, we broke camp at 8 a.m., and travelled on elephants up the Singor river through pleasing scenery as far as Pineris, which we reached at 10 a.m. Just before we got there, we saw a most magnificent *ara* tree (*ficus*) on the opposite bank. I have rarely seen a better specimen.\n\nAll the people have left Pineris and moved to Banding on the Perak river. It seems a great pity that a place so beautifully situated and so well planted up should have been deserted. There is padi land below it, but not sufficient water for regular irrigation, and it has never been tilled. The settlement was formed in 1904 to check the raids of Legeh men who came in to look for *kayu gaharu*, and in that direction it was successful. Berkeley gave the settlers poultry and seedlings, appointed an Assistant Penghulu, and built a halting bungalow and school. But the first year locusts ate most of their crop of hill\n\n---\n\n* This scented agila-wood is found in the heart of one or two trees generally in the tengkaras (Malay) or depu (Patani).\npadi (humu); and for the next two or three years the ear of the corn was empty. This so disheartened them that, when the transfer of the upper country began to be talked about, they asked leave to move over the border to Banding. The school is about to be moved there now. From Pineris to the Kelantan border the distance is 30 miles, and there is a good path most of the way. We left Pineris and the Singor river at 10.35. The path was rather overgrown, and I applied the golok (cutting knife) vigorously to overhanging branches, when, to my sorrow, I cut into the nest of penyenyat (wasp), and quicker than anything else but lightning I received ten stings distributed over my right ear, my right-hand and both ankles. The pain was intense for a few minutes and was followed by a feeling of numbness. Soon we came upon some truly magnificent trees of wild cotton (kekabu hutan). They were from 16 to 20 feet in circumference, straight for 150 feet and plentifully topped with leaves very like those of the ordinary cotton tree. The cotton which these trees yield is said to be peculiarly soft. We got into camp at Sungei Banun at 2.30.\n\nFrom 3 to 4 p.m., Berkeley and I sat in the sira banun (sulphur spring) and waited for big game but it was a hopeless wait from the first, for the bells of our elephants must have driven all game away. We saw the marks, very fresh, of an immense elephant, and it was not long before we were to hear of him.\n\nWe netted a beautiful kelak, the best of our river fish, for dinner.\n\nAt 1 a.m., on the 30th, I awoke with a racking headache and stayed awake till coffee was ready at 4.20 a.m. I had unmistakable signs of fever on me, so took quinine and determined to walk it off. At 7.30 Simmons and I left camp, and guided by Datoh Wan Man, walked six miles to Kuala Kriong on the Perak river. We got there at 10.30 in bright sunshine, waded across the river and selected a small stone tanjong or bank for a camp.\n\nWe encountered leeches innumerable on our walk, and had to stop every few yards to pick them off. The remaining\nChinese cook walked behind me and was very busy and useful all the way.\n\nAt noon Berkeley came in, saying that three of our female elephants had followed a wild tusker\u2014undoubtedly the one whose marks we had seen at the sira\u2014and that he had left Saiyid Wahab and three gembalas behind to try to catch them. A little later the Saiyid came in looking very white. The tusker had chased him. He had fired in the air and then managed, just in time, to crawl under some fallen logs.\n\nAlang Sagor, the chief gembala of Datoh Wahab (the Penghulu of Sungei Raia in Kinta), in his frantic haste to get away had fallen on to a log and fractured his right-arm, half way between the wrist and the elbow. He and the other two gembalas had come in with Saiyid Wahab.\n\nBerkeley very skilfully set Alang Sagor's arm in bamboo splints, but, at his request, took off the splint; for Datoh Wan Man had some jadam (asafoetida) in his bundle, and that applied with boiling water forms a sort of a plaster. That done, Berkeley rebound the arm in splints, and when two days later we left Alang Sagor, and another gembala, Ismail, who was suffering from fever, at Tapong, he told me that his arm felt quite easy.\n\nIt rained incessantly all that afternoon and until after we went to bed, but I personally slept for nine hours and woke up at 5 a.m., with my fever gone.\n\nThe three missing elephants belonged, one to Datoh Wahab, one to Raja Harun, and one to the young Datoh Muda of Kinta, Berkeley sent away four gembalas from Kriong to catch them.\n\nOn the 31st July, Simmons and I, with Datoh Wan Man, the leech-removing cook, and half a dozen men, crossed the river on elephants and began our walk to Tapong at 7.20 a.m. We immediately came upon the tracks of the wild tusker. Datoh Wan Man told us that the elephant had left the females and crossed the Perak river in the night to where our remaining 18 elephants were turned loose. One of our gembalas, going at dawn to catch his elephant, saw the tusker and in\nrunning away fell down and hurt his back but not seriously. Wan Man was sure that the tusker was still across the river, but enjoined upon us the advisability of strict silence. We followed his gigantic tracks for half a mile up the Tapong path and then sure enough found that he had turned back to cross the river. So we walked on with quicker steps and unconstrained tongues, meeting with uncountable leeches, which kept us both, and indeed all the party, continuously occupied.\n\nWe walked through two sira and reached Perenggan at 10 a.m.* We found that Wan Husein was encamped there, but he had gone to visit some Sakai, so Simmens and I, with our party, pushed on, on small bamboo rafts, one mile up-river to Tapong.\n\nThe kampongs are all deserted at Tapong and the people have moved down to Perenggan, where there are now 39 of them.\n\nBut we found a delightful white-sand bank on which the sun was blazing. We had taken the precaution to bring all our washed and wet clothes in two bundles and we spread them out and completely dried everything by the time (1.30 p.m.) Berkeley came in with the elephants. As soon as the tents were pitched the cast-nets were at work and we got quite a good catch.\n\nThe bank on which we camped was covered with bayam pasir (sand spinach) in full blossom. The flower is like an everlasting, ranging from pink to magenta in colour.\n\nWan Husein paid us a visit and chatted, and the Tapong people came up to sell fowls and fruit, and were commissioned to make five rafts for us to be ready for our return journey down river.\n\n* This old boundary of a hundred years ago is always described in the Malay Saw\u2014\"Batu belah kekabu hutan Padang Limau Nipis.\" We saw the split rock (a poor specimen) left by a Sultan's sword, but the wild cotton tree had disappeared.\u2014It shed white blossoms on the Perak side and red on the Patani side. The other boundary referred to, Padang Limau Nipis, is not now part of Perak.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nOn the 1st August, we left the best camp we had so far found at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 8. We crossed the river at once on elephants, entered some belukar (secondary growth) and lost our way. We took nearly an hour to find it.\n\nThe midges were terribly annoying, a species called rengit. It would be quite improper to put on paper the only language in which they were fitly described. We forded the Perak river six times, and near one of the crossings Berkeley told us the story of the death of Mengkong Gos. He lived about 80 years ago, and was a well-known Patani Chief. He gave offence to the Raja of Reman because of his friendly attitude to Perak people. The Raja sent for him and at the little lalang patch at Bruah he met the Raja\u2019s messenger. They both got off their elephants to shake hands and, while the Reman man gripped the old Mengkong\u2019s hand, a Chinese Mualaf (convert to Islamism), stabbed the Mengkong from behind. The kris bent double, and the old chief, seeing that his life must be taken, said: \u201cNo kris can kill me unless I jampi it\u201d (imbue it with magical power). He then took the kris in his hands and straightened it out. When he had done so, he handed it back to the Mualaf who stabbed him. So the legend goes: it is a good story, but the Mengkong seems to have sought his fate. He was the great-grandfather of the present Mengkong of Temengor.\n\nWe reached camp at Tronoh at 3 p.m. when Husein pitched his tent on the river bank, but we all set up ours on a stony island and there made the acquaintance of yet another insect. It is called tungau (sand-tick), and is most diminutive. Bright red in colour, it looks exactly like a grain of Cayenne pepper. It invades your person and proceeds without delay to bury itself under the skin. It is difficult to see, and more difficult to pick out. It is said to feed for about four days and then work itself out and drop off. Meanwhile, as most of our party can vouch from experience, it is itchy. It does not deserve to be spoken of in nicer language.\n\nBerkeley and the Datoh Sri Adika Raja went out fishing and their success compensated us for small evils.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nOn the 2nd August, we left our camp at 7.45 a.m., and at once got into the open out Jeram Kekua (a fine rapid). Here there is a wide rocky bay with very slippery going for elephants. Kulop Bintang fell and split both his tusks. Our little enemies, the renjit, were most persistent. At 8.45 we skirted Lobok Panjang (the long pool). The Perak river runs quite straight and deep here for some three-quarters of a mile between high banks.\n\nWe seemed to be steadily climbing. At 11.15 we crossed a fine clear stream of some size, the Sungei Tahan, and later crossed the main river five times. Near one crossing, Manik, we came on the spot where one of Mr. Caulfeild\u2019s camp followers was taken in 1884 by a tiger out of an elephant\u2019s kop (howdah) in the middle of the camp. It is a tiger country, and many are the tales told of how man-eaters have killed people in the past.\n\nWe went on further than we had intended, passed Jakat without knowing it, and camped at 3.20 p.m., in a place that was not inviting. A species of cobra and an ular matahari (a beautiful but poisonous whipcord snake) were killed within a foot of each other where my tent was being pitched, and when the ground for Simmons\u2019 tent was being prepared, a few minutes later, a small ular matahari was killed. It is very rarely that one sees snakes in big jungle, so this incident is quite remarkable.\n\nWhile we were all bathing in the river, we heard elephants trumpeting, and the gembalas were sent off to see what had happened. Bogek was tethered, but Kulop Chandan, a big tusker of the Sultan\u2019s, passed within the length of his chain and received two pokes in the neighbourhood of his tail. Berkeley examined the marks but decided that they were not serious.\n\nOn the 3rd August, Simmons and I left camp at 7.15 a.m., and rode on Meh Mas as far as the Rest-house, which Wan Husein has established at Tunggul Burok (the rotten stump). There we got off at 9.20, and led by Datoh Wan Man and followed by the Chinese cook and Simmons\u2019 Malay boy (a Saiong man), we commenced to walk into B\u00e9lum. We crossed at least\nseven respectable streams, so it is not to be wondered at that the Perak river carries down from its ulu a fine body of water and that heavy rains easily create floods. The first part of our walk was along an excellent path and in open bamboo country,* and we strode on in good spirits. Mine were presently damped, for I did not see an overhanging tree above the path, and a very solid one at that. I walked straight into it with my head and was almost stunned. Then we began to climb a hill and, at the worst point, I heard an exclamation from behind and saw Simmons clap his left-hand to his left ear apparently. I said \"hornets\" to the old Datoh and we did an excellent sprint up the hill followed by Simmons, the cook who had been stung in the hand, and the boy who was apparently in as much pain as if he too had been stung. We ran up into some lalang, and as I saw a patch of jungle on the right where there was shade, I urged the Datoh to run into it and we all followed. We hoped that the hornets would go on up the path and that we should escape. We were breathless and wanted a rest. When Simmons came in, I saw he was bleeding freely behind the ear. I was just going to suggest whisky as a remedy applied locally (I had a flask), when he said: \"There is one of them on you.\" We all immediately bolted into the lalang and down the path. Some 200 yards further on we entered jungle and Simmons saw one sitting on my leather belt. He crushed it with a walking stick. We picked it up off the ground and beheaded it on a log. Then only did I see that it was not an ordinary hornet (tebuwan), but a panahliang.\u2020 This fearsome hornet, the worst of all stinging insects in Malaya, is fortunately\n\n*W. G. Maxwell, in his delightful book \"In Malay Forests,\" makes too much, if I may say so, of the gloom or impenetrable darkness of the forest. In betukar, where elephants chiefly feed and in swampy places which the rhinoceros haunts, I grant that his description is correct. But in old forest one can not only see for some little distance, but can make one's way.\n\n\u2020 From panah\u2014an arrow, and liang\u2014a hole in the ground. This species of hornet makes its nest in a hole in the ground. If you tread on or disturb its nest, it darts at you like an arrow out of the hole.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nuncommon. Its yellow band is lighter than the orange of the hornet. Its wing is more gauzy and browner than the tebuwan's wing. Its bite is said to produce fever, and quinine is always asked for if a white man is near by. It is reputed that six will kill a man, from ten to twenty a buffalo, while quite a few will make an elephant do what we did\u2014i.e., run. It is said that for a radius of four feet round their nest all vegetation is killed. I am a lucky person to have had two settle on me and yet not have been stung. Simmons' neck continued to bleed, but, soon after he was stung, we overtook Wan Husein on an elephant. He produced a bottle of Siamese medicine, menthol and peppermint, with a odour of snuff, which gave great relief. Wan Husein's gambala was stung under the left eye and the poor man's face was terribly swollen. Later, when our elephants came in, we heard that five or six men had been stung. Berkeley escaped by making his elephant walk at a funeral pace, a rate of progression to which the panahliang is quite unaccustomed.\n\nWe got a good view of Ateng, a fine hill about five miles off. We then went down to the river bank and goat-walked for about a mile. It was not till 1.10 p.m., after four hours' hard walking, that we reached Lembu\u2014the first village in Belum. The water of young cocoanuts was greedily drunk. There are only 13 people in the village. One hundred yards further on is Kubong Rengit (the pond of the sandfly) with eight inhabitants. A quarter of a mile along the padi-fields we came to an ideal camping ground on a high bank over the Perak river, with short grass shaded by angasana (pterocarpus) trees. We all camped there on Tuesday and decided to stay till Friday morning, so as to rest our elephants and see the people of the eight villages. The elephants had travelled on an average for seven hours a day, which is as much as can be expected of them. At 5 p.m., I took my gun out and got a right and left at jungle fowl, bagging both. There is a clearing at Tandok close to our camp, one house with two people.\n\nOn the 4th August, at 5.30., I was up for coffee and went out with my gun. I had two shots at jungle fowl but only\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nbagged one. I walked on to Lapang Hanyir (open land with a sour smell), which is the Datoh Wan Man's chief residence. His wife is a leper. There are 23 people in the village. The padi-fields are terraced, and years ago there must have lived a clever native engineer who irrigated all these fields, bringing water from the Maka river through a deep cutting. Later in the day the people of Beliming (on both banks of the river), of Kebeng and of Greh came in and from their lips I took a census, which showed 27 males, 29 females and 69 children, or 125 in all, in those villages. We had a long talk with the Imam, whom I confirmed in his office, and told the people to build a mosque and school at Maka, as it seems the most central place. We procured two goats and a buffalo for a feast for the village people and for our camp followers. All the debt slaves (16), except two, were brought before me, and I told them that their owners had been paid and that they were emancipated. Wan Husein had told all the villagers that they had been transferred to Perak from the protection of Siam, and I explained to them the lines of our administration. They said they would try to recall the people who had left their orchards and rice fields; they complained of the great difficulty in obtaining blachan and salt, but of rice they grew more than enough. They brought us in a quantity of fowls and very good rice. These people are at least 70 miles from Grit. There is no possibility of regularly supplying their wants, except by sending up an elephant once a month. If a Chinese shopkeeper can be induced to settle here he could do it, but as opium smoking is not practised in Belum, he should not be allowed to take opium up country. The whole population is about 206.\n\nThere is no prospect of planting in this district. The cost of transport would be in itself prohibitive.\n\nBelum stands at an elevation of over 1,500 feet above the sea, and has a healthy climate. But it is sad to see so many people, especially the young, afflicted with goitre. There are few mosquitoes and but little fever. It is quite a nice place when you get there. The journey is the rub.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nOn Thursday, the 4th August, Wan Husein went back to Betong. He showed me Hedgeland's map, with the new boundary marked on it, at Bangkok. He has been very friendly.\n\nWe left B\u0113lum on our return journey at 8 a.m., on Friday, the 6th August, and reached the rafts (rakit rembau) at 3 p.m., on the 7th at a place called Lobok Jerai (the pool of the ara tree). They were very comfortable and we slept on them. Sixteen bamboos are tied together with rattan: they form the main deck, 48 feet long by $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet wide. Under them are lashed five pairs of bamboos to raise the deck and also to act as a fender to it. In the centre of the deck is built the rumah or house, 11 by $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. It is raised 15 inches off the main deck by three bamboos crosswise, resting on three length-wise, and on the top is a flat flooring of split bamboo. Sticks are tied on to the sides of the house and a tent hung over them forms the roof. Five men pole them, one of whom in the bow is chosen for his intimate knowledge of the rapids which have to be negotiated.\n\nBefore dinner the cast-net was taken out and 35 fish were caught, a large and two small kelak, some rong, tengalan and krai.\n\nOn the 8th August, I got off in the leading raft at 7.30., saw a deer which one of the men frightened away by shouting, and had a long shot at and missed a jungle fowl. It was a cloudy, cool morning with a fresh breeze, and the scenery, together with the excitement of the rapids, was quite entrancing. We went over sixteen rapids before we got to Tapong 10.45 and Perenggan 11.10. Only one of them was really exhilarating\u2014Jeran Bruah. You go down it in two big jumps. It is half way between and close to two rivers. The upper is Sungei Klian Mas (the river of the gold mine), and is so called because a number of Chinese were mining there years ago. There is doubtless gold still left. The other, Sungei Tiang, is quite a respectable stream. Five or six miles up it there are abandoned orchards of durians and cocoanuts, which are said to belong to the Mengkong of Temengor.\nAt Perenggan, one of our runaway elephants, the one belonging to Raja Harun, was feeding. It had been caught at the Rest-house at Pineris, and the other two had been heard of at Dusun Memalik. They were all evidently on their way back home, but Rana was outpaced by the others, because she had hobbles on her hind feet.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the ungka (Hylobates concolor) and siamang (Hylobates syndactylus) inhabit different banks of the Perak river: the former the true right bank and the latter the true left bank. After a great battle they came to this sensible arrangement on the two huge rocks about two miles above Kuala Kendrong. It is evident that the treaty did not extend to the higher reaches of the river, for in my journey I heard the cry or song of the wah-wah (ungka) on both banks. I was able to collect the seed beans of the beautiful creeping bauhinia, which covers so many jungle trees with its scarlet and orange blossoms. The Malays call it dedaup. Both banks have a fine lily growing by the water's edge. The Malays give it the somewhat generic name of pechah periyok. It has many beautiful split white flowers on a long stalk. I collected a few bulbs.*\n\nWe left Perenggan at 12.20 and met the Assistant Penghulu of Temengor coming up on a small raft to escort us. I took him on my raft. After passing over eight more rapids, we tied up at 3.15 p.m., to a sand bank opposite Sungei Ta-ar.\n\nOn the 9th August\u2014the seventh anniversary of the Coronation of King Edward VII\u2014we were off at 7.45 a.m. The Datoh Sri Adika Raja had gone on in his raft an hour before us, and by so doing saved us an hour's delay, for when we arrived at Jeram Goring at 8.30, he had not yet finished cutting away the overhanging branches on the left bank of the river which make this rapid difficult to negotiate. It was a fine rush through the water. Berkeley's raft stuck for two or three minutes in the approach to it. I had two high shots at pergam (the imperial pigeon), shot two grey hawks, saw a\n\n* Doubtless Crinum defixum, H. N. R.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nbeautiful *serigala* (jackal) like a red fox, heard the cry of the Argus pheasant (*kuwang raya*) several times, and was interested to watch about a dozen little birds (*merbah*) dipping down repeatedly from low branches to take their bath in the river. They were not after food but were just half diving into the water. At 11 a.m., we reached the Seniang rapid, and as ours was the leading raft, we stopped and took 20 minutes to cut away overhanging branches. Then, we plunged through. It was quite exciting. We reached Kuala Kedah at 12.20 and landed at Haji Mudin's kampong at Banding ten minutes later. This is the new settlement to which the people from Pineris have migrated. It can be watered as far as Palut for irrigation purposes from the Kedah it is said, but it should be thoroughly examined by a Public Works Officer before these poor people are induced to make a second settlement. With the help of Haji Mudin and the Assistant Penghulu, I made a census and found that there were 51 people of both sexes and all ages. I walked through the clearings and met a number of Sakai of the Kunchiau tribe (about 20 men, women and children), all with short curly hair. One fine young fellow stood 5 feet 10 inches, but the others were short though not diminutive. Three of the women had tiny babes at the breast. They tried to run away when they saw me, but we induced them to come back and chat. In the old days the Rajas used to take their children to be slaves, and sometimes, of course, the parents, if they resisted, were killed. We left Banding at 1.35 p.m., negotiated the Palut rapid which is rather nice, passed Bukit Tali Kail (hill of the fishing line)\u2014the boundary laid down in the Siamese Treaty of 1899 and marked with a stone\u2014and went on to Jeram Chenoh. We reached it at 3.15 and dashed through it. It is a fine jump down one ledge, but the water did not wet the rumah rakit. At 3.40 we passed the mouth of the Singor. This fine river, which I have previously mentioned, empties itself into the Perak at a rocky delta. The chief part of the stream comes surging through rocks not more than 20 feet apart. After having passed over 25 rapids, we stopped for the night opposite Kuala Rengkam. It was 4.45, and the men\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nhad had a long day. Our last rapid (Jeram Maya) was exhilarating, the waves being larger than we had so far encountered.\n\nWe saw some small rafts, those used to pole up-stream, at Banding. They are called lantin, and differ materially from the rakit. In the latter the bottom or thick end of the bamboos are in the bow. In the former the tops or thin end are in front. The number of bamboos used in a lantin is always an odd number. It varies from five to eleven. In the middle is a small raised bench with a handrail on each side. A lantin is about the same length, but not quite so long as a rakit. The centre bamboo is the longest and the others are each in turn shorter than one another. When green, the bamboos are lashed together, and both ends are raised by being rested on logs or on higher ground: the centre is then heavily weighted with stones, with the result that a good sheer is given to the raft.\n\nThe Datoh and I were off at 6.15 a.m., on the 10th August, and the early morning air was delightful. The men saw a bachang tree (a species of mango) and landed to pick some 30 fruit. I had a long shot at a jungle fowl. The Datoh stopped to get rotan lang to tie our rafts together at Kuala Temengor. At 7.30 we went alongside the right bank and I looked in at Sira Eseh and saw a sambur. It looked up at me and I had a shot of from 35 to 40 yards at its head. Off it went, and though we followed its tracks for about 200 yards, we could find no trace of blood. Eheu. The Datoh caught two fish from his raft while he waited. When I got back to mine, the rest of the flotilla had arrived.\n\nI do not know whether the legend of the burong lebong mentuwa (the bird which cut down the house of its mother-in-law) has ever been printed in English. The hornbill, like the poor, is always with you when in the jungle. This bird is a hornbill, but the upper ridge of the bill is solid. Its cry is tock-tock-tock and then the maddest of the mad laughs. Once upon a time a girl married a man, a thriftless lout: her mother, a widow, opposed the marriage. A few days later the girl, when cooking, asked for salt. The husband said there was\nnone. She told him to go to her mother and ask for some; the angry old lady refused to give it. He, in a rage drew his parang and hacked at one of the posts of the house tock-tock-tock and, as the house fell with a crash, he burst into loud laughter. For this crime he was turned into a bird. We often heard its cry on this trip: you do everywhere.\n\nAt 9.30 we reached Jeram Halangan, our tenth rapid. The Datoh shot through on his raft: the Assistant Penghulu said that the Datoh's raft had nearly turned over and that he was not going to dare to take me. Berkeley came up and agreed with him, that we should all get out of our rafts and lighten them as much as possible. So out we got. It was a great pity as the rapid proved quite negotiable and we went through far more exciting experiences later on. Kuala Temengor is just below this rapid and we all stopped. The Datoh's raft and mine were taken to pieces under his direction: the main deck was widened to 22 bamboos or 7 feet 6 inches. Under it 22 more bamboos were lashed: the rumah rakit was similarly widened. With Berkeley, I visited the five families (20 persons in all) who live here: they wanted rice and we left some. They gave us Indian corn and some long beans.\n\nAt Kuala Temengor we saw Meh Suli\u2014one of the two missing cow elephants\u2014the property of the To' Muda of Kinta.\n\nWe left at 12.45, the Datoh and I travelling in one raft and Berkeley and Simmons following in another similarly re-constructed, while the cook and a party came in the third; we immediately entered the Jeram Panjang. It is beautiful and thrilling. On each side there is a continuous wall of rocks, mostly black with a few light-topped ones; in places the passage opens out into a semi-circle, but, speaking generally, it is not 50 feet wide.\n\nAs we entered, there was a fine outstanding boulder\u2014Berhala To' Sih Ulu\u2014on the left, and the Assistant Penghulu, Pah Mat Nor, threw an offering on to it, uttering these words:\n\n\"Nenek minta tabek kita na lalu: tolong hantar Tuan Besar dengan Datoh Sa'pele Bersiah jangan apa chachat chela.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branc\n\"Ah! Ancient one, I ask for your pardon, we wish to pass. Pray, send the Tuan Besar and the Datoh as far as Bersiah and let no misfortune befall them.\"\n\nPassers-by are supposed to offer something of whatever they have: no form of offering is laid down. As one of the men on the raft said: \"Tin ore or anything will do.\"\n\nThree men sat in the extreme bow of the raft with paddles which they dipped over its nose to guide it: two men stood behind them with poles to shove us off the rocks, as we were washed too close to them.\n\nThe Jeram Panjang Ulu (the long up-river rapid) is a succession of rapids within rocky walls: you emerge from one into still water and in a few moments enter another and so on. The first stretch takes 20 minutes to get through travelling very rapidly, and in three cases\u2014Punai, Trang and Goa\u2014rushing through waves, eddies and whirlpools. Punai wet us, at Trang we apparently sank and were swept across the rapid on to the rocks on our left. Saiyid Ali, the fiddler, leapt into the water. The three men with paddles were swept off their seat and swam towards us. The raft swung round to the rocks on the left, notwithstanding the herculean efforts of the two men with poles. The three paddlers helped by the Datoh sprang to the bow of the raft and pushed off from the rock. Saiyid Wahab held out his hand to me and said: \"You had better get off on to the rock.\" But I sat still, for it never occurred to me that the raft would not right itself and I was intensely interested. It all was over in a minute and we went on in the rushing water only to reach Goa. The word means a cave and there is said to be one deep-down. All we saw was a whirlpool and the rush of water sucked the raft to the left, but it was deftly turned off the rocks by the polers and we went on into smooth water after, as I have said, 20 minutes seething with excitement. In a few minutes we entered another rapid.\n\nMany years ago Messrs. Bozzolo and Lauder, while passing through this rapid, came on Goa when it was sucking (mengisap), as it does at a certain stage of the water. As the bow of the raft went under, they jumped on to the rocks but lost everything.\nWe were borne on in deep water where the poles could not find bottom and, where the rush of water was too great for the steersmen, on to a small rock\u2014we hit it\u2014jumped back and then the starboard steersman pushed us off it with his paddle. A little later, at 1.25, we heard Berkeley calling and saw him on a sandbank a quarter of a mile back. We poled into the bank and sent half a dozen men to see what had happened. Several of his lower tier of bamboos had been smashed: so we stayed where we were for the night. I found I had lost a pair of English shooting-boots.\n\nOn the 11th August, we started off at 7 a.m. Very fortunately it had rained heavily in the night: the river had risen from 18 inches to 2 feet and our journey was made much easier for us. At 8, just as we were about to shoot the jeram ringat, we saw the last of the missing cow elephants (Rana Kamuja) within a few feet of the right bank; we poled into the bank below the rapid and sent in two men to catch her. At 9.15 they came back to say she had bolted.\n\nThe Ringat river is pouring mining silt into the Perak, a fouling that must be speedily prevented.\n\nAt 10 a.m., we reached the head of Jeram Brusa. We stopped for ten minutes, while experts examined the state of the water. It was decided that we could go through the smaller channel. We started, and for over a quarter of an hour it was a great fight against a nasty, twisting, zigzag rush of water, full all the way of eddies and whirlpools. There is one rock in mid-stream which is very threatening, but the increased quantity of water helped us to avoid it. A little later the raft was sucked a foot under, but soon rose and, rounding the last bend, we rode into smooth water. But no sooner were we out of Brusa than we were into Breksa, not so long, not so fierce, but with one difficult cluster of rocks round which the water was sucking and plunging into the main passage. We went quite close to them, so close that as the water drove us off the tail of the raft touched them. The raft was half across the stream, but the paddlers dexterously straightened her.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nAt 11.20 we got down to Pulau Temin, a large island, and at 12.10 passed Bersiah. Soon afterwards we obtained a glorious view of Gunong Kendrong, 4,000 feet, and Gunong Krunei 3,200 feet\u2014two magnificent peaks. At 12.45 we passed Kampong Kota on the left and passed the mouth of the Rui river full of silt on our right. At 1.15, Berkuning, which used to be the residence of Mengkong Pah Haliah. At 1.40 we reached the Batu Mawa, where the monkeys made their treaty of peace. We arrived at Kuala Kendrong soon after 2 p.m., having been actually travelling for 6 hours 25 minutes from Kuala Temengor. This is said to be the fastest time in which the journey has ever been made.\n\nOn the 12th August, after breakfasting with Berkeley at Grit on venison, turtles' eggs and wild honey, I motored into Taiping, 87 miles.\n\nBelow is a list of some of the elephants we had with us. Their names are somewhat quaint\u2014\n\nChapang ... The solitary stag (according to Berkeley)\nBintang Timor ... Star in the East\nKulop Chandan ...

The girl of the sweet scent\nMy Visit to Klian Intan.\n\nBY E. W. BIRCH, C.M.G.\n\nThe tin mines of Intan and Endak were opened originally by a Perak Malay, \"Pawang Sering,\" son of the Chief of the Northern District, \"Toh Halang.\" The durian trees at Dusun Kalik were planted by him. After his death, the mines were a constant source of discord between his cousin, Toh Lamboh (who had then become Sri Adika Raja), and the Patani Chiefs, and a petty border warfare was the result. Sometimes one party got possession of the mines, and sometimes the other. The same sort of thing went on in the time of Toh Trosou, the next Sri Adika Raja. Then came the war with Kedah (1817-8) and the mines passed into Patani hands. Since then the Patani Malays have practically owned the country down to Bukit Naksa, and Berhala Bujok at the head of Jeram Panjang (long rapids). The Perak Chiefs and ryots have had to acquiesce tacitly in this arrangement, but they have always, when possible, asserted their right to the ancient boundary, though they have not always been able to enforce it. Many years have passed since the Intan and Endak mines paid a royalty to Perak, and since their produce was taken on elephants to Lubok Goloh and sent down to the Perak river. But the claims of Perak are not forgotten by the men of the Ulu, and this boundary question was one of the first points on which the assistance of the first British Resident was asked.\n\nThe first allusion to these mines, which I have found in any European author, occurs in Anderson's \"Considerations\" (p. 168), where he mentions a letter written by the Raja of Perak to the Raja of Kedah, in 1814, containing the following passage: \"The Patani people have attacked our country and taken possession of our tin mines.\" After this occurrence,\nconsiderable exertions seem to have been made by the Government of Penang to facilitate intercourse with Patani, and to encourage the export of tin with the view to benefiting the trade of their settlement. Among the objects of Mr. Crawford's mission to Siam in 1822 was an effort \"to open free intercourse with the tin mines of Patani, whence large supplies were offered to Colonel Bannerman (Governor of Penang), and where there is no doubt almost any quantity may be derived through the Marbow, Muda and Prye rivers.\" (Anderson's \"Considerations,\" p. 97).\n\nThe monthly produce of the mines seems to have been, prior to 1824, about 50 bharas (a bhara = 400 lbs.) from Kroh and 200 from Intan.\n\nAt the period of my visit the mines at Intan numbered about 40 persons, all being under the control of Panglima Chawang, who tells me that if the terms were easier he would have no difficulty in getting 1,000 men to work there.\n\nThere can be little doubt that, under proper management, and a Government which would give some security for life and property, these mines might be rendered very productive and remunerative. Whether the Patani Malays will ever see the wisdom of encouraging Chinese miners by the offer of better terms, it is impossible to say: the Perak claim, which has been dormant since the war between that State and Kedah in 1818, may perhaps some day receive consideration, and its recognition would probably be the best security for the future prosperity of the Intan tin industry.\n\nThe passages printed in italics are taken from the \"Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\" June 1882: they were written by the late Sir William E. Maxwell, K.C.M.G., after he made his journey on foot to the Patani frontier in 1876.\n\nIt is of especial interest now that, by the Treaty of March, 1909, between England and Siam, a British Protectorate has been established over Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and that portion of Patani called Reman (or Rahman) which has been so long in dispute.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nEver since the British Protectorate was set up in Perak in 1874, the claims of Perak to this territory have been periodically urged by various Administrators in the Straits Settlements and Perak, notably Sir Frederick Weld, Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham.\n\nIt is a great triumph that in the Consulship of Sir John Anderson, and during the reign of the enlightened Sultan of Perak, Sir Idris Mersid el A\u00e4zam Shah, G.C.M.G., it has been found possible to conclude the negotiations which have added to Perak a tract of country not less than one thousand square miles in extent, and a population of at least three thousand persons. The whole length of the beautiful Perak river, 260 miles from its source to its mouth, has now come into Perak territory.\n\nFrom the Sultan downwards amongst Perak Malays there is great satisfaction at the restoration of a country which they have always claimed and for which they have patiently waited.\n\nI have had occasion recently to visit the north-west corner of this territory on two occasions, travelling as far as Betong in Patani.\n\nMy first visit was to see how far it is possible to prevent the silt from the tin mines at Klian Intan and elsewhere from finding its way into and polluting the Perak river, and my second visit was to take over, by order of Sir John Anderson, the country restored to Perak under the Treaty between Great Britain and Siam.\n\nOn my first visit I was accompanied by R. O. N. Anderson and Hubert Berkeley. I started from Grit on Sunday, the 6th June, 1909. We walked 4\u00bd miles to Pahat, and then went on to Krunei on elephants. Krunei was once thickly peopled. There are fine open plains, and here was the fort of To Nong Patani, a remarkable lady, who was a friend of, and very hospitable to, Sir Hugh Low. On my second visit I appointed Ali bin Mehar, the Kemenan, to be our Penghulu, and under him are the villages of Pong (two), Pahit, Plang, Jong, Alei and Krunei. At Krunei, just as some of our party were crossing the Rui river, one Majid, a Patani Malay, ran\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\namuck (mengamok) and killed a follower of Berkeley's, named Lebei Awang, cutting at, and slightly wounding, two others. He then ran on to Jong and gave himself up at a wedding party, and was promptly secured and bound. Berkeley has since learned that he started out with the intention of killing him and me.\n\nHe had made up his mind to cut us down if he found us on foot alone, and if not to shoot us while the elephants were being unloaded in camp, when, of course, a rifle or two would be lying about. But at Krunei there was a short halt, and the voice of Haji Brahim, calling out, \"What are we waiting for?\" roused his maddened spirit to action.\n\nWe camped at a village called Jong, picturesquely situated, with the river on one side and rice fields behind, to bury Lebei Awang, and the next day sent the murderer back to Grit. He died that night immediately after his arrival. It was an awful night with ceaseless rain: the wedding chorus went on through the night intermittently, and, when it stopped, the murderer's shouts filled up the intervals.\n\nThe Rui flows through Jong and is quite as dirty and full of silt as the Kinta river at Ipoh.\n\nWe broke camp at 8 a.m. on the 7th June and rode on elephants till 5.30 p.m. with only a short halt for lunch: the going was bad, being through rocky broken country with some plains. On one of these we crossed the line of the hundred graves of the Perak Shahids (men killed in battle), who attacked Patani and were cut down by Mengkong Delaha in 1846.\n\nTheir graves are an interesting relic of the days when the Northern Perak Chief (the Dato' Sri Adika Raja) in an attempt to recover what he considered to belong to Perak\u2014viz., the mines at Klian Intan\u2014came into conflict with the Reman power.\n\nWe camped at Kuala Endak. The Endak brings down the silt from the Reman mines. It flows northwards and empties itself into the Sungei Kwa. The Kwa flows southwards and is clean as far as Kuala Endak. After that it is fouled, and in turn flows into and fouls the Rui.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nEarly on the morning of the 8th June we walked up the bed of the Endak for two miles to Rantau Panjang. The river is very badly fouled, and brings down stuff that ought never to be allowed to escape into any river. In places the Endak is very narrow with precipitous rocky sides, while elsewhere it widens out. It is a very easy river to dam, and three or four dry stone dams will, Anderson thinks, keep back the heavy silt, which would then fill up the wider portions of the river. But additionally heavy silt should be retained up above at each mine.\n\nAbove Rantau Panjang there are Chinese miners at Kota Bunyi.\n\nWe left Kuala Endak at 11 a.m. on the 8th June and rode on elephants to Lapang Nenering\u2014the scene, in 1845, of a battle between the men of Perak and Patani.\n\nThere we stopped in some beautiful wide plains for lunch, and found 48 Patani men, with 100 buffaloes, bound for Ipoh. We journeyed on, crossing the watershed, and at 4 p.m. camped at Berchang. On the 9th June we broke camp at 8 a.m. and reached Betong at 11.45 a.m. This is the headquarters of the Siamese District Officer or Amphur\u2014Wan Husein. He was hospitality itself to us. He gave us a roomy house all to ourselves, and we lunched and dined with him.\n\nAt his pressing invitation we spent the next day, the 10th June, at Betong and went out for a deer drive without success. Wan Husein's wife brought out lunch and an excellent curry, which we ate out of doors on the banks of the Kasinei river.\n\nOn the 11th June we left Betong for the mines at Klian Intan on elephants, Wan Husein accompanying us. We travelled along an earth road for 14 miles. At 11.30 we crossed the Simagaga Pass (watershed) into what is now Perak territory. We crossed and recrossed the Sungei Kwa and entered the Kroh plateau. This was the place chosen in anticipation in 1883 by Sir Hugh Low for an Upper Perak Station. It is about 1,500 feet above the sea\u2014is cool, and there are few mosquitoes. It has been extensively occupied in the past and carries a not inconsiderable population now; there is plenty of good water.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nMy own opinion is that the lowest pass from the Kroh plateau to the mines, and also the lowest pass from the Kroh plateau into Kedah, will be found to be at Padang Niring Todok. We then went on to Padang Berkwal, a mile or so further, and camped there. Dato' Mat Saleh, the Kemenan of Kroh, received us and had a long chat.\n\nOn my second visit I appointed him to be our Penghulu. Under him are the villages of Becha Deradap, Padang Berkwal, Kwa (three), Kroh and Klian Intan.\n\nUnder the Kemenan are \"Neban\" (local headmen), who are only appointed if there are ten families in a village. They have no very definite rights or duties, but are occasionally useful to the Penghulu or Government Officer when labour has to be procured for some special purpose. They have hitherto been responsible for the carrying out of \"forced labour.\"\n\nAt 8 a.m. on the 12th June we moved on, and at 12.40 reached the mines\u2014very bad broken hilly country. Mr. Kemp, of the Reman (or Rahman) Tin Mining Co., met us and put us all up. Mr. Kemp's mine is a revelation, and it is almost incredible that he has been able to convey so much machinery and set up so magnificent a mill in such an inaccessible place. There are 25 head of stamps on a hill, next door to Mr. Kemp's house. Water is brought by gravitation from the Kajang river from a hill behind. Firewood is brought from the valley below on an endless chain, railway trucks, full of water, pulling up the trucks of wood. The mine itself is a hill, 2,300 feet high, in front of the mill, but \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile away. An overhead wire rope\u20143,800 feet long\u2014carries 11 cages at one and the same time, brings the stone from the hill top to the mill, and takes empty cages back to be filled. The mine is technically known as a Stockwerk, and it is estimated that it will produce 10,000 pikuls of tin in the next twelve months. The property is 220 acres in extent.\n\nThe Rahman Hydraulic Mine\u2014Mr. Pearse, Manager\u2014has about 600 acres of land all round Mr. Kemp's hill top. The water for this proposition is brought in an open ditch for\n\nJour. Straits Branch\neight miles, but is hardly sufficient in quantity. There is a considerable area of land to be worked, and the output for the next twelve months is estimated at 4,000 pikuls. Tin and tin ore is exported via Becha Deradap to Baling in Kedah, where it is taken in boats down the Ketil and Muda rivers to Kuala Muda, and thence to Penang.\n\nThe village of Klian Intan is in a basin surrounded by hills. One of these was occupied by the Siamese Police Station, where there are an Inspector of Police and 20 Siamese Police.\n\nThe village has since my first visit been burned down for the third time. It was one of the filthiest I have ever seen, and is extraordinarily unhealthy. It is filled with Chinese, the riff-raff of Perak, and a taking of finger-prints would probably prove 50 per cent. of its native inhabitants to be criminals. I was told that it contained 140 shops.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the 13th June, we walked down, accompanied by Mr. Pearse, about two miles to his dam. On our return we walked up the hill where Mr. Kemp is working, and on which one of his mine Managers lives. It was a steep climb of over 1,100 feet, but we were rewarded on arrival at the top by a glorious view.\n\nIn the long distance westward was Kedah peak: below to the north lay the far-stretching Patani valleys: to the south were visible the Perak river and the towering mass of Kendrong (4,000 feet); while in the east one could see the Legeh and Kelantan hills. A view of practically the whole breadth of the Peninsula from the Gulf of Siam to the Straits of Malacca is commanded from this hill. It was a magnificent panorama on a beautiful clear morning.\n\nA delightfully cold bath and a capital midday meal were very acceptable after the hot walk to the dam, and after the steep climb in a burning sun.\n\nIn the evening I went with Wan Husein to inspect the Police Station in which he puts up when business takes him to the mines.\n\nEarly on the 14th June we started for Becha Deradap\u2014six miles. Anderson and I, walking on ahead, did the distance\nin exactly two hours, and on my second visit Jelf and I did it in the same time. The road is quite impossible in gradient, and rain makes the clay soil very slippery. It is pleasant to descend into the beautiful open plateau of Kroh.\n\nAt Becha Deradap, corrupted by the mines' people into Cheradap, Mr. Kemp and Mr. Pearse each have a store, and the Siamese have an Inspector of Mines, a Customs House, and a Hospital which has never been used. It was erected by the munificence of certain persons as a memorial of the Siamese Administration, and it is an excellent building of squared timber with a shingle roof.\n\nThere are a few shops and a considerable peasant population planting padi. The road from Betong through the Kroh plateau ends here. Near by is the charming natural lake at Tasik, a curious phenomenon of which is that it is periodically half emptied by what appears to be a natural siphon in the shape of a deep hole some distance from the main lake, the water re-appearing about two miles away.\n\nThis lake occupies about 25 acres of ground when fairly full. It is one of the very few natural lakes in Malaya. It is most picturesque, and at one end of it is a very ancient and quaint Buddhist temple, which ought to be repaired in old style and preserved. We camped by the lake that night.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 15th June, we broke camp at 8.30 and Anderson and I walked on ahead, 5\u00bd miles in 1\u00be hours, into Baling, a Kedah Station, where Che Mat Deli, the Malay Magistrate, entertained us. Baling is one of the most beautifully-situated places I have ever seen. It is on the banks of a big river (the Ketil), and just across the river, rising perpendicularly, is an immense limestone rock as like as possible to Gunong Pondok at Padang Rengas, only more covered by vegetation. Mr. Kemp and Mr. Pearse each have a comfortable house at Baling on the river bank, and all their tin is shipped there in boats for Penang. The little town was decorated in our honour with flags and Che Mat Deli turned out a guard and the whole population. A fine new Police Station and Barracks have been built by the Kedah\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nGovernment. Che Mat Deli gave us dinner, and after dinner we witnessed a capital Ma'yong (theatrical performance).\n\nChe Mat Deli provided me with a comfortable Government boat and gave me a Kedah Sergeant and constable as escort. We left at 7.45 a.m. on the 16th June down river, Wan Husein still with us. We reached Kuala Kupang at 10.15 a.m. There is a village here, and one of the Kedah Rajas is in charge (Tungku Eda), but he had gone to Kedah on account of the death of his father, the famous Tungku dia Udin. Che Mat Deli left us to return to Baling, and we went on downstream. We tied up for the night at a place called Padang Pulai. All this part of Kedah, as far as the eye can see and right down to Kuala Muda, consists of flat plains, and they would carry an immense population if irrigated.\n\nWe continued our journey at 5.35 a.m. on the 17th June. At 7.15 we reached Kuala Ketil and entered the Muda river, a magnificent sheet of water navigable up to this point by launches of 40 tons. I landed and visited the Police Station, where the Kedah Government keeps a Sergeant and six men, because the people were a thieving lot and used to rob stores while being taken out of big boats, which bring them up the Muda river, to be loaded into smaller boats, which take them up the Ketil river to Baling. From Baling goods are humped by coolies, 11\u00bd miles to the mines, a climb of 850 feet. Owing to this expensive transport, every pikul of stuff used at the mines costs $8 more than its market price in Penang.\n\nThe Ketil river is one of the most winding I have come across, the turns and bends often come right back on each other. It is swift running and is full of snags. It takes six nights to go up from Kuala Ketil to Baling, and when the river is high it may take ten or eleven nights.\n\nA perfectly flat road can undoubtedly be made on the proper left bank of the Muda river, to cross the Hetil river about a mile below Kuala Kupang to a point about 1\u00bd or 2 miles above Baling. It would then climb over one pass into Padang Niring Todok and over another pass behind that place into Sungei Buloh (the site of Mr. Pearse's dam), and thence into\nKlian Intan. The distance, I reckon, would be about 28 miles. There may, of course, be a better route from Baling to the mines. At 9 a.m. on the 17th June we left Kuala Ketil and went on down the Muda. The river is clean until you get to the Kuala Seding and Kuala Karangan. We got to these rivers at 11.20 a.m. They are within 50 yards of each other; the former, the bigger on the two, comes down quite clean, and the latter is very badly fouled, presumably from the Kulim mines.\n\nAt 12.15 we stopped for lunch at a settlement called Alor Madu. It is a very old Siamese Settlement, and there were several priests there. They have quite a nice Waht or temple, and were very civil to us. At 3.20 p.m. we passed the pillar, which marks the boundary between Province Wellesley and Kedah, on the left bank of the Muda. We stopped for tea and a nice bath in the river below the Province Police Station of Pinang Tunggal and soon afterwards came in sight of Penang. The afternoon was so beautiful that it beggars my powers of description. Kedah peak and the small hills were bathed in the light of a lovely sunset and it did not get really dark till past 7 p.m. We reached Kuala Muda at 8 and were housed in a capacious and well-built Rest-house, where we were the guests at dinner of Inche Mat, the District Officer.\n\nOn the early morning of the 18th I went round the town of Kuala Muda with Inche Mat and the Malay Inspector of Police. A guard of honour was turned out and I visited every public office, the hospital and Inche Mat\u2019s house. The Kedah Administration has established itself on good lines at Kuala Muda. The country beyond the town is in need of roads.\n\nInche Mat took us across the river at 8.30 a.m. and saw us into my motor car in Province Wellesley, whence, after thanking and saying good-bye to him, we motored to Taiping\u201471 miles. The whole distance travelled was about 300 miles. We had rain the first night at Jong, rain in the night, one night at Klian Intan, and a sharp Sumatra in the afternoon at Baling. The rest of the fortnight was fine, and for the most part the weather was cool.\nThe taking over from Siam of Part of Reman or Rahman.\n\nBy E. W. Birch, C.M.G.\n\nIn the account of my visit to the Klian Intan Mines I stated that my second visit was made by order of Sir John Anderson, G.C.M.G., the High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States, to take over under the Anglo-Siamese Treaty that portion of Reman or Rahman which is now restored to the State of Perak.\n\nI was accompanied by Hubert Berkeley, the long-time District Officer of Upper Perak, whose intimate acquaintance with almost everything animate and inanimate in those parts made our journey very easy; by A. S. Jelf, of the Perak Secretariat, who was of much use to me and from whose writings I have freely quoted; by the Orang Kaya Mentri, one of the Four Great Chiefs of Perak, and by the Orang Kaya Kaya Sri Adika Raja, one of the Eight Chiefs and the hereditary Chieftain of the north of Perak.\n\nWe took with us ten Indian Police to station at Klian Intan and six Malay Police to station at Tasik. Inspector Simpson went with us to place them in their stations. We had 26 elephants and a large following.\n\nWe left Grit on the 14th of July, 1909, and, by travelling all day along the Kendrong river, we managed to reach Dusun Pahit at a quarter to seven in the evening.\n\nThe next day we broke camp at 7 a.m. and reached the Rui river at 10.45. Fording the river twice we arrived at the\nvillage of Kampong Pahit, a picturesque little place, with fertile bendang (padi fields) and healthy coconuts. It contains about 40 people, who work the padi fields with their own buffaloes.\n\nHere, as at all the villages through which we passed, a Proclamation announcing the transfer from Siamese Suzerainty to British Protection of this portion of Reman was first read aloud and then handed to the head of the village.\n\nWe then moved on, reaching an hour later a small village called Kepayang, inhabited entirely by Siamese, where we halted for half an hour for lunch.\n\nTravelling on, we ascended an almost interminable valley, that of the Sungei Kepayang, where the going was exceedingly heavy for the elephants, up to a place called Ulu Kali, and then across some very mountainous country via a pass known locally as Dusun Pawang, finally arriving at Klian Intan at 6 o'clock in the evening, the whole party, including the elephants, rather wearied after two days' journey of ten and eleven hours, respectively. We were most hospitably entertained here by Mr. J. D. Kemp, Manager of the Rahman Tin Co.\n\nThere seems to be some doubt as to the name of this populous mining locality. In the story of my first visit to it I have quoted at length from Sir William Maxwell, who called it and wrote of it as Klian Intan.\n\nBerkeley, whose local knowledge must have much weight, is of opinion that the name is Klian Hitam (Black Mine), but that, owing to the admitted inability of the Petani Malay to pronounce the letter \"m,\" the latter of the two words has become Hitan (or Itan). He is supported in this view by Wan Husein, the Ampur of Betong, who has just handed over the district.\n\nOn the other hand, the Datoh Sri Adika Raja, whose ancestors lived and fought in and about the mines and had hereditary rights therein, states that the name was Klian Intan (Diamond Mine), the belief in former days being that diamonds were to be, or would be, found there. It is said to be a common practice among Northern Malays to drop the\n\"n\" before \"t,\" which might account for the form \"Itan.\" (Curiously enough, M. de Morgan, the eminent French Geographer, who, in 1884, came out to Perak at the request of Sir Hugh Low and made a very accurate map of the Perak valley, does not refer to the place). The two European Mining Companies speak of it and write of it as Klian Intan, and I am inclined to adopt the view of the Sri Adika Raja.\n\nI had arranged, through Berkeley, with the Ampur of Betong, Wan Husein, to meet me at Klian Intan.\n\nI did so because that is by far the most important place in the new Territory, carrying the largest population of mixed nationalities with a not inconsiderable Siamese Police Force.\n\nAt 10 a.m. on the 16th July it was rumoured that Wan Husein had arrived. Berkeley went up to the Police Station to call on him. After some conversation they came together to Mr. Kemp's house and I went down with the Dato Sri Adika Raja to meet them. It was evident from the cordial greeting that the Ampur gave me that he was anxious to play his part in a friendly manner, and Berkeley assured me that nothing could be more satisfactory than the arrangements Wan Husein had made. He detailed them to me, and I, of course, agreed to fall in with them to the letter.\n\nAt 1.45 p.m. the Siamese Police under their Inspector and the Perak Indian Police under Inspector Simpson were drawn up in front of the Police Station on the hill, on opposite sides of the small square where the flagstaff stands on which the Siamese flag was flying. I went up with a large following of Europeans at 2 p.m., the time appointed. Wan Husein came down the hill in uniform to meet us. As he and I reached the top of the hill both detachments of Police presented arms. He took the Perak salute and I that of the Siamese Police. We then stood on the station side of the square, with our backs to the building, and Wan Husein advancing to the flagstaff made a speech in Malay to the following effect:\n\nHe had received a letter from Prince Damrong, informing him that a friendly Treaty had been made between the\nKing of England and the King of Siam by which the Siamese surrendered to England's protection all those countries divided by a watershed, which he shortly described, thus\u2014the valleys of all rivers flowing into the Gulf of Siam remained Siamese territory and the valleys of all rivers flowing into the sea on the other side became the territory of England. He was only concerned about the valleys of the Petani and the Perak rivers. What now became Perak territory was not very different from the old boundaries of Perak. The territory which he was there to hand over to the Resident of Perak and to his old friend Mr. Berkeley comprised a population of 2,624, of whom 1,295 were Malays and others, 975 Chinese, 346 Siamese and 8 Europeans. There were 423 buffaloes, 441 cattle and 5 elephants, and 148 guns of different sorts. He said there were certain buildings, and he ended the enumeration of these properties by giving a humorous list of the furniture in the Police Station. He pointed out the uses to which the three tables were put, and emphasised the fact that though there were only four chairs they were large enough to accommodate eight persons. Resuming the serious and dignified way in which he had spoken, he said that all the people handed over had been under his care, and he hoped that the Resident would treat Mr. Kemp, Mr. Pearse, the Europeans working under them, the Siamese, the Malays, the Chinese, the Indians and the foreign Malays as if they were his own children.\n\nHe had invited subscriptions and had received the following sums:\n\n| Name            | Amount |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Mr. Kemp        | $200   |\n| Mr. Pearse      | 200    |\n| Wan Husein      | 230    |\n| Raja Prempuan   | 150    |\n| Ah Poh          | 50     |\n| Toh Chawan      | 20     |\n\nTotal ... $850\n\nin order to establish at Becha Deradap a hospital for the sick.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe building was finished, the Resident of Perak had seen it, but it had not so far been put to the use for which it was intended. He begged that now that it was taken over it would be dedicated to that use as a memorial of Siamese Suzerainty in this district and of his administrations.\n\nWan Husein then proceeded to haul down the Siamese flag, and both detachments of Police presented arms and remained at the present until he had done so.\n\nSpeaking in Malay, I stated that I had received orders from His Excellency the Governor to announce that His Majesty the King was graciously pleased to extend protection to part of Reman over which the King of Siam had ceded his rights, and that all Judges, Magistrates and other officers of the Federated Malay States or Perak would have the same power and jurisdiction therein as if they were in Perak. I added that Mr. Berkeley was appointed District Officer in this new territory, that \"Kuasas\" would be given to Penghulus and others under him, and that no revenue would be collected by any one except with the orders of the Resident of Perak. I said that in this world there were many things certain and uncertain, but that there was one thing quite certain and that was that where the British flag was flying, even justice, irrespective of nationality, would be done to everyone. I thanked Wan Husein for the help he had given to Mr. Berkeley in the past, and promised him that effect would be given to his wishes about the hospital and that everyone who proved that rights had been given to him by the Government of Siam would have his rights respected by the Government of Perak.\n\nThe Perak flag was hoisted by the Tungku Mentri and the Dato Sri Adika Raja, and was saluted.\n\nGuards were changed, and an Indian sentry marched up into the station and took possession. Wan Husein and I shook hands, and after he had taken some photographs the ceremony ended.\n\nThe population of the district thus taken over was carefully numbered by Wan Husein at the end of the Siamese year\u2014about six months ago\u2014with the following result:\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 54, 1909.\nHe estimates the Malays at 1,295, of whom 771 are males and 524 females; the Siamese at 346 (204 males and 142 females); and the Chinese at 975, of whom all but 44 are men; the Europeans number 8, all men\u2014a total of 2,624.\n\nWe may accept his statement as to the Malays, Siamese and Europeans, but there is no doubt at all that the Chinese element has largely increased since this informal census. Mr. Kemp, Manager of the Rahman Tin Co., and Mr. Pearse, of the Rahman Hydraulic Tin Mining Co., were good enough to supply me with the latest figures from their check-rolls, which gave a total of 750 and 432, respectively. I think that the total Chinese population may safely be put at 1,500, and the population of the district, by consequence, as not less than 3,300.\n\nThere was a great deal to be done at Klian Intan. The town had been burned down and 2,000 people were homeless living in temporary bamboo shanties. I had to deal with the situation at once.\n\nThe cart-road to the mines from the Muda river, if made, must enter this valley. There can, therefore, be no more suitable place to build the new town. The higher ground, above Mr. Kemp\u2019s dump, is semi-circular in shape. I arranged for the construction of 100 chains of road. The Kajang stream will run through the new town and a bridge will be built over it. I received 192 applications for shop lots along and above this circular road. So that there should be no show of favouritism the lots were drawn for. Two houses are to be built together, and then a space of 20 feet is to be left between them and the next two shops. The shops are to be 20 ft. x 66-ft. They are to be of a permanent type, squared timber, plank walls, single roof.\n\nA good water supply can be given to the town by pipes from the intake higher up the Kajang river.\n\nMr. Kemp will light both the old and new towns with four or five electric lights from his mill.\n\nWe left Klian Intan on Sunday, the 18th July, and journeying via Becha Deradap, the Kroh plateau and\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nSamagaga Pass, the route taken on my first visit, we reached Betong at 1 p.m., on Monday, the 19th.\n\nOn the 20th Mr. Berkeley and the Ampur settled the new Perak boundary in accordance with instructions, the great local knowledge of these officers rendering the task one of no great difficulty. A copy of this settlement is appended to this account.\n\nOn the 21st of July we left Betong early, and travelling via Lapang Nenering, the Kwa river, Plang, Krai, Jong, Krunei and Pahat, a route which I have previously described, we reached Grit at midday on the 23rd July.\n\nBy this journey, which occupied altogether ten days, of which seven were spent in travelling by elephant, we made a complete circuit of the great mountain of Kendrong, 4,000 feet high, which stands up so prominently over Grit.\n\nThe distance from Grit to Klian Intan by the way we went is 22 miles. That route will be abandoned except for the first portion of nine miles which takes you to the halting bungalow at Ulu Kendrong. At that point there is a turn-off to Asu and Pong, two villages inhabited by Siamese on the Kedah border.\n\nThe proper route from Grit to Klian Intan is that which passes Krunei and Jong: a thorough examination of the country for a good rideable bridle-path is being made.\nBOUNDARY AS SETTLED AT BETONG ON 20TH JULY, 1909, BY MR. H. BERKELEY, DISTRICT OFFICER, UPPER PERAK, AND LUANG RAJ BHARAKII (WAN HUSEIN), AMPUR OF BETONG, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BOUNDARY PROTOCOL ATTACHED TO THE ANGLO-SIAMESE TREATY, 1909.\n\nCOPY.\n\nIn accordance with instructions received from the High Commissioner, Federated Malay States, No. G.H. 34, dated 9th July, 1909, and Prince Damrong, No. 1-7006, dated 25th Mehtu Nayun 128. We are agreed that the Boundary described in the Boundary Protocol, annexed to the Treaty, dated 10th March, 1909, or 10 Minakun 127; is as follows:\n\nFrom Gunong Lang in a south-easterly direction along Bukit Peringgan, forming the Watershed between the Kapas and Sama Gaga rivers, to Bukit Berapit on the cart-road; thence along the same ridge, here known as Dan Petai, to the pass between Sungei Agam and Sungei Tualang; thence it continues along the same ridge, dividing the streams flowing into the Kwa and Berchang rivers, which ridge curves gradually to the north-east, and divides the rivers flowing into the Lanka Suka and Panei rivers, to Berapit Bukit Bertam, between the Chinaha and Bunga rivers; thence along the same ridge, here known as Dan Titi Basa, dividing the rivers flowing into the Perak and Halar rivers, to Berapit Bukit Langsat between the Kijar and Halar rivers; thence along the same ridge, here known as Dan Bukit Keting, to Berapit Luar Lantei between the Meroh and Klesyi rivers; thence along the same ridge, which here curves to the south and divides the rivers falling into the Perak and Telubin rivers, to Berapit Kaho between the Kaho and Timun rivers; thence along the same ridge to Berapit Panchor between the Panchor and Gua Mas rivers;\nand thence along the same ridge to a spot which divides the streams flowing into the Tado and Perak rivers.\n\n[Here follows the Siamese version of the above.]\n\nWe have compared the English and Siamese versions and believe them to be identical. We each retain one copy.\n\n[Siamese version of above.]\n\n(Signed) H. BERKELEY.\n(Signed) LUANG RAJ BHARAKII.\n\nBETONG, 20th July, 1909\n\nTrue Copy:\nA. S. JELF.\n28-7-09.\nShort Notes.\n\n\"Haji Ka-Ta-Na-Ka-La.\"\n\nIn No. 52 of this Journal, p. 107, Mr. W. George Maxwell, referring to the biographical account of the Mongol general Shih-pi* in Book 162 of the History of the Y\u00fcan Dynasty, hazards the guess that \"Haji Ka-ta-na-ka-la\" (as that work has it) stands for Haji Kadir Nakhoda.\n\nThis is ingenious, but wrong. Groeneveldt's translation of the passage where the name occurs suffices to upset Mr. Maxwell's suggestion. It reads: \"At that time Java carried on an old feud with the neighbouring country, Kalang, and the king of Java, Haji Ka-ta-na-ka-la, had already been killed by the prince of Kalang, called Haji Kalang. The son-in-law of the former, Tuhan Pijaya, had attacked Haji Katang, but could not overcome him,\" etc.\n\nFrom this it clearly appears that \"Haji Ka-ta-na-ka-la\" was a ruling prince, not a ship's captain who had made the pilgrimage to Mecca. And in the year 1292 the ruling princes of Java were not yet Muhammadan, but Buddhist and Hindu, both in their religion and their styles and titles. As a matter of fact \"Haji\" here represents the old Javanese word haji, \"king,\" \u2020 and has nothing whatever to do with the Malay-Arabic word for \"a man who has performed the pilgrimage.\" \"Haji Ka-ta-na-ka-la\" was the Cri Kertanagara mentioned on p. 142 of No. 53 of this Journal as the last ruling prince of Tumapel. He was dethroned by his neighbour Jaya Katong of Daha (otherwise Gelang) and his son-in-law Raden\n\n* Not \"Shih-pi's account of Java,\" as Mr. Maxwell has it.\n\n\u2020 It is found also in literary Malay (presumably merely as a loan-word from Javanese literature): see Wilkinson's Dictionary, s. v. aji. I. The ruling prince of Berunai in the time of Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca is in the Sejarah Melayu styled \"Sang Aji Berunai.\" That would be somewhere about A.D. 1460. Possibly Berunai at that time still acknowledged the supremacy of Majapahit (see this Journal No. 5, p. 1), but at any rate the title is clearly adopted from the Javanese and may perhaps be an indication that in A.D. 1460 or thereabouts the Berunai dynasty had not yet been converted to Islam.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nWijaya eventually became his virtual successor in the newly founded capital of Majapahit. The Chinese and Javanese accounts tally completely as regards all these personal names and they are further confirmed by contemporary inscriptions. So they may safely be accepted as quite certain.\n\nO. Blagden.\n\nA Termite's Nest with Eight Queens.\n\nIn the nests of *Termes malayanus* there is usually to be found a large clay queen cell in the centre which contains one queen with a greatly swollen abdomen, accompanied by a single male. The occurrence of two queens in one cell is not very rare and on one occasion while digging out a nest with Dr. Haviland, in the Economic-Gardens, we found a queen-cell containing six queens and as many males. The males had it appeared been fighting together and had their legs and antenn\u00e6 mutilated. This number of queens was the highest record for a nest, till a few days ago (Dec. 14) a nest was dug up in the Botanic Gardens containing no less than eight queens. The queens were rather smaller than usual, perhaps young, and all were in one unusually large clay cell. This number must be I think an unique one, and hardly likely to be exceeded.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nAn Insectivorous Hornbill.\n\nDuring a recent trip to Mt. Penrissen in Upper Sarawak, Mr. H. B. Creeker of the Sarawak Government Service shot a fine male example of *Rhytidocerous undulatus*, Shaw. On opening its stomach I was much surprised to find two large green Cetoniid beetles evidently eaten quite recently. The Cetoniid proves to be *Chalcothea planiuscula*, Bates, which is\n\nR. A. Soc No. 54, 1909.\nfairly common on the higher slopes of Penrissen, although apparently found nowhere else in Sarawak.\n\nAs I believe the Hornbills are generally supposed to be fruit-eaters only, perhaps this note may be of some interest. I notice that Mr. W. T. Blanford in the Funa of British India series, Birds Vol. III, refers to instances of insects eaten by *Dichoceros bicornis*, L. but not by other Hornbills.\n\nJ. C.
