It celebrated its Centenary in January 1905. Of the several ways in which it was sought to celebrate the Centenary, one was to issue a \"Centenary Memorial Volume.\" On 15th October 1903, the Committee of Management asked Mr. Khurshedji Rustomji Cama and myself to prepare a part of the volume dealing with Parsee subjects. Mr. Cama kindly left the work to myself, and this book is the result of that work.\n\nOn 17th January 1905, the opening day of the Centenary celebrations, a summary of this paper was read at the rooms of the Society in the Town Hall under the title of \"A glimpse into the work of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society during the last 100 years from a Parsee point of view.\" To draw the attention of a larger number of persons particularly interested in the subject, a great part of the paper was read before the \"Jarthoshti Din ni Khol-karn\u00e2ri Mandli\" (The Society for inquiring into Zoroastrian Studies) at its meetings held on 27th August, 2nd and 24th September, 1st, 8th, 22nd and 29th October, and 19th November 1904. The Meeting of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 17th of January 1905, and all the above-mentioned eight meetings of the above mandli were presided over by Mr. K. R. Cama, the guide, friend and philosopher of students interested in Iranian subjects in Bombay.\n\nIt is with great pleasure that I dedicate this work to the Editor and Staff of the \"J\u00e2m-e-Jamshed\" of Bombay. The subjects of some of my papers before the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and of several of my lectures and papers before other Societies, were suggested to me while preparing my contributions for this well-known Parsee Journal. For example,\nthe subject of my very first paper (The River Karun) before the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; and that of my paper before the Asiatic Society of Paris (L'Etymologie Populaire des noms des etapes entre Pichaver et Kaboul)\u2014both of which are published in my Asiatic Papers,\u2014were handled by me, at first, for short contributions for that paper. The preliminary cursory study for these short contributions, has, at many a time, led me to further study, and has suggested to me many a subject for my papers and lectures. I hope, one day, to collect, in a book form, all my contributions to its columns. I look with pride and pleasure at my connection with this Journal as its contributor for these last eighteen years. At the end of this pretty long period, I can say, with a clear conscience, that, at no time during this connection, have I taken any undue advantage of the hospitality of its columns. I have written on purely literary subjects and on such other subjects as have fallen within the sphere of my reading and study. I have never held my pen to offend others. While expressing my hearty thanks to Mr. Jehangier Byramjee Murzban, the present Editor, who has, by his praiseworthy journalistic enterprise, raised his paper to the rank of a widely-circulated, influential and well-conducted paper, and while expressing my thanks to his staff for the hospitality of its columns extended to me, I cannot but remember the names of two of the past members of the staff, the late Mr. K\u00e2vasji Merw\u00e2nji Shroff, its former Editor, and the late Mr. Ardeshir Byramji Patel, its former Sub-Editor. I remember with gratitude the name of the former, who, about 21 years ago, pleased with my very first lecture on a Parsee subject at the Framji Cowasji Institute, there and then purchased its copyright for his paper and thus extended to me a helping hand of encouragement.\n\nI conclude by offering my best thanks to my friend, Mr. Bomanji Nusserwanji Dh\u00e2bhar, M.A., for kindly preparing for me an excellent Index for this work and for my \"Asiatic Papers.\"\n\nJIVANJI JAMSHEDJI MODI.\n\nM\u00e2h\u00e2bleshwar,\n26th May, 1905.

From 1821 to 1841 we had no journal, as the Bombay Branch sent all the papers, submitted to it, to the principal Society in London, to be published in its journal. From 1841, it started again a journal of its own, and up to now, 21 volumes have been published. In this paper, I refer to the different papers and notes, presented to the Society, under the head of each volume of the journal.\n\nThe Parsees owe a debt of gratitude to this Society, for having done something, though not much, in the matter of exciting some interest among its learned members in the matter of their history, religion and literature. In 1812, i.e., about eight years after the founding of this Society, John Malcolm, afterwards Sir John Malcolm, the future historian\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Under the name of journals, I include the three volumes of the original Society, \"The Literary Society of Bombay,\" published under the title of \"The Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay.\" The references in this paper to the volumes of these Transactions are to the second edition, published in 1877, and edited by the late Mr. Vishwanath Narayen Mandlik, one of the then honorary secretaries.\nof Persia and the Governor of Bombay (1829-30), in his speech, while proposing a motion that the founder of the Society, Sir James Mackintosh, be requested to sit for a bust, said, that \"a complete account of the Guebers or Parsees\" was then \"still a desideratum.\" Though that desideratum has not been supplied as a whole by the Society, yet, it has indirectly done, and has provided some materials to do, something in that line; whereby others outside the Society have done something more.\n\nI, personally, am very greatly indebted to the Society, especially to its excellent library\u2014excellent in its treasures of old books. Were it not for these, I would not have been able to play even half my humble part, as I have done, in the literary line. I look back with pleasure to the hours I have spent in the rooms of this Society, in the company of some of its members, while reading my papers or hearing those of others; and I look back with greater pleasure to the days and months and years that I have passed at home, in the company of its precious treasures.\n\nI will divide my subject into three parts\u2014\n\nI. The first part will treat of those papers, that are on Ir\u00e2anian or Parsee subjects, properly so called,\n\nII. The second part will treat of those papers that refer indirectly or incidentally to Ir\u00e2anian subjects.\n\nIII. The third part will present a glimpse of the Proceedings of the Society, from a Parsee point of view.\n\nI\n\nWith these few preliminary remarks, I will come to the subject of my paper, and speak, at first, of the different papers on Parsee subjects, in the order, in which they have been published in the Journals.\n\nTransactions, L. S., B., Vol. I, pp. 129-49. Read, 30th March 1812.\n\nBabylon has played an important part in the history of Ancient Persia.\n\n\"It is the Bawri (\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a) of the Avesta (Yt. V. (\u00c2b\u00e2n) 29), B\u00e2birush of the Cuneiform Inscriptions (Behistun I, par. 6, Journal, Royal A. Society, Vol. X, Part III (1847), p. 197), B\u00e2wir (\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a) of the Pahlavi treatise of Shatr\u00f4\u00eeh\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n (s. 24); and Babel (\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0644) of the Persian authors.\n\nThe ruins of Babylon, referred to by Capt. Frederick and by other travellers, are the ruins of the city of the times of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors. As Rev. Sayce says, \"The Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar and his father, Nabopolassar, must have suffered when taken by Cyrus; but two sieges in the reign of Darius Hystaspes, and one in the reign of Xerxes, brought about the destruction of the defences, while the\n\n1 Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay, I, p. 157.\n2 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Vol. III, p. 182.\nmonotheistic rule of Persia allowed the temples to fall into decay. Alexander found the great temple of Bel a shapeless ruin, and the rise of Seleucia in its neighbourhood drew away its population and completed its material decay. The buildings became a quarry, first for Seleucia and then for Ctesiphon, Al Modain, Baghdad, Kufa, Kerbelah, Hillah and other towns, and our only cause for wonder is, that the remains of the great capital of Babylonia are still so extensive.\n\nIt is of these remains, that Capt. Frederick speaks, in his paper. He makes at first, a \"few general observations relative to the position and ancient state of Babylon.\" He then states the result of his \"own researches during a stay of six days at Hillah,\" which he had \"dedicated to the examination of these ruins\" and concludes \"with a few general observations upon the whole.\"\n\nMajor Rennel and others had visited these ruins before Capt. Frederick. Major Rennel describes them at some length in his \"Geographical System of Herodotus.\" Kinneir had visited them in 1808, i.e., about four years before the date of our author's visit. But he published his account in 1813, in his \"Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire,\" dedicated to Sir John Malcolm. Therein, he refers often to the account of Capt. Frederick.\n\nIn his general observations, relating to the position and ancient state of Babylon, Capt. Frederick follows Herodotus (Bk. I, Clio, 178\u2014200), who, however, says nothing about its founder. It is said to have been founded by Belus, and embellished by Semiramis, the warlike queen of the East, and afterwards to have been particularly repaired, enlarged, and beautified by Nebuchadnezzar. Now this Belus or Bel of Babylonia is identified with the Nimrod of the Christian Bible. According to Malcolm, Nimrod is identified by some with the Zoh\u00e2k of the Sh\u00e2hnameh, the Azidah\u00e2k of the Avesta. This identification receives some support from several Iranian books.\n\nFirstly, the Avesta (Yt. 5, (Ab\u00e2n) 29) connects this Zoh\u00e2k or Azidah\u00e2ka with Bawri or Babylon, just as Nimrod, who is identified with Bel or Belus, is connected with Babylon.\n\nSecondly, the Pahlavi Dinkard also connects Zoh\u00e2k with Babylon, when it says: \"One marvel is several matters of evil deceit which Dah\u00e2k (Zoh\u00e2k) had done in B\u00e2pel (Babel or Babylon) through witchcraft.\"\n\n1 Transactions, L.S., B., I, pp. 129-31. 2 Ibid., p. 132. 3 Transactions, L.S., B., I, pp. 132-142. 4 Ibid., p. 132. 5 Ibid., pp. 142-148. 6 Ed. of 1800, pp. 335-388. 7 \"A Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire,\" by John MacDonald Kinneir (1813), pp. 269-282. 8 Transactions, L.S., B., I, p. 130. 9 Vide Sir H. Rawlinson's article (Essay X) in Rawlinson's Herodotus (1858) I, p. 596. According to Kinneir there is a pyramid among the ruins of Babylon, which the Arabs call \"Nimrood.\" Kinneir's Persian Empire (1813), p. 275. 10 Malcolm's History of Persia, Vol. I, p. 12 (Ed. of 1829). 11 S. B. E. XLVII, Dinkard, p. 67. Bk. VII, ch. IV, 72.\nThirdly, the Pahlavi treatise of Shatr\u00f4ih\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n also connects Zoh\u00e2k with Babylon, though indirectly and without naming him. It says:\n\n\"The city of B\u00e2wir (Babylon) was founded in the reign of Jam (shed). He (i.e., the founder of the city) fixed there (the direction of) the planet Mercury. (By the situation of the city or its building) he pointed out magically the seven planets, the twelve constellations and signs of the Zodiac, and the eighth part (of the heavens) towards the sun and other planets.\" The founder, alluded to in this para., is said to have built the city in the time of Jamshed. Now Zoh\u00e2k was a contemporary of Jamshed. So, it is he, who is alluded to here. The allusion to the building of the city, pointing to the seven planets, &c., seems to refer to the tower of Babylon, referred to by Herodotus, which is believed to have been built with an eye to astronomical calculations.\n\nAmong other Oriental writers, Ma\u00e7oudi attributes the foundation of Babylon to Nimrod. Ebn Haukal also attributes the foundation of Babylon to Zoh\u00e2k. He says: \"They say that Babel was founded by Zohak Piurasp.\" Edrisi also says the same thing. He says: \"La plus antique ville de l' Ir\u00e2c (c.a.d. Babil) . . . fut b\u00e2tie par Zohak.\"\n\nAgain, just as there is some similarity, between the names of the founder and the city founded by him, in the case of Bel and Babylon; so there is a similarity in the case of Zoh\u00e2k and B\u00e2wri or B\u00e2wir, the Avesta or the Pahlavi name of Babylon. One of the names of Zoh\u00e2k is Ba\u00eavarasp, of which the Piurasp of Ebn Haukal, above referred to, is a corruption. So Ba\u00eavarasp, the Pahlavi name of the founder, resembles a good deal, B\u00e2wri and Bawir, the Avesta and the Pahlavi names of the city.\n\nNow, the ruins of Babylon, which Capt. Frederick describes in this paper, and which Rennel, whom he quotes in his paper, had described before him, are known as the ruins of Hillah or Hilleh. Hillah is a modern town, and as Kinneir says, \"it covers a very small portion of the space occupied by the ancient capital of Assyria.\" The Pahlavi treatise of Shatr\u00f4ih\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n or \"The cities of Iran,\" calls it Hirleh and says, that it was founded by Narsi of the Ashkanians.\n\nAccording to Kinneir, \"we learn from St. Jerome that the space within the walls was converted by the Parthian kings into a royal hunting park.\" This statement of St. Jerome, then, is supported by the Pahlavi treatise.\n\n1 Vide my Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eeran, Shatroih\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n and Afidiya va Sahigiya-i-Sist\u00e2n, p. 75.\n2 Ma\u00e7oudi par Barbier de Meynard, I. p. 78.\n3 Ousley's Oriental Geography of Ebn Haukal, p. 70.\n4 G\u00e9ographie d'Edrisi, traduite par Jaubert, II., pp. 160-161.\n5 Kinneir's Persian Empire, p. 269.\n6 Vide my Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eeran, p. 73.

My attention was drawn to this paper, in 1888, when an urn, or rather a box, similar, though not of the same kind, was sent to the Anthropological Society of Bombay, by Mr. Joseph Malcolm of Bushire, through Mr. C. J. Michael of Bombay. I had made an inquiry at the time, and had found, that the urns, referred to by Mr. Erskine, did not exist in the Museum of our Society. The urn, presented to the Anthropological Society of Bombay, has passed into the hands of our Society, when that Society transferred, in 1896, its place of work, and with that, its museum, to the rooms of our Society.\n\nErskine refers to several classical authors, who speak of the custom of the disposal of the dead among the ancient Persians, and concludes, that these urns were the receptacles of the bones of some ancient Persians. He says: \"From these quotations, it seems evident that the Persians in very remote times did not universally follow the mode of sepulture now in use by their descendants, the followers of Zert\u00fbsh\u00ee; but that, after the birds or dogs had torn part of their bodies, the remains were wrapped up and consigned to the earth.\" He then concludes by saying: \"I am of opinion that the urns in question contained the bones of Persians, whose bodies were deposited in them while the usages described by Herodotus and the commentator on the Des\u00e2t\u00ear were in force, before the whole of Persia was reduced to a strict observance of the religion of Zert\u00fbsh\u00ee. In such inquiries, however, there is always considerable uncertainty, particularly when the inquiry relates to a country in which there were so many obscure heresies as there appear to have been in Persia at various eras of its history.\"\n\nI would refer my readers to a paper by me on the same subject, entitled \"A Persian coffin (Astod\u00e2n) said to be 3,000 years old, sent to the Museum of the Anthropological Society of Bombay by Mr. Malcolm of Bushire,\" read before the Anthropological Society of Bombay. I have referred there to Mr. Erskine's paper, and treated the subject at some length, on the authority of the Avesta and Pahlavi books. The custom, which led to the construction of these urns, is thus referred to there: \"The custom, as described in the Vendidad, was this, that the body of a dead person was exposed on the top of a hill to the full rays of the sun and to birds of prey. The birds ate away the flesh, but the bones\n\n---\n\n1 Transaction, L. S., B., I, p. 210.\n2 Ibid., p. 212. Such urns were also found at Bussorah and elsewhere. Vide Journal of the Anthropological Society, Vol. I, No. 1, p. 12. Vide, in the Babylonian and Oriental Record of 1890, Dr. Casartelli's article entitled \"Astodans, and the Avestic funeral prescriptions.\"\n3 Journa. of the Anthropol. Soc. of Bom., Vol. I, No. 7, pp. 426-441, read 29th August 1888.\nwere preserved uninjured by fastening the dead body. After a certain time, probably a year, the bones, which had by this time become perfectly dry and free from any impurity that could be a source of danger to the health of the living, were collected and placed in a receptacle, specially prepared for the purpose, of stone, mortar or clay, or in case of extreme poverty, of coarse cloth. This receptacle was known as an Ast\u00f4d\u00e2n (\u0622\u0633\u062a\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646) lit: \"a keeper of bones\" from \u0633\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646 L. os., Fr. os., Pers. \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646 bone and \u062f\u0627\u0646 to keep ) i.e., an ossuary.\"\n\nI happened to see, when in Paris in 1889, some similar urns in the Dieulafoy Collection at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. Those urns formed the subject of a paper, which I read at the Institute of Paris, before \"L'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres\" at its meeting of 30th October 1889, under the title of \"Quelques Observations sur les Ossuaires rapport\u00e9s de Perse par M. Dieulafoy et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.\"\n\nAlmost all the European translators of the Avesta, except Dr. Geiger, have not properly understood the passages of the Vendidad (Ch. VI, 49\u201451), where we see an enjoinderment for the preservation of the bones. The discovery of these urns has thrown good light upon these passages. Our Bombay scholars have correctly understood the passages. Mr. K. R. Cama, in his articles in his Jartoshti Abhy\u00e2s, on a similar subject, entitled \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0622\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647 and \u0622\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647, has clearly referred to the custom of Astodans.\n\nTransactions, L. S., B., II, pp. 63\u2014108. Read 30th September 1817.\n\nLooking to the time, when it was written, this paper presents an excellent bird's-eye view of the Persian literature. The editor of the second edition of the Transactions said of it in 1877; \"Even now persons desirous of obtaining a general view of Persian literature may peruse it with profit.\" The latest best book on the subject, which treats of Persian literature up to the time of Firdousi, which one can read with great profit, and which treats the subject very exhaustively, is \"A Literary History of Persia, from the earliest times until Firdawsi,\" by Mr. Edward G. Browne (1902).\n\n1 Ibid, p. 424. 2 Vide the Report of the Academy of \"S\u00e9ance, du 30 Octobre 1889.\"\n3 I remember having discussed these passages, at some length, with the late Prof. Darmesteter at Paris in 1889, when writing there; the above paper for the Acad\u00e9mie. This learned translator has changed, since then, in the second edition of his Vendidad (S. B. E. IV), his translation of the above passages.\n4 No. III, pp. 128\u2014142.

The first volume is very interesting from a Parsee point of view, as it treats of the ancient literature of the country. He calls it \"the Prolegomena,\" while the second volume will be, as he says, \"The History of Persian Literature within the strict meaning of the term.\" (Preface p. IX.)\n\nAs the author of our paper says: \"Few subjects have occasioned a greater variety of opinions than the real merits of Persian literature.\" Looking to the circumstances of public and private life in a country, ruled by despotic rulers, he considers the literary productions of the country to be tolerably good. He says: \"In a country, then, where virtue has been banished from public and private life, where even its semblance is not required, and where the softer feelings are unknown, few can be the noble actions which deserve to be recorded in the pages of the historian, and few the themes which can inspire the strains of the poet.\"\n\nCapt. Kennedy divides Persian Prose Literature into four parts\u20141 Historical, 2 Theological including Jurisprudence, 3 Philosophical, and 4 Didactic.\n\nAs to the first division, he says, that there are many causes \"which must have prevented the composition, in Persia, of any work which could in every respect deserve the name of History.\" Bigotry, despotism, want of thorough education and such other causes make the histories of the Persians mere annals. Unity is wanting from their historical works, because \"from the battle of Nehavend in A.D. 641, to the conquest of Khorasan by Shah Ismail Sefi in A.D. 1510, the whole of Persia was never united under the government of one sovereign.\" In attempting, then, to describe these rapid revolutions resulting from such a state of affairs \"no abilities could enable an author to give his subject that unity which is the greatest beauty of history.\"\n\nAs the best historical works, most esteemed in Persia, our author names 1 the T\u00e2rikh-i-Tabari of Muhammad ben Jurair ul Tabari (A.D. 838-923), 2 the Tarikh Guzideh (1329 A.D.) of Hamdalla Mustufi, 3 the Rouzet-us Safa of Mirkhond (died A.D. 1497), and 4 the Habib-us Seir (A.D. 1527) of Ghaias-ud-deen ben Muhammad Amir Khawend (Mirkhond).\n\nAs to the second class of prose works, viz., the theological, Capt. Kennedy refers his readers to the Dissertation and Notes of Sale's Koran and to the Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale.\n\n1 Transactions, L.S., B., II, p. 63. 2 Ibid, p. 65. 3 Ibid, p. 66. 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid.\n\n\"Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale ou Dictionnaire Universel, contenant tout ce qui fait connaitre les peuples de l'orient,\" par M. D'Herbelot.\nOf the third class of works, vis., the philosophical, he says, that they are mostly translations of Greek writers, and agrees with M. Langl\u00e8s' opinion, expressed in his edition of Chardin's \"Voyage en Perse\" that, in translation, the originals have undergone a great change. However, \"the Persians in all their argumentative writings display great clearness and acuteness of judgment, and express themselves with the greatest conciseness and perspicuity.\"\n\nAs to the last class of works, vis., the didactic, our author thinks, that, with all their faults, they \"breathe, in general, the noblest and purest sentiments; and their application is illustrated and enforced by the most pleasing and apposite tales.\"\n\nThen, coming to poetry, he describes the three kinds of Persian poetry, 1 the Gazal, 2 the Kasideh, and 3 the Masnavi, and then gives the names of the poets who have made their names in their respective lines.\n\nKennedy then says: \"If quantity were excellence, the Persians would be the best poets in the universe; for they are all naturally addicted to poetry; and in the Atishkedah are enumerated upwards of seven hundred poets, commencing from Rudeki, who died A.D. 1013, and whose verses alone are said to amount to six hundred thousand couplets. But it is to be regretted that, as the rules of criticism and the delicacy of correct taste have never been studied in Persia, the improvement has not equalled the cultivation of its poetry.\"\n\nI would here draw the attention of my readers to Professor Darmesteter's views on \"The origin of poetry.\" It gives a succinct history of its origin and rise.\n\nFrom the fact, that we have no Pahlavi poem extant, a question has been asked, at times, whether poetry was composed in Persia before Islamism. Kennedy gives the following anecdote, related by Doulut Shah, the author of the \"Lives of the Poets,\" to show that it was composed before Islamism. Kennedy says:\n\n\"From the following circumstance, it will also be known that poetry was composed in Persia before Islamism. One day when Amir Abdulla Taher, the Governor of Khorasan under the Abbassieh Kaliphs, was giving audience, a person laid before him a book, as a rare and valuable present. He asked, 'What book is this?' The man replied, 'It is the story of Wamek and Ozara, a singular and wonderful tale, which was composed by learned men on account of Anushirwan who was\n\n1 Trans., L.S., B., II., p. 79.\n2 Ibid., pp. 79-80.\n3 Ibid., p. 83.\n4 \"The Origin of Persian Poetry,\" translated from the French of Prof. J. Darmesteter by Nasarw\u00e2ni Fr\u00e2mi Tamboli, 1888.\n5 He was the first king of the Taberide Dynasty. He was the son of Taher and a general of Khalif Mamoun, the son of Haroun Al-Raschid and the last of the Khalifs.\n6 Chosroes I.\nrenowned and celebrated in every country for his equity and justice.' The Amir observed: 'We are the readers of the holy Koran, and we read nothing except that sacred volume and the traditions of the prophet, and such accounts as relate to him, and we have therefore no use for these kind of books. They are, besides, the composition of infidels and the productions of worshippers of fire and are therefore to be rejected and contemned by us.' He then ordered the book to be thrown into the water, and issued his command that whatever books could be found in the kingdom which were the composition of the infidels of Persia, should be immediately burnt.\"\n\nThe book, referred to in the anecdote, was a book of poetry in Pahlavi.\n\nTradition carries the origin of Persian poetry of the Sassanians, to times even older than that of Noshirw\u00e2n. It attributes to Behram Gour (Behram V.) and his mistress Dil-\u00c2r\u00e2m, the composition of poetry to express their mutual love.\" But, going to times earlier than the Sassanians, we have \"the famous G\u00e2thas of the Zend Avesta, rhythmical sermons which breathe irreproachable morals and which offer all the poetic interest of a catechism.\"\n\nComparing the European divisions of poetry with the Persian divisions, Kennedy, at first, startles us by saying, that, \"according to the most received rules of criticism, no epic poem has ever been produced in Persia,\" and then, with some hesitation, considers the first two volumes of the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh of Firdousi \"as strictly epic.\"\n\nOn this point, I would refer my readers to M. Mohl's excellent preface to his \"Livre des Rois,\" for his views on the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh as an epic.\n\nTransactions, L. S., B., II, pp. 115\u2014162. 31st March 1818.\n\nEven after a lapse of 87 years, this paper presents a very interesting reading, if not for any new facts, at least for the eloquence, with which it pleads for the cause of Persian writers on the history of Persia, and for the words of caution, which it utters, for those, who may be disposed to take the statement of Greek writers as gospel truth in the matter of Persian history. Capt. Kennedy is of opinion, that Greek writers,\u2014and among them Herodotus, also,\u2014were led away, to a certain extent, by their love of their country, by their patriotism, which made them\n\n1 Transactions, L. S., B., II, p. 77.\n2 \"The Origin of Persian Poetry,\" translated from the French of Prof. Darmesteter by Mr. N. F. Tamboli (1888), p. 4.\n3 Ibid, p. 1. 4 Ibid. 5 Transactions, L. S., B., II., p. 105. 6 Ibid.\ngive an exaggerated view of Greek victories and Persian defeats. Again; their statements about the manners and customs of the people were based, not so much on personal knowledge, as on second-hand information.\n\nOn the first point, referred to here by Capt. Kennedy, I may draw the attention of my readers to the excellent work of a Parsee author, Mr. Pallonjee Burjorjee Desai, on the history of the Achemenian kings. Therein, the author tries to point out, how Greek accounts are exaggerated to a certain extent. As to the second point, referred to by Captain Kennedy, it is true, that the information acquired by Herodotus is second-hand. So, evidently, there are some mistakes here and there. But, still, a large number of statements are corroborated by other native sources. I would refer my readers to my work in Gujarati, entitled \"The Ancient Persians; according to Herodotus and Strabo.\" Therein, I have tried to show, how far the picture of the ancient Persians, as presented by Herodotus and Strabo, agrees with, or differs from that presented by the Avesta.\n\nSir William Jones, the learned and ever-to-be remembered founder of the Bengal Asiatic Society, \"the prince and the pioneer of the British Orientalists\" in India, as Dr. Wilson called him, and others, had tried to compare the Achemenian kings, mentioned by Herodotus and others, with the Ki\u00e2anian kings, mentioned by Firdousi, Tabari and others.\n\nCapt. Kennedy says, that the kings of the Peshd\u00e2dian dynasty, beginning with Kaiumars and ending with Gusht\u00e2sp, as described by Firdousi and others, were the same, as the kings of the Medes, beginning with Arbakes and ending with Kuaxares, as described by Ctesias, Herodotus and Xenophon, but that the Ki\u00e2anian kings of the Persian writers, were not the same, as the Persian kings of the Greek writers, as asserted by Sir William Jones, who said: \"For I shall then only doubt that the Khosrou of Ferdusi was the Cyrus of the first Greek historian, and the hero of the oldest political and moral romance, when I doubt that Louis Quatorze and Lewis the Fourteenth were one and the same French king.\" Some of those, who supported Sir W. Jones, said, \"that (in the Shah-namah) we find events, which occurred on the banks of the Euphrates, often transferred to those of the Oxus\" and that \"taking this view of the life of Kaikhosrou, we may pronounce that the transfer of a scene from the court of Ecbatana to that of the capital of Afrasiab, and the substitution of the latter king for the sovereign of Media, are liberties which it was natural for the poet to take.\"\n\n1 Journal, B. B., R. A. Society, IV, p. 289.\n2 Transactions, L. S., B., II, p. 120.\n3 Ibid., p. 129.\n4 Ibid.\nSubsequent researches of scholars have shown, that both Capt. Kennedy and Sir W. Jones were wrong, in their respective identifications\u2014a partial identification by Kennedy and a complete one by Sir W. Jones\u2014of the Persian kings of Firdousi with the Median and Persian kings of the Greek authors. They have also shown, that Firdousi has taken no liberty, such as that attributed to him by Sir W. Jones and his school, vis., that of transferring events from the banks of the Euphrates to those of the Oxus, and of substituting Afrasi\u00e2b for the sovereign of Media. The study of the Avesta has shown, that Firdousi has taken no liberty\u2014neither for the field of action nor for the names of the actors\u2014but has faithfully followed older authorities. Again, the Pahlavi treatises of the K\u00e2rn\u00e2meh-i-Ardeshir B\u00e2beg\u00e2n and of the Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e2n, show, that Firdousi had authentic materials for his work.\n\nI will quote here, what I have said on the subject, in the preface to my \"Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e2n, &c.\"\n\n\"In the introduction to his Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh Firdousi says:\u2014'The narrative has been already described. Nothing worth mentioning has been left unsaid. I will narrate what has been already narrated. What I narrate, has been completely narrated. All have travelled over the garden of knowledge. . . . There was a book of ancient times, which contained many episodes. It was scattered in the hands of different Mobads. Every learned man had a fragment of it with him. There was a Pehelw\u00e2n of the family of the Dehk\u00e2ns. He was brave, noble, wise, and generous. He was fond of collecting materials for the history of ancient times. So, he called aged Mobads from all parts of the country and collected the historical work. . . . These great men narrated before him the accounts of the kings and of the events of the world. When that great man heard from them the narratives, he laid on them the foundation of a great book. Thus (the work) became a memoir (Y\u00e2dg\u00e2r)' in the world, and the high and the low praised him.' What Firdousi meant to say in this passage was this: That he had historical materials to work upon for his great work, that he had several memoirs to dwell upon for his great book. This is more than illustrated by the Ay\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e2n, which is one of the Pahlavi memoirs (Y\u00e2dg\u00e2r) referred to by him. We find, that in his Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh, not only materials and thoughts, but even words in some places are borrowed from the Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e2n.\"\n\nFirdousi and other Persian historians have been ably defended by Capt. Kennedy in this article. M. Mohl, the French editor and translator of the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh, has subsequently more ably defended Firdousi\nin his learned preface to his \"Livre des Rois.\" His further studies have enabled him, to add the following, in his preface to the fourth volume:\n\n\"Plus on \u00e9tudiera l'\u0153uvre de Firdousi, plus on se convaincra, je crois, qu'il n'a rien invent\u00e9, et qu'il s'est content\u00e9 de rev\u00eatir de son brillant coloris les traditions qui formaient l'histoire populaire de la Perse.\" (M. Mohl, IV. Pr\u00e9face, p. ii.)\n\nNow, Capt. Kennedy, in his attempt to defend the authenticity of native Persian writers against Greek writers, touches the question of the ostracism of the Achemenian kings from the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh of Firdousi in another way. He ridicules the attempt of Sir W. Jones and others, who in their turn have followed an ancient writer, like Ammianus Marcellinus, to identify the Ki\u00e2nian kings like Kaikhosru and Gusht\u00e2sp with the Achemenian kings like Cyrus\u00b9 and Darius Hystaspes. But then, how to account for the omission of even the names of these Achemenian kings from the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh of Firdousi? He says, that these kings were simply Persian generals in Asia Minor, who invaded Egypt, Greece and Scythia, and that they were intentionally exalted to the dignity of kings by the Greek authors. He says:\n\n\"The only events indeed which are described, and which can be considered of importance sufficient to have rendered them generally remembered, are the invasions of Egypt by Cambysis; of Scythia by Darius, and of Greece by Xerxes; for it must be always recollected that such transactions as occurred in Asia Minor, and which are so minutely dwelt upon by Grecian writers, could never have been subjects of the slightest interest to the Persian people. The proper kingdom of Persia was situated to the east of the Euphrates, and appears from every account to have most materially differed in customs, manners, and religion from all the petty nations that were situated to the west of that river. In process of time, these nations, as well as Egypt, were conquered, and became dependencies of the Persian Empire; but they still remained entirely distinct in population, manners, and religion. No intermixture seems ever to have taken place between them and the Persians, and even the intercourse between the two peoples seems not at any time to have been frequent. These dependencies might, therefore, form honourable and desirable governments for the Persian nobles and for their immediate officers; but the transactions which occurred in them were not likely to attract the general attention of the Persian nation, and thus to become the theme of history, or the subject of a popular tale.\n\n\u00b9 Prof. Eug\u00e8ne Wilhelm's paper, entitled \"La Patrie et L'Origine de Cyrus (1889),\" is worth reading, as it suggests new thoughts about the country of Cyrus.\n\"To these obvious reasons I think it must be attributed, that no particulars of the Persian victories to the west of the Euphrates have been preserved in the remaining fragments of Persian History; but that the Persian Empire extended over Asia Minor, Egypt, and even part of Africa and Europe, is affirmed in general terms by many a native writer. It is therefore evident, that as the Grecian historians are almost entirely occupied in detailing events which did not affect or interest the whole of the Persian people, and which were consequently omitted or overlooked by their historians, no similarity can be expected to exist in accounts that proceed on such different principles.\"\u00b9\n\n\"It may, then, be conjectured that these invasions were never led by a Persian king in person; and that even the invading armies were merely composed of troops levied in the dependent States; and that but a very small part of them on any occasion ever consisted of Persian soldiers. . . . The celebrated invasion of Xerxes may therefore have been only an expedition similar to that of Dates and Artaphanes, but in much greater numbers, and not improbably reinforced by troops detached from Persia Proper, and the whole commanded by some chief of such rank and importance as to induce the Greeks to honour him with the name of king.\"\u00b2\n\nWell, Capt. Kennedy wrote all this, at a time, when the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis and elsewhere had not seen the full blaze of the daylight of researches. Grotesend had just begun the work. These inscriptions show, that Xerxes and Darius Hystaspes were not mere Persian generals exalted to the dignity of kings, but were real kings of kings (khsh\u0101yatha khsh\u0101ya\u1e6dhiy\u0101n\u0101m. Behistun I\u20141) who had conquered a great part of the then civilized world.\n\nI may here draw the attention of my readers to an article on a similar subject, in the K. R. Cama Memorial Volume, entitled \"The Ostracism of the Achemenides from the Pahlavi works and the Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh\" by Mr. Pallonjee Burjorjee Desai.\u00b3 The author, in his interesting article, attributes the omission to nothing else than the \"ignorance of later writers.\" This subject is still one of those in the history of Persia, which are not satisfactorily settled. I am, however, inclined to think, that the Acheminides referred to by the classical authors and by the inscriptions, and the Ki\u0101nians, referred to by Firdousi, were contemporary dynasties, the former ruling in the west of Persia, and the latter in the east in Bactria.\n\n\u00b9 Transactions, L. S., B., II, pp. 136-37. \u00b2 Ibid, p. 140.\n\u00b3 \"The K. R. Cama Memorial Volume,\" edited by me (1900 A. D.), pp. 27-39.\nAs to Capt. Kennedy's views, that the Greeks exaggerated facts to an undue extent, there is no doubt. A visit to the classical battlefield of Marathon, even now, about 2,400 years after the battle, would show to an intelligent person, that, there is somewhat of an exaggeration and one-sided view, even in the history of a writer like Herodotus. I had the pleasure of paying a visit to this classical battlefield, on 22nd November 1889, and when there, with the help of an intelligent guide and with the help of what I had read, I soon found, that, in order to give a little colour to the fame of his own countrymen, Herodotus had not mentioned all the facts which would go in favour of the Persians.\n\nAs to the question of the chronology itself of ancient Persian history, I think, that what the late Mr. Vishvanath Narayen Mandlik wrote in 1876 as the editor of the second edition of the journal, is still true, that \"this part of Persian history is now just as uncertain as in Col. Vans Kennedy's time.\"\n\nTransactions; L. S., B., II, pp. 180-204. 30th June 1818.\n\nAs the Editor of the second edition of this volume says, \"this article is valuable as showing with what difficulties scholars had to contend at the time it was written, and how much they were in the dark even in the manner of reading, not to say understanding the meaning of characters, the decipherment of which had then just been attempted.\" Various scholars have, since the above was written, visited the spots of the inscriptions, and have added to, and well nigh perfected, the reading and the understanding of the inscriptions. There are still some words, here and there, about the reading of which, there is a difference of opinion and doubt. The latest among the visitors of the Behistun rock inscriptions is Prof. Jackson of the Columbia College of New York, who visited the rock in April 1903. He has described his visit in a paper in the journal of the American Oriental Society. A good deal of new light on some doubtful points in the inscriptions is expected from Prof. Jackson's further studies on the subject.\n\nThe discovery and the decipherment of these Iranian cuneiform inscriptions, have thrown a good deal of light upon the history of the Achemenian kings of Persia, whose account of Herodotus, was, here\n\n---\n\n1 For my impressions of the battlefield of Marathon, vide my \u0936\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u093f\u0936\u094b\u0930\u0940 (Lectures before the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge, 1898), pp. 274-82.\n2 Transactions, L.

For example, in the very volume of our journal, which contains this article of Bellino, we find Capt. Kennedy doubting, in his article above referred to, most of what Herodotus says. As the latest instance of how the cuneiform inscriptions throw some fresh light upon some of the statements of Herodotus, we find the discovery of the Persepolitan column known as the \"Column of Chalouf.\" Herodotus said, that King Darius had completed the canal, which connected the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, and which was, some time ago, dug by Necho. Now, this statement was doubted by some. But the discovery of the above column, about 40 years ago, has shown, that Herodotus was in the right. It has been found, that the canal of Darius ran well nigh parallel to the modern Suez Canal for half its way. Rawlinson has given a short inscription of Darius found on a stone discovered at Suez. But since that time, well nigh the whole column has been discovered and the inscription on it deciphered. I would refer my readers to an excellent treatise on the subject, entitled \"La St\u00e8le de Chalouf\" by M. Joachim Menant, who is mentioned in the editor's note attached to Mr. Bellino's article in the second edition.\n\nTransactions, L. S., B., II, pp. 312-361. 27th April 1819.\n\nThe author of this paper divides his subject into four parts\u2014\n\nI. The Ancient Languages of Persia.\nII. Comparative credibility of the Greek and Persian historians.\nIII. The tenets of the modern Zoroastrians.\nIV. The antiquity of their particular doctrines and observances.\n\nThe author's remarks on the first part of his subject, viz., \"The Ancient Languages of Persia\" are not of much value. On the origin of the Zend language he says: \"It is altogether Sanskrit. The Zend was either the Suraseni, or some other cultivated dialect of the Sanscrit, or that it was an Indian dialect spoken by some nation or tribe of Hindu origin, to the east or north-east of Persia, and adopted, perhaps in its natural state, but more probably with some changes, as the sacred language of the country.\" On the subject of its antiquity he says: \"We cannot fairly give the Zend writings a higher antiquity than the age of the Sas\u00e2nis.\"\n\n1 Transactions II, p. 115.

S., B., II, pp. 316. 6 Ibid, p. 317. 7 Ibid, p. 320.\nNow, all these views of Erskine have been proved to be incorrect. He had not sufficient materials to form correct views. As he himself says, the knowledge, which scholars then \"possessed of the ancient languages of Persia\", was \"very limited.\" The only materials, on which he seems to have founded his views, were the Ferheng-i-Jehangiri, Hyde's Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum Religionis Historia, Anquetil's Zend Avesta, Sir W. Jones's Asiatic Researches and some memoirs of Anquetil before the Academy of Inscriptions at Paris. So, the conclusions he came to, on these scanty materials, were faulty.\n\nAs Prof. MaxM\u00fcller says, \"Rask was the first, who, with the materials collected by Du Perron and himself, analysed the language of the Avesta scientifically. He proved\u2014\n\n1. That Zend was not a corrupted Sanskrit, as supposed by W. Erskine, but that it differed from it as Greek, Latin or Lithuanian differed from one another and from Sanskrit.\n\n2. That the modern Persian was really derived from Zend as Italian was from Latin; and\n\n3. That the Avesta, or the works of Zoroaster, must have been reduced to writing at least previously to Alexander's conquest. The opinion that Zend was an artificial language (an opinion held by men of great eminence in Oriental Philology, beginning with Sir W. Jones) is passed over by Rask as not deserving of refutation.\"\n\nIt appears from a memoir of his literary life, read by the late Dr. Wilson, before our Society, on 15th July 1852, under the title of \"Brief Memorial of the Literary Researches of the late William Erskine, Esq.\" that Erskine was \"ultimately led to change\" his views, on perceiving the philological researches of Bopp, Burnouf, Lassen, and others.\n\nIn the second part of his subject, Erskine says: \"very ingenious attempts have been indeed made to place the authority of the Oriental historians above that of the writers of Greece and Rome.\" Here, he seems to take up cudgels against the views, expressed before the Society, in a previous year, by Capt. Vans Kennedy, though he does not name him. Capt. Kennedy attached a great deal of importance, in point of veracity, to Persian authors like Tabari,\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid, p. 313.\n2 MaxM\u00fcller's Chips from a German Workshop (2nd ed. 1880), Vol. I, pp. 81-82.\n3 Journal, B.

Vide above pp. 171-76.\nFirdousi and others, and doubted the veracity of Greek authors like Herodotus, Xenophon and others. Mr. Erskine, on the other hand, runs down the Persian and supports the Greek historians. We have said above\u00b9 that Capt. Kennedy had, to a certain extent, overshot the mark, the reason being, that he had not before him the Achemenian Inscriptions, which were then just being deciphered. The same is the case with Mr. Erskine, who overshoots the mark, in fighting for the classical writers and in running down authors like Firdousi, the reason being, that he had not before him, all the Pahlavi literature, the semi-historical portion of which, has supplied sufficient proofs for the authenticity of the materials, upon which Firdousi had worked. As to the Avesta itself, it is true, that he had Anquetil\u2019s translation before him, but sufficient time had not elapsed since its publication, to have sufficient light thrown upon the historical references in it.\n\nNobody is more entitled to speak on the subject of Firdousi with great authority than M. Mohl, the famous French editor and translator of the Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2meh, and we have quoted above (p. 174) his views of the question. Even making allowances for the fact, that editors and translators are, at times, a little partial to the merits of their authors, we find, that there is sufficient of, what we should call, \u201coutside evidence\u201d\u2014evidence based on the Avesta and Pahlavi books\u2014to show, that Firdousi had kept his poetic imagination in due restraint and had rested upon authentic materials.\n\nIn the third part of his subject, viz., the tenets of the modern Zoroastrians, Erskine gives a picture of the religious and social life of the Parsees. This picture is faulty in several points. We will briefly allude here to some of his incorrect statements.\n\n1. He says: \u201cTheir reverence for the elements makes them careful in no manner to defile them. No impurity is allowed to be thrown into the fire or the water. None of them are smiths, though prevented by no positive injunction; they never extinguish any light, nor do they enlist as sepoys, pretending that they dare not defile fire by the use of fire-arms. In the great fire in Bombay in 1803, they stood for a long time idle, witnessing the progress of the flames; but when they found them continuing to spread, to the ruin of their houses and property, their interest got the better of their scruples, and many of them wrought with great alacrity both in procuring water and in helping to extinguish the fire.\u201d\u00b2\n\nNow, we have strong reasons to say, that this picture is far from correct. It was on the 13th of November 1902, that Mr. Goudinho,\n\n\u00b9 Vide above p. 175.\n\u00b2 Transactions, L. S., B., II, pp. 349-50.\nwhom I had the pleasure of introducing to this Society, read a paper before it, entitled \"Portuguese Documents of the 17th and 18th Centuries relating to Parsees.\" The paper has, unfortunately not been published in our journal, on the ground, as alleged at the meeting, where it was read and where I was present, that the paper was not original, and contained merely a translation of several old Portuguese documents. I beg to submit, that the Portuguese documents are of some historical importance, not only from a Parsee point of view, but from the point of view of the war, then raging, between the Portuguese and the Marathas; and so, they ought to have been printed in the journal of the Society, for a future reference for some historical facts. However, the Portuguese text of these documents has been published in the local Portuguese paper, Anglo-Lucitano.\u00b9 These Portuguese documents show, that the Parsees had no scruples to serve as soldiers, on account of the veneration, in which they held fire. They had served, not only as soldiers, under the Portuguese in the years 1738 and 1739, but had also offered their services as volunteers to their Portuguese rulers. They had raised a special company of their own as volunteers, and two of them were made ensign and captain. While serving thus as soldiers, they did use fire-arms.\n\n2. Again, as to Erskine's allegation, that they hesitated to extinguish the great fire of 1803 until the time when their own houses and property were in danger, we find from Khan Bahadur Bomanjee Byramjee Patel's Parsee Prak\u00e2sh,\u00b2 that about 200 houses of the Parsees were actually burned at the time. Mr. Patel gives a long list of the Parsees whose houses were burned. So, it is not possible to believe that a large number of Parsee homeowners actually waited and watched and allowed their properties to be burned.\n\nThe Desatir, which Mr. Erskine himself had translated from the text of Mulla Feroze, in 1818, i.e., one year before he read this paper, clearly permits the extinction of fires by water.\n\nIt says: \"Reverence the four elements, yet do not therefore lay thyself under constraint.\n\nCommentary . . . . . . Although fire is the great illuminator . . . . . . in cases of necessity, you may extinguish it, but it must be with water.\"\n\n\u00b9 Vide its issues of 13th and 27th December 1902 and 3rd, 10th and 24th January 1903.\n\u00b2 Vol. I., p. 882.\n\u00b3 The Desatir or Sacred Writings of the Ancient Persian Prophets, by Mulla Firuz bin Kaus (1818), Vol. II., pp. 67-68. The Book of Shet, the Prophet of Yas\u00e2n (\"Va hamchunin ba g\u00e4h-i-n\u00e2ch\u00e2ri \u00far\u00e2 b\u00e2yad faru nish\u00e2nd\"), The Gujarati Desatir of 1848, p. 129, Mr. P\u00e2lonjee H\u00e2taria's edition of 1887, p. 93.\nI wonder, how, in spite of this injunction, in a book, which he himself had translated, Mr. Erskine says in the present paper, that the Parsees did not extinguish fires by water.\n\n3. Take another instance of Mr. Erskine's picture. He says: \"The dead body is dressed in clean but old clothes, and conveyed to the place of exposure on an iron bier; for wood being the aliment of fire, it might, if wooden, be accidentally burned, and so the element of fire defiled.\" Now, the fact, as stated by Erskine is correct, but the reason given is imaginary. The Parsees do not use wood in their biers, in the construction of their towers, and in anything, with which the dead bodies are likely to come into contact, because, wood being porous, it is likely that it may at times contain germs of disease and so may spread infection.\n\n4. Take another statement of Mr. Erskine, which has misguided many a careless writer about the Parsees. He says: \"They watch the corpse, to see on which eye the vulture first seizes: if on the right eye, it is a fortunate sign.\" Any ordinary visitor at the towers, if he were to look at a funeral, would say, that this statement is all imaginary, because nobody, not even the closest relations or friends, are allowed to go into the towers. So, how can they watch the alleged thing?\n\n5. Again he says: \"They place meat and drink near the body for three days, as during that time the soul is supposed to hover around in hopes of being re-united to it.\" Now, as a matter of fact, the body is never kept in the house for more than one day. Then, how can meat and drink be placed before it? The statement is all imaginary. What is done, is simply this, that for at least three days, the place in the house, where the corpse was placed for several hours, before being removed to the towers, is set apart, and the living do not pass over the spot for that time. That injunction is given from a sanitary point of view, that, if there be germs of disease hovering there, the living may not catch infection. The only thing placed there, is a few flowers, and a lamp is kept burning there.\n\n6. Again there is another misstatement of Erskine. He says: \"The bearers are tied to each other by a piece of tape, to deter, as they allege, by their union the wicked demons who hover round the body from defiling them.\" As many must have observed in Bombay, the bearers are not tied to each other, but they simply hold a tape between them. The mourners, who follow the corpse, walking in pairs, similarly hold a handkerchief between them. This is as a mark and symbol of sympathy\n\n1 Transactions, L.S.B., II., p. 350. 2 Ibid., p. 351. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid., p. 350-47.\nand mutual help. I would refer my readers, who want to understand the signification of the funeral ceremonies of the Parsees, to my paper entitled \"The Funeral Ceremonies of the Parsees, their Origin and Explanation,\" read before the Anthropological Society of Bombay and published in its Journal (Vol. II, No. 7, pp. 405-440).\n\nComing to the last part of Mr. Erskine's paper, viz., \"The Antiquity of the Religious Opinions of the Parsees,\" Trans. II., p. 355), we find, that in the early part of his paper he brings down the antiquity of the Avesta to the time of Ardashir Babeg\u00e2n, but places the origin of the existing usages of the Parsees in more ancient times. Now, as to the question of the antiquity of the Avesta, we find, that the question has undergone, as it were, through several phases. There was a time, when Sir William Jones, on the publication of Anquetil Du Perron's works on the Zend Avesta, said, that the Zend Avesta was a mere fabrication of the Parsee priests of India, and that Anquetil was simply duped by the priests of Surat. Sir W. Jones' views were soon exploded. After him, we find Mr. Erskine holding the same view in 1819, that the Avesta, as now extant, belonged to the time of Ardashir Babeg\u00e2n. This view has long since been exploded by eminent scholars of, what is termed, the Vedic School, by scholars like Benfey, Roth and Haug. But Erskine's view was again lately revived by the late lamented Dr. Darmesteter,\u00b9 who was preceded in these views, to a certain extent, by his learned teacher, M. Br\u00e9al. Dr. Darmesteter had, to use the words of the late Prof. Max M\u00fcller, \"thrown a bomb-shell in the peaceful camp of Oriental scholars.\"\u00b2 Prof. Max M\u00fcller and Dr. Mills in England, and Prof. Tiele and other scholars in Germany have restored that peace again.\n\nMr. Erskine's views on the Antiquity of the Avesta, which he brings down to the time of Ardashir Babeg\u00e2n (Artaxerxes I.), have been well refuted by Mr. K. R. Cama in his Jartoshti Abhy\u00e2s\u00b3 (i.e., Zoroastrian studies). Mr. Cama's principal argument is, that, while reviving the Zoroastrian literature, Ardashir Babeg\u00e2n had given no instructions to add extraneous or new matter to what had come down traditionally from father to son. Even, if he had given such instructions, the learned of the time had not the ability or power to do so, because the Avesta language was then well nigh dead. That even the most learned of the times, were not capable of writing religious and philosophical subjects in the Avesta language, is proved from the fact, that it appears from some parts of their Pahlavi translations, that\n\n\u00b9 Le Zend Avesta, Tome III, Preface. The Vendidad, S. B. E., Vol. IV, 2nd Ed., Introduction.\n\u00b2 Prof. Max M\u00fcller in the \"Contemporary Review\" of December 1893.\n\u00b3 No. II., pp. 49-52.\nthey were not sufficiently able to grasp the original Avesta. So, they have honestly said at times \"l\u0101 ra\u014dshan,\" i.e., the particular points are not clear to them.\n\nMr. Cama's second argument is, that in the Farvardin Yasht of the Avesta, we find no names of personages after the Kiy\u0101nian times. This fact shows, that the extant Avesta writings were written before Ardeshir Babeg\u0101n's time.\n\nI have described and refuted Prof. Darmesteter's views, which re-echo some of Mr. Erskine's views, in a paper, entitled \"The Antiquity of the Avesta,\" read before our Society\u00b9 on 26th June 1896.\n\nTransactions, L. S., B., II, pp. 362-398. 25th May 1819.\n\nThe Dabist\u0101n and the Des\u0101tir are two Persian books, which had drawn a good deal of attention of the scholars of Persian literature, history and religion in the early part of the last century. Had it not been for the honoured name of Sir William Jones, \"the Columbus of the new Old World of Sanskrit and Persian literature,\" they would not have perhaps drawn that attention. Sir William Jones attached a good deal of importance to them, especially to the Dabist\u0101n, from the historical point of view. In his Asiatic Researches,\u00b2 he grew enthusiastic over the Dabist\u0101n and called its discovery \"a fortunate discovery,\" as dissipating a cloud and casting \"a gleam of light in the primeval history of Ir\u0101n and of the human race\" of which he \"had long despaired and which could hardly have dawned from any other quarter.\"\u00b3 No wonder that Sir W. Jones grew enthusiastic over this newly discovered book, because, it mentioned the rule of some other dynasties over the throne of Persia, previous to the first Peshd\u0101dian dynasty, referred to by Firdousi and other authors.\n\nThe Dabist\u0101n refers to the Des\u0101tir, as a book sent by God\u2074 and as the \"Venerable Des\u0101tir\"\u2075 and speaks of its language as the \"celestial language.\"\u2076 The only copy of this book was found in the possession of Dastur Mo\u1e25a Feroze, whose father, K\u0101us, is said to have brought it from Persia.\u2077\n\n\u00b9 Journal, Vol. XIX, pp. 263-87.

Jones having spoken so enthusiastically of the Dabistan, the Des\u00e2t\u00eer, referred to in it, also rose in great estimation, and, as Erskine says, \"it now became an object of particular curiosity to discover the Des\u00e2t\u00eer...and the Honourable Jonathan Duncan, Esq., the late Governor of Bombay, considered himself as supremely fortunate in having at length made the longed-for discovery.\" Governor Duncan, who knew Persian well, requested Mulla Feroze \"to show it to no person whatever, and having undertaken a translation of it, continued to prosecute his work, at intervals, for several years, intending on his return to England to present it to His Majesty as the most valuable tribute which he could bring from the East.\"\n\nEven, Marquis of Hastings referred very enthusiastically to its discovery, at the time of his \"public visitation of the College of Fort William on the 15th July 1816.\" Among the literary notices of that year he noticed it as a \"literary curiosity.\" The Governor, the Hon'ble Jonathan Duncan, died before finishing his work, and so, later on, Sir John Malcolm, the next Governor, asked William Erskine to translate the work. Before the translation was published, Erskine took a notice of this \"new discovery\" in this paper, and ran down the book, and also the Dabist\u00e2n, over which, Sir W. Jones had grown enthusiastic, as books of not much importance, and as books, throwing very little of authentic light upon the history and religion of ancient Persia.\n\nMr. Erskine's paper gives an excellent outline of the Des\u00e2t\u00eer, and is, even now, worth reading for those, who do not wish to go through the whole book. Again, his views both on the Dabist\u00e2n and the Des\u00e2t\u00eer, are, to a great extent, correct. These books, though very useful in themselves, as they give an outline of the different faiths and beliefs, prevalent at one time or another, do not deserve that enthusiastic importance, which Sir W. Jones sought to attach to them, especially to the Dabist\u00e2n, from the point of view of the history and religion of ancient Ir\u00e2n.\n\nThe Dabist\u00e2n is not original in much of its contents. I have shown in my paper, before this Society, entitled \"The Parsees at the Court of Akbar and Dastur Meherji Rana,\" that, in its chapter on the Il\u00e2hi Din (Chap. X, Sec. 2), it has copied verbatim, long extracts from Badaoni's Muntakhab-al Tav\u00e2rikh. In the chapter on \"The Religion of Zoroaster\" also it has copied a good deal from the Des\u00e2t\u00eer.\n\n---\n\n1 Transactions, L. S., B., II., p. 368.\n2 Ibid., p. 369.

S., Vol XXI, No, LVIII.\nNow, what is it, that the Des\u00e2tir wants to teach us? It is something, that is Zoroastrian, and something, that is Brahminic and Budhistic. It is, to a certain extent, sufeistic in its teachings. It contains the mystic ideas found in Zoroastrianism, Brahaminism and Budhism. It is a book of a certain sect of believers, who, now and then, appear in different countries and in different ages, and who look to, what is called, the esoteric, side of things, as opposed to the exoteric, and who look to the mystic side of almost all religions for their elements of belief. Erskine's estimate of the Des\u00e2tir is well nigh correct, when he says: \"Far from regarding the doctrines of the Des\u00e2tir and the historical narrative of the Dabist\u00e2n as resting on unexceptionable authority. . . . I consider the whole of the peculiar doctrines ascribed to Mahabad and Hoshang as being borrowed from the mystical doctrines of the Persian S\u00fbfs, and from the Ascetic tenets and practices of the Yogis and Sanyasis of India, who drew many of their opinions from the Vedanti School.\"\u00b9\n\nThen, as to the time, when these doctrines existed, Erskine says: \"I regard them as having had no existence before the time of Azer-Keiwan and his disciples in the reigns of Akbar and Jehangir.\"\u00b2 But, it seems, that though these doctrines may have been reduced to some form much later, they existed in one shape or another, and in one country or another, in much older times. For example, that doctrine of the Des\u00e2tir, which says, that the planets, the fixed stars, the elements, and the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms have their intelligences, their guardian angels, their protectors, that all nature is full of the guardian souls, and that \"every genus and every specie has its guardian,\"\u00b3 reminds us of Plato's philosophy about the \"Ideas\" of things in Nature, and of the Avesta philosophy of the Far\u00f4hars.\n\nSir W. Jones had, as said above, at one time, doubted the authenticity of the Zend Avesta, brought to light by Anquetil Du Perron, and said, that it was a forgery and that Anquetil was duped by the Parsee priests of Surat. His theory was very shortly proved to be wrong. Then, as it were, as the fate would have it, his own turn came next, and his Desatir, to which he attached great importance, as having been referred to in the Dabist\u00e2n, which he brought to light with a flourish of trumpets in his sixth annual discourse at the Bengal Asiatic Society,\u2074 had to stand the heavy fire of several Oriental scholars, as to whether, it or its language was a forgery or not. Erskine, in this paper, declared its language to be a \"late invention.\"\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Transactions, L.

S., II., B., p. 382.\nMr. Norris followed suit, and in a letter, dated 1st July 1820, published in the Asiatic Journal, said that its language was \"nothing more than Derl disguised.\" After a long philological comparison, he says that \"the boasted M\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2dian language which was spoken in Iran long before the establishment of the Pishd\u00e2dian monarchy and in which we were to expect the parent of the Sanscrit, the Zend, and the Parsi, is nothing more than a jargon, which was invented, in all probability, by the professors of the faith of Hosheng.\" As to the time, at which the Des\u00e2tir was really written,\" Mr. Norris hazards a conjecture, that it was \"a fabrication of the 7th Century, to have been occasioned by the introduction of the Mohammedan faith into Persia, to have been set up as a rival to the Koran, and to have been intended to counteract the influence of a book which was preferably received from heaven, and which was likely on that occasion to make a great impression on the minds of the people.\"\n\nSilvestre de Sacy also followed suit, and in the Journal de Debats of February 1821, decided against its antiquity. William von Schlegel called it a \"refined forgery.\" In 1843 it found a defender in Anthony Troyer.\n\nI would here draw the attention of my readers, to a very excellent paper by Mr. Sheriarjee D\u00e2d\u00e2bhoy Broach\u00e2, a very learned Oriental scholar of our city, entitled \"The Des\u00e2tir,\" read before the Oriental Congress at Geneva in 1894, and also read before the Jarthoshti Din-ni-Khol Karn\u00e2r\u00ee Mandli (i.e., Society for enquiring into Zoroastrian studies) in August and September 1894. The paper is not as yet published in full. It gives an excellent outline of the contents of the Des\u00e2tir, and shows, how far its doctrines agree with, or differ from, those of the Avesta. It also shows, on philological grounds, that its language is not old, but very recent. Mr. Sheriarji thus sums up his views:\n\n\"With these few observations\u2014religious, historical and linguistic\u2014on the Des\u00e2tir, we will now bring this essay to a close. After a careful examination of the book, we cannot but come to the conclusion that it is erroneous to reckon it as one of the genuine Zoroastrian writings.

Although its teaching is professedly antagonistic to the Mosaic, the Christian, the Manikian, the Mazdakian and the Mohammedan doctrines, it does not also wholly agree with all the doctrines of Zoroastrianism. Its tendency is more towards the Hindu, Budhistic and Platonic philosophies. For example, it prohibits the use of animal flesh as food, and encourages asepticism, self-mortification, celibacy and renouncement of the world. Its treatment of the dead body, by washing it with pure and rose-water, interring or burning it, is diametrically opposed to that of Zoroastrianism, to which all these methods are repugnant. It also considerably differs from Zoroastrian writings in points of chronology, mythology, and history; and its so-called \u0101sm\u0101ni or the celestial language is decidedly a conventional jargon composed of later Pehelvi, Persian, and Hindu dialects. The very syntax of the Desatir, betrays its later origin. When we consider all these, we cannot reckon it of the category of the reliable orthodox Zoroastrian writings.\"\n\nI would not call the language of the Des\u00e2tir, an intentional forgery, to pass off the author's view in an affected old language. We must note, that it is not the author of the Des\u00e2tir himself, who calls its language \"\u0101sm\u0101ni\" or heavenly. He writes, what we may generally call, a mystic book, based on sufeistic and mystic views of different communities. Such mystic writers always aim at a kind of secrecy in the expression of their doctrines. So, in this book also, the author used, what he thought to be, a mystic dialect, made up from the languages of the different religions, from whom he drew his mystic tenets.\n\nTransactions, L.

The supposition \"that the Hindoos might have derived much of their science from the Greeks of Bactriana.\"\n\n1 Transactions, L. S., B. III., p. 1. 2 Ibid. 3 Transactions, L. S., B. III., p. 1.\nIn his previous paper, entitled \"Remarks on the Chronology of Persian History previous to the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great,\" Major Kennedy ran down the ancient Greek and Roman classical writers and extolled the native Mahomedan writers, in matters appertaining to history. In this paper, he finds fault with the classical authors, even in the matter of their geographical knowledge. In support of his previous contention, vis., that the ancient classical authors were not authentic and correct, he quotes Strabo, and his quotation is worth noting here, to guide modern students, not to place implicit confidence in everything, that the classical authors say, and not to take all, that they say, as Gospel truth. Strabo, as quoted by Kennedy, says:\n\n\"But neither has the truth respecting the Messagetae been ascertained by any author, nor can even much credit be given to what any authors have related of the ancient history of the Persians, Medes, and Syrians, on account of their simplicity and love of fable; for, observing, that the writers of fables were highly honoured, they too thought that they would render their works agreeable, if, under the form of history, they related what they never had seen or heard; and on this account they studied only how to communicate wonder and pleasure: for one would sooner give credit to the heroic numbers of Hesiod, Homer, and the tragic poets, than to Ctesias, Herodotus, Hellanicus and similar writers. Nor is it altogether safe to trust the most part of the authors who have written concerning Alexander: for they exaggerate both on account of the glory of Alexander, and of the difficulty there is in refuting relations of events which occurred at the extremity of Asia.\"\n\nThen, as to \"the geographical accounts of Persia which have been given by Greek writers,\" Kennedy proceeds to show, that they \"are far from correct, as, when carefully examined, they do not agree with each other, and as they are not only inconsistent with the opinions of the natives, but also with probability.\"\n\nAs an illustration of this want, on their part, of correct geographical knowledge, Kennedy refers to the case of Strabo and Ptolemy, describing \"the Oxus and Jaxartes to have flowed into the Caspian Sea.\" Now, the latest views of geographers have shown, that Kennedy was wrong in attributing ignorance to Strabo and Ptolemy, and that the ancient geographers were right. It is true, that the Oxus does not fall at present, into the Caspian, but falls into the sea of Aral. But, modern\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid, Vol. II., pp. 115-162.

Some identify Oxus with the Vehrud\\(^2\\) of the Zend Avesta, and take the names of the districts on its banks, \"Wakhan, Wakhst and Washgird\" to be derived from the word Veh. But the identification of the Ardvi\u00e7ura with the Oxus seems to be correct. I think, that the very name Ardvi\u00e7ura may correspond with the name Oxus. Ardvi\u00e7ura \\(\\text{\u0627\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062f\u0652\u0648\u0650\u0686\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064e\u0627}\\) may, by shortening the turn of its 'd', be read as Arkvi\u00e7ura \\(\\text{\u0627\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u0652\u0648\u0650\u0686\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064e\u0627}\\). The last \\(\\text{\u0631\u0627}\\) ra may have been dropped, as it sometimes happens. The word may be then Arkvi\u00e7u. Now, Oxus is said to have derived its name, from one of its great tributaries, the \"Aksu.\" This Aksu seems to be a modified form of Arkvisu, in which the letter \"r\" is latterly dropped. This Ardvi\u00e7ura also is spoken of, in the Old Parsee books, as flowing into the sea Vouru-kasha, which is identified with the Caspian.\n\nI. Now, coming to the subject of the first of the two errors, which Kennedy proposes to rectify, \\textit{viz.}, that the Parthians were not Zoroastrians\\(^3\\), he enters into the subject, at some length, in this paper. Those who make this supposition, seem to base their assertion, on the belief, that the Parthians were not Persians but Scythians. Strabo calls Arsaces, the founder of the Parthian dynasty, a Scythian, but at the same time says that, \"according to others, he was a Bactrian.\"\\(^4\\) Justin speaks of him as \"a man of uncertain origin,\"\\(^5\\) Of the Parthians, Justin says: \"The Parthians... were originally exiles from Scythia. This is apparent from their very name; for in the Scythian language exiles are called \\textit{Parthi}.\"\\(^6\\)\n\nSo, it appears, that there has been some difference of opinion, since the very classical times, as to who Arsaces, the founder of the Parthian dynasty was. Gibbon\\(^7\\) has taken the Parthian kings to be Scythians. Kennedy tries to prove, that they were Persians and not Scythians.\n\n\\(^1\\) \\textit{Vide} my Essay on Avestic Geography (\u0905\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091a\u0941\u0930\u093e) in my (\u0905\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091a\u0941\u0930\u093e) \"Avestic Social Life, Geography and Articles of Faith,\" p. 191. \\textit{Vide} General Walker's article on \"Oxus\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Vol. XVIII, p. 104.\n\n\\(^2\\) Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. \\textit{Ibid}, p. 101.\n\n\\(^3\\) Transactions, L.S., B., III., p. 1.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Geography of Strabo, Bk.

Kennedy enquires into the two circumstances, which may have possibly led some to think that the Parthians were Scythians.\n\n1. The Parthian kings, when they went to war, had their armies accompanied by a \"numerous train of all descriptions of people which has invariably followed an Asiatic army; and which to the well-disciplined Romans must have appeared much more like the emigration of a Scythian tribe than troops intended for battle.\"\u00b9\n\n2. The Scythians were good shooters. The Parthians were good shooters. \"A Parthian shot\" has become proverbial. So, the Parthians were thought by some to be Scythians. But, we have the authority of Herodotus and others, to say, that the Persians also learnt archery from childhood.\n\nNow, then, if you admit, that the Parthians were not Scythians, but Persians, it follows, that they were Zoroastrians. Kennedy says on this point: \"That the Parthians were a rude people, averse to the customs and manners of the Persians, hostile to literature and science, and the oppressors of the faith of Zoroaster, are assumptions which rest on no other grounds whatever than the mere assertion of ancient authors, that the Parthians were Scythians.\"\u00b2\n\nKennedy had no Pahlavi books before him to guide and assist him, but they support his contention. The Dinkard\u00b3 names a king of the Parthian dynasty, Valkhash (Vologeses), who was not only a Zoroastrian, but a founder or the originator of the Zoroastrian Renaissance, which followed the dark age after Alexander, and which reached its zenith in the reign of Ardeshir Babeg\u00e2n.\n\nWe have also the authority of Tacitus, to say, that the family of this Valkhash was an orthodox priestly family. His brother Tiridates, the king of Armenia, was a king as well as a priest; and so, when called to Rome by Nero, refused to go there by sea for some religious scruples. Tacitus says on this point: \"Neither would his brother Tiridates refuse coming to Rome to receive the Armenian diadem, but that the obligation of his priesthood withheld him; he would, however, go to the standards and images of C\u00e6sar and there, in presence of the legions, solemnly receive the kingdom.\"\u2074 Subsequently, when Tiridates did go to Rome, he went by land instead of by sea. It is\n\n\u00b9 Transactions, L. S., B., III, p. 21.\nIbid., Transactions III, pp. 33-34.\n\u00b3 S. B. E., XXXVII, West, p. 412.\n\u2074 Works of Tacitus, Vol. I. The Annals, Bk. XV., p. 24. The Oxford Translation.\nsaid, that even Valkhash, who himself also was a priest as well as a king, refused to go to Rome by sea, when called by Nero, and that the latter took this refusal as an insult.\n\nThus, we see, that we have the authority of an old Parsee book, as well as that of a Roman writer, to say, that the Parthian kings were Zoroastrians. But, there is no doubt, that during that dynasty, there was a good deal of indifference and scepticism. Hence, the necessity of the Renaissance, which began with Valkhash (Vologeses I.), grew under the fostering care of Ardeshir Babeg\u00e2n, and was continued by his son, Shapur.\n\nII. On the subject of the second erroneous supposition, viz., that the \"Hindus might have derived much of their science from the Greeks of Bactriana,\" Kennedy's line of argument is this: The Greeks of Alexander and his successors did not remain long in Bactriana, and that they could not even influence Bactriana itself. How then, could they have influenced the Hindus through Bactriana?\n\nKennedy says, that, even during his short rule, Alexander did not subvert the customs, laws and religions of the Persians. One of Kennedy's arguments, to come to that conclusion, is, that the strength of Alexander's army could not allow him, even if he wished, to do so. He says: \"If the strength of Alexander's army be considered, it will be evident that this was the only policy which he could adopt with safety.\" Kennedy enters into the statistics, given by classical writers, about the number of the army of Alexander and his successors, and says, that their number was not so large, as to permit them to subvert the customs and religion of Persia. The number of the army being small, it was their policy, not to excite the Persians to revolt, by interfering with their customs and religion. He says: \"It hence seems obvious that the conquest of Persia by the Greeks differs materially from every other conquest which is recorded in history. The lands of the vanquished were not divided amongst the principal leaders of the victorious army, nor was even the country occupied and its possession maintained by large bodies of troops. The Government alone, which had previously existed, was in appearance subverted. . . . . . The life of Alexander was too short to admit of his introducing any such changes; and constant wars and consequent weakness prevented Antigonus and the Syrian kings from attempting any innovations. . . . . Under such circumstances, it cannot be supposed that they would attempt to subvert their customs, laws, or religion. On the contrary, it seems far more probable\n\n1 Transactions, L. S., B., III, p. &\nthat the few Greeks who were scattered over the wide extent of Persia would assimilate themselves as much as possible to the natives, and that they would by intermarriages become, in the course of the second or third generation, entirely blended and identified with them.\"\u00b9\n\n\"If there be any justice in these remarks, it will follow that Bactriana, after Theodotus in B.C. 255 declared himself independent, cannot in any sense of the word be considered as a Greek kingdom. . . . It is hence by no means improbable that the Bactrian kingdom might have been both extensive and flourishing. But it seems scarcely possible that the Greek troops, who were stationed in Bactriana, could have been in the slightest degree instrumental in diffusing either knowledge or science. It must always be recollected that they were left there in B.C. 327; and that from the remoteness of their situation they were cut off from all communication with Greece. Nor does it appear from any ancient writer, that after Alexander's transient invasion, any other Greek or Syrian army than that of Antiochus the Great ever penetrated into Khorasan. The descendants of the Greeks in Bactria, therefore, could possess no peculiar knowledge except such as they derived from their fathers; and any observation must be superfluous to show that the rude soldier and the as rude officer were little likely to be acquainted with either literature or science. . . . It is most probable that, so far from being able to instruct either the Persians or Indians, they might have derived from them much more information than they could possibly communicate.\"\u00b2 It is thus, that Kennedy argues. He then concludes, that it is an erroneous supposition to say, \"that the Hindus have derived much of their science from the Greeks of Bactriana.\"\n\nNow, the question, whether the Greek civilization influenced ancient India or the Indian civilization influenced Greece, is still a subject of difference of opinion.\u00b3 Among the best latest writers, expressing the former opinion, was the late German savant, Prof. Weber. Mr. V. A. Smith, in his latest book (The Early History of India, from 600 B.C. to the Muhammadan Conquest, including the Invasion of Alexander the Great), thus sums up the other view: \"India was not Hellanized; she continued to live her life of 'splendid isolation' and soon forgot the passing of the Macedonian storm.\"\n\nIt appears, that the influence was mutual. India was influenced by the West, which, in its turn, was influenced by India. Among, what we\n\n\u00b9 Ibid., pp. 14-15.\n\u00b2 Transactions III, pp. 14-17.\n\u00b3 Vide for this subject (a) \"History of Sanscrit Literature,\" by Macdonell, Chap.

The Indian writing had a Semitic source. It is supposed to have been introduced into India in about 800 B.C.\n\n2. The rule, of about 80 years, of the Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian princes, who began to conquer Western India in about 200 B.C., had a strong influence upon the coinage of the country.\n\n3. The rule of about 300 years of the Scythian kings (120 B.C. to 178 A.D.), called by the Indians, the \u00c7akas, which is believed to be the Persian designation of the Scythians, is commemorated by the \u00c7aka era, which \"dates from 78 A.D., the inaugural year of Kanishka, the only famous king of this race.\" The Jats, a tribe of the Punjab, are said to have been descended from these Scythians.\n\nAmong some of the most certain results of the influence of India upon the West, may be mentioned the following:\n\n1. The migration of Indian fables to the West.\n\n2. The migration of the Indian game of chess* to the West, through Persia, in the time of Noshirwan (Chosroes I.).\n\n3. The influence of Indian thought upon Greek Philosophy. As striking instances of some possible influence of Indian thought upon the West, Dr. MacDonell gives the following doctrines:\n\n   (a) \"Some of the leading doctrines of the Eleatics, that God and the universe are one, that everything existing in multiplicity has no reality, that thinking and being are identical, are all to be found in the philosophy of the Upanishads and the Ved\u0101nta system, which is its outcome.\n\n   (b) \"Again, the doctrine of Empedocles, that nothing can arise which has not existed before, and that nothing existing can be annihilated, has its exact parallel in the characteristic doctrine of the S\u0101\u1e45khya system about the eternity and indestructibility of matter.\n\nAccording to Greek tradition, Thales, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, and others undertook journeys to Oriental countries in order to study philosophy. Hence there is at least the historical possi-\n\n---\n\n1 MacDonell's Sanskrit Literature, pp. 16 and 408.\n2 Ibid, p. 412.\n3 Ibid, p. 413.\n4 Vide my paper before the B. B. R. A. S., entitled \"Firdousi on the Indian Origin of the Game of Chess.\" Journal, Vol. XIX, pp. 224-236.\nbility of the Greeks having been influenced by Indian thought through Persia.\"\n\n(c) The Pythagorean doctrines of (a) the transmigration theory (b) and of the assumption of five elements, (c) his \"theorem in geometry, (d) the prohibition as to eating beans, (e) the religio-philosophical character of the Pythagorean fraternity, (f) and the mystical speculations of the Pythagorean school, all have their close parallels in Ancient India.\" Pythagoras is supposed to have learnt all these from Indians in Persia.\n\n(d) The neo-Platonist philosophy is supposed to have been influenced by the S\u0101\u1e45khya system.\n\n(e) The same S\u0101\u1e45khya system influenced Christian Gnosticism in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.\n\n(f) Coming to nearer times, the pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer was influenced by Indian thought expressed in the Upanishads.\n\n4. In science, (a) India has given the numerical figures to the West through the Arabs.\n\n(b) In Geometry, the West is supposed to have borrowed something from India. \"The arrangement of the sacrificial ground and the construction of altars, according to very strict rules, the slightest deviation from which might cause the greatest disaster,\" at first led the Indians to primitive thoughts about Geometry.\n\n(c) In later times, even Indian Astronomy influenced the West through the Arabs.\n\n(d) The same was the case in Medical Science; some of the Indian medical works were translated by the Arabs into the Arabic, and these translations had a certain influence upon European medical science.\n\n5. Of the influence of Indian literature upon the West, Dr. MacDonell says: \"The intellectual debt of Europe to Sanskrit literature has thus been undeniably great; it may perhaps become greater still in the years that are to come.\"\n\nWeber thinks that the old literature of India was influenced by Greece. For example, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was influenced by Homer's Iliad. Again, the Indian Drama was influenced by Greek plays, played in India during the time of the Greek invasion. But the question of this influence is not settled.\n\n1 MacDonell's Sanskrit Literature, pp. 421-22. 2 Ibid., p. 422. 3 Ibid., p. 427.\n\n* Vide Principal MacMillan's Lecture on \"Indian and Homeric Poems\" in his \"The Globe-Trotter in India and other Indian Studies\" (1895), pp. 171-192.\nThus we see, that, in undervaluing the influence of the Greeks, Kennedy rather overshoots the mark. Though the rule of the Greeks in Persia and Bactriana was short, their influence in destroying the old state of affairs was not so little as Kennedy supposes. He says, that it was to the interest of Alexander, that, small as his army was, he should not disturb the religion and customs of the conquered people. Kennedy generally places greater faith in native sources than on classical authors. Now, he had not before him, the Pahlavi books of the Parsees to guide and assist him in this matter. They had not come to sufficient light at his time. More than one Pahlavi book has very clearly said, that Alexander destroyed the ancient literature, and with it, the religion of the country. It is for this reason, that they generally speak of him as \"Gazasht\u00e9 Alexieder\", i.e., \"the cursed Alexander.\" They put him into the class of wicked men, like Zoh\u00e2k and Afr\u00e2si\u00e2b, who devastated their country. It was true, that, as Kennedy says, it was to his interest, that he should preserve their religion and not disturb or excite their feelings, lest they may rise in rebellion. But, he sought other means to gain that end. A very interesting account of the correspondence, that passed between him and his tutor Aristotle, has been preserved in a letter of Tansar, the Vazir and headpriest of Ardeshir Babeg\u00e2n, to the king of Tabaristan. The original Pahlavi has been lost, but its Persian translation has been preserved, though with a good deal of subsequent interpolations and additions. The late Prof. Darmesteter has given to the public the text of that Persian letter and its translation. We learn from that letter, that in order to secure the above end, Alexander thought of putting to death the leading aristocracy of Persia whom he expected to rise in rebellion. But Aristotle prevented him from resorting to such a dastardly act, and advised him to divide Persia into different principalities and to set up a Persian nobleman to rule over it as an independent ruler. He said, that such independent rulers (Maluk-i-Taw\u00e2if) would fight among themselves for supremacy, and thus weaken themselves, so as never to be able to rise in open revolt against Alexander. Alexander did this. It is an interesting correspondence, and as it is not referred to by any classical writer, I will quote it here at some length. Alexander writes to Aristotle:\n\n\"Par la gr\u00e2ce de Dieu tout puissant nos affaires sont en bonne voie et je veux partir pour l'Inde, la Chine et l'Extr\u00eame Orient. Mais je r\u00e9fl\u00e9chis que, si je laisse en vie les grands de la Perse, en mon absence ils feront na\u00eetre des troubles qu'il sera difficile de r\u00e9primer ; ils envahiront Roum et attaqueront nos provinces, Ce\n\n1 Viraf-Nameh, ch.

But I think, that if I will leave alive the great men of Persia, in my absence, they will create troubles which it will be difficult to suppress. They will invade Asia Minor and carry an attack over our provinces. What I think best to do, is to kill them all, and then being free from all anxiety, to realize my projects.\n\nAristotle replied, \"It is an averred fact, that, in the world, the races of all climates are distinguished by an excellent trait, a talent, (and) a special superiority which is not found in the races of other climates. What distinguishes the Persians, is courage, bravery and prudence on the day of battle, qualities which form the most powerful instruments for sovereignty and success. If you will exterminate them, you will destroy from this world, the best pillar of talent, and once the great men have disappeared, thou shalt be unavoidably forced to pass down to villains, the functions and the ranks of the great. Now, bear this in mind, that in this world, there is no evil, plague, revolt and pestilence, the action of which shall be so pernicious as the promotion of villains to the ranks of nobles. Take care then, turn away your bridle from this project, and in your accomplished wisdom, cut off the tongue of the severity which carries (pain) and wounds more than the lance which slays a man, and for the sake of getting a little ease in this ephemeral life, do not go to lose your good name by following vague calculations, instead of the truth and certainty of religion and faith. . . . . What you have to do, is to entrust the kingdom of Persia to these kings (i.e., the petty kings of provinces), and to confer the crowns and thrones upon them, wherever you find them (fit), without giving to any one of them, the precedence or authority over others, in such a way, that every one rules like an independent prince. To bear the crown is a thing of which one may be proud, and a chief, who has obtained the crown, does neither consent to pay tribute to anybody, nor to bend his head before another. This will create, then, among the petty kings, so much of discord, misunderstandings, competitions and disputes for the purpose of having power, so much of rivalry for the display and spread of their riches, so much of quarrels for the degree of respect, so much for the show of their followers, that they will have no leisure to take revenge against thee, and being absorbed in their own affairs, will no more think of the past. And when you will go to the furthest end of the world,\n\n1 Journal Asiatique Neuvi\u00e8me S\u00e9rie, Tome III, p. 505 (1894).\nevery one of them will frighten his neighbour with thy power, with thy force, and with the threat of thy assistance, and there will be (enough of) security for thee and after thee.\" 1\n\nFirdousi also refers to this fact, but there is one difference between what the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh of Firdousi says, and what the letter of Tansar says. The letter of Tansar places the fact of this correspondence before Alexander's march to India, but the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh places it after his return from India.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A.

The book has since been translated into Gujarati in 1855 under the title of \"\u0a95\u0abf\u0ab8\u0ac7\u0ab6 \u0ab6\u0abe\u0ab9\u0aa8\u0abe\u0aae\u0ac1\u0a82 \u0a85\u0aa7\u0acd\u0aaf\u0abe\u0aaf \u0aa4\u0acd\u0ab0\u0aa3\u0acb\u0aa8\u0ac0 \u0a95\u0ac3\u0aa4\u0acd\u0aa4\u0ac0 \u0aaa\u0abe\u0aa0\u0ab6\u0abe\u0ab3\u0abe\u0aa8.\" Eastwick's translation is, as yet, the only English translation, referred to by subsequent writers on the subject. The text of the book is now being published in Bombay by Mr. M\u00e2nockji Rustomji Unw\u00e2l\u00e2 in his Rev\u00e2yet of D\u00e2r\u00e2b Hormazdy\u00e2r.\n\nThe most important event, referred to in it, is the fall of the town of Sanj\u00e2n and the defeat and massacre of the Parsis at the hand of Alaf-kh\u00e2n, a general of Sult\u00e2n M\u00e2hmud. Now, who was this Sult\u00e2n M\u00e2hmud, and when did this event occur? Dr. Wilson, in a foot-note to the above translation, says it was Sult\u00e2n M\u00e2hmud Bigarh\u00e2 who reigned in Gujar\u00e2t from 1459 to 1511 A.D. But the late Sir James Campbell, in his \"Bombay Gazetteer\" (Vol. XIII, Part I, p. 250; Vol. IX, Pt. 2, p. 187), says that it was \"Muhammad Sh\u00e2h or Ala-ud-din Khilji\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid, pp. 503\u2014505.

S., I, p. 167.\n4 Ibid, p. 184.\nSir James Campbell advances some arguments in favour of his views. But, I think, they are not valid, and that Dr. Wilson is quite correct in his view of taking the Sultan, as Sultan Mahmud Bigarha (Begada). I do not wish to enter here, at any length, into the question. I have handled this question, at some length, in an article in the \"East and West\" of July, 1903 (Vol. II, No. 21), entitled \"A few Events and their Dates in the Early History of the Parsees,\" and at full length in an article in the \"Zartoshii,\" an Anglo-Vernacular quarterly of Bombay, in its issues of 1904 (Vol. I, Nos. 3 and 4; Vol. II, Nos. 1-2 et seq.). The fort of Champanir, referred to in this Kisseeh, is described at some length in a paper entitled \"Account of the Hill-Fort of Champaneer in Guzerat,\" by Capt. Miles. (Transactions, L. S. B., I, pp. 150\u201456, vide below p. 288.)\n\nAs to the particular date of the abovementioned event, Dr. Wilson gives it as 1507, but I think that it was 1494 A.D.\n\nIn the text, there are the following couplets:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0622\u0645\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u062a} \\\\\n&\\text{\u0646\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0627\u0631\u06a9\u0633 \u0622\u0646\u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u062a} \\\\\n&\\text{\u062f\u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0648 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0627 \u0628\u0646 \u0622\u0633\u0627} \\\\\n&\\text{\u06a9\u0631 \u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u0627}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nEastwick has translated them thus\u2014\n\n\"In that time one among the faithful arose:\nThere was none to equal him in those days.\n\nDhewud was his name, and he resembled the blessing of marriage,\nFor he brought encouragement to the faithful.\"\n\nHere, Eastwick has not properly understood the second of these two couplets. He says in a foot-note about the whole of the passage, that it \"is very obscure, and appears corrupt.\" Again, in a foot-note on the word Dhewud, he finds fault with the text and says: \"This appears to be a mistake; for, as below, the name should be Dawar.\"\n\nNow, the text is correct, and the passage is not obscure, as Eastwick has thought it to be. The thing is, that he has taken a proper noun in the second couplet, to be a common noun and the common noun to be a proper noun. The word \\(\\text{\u062f\u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u062f}\\) which he read \"Dhewud,\" is not a proper noun, but is a common noun, and must be read\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid. 2 Mr. Manockji Rustomji Unwalla's old manuscript of Darab Hormuzdyar's Revayet, folio 547b, couplets 25 and 27.

Perhaps, he read the word\u2014or perhaps his manuscript gave the word as \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u0646 (Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 Sh\u00e2h), which is another form of the name of this personage, and which is also written in some Rev\u00e2yets as \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062c\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0647 Sh\u00e2h Jangeh Sh\u00e2h. He then perhaps mistook the word for Jan-sh\u00e2h or Sh\u00e2h-Jan, which is used in Parsee books for 'a bride.' The real interpretation of the second couplet is \"He was a leader and his name was Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 bin \u00c2s\u00e2.\"\n\nNow, a study of the dates of the chief events in the life of this Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 bin \u00c2s\u00e2 (or Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 Sh\u00e2h, as he is otherwise called in other books), as determined from other sources, enables us, not only to settle the question, as to who the abovenamed Sult\u00e2n M\u00e2hmud was, but also the date of the above event.\n\nI think, that this mistake of Eastwick in his translation, vis., his taking Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 Sh\u00e2h to be a common noun instead of a proper noun, is, to a certain extent, responsible for placing the learned author of the \"Gazetteer\" on a false track.\u00b9 Had Eastwick given the name of Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 Sh\u00e2h in his translation, an inquisitive person like the author of the \"Gazetteer,\" who has mentioned the name of Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 Sh\u00e2h in other matters, would have inquired into the history of the life of this man, and then, knowing the time when he lived, would not have conjectured that the Sult\u00e2n M\u00e2hmud was Al\u00e2-ud-din-Khilji. The name of Ch\u00e2ng\u00e2 Sh\u00e2h, which he knew, and his date, would have prevented him from doing so. This is an instance, which shows, how a small word, if not properly translated, supplies faulty materials for history. Writers of history must look to the originals and not depend upon translations.\n\nThere are several foot-notes in this paper by Dr. Wilson, written from a Christian point of view, which are not correct, and which I need not criticise here.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., I., pp. 293\u2014302.\n\nAs Mr. Bird says it was \"the conquests on the Indus, made by the Greek sovereigns of Bactria, the Seleucidae, the Parthian and Sassanian kings of Persia,\" that introduced into India, and especially into that part called Indo-Scythia, \"a variety of coins distinguished by Mythological devices.\" They are \"ascribed to some of the\n\n\u00b9 He says: \"The poetical account does not name the layman who persuaded the priests to move the fire to Sanjan\" (?

I., p. 293).\n\nThe author says in this paper, on the authority of the R\u0101djatarangini, that, in about 319 A.D., the ruler of Ujain in M\u0101lw\u0101 was Sri man Hersha Vikramaditya, and that he was the same as Shapur II. of Persia. He had \"instituted a persecution against the Manicheans and Christians throughout his dominions.\"\n\nWe know from other sources, that some of the Manicheans, who had escaped to India in Shapur's time, had introduced into the country, especially into the south, many Persian coins. The Pahlavi inscriptions found in Southern India owe their existence to those Manichean refugees from Persia. For a more recent treatment of the question of the names of the deities on the Indo-Scythian coins treated in this paper, I would refer my readers to an excellent article of Dr. Aurel Stein, entitled \"Zoroastrian Deities on Indo-Scythian Coins\" in the Indian Antiquary (Vol. XVII, Part CCVII). Dr. Stein has reprinted this article in a separate pamphlet form in 1888. In connection with this paper, Mon. E. Druin's paper, entitled \"Le Nimbe et les Signes de l'Apoth\u00e9ose sur les Monnaies des rois Indo-Scythes\" in the 'Revue Numismatique' (Quatri\u00e8me S\u00e9rie Tome V, deuxi\u00e8me trimestre 1901)\" is worth reading. In connection with the subject of the \"Kava\u00eam Kharen\u00f4\" represented on the gold coins, especially of Huvishta (Stein's Zoroastrian Deities, p. 13) the nimbe, referred to by Mon. Druin, Prof. Wilhelm's paper on 'kharenannang' (quarena\u00f1h) (Contribution \u00e0 L'Interpretation de l'Avesta 1885, Extrait du Mus\u00e9on) may be read with advantage.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., II., pp. 151\u2014165.\n\nIn this paper, Rev. Mitchell gives an English translation of M Anquetil du Perron's article in his Zend Avesta (Tome II., pp. 592-618), entitled \"Syst\u00e8me C\u00e9r\u00e9moniel et Moral des Livres Zends et Pehlvis, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en lui-m\u00eame, et relativement au Syst\u00e8me Th\u00e9ologique de ces m\u00eames Livres.\" The translation is preceded by a short introduction, in which Rev. Mitchell looks with suspicion to the bona fides of Anquetil in his estimate of the Parsee religion. He says: \"Anquetil du Perron, in\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., I., p. 296.\n2 Vide \"R\u0101djatarangini, Histoire des Rois du Kachmir\", traduite par M. Troyer; Tome III; (1852), pp. 43, 653.\nhis expositions of the P\u00e2rsi religion, manifests a desire to exhibit it in as flattering a light as possible. He was naturally led to represent his own discovery in a favourable aspect, and the cutting sarcasms of Jones, Richardson, and others, who represented him as having risked his life, and wasted his time, to procure what was essentially worthless, redoubled his desire to uphold the character of the Zand-Avast\u00e2.\n\nHe earnestly labours, in the paper we now subjoin, to show that the doctrines and institutions of the Zand-Avast\u00e2 are consistent with reason;\u2014let the reader judge whether his success is equal to his zeal.\"\u00b9\n\nWell, the cutting sarcasms of Sir W. Jones and Richardson, had, before the time when Rev. Mitchell wrote, been shown to be in themselves worthless. They said, that Anquetil was duped by the Parsee priests of Surat, who had passed on him some later writings as the scriptures of their ancient Ir\u00e2n. They have been proved to be wrong, and Anquetil's estimate of the religious system of Zoroaster has been since upheld by many an impartial critic. Anquetil has erred here and there in his observations and has erred a good deal in his translations; but, that must not detract from the correctness of his general estimate of the religion.\n\nThe study of the Avesta is interesting even to a Biblical student, not only for its moral system referred to by Anquetil, but for several other points. Prof. Jackson says on this point: \"To the Biblical student, the Avesta and the religion of Zoroaster have more than one distinct point of interest. It may fairly be said that the sacred books of no other people, outside the light of the great revelation, contain a clearer grasp of the ideas, of right and wrong, or a firmer faith in the importance of the purity alike of body and soul, a more ethical conception of duty (considering the early times), or a truer, nobler, more ideal belief in the resurrection of the body, the coming of a Saviour and of the rewards and punishments hereafter for the immortal soul, than are to be found in the scriptures of Ancient Iran, illuminated by the spirit of the great teacher himself, Zoroaster.\" (\"Avesta, the Bible of Zoroaster,\" in the Biblical World of June 1893, pp. 420-21.)\n\nI may say here, that the portion of Anquetil's work, translated in this paper by Rev. Mitchell, forms a part of the translation of a larger part of his work, published under the title of \"Extracts from the Narrative of Mons. Anquetil du Perron's Travels in India\" by the late lamented Mr. Kavasji Edalji Kanga, whose death last March all Avesta scholars deplore so much.\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B. R. A. S., Vol. II., pp. 154-155.\nThe learned author of this discourse inaugurated, for the first time in the history of the Society, in 1844, i.e., forty years after its foundation, what he calls \"the time-honoured custom of other Societies, to review at their Anniversary Meetings the intended objects and progress of their inquiries.\" The custom has, since, been more honoured in its breach than in its observance, and I think, that it can very advantageously be revived. In this learned discourse of his, the author, the then Secretary of the Society, while speaking of the literature of Persia gives his view, or rather sums up the view, held at the time, about the origin of Pahlavi, Pazend and Zend. Even now, after the lapse of so many years, it is worth reading, as giving the then prevalent views on the subject of these languages. The author thus refers to Sir W. Jones' theory about the Zend being \"a forgery of modern times.\" He says: \"The testimony of so ancient an author as Masudi, that the book called Asta and its commentary the Pazend were in existence in his time, establishes the comparative antiquity of the Zend-Avasta, and that the language of it is not a forgery of modern times. . . . It is . . . more natural to conclude with Rask that Sanskrit was introduced, as a foreign language into India, from Aria or Iran, in preference to the supposition that it was brought from India into Persia.\"\n\nThis article is interesting for those, who want to know, how the Ir\u0101nian Cuneiform Inscriptions were, one by one, deciphered, and what great difficulties their decipherment presented. This article presents an idea of an early attempt to translate the first few lines of the Inscriptions of Darius at Behistun. This part of the inscription is written in the style of the 8th Chapter of the Ya\u1e63na, known among the modern Parsees as (\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd) Jamv\u0101ni b\u0101j, i.e., the prayer for saying grace before meals. It is the same, as that, which has been latterly deciphered, on the \"Chalouf column,\" discovered by the late M. Lesseps, near the modern Suez Canal.\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A.

March 1849\nand February 1852.\n\nUnder this title the author presents two of his papers.\n\nI. He had read the first paper on 22nd March 1849 under the title of \"A brief view of some recent investigations of the Zend Avesta by German Orientalists.\"\n\nII. The second paper bears no particular title. It was read on 12th February 1852, and in the Proceedings of the Meeting of that date it is said to be a paper on \"Zend Literature.\" Revd. Mitchell speaks of it as \"A notice of the zealous and successful studies of two (Orientalists), whose names are already familiar\u2014Professor Spiegel of Erlangen and Dr. Rudolph Roth.\"\n\nThe first of these two papers treats of the following papers by two German Orientalists:\n\n(1) \"Studies on the Zend Avesta,\" by Dr. Spiegel.\n\n(2) \"The Legend of Feridun in India and Iran,\" by Dr. Roth.\n\nRevd. Mitchell gives a short description of the subjects treated by these Orientalists, and holds them, as supporting his views about Anquetil's version of the Zend Avesta and about the religious and moral system of the Parsees.\n\nI have referred in a previous part of this paper (pp. 200-1), to Rev. Mitchell's translation of Anquetil's views on the religious system of the Parsees. He did not agree with Anquetil, in the high estimation in which he held the system. So, in this paper, he quotes with approbation, Spiegel's views about the incorrectness of Anquetil's translation. But he forgets, that, in spite of incorrectness here and there in details in the matter of translation, the estimate formed by a person like Anquetil, from the books and from his experience, may be correct. Even after 50 years of more critical and philosophical study, it is not rare, to find scholars differing much in their translations of a number of passages.\n\nThe view expressed by Spiegel, in the paper referred to, about the Pahlavi language, differs from that of Westergaard, noted in this same volume. Westergaard, in a letter dated 21st July 1851, and addressed to Dr. Wilson, expressed his opinion \"founded on a critical examination of the so-called Pehlivi writings, that they are not\n\n---\n\n1 Vide Extracts from the Proceedings of the Society for the meeting held on 22nd March 1849, Journal, Vol. III., Part II., No. XIII., p. 140.\n2 Journal, B.

Spiegel, on the other hand, was of opinion, that Pahlavi belonged \"to the era of the earlier Sassanian kings of Persia (from A.D. 226 onwards)\" and he referred \"the Pehlivi version of the Zendavesta to the same age\". Spiegel's study of Pahlavi was deeper than that of Westergaard's, and his opinion has proved to be correct. The following view of Spiegel, as noted in this article, deserves more than a passing notice: \"Wholly apart from its use as a translation, as a relic of the Sassanian dynasty, it (the Pahlavi literature) is possessed of much historical value. The Sassanian epoch is one of the highest importance in the history of Asia\u2014and of Asiatic mind; but, unhappily, it is involved in much obscurity. The science of History may expect to receive interesting contributions from the light which will be shed on that epoch from the study of the Pehlivi version of the Zendavesta, and the works connected with it. At that period, Persia by no means secluded herself from intercourse with foreign nations. Greek and Christian influences acted powerfully on the Persian mind; and Parsiism, again, largely contributed to the opinions of the Gnostics and Manicheans. The Western influence acted on Persia in two modes; the one, translation of Greek writers into Persian, the other, direct contact between the Persians and the Syrian Christians who were scattered in large numbers throughout the country.\"\n\nNow, though the expectation of Spiegel, as to the science of History receiving interesting contributions, has not been greatly fulfilled, still, the Pahlavi literature, that has since been brought to light, has not been without its value in great many ways. The Pahlavi literature, other than the Pahlavi translations, has presented a vivid picture of the Iranian life of the period, and has, at the same time, explained a good deal of, what we may call, the historical allusions of the Avesta. Again, it has shown, how far, that historical poem, the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh of Firdousi, has rested, in many of its episodes, on the sure grounds of old reliable materials.\n\nAs to the influence of the West on the East, i.e., Persia, we know, that it is a question, on which there is much difference of opinion. The question, as to how much the East influenced the West, and the West influenced the East, is not settled. But, this much can be said, that the later influence of the West\u2014for example, that of Greece\u2014was, to a certain extent, a reflex of what was once remitted by the East to the West. Persia had, through the Greek translations of\n\n1 Journal, B.B.R.A.S., IV., p. 153. 2 Ibid, p. 219. 3 Ibid, p. 220.\n4 Vide above pp. 192-94.\nits books, at the time of Alexander's conquest, given something of its own to the West, and so, if the West, as typified by Greece, gave something back to it in later Sassanian times, it was something of its own, to a great extent. In fact, it took up back, what was congenial to its own soil.\n\nComing to the second subject of Rev. Mitchell's first paper, vis., \"The Legend of Feridun in India and Iran,\" we find Rev. Mitchell getting rather exultant. He says: \"It has been well known for a considerable time that many of the technical religious terms occurring in the Veda are reproduced in the Zendavesta. . . . The identification of proper names, thus happily commenced by Bopp and Lassen, has been carried out by Dr. Roth, in the case of the word Feridun. . . Amid the confessedly inextricable confusion in which the primeval annals of Persia are involved, it has been fondly imagined that with him at all events we discern some traces of historic truth. . . Now, if the conclusions of the German critic be accordant with truth, Feridun. . . is no historic personage at all\u2014he is simply one of the deities acknowledged in remote times by the Aryan race.\" Rev. Mitchell forgets, that the mere fact of a historic person being raised by later generations, or by the people of another country, into the position and dignity of a deity, does not make him less a historic person. Persia, the country of Feridun, has not made him a deity. India has made him so. India will one day make\u2014to a certain extent it has begun making\u2014Her late Majesty a deity. So, will the later generations of England look to her name with suspicion? As a recent writer says: \"We have before our eyes, the fact, that the worship of the dead, or of men celebrated for their power, wisdom or piety, has always, and in all ages, been one of the predominant tendencies of human nature.\" The same writer says: \"In the case of ancient profane history and tradition, it is evident that while fable and exaggeration would be almost certain to collect round the memories of celebrated persons, yet they are no proof that these persons never existed.\"\n\nIn the second paper embodied in this article, Rev. Mitchell brings to the notice of the members of the Society, further studies of the same two abovementioned German Orientalists. Dr. Roth's article on the \"Legend of Jamshid\" is in the same line, as that on the \"Legend of Feridun\" referred to above.\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S. IV, pp. 221\u2014222,\n2 \"The Worship of the Dead\" by Col. J. Garnier, Preface, p. viii.\n3 Ibid, p. vi.\n4 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., IV, p. 225.\n5 I would refer my readers for my views on Jamshed, to my essay on Jamshed, in my (\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u092e\u0936\u0947\u0926) \"Jamshed, Haoma and Fire.\"\nOf the several articles of Dr. Spiegel, referred to in this paper, one is that on the \"Legend of S\u00e2m.\"\n\nSpiegel's treatise on the 19th Chapter of the Vendidad, referred to here, is interesting to the Parsis, as a defence from a learned Orientalist, against the allegation, that the ancient Persians considered \"Zrav\u00e2na Akarana,\" i.e., \"Endless Time\", as the supreme deity. \"He contends with M\u00fcller, that in the proper P\u00e2rs\u00ee system, there is no place for Zar\u00fb\u00e2n as the supreme deity.\" Rev. Mitchell has given here, Dr. Spiegel's translation of a part of the 19th Chapter of the Vendidad, which contains the words \"Zrav\u00e2n Akarana,\" and has compared his translation with Mr. Fr\u00e2mje\u00ea Asp\u00e2ndiarji's and Anquetil's translations. Dr. Haug refers to this question, briefly, in his \"Essays on the Parsis.\" Mr. K. R. Cama refers twice to this subject in his \"Zartoshti Abhy\u00e2s.\" At first, he refers to Dr. Spiegel's correct interpretation, referred to in this paper, and gives his views of the subject. He refers to the same subject again, when refuting the views of M. Adolphe Franck, on the sect of the Zervanites, referred to by the Armenian writer Esnick. This sect, at one time, believed in \"Zrav\u00e2na Akarana,\" but their belief has no foundation on the Avesta. The belief is also referred to in a later Persian treatise called Olm\u00e2-i-Isl\u00e2m.\n\nAmong other questions, referred to in this paper, we find the following:\n\nI. The influence of Judaism upon the Zoroastrian religion and vice versa. Rev. Murray Mitchell says on this subject: \"Our Orientalists are not in general disposed to attribute so much influence to Judaism in the development of the P\u00e2rs\u00ee system as the historical connexion between the Jews and Persians suggests as probable, and even necessary. The wide dissemination of Jews and Jewish opinions throughout the Roman Empire is an admitted fact . . . .\n\n---\n\n1 Strange to say, that I had heard at Cashmere, a good deal of this hero's legend. Among this, I heard an allusion to him, which is referred to in a Pahlavi work, and to which no reference is made in a Persian book. I have referred to this matter, in my paper before our Society, entitled \"Cashmere and the Ancient Persians.\" (B. B. R. A. S. Vol. XIX, pp. 237\u2014248.)\n\n2 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., IV, p. 230.\n\n3 \"Essays on the Parsis,\" 2nd edition, p. 24.\n\n4 F. Lajard has suggested, that the \"circle\", found in some of the monuments of Persia, signified the Zrav\u00e2na Akarana, referred to here. Vide in Nouveau Journal Asiatique, Tome XVI (Aout 1835), an article entitled \"Sur l'emploi et la signification du cercle ou de la couronne et du globe dans les repr\u00e9sentations figur\u00e9es des divinit\u00e9s chald\u00e9ennes ou assyriennes et des divinit\u00e9s persanes\", p. 172.\n\n5 No. VI, pp. 330\u2014332.\n\n6 No. X, pp. 90\u201492.\n\n7 Vide \"French Views on Zoroastrianism,\" translated from the texts of M.

Blochet's very interesting brochure on this subject entitled \"Le Livre intitul\u00e9 L'Oulam\u00e2-i-Isl\u00e2m\" (1898), pp. 18-19, published as a number of \"Revue de L'Histoire des Religions.\" Vide Fragments relatifs \u00e0 la religion de Zoroastre (1899) par M. Mohl, Oulema-i Isl\u00e2m, pp. 1-2.\nWe have no reason to believe the influence of Judaism in Persia to have been less.\"\n\nWe find, that not only Orientalists, but some of the Christian divines, have come to the conclusion, that the influence of the Persian religion has been much more over Judaism than that of the latter upon the former. As far as the Avesta is concerned, its influence upon Judaism is undoubtedly great. Possibly, some part of the later Pahlavi and Pazend literature was, to a little extent, influenced by Hebrew thoughts. As an instance of the influence of Judaism on later Pazand literature, Dr. Darmesteter points to a Jewish-Persian prayer.\n\nAmong the earlier writers, who said, that Judaism was, to a certain extent, indebted to Zoroastrianism, we find the names of Bunsen and Rhodes. Among the modern writers of this view, we find Dr. Cheyne and Dr. Mills, who admit the Zoroastrian influence to a certain extent. Dr. Kohut's book on the subject is very interesting. Mr. K. R. Cama has referred to this subject in his Jartoshti Abhy\u0101s.\n\nThe question referred to in this paper, whether the doctrine of Resurrection is an original Avesta doctrine, or one borrowed by the Persians later on from the Hebrews, has been often discussed. Dr. Haug said: \"It is not ascertained whether these doctrines were borrowed by the Parsis from the Jews, or by the Jews from the Parsis; very likely neither is the case, and in both these religions they seem to have sprung up independently.\" Later on, he calls this \"a genuine Zoroastrian doctrine\" resting on two passages of the Zamy\u0101d Yasht. Further on Haug refers to Burnouf's discussion of the meaning of the words \"Yava\u0113cha, Yavat\u0101ta\u0113cha,\" referred to by Rev. Mitchell in this paper, and says: \"In consequence of Burnouf's inquiries into the phrase Yava\u0113cha Yavat\u0101ta\u0113cha (which had been translated by Anquetil \"till the resurrection,\" but which means nothing but \"for ever and ever,\") the existence of such a doctrine in the Zend-Avesta was lately doubted.\n\n1 Journal, B.

B. R. A. S. IV, p. 231.\nBut there is not the slightest reason for doubting it, as one may convince himself from the passage quoted in p. 217, where it is clearly stated that the dead shall rise again. That the resurrection of the dead was a common belief of the Magi, long before the commencement of our era, may be learned from the statement of Theopompos. Now the question arises, had Spitama Zarathushtra already pronounced this doctrine, which is one of the chief dogmas of Christianity, and of the Jewish and Mahomedan religions, or is it of later, perhaps foreign, origin? Though in the Gathas there is no particular statement made of the resurrection of the dead, yet we find a phrase used which was afterwards always applied to signify the time of resurrection, and the restoration of all life that has been lost during the duration of creation. This is the expression *frashem kerenaon ah\u00fbm* (Yas. XXX, 9). . .\n\nAccording to these statements, there can be no doubt that this important doctrine is a genuine Zoroastrian dogma, which developed itself naturally from Spitama Zarathushtra's sayings. There is not the slightest trace of its being borrowed from a foreign source.\"\n\nProf. Jackson also has referred to this question in his article on \"The Ancient Persian Doctrine of a Future Life\" (The Biblical World of August 1896, p. 157). Therein, he says: \"A question may arise as to whether the Saviour-idea in Mazdaism was a tenet that was taught by Zoroaster himself, or whether it may not possibly be due to some influence of the Messianic idea in Judaism. . . . A metrical fragment of the Avesta (Frag. IV. 1-4), an extract from Yasht XIII. 89 seq. and the well known passage in the Bundahishn . . . (Bd. XXX, 1 seq.), all lend their weight in ascribing this particular teaching to Zoroaster himself. The whole system of the faith appears to be built upon this tenet.\" He says the same thing, in his article on Resurrection in the American Oriental Society's Proceedings (April 1893, pp. XXVIII-XXXIX). Therein he says that it \"was a tenet undoubtedly inculcated by Zoroaster some centuries before the Christian era.\"\n\nDr. Cheyne seems to think that the Jewish doctrine of Resurrection was borrowed from the Zoroastrians.\n\nProf. Graetz, in his \"History of the Jews,\" points to the following customs and beliefs, as borrowed from the Ir\u00e2niens by the Jews:\n\n1. Laws concerning purity and impurity. Graetz says:\u2014\"These laws would never have attained such far-spreading and extra-\n\n---\n\n1 Haug's Essays on the Parsis, 2nd Ed., pp. 312-13.\n2 The Origin and Religious contents of the Psalter by Dr. Cheyne (1891), pp. 400-401.\n3 Vide Mr. K.

They imagined that they were adding to the glory of God, if, in imitation of the Ir\u00e2niains, they surrounded Him with myriads of obedient servants... Like the Persians the Jud\u00e6ans called the angels the holy watchers.\"\u00b2\n\n3. \"As the imagination of Yazatas had given the angels a Hebrew character and Hebrew names, so did it also introduce the bad spirits, or Daevas, among the Jud\u00e6ans. Satan was a copy of Angro-Mainyus.\"\u00b3\n\n4. The idea of Heaven (Paradise) and Hell (Ge-Hinnom). \"Each individual was permitted to accept or to reject this doctrine.\"\u2074\n\n5. \"One belief emanating from the Iranian religion became part of the spiritual life of the Jud\u00e6ans, until it grew at last to be a binding dogma; it was that of the resurrection of the dead from their graves.\"\u2075\n\nII. One other question, referred to by Rev. Mitchell, in this paper, is that, of \"The Antiquity of the Avesta.\" Among the advanced opponents holding opposite views on the subject during these last 10 years, we have the distinguished names of the late Dr. Darmesteter and of Rev. Dr. Mills. I have examined Dr. Darmesteter's views at some length in my paper on \"The Antiquity of the Avesta,\" read before our Society.\u2076\n\nJournal V., pp. 77\u201494, 21st April 1853.\n\nThis paper \"notices the coincidence, and at the same time discrepancy, of several of the Zendic with the Vedic legends; endeavours to trace their origin to traditions of a primitive era of physical and moral bliss, and to aspirations for a renewal of happiness both in the present and future life; and points out their subsequent corruption in the interpretation of them as historical notices of kings, heroes and prophetical personages.

This paper has been translated into French in the \"Revue de L'Histoire des Religions\" of 1897.\nand social existence, putting their own interpretations on the phenomena of nature and the wants of the human soul. The more modern of them, though still very ancient, mark a growing estrangement from one another of the two branches of the Arian nation, the Indian and Persian.\"\n\nThe question is, what is the order of evolution? Is it the one suggested by Westergaard, i.e., Do these legends begin with \"traditions of a primitive era of physical and moral bliss\" and \"with aspirations for a renewal of happiness, both in the present and future life\" and end in their so-called \"corruption in the interpretation of them as historical notices of kings, heroes and prophetical personages\"? Or, do they begin with historical personages, and after some period, end with an interpretation of them as illustrations of moral principles? I am inclined to agree with those who take the latter view.\n\nThis paper of Prof. Westergaard, presents a few of the results of his study of comparative mythology,\u2014a study begun long before him by Dr. Roth and others, and followed by Dr. Spiegel. We have referred (pp. 203 et seq.) to Spiegel's comparisons in this line, in our remarks on Rev. Murray Mitchell's paper, entitled \"Recent Investigations in Zend Literature.\" Roth had already said, a few years ago, as pointed out by Westergaard, that Yima was \"the symbolic representation of the golden age, with all the blessings of abundance and peace.\" Westergaard agrees with him in this view, and says something more. He says: \"Yima certainly is the symbolic representation of the golden age, or (as every man has his golden age, however short it may be) the symbolical emblem of the happiest time of man, the brightest state of life, but only as far as this depends on the earthly or material well-being, furnished by the physical blessings of nature; because Yima, being, as we may remember, unable to bestow on man the holy word, or knowledge of God, he could not be the symbolical expression of that happiness which is unattainable without that knowledge. The same original idea was, in my opinion, connected by the Indians with their Yama; he, too, likewise, was a symbolical representation of the golden age, an emblem of the happiest and brightest state of man. But, though the Hindu embraced life and its blessings with as much loving attachment as all other earthly creatures, he was less ensnared by its pleasures; for his depth of thought, and serious disposition of mind, led him to form a more correct estimate of the transitory nature of earthly enjoyment. His attention was, therefore, turned to the life beyond death: it was there he sought for, and there first he found his real\n\n1 Abstract given in Journal, B. B. R. A. S., V., p. 385.\n2 Journal, B. B. R. A. S. IV, pp. 215-41.\n3 Ibid. V, p. 80.\nhome. . . . There, and there only, he found the real golden age.\"\u00b9\n\nWe have quoted Westergaard at some length, to show, that, what one can infer from this passage is this, that while the Iranian's was a practical frame of mind, the Indian's was a contemplative or dreamy frame of mind. Prof. Max M\u00fcller says about the contemplative mind of the Hindu: \"The Aryan nations who pursued a north-westerly direction, stand before us in history as the principal nations of north-western Asia and Europe. They have been the prominent actors in the great drama of history, and have carried to their fullest growth all the elements of active life with which our nature is endowed. . . . His (Hindu's) mind was like the lotus leaf after a shower of rain has passed over it; his character remained the same, passive, meditative, quiet, and thoughtful. . . . The ancient Hindus were a nation of philosophers.\"\u00b2\n\nLegends have generally a framework or foundation of historical truth under them. In whatever light you look to the legend of the Ir\u00e2anian Yima or Jamshed, you find, that in the Ir\u00e2anian literature, he is made to act on the plane of this world. It is the Indian mind that has raised Yama to the plane of the other world. Yima was a mortal in the eye of an Ir\u00e2anian. It were the Indians, who exalted Yama to the higher heavens and made him a god. So, in all such cases, when you consider, whether the heroes of such Ir\u00e2anian legends really existed or not at one time, you must not be guided by what is said of them in the Vedic literature, but you must look to them only from the standpoint of Ir\u00e2anian literature. The contemplative mind of a Hindu may have latterly raised the personage to a higher plane. I have alluded to this point in my remarks on the \"Legend of Feridun,\" referred to by Rev. Murray Mitchel, in his paper\u00b3 based on the account of Feridun's legend sent to him by Spiegel.\n\nThe fact, that in India, some of the heroes of these legends are raised to the dignity of \"gods,\" has led some to take the view held by Westergaard. But the ways of looking to life in both these countries are different. It is the contemplative mind of a Hindu, and it is his dreamy, speculative, philosophic thoughts that have led him to exalt these mortals into gods. But the practical mind of an Ir\u00e2anian has never raised them to that dignity.\n\nProfessor Jackson refers to a similar subject in a short note entitled \"On Mah\u00e2-Bh\u00e2rata III, 142. 35\u201445, an Echo of an old Hindu-Persian legend,\" in the American Oriental Society's Proceedings (April 1896, Vol. XVII, pp. 185-87). Therein, he says, that in this matter \"Persia may serve to throw a side-light upon the Mah\u00e2-Bh\u00e2rata (p. 185).\"\n\n\u00b9 Ibid., pp. 80-81.\n\u00b2 Max M\u00fcller's Chips from a German Workshop (2nd Edition, 1880), Vol. I, pp. 61-66.\n\u00b3 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., IV, pp. 216-41. Vide supra, p. 205.\nAnyhow, the whole of Westergaard\u2019s article is very interesting for those, who want to compare the picture of old Arian heroes, as given in the Ir\u00e2ni\u00e2n literature, with that given in the Indian literature. \u201cLook to this picture and to that,\u201d and form your opinion about the question, as to how legends are evolved. His paper is, as it were, a paper on \u201cThe Evolution of Legends.\u201d He connects the several separate stories and unites them into a whole. He says: \u201cThese natural fables, which I have severally examined,\u2014these mythological representations of the condition and movements of nature and mankind,\u2014assumed, in the course of time, a more sensible, bodily, and human shape; and thus Jemshid, Feridun, Gersh\u00e2sp merely appear as purely human kings and earthly heroes in the later traditional history of Persia. . . . They really combine to compose one idea, being the several parts of one image, under which the ancient Ir\u00e2ni\u00e2n, twenty-five centuries or more ago, tried to represent their views of the earthly happiness and physical welfare of man, of the contending powers of nature contributive to, or destructive of, his happiness, and of the combat necessary to secure it and restore it when lost by man\u2019s own transgression.\u201d\n\nJournal, V, pp. 95-108, 20th January 1853.\n\nIn this paper, Romer tries to show, that the connections of the Persian, properly so-called, in which Firdousi and other subsequent authors wrote, with the other old languages of Ir\u00e2n (viz., Zend, the language of the Achemenian Inscriptions, the Sassanian Pahlavi of the Inscriptions of H\u00e2ji\u00e2b\u00e2d and other places, the Pahlavi of books, the Pazend, and the language of the Des\u00e2t\u00eer) \u201care exceedingly remote and insignificant, and by no means of the character long alleged by the able and zealous Orientalists of the Continent.\u201d\n\nAs to the Zend, he disputes its claim to genuineness \u201cas resting on insufficient grounds, particularly as no vestiges of it as a language ever spoken can be found; its historical connections cannot be traced; its structure and form are entirely diverse from the Persian, especially in its having inflexions, while the Persian has none; its literature is frivolous and absurd in its character; and its undoubted relations to the Sanskrit seem artificial and suspicious.\u201d\n\nThough, nearly half a century had elapsed, since Sir W. Jones doubted the authenticity of the Zend, and though philologists, like Bopp and Burnouf, had tried to prove the authenticity and antiquity of the\n\n1 Ibid., V., p. 91.\n2 Romer\u2019s views as summed up by Wilson. Journal, B. B. R. A. S., V., p. 95.\n3 Ibid., J., B. B. R. A. S., V., p. 95.\nAvesta, still there were some Orientalists, who continued to doubt its authenticity and antiquity. Among those, one was Mr. Romer. He seems to have depended much upon his knowledge of modern Persian. Of that knowledge also, he does not seem to have made great use. For example, in his arguments against the antiquity of the Zend Avesta, he quotes Kennedy, who also depended for his views upon his knowledge of Persian and not upon that of Zend itself. Romer thus quotes Kennedy in his support. \"But the sole authority on which the Zend and Pahlavi books depend is the tradition of the Parsis. Before, however, these traditions can be admitted as testimony, it must be satisfactorily proved that the Zendavesta and its Pahlavi translation actually existed at the time of the Arabian conquest, and that they have been carefully preserved until the present day by the Parsis of Persia and India. But no proof has ever been adduced, nor has it been yet established, that the Parsis of either country possess any well-authenticated traditions, which ascend uninterruptedly to that event. On the contrary, the silence of Tabari and Firdausi respecting them is a strong presumption that they were not invented at the time when these writers lived.\"\u00b9\n\nWe are surprised to find from this passage, how little use, both Kennedy and Romer, have made of their knowledge of Persian, because Firdousi has not, as said by them, remained silent, but has, on the other hand, made more than one reference to the fact, that the Zendavesta was prevalent in the times of the ancient Iranian kings. For example, Firdousi carries back the existence of the Zend Avesta, even to the time of Feridun. He says\u00b2:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0641\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0627\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0622\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0632\u064e \u0627\u0650\u0632\u064e\u0622\u0646\u064e \u06a9\u064f\u0631\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0628\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064e \u06a9\u064e\u0631\u064e \u06a9\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0632\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u06cc\u062f\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0622\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0628\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064e} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0622\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064e \u062f\u0631\u064e \u06a9\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0632\u064e \u0622\u064e\u062a\u0634\u064e\u06a9\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0628\u0647\u064e \u0632\u064e\u0646\u062f\u064e\u0648\u0627\u064e\u0633\u064e\u062a\u0627\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0622\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064e} \\]\n\nTranslation.\u2014He took his residence there, because Feridun had built (this) Kandez. He had built a fire-temple in Kandez and had written the Zend Avesta in gold over it (i.e., over its walls).\n\nFirdousi refers to the Zend Avesta more than once (Vide in Mohl VII, p. 762, the word Zend Avesta). Again, Tabari also is not silent over this matter. He speaks of Zoroaster bringing the Zend Avesta in the court of King Gushtasp.\u00b3\n\nAgain, Firdousi now and then speaks of the Pahlavi language, and gives the Pahlavi renderings of some of the words he uses. For example, while speaking of Zoh\u00e2k, he refers to his other name, Ba\u00eavar-\n\n\u00b9 Ibid., p. 100. \u00b2 Mohl IV., p. 22, ll. 223-23. \u00b3 Tabari par Zotenberg I., pp. 499-500.\n\n\"II leur apporta un livre qu'ils appellent Zendavesta\" (p. 499).

Thus, we see, that both Firdousi and Tabari are not silent about the Zend Avesta and the Pahlavi.\n\nAgain, Romer's and Kennedy's belief about the modern Persian, that \"it dates from remote antiquity\" and is \"in exactly the same state at the present day as it was three thousand years ago,\" may now-a-days be taken as a myth. There are several other statements of that kind in the paper. Mr. K. R. Cama has refuted, in his (Jartoshti Abhyas) Jartoshti Abhyas (i.e., Zoroastrian Studies), some of the views of Romer expressed in this paper, and also those of Kennedy* on the subject of the Zend language.\n\nDr. Wilson had relinquished his early impressions, about the Zend Avesta being a fabrication, and was, later on, satisfied, that it was genuine. Romer hopes that he may reconsider the matter and come back to his earlier impressions. He says: \"It is to be regretted that Dr. Wilson, remembering Kennedy's filiation of certain languages from Babylonian or Sanskrit, to the exclusion of Persian, did not abide by and work out his earliest impressions as to whence the fabricators of Zend drew the materials for their work. But as he has relinquished faith in the authenticity of Pehlivi, as will appear presently, he may possibly undertake the task of a careful re-examination of the points which have satisfied him as to the genuineness of Zend.\"\n\nWith reference to this hope, to reconsider his views, Dr. Wilson states in his remarks on this paper, that his views of the Zend remained unchanged and were \"founded, not only on the analogies which it bears to most of the languages of the Indo-Germanic family, both near and remote, but also on various, though brief, geographical and historical allusions which it contains, and on certain analogies, and at the same time antagonisms, to the oldest forms of Hinduism, which it expresses.\"\n\nWe find from a subsequent volume of the Journal of our Society (Vol. VI., Abstract of the Society's Proceedings, 10th September 1857, p. xxxviii), that Romer had, later on, published a paper, entitled \"The Pahlavi of the Zend Avesta\" in French in the Revue de l'Orient. In a letter dated 18th July 1857, with which he sends a copy of that Journal to our Society, he repeats his views and says: \"It may not be doubted that remains of writings extant in the fifth century, when the Armenian Bishop Essick carried on a religious controversy with the Persian Magi, have, as shown by their agreement, furnished materials for the composition of some parts of the sacred books of the Parsis,\n\n---\n\n2 Mohl I., p. 56. 3 J., B.

At this conviction I have arrived after diligent, but, from circumstances, somewhat desultory search for truth.\"\n\nBooks of Mahomedan history have said, that Caliph Omar had ordered the destruction of all Parsee books. The Parsees say, that Alexander the Great also had done the same. Romer attributes this, to the ignorance of historical facts among the Parsees of his time, and thinks that they gradually transferred the event, which happened at one time (the time of Arabian Conquest), to another time (the time of Macedonian Conquest). He says: \"By the modern Parsis, however, whose notions of history may be judged by the fact, this devastation of the learning and religious books of their ancestors is attributed to Alexander.\"\n\nWell, it is not a case of transference of an event from one time to another. As a matter of fact, the event happened at both the times. The Parsees have the authority of their ancient Pahlavi books, some of them written before the Arab Conquest, to say that Alexander destroyed their old books. He burnt one of their big State libraries, and his Greeks carried away, for translation, most of the books of another library. Their Pahlavi books speak of this destruction in Alexander's time, and the Mahomedan books speak of the destruction at the time of the Arab conquest.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., V., pp. 478-91.

A. S., Vol. V., p. 478.\n4 Ibid.\nThe Society was very fortunate in hearing this discourse from the lips of that very great man, who has shed a lustre upon the names of great English discoverers and travellers in Western Asia. Sir Henry Rawlinson illustrated his lecture, by exhibiting on the table of the Society, before he took them to England, \"a collection of antiquities which he had lately obtained in Chaldea, Assyria and Babylonia... They... were intended to illustrate three distinct periods of history. I. The most ancient class was Chaldean; II. the second was Assyrian; III. and the third was Babylonian.\" Some of these antiquities seem to have been left by Rawlinson in the Museum of our Society. I will refer to them later on.\n\nI. The Assyrian monuments showed the interval between Ismi-Dagon of the known Chaldean kings and Senacherib to be 1150 years. This Ismi-Dagon, however, was not the first monarch of the time, being preceded by several others, one of whom was Kadur Mapula, who was identified with the Chedorlaomer of the Scriptures.\n\nII. The second class of relics exhibited \"belonged to the Assyrian period, which extended from the thirteenth century B.C. to the capture of Nineveh in about B.C. 625.... During the long period of Chaldean supremacy, Assyria occupied a very subordinate place in the civil polity of the East... It was not probable that the Assyrians, like the Persians of a later age, had made a sudden stride from dependence to universal dominion.... It was at the commencement of the 9th century B.C., shortly after the building of Samaria, that the Assyrians first undertook the subjugation of the countries on the Mediterranean; and from that period to the extinction of the empire, the annals of Nineveh, running in a parallel line with Jewish history, presented a series of notices, which established in the most conclusive manner the authenticity of the Hebrew Scriptures.\"\n\nWe note in Rawlinson's description of the monuments of the Assyrian empire, that some of the rulers of that dynasty mutilated and defaced the monuments of their predecessors. I think, that Darius, the Achemenian king, must have become aware of this disgraceful conduct on the part of some of the kings of the dynasties and of the countries, who had, at one time, held sway over his country, and, it is for this reason, that he was so careful for inscribing his exploits on the mountain of Behistun, at a height not easily accessible. Not only that, but he blessed, in the best way possible, and in the spirit of some of the benedictions of the Avesta, those who looked after, and took care of his inscriptions, and cursed, in the worst way possible, and also in the spirit and in the language of some passages of the Avesta, those who muti-\n\n1 Ibid. 2 Journal, B.B.R.A.S., V., pp. 479-80.\nlated his inscriptions. Here is an instance of his benediction and curse for those, who preserved, and for those, who destroyed his inscriptions. We give these in the words of the translation of Rawlinson himself.\u00b9\n\nHe thus blesses those, who may bring his tablets to the notice of the public instead of concealing them.\n\n\"If thou publish this tablet to the world, Ormazd shall be a friend to thee, and may thy offspring be numerous, and may thou be long-lived.\"\u00b2\n\nHe thus curses those who may conceal his records: \"If thou shalt conceal this record, thou shalt not be thyself recorded, may Ormazd be thy enemy, and may thou be childless.\"\u00b3\n\nAmong the relics, the most important were, according to Rawlinson, those of the time of Asshur-bani-pal, and they were \"the inscribed clay tablets of baked clay forming portions of the Royal Library. The number of these tablets already exhumed could not be less than 10,000, and they appeared to embrace every branch of science known to the ancient Assyrians. They were especially valuable in affording explanations of the Assyrian system of writing, one class of them . . . . showing how the original pictorial figures had been degraded to characters, while others contained tables expressing the different syllabic values which were attached to each character, and a third class again presented elaborate lists of all the simple and compound ideographs of the language with their phonetic equivalents . . . . Without their aid . . . . the inscriptions would have continued to the present time to be for the most part unintelligible.\"\u2074\n\nIII. Coming to the Babylonian period of history, Rawlinson exhibited some original relics of this period, and said that \"the united armies of the Medes and Babylonians, defeated, in about B.C. 625, the last king of Nineveh, Asshur-ebid-ilut.\"\u2075 Most of the Babylonian relics in the museums of Europe belonged to Nebuchadnezzar\u2076 (the son of Nabopolassar, who first won the victory over the Assyrians, and founded the Babylonian rule) who came to throne in B.C. 606.\n\nNow, we find from Persian books, that this Nebuchadnezzar was a general of king Lohr\u0101sp, the Aurvat-aspa of the Avesta, the father of Gusht\u0101sp, in whose reign Zoroaster is said to have flourished. Ma\u00e7oudi\u2077 says, that, according to some, he was a lieutenant of\n\n\u00b9 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. X. Part III.

He further says:\u2014\"Plusieurs auteurs bien instruits de l'histoire de la Perse pr\u00e9tendent que Bokht-Nassar (Nebuchadnessar) fut le merzeb\u00e2n (\u0645\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646) de Bohra\u1e63f (Lohr\u0101sp), dans l'Irak et l'Occident, qu'il envahit la Syrie, prit J\u00e9rusalem et emmena les Isra\u00e9lites en captivit\u00e9 (Ibid., II, pp. 121-122).\nLohr\u0101sp. Tabari also says that Nebuchadnezzar was a general of Lohr\u0101sp. Now Babylonian history says that Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed Jerusalem. We have a reference to its destruction in the Palhavi Minokherad, but, there, we do not find the name of Nebuchadnezzar as that of the destroyer of Jerusalem, but that of king Lohr\u0101sp, whose general he was. The Minokherad says of king Lohr\u0101sp (Kai Lohr\u0101sp):\n\nAurisalam-i-Yahud\u00e2n bar\u00e2 afrunt va Yahud\u00e2n vash\u016bpt\u00ea va par-gandeh kard, i.e., He destroyed the Jerusalem of the Jews, and dispersed and scattered the Jews.

The temple was \u201claid out in conformity with the Chaldean Planetary system, seven stages being erected one above the other, according to the order of the seven planets, and their stages being coloured after the hue of the planets to which they were respectively dedicated. Thus the lower stage belonging to Saturn was black; the second sacred to Jupiter was orange; the third or that of Mars, was red; the fourth of the Sun, golden; the fifth of Venus, white; the sixth, of Mercury, blue; and the seventh, of the Moon, a silvery green.\u201d This temple was \u201cbuilt by King Merodoch-adan-akhi at the close of the 12th Century B.C.\u201d and repaired by Nebuchadnezzar in about B.C. 580.\n\nThen Rawlinson draws special attention to \u201can isolated example... totally at variance with ancient usage\u201d wherein \u201ctwo kings reigned at the same time in Babylon.\u201d Nabodius, the father, had raised his son Bel-shar-ezer (Belshazzar of Daniel) to the throne during his lifetime.\n\nWe note with satisfaction, that Rawlinson acknowledges in his lecture his obligations for the aid he had received from our Society\u2019s \u201cextensive library.\u201d\n\nThe great importance, attached to Rawlinson\u2019s discoveries and researches at the time by devout Christians, was thus expressed by\n\n1 Tabari par Zotenberg I. pp. 491-492. Partie, I., Chap. CV.\n2 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. V., p. 485.\n3 Ibid.\n4 Ibid., p. 489.\n5 Ibid.\nDr. Wilson at the time. \"The great fact, that they went so far as they did to corroborate and illustrate the Hebrew scriptures, tended much to the confirmation and extended appreciation of those historical records, which, originally written by the pen of inspiration, were so dear to all our hearts.\"\n\nThe Parsis attach the same importance to Rawlinson's discoveries from their point of view. These discoveries bring to vivid light, the history of their Achemenian kings, and supply materials to judge for them, in addition to the writings of Herodotus and other classical writers. They give us some clear glimpses into their religion.\n\nWhether these Achemenian kings were real Zoroastrians or not, is a question of some difference of opinion. The general opinion is, that they were Zoroastrians. Among those, who hold that the religion of the Achemenians was different from that taught by the Avesta and observed by the Sassanians, though they all adored Ahura Mazda, we find the names of Spiegel, Harlez, Casartelli and several others.\n\nThe late M. Harlez, in the introduction to his \"Avesta, Livre Sacr\u00e9 du Zoroastisme,\" says, that the two religions were separate. He says \"on pense g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que l'Avesta \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 la code religieux de l'empire de Darius . . . . Un examen approfondi de la mati\u00e8re nous autorise, pensons nous, \u00e0 affirmer que rien ne justifie cette assimilation, que tous les faits concourent \u00e0 en d\u00e9montrer la fausset\u00e9.\" We have a separate article from M. Harlez on the subject, entitled \"La religion persane sous les Ach\u00e9m\u00e9nides.\"\n\nRev. Dr. Casartelli's paper on the subject is worth reading. He presents a summary of the religious ideas\u2014both dogmatic and moral\u2014expressed in the Achemenian inscriptions, and leaves the readers to judge for themselves. He himself seems to be of opinion, that the Achemenian religion is not the same as the Zoroastrian. The chief ground, on which he seems to rest, is the silence observed in the inscriptions, but several doctrines characteristic of the Zoroastrian religion, but, he very wisely adds, that silence in such matters is not a safe guide. \"Cependant, il ne faut pas oublier qu'il est souvent dangereux d'insister trop sur les arguments a silentio, et qu'il convient de les employer avec beaucoup de circonspection.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid., p. 491.\n2 Introduction, pp. IX\u2014XVIII.\n3 Ibid., p. 9.\n4 \"La Religion des Rois Ach\u00e9m\u00e9nides d'apr\u00e8s leurs Inscriptions\" (1895) read before the Third Scientific International Congress of the Catholics (Congr\u00e8s Scientifique International des Catholiques) held at Brussels from 3rd to 8th September 1894.\n5 Ibid., p. 4.\n6 Ibid., p. 13.\nDr. West is of opinion, that the religion of the Achemenians is the same as that of the Zoroastrians. He calls the Avesta, as we have them now, \"the last remnants of the faith held by Cyrus . . . scattered fragments of the creed professed by Darius in his inscriptions, when he attributes his successes to 'the will of A\u00fbramazd\u0101'.\"\n\nProf. Jackson seems to be of opinion, that the later Achemenians were Zoroastrians. His paper on \"The Religion of the Achaemenian Kings\" is very interesting for a study of this question. The object of that paper is to undertake a research on the subject \"not with the expectation of making clear all points connected with the Achaemenian faith, nor with the idea of determining whether the Achaemenidae were true Zoroastrians or not; but the investigation is made with an eye to bringing together the material relating to the Achaemenian creed as fully as possible, and with a hope that perhaps some hints may be given to students with regard to the relation of the Ancient Persian kings to Zoroastrianism.\"\n\nDr. Jackson's pupil, Dr. Gray, examines the question, in the appendix to his teacher's paper, from the non-Iranian Inscriptions. He thinks that Cyrus was \"a da\u0113vayasnian and not a masdayasnian\" and that \"Cambyses can scarcely be regarded as a Zoroastrian.\" With regard to Darius, he has some reluctance \"to consider him a genuine Zoroastrian.\" Dr. Gray finishes by saying, that, \"A conclusion as to the religion of the Achaemenians drawn solely from a study of their non-Iranian inscriptions seems hardly favourable to the view that these monarchs were Zoroastrians. But an exact decision cannot be reached from such texts alone. Only by a synthesis of all data on this mooted problem can we hope even to approximate the truth.\"\n\nI have treated this subject in a short paper before the \"Zarthoshti-din-ni-khol-Karn\u0101ri-Mandli.\" The scholars, who have treated this subject, have not paid any special attention to the forms of prayer, adopted by Darius in his Inscriptions. I think, that the following words of prayer, used by Darius, have their very close parallels in the Avesta, and\n\n1 S. B.

The result was, that the Trustees of the Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Translation Fund, had, on the 16th of August 1858, advertised for a Prize Essay, in Gujar\u00e2ti, on the subject of the decipherment and translation of these Inscriptions. The prize (Rs. 500) was won by the late Mr. Jehangier Burjorji V\u00e2ch\u00e2, who was, for several years, the Honorary Auditor of our Society. It was published, in 1863, under the title of \"The Discoveries by Europeans on Ir\u00e2anian Cuneiform Inscriptions.\"\n\n---\n\n1 At Naksh-\u00ee-Rustam. Rawlinson, Journal, R. A.

One special feature of one of Mr. Cama\u2019s papers is, that he has rendered one\\(^2\\) of the Cuneiform Inscriptions into the Avesta\\(^3\\) language, to show, that both the languages are similar, or, as it were, sister languages. I find, that Dr. Geldner has latterly followed the same course, in his article on \u201cPersian (Iranian) languages\u201d in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,\\(^4\\) to show that the Cuneiform language \u201cis almost as antique as Zend, with which it has many points in common.\u201d\\(^5\\) Dr. Geldner also, has taken the same inscription of Darius for his rendering into the Avesta. He has treated only a small part, while Mr. Cama has treated a large part of the inscription. Their renderings differ in this, that while Mr. Cama has tried to reproduce the Avesta in the phraseology of the Avesta itself, and so, has coined some of the words, Dr. Geldner has used only the Avesta words, found in the extant Avesta. For example, for the Cuneiform word hya (i.e., who), Mr. Cama has coined a similar word hy\u00f4 (\\(^\\text{h}^\\text{o}\\)), while Dr. Geldner has given the word y\u00f4 (\\(^\\text{y}^\\text{o}\\)), which is actually in use.

Oppert's proposition, the old Bactrian\u2014and the Sanskrit; and the only difference exists with reference to the antiquity of the old Bactrian. Professor Burnouf takes it to be a very old language, and maintains that not the language only, but even the literary productions of the P\u0101rsis in it, belong to a time not so much later than that in which the language of the Vedas was spoken. Burnouf's opinion has been adopted by almost all the continental scholars. Colonel Rawlinson, on the contrary, assures us that Burnouf's arguments have altogether failed to convince him of the close affinity between the Vedic Sanskrit and the old Bactrian, and he maintains that the Ach\u00e6menian dialect is the parent of the language of the Avesta. For my own part, although I do not deny that there are fragments of very old writings incorporated in the Avesta, I am inclined to side with Col. Rawlinson, in so far that I presume the Avesta to have been written down, as a whole, in a period much later than the reign of Xerxes or Darius. The comparative purity of the language is easily accounted for, for it is a well-known fact that language degenerates by long usage, and that literary pursuits have by no means a favourable influence on the language itself. Now the old Bactrians were, as Strabo testifies, but little better than Nomads, and therefore by no means a literary nation. The art of writing was entirely unknown or at least very little used, in Bactria; in the old times, before the invasion of Alexander, all the literary compositions were retained by memory. In the Avesta itself writing is never mentioned, but it is always enjoined to keep the single parts of it in memory and to recite them. Therefore, I think, the Avesta must have been written down at a comparatively late period, after the invasion of Alexander. . . . . I do not deny that a good many parts of the book are old, and must have been current a considerable time before they were committed to writing. In many and essential points the precepts of the Avesta entirely agree with the manners and institutions of the old Persians as related to us by the classical writers. Only one must not expect that everything should be alike. The fatherland of the Avesta, as is generally believed for weighty reasons, is to be sought for in the neighbourhood of Bactria, and the difference of the country accounts for the difference of religious and political institutions, even if these, taken as a whole, were nearly the same.\"\n\n\"At what time and how these religious writings of the old Bactrians first extended their influence beyond their native boundaries,\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., V., pp. 493-94.\"\nand were accepted as the sacred writings of the western part of Persia, I cannot tell.\"\n\nThe latest consensus of opinion on the subject of the relation, in which the Avesta stands to Sanskrit, and on the subject of its antiquity, seems to be that, summed up by Prof. Geldner, in his article on the \"Language and Literature of Persia\" in the last edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. We know, that scholars, like the late M. Harlez and M. Darmesteter have differed from Dr. Geldner's views, but Geldner's are the generally accepted views, which have found a supporter in another well-known German scholar, Dr. Geiger. Dr. Geldner's words are worth quoting here, as giving the general views prevalent at present.\n\n\"Not only amongst Iranian languages, but amongst all the languages of the Indo-European group, Zend takes one of the very highest places in importance for the comparative philologist. In age it almost rivals Sanskrit; in primitiveness it surpasses that language in many points; it is inferior only in respect of its less extensive literature. . . . The view which became current through Anquetil du Perron that the Avesta is throughout the work of Zoroaster, the founder of the religion, has long been abandoned as untenable. But the opposite view, which is now frequently accepted, that not a single word in the book can lay claim to the authorship of Zoroaster, also appears, on closer study, too sweeping. In the Avesta two stages of the language are plainly distinguishable. . . . The older is represented in but a small part of the whole work, the so-called G\u0101th\u0101s or songs. . . . These G\u0101th\u0101s are what they claim to be, and what they are honoured in the whole Avesta as being,\u2014the actual productions of the prophet himself or of his time. They bear in themselves irrefutable proofs of their authenticity, bringing us face to face not with the Zoroaster of the legends but with a real person, announcing a new doctrine and way of salvation, no supernatural Being assured of victory, as he is represented in later times, but a mere man, often himself despairing of his final success, and struggling not with spirits and demons but with human conflicts of every sort, in the midst of a society of fellow-believers which was yet feeble and in its earliest infancy. It is almost impossible that a much later period could have produced such unpretentious and almost depreciatory representations of the deeds and personality of the prophet; certainly nothing of the kind is found\n\n1 Ibid., p. 494. 2nd edition.

If, then, the G\u0101th\u0101s reach back to the time of Zoroaster, and he himself, according to the most probable estimate, lived as early as the fourteenth century B.C., the oldest component parts of the Avesta are hardly inferior in age to the oldest Vedic hymns.\"\u00b9\n\nComing to the Pahlavi language, Spiegel says, that it is considered \"as a forgery by many learned men; and this opinion is not wholly without foundation, but certainly much exaggerated.\"\u00b2 That it is exaggerated, is proved by the fact, that the language of the coins of the late Sassanian kings is shown to be the same as the Pahlavi, \"in which the translation of the Avesta is written.\"\u00b3 So it must be a spoken language at that time. But, to this, it is objected, that the Pahlavi contains a good number of Arabic words, a fact which shows, that the language is not as old as that of the Sassanian times, but is one of later date, i.e., of the time after the Arab conquest. To this objection, Spiegel replies, that there are no Arabic words \"in the genuine old Pahlavi writings, vis., the translations of the Vendidad and the Ya\u00e7na.\"\u2074 Anquetil gives, in a column in the second volume of his Zend Avesta (pp. 433-521), a glossary of Zend words, with their Pahlavi equivalents in the second column and their French equivalents as rendered from the Persian or Arabic equivalents given by his tutor, in the third column. Now, in this second column of Pahlavi equivalents, some Arabic words are found, but Spiegel attributes their presence to an inadvertance on the part of Anquetil, in placing, while preparing his original list, the Persian or Arabic equivalents in the second (Pahlavi) column instead of in the third. \"In removing the Arabic words,\" he says, \"we remove at the same time the principal reason for doubting the authenticity and the age of the language.\"\u2075\n\nAgain, there are a number of Semitic words in the Pahlavi which are similar to Arabic. But they \"belong to an Aramaic dialect. That the Aramaic was spoken in the times of the Sasanian kings and understood by themselves, is a well-known fact.\"\u2076\n\nAgain, the authenticity of the Pahlavi was doubted on the ground \"that the Ir\u0101nian words in it, as well as the grammatical structure itself, are so very like to the Persian.\"\u2077 Spiegel's answer to this objection is, that \"a large number of Persian words, gleaned from the earlier Armenian authors, show satisfactorily enough, that, so early as the third century of our era, the Persian language was nearly on the same level with the language of Firdosi.\"\u2078 But, notwithstanding all this, Spiegel is of opinion, that the Pahlavi language was never spoken \"in the form we have it before us. Aramaic words could\n\n\u00b9 Encyc. Britt. (9th edition), XVIII, pp. 653, 654. \u2078 Journal, B. B. R. A.

It is merely the language of books . . . the official style in the edicts of the later Sasanian kings.\"\n\nNow, in what part of the country, the Pahlavi had its origin? It was in Sev\u00e2d, the modern Irak Arabi, whose inhabitants are reported by Ibn Mokaffa, a Parsi convert to Mahomedanism, to have \"used in their correspondence a kind of style where Persian and Syriac were mixed together.\"2 \"This country was inhabited by a mixed population, partly Persians, partly Nabat\u00e6ans. (The Nabateans spoke a corrupted Aramaic dialect). Both languages, the Aramaic and the Persian, were therefore known to the people of that country; the Aramaic was, moreover, the medium by which the literary and commercial communications of Persia with the western provinces were maintained.\"\n\nIn support of this statement, Spiegel refers to the similar words of the Pahlavi, which, he says, belong not only to the Aramaic tongue \"but also to the eastern branch of it (to which the Nabat\u00e6ans belonged, according to the testimony of Barhebr\u00e6us and other Syriac grammarians) . . . . The Persians were in the habit of visiting the Syriac Academy at Edessa and got all their learning from the Syrians.\"4\n\n\"After the downfall of the Sasanian Empire, not only the old Persian religion declined, but the high authority of Aramaic learning also ceased, and was soon supplanted by the Arabic tongue and literature. The bulk of the Persian nation was converted to Islamism, and even the few Parsis who remained in Persia forgot by degrees the spelling of the Aramaic words, and, only anxious to retain the signification of the word, they pronounced the Persian word instead of the Aramaic one. For instance, if they found written in their text the Aramaic word *lahma*, \"bread,\" they pronounced *n\u00e2n*, the Persian synonym for it. By this fact is explained how the Parsis could ever forget the right spelling of the Aramaic words in Pahlavi. It is again Ibn Mokaffa who makes us aware of the proceeding just mentioned.\"5\n\nWith reference to the writer, Barhebr\u00e6us, referred to by Spiegel, I may draw the attention of my readers to his work, recently translated and published, by Dr. Budge, under the name of \"Oriental Wit and Wisdom.\" This book shows, that the author was much conversant with Persian literature. He gives several Persian tales and sayings.\n\n1 Ibid., p. 495. 2 Ibid., p. 495. 3 Ibid., p. 496. 4 Ibid., p. 496.\n\n* Vide Mr. K. R.

This review is more exhaustive than the two preceding ones, referred to by him in this paper. At the conclusion of the proceedings of the meeting, where this paper was read, Lord Elphinstone, the Patron of the Society, while moving a resolution of thanks to the learned author of the paper, expressed his satisfaction at the work done by the Society.\n\nDr. Wilson begins his review with the literature of the Zoroastrians. He refers to the following publications on this subject:\n\n1. His book on \"The Parsi Religion\" dedicated to the office-bearers and members of the Society (1843).\n\n2. His Persian \"Zarthusht-N\u00e2mah.\" This book has been translated into English by Mr. E. B. Eastwick. The translation is published in the appendix (A.) of Dr. Wilson's \"The Parsi Religion\" (pp. 477-522).\n\n3. \"The Vandid\u00e2d, Ya\u00e7na and Visparad of the Avasta, in the Zend language but Gujar\u00e2ti character, and with a Gujar\u00e2ti Translation, Commentary, and Paraphrase, by the late Fr\u00e2mj\u00ee Aspandi\u00e2rj\u00ee.\" It was published by the Society at a cost of about two to three thousand rupees from a manuscript copy purchased by Dr. Wilson for about Rs. 500 from the late Fardunji Murzbanji in 1835.\n\n4.

Spiegel's edition of the Zend Avesta with translation which was being prepared and printed.\n\n6. Rev. Murray Mitchell's papers, giving the abstracts of papers on Zend literature published in Europe.\n\nIn this paper, Dr. Wilson quotes, at some length, Westergaard's views, from the preface of his edition of the Zend Avesta, on the antiquity of the Zend Avesta, on the Pahlavi language, and on such cog-\n\n---\n\n1 The first was contained in his address to the Society on 27th January 1836, and the second, a very short one, was contained in his letter of resignation as President, on his going to Europe, at the end of the year 1844 (Journal, B.

Dr. Wilson had Westergaard, as it were, for his guru for guidance on Iranian subjects, while Rev. Murray Mitchell had Spiegel. He agrees entirely \"with the general view of matters\" expressed by Westergaard about the antiquity of the Avesta.\n\nIn this volume (the fifth), we have, side by side, the views of Spiegel communicated in two consecutive months (October and November 1855), through Rev. Murray Mitchell, and the views of Westergaard, communicated through Rev. Dr. Wilson. In some points they are diametrically opposed. For example, Spiegel says of the Pahlavi, that the Pahlavi language of the translation of the Avesta is the same as that on the coins. He says: \"A large number of coins, which have been so assiduously collected and so skilfully explained by such men as Olshausen, Thomas, and Mordtmann bear undoubtedly inscriptions in the same language in which the translation of the Avesta is written.\" Again, Spiegel considers this identical Pahlavi\u2014the Pahlavi of the coins and the Pahlavi of the writings\u2014to be Aryan, though latterly mixed with similar words of the Aramaic language. Now, Westergaard, as referred to in the paper read by Dr. Wilson, differs from him altogether. He considers the language of the coins to be altogether different from the language of the translations, and he calls the former to be Semitic and the latter Aryan. He says: \"But the name Pehlevi, has, in so far as it concerns here, two distinct significations. The official language of the Sassanian kings was called Pehlevi and this is not any Iranian tongue, but, as far as I have been able to decipher it, a Semitic one, in two closely related dialects, with some intermixture of Persian words. As this idiom was the only one which the Sassanians employed on their coins, and in inscriptions placed not only at the western borders of their empire, but also in the very centre, at the ancient Persepolis, I scarcely doubt its being the only Pehlevi language of that age, the only one used in writing, and consequently opine everything composed in those days to have been indited in what I would call the Sassanian Pehlevi. But this Semitic language differs essentially from what Neriosangh (the Sanskrit translator of a part of the Avast\u00e2) calls Pehlevi (Pahlavi bh\u0101sh\u0101), which has, indeed, the same written character, but is by nature Iranian and particularly Persian. This is the proper Zand or commentary language; it is employed in the composition of several works long after the fall of the Sassanians, and has remained in use to this day.\"\n\nSpiegel is of opinion, that the Pahlavi translations of the Avesta, are of the Sassanian times, but Westergaard thinks, that they may belong \"to a period shortly before or after the fall of the Sassanians.\" Then he says: \"These translations may have been based upon older ones,\n\n1 Journal, B. R. A. S., V., p. 503. 2 Ibid, p. 494. 3 Ibid, p. 504. 4 Ibid, p. 505.\nindited in the Sassanian Pehlevi, whence also Semitic forms might have been taken.\"\n\nFor the latest view, generally accepted, on the Pahlavi language, I would refer my readers to Dr. Haug's Essays. For a comprehensive review of the Pahlavi literature, I would refer my readers to Dr. West's Essay on \"Pahlavi Literature\" in \"Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie.\"\n\nThe Zarthusht-n\u00e2meh, referred to by Dr. Wilson, has been often quoted by Anquetil du Perron in his Zend Avesta. In his Life of Zoroaster, given in this book, he has followed this Persian Zarthusht-n\u00e2meh. It appears, that Anquetil has translated this Persian Zarthusht-n\u00e2meh in Latin also. It exists in manuscript in Anquetil's papers in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale of Paris, and is referred to by M. Blochet in his catalogue of Parsee books in that library. The book has been translated into Gujar\u00e2ti by the late Dastur Dr. Peshotan Byr\u00e2mjee Sanj\u00e2n\u00e2 under the auspices of the Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Translation Fund under the charge of the Trustees of the Parsee Punch\u00e2yet.\n\nI would here draw the attention of my readers, to the latest book on the subject, published by M. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rosenberg, at St. Petersburg in 1904, under the title of \"Le Livre de Zoroastre (Zar\u00e2tusht N\u00e2ma) de Zartusht-i-Bahr\u00e2m Ben Pajd\u00fb.\" It is a very excellent book. It gives the Persian text of the Persian Zarthusht-n\u00e2meh, and then the Persian text of a part of the Dabist\u00e2n which treats of Zoroaster. It gives a translation into French with copious notes. The preface is interesting. It gives a list of technical Persian or Zoroastrian words.\n\nI would also draw the attention of my readers to the late M. Joachim Menant's \"Zoroastre. Essai sur la Philosophie religieuse de la Perse (1857),\" and to Mr. K. R. Cama's \"Life of Zoroaster\" (1870, 2nd edition, 1890). The first part of M. Menant's book presents what we may call, the traditional account of the life of Zoroaster, as presented by the Pahlavi and Persian books. Mr. Cama's book gives the account, as presented by the Avesta. Prof. Eug\u00e8ne Wilhelm's paper, entitled \"L'Exp\u00e9dition de Ninos et des Assyriens contre un roi de la Bactrie\" (Zoroastre) (1891) is worth reading in connection with this subject. Prof. Jackson's book \"Zoroaster the Prophet of Ir\u00e2n,\" will, for several years, remain as a standard work on the subject.\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A.

No. LXIX. 6, p. 106.\n6 A second edition of this book has been published in 1902 by Mr. Nusserw\u00e1n\u00edji Framji Bilimoria.\nIn this paper, the author describes the Legend of Tristan, as known in its supposed home, Britain, and gives the different versions of it, as it spread from one place to another. He points to it, as an instance of the common fact of \"the deification of the powers of nature.\" He thinks, that, at first, it was an Arian legend, and that it can be compared with that of Feridun in the Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2meh. The legend, as described by Mr. Leith, runs as follows:\n\n\"Tristan of Lyonesse, the hero, is royally descended. The mysterious gloom, which shrouds the very threshold of his life, appears prophetic of the tragedy about to be unfolded. His mother, on learning that his father has fallen in battle, dies in giving him birth. Kept in ignorance of his parentage, the orphan Prince is secretly brought up by Rual, a trusty follower, and educated by him in all knightly accomplishments. When grown to man's estate, Tristan presents himself at the court of his childless uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, who, on hearing his history, adopts him as a son. To save his country from paying a shameful tribute of men and money to the neighbouring Irish, Tristan slays Morold, their champion, in single combat. The youthful victor, however, at the same time receives a dangerous wound from the poisoned weapon of his foe, which no native art can cure. He, therefore, absents himself from his uncle's court, and lands disguised in Ireland, where he is fortunately cured by Isolde, surnamed the Fair, daughter of the Irish King. Tristan eventually returns to Cornwall, and paints the charms of the Princess in such glowing colours, that Mark resolves to make her his Queen. Tristan undertakes to woo her on behalf of his uncle, and journeys to Ireland for that purpose. On his arrival at the Irish court, he learns that the King has promised his daughter's hand to the man who should rid the land of a terrible dragon. Tristan succeeds in killing the monster, and claims the prize in his uncle's name. The King gives his consent, and Tristan sets sail with Isolde the Fair for Cornwall. On the voyage they both unwittingly drink of a Magic Potion, entrusted to the care of Brang\u00e6ne, a waiting-woman, and destined for King Mark. This Potion possesses the property of making those who partake of it deeply enamoured of each other; and it is upon this effect on Tristan and Isolde that the whole story turns. Isolde becomes the wife of Mark, but continues devoted to Sir Tristan. Mark discovers the attachment, and persecutes the\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., IX., p. 103.\nlovers, who practise various deceptions in order to effect a meeting, and even succeed in making their escape together. Isolde the Fair afterwards returns to her husband, while Tristan, driven to despair, weds another Isolde, named \"of the White Hand.\" Our hero vainly endeavours to forget his first love in deeds of reckless daring. On again receiving a grievous hurt in battle, he sends for her who alone can work his cure. His messenger is instructed to hoist, on his return, white sails, should his errand prove successful, and black sails if the reverse. Isolde of the White Hand, jealous of her rival, tells Tristan that she descries a black sail on the horizon, though in reality the sail is a white one. Bereft of hope he dies, and Isolde the Fair, finding, on her arrival, that her aid has come too late, dies also, of grief, by his side. King Mark, when he hears of the Magic Potion and its unhappy effects, causes the lovers to be buried in one tomb, on which he plants a rose and vine. These afterwards grow up so closely entwined one with another that none can ever separate them.\"\n\nHaving described the legend, and given its various versions, and having referred to it, as an instance of \"the deification of the powers of nature,\" the author says: \"With regard to Tristan, a very interesting question arises as to whether he is an ancient mythic personage venerated by the Aryan family prior to their migration into Europe. Of this I believe some evidence may be gathered from the history of Ferid\u00fbn, the celebrated hero of Persia.\"\n\nThe legend of Ferid\u00fbn, as summed up by Mr. Leith, is as follows:\n\n\"Ferid\u00fbn, the son of Abt\u00fbn and Fir\u00e2nek is born in the reign of Zoh\u00e2k. That King, warned by wise men that the child would overturn his kingdom, seeks after his life. Ferid\u00fbn's father is killed, but he himself is saved by his mother, who flees with him into India, where he is brought up in secret by a hermit. When sixteen years of age he demands of his mother the history of his birth. On hearing of the persecution by Zoh\u00e2k, he determines to obtain his revenge. The legend proceeds to narrate his victory over the King, whom he nails, Prometheus-like, to a rock, in obedience to a divine command.\"\n\nThe Avesta name of Ferid\u00fbn is Thra\u00eataona, which has its corresponding forms in the Vedas. Leith identifies one of these, viz., Tritan, with Tristan of the legend, and thinks, that the legend of Ferid\u00fbn is well nigh the same, as that of Tristan. The drink of the Haoma juice by Ferid\u00fbn's father, which led to Ferid\u00fbn's birth, is compared to the drink of the \"magic potion\" in the Tristan legend. The fight of Feri-\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., IX, pp. 101-02. 2 Ibid, p. 124. 3 Ibid, p. 124.\nd\u00fbn with Zoh\u00e2k, which name is a corruption of Azi Dah\u00e2ka, wherein Azi means a dragon, is compared with Tristan's fight with the dragon in the story.\n\nMr. Leith misses one other point of comparison. It is this, that as in the Tristan legend, the queen of King Mark is sought by Tristan, so, in the legend of Ferid\u00fbn, the wives of Zoh\u00e2k are sought by Ferid\u00fbn, who makes them his wives.\n\nBut, in spite of these few points of resemblance, I do not think these legends agree in their main features.\n\n*Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XI, pp. 147-218. 9th January 1875.*\n\nThis paper is a complete resum\u00e9 of the different accounts of the fall of Persia under the Sassanides, and the rise of the Arab power in Persia, as given by Tabari, Mirkhond and Ibn Khald\u00fbn. All the materials he had to work upon, were, as Prof. Rehatsek says, one-sided, because there is no authentic account of the times, preserved in any Zoroastrian books. Even during these last 30 years, since the time when Rehatsek wrote, no new important Zoroastrian materials have come to hand.\n\nRehatsek does not say, why reliable historical sources \"from the other side,\" i.e., from the Parsees, are not found. Apart from the generally accepted fact, that a country wishes to sing more of its victories than of its defeats, it must be borne in mind, that the Arabs would not tolerate any attempts on the part of the Zoroastrian Persians to chronicle an account of their wars with the Arabs from their point of view. The Arabs destroyed most of their ancient literature, and so, even if an account of the war had been written by a Persian, it would not have been allowed to continue, because, it would present a phase of the events which the Arabs would not like.\n\nThe first chapter of the paper treats of the commencement of the war by the Arabs during the Khalifate of Abu Bekr, who first thought of subjugating the little kingdom of Hirat which, \"although it contained an entirely Arab population,\" was \"tributary to Persia.\" This town of Hirat has rather a long and varied history of its own, in relation to its Arab population and Persian suzerainty. It is referred to in the Pahlavi treatise of Shatroih\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n as being founded by Shapuhar of Ardashir. I would refer my readers for this history to my paper on \"The Cities of Iran\" based on this new Pahlavi treatise, published in our Journal (Vol. XX, pp. 156-90).\n\n1 Journal XI, p. 148.\n\n2 Vide my Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eeran, &c., pp. 74-78 and 150-51. Vide my paper on \"The Cities of Iran.\" Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XX, pp. 177-78.\nProf. Rehatsek gives, in this paper, \"a chronological table of the sovereigns of Persia\" from Shiruyeh (Kobad II) to Yazdegird, the last monarch, according to different European authorities, who differ not only in dates, but also in the names of the successive sovereigns. We also find a difference in the names and dates, as given by Eastern authorities, and those, as given by the Pahlavi J\u0101m\u0101sp\u012b. Even the Pahlavi, Pazend and Persian versions of the J\u0101m\u0101sp\u012b differ in these dates, which is due to the faults of the copyists.\n\nThe last portion of this very interesting and exhaustive paper is very important from the point of view of the Indian Parsis. Rehatsek says, \"The complete subjugation of the vast extent of the Persian monarchy took place only by degrees, and revolts now and then still took place, but were suppressed without very great difficulty, as no extensive organizations or ramifications of them among the various districts were possible. These insurrections were frequent enough up to the death of the Khalif Sulaim\u00e2n B. A'bd-al-Melek, which took place A.H. 99 (717-18). The last great effort of the Persians to recover their ancient independence occurred also in the 8th century of our era, but the Rauzat-al-\u00e7afa, from which I take the account, does not give the date. Sinb\u0101d, the Zoroastrian, an influential inhabitant of Nish\u0101pur, raised the standard of revolt by first proclaiming his intention to liberate the Persians from the Musalm\u0101n yoke in his native city, and inviting the population of the district of Rey, as well as the whole of T\u0101berist\u0101n, to make common cause with him. Sinb\u0101d first marched to Kazvin, with the intention of taking possession of it, but was disappointed. In Rey he was more successful; he not only took it, but slew its governor, and obtained an enormous booty of arms and other articles. When he had collected an army of 110,000 men, he declared that the end of Isl\u0101m was at hand, that a scion of the S\u0101ss\u0101nian dynasty would make his appearance, under whose command he would march to Mekkah and would destroy the Ka'bah. When Abu Ja'fer Man\u00e7ur heard of what was taking place, he marched with his army to S\u0101wa; Sinb\u0101d, too, hastened to encounter him, carrying also many Musalm\u0101n women whom he had placed on camels. The battle which took place was decisive: Sinb\u0101d was put to flight and afterwards killed in T\u0101berist\u0101n; his army was partly destroyed, but many of the fugitives perished of thirst in the desert. The total\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XI., p. 148n.\n2 Rehatsek follows Mordtmann, whose order of chronology is given by Mr. K. R. Cama in his \"Jamshedi Naoroz.

It appears, that the band of the Parsees, who emigrated to India in about A.D. 766, were some of the fugitives, referred to by Rehatsek, in the above passage, on the authority of Mahomedan writers. I would ask my readers, to read in this connection, Rehatsek's paper on \"The B\u00e2w and G\u00e2ob\u00e2rah Sephabuds along the southern Caspian shores.\"\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XI, Abstract of the Society's Proceedings, pp. XXXVI-XLIV. 20th October 1875.\n\nIn this paper Dr. Andreas, who had come to Bombay, on his way to Persia, gave a sketch of the subjects worth investigating in Persia and which he proposed to investigate. He considered, that \"the study of the actual geography and ethnography of Persia\" was necessary to give \"a full insight into the history and civilization of the Persian race.\" He attached great importance to the investigation of geographical names with a view to examine their identity with old names.\n\nOf the city of Rishehr, \"on the road from Bushire to Shiraz,\" he says that its name is \"a contraction of Riw-Ardeshir,\" said to have been refounded by Ardeshir B\u00e2beg\u00e2n, the first S\u00e2ssanian king. Now, the K\u00e2rn\u00e2meh-i-Ardeshir B\u00e2beg\u00e2n refers to four cities, as founded by this monarch\u2014(1) R\u00e2s Sh\u00e2puhar, (2) Art\u00e2sh\u00eer Gadman, (3) B\u00f4kht Art\u00e2sh\u00eer, and (4) Ramashneh-i-Art\u00e2sh\u00eer. Tabari gives the names of six cities founded by Ardeshir\u2014(1) Ardesh\u00eer-\u00c2b\u00e2d, (2) New-Ardesh\u00eer, (3) Hormuzd Ardeshir, (4) Asp\u00e2b\u00e2d Ardeshir, (5) Asp\u00e2 Ardesh\u00eer, and (6) New-Ardesh\u00eer between Medina and Mossul. According to Firdousi he had founded six cities, and he gives the names of four\u2014(1) Khareh-i-Ardeshir, (2) R\u00e2m Ardeshir, (3) Ormazd Ardeshir, and (4) Barkeh-i-Ardeshir. We do not find in these different names, a city of the name of Riw Ardeshir, as founded by Ardeshir. So, I think, that the city of Rishehr, referred to by Dr. Andreas, must either be R\u00e2s-Shapuhar or New Shahpur corrupted into Rishehr.\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S.

From the fact, that the figure, over which this inscription is engraved, \"bears an Egyptian dress, peculiar to certain Egyptian deities and to the divinized kings of Mero\u00eb,\" Dr. Andreas thinks, that, it belongs to a brother of Xerxes, whose proper name he assumes to be Cyrus. According to Ctesias, he \"was Viceroy of Egypt, fell there in a battle against the rebel Inaros, and was brought to Persia to be buried there.\"\n\nOn one of the two roads\u2014the eastern one that leads from Shir\u00e2z to Bunder Abb\u00e2s\u2014there lies a town, not far from Khir, named Tirdeh. Andreas identifies it with the town named Tirouz\u00e9 by Tabari*, and placed by him in the country of Khir and in the dependency of Istakhr. Tabari speaks of it as the native place of Ardeshir Babeg\u00e2n.\n\nOn the western road leading from Shir\u00e2z to Bunder Abb\u00e2s, there lies the town of Firuz\u00e2b\u00e2d, originally called Gour. Dr. Andreas says that \"the actual name, Firuz\u00e2b\u00e2d, was given to it by Buid-sultan Azad-ed-daulat after its capture.\" The reason of this change of name was this. Whenever the above-mentioned Azad-ed-daulat went to the town of Gour, the people said \u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u06af\u0648\u0631 \u0631\u0641\u062a i.e., the king has gone to Gour. Now, the word Gour, also means in Persian \"a grave.\" So the sentence also meant \"The king has gone to his grave.\" They say, that the governor did not like these unlucky words and so changed the name Gour to Firuz\u00e2b\u00e2d.\n\nJournal, B.

March 1876.\n\nProf. Rehatsek tries to show in this paper, that \"the Jews had followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, so that they were not only in historical, but also in religious contact with them.\" Before considering what he calls their \"foreign gods,\" he gives \"a brief account of the systems of religion prevalent among the four great nations (the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Medians and the Persians) with whom the Jews came in contact during the period under discussion.\"\n\n1 Journal, B.

S., XI, p. 221.\n7 Ibid.\nAt first, he treats of the religions of Assyria and Babylonia together in one group, and then those of Media and Persia in another group. Of the first group, he says: \"The theology of the Assyrians, who were Semites like the Hebrews and Arabs, and of the Babylonians, who were Hamites, will not become well-known until the many thousands of clay tablets now mouldering on the shelves of the British Museum are deciphered.\"\u00b9 That has been done to a great extent now, and we have now more than one book on the subject.\n\nAsshur, \"the king of all the gods\" among the Assyrians, is identified by some with the Ahura of the Persians. \"Of the two chief emblems connected with the worship of Asshur, the first is the winged circle or globe, considered to be also a symbol of Ormazd.\"\u00b2 European savants consider it a symbol of Ormazd, but Parsee scholars believe it to be the Far\u00f4har or the guiding spirit. In several sculptures of Persia, a king is represented, as praying before a Fire-altar with a winged figure hovering in the air. This figure is believed by the Parsees to be a figure of the Far\u00f4har (or the guiding spirit) of the king who prays. In the Farvardin Yasht (Yt. XIII.) the Fravashi or the Far\u00f4har, is represented as coming down to the earth in the form of a bird (m\u00e2nayen ah\u00ea yatha n\u00e2 meregh\u00f4 hupar\u00eano, i.e., like a man in the form of a bird with good wings).\u00b3\n\nThat this is not the figure or the symbol of Ormazd, is proved by the fact, that, had it been so, it would have been the same in all cases. But it varies in different cases. It has been found in the case of one and the same king, that the winged figure in his picture of a young age has young features, and that in his picture of an old age, has old features. This shows, that, the winged figure is a picture of his own Fravashi or Far\u00f4har, which is his own prototype. Had it been that of Ormazd, it would have been the same in all cases.\n\nThe second symbol connected with the worship of Asshur is the sacred tree. This sacred tree is the palm-tree among the Babylonians. Now, the Persians also had a sacred tree. Even up to now, the Zoroastrians use the leaf of the date-palm in their ritual.\n\nComing to the second group, vis., the religion of the Medes and Persians, the two \"branches of the great Aryan family, allied in language and religion,\" the author says, that though they \"conquered their two Semitic neighbours, Assyria and Babylonia, and constituted the great Persian Empire,\" their unity of government brought on \"no unity of language. Hence the trilingual inscriptions of Behistun, Persepolis, &c., consisting of an Indo-European, a Tartar, and a Semitic column... The Magi, who considerably modified the\n\n\u00b9 Ibid.\n\u00b2 Ibid, p. 222.\n\u00b3 Yasht XIII, 70.\nreligion of the Persians and the Medes, were a tribe of the latter, but may be recognized as Scyths.\"\u00b9\n\nRehatsek speaks of the prevalence of two elements in the religious system of the Persians. (1) Firstly, what he calls, the elemental worship and ignolatry, which came to them from the Magi, who were a tribe of the Medes and may be recognized as Scyths. (2) The dualistic doctrine, which is originally Persian or Zoroastrian.\n\nThe Persian nation also, had, as a whole, two elements: (1) the Persians proper, and (2) the Medes, who included the Magi.\n\nNow, what Herodotus describes as the religion of the Persians, is the religion of the masses, among whom the Mede or Magian element was prevalent to a greater extent. In Herodotus, there is no trace of Dualism, and no mention of Ormazd; whereas, conversely, in the inscriptions, there is nothing elemental, but the worship of the supreme God under the name of Ormazd. From this, Rehatsek draws the conclusion, that \"Herodotus has had evidence of the religion of the masses only, which had not accepted Dualism,\u2014that is to say, the religion of their Persian conquerors, the religion of the state or established worship; whilst, on the other hand, the absence of the mention of elemental, originally Scythian, and strictly Magian, religion in the inscriptions is no evidence of its not having constituted at the time of their composition a part of the Persian religion, as the omission may easily be accounted for by the great pre-eminence which the adoration of Ormazd naturally enjoyed after, as well as before, the addition of Magism to it. The fact that Herodotus knew of no other than the elemental religion is sufficient evidence of its extent; for not only was it predominant among the Medes, but also the bulk of the dominant Persians were well disposed towards it.\"\u00b2\n\nRehatsek says that the religion of the Persians had gone through five stages, by the time, when Darius came to the throne of Persia.\n\n(1) In its old home of Central Asia, where it flourished as the old Aryan religion, it was, to some extent, Nature-worship. Their worship was then common with that of their Indian brethren.\n\n(2) The second stage was that of \"the belief in Ormazd as the supreme Creator.\" \"It boldly declares that at the head of the good intelligences is a single great Intelligence, Ahur\u00f4 Mazda, the highest object of adoration, the true Creator, Preserver, and Governor of the Universe. This is its greatest glory. It sets before the soul a single Being as the source of all good, and the proper object of the highest worship.\"\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B. B. R. A.

He died in B.C. 561, after a reign of 43 years. He was succeeded by his son Evil-Merodach, who in turn was succeeded in 559 B.C. by Neriglissar, who died in 556 B.C. It was during his reign, that \"Cyrus, the Persian, dethroned Astyages the Median (in 558 B.C.) and established the supremacy of the Persians.\" Neriglissar was succeeded by his son Laborosoarchod, who reigned only for nine months, being \"murdered by Nabonadius, who mounted the throne 555 B.C. and was the last king of Babylon,\"\u00b2 Cyrus having taken it in 538 B.C. \"Cyrus found among his new subjects an oppressed race, in whose religion he recognized a considerable resemblance to his own. . . . He regarded the Jews with especial favour as monotheists, which he showed by allowing them to return to their country to rebuild the Temple, and bringing forth by the hand of Mithredath, his treasurer, the sacred vessels formerly taken from it, and surrendering them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.\" The Temple was begun in 535 B.C. But the dissension among the different sections delayed it. The pseudo-Smerdis \"ordered the works to be stopped about 522 B.C.\" because it was represented to him by the rival tribes \"that the Jews were building the city in order to become rebellious.\"\u2074 A decree of Darius in 519 B.C. permitted the continuation of the work, which was finished in 515 B.C.\n\nDarius died in 486 B.C. and his son Xerxes succeeded him. He had a Jewish queen, named Esther, who is said to have saved the Jews from a massacre at the hands of the Minister of Xerxes. Not only that, but she managed to persuade the king to allow the Jews to kill, on a particular day, all their enemies. The Purim feast of the Jews commemorates this event.\u2075\n\nXerxes was succeeded by Artaxerxes I, known as Macrocheir, i.e., the long-handed, by the Greeks. The Jews, it is said, were threatened by two perils in his reign. The first was of that kind, which, a large number of Parsees, at present, are afraid, would overtake them. It was \"that, if the Jews had continued their\n\n\u00b9 Ibid, p. 233. \u00b2 Ibid, p. 255. \u00b3 Ibid, p. 256. \u2074 Ibid, p. 257. \u2075 Ibid, p. 259.\ninter-marriages with foreign nations, as they had commenced to do, and did on their return from Babylon, they would soon have become so commingled with them as to cease to be a separate people. Ezra had brought his colony from Babylon during the seventh year of this king, i.e., 458 B.C. and Nehemiah about 434 B.C. Ezra collected all the men of Judah and Benjamin in Jerusalem, and exacted a solemn promise from all who had taken strange wives and begotten children, to divorce their wives. Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice: 'As thou hast said, so must we do.'\n\nNehemiah also purged the nations from strange marriages, and freed it from the second danger, which consisted in the defenceless position of the country, enhanced by its remoteness from Persia, and exposed to be pillaged before aid could arrive. Nehemiah obtained a decree from Artaxerxes to fortify the city in the twentieth year of his reign, and its walls were built.\"\u00b9\n\nArtaxerxes I was succeeded by his son Xerxes II, who reigned only forty-five days, and was murdered by his illegitimate son Sogdianus, who, after a reign of six and a half months, was in his turn murdered by his brother Darius Nothus (B.C. 424 to 405), who, after a reign of nineteen years, was succeeded by his son Artaxerxes II.\u00b2\n\nIn the reign of this Artaxerxes II, Bagoses, the Persian General, is said to have \"polluted the temple and imposed tribute on the Jews,\u2014that out of the public stock, before they offered the daily sacrifices, they should pay for every lamb fifty shekels.\"\u00b3 It seems that the Persian General Bagoses was a friend of Jesus (Jeshua), the brother of John. \"It was... a feature of the Persian system of administration to allow the nations under their rule a good deal of self-government and internal independence.\"\u2074 This being the case, \"even the civil governors of Jud\u00e6a, which was a portion of the Syrian satrapy, were always Jews; they, however, did not succeed each other very regularly, and therefore the high priests, i.e., spiritual governors, came to be regarded as not merely the religious, but also the political heads of the nation.\"\u2075\n\nNow, John was one of such religious and political heads. He was provoked by his brother Joshua in the temple itself. In the quarrel which ensued he killed his brother. It is believed, though it is not clear, that it was, as a punishment of this crime by John, that Bagoses, the friend of the murdered brother Joshua, imposed the above-said tribute on John and his Jews. This, then, was the result of internal dissensions.\n\nArtaxerxes II was succeeded by Artaxerxes III (B.C. 359 to 338), who was murdered at the instigation of somebody in his \"Zan\u00e1nah\" and was succeeded by Darius III, surnamed Codomanus, whose rule was\n\n\u00b9 Ibid, pp. 259-60. \u00b2 Ibid, p. 260, n. 4. \u00b3 Ibid, p. 260. \u2074 Ibid. \u2075 Ibid.\noverthrown by Alexander. \"Jaddua, the son of the abovementioned John, succeeded his father in the high priesthood, and was a contemporary of Darius III, who sent one Sanballat, a Cuth\u00e6an by birth, of which stock also the Samaritans were, to Samaria as governor; this officer had a daughter, Nicaso by name, whom he gave in marriage to Manasseh, the brother of Jaddua, and partner with him in the high-priesthood. This marriage was a great stumbling-block to the elders of Jerusalem, who considered it to be a step encouraging all men desirous to enter into alliances with strange women, which would bring on a mixture with foreign nations; accordingly, they commanded Manasseh either to divorce his wife, or to refrain from approaching the altars, the high-priest himself joining the people in their indignation against his brother, and driving him away from the altar. The evil had, however, already gone too far, for not only the people of Jerusalem, but many even of the priests and Levites, had contracted such marriages, so that a great disturbance arose; they all revolted to Manasseh, and Sanballat gave money, as well as habitations and land for tillage, to gratify his son-in-law, whom he also promised to make governor of all the places he himself ruled over, and high-priest; he further promised to build him a temple like that of Jerusalem, upon Mount Gerizim, which is the highest of all the hills in Samaria. All this was to be done with the approbation of Darius the King.\" But Darius was shortly afterwards defeated and succeeded by Alexander the Great. Sanballat persuaded Alexander and got his leave to erect a new temple, of which he appointed Manasseh as the head-priest.\n\nRehatsek's paper ends with the reign of Alexander, but we find that the contact had long continued, even up to the Sassanian times. Of the influence of a Jewish lady as the queen of a Persian king, like that in the case of queen Esther and Ahuserus (Xerxes), we have a notable instance in that of Shishindokht, the Jewish queen of Yazdagard I. It is referred to, in the Pahlavi treatise of Shatr\u00f4ih\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n. She is said to be the daughter of one Resh Galutha, who \"is called\" Yahoudg\u00e2n Sh\u00e2h, i.e., \"the king of the Jews.\" This phraseology refers to the custom above referred to, vis., that the high-priest or the spiritual leader was also considered to be the political ruler. The words \"Resh Galutha,\" used in the Pahlavi treatise, mean \"the Prince of the Captivity or the Exilarch.\" Albiruni refers to the political power exercised by these head-priests. Some of these Jewish head-priests enjoyed royal honours in the court of some of the Sassanian kings of Persia. Huna, the son of Nathan, was a special favourite of Yazdagard.\n\n1 Ibid, pp. 261-52. 2 Vide my \"Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e1n, Shatr\u00f4ih\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n and Afdiya va Sahig\u00eeya-i-Se\u00eest\u00e2n,\" pp. 105, 113, 137-40. 3 \"History of the Jews,\" by Graetz, Vol. II, p. 513. 4 \"The Chronology of Ancient Nations\" by Albiruni, translated by Dr. Sachau, pp. 19, 68.\nGraetz,' in his History of the Jews, says on this point \"He (Yezdagard) was exceedingly well affected towards the Jews, and at the same time favourably disposed towards the Christians. On the days of homage there were present at his court the three representatives of the Babylonian Jews: Ashi, of Sora; Mar-zutra, of Pumbeditha; and Amemar of Nahardea. Huna bar Nathan, who, if he was no Prince of the Captivity, must nevertheless have been possessed of considerable influence, held frequent intercourse with Jezidjird's court. Such a mark of attention on the part of a Persian king . . . . may be regarded as a proof of high favour.\" It appears that not only Jewish princesses but other Jewish ladies had begun influencing the Persians in one way or another. It is for this reason, that we find the Dinkard* deprecating marriages with Jewish women.*\n\nAccording to the abovenamed Pahlavi treatise, the foundation of the town of Kharzem, (modern Khiva) in ancient Persia, is attributed to the Rish-i-Yahoudg\u00e2n,* i.e., \"the chief of the Jews,\" and that of the towns of Shus, Shushter and Gae (in Ispahan) to the Jewish queen Shishind\u00f4kht. Ispahan, the ancient capital of Persia, or at least a part of it, was at one time called Yahoudieh.* On the subject of the Jews and the Persians, Prof. Darmesteter's \"Textes Pehlvis relatifs au Judaisme\" (Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives T. XVIII. pp. 1-15 and 41-56) may be read with advantage. Mr. L. H.

The last of the Sephabuds in this Khalif\u2019s reign was Kh\u014drshyd. \u201cHe caused every town and the whole country to flourish, but became, after he had reigned for a long time, so proud and overbearing towards his high officers, and tyrannical towards his subjects, that they felt aggrieved, and would have been glad of an opportunity to revolt from him, which...actually presented itself...O\u2019mar B.

Thus, it appears, that they must have left their mountainous district, shortly after the commencement of the Arab invasion of Tabaristan in 749 A.D., as described by Rehatsek, on the authority of Mahomedan authors.

S., XIII, pp. 18-108. 17th February 1877.\n\nIt is a very exhaustive paper on the spread of Christianity in Persia, based on materials collected from European and Oriental authors. It shows \"the state of Christianity under various sovereigns of Persia, beginning with its propagation at Edessa where it first reached from Palestine.\"\n\nIt was from Edessa, that it gradually spread into Persia. Voltaire places the scenes of his well-known play, \"Les Guebres ou La Tolerance\" in Syria, where the Christian rulers of Rome came in contact with the Zoroastrians of Persia.\n\nThe order of the successive kings of Persia, as given by Rehatsek, and their dates, vary a little, here and there, from those given by other authors.\n\nProfessor Rehatsek begins his survey with the state of the Chaldaean diocese in Seleucia, \"the capital of which was the first episcopal seat occupied by Maris, whom Thadd\u00e6us or Add\u00e6us, one of the seventy-two disciples, had sent there.\" At first it was dependent upon the patriarch of Antioch, but afterwards became independent and embraced \"all the countries, formerly under the sway of Persia, from M\u00e9sopotamia to the extreme boundaries of Turkest\u00e2n, also China and India.\"\n\nChristianity was founded in Edessa by Abgar, the ruler of the place, who, it is said, receiving favorable reports of the miraculous powers of\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid, pp. 443-444.  \n2 Journal, B.

Christ wrote in reply, that he would send somebody else in his stead. Thomas, 'one of the twelve apostles, sent Thadd\u00e6us, one of the seventy or seventy-two disciples, to Abgar, after the ascension of Christ. Thadd\u00e6us cured him, and baptized him and his whole city. The letter of Christ, which Rehatsek gives in this paper\u00b9, is now believed to be apocryphal.\n\nThe spread of Christianity at Edessa was stopped in the reign of Abgar's immediate successors. In the meantime, Thadd\u00e6us preached Christianity at Arbela, Nisibis, Beth-Garma and Mosul, \"whilst his chief co-adjutor Maris did so in Babylon, in the adjoining provinces of Persia beyond the Tigris, dwelling, however, chiefly in Seleucia and Ctesiphon, the capital of Persia, where he converted many to the faith, and built several churches, in one of which he was buried.\"\u00b2 Achis, the other assistant of Thadd\u00e6us, preached Christianity in the province of Ahv\u00e1z. \"Afterwards the number of Christians was considerably increased by the prisoners whom the Persians captured in their wars with the Romans, and who, being dispersed in various districts of Persia, propagated their religion in them.\"\u00b3 An edict of Trajan (A.D. 112) stopped the persecution of the Christians. \"Christianity gradually radiated further from Edessa (which was under the suzerainty of the Romans), into Persia, but the whole of Armenia was Christianized only under Persian vassalage in the beginning of the fourth century.\"\u2074\n\nThe Parthian king of Persia during the later days of Trajan was Chosroes, who was dethroned by Trajan, but was re-instated by the people on the death of Trajan.\n\nRehatsek here describes as follows the method of electing the Catholicus (i.e., the patriarch or the bishop) of Persia, in the early part of the second century after Christ:\n\n\"The Bishop of Cascara proceeded to Seleucia, to take temporary charge of the widowed church, as soon as the Catholicus of Persia died, and invited by letter, six or eight metropolitans to proceed to a new election. These prepared themselves by fasting and prayer in the church Dir Elkam, with the other clergy and chief men of the laity. This assembly proposed certain candidates, whose number being finally reduced to three, their names were written on three papers, a fourth being inserted with the name of Christ as the chief pastor. These four slips of paper being folded into balls were placed under the altar, on which the sacred liturgy was celebrated. Then a little boy was made to pull out one ball; if it contained the name of a can-\n\n\u00b9 Ibid, p. 20. \u00b2 Ibid, p. 23. \u00b3 Ibid. \u2074 Ibid, p. 26.\ndidate he was proclaimed Catholicus, but if the name of Christ appeared on the paper, none of the three were considered worthy, and the same process was gone over with three other candidates, and repeated until one was elected.\u201d\n\nThis process of divination, in the election of a bishop, reminds a Parsee of the election, in the later Sassanian times, of Ard\u00e2i Vir\u00e2f, for the purpose of a divine mission to the other world. In that election also, we find a large assembly electing a smaller one, and this in its turn electing a still smaller one, until three were finally elected. These three drew lots among themselves, as to who should undertake the divine mission.\n\nIn the beginning of the third century, the Sassanians came into power in Persia. They were in continuous hostility with Armenia. \u201cUnder the predecessors of Tiridates (the king of Armenia), the Armenians followed a religion which was no doubt the same as that of the Parthians, i.e., probably a mixture of Zoroastrianism, of Greek mythology, and of some other doctrines brought by their ancestors from Scythia. In their temples numerous idols could be seen, to which animal sacrifices, never in vogue among Zoroastrians, were offered. The latter, it would appear, admitted during that period only the Zervana Akarana, or, \u2018time without bounds,\u2019 which the Greeks translated by Saturn, as their chief Deity.\u201d\n\nHere Rehatsek gives in the footnote the ordinance of Mihr-Nerseh, the Persian Governor of Armenia (published in 442 A.D.), on the belief of Zervana Akarana. We must note, that all this refers to a particular sect of Persia, known as the Zervanites, and not to all the Persians in general.\n\nThe Armenian king Tiridates latterly adopted Christianity, which spread on a large scale in Armenia. This was one of the causes of the religious wars between Persia and Armenia, which lasted for a long time.\n\nArdeshir B\u00e2began died in 240 A.D. and during the short period of 69 years (240\u2014309) that followed his death, seven kings ruled, one after another, for short periods. They were Shapur I., Hormuzd I, Behr\u00e2m I, II, and III, Nersi, Hormazd II. Then came the long reign of 70 years of Shapur II (309\u2014379 A.D.), and it was a period of \u201ca great persecution of the Christians.\u201d It was during his reign that M\u00e2ni, the founder of the Manich\u00e6an heresy, flourished. He \u201cpromulgated tenets professed partly by Christians, by Zoroastrians and by Bud-\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A.

I.\n3 This Tiridates is not the one, who was the brother of Vulkhas, and who lived in the time of Nero.\n4 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XIII, p. 29\n5 Ibid, p. 31.\nShapur II looked towards it as an offense of Christianity and tried to suppress it. Now, this persecution of the Christians under Shapur II was more on political grounds than on religious grounds. It was more of a political persecution than a religious persecution. Professor Rehatsek says on this point:\n\n\"It may be observed that the whole persecution just noticed was chiefly confined to the provinces of Persia for the possession of which Sh\u0101p\u016br contended during a portion of his long reign, namely, to the districts from Edessa down to Ctesiphon, embracing a part of Armenia and the whole of Mesopotamia, so that the Christian martyrs were considered to favour the views of their Roman co-religionists, and to be disloyal to the Persian Government; accordingly they were liable to be persecuted also on that score, which would considerably modify, if not altogether invalidate, the assumption that the persecution was exclusively of a religious character.\"\n\nThen the short period of 20 years (379\u2014399 A.D.) saw the rule of three kings over Persia, Ardeshir II, Shapur III, and Behram IV. Then we come to Yazdagird I (399\u2014420). This monarch is said to have favoured the Christians a good deal. Several causes seem to have won his favour for the Christians. Rehatsek does not refer to all of them. He refers to the following:\n\n(1) Bishop Isaac \"in connection with St. Acacius, the Bishop of Amida, ransomed Persian prisoners from the Romans, but the precise year in which this event happened cannot be made out satisfactorily. When the Romans had, in their devastation of Azanena, captured about seven thousand Persians, whom they were by no means inclined to release, and who were starving, Acacius convoked his priests and said to them,\u2014'Our God stands in need neither of platters nor bowls, as he neither eats nor drinks, and wants nothing. But as the Church possesses many gold and silver vessels, presented by the benevolence and liberality of those who have entered it, we must with their price ransom the captives and feed them.' After having said more to the same purport, he had the sacred vessels melted, ransomed the captives gradually by paying their price to the Roman soldiers, fed them for some time, and, lastly, providing them with travelling expenses, sent them to the king of Persia, who was so much struck by this act of Acacius that he desired the Bishop to pay him a visit, which is said to have taken place by the permission of Theodosius, who allowed him to leave the synod which was at that time sitting in Constantinople.\"\n\n1 Ibid., p. 33. 2 Ibid., p. 39.\n3 We must note here, that by some mistake, Rehatsek calls this Yazdagird, Yazdagird II, but the historical reference shows that he was Yazdagird I.\n4 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XIII, pp. 42-43.\n(2) Maruthas, the bishop of Mesopotamia, is said to have won the esteem of the Persian king by his piety. He cured the king of \"an apparently incurable headache . . . . Maruthas, in concert with Abdas, the Persian bishop, prepared by fastings and orisons, worked the miracle of exorcising a demon who had vexed the king's son.\" They say that this miracle of the bishop's was on the point of converting Yazdagird to Christianity.\n\nThe following three causes, which are believed to have won for the Christians the favour of Yazdagird I, are not referred to by Rehatsek.\n\n(1) According to Procopius, Agathias and Theophanus, Arcadius, the Roman Emperor, had, by his testament, appointed Yazdagird the \"protector for his son, Theodosius, a boy of tender age, instead of committing him to the charge of his uncle Honorius, or selecting a guardian for him from among his own subjects.\" According to Cedrenus, Yazdagird was given a legacy of \"1,000 pounds weight of pure gold,\" in return of this duty entrusted to him, \"which he (Arcadius) begged his Persian brother (Yazdagird) to accept as a token of his good-will.\" This circumstance, they say, made him inclined a little towards the Christians.\n\n(2) \"Again, Antiochus, his great favourite, whom he had sent to the court of Rome to help and advise young Theodosius, had, by his frequent letters in favour of Christianity, turned the mind of the Persian king to the religion of Christ, so much so, that according to some Roman writers he began persecuting the Zoroastrians of Persia for the sake of his Christian subjects. The influence of Antiochus had greatly led to the increase of Christian population in Persia. According to Theophanes, Yazdagird himself had shown a little inclination to turn a Christian. Professor Darmesteter says, on the authority of previous writers, that it was this monarch who had allowed the first Christian synod to be held in Persia in the town of Seleucia under the leadership of the Bishop of Byzantium. Again, he had permitted the erection of a church at Ctesiphon. He employed Christian bishops on diplomatic service.\"\n\n(3) The Pahlavi treatise of Shatr\u00f4\u00eeh\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n supplies another reason, why Yazdagird I was favourably inclined, not only towards the Christians, but also towards the Jews. That was the influence of\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid., pp. 43-44. 2 Rawlinson's Seventh Oriental Monarchy (1876), p. 272. 3 Ibid., p. 272.\n4 Textes Pehlvis relatifs au Juda\u00efsme, Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives X., Vol. XVIII, p. 44.\n5 Vide My Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e1n, Shatr\u00e2\u00eeh\u00f4-i-Air\u00e2n, &c., p. 139.

She was, as Prof. Darmesteter says, a second Queen Esther. We read in \"The History of the Jews,\" by Graetz,\u00b9 that \"He (Yazdagird) was exceedingly well affected towards the Jews, and at the same time favourably disposed towards the Christians.\" This was due to the influence of the abovementioned Jewish queen, who is mentioned in the said Pahlavi treatise to have founded several towns in Persia.\n\nThus, we see, that several reasons had led Yazdagird I to be favourably inclined towards the Christians. But, he was a queer man. He seems to have been wicked in disposition. If, at times, he persecuted his people for the Christians, at other times, he persecuted the latter as well. It is said, that Bishop Abdas \"being carried away by too much zeal had imprudently burnt a fire temple,\"\u00b2 This exasperated the king against the Christians. The above-mentioned Pahlavi treatise and several Persians books, all invariably call him dafr, basehgar, alathim, alkhashan, &c. All these words mean, that he was harsh and cruel. The Pahlavi treatise calls him dafr. This word seems to be the same as Arabic dafr, i.e., stinking. By the word 'stinking', the author perhaps means simply 'bad or wicked.' But, a passage in Rehatsek's paper leads us to suspect, that, perhaps, the writer uses the word in its original sense, and means to allude to some event that may have happened in the court of the king. The passage runs thus: \"When Maruthas was for the second time sent as ambassador, the Magi again played a trick to prevent his being admitted into the presence of the king; they produced a horrible stench in a locality through which he was wont to pass, and said that the Christians had done it. When Yazdegird discovered that this odour was a stratagem of the Magi, he had many of them slain, and honoured Maruthas the more.\"\u00b3\n\nHaving described at some length Yazdagard's own conduct, Rehatsek describes the religious wars between Armenia and Persia. Armenia was well nigh completely conquered by Behr\u00e2mgour (Behram V 420\u2014440 A.D.), the son of Yazdagard.\n\nAfter Yazdagard, the new form of Christianity, known as Nestorianism, began to spread in Persia. Behr\u00e2mgour was succeeded by Yazdagard II (440\u2014457 A.D.) who was a staunch Zoroastrian, and there was a good deal of fight between the Persians under him and the Christian people of Armenia.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Vol. II, p. 617. \u00b2 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XIII, p. 44.\n\u00b3 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XIII, pp. 43-44.\n\u2074 In this account of Rehatsek, we find some events belonging to the reign of Yazdagird I mixed up with those in the reign of Yazdagird II. He calls the first Yezdegard, Yazdagird II. He speaks of Behram V as the son Yazdagird II.\nUnder Feroz (457-484 A.D.) and Kob\u00e2d\u00b9(487-531 A.D.), Nestorianism spread to a great extent in Persia. There were about 40 bishops in Persia proper.\u00b2 There were several sects of the Christians then in Persia, such as the Gnostics, Monophysites, Melchites, Nestorians, and the sect of Gabriel. All these fought among themselves for supremacy.\n\nDuring the reigns of Kob\u00e2d and Noshirw\u00e2n, the favour or disfavour of Christianity on the part of the Persian monarchs, depended upon, whether they were in peace or hostility with the Roman Emperors. Christianity prospered in Persia, when peace ruled between the two countries. The influence of the Roman Emperors was always in favour of the Orthodox Church, and opposed to Nestorianism and other new sects that had sprung up.\n\nIn the reign of Noshirw\u00e2n (531-579 A.D.), besides Christianity, the new faith of Mazdak shared the attention of the people and the king. Rehatsek's account of this Persian socialist is interesting.\u00b3\n\nNoshirw\u00e2n's peace with Justinian brought also peace and prosperity to the Christians in Persia. A treaty was made between these two kings. \"Clauses were inserted in this treaty by which Christians were allowed to build churches, to perform their sacred ceremonies without any fear, to celebrate thanksgivings, and to chant hymns to God, as is customary among ourselves, and not to be forced to be present at Magian ceremonies, or unwillingly to worship the gods considered by the Medes to be gods. On that account, however, Christians were not to make any attempts to draw the followers of Magism to their own opinion.\"\u2074\n\nNoshirw\u00e2n had married a Christian Princess, and their offspring, N\u00f4ushz\u00e2d, having followed the faith of his mother, rebelled against his father. Hormuzd IV, (579-590 A.D.), the son and successor of Noshirw\u00e2n was dethroned by Behr\u00e2m Choubin. Noshirw\u00e2n's grandson, Khosru Parviz (590-628), also married a Christian lady, Sira by name (Shirin according to Oriental authors). According to some, she was the daughter of Maurice, the Emperor of Rome, who helped Khosru in gaining the throne of Persia from Behr\u00e2m Choubin. Khosru's marriage with a Christian wife did not prove as unhappy for him, as that of Noshirw\u00e2n with his Christian wife. Shirin showed \"her conciliatory disposition and good sense\"\u2075 at times, when a difference of opinion in religious matters was likely to bring about a breach between her royal husband and the Christian noblemen who attended Khosru's court. On one occasion, at a banquet given by the Persian King, Ny\u00e2tus, a Christian grandee who represent-\n\n\u00b9 The reign of Palas between these two kings lasted for three years (484-487).\n\u00b2 Journal, B.

The King had put on rich garments, which were presented to him by Maurice, and which bore Christian crosses over them. At first Khosru was doubtful, whether he should put on these garments with Christian crosses presented by his royal father-in-law. He thought, that if he put them on, he would offend his Zoroastrian subjects. If he did not, he would offend his Christian father-in-law. \"But the Dastur, who was his spiritual adviser, set all doubts at rest by assuring his sovereign that religion does not consist in dress, that he was a Zoroastrian, but also a relative of the Kay\u00e7ar.\"\u00b9\n\nNow, at this banquet, which the king attended with the garments bearing Christian crosses, \"Bandvy, one of his favourite magnates, with the Barsan (or little twig held by Mobeds when praying) in his hand, arrived and stood near his sovereign, who muttered the Baj.\u00b2 . . . When Ny\u00e2tus beheld the scene, he laid aside his bread, and was so amazed that he left the table, saying that the B\u00e2j and the cross together was an insult to the Messiah; being after this still more enraged by receiving a slap on the face from Bandvy, he immediately departed to his camp, got his troops ready to assault the royal banquet unless the person of Bandvy were delivered to him, and despatched a message to this effect to Khosru.\"\u00b3 At this critical moment, Shirin used her conciliatory powers, and brought about a settlement between Ny\u00e2tus and Bandvy.\n\nAfter Khosru Parviz, we have a succession of weak Persian monarchs. In their reign, the Mahomedan power began to spread and \"with the increase of the Muhammadan power the number of Christians diminished very rapidly everywhere in Persia and its dependencies.\"\u2074\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., XIV, pp. 5\u201415. 9th March 1878.\n\nThe author presents in this paper \"some points of contact between the two peoples (the Hindus and the Parsis), which have not yet been sufficiently investigated, and which may, perhaps, when duly inquired into, throw additional light on the common origin or identity of these two offshoots of the same Aryan stock.\"\u2075\n\nThe author's first note is on the barsam (Av. baresman) of the Parsis, which, differing from Dr. Haug,\u2076 he thinks \"to be identical, both in origin and sacrificial import, with the barhis of the Hindus,\" which is \"a bed or layer of kusa grass,\" spread on the ground \"to serve as a sacred surface on which to present the oblations.\"\u2077 The identity\n\n\u00b9 Ibid. \u00b2 The Zoroastrian prayer for saying grace at meals (Ya\u00e7na XXXVII, 1).\n\u00b3 Journal, B.

S., XIX, p. 7.\nseems to be doubtful, though there is no doubt, that the barsam like the barhis was, and is still used in sacrificial offerings.\n\nEzekiel, when he refers to the worshippers of the sun, and says of them, that \"they put the branch to their nose,\" is believed to refer to these barsam twigs of the ancient Ir\u00e2nians. Strabo also refers to the barsam in the following sentence, when describing the customs of the Magi. \"They then lay the flesh in order upon myrtle or laurel branches; the Magi touch it with slender twigs, and make incantations, pouring oil mixed with milk and honey, not into the fire, nor into the water, but upon the earth. They continue their incantations for a long time, holding in the hands a bundle of slender myrtle rods.\" This passage of Strabo indirectly leads us to see, that the barsam of the Ir\u00e2nians does not correspond to the barhis of the Hindus. As the barhis was spread on the ground among the Hindus, so were \"the myrtle or laurel branches\" spread upon the ground; but barsam was something that was generally held in the hands.\n\nThe barsam played a prominent part in the recital of grace before meals. This appears both from Firdousi and from other writers. Yazdagard, the last Sassanian king, when he fled from the Arabs and concealed himself in the house of a miller, asked for the barsam, from his host, when he offered him his humble meals, so that he may say his grace. This, according to Firdousi, led to his disclosure and subsequent death.\n\nWe learn from other writers, that this custom of having the barsam in the recital of grace at meals, was, on the point of leading to a breach of peace between Khosro Parviz (Chosroe II) and his Christian brother-in-law, Ny\u00e2tus. Rehatsek, in his paper on \"Christianity in the Persian dominions,\" thus refers to the event.\n\n\"On another occasion the Persian monarch gave a banquet, and had tables arranged for that purpose, in a rose garden. He had put on the royal diadem, and Ny\u00e2tus with the philosophers sat around the table, when Khosru dressed in the jewelled Grecian robes, came down from the throne, and walking with a smile to the table took his seat. Also Bandvy, one of his favourite magnates, with the Barsan (or little twig held by Mobeds when praying) in his hand, arrived and stood near his sovereign, who muttered the B\u00e2j. When Ny\u00e2tus beheld this scene, he laid aside his bread, and was so amazed that he left the table, saying that the B\u00e2j and the Cross together was an insult to the Messiah.\"\n\n1 Ezekiel VIII, 16\u201417.\n2 Strabo, Bk.

S., XIII, p. 88 note.\nPassing on to another point of similarity, Dr. Da Cunha compares the Parsee m\u0101hr\u016bi (mohr\u012bn) to the \"three sacrificial posts or three-footed post of the Veda,\"\u00b9 and to \"the tripod of the Greeks, seated on which the priestess of Apollo used to deliver oracles.\"\u00b2\n\nDr. Da Cunha then refers to two other customs of the Parsees, viz., the disposal of the dead and the Sagdid. These have no parallels among the Hindus, but he compares these customs with those of the Tibetans and of other people of Central Asia.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., XV., pp. 37-64. 24th January 1881.\n\nThis paper gives an outline of the career of Alexander, as described by Firdousi, Mirkhond, Niz\u0101mi and other Persian writers, who wrote \"more than a thousand years after the Greek and Roman classics had produced their accounts of the Macedonian hero.\"\u00b3 Some Persian authors state that this celebrated sovereign was no other than the same two-horned Alexander, Sekander Dhulqarnyn, some of whose exploits are described in the Qor\u00e2n (XVIII.), whilst others assert that the latter has been one of the prophets, and not the same with the Greek Alexander, Sekander R\u00fbmy. The epithet \"two-horned\" is nevertheless applied unanimously to both.\"\u2074\n\nThe descent of Alexander is differently traced. It is said, that he himself liked to trace it from the ancient gods of Greece. Some authors said, that he was the son of an Egyptian Magi. Firdousi says, that he was the son of the daughter of Philip and of D\u00e2r\u00e2 the King of Persia. D\u00e2r\u00e2 had married the daughter of Philip, but after some time, finding that she had a fetid breath, sent her away to her father, where she gave birth to Alexander. Parsee books do not speak of his Persian descent.\n\nRehatsek gives a long quotation from Niz\u0101mi, whose life of Alexander in Persian verse is well-known.\n\nWe learn from this quotation of Niz\u0101mi, the following facts, which are supported by Parsee books:\n\n1. Alexander burnt Zoroastrian books.\n2. The ancient Fire-temples of Persia had treasuries attached to them. We learn from Firdousi and from other sources, that, to a certain extent, these treasuries attached to the Fire-temples served as Public Banks. People deposited their money there for safe custody and also borrowed money from there.\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XIV, p. 9. \u00b2 Ibid.\n\u00b3 Journal, B. B. R. A.

Jamshedi Na'rooz Jashan and the Jashan-i-Sadeh were the principal festivals that were observed in the Fire-temples with great eclat.\n\n5. Zoroastrian women freely attended the Jashans and other public ceremonies performed in the Fire-temples.\n\nThe following lines of Niz\u0101mi, as translated by Rehatsek, describe these facts:\n\nThe chronicler of ancient lore\nSpeaks thus of former times:\nWhen Zoroaster's Faith decayed\nThe fire went out, the ignicolist was burnt.\nAlexander ordered the Eranians\nTo abandon ignolatry,\nTo leave their ancient Faith\nTo embrace that of their new king,\nThe Magi the fire to leave,\nThe fire-temples to destroy.\nIt was the custom of those times,\nIn fire-temples scholars to maintain,\nThe treasures there to guard,\n\nIt was the usage of ignicolists\nTo sit throughout the year with brides;\nOn Jamshyd-new-year's day, and Joshan Sedeh\nTo renovate the temple's festivals;\nFrom all directions maidens young\nTo the temples quickly sped.\nBedecked, with ornaments, adorned,\nThey arrived in crowds with eagerness.\nThe book Barzyn, the magic words of Zend\nWere chanted loud, to reach the sky.\n\nThe well-meaning monarch now ordained:\nRites of the Magi no one should observe,\nNoble brides should show their face\nTo mothers and to husbands alone.\nHe broke the incantations, pictures all\nDispersed the Magi from the Butkhaneh,\nHe cleansed the world from all polluted Faiths\nAnd kept the people orthodox.\n\n1Ibid., p. 45. 2Pazend.\nThis power in the country of Er\u00e2n\nAllowed no Zartosht fires to remain.\n\nThe fire of Mobeds he ordered\nTo be put out with gentleness;\nTo purge the Zend-books from fatuity,\nOr else to place them into libraries.\\(^1\\)\n\nThence he, high minded sovereign,\nSped towards Adharab\u00e2dag\u00e2n.\nWherever he the fire perceived\nHe quenched it and the Zend-books washed.\\(^2\\)\nThat region had a fire, rock-enshrined\nCalled \"incomprehensible\" by ignicolists\nAttended by hundred gold-collared Hyrbads\nPlaced side by side to worship it.\nThat ancient flame to quench,\nHe ordered, and was obeyed.\nHaving extinguished the said fire\nHe marched his troops to Espah\u00e0n;\nThat beauteous and adorned town,\nSo pleasant and so rich,\nRejoiced the heart exceedingly;\nHere many fires were quenched\nAnd their Hyrbads were abased.\nThere was a temple more adorned\nThan pleasure gardens in the spring.\nFor Zartosht's Faith, and Mag\u00fbs rites\nFine brides attended service there,\nAll captivating eyes and hearts.\n\nAlexander is very often referred to in the Pahlavi books of the Parsees. All these books support Niz\u00e2mi, and say, that he destroyed Zoroastrian religion and literature. He is not referred to in the Avesta. The late Professor Darmesteter has, in his article \"Alexandre le Grand dans le Zend-Avesta,\" tried to show that he is once alluded to in the Avesta. But I have shown in my paper before our Society, entitled \"The Antiquity of the Avesta,\" that he is mistaken in taking that view (Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XIX, pp. 275-77).\n\n\\(^1\\) This is an allusion to the fact of the Persian books being translated into Greek.\n\\(^2\\) This is an allusion to the fact, referred to by the Shatr\u00f4h\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n that Alexander got the Zoroastrian books thrown into water. \"And at last the accursed Alexander burnt and threw into the sea the Dinkard (or the collection of religious books) of seven kings\" (vide my Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e1n, Shatr\u00f4h\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n, &c., p. 55).\n\\(^3\\) Revue des \u00c9tudes Grecques, 1892.\n\"It is just a century ago that Anquetil du Perron published his French translation of the Zend-Avest\u00e2, or the theological, physical and moral ideas of the law-giver Zarathustra, the ceremonies of the divine service which he established, and several important traits respecting the ancient history of the Persians. This translation, however, had the only merit of introducing the literary world to the chief contents of the sacred books of the Zarathustrians, and furnishing Europe with all the materials necessary for eager researches in this important field. His work, although utterly incorrect and inaccurate, nevertheless became thus a powerful stimulus to future studies of the Zend-Avest\u00e2 in a critical and philological way. Burnouf, Westergaard, Haug, Spiegel and Kossowicz, who investigated, in a scientific way, into the right understanding of the Zend-Avest\u00e2, would never have succeeded in laying down a foundation of Zend philology without Anquetil's labours.\n\nUnder the manuscripts brought by him from India to Paris, there were three copies of Nery\u00f4sangh's Sanskrit translation of the Yasna, or the prayer-book of the Parsee priesthood, which translation has been published by Spiegel in 1861 at Leipzig. Of a Sanskrit translation of the Khordah-Avest\u00e2, or the Yashts, by the same author nothing was known. Dr. F\u00fchrer was fortunate to find in the libraries of Jamaspjee Dustur Minocherjee and Peshotun Dustur Behramjee three manuscripts containing the Zend and Pazend text, the Pahlavi and Sanskrit translations of the Khordah-Avest\u00e2, or the prayer-book for the daily use of the Zarathustrian laity.\n\nSpeaking extensively about the scientific value of this translation, Dr. F\u00fchrer pointed out that, though Nery\u00f4sangh's Sanskrit translation is not founded upon the original Zend text, but upon the Pahlavi version, and though he committed many mistakes against the spirit of the Sanskrit language, yet his translation is an admirable memorial of mental training of the Parsee of former times, and of great value for Sanskrit as well as for Zend scholars. Finally, Dr. F\u00fchrer gave some notes on the three manuscripts upon which his essay relies. The oldest and best manuscript belongs to Dustur Jamaspjee, the date is given in the Nikah or marriage-prayer, Samvat 1400 = 1342 A.D. In order to show the old age of the book, and the peculiarity of the Pazend characters, which are not to be found elsewhere, Dr. F\u00fchrer presented a photograph of the last part of the Patet Aderb\u00e2t, or a formulary of confession, which answers exactly to the Buddhist P\u00e0timokkha, or the\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XVI, Proceedings at the end, p. i-ii.\nwords of disburdenment. Of the other two manuscripts, one belongs again to Dustur Jamaspjee; it is dated Yezdezerd 1152=1783 A.D., and the other belonging to Dustur Peshotun is, according to the Persian colophon on the end, a copy of Dustur Jamaspjee's second manuscript. All three manuscripts contain essentially the same text; more important modifications are seldom to be met with, but striking similarities of special mistakes. As regards the time of Nery\u00f4sangh, little is known. According to the generally accepted traditions, Nery\u00f4sangh was the leader of the Parsees emigrating from Persia to India, and the learned Dustur who explained to king Jader\u00e2na (Jayadeva of Anhillavada Pattan, 745=806 A.D.), the Mazdayasian belief in 16 slokas, and who consecrated the first fire-temple at Sanj\u00e2na in Samvat 777=719 A.D., and 87 Yezdezerd. But historical records for the exactness of this date are still wanting. The old age of the manuscript and the form of the Sanskrit which Nery\u00f4sangh writes, prove as distinctly as possible that he lived before the twelfth century of our era.\"\n\nAt the end of the paper, Dr. F\u00fchrer expressed a \"hope to publish very soon Nery\u00f4sangh's Sanskrit translation of the whole Khordah Avest\u00e2.\" That hope has not been fulfilled as yet. But, I am glad to say, that the attention of the Trustees of the Parsee Punchayet having been drawn to this desideratum, they have resolved to publish a collated edition, not only of the Sanskrit translation of the Khordah Avest\u00e2, but of all the Sanskrit translations of Parsee books. The work has been entrusted to Mr. Sheriarji D\u00e2d\u00e2bhoy Broacha, who, owing to his profound study of the ancient languages of the Parsees and his knowledge of the Sanskrit, is able to do full justice to the subject. The Trustees of the Parsee Punchayet have collected and placed at his disposal, as many old manuscripts as they could.\n\nAs to the subject of the date of Nery\u00f4sangh, as pointed out by Dr. F\u00fchrer, Dr. Haug places Nery\u00f4sangh in the fifteenth century. Dr. West also, at one time, placed him in the fifteenth century. But he seems to have now modified his opinion. I had the pleasure of studying this question at Dr. West's suggestion, in 1891. I have embodied the results of my studies in a paper, read before the Jarthoshti Din-ni khol karn\u00e2ri Mandli on 25th April 1896. I have since, published that paper, in my Iranian Essays, Part III. Therein, I have placed\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XVI, p. 85.\n2 Ibid., p. 85 note.\n3 Haug's pamphlet \"Ueber den Gegenw\u00e4rtigen Stand der Zend philologie,\" i.e., \"The Present State of Zend Philology,\" p. 6.\n4 West's edition of the Mainyo-i-Khard (1871), p. x, and his second edition of Haug's Essays (1878), p. 55.

It appears from the correspondence I had on the subject, that Dr. West also comes to the same conclusion. Dr. West says: \"After considering it carefully, I have come to much the same conclusion as yourself, as to the time of Neryosang, but by a somewhat different method. . . . So we may conclude from these data, that Neryosang flourished in the latter part of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century, as you have also concluded from other data.\"\n\nNow, as to \"the accepted tradition of the Parsis,\" as referred to by Dr. F\u00fchrer, that Neryosangh explained the Mazdayasn\u00e2n religion in fifteen or sixteen slokas to king J\u00e2d\u00ea R\u00e2n\u00e2 of Sanj\u00e2n, who, as Dr. F\u00fchrer says, and as said by Dr. Wilson before him, may have been Jayadeva or Vanar\u00e2ja, of Anhilw\u00e2d P\u00e2tan, who ruled in Gujar\u00e2t 745-804 A.D., and that he \"consecrated the first \u00c2tish Bahr\u00e2m (fire-temple) at Sanj\u00e2n in Samvat 777=A.D. 720 and 87 Yazdezerd,\" we find, that there are no facts to support that oral tradition.\n\nFirstly, if the King J\u00e2d\u00ea R\u00e2n\u00e2, was Jayadeva of Anhilw\u00e2d P\u00e2tan, the date (720 A.D.) of the consecration of the fire-temple as given by the above tradition and that of the reign of that R\u00e2j\u00e2 do not correspond. The Raja (A.D. 745-804 or 806) had not come to his throne, at the time, when the fire-temple is said to have been consecrated in 720 A.D., and at the time when the Parsees are said to have landed at Sanj\u00e2n five years before this event.\n\nThe dates, as given by the tradition, are not correct. The date for the consecration of the fire-temple (790 A.D.), arrived at by me on the authority of the historical poem, the Kisseh-i-Sanj\u00e2n, and on that of other historical works of Mahomedan authors, such as the Tabak\u00e2t-i-Akbari, Mir\u00e2t-i Sekandari, and T\u00e2rikh-i-Ferishta, falls within the period of Jayadeva's reign.\n\nAgain, if Neryosangh had been the person who consecrated the fire-temple, and if he was the celebrated author of the Sanskrit version of the Avesta, his name would have been mentioned by the author of the Kisseh-i-Sanj\u00e2n, who speaks at some length about the landing at Sanj\u00e2n and about the consecration of the fire-temple. Anyhow, if we admit, that there was a Nery\u00f4sangh, who consecrated the first fire-temple at Sanj\u00e2n, then, it appears, that this Nery\u00f4sangh must be quite a different person from the well-known Nery\u00f4sangh who gave us the Sanskrit versions.\n\n1 Dr. West's letter, dated 8th July 1891, published in my Iranian Essays, Part III, p. 159 note.\n2 Journal, B.

I and II, my article on this subject, entitled \"A Few Events in the Early History of the Parsees and their Dates.\"\nThis paper is not printed in the Journal of our Society, but a brief outline of the paper, as given in the proceedings of our Journal, runs as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Darmesteter said, that he wanted to propose a problem to the Meeting, the solution of which might interest the historian as to the literary relation between India and Persia. He drew attention to what he termed the striking similarity between the episode in the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata, known as the renunciation of Yudhisthira, king of Delhi, and the renunciation of Kaikhosroo in the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2mah.\" By Professor James Darmesteter.\n\nYudhisthira, after having re-conquered his kingdom, which had been usurped by his cousins, the Kurus, became disgusted with the world, and sought to leave it and go to heaven. He set out to heaven with his four brothers and their common wife Draupadi. They crossed the Himalayas and then saw Mount Meru, which was believed to be the seat of heaven beyond a sea of sand. In crossing this desert, Yudhisthira's brothers and wife fell one by one exhausted and died, and he entered heaven alone. In the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2mah, Kaikhosroo, king of Persia, after avenging the murder of his parents on his grandfather, Afr\u00e2sy\u00e2b, king of Tur\u00e2n, left the earth disgusted, and also set out for heaven. His noblemen and several faithful followers accompanied him on his journey against his warnings. They crossed a mountain, and arrived at a desert of sand, but in passing through it they were killed, also buried, during the night in a snow storm. After the storm was over, the king was seen no more. He was supposed to have been translated to heaven during the storm. Mr. Darmesteter thought, that the similarity between the two legends was too particular to be accounted for, except by assuming, that they were borrowed from one another, or from some common source. As there was evidence that the legend of Kaikhosroo was as old as Alexander's time, and on the other side, as the style and the treatment of the Hindoo episode seemed to show it to have been a modern addition to the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata, the lecturer was inclined to think, that it was borrowed from Persian, either through literary connection or from old tradition. The Professor attempted to show that the Persian legend was borrowed to the last detail by the Hebrew writers of the Sepher Hayashar, a legendary history of the Jewish people, written in the Middle Ages, and applied to Patriarch Enoch.\"\n\n1 Journal, B.B.R.A.S., Vol. XVII., Part I., No. XLVI., Abstract of the Society's Proceedings, pp. ii-iv. In this abstract, Prof. Darmesteter is reported to have stated, that in the Persian episode, Kaikhosroo avenged the death of his parents, but the fact is, that it was the death of his father alone that he had to avenge.\nIn the interesting discussion that followed, the late Hon'ble Mr. Telang entered a mild caveat against \"the drawing of historical conclusions from resemblances, such as these pointed out by Mr. Darmesteter.\" He said that \"the resemblances, of course, were striking; but the differences were, to his mind, even more striking, and he had long been of opinion, that it was highly unsafe to allow arguments founded upon them to come in conflict with conclusions arrived at in other ways.\"\n\nProfessor Darmesteter has treated the subject at greater length in a paper which he subsequently read before \"La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique\" of Paris on 24th June 1887 under the title of \"Points de Contact entre le Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata et le Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2mah.\" This paper in French was, as it were, a reply of the learned Professor to the mild caveat of the late Hon'ble Mr. Telang. Therein, he has supported his theory of the Persian origin of the episode.\n\nI think, that the story of Kaikhosroo in the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh, has, in its commencement, a parallel in the story of Hamlet, as described in the early chronicles, from which Shakespeare has taken the plot of his play. I have referred to it in my Gujar\u00e2ti D\u00e2st\u00e2n of the story of Kaikhosroo.\n\nNow, this is not the only episode wherein we find striking resemblances between its Persian and Indian forms. The Persian episode of Hom\u00e2e, Behe-\u00e2frid and Arj\u00e2sp has been shown to have its parallel in the Indian episode of Sit\u00e2 and R\u00e2van in the R\u00e2m\u00e2y\u00e2n.\n\nDr. H. G. Bhandarkar's paper on the \"Consideration of the date of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata, in connection with the Correspondence from Col. Ellis\" may be read with advantage in connection with the question of the date of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata raised in this paper.\n\nThere was a time, when it was said, that the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata was written as late as the 16th Century A.D. In the 9th volume of the Asiatic Researches, a copper-plate grant is described by Colebrooke as being given by a celebrated monarch Janam\u00eajaya, son of P\u00e2ricsh\u00eet, \"at the time of a partial eclipse of the sun, which fell on a Sunday in the month of the Chaitra, when the sun was entering the northern hemisphere; the moon being in the Nacshatra \u00c2swini.\" Now \"from calculations made by the Rev. G. B. Gibbons and Professor Airy,\" it\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid., p. iv.\n2 Ibid.\n3 Journal Asiatique, 1887, Huiti\u00e8me S\u00e9rie, Tome X, pp. 38\u201475.

So, if the copper-plate is genuine, it evidently follows, that the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata was written after 1521 A.D. But the copper-plate grant was supposed to be spurious and not genuine by Colebrooke, on the ground of its modern characters and incorrect language. Professor Bhandarkar also considers it spurious on the ground, that there are evidences which show that the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata is very old. Dr. Bhandarkar's paper on the subject is very interesting.

He has written a good deal on these people in his periodical, \"The Asiatic Quarterly.\"\n\nHis paper on the Hunza language draws the attention of a Parsee, because it treats of the Huns, a people, who with the D\u00e2nu, were held, in the Avesta and Pahlavi books of the Parsees, to be very hostile to the Ancient Ir\u00e2ni\u00e2n. As the D\u00e2nu people, referred to in the Avesta, seem to have given their names to countries and rivers like Denmark, Danube, Don, Dneiper and Dneister, so the Hunus (Huns) have given their names to distant countries like Hungary in the West and Hunza (i.e., the place j\u00e2l of the Huns) in the East. According to Dr. Haug, these Hunus (Yasht [Farvardin] XIII., 100; XIX. [Jamy\u00e2d], 86) were the Hunas of the Vishnu Pur\u00e2na. Dowson says, on the authority of Wilson, that these Hunus were the White Hunas or Indo-Scythians, who in the first century of the Christian era occupied the Indian frontiers. They are referred to by Arrian, Strabo\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. X., p. 81. Professor Bhandarkar's article on the date of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata.\n2 Asiatic Researches.

Gordon,\u00b3 Zoroastrian countries up to about 500 or 700 years ago. The ruins of three old Zoroastrian fortresses are still seen at Wakhan. Lieut. Wood\u2074 also refers to the Zoroastrian rule over this country. The very name Wakhan is derived by some from the Avesta word Veh, which is the name of a river (Veh-rud)\u2075.

S., Vol. XVII., pp. 97\u2014136, 15th and 22nd April 1887.\n\nThis paper was read in two parts. It is the first paper by a Parsee gentleman that has appeared in the Journal of the Society since its foundation in 1804. The late respected Dastur Dr. Peshotan Byramjee Sanjana, the father of the learned author of this paper, and the late lamented Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee Patel had submitted before the Society, in 1853, their papers on the reading of the Pahlavi Inscriptions\u2077 at H\u00e2ji\u00e2b\u00e2d. Though resolved at one of the meetings of the Society,\u2078 that both the papers may be published, we do not find them published in the Journal, probably on account of the difficulty of getting the proper set of Pahlavi types.\u2079\n\nThe subject of the paper of Dastur Darab is one, which is, at times, pointed out as a weak point in the religion of the Ancient Iranians. It is referred to, not only by the Greek, Roman and other Western\n\n\u00b9 Richardson's Persian Dictionary.

That a few of the Pahlavi passages, which are alleged to contain actual references to such marriages, do not allude to social realities, but to supernatural conceptions relating to the creation of the first progenitors of mankind.\n\nIV. \"That the words of the Prophet Zarathushtra himself, which are preserved in one of the strophes of the G\u0101th\u0101, Chap. LIII., express a highly moral ideal of the marriage relation.\"\n\nI. As regards the first proposition, viz., the classical testimony on the subject, the author has very clearly shown, not only on the authority of later European writers, but upon that of the Greek writers themselves, that much reliance cannot be placed upon them all, that their information was, to a great extent, second-hand, and that the conclusions, that they have come to on the few facts that have come to their notice, are not sound. As shown by Rawlinson,\u2074 in the very classical times, some looked with suspicion to the truthfulness of their predecessors. For example, Ctesias and Plutarch have doubted the veracity of Herodotus.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Bk. I., Slok\u0101s 308-309, vide Troyer's R\u0101djatarangini; Histoire des Rois du Kachmir, Tome I., Texte Sanskrit p. 34, Tome II Traduction, p. 34. That these odious charges have latterly begun to be laid by the later copyists of the R\u0101jatarangini, is shown by the fact, that the slokas given and translated by Troyer are not given by the Cashmere manuscripts. Dr. Stein does not give them in his text (Kalhana's R\u0101jatarangini or Chronicle of the kings of Kashmir (1892) Vol. I, p. 14). In his translation (1900, Vol. I, p. 46) he says on this point: \"After this verse (sl. 307), the Calcutta and Paris editions insert two slokas, which are not found in A. L. or any Kashmirian Manuscript . . . I have not been able to trace the original of this interpolation . . . \"\n\n\u00b2 Vide my paper on \"Cashmere and the Ancient Persians.\" Journal, B. B. R. A.

S., Vol. XVII., p. 106.\nWe have seen above\\(^1\\), that Col. Vans Kennedy, has, in his paper, entitled \"Remarks on the Chronology of Persian History previous to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great,\"\\(^2\\) tried to show, that the statements of Greek writers must not be taken as gospel truth. Looking to the statements of some classical writers, towards whom we can look with respect as some kind of authority, the only conclusion, that we can come to, is this, that, as \"one swallow does not make summer,\" so, the cases\u2014even if they be facts\u2014of particular kings like Cambyses, indulging in such next-of-kin marriages, do not show at all, that the improper practice was common among the whole Persian nation. The words of Herodotus are quite clear, when he says, that the Judges, on being consulted by Cambyses for such a marriage, told him, that \"they did not find any law allowing\"\\(^3\\) such marriages. We find Plutarch saying a similar thing about the consanguineous marriage of Artaxerxes II. He says, that he was persuaded to enter into such a marriage \"without regarding the laws and opinions of the Greeks.\"\\(^4\\) The very fact, that, as said by Plutarch, \"he endeavoured to conceal it (i.e., his illicit love for his daughter) on his mother's account and restrained it in public,\"\\(^5\\) shows, that such marriages were held improper by the Persians as a nation.\n\nComing to the Sassanian times, Agathias refers to the marriage of K\u014db\u0101d I with his daughter Sambyke. Firdousi does not refer to such a marriage by K\u014db\u0101d, but, even taking it to be a fact as stated by Agathias, we know, that K\u014db\u0101d was under the influence of Mazdak, the Ir\u0101nian socialist,\\(^6\\) who preached, that both wealth and women must indiscriminately be the common property of all men. According to Firdousi, he preached as follows:\n\n\"Five things turn us away from righteousness. The wise do not add any other thing to these. They are jealousy, anger, revenge and want; and the fifth is ambition. If you conquer these five \\(divs\\), (i.e., evil passions), the path of God will be clear before you. Women and wealth are (the cause of) these five for us. They destroy good religion in the world. If you wish, that no harm should come to good religion, the woman and wealth should not come in our way. It is these two, (i.e., woman and wealth) that produce, jealousy, ambition, want, anger and revenge in secret. It is for these, that the Devil turns the heads of the wise. So, it is necessary that these two, (i.e., woman and wealth) may be placed in the midst of all, (i.e., for common participation).\"\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Vide Supra* 171-76.  \n\\(^2\\) Transactions, L.

Coming to his second proposition, with respect to the meaning of the Avesta word Khetvadatha, Dastur Darab has shown, that the word does not admit of that interpretation as the one sought to be placed upon it. He is supported on this point by Dr. E. W. West. Sir Raymond West, the then learned President of our Society, in his very learned and lucid observations on the paper, suggested, that the word meant something like svayamdatha (i.e., giving up one's self in devotion to God) in Sanskrit.\n\nIII. Coming to his third proposition, the author refers to the several passages in Pahlavi relating to Khetvadatha collected by Dr. West. I may here point out two more books in the Pahlavi literature, that refer to this subject, which have escaped the attention of Dr. West. One is the Aiy\u00e2dg\u00e2r-i-Zar\u00eer\u00e2n, wherein king Visht\u00e2sp speaks of Hut\u00f4sh as being his wife and \"like a sister\" to him. The passage in this book is similar to that of the Ard\u00e2i Vir\u00e2t-n\u00e2meh, and can be similarly explained. Again, we know that the Hut\u00f4sh, who is spoken of in the Pahlavi text as the wife of Visht\u00e2sp, is the Kait\u00e2yun of the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh, wherein we are told, that she was the daughter of the Kaisar of Roum. So evidently, she cannot be the real sister of Visht\u00e2sp.\n\nThe second book I refer to, is the unpublished Vajirih\u00e2-i-Din in the library of the late Mr. Tehmurus Dinshaw Anklesaria. This manuscript is otherwise known as the \"Riv\u00e2yat of H\u00eamit-i-Ashavahisht\u00e2n.\" (Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie II, Band I, Lieferung III. Pahlavi Literature by E. W. West, p. 105). The exact title of the work as given in the manuscript is \"P\u00fbrsishnih\u00e2 a\u00eachand min huparvart A\u00eamit-i-Ashavahisht\u00e2n pursit li \u00c2tr\u00f4-gosh\u00e2sp-i Mitr\u00f4-At\u00e2sh-i-\u00c2tr\u00f4-gosh\u00e2sp,\" i.e., \"Some questions asked by me, \u00c2tr\u00f4-goshasp of Mitr\u00f4-At\u00e2sh of \u00c2tr\u00f4-gosh\u00e2sp, to the saint A\u00eamit-i-Ashavahisht\u00e2n.\" The passages occur on folio 148a, ll. 1\u201414 and folio 149b, l. 12 to folio 150b, l. 2.\n\nIV. In the fourth and the last proposition, the author tries to show the high moral ideal of the marriage relation, as depicted in the 53rd chapter of the Ya\u00e7na, known as the marriage hymn of the marriage of the daughter of the Prophet.\n\nThe observations made on the paper by the President, Sir Raymond West, form in themselves, as it were, a short, learned, and interesting paper, worth reading for the light it throws upon the question from what we may call a non-Zoroastrian point of view.\n\nThe interesting paper of Dastur Darab is, as Dr. Casartelli very justly says, \"quite the best and fullest statement of the modern Parsi\n\n---\n\n1 S.

It has received a reply from the pen of Dr. Casartelli. In his reply, Dr. Casartelli refers to the episode of Soud\u00e2beh and Si\u00e2vaksh, as given by Firdousi, and as referred to by Professor Italo Pizzi in his \"Epopea Persiana e la Vita e i Costumi dei Tempi Eroici di Persia, Firenze 1888. (The Epic of Persia and the Manners and Customs of the Heroic Age of Persia.).\" The reply of Dr. Casartelli, as far as it refers to this episode, has received a rejoinder from Dastur Darab in a pamphlet entitled \"Sy\u00e2vaksh and Sudabeh (1892).\"\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XVII., Part II, No. XLIII., Abstract of Proceedings, p. V., 16th January 1889.\n\nThis was the first paper that I had read before our Society. It was more of a lecture than a paper, and it was delivered as such. So it is not published in the Journal of the Society. It was afterwards published in a pamphlet form. In 1888, the Persian Government had opened the river K\u00e2run to trade, and so the event had suggested the subject to me. I said in the beginning of the paper: \"The opening of the river K\u00e2run to trade by the Persian Government is a welcome news for England and India. Though the concessions originally granted at the instance of Sir H. D. Wolff, our present Plenipotentiary at Persia, are one by one being withdrawn, we must accept them as the thin end of the wedge, and wait for better results.\" We are sorry to note now, that even after waiting for a period of 17 years, the better results have not come in as yet.\n\nThe paper is divided into two parts. I. In the first part I trace the course of the river from its source downwards, on the authority of the works of travel of Sir Henry Layard, Lieutenant Selby, Commander Jones, Sir Henry Rawlinson, and other travellers, and describe the cities situated on the banks of the river, particularly dwelling on the town of Ahw\u00e2z and the ancient waterworks of the Sassanian times near it as described by Firdousi. II. In the second part I trace the name of the river K\u00e2run to its ancient name in the Avesta and Pahlavi books.\n\nIn number 1902 (Vol. XXXVII, May 3, 1889, pp. 561-67) of the Journal of the Society of Arts, Major-Gen. Sir R. Murdoch Smith has written an interesting paper on the subject, and thereia has referred to this paper and its quotations from the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh.\n\n1 The Babylonian and Oriental Record, Vol. III., No. 8 p. 169, July 1889.\n2 Ibid. This reply is published in a separate pamphlet form under the title of \"What was Khvetuk-Das? and other papers.\"\n3 Vide his pamphlet \"Some Marriage and Funeral Customs of Ancient Persia (Re-printed from the Babylonian and Oriental Record, 1890.)\"\n4 For my remarks on the Next-of-kin Marriages, referred to by Herodotus, I would refer my readers to my \"\u0634\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647\u200c\u06cc \u0634\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647\u200c\u06cc\" (The Ancient Persians according to Herodotus and Strabo), pp. 66-68.\nIn this paper, I have tried to show, that the game of cricket, which the modern Parsees of India have learnt from their rulers, is a game which was known to their ancestors, the Ancient Persians. International matches were, as now, played in Ancient Persia \"under the captainship of the leading men of the rival races. They were played with an accompaniment of music, just as we see at the present day.\"\n\nIn this paper, I have treated the subject of the play, as described by Firdousi only. But in one of my lectures before the Gujarati Dny\u00e2n Pras\u00e2rak Society, I have treated the subject at greater length, and as referred to in the Pahlavi K\u00e2r-n\u00e2meh of Ardeshir B\u00e2beg\u00e2n and in other works.\n\nSir Raymond West, the then President of our Society, in his farewell address to the Society, delivered on 21st April 1892, said that the author \"showed good reason for thinking that the game of polo, so much in vogue now among our young military officers at such a cost of life and limb, took its rise from the Persians in ancient days, whose chief accomplishments were 'to draw the bow, ride and tell the truth.'\" He added, \"I trust their successors and descendants in this country will always continue to speak the truth, ride well, and when they draw the bow, not to let it be the long bow.\"\n\nThe knowledge of the ancient history of Assyria is, to a certain extent, necessary for the purpose of the ancient history of Persia. Nineveh, the ancient capital of Assyria, is counted as a city of Ir\u00e2n, by the Pahlavi treatise of the Shatr\u00f4\u00eeh\u00e2-i-Air\u00e2n.\n\nIn this paper, which, as the then President, Sir Raymond West, said in his farewell address to the Society, was a valuable paper, as it traced the source of some of the Assyrian relics of our Society, Mr. Karkaria tries to identify 10 stone slabs in the possession of the Society. At first, he thought, that they belonged either to the Layard Collection that was sent to the British Museum from Basrah via Bombay, and was exhibited here for some time, or to what he called\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B.

Subsequently, he reported to the Society, that further investigations led him to say with certainty, that they belonged to the Rawlinson-Clerk Collection. Mr. Karkaria referred to 12 pieces of the slabs, and of these 12, he tried to identify 10. Mr. Javerilal Umiashanker Yajnik, the then Secretary, examined, with the author of the paper, the Rawlinson-Clerk Collection, and said, that he was satisfied that Mr. Karkaria had succeeded \"in identifying 9 out of the 10 slabs in the possession of the Society with those forming part of the Rawlinson present.\"\u00b9\n\nI may here point out, that Sir Henry Rawlinson had, at a Special Meeting on 7th April 1855,\u00b2 presided over by Lord Elphinstone, delivered a *viva voce* discourse on his \"Researches and Discoveries in Assyria and Babylonia.\"\u00b3 During that discourse, \"he exhibited on the table a collection of antiquities, which he had lately obtained in Chaldea, Assyria, and Babylonia, and which he was carrying to England for deposit in the British Museum.\"\u2074 So, I think that the unidentified slabs are relics exhibited by himself before our Society, and either left inadvertently here by him when re-packing his exhibits, or probably presented to the Society.\u2075\n\n*Journal, B.

This imperfect translation of the Persian mutilated version led some to believe that the views of Vir\u00e2f were derived from the Christian source of Isaiah's Ascent. But the late Dr. Haug, who was the first to write upon this subject, and whose learned presence in our midst as the Professor of Sanskrit at the Deccan College had greatly helped and encouraged Iranian studies, has clearly shown that this was not the case. M. Barth\u00e9lemy, in his excellent translation (Livre d'Ard\u00e2 Vir\u00e2f), wherein he has dwelt upon some of these striking points of resemblance, agrees with Dr. Haug.\"\n\nJournal, B. B. R.

It is a beautifully written manuscript, with some fine pictures of the scenes supposed to have been seen in Heaven and Hell.\n\n2 Introduction, p. xxvii. 3 Journal, B. B. R. A.

He has presented a parallel between Firdousi's Story of Behr\u00e2m Chobin and the Story of Macbeth as given by Holinshed in his Chronicles of Scotland, which have given to Shakespeare the materials for the plot of his play of Macbeth.\nThis paper is somewhat connected with the auspicious event of Her late Majesty's Golden Jubilee. On 2nd February 1887, the late Professor James Darmesteter, who was then on a visit to India, delivered at a meeting, presided over by the late Sir Jamsetji Jejeebhoy, Third Baronet, a lecture on \"Parseeism: its Place in History.\" In that lecture he recommended the publication of the Pahlavi literature of the Parsees. He said, \"What we require is not a translation of the books I have mentioned, but the mere text of them...\" In a few days you are going to celebrate the Jubilee of the Queen-Empress, the golden marriage of India with England, the golden marriage of the East with Western civilization. You will join with your usual munificence in the public festivities; but if you want to impress particularly the Parsee mark upon your demonstration of loyalty, what better opportunity could be found at the same time to perform a duty to your race and to do honour to the Queen of the West than by showing how deeply you have imbibed the Western spirit of science and research? In your banquets it is usual to have three toasts\u2014one to Ormazd and the Amashaspands, the second to the Ferouers of the ancestors, the third to the Queen-Empress. Let, therefore, the Ferouers of the ancestors have here also their part in the festival; let the revival of your literature, let the raising of the Jubilee Pahlavi Fund be the Parsee Memorial to the Jubilee of the Queen-Empress!\"  \n\nThe words of the late Professor did not fall on deaf years. Dastur Darab, the author of the paper under review, the late lamented Dastur Pheroze Jamaspji Jamaspasana and myself formed ourselves, under the kind guidance of our guide, friend and philosopher, Mr. K. R. Cama, into a Committee to collect funds for the purpose. I remember having gone with the above two gentlemen to the houses of several rich Parsee gentlemen for the purpose. Our work, no sooner than commenced, was kindly undertaken by the Trustees of the Parsee Punchayet, who started a fund for the purpose under the name of \"The Victoria Jubilee Pahlavi Text Fund,\" and nominated a Committee for the selection of books to be printed. The Nirangistan was the first book published under the auspices of the above Fund. It is printed by the photo-zinco process. Dastur Darab was the first Honorary Secretary of The Victoria Jubilee Pahlavi Text Fund Committee, and, as such, has edited the book. The second book published from this Fund is the Madig\u00e2n-i-Haz\u00e2r Dadist\u00e2n, and is edited by me. The third,\n\n---\n\n1 Vide the Lecture printed at the Bombay Gazette Press, p. 14. Vide the Bombay Gazette of 5th February 1887.\n\n2 Ibid, pp. 15-16.\nthat is being published, is the Grand Bundehesh, belonging to the late Mr. Tehmurus Dinshaw Anklesaria, who was a great Pahlavi scholar, and whose death, last year, is a great loss to the cause of Pahlavi studies.\n\nNow, the paper under review was written by Dastur Darab as an introduction to the above volume of the Nirangistan. As Dr. West says, the \"Pahlavi literature may be divided into three classes. I. First, Pahlavi translations of Avesta texts, intermingled with Pahlavi commentary. II. Second, purely Pahlavi texts on religious subjects, or connected with religion. III. Third, Pahlavi texts on miscellaneous subjects not intimately connected with religion.\" The Nirangistan is a book which falls under the first head, and \"is chiefly concerned with the ritual in Sassanian times, the drons, temperance, recital of the G\u00e2th\u00e2s, effect of the sin of a priest on rites, the G\u00e2hs and G\u00e2h\u00e2nb\u00e2rs, holy-water, the kust\u00ee and sudra, barsom, firewood and H\u00f4m-mortar.\"\n\nThe manuscript of the Nirangistan, published as said above, belongs to Dastur Hoshang J\u00e2m\u00e2sp of Poona. It is incomplete, and a part of the last portion is replaced from an old manuscript belonging to the late Mr. Tehemurus Dinshaw Anklesaria. As pointed out by Dastur Darab, the first part of the book, which generally goes under the name of the Nirangistan, forms a part of another book called Airpatast\u00e2n.\n\nSince the publication of the Nirangistan, the late Dr. Darmesteter has published the transliteration and translation of the Avesta portion of the book in his Zend Avesta. The publication of this text and translation is followed by that of \"Index Verborum of the Fragments of the Avesta\" by Mr. Montgomery Schuyler, as the fourth volume of the Columbia University Indo-Iranian series, edited by Prof. A. V. W. Jackson. The object of this publication is, as said by its author, \"to render easily accessible a large body of lexicographical material hitherto almost neglected by scholars.\"\n\nJournal, B.

I have given an interpretation of the bas-relief, that is quite different from that given by Kerr Porter, who thought, that the bas-relief illustrated, what he calls the \"royal union,\" i.e., the union of king Behr\u00e2m Gour with his queen after a short estrangement, as related by Malcolm, in a story, which, for the sake of convenience, we may call, the story of \"Nekoo karden z pur kurden est,\" i.e., \"Practice makes perfect.\" I have tried to show in this paper, that it illustrates Behr\u00e2m Gour's marriage with the Indian princess Sepihnud.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XIX., pp. 215\u2014223, 15th October 1875.\n\nIn this paper, the author tries to show, that the argument used in the \"refutation of Atheism contained in the fifth and sixth chapters\" of the Parsee book Shikand Gum\u00e2n\u00eek Vij\u00e2r, \"presents a very close resemblance to the argument of M. Lucilius Balbus, the spokesman of the Stoics in the famous dialogue of Cicero, called the De Natura Deorum.\"\n\nMr. Karkaria says, \"I do not say anything about the later writer (Mard\u00e2n-farukh, the author of the Shikand Gum\u00e2n\u00eek Vij\u00e2r) borrowing from the earlier (Cicero). . . . Mardan says explicitly that he got these arguments from the Dinkard of Adirfrobag. . . . Probably, the editors of the Dinkard might have seen Greek philosophical works.\"\n\nI think, that \"The Argument from Design\", used in the Shikand Gum\u00e2n\u00eek Vij\u00e2r, was suggested to the author, in a natural way, as it is the most common argument used in the question of \"The Existence of the Deity.\" It is used in an indirect way, in the form of questions in the older writings of the Avesta, the G\u00e2th\u00e2s(Ya\u00e7na, ch.44).\n\nThe subject proper of the paper has a very long introduction, and in it, the author quotes at some length the views of Dr. West on the subject of the final loss of the Ir\u00e2anian literature. Dr. West is of opinion, that the conquered Parsees of Ir\u00e2n were equally responsible with the conquering Arabs for the loss of their literature. I differ from Dr. West, and repeat here what I said about 13 years ago in my review in the \"Times of India\" of his translation of the Dinkard. \"It is very true that the first inroad of the Arabs did not do all the mischief at once. It was a slow and gradual work, and by the end of the second century after the conquest, the work of destruction was com-\n\n---\n\n1 In the Conversazione, held in connection with the Centenary of our Society, on 18th January 1905, Mr. Kaikhusr\u00fb Ardesbir Chinoy exhibited some very excellent old Persian pictures, illustrating several scenes from the Shah-n\u00e2meh.

If the twenty-one Nusks were all extant at the time when \u00c2dar Farobag wrote, whence the necessity for writing the contents? If the zeal for preserving this literature prompted them to do the work, why did they do it half-heartedly by merely preserving the contents and not by making copies and distributing them?\"\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XIX., pp. 224\u2014236, 21st November 1895.\n\n\"India is the original home of the game of chess. From India, it was introduced into Persia in the time of the Great Noushirw\u00e2n or Chosroes I. The Arabs, who subsequently conquered Persia, introduced it into Spain on their conquest of the country. Spain spread it into other parts of Europe. Though some seem to be of opinion, that it was the Crusaders who brought it from the East, many are of opinion, that it was known in Europe long before the Crusades, and that it was known in England before the Norman Conquest. As to its Indian origin, Sir William Jones in his paper\u00b9 on 'The Indian Game of Chess' says: 'If evidence be required to prove that chess was invented by the Hindus, we may be satisfied with the testimony of the Persians.'\"\n\nIn this paper, I have adduced the testimony of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Persian writers, viz., Firdousi.\n\nI. At first, I describe the story of Firdousi which led to the discovery of the game. The story says, that in a war between two brother princes, one died of sheer exhaustion and fatigue. Their royal mother suspected the surviving brother of killing his brother in the battle, and did not believe, that, he, being shut up on all sides by the enemy, was killed by exhaustion and fatigue. The surviving brother, in order to convince his mother, that, in a battle, a king can be so shut up on all sides and die of sheer exhaustion and fatigue, got this game invented.\n\nII. Secondly, I give Firdousi's description of the game.\n\nIII. Thirdly, I describe the circumstances, under which the game was introduced into Persia from India in the time of the Great Noushirw\u00e2n, who, in his turn, gave to India the game of \"Nard,\" a kind of backgammon.\n\nIV. Fourthly, I give \"two other versions about the origin and discovery of the game of chess\" as \"given by Caxton, the first English printer, in his book 'The Game of Chess,'\"\n\n\u00b9 Asiatic Researches, Vol. II., p. 159. \u00b2 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XIX., p. 224.\n\u00b3 Ibid., p. 234.\nThe subject of the paper was suggested to me by a visit in May 1895 to Cashmere, where I had heard many of the stories of the Ancient Persians as described by Firdousi. Cashmere was once a Zoroastrian country. In this paper, I have spoken at some length on the following subjects:\n\n1. References to the country of Cashmere in the Avesta and Pahlavi books.\n\n2. References to the country in the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh of Firdousi.\n\n3. The relation of the Ancient Persians to Cashmere, referred to by Wilson in his \"Essay on the Hindu History of Kashmir.\"\n\n4. The Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2meh stories heard in Cashmere.\n\n5. The Cypress of Kashmar.\n\nThis paper is a reply to the late lamented Dr. Darmesteter, who, in his Zend Avesta, has tried to bring down the antiquity of the Avesta to as late as the third century after Christ. His assertions had, as the late Professor Max M\u00fcller said, thrown a bomb-shell into the peaceful camp of Oriental scholars.\n\nI have not treated \"the great question of the antiquity of the Avesta from all standpoints,\" but have aimed to examine it from a few standpoints suggested by Darmesteter as facts of historical and external evidence.\n\nI have alluded to this subject at some length, in my remarks on Mr. Erskine's paper on \"The Sacred Books and Religion of the Parsees.\"\n\nProfessor Darmesteter \"dwells upon what he calls two kinds of evidence. Firstly, the historical evidence as collected from the Dinkard and the letter of Tansar, the Dastur of Ardeshir Babegan, to the king of Tabaristan. Secondly, the internal evidence as presented by the Avesta itself.\" I examine these two kinds of evidence as produced by the Professor, and try to show, that they do not lead to the conclusion, arrived at by him, that the addition to the Avesta was continued to be made as late as the third century after Christ.\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B.

R. A.

While referring to the influence of the religion of the Parsees on Akbar, Mr. Karkaria examines the tradition among the Parsees, that Dastur Meherji R\u00e2na of Na\u00f4sari had explained to Akbar the religion of the Parsees, and not only decides against the tradition, but says, that the Dastur was an obscure priest and not able to explain the religion to Akbar. This paper has received a reply from me in two papers, entitled \"The Parsees at the Court of Akbar and Dastur Meherji R\u00e2na\" and \"Notes of Anquetil Du Perron (1755-61) on King Akbar and Dastur Meherji R\u00e2na.\" As I have said, in the first of my above two papers, \"this is not the first time, that doubts have been raised against Dastur Meherji R\u00e2na's mission to the Court of Akbar. Unfortunately, latterly there has been a division of parties among the priesthood of Na\u00f4sari. Some are opposed to the family of Meherji R\u00e2na and its associates. Some of them have, ere this, raised such doubts, several times, in some of the Gujar\u00e2ti papers. But it was for the first time, that the question was transferred by the above-mentioned paper to the platform of this Society.\"\n\nA good deal of want of courtesy is shewn in this paper by its author to Dastur Meherji R\u00e2na. Not only that, but the same kind of discourtesy is extended to the living members of the Meherji R\u00e2na family, and gross injustice done to them. He has perverted the names of the books stated in the papers, that were passed into his hands by some members of the family. I repeat what I have said in one of my above papers of reply.\n\n\"To say the least, this is very unfair, and I beg to say, that Mr. Karkaria, if not for his own sake, for the sake of the Society in whose Journal he has published this libel, owes an explanation to the members of the family of Dastur Meherji Rana, who, he thinks, have made 'a pretended claim' for their ancestor.\" No explanation has come yet, and it is a pity, that the pages of the Journal of the Society have been allowed to remain sullied in this way. The controversy raised by this paper was soon transferred again to the daily papers of Bombay, and party spirit ran high. The hospitality of their editorial columns, extended to their contributor by the two well-known Bombay English dailies, was equally abused, and the Dastur, who was termed \"an obscure priest in a corner of Gujarat\" in the above paper, was abused as a charlatan and an impostor.\n\n1 Journal, B.

It compared Comte's system of naming the celebrities in the different departments of human activity to a custom of the Ancient Persians, as illustrated in the Farvardin Yasht (Yt. XIII). The custom is still prevalent. The formul\u00e6, in which the departed worthies are commemorated, have been changed from time to time. I have described the custom and given the formul\u00e6 at some length in my paper on \"The Funeral Ceremonies of the Parsees, their Origin and Explanation.\" I am told, that the custom is somewhat similar to the one prevailing at the University of Oxford, where during the bidding prayer, they make \"a long statement recalling the gifts of benefactors to the University in times past. It is really a thanksgiving to Almighty God for the gifts of the worthies of old, who gave land and money to endow the Colleges and the University. The list of benefactors is read out in full on the high festivals in the University Church only.\"\n\nIt was the recently published book, \"Religion of the Ancient Egyptians,\" by Alfred Wiedemann, that had suggested to me the subject of my paper. I examine in this paper, the several points of similarity in the belief of the Ancient Egyptians and the Ancient Persians about the future of the soul. These two ancient nations agreed, to a certain extent in their belief about (I) the Immortality of the soul; (II) Judgment after Death; and (III) Resurrection.\n\nI. As to the first\u2014the Immortality of the Soul\u2014\"the Ancient Persians believed in the existence of five spiritual parts in a man.\" They were (1) Angh\u00fb, i.e., life or vitality; (2) Da\u00eana, i.e., conscience or the inherent power which reminds him to do good and shun evil; (3) Baodhangh, i.e., the intellectual faculty; (4) Urv\u00e2na, i.e., the soul, which has the freedom to choose good or evil; and (5) Fravashi, i.e., the guiding spirit. Of these five spiritual parts mentioned in the Avesta, the Angh\u00fb corresponded with the Sekhem; the Da\u00eana, with the \u00c2b; the Urv\u00e2na, with the B\u00e2; and the Fravashi, with the Ka of the Egyptians. As to the fifth spiritual part\u2014the Baodhangh\u2014there is such a slight\n\n---\n\n1 Pp. 30-32.

S., Vol. XIX., p. 366.\nshade of difference between it and the Da\u00eana, that it cannot clearly be identified with any spiritual element of the Egyptians.\n\nII. Coming to the belief about the judgment after death, we find, that among the Egyptians, (a) \"Osiris the many-eyed,\" (b) who is a Divinity of the Sun, (c) and who holds a sceptre in his hand as a symbol of authority, (d) weighs in a scale the actions of a soul, (e) that is led before it by Anubis. Among the Persians, it is (a) the thousand-eyed Mithra, (b) the angel of light and an associate of the sun, (c) who holds a vasra, i.e., a mace or club, in his hand, as a symbol of authority, who (d) weighs in a scale the actions of a soul (e) led before him by Sra\u00f4sha, R\u00e2m and Behar\u00e2m.\n\n(f) As Osiris, among the Egyptians, is helped by some gods, so is Mithra, among the Persians, helped by some Yazatas, or angels. (g) As Anubis is in charge of the scales among the Egyptians, so Rashn\u00ea is in charge of it among the Persians. (h) Horus among the Egyptians and \u00c2st\u00e2d among the Persians superintend the work of weighing the actions. (i) Among the Egyptians, Thoth acts as a scribe. Among the Persians, Mithra himself acts as an account-taker. (j) Among both these nations, the souls go to heaven, uttering some words of felicitation.\n\nIII. Coming to the third point of the similarity of ideas, viz., Resurrection, we find that both these ancient nations thought it necessary to preserve some part of the body for the purpose of the resurrection. The Egyptians preserved the whole body\u2014a fact, which led them to the custom of mummying the bodies in various ways. The Ancient Persians preserved the bones\u2014a fact, which led them to the custom of having Astod\u00e2ns or ossuaries, as referred to above.\u00b9\n\n\"Now arises the question, How shall we account for the above points of marked similarity between the beliefs of these two ancient nations, the Egyptians and the Persians? The answer is, that both these nations had their homes in Central Asia. The ancient Egyptians were Asiatics by origin and not Africans.\"\u00b2\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A.

In this paper, I identify some of the cities named in the treatise, and \"give a few points of geographical and historical importance about them as presented\" by it.\n\nThe treatise seems to have been written in the eighth or ninth century after Christ.\n\nOf the several new facts of historical and geographical importance presented by the Pahlavi treatise and pointed out in this paper, the following are very important:\n\nI.\u2014The treatise leads us to determine, that the library of Shapig\u00e2n, the second of the two State libraries of ancient Persia, was located in a Fire temple at Samarcand.\n\nII.\u2014Yazdagird I, the son of Shapur III, is called dafr, basehgar, al-athim, al-khashan, faru-bandehegar, &c., meaning, cruel or hard, by most of the Oriental writers, the reason being, that, being somewhat under the influence of Hebrew and Christian priests, he was not well disposed towards his own Persian subjects. This treatise presents an additional reason; and it is this, that he was under the influence of a Jewish wife named Shishin-dokht.\n\nIII.\u2014There are several places connected with the name of Zoroaster, either as his native country, or as his country of adoption for the propagation of his religion. This treatise gives an additional name, viz., that of \u00c2mui. It is a town in the province of Raga, and Zoroaster is said to be of that place.

The subject of this paper is a bronze medal belonging to Mr. J. H. Robinson of Bombay. The medal bears no inscription. I had shown it to the late lamented Dr. Gerson da Cunha, who was an authority here in Numismatics, and he was not sure, whether it was genuine. The late lamented M. Drouin of Paris latterly thought, that it was not genuine. The object of my paper was, to determine what the figures on the medal were, and to whom it belonged. I have shown, that the figures lead us to think, that the medal depicted one of the chase-scenes of King Behr\u00e2m Gour. Most probably, it is the scene, wherein he goes to hunt a wild dragon and a wolf, at the desire of the Indian king (Shengel), whose daughter Sepihnoud, he latterly marries. For a fuller description of this scene I would refer my readers to my paper on \"The Bas-relief of Behr\u00e2m Gour at Naksh-i-Rustam and his marriage with an Indian Princess.\"\n\nI have tried to show in this paper, firstly, (i) that the Sind\u00e2n of the Arab geographers and writers\u2014Ibn Haukal, Edrisi, Ma\u00e7oudi, Istakhri and Albiruni\u2014is not the modern Sanj\u00e2n of Konkan, but is the Sind\u00e2n of Cutch; and secondly (ii) that the town of Hanjamana, referred to in some of the Silh\u00e2ra grants, is the Parsee town of Sanj\u00e2n, whose foundation by the Parsees is referred to in the Kisseh-i-Sanj\u00e2n. In connection with the first question, I have shown, that according to the Parsee tradition, as noted in the Kisseh-i-Sanj\u00e2n, it was the Parsees who named the town Sanj\u00e2n.\n\n1 The K. R. Cama Memorial Volume, in honour of Mr. Kharshedji Rustamji Cama, on the occasion of his seventieth birthday, edited by Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, pp. 225-30.\n2 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XIX. pp. 58-75. Vide supra, pp. 271-272.\nThis paper is a reply to Prof. Darmesteter's \"theory, that the Gathas were only a re-edition of ancient texts made during the early years of the Christian era.\" The author mainly appeals to the following points in support of his conclusion, that the Gathas were composed in or about the ninth century B.C., and that their birth place was Media:\n\nI.\u2014The archaic form of the language. The Gathas \"appeal to the people at large, and seem to have been sung before large assemblages, instead of being confined to a few savants.\" So, if written in the first century after Christ, they were written in a language, dead at the time. If so, they cannot appeal to the people at large. This leads us to the conclusion, that they were written long before the first century after Christ,\u2014written at a time, when the language was still living.\n\nII.\u2014\"The historical allusions found in the songs seem to point likewise to an early date; if they were composed so late as the time which Darmesteter suggests, we might have found in them at least some evidence of the history of later times; but of this we have no trace.\"\n\nIII.\u2014\"The organization of the people, such as it is found in the Gathas, points to a time when settled agricultural life was not yet the order of the day, when a regular political government had not yet been in existence, when tribe fought against tribe for years and years without any decisive result, when the followers of the religion of Mazda had often to endure the hardships of failure and defeat.\" All these point to a very early date.\n\nIV.\u2014\"There is no trace here (in the Gathas) of the Acheamenide Empire.\" So, they must have been written long before the Achemenian times.\n\nDarmesteter has laid great stress upon the supposed identification of the Vohu Mano of the Avesta with the Logos of the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Philo-Jud\u00e6us, and has inferred from that supposed identification, that Ardeshir B\u00e2beg\u00e2n's chief minister and priest Tansar, who, according to Ma\u00e7oudi, was a Platonist, and who had a hand in the collection of the Avesta at the direction of his royal master, must have put in, in the Avesta, a good deal of his own, as collected from Greek philosophy. Mr. Wadia opposes this inference by saying, that (a) \"the conception of Vohu Mano is not so well developed in the Gathas as it is in the later Avestaic writings, that in the Gathas it is wavering between an abstract attribute of the Deity and a personified being . . . . . . (b) and that the theory of the Vohu Mano and the rest of the Amshaspands is mentioned in a passage of the 'Isis and Osiris'\" of Plutarch.\n\n1 Journal B. B. R. A. S., XXI, p. 35. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid. 6 Ibid.\nFor further elucidation of the subject of Vohu Mano and Logos, I would refer my readers to the studied writings of Rev. Dr. Mills in the several issues of the Asiatic Quarterly and of other periodicals during the last few years, and to his recent book, entitled, \"Zarathushtra and the Greeks.\"\n\nMr. Wadia refers to the political condition of the country as described in the Gathas, and determines, that the people \"were nomadic in their organization,\"\u00b9 that their \"struggles were for the most part internecine,\"\u00b2 and that there is \"no mention of a formidable authority external to the tribes.\"\u00b3 Such a condition evidently points to pre-Achemenian times for the composition of the Gathas.\n\nWe have the additional authority of the traditional Pahlavi writings to show, that the struggles of Zoroaster, referred to in the Gathas, were more tribal than external, that the worst enemies of Zoroaster and his religion were his own kith and kin, and that the Ushis, Kiks and Karaps, who most opposed him, formed the tribes or families nearly related to him.\u2074\n\nThus determining the political condition of the people, Mr. Wadia takes advantage of the new theory of the original home of the Aryan race\u2014a theory which originated by Latham and seconded by Penka, Taylor, and Rendall, and most ably supported by Schrader, places the home of the Aryans in Europe instead of in Asia,\u2014and following the history of the Assyrians, Medes and Persians as given by Herodotus, places the age of the G\u0101th\u0101s at a time about or before the 7th century before Christ, and its place in Media. Well, we must note here, that the last word on the origin or the cradle of the Aryan race is not said yet. Even the theory of Europe being its home, shifts its ground hither and thither.\n\nAbout the birthplace of Zoroastrianism, Mr. Wadia says, \"it is not even true that tradition assigns Bactria as the birthplace of Zoroastrianism.\"\u2075 I think, in the consideration of this matter, we must not mix up the question of the birthplace of Zoroaster with that of the birthplace of Zoroastrianism. \"The consensus of opinion is,\" I think, \"that Zoroaster belonged both to the East and to the West of Ir\u0101n, to Bactria and to Media; that Bactria, where the then king of Ir\u0101n, King Gusht\u0101sp, ruled, was the place of his ministry, the place where he promulgated his religion under the protection and with the help of the ruler; and that Media was the place of his birth, his childhood, his inspiration.\"\u2076\n\n\u00b9Ibid., p. 39.\n\u00b2Ibid.\n\u00b3Ibid.\n\u2074Cf. my paper entitled \"An Avesta Amulet\" before the Anthropological Society of Bombay (Journal Vol. V, No. 7, pp. 418-425).\n\u2075Journal, B.

Dr. Geiger places the age in pre-Achemenian and pre-Median times and the home in the East of Ir\u00e2n. What Dr. Geiger says at the end of his essay is true, that \"the question as regards the home and age of the Avesta is at present the standing difficulty of Ir\u00e2anian Philology, and will, I surmise, remain so for a long time.\" Prof. Geldner supports Dr. Geiger in his view about the antiquity of the G\u00e2th\u00e2s. Dr. Geiger's paper has received a reply from Prof. Dillon of the University of Charkow, who agrees with Harlez, Spiegel and Justi in placing the home of the Avesta in the West and the age of the Avesta in times later than those ascribed to it by Geiger.\n\nDr. Karl F. Geldner's learned paper on the Avesta Literature, which has lately been translated by Rev. Dr. Mackichan, treats, among many other questions, this question of the Home and Age of the Avesta. It presents a very interesting picture of all the points relating to the Avesta.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A.

Dr. Cheyne calls in his Bampton Lectures of 1889, 'a very noble allegory.' This noble allegory is rendered into verse by Rev. Dr. Casartelli under the title of \"Outre-Tombe: a Zoroastrian Idyll.\" According to this allegory, \"at the dawn of the third night after death, the soul of a deceased person sees before him a picture of his own deeds and actions in this world.

It says, that the deceased person's actions present themselves before his soul after death in the form of a wind and a cow.\n\nThis chapter seems to be a later addition. I show in this paper, that the additional chapters found in the larger manuscripts are all later additions. From several facts adduced in the paper, I come to the conclusion, that the latest additions to the Bundehesh were made about 786 A.D.\u00b2\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A.

I have treated the whole subject under three heads.\n\nI. Firstly, I have tried to prove, that it was the Na\u00f4s\u00e2ri Parsees who influenced Akbar. II. Secondly, I have tried to prove that it was Dastur Meherji Rana, the leader of the Na\u00f4s\u00e2ri Parsees, who influenced Akbar. III. Thirdly, I have examined the objections that have been raised to these facts. In the appendix, I have given the photolitho facsimiles of some of the documents referred to in the body of the paper, with their texts and translations.\n\nAn outline of this paper and of a subsequent supplementary paper on the same subject, based on the Notes of Anquetil Du Perron, has been published in the \"Revue de l' Histoire des Religions.\" The subject of the religion of Akbar has been recently treated in a paper, before the Congress of the History of Religion, held at Baal in August 1904, by Mon. G. B. Maury, whose translation of Comte de Noer's work (L'Empereur Akbar, par le Comte de Noer) I have quoted in my paper.\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., XXI., p. 49.\n\u00b2 Vide also my Gujarati Bundehesh, Introduction, pp. 16-20.\n\u00b3 Vide above p. 275.\nThis paper was at first read before the International Congress of Oriental Scholars, held at Hanoi in December 1902. In this paper, I have collected the references to China in the ancient books of the Parsees. I have divided my subject into seven parts.\n\nI. I have described the reference to China in the Avesta (Farvardin Yasht, Yt. XIII., 144) under the name of S\u0101ini, and have examined three facts which lead us to identify S\u0101ini with China.\n\nII. In this connection, I have examined the statement of Prof. Douglas, as to what country constituted S\u0101ini or China, in the ancient literature of different nations. It appears, that the whole country between the Pamirs and the confines of Bactria on the West and the great ocean on the East, was, at times, known by the name of China.\n\nIII. I have examined the question of the derivation of the name Sin, Sin\u00e6, Chin or China. The question of the derivation is not settled as yet. On one hand, the settlement of that question is very important to Avesta scholars, as it will settle also the date when the Farvardin Yasht, which refers to China, was written. \"On the other hand, a satisfactory settlement of the question of the date of the Farvardin Yasht may lead to a solution of the doubtful question of the derivation of the name of China.\"\n\nIV. I have examined the references to China in the Pahlavi Bundesh and the Sh\u0101yast l\u0101 Sh\u0101yast. The latter book seems to refer to the religion of China as \"a mixed religion, i.e., a religion containing Zoroastrian elements, as well as other foreign elements.\"\n\nV. \"This brings us to the question of the influence of Zoroastrian religion upon China\"; and so, I examine in this part, the references to Zoroaster and to the religion of Persia in the Chinese books.\n\nVI. I examine the references to China, in the Pahlavi Epistles of M\u0101noshcheher, in the Bahman Yasht and in the J\u0101m\u0101sp\u012b. These references tend to show, that the Persians of the times, when these books were written, were in lesser contact with the people of China than before. So, they looked towards that country with an idea of strangeness and isolation.\n\nVII. Lastly, I examine some of the references to China in the Sh\u0101h-n\u0101meh.\n\n1 Vide \"Compte Rendue Analytique des s\u00e9ances, Premier Congr\u00e8s International des \u00c9tudes d' Extr\u00eame Orient.

S., Vol. XXI., p. 530.\n3 Ibid., p. 51.\n4 Ibid.\nThis paper is a supplement to my abovementioned paper, \"The Parsees at the Court of Akbar and Dastur Meherji Rana.\" Miss D. Menant of Paris, who takes a great interest in the History of the Parsees, and whose book \"Les Parsis\" is well known, while looking into the Manuscript Notes of Anquetil Du Perron, who had visited India from 1755 to 1761 A.D., came across some notes by that traveller and scholar, on the subject of Akbar and Meherji R\u00e2na. She drew my attention to them, and at my request, kindly sent me a photograph of these Notes, which I have reproduced as an appendix to this paper. These Notes were an important find, bearing out the following six points, that I had tried to prove in my previous paper:\n\n1. That Ardeshir, who is spoken of by the Dabist\u00e2n, written long after Akbar's time, as having come to Akbar's Court, had come to India, long after the religious discussions were closed, and long after Akbar had adopted the visible forms of Zoroastrian worship and Zoroastrian calendar and festivals, and so, he had no hand in influencing Akbar towards these things.\n\n2. That Ardeshir had specially come for the purpose of the dictionary, known as the Farhang-i-Jehangiri, and not for the purpose of taking part in the religious discussions at the Court, nor for the purpose of explaining to the king, the religion of Zoroaster.\n\n3. That it was the Na\u00f4sari Parsees, who had attended the Court of Akbar to take part in the religious discussions, which took place there in 1576\u201479.\n\n4. That Dastur Meherji R\u00e2na was a leading Parsee of Na\u00f4sari, and that, as such, he headed the party from Na\u00f4sari.\n\n5. That he explained the Zoroastrian religion to king Akbar.\n\n6. That if king Akbar put on sudreh and kusti (i.e., the sacred shirt and thread), as referred to in some of the songs, which spoke of Dastur Meherji R\u00e2na's visit to the Court of Akbar, there is nothing to be wondered at, especially as he had put on the sacred symbols of other religions, such as Hinduism and Christianity.\"\n\nFrom the time of Cicero, down to the time of the latest writers of the Encyclop\u00e6dia, several authors have said that Xenophon had written his Cyrop\u00e6dia, \"not in conformity with the truth of history, but to exhibit a representation of an excellent government,\" and so this\nwork was \"a political romance\" written for a \"distinct moral purpose to which literal truth is sacrificed.\"\u00b9 \"But it has been generally believed that there is an admixture\u00b2 of historical truth and fiction in the Cyrop\u00e6dia.\"\u00b3 The author of the paper under review is of the former view, and thinks \"that the Cyrop\u00e6dia has been cast in a mould similar to that of our modern romance.\"\u2074\n\nOur author has divided his subject into several parts.\n\nI. The object of Xenophon in writing the Cyrop\u00e6dia was to accomplish two tasks\u2014\"the first, of completing the vindication of the teachings and character of his great teacher (Socrates); and the second, of applying the remedies prescribed by the great reformer for reforming the Athenians, and renewing their lost virtue and glory.\"\u2075 To accomplish this task, he takes as the hero of his work, Cyrus, whose exploits as a great conqueror were known to the Greeks, through Herodotus, and through oral tradition, and tries to clothe him with the virtues and qualifications, which, as taught by Socrates, must be possessed by the Athenians, if they thought of rising from their degenerate condition. He tries to point out Cyrus to the Athenians, and to say, \"Observe, how Cyrus and the Persians became so great, what qualities and institutions they possessed. Do you have the same qualities and institutions; and you will, also, be as great as the Persians under Cyrus.\"\u2076\n\nII. Our author then gives nine instances, wherein, he thinks, it is Socrates who thinks, and speaks and acts, through the supposed personality of Cyrus.\n\nIII. Our author then produces five instances as showing that the Cyrop\u00e6dia sought \"to teach the Athenians how to cure their moral and military and educational defects by applying the remedies prescribed by Socrates,\"\u2077 though represented to have been prescribed by Cyrus.\n\nIV. Lastly, our author presents four considerations to show \"that the Cyrop\u00e6dia has been cast in a mould similar to that of our modern romance.\"\u2078\n\nHowever imaginary the work of Xenophon may be, it seems, that there was a substratum of truth under the picture, which presented the Ir\u0101nian picture of what a good, virtuous and useful citizen must be. There is very little in Xenophon's picture of Cyrus, to show, that it was non-Ir\u0101nian or against the teachings of the religion or of the moral code of the Ir\u0101nians. It is true, that Cyrus is made to refer to Greek gods, but that must not lead one to think, that the picture had no Ir\u0101nian ground whatever. Herodotus, whose account of the\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B.

I think, that the Cyclop\u00e6dia is not a fiction pure and simple, but a mixture of facts and fiction\u2014facts, based on some points of Iranian social and moral life, and fiction, in the attempt to apply it to the exigencies of Greek life.\n\nXenophon's Cyclop\u00e6dia reminds me of a modern attempt of this kind, though not of the same type. It is the work of a German Professor entitled \"So sprache Zarathushtra,\" which is translated into English under the name of \"Thus spake Zarathushtra.\" Though one cannot point to chapter and verse in the writings of Zoroaster for every idea and word that the writer has put into the mouth of Zoroaster, and though some ideas and words may not look to be Zoroastrian pure and simple, still the substratum is, to a great extent, Zoroastrian.\n\nII.\n\nI will now speak of those papers in our Journal which are not strictly on Parsee subjects, but which indirectly refer to points interesting from a Parsee point of view, and which incidentally throw some light on Parsee subjects.\n\nTransactions, L. S. B., I., pp. 281-312. 30th November 1813.\n\nAn account of Kathiaw\u00e2r, from an antiquarian point of view, may interest a Parsee, because this province seems to have come into some contact with the Ancient Persians, and because the Parsees, on their emigration from Persia, had landed, at first, on its shores before coming to Gujar\u00e2t. This paper does not contain anything interesting from the latter point of view. But there is one statement which requires a little attention. The author says: \"The Rajas of Noanuggur have the title of Jam, which they derive from their Sindian ancestors.\" He then adds in a foot-note, that \"there are several derivations of this title given by historians; Mahomedans who possess it, derive it from Jumshede, and Hindoos from the word jum, 'fixed' or 'firm.'\"\n\nNow, we learn from Ebn Haukal, who lived in the 10th century, that as late as his time, a part of Sind was owned by Parsees. So, it is possible, that the Mahomedan rulers of this district, who may have descended from the rulers of Sind, may have received this title of Jam from there. One need not derive it, as the author says, from \"Jumshede\" or \"Jamshed\" because Jam itself is the original\n\n---\n\n1 Transactions, L. S.

The word originally is Yima in the Avesta, and is the same as Yama of the Vedas. Mahomedan rulers of India have often been taking pride in the name of Jamshed, and comparing their rule, pomp and dignity with those of this Pishdadian monarch of Persia. Last Christmas, I remember having read an inscription on a slab in the fortress of Golconda, near Hyderabad, wherein a potentate is compared with Jamshed.\n\n*Transactions, L. S. B., I., pp. 150-56. 30th March 1812.*\n\nThere is one event in the history of the fort of Chapaneer which is interesting and important to a Parsee, because it is, as it were, a landmark in the history of the Parsees in India. This event is the conquest of Chapaneer by the Mahomedans for the first time. It is thus referred to by Capt. Miles in his paper.\n\n\"The history of Chapaneer before the introduction of the Mahomedan religion into Hindustan is, like almost all Hindu history and tradition, very fabulous, and, although curious and perhaps, entertaining, is not deserving serious mention. All that can be clearly ascertained is that it exceeded greatly its present size, and was the seat of a powerful Rajpootre tribe, the last raja of which was Putty Rawall. Some descendants from his family are said still to be in existence in Guzerat. This man, however extensive his possessions before might have been, was reduced to his capital by Mahmoud, the seventh king of Western Guzerat, who besieged him in it (say both Hindus and Moslems) twelve years; partially I judge . . . . The tradition is, that Mahmoud's armies took this and Joonaghudd, another hill-fort in Kattywar, on the same day; and that, therefore, he is called by the Guzerattees Mahmoud Be-Ghudde or Be-Ghurree, i.e., of the two forts\"\n\nNow, this event of the conquest of Chapaneer by Sultan Mahmud and the introduction of Mahomedanism into it, is thus alluded to in the *Kisseh-i-Sanjan*, a Persian treatise in verse, giving a short history of the Parsees in India.\n\n\u0686\u0648\u062e\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u067e\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u0635\u062f \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633 \u062f\u0631 \u0686\u0646\u067e\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0631 \u0622\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0647\u06cc \u0634\u0627\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u062f \u0622\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0627 \u0628\u062e\u062a \u062f\u0631\u0622 \u0646\u0634\u0631\u0627 \u0648 \u0646\u0634\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0631 \u062a\u062e\u062a \u0631\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0638\u0644\u0631 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0647\u0634 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646\u062f\u06cc\n\nTranslation\u2014\"Islam came to Champ\u00e2nir at the end of 500 years (since its introduction) in India.

Dr. Wilson\u00b2 says, it was Mahmud Bigar\u0101 who reigned in Guzerat from 1459 to 1513. But the writer of the Bombay Gazetteer says, it was Mohammed Shah or Ala-ud-din Khilji, the King of Delhi, who reigned from 1295 to 1315. Now the reference to the conquest of Champ\u0101nir by Sultan Mahmud and to the introduction of Mahomedanism into it, in the Kisseh-i-Sanjan, and the fact stated in the history of Champ\u0101nir, that it was Sultan Mahmud Begar\u0101 who conquered it and introduced Mahomedanism into it, determine, that the Sultan Mahmud referred to in the Persian Kiss\u00e9h-i-Sanjan is Sultan Mahmud Begar\u0101 and not Mahmud Shah or Ala-ud-din Khilji.\n\nNow this event, which is connected with a defeat of the Parsees at Sanjan, and its date are very important in the history of the Indian Parsees, as they determine the dates of many previous and subsequent events in their history.\u00b3\n\nTransactions, L. S. B., II., pp. 256-286. 29th September 1818.\n\nThis paper is interesting, not only from a Parsee point of view, but from the point of view of every religion. The remarks of the author in the beginning, about the authorship of the Dabist\u0101n, which refers to the religion of Akbar, are important, as they show, that Sir William Jones was wrong in attributing the authorship to Mohsan F\u0101ni. In his sixth anniversary discourse before the Bengal Asiatic Society, Sir W. Jones said: \"The rare and interesting tract on twelve different religions, entitled the Dabist\u0101n, and composed by a Mohammedan traveller, a native of Cashm\u012br, named Mohsan, but distinguished by the assumed surname of F\u0101ni or Perishable, begins with a wonderfully curious chapter on the religion of Hushang.\"\u2074\n\nCapt. Kennedy was the first to show in his preliminary remarks, in this paper, that Sir W. Jones was wrong in attributing the authorship to Mohsan F\u0101ni. He was followed by William Erskine who showed it on the authority of \"the Gul-i-Rana or Charming Rose of Lachmi Narrayen who\n\n\u00b9 Vide my article on \"A Few Events in the Early History of the Parsis and their Dates\" in the Zarthoshti, Vol. I, No. 4.

He says, that he saw Sir W. Jones' mistake independently, and before he \"had an opportunity of seeing Capt. Vans Kennedy's learned and conclusive observations on the same subject.\" The fact is, that, as Troyer says, the name Mohsan Fani is found in more than one copy of the Dabistan, after the usual address to God in the beginning, in a passage beginning with the words \"Mohsan Fani says.\" Dastur Mulla Feroze thought, that, that is the name of a writer, with a quotation from whom the author began his work. So, this writer, quoted as an authority, by the author, has been mistaken for the author himself. Troyer, about 25 years after the discussion, thought, that the question was still undecided, but we think, that Mulla Feroze's explanation, approved of by Erskine, seems to be correct.\n\nThe second point in this paper, which would draw our attention from a Parsee point of view, is the Zoroastrian element in the new religion of Akbar. The question has been dealt with at some length by me before this Society in my paper, \"The Parsees at the Court of Akbar and Dastur Meherji Rana.\" The question of the Religion of Akbar has been treated by Blochmann, Comte de Noer, Wilson, Rehatsek, and Max M\u00fcller.\n\nTransactions, L. S. B., II., pp. 297-311. 30th March 1819.\n\nThis paper like that of Captain Kennedy on \"The Religion of Akbar\" is interesting for all, from the point of view of all religions. The author says: \"It is generally known that the Mussulmans expect the appearance of the Imam Mehdi on earth before the last judgment. The question whether he has or has not yet appeared, forms the great distinction between these and other Muhammadans.\"\n\nNow, the belief of a coming Messiah or Saviour, or, as the Zoroastrians say, a Soshy\u00f4s, has been, at one time or another, common in almost all religions. Some say, that the predicted man has already come, and others say, that he is still to come. It is said in the Zoroastrian books, that one Soshy\u00f4s will appear in the world before the final day of resurrection. The three Magi, who are said to have gone from Persia to pay homage to the new-born child Christ, seem to have gone to him, believing that he was the predicted Soshy\u00f4s. In coming to that conclusion, they seem to have forgotten that the place spoken.\n\n1 Transactions, L. S.

Dr. Casartelli's \"The Three Magi.\"\nof in the Avesta as the place of his appearance was not the place where Christ was born.\\(^1\\)\n\nNow, the belief about a coming Saviour, which is prevalent among the Jews, the Christians, and the Mahomedans, has taken, according to Darmesteter, its definite form, under the influence of Persian mythology. For an excellent treatment of the subject, I would refer my readers to this talented French scholar's lecture on the subject, entitled \"Le Mahdi, depuis les origines de l'Islam jusqu'a nos jours\" (1885). The author of this interesting brochure says, that Mahomedanism has taken its elements from the three great religions that were prevalent in Arabia, besides its old paganism, at the time of its birth, viz., Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.\\(^2\\) Prof. Darmesteter gives a short description of the different Mahdis, who had at one time or another appeared in Persia, Barbary, Turkey, Egypt and India. The word Mahdi, according to Prof. Darmesteter, means \"one who is guided.\"\n\nIt was during the Caliphate of Abd-ul Malik, the 9th Caliph (the 5th Caliph of the Ommayids), that Mokhtar put forth Mahommed, the son of Ali (the 4th Caliph), as Al-Mahdi. He was, as it were, the first Mahdi. On the death of this Mahommed, it was thought that he was not dead, but was hid in the valley of Mount Radeva, somewhere near Medin\u00e2.\\(^3\\) The real Mahdi, according to the Shi'ites, was the twelfth Im\u00e2m, Mohammad Ab'l Kassim, who disappeared mysteriously in 879 A.D.\n\nOf the different Mahdis, there was one, Obaid-allah, who was the first Caliph of the Tobinita dynasty in North Africa (909\u2014934 A.D.). Another was Mohammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tumrut, the founder of the Almohades (Almvahedun, i.e., Unitarian) dynasty that flourished in Africa. His followers saluted him as the Al-Mehedi on the 28th November 1121.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) What happened then, in the case of the three Magi, seems to happen even now, and that in Bombay. About 5 years ago, a number of Zoroastrians of Persia (Iranis) in Bombay complained, that some of their compatriots in Bombay follow the religion of B\u00e1b and are adopting Babism. Those who hold the belief came and saw me and explained their belief. I studied the life and the teachings of B\u00e1b. I learnt from these, and from the conversation I had with the so-called Zoroastrian Babis, that B\u00e1b who appeared in Persia in the middle of the last century (born in 1824 A.D.) was taken by some of these simple folks to be the Soshy\u00f4s predicted in the Avesta, and by others to be the Behram Verj\u00e2vand alluded to in some of the later Pahlavi and Persian books (Bahman Yasht III, 14, 39, 49; S.B.E., Vol. V., West., pp. 221, 229, 232.

Gray (1903).\n\n\\(^3\\) \"Le Mahdi\" par Darmesteter, p. 35.\n\n---\n\n*For my paper on B\u00e1b, vide the *sit\u00e2 q\u00e2s* of Bombay of April and May 1903.*\nThree such Mahdis have appeared in our times. One was Sheik Mohammed (Mahammed Ahmed) of Dongola in the Egyptian Soudan. The second was the Sheik el Senusi in Tripoli. A third appeared in the country of Aidin. It is the first of these, who has given a good deal of trouble to the Egyptian Government, and whose name will always be remembered with that of Lord Kitchener.\n\nThe Mahdi referred to by Mr. Miles in this paper was an Indian Mahdi, Mahummad by name, who was born at Joonpore, near Benares, in 1442 A.D. (847 Hijri). He found an adherent in Sultan Mahmud I. of Gujar\u00e2t. He died in Fruruh, a city of Khorasan, in 910 Hijri. According to Blochmann,\u00b9 he died in 911 Hijri (1505 A.D.) at Far\u00e2h in Balochistan. There was another Indian Mahdi, Shaikh 'Al\u00e2\u00ee by name, who appeared near \u00c2gr\u00e2 in about 1549 A.D. (956 Hijri).\u00b2\n\nIt were these Indian Mahdis, especially Shaikh Al\u00e2\u00ee, who had given rise to the Mahdi sect and belief, that exerted, according to Blochmann, a great influence upon the mind of Abu Fazl and his brother Faizi, and through them, upon the mind of their royal master, Akbar. Thus the Mahdi belief had played some part in moulding the thoughts of Akbar in connection with his new Il\u00e2hi Din.\u00b3\n\nOne of the Indian Mahdis was Ubdul Rehman, who appeared in the Bombay Presidency in 1810. He appeared in the town of Boodh\u00e2n, near Surat. A Parsee Government officer, Mr. Dhunjee Shah Behramund Khan, a vakil of the Rajah of Mandvie, was killed on 19th January 1810, while arresting him.\u2074\n\nTransactions, III., pp. 281\u2014341. 28th March 1820.\n\nThere is one point in this paper, which would arrest our attention from a Parsee point of view. While speaking of the Ling and Yoni the author says:\n\n\"The worship of the Phallus in Egypt, and of Mylitta in Babylon, as mentioned by Herodotus, seems to correspond with the Ling and Yoni Pooja, and proves that at an early period the mystic operations of Nature excited the attention and reverence of mankind.\"\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Ain-i-Akbari.

Mylitta is the name by which the Assyrians know this goddess whom the Arabians call Alitta and the Persians Mitra.\u201d As Rawlinson points out, \u201cthis identification of Herodotus is altogether a mistake. The Persians, like their Vedic brethren, worshipped the sun under the name of Mithra. This was a portion of the religion which they brought from the Indus, and was not adopted from any foreign nation.\u201d The Babylonian god Mylitta is a female deity, while Mithra is a male deity. So the identification on its very face is incorrect. I attribute this mistake on the part of Herodotus to the similarity of the functions of the Arabic goddess Alitta referred to in his third book (Ch. VIII) and of the Persian Mithra. He was told, that the Arabs took the name of Alitta, when they entered into sacred pledges; he was also told, that the Persian angel, Mithra, presided on pledges and promises. So he identified the Arabic Alitta with the Persian Mithra. Now, the Arabic Alitta was identified with Babylonian Mylitta. So, he identified Mylitta with Mithra. The angel, that would correspond to Alitta, who is the same as Greek Urania, is Persian An\u00e2hita, who is a female deity. So, the Ir\u00e2nian deity, which would remind us somewhat of the Ling and the Yoni, would be An\u00e2hita, who is the personification of the fructifying and all-nourishing powers of Nature.\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. I., pp. 127\u201428.\n\nThis is a Circular of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries, asking for co-operation from learned societies of different countries. One statement in the Circular arrests our attention from a Zoroastrian point of view. It says: \u201cThe Old Northern tongue is preserved in its purity in the ancient poetry of the Eddas, in which is also preserved the Old Northern mythology, which has long been supposed and partly ascertained to have much in common with that of India and Persia, and wherein Buddhism also seems to have left its traces.\u201d\n\nAmong the Persian elements which seem to have their traces in the Snorra or the Younger Edda, the most important is the reference to Zoroaster. Professor Jackson, in his \u201cZoroaster, the Prophet of Ancient Ir\u00e2n,\u201d quotes the reference at full length, and gives his own translation of it. According to that reference, the Edda, while \u201cgiving a brief\n\n1 Herodotus, Bk. I., iii.\n2 Rawlinson\u2019s Herodotus, Vol. I.

Foremost among the builders of the Tower was Zoroaster\" who is said to have become King of the Assyrians. \"In consequence of the confusion of tongues, he was known by many names, but chief among those was Baal or Bel.\" The Edda says: \"He (Zoroaster) laughed before he cried when he came into the world.\" This extraordinary thing is also referred to by Pliny, who says: \"We find it stated that Zoroaster was the only human being who ever laughed on the same day on which he was born. We hear, too, that his brain pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom.\"\n\nProfessor Jackson refers to this subject in his account of the early life of Zoroaster in his above book. Solinus also refers to this subject. He says: \"And so we know that one man laughed at the very hour in which he was born, namely, Zoroaster, afterwards most highly skilled in the best arts.\"\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., II., p. 214\u2014217 (January 1845).\n\nThere is one statement in this extract which draws our attention from a Parsee point of view. It says: \"In another place they discovered great rows of earthen vases of a remarkable size, placed on a brick floor and filled with human bones, and similar to those which have been found at Babylon, Ahwaz, and other places in South Persia.\" These vases are the Ast\u00f4d\u00e2ns or Ossuaries, the like of which were sent to our Society in 1813, and to the Anthropological Society in 1888, and to which I have referred in my remarks on Mr. Erskine's paper, entitled \"Observations on two sepulchral urns found at Bushire in Persia.\"\n\nOf M. Botta's discovery in the ruins of Nineveh, it was then said that \"it is one of the most valuable which has been made, for many years, in the field of archaeology,\u2014supplying an important link, hitherto wanting, and believed to be irrecoverable, in the history of the Arts amongst the earliest civilizations of the world. . . .

Unlike the cities of Ancient Egypt, which have transmitted to our times, almost in their integrity, the Arts of their builders, the great cities of Central Asia\u2014Susa, Ecbatana, Babylon, Nineveh\u2014have perished from the face of the earth, leaving, in the language of ancient prophecy, scarcely one stone upon another. Dreary mounds of rubbish, traversed by deep and narrow ravines that indicate the lines of the streets, alone mark the sites of these mighty cities. Nineveh, the city of fifteen hundred towers, whose walls were a hundred feet in height, and had space on their summits for three chariots abreast, seemed more utterly ruined than even Babylon; yet from beneath its dust has the long buried Art of the Assyrians been recovered, and an impulse been communicated which may end in bringing, through future excavations, our knowledge of the former to something of a level with our understanding of Egyptian Art.\"\n\nThe expectations expressed in the early notices of M. Botta's discovery have been greatly fulfilled. M. Botta has, with his co-adjutor, Flandin, published, in 1849, the results of his discoveries under five large handsomely executed volumes, entitled \"Monument de Ninive.\" The first two volumes contain \"Architecture and Sculpture;\" the second two, the \"Inscriptions;\" and the fifth, the text, in which M. Botta gives a description of his way of working and of the different ruins and of the character of the inscriptions.\n\nThe discoveries of M. Botta were soon followed by those of Sir H. Layard, who, as M. Botta says, was attracted to the place by his discoveries, and whom he calls a \"fortunate rival.\" Layard has described his discoveries in his \"Nineveh and its Remains.\"\n\nWe find another extract of a notice of Botta's discoveries in the same volume of our Journal (II, pp. 325\u2014330). Therein, the writer expresses the difficulty \"to know, to which of the three great dynasties, which successively ruled the empire of the Assyrians, they (the ruins) ought to be ascribed, vis., the first race of kings, of which Sardanapalus was the last, B.C. 820; the second race, which became extinct at the destruction of Nineveh by Cyaxares (608); or the Medo-Persian conquerors, who governed the east till the time of their defeat by Alexander.\" The writer thinks that \"the second Assyrian era was the date of the construction of the edifice.\" Later researches have shown that the ruins\n\n1 Journal, B.

It is the Shatr\u014dh\u0101-i-Air\u0101n. It says: \"Ninav of Yur\u0101s founded the city of Ninav.\" The Yur\u0101s, referred to here, is Yunas or Jonas of the Scriptures. We read in the Scriptures: \"Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah, the son of Amitai, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh\" (Jonah I., 1 and 2). This is referred to in the Pahlavi book. Ma\u00e7oudi also refers to this. He says: \"C'est \u00e0 cette cit\u00e9 que Dieu envoya autrefois Jonas, fils de Mati.\"\n\nThe Mati of Ma\u00e7oudi is the Amattai of the Scriptures.\n\nJournal, B.

Vide my \"Asiatic Papers,\" p. 193.\nThough these papers have nothing very special from a Parsee point of view, yet, they are interesting in this, that they treat, directly and indirectly, of the question of the immigration into India of the Scythians who had come into contact with the early Iranians. The Parthians were, by some, considered to be Scythians. Now the question, as to who these Scythians were, has not very definitely been settled. As George Rawlinson\\(^1\\) said, \u201ca large number, of the best scholars of Germany (and) among them the great historian Niebuhr,\u201d and English historians like Grote and Thirlwall, have maintained, that the Scythians were a Tartar or Mongolian race. Rawlinson, on the authority of the test of language, decides against the Mongol theory, and pronounces in favour of the Indo-European origin, but does not decide \u201cto which of the great divisions of the Indo-Germanic race\u201d they belonged. Some say, that they were \u201cAryans and nearly akin to the settled Ir\u00e2niains.\u201d\\(^2\\)\n\nNow some antiquarians like Capt. Congreve and Capt. Meadows Taylor thought, that these Todas or Todavers \u201care exclusively the remains of Celto-Scythians immigrated into India and settled on \u2018the Hills\u2019 at very early times,\u201d\\(^3\\) whose faith was that of the Ancient Druids who worshipped sun and fire.\\(^4\\) They came to this conclusion from the fact, that cromlechs or stone Moles and kistavens or closed cromlechs are found among the villages of these Todas, as among the ruins of Ancient Druid villages in Great Britain and elsewhere. On the other hand, Rev. Dr. Schmid and Rev. Dr. Taylor say, that these Todas are, like the Tamilians, Maleialies, Canarese and Telingas, the descendants of a \u201cCaucasian or Hinalaya race,\u201d which \u201cmust have immigrated into the plains of India very early,\u201d\\(^5\\) and which was afterwards \u201cpushed forward to the furthest South by other mountain tribes speaking Sanscrit.\u201d\\(^6\\) Those who hold this opinion, affirm, that the cromlechs and such other remains found at Ootacamund are not special to the Toda villages, but are found in the plains in the various parts of the country. Their chief ground for this opinion is philological, and they show, that the language of the Todas is a dialect of the stock to which the Tamil and the Canarese belong. As I have said in my paper, entitled \u201cA few notes on the Todas of the Nilgiris,\u201d\\(^7\\) read before the Anthropological Society of Bombay on 24th February 1904, some of their customs are such as would tempt a Parsee to call\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rawlinson\u2019s Herodotus, Vol. III.

As Moslems and Orientals, they piously and graphically describe their Prophet as using Pusht\u00fb with the same facility as he could talk Arabic or Hebrew, Zend or Syriac.\"\\(^4\\) There have been different opinions about the stock of languages to which the Pushtu language belonged. Capt. Raverty said in 1860, that \"some Orientalists of the present day have endeavoured to make out that the Pushto language belongs to the Indian or Ind\u00fb-Teutonic family of tongues, because it contains some Sanskrit words, and because the Urdu or Hindustani dialect bears, as it is affirmed, some resemblance in point of idiom.\"\\(^5\\) But, as his own opinion, he said: \"I am inclined to conclude\u2014from the great affinity I have shown to exist between the Pushto and the Semitic and Ir\u00e2anian dialects; from the numerous traditions on the subject; from the Levitical customs still prevalent amongst the Afgh\u00e2ns, after the lapse of twenty-five centuries from the Jewish captivity; from their great and decided difference in feature from any other people; from their stubbornness and treachery, even towards each other; from their acuteness in matters of trade and their love of gain; and from the numerous proofs we possess of their having gradually advanced from the West of Asia\u2014that the Afgh\u00e2ns are a remnant of the lost tribes of Israel.\"\\(^6\\)\n\nThis view has led to the notion, that Pushtu is a Semitic language.

Jones says: \"The Pushtu language, of which I have seen a dictionary, has a manifest resemblance to the Chaldaick.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Dorn, whose Chrestomathy is the subject of this paper, it was reserved to his time (1847) \"to establish, on incontrovertible evidence, the fact that the Pusthu belongs to the great family of Indo-Persian languages, without bearing the least resemblance to any of the Semitic dialects.\"\n\nDr. Haug considered it an Ir\u00e2anian dialect, and placed it in its affiliated group. The following table of the division of Ir\u00e2anian languages presents the position of the Pushtu in the Arian stock:\n\n| Indo-European | Arian |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Sanskrit      | Greek Latin Teutonic Slavonian Letto-Lithuanian Celtic |\n| Iranian       | Iranian properly so called |\n|               | Affiliated |\n|               | Armenian Afghan Ossetic spoken |\n|               | Pushtu in the Caucasus |\n| The East Ir\u00e2anian or Bactrian Branch | The West Ir\u00e2anian or Median or Persian Branch |\n| The G\u00e2tha dialect | The Ancient Bactrian Cuneiform Pahlavi. |\n|               | The Classical Avesta of later times. |\n\nThe late Prof. James Darmesteter, who had come to India in 1886-87 on a special errand to study Pushtu, and had stayed for several months at Pesh\u00e2war and Abbot\u00e2b\u00e2d, has come to the conclusion, that the Pushtu belonged to the Ir\u00e2anian stock, and that it was, as it were, an offspring of the Ancient Zend. In his triannual report of the work done by the Asiatic Society of Paris for the years 1888\u20141890, he says: \"L'histoire de l'Afghanistan int\u00e9resse \u00e0 la fois l'Inde et la Perse, car il a tour \u00e0 tour oscill\u00e9 dans l'orbite de l'une et de l'autre.

There is no wonder, if Dr. Darmesteter has come to the above conclusion, because the modern Afgh\u00e2nistan, where the Pushtu language is spoken, is the country often referred to in the Avesta, as the seat of the Ancient Ir\u00e2nians. The modern names of some of the places in Afghanistan are still the same.\n\nNow, with respect to the belief referred to above, by Capt. Raverty, \u201cthat the Afghans are a remnant of the lost tribes of Israel\u201d and that they \u201cgradually advanced from the West of Asia,\u201d I would draw the attention of my readers to a recent book, \u201cThe Greater Exodus and the Cradle of the Semitic Race,\u201d by Mr. Fitzgerald Lee. In it, the author tries to show, that the cradle of the Semitic race is not in Western Asia as it is generally believed, but in America; that it was from America that the Ancient Israelites migrated to Asia; and that it was in this migration from America to Western Asia via the Behring Straits, that the Afghans were left in their modern country as an offshoot of the Israelites.\n\nOn leaving Peshawar for Cabul, we pass by Jamrud, Khyber Pass and Ali Musjid. About these last two places Lieut. Burton says: \u201cApropos of such Arabic names as the Khaibar Pass and Ali Musjid, they remark that the latter was originally a mosque founded by the Great Im\u00e2m, after his defeating in a wrestling bout, the daughter of K\u00e2fir, who had sworn to remain a maid until such time as she might meet with a man who could prove himself to be such.\u201d\n\n1 Ibid. pp. 83-84.

Dr. Buist called it a Bactrian coin. Dr. Stevenson considered it to be a Parthian one, and thought that it belonged to Phraates (Phraortes) IV., \"the fifteenth of the Arsacidae,\" who was a contemporary of Augustus.\n\nDr. Wilson agrees with Dr. Stevenson and takes the coin to be Parthian. He says: \"The finding of the (Parthian) coin in the Bombay Bazar is a curious circumstance; but it was there probably as a wanderer.\" Of the image of the king's face Dr. Stevenson says that \"he wears a wig and not his own hair, and from the form of the beard, I should also think it false.\" Dr. Wilson says on this point: \"On both sides of the question of the artificialness or naturalness of the hair of the head or beard in this instance, something could be said, though it is a fact that the Parthian rulers, like the grandees of Assyria, did sometimes wear artificial beards.\" That the Parthian kings should wear artificial hair, looks strange from a Zoroastrian point of view. The Parthian kings, though a foreign dynasty compared to the preceding Persian dynasties of Persia proper, were Zoroastrian. We know, that there seems to be a doubt among some, as to their being true Zoroastrians. But from the references to them in the classical authors we find that some of them were orthodox Zoroastrians. For example, according to Tacitus, one of them, Tiridates, king of Armenia, hesitated to go to Rome, when called there by Emperor Nero to be crowned the king of Armenia, because he would have had to go by sea, which he thought was against Zoroastrian precepts. The Zoroastrian books enjoin, as referred to also by Herodotus and others, that rivers and other fresh-water reservoirs should not be polluted. Now, this injunction was given from a sanitary point of view, because rivers supplied drinking waters to many. Instead of looking to the spirit of the injunction, Tiridates and others took it in its letter, and said, that going over long distances by sea, when they had necessarily to pollute water, was prohibited. So, he refused to go to Rome. The same is said of his brother Vologeses I, the Vulkhash of the Pahlavi books.\n\nNow, then, if the Parthian kings were Zoroastrians, and some of them orthodox Zoroastrians, it appears strange that they put on artificial or false beards, because the hair, like the nails, once\n\n---\n\n1 In the Proceedings of the Society of 11th May 1848.

Dr. Wilson says: \"It is worthy of notice that the imitations of Grecian art were more successful among the Bactrians and Indo-Grecians, and even Indo-Scythians and Ancient Hindus, than among the later Parthians.\" So, possibly through faulty art, what appears like false hair may be the representation of a particular mode of trimming the hair.\n\nAs to the identification of the coin, Dr. Wilson does not agree with Dr. Stevenson in thinking, that it is the coin of Praortes IV. He thinks, it resembles most the coins of Arsaces I. and Arsaces II., and adds that \"the identification of the coins of particular kings of the Parthian dynasty, is not an easy matter, as we find on them merely titles and not names, and our historical fragments do not always enable us to identify these titles.\"\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. III., No. XIII., pp. 26\u201432.\n\nThis article may be interesting to students of Geology from a scientific point of view. But it may also interest students from a literary point of view, inasmuch as the author has been, as he himself says, \"particular in the examination of these gravel-beds,\" which he thought were \"intimately connected with the most interesting geological phenomena on historical record\u2014namely the Deluge of Scripture.\" The author thinks that the nearly North and South longitudinal axis of the gravel beds \"and the nature of the pebbles show that the course of the flood which deposited them rolled from the northward, from the direction of Mount Ararat, towards the present head of the Persian Gulf, washing fragments from the rocks of the Taurus and K\u00fbrdist\u00e2n, and grinding their softer materials into the vast, flat, mud deposits which now cover the sea\u2014like plains of Assyria, Babylonia and Chald\u00e6a.\"\n\nNow, these remarks about the Deluge suggest the question, whether the Deluge is, in any way, alluded to in the Avesta books. Some see in the second chapter of the Vendidad, where king Jamshed is represented as building a vara, i.e., an enclosure or a colony as a protection against the coming winter, an allusion to the Deluge. I do not think it is so. I have, in my essay on King Jamshed, written in 1882 and published in 1884, shown that this chapter does not at all refer to the Deluge. Mr. B. G. Tilak in his recent book refers to this chapter of the Vendidad, and says, that in it, there is an allusion to the extraordinary cold of the polar regions, where the Ancient Aryans once lived.\n\n1 Ibid, p. 129. 2 Ibid. 3 Journal, B.

(Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. IV., pp. 340\u2014379.)\n\nOur present Viceroy, Lord Curzon, takes a kind interest in the preservation of the ancient monuments of our country. He has appointed various commissions for different subjects, but has appointed none for this, and has done what ought to be done in this direction without appointing a Commission. But it appears from this paper of Dr. Wilson, that the attention of the Court of Directors was drawn to the question of the preservation of caves, temples, monuments, and other religious memorials about 55 years ago. That honourable body thereupon determined to appoint a Commission of Orientalists to inquire into that matter. \"Preparatory to the commencement of the labours of that Commission, and the issuing of instructions for its researches, another of a local character,\" had \"been formed by the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society to make such preliminary inquiries about the situation and extent and general character of the antiquities which are to be the subject of investigation as may facilitate its judicious commencement and prosecution.\" Dr. Wilson had prepared for this Bombay Commission the Notes which formed the subject of this paper.\n\nNow, this paper has nothing special from a Zoroastrian point of view. But there are three sets of caves alluded to in it, which have something to attract the attention of a Parsee. The first are the Kanheri Caves, near Borivli, in the Thana District. Some Parsee visitors had gone there in the years 999 and 1021 A.D. They have inscribed their names and the years of their visits in Pahlavi.\n\nThe Pahlavi Inscriptions are given by Mr. K. R. Cama in his \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0905\u092d\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0928 (Zoroastrian Studies). He has deciphered the first inscription and given its translation. The late Dastur Dr. J\u00e2m\u00e2spji Minocherji has also deciphered it. Inscriptions Nos. 4 and 5 have been also deciphered by the late Mr. Muncherji Sh\u00e2purji V\u00e2cha.\n\nAnquetil Du Perron had visited these Caves in 1760 A.D. He refers to them in his Zend Avesta (Tome I, Partie I., pp. 394\u2014413), but he does not seem to have noted the Pahlavi Inscriptions.\n\nThe second set of caves that are interesting from a Parsee point of view, are the \u00c2janta Caves. They contain a drawing of a Persian em-\n\n1 p. 36, January No. of 1850. 9 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., III., No. XIII., p. 36.\n2 The first three in No. II., p. 98 a.

In my paper before our Society, entitled \"The Bas-Relief of Behr\u00e2m Gour (Behram V.) at Naksh-i-Rustam and his Marriage with an Indian Princess,\" I have referred to these caves, and said, that I think the picture refers to the embassy of Behr\u00e2m Gour, of which he himself was an ambassador in disguise.\n\nThe third set of caves is that of B\u00e2mi\u00e2n in Afgh\u00e2nist\u00e2n, a country over which the Ancient Persians had a sway for a long time. Some hold, that it is an open question whether Buddhism, which spread in all directions, had any influence on the followers of Zoroaster. The late Dr. Darmesteter was one of those who believed that it had some influence. The following remarks of Dr. Wilson on the influence of this religion on Christianity attracts our attention. He says: \"It is a remarkable fact that it was by the extension of Buddhism to Bactria and its neighbourhood that the Alexandrian divines, Clemens and Cyril, became acquainted with its existence. Through this line in particular, Buddhism seems to have come in contact with Christianity and encouraged its corruption by the introduction of the monastic institution.\"\n\nNow the question is, if it was through Bactria, the country ruled by Ancient Ir\u00e2n, that Buddhism had some influence on Christianity in introducing the monastic institution in it, why was it that it had no influence in this matter on Ir\u00e2n itself? The monastic institution and its accompaniments, ascetic life and fasting, have no room in Zoroastrian beliefs and doctrines. Ir\u00e2n had never any Zoroastrian monasteries, though it had Christian ones. It were, according to Firdousi, the monks of one of the Christian monasteries, who found the floating body of Yazdazard, the last King of Ir\u00e2n, in a river and helped to remove it from there. The Des\u00e2tir, of which we have spoken above, and which is considered to be a semi-Zoroastrian book by some, refers to fasting as a good institution, but therein, its views are opposed to true Zoroastrianism, and its commendation in favour of fasting shows, that, as Erskine said, its doctrine was a mixture of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Sufism and such other beliefs.\n\nJames Bird in his paper on \"The Bactrian and Mithraic coins\" refers to these Bamian caves.\" He thinks, that \"The fresco-painting in a niche of the second idol of the caves of Bamian\" belong to the times of \"Shriman Hersha Vikramaditya of Kashmir History who destroyed the Sakas,\" and whom he identifies with Sapur II of Ir\u00e2n.\n\n1 Journal, B.

Vide above, pp. 159\u2013200. Ibid., p. 296.\nThis article draws the attention of a Parsee from the fact that it alludes to Seleucus as a Parsee king. The article is based on the writing of a German scholar, who was famous as well for his Iranian studies as for his Indian studies. Lassen's name is known to Iranian scholars as the editor of the first five chapters of the Vendidad (1852), and as the author of \"Die alt-persischen Keilschriften von Persepolis\" (1836).\n\nAs it is well pointed out, Asoka was to Buddhism, what Constantine was to Christianity, and Vishtasp or Gushtasp to Zoroastrianism. As Sir E. Perry says, the Hindus may be as proud of Asoka as the Mahomedans of Akbar. Now, in going through this article from a Parsee point of view, we find that Chandragupta (the Sandrocotus of the Greeks), the grandfather of Asoka, ejected from his dominions a king of the Nanda dynasty, and captured his territories. The king of the Nanda dynasty then sought the help of five other Hindu Rajas and of \"the Great King of the Mlechas or Parasikas (Parsis)\". This great King of the Parasikas or the Parsees was, as Lassen says, Seleucus, \"the then reigning Prince of Persia.\" Now the question is, why did the native writers call Seleucus a great King of the Parasikas or the Parsees? Was he a Parsee or Zoroastrian? No, he was not. So, perhaps, they called him a Parsee, because he occupied the throne of the Parsees. Or, perhaps, because he came from the western country of Persia. In the same way, the later Parsee books called Alexander, a Christian, because, he came from the country of Roum or Asia Minor, whence the Christian emperors of Rome invaded their country. Or, perhaps, they followed some, since lost, much later Persian writings, which, with the false idea of saving the Persians from the ignominy of being considered as defeated and ruled by a foreigner, called Seleucus a Persian or Parsee, just as they called Alexander a Persian or Parsee, saying that he was descended from D\u00e2r\u00e2 or Darius.\n\nIt is well known, that the Ancient Persians had, at one time or another, invaded India, and had made their influence felt in the country in various ways. Old historical books, tradition and coins prove this fact. This paper, resting on the authority of the coins of two ancient dynasties,\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. VII., pp. 1\u201436. 10th September 1863.\n2 Ibid.\n3 The S\u00e2h dynasty is supposed to have ruled from 70 or 60 B.C. to 225 A.D.\n4 Vide my paper, \"The Bas-Relief of Behar\u00e2m Gour at Naksh-i-Rustam and his Marriage with an Indian Princess.\" Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XIX., pp. 58\u201475. Vide my \"Asiatic Papers,\" pp. 67\u201484.\noffers an indirect proof of this fact. The author says: \"With the exception of the Punjab and Sind, where the coinages of the Bactrian monarchs are to be met with, there is no part of India where coins are found so artistic in design and execution as those supplied by Guzerat and Kattiawar. The yields of these districts claim a high interest from the circumstance that they are plainly traceable to Greek originals.\" He lays down the principle that the \"changes in the execution of the dies, indicative of a gradual deterioration of numismatic art,\" determine \"the order of the series.\" Proceeding on this principle, he says that \"it is unquestionable that the S\u0101h coinages are imitations from Greek originals. Prinsep, when first alluding to them, before their decipherment, remarked that 'the very style and beauty of some of the earlier specimens might be enough to convince an artist or sculptor of the fact, for we might in vain seek such accurate delineations of the human features on any genuine Hindoo coin.' We should expect, therefore, to find the highest exhibition of art in the coins of the first princes of the series, while the connection with Parthia or Bactria was yet recent, and a gradual deterioration in those of their successors as the dynasty had become isolated.\"\n\nWorking on this principle, the author examines a number of coins, and among them, some new ones that had come to his hands, and sees in their series an outline of history. He says: \"Should the conclusions stated in this paper be correct, we have an outline history of the northern part of this Presidency already sketched out from a date not long subsequent to that of Alexander down to the end of the sixth or seventh century of our era. Passing by Chandra Gupta Maruya, the contemporary of the great Macedonian, and the Bactrian Demetrius, whose invasion of India may be conceded on the testimony of Strabo, we have grounds of admitting the influence, if not the paramount authority in Saurashtra, of Menander, to whom Professor Wilson assigns the date B.C. 126, and whose coins the author of the Periplus states to have been still current in Broach at the end of the first century after Christ. The S\u0101hs must apparently have risen to power very early in the first century of the Christian era, and the last sovereign of the line appears to have reigned about A.D. 250. Kum\u0101ra Gupta and Skanda Gupta immediately succeeded them, and these were followed by the Valabhi dynasty, whose era dating from A.D. 319 is generally admitted. Col. Tod gives A.D. 524 as the date of the sack of Valabhi, and the evidence deducible from the coins of the dynasty may be held to favour the conclusion that their empire continued at least some two centuries. Their downfall was attributed by Col. Tod to an army of Parthians and Scythians, but Mr. Elphinstone has suggested that the invaders may have been Sassanians, probably under Naushirvan; and in this\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. VII., p. i. 2 Ibid., p. 20. 3 Ibid., p. 20.\nevent, we have doubtless an explanation of the occurrence of the \"Gadhia\" coins already alluded to. Barbarized as these are, the attempt to delineate the bust and fire altar of the Sassanides is evident; and it is certain, therefore, either that the Sassanian monarchy obtained a footing in Guzerat, or, as is more probable, that an offshoot of the dynasty succeeded in establishing an empire there. The time assigned to the fall of Valabhi was one when such an irruption was probable, and if the number of debased Gadhias, which from time to time come to light, may be looked on as indicative of a rule extending over a century or two, our researches hitherto will bring us down to the commencement or end of the seventh century of our era, and close with a race of Sassanian origin reigning in Kutch, Kattiarwar, and Guzerat.\"\n\nMr. Newton here tries to show, that the Ancient Persians had, for centuries, a political influence of one kind or another on India from the time of Alexander, either direct or indirect, through Parthia and Bactria. We know, that in the third century B.C., out of the 12 satrapies of Persia, three were Indian. The first extended from the Paroponessus to the Indus, the second from Indus, properly so called to the Hydaspes, and the third on the lower Indus from Pattala. Eucratides, king of Bactria, is supposed to have sent expeditions into Cutch and Gujar\u00e2t (181\u2014161 B.C.).\n\nFerishta tries to trace the connection between India and Persia from very remote times, beginning with Peshdadian Faridun. He says: \"Some authors, however, relate that Fureedoon even possessed the Punjab; and that the descendants of Koorshasp (Kersh\u00e2sp), down to the celebrated Roostom, held it in subjection, together with Kabul, Tibhet, Sind, and Nemrooz.\" A Hindu Raja of Punjab, Kesoo Ray by name, who is said to have marched victoriously, at one time as far south as Shewala Dweep (Ceylon) is said to have later on asked the aid of Minocheher, who sent S\u00e2m, the son of Nariman to his aid. Kesoo Ray established his power with this Persian aid. Munere Ray, his son, turned faithless to the Persians and took away the country held by the Persians from the hands of the officers of Zal. So, later on, Kaikob\u00e2d sent Rustam to reconquer it. Rustam did so and placed a Hindoo chief Sooruj on the throne. It was in his time that Hindus, who hitherto reverenced the sun like the Persians, became idol-worshipers at the instance of a Brahmin. Later on Kedar Raja paid a tribute to K\u00e2us and Kaikhosru. Ferishta then traces the connection of Persia with India from the time of Ardeshir Babeg\u00e2n to that of Khushro Parviz.\n\nMr. Newton has continued his researches in this line in his second similar paper, entitled \"On Recent Additions to Our Knowledge of the Ancient Dynasties of Western India,\" read on 9th July 1868.\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid, pp. 35-36. 2 Brigg's Ferishta I. Introductory Chapter on the Hindoos, p. LXVI.\n3 Ibid, p. LXVII. 4 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. IX., No. XXV., pp. 1\u201419. Vide below, p. 309.\nIn this paper there are some references that are interesting from a Parsee point of view.\n\nIn describing inscription No. 14 in the Nasik Caves, the authors say: \"This inscription is evidently a record of the doings of Ushvad\u0101ta, the son-in-law of Nahap\u0101na, the son of King Kshahar\u0101ta.\"\n\nThis Nahap\u0101na was a Parthian King. All the three names, mentioned above, seem on their face to be Iranian. Dr. Bhau Daji refers to this king in his paper on Inscriptions at Junagur. He says: \"The Parthian King Nahap\u0101na, the exploits of whose son-in-law Ushvad\u0101ta are recorded at Nasika, clearly flourished before Chashtana and Padum\u0101vi. The success with which Ushavad\u0101ta conducted his expedition to Malaya or Malabar from the North through the Deccan, shows that the princes of Paithan and of Mah\u0101-Andhra could not have been very powerful. I was strongly inclined to look upon Gautamiputra as the founder of the S\u0101liv\u0101hana era, but the claims of Nahap\u0101na appear to be much more probable.\"\n\nThus the cave inscriptions, in addition to coins and old books, show that the Ancient Persians had exerted great power up to Khandeish and even further south.\n\nThe paper of the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Newton, read, on 9th July 1868, under the title of \"Recent Additions to our Knowledge of the Ancient Dynasties of Western India,\" may be read with advantage in connection with this paper.\n\nThis paper arrests the mind of a Parsee from an industrial point of view. Dr. Birdwood says that the \"Inlaid work\" was introduced into Bombay about 60 years ago (i.e., about 102 years ago from this date) from Hyderabad in Sind, where it was introduced from Persia, twenty years previous to its introduction into Bombay. Dr. Birdwood gives a list of the names of the manufacturers in this work in Bombay. The list shows, that out of 51 manufacturers 22 were Parsees. This shows, that the Parsees at that time took up gladly the work, that was imported here from what was once their father-land. At present the number of manufacturers has fallen very low.\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. VII., p. 49.\n2 Ibid., pp. 113\u2013131. Vide below, p. 309.\n3 Ibid., p. 118.\n4 Journal, B. B.

In this paper, the author continues the examination of the subject, that there was once \"a line of sovereigns\" which connected \"the northern portions of this Presidency with Parthia and Bactria and through them with Greece.\"\u00b2 He speaks especially of the S\u0101h dynasty, and says that it can be traced \"upwards to one of the Greek monarchies.\"\u00b3\n\nFrom a report of the Proceedings of the meeting of the Society of 11th July 1867, we learn, that the President, Mr. Justice Newton, had placed before the Society \"some unique specimens of the coins of Sv\u0101mi Chashtana (who is mentioned in the rock inscription at Girnar) and of Nahap\u0101\u1e47a (whose name occurs on the cave inscription at N\u0101sik and elsewhere).\"\u2074 He said, these coins showed \"the close connection of both sovereigns and especially the former, with the dynasty of the S\u0101hs,\" and pointed out \"that although the S\u0101h series is now traced up to names which one would be inclined to set down with much confidence as Parthian, the type of these highest coins of the series as well as of the later S\u0101h coinage bears a much less close resemblance to the coinage of the Parthians than to that of the Bactrian Greeks.\"\u2075 Mr. Newton then referred to the fact, that in the several cave inscriptions at N\u0101sik, Karlen, and Junir, Nahap\u0101\u1e47a was mentioned, and said, that he proposed speaking at some length in the future over the subject of these coins. This paper, then, is the result of his promised further inquiries. \"These coins proved,\" as said by Dr. Wilson at the meeting, \"that the Bactrian power had extended to Saur\u0101sh\u1e6dra or the peninsula of Gujarat.\"\u2076\n\nAt the above monthly meeting of 11th July 1867, the President, Mr. Justice Newton, laid before the Society a number of coins presented by the Chief of Kathiawar. Among the coins so presented there was one from the Thakur of Morvi on which Mr. Justice Newton made the following remarks\u2077:\n\n\"Silver coin of the Sassanian type, already alluded to, interesting as approaching nearer to the original coinage of the Sassanid\u00e6 than any specimen that has before reached me from Gujarat or Kathiawar.\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B.

The first in the series is a coin of the Sassanians, beautifully executed and full of detail, and in the coin now received from Kathiawar it will not be difficult, though there is a lamentable falling off, to trace on the obverse the bust of the King, and on the reverse the same fire altar and two priests. In the subsequent specimens all knowledge of the original designs appears to have faded away. First the ear ornaments of the king cease to be recognised, are separated from the bust, and figured as a distinct device; then different parts of the bust and face are gradually isolated or lost; and ultimately an assemblage of lines and dots is arrived at, which, but for the means which we possess of tracing the descent, step by step, it would be impossible to identify as intended to be a representation of the artistic bust and fire altar on the original coin.\"\n\nJournal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. X, No. XXX., pp. 316\u2014407.\n\n12th September 1874.\n\nThere is one statement in this paper which arrests the attention of a Parsee. It is a quotation from Goez\u00b9 which states: \"The persecution of the Portuguese had made many Hind\u00fbs, Mussulmans, and Parsees abandon their homes and live in the dominion of Shah Jehan, where they had liberty of conscience; and that between Bassein and Damaun there are few natives, the greater part of the village lands being uncultivated.\"\u00b2 Dr. DaCunha then describes at some length, on the authority of a Portuguese writer, the stringent decrees issued throughout Portuguese India affecting the non-Christian population. It shows how shabbily the non-Christians were treated by the Portuguese.\n\nNow, we have the authority of a Parsee book to say, that the Portuguese ill-treated the Parsees in the matter of their religious belief. It is the \"Kisseh-i-Zartushti\u00e2n-i-Hindust\u00e2n,\" by Dastur Shapurjee Sanjana.

The rule of that king spread over Sanj\u0101n [and] all the wise men of good habits got frightened.

Prof. Rehatsek says: \"As the ancients have laid the foundations of all the practical and theoretical sciences we now possess, and we have during the lapse of thousands of years become heirs to all the accumulated knowledge which has escaped the ravages of time, and has been preserved to be improved and augmented by future ages, it\n\n\u00b9 Vide my article on \"A Few Events in the Early History of the Parsis\" in the Zarthoshti, Vol. I., No. IV., pp. 285\u2013289. \u00b2 Elliot's History of India, Vol. VII., pp. 344-345.\n\u00b3 Ibid., p. 344. \u2074 Vol. XIII., Part I., p. 254.\n\u2075 Journal, B.

It cannot be denied that when the Greeks were in a state of almost complete barbarism, the Chaldaeans and Egyptians had made considerable progress in astronomy, and it is certain that the Greek astronomers of the school of Alexandria had recourse to Chaldaean observations; whilst before their time Thales in the 7th, Plato in the 5th, Eudoxus in the 5th, and Pythagoras in the 2nd Century before Christ, went from Greece to the Egyptian priests to seek instruction. Hence it is clear that the Greeks were not the inventors of astronomy; and although we have mentioned only the Chaldaeans and the Egyptians as their teachers, there is the greatest probability that the Chinese, the Hindus and Persians, likewise furnished their quota of astronomical information, but that, on account of the immense distance and the want of close intercourse with these nations, the Greeks became acquainted with their discoveries only at second-hand.\"\n\nI think, that the knowledge, which the Greeks derived from the Persians, was, to some extent, direct and not second-hand. Compared to India and China, Persia was nearer Greece. The Greeks came into frequent contact with the Persians in the times of their Achemenian rulers. We have the authority of a Pahlavi book, to say, that the Greeks translated a good deal from the books of one of the two great Persian libraries. The Dinkard says:\n\nDayan vazand i min mar-i-dush gadman Alaksandar val Airan shatr dayan khudaiyeh mad zak i val daz i napisht napisht\u00ea val suzashn\u00ea va zak i pavan Ganj-i-Shaspig\u00e2n val yadman i Arumay\u00e2n mad va avash valach yutnaik jioto\u00e2\u00eek uzv\u00e2n vajard\u00ea va pavan ak\u00e2si\u00e2h i min pishinig\u00e2n gost\u00ea.\n\nTranslation.\u2014During the calamity which spread in the country of Ir\u00e2n from the wicked, notorious Alexander during his rule, that (library) which was in the Daz-i-Napisht was burnt, and that which was in the Ganj-i-Shaspigan came to the hands of the Arumay\u00e2n Greeks), and they got it rendered into the Greek language for getting information about the sayings of the ancients.\n\nFrom this passage we learn, then, that the Greeks took a good deal direct from the Ancient Persians. That a portion of this ancient literature\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A.

Sanjana, Vol. IX., Pahlavi Text, p. 450. s.3. English translation, p. 569.\nof the Persians, which the Greeks of Alexander translated into Greek, must have treated of astronomy, is clear from the contents of the Nusks given in the Pahlavi and Persian literature. We learn from the Din-kard \\(^1\\), that one of the twenty-one nusks (books) treated of the constellations. The Revayats speak of the sixth book, N\u00e2dar, as treating of the science of astronomy \\((\\text{\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645}).\\) \\(^2\\)\n\nAs to the time when the Arabs took most of the knowledge of astronomy and other sciences from the Greeks, Rehatsek says:\n\n\"We shall not say anything about the astronomy of the Ancient Arabs, their practical acquaintance with this science having been scarcely more extensive than that possessed by the Greeks before the time of Thales, and they began to make it an object of serious study only during the period of the Abbasside Khalifs. The celebrated Al Man\u00e7\u00fbr, surnamed Abu Ja'fer, was concerned most in the intellectual revolution which then commenced to manifest itself among the Arabs. He ascended the throne about the middle of the 8th century (A.H. 136, A.D. 754), encouraged the sciences by his liberality, by the favours wherewith he honoured those who cultivated them, but above all by his own example, because he devoted himself with much ardour to the study of astronomy. His successors followed in his footsteps; the celebrated Har\u00fbn Al-Rashid and his son Muhammad Al-Amin favoured with all their might the movement of civilization which had manifested itself among the Arabs. But among all the Arab princes who became celebrated by their love for the sciences, the Khal\u00eef Al-M\u00e2m\u00fbn-A'bd-Allah, second son of Har\u00fbn, who ascended the throne A. H. 198 (A.D. 813-14), is deserving of special mention. He protected the sciences as a sovereign and a philosopher; for, magnanimous like Alexander, he never forgot, even in his warlike expeditions, the noble purpose he had in view. He imposed on Michael III. a tribute of books, constituting the treasures of the ancient civilization of Greece, and afterwards waged war against Theophilus, who had refused to allow Leo, the Archbishop of Thessalonica to depart to Baghdad, and whom this Christian prince allowed to live on the price of the lessons which he was obliged to give to slaves. Beginning with the reign of Al M\u00e2m\u00fbn, all the sciences, but particularly astronomy, took a prodigious start among the Arabs, and crowds of men remarkable for their works and for their scientific attainments surrounded his throne. . . . The astronomers of Baghdad made a great many important observations, and drew up new tables of the sun and of the moon more exact than those of Ptolemy.\" \\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) S. B.

S., Vol. XI., pp. 315-316.\nThere is one point in this paper that is interesting to the Parsees from an historical point of view. It is the fact, alluded to on the authority of Zakariya-al-Kazwini, that, in the 13th Century, Chaul (now called Revd\u00e2nd\u00e2) was inhabited by a number of Parsees.\n\nThere are two towns of the name of Chaul. One is that referred to by Dr. Da Cunha, and the other is near Dharampore in the Buls\u00e2r District. The town of Ch\u00e2ul referred to in some of the old documents of the town of Na\u00f4s\u00e2ri seems to be the latter. I had the pleasure of visiting the first Chaul (Revd\u00e2nd\u00e2) in November 1904, to find, if there were any remains of the fire-temples, referred to by Zakariya. I found there no vestige of any Parsee population there in previous times.\n\nIn this paper, Pandit Bhagv\u00e2nl\u00e2l gives the description of a plate in which Mr. Codrington had arranged 20 coins of the type known in Gujar\u00e2t as Gadhia coins and in K\u00e2thiaw\u00e2d as Gadhai coins. The coins are so arranged in the plate as to give \"the gradual transition from the Persian face and fire-altar, seen in the former (Sassanian coins), into the oblong button dots and lines on the latter (Gadhia) coins, and which showed pretty plainly that the so-called Gadhias are a debased imitation of the coins of the Sassanian Kings of about the 6th or 7th Century A.D.\" The coins show \"a pretty complete gradation so as to establish the supposed origin of the Gadhia design. . . The name of the coin is derived from the Sanskrit Gardhabhiya meaning of the Gardhabhi dynasty.\"\n\nAccording to Wilford, \"Gardh\u00e2bhi is a name of a family of Sassanian kings subsequent to the period of Varahv\u00e2n Gor (Behramgour): consequently, the date of the beginning of this currency would be subsequent to A.D. 420, when that king flourished.\" The face of the king on the obverse and the fire-altar on the reverse of the coin No. 1, are very clear, and they gradually go on being corrupted in the subsequent coins.\n\nThe Sassanian type appears not only on the coins of India, but also in the paintings, such as those of B\u00e2gh in M\u00e2lw\u00e2 and Ajant\u00e2 in Khan-deish, which are believed to have been made about the 6th Century.\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B.

The punched coins, in which the design is punched into the metal.\n2. The small coins having Buddhist figures, resembling those on the punched coins, but struck on the metal with a die.\n3.

The division of spirits into good and bad ones, i.e., Izeds and Devs, is naturally a remnant of the ancient demonolatry of Eastern Asia in general, and of Shamanism in particular, of which Zoroastrianism itself appears to be only a more noble development, founded on the same basis, i.e., the existence of mighty and of subordinate good and evil spirits, exerting either a preserving or a destructive influence on everything contained in Nature.\"\u00b9\n\nTheir Shimnus, a kind of powerful spirit, \"resemble the Zoroastrian Ahriman with his evil spirits.\"\u00b2\n\nRehatsek compares the persecution of the Mahomedans by the Mongols with that of the Zoroastrians by the Mahomedans. He says: \"When the Mongols took Herat, on the 4th of June 1222 (2nd of Jom\u00e2da anterior 619), they are said to have slaughtered more than a million and a half of the population, and their work of pillaging, burning, and demolishing lasted a whole week without intermission. Thus it may be seen how an avenging Nemesis abundantly repaid the Moslems for the great persecutions they had practised on the Zoroastrians, when they destroyed the Sasanian dynasty, subjugated Persia by fire and sword, and thrust Islam on the whole population.\"\u00b3\n\nAmong the observances ordered by that great Mongol conqueror Chenghiz Khan, one is that of the prohibition \"to void urine in water or fire.\" This, Rehatsek thinks, \"is perhaps traceable to the immemorial belief in the sacredness of the so-called four elements still surviving in Zoroastrianism, and formerly universal in the whole of Central Asia; this veneration was carried so far that even the hands were not to be dipped into flowing water, and clothes were not washed, but worn till they fell to pieces: which appears to be an exaggerated application of an injunction, salutary to nomadic tribes, to be sparing of water, which they generally carry about in their wanderings in skins, that can be replenished only when they happen to pass near streams.\"\u2074\n\nIn my review\u2075 of Rehatsek's paper on Christianity in the Persian dominions, I referred to an instance, in which the early Christian bishops of Persia professed to drive away demons that possessed certain people,\n\n\u00b9 Ibid, p. 182. \u00b2 Ibid, p. 183. \u00b3 Ibid, p. 204.\n\u2074 Ibid pp. 214-215. \u2075 Vide above, p. 248.\nand thus gained the faith of the non-Christians by their so-called miracles. In this paper also, we have a similar case of the early Christian fathers professing to drive away the demons. Prof. Rehatsek quotes\u00b9 the Franciscan father Odoric of Udine, who says: \"In those regions, God Almighty hath bestowed such grace upon the Minor Friars that in Great Tartary they think it a mere nothing to expel devils from the possessed,\u2014no more, indeed, than to drive a dog out of a house. For there be many in those parts, possessed by the devil, both men and women, and these they bind and bring to our friars from as far as a ten-days' journey off. The friars bid the demons depart forth instantly from the bodies of the possessed in the name of Jesus Christ, and they do depart immediately in obedience to his command. Then those who have been delivered from the demon straightway come themselves to be baptized. . . . And in this way our friars baptize great numbers in that country.\"\u00b2\n\nIt appears, that as late as in the reign of Gh'azan Kh\u00e2n, who reigned from 1295 to 1303 as a Western or Persian Mongol Khan in Persia, Zoroastrian temples were plundered and their riches taken away by the Mongols. Rehatsek speaking of this Khan says: \"Afterwards we find Gh'azan Khan. . . . giving written orders to them (i.e., to his troops), in consequence of which they plundered a number of Christian Churches and Zoroastrian temples known to contain gold and jewels. To please N\u00fbr\u00fbz, who had raised him to the throne, but chiefly to extort money, Gh'az\u00e2n persecuted Christians; Zoroastrians, however, Jews, and even Buddhists were not excepted.\"\u00b3\n\nIII.\n\nNow we come to the third part of our paper. We will have a glimpse here into the Abstracts of the Proceedings of the Society from a Parsee point of view.\n\nTransactions of the Literary Society of Bombay, Vol. I., pp. xxv\u2014xli. 26th November 1804.\n\nIn his very first discourse, read at Parel on 26th November 1804, on the occasion of the foundation of the parent Society, \"The Literary Society of Bombay,\" Sir James Mackintosh, the founder and the first President, said: \"The objects of these (scientific) inquiries, as of all human knowledge, are reducible to two classes,\"\u2074 (1) Physical and (2) Moral. Among the moral objects of inquiries, he attached great importance to statistics about\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. XIII., p. 276.\n\u00b2 Cathay and the Way thither, by Col.

B., Vol. I., p. xviii.\n\"the numbers of the people; the number of births, marriages, and deaths; the proportion of children who are reared to maturity.\" He added: \"I need not expatiate on the importance of the information which such tables would be likely to afford. I shall mention only as an example of their value that they must lead to a decisive solution of the problems with respect to the influence of polygamy on population, and the supposed origin of that practice in the disproportioned number of the sexes.\"\n\nIn the Note latterly attached to this Preliminary discourse, and specially referring to the above part of inquiry, we find the following statistics of the Parsee population of Bombay in 1811 A.D. As they are not found in any Parsee records, they are worth noting here:\n\n\"List of Parsee caste now Inhabitants of Bombay.\n\nMen from 20 to 80 years of age ... ... ... 3,644\nWomen do. do. ... ... ... 3,333\nBoys from 20 down to infant children ... ... ... 1,799\nGirls do. do. ... ... ... 1,266\n\nTotal ... 10,042\n\nBombay, February 28, 1811.\"\n\nOn the subject of the mortality among the Parsees during the years 1800 to 1808, the Note says: \"It must be observed that many of the Parsees come to Bombay in search of fortune after having reached the age of manhood, and return with a competency to their native countries. Some of them are men of great wealth; many are in easy circumstances; and none are of the most indigent classes. From these circumstances the comparatively low rate of their mortality and the smaller number of their females will be easily understood. The famine increased their mortality from 311 in 1802 to 563 in 1804, an augmentation almost entirely to be attributed to deaths of the fugitive Parsees, who were attracted to Bombay by the well-known charity of their opulent fellow-religionists.\"\n\nTo compare with the above figures of February 1811, given in the Note on the Preliminary Discourse of Sir James Mackintosh, I give below the figures of the Parsee population, according to the last Census of 1901:\n\nMen from 20 to 80 years of age ... ... ... 14,706\nWomen do. do. ... ... ... 13,005\nBoys from 20 down to infant children ... ... ... 9,571\nGirls do. do. ... ... ... 8,949\n\nTotal ... 46,231\n\n1 Ibid, p. xxi. 2 Ibid. 3 Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay, Vol. I.

The Society subscribed 5 copies of the book. In his letter to Dr. Wilson, Westergaard writes about, what he calls, the two dialects of the Zend language. \"It is not difficult to distinguish between them, especially aided by the oldest manuscripts, as the difference is very strong, and observed not only in the use of different words, or different forms of the same word, but even in the grammatical structure. As the Zend language must be referred to the Eastern parts of Iran, I hazard resting, among other facts, on the authority of Straled, about the difference of the dialects of Bactriana and Sogdiana to assign to our two dialects the names of Bactrian and Sogdian in such a way that I should call with the name of Sogdian that dialect in which the greater part of the Yashna is composed, as it is evidently more rude and more unpolished than that of the other parts of the Zendavesta.\"\u00b2\n\nDr. Haug said of Westergaard's edition: \"Westergaard has taken great trouble to give a correct text, according to the oldest manuscripts accessible to him, and his edition is, in most cases, far preferable to the manuscripts used by the priests of modern times. If older manuscripts than those used by Westergaard be known to the Dasturs, they should consider it their bounden duty to procure them for the purpose of collation with Westergaard's valuable edition, so that they may ascertain all preferable readings for their own information and that of other scholars. Why will they remain behind the Brahmins and the Jews, who have preserved their sacred writings so well and facilitated modern researches to so great an extent?\"\u00b3\n\nThese words of Dr. Haug have not fallen on deaf ears. The latest edition of the Avesta is the very valuable text prepared by Professor Geldner, in the preparation of which, the Dasturs and Mobads of Bombay and elsewhere have offered a good help by lending their old manuscripts.\n\n\u00b9 Appendix, pp. 1\u201330. \u00b2 Journal, B.B.R.A.S., Vol. IV., p. 143. \u00b3 Haug's Essays, 2nd ed., p. 77.\nAt a meeting of 9th October 1851, Dr. Wilson read an extract of a letter from Prof. Westergaard, intimating the publication of his Bundehesh, \"and expressing his opinion, founded on a critical examination of the so-called Pehlivi writings, that they are not in any Sasanian language, but merely in a dialect (probably the Kirmanian) of the modern Persian, disguised by the use of an imperfect alphabet, often now mis-read by the Parsees, the Shemitic words introduced into it being merely corrupted Arabic.\"\n\nI have referred above to Dr. Spiegel's view about the Pahlavi language, which is opposed to that of Westergaard. For remarks on the Bundehesh, I will refer my readers to Dr. West's essay on the Pahlavi language and literature recently published under the title of \"Pahlavi Literature.\"\n\nFrom the Extracts of the Proceedings of the Society given in the fourth volume of the Journal, we gather the following points of interest from a Parsee point of view:\n\nAt a meeting of the Society, held on 31st March 1850, \"the Rev. J. M. Mitchell had read an extract of a letter from Dr. Graul of Leipsic, containing a strong request that the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society would aid in the rendering into English of the Gujarati versions of the Zend Avesta as one important contribution towards the elucidation of the Zend text.\" After some discussion the following resolution was unanimously agreed to, viz.\u2014\"That the desirableness of having an English translation of the Gujarati version and the commentary of Framjee Aspandiarjee on the Zend Avesta having been brought forward, the Society fully recognizes the importance of the proposal, and resolves to discuss it more fully at its next meeting; appointing in the meantime the Rev. Dr. Stevenson, Rev. J. M. Mitchell, C. J. Erskine, Esq., and H. Green, Esq., to consider and report on the whole question.\"\n\nAt a meeting of the Society, held on 18th April 1850, the Committee \"reported that, after full inquiry, it was convinced of the desirableness and practicability of the scheme, but as several modes of carrying it into execution had been suggested, they would beg permission to report on this specific point to a future meeting. The Society agreed to the report and continued the Committee.\" The proposed translation has not appeared as yet.\n\nAt a meeting of the Society, held on 13th November 1851, the late Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee Patel read a Prospectus concerning a Zend Dictionary.\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. IV., p. 153.\n2 Vide above, pp. 222-26.\n3 Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie II., Band i, Lieferung III.\n4 Journal, B. B. R. A. S., Vol. III, No. XIV, Extracts from the Proceedings of the Society, pp. 342-343.\n5 Ibid., p. 343.\nhe proposed publishing in Gujarati and English and submitted a specimen of it. At a meeting, held on 14th October 1852, Rev. Murray Mitchell communicated to the Society, a few extracts from a letter, which he had received from Prof. Spiegel. In that letter Dr. Spiegel referred to the above prospectus of Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Patel, and expressed his satisfaction at the prospect of having a Zend dictionary in English. He said: \"I am convinced that we may still learn much from the Parsis; and I want to get out of them what they do know as soon as possible, and before it vanishes entirely.\"\n\nThe Dictionary proposed by Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee Patel has not been published. But we have the satisfaction to know, that the wish of Dr. Spiegel has been fulfilled in his lifetime, nearly 48 years after its first expression, by the publication of a Zend Dictionary in English and Gujarati, in 1900 A.D., by the pen of the late lamented Ervad Kavasji Edalji Kanga, Principal of the Mulla Feroze Madressa of Bombay. In the death of that unassuming learned scholar in March 1904, Parsi scholarship has lost one of its best exponents. He has also published the Gujarati translation, with grammatical notes, of the whole of the Avesta text and an Avesta grammar in Zend. His Gujarati translations will remain as standard translations among the Parsis for many a year to come, because they are prepared on modern scientific methods, while the translation of the late Mr. Aspandiarji Framjee, published under the auspices of our Society on the recommendation of Dr. Wilson, are prepared in the old traditional way. Mr. Kavasji Kanga has also prepared a Dictionary from English into Avesta and it will be shortly published as his posthumous work.\n\nAt a meeting held on 12th February 1852, Rev. Murray Mitchell referred in his paper on Zend literature, reviewed above, to Dr. Spiegel's edition of the Avesta texts and their Pahlavi rendering. The Society resolved to buy two copies of the book, and opened a subscription list for the book. Revd. Mitchell also referred to this book in his letter placed before the Society at its meeting of 14th October 1852.\n\nIn the fourth volume (No. XVI.) we have a \"brief memorial\" and the obituary notice of two orientalists.\n\nThe first was presented on the 15th July 1852. It was a \"Brief Memorial of the Literary Researches of the late William Erskine,\" Esq., by Dr. John Wilson. This memorial article presents an interesting estimate of the literary work of Mr. Erskine, the first Secretary of our Society, who was associated with his father-in-law, Sir James\n\n---\n\n1 Journal, B.

We have noticed above\u00b9 the papers on Iranian subjects read by Erskine to which Dr. Wilson refers.\n\nThe second is an obituary notice of a French scholar. It is entitled, \"The late Professor Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, of Paris, and his Oriental Publications.\"\u00b2\n\nUnder this heading, the Journal of our Society has transferred to its columns, with a few remarks of its own, the obituary notice of this great French savant, who was an Honorary Member of our Society. The character of Burnouf's writings is very excellently summed up in the notice in these words:\u2014\"Ses travaux resteront comme des mod\u00e8les o\u00f9 la rapidit\u00e9 du coup d'\u0153il, la m\u00e9thode de l'examen, la nettet\u00e9 des conclusions sont accompagn\u00e9es d'une conscience pleine d'autorit\u00e9.\"\u00b3 His \"Commentaire sur le Ya\u00e7na,\" which is really a monumental work, clearly illustrates this view of his writings. Anquetil Du Perron had brought to light the ancient writings of the Avesta, and it was left to his compatriot, after about 70 years, to complete his work by laying the foundation of the scientific and philological method of studying the Avesta. As Prof. Wilhelm says, his book is still a model of the way in which Avesta studies should be carried on. Prof. Wilhelm says: \"Son livre est encore aujourd'hui un mod\u00e8le de la m\u00e9thode \u00e0 suivre dans les \u00e9tudes avestiques. Il nous montre comment on doit travailler, ce que le travailleur doit demander \u00e0 ses sources et \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame. La m\u00e9thode de Burnouf est purement philologique.\"\u2074\n\nThe editor of our Journal says in his preliminary remarks that he was \"a most valued correspondent of most of our Eastern scholars.\"\u2075 This remark reminds us of a book published in 1897 by Madame L'Delisle, the daughter of M. Burnouf, under the title of \"Papiers d'Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, conserv\u00e9s \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. Catalogue dress\u00e9 par M. L\u00e9on Feer.\" In the appendix to this book, we have the letters of Burnouf addressed to different correspondents in the matter of his books and studies. Among these correspondents, we find the name of a well-known member of our Society, the late Mr. Manockjee Cursetjee\u2076. We have in this book, 12 letters of Burnouf, addressed to Mr. Manockjee\u2014from 26th June 1836 to 16th May 1845. These letters, the first of which begins with the formal word \"Monsieur,\" and the last with the affectionate and friendly terms \"Mon cher et honorable ami,\" give us a glimpse of the character of two of our past members, who both have left, in their own spheres, lasting memo-\n\n\u00b9 Vide above, pp. 167-68, 177-183, 183-87. \u00b2 Journal, Vol. IV., pp. 284-288. \u00b3 Ibid, p. 287.\n\u2074 \u00c9tudes Avestiques.

Burnouf, the two distinguished members of our Society.\nrials of their services, direct or indirect, to the Parsee community. Mr. Manockjee Cursetjee's name is well known among us, as that of, if not the first, one of the first, champions of female education among the Parsis. Burnouf's monumental work, \"Commentaire sur le Ya\u00e7na,\" has given an altogether new turn to the study of the Avesta. In the first letter to Mr. Manockjee Cursetjee, M. Burnouf gets a little enthusiastic, for having an opportunity to correspond with a man of the blood of Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes. After referring to the fault of the Parsees in having neglected their ancient language, he says: \"Mais en m\u00eame temps, je serais bien malheureux si je pouvais croire qu'il f\u00fbt permis de supposer, d'apr\u00e8s mes observations critiques, que j'ai voulu manquer de respect pour les nobles d\u00e9bris d'un des peuples les plus h\u00e9ro\u00efques et les plus grands de l'antiquit\u00e9; je ne puis au contraire penser sans un vive \u00e9motion qu'il subsiste encore dans l'Inde des reste pr\u00e9cieux de cette belle nation persane, dont l'histoire se lie se intimement pendant deux si\u00e8cles \u00e0 tout ce que l'antiquit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne nous a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de plus grand, et que ces d\u00e9bris ont su, dans les temps modernes, s'\u00e9lever par le travail et l'exercice constant de leurs devoirs religieux et moraux au rang des nations les plus respectables de l'Asie. Permettez-moi m\u00eame d'\u00e9prouver quelque orgueil de me trouver, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 votre bienveillance, si directement en rapport avec un des plus glorieux repr\u00e9sentants de cette illustre race. Il me semble que je converse avec un homme du sang des K\u00fbl\u00fbs, des D\u00e2r\u00e2 et des Kch\u00e2hrch\u00e2, que nous autres Europ\u00e9ens nommons Cyrus, Darius et Xerx\u00e8s, et dont j'ai essay\u00e9 de lire les noms et d'expliquer les pens\u00e9es dans le M\u00e9moire sur vos antiques inscriptions de Perse, que je vous prie de vouloir bien recevoir avec indulgence.\"\n\nIn this letter, Burnouf expresses the great pleasure he felt in having the opportunity \"to converse,\" as he said, \"with a man of the blood of Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes\" by letters. Then, how much more must have been his pleasure, when, later on, he had the opportunity of meeting personally that man? From an article in \"La Nouvelle Revue\" entitled \"Lettres in\u00e9dites d'Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf et de Manakji Kharshedji,\" from the pen of Mademoiselle Menant, we learn, that when Mr. Manockjee Kharshedji went to Paris in December 1841, M. Burnouf on meeting him, exclaimed: \"A living Parsee, this is a glorious day!\" We find from M. Blochet's catalogue of Parsee books in the National Library of Paris, that Mr. Manockjee Kharshedj had helped Burnouf in his studies by presenting him with several Parsee books. The earliest date of this presentation is 1838.\n\n---\n\n1 Papiers d'Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, p. 127.  \n2 La Nouvelle Revue, 1891-92, p. 504.  \n3 Catalogue des Manuscrits Mazd\u00e9ens de la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale par E. Blochet, 1900, pp. 12, 57, 73.  \n4 Ibid., p. 57.\nThe obituary notice of Burnouf transferred to the columns of our Journal, presents a good appreciation of Burnouf's literary work. We may here draw the attention of our readers to M. Barth\u00e9lemy St. Hilaire's appreciation of Burnouf's works, translated into English by the late Mr. Ardeshir D. Lalkaka (1901), a promising Parsee student, who lately died in the prime of his youth.\n\nFrom the Abstract of the Proceedings of the Society given in the fifth volume of the Journal we gather the following points of interest:\n\nAt the meeting of 20th January 1853,\u00b9 the late Dastur Peshotan Behramji Sanjana submitted to the Society, through Mr. Green, a member of the Society, his Gujarati version of the Pahlavi inscription at Hajjabad near Naksh-i-Rustam. Mr. Manockjee Cursetjee, another member, was requested by the Society to communicate his views regarding the Dastur's decipherment and translation. On the receipt of this letter, \"an animated conversation took place as to the value of the Dastur's labours. . . . The Society requested that the Gujarati version forwarded by the Dastur, through Mr. Green, should be rendered into English, and submitted to the Society. A letter from Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee was also read, in which he stated that upwards of two years ago he had deciphered and translated the same important inscription, arriving, however, at considerably different results from those of the Dastur's labours. The Secretary was requested to communicate with Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee (who was not present) and obtain a copy of his translation, and the remarks which he stated himself prepared (?) proposed to make on the paper of Mr. Pestonji Behramji, in the hope that the communication of both these gentlemen in this difficult ancient record might ultimately be inserted in the Journal of the Society.\"\u00b2\n\nFrom the proceedings of the next meeting, i.e., of 17th February 1853, we learn that \"the translations of the Pehlivi inscriptions at Hajj-i-Abad, with the observations of the translators, Messrs. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee, and Pestonjee Dastur, which accompanied them, were delivered to Professor Harkness, for examination and report at the next meeting.\"\u00b3\n\nFrom the report of the proceedings of the meeting of 15th September 1853, we find Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee stating to the Society that he had seen copies of the Hajj-i-Abad Inscription, both in Sir Ker Porter's Travels\u2074 and in Prof. Westergaard's edition of the Bundhesh and that\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B.

(It is a pity, that somebody has removed this plate from the copy in the library of the Society.)\nhe found the latter carefully taken from the original. He had first deciphered and translated the inscription from Sir Ker Porter's copy, but he now submitted a fresh translation from Westergaard's copy. He added, that, as yet, he did \"not feel quite competent to place before orientalists a satisfactory translation of this inscription, because he is still doubtful of the orthographical and interchangeable value of some of the characters, which he will be better able to explain in the preface to his Zend Dictionary.\"\u00b9\n\nFrom the report of the proceedings of the meeting of 20th October 1853, we find that Dastur Peshotan also submitted his new translation made from Westergaard's more correct copy. He said with confidence: \"I have not spared any pains to render my decipherment and version faithful and accurate. I therefore have no hesitation in submitting the result to the criticism of the European public.\"\u00b2\n\nThe Society resolved to publish the decipherments and translations of both the authors in the next number of the journal. We do not find it published either in the next number, or in any of the succeeding numbers of the journals. Nor do we find any reason given for it. But it appears from a book of Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee Patel,\u00b3 that it may be due to the difficulty of getting the proper types. Mr. Dhunjeebhoy has latterly published his own decipherment and translation.\n\nThe report of the proceedings of the meeting of 17th November 1853 speaks of the presentation to the Society, by Mr. Barker, of the sepulchral urns \"found in a mound called Tel B\u00e2lari in the vicinity of Bagdad, which was excavated under his direction.\"\u2074 They were found in \"a sepulchral vault, containing about 150 urns, piled upon one another about ten feet deep, in a semi-circular form. Some of these contained calcined bones and ashes, also pieces of vitrified earth, glass and beads.\"\u2075 These urns are the ossuaries, or the Astod\u00e2n of the ancient Persians, referred to by Erskine in his paper before the Society on \"Observations on two sepulchral urns found at Bashire.\"\u2076 We know that this custom of preserving bones prevailed also among people other than the ancient Persians.\u2077 The fact of glass and beads being found in these urns, shows that they were the ossuaries, not of the ancient Zoroastrians, but of some other people. The Museum of our Society contains the old Astod\u00e2n sent to the Anthropological Society of Bombay, as referred to above,\u2078\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B. B., R. A.

It also contains two other urns which seem to be the urns referred to here, as presented by Mr. Barker.\n\nIn the meeting of 11th October 1855, was placed before the Society, the paper of Professor Spiegel, \"On the Avesta and the Zend and Pahlavi languages.\" I have referred to this paper above, at some length.\n\nI would refer here to one or two points in the remarks made by the late Dr. Wilson on Professor Spiegel's paper as reported in the Abstract of the Society's Proceedings.\n\nIn support of his views that \"the most ancient Avast\u00e2 pieces are certainly later than those contained in the Indian Vedas,\" Dr. Wilson points to the fact that \"with many resemblances to the religion of the Vedas, they (the Avesta pieces) have their antagonisms to it which shew posteriority.\" To illustrate his point he says: \"The Sun (Asura sometimes) is a god in the Vedas, with only subordinate attention, while he is the chief deity of the Zend writings, endowed with intellectual and moral attributes, Ahuro Mazda (Hormazd), the multiscient Sun or Lord, while in another form he is Hvar\u00eb-Kshaeta, the Resplendent or Ruling Sun or Khurshid.\" I wonder, how Dr. Wilson identifies Sun or Khorshed with Ahura Mazda. There is nothing of that kind in the Avesta. As to the antagonism itself, one fails to understand, how, that in itself, unsupported by other facts or circumstances, could prove the posteriority of one set of writings or the other.\n\nDr. Wilson, at the conclusion of his remarks, on seeing so many Parsee friends present, expressed his satisfaction that they were not \"altogether standing aloof from the interesting inquiries to which their literature is giving rise.\" If one is to believe\u2014and I am one of those who do believe\u2014that the spirits of the dead have a watchful interest in the good works with which they were associated in their lifetime\u2014and you may understand that form of belief in whatever way you like\u2014the spirit of that great Orientalist, who ruled, with a watchful eye, for several years, over the work of this Society, would be pleased, on the centenary of his dear institution, to observe, that the satisfaction expressed by him, about fifty years ago, was well expressed. As a proof of that, I would refer to two papers, read by Rev. Dr. Casartelli, Professor at St. Bede's College, Manchester,\n\n---\n\n1 I had the pleasure of exhibiting these at the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition held in Bombay in December 1904 and at the Centenary Conversazione of our Society held on 17th January 1905.\n2 Journal, B.

J. M. Mitchell. Spiegel herein speaks of his coming German translation and of his introduction to that translation. Speaking of the Parsee ceremonies he says: \"I have been astonished myself by the close resemblance which the greater part of these ceremonies bears to the institutions of the Christian Church in the fifth and sixth centuries. However, there is nothing very puzzling in this fact, for the ancient Parsis, as I have had occasion to state before, studied in the Christian schools of Syria and Persia. It was quite natural that they should take an interest in the religious discussions of their teachers and apply the results to their own religion when that was possible. But I scarcely need to tell you, that great as the similarity is in some instances, the difference in others is not less striking.\"\n\nWell, the most important ceremonies of a religious community are the funeral ceremonies. A study of these ceremonies shows, that these ceremonies, as performed, even now, by the modern Parsees, rest on most of the injunctions of the Vendidad and of other parts of the Avesta, which were written long before the Christian era.\n\nIn the 6th volume of the Society we find no paper of special interest to the Parsees. From the Abstracts of the Society's Proceedings as reported in the 6th volume, we gather the following points of interest from a Parsee point of view.\n\nAt the Meeting of 10th September 1857, a letter, dated 18th July 1857, from Mr. J. Romer was read. He sends a copy of an issue of the \"Revue de l'Orient,\" which contains a paper on \"The Pahlavi of the Zend Avesta.\" He assumes that he has sufficiently established the fact that \"it may not be doubted that remains of writings extant in the fifth century, when the Armenian Bishop Essick carried on a religious controversy with the Persian\n\n---\n\n1 Vide Transactions of the Ninth Congress, Vol. II, pp. 528-36.\n2 Vide Asiatic Quarterly Review, July 1903.

How could evil spring from God? How arise without God, and how continue to exist contrary to His will? Such thoughts it was, which, under the reign of Vistaspa, an undoubtedly historical king of Bactria . . . . were agitating one of the mightiest intellects and one of the greatest men of all time\u2014Zarathustra Spitama. Accounted by his contemporaries a blasphemer, atheist, and fire-brand worthy of death; regarded even by his own adherents after some centuries as the founder of magic, by others as a sorcerer and deceiver, he was nevertheless recognized already by Hippocrates as a great spiritual hero, and esteemed the earliest sage of a primeval epoch\u2014reaching back to 5,000 years before their date\u2014by Eudoxus, Plato, and Aristotle. The shallow eighteenth century had already voted him a bygone fanatic or impostor, when a zealous French inquirer, some eighty years ago, set out upon his tracks, and not without success. . . . . . . The key, however, to the understanding of the man and his place in history, we find, as it seems to us, in a hymn consisting of eleven three-lined strophes, having reference to some great public transaction, which was, if we mistake not, no other than that of his first appearance before the assembled magnates of the land, in the character of a reformer. It is a parallel to Luther's ninety-five Theses and his affixing them upon the church door at Wittenberg.\"\n\n1 Journal, B. B., R. A. S., Vol. VI., (1861), Abstract of Proceedings at the end, p.

In the first part the author questioned \"the opinion of W. Schlegel, Sir W. Jones, Richardson, Vans Kennedy and Mr. Romer that the Zend language was fabricated by the Parsis after their emigration from Persia. He maintains that the language did formerly exist in Persia. . . . He observed that, had the language been forged by the modern Parsis, it could scarcely have stood the test when examined by the light of comparative philology.\"\u00b3\n\nIn the second part of the paper, the author \"asserted that the Zend language was independent of the Sanscrit.\" In this paper, he also \"called attention to the Huzvaresh, or proper Pehlvi language.\" \"In conclusion, he stated that he had mainly, if not entirely, indented on the Continental authors of Europe for the support of his arguments, leaving aside the Persian and other national authorities with a view to avoid prejudice.\"\u2074\n\nThis paper has been published in a book form by Mr. Dhunjeebhoy, under the title of \"On the Origin and Authenticity of the Arian Family of Languages, the Zend Avesta and the Huzvaresh, (1861).\"\n\nFrom the Proceedings of the Meetings of the Society, published in the eighth volume of the Journal, we note the following points:\u2014\n\nWe learn from a report\u2075 of the Meeting of 14th July 1864, that Mr. Cowasji Jehangier (afterwards Sir) Cowasji Jehangier Ready-money had generously presented to the Society, works on Oriental Literature of the value of Rs. 5,000. In moving the adoption of the report for the year 1863-64, Dr. Wilson referred to this munificent gift and said: \"The presentation made by Mr. Cowasji Jehangier had done much to supply the immediate wants of the Society in the matter of Oriental Literature as furnished by the press of Europe. Through means of it, the Society was now able to profit by the progress made in Eastern research in many of the countries of the West.\"\u2076\n\n\u00b9 Journal, B. B., R. A. S., Vol. VI, p. XLI.\n\u00b2 Ibid., p. XLVIII.\n\u00b3 Ibid., p. XLVIII.\n\u2074 Ibid., p. XXV.\n\nSir Cowasji Jehangier's Donation of Rs. 5,000.\nThe following words of Dr. Wilson, uttered by him at the above Meeting, are worth quoting, to impress upon the present members of the Society, the necessity of spending a good part of the Society's income upon books of Oriental literature. Dr. Wilson referring to \"the liberal contribution of three hundred Rupees a month lately voted to the Society by Government,\" said: \"This sum would, no doubt, be an important item in the future income of the Society; but it must be borne in mind that it had a special destination. It was not intended to relieve the members from their usual contributions to the support of the library, and the establishment maintained for their own benefit, but for the extension of the labours of the Society in Oriental research. The similar contribution long given to the Asiatic Society in Bengal, was wisely devoted to the publication of the Bibliotheca Indica, a most valuable collection of Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian texts; and we, too, in Bombay, it must be remembered, have a similar work to effect. The publication of Oriental texts proceeds but slowly, and it needs all available help in the West as well as in the East of India.\"\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Frere, the President, \"confirmed what had just been said by Dr. Wilson respecting the objects of the monthly sum granted by Government.\"\n\nIn the address, which the President, the Hon'ble Mr. Frere, delivered at this annual meeting, when he resigned his post, we find the following reference to the election of the first Parsee and the first native as a member of this Society. He said,\n\n\"Those of you, who have been as long connected with the Society as I have been, will recollect the great opposition which was made in the year 1833* to the admission of a native as a member of the Society. It is a good rule of our Society, that no record is ever kept of those who have been proposed as members and black-balled, but it is now a matter of history, that notwithstanding the exertions made by some of the most popular and influential of our members, they signally failed in getting this native admitted into the Society as a member, and it was not until Manockjee Cursetjee had been elected a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, and his friends claimed as a right for him to be admitted a member of this Branch Society, that the door was opened.* All honour be to him for his characteristic perseverance and indomitable courage on this as on all occasions. After he was admitted\u2014the Hon'ble Juggonath Sunkersett, Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, and others soon followed: and good reason we\n\n1 Ibid., p. XXXII. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid., p. XXXIX. 4 In January 1840.\nhave not only to be proud of our native members, but to be grateful to them for the splendid additions they have made to our Library and Museum. To whom are we so much indebted for presents of Books and a large and costly collection of coins as to Cowasji Jehangier Ready-money, Esq., and the Hon'ble Juggonnath Sunkersett; and have not Bal-Gungadhur Shastree, Dr. Bh\u00e2\u00ee Daji and Dhunjeebaee Framjee been large and useful contributors to our Journal. Gifts and contributions, such as these, may well make the Society proud, and grateful to our native members.\"\n\nIt appears, that the President, the Hon'ble Mr. Frere himself, had a great hand in the matter of opening the doors of the Society, at first to Mr. Manockji Cursetjee, and then to other native members, because, in the address presented to him, on 17th March 1865, when the then Governor, Sir B. Frere was present, we read the following words:\u2014\"Above all, we would most gratefully acknowledge your ready and generous appreciation of the desire of native gentlemen to enter and enrich this Society. To this we owe the strength which we derive from a body of fifty native subscribers, and the truly noble benefactions of the Honorable Juggonath Sunkersett and of Messrs. Cowasjee Jehanghier and Premchund Roychund to our Library and Museum. The importance of your appreciation of the native liberality, during the present critical period of the history of Bombay, cannot be too highly estimated.\"\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Frere refers to this point in his reply, and says:\u2014\n\"I may remark, however, that the Society now really, is Asiatic, which it hardly was before, but which I trust it will ever continue to be.\"\n\nWe observed above, that in his address in 1864 the Hon'ble Mr. Frere, the then President, paid due honour to the late Mr. Manockji Cursetji for getting the doors of our Society and its splendid library opened for his native brethren. Forty years after this, on the auspicious occasion of the Centenary of our Society, we may repeat the words of the then President and say \"All honour be to him.\" If I, as his co-religionist, may be permitted to remember his name in the religious language of our ritual, I will say, \"Behdin Manockjee Behdin Cursetjee aider Y\u00e2d b\u00e2d an\u00f4sheh rav\u00e2n rav\u00e2ni,\" i.e., \"May the soul of the immortal-souled Manockjee Cursetjee be remembered here.\"\n\nFrom the Proceedings of the meetings of the Society reported in the 9th volume, we gather the following notes, which may interest a Parsee.\n\nIn the report of the special meeting, held on 17th February 1870,\n\nDr. Wilson on the Parsees and their Literature.\n\nto do honour to Dr. Wilson, who was then going out to Europe for two years, we find Dr. Wilson making the following reference to the Parsees and to the work done by the\n\n1 Ibid., XXXIX.\n2 Ibid., LXXII.\n3 Ibid., LXXIV.\n4 Journal, B. B., R. A. S., Vol. IX, Abstract of Proceedings, pp. CLXVI-CXCIII.\nSociety in the matter of their literature, and to the work begun by them in their study of Iranian literature. He says, \"Sir John Malcolm, in an early address he delivered before this Society, said that in the first instance Bombay must be specially looked to for an elucidation of the ancient Zoroastrian faith.\" This remark was founded on the fact that here we have a considerable body of the descendants of the ancient Persians residing amongst us, who are in possession of the remains of the literature of Ancient Persia, who show most vigorous action in mercantile life, and who, by their union and energy, have done a great deal to advance the cause of general improvement in this country. Our Society has, in regard to this matter, done much that is of great consequence.\n\nMr. William Erskine, in his various learned and valuable papers laid before the Society, produced some remarkable elucidations of the ancient religion of Persia; and (partly in consequence of the papers which he and others furnished), Professor Rask was sent to this country by the King of Denmark, and was successful in obtaining most of those valuable relics of the ancient world which are now in the University Library of Copenhagen. My own discussions with the Parsis, and their rejoinders to some of my publications, followed; and with my subsequent larger work on the Parsi Religion, they attracted attention not only in the religious but literary world. The visit to this country of the distinguished Orientalist Professor Westergaard, about the time of the publication of the last mentioned volume, gave a powerful impetus to the study of the Zoroastrian literature. Both in Bombay, and at Yezd in Persia, he acquired important manuscripts. I had the pleasure, too, of giving him the use of those which by purchase and gift I had acquired in this place, chiefly from the late able and learned Fardunji Meherasb\u00e2ni, from whom, I may mention, Professor Rask had obtained his acquisitions. Those manuscripts, when added to those at Copenhagen, Paris, and in England, gave peculiar aids to Professor Westergaard in preparing and editing his successful critical edition of the text of the Zend-Avasta, for which to him we are so greatly indebted, even in the view of what has been done in the same direction by Dr. Spiegel. The edition of the Vandid\u00e2d, Izashn\u00ea, and Visparad, in the Gujar\u00e2ti character and with a Gujar\u00e2ti translation, lithographed for the Society under my own eye, from a manuscript I procured in Gujar\u00e2t, has enabled Orientalists to become acquainted with the interpretations of the Avasta, long current in Western India. Dr. Haug, in his interesting Essays, and other works published in this city, has ably shown how much these interpretations require to be amended. Though it be admitted that the principles of the Zoroastrian faith and curious matters connected with it are now well understood by\n\n1 Ibid. CLXXXVI-CLXXXVIII.\nmany, much requires to be yet done for the elucidation of the Zend or rather Avast\u0101 language. The analogy or cognate relationship of that language to the Sanskrit, is apparent to every Oriental scholar. From that analogy alone many clauses in the Zoroastrian writings are perfectly intelligible. There are, however, many words in it, which do not appear to be connected with the Sanskrit, at any rate in its classical form. Help to understand their meaning is to be found from the study of the Pehlavi and Persian languages, while the elements of a few of them may be found even in some of the other Iranian, if not Shemitic, and Turanian dialects. I am glad to find such men connected with this Society as my friends Mr. Dhanjibhai and Dastur Peshutan, engaged in studies connected with the ancient literature of Persia. I am so glad to observe that a Zend Madrissa or College has been founded in Bombay by the Jijibhai family. It is an interesting fact connected with it, that it contains some students of the language of the Avast\u0101, who have laid aside the merely traditional interpretations of that collection, and who are looking for the meaning of its obscure texts by references to the cognate languages and other philological appliances. In this, no doubt, they will get important help from the researches of Dr. Haug.\n\nAs observed above, by Dr. Wilson, our Society had at his instance published for the first time lithographed editions of the Gujarati texts and translations of the Vendidad, the Ya\u00e7na and Visparad of the Parsis. When he went to Europe in the end of 1842 or the commencement of 1843, he wrote a letter to the Society, resigning his post as the President of the Society. In that letter he announced, that the Vendid\u0101d was already lithographed, and recommended the publication of the Ya\u00e7na and the Visparad. The Society at its Special General Meeting of 30th December 1842, resolved to get the Ya\u00e7na and the Visparad also lithographed.\n\nWe find from the Proceedings of the monthly meeting of 13th September 1843, that the lithographed copies were for the first time placed on the table of the Society on that day.\n\nIt appears, that in those days, the Society permitted papers to be read before it, that were controversial\u2014controversial not only from a literary point of view, but also from a religious point of view. Not only that, but it accepted dedications of that kind of books; for we find from the above letter of Dr. Wilson, that he presented with it, a copy of his book, which was dedicated to the Society and entitled \"The Parsee Religion as contained in the Zend-Avesta and propounded and defended by the Zoroastrians of India and Persia, unfolded, refuted and contrasted with Christianity.\" The book was, as he himself says in the letter, \"in\n\n---\n\n1 The letter is printed on p. 235 of the 1st vol. and is without date.\n2 The date 30th December shows that the European members of the Society then were very enthusiastic in their work, and met even in the holy week, considering the cause of Literature and Science to be as holy as the cause of religion.\nsome degree controversial.\" Dr. Wilson in the following words in the preface, shows its controversial nature and its ulterior object. He says: \"May it be extensively instrumental in leading the Parsees to embrace the doctrine of salvation, in quickening the prayers and efforts of Christians on their behalf.\"\n\nThe Society even makes a graceful allusion to this book and its presentation in its address presented to him on his resignation. But, perhaps, there was no danger then of having before the meeting subjects that were controversial from a religious point of view, because the doors of the Society were then closed to native members. Mr. Bal Gungadhar Shastri, a well known Hindu scholar, who then contributed many papers to the Journal of the Society, had only to send his papers to the Society, addressed to the Secretary.\n\nThough such repeated controversial papers and writings of Dr. Wilson had, to a great extent, hurt the feelings of the Parsee community at that time, let it be said now, that it were such controversial writings that aroused the Parsees to stand on their defence, and for that purpose, to study, more closely than before, their own religious books. Khan Bahadur Bomonji Byramji Patel in his article \"A Brief Outline of some Controversial Questions that led to the Advancement of the Study of Religious Literature among the Parsis\" in the Cama Memorial Volume refers to this subject, and says: \"The Parsis felt the emergency of a careful research into their religious literature.\" He gives a list of several publications among the Parsees that followed the controversies of those days.\n\nAgain, let it be said, to the credit of Dr. Wilson, that he was always anxious to help the publication of old oriental works, whether they treated of historical or religious subjects. We know, that when those bitter controversies had, later on, cooled down, in the old age of Dr. Wilson, the Dasturs of the Parsee community, who once had bitter feelings against him, looked to him for support, encouragement and help, in the publication of their works. He, at times, used his personal influence in getting them patronage for their publications from the hands of Government. No member of the Society has, during these last 100 years, taken that prominent part in the work of the Society, both directly and indirectly, which Dr. Wilson had taken.\n\n1 Preface, p. 17.\n2 Vide Journal, B.
