The sources of information cannot be too carefully and critically investigated, sifted, analyzed, and tabulated. The feeling of Nirv\u00e1na is hinted at in the Upanishad literature.* It is frequently mentioned in the Br\u00e1hma\u0144ic Pur\u00e1\u1e47as.\u2020 In the\n\n* See for instance the Upanishad (Mundaka III. 2, 6.) where the commentator explains Nirv\u00e1na.\n\u2020 See the Bh\u00e1gavat Pur\u00e1\u1e47a, Vish\u1e47u Pur\u00e1\u1e47a.\nTantra literature it occurs as a concrete fossilised ceremony.* In the Bh\u00e1gavat G\u00edt\u00e1, the scriptures of all the sects of the Hind\u00fas, Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a is the predominant aspiration\u2020 : it is cherished by the present generation of the pious Hind\u00fas; it is a prominent idea in their sacred music.\u2021\n\nThere are two schools of Jainas\u2014the Digambara and Sv\u00e9tambara; both propound a view of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a. The ground-basis of their theology and metaphysics is the same as that of the Buddhists.\u00a7 But they do not carry their doctrines to all their consequences. Rationalistic in their feeling and aspiration, they are to a certain extent conservative in their practices and customs. Their literature || is extensive, intricate, and varied\u2014a literature which throws a great deal of light upon the subject of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a.\n\nNirv\u00e1\u1e47a is a central doctrine of Buddhistic theology and metaphysics. The Buddhistic literature of N\u00e9p\u00e1la, the Tibetan Buddhistic literature, the Burmah Buddhistic literature, the Chinese Buddhistic literature, the Ceylon Buddhistic literature\u2014all these have been opened up to scholars by Brian Hodgson, by Cosmo K\u00f6r\u00f6s, by Bigandet, by Beal and by Hardy.\n\nIndian Buddhism, though extinct as a living system, is still important on account of the writings of the different \u0100ch\u00e1ryas of the different schools. The dicta uttered by the Y\u00f3g\u00e1-ch\u00e1ryas, the Sontrantikas the Vaibh\u00e1sikas, and the\n\n* In the Agni Pur\u00e1\u1e47a this ceremony is described because it is an attempt at an Encyclop\u00e6dia of the Br\u00e1hmanic science, history and philosophy.\n\u2020 See (V. 25. and VI. 15.) of the Bh\u00e1gavat G\u00edt\u00e1.\n\u2021 See an Abhang\u00e1 of Tuk\u00e1ram.\u2014Nirvap\u00edch\u00e1 eka P\u00e1nduranga. See the Prabodha Chandrodaya which describes the doings of Chatainya of Bengala.\n\u00a7 The Jainas recognize karma or eternal activity as the Baudhas do. They discard the notion of god and sacrifice as the Baudhas do. They believe in the eternity of religious truth which they state is revealed from time to time as the Baudhas do. They uphold the doctrine of metempsychosis as the Baudhas do. Both maintain pain to be positive.\n|| There are large Jaina libraries in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and in some towns of the Karnatic.\nM\u00e1dhyamikas are found scattered in the polemical literature of the Br\u00e1hma\u1e47as, such as the writings of Kum\u00e1rla Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da.*\n\nThough the researches of eminent scholars have accomplished much in elucidating the subject of Buddhistic Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a, yet the water sheds of Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic, Jaina, and Buddhistic literature are not reached and investigated. What is known is, however, sufficient to show the series of transformations the doctrine of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a has passed through between 1,000 B.C. (the time of the Upanishad literature), and 1,200 A.D. (the time of Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic and Jaina revival.)\n\nII. A position stated.\u2014A doctrine like that of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a, accepted and acted upon by the masses of people in different countries of the world, is not a mere accident; it is a growth determined by the environment of those who maintain the doctrine\u2014an environment involving historical conditions and circumstances, and originating in a many-sided revolution. Buddhism is a popular revolt against the exclusive \u00c1ryan conquerors. It is a rebellion of the proleteriat against the upper classes. It is the polity of absorption determined to upset the polity of exclusion. It is the masses (Sangha) in opposition to the upper classes (Udgha). It is a socialistic movement against the hereditary aristocracy of ancient India and its prior rights. The sequel will elucidate and support this view of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a.\n\nIII. Summary of the differences between the Buddhists and V\u00e9dists.\u2014There were conservative and liberal \u00c1ryas\u2020; the former attempted to exclude half-castes from their schools: the latter encouraged them to learn and gave them instruction\u2021. The Sangha or a class\u2014consisting of the \u00c1ryanized non-\u00c1ryas, half-castes and degenerated \u00c1ryas\u2014was distinguished from the higher classes or genuine \u00c1ryas \u00a7. The leaders of the Sangha gradually grew in intelligence and pressed forward, claiming\n\n* See M\u00e1dhava S\u00e1yana's Sarva Darsana Sangraha, which offers a summary of their doctrines.\n\n\u2020 The P\u00farva Mim\u00e1s\u00e1 (VI. 1. 26, 27.)\n\u2021 Ch\u00e1ndogya Upanishad (IV. 4. 1.)\n\u00a7 P\u00e1nini's Sutras (III. 3. 96.)\nadmission into the Aryan polity. The Nish\u00e1ds* declared that they could perform sacrifices as the A'ryas did. Sacrifice was the soul of all Aryan thought, feeling and activity; and none but the genuine A'ryas could perform it.\u2020 The learned A'ryas either favoured or opposed the Nish\u00e1ds; there were thus philo-Nish\u00e1ds and anti-Nish\u00e1ds. The conservative A'ryas restricted or sought to restrict the rights of women,\u2021 declaring that they could not possess property of their own, that they could not learn in schools, that they could not live independently of the joint-family. The A'ryan laws bore hard on the non-A'ryas, and on the half-castes \u00a7; even a distinctive costume was prescribed.\u2016 Impressed with the conviction that the A'ryan gods were powerful and prompt in granting prayers, and that A'ryan institutions conferred superiority and contributed to comforts of this life, the Sangha naturally desired to adopt the forms and modes of A'ryan worship, to live as the A'ryas lived, and to enjoy themselves as the A'ryas did.\u00b6 They were systematically suppressed; and the Sangha was agitated. Vexed and alienated by the superciliousness of Br\u00e1hmans priests, the Kshatriyas dissented, and condemned the V\u00e9dic polity of exclusion.** Some of the Vai\u015byas necessarily sympathised with the Kshatriya princes.\u2020\u2020 The Sangha persisted in asserting their rights, but failed in securing them. The conflict between the genuine A'ryas and the Sangha terminated in a revolution. Buddhism came.\n\n---\n\n* The P\u00farva M\u00edm\u00e1\u1e43s\u00e1 (VI. 1, 51.) and the K\u00e1l\u012bya Shrouta S\u00fatra (I. 1, 12.)\n\u2020 The Taittir\u012bya Br\u00e1hmans (I. 2, 1, 26.)\n\u2021 The P\u00farva M\u00edm\u00e1\u1e43s\u00e1 (VI. 1, 6 and 8.)\n\u00a7 The Upakri\u1e63\u1e6da and the Rathak\u00e1ra.\n\u2016 The costumes of the Br\u00e1hmans and Kshatriyas are definitely described.

The platforms of the polities of exclusion and absorption or the Vedic and Buddhistic polities.\u2014The doctrine of worldliness was systematized. It was distinctly stated that the duties of man\u2014or rather Aryan man\u2014were to live in happiness here and hereafter; but perfect liberty to do as one pleased was not sanctioned. The Veda was recognised as a code\u2020 of ethical, social, and political conduct\u2014the eternal Vedas.\u2021 Truthfulness as among the Aryas themselves was recognized as a binding and paramount duty.\u00a7 Worldly happiness was identified with heaven; and worldly happiness in its variety could be secured, they believed, by performing duly their sacrifices in conformity with the Veda.|| Gods like Indra or Mitra favoured their exclusive privileges, and it was a special privilege of the Aryas to lord it over the whole world and specially over the non-Aryas.\u00b6 The reformers made a new departure: they condemned worldliness, and opposed to it spirituality: ** they condemned exclusion and opposed to it universal benevolence; they condemned sacrifice and its arrogant superiority and opposed to it spiritual contrition of the heart; they condemned caste and opposed to it universal brotherhood: the schools were opened to all who sought instruction. A distinction was made between individuality, local in its grasp and earthly in its aspirations, and universality, disclosing transcending views, and inspiring by its deep spirituality. This is the first view of Nirvana\u2014a condition of positive spiritual bliss as distinguished from worldly happiness or temporal power or secular privileges. The Vedic sacrifice pre-supposed worldly prosperity and encouraged secularity.\u2020\u2020 The Vedic Arya sought happiness by acting on external nature and his surroundings. The reformer or the Arya of the\n\n* The Purva Mimamsa (VI. 1, 1.3.)\n\u2020 Id. (I. 1, 2.)\n\u2021 Id. See the discussion in (I.)\n\u00a7 This is inculcated or was interpreted from Tai. S. (II., 5, 5, 6.)\n|| The Purva Mimamsa system.\n\u00b6 See the Aitareya Brahmana (IV. 3. and VII. 29.)\n** The Upanishads teem with utterances in support of these statements.\n\u2020\u2020 The Purva Mimamsa (VI. 1, 10.)\nUpanishads sought spiritual bliss by controlling his passions, and checking his aspirations.* The one felt that bliss, repose, or tranquility was not in the objects he sought\u2014it was objective: the Acharya of the Upanishad period felt that tranquility was in himself\u2014it was subjective. The first is systematized in the P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophy: the last in the Y\u014dga doctrine.\n\nV. The cardinal principle of Y\u014dga and the cardinal doctrine of Gautama Buddha.\u2014\u201cOh! man, control thyself\u201d was the principle which Buddha emphatically propounded and inculcated on his followers.\u2020 The Y\u014dga starts and ends with this same statement.\u2021 Nibbuti is thus opposed to Pabatti: attachment to life and its pleasures was opposed to asceticism. This is the first view of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014the view of moderate reforming A'ch\u0101ryas who, still revering the Vedic polity, aspired beyond it. Their utterances seek to reconcile sacrifices with spirituality, exclusion with absorption. Influenced by the narrowminded, but glorious, past, they rose superior to themselves, and, ascetically disposed and spiritually moved, looked into a future of universal benevolence.\u00a7\n\nVI. The Naimisya forest and its ascetics.\u2014Either prevented from living in towns or determined to enjoy his ecstatic trance in the solitude of the wilds, the Kshatriya philosopher or the \u015audra, fired with spiritual aspirations, retired into the Naimisya forest, and passed his life there, meditating on the essence of all he saw in external nature or of all he felt within himself. He characterized this conduct as Departure or Pravrajya. He earnestly sought the noumenon which underlies and constitutes all phenomena or tatva. Various were the conjectures of such philosophers and ascetics. Some fixed upon air || as\n\n* The Brihat Aranyak Upanishad.\n\u2020 Compare Vi\u00f1\u00f1apassa Nirodhena etth' etam uparajjhadi\u2014a dictum of Buddha Gautama and Yogastu Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha\u2014the Y\u014dga S\u016btra (I. 2.)\n\u2021 This is the spirit of the Upanishad literature. The distinction between Par\u0101 and Apar\u0101 Vidya deserves attention (Murd. I. I. 5.) See again the Mundaka Upanishad (I 2. 2.)\n|| Samyarga Vidya Chh\u0101ndogya Upanishad (IV. 8, 1.)\nthe essence of all existence: others resolved matter and mind into light. Some analyzed life, its conditions and circumstances into a spirit in which they lived and moved: others referred their life and its phenomena to spiritual or meditational warmth. Whatever any of these thinkers fixed upon as the ultimate analytical unit or essence, they all agreed in condemning the Vedic polity which sanctioned animal sacrifices, and inculcated that worldliness itself was the last goal of all human aspirations. Ahims\u0101 (recognition of all animal life being sacred) was the cardinal point of their belief; but they did not in a wholesale manner condemn the past. The Vedic polity with its devotion to caste, to sacrifice, and to the prior rights which they secured was adjudged to be inferior to the new philosophy,* the result of the new departure taken by these reforms. If sacrifice deserved attention and recognition, it deserved attention, because it led to contemplation of the essence of all intellectual, moral and physical phenomena.\u2020 A systematic attempt was made to interpret anew the utterances of the Rishis known as Mantra, and many Mantras were spiritualized away: worldliness was interpreted into spirituality. Women were freely taught: G\u0101rg\u012b and Maitreyi discoursed on metaphysical subjects with their distinguished husband Yajna\u00f1alkya. Young men of doubtful birth were initiated into the mysteries of the new philosophy. Thus the land-marks of the Vedic polity were washed off. Aspiration after a new philosophy, earnest spirituality, a spirit of adjustment, new interpretation, a liberality of spirit with which caste and all prior rights were incompatible, distinguished these reformers. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a at this time signified identity and absorption into the unlocalized, universal, subtle essence which pervades all phenomena. A teacher points this out to a pupil:\u2014\"That thou art, Somija\u2021, that spirit which moves the air, from whose fear the sun regularly shines, and to which death itself is obedient.\"\u00a7 Attached to the Vedic polity,\n\n* Distinction between Para and Apara Vidya (Munq. 1.1.5.)\n\u2020 Adhi Daivam &c.

See the Br\u0101hma Vidy\u0101 Upanishad (VIII.)\nand venerating it, these reformers did not violently denounce it. A modesty* which earnest enquiry generates, and a love of truth\u2020 which results from spiritual emancipation, characterized the period. The Brahnav\u00e1dins or V\u00e9dic teachers often explained a four-fold salvation,\u2014(i) dwelling in the same place with a god like Indra,\u2014(ii) dwelling near him,\u2014(iii) obtaining his dignity and form,\u2014(iv) identity with him.\u2021 The last was only materially understood by the V\u00e9dic teachers. These reformers or ascetics gave a spiritual interpretation to it and insisted upon final absorption into the spiritual essence as emancipation or salvation. This is the back-ground of Buddhistic Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a.\n\nVII. The Jainas or conservative rationalists.\u2014The Jainas divided into two classes\u2014the Svetambara and the Digambara, or those wearing white clothes and those who go about naked\u2014are to be found in all parts of India. There are about 2,000 of them in the city of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d alone in Gujar\u00e1t. In this place I cannot discuss the chronology of the Jaina movement, and state the grounds of my belief that the Jainas preceded the Buddhists. The position of the Upanishad reformer was formulated and pressed on the attention of the V\u00e9dic \u00c1ryas. The conservative sacrificing \u00c1ryas attempted coercion. Anathemas were pronounced: prayers, offered. The reformers, aspiring after deep spirituality and communion with the all-pervading spirit, were stigmatized as lethargic and their doctrine was declared to be \u201cthe path of inactivity.\u201d The sacrificing \u00c1rya publicly prayed:\u2014\u201cOh! let my lethargy, or rather my tendency to (moral) sleep, depart to the natives of Vidhea or to contemplative inactive men.\u00a7 In the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata the condition of society is feelingly depicted. Bh\u00edshma despondingly observes:\u2014\u201cNone knows what the truth is. To advance their own interests, selfish men preach to the people what they please.\u201d|| The Vaisyas, little accustomed to think for themselves and disposed\n\n* See the story of Nachiketas.

They, therefore, fell victims to scepticism. Their leaders stigmatized their views and stated their grounds. The logic of scepticism \u2020 was thus developed and it would be elucidated by a contrast between the views of the Upanishad reformer and those of the Jaina. The one merely adjusted the importance of a sacrifice and connived at the slaughter of animals; the other was fired by enthusiasm of life\u2014he strongly condemned the slaughter of any animal for any purpose. To the one Vedic lore, though a dispensation old and inferior, yet was important as the means of his superior wisdom; the other discarded all notion of revelation. The one believed that an abstract essence\u2014a generality, was real, eternal, and could be cognized; the other declared that a generality was only a kind of knowledge, and its notion was derived from the knowledge of particular facts. The one aspired after absorption into the eternal, all-pervading essence; the other aspired after maintaining his individuality \u2021 through eternity. The one believed that all phenomena are only transient and are ultimately to be resolved into Br\u0101hma; the other believed that they are real and eternally abide. The one thought that the universe is either created by or emanated from the Supreme Person; the other discarded all notion of a personal creator. The one was definite in his statements and did resort to the utterances of the Rishis and attempted to interpret them anew to support his views; the other more or less hesitated, but declared that virtue eternally abideth, and that it is revealable by eminent teachers.\n\n* Louk\u0101yatika or Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka as popularly known.\n\n\u2020 This is called Sy\u0101d v\u0101da. It states:\u2014Perhaps a thing is\u2014perhaps it is not. Perhaps in sequence of time it is and it is not. Perhaps at once it is and it is not,\u2014this cannot be stated. Perhaps it is and cannot be stated\u2014perhaps it is not, and cannot be stated. Perhaps in sequence of time it is, and it is not, and cannot be at once stated.\n\n\u2021 This view that every individual object has a spirit is met with in the Zendavesta in its chapter on Farohars.\nEqually repelled by the Vedic polity, the reformer and the Jaina rose superior to mere materialism of the Brahmavadin, and sympathised with higher spiritual aspirations and virtue as distinguished from mere ritualism. Philosophically sceptic the Jaina was practically conservative; rationalistic in his method and aspirations, he adhered to his caste and believed in the philosophy of metempsychosis which the Vedic thinkers had developed. The reformer and the Jaina condemned this life as a perpetual source of pain and misery and aspired after emancipation or Nivritti, consisting in the eternal enjoyment of positive happiness and in escaping the transmigration of soul from life to life\u2014the inevitable consequence of all activity.\n\nVIII. The philosophical plerus.\u2014The activity of the Jainas paved the way of the radical rationalists or Buddhists. The ground-basis of the doctrine of emancipation as propounded by the Upanishad reformer or Vedantist, by the Jaina or the conservative rationalist, and by the Buddhist or radical rationalist is the same, because the same cause originated these movements\u2014the opposition to the conquering supercilious Vedic Aryas, their sacrificial exclusiveness, their prior rights, and their all-engrossing worldliness, and materialism. The Vedantist, the Jaina and the Buddhist are all world-weary, and seek the cessation of all activity, and its fruit\u2014the transmigration of soul. Activity or Karma is a potent cause. It is eternal: it is accumulated: it adheres to the human spirit: it produces all phenomena: it abides in the peri-spirit or the semi-material body which it gathers about itself. It is either increased or decreased in one life. As soon as the body decays, and is destroyed it leaves it and takes another body. This activity or Karma is a subtle entity. It is the cause of all human suffering: so long as a particle of this activity remains, there will be to that extent human misery. Separation from it is salvation. Thus human activity, human misery, inseparable from it, and its consequence\u2014metempsychosis, explain all phenomena of human life and of its environment. The practice of virtue, the power of contemplation to nullify the habit of belief in material and corporeal existence, and self-abnegation\u2014these are the remedies\nfor escaping from the trammels of all activity. Thus the Y\u00f3ga philosophy is developed\u2014the philosophy of contemplation or Dhy\u00e1na. I cannot explain in this place its different stages, the progress made from one stage to another, the amount of self-abnegation and power over the self secured, and the knowledge or the intellectual light it generates. The material body is gradually left behind, and the Y\u00f3gi lives a spirit above all worldliness, above the power of the flesh, free from all power of activity, working miracles and enjoying spiritual beatitude. Activity or rather a tendency to it is the disturbing cause\u2014Up\u00e1dhi. Until a Y\u00f3gi is completely emancipated, he is in danger of getting into its meshes. Annihilation of all Up\u00e1dhi is complete emancipation. Upon this ground-basis, all V\u00e9d\u00e1ntism, Jainism, or Buddhism are built. But the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist seeks emancipation from all activity, and practises contemplation and self-abnegation, that the spirit encased in a material body and subject to the power of activity may re-unite with itself in its universality, and being once more unlocalized and universalized, enjoy perfect happiness. The Jaina seeks the emancipation of his individual spirit by the same means and for the same purpose; but he believes that the human spirit maintains its individuality and enjoys happiness for eternity. The Buddhist believes in the power of activity, dreads metempsychosis, practises contemplation and self-abnegation and aspires after emancipation, and yet differs from both the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina materially. His notion of Nirv\u00e1na will be elucidated by that of the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist or Jaina.\n\nIX. The radical rationalist or Buddhist.\u2014The Buddhist differed both from the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina, and made a new departure. The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist developed into an isoteric school and moved forward on the lines of the V\u00e9dic polity, aspiring after being absorbed into a noumenal essence. The Jaina believed in the individuality of the spirit, and had recourse to acts of charity and faith\u2014a situation into which his logic of scepticism landed him. The Buddhist succeeded in organizing a national movement. His activity accomplished a moral-force revolution which subverted the V\u00e9dic polity itself.\nX. The Buddhistic method.\u2014The V\u00e9dic A'ch\u00e1ryas like \u00c1'sval\u00e1yana, P\u00e1\u00f1ini and others, had developed and stated the definition method. Jaimini and Patanjali had developed exegetical logic, stated and applied it. The Jaina had sceptically argued. The definition-method, the exegetical logic and the logic of scepticism paved the way of analytic logic which the Buddhist preferred. He was, therefore, called the analytic reasoner.* A persistent attempt at analysing, classifying, and defining knowledge was made.\n\nXI. Its result.\u2014The Buddhist perceived that the human will was the ultimate analytic unit beyond which he could not proceed. The will was the noumenon from which all he said, thought, and felt was developed. This was the Chitta manas, or Ch\u00e9tas.\u2020 The disparity of human destiny and conditions of human life were explained by the action of accumulated activity or Karma. His realistic analytical reasoning recognized the ideality of knowledge as determined by realistic activity. This will, modified and acted on by Karma or activity or merit, was the basis of which all else was a phase\u2014a quality. But the will \u2021 acted on by activity invariably resulted in pain real and cognizable as such. Activity called into existence the will, and modified it. Its modifications are manifold, varied and subtle. The forms of human life and of phenomenal existence were considered to be so many phases of the human will acted on by activity and were not real. Emancipation from misery, the inseparable result of all activity acting on and modifying the will by externalizing it, was the summum bonum. The Buddhist discarded the reality and individuality of the human will and of the external noumenal essence.\n\n* Vibhajya V\u00e1di.\n\n\u2020 The opening lines of Dhammapada, when interpreted from this standpoint, are adequately and consistently adjusted. \"Man\u00f3pubbanga\u1e41i Dhamma\" is a phrase which is not adequately comprehended by those who have attempted to explain it, because they have not carefully examined the antecedents of Buddhism.\n\n\u2021 The Abhidhamma\u2014the metaphysical portion of the Tipitaka recognizes and states Chitta, Ch\u00e9tasika, R\u00fapa, and Nibb\u00e1na.\nXII. The determining causes; the Buddhistic stand-point stated.\u2014The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist aspired after the eternal noumenal essence, and submitted to the V\u00e9dic polity with its caste, and prior rights, though he sought to interpret the V\u00e9dic code as liberally * as he could. The Jaina recognised the reality and individuality of the human spirit, the basis of his logic of scepticism. His inactivity and his conservatism, the Buddhist necessarily out grew. Absorbed in profound thought, impelled by introspection, he feelingly believed, and assiduously taught. His view of the human will and of phenomenal existence was thoroughly analytic and the stand-points of the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina determined his view. The gross feeling or K\u00e1ma was distinct from form, and form was distinct from the ideal existence of form but not free from action or Kriy\u00e1. Beyond this was the life of contemplation, of introspection, of deep absorption, of all freedom from externalization gross or subtle. This is the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara, the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara, Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara, and L\u00f3kuttara, forms of life. In the last there is no action whatever, no Kriy\u00e1 chitt\u00e1ni, but the Vip\u00e1ka chitt\u00e1ni are playful, the Chitta or the will as acted on by itself. \u2020 To sum up, all gross and pure action and bustle \u2021 in the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara life; pure for mal action, but no bustle in the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara life,\u2014abstract ideal action in the Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara life; but peace and inaction are the exclusive privileges of L\u00f3kuttara life.\n\nXIII. The ground basis of Buddhism or the A'riya-sachchas, and the Indian system of Y\u00f3ga.\u2014(1) Dukkha sachcham, or suffering in its variety; (2) Samudaya sachcham, or all life as a development of different analytic conditions; (3) Dukkha nirodha, or suppression of all thought and feeling of suffering; and (4) final emancipation.\u00a7 Utt\u00e1na (Vyuut\u00e1na) or Pavatti (Pravritti) or gross life of mere externalization is common to\n\n* See the Story of J\u00e1b\u00f3la in the Chh\u00e1ndogya Upanishad, 4.\n\u2020 See the 1st Parichcheda of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha.\n\u2021 The term Utt\u00e1nam (Vyuut\u00e1nam in Sanskrit) characteristically expressed this. Y\u00f3ga was the latter term. Pavatti (Pravritti in Sanskrit) is another term.\n\u00a7 See the 9th Parichcheda of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha.\nboth Buddhism and Y\u00f3ga. Both recognize that suffering (Kl\u00e9sha) is the inevitable destiny of humanity, a destiny intensified by the elaborate system of metempsychosis, both state that the Chitta or the heart, the intellect and will\u2014combined and forming one unit\u2014is constantly acted on and modified by activity, and a tendency to externalization, and this is the cause of all suffering. Both proclaim aloud that the suppression of this tendency is the means of happiness.* The means of accomplishing this suppression are identical in both, intense contemplation\u2020 which ends in producing a vision or higher knowledge.\u2021\n\nThe great point of difference is, the human will is the last unit recognized by the Buddhist, and beyond it he does not go. His notion of the human will corresponds to that of Y\u00f3ga; but Y\u00f3ga sees behind the human will a spirit which is essentially identical with the all pervading spirit, but which is enthralled and encased in the human body. This is the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist view. The Jaina rejected it and declared the independent individuality of the human spirit, ever independent and ever existing by itself. The Buddhist rejected both as noncognizable by his intense and profound introspection. He knew he saw (R\u00fapa); he knew he perceived (V\u00e9dan\u00e1); he knew he reflected (Sa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1); he knew his mind was acted on by itself, and its activities, and that which its merits and demerits attached to it (Sankh\u00e1ra); he knew he rose superior to all this, and absorbed in contemplation, realised a tranquility and a profundity of feeling (Vi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na). Beyond this, \u00a7 in the realm of infinity of knowledge or intellection, he lives, preparing for entering the stream of the great paths. When in this condition, he is above all\n\n* Notice and compare the following\u2014Yogachitta Vritti Niradhah\u2014the second S\u00fatra of the Y\u00f3ga Philosophy. (explained in my \"Studies in Indian Philosophy.\") and the utterance of Buddha Gotama, \"etassa nirodhana idha' etam nirujjhati.\"\n\n\u2020 Sam\u00e1dhi or Jh\u00e1na. The Buddhist has elaborated this by his analytic reasoning. The Y\u00f3ga simply states it.\n\n\u2021 Compare Sam\u00e1patti in both, and the \u00d1aga Dassana S\u00e1ma\u00f1\u00f1a phala, Vipassan\u00e1 Dibbachakkhu of the Buddhist with Ritambh\u00e1ra Praj\u00f1\u00e1 of the Y\u00f3ga.\n\n\u00a7 A'k\u00e1sana\u00f1ch\u00e1yatana; Vi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na\u00f1ch\u00e1yatana; \u00c1 kincha\u00f1\u00f1ayatana; Neva-sa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na\u00f1ch\u00e1yatana.\nform: he is conversant with nothing but abstract knowledge; his will is, however, affected and works.* His five-fold combination falls to pieces and ceases to exist when he enters the four paths. His intense contemplation and introspection failed him when he attempted to soar higher than this. Nor did he see the necessity of going beyond this. The tendency to externalization inseparable from the will so liable to be affected by external and internal influences, being destroyed, that on which Kamma can act, is destroyed. If nothing beyond the Chitta or the human will or heart in its five Skandhas existed or could be realised, then nothing in the form of noumenal essence would be thought of. The Buddhist began with introspection and ended with it.\n\nXIV. Buddhistic attitude towards the Vedic, Vedantist, and Jaina systems.\u2014He hates the Vedic polity, its pantheon, its hierarchy, its exclusiveness, and its prior rights. To him the Vedantist goes only half the way, and the Jaina is wrong, and is not able to contemplate and introspect. The Vedic polity recognizes the independent eternal individuality of the hun spirit. It is the basis of the Purva Mimansa philosophy. Onjulomi had stated it long before Jaimini. The Jaina follows the Vedic polity in this, but the Buddhist rejects it, land him in all the absurdities of ritualism and ca as he conceives it. The Vedantist recognised eternal noumenal essence consisting in eternal existence joined to intelligence and happiness.\u2020 When introspection unlocalized and universalized his inner self or the Chitta, he found himself plunged in nothingness immeasurably expanding on all side upavachara in all thought, and growing into an infinitude of affinity, eternity,\n\nXV. Upadisea Nibbana.\u2014The peri-sit contemplation, it is existence, energises and externalises so long behind, and all Karma exists. The tendency is annihilated. Existence\u2014vanquished, when a Buddhist has risen su-the formless, the\n\n* Mark the Vipakchitta and Kriyachitta as he localized is what dhamma.\n\u2020 Sachehidananda. This is the watch-word as it is indulged. It is based on utterances in the Upanishads.\nWhen in this condition a Buddhist is J\u012bvan Mukta, one who is emancipated while living, he is Bh\u0101vit \u0100tm\u0101n, one who is unlocalized and universalised. He has yet, however, to live for some time and his accumulated activity is to be consumed by dint of mere living. When the accumulated activity is thus exhausted, he is completely emancipated when he dies, i.e., when his peri-spirit (the P\u0101\u00f1chaskandhas) fall to pieces, and when it can no longer act. The first condition is characterised as Up\u0101dis\u0113sa Nibb\u0101nam. A Buddhist is an Arhat. He is in the fourth Rath. He is a perfect Y\u014dg\u012b. He can perform miracles. He lives in a condition of beatitude. He lives on the earth merely to live out his last portion of earthly existence. The last condition\u2014the condition of an Arhat after his death is characterised as Anup\u0101dis\u0113sa Nibb\u0101nam. The Y\u014dga system of Indian philosophy throws a flood of light on this view of Nibb\u0101na. A perfect Y\u014dg\u012b ecstatically declares he has only to pass a few days of his last earthly existence in sportiveness. \"Emancipation is my wedded spouse.\" *\n\nXVI. Anup\u0101dis\u0113sa Nibb\u0101na.\u2014Perfect Nibb\u0101na is characterised in the following way by the Buddhists:\u2014\"A condition (Padam) permanent (Achchutam), infinite (Achchautam), unconditioned (Asankhatam), highest (Anuttaram)\u2014Nibb\u0101nam this say the great sages (Mahesayo) who are delivered from all desire (V\u0101namukt\u0101).\" \u2020 I attach some importance to the term Viharati \u2021 \"lives in sportiveness\" used in the Mah\u0101nibb\u0101na Sutta. \"Again a Y\u014dg\u012b free from desire, from the sight of lead... sees the Sankh\u0101ra as nihil; (sees) the Skandhayata\u2014of the great pa\u1e6d\u1e6da as nihil (both) spiritually and materially; distinctly as infinite (An\u0101laya) and known by\n\n* Notice and compare (A'k\u0101sa) and of the law of Buddha second S\u016btra of the Y\u014dga Philosophy.\") and the emancipation is the result of the extinction of etam nirujjhati.\"\n\n\u2020 Sam\u0101dhi or Jh\u0101na Tuk\u0101rama.\n\n\u2021 Compare Sam\u0101p\u0101tter's edition.\n\nVipassan\u0101 Dibbacakkhu \u00a7 a Chap. XIII.\n\n\u00a7 Ak\u0101san\u0101ch\u0101yatan\u0113 by Madhav S\u0101yana, a scholiast and an author-Neva\u1e47\u1e47\u0101nasa\u1e47\u1e47\u0101yatana. his Sarva Dar\u015bana Sa\u1e45graha\u2014Buddha Dar\u015bana.\nthus brought together the views of Indian and Ceylonese Buddhists, and attempted to throw a side-light upon it from Sanskrit literature.\n\nXVII. Perfect Nirv\u0101\u1e47a stated.\u2014It is a negation of all that man, thinks, feels, and wills. So far it is nihilism. It is a negation of all suffering which results from thought, feeling and volition. So far it is nihilism. But suffering according to a Buddhist, a Jaina, or a V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist is a positive entity. Happiness he does not recognize as positive. Suffering (Dukkha) is positive and results from localized existence. Both localized existence and suffering are destroyed together. When this is accomplished, unlocalized universalization is emancipation, co-extensive with happiness itself. Suffering is the inevitable result of all localization: happiness\u2014of all universalization. Hence Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is both negative and positive. It is not nihilism. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is beyond all localization. This is what all the Buddhists state. Reasoning on the basis of introspection alone, and observing the facts as they develop in the inner man, they stated that there are different degrees of localization. Infinity itself, as conceived by man, is localized. Eternity as conceived by man is localized. Hence persistent efforts were made by Buddhists so to soar in contemplation as to rise higher than all conception itself, as to leave behind all thought, feeling, and volition. In the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara all is gross, material, involved in a multiplicity of all that is \"frail and feverish;\" above it is the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara, the region of Gods and Divinities. Form is localized, and what is grosser and more material than form is dropped. Beyond the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara is the Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara in which form itself is dropped, i.e., left behind. Infinity, eternity, is contemplated. But being the subject of contemplation, it is localized. In the four paths all this is left behind, and all tendency to localization is checked, i.e., destroyed. Existence\u2014substance\u2014that which is the nameless, the formless, the eternal, the infinite, the permanent, the unconditioned has a tendency to be localized. This tendency to be localized is what is called activity or Karma. It is strengthened as it is indulged. The tendency localizes the universal and Panchaskandhas result.\nThen there is immediately thought, feeling and volition which are inseparable from suffering. Buddhism does not attempt to state the properties or attributes of the unlocalized\u2014the eternal\u2014because no matter how carefully a statement is made, the fact of statement will localize it. It is, therefore, beyond all statement. It is enough to say\u2014it is Nirvana.\n\nXVIII. Conclusion.\u2014Buddhism is an interesting study, scientifically, philosophically, religiously, socially, and politically. Scientifically, because science seeks the unification of force and the elements which embody all force; philosophically, because Buddhism discovers to what the psychological method of introspection leads; religiously, because when there are so many Buddhists in the world, not believing in a personal God\u2014and not yearning to worship Him the fact of religious instincts of man calls for re-examination and re-statement; socially, because it ignores all ritualism, ceremonies, and social life in its amplitude and minutude, in its materialism and its subtility of love, and ambition; and politically, because the convent of the Buddhists subverted the Vedic polity of caste, sacrifice and prior rights, and justified the aspirations of a proletariat and placed them on a legitimate basis for the first time in the history of man.\nTWO SINHALESE INSCRIPTIONS.\n\nBY B.

The following extract from the Paper appeared in the Ceylon Times of June 11th, 1873:\u2014\n\n\"This inscription, is to be found on a rock on the site of an ancient Buddhist Temple near Kott\u00e9, where from A.D. 1410 to A.D. 1542 Sinhalese Kings held Court.\n\n\"No part of the ancient buildings of the Temple now remain, having been, it is said, levelled to the ground, by the Portuguese who destroyed this and other buildings in and near Kott\u00e9.\n\n\"My copy of the inscription was taken from one in the possession of a Buddhist Priest who now occupies the modern Pansala built on the supposed site of the ancient Temple, and I was informed by him that his teacher's teacher obtained it some 70 or 80 years ago, from a transcript preserved in the\n\n\\[a \\text{ \u0930\u094b\u091c\u093c } b \\text{ \u092c\u093e\u0932\u094d\u0915 } c \\text{ \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941 } d \\text{ \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e } e \\text{ \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u0947\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 } f \\text{ \u0913\u092e\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 } g \\text{ \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941 } h \\text{ \u0913\u092e\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 } i \\text{ \u0905\u0939 }\\]\nArchives of the late King of Kandy. There can be no question however, as to its genuineness. I have compared it with such parts of the stone as still remain, and have found that it exactly corresponds with the stone. The style and matter too of the inscription furnish indisputable evidence of its genuineness and authenticity.\n\n\"The inscription records the erection and endowment of a Buddhist Temple in memory of his deceased mother Sun\u00e9tra Mah\u00e1 D\u00e9vi, by King Sri Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI., who reigned at K\u00f3tt\u00e9 (according to Turnour) from A.D. 1410 to 1462. It also contains a variety of provisions for the due maintenance of the temple; for the expenditure of its income; and regulations for the observance of the clerical and lay members of the establishment.\n\n\"The style of the inscription is similar to that of other writings of the 14th or 15th centuries; and Mr. Alwis has published in his Introduction to the Sidat Sangar\u00e1d, the introductory paragraph of the inscription as a specimen of the prose of that age. The construction of the sentences, however, is very peculiar. The whole of the inscription, which is a very long one, is conglomerated, as it were, into one sentence by means of conjunctive particles and participles, having apparently only one finite verb expressed. The words in general are those in modern use, with a very few exceptions which I have noticed in the notes.\"\n\"The date assigned to the King's accession is stated to have taken place in the year of Buddha 1958 (A.D. 1415), whereas Turnour in his adjustment of Sinhalese Chronology, computed from native records, has fixed the date at 1953 (A.D. 1410) five years earlier. The authority of the stone however, cannot be disputed, and it is in a remarkable manner confirmed by the well known contemporary poem Aryasakha, the author of which was the most learned monk of the age, and according to tradition, the King's adopted son.\n\n\"The regulations enacted for the management of the Temple establishment and for the distribution of its income are also very curious, and throw considerable light on the manners, customs, and social condition of the Island at the period in question. It shows that the form of Sinhalese letters now in use have not undergone any material change, during, at least, the last five or six hundred years, with the exception of a few.\n\n\"It is believed by many that the worship of Hindu Gods, and the practice of Hindu rites and ceremonies, were introduced into Ceylon by the last Malabar King who obtained the throne of Kandy, after the extinction of the Sinhalese Royal Family about the year A.D. 1739; but it would appear from the inscription that the innovation is of much earlier date. The King it is well-known was an eminent patron of Buddhism, having built four Dev\u00e1las in connection with the Vih\u00e1ra.\"\u2014Hon.

Gunatilaka, Esq.\n\n(Read, September 14th, 1882.)\n\nVery great interest and importance attach to the folk-lore of any nation, as is evidenced by the labors bestowed on the subject by eminent writers, and the manner in which those labors have been appreciated. The tales of a people once collected and recorded afford material alike for the ethnologist, the philologist and the historian to build upon, and enable them to arrive at truths previously unknown, and to throw fresh light upon theories which are but partially established. It is not the amusement which the tales and stories afford that makes them valuable but it is the great truths which they point to in the field of literature and science that commend them to our notice and study. Readers who wish to have some idea of the importance of folk-lore to ethnology and its cognate sciences, will find the subject fully treated in the \"Chips from a German workshop\" of Max M\u00fcller, and in the introduction to the \"Popular Tales from the Norse\" of Mr. Dasent.\n\nWhile different writers have labored in the work of collecting tales in other countries, while each successive number of the \"Indian Antiquary\" presents to us the folk-lore of the Panjab and other parts of India, it is a matter both of regret and surprise that no writer in Ceylon has, so far as I am aware, yet begun to work in a systematic manner in collecting the folk-lore of this Island.\n\n* I was requested by the Honorary Secretary of this Society, about a month ago, to prepare a Paper to be read at this Meeting, and he suggested the Folklore of Ceylon as a subject that would be of interest. Although the time at my disposal was insufficient either to collect materials, or, when collected, to digest them, I readily accepted the undertaking, convinced that any shortcomings on my part would be excused in view of the shortness of the time given me and the difficulty of the subject to be dealt with.\nMr. Steele the author of a metrical translation of the Kusa J\u00fataka has,\u2014no doubt with the view of attracting the attention of literary men to this interesting subject,\u2014given a few Sinhalese stories as an appendix to his work, and has concluded them with the following appropriate observations:\n\n\"Old-world household stories are very plentiful in Ceylon. The foregoing may be of interest as shewing how rich a field, one little harvested yet, lies open to the gleaner. When it is remembered that, besides the aboriginal wild race, the Vedd\u00e1s, the Island is the home of Sinhalese, an Aryan race from the upper valley of the Ganges, of Tamils, of Moors, the descendants of the ancient Arab navigators, who, as Sinbad avouches, voyaged often to Serendib, of Malays, not to mention Parsis, Chinese, Kaffirs from Eastern Africa, Maldivians, Bengalis and many others,\u2014men of widely diverse descent and creeds, the abundance of, so to speak, unwrought folk-lore will be readily recognised.\n\n\"It is the writer's hope, should the present venture meet with favor and acceptance, to offer a large and more varied selection to the reader hereafter.\"\n\nThe hope here entertained has not, I think, been realized, nor has the subject been taken up by any other writer that I am aware of.\n\nA complete collection of the tales and stories existing in Ceylon,\u2014and I think they exist as abundantly here as in any other country in the world,\u2014can only be the work of time. It is therefore desirable that, rather than wait to make such a collection, writers who may wish to labor in this field of literary investigation should publish what stories they may collect in the columns of this Society's Journal as the only literary periodical in the Island.\n\nThe present Paper is merely a beginning in this direction, and it is to be hoped that other writers who are more able than myself to undertake the task, and have more leisure at their disposal than I can command, will from time to time contribute their collections to this Journal, and thus supply a store of materials for future scientific and linguistic investigations.\nIn the work of collection it is necessary that a great deal of care and discrimination should be exercised, for what is really wanted and what can lead us to real truths are the genuine stories of the Sinhalese\u2014those which are quite free from foreign influences and have existed among the people from time immemorial. These can only be gathered from the inhabitants of villages and of the remoter parts of the Island into which western civilization has not yet penetrated. In the principal towns and suburbs there are now current among the Sinhalese several stories taken from English books and other sources, and hence too much care and caution cannot be exercised in deciding whether a story is really free from such influences or not.\n\nIn this paper I am able to give only one Sinhalese story out of the collection I have made. Its aim is to shew the cunning and avarice of women and the fertility of their resource when tricks have to be resorted to for the accomplishment of an object, the averting of a calamity or the getting out of a difficulty.\n\nIn order to understand the story it is necessary that the reader should know what is meant by the expressions \"to take sil\" and \"to give sil.\" Sil is a religious observance. \"To take sil\" is to vow or to promise and solemnly undertake to follow strictly the precepts of Buddha, not to kill, not to steal, not to drink &c. One desirous of taking sil attends the Pansala and after bowing down in reverence to the priest recites \"the three sarayas\" as follows, the devotee repeating them after him:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Buddha\u00f1 saranaya gachchhami,} \\\\\n\\text{Dhamma\u00f1 saranaya gachchhami,} \\\\\n\\text{Sangha\u00f1 saranaya gachchhami.}\n\\]\n\nThis is done three times after which the commands or precepts are recited by the priest and repeated by the devotee. In this ceremony the priest is said \"to give sil\" and the devotee \"to take or receive sil.\"\n\nI must also premise before beginning the story that when a priest is invited by a layman to his house for the purpose of performing a religious ceremony or of partaking of meals usually\ncalled *dan* or *d\u00e1na*, \"a gift or any thing given,\" it is not permitted to the priest to decline the invitation, except under unavoidable circumstances such as sickness or a prior engagement.\n\nThe story then runs thus.\n\nOnce on a time there was a simple and dull-witted man who had a cunning and artful wife. The woman was, however, much devoted to religion, and was a regular attendant on *p\u00f3ya* days at the Vih\u00e1ra and P\u00e1nsala in order to worship Buddha and to receive *sil*. The man, who had previously paid no attention to religion, was one day seized all of a sudden with a desire to follow the example of his wife, and calling her immediately to his side said, \"I wish to take *sil*: tell me how I should set about it.\"\n\nThe wife delighted to see her husband form so good a resolution said, \"Get up very early in the morning, go to the P\u00e1nsala with a pingo of boiled rice and curries, offer them to the priest, and repeat the words which he will pronounce.\"\n\nThe earnestness with which the man formed his resolution and his anxiety to act on it were so great that sleep fled from his eyes, and he impatiently watched for the dawn to hasten to the priest's residence. Long before the break of day he set out for the P\u00e1nsala which lay about a mile from his house. On arriving there he found the door closed, but he knocked with such violence as to rouse the priest who was fast asleep in an inner chamber.\n\n\"I wonder\" said the priest to himself \"who this can be that disturbs my repose at this ungodly hour.\" So saying he rose and began to rub his eyes. The knocks on the door continued with redoubled vigour. The priest then jumped out of bed, and approaching the door with some degree of anxiety said \"Kavuda?\", \"Who's there?\"\n\nThe man, following literally the instructions of his wife as to repetition, replied \"Kavuda?\"\n\nThe priest could not understand how any one could be in the mood for fun at such a time or place, and drawing still nearer the door said, \"Mokada?\", \"What's the matter?\"\n\"Mokada?\" repeated the man.\n\nThe priest was bewildered. He could not for the life of him understand the meaning of so strange a proceeding, and he called out in a loud and stern tone, \"Allapiya,\" \"Lay hold (of him).\"\n\n\"Allapiya\" was as quickly echoed forth.\n\nThe priest then went into one of the rooms to wake up his servant, and in the meantime the simpleton, hearing nothing more, concluded that the ceremony was over and returned home, leaving the pingoo at the door. The priest and his servant opened the door to see what it all meant, and right glad were they to find the pingoo, but they could see no one.\n\nOn reaching home the man called his wife to his side and said, \"I have received sil: I feel such a change: I am determined to be more assiduous than you have been in the observance and practice of the rite.\" The man then went to work in the field, returned home in the evening, and took his dinner, but was scarce in bed before he repeated \"Karuda? Mokada? Allapiya.\"\n\n\"What's the sense of these words?\", enquired the wife in surprise.\n\n\"I am reciting what the priest taught me when he gave me sil,\" said the man.\n\n\"I wonder if you're right in your head!?\", said the wife.\n\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"in right good earnest I tell you, I repeat what the priest taught me. I am practising sil.\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me,\" retorted the woman. \"If you're not mad already, you're very near it!\"\n\nThe man, however, paid no attention to his wife's words believing her to be in jest, but kept repeating the words all night long at frequent intervals, to the serious disturbance of his wife's rest and that of the other inmates of the house. This went on for several nights, and nothing that the wife could think of had the effect of convincing the man of his mistake.\n\nAbout this time three thieves broke into the King's Treasury at night, and stole from it a part of his treasure, consisting of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls and jewels of great value.\nCarrying off their booty they came to the pilikanna [back part] of the man's house, and, as it was a safe and convenient spot for the division of their spoil, they began to divide it. They had hardly commenced their task when they were startled by the words \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya\" in a loud voice from within the house.\n\n\"We are undone,\" said one of the thieves: \"Discovered most certainly,\" said another: \"Hush! hush!\" said the third, \"the words may have been addressed to somebody else.\"\n\nSo they made up their minds to go on with the division, but had scarcely recommenced before the same words \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya\" fell on their ears. Then they forthwith took to their heels leaving the booty behind.\n\nThe man hearing all the clatter outside, went to the pilikanna with a light, and saw to his amazement the three heaps of treasure. He immediately awoke his wife and took her to the spot. Her eyes beamed as she beheld the unexpected wealth. Husband and wife together conveyed the heaps into the house, and all was secure in trunks before the day dawned.\n\n\"Now,\" said the man, \"was it not my observance of sil that brought us this luck?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the wife, \"I am glad you have been so earnest in its practice.\"\n\nThe man's thoughts were now directed to the consideration, as to how best he might shew his gratitude to the priest who had given him sil.\n\n\"It is our duty,\" said he to his wife, \"to make a gift of one-third of the wealth to the priest who gave me sil, and who has thus been the means of our acquiring this unlooked for fortune. Prepare breakfast for him, therefore, to-morrow morning, and I will invite him to partake of it, and to receive the offering of a third of the treasure.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said the woman, \"that will never do. What the priest taught you was not sil.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said her husband, \"hold your tongue and attend to what I say. I must shew my gratitude to the priest; I must give him a third of the wealth.\"\n\"Well, if you must\u2014you must\" said the woman.\n\nWords and tears were of no avail. The man was firm as a rock, and his wife gave up all hopes of dissuading him from his purpose.\n\nNext morning she prepared meals for the priest. The man called at the Pansala and said to the priest: \"My lord, you were kind enough to give me sil some time ago, and I have been a constant and diligent observer of the rite ever since. The result is that I have been blessed with very valuable treasure, quite sufficient to keep me and mine comfortable for many generations to come. Condescend therefore to repair to my humble abode, partake of the meal I have prepared for you, and receive one-third of the fortune I have come by, as a token of my gratitude.\"\n\n\"I never saw you before,\" said the priest, \"nor do I remember having ever given you sil.\"\n\n\"Then it must be some other priest in this Pansala,\" said the man; \"it matters little which, only come and receive the gift.\n\nThe man led the way and the priest and his servant followed, not, however, without some suspicion and fear. When they had come within sight of the house the man saw his wife standing in the compound.\n\n\"Come on leisurely,\" said the man to the priest, \"while I run a-head to see that everything is ready for your reception.\" So saying the man ran up to his wife and whispered in her ear, \"Has our neighbour brought the curds we ordered last evening?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"I will go and fetch it then,\" said he; \"in the meantime give the priest a seat and attend to him till I return.\"\n\nNow when the priest saw the man whispering in the woman's ear, his suspicions of some foul play, which had already been roused, were almost confirmed.\n\nSo when he got to the house he said to the woman, \"Pray what did your husband whisper in your ear?\"\n\n\"Bad luck to you!,\" said the woman, \"my husband is gone to fetch a rice pounder to make an end of you!\"\nWhen the priest heard this he ran as fast he could and the servant after him.\n\nThey had not run far before the man returned with the curds.\n\n\"Why are they running away?\" said he.\n\n\"That's more than I can say,\" answered his wife; \"but the priest told me to ask you to follow him with a rice-pounder.\"\n\nThe man hastened into the kitchen, took up a rice-pounder, and away he went at full speed.\n\n\"Stop a bit! stop a bit! your Reverence,\" he bellowed.\n\nBut the priest, seeing the man actually following with a rice-pounder, redoubled his steps and was soon out of sight, and the man could not find him though he searched every nook and corner of the Pansala.\n\nSo the man returned home and never more thought of offering the wealth to the priest, and right glad was the woman to find that her plan had succeeded so well.\nBUDDHA'S SERMON ON OMENS.\n\nBY LOUIS DE ZOYSA, MAH\u00c1 MUDALIY\u00c1R.\n\n(Read, September 14th, 1882.)\n\nThat the Founder of Buddhism has repudiated caste and superstition both in theory and practice, is well known. A high authority* has characterized Buddha as \"the great opponent of Hind\u00fa caste and superstition.\" But in countries like Ceylon, in which Hind\u00faism had prevailed before the introduction of Buddhism, caste and superstition still exist though in a modified form; and writers whose information is derived from secondary sources are apt to forget the real teachings of Buddha on these subjects. A notable instance of this I may mention here. A recent writer,\u2020 \"On the Religions of India\" has, according to a review of his work in the Athen\u00e6um, attributed the introduction of caste into Ceylon to the influence of Buddhism!\n\nI hope to lay before the Society from time to time, translations of extracts from Buddhist writings bearing on these two subjects. In the present note I shall confine my remarks to the subject of \"superstition,\" reserving those on \"caste\" for a future occasion.\n\nA fair idea of Buddha's views on superstition may be formed on reference to two papers published in this Society's Journal. I allude to the able translation of \"Brahmaj\u00e1la Suttan\"\u2021 by the late Revd. D. J. Gogerly, in which various superstitions are enumerated and condemned as \"unworthy and animal sciences,\" and to my own translation of two J\u00e1takas, (Nakkhatta and N\u00e1m\u00e1siddhi),\u00a7 one of which exposes the folly of\n\n---\n\n* The late learned Dr. Mill, Principal of Bishop's College, Calcutta.\n\u2020 Mr. A. Barth, (Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series.)\n\u2021 C A. S. Journal 1846 (Reprint, 1861) pp. 17\u201462.\n\u00a7 C, A, S, Journal 1880, Part II, pp. 29\u201433.\nbelieving in astrology, and the other of the practice of conferring on individuals what are supposed to be lucky or auspicious names.\n\nMy special object however in the present note is to bring to light the true object of Mangalan Sutta, one of the most remarkable discourses of Buddha against \"superstition,\" which is found in two of the canonical Scriptures of Buddhism, namely in the Sutta Nipata and Khuddaka Pattha sections of the Khuddaka Pattha of the Sutta Pitaka.\n\nThere are three English translations extant of this discourse\u2014one by the late Rev. D. J. Gogerly, in the Ceylon Friend for June 1839, another by the late Professor R. C. Childers in his translation of the Khuddaka Pattha, and a third in the late Sir M. Coomara Swamy's translation of Sutta Nipata; but by an unhappy rendering of one expression by the learned translators, the true object of the discourse, namely, that of exposing the folly of believing in omens, has been completely kept out of view, and the discourse is simply regarded as a series of excellent moral maxims. Mr. Gogerly rendered the words \"etan mangalan uttamay,\" \"these are chief excellencies\": Mr. Childers, \"this is the greatest blessing\": this is also the rendering adopted by Sir M. Coomara Swamy.\n\nWhen Mr. Childers' able and lucid translation of Khuddaka Pattha appeared in 1874, I ventured to address a letter to that gentleman referring him to the Atthakatha or Commentary on the discourse, which explains its origin and objects, and submitting to him whether the words \"etan mangalan uttamay,\" which he has rendered \"this is the greatest blessing,\" should not be more correctly rendered \"this is the best omen,\" or \"these are the best omens.\" In reply he approved of my proposed rendering, but unfortunately having mislaid his letter, I am deprived of the gratification of producing it, but it will be seen that my late lamented friend has made the following note in the Addenda to his Pali Dictionary Vol. II. P. 617 s. v. \"'mangalo,' 'mangalan,' means also 'an omen.' I learn from Louis de Soysa that 'etan mangalan uttamay' should be rendered 'this is the best omen.'\"\nThe reasons which have induced me thus to render the words \"eta\u014b mangalan uttaman\" will be seen from the following condensed translation of the introduction of this discourse in the Commentary.\n\n\"What is the origin of mangalan suttan? It was the practice for people in Jambudipa to assemble at the gates of cities, in meeting houses and other places, and to hear the recital of various stories such as those of Sit\u00e1, Bharata, &c. The people discussed various subjects at these meetings. Each discussion some time lasted for four months. On one occasion, the subject of discussion happened to be that of mangalan (happy or auspicious things i.e. good omens). What is a dittha mangalan (a good omen of sight)? What is a suta mangalan (a good omen of smell or taste or touch)? Do you know what a mangalan is?, said some of the audience present). One of them, a believer in omens of sight (dittha mangaliko), said, 'I know what a mangalan is. For example, a man rising up early in the morning sees a speaking bird,* tender fruits of the bilva tree (Aegle marmelos), a pregnant woman, a child, an ornamented brimming jar, a fresh cyprinus fish, a thorough bred horse, or the likeness of one, a bull, a cow, a tawny coloured cow, or any other object of an auspicious nature,\u2014it is a mangalan.' Some of the audience accepted his theory, but those who did not entered into a dispute with him.\n\n\"A believer in omens of hearing (suta mangaliko) remarked that the eye sees what is pure and what is impure, what is good and what is bad, what is pleasant and what is unpleasant. If what is seen by the eye be a mangalan (good omen), then every object of sight must be one. What is seen therefore is not a mangalan: that which is deemed a true mangalan is that of hearing. If a man rising up early in the morning hears a sound such as 'it has prospered,' 'it is prospering,' 'it is full,' 'it is fresh,' 'it is delightful,' 'prosperity,' 'increase of prosperity' 'the lunar constellation,' 'to-day is auspicious,' 'a lucky moment,' a 'lucky day,' or any other pleasant sound deemed auspicious, this is said to be a mangalan.\n\n* Such as a parrot, mina, &c.\n\"Whereupon a believer in omens of smell, taste and touch, (muta mangaliko) addressed the meeting saying:\u2014'A man hears what is good and what is bad, what is pleasant and what is unpleasant; if what is heard by the ear be a 'mangalan,' (good omen) then everything heard must be a good omen also. I say therefore that suta mangalan is not a true mangalan, and that the true mangalan is what is called muta mangalan. For example, if a man rising up early in the morning smells the fragrance of the lotus and other sweet smelling flowers, uses fresh dentrifice, touches the earth, or ripe corn, or fresh cow-dung, or a turtle, or a heap of sesamum seed, or flowers, or fruits, daubs (the floor) with fresh earth, puts on a new cloth, wears a new turban, or smells any other sweet smells, tastes or touches an object deemed auspicious\u2014it is a mangalan.'\n\n\"Thus men all over Jambudipa formed themselves into groups, and began to discuss what the real mangal\u00e1ni are. From men, their guardian deities, from them, their friends the terrestrial deities, from them, their friends the celestial deities, from them, their friends the deities of the Ch\u00e1tummah\u00e1r\u00e1jika heavens, and from them, all the deities as far as Akani\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the highest of the heavens, took up the subject of mangalan, and forming themselves into groups, began to discuss what mangal\u00e1ni are. Thus the discussion lasted for twelve years amongst men and gods. (except among the disciples of Buddha) throughout the ten thousand worlds of the universe, but they were unable to solve the problem. At last the gods of the T\u00e1vat\u00ed\u015ba heavens approached Sakko, and begged of him to declare what the mangal\u00e1ni are. The King of the gods enquired of them where the Supreme Buddha was then residing. Being told that he was then residing at J\u00e9tavana Monastery in the city of S\u00e1vatthi, he directed one of the gods to repair to him, and beg him to declare what mangal\u00e1ni are, and the god did so.\"\n\nThe sequel is told in the Sutta itself, and now I have the pleasure to reproduce Mr. Childer's masterly version of Mangala Sutta\u1e47, only substituting the expression 'this is the best omen,' for 'this is the greatest blessing.'\n\"Thus I have heard. On a certain day dwelt Buddha at Sravasti, at the J\u00e9tavana Monastery, in the garden of Anathapindaka. And when the night was far advanced a certain radiant celestial being, illuminating the whole of J\u00e9tavana, approached the blessed one, and saluted him and stood aside. And standing aside addressed him with this verse:\n\n'Many gods and men, yearning after good, have held divers things to be blessings (good omens); say thou, what is the greatest blessing (the best omen or the best omens)?\n\nBuddha:\u2014'To serve wise men and not serve fools, to give honour to whom honour is due, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To dwell in a pleasant land, to have done good deeds in a former existence, to have a soul filled with right desires, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Much knowledge and much science, the discipline of a well trained mind, and a word well spoken, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To succour father and mother, to cherish wife and child, to follow a peaceful calling, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To give alms, to live religiously, to give help to relatives, to do blameless deeds, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To cease and abstain from sin, to eschew strong drink, to be diligent in good deeds, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Reverence and lowliness, contentment and gratitude, to receive religious teaching at due seasons, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To be long-suffering and meek, to associate with the priests of Buddha, to hold religious discourse at due seasons, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Temperance and chastity, discernment of the four great truths, the prospect of Nirvana, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n'The soul of one unshaken by the changes of this life, a soul inaccessible to sorrow, passionless, secure, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'They that do these things are invincible on every side, on every side they walk in safety, yea, theirs is the greatest blessing, (theirs are the best omens).'\n\nIt may be remarked, how could such distinguished scholars as Gogerly and Childers have committed such a mistake as the one referred to? The matter is easily explained. They have evidently translated the word *maygalan* in its ordinary sense,* without referring to the commentary which explains the special sense in which the word is used in this discourse. This is not to be wondered at, seeing that even some of the learned Buddhist Priests of the present day commit the same mistake and interpret the discourse simply as a series of moral maxims. Strangely enough, this discourse is used by Buddhists even for purposes of superstition, such as, exorcism, etc. It is so used by the Kandyan Buddhists according to Mr. C. J. R. LeMesurier, c.c.s., who, by the way, calls it \"the Sutra of Festivals\" which might lead one to suppose that it has some connection with the various Kandyan Hind\u00fa Festivals, which he describes in his account of \"The Principal Religious Ceremonies observed by the Kandyans of Ceylon.\"\u2020\n\nIt is only when this discourse is viewed by the light thrown on it by the commentary, that it appears in its true character, as one of the most powerful exposures of Hind\u00fa superstition on record.\n\n---\n\n* Maygalo (adj.)

Lewis, Esq.\n\n(Read, November 2nd, 1882.)\n\nNo naturalist, or more probably, no ornithologist has ever looked upon a feather without admiring its beautiful structure, and admirable adaptation of ends to means. Here will be found a maximum of strength in a minimum of weight; adapted alike, as an organ of flight, or as a means of warmth to the creature that supports this exquisite structure. Colored in some instances only as a means of attraction, or, in others, as one of protection, and yet withal, light as proverbially, 'as a feather.'\n\nIn variety of external form, we have many, even in Ceylon birds, though of course, if the examples of variation of pattern, from all parts of the world were tabulated, a long and interesting list could be made, were such necessary. My object in the present Paper is of a further character, and one which requires a deeper investigation than that of a mere comparison of external shapes and forms.\n\nA feather may not inaptly be likened to a cocoanut leaf or branch, as it is sometimes called. There is the shaft or quill, and from it diverge other shafts which form the webs. If a breast feather be pulled from some well-known bird, say a Woodpecker, we observe in the lower, or basal region, that the quill supports a shaft, or, as I shall call it, a web-shaft Fig. 1 (bb); which, in turn, towards the lower half of the feather bears a fine thread like process, say one-tenth of an inch long, which I shall call the sub-web-shaft Fig. 1 (ccc). In the upper or exposed part of the feather, this sub-web-shaft is absent, leaving the conclusion that these fine filaments are for the purpose of warmth\u2014a con-\nPlate I.\n\nN\u00b01\n\nShewing (a) the quill, (bb) the web shafts, and (c c c) the sub web shafts much enlarged so as to shew clearly the portions in question.\n\nN\u00b02\n\nSub web shaft of simple order \u00d7500\n\nN\u00b03\n\nSub web shaft of the telescopic order \u00d7500\n\nN\u00b04\n\n\u00d7500\n\nLITHOGRAPHED AT THE S.G OFFICE, COLOMBO\nin itself may be considered as a means of classification, if such there be. Unfortunately, I have not had the good fortune to be able to examine the plumage of birds from other countries, more especially those from the colder climates of the extreme north which would give evidence either in support, or to the contrary of my theory. For the present, I venture the subject more as a question, than as an established fact, though the evidence from local examples tends greatly to prove the force of my theory.\n\nClimatic effects may probably bear with more or less weight upon the point, but I find the conclusion is still irresistible that each existing form can be traced to a higher, which we may call the aboriginal parent, and its necessity is just the same, in a larger measure, as that which supplies the present sub-web-shaft. Where warmth is unnecessary, then sub-web-shafts do not exist, as for instance in the tail feathers, or feathers beyond the body, and by analogy, where greater warmth is required, then the additional process would exist, which through non-necessity is now reduced to a simple, or at most a spinous joint.\nThe Sinhalese are essentially a social people. Some of the most important traits of their character are, deep attachment to friends, filial obedience, and love of their homes and villages. There are a few greater hardships which a Sinhalese can be called upon to undergo than separation from the home and friends of his childhood, and there are few dearer reminiscences to him, wherever he may be in after life, than those which recall the early days spent in his native village. Home stories and sayings exercise no little influence on him, and at any rate in the leisure portion of the life of the villager oral stories take an important place, whether they be the Jataka stories of the various births of Buddha,\n\n\"The preternatural tale,\n\"Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends,\"\n\nor the more modest stories that relate the doings of the people. In the Sinhalese home it is true that the \"fireside\" with which we connect the story-telling of harsher climes is absent, but it finds its representative in the little verandah or in the roadside, and often when the family have retired to rest for the night in the single room and verandah which generally form the \"house\" of the Sinhalese cultivator, one member, frequently the grandfather relates stories to the others until he finds that the \"dull god\" has drawn away his audience. In the night as two or three villagers sit guarding the ripening grain of their paddy fields from the inroads of elephant, buffalo or boar, stories serve to wile away what would be otherwise a weary vigil, and on numerous other common-place occasions story-telling plays an important part. Some of these stories throw considerable light\non the modes of thought, manners, and customs of the people, and also may perhaps be of some value in comparative folklore, I therefore give translations of a few of these village stories.\n\nI.\u2014The Trial at Avich\u00e1ra-Pura.*\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Badulla there is among the Sinhalese a saying, when justice appears to have miscarried:\n\n\"Avich\u00e1ra-pur\u00e9 na\u1e0duwa widgeyi;\"\u2014\"Like the trial at Avich\u00e1rapura.\"\n\nThe story on which the saying is founded is without doubt of considerable age and contains rich satire:\n\nOne night some thieves broke into the house of a rich man and carried away all his valuables. The man complained to the Justice of the Peace, who had the robbers captured, and when brought before him enquired of them whether they had anything to say in their defence. \"Sir,\" said they, \"we are not to blame in this matter: the robbery was entirely due to the mason who built the house; for the walls were so badly made, and gave way so easily, that we were quite unable to resist the temptation of breaking in.\" Orders were then given to bring the mason to the Court-house. On his arrival he was informed of the charge brought against him. \"Ah,\" said he, \"the fault is not mine, but that of my cooly, who made mortar badly.\" When the cooly was brought he laid the blame on the potter whom he said had sold him a cracked chatty, in which he could not carry sufficient water to mix the mortar properly. Then the potter was brought before the judge, and he explained that the blame should not be laid upon him, but upon a very pretty woman who in a beautiful dress was passing his house at the time he was making the chatty, and had so riveted his attention that he forgot all about the work. When the woman appeared, she protested that the fault was not hers, for she would not have been in that neighbourhood at all had the goldsmith sent home her earrings at the proper time; the charge she urged should properly be brought against him.\n\n* A, 'without'; vich\u00e1ra, 'enquiry'; pura, 'city.'\nThe goldsmith was brought and as he was unable to offer any reasonable excuse, he was condemned to be hanged. Those in the Court however begged the Judge to spare the goldsmith's life; \"for,\" said they, \"he is very sick and ill-favoured and would not make at all a pretty spectacle\"; \"but,\" said the judge, \"somebody must be hanged.\" Then they drew the attention of the Court to the fact that there was a fat Moorman in a shop opposite who was a much fitter subject for an execution, and asked that he might be hanged in the goldsmith's stead. The learned Judge, considering that this arrangement would be very satisfactory, gave judgment accordingly.\n\nII.\u2014The Goldsmith who Cheated his Mother.\n\nOf all workmen the Sinhalese regard the native goldsmith with the greatest suspicion. This is due no doubt to the fact that, whenever opportunity occurs, he appropriates a portion of the precious metal entrusted to him, often substituting for it that of a baser kind. There are many sayings in the language to the effect that 'whoever else is to be trusted, a goldsmith is not'; and there is a popular belief that 'a goldsmith would cheat his own mother', in illustration of which the following story is told:\n\nA certain woman possessed a large piece of gold made up in the form of a frog,* which had been a heir-loom in her family for many years. She, though wishing to keep the metal, was anxious to have it made up in the form of ornaments, which she could wear and display before her friends. She was afraid to take it to a goldsmith, for she knew that they all had the reputation of being rogues, and that she would most likely be cheated. It, therefore, occurred to her that the safest way would be to have her son apprenticed to the trade: this she accordingly did. When he had learned it sufficiently well, she took the golden frog to him and requested him to make it into the ornaments she required. The cunning fellow first obtained a live frog and placed it among the ashes of his fireplace, and then, whilst his mother stood by, took the golden\n\n* S. Gemadhiya.\none, put it among the ashes also, and commenced to blow the fire to melt it down. The live-frog feeling uncomfortable in the heat immediately jumped out and hopped away. \"See, dear mother\", said he, \"your frog is gone. How can you expect me to make ornaments from a living thing?\" \"Oh, my dear son\", said the mother, \"what is worse than bad fortune? My lump of gold has turned into a lump of flesh.\"\n\nIII.\u2014A Story of Two Rogues.\n\nThere are several stories which relate to the sharp-wittedness of people from different villages, towns, or districts, and which, seem to imply much the same as is expressed in our English proverb \"set a thief to catch a thief.\" The following is well-known, and, although the story varies somewhat in different localities, is in substance the same. The names given to the two rogues vary with the place where it is told, but they are, as far as I have heard, always the names of different villages, or districts, with the affix y\u00e1 or w\u00e1 thus Gampolay\u00e1 and Rayigamay\u00e1, 'a Gampola man' and 'Rayigama man'; Migam\u00far\u00e1d and M\u00e1taray\u00e1, 'a Negombo man' and 'M\u00e1tara man':\n\nTwo men who lived in different districts, and who depended principally on their wits for a livelihood, started off one day about the same time each to pay a visit to the other. On their way they met, and agreed to go together in search of adventure. As they went on they heard the sound of weeping at a certain house and, finding the friends of a dead man mourning for him, they went and joined in the lamentations. When the question of the division of the deceased's property arose, they put in their claim. \"Who are you?\", the people asked, \"and what right have you to any of the property?\" \"Was not this our own poor old grandfather whom we have not seen for these many years?\", said the men weeping. The friends at the house were so affected by the grief of the strangers, that they agreed to go that evening to the grave of the dead man, and see if he would express any wish in the matter. One of the rogues slipped out unobserved and laid himself beside the grave. \"Is it your will that these two\nstrange persons should have any share in your property?\u201d, asked one. \u201cYou are all my children: divide it amongst you fairly\u201d, came in sepulchral tones from the grave. Having received a box containing some valuable articles, they started off, and after journeying for some time lay down to rest near the sea-shore, placing the box between them. One, finding the other asleep shortly afterwards, took the box, and, going into the sea as high as the armpits, buried it in the sand; then going back again to his place fell asleep. Soon afterwards the second man awoke, and, finding his neighbour asleep and the box gone, guessed what had been done with it. He therefore commenced to lick along the whole length of his body, and, finding the taste of salt did not go above his armpits, knew the depth where it was buried. Having discovered the box, he carried it away, and hid himself in one of a number of ricks of straw that were standing a short distance off. On the other man awakening, he knew that his friend had discovered the treasure and made off with it, but, as had not had time to escape far, he thought that he was most likely hiding in one of the heaps of straw hard by. Tying a sokada (wooden bullock bell) round his neck he went on his hands and knees knocking his head against each of the ricks. The man who was hiding hearing the noise and thinking it was a buffalo, shouted out \u201cJah! jah! ko\u1e6diy\u00e1 k\u00e1*!\u201d and so was discovered. After this, it is said, they divided the spoil equally.\n\nIV.\u2014How the Tumpan\u00e9 Folk went a-Bees\u2019-Nesting.\n\nAmong the folk stories of the Siphalese there are a large number which relate to simpletons,\u2014a class of stories which we find in most countries. The following bears some resemblance to the story of the Wise Men of Gotham, who, seeing the reflection of the full moon in the river Trent as they passed over, and thinking it to be a cheese lying at the bottom, lowered one of their number with a rope to reach it.\n\nOne day a man in Tumpan\u00e9 (a district renowned for its foolish people) wanted some honey for his daughter who was\n\n* An imprecation, lit. \u201cMay a tiger eat you!\u201d\nvery sick; so he got his friends to assist him, and they set off to the forest in order to find a bees' nest. As they passing by a deep pond, they beheld the reflection of one was suspended on an overhanging tree. Having tried to grasp the nest in the water, they thought that it was deeper down than they supposed, and one of their number was, therefore, sent in. Believing, as he was unable to it, that he could not get down far enough, they tied a large round his neck. The other fools stood by the whole day waiting for the man to come up with the honey.\n\nV. How a TUMPAH\u00c9 MAN CURED HIS MOTHER.\n\nOnce upon a time a half-witted villager bought a bill to use in his hackery, and, as he took it away, the dealer (a sophist in his way) repeated to him this proverb:\n\n\"Harak digas-budu waga,\" lit., \"cattle are like watery things\" (that is, they are perishable, and consequently require a deal of care and attention). The man, however, took the proverb literally, and, noticing water coming from the bullock as it along, thought that it had already commenced to dissolve. He was now very anxious to dispose of his bullock before the process went farther, and a man happening to be passing with a ketta (bill-hook) in his hand, the owner of the bullock asked what the ketta would do: \"fell jungle\", said the man. They then agreed that an exchange should be made of the bill for the ketta. The half-witted fellow took the axe, and got some jungle land which belonged to him, placed it upon it, and went away. Some time afterwards he returned to see how much jungle it had felled, but was surprised to find that not cut even a single tree. When he picked it up he found the iron was quite warm, and concluded that it had not been work that day as it was suffering from fever. He, therefore, went to the doctor, who, knowing how foolish the man appeared him by telling him to bury it in a cool spot un morning and he would then find the fever gone. The man as he was told, and found his ketta quite cool. Next day ever, his mother had a severe attack of fever, and, remem\nthe medicine that had cured his ketta, he took the poor old woman to the same spot, and making a bigger hole carefully covered her up.\n\nVI.\u2014Hunting a Palm-Cat.\n\nA long time ago there lived in Tumpan\u00e9 a newly married couple. One evening as the wife was commencing to prepare her husband\u2019s dinner she heard the cry of a kalaredd\u00e1 (palm-cat) in a tree near the house, and, thinking if she could manage to catch it she might surprise her husband with a good meat curry, went out with the dog, saying \u201cusi, usi,\u201d (urging on the dog). The dog ran to the foot of the tree barking and placed his forefeet on the trunk. She, thinking that he was trying to climb it, began to make him a valalla (a ring put round the ankles when climbing a tree). Just at that time the husband returned, and seeing what she was doing chid her for her foolishness, saying that \u2018he would shew her the way to get the dog up the tree.\u2019 Procuring a long stake he sharpened one end of it and sticking it into the dog hoisted him up to where the palm-cat was. The poor animal in agony whined b\u00e9! b\u00e9! \u201cSay not b\u00e9! b\u00e9! (I cannot, I cannot)\u201d said the man \u201cbut lay hold of the palm-cat !\u201d\nRUINS AT VEHERAGALA.*\n\nThe ruins in question are known as \"Veheragala\" and are situated about two miles South of the 10th mile-post on the Anur\u0101dhapura road.\n\nThey consist for the most part of groups of stone pillars more or less roughly squared, and are probably the remains of palaces and Vih\u0101r\u0101s. The jungle is, however, so thick, and the ruins are so overgrown, that it is difficult to conjecture, from their formation, to what period they belong.\n\nThe only really interesting ruin which has so far been discovered, is that of an oval building, found upon a rocky mound, and the base of which is constructed of huge slabs of stone, (the shape of which is very peculiar) laid upon oblong blocks. They are cut into segments of a circle, each segment being 8 ft. to 12 ft. by 7 ft. \u00d7 7 in. or 8 in. thick. These slabs are also concave on the upper side and convex on the lower, but whether this was intentional, or the result of being wedged out of laminated rock\u2014with which the neighbourhood abounds,\u2014is not apparent. Another curious feature of the building is, that the oblong blocks upon which these slabs are laid, (and which seem to have formed the foundations) built upon the solid rock were morticed together, the sockets and notches being very distinct. The building faces North, on which side there is a flight of stone steps leading to the entrance, and its dimensions are, from North to South 56 feet, and from East to West 78 feet.\n\nIf this structure was intended for a Tope or D\u0101gaba\u2014which, considering that it was not circular, is, I think, unlikely\u2014it was never completed, and appears to have been temporarily used for some other purpose; for at the South end there are five spur stones, arranged in a curve, and upon which pillars must have\n\n* Extract from letter dated September 25th, 1882, from P.

OFFICE COLOMBO.\nTHE CONNECTION OF THE SI\u1e44HALESE WITH THE MODERN \u00c1RYAN VERNACULARS OF INDIA.\n\nBy W. P. RA\u1e44ASINHA, Esq.\n\nIs Sinhalese to be placed under the Turanian family of languages with Tamil, Telugu, &c., or under the Indo-Germanic family, along with Hind\u012b, Beng\u0101l\u012b, Panj\u0101b\u012b, Sindh\u012b, Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, Gujar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, Nep\u0101l\u012b, Oriya, Assamese, and K\u0101shm\u012br\u012b?\n\nThe Turanian family of languages has not got beyond the collocational or syntactical and agglutinated stages, whilst the Sinhalese has not only reached the inflectional stage, like Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, but has also advanced to the analytical, like the English, French, &c.: examples are \u0915\u0930\u092f\u093f, karayi, \u201che does\u201d; \u092f\u093e\u092f\u093f, yayi, \u201che goes\u201d; \u0926\u0947\u092f\u093f, deyi, \u201che gives,\u201d &c. Here we find the stems \u0915\u0930\u093e, kara, \u092f\u093e, ya, and \u0926\u093e, da, which are derived from the Sanskrit roots \u0915\u0930\u093f, kri, \u092f\u093e\u0924\u093f, y\u0101ti, and \u0926\u093e\u0924\u093f, d\u0101ti, with an inflection \u092f\u093f, yi. This \u092f\u093f, yi, is again divisible into two parts \u092f\u093f, yi, and \u0924\u093f, ti. The \u092f\u093f, yi, is merely an augment adopted for the purpose of avoiding the hiatus which would otherwise occur if after the stem the \u0924\u093f, ti, were pronounced alone. The \u0924\u093f, ti, here is the remnant of \u0924\u093f, ti, in the Sanskrit verbs \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0924\u093f, karoti, \u201che does\u201d; \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u093f, bharati, \u201che bears,\u201d &c. Mr. Beames points out that \u0924\u093f, ti, is equal to the English s in \u201che bears, &c.\u201d In Greek \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9, he says, we have i equal to the English pronoun \u201che.\u201d In Latin fert the i is lost and t alone remains. In Gothic baireth we have th; here too the i is lost. In English \u201cbeareth\u201d the i is lost, and the th alone remains. The English th and the Sinhalese i are parts of the same termination \u0924\u093f, ti. This th in English, he points out, is still further modified in the modern language into s as in \u201cbears,\u201d \u201cfears,\u201d &c. So the English s and the Sinhalese \u0924\u093f, ti, in the third person singular number present tense of the indicative mood, can be traced to the \u00c1ryan \u0924\u093f, ti,\u2014the English taking the first part of the termination and further modifying\nit into s, the Sinhalese rejecting the first part, and taking the vowel alone, and inserting a \u03c9, y, to avoid the hiatus.\n\nThe \u03c9, y, in \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, karayi, &c., is an augment and not a substitute for \u03c9, t. We have in \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, ker\u00e9, \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, y\u00e9, and \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, i\u00e9, other forms of the above verbs, meaning \u201che does,\u201d \u201che goes\u201d and \u201che gives.\u201d Here we find the \u03c9, i, without the \u03c9, y. By the rule of sandhi adigecornuveri, the vowel \u03c9, i, following the \u03c9, a, in \u03c9\u03b1, kara, \u03c9\u03b5+\u03c9+\u03c9, kar+a+i, becomes \u03c9, e, that is to say, both the \u03c9, a, and \u03c9, i, are lost, and \u03c9, e, is substituted in their place; hence the word \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, kare, and by the force of the vowel \u03c9, e, in \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, r\u00e9, the word becomes \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, ker\u00e9, \u201che does\u201d; similarly \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9+\u03c9+\u03c9, y+a+i, becomes \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, y\u00e9, \u201che goes\u201d; and \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9+\u03c9+\u03c9, d+a+i, becomes \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, de, \u201che gives.\u201d\n\nNow, although we never write \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, karai, \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, yai, and dei, but \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, karayi, \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, yai, and \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, deyi, yet they are pronounced \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, karai, \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, yai, and \u03c9\u03b5\u03b9, dei, as if they had been written so. This also is proof that the \u03c9, y, is merely an augment.\n\nIn the book language we have the following terminations:\n\n| Singular | Future |\n|----------|--------|\n| Present  |        |\n| 1. \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, karami, \u201cI do.\u201d | \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, karannemi, \u201cI will do.\u201d |\n| 2. \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, kerahi, \u201cYou do.\u201d | \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba, karanneshi, \u201cYou will do.\u201d |\n| 3. \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, ker\u00e9, \u201cHe does.\u201d | \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba, karann\u00e9, \u201cHe will do.\u201d |\n\n| Past |\n|------|\n| 1. \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, ka\u0283emi, \u201cI did.\u201d |\n| 2. \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba, ke\u0283eki, \u201cYou did.\u201d |\n| 3. \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, ke\u0283i, \u201cHe did.\u201d |\n\nBut in the spoken language these perhaps were found to be a great encumbrance, and a form \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, karaw\u00e1, has come to be used in the present and future tenses without any distinction as to number or person: and it is now necessary to say \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, mama karaw\u00e1, \u201cI do;\u201d \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba, \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2 karaw\u00e1, \u201che does;\u201d \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba, mama he\u0283a karaw\u00e1, \u201cI will do to-morrow.\u201d Sometimes \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba, kar\u00e1vi, and \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, karaw\u00e1 \u03c9\u03b5\u03b2, are used. The past tense in the\ncolloquial is \u0db8\u0dcf, kal\u00e1. This too having no inflections to show the number or person, the pronouns have to be prefixed:\u2014\u0db8\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf, mama kal\u00e1, \u201cI did\u201d; \u0dc0\u0dd9 \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf, api kal\u00e1, \u201cwe did\u201d; \u0d85 \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf, u kal\u00e1, \u201che did,\u201d &c. We have here both the inflectional and analytical stages. Thus by classification Sinhalese must be grouped under the Indo-Germanic family. \u201cBut,\u201d it is said \u201cclassification is not in itself sufficient for purposes of analysis\u201d. Let us therefore, look for other peculiarities. In the Turanian group, it is said that nouns are not distinct from verbs. In Sinhalese they are: \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4, karu, \u0dba, ya, \u0daf\u0dda, de, \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dca, niti, &c.,\u2014are always verbs and never nouns; nor could a noun be converted into a verb except by the addition of a verb, as \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dd2, pelakarami, \u201cI grow\u201d; \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dc0\u0dda, diyaveyi, \u201cit becomes liquid\u201d; \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dd2, diyakarami, \u201cI liquify.\u201d\n\nAnother characteristic of the Aryan language, says Mr. Beames, is \u201cthat the noun possesses three numbers, singular, dual and plural; and numerous cases each distinguished by a peculiar and inseparable termination.\u201d\n\nWe have in Sinhalese only the singular and the plural numbers, the dual is lost, as in English. The case endings are inseparable, that is to say, if separated from the stem, as \u0dad, ta, in \u0dad\u0dd4, matu, \u201cto me,\u201d they have no meaning in themselves, and here the \u0dad, ta, when separated has no meaning in itself.\n\nWe have the following terminations in nouns:\n\n| Masculine | |\n|-----------|---|\n| \u0db8\u0dcf, minis, \u201cMan.\u201d | |\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|-------|\n| Nom. \u0d86, \u0101 | \u0dc4\u0dd4, hu |\n| Acc. \u0d86, \u0101 | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca, en |\n| Inst. \u0d86 (\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca), \u0101 (visin) | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca (\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca), en (visin) |\n| Aux. | |\n| Dat. \u0d86\u0da7, \u0101\u1e6da | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7, en\u1e6da |\n| Abl. \u0d86\u0d9c\u0dda, \u0101ge | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda, enge |\n| Gen. \u0d86\u0d9c\u0dda, \u0101ge | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda, enge |\n| Loc. | |\n| Voc. \u0d86, \u0101 | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca, en |\n\n| Feminine | |\n|----------|---|\n| \u0db8\u0dcf, minis, \u201cWoman.\u201d | |\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|-------|\n| Nom. \u0d86, \u0101 | \u0dc4\u0dd4, hu |\n| Acc. \u0d86, \u0101 | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca, en |\n| Inst. \u0d86 (\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca), \u0101 (visin) | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca (\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca), en (visin) |\n| Aux. | |\n| Dat. \u0d86\u0da7, \u0101\u1e6da | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7, en\u1e6da |\n| Abl. \u0d86\u0d9c\u0dda, \u0101ge | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda, enge |\n| Gen. \u0d86\u0d9c\u0dda, \u0101ge | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda, enge |\n| Loc. | |\n| Voc. \u0d86, \u0101 | \u0d91\u0db1\u0dca, en |\nFeminine,\ng\u0113ni, \"Woman.\"\n\nSing. | Plur.\n---|---\nNom. | \u0113, i, u, \u00f3\nAcc. | \u0113, i, un, an\nInst. | \u0113, i, un, an\nAux. |\nDat. | \u0113, ta\nAbl. | \u0113, gen\nGen. | \u0113, g\u00e9\nLoc. | \u0113, a\nVoc. | \u0113, a\n\nNeuter\ngas, \"Tree.\"\n\nSingular | Plural\n---|---\nNom. | \u0113, a\nAcc. | \u0113, a\nInst. |\nAux. | \u0113, en\nDat. | \u0113, atu\nAbl. | \u0113, en\nGen. |\nLoc. | \u0113, \u0113\nVoc. | \u0113, a\n\nThe verb has three forms for the three persons and no forms for the three genders.

Several words are joined together, and the case and tense-endings are added to the last word only, the first member of the compound being either a preposition or a noun, or even a verb. This power is not possessed by other families.\" This power the Sinhalese language possesses in a preeminent degree, \\textit{Bomba suranari namadit}, given in the \\textit{Sidat Sangar\u0101} is a familiar example.\n\nI have here attempted to shew that most of the characteristics of the \u0100ryan languages do also apply to the modern Sinhalese.\n\nThe following languages, as was said before, belong to the Indie class of the Indo-Germanic family, Hindi, Bengali, Panjabi, Sindhi, Marathi, Gujarathi, Oriya, and Kashmiri. Following Mr. Beames' excellent work on the Philology of these languages I shall endeavour to shew the connection of Sinhalese with this family.\n\nThe numerals, says Mr. Beames, are those parts of speech which retain their forms with the greatest tenacity, and offer the most obvious similarities. Let us compare the Sinhalese with the Indian vernacular numerals.\n| Sanskrit | Bengali | Sinhalese (Old) | Sinhalese (Modern) |\n|----------|--------|----------------|--------------------|\n| ka       | eka    | eka            | eka               |\n| wi       | dve    | dvi            | de                |\n| i        | ti     | tin            | tina              |\n| hatur    | chati  | chari          | chara             |\n| aucha    | pana   | pinch          | paha              |\n| hash     | chha   | choi           | ha                |\n| optu     | satta  | sat            | hata              |\n| zhta     | atho   | dhith          | aja               |\n| vacus    | nava   | noy            | nava              |\n| lagun    | dara   | das            | dua               |\n| ikadusa  | ekula  | egar           | ekulaka           |\n| icadusa  | dwa    | bico           | daba              |\n| trayodasa| teju   | tera           | dahanuna          |\n| chaturdasa| chou  | chandda        | chandda           |\n| panchadasa| pau   | ponera         | payara            |\n| shoqan   | sojo   | shola          | sala              |\n| saptadasa| sali   | satera         | salas             |\n| asthadasa| affh   | athira         | athura            |\n| umariqati| ekta   | anis           | anisa             |\n| viysuli  | visai  | risa           | visi              |\n| triysat  | tinsa  | trisa          | tiha              |\n| chatvarisat| chati| challisa      | challa            |\n| paunchisat| panhi | panchusa      | pancha            |\n| shahtti  | satth  | sdeha          | sdeha             |\n| saptati  | salta  | sattara        | satta             |\n| azili    | asiti  | azi            | azi               |\n| navati   | navo   | nabbi          | anu               |\n| zata     | zata   | saya           | siya              |\nIt will be perceived at a glance that the Siphalese has followed the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit very closely with the exception of the changes peculiar to the language.\n\nIn the M\u00e1ldivian language the numerals are almost the same as in the Siphalese. The difference, as far as I am aware, is that the progression in that language is by duodecimals instead of decimals. They are eken, de\u1e47, tine\u1e47, hataren, pahen, hayen, hate\u1e47, aren, nure\u1e47, dihen, ekolahen, dolahen. Here they stop and for thirteen they have dolos eken, which means \u201ctwelve + one.\u201d This is continued up to \u201ctwenty-three\u201d which is dolos ekolos, and twenty-four is passihi: now passihi is evidently the same as the Siphalese \u0968\u096b, panvisi, which means \u201ctwenty-five.\u201d They proceed on with passihi eken, passihi de\u1e47, &c., and their \u201cthirty-six\u201d is tindolos, (i.e., three twelves.) Their \u201cforty-eight\u201d is panas, which is the Siphalese for \u201cfifty;\u201d their \u201csixty\u201d is pasdolos, (i.e., five twelves): \u201ceighty-four\u201d is hayidolos, (i.e., seven twelves; \u201cninety six\u201d is hiya, which is the same as the Siphalese \u096f\u096c, siya, \u201chundred.\u201d The real \u201chundred,\u201d however, they call sata, which is the P\u00e1li form of the Sanskrit \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e, sata, from which the Siphalese \u0938\u093f, siya, is derived through the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit say\u0101, as we have seen.*\n\nIn the Dr\u00e1vidian group the Telugu and the Tamil, I believe, stand foremost. The numerals in these two languages are:\n\n| Telugu | Tamil |\n|--------|-------|\n| 1      | ondu  | onru. |\n| 2      | re\u1e0du  | iraydu. |\n| 3      | mudu  | moudu. |\n| 4      | ndiyu | nali. |\n| 5      | aidu  | aindu. |\n| 6      | \u0101ru   | \u0101ru. |\n| 7      | \u0113du   | \u0113tu. |\n| 8      | enimdu| effu. |\n| 9      | tomnidu| ompadu. |\n| 10     | padi  | pattu. |\n| 20     | iravai| irupadu. |\n| 30     | muppai| muppadu. |\n| 40     | nilpata| n\u0101rpadu. |\n\n*Note.\u2014\u201cM\u00e1ldives Numerals\u201d\u2014Hon Sec.\nThese, it is obvious, have no relationship to the Sinhalese numerals.\n\nFollowing the Pr\u00e1krit the modern \u00c1ryan vernaculars of India have avoided the \"nexus\" or the combination of two or more consonants without an intervening vowel, which is seen in the Sinhalese too.\n\nThe Pr\u00e1krit \u1e0d, ch, is changed in Sinhalese mostly to \u1e63, s, and sometimes to \u1e6d, t, and also to \u1e0d, d.\n\nThe corruption has gone so far as to change the \u1e63, s, to \u1e6d, h, and sometimes the h is dropped.\n\nFrom the Sanskrit \u0938\u094b\u092e, sayya, \"bed,\" Pr\u00e1krit \u0938\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0915, sejj\u00e1, we get Sinhalese \u092b\u093f\u0915, enda. By reducing the \u1e63, s, into \u1e6d, h, and dropping it altogether, the \u1e63, jj\u00e1, is reduced to \u1e0d, da, and to compensate for the loss of the conjunct consonant, the vowel \u1e0dz, e, is substituted. This is more apparent when we compare the Sinhalese \u092b\u093f\u0915, enda, with the old Hindi sajy\u0101\u2014the modern Hindi, Panjabi, and Sindhi being sej.\n\nIn Pr\u00e1krit, which, as Professor Max M\u00fcller says, is the basis of all the \u00c1ryan vernaculars of India, consonants are dropped in the middle of words; as visai for vinsati, twenty. In Sinhalese the hiatus is always avoided by the coalition of the letters or by the insertion of the semivowels \u1e5b, ya, or \u1e0d, va, and sometimes \u1e0d, ra; \u0930\u0924\u0928\u093e, ratana, \"cubit,\" Sinhalese \u0930\u093f\u092f\u0928\u093e, riyana; \u0915\u0925\u092f\u0924\u093f, kathayati, \"he says,\" Sinhalese \u0915\u093f\u092f\u0924\u093f, kiyayi.

O. id.; \u092a. \u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924, ato.\n\nThe following rules may be deduced from the above and her peculiarities of the language.\n\n1. That pure Sinhalese retains all the Sanskrit vowels except \u0905, \u0906, \u0907, \u0908, \u0909, \u090a, \u090b, \u090f, \u0910, \u0913, \u0914; \u090b becomes either \u0930, a, i, or \u0930, u, or \u0930, iri, sometimes \u0930, ru; as taya, \"grass,\" for\ntrina, idu, \"straight,\" for riju, utu, \"season,\" for ritu, rasi, for rishi.\n\n2. ai, becomes e, as hela, \"mount,\" for saila.\n\n3. au, becomes o, as sonduru, saundaryya, \"comely.\"\n\n4. A long vowel is generally shortened as ek, \"one,\" for \u00e9ka; solos, \"sixteen,\" for s\u00f3dasa; maga, \"road\" for m\u00e1rga; isuru, \"lord\" for \u00edswara.\n\n5. The dental sibilent s represents the palatal and the lingual; as visi, \"twenty,\" for v\u00ed\u1e63ati; sa, \"sixty,\" for shashti; sa, \"six\" for shash.\n\n6. Aspirated consonants are reduced to their unaspirated sounds, sometimes with h, to compensate for the loss of the aspirate; as bima, \"land,\" for bhumi; via, \"manner,\" for vidhi; dehena, \"religious meditation,\" for dhy\u00e1na.\n\n7. cha, is changed either to sa, or da, sometime to ta; satara, \"four\" for chatur; pas, \"five\" for pa\u00f1cha; goduru, \"an object of sense,\" for gochara; tudus, \"fourteen,\" for chaturda\u015ba. The change of cha, to sa, is not peculiar to the Sinhalese alone: it is a feature of the Bengali and Marathi too. Mr. Beames says, \"In Eastern Bengal, where the pronunciation reaches the utmost limits of corruption, chha is regularly sounded as s, and in that dialect of Bengal spoken in Assam, not only has the s sound driven out the chha but also has in many cases still further passed into h.\" So it is in Sinhalese; sanda, \"moon,\" from Sanskrit chandra, is reduced to handa; pa\u00f1cha, \"five\" is pasa, and reduced further into paha; dasa, \"ten\" becomes daha. This ha is sometimes still further reduced in Sinhalese, by dropping it altogether and retaining only its inherent\nvowel, e.g., Sanskrit, \u0938\u094d\u0935, sayy\u00e1, \"bed\"; Pr\u00e1krit, sejja; Sinhalese, \u0936\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e, the first form of which seems to have been \u0936\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e, senda, then \u0936\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e, henda, and now \u0936\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e, enda.\n\n8. \u091c\u093e, ja, is often changed to \u0926\u093e, da; as \u0932\u093e\u091c\u093e, laja, \"parched grain,\" Sinhalese, \u0932\u093e\u091c\u093e, lada; \u091c\u093e\u0932\u093e, jala, \"net,\" Sinhalese, \u091c\u093e\u0932\u093e, d\u0113la.\n\n9. The Sanskrit conjunct consonant \u0917\u0941, gu\u1e47a, is changed in P\u00e1li to \u0928\u093e, n\u0101, which is changed in Sinhalese to \u0928, n; as \u0917\u0941\u0923\u093e, gu\u1e47\u0101na \"wisdom,\" P\u00e1li, \u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e, n\u0101na, Sinhalese, \u0928\u0928\u093e, nena, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0917\u0941\u0923\u093e, pragu\u1e47\u0101, \"wisdom,\" P\u00e1li, \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u093e, pa\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Sinhalese, \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u093e, p\u0113na.\n\n10. \u0905, a, and \u0930, r, are changed to \u0907, i, in Pr\u00e1krit; and Sinhalese adopts it, e.g., \u0938\u094b\u0932\u094b\u0938, solos, \"sixteen,\" for \u0938\u094b\u0932\u094b\u0938, sho\u1e37asa; \u0924\u0947\u0930\u093e\u0938, teles, \"thirteen,\" for \u0924\u0947\u0930\u093e\u0938, terasa; \u0905\u091f\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0938, atalos, \"eighteen,\" for \u0905\u091f\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0938, ath\u0101r\u016bsa. Sinhalese also changes \u0905, a, into \u0907, i, as \u0915\u0915\u0941\u0932\u093e, karkulaka, Sinhalese, \u0915\u0915\u0941\u0932\u093e, kakulu, \"crab.\"\n\n11. Pr\u00e1krit (in which is included P\u00e1li) always reduces conjunct consonants of different classes to one class: this is done by eliding one and doubling the other; \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, dharm\u0101, \"scriptures,\" is written \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, dhamma; \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935, a\u015bva, \"horse\" is written \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935, assa; \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0917, mudga, \"kidney beans,\" is \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0917, mugga; \u092a\u0942\u0923\u094d\u092f, punya, \"merit,\" is pu\u1e47ya, in Pr\u00e1krit, and \u092a\u0942\u0923\u094d\u092f, pu\u1e47ya in P\u00e1li; \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f, matsya, \"fish,\" is written \u092e\u091a\u094d\u091b, machchha. The Sinhalese still further reduces these to single consonants by eliding one of them; as \u0926\u092e, dam, or \u0926\u0939\u092e, daham, \"scriptures\"; \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935, as, \"horse;\" \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0917, mungu, \"kidney beans;\" \u092a\u0942\u0923\u094d\u092f, pin, \"merits\" \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f, masu, \"fish.\"\n\n12. In Pr\u00e1krit, consonants are elided in the middle or end of words, and sometimes in the beginning also; but in Sinhalese the hiatus thus occurring is avoided either by the coalition of the vowel or by the insertion of semi-vowels: thus, \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0932\u094b\u0915\u094d\u092f, trail\u014dkya, \"the three worlds,\" is in Pr\u00e1krit teloa, but in Sinhalese we find \u0924\u093f\u0932\u094b\u0930\u093e, tilora. Here we have the semi-vowel \u0909, u, inserted between the vowels o and a. For the Sanskrit nabha\u1e6d\u1e6dala, \"sky,\" we find in Pr\u00e1krit naha\u1e6d\u1e6dala, where both the b and the nexus st are lost. The Sinhalese avoids the\naspirate eliding the first letter of the conjunct consonant, and we get \u0928\u0941\u092c\u093e\u0932\u093e, nubatala.

The Sinhalese sound \u0936\u093f, \u0161, comes into play when a long \u0905, \u0101, or \u090f, \u0113, is shortened, or a nexus preceded by \u0905, a, is elided, e.g., \u0906\u0936\u093e\u0927\u093e, \u00e1sh\u00e1dha, \u201cname of a month (June and July),\u201d \u0905\u0938\u0932\u093e, asala; \u092e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u093e, makshik\u00e1, \u201cfly,\u201d \u092e\u0947\u0938\u0940, mes\u012b, hastin, \u201celephant,\u201d \u0936\u0924\u0940, \u015bat\u012b, et; \u0936\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0940, shashti, \u201csixty,\u201d \u0939\u0947\u0924\u093e, heta. It is also a substitute for \u090f, e, as \u0935\u0947\u0932\u0940, velli, \u201ccreeper.\u201d Sinhalese \u0936\u093f, \u0161i, vel. Though in Beng\u00e1li and other vernaculars of India there is no letter corresponding to the Sinhalese \u0936\u093f, yet Mr. Beames says:\u2014\u201cIn some instances in Beng\u00e1li the vowel \u090f, e, has a short harsh sound, like that of English a in ha. Thus ek, \u201cone,\u201d sounds yak or ack.\u201d This is just what the Sinhalese \u0936\u093f, \u0161i, is: the vowel changes entirely depend upon the preceding or succeeding vowels of a word.\n\nThe following examples will show that a large number of words with slight modifications, is common to all.

Beyond 10 a modified form of the Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed decimal numeration is that in common use. Some confusion, however, arises from the co-existence of the two systems; thus, *jansas* or *jans\u00e1s* may be either 48 or 50; *hiya* or *sat\u00e9ka*, 96 or 100.\" (\"The M\u00e1ldive Islands,\" Sessional Papers, Ceylon, 1881, p. 121.)\n\nMr. Albert Gray in giving the M\u00e1ldive numerals recorded by Pyrard with their Sinhalese equivalents, adds in a foot note:\u2014\"After this number Pyrard has the following:\u2014Note that they have the numbers up to twelve (as we have them up to ten): then they go on by twelves, and their hundred is 96, or eight times 12.\" It will be seen by the numbers which follow that those only which are correct according to Sinhalese enumeration are compounds of *dolos*, viz., *tin dolos*, *passedolos*, and *addolos*. They are simply, 'three dozen', 'five dozen,' and 'seven dozen.' On the other hand, those which are not compounds of *dolos* are altered values of the ordinary Sinhalese decimal numbers. Yet it is strange that Pyrard could make mistakes with numbers so low as 'twenty-four' and 'forty-eight' which by analogy ought to be *dedolos* and *h\u00e1radolos*...... It seems that the M\u00e1ldivians count much by dozens; indeed, Christopher (Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. 1836-8, p. 69) says,\n\n* Mr. Ransigha's paragraph (p. 241) on M\u00e1ldive numerals justifies this note.\u2014B. Hon. Sec.\n'they reckon by twelves, as we do by tens;' but they have not abandoned altogether the decimal system. If, however, passee and panas really stand for 'twenty-four' and 'forty-eight,' it will be interesting to know the Maldive for 'twenty' and 'fifty.'\u201d (Journ. R. A.

From the swift rise of the Muhammadan power in the seventh century down to the arrival of Vasco di Gama at Calicut in 1498, the trade of Europe with the East was in the hands of the Arabs. The carrying to Europe was done by their ships, but in the Indian seas a vast coast trade was developed by all the nations of the Indian sea-bord\u2014Persians, the races of India, Ceylon, the Eastern Islands and China. After the rounding of the Cape followed in succession the restrictive monopolies of the Portuguese, Dutch, and English, and the Eastern nations have never regained the great and free international commerce of the Arab days.\n\nFrom the story of Ibn Bat\u00fata, one comes to understand how it was possible for a native of Tangiers in the fourteenth century to travel, with but little difficulty, for twenty-four years over every country between Morocco and China. The Muhammadan faith had been spread over a great part of India, and had established a footing in China: Arab merchants were everywhere: and ships were never long in demand for voyages from any one port to any other.\nIbn Bat\u00fata was born at Tangiers in 1304, and died at Fez 1377\u20138. The following summary of his travels of twenty-four years (1325 to 1349) is given by Dr. Birdwood of the India Office. From Tangiers he travelled across Africa to Alexandria, and in Palestine, Syria, and Arabia: down the east coast of Africa to Quilon; across the Indian Ocean to Muscat, Ormuz, Kish, Bahrain and El Catif; through Central Arabia to Mecca and Jeddah; and again in Egypt and Asia Minor, and across the Black Sea to Caffa or Theodosia, and by Azov or Tana \u2018on past the hills of the Russians\u2019 to Bolgar on the Volga\u2014but not daring to penetrate further northwards into \u2018the land of Darkness.\u2019 Returning south to Haj-Tarkhan (Astrakhan) he proceeded in the suite of the wife of the Khan of Kipchah, the daughter of the Greek Emperor Andronicus, westward to Soldaia and Constantiniah (Constantinople), whence returning to Bolgar he travelled on eastward to Bokhara, and through Khoresman to Cabul, Multan, and Delhi where he remained eight years (1334-42). Being sent on an embassy to China he embarked at Kin-baiat (Cambay), and after many adventures at Calicut (where he was honorably received by the \u2018Samari\u2019 or Zamorin) and Humwar (Onore), and in the M\u00e1ldiv\u00e9 Islands (beginning of 1343-August, 1344) and Ceylon and Bengal, he at last took his passage toward China in a junk bound for Java, as he calls it, but in fact Sumatra. Returning from China, he sailed direct from the coast of Malabar to Muscat and Ormuz: and travelling by Shiraz, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Damascus and for the fourth time to Mecca, Egypt, Tunis, at last reached Fez again, after an absence of half his life-time. Subsequently he spent six years in Spain and Central Africa, where he was the guest of the brother of a countryman of his own from Ceutra, whose guest he had been in China. \u201cWhat an enormous distance lay between these two!\u201d he exclaims.\n\nThe first detailed account of his book was published in Europe only in 1808. Moura in 1845 commenced a translation in Portuguese of a copy obtained at Fez at the end of last century. The abridgment translated by Lee was brought from the east by Burckhart. It was not till the French conquest of Algeria that the best and completest texts were obtained. Five are in the Imperial Library at Paris, only two of which are perfect. From these M. M. Defr\u00e9mery and Sanguineti made their translation for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique: and it is from their version that the present account of the M\u00e1ldives and Ceylon visits has been extracted. His description of the M\u00e1ldives is the most interesting and complete in existence, excepting only that of Pyrard de Laval.\nIbn Bat\u016bta\n\nIn\n\nThe M\u00e1ldives and Ceylon.*\n\nI resolved to go to the Dh\u012bbat Almahal (the M\u00e1ldives) of which I had heard much. Ten days after we had embarked at Calicut we arrived at the Dh\u012bbat Almahal islands. Dh\u012bbat is pronounced as the feminine of Dh\u012bb (Arabic for \"wolf\": it is really an alteration of the Sanskrit douipa, \"island\"). These islands are among the wonders of the world: they number about 2,000.\u2020 A hundred or less of these islands lie together in a circle in the form of a ring: the group has an entrance as to a harbour, and ships get through by that alone. When a ship arrives near one of these islands it must of necessity have a pilot from among its natives, so that it may reach the other islands under his guidance. They are so close to each other that the tops of the palms which grow on one seem to belong to its neighbour.\u2021 If the vessel misses its way it cannot reach the islands, and is driven by the wind to Ma\u2019bar coast of Coromandel) or towards Ceylon.\n\n* Voyages d'Ibn Batoutah, par C.

S., 1878, Vol. X. n. s., pp. 196\u20147, notes 2, 3; and The M\u00e1live Islands\" (Ceylon Sessional Papers, 1881), pp. 3, 4, 5, Notes (1) i)\u2014B.\n\n\u2021 So too more recent travellers:\u2014\"The Malabares say that heretofore they ere joyn\u2019d to the Continent, and were separated by the sea, which in some places hath left such narrow divisions that an active man might leap from one to the other\" (Mondelso's Travels into the Indies, 1639. Lib. II. 116. London, 162). \"But that which makes them so numerous is the multitude of canals that divide them; which are so narrow that the sprit-sails of the ships strike the leaves of the trees which are planted on both sides. And in some places a nimble man may leap into an island from the top of a bough that grows in another.\"\u2014(Collection of Voyages of the Dutch East-India Company, p. 131. London, 1703)\u2014B.\nAll the inhabitants of these islands are Musalmans, pious and honest people. They are divided into regions or zones, each of which is ruled by a governor called Cordouiy. Among these zones the following are distinguished: (1) the zone of P\u00e2lipour; (2) Cannalou\u00efs; (3) Mahal, the province after which all the islands are called, and at which their sovereigns reside; (4) T\u00e9l\u00e9dib; (5) Car\u00e2idou\u00ef; (6) Te\u00efm; (7) T\u00e9l\u00e9dommety; (8) H\u00e9l\u00e9dommety, the name differing from the preceding only by having its first letter an h: (9) B\u00e9r\u00e9idou\u00ef; (10) Candacal; (11) Molou\u00efc; (12) Souwe\u00efd. The last is the most distant of all.* All the Maldivian islands are destitute of grain, except that in the province\n\n* The French editors identify these names with those given by Pyrard as follows:\u2014\u2018P\u00e2lipour\u2019\u2014\u2018Padypolo\u2019: Mahal\u2014\u2018Mal\u00e9\u2019: Car\u00e2idou\u00ef\u2014\u2018Caridou\u00ef\u2019: T\u00e9l\u00e9dommety\u2014\u2018Tilla dou matis\u2019: H\u00e9l\u00e9dommety\u2014\u2018Milla doue madoue\u2019: B\u00e9r\u00e9idou\u00ef\u2014\u2018Poulisdous\u2019: Molou\u00efc\u2014\u2018Molucque\u2019: Souwe\u00efd\u2014\u2018Souadou.\u2019 The Cannalouis of Ibn Bat\u00fbta, they add, is perhaps the \u2018Collomadous\u2019 of Pyrard, or, as Horsburgh writes it, \u2018Colomandous.\n\n[\u2018The majority of the above \u2018are easily recognisable,\u2019 but five (viz., Cannalouis, T\u00e9l\u00e9dib, Te\u00efm, H\u00e9l\u00e9dommety, and Candacal) present more difficulty,\u2014some, indeed, being shaped, more Arabico, out of all but unsatisfactory conjectural recognition.\n\n\u201cAs regards H\u00e9l\u00e9dommety, the French translators would appear to be at fault. It may perhaps with more reason be taken as equivalent to Hela-du(m)-mati (S. hela, \u2018white,\u2019 or even sela, = Jav. sela, \u2018rock\u2019 + d\u00e9va, \u2018island\u2019 + matu-pita, \u2018above\u2019) passing by contraction into Had-dummatti. Add\u00e9 may similarly be a contracted form of Hela-d\u00fa or Hulu-d\u00fa\u2014the name of one of the islands in that Atol.\n\n\u201cIf it be open to question the orthography of the MS. and, supposing an error of the copyist, read Nelddib for T\u00e9l\u00e9dib\u2014it and a are not unlike in Arabic\u2014it can be at once fitted to Nilandu Atol. Even accepting the received form as correct, the identification may possibly be not considered too far-fetched. Cf. Tojaree = ? Nausdri; Accanee and Kaluftee islands\u2019 (Lakkadive group) = Aucutta, Kalpeni. Adm. Chart. (Col. Yule in Indian Antiquary, Vol. III., pp. 212-4 on \u201cNames in the Tohfat-al Majahidin.\u201d).\n\n\u201cTo attempt to twist the rest into probable coincidence with the modern names of the remaining Atols seems hopeless. But the identification of Car\u00e2idou\u00ef with Caridou (Kaharid\u00fa)\u2014if accepted\u2014suggests a likely clue to their origin. Admitting that this island\u2014now-a-days of comparative insignificance\nof *Soweid* there is a cereal like the *anly* (*a kind of millet*) which is brought thence to *Mahal.* The food of the natives consists of a fish like the *lyro\u00fbn*, which they call *koulb alm\u00e2s*. Its flesh is red: it has no grease, but its smell resembles that of mutton. When caught at the fishing, each fish is cut up into four pieces, and then slightly cooked: it is then placed in baskets of coco leaves and suspended in smoke. It is eaten when perfectly dry. From this country it is exported to India, China and Yaman.

The nature of the coconut is marvellous. One of these palms produces each year twelve crops, one a month. Some are small, others large: many are dry [yellow], the rest are green and remain always so. From the fruit is obtained milk, oil, and honey, as we have said in the first part of this book. With the honey is made pastry, which they eat with the dried coconut. All the food made from the coconut, and the fish eaten at the same time effect an extraordinary and unequalled vigor in manhood.\n\nAmong the remarkable trees of these islands are the tchou-mo\u00efn (Eugenia Jambu) the lemon, the lime and the colocasia. From the root of the last named, the natives prepare a flour with which they make a kind of vermicelli, and this they cook in coco milk; it is one of the most agreeable dishes in the world. I had a great taste for it and ate it often.*\n\nOf the Inhabitants of these Islands and some of their Customs: Description of their Dwellings.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Maldivian islands are honest and pious people, sincere in good faith and of a strong will: they eat only what is lawful, and their prayers are granted. When one of them meets another, he says \u201cGod is my lord: Muhammad is my prophet: I am a poor ignorant being.\u201d In body they are weak and have no aptitude for combat or for war, and their arms\n\n*\u201cThe island [Mal\u00e9] produces \u2026\u2026\u2026 a bulb in shape and appearance much resembling an ordinary potatoe, but having a pungent flavor. This the natives grate down, and steep in water for some time to deprive it of the unpleasant taste, and dry it afterwards, when it looks very much like flour, and is very palatable\u201d (Christopher and Young in Trans. Bombay, Geographical Society, 1836-38, p. 80). Without doubt the yam called by Maldivians hittole (Pyrard, itsipoul, \u201can edible root which grows in abundance, round and large as the two fists\u201d) and probably identical with the hiritale (Dioscorea oppositifolia) of the Sighalose\u2014B.\nare prayers. One day in this country, I ordered the right hand of a robber to be cut off; upon which many of the natives in the hall of audience fainted away. The Indian pirates do not attack them, and cause them no alarm, for they have found that whoever takes anything of theirs is struck with a sudden calamity. When a hostile fleet comes to their shores, they seize what strangers they find, but do no harm to the natives. If an idolater appropriates anything, if it be but a lime, the chief of the idolaters punishes him and beats him severely, so much does he fear the results of such an action. Were it otherwise, certainly these people would be a most contemptible foe in the eyes of their enemies, because of the weakness of their bodies. In each of their islands there are fine mosques, and most of their buildings are of wood.\n\nThe islanders are good people: they abstain from what is foul, and most of them bathe twice a day, and properly too, on account of the extreme heat of the climate and the abundance of perspiration. They use a large quantity of scented oils, such as sandal-wood oil, &c., and they anoint themselves with musk from Makdachaou.* It is one of their customs, when they have said the morning prayer, for every woman to go to meet her husband or son with the collyrium box, rose-water and musk oil. He smears his eye-lashes with collyrium, and rubs himself with rose-water and musk oil, and so polishes the skin and removes from his face all trace of fatigue.\n\nThe clothing of these people consists of cloths. They wrap one round their loins in place of drawers, while on their backs they wear the stuffs called alouilyan \u2020 which resemble the ihr\u00e2m\n\n* Makdachaou:\u2014? Madagascar. [Rather Magadozo on the Zanzibar coast, which Ibn Batuta had visited (Tome II., 181.) \"After leaving Zaila we sailed on the sea for fifteen days, and arrived at Makdachaou an extremely large town.\"\u2014See Yule's Marco Polo. Vol. II., p. 347\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Alouilyan\u2014ouilyan (p. 120):\u2014A probable corruption of M. f\u00e9liya, (cf.: S. valu, pili, 'clothes') the term for the kambaya (8) or waist cloth worn by Maldivian women commonly and by soldiers on special occasions. The Maldivian equivalent for the ihr\u00e2m is known as digu lib\u00e1s\u2014B.\n(clothes worn by the Musalm\u00e1ns during the pilgrimage). Some wear the turban, others supply its place with a little kerchief. When any one meets the K\u00e1dh\u00ed or the preacher, he takes his garment off his shoulders, and uncovers his back, and so accompanies the functionary till he arrives at his place of abode. Another of their customs is this\u2014when one of them marries, and goes to the house of his wife, she spreads cotton cloths from the house door to that of the (nuptial) chamber: on these cloths she places handfuls of cowries on the right and left of the path he has to follow, while she herself stands awaiting him at the door of the apartment. On his arrival she throws over his feet a cloth which his attendants take up. If it is the wife* who goes to the husband\u2019s house, that house is hung with cloths, and cowries are placed thereon: and the woman on her arrival throws the cloth over his feet. And this is also the custom of the islanders when they salute the sovereign, they must without fail be provided with a piece of cloth to cast down at the moment, as we shall hereafter describe.\n\nTheir buildings are of wood\u2020 and they take care to raise the floor of their houses some height above the ground, by way of precaution against damp, for the soil of their islands is damp. This is the method they adopt: they cut the stones, each of which is of two or three cubits long, and place them in piles then they lay across these beams of the coco-tree, and afterwards raise the walls with boards. In this work they show marvellous skill. In the vestibule of the house they construct an apartment which they call m\u00e2lem,\u2021 and there the master of the house\n\n* It appears from this passage that the two kinds of Siphalese marriage, bina and daga, were in vogue at the M\u00e1ldives. [Both forms are said to be recognised still\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Even at the present day there is but one stone or brick built private house at M\u00e2l\u00e9 (Sultan\u2019s Island)\u2014B.\n\n\u2021 Malem. \u201cA partition near the middle divides the house into two rooms, one of which is private, and the other open to all visitors.\u201d (Trans. Bombay Geographical Society, 1836\u20138, p. 59.) The public room is called b\u00e9ru-g\u00e9 and the private or women\u2019s apartment \u00e9teri-g\u00e9, or in the Southern Atolls m\u00e1val-g\u00e9\u2014B.\nsits with his friends. This room has two doors, one opening on the vestibule by which strangers are introduced, the other on the side of the house by which the owner enters. Near the room in question is a jar full of water [?] and a bowl called ou\u00e9lendi* made of the coconut shell. It has a handle of [only] two cubits, wherewith to draw the water from the wells, by reason of their little depth.\n\nAll the inhabitants of the M\u00e1ldives, be they nobles or the common folk, keep their feet bare. The streets are swept and well kept: they are shaded by trees, and the passenger walks as it were in an orchard. Albeit every person who enters a house is obliged to wash his feet with water from the jar placed near the m\u00e1lem, and rub them with a coarse fabric of lif\u2020 (stipulae which envelope the base of the stalks of the date-palm leaves) placed there: after which he enters the house. Every person entering a mosque does the same. It is a custom of the natives when a vessel arrives for the canddir (in the singular cundurah)\u2021 i.e., the little boats to go out to meet it, manned by the people of the island and bearing some betel and caranbah \u00a7 that is to say, green coconuts. Each presents some of these to whom he will of those on board the ship, and then becomes his host carrying to his own house the goods belonging to him, as if he were one of his near relations. Any one of the new-comers who wishes to marry, is at liberty to do so. When the time comes for his departure, he repudiates his wife, for the people of the M\u00e1ldives do not leave their country. As for a man who does not marry,\n\n---\n\n* Ou\u00e9lendi:\u2014These cocoanut bowls with long handles (M. d\u00f3ni, but cf.: S. velanda \u201cchatty\u201d) are regularly used by the Islanders for drawing water.

Gundara-kiray\u00f3) and their boats (M. d\u00f3ni, odi).\u2014See too C. A. S. Jour.

In return she is contented to receive from him a very small present. The revenue of the treasury, which is called bender *(custom-house) consists in the right of buying a certain portion of all cargo on board ship, at a fixed price, whether the commodity be worth just that or more: this is called the bender law. The bender has in each island a house of wood called bedjens\u00e2r where the governor, the cordouery, (above it is written cordouiy)\u2020 collects all such goods: he sells or barter them. The natives buy with chickens any pottery which may be brought: a pot fetches five or six chickens.\n\nShips export from the islands the fish of which I have spoken, coconuts, fabrics, the ouliy\u00e2n and turbans: these last are of cotton. They export also vessels of copper, which are very common there, cowries\u2021 and kanbar\u00a7, such is the name of the\n\n* Bender.\u2014See Pyrard, p. 231, \"bandery\": cf. Sin. bandh\u00e2ra. The system of raising revenue here described was still in force in Pyrard's day (Pyrard, chap. xvii.), and seems to be identical in principle with the 'culture system,' employed by the Dutch in Java, where it is supposed to have been invented by one of the Dutch governors subsequent to the English occupation. [Each Atol has its own storehouse (v\u00e2ru-g\u00e2) into which the revenues of the Sultan are received, and whence they are transferred from time to time to the Treasury (boqu bad\u00e9ri-ge, cf : S. bh\u00e2ndag\u00e2rika) at M\u00e2l\u00e9.\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Cordouery, cordouiy.\u2014\"The Atol-wari [Atolu-veri or V\u00e2ru-veri; Pyrard 'varuery'] is a governor or chief of a division of islands called an Atol ......

The Rarhu-wari [Rarhu-veri] or headman of an island, stands in the same relation to the Atol-wari; as the latter does to the Hindegeree, in respect to the revenue.\" (Trans. Bombay Geo.

The natives make it undergo a preparation in pits dug near the shore: then they beat it with picks, after which the women work it into rope. They make of it cord for joining the boards of their ships, and such cordage is exported to China, India and Yemen. Kanbar rope is worth more than hemp. With this cord the (boards of) ships are joined in India and Yemen, for the Indian sea is full of rocks, and if a ship joined with iron bolts strikes a rock, it is broken up: but when it is fastened with this cord it has elasticity, and does not break.\n\nThe money of the islanders consist of cowries. This is the name of a creature (a mollusc), collected in the sea and placed in pits dug out on the beach. Its flesh decays and there remains only the white shell. A hundred of these shells is called sy\u0101h, and 700, f\u0101l; 12,000 are called cotta, and 100,000 bost\u014d\u016b. Bargains are struck through the medium of these cowries, at the rate of four bost\u014d\u016b to a din\u0101r of gold. Often they are of less value, such as twelve bost\u014d\u016b to a din\u0101r.* The islanders sell them to the people of Bengal for rice, for they too use them for money. They are sold in the same way to the people of Yemen, who use them for ballast in their ships in place of sand. These cowries serve also as a medium of exchange with the negroes in their native country. I have seen them sold, at M\u0101ly and at Djoudjou, at the rate of 1,150 to a din\u0101r of gold.\u2020\n\nThe Women of the Maldives.\n\nThe women of these islands do not cover the head: the sovereign herself does not so.

[Cowries are usually sold in the Islands by the hiya = 100, the f\u0101l = 800 to 1,000, and the koff\u00e9 = 12,000 (b\u0101ra-f\u0101.) A koff\u00e9 is not now worth more than Rs. 1 at M\u0101l\u00e9.\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 M\u0101ly; Djoudjou:\u2014Two places in the Soud\u00e1n, afterwards visited by the traveller.\nup on one side [of the head.] Most of them wear only a cloth, covering them from the navel to the ground: the rest of the body remains uncovered. In this costume they promenade the bazars and elsewhere. While I was invested with the dignity of K\u00e1z\u00ed in these islands, I made efforts to put an end to this custom, and to compel the women to clothe themselves: but I could not succeed. No woman was admitted to my presence in the trial of a case, unless she had her whole body covered: but, saving that, I had no power over the usage.* Some women wear, besides the cloth, chemises with short and full sleeves. I had some young female slaves whose dress was the same as that of the women of Delhi. They covered the head: but that disfigured rather than embellished their appearance, as they were not used to it.\n\nThe ornaments of the M\u00e1ldiv\u00e9 women consist of bracelets: each has a certain number on both arms, indeed, so that the whole of the arm from the wrist to the elbow is covered. These trinkets are of silver: only the wives of the Sultan and his nearest relatives wear bracelets of gold. The M\u00e1ldiv\u00e9 women have also khalkh\u00e1l (anklets) called by them b\u00e1il, and collars of gold round the neck, called besdered.\u2020 One of their curious customs is to engage themselves as house servants, in consideration of a fixed sum, which does not exceed five pieces of gold. Their board is at the expense of those who hire them. They do not regard this as a disgrace, and most of the daughters of the inhabitants do it. You will find in the house of a rich man ten or twenty of them. The cost of all dishes broken by one of these maids is charged against her. When she wishes to go from one house to another, the masters of the latter give her the amount of her debt, this she remits to the people of the house she is\n\n* Pyrard, 3rd ed., pp. 82, 124, says that all women in his time carefully kept the breasts covered.

Most of the men say nothing about a nuptial gift, contenting themselves with declaring their profession of the Musalm\u00e1n faith, and a nuptial gift in conformity to the law is given. When ships arrive, those on board take wives, and repudiate them on their departure: it is a kind of temporary marriage. The M\u00e1l\u00e9ive women never leave their country. I have never seen in the world women whose society is more agreeable. Among the islanders, the wife entrusts to no one the care of her husband\u2019s service: she it is who brings him his food, takes away when he has eaten, washes his hands, presents the water for his ablutions, and covers his feet when he wills to go asleep. It is one of their customs that the wife never eats with her husband, and that he does not know what his wife eats. I married in that country many wives: some ate with me at my request: others did not, and I could not succeed in seeing them take their food, and no ruse to get a sight was of any avail.\n\nThe story of the motive for the conversion of the inhabitants of these Islands to Isl\u00e1m: Description of the Evil Spirits who wrought harm to them every month.\n\nTrustworthy men among the inhabitants, such as the\n\n* Regarding these servants (M. femus\u00e9ri), who are still employed, Mr. Gray (J.

He resembled a ship full of lamps. The custom of the natives, as soon as they perceived him, was to take a young virgin, to adorn her, and conduct her to a boudkh\u00e2nah,\u2020 i.e., an idol temple, which was built on the sea shore and had a window by which she was seen. They left her there during the night and returned in the morning: then they found the young girl dishonored and dead. They failed not every month to draw lots, and he upon whom the lot fell gave up his daughter. At length arrived among them a Maghrabin\u2021 called Abou\u2019lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t, the Berber, who knew by heart the glorious Kur\u00e1n. He was lodged in the house of an old woman of the island Mahal. One day he visited his hostess and found that she had assembled her relatives, and that the women were weeping as if they were at a funeral. He questioned them upon the subject of their affliction, but they could not make him understand the cause. An interpreter coming in informed him that the lot had fallen upon the old woman and that she had one only daughter, who had to be slain by the evil Jinni. Abou\u2019lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t said to the woman:\n\n* I\u00e7a Alyamany:\u2014i.e.,? Is\u00e1 Falliy\u00e1 Maniku.

Christopher gives budu as the modern M\u00e1l\u0111ive for \u201cimage\u201d (J.R.A.S., Vol. VI., o.a., p. 57). But the word bodd seems to have been a general term for an image with the Arab Oriental travellers, and may only indicate that the Buddhist parts of India were the first visited by the Arabs.\u2014Journ. As, 1845, p. 167. Ibn Bat\u00fata elsewhere says that the Jama Masjid of Delhi was built upon the sight of a former Boudkh\u00e1nah he does not therefore mean to imply that the word was M\u00e1l\u0111ive.

He was conducted the night following to the idol temple after he had done his ablutions. There he set himself to recite the Kur\u00e1n, then by the window he perceived the demon, and continued his recitation. As soon as the Jinn\u00ed came within hearing of the Kur\u00e1n, he plunged into the sea; and when the dawn was come, the Maghrabin was still occupied in reciting the Kur\u00e1n. The old woman, her relatives and the people of the island came to take away the girl, according to their custom, and to burn the corpse. They found the stranger reciting the Kur\u00e1n, and conducted him to their King, by name Ch\u00e9nour\u00e1zah,* whom they informed of this adventure. The King was astonished: the Maghrabin proposed to him to embrace Isl\u00e1m, and inspired him with a desire for it. Then said Ch\u00e9nour\u00e1zah to him:\u2014\"Remain with us till next month, and if you do again as you have just done and escape the evil Jinn\u00ed, I will be converted.\" The stranger remained with the idolaters and God disposed the heart of the King to receive the true faith. He became Musalm\u00e1n before the end of the month, as well as his wives, children and court. At the beginning of the following month the Maghrabin was conducted to the idol-temple; but the demon came not, and the Berber recited the Kur\u00e1n till the morning, when the Sultan and his subjects arrived and found him so employed. Then they broke the idols, and razed the temple to the ground. The people of the island embraced Isl\u00e1m, and sent messengers to the other islands, whose inhabitants were also converted. The Maghrabin remained among them, and enjoyed their high esteem. The natives made profession of his doctrine, which was that of the Im\u00e1n M\u00e1l\u00edc. Even at present they respect the Maghrabins for his sake. He built a mosque, which is known by his name. I have also read the following inscription graven in wood on the enclosed pulpit of the\n\n* Ch\u00e9nour\u00e1zah:\u2014Cf. S. Senarat \"King (Chief Commander) of the army\" and Seneviratha 'the gem-like General.'\u2014B.\ngrand mosque: \"Sultan Ahmed Ch\u00e9no\u00fbr\u00e2zak has received the true faith at the hands of Abou\u2019lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t the Berber, the Maghrabin.\" This Sultan assigned a third of the taxes of the islands as alms to travelling foreigners in recognition of his reception of Isl\u00e1m through their agency. This share of the taxes still bears a name which recalls this event.\n\nOwing to the demon in question many of the M\u00e1l\u0111ive islands were depopulated before their conversion to Isl\u00e1m. When I reached the country I was not aware of this matter. One night, when I was at one of my occupations, I heard of a sudden people crying with loud voice the formul\u00e6, \"There is no God but God\" and \"God is very great.\" I saw children carrying Kur\u00e1ns on their heads, and women rapping the insides of basins and vessels of copper. I was astonished at their conduct and said \"What is happening\"? and they replied \"Do you not see the sea\"? Upon which I looked and saw a kind of large ship, seemingly full of lamps and chafing-dishes. They said to me \"that is the demon; he is wont to show himself once a month: but when once we have done as you have seen, he turns back and does us no harm.\"\n\nOF THE QUEEN OF THESE ISLANDS.\n\nOne of the marvels of the M\u00e1ldives is that they have for their Sovereign a woman, by name Khadidjah, daughter of the Sultan Dj\u00e9l\u00e2l eddin \u2019Omar, son of the Sultan Sal\u00e2h eddin S\u00e2lih Albendj\u00e2ly. The kingdom had at one time been possessed by her grandfather, then by her father, and when the latter died, her brother, Chih\u00e2d eddin, became King. He was a minor, and the Vizier \u2019Abd Allah, son of Mohammed Alhadhramy\n\n* Vestiges of this romantic legend of their conversion to Muhammadanism live in the traditions of the Islanders to this day. But with more probability, they assign to a Shaikh Y\u00fbs\u00fbp Shams-ud-d\u00een of Tabrij the honour, which Ibn Bat\u00fbta not unnaturally would claim for a Maghrabin, and the votaries of Hazrat Mir\u00e2 Sah\u00eeb for the N\u00e1g\u00fbr saint (C.A.S. Journ., No. 24, pp.125\u201336 1881). Their first royal convert to Isl\u00e1m the M\u00e1ldivians commonly know as \"Darimavanta (= S. Dharmmavanta, i.e., 'the Just') Rasgej\u00e2nu.\" The mosque he built still stands, and continues to bear his name.\u2014B,\nespoused his mother and assumed authority over him. He is the same personage who married the Sultana Khadidjah after the death of her first husband, the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l edd\u00edn, as we shall describe hereafter. When Chih\u00e1b edd\u00edn attained full age he ousted his step-father 'Abd Allah and banished him to the islands of Souweid. He was then left in sole possession, and chose as Vizier one of his freedmen by name 'Aly Calaky,* whom he deposed at the end of three years and banished to Souweid. It is related of the Sultan Chih\u00e1b edd\u00edn that he consorted nightly with the wives of the public officers and with courtezans. On that account he was deposed and deported to the province of H\u00e9l\u00e9dout\u00e9ny (above spelt H\u00e9l\u00e9dommety): afterwards some one was sent and put him to death.\n\nThere then remained of the royal family only the sisters of the deceased, Kadidjah who was the eldest, Miryam and Fathimah. The natives raised Kadidjah to the throne, who was married to their preacher Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l edd\u00edn. The latter became Vizier and master of the situation\u2020 and promoted his son Mohammed to the office of Preacher in his own stead: but orders were promulgated only in the name of Khadidjah. These are traced on palm leaves by means of an iron [style] bent down resembling a knife. They write on paper only the Kur\u00e1ns and scientific treatises. The Preacher makes mention of the Sultana on Fridays and on other days [of public prayer]; and here are the terms used, \"O God, succour Thy servant, whom Thou hast in Thy wisdom preferred before other mortals, and whom Thou hast made the instrument of Thy mercy towards all Musalm\u00e1ns, namely, the Sultana Khadidjah Daughter of Sultan Dj\u00e9l\u00e1l edd\u00edn, son of Sultan Sal\u00e1h edd\u00edn.\"\n\nWhen a stranger comes among these people and repairs to the hall of audience, which is called d\u00e1r,\u2021 custom requires that he\n\n* 'Aly Calaky:\u2014i.e., 'Ali Kal\u00e9ge.

He makes obeisance before the Sultana and throws down one of these cloths. Then he salutes her Vizier, who is also her husband, Dj\u00e9mal eddin, and throws down the other. The army of this Queen consists of about a thousand men of foreign birth; some of the soldiers are natives. They come every day to the hall of audience to salute her and then go home. Their pay is in rice, supplied to them at the bender (v. s., p. 10) every month. When the month is ended, they present themselves at the audience hall, and, saluting the Vizier, say, \"Convey our respects (to the Queen) and inform her that we have come to request our pay.\" Thereupon the necessary orders are given in their favour. The K\u00e1z\u00ed and ministers, who have with the people the title of Viziers, also present themselves every day at the audience hall. They make a salutation, and go away after the eunuchs have transmitted their respects to the Queen.\n\nOF THE MINISTERS AND THEIR CONDUCT OF GOVERNMENT\n\nThe people of the M\u00e1ldives call the Grand Vizier, the Sultana's Lieutenant, Calaky*; and the K\u00e1z\u00ed Fandayark\u00e1lou.\u2020 All judgments are in the jurisdiction of the K\u00e1z\u00ed: he is more highly esteemed by the people than all other men, and his orders are executed as well as those of the Sultan and even better. He sits upon a carpet in the audience hall: he possesses three islands\u2021, whose revenue he places to his private account, after an ancient custom\n\n* Calaky:\u2014? Pers.

All these have the title of Vizier. There is no prison in these islands: criminals are shut up in wooden houses built to contain the merchants\u2019 goods. Each one is placed in a wooden cell, as we have (in Morocco) for the Christian prisoners.\n\nOf my arrival at these Islands and of the vicissitudes which I experienced there.\n\nWhen I came to this country I landed at Cannalo\u00fbs ||, an island fair to behold, where there are many mosques.

Papers, 1881, \u201cThe M\u00e2ldive Islands.\u201d\u2014B.\n\n|| Cannalo\u00fbs:\u2014As Ibn Bat\u00fbta here mentions an island of the same name above given to one of the \u201czones\u201d or atolls, the French editors are likely in error in identifying it with Collomandu atoll, there being no island in that\nat the house of one of the most pious inhabitants. The lawyer 'Aly gave me a feast. He was a distinguished person and had sons addicted to study. I saw there a man named Mohammed, a native of Zhafar Alhomoudh, who entertained me and said to me, \"If you set foot on the island of Ishal, the Vizier will forcibly detain you, for the people have no Kazi.\" It was then my intention to get away from that country to Ma'bar (Coromandel coast), to Serendib (Ceylon), to Bengal, and then to China. I had then arrived at the Maldives in a ship whose captain was 'Omar Alhinaoury, who was one of the virtuous pilgrims. When we had come into harbour at Cannalouis, he remained there ten days: then he hired a little barque to take him thence to Mahal, bearing a present for the Queen and her Consort. I wished to go with him, but he said, \"The barque is not big enough for you and your companions: if you like to set out without them, it is your affair.\" I declined this proposal, and 'Omar took his departure. But the wind was contrary (literally 'played with him') and at the end of four days he came back to us, not without having experienced trouble. He made his excuses to me, and implored me to go with him, my companions and all. We set sail in the morning and towards midday disembarked on an island: leaving that, we passed the night at another. After a four days cruise, we arrived at the province of Teim, the governor of which was one Hilal. He welcomed me, and gave me a feast: and afterwards came to visit me accompanied by four men, two of whom had on their shoulders a rod* from which were suspended four chickens. The other two had a similar rod to which were attached about ten coconuts. I was\n\n* M. daqimdrau\u2014the kalliya of the Sinhalese\u2014B.\n\nstoll of the name Cannalouis or one resembling it. It is unlikely too that Ibn Batuta coming from the north made his landing at a point so far south as Collomandu. The termination 'lous,' moreover or 'lu' seems in the modern names of the islands to be quite distinct from 'du.' [V.s., p. 5, for identification of this island with Kinajos in Malosmaadulu Atol. M. los = ? the bois sousou tree of the Chagos group: M. du = S. diva 'islet.'\u2014B.]\nsurprised that they thought so highly of these common objects: but was informed that they do this as a token of consideration and respect.*\n\nAfter leaving these people we landed on the sixth day at the island of Othm\u00e2n, a distinguished man and one of the best one could meet. He received us with honour and entertained us. On the eighth day we put into an island belonging to a Vizier named T\u00e9lemdy. On the tenth, we at length reached the island of Mahal, where the Sultana and her Consort reside, and cast anchor in the harbour. It is a custom of the country that no one may disembark without the permission of the inhabitants.\u2020 This was accorded to us: and I then desired to betake myself to some mosque, but the slaves on the beach prevented me, saying, \u201cIt is necessary that you should first visit the Vizier.\u201d I had requested the captain when he should be questioned about me to say, \u201cI know nothing of him\u201d; for fear lest they should detain me, being unaware that some ill-advised babbler had written to them an account of me, and that I had been K\u00e1zi at Delhi. On our arrival at the audience hall, we took our seats on benches at the third entrance door. The K\u00e1zi \u2019I\u00e7a Alyamany came up and welcomed me, while I saluted the Vizier. The ship captain lbr\u00e2him (above he is called \u2019Omar) brought ten pieces of worked stuffs, made a salute before the Queen, and threw down one of them: then he bent the knee in honor of the Vizier and threw down another, and so on to the last. He was questioned about me, and replied, \u201cI know nothing of him.\u201d\n\nWe were then presented with betel and rose-water which is a mark of honor with them. The Vizier gave us lodging in a house and sent us a repast consisting of a large bowl full of rice and surrounded with plates of salted meats dried in the sun, chickens, melted butter and fish. On the morrow I set out with the captain and the K\u00e1zi, \u2019I\u00e7a Alyamany to visit a hermitage\n\n* The Sinhalese penumkada or pinga of presents of sweetmeats, provisions, fruits, &c.\n\n\u2020 Enforced to this day\u2014B;\nsituated at the extremity of the island and founded by the virtuous Shaikh Nedjib.* We returned at night, and on the following morning the Vizier sent me some raiment, and a repast comprising rice, melted butter, salt, sun-dried meat, coconuts, and honey extracted from the same fruit, called by the natives korbany,\u2020 signifying 'sugar-water.' They brought me also 100,000 cowries for my expenses. After ten days there arrived a ship from Ceylon, having on board some Persian and Arab fakirs who knew me and told the servants of the Vizier all about me. This enhanced the pleasure given by my coming. He sent for me at the commencement of Ramaz\u00e1n. I found the Chiefs and Viziers already assembled: food was served at the tables, each of which accommodated a certain number of guests. The Grand Vizier made me sit by his side, in company of the K\u00e1z\u00ed 'Iqa, the F\u00e1med\u00e1r Vizier or Chief of the Treasury, and the Vizier 'Omar, the D\u00e9herd,\u2021 i.e., General of the army. The dinner of these islanders consists of rice, chickens, melted butter, fish, salt, sun-dried meat, and cooked bananas. After eating, they drink the coco honey mingled with aromatics, which facilitates digestion.\n\nOn the 9th of Ramaz\u00e1n, the son-in-law of the Vizier died. His wife, the daughter of that minister, had already been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e1b eddin: but neither of her husbands had cohabited with her on account of her youth. Her father, the\n\n* This old shrine (Najibu miskitu), it is said, may still be seen at M\u00e1l\u00e9.\u2014B.\n\u2020 Korbany:\u2014Probably ought to be 'hakorbany' equivalent to the Sighalese hakuru, 'jaggery': peni, 'honey,' the former word appearing as acourou for 'coco-honey' in the vocabulary of Pyrard.\n\u2021 D\u00e9herd.\u2014Cf. Pyrard, Darade Tacourou \"count or duke,\" and Chris, Dahara, 6th Vizier. \"As each incumbent of the first five Vizierships died no successor appears to have been appointed, and the titles thus gradually became extinct. That of the 6th Vizier alone survives in the person of the son of the former D\u00e1har\u00e1.....The D\u00e1har\u00e1 (Takuru-f\u00e1mu) has no specific department of public business to supervise. But for a certain voice in military and municipal affairs his office would be a titular sinecure.\" (The Maldiv\u00e9 Islande, Ceylon Sess. Pap. 1881). Cf: the Sighalese Dovarika (Mah\u00e1v. p.117, 11), but also the Persian Daroogha.\u2014B.\nVizier, took her back home, and gave me her house, which was one of the most charming. I asked permission to entertain the fak\u00edrs returning from visiting the Foot of Adam, in the island of Ceylon (see below). This he granted, and sent me five sheep, a rare animal with the islanders, having to be brought from Ma\u2019bar (Coromandel Coast) from Malabar and from Makdachaou. The Vizier sent me also rice, chickens, melted butter and spices. I had all these carried to the house of the Vizier Souleim\u00e1n, the M\u00e1ndyec (Admiral), who took the greatest care in having them cooked, augmented them in quantity, and sent me carpets and copper vessels. We broke the fast according to custom, in the palace of the Sultana, with the Grand Vizier, and I requested him to permit some of the other Viziers to assist at my dinner. He said \u201cI will come myself too.\u201d I thanked him and returned home: but he had already arrived with the Viziers and grandees of the State. He seated himself in a raised pavilion of wood. All who came, whether Chiefs or Viziers, saluted the Grand Vizier, and threw down a piece of unworked stuff, in such numbers that the total reached to a hundred or thereabouts, all of which the fak\u00edrs appropriated. Dinner was then served and eaten: then the readers of the Kur\u00e1n gave a reading with their fine voices, after which were singing and dancing. I had a fire prepared, and the fak\u00edrs then entered and trampled it under foot; some of them even ate the live embers, as one would devour sweetmeats, until the flame was extinguished.\n\nThe Story of Some of the Vizier\u2019s Bene-factions to Me.\n\nWhen the night was ended, the Vizier went home and I accompanied him. We passed a garden belonging to the Treasury, and the Vizier said to me, \u201cThis garden is for you: I will have a house built upon it to serve for your residence.\u201d I praised his kind action, and made vows in his favour. Next day he sent me a young female slave, and his messenger said, \u201cThe Vizier bids me say, if this girl pleases you, she is yours: otherwise he will\nsend a Mahratta slave.\u201d I liked the young Mahratta girls, so I replied \u201cI desire only the Mahratta,\u201d The minister had one brought to me, by name Gulistan, which signifies \u201cthe flower of the garden\u201d (or more exactly \u2018the parterre of flowers\u2019). She knew the Persian tongue, and pleased me highly. The Maldivian inhabitants have a language which I did not understand.\n\nThe next day, the Vizier sent me a young female slave from Coromandel by name Anbery (ambergris colour). On the following evening he came to my house with some of his servants, and entered attended by two little [boy] slaves. I saluted him, and he asked me how I did. I made vows for his welfare and thanked him. One of the slaves put before him a lokchah (bokchah),* that is, a kind of napkin, from which he drew some silk stuffs and a box containing pearls and trinkets. The Vizier made me a present of them, adding, \u201cIf I had sent these with the young slave, she would have said \u2018This is my property: I brought it from the house of my master.\u2019 Now that the things belong to you, make her a present of them.\u201d I addressed prayers to God for the minister, and rendered to him expressions of my gratitude, of which he was worthy.\n\nOF THE VIZIER\u2019S CHANGE OF DISPOSITION TOWARDS ME; OF THE PROJECT WHICH I FORMED TO DEPART; AND OF MY CONTINUED SOJOURN AT THE MALDIVES.\n\nThe Vizier Souleim\u00e2n, the Manayec, had proposed to me to espouse his daughter. I sent to ask the permission of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin to conclude the marriage. My messenger returned saying, \u201cIt does not please him; he wishes you to marry his daughter when the legal term of her widowhood shall have expired.\u201d I refused to consent to this union, fearing the sinister fortune attached to the daughter of the Vizier, since two husbands had already died without having consummated the marriage. In the midst of all this a fever seized me, and I was very ill.\n\n* Lokchah or bokchah:\u2014If the latter be the correct reading = ? burug\u00ee the cloth worn over the face at times by Maldivian ladies.\u2014B.\nEvery person who goes to that island must inevitably catch the fever.* I made a strong resolve to get out of the country: I sold a portion of my trinkets for cowries, and chartered a ship to take me to Bengal. When I went to take my leave of the Vizier, the K\u00e1z\u00ed coming out met me, and addressed me in these terms, \"The Vizier,\" said he, \"bids me tell you this 'If you wish to go away, give us back what we have given you and then go.'\" I replied, \"With a part of my trinkets I have bought cowries; do with them what you will.\" In a little while the K\u00e1z\u00ed returned to me and said, \"The Vizier says 'We have given you gold, not cowries,'\" I replied, \"Very well: I will sell them and will pay you gold.\" Accordingly I sent to request the merchants to buy the shells from me. But the Vizier gave them orders not to deal with me; for his design, in so conducting himself, was to prevent me going away from him.\n\nThen he deputed one of his intimates, who had this conversation with me, \"The Vizier bids me request you to remain with us and you shall have everything you desire.\" So I said to myself, \"I am under their authority: if I do not stay with a good grace, I shall have to stay by constraint: a voluntary sojourn is preferable to that.\" I therefore made reply to the envoy, \"Very well: I shall remain with him.\" The messenger returned to his master, who was delighted with my reply, and sent for me. When I entered his presence, he got up and embraced me, saying, \"We wish you to remain with us, and you wish to go!\" I made my excuses, which were accepted, and said, \"If you wish me to stay, I will impose upon you certain conditions.\" The Vizier replied, \"We accept them: please to name them.\" I answered, \"I am unable to walk on foot.\" For it is a custom of the country that\n\n* \"On la connoist par toute l' Inde sous le nom de fi\u00e9vre des Maldives. Ils l'appellent Mal\u00e9 ons [hun or huma]. C'est de cette maladie que la pluspart de mes compagnons estoient morts, comme tous estrangers ne manquent pas d'en estre bientost atteints,\" (Pyrard, p. 95; again p. 201). The Indian Navy Surveyors (1-6) suffered much from this pest of the group.\u2014B.\nno one rides on horseback, except the Vizier. So it was that when I had a horse* given to me, I was mounted, the crowd of men, as well as children, began to follow me with astonishment, whereof I complained to the Vizier. Accordingly a donkorah was beaten, and it was proclaimed among the people that no one should follow me. The donkorah is a kind of copper basin, which is struck with an iron rod [or hammer], and gives a noise heard afar. After it is struck, the crier cries in public whatever he required.\n\nThe Vizier said to me, \"If you wish to ride in a palaquin, well and good: otherwise we have a stallion and a mare: choose which of these animals you prefer.\" I chose the mare which was brought to me at once. At the same time some garments were brought to me. I said to the Vizier, \"What shall I do with the cowries which I have bought?\" He replied, \"Send one of your companions to sell them for you in Bengal.\" \"I will do so,\" said I, \"on condition that you send some one to help him in the affair.\" \"I will,\" he replied. So I despatched my comrade Abou Mohammed, son of Ferh\u00e1n, in whose company they sent one called the pilgrim 'Aly. But it happened that a storm arose: the crew jettisoned the whole cargo, including even the mast, the water, and all the other provisions for the voyage. They remained for sixteen days without sail, rudder, &c.; and after the endurance of hunger, thirst, and toil, they arrived at the end of Ceylon. In a year's time my comrade Abou Mohomed came back to me. He had visited the Foot (of Adam) and he afterwards saw it again with me.\n\nACCOUNT OF THE FESTIVAL IN WHICH I TOOK PART WITH THE ISLANDERS.\n\nThe month of Ramaz\u00e1n ended, the Vizier sent me some [proper] raiment, and we made our way to the place consecrated\n\n* In November, 1879, there were but two horses in the Islands, the property of the Sultan at Mal\u00e9, \"wretched wry-legged weeds, not fit to ride,\" and kept merely for show.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Donkorah.\u2014Ibn Bat\u00fata's ignorance of the M\u00e1ldivian language may possibly have led him to confuse dummarhi, the term for the 'flagiolet,' with ka 'gong.' The iron striker is called dadigadu.\u2014B.\nfor prayer. The path which the minister had to traverse, between his residence and the place of prayer, had been decorated: stuffs had been spread, and there had been placed to right and left heaps (literally cotta's, v. s., p. 11) of cowries. All the Emirs and grandees who had houses on the road had planted near them little coco-trees, arecas, and bananas. Ropes were hung from one tree to the next, and green nuts were suspended from the ropes. The master of the house remained near the gate, and when the Vizier passed, he threw before his feet a piece of silk or cotton. The slaves of the minister appropriated these, as well as the cowries placed by the way. The Vizier advanced on foot, covered with an ample robe of goat's hair of Egyptian manufacture, and with a large turban. As a scarf he wore a kerchief of silk; four umbrellas shaded his head, and sandals covered his feet. All his attendants without exception had their feet bare. Trumpets, clarions, and drums* preceded him: the soldiers marched before and behind him, all shouting the cry \"God is very great!\" until they were arrived at the place of prayer.\n\nPrayer ended, the son of the Vizier preached: then was brought a litter which the Vizier mounted. The Emirs and the other grandees again saluted him, casting down pieces of stuffs according to custom. Before this time the Grand Vizier used not to ride in a litter, for the Kings alone did so. The bearers then lifted it; I mounted my horse, and we entered the palace. The minister seated himself at a raised dais, having near him the Viziers and the Emirs. The slaves remained standing, bearing shields, swords, and staves.\u2020 Food was then served, and afterwards arecanuts and betel, after which was brought a little dish containing sandal mokassiry.\u2021 As soon as one party of the guests\n\n---\n\n* M. talafili; dummarhi; beru.\u2014B.\n\u2020 M addana; kaqi; daqi.\u2014B.\n\u2021 Mokassiry: =? M. kasturi 'musk.'\u2014B.\nhad eaten, they rubbed themselves with sandal. That day I saw upon one of their dishes a fish of the species of sardines, salted and raw, which had been sent as a present from Caoulem. This fish is very abundant on the Malabar Coast. The Vizier took a sardine, and began to eat it, at the same time saying to me, \"Eat some of that; it is not found in our country.\" I answered, \"How can I eat it? It is not cooked.\" \"It is cooked,\" said he. But I replied, \"I know this fish well, for it abounds in my native land.\"\n\nOF MY MARRIAGE AND OF MY NOMINATION TO THE DIGNITY OF K\u00c1ZI.\n\nOn the 10th day of Shaww\u00e1l I agreed with the Vizier Souleim\u00e1n M\u00e2n\u00e2yec, or Admiral, that I should espouse his daughter, and I sent to request the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin that the betrothal should take place in his presence at the palace. He agreed and sent betel, according to custom, and sandal. The people were present for the ceremony. The Vizier Souleim\u00e1n delayed his coming. He was sent for: and yet he came not. He was sent for a second time, and he excused himself on account of the illness of his daughter: but the Grand Vizier said to me in private, \"His daughter refuses to marry; and she is mistress of her own actions. But see! the people are assembled: would you like to espouse the step-mother of the Sultana, the widow of her father?\" (The Grand Vizier's son was then married to this woman's daughter). I replied \"Yes, by all means.\" He then convoked the K\u00e1zi and the notaries. The profession of the Musalm\u00e1n faith was then recited, and the Vizier paid the dowry. After some days my wife was brought to me. She was one of the best women who ever lived. Such was her good manners, that when I became her husband, she anointed me with scented oils and perfumed my clothes; during this operation she laughed and allowed nothing disagreeable to be seen.\n\nWhen I had married this lady, the Vizier constrained me to accept the functions of the K\u00e1zi. The cause of my nomina-\ntion was that I had reproached the K\u00e1z\u00ed for taking the tenth part of inheritances, when he made partition among the heirs. I said to him, \"You ought to have only a fee, which you should agree for with the heirs.\" This judge did nothing rightly. After I was invested with the dignity of K\u00e1z\u00ed, I used all my efforts to have the precepts of the law observed. Disputes are not settled in that country as in ours. The first bad custom which I reformed concerned the sojourn of divorced women at the houses of those who had repudiated them; for these women did not cease to remain at the houses of their former husbands, until they got married to others. I prevented this being done under any pretext. About five and twenty men were brought to me who had conducted themselves in this sort. I had them beaten with whips,* and had them marched through the baz\u00e1rs. As for the women, I compelled them to leave the homes of these men. Next I exerted myself to get prayers celebrated: I ordered some men to run down the streets and baz\u00e1rs immediately after the Friday's prayers. If any were discovered, who had not prayed, I had him beaten and marched through the town. I compelled the Im\u00e2ms and Mouezzins in possession of fixed appointments to apply themselves assiduously in their duties. I wrote in the same sense to (the magistrates of) all the other islands. Lastly I essayed to make the women dress themselves, but in this I did not succeed.\n\nOf the Arrival of the Vizier 'Abd Allah, son of Mohammed Alhadhramy whom Sultan Chihab Eddin had banished to Souweid: Account of what passed between us.\n\nI had espoused the step-daughter of this personage, and I loved this wife very dearly. When the Grand Vizier recalled him to the Island of Mahal, I sent him presents, went to meet\n\n* M. durra. Pyrard has gleau \"leathern thongs used for corporal punishment.\"\u2014B.\nhim, and accompanied him to the palace. He saluted the Grand Vizier, who lodged him in a magnificent house, and there I often visited him. It happened, when I passed the month of Ramaz\u00e1n in prayer, that all the inhabitants visited me, except 'Abd-Allah. The Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin himself came to see me, and 'Abd-Allah with him, but only bearing him company. Enmity arose between us. Afterwards when I came out of my retreat, the maternal uncles of my wife, the step-daughter of 'Abd-Allah made a complaint to me. They were the sons of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin Assindjary. Their father had appointed the Vizier 'Abd-Allah to be their guardian, and their property was still in his hands, although they had by the law emerged from wardship. They demanded his appearance in Court. It was my custom when I summoned one of the contending parties to send him a slip of paper, either with or without writing. On delivery of that the party repaired to the Court; if he did not, I punished him. In this way I sent a slip to 'Abd-Allah. This procedure raised his cholera, and on account thereof he conceived a hatred for me. He concealed his enmity and sent some one to plead for him. Some unseemly language was reported to me as having been used by him.\n\nThe islanders, both gentle and simple, were accustomed to salute the Vizier 'Abd-Allah in the same way as the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin. Their salutation consists in touching the ground with the forefinger, then kissing it, and placing it on the head. I issued orders to the public crier, and he proclaimed in the Queen's palace in the presence of witnesses, that whoever should render homage to 'Abd-Allah in like manner as to the Grand Vizier should incur severe chastisement. And I exacted from him a promise that he would not allow men to do so. His enmity against me was now increased. Meantime I married another wife, daughter of a highly esteemed Vizier, whose grandfather was the Sultan D\u00e1oud, the grand-son of the Sultan\nAhmed Ch\u00e9no\u00fbrdzah.* Then I married one who had been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e2b eddin, and I had three houses built in the garden which the Vizier gave to me. My fourth wife, the step-daughter of 'Abd-Allah, lived at her own house. She was the one of all my wives whom I cherished the most. Thus allied by marriage to the persons named, the Vizier and the people of the island feared me much, by reason of their own weakness. False reports were spread between me and the Grand Vizier, in great part by the care of the Vizier 'Abd-Allah, so that our estrangement became final.\n\nOF MY DEPARTURE FROM THESE PEOPLE, AND OF THE MOTIVE THEREOF.\n\nIt happened that one day the wife of a slave of the late Sultan Djel\u00e2l eddin made a complaint of him to the Vizier, to the effect that he had a liaison with one of the Sultan's concubines. The Vizier sent witnesses, who entered the girl's house and found the slave asleep with her upon the same carpet. Both were taken into custody. In the morning, on being informed of this, I went to the audience hall and took my seat in my customary place. I made no reference to the affair. A courtier then approached me and said, \"The Vizier requests to know if you have any business with him.\" I replied, \"No.\" The design of the minister was that I should speak of the affair of the concubine and the slave; for it was my invariable rule to decide every case which he put before me. But as I was showing him my dissatisfaction and dislike, I omitted to do so then. I went straightway to my own house and took my seat where I delivered my judgments. Soon after came a Vizier, saying on behalf of the Grand Vizier, \"Yesterday, so and so occurred in\n\n* This relationship fixes approximately the date of Ch\u00e9no\u00fbrdzah and of the Muhammedan conversion, which may have been as early as 1200 A.D., but\u2014allowing for early marriages\u2014perhaps more probably about 1220, or 1230 A.D.\u2014See Paper on the Maldives, J. R. A. S., Vol. X., n., s., 1878., p. 177.\nthe matter of the concubine and slave: judge both of them conformably with the law.\" I replied, \"It is a cause in which it is not fitting to deliver judgment save at the Sultan's palace.\" I then returned thither: the people assembled, and the concubine and the slave were summoned. I ordered that both should be beaten for their liaison; and adjudged that the woman should be set at liberty and the slave kept in prison: after which I returned home.\n\nThe Vizier sent several of his principal attendants to speak to me about setting the slave at liberty. I said to them, \"Intercession is made with me in favor of a negro slave, who has violated the respect which he owed to his master; while but yesterday, you have deposed the Sultan Chih\u00e1b eddin and slain him, because he went into the house of one of his slaves.\" Thereupon I ordered the prisoner to be beaten with bambu switches, which produced more effect than the whip. I had him marched through the whole island, with a rope round his neck. The messengers of the Vizier went and informed him of what passed. He discovered great agitation and was inflamed with anger. He assembled the other Viziers, the chiefs of the army, and sent for me. I obeyed the summons. It was my custom to pay him homage by bending the knee. This time I did not do so, only saying \"Peace be with you!\" Then I said to those present, \"Be ye witnesses that I resign my functions as K\u00e1z\u00ed, because I am rendered powerless to exercise them.\" The Vizier having then bespoken me, I went up and took a seat in front of him, and then I answered him in terms yet more severe. After this rencontre, the Mouezzin made the call to prayer at sun-down, and the Grand Vizier entered his house, saying, \"It is pretended that I am a sovereign; but see! I have sent for this man in order to vent my wrath upon him, and he dares to be angry with me.\" I was only respected by these islanders for the sake of the Sultan of India, for they knew the position I occupied under\n\n*Salaam aleicon!*\u2014Ar.\nAlthough they are far removed from him, they fear him much in their hearts.\n\nWhen the Grand Vizier had returned to his house, he sent he deposed K\u00e1z\u00ed, an eloquent speaker, who addressed me as follows:\u2014\u201cOur master requires to know why you have violated, in the presence of witnesses, the respect which is due to him, and why you have not rendered him homage?\u201d I replied, \u201cI saluted him only when my heart was satisfied with him; but now at dissatisfaction has supervened; I have renounced the usage. The salutation of Musalm\u00e1ns consists only of the word ass\u00e9l\u00e1m, Peace be with you!) and that I have pronounced.\u201d The Vizier at this person a second time, and he then said, \u201cYou have no other aim but that of leaving us; pay the dowries of your wives, and what you owe to the men, and go when you will.\u201d At this speech I bowed and went to my house and paid such debts as I had contracted: Up to this time the Vizier had given me carpets and a suite of furniture, consisting of copper vessels, and other things. He used to grant me everything I asked; he loved me and treated me with consideration; but his disposition changed and became inspired with fear of me.\n\nWhen he heard that I had paid my debts and that I was ending to depart, he repented of what he had said, and put granting me permission to go. I adjured him by the strongest oaths that I was under necessity to resume my voyage. I removed my belongings to a mosque upon the beach, and repudiated one of my wives. Another was with child, to her I gave a term nine months, within which I might return, or in default thereof she was to be mistress of her own actions. I took with me that one of my wives who had been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e1b \u1e32\u0101n in order to restore her to her father who dwelt in the island of Molo\u00fac, and my first wife, whose daughter was half-sister to the Sultana. I agreed with the Vizier \u2019Omar al-\u1e25erd (or General of the army, v. s. p. 22) and the Vizier\nHagan, the Admiral, that I should go to the country of Ma'bar* (Coromandel), the king of which was my brother-in-law, and that I should return with troops, to the end that the islands might be reduced under his authority, and that I should then exercise the power in his name. I chose to serve as signals between us, white flags to be hoisted on board the vessels. As soon as they should see these, they were to rise in rebellion on shore. I never had any such idea, up to the day when I showed my displeasure. The Vizier was afraid of me and said to the people, \"This man is determined to get the Vizierate, me living or dead.\" He made many enquiries about me, and added, \"I have heard that the King of India has sent him money, to use in raising trouble against me.\" He dreaded my departure lest I should return from the Coromandel Coast with troops. He bade me remain until he should get a ship ready for me: but I refused.\n\nThe half-sister of the Queen complained to her of the departure of her mother with me. The Queen wished to prevent her, but did not succeed. When she saw her resolved to go, she said to her, \"All the trinkets you possess were provided with money from the custom-house. If you have witnesses to swear that Dj\u00e9l\u00e1l eddin gave them to you, good and well; otherwise restore them.\" These trinkets were of considerable value; nevertheless my wife gave them up to these people. The Viziers and Chiefs came to me while I was at the mosque, and prayed me to return. I replied to them, \"Had I not sworn, assuredly I would return.\" They said, \"Go then to some other island, so that your oath be kept, and then return.\" \"Very well,\" said I, to satisfy them. When the day of my departure\n\n* The name Ma'bar ('passage' or 'ferry') was given to the Coromandel coast by the Arabs during the 13th and 14th centuries. Col. Yule suggests that it referred to the communication with Ceylon, or, as is more probable, to its being at that age the coast most frequented by travellers from Arabia and the Gulf (Maroo Polo II., p. 268). The tract of coast called Ma'bar extended from Cape Comorin to Nellore.\nwas come, I went to bid adieu to the Vizier. He embraced me and wept in such wise that his tears fell upon my feet. He passed the following night watching in the island, for fear lest my connections by marriage and my comrades should rise in rebellion against him.\n\nAt length I got away and arrived at the island of the Vizier 'Aly. My wife was in great distress, and wished to return. I repudiated her and left her there, and wrote this news to the Vizier, for she was the mother of his son's wife. I repudiated also the wife to whom I had fixed the term (for my return) and sent for a slave girl I was fond of. Meanwhile we sailed through the midst of the islands, from one group to another.\n\nOf Women who have only one Breast.\n\nIn one of the islands I saw a woman who had only one breast. She was mother of two daughters, of whom one resembled her exactly, and the other had two breasts, only that one was large and full of milk, the other small and contained none. I was astonished at the conformation of these women.\n\nWe arrived in course at another of these islands which was small, and had a solitary house, occupied by a weaver,* a married man and father of a family. He possessed small coco trees, and a little barque,\u2020 which served him for fishing and visiting the other islands when he wished: on his islet were also small bananas trees. We saw there none of the birds of the continent, except two crows, which flew in front of us on our arrival and circled round our ship. I truly envied the lot of this man, and made a vow that if his island should belong to me, I would retire to it until the inevitable term should arrive for me.\n\n* Mats, and some cloths, are woven in Huvad\u00fa (Suv\u00e1div\u00e9) Atol; the former on the islands Gadd\u00fa, Havara Tinad\u00fa, and Gemand-furhi.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 M. mas odi.\u2014B.\nI next arrived at the island of Molouc,* where I found the ship belonging to the captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem in which I had resolved to sail to the Coromandel Coast. That person came to visit me along with his companions, and they entertained me at a fine feast. The Vizier had written in my favor an order requiring them to give me at this island 120 bost\u00fb (v.s.p.11) of cows, 20 goblets of athou\u00e2n\u2020 or coco-honey, and to add to that every day a certain quantity of betel, arecanuts, and fish. I remained at Molouc 70 days, and married two wives there. Molouc is one of the fairest islands to see, being verdant and fertile. Among other marvellous things to be seen there, I remarked that a branch cut off one of the trees there, and planted in the ground or on a wall, will cover itself with leaves and become itself a tree. I observed also that the pomegranate tree there ceases not to bear fruit the whole year round. The inhabitants of this island were afraid that the captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem was going to harry them at his departure. They therefore wanted to seize the arms which his ship contained, and to keep them until the day of his departure. A dispute arose on this subject, and we returned to Mahal, but did not disembark. I wrote to the Vizier informing him of what had taken place. He sent a written order to the effect that there was no ground for seizing the arms of the crew. We then returned to Molouc, and left it again in the middle of the month of Rab\u00ee the second of the year 745 (26th August A.D. 1344). In the month of Shab\u00e1n of the same year (December, 1344), died the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin. The Sult\u00e2na was with child by him and was delivered after his death. The Vizier 'Abd-Allah took her to wife.\n\n* Molouc:\u2014Moluk, the chief island of Moluk Atol, is in lat. 2\u00b0 57' N. The Admiralty Chart says that it possesses good water. [More probably Fua Mulaku Island, which lies detached a little S.E. of the centre of the Equatorial Channel (lat. 0\u00b0 17', S.) between Huvad\u00fb and Add\u00fb Atols. Ibn Bat\u00fbta had already \"sailed through the midst of the islands, from one group to another.\"\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Athou\u00e2n:\u2014Above at p. 22 coco-honey is called korb\u00e2ny. In M\u00f4ura's edition of Ibn Bat\u00fbta (Lisbon, 1855), the word appears as alatuan.\nAs for us, we sailed on, though without an experienced pilot. The distance which separates the Maldives from the Coromandel Coast is three days' sail. We were for nine days under sail, and on the 9th we went on shore at the island of Ceylon. We perceived the mountain of Serendib raised in the air like a column of smoke. When we came near the island, the mariners said, \"This port is not in the country of a Sultan in whose dominions the merchants can go in all safety; it is in the country of the Sultan Airy Chacarouaty* who is one of the unjust and perverse. He has ships engaged in piracy on the high seas.\" Therefore we feared to land at his port, but, the wind rising, we were in danger of being swamped, and I said to the Captain, \"Put me ashore and I will get for you a safe-conduct from this Sultan.\" He did as I requested, and put me out on the beach. The idolaters advanced to meet us and said, \"Who are you?\" I apprized them that I was the brother-in-law and friend of the Sultan of Coromandel, that I was on my way to pay him a visit, and that what was on board the ship was destined for a present to that prince. The natives went to their Sovereign and communicated to him my reply. He sent for me, and I presented myself before him at the town of Batthalah (Puttalam)\u2020 which was his capital.\n\n* Airy Chacarouaty.\u2014This seems to be the (?) P\u00e1ndiyan prince, \"Aareya Chakra Warti,\" mentioned in Pridham (Ceylon, Vol I., p. 78), who, after 1371 A.D., conquered the northern half of the Island, and took King Wikrama captive, but was defeated by the Adigar Alakeswara, and possibly the same Malabar Prince captured and put to death by Prince \"Sapoomal Cumara.\"\u2014See Upham's R\u00e1jawali, p.264, 269. [A correspondent writes :\u2014\"The name identifies no individual. All the Kings of Jaffna seem to have been called Ariya or Ariyan\u2014an old title in India. See the Khandagiri rock inscription, and one of those over the Manikpura cave at Udayagiri (Cunningham's Corpus Ins. Indic., Vol. I.) Jaffna at this period (A.D. 1344) was, if the Vaipava M\u00e1la\u00ed can be trusted, under the rule of Kunavirasinka Ariyan.\"\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Batthalah.\u2014This town has been identified with Puttalam by Lee, Tennent, the French Editor, and Col. Yule, successively; but, it seems to me, without sufficient authority. The \u00e1 of Batth\u00e1lah is against it; so too the want\na neat little place, surrounded by a wall and bastions of wood. All the neighbouring shore was covered with trunks of cinnamon trees, torn up by the torrents. This wood was collected on the beach, and formed as it were hillocks. The inhabitants of Coromandel and of Malabar take it away without payment, save only that in return for this favor they make a present to the Sultan of\n\nof corroborative evidence of the existence of Puttal\u0101m as a town of any importance at this period, and the want of any river in its neighbourhood answering to the \"torrents\" spoken of by the traveller. This last point, and the doubtful existence of cinnamon so far north as Puttal\u0101m, are the only difficulties raised by Tennent (Vol. I., p. 580). The site of Batth\u0101l\u0101h has to be found with a full consideration of the cinnamon question, and, of the site of M\u00e9n\u0101r Mondely, the town at which Ibn Bat\u016bta: first halts on his journey towards the Peak. With his usual laborious care Tennent (Vol. I., p. 596) has examined all the early authorities known to him, and concludes that the text here gives the first mention of cinnamon as a product of Ceylon. Col. Yule, however (Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 255), points out that two previous notices of it exist, one in Kazwini (circa A.D. 1275), the other in a letter from John of Montecorvino (Ette's Kazwini, 229; Cathay, 213.)\n\nThe account given by our traveller shews that it was not as yet cultivated, and perhaps that the \"trunks\" seen by him were not those of the valuable variety of later days, but of the common indigenous cassia. I am not aware whether the cultivation, or growth, of cinnamon positively ceases at Chilaw, as seems to be the common opinion: but, even if this be true of the Ceylon cinnamon of commerce, it may not be so of the indigenous plant, and the area of production may be more limited now than in the 4th century. Ribeyro (Lee's edn., p. 15), says \"there is a forest of it 12 leagues in extent between Chilaw and the pagoda of Tenevary,\" without saying that Chilaw is the northern limit: the French translator (at p. 11) in his note, remarks 'that it is only found between Grudumall and Tenevar.' Now the promontory of Kutiraimalai is a considerable distance north of Puttal\u0101m: and I have little doubt that the French translator had good authority for the assertion. The remaining difficulty, that of the \"torrents,\" inclines me to believe that the site of Batth\u0101l\u0101h was probably further north, near the mouth of the Kal\u00e9-oya, where the free access to the sea by the passage between Kalpi\u1e6diya and K\u0101rativu would seem to designate a more suitable situation for a Prince, whose strength lay in ships.\n\nIt now remains to fix M\u00e9n\u0101r Mondely, which has been identified by preceding commentators, and not unnaturally, with the Minneri Mundal of\nstaffs and such things. Between Coromandel and the island of Ceylon there is a distance of a day and a night. There is also found in this island plenty of brazil-wood,* as well as Indian aloes, called alcalakhy (perhaps from the Greek \u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u2020), but which does not resemble the kam\u00e1ry or the k\u00e1kouly.\u2021 We shall speak of them hereafter.\n\nOF THE SULTAN OF CEYLON.\n\nHe is called Airy Chacarouaty, and he is a powerful King upon the sea. I saw in one day, while I was on the Coromandel Arrowsmith's map, adopted by Tennent. This place is represented as upon the Calpentyn [Kalpitiya] peninsular, due west of Puttalam, and I could never account for the traveller taking it on his route to the Peak. I am now informed that no such place exists. There is, however, on the present road, about half way between Puttalam and Chilaw, a village called Muntal or Mundal, four miles north of the Battul-oya, which seems to me to suit the description of the traveller in every way. M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely was the frontier town of the Batth\u00e1lah Prince, as Bender S\u00e9ldoudit (Chilaw) must (from the term Bender) have been to the Sinhalese King of the South: and the low jungles of the neighbourhood have always been a favourite haunt of wild buffaloes. By the Census of 1871, I find Mundal and Tandivila together had a population of 128, and Paniya Muntal, a neighbouring village, of 80. In conclusion, I have to state that the correspondent who has indicated the places on the Peak route, is of opinion that Batth\u00e1lah is Jaffna and M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely, Mann\u00e1r. I have been unable, after due consideration, to adopt his views, nor could I state them here at sufficient length. I trust, however, that if he has no objection he will formulate them in a separate paper for the use of the Society.\n\n* Brazil-wood:\u2014i.e., \"sapan.\" \"They have brazil-wood, much the best in the world,\" Kazwini names it, and Ribeyro (Lee's edn., p. 16) does the like.\"\u2014Yule, Marco Polo, Vol. II., pp. 254, 256.\n\n\u2020 Alcalakhy:\u2014Mr. L.

There were in the port eight ships belonging to the Sultan of the country and destined to make the voyage to Yemen. The sovereign gave orders to make preparations, and assembled people to guard his vessels. When the Sinhalese despaired of finding an opportunity of seizing them, they said, \"We have only come to protect the vessels belonging to us, which also must go to Yemen.\"\n\nWhen I entered the presence of the idolater Sultan, he rose, and made me sit by his side, and spoke to me with the greatest good-will. \"Let your comrades,\" said he, \"land in all safety, and be my guests until they leave. There is an alliance between me and the Sultan of Coromandel.\" Then he gave orders to have me lodged, and I remained with him for three days, in great consideration, which increased every day. He understood the Persian tongue, and much did he relish all I told him of foreign Kings and countries. I entered his presence one day when he had by him a quantity of pearls, which had been brought from the fishery in his dominions. The servants of the prince were sorting the precious from those which were not so. He said to me, \"Have you seen the pearl fishery in the countries whence you have come?\" \"Yes,\" I answered, \"I have seen it in the island of Keis, and in that of Kech, which belong to Ibn Assaou\u00e2m\u00e9ly.\" \"I have heard of them,\" replied he; and then took up some pearls and added, \"Are there at that island any pearls equal to these?\" I said, \"I have seen none so good.\" My answer pleased him, and he said, \"They are yours: do not blush,\" added he, \"and ask of me anything you desire.\" I replied, \"I have no other desire, since I have arrived in this island, but to visit the illustrious Foot of Adam.\" The people of the country call the first man b\u00e2b\u00e2 (father) and Eve, m\u00e2m\u00e2 (mother). \"That is easy enough,\" answered he, \"We shall send some one to conduct you.\" \"That is what I wish,\"\nsaid I, and then added, \"The vessel in which I have come will go in safety to Ma'bar and on my return, you will send me in your ships.\" \"By all means\" said he.\n\nWhen I reported this to the Captain of the ship, he said, \"I will not go till you have returned, even though I should have to wait a year for you.\" I made known this answer to the Sultan, and he said, \"The Captain shall be my guest until your return.\" He gave me a palanquin, which his slaves bore upon their backs, and sent with me four of those djoguis who are accustomed to undertake the pilgrimage annually to the Foot; he added to the party three Br\u00e1hmins, ten others of his friends, and fifteen men to carry the provisions. As for water, it is found in abundance on the route.\n\nOn the day of our departure, we encamped near a river, which we crossed in a ferry-boat formed of bamboos. Thence we took our way to M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely, a fine town, situated at the extremity of the Sultan's territory, the people of which treated us to an excellent repast. This consisted of young buffaloes, taken in chase in the neighbouring forest and brought in alive, rice, melted butter, fish, chickens and milk. We did not see in this town a single Musalm\u00e1n, except a native of Khorassan, who had remained on account of sickness, and who now accompanied us. We left for Bender S\u00e9l\u00e2ou\u00e2t,* a little town, and after quitting it we traversed some rough country, much of it under water. There were numbers of elephants there, which do no manner of harm to pilgrims, nor to strangers, and that is by the holy influence of Shaikh Abou 'Abd Allah, son of Khafif, the first who opened this way to visiting the Foot. Up to that time the infidels prevented the Musalm\u00e1ns from accomplishing the pilgrimage,\n\n* Bender S\u00e9l\u00e2ou\u00e2t, i.e., Chilaw.\u2014The fact that it was called Bender, implies, I think, that it contained a custom-house or store-house (V. s. p. 10), and was a frontier town of the King who ruled south of \"Aareya Chakrawarti.\" This is confirmed by the description of M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely as the frontier town of \"Aareya Chakrawarti.\"\nharried them, and would not eat or deal with them. But when\nthe adventure, which we have recounted in the first part of these\nVoyages (Tome II, pp. 80, 81) had happened to the Shaikh Abou\n'Abd Allah, that is to say, the murder of all his companions by\nthe elephants, his own preservation, and the manner in which the\nelephant carried him on its back, from that time on the idolaters\nhave respected the Musalmans, have permitted them to enter\ntheir houses and to eat with them.* They also place confidence\nin them, as regards their women and children. Even to this\nday they venerate in the highest degree the above-named Shaikh,\nand call him 'the Great Shaikh.'\n\nMeanwhile we reached the town of Conacdr,\u2020 the residenc\u2014\n\n* \"In this statement Ibn Batuta is fully borne out by Robert Knox, who\nsays, speaking of the charity of the Sighalese, in his Chapter 'concerning\ntheir religious doctrines, opinions, and practices,' Part iii., Ch. 5, 'Nor are\nthey charitable only to the poor of their own nation; but, as I said, to others\nand particularly to the Moorish beggars, who are Mahometans by religion:\nthese have a temple in Kandy. A certain former King gave this temple this\nprivilege\u2014that every freeholder should contribute a ponnam (fanam, 1\u00bdd.) to it;\nand these Moors go to every house in the land to receive it [except in\nDolosb\u00e2g\u00ea]; and, if the house be shut, they have power to break it open, and\ntake of goods to the value of it. They come very confidently when they beg,\nand say they come to fulfil the peoples' charity; and the people do liberally re-\nlieve them for charity's sake....... These Moors pilgrims have many pieces of\nland given to them by well disposed persons, out of charity, where they build\nhouses and live; and this land becomes theirs from generation to generation for\never.'\" (Skeen, Adam's Peak, p. 285.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Conacdr\u2014Dr. Lee identifies this place with Gampola, and he is followed\nby Pridham and Tennent. According to Turnour's Epitome, Gampola did not\nbecome the capital till after 1347, while Ibn Bat\u00fbta is writing at the end of\n1344. The Sighalese monarchy was then in a very troublous condition, and\nit is difficult to decide upon the locality of Conacdr.\u2014[Skeen (Adam's Peak,\np. 286) hesitates between Gampola and Ratnapura, the place where gems are\nchiefly found.] Col. Yule (Cathay, p. 423, Note) suggests that it was Kurun\u00e9gala.\n\n[Mr. L. Nell writes:\u2014\"Sir Emerson Tennent did not hesitate to identify\nthis Sovereign with Bhuwan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV., whose capital was Gangasripiura, the\nmodern Gampola. This identification was based on the Chronological Table of\nof the principal Sovereign of the Island. It is built in a gully, between two mountains, near a great vale, called 'the vale of precious stones,' because gems are found in it. Outside this town is seen the Mosque of the Shaikh Othman of Shiraz, surnamed Ch\u00e1ouch (the usher). The King and inhabitants of the place visit him, and treat him with high consideration. He used\n\nTurnour; but there are two grounds to doubt this identification. In the first place Turnour admitted an anachronism about A.D. 1347, the date assumed for the accession of Bhuwan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV, because the terms of three reigns immediately preceding this Sovereign are not given. Secondly, the capital of Kis\u00e1r or Kondr is described as situate in a valley between two hills in a 'vale' (or according to Lee 'bay') in which gems were found. The term Conac\u00e1r, sounds like an Arab attempt to reproduce the name Kurun\u00e9gala. Ibn Bat\u00fata wrote in A.D. 1344; according to Turnour, Gampola did not become the capital till after A.D. 1347. We are thus thrown back to a period before the accession of Bhuwan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV. There is an old native route between Puttalam and Kurun\u00e9gala. The route from Puttalam to Gampola direct has not been known.\" The correspondent already quoted notes:\u2014\"In tracing the traveller beyond Chilaw reference is necessary to Ceylon history. Incomparably the best authority for this period is the Nik\u00e1ya Sangraha, which was composed about 1396 A.D. (Turnour states 1357 A.D., but that is manifestly wrong, as the author describes all the Kings up to Bhuvanaika B\u00e1hu V., who came to the throne 1914 A.B., showing Turnour's date to be wrong by 7 years): the corresponding portion of the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1so was written in 1758 A.D., and is not of anything like the same authority.\n\n\"The King of Sighalese Ceylon in 1344 A.D. was Bhuvanaika B\u00e1hu IV. He ascended the throne 1342 A.D., and did not move the seat of Government to Gampola from Kurun\u00e9gala until 1346 A.D. Consequently Condicar must be (as indeed one would expect from the sound) Ibn Bat\u00fata's way of rendering Kurun\u00e9gala. It lies 'between two mountains,' the Handrukkanda range and the Yakdesssa range.\"\u2014B.]\n\n* \"The valley of the Mah\u00e1-oya which is within 10 miles of Kurun\u00e9gala. The word 'Manikam' used by the traveller (Lee's version) occurs in two villages in this valley Menik-divela and Menik-kadawara. The valley was celebrated for precious stones (see Kadaim pota), and the latter was a place of some notoriety in the 16th century, and figures in Tennent's Portuguese map as Manicavare: it is near Polgahawela.\"\u2014B.\nto serve as a guide for those who go to see the Foot. When he had his hand and foot cut off, his sons and slaves became guides in his stead. The cause of his being so mutilated was that he killed a cow. Now the law of the Hind\u00fas ordains that one who has killed a cow should be massacred in like wise, or enclosed in its skin and burnt. The Shaikh 'Othm\u00e2n being respected by those people, they contented themselves with cutting off his hand and foot, and granted to him, as a present, the dues levied at a certain market.\n\nOf the Sultan of Conac\u00e2r.\n\nHe is called by the name Cond\u00e2r,* and possesses the white elephant. I have never seen in the world another white elephant. The King rides him on solemn occasions, and attaches to the forehead of this animal large jewels. It happened to this Monarch that the nobles of his empire rebelled against him, blinded him, and made his son King. As for him, he still lives in this town, deprived of his sight.\n\n* Cond\u00e2r\u2014According to Turnour's list of Sighalese monarchs, the King at this time, 1344-45, would be Wijaya B\u00e1hu the Vth. Col. Yule (Cathay, p. 423 Note) thinks Cond\u00e2r or Kund\u00e2r is the Sanskrit Kum\u00e2var, 'prince.'\n\n[\u201cCol. Yule's guess\u201d adds Mr. Nell \u201cat the name of the Sovereign \u2018Cond\u00e2r,\u2019 as identical with \u2018Kum\u00e2var,\u2019 the Sanskrit for \u2018Prince\u2019, comes near what I conceive to be the fact. It will be seen that the Arab traveller describes a Mahommedan Mosque, outside the town of this Prince. Now, a Mahommedan Prince, Vusthimi Kum\u00e1ray\u00e2, did reign with great popularity in Kurun\u00e9gala. His romantic story is a local tradition in that town. He is said to have been treacherously murdered by the Buddhist priests of a temple on Pi\u00e1gala. They invited him to be present at a religious ceremony and suddenly pushed him over the precipice [Pridham, Vol. II., p. 649]. Offerings are made upon a mound on the road to the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, which probably marks the spot where the Prince was interred, or the Shaikh referred to hereafter. No native will venture to pass the spot after dark without company, for the spirit of Gala-Band\u00e2ra, on horseback, is supposed to ride about the neighbourhood. The Court is said to have been immediately removed to Dambadeniya after this assassination, on the ground that the sanctity of the city had been polluted by a Mahommedan usurper.]\nOF THE PRECIOUS STONES.\n\nThe admirable gems called albahram\u00e1n (rubies or carbuncles) are only found at this town. Some of them are found in the vale and these are the most precious in the eyes of the natives: others are extracted from the earth. Gems are met with in all localities in the island of Ceylon. In this country the whole of the soil is private property. An individual buys a portion of it, and digs to find gems. He comes across stones white-branched: in the interior of these stones the gem is hidden. The owner sends it to the lapidaries, who scrape it until it is separated from the stones which conceal it. There are the red (rubies), the yellow (topazes), and the blue (sapphires) which they call neilem (nilem).* It is a rule of the natives that precious stones whose value amounts to 100 fanams are reserved for the Sultan, who gives their price and takes them for himself. As for those of an inferior price, they remain the property of the finders.\u2020 One hundred fanams are equivalent to six pieces of gold.\n\nIt is probable that the priest, who compiled the history referred to by Turnour, has purposely omitted the name of this Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1d, thus causing the anachronism noticed by Turnour. C\u00e1sie Chetty conjectures that this Prince was the son of Wijaya B\u00e1hu V. by his Moorish Queen Vasthimi and this is quite consistent with the above theory. It is also stated by Ibn Bat\u00fata that the King and inhabitants of Conac\u00e1r used to visit the Mahommedan Shaikh 'Othm\u00e1n of Shiraz at his Mosque, and to treat him with great respect. It is significant that the Prince of Conac\u00e1r is not mentioned in the French translation as \u2018an infidel King\u2019, as Ibn Bat\u00fata seems to be careful to do in all instances of those who were not his co-religionist. The French translation also describes this King as deposed by his subjects and deprived of his sight, whilst his son was placed on the throne. This son may have been Vasthimi Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1d. The silence of the Sihhalese historians has, however, left all this in doubt.\u201d\u2014B.]\n\n* Neilem = S. nila.\n\n\u2020 Barbosa on the other hand says that all the Ceylon gemming is done by the agents of the King, and on his behalf. The stones are brought to him, and his lapidaries select the best, and sell the rest to the merchants (Stanley\u2019s\nAll the women in the island of Ceylon possess necklaces of precious stones of divers colors: they wear them also at their hands and feet, in the form of bracelets and khalkh\u00e2ls (anklets). The concubines of the Sultan make a network of gems and wear it on their heads. I have seen on the forehead of the white elephant seven of these precious stones, each of which was larger than a hen\u2019s egg. I likewise saw in possession of Airy Chacarouaty a ruby dish, as large as the palm of the hand, containing oil of aloes. I expressed my astonishment at this dish, but the Sultan said, \u201cWe have objects of the same material larger than that.\u201d\n\nWe left Conac\u00e1r, and halted at a cave called by the name of Ostha Mahmoud Allotry. This person was one of the best of men: he had excavated this cave in the mountain side, near a little vale. Quitting this place, we encamped near the vale called Khaour bouzneh (\u2018monkey vale\u2019). Bouzneh (Persian bouzineh) designates the same as alkoroud (plural of alkird, \u2018monkey\u2019) in Arabic.\n\nOF THE MONKEYS.\n\nThese animals are very numerous in the mountains: they are of a black colour, and have long tails. Those of the male sex have beards like men. The Shaikh \u2019Othm\u00e2n, his son and other persons, have related to me that the monkeys have a Chief whom they obey like a Sovereign. He binds round his head a wreath of the leaves of trees, and supports himself with a staff. Four\n\nBarbosa, Hakt. Soc., p. 169.) Ludovico di Varthema (A.D. 1505) says:\u2014\u201cAnd when a merchant wishes to find these jewels, he is obliged first to speak to the King, and to purchase a braza of the said land in every direction (which braza is called a molan [? amugam], and to purchase it for five ducats. And then when he digs the said land, a man always remains there on the part of the King, and if any jewel be found there which exceeds ten carats, the King claims it for himself and leaves all the rest free.\u201d\u2014Badger\u2019s Varthema, Hakt. Soc., p. 190.\n\n* See further, as to the wonderful gems of that period, Marco Polo, Bk. III., Ch. xiv., and Col. Yule\u2019s note thereto.\nmonkeys, bearing staves, march on his right and left; and, when\nthe chief is seated, they stand behind him. His wife and little\nones come and sit before him every day. The other monkeys\ncome and squat at some distance from him: then one of the four\nabove-mentioned gives them the word and they withdraw; after\nwhich, each brings a banana, or a lime, or some such fruit. The\nKing of the monkeys, his little ones, and the four chief monkeys\nthen eat. A certain djugui related to me that he had seen these\nfour monkeys before their Chief, occupied in beating another\nmonkey with a stick, after which they plucked his hair.*\n\nTrustworthy persons have reported to me that when one of\nthese monkeys has got possession of a young girl, she is unable\nto escape his lust. An inhabitant of the island of Ceylon has\ntold me that he had a monkey, and when one of his daughters\nentered the house, the animal followed her. She cried him off,\nbut he did her violence. \"We ran to her aid,\" continued the\nspeaker, \"and seeing the monkey embracing her, we killed him.\"\n\nThen we took our departure for 'the vale of bamboos,'\u2020 where\nAbou 'Abd Allah, son of Khafif, found two rubies, which he\n\n* \"This is evidently a confused account of the Vedd\u00e1s and their customs.\nIbn Bat\u00fata was now in their country, Sabaragamuwa, through which he was\njourneying, being, as its name imports, 'the Vedd\u00e1 village.'\" (Skeen, loc. cit.\np. 289).

It lives upon trees and herbs in the neighbourhood of water, and when a man approaches, it pounces upon him. Whatever be the part of the body upon which the leech falls, it draws therefrom much blood. The natives take care to have ready in that case a lime, the juice of which they express over\n\n* \"A steep and rough ascent, for a considerable distance from Batapola,\u2014midway in which a stone tumulus has been erected on the spot where the remains of an old priest were burned\u2014brings the pilgrim to Pal\u00e1badala, 'the house of the old woman,' according to Ibn Bat\u00fata, and 'the farthest inhabited part of the island of Ceylon' [Lee's version], that is, when he travelled through it, about five hundred and thirty years ago.\"\n\n\"The following legend is connected with the place, and accounts for its name:\u2014Long, long ago, a very poor woman was desirous of performing the pilgrimage to the Sri-p\u00e1da, but, owing to her extreme poverty, could take nothing with her except some common jungle leaves, which in times of distress the natives occasionally resort to for food; these she boiled, and rolled up in a plaintain leaf; and having arrived thus far, when about to partake of her food, she found the boiled leaves had been miraculously turned into rice. Thenceforward it was called P\u00e1l\u00e1-bat-dola, 'the place [rill] of rice and vegetables,' a name which it has ever since retained.\" (Skeen, loc. cit. p. 147, 154-5.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 \"An ascent of some fifty feet brings the pilgrim to the crest of the ridge of which the Dharmma-r\u00e1ja-gala forms a part.

It is said that a certain pilgrim was passing this neighbourhood, and that the leeches fastened upon him. He remained impassive, and did not squeeze lime-juice upon them: and so all his blood was sucked and he died.* The name of this man was B\u00e1b\u00e1 Kho\u00fazy, and there is there a cave which bears his name. From this place we took our way to 'the seven caves,' then to 'the hill of Iskandar' (Alexander). There is there a grotto called of Alisfah\u00e1ny, a spring of water, and an uninhabited mansion, beneath which is the bay called 'the place of bathing of the contemplative.' At the same place is seen 'the orange cave' and 'the cave of the Sultan.' Near the latter is the gateway (derw\u00e2zeh in Persian, b\u00e2b in Arabic) of the mountain.\u2020\n\n* Dr. Lee has this note:\u2014\"Knox describes these leeches as being rather troublesome than dangerous. His words are:\u2014'There is a sort of leaches of the nature of ours, only differing in colour and bigness; for they are of a dark reddish colour like the skin of bacon, and as big as a goose-quill; in length some two or three inches. At first, when they are young, they are no bigger than a horse-hair, so that they can scarce be seen. In dry weather none of them appear, but immediately upon the fall of rains, the grass and woods are full of them. These leaches seize upon the legs of travellers......Some, therefore, will tie a piece of lemon and salt in a rag, and fasten it unto a stick, and ever and anon strike it upon their legs to make the leaches drop off: others will scrape them off with a reed, cut flat and sharp in the fashion of a knife,' &c.\u2014Ceylon, p. 25.

About fifty or sixty feet below, he saw a clearing in a small dell, in the centre of which was a square kind of tank; and this dell he determined to examine on the occasion of his third visit. The result of the examination was, that he identified the station H\u00e9ramitip\u00e1na, and this place, as that described by Ibn Bat\u00fbta, as 'the ridge of Alexander, in which\nOF THE MOUNTAIN OF SERENDIB (ADAM'S PEAK).\n\nIt is one of the highest mountains in the world: we saw it from the open sea, when we were distant from it upwards of nine days' march. While we were making the ascent, we saw the clouds above us, hiding from view the lower parts of it. There are upon this mountain many trees of kinds which do not cast their leaves, flowers of divers colors, and a red rose as large as the palm of the hand.* It is alleged that on this rose is an inscription in which one may read the name of God Most High and that of his Prophet.\u2020 On the mountain are two paths leading to the Foot of Adam. The one is known by the name of\n\nis a cave and a well of water,* at the entrance to the mountain Serendib. The old Moor's account is somewhat confused, his notes or recollections not always carrying his facts exactly in their due order; but half way down the descent, on the left hand, is a well, excavated in the rock, in which we found about five feet of water, and which swarmed with tadpoles. Possibly Ibn Bat\u00fata found it in the same condition, for he speaks of the well, at the entrance, full of fish, of which 'no one takes any.' At the bottom of the dell is a cleared space; in the centre of this is a square tank or well, the sides of which are formed of blocks of stone, six or eight feet long. Beyond this, almost facing the descent, some twenty feet up the opposite mountain's side, is a cave. To this my companion and I forced our way through the jungle, and came to the conclusion that this was the cave of Kh\u00edzr, where, Ibn Bat\u00fata says, 'the pilgrims leave their provisions, and whatever else they have, and then ascend about two miles to the top of the mountain, to the place of (Adam's) foot.' In the preceding sentence he says, 'Near this (cave) and on each side of the path, is a cistern cut in the rock.' Now, no other place that we saw, or heard of\u2014and we were particularly minute in our inquiries\u2014answers to such a description. There are the two wells, and the cave; and the distance to the foot-print is also pretty fairly estimated.\" (Skeen, loc. cit., pp. 226-7.)\u2014B.\n\n* \"Gigantic rhododendrons overhang the wall on the eastern side of the Peak. Their bending trunks seem, to the Buddhist mind, to bow to the foot-print; and to offer, in homage and adoration, their wealth of crowning crimson flowers to the pedal impress of the founder of their faith.\" (Skeen, loc. cit., p. 200.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020The pious Musalm\u00e1ns in this age of faith found their creed proclaimed by nature itself not only on the flowers of the rhododendron, but on the leaves\n'the Father's path' and the other by that of 'the Mother's path. By these terms are Adam and Eve designated. The Mother's route is an easy one, and by it the pilgrims return; but any one who took it for the ascent would be regarded as not having done the pilgrimage. The Father's path is rough and difficult of ascent. At the foot of the mountain, at the place of the gateway, is a grotto also bearing the name of Iskandar, and a spring of water.\n\nof the fig-tree. Before he went to the Maldives, Ibn Bat\u00fata was at Deh Fattan (? D\u00e9vipatam), a town on the Malabar Coast, where he records the existence of an extraordinary tree near the mosque. \"I saw that the mosque was situated, near a verdant and beautiful tree; whose leaves resembled those of the fig, except that they were glossy. It was surrounded by a wall and had near it a niche or oratory, where I made a prayer of two genuflexions. The name of this tree with the natives of the country was derakht (dirakht) acch\u00eah\u00e2dah 'the tree of the testimony.' I was informed at this place that every year, on the arrival of autumn, there fell from this tree a solitary leaf, whose colour passed first to yellow and then to red. On this leaf were written, with the pen of the Divine power, the words following 'There is no God but God, and Mohammed is the apostle of God.' The juris-consult Hou\u00e7ain and many other trustworthy men told me that they had seen this leaf, and had read the inscription upon it. Hou\u00e7ain added that, when the time arrived for it to fall, trusted men from among the Musalm\u00e1ns and the idolaters sat down under the tree. When the leaf fell the Musalm\u00e1ns took one half of it, while the other was deposited in the treasury of the idolater Sultan. The inhabitants preserve it for the purpose of curing the sick. This tree caused the conversion of the grandfather of Coucil [the Sultan at the time of his visit] to the faith, and he it was who built the mosque and the tank [from its description similar to the Sighalese pokuna]. This prince could read the Arabic characters: and when he deciphered the inscription and understood what it contained, he embraced the true faith and professed it entirely. His story is preserved in tradition among the Hind\u00fas. The juris-consult Hou\u00e7ain told me that one of the children of this King returned to idolatry after the death of his father, governed with injustice, and ordered the tree to be torn up from the roots. The order was executed, and no vestige of the tree was left. Nevertheless it began to shoot again, and became as fair a tree as it had been before. As for the idolater, he came to die full soon thereafter.\" (Tome IV., pp. 85-87.) I have quoted this passage\nThe people of old have cut in the rock steps of a kind, by help of which you ascend; fixed into them are iron stanchions, to which are suspended chains, so that one making the ascent can hold on to them.* These chains are ten in number, thus:\u2014two at the foot of the mountain [Peak] at the place of the gate-way; seven in contiguity after the two first; and the tenth, that is \u2018the chain of the profession of faith (Isl\u00e1m),\u2019 so named because a person who has reached it and looks back at the foot of the mountain will be seized with hallucinations, and, for fear of falling, he will recite the words \u201cI bear witness that there is no God but God, and that Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d When you have passed this chain, you will find a path badly kept. From the tenth chain to \u201cthe cave of Khidhr\u201d\u2020 is seven miles. This cave is situate at an open place, and it has near it a spring of water full of fish, and this also bears the name of Khidhr. No one may catch these fish. Near the cave are two basins cut in the rock, one on each\n\n* These chains are spoken of by Marco Polo in the previous century. \u201cFurthermore you must know that on this Island of Seilan there is an exceeding high mountain; it rises right up so steep and precipitous that no one could ascend it, were it not that they have taken and fixed to it several great massive iron chains, so disposed that by help of these men are able to mount to the top.\u201d\u2014Yule, Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 256.\n\n\u2020 See, as to the identity of this saint or prophet, Dr. Lee\u2019s note, and Sell, \u2018Faith of Isl\u00e1m,\u2019 p. 260.\u2014B.\nside of the path. In the grotto of Khidhr the pilgrims leave their belongings; thence they mount two miles further to the summit, where is the Foot.\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOT.**\n\nThe impression of the noble Foot, that of our father Adam, is observed in a black and lofty rock, in an open space. The Foot is sunk in the stone, in such wise that its site is quite depressed; its length is eleven spans.* The inhabitants of China came here formerly; they have cut out of the stone the mark of the great toe, and of that next to it, and have deposited this fragment in a temple of the town of Zeitoun (Tseu-thoung) whither men repair from the most distant provinces.\u2020 In the rock whereon is the print of the foot, are cut nine holes, in which the idolater pilgrims place gold, precious stones and pearls. You may see the fakirs, arrived from 'the grotto of Khidhr' seeking to get ahead of one another, and so to get what may be in these holes. In our case we found there only some little stones, and a\n\n* Dr. Marshall, who in 1819 ascended the Peak with Mr. S. Sawers, says the foot is 5 ft. 6 in. in length. Tennent says it is \"about 5 feet long, and of proportionate breadth\" (Vol. II. p. 140), Knox (p. 3) says \"about two feet long,\" but he never saw it. Ribeyro, Liv. i., C. xxiii., says, \"two palms long and eight inches broad.\" See further Yule's Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 261. Lieut. Malcolm, the first Englishman who made the ascent, (1815), says the impression is in kabook or ironstone. [\"The heel is much higher than the toes, and the artificiality of the whole is palpable. A thick raised edging of cement marks the rude outline of a foot 5 ft. 7 in. long, and 2 ft. 7 in. broad at the point where the heel begins to curve. The interstices between the toes are also formed of cement, and the whole of the markings of the foot every now and again need repair. The inner portion of the heel and instep are the only parts that are clearly natural [gneiss] rock, (Skeen, loc. cit., p. 203.)\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Marco Polo says that an embassy was sent by the great Khan in 1284 while he himself was in China, to obtain relics of our father Adam. They obtained a couple of teeth, some hair, and a dish of prophyry used by our first parent. He does not mention that they brought a piece of the rock from the foot-print,\u2014Yule's Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 259.\nlittle gold which we gave to our guide. It is customary for pilgrims to pass three days in 'the cave of Khidhr,' and during this time to visit the Foot morning and evening: and so did we.\n\nWhen the three days had elapsed, we returned by way of the Mother's path, and encamped hard by the grotto of Cheim, who is the same as Cherith (Seth) son of Adam. We halted in succession near 'the bay of fish,' the straggling villages of Cormolak, Djeber-rhou\u00e2n, Diddin'coueh and Atkalendjeh.* It was in the last named place that the Shaikh Abou 'Abd Allah, son of Khafif passed the winter. All these villages and stations are on the mountain. Near the base, on the same path, is the d\u00e9rakht (dirakht) rew\u00e1n 'the walking tree,' a tree of great age, not one of whose leaves falls. It is called by the name of m\u00e2chiah (walking) because a person looking at it from above the mountain considers it fixed a long distance off, and near the foot of the hill; while one who regards it from beneath, believes it to be in quite the opposite direction. I have seen at this place a band\n\n* [The correspondent before quoted writes:\u2014\"I fear the route taken by the traveller after leaving Kurun\u00e9gala must always be a matter of conjecture. I have given it some attention and I think it most probable that he went from Kurun\u00e9gala towards the mountains and ascended Adam's Peak from the pilgrim's path in Maskeliya. My reasons are\u2014\n\n(i.) The extreme limit of the inhabited region was evidently a long way from the Peak\u2014this would be true on the Maskeliya side, but not true in the low country, as there were villages comparatively near the Peak.\n\n(ii.) From the traveller's description he evidently went into the mountains soon after leaving Kurun\u00e9gala.\n\n(iii.) The names of places described are found on this route, and on no other.\n\n(iv.) The traveller describes two routes as practicable. The 'father's path' as rough and difficult, the 'mother's path' as easy and the way of return. He went by the former, which is evidently the way through the hills and the forest of Maskeliya.\n\nThe most convenient pass from Kurun\u00e9gala to the mountains runs past Girih\u00e1gama, and there is a cave in the mountain side near a little vale (exactly as described) which still retains the name Galagedara ('cave abode').\nof *djoguis*, who did not leave the foot of the hill, waiting for the fall of the leaves of this tree. It is planted in a place where there is no possibility of getting at it. The idolaters retail some fictions concerning it; among them, this\u2014whoever eats of its leaves recovers his youth, even should he be an old man. But that is false.\n\nUnder this mountain is a great vale where precious stones are found. Its waters appear to the eye extremely blue. From this we marched for two days as far as the town of *Din\u00e9wer*, a large one, built near the sea, and inhabited by merchants.* In a vast temple is seen an idol bearing the same name as the town. In this temple are upwards of a thousand Br\u00e1hmins and *djoguis*,\n\n*Monkey vale' I cannot identify; there is a place in Dojosb\u00e1g\u00e9 called *Wanduru-m\u00e1na* ('monkey measure').\n\n'The vale of bamboos (or reeds)' I should guess to be *Rambukpitiya* in Upper Bulatgama; it is of some antiquity and importance, and lies right on the road to Adam's Peak.\n\nThe spot where 'Ab\u00fa Abd-Allah found his two rubies is probably even yet to be identified by the name *Menik-hambantoja* ('the gem ford of the foreign trader') on the pilgrim's route. 'The house of the old woman' (*A'chchi-gedara?*) has probably not survived till our time. The rest of the route lay through 'the wilderness of the Peak,' containing no inhabitants but hermits. The Royal hermit called *S\u00e9vik* I should guess to be 'Raja Savlu (or Sakra) Vije Bahu,' afterwards father of the Sri-Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. (Valentyn, p. 71, and Kavyasekara, 89.) Of the straggling villages mentioned as halting places on the journey to Dondra, *Cormolah* is probably Gilimal\u00e9; *Dildin\u00e9ouch* may be either Dinawaka or a Deledniya; and *Atkulandjeh* is certainly the Atakalan Koral\u00e9, the last district 'on the mountain' (i.e., Kanda-uda or in the Uda-raja).\n\n\"The pass would probably be that traversed on the road from *D\u00e1pan\u00e9* to *U'rubokka*, which is the beginning of 'the great vale [leading to M\u00e1bara] where precious stones are found. Its waters appear to the eye extremely blue'\u2014of course the reference is to the *Nihval\u00e1-ga\u1e45ga* ('blue-cloud-river')\u2014and precious stones are still found there in some quantity (Cf. Pybus' Journey to Kandy, p. 22). *Din\u00e9wer* is of course D\u00e9wi-nuwara, and *K\u00e1ly*, Galle.\"\u2014B.]\n\n*Din\u00e9wer:*\u2014Dondra.

The town and its revenues are the private property of the idol; all who live in the temple and those who visit it are supported therefrom. The statue is of gold and of the size of a man. In place of eyes, it has two large rubies, and I was told that they shone by night like two lamps.\n\nWe took our departure for the town of K\u00e1ly,* a small one, six parasangs from D\u00edn\u00e9ver. A Musalm\u00e1n there, called the Ship-Captain Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, entertained us at his house. We then took the route for the town of Calenbou (Colombo) one of the largest and most beautiful in the island of S\u00e9rendib. There dwells the Vizier, prince of the sea, Dj\u00e1lesty,\u2020 who has there about 500 Abyssinians. Three days after leaving Calenbou, we arrived at Batth\u00e1lah, of which mention is made above. We visited the Sultan of whom I have spoken. I found the Captain Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm awaiting me, and we left for the country of Ma\u2019bar:\n\n[Ibn Bat\u00fata and his friends met with tempestuous weather, and were wrecked on the Coast of Coromandel, probably near the mouth of the Patar.

This was the Sultan\n\n* K\u00e1ly:\u2014Galle. Six parasangs will be a little over 30 miles.

He landed at Perivilis (? Barberyn) \u201cover against Paradise. Here a certain tyrant, by name Coya Jaan, a eunuch, had the mastery in opposition to the lawful king. He was an accursed Saracen, who, by means of his great treasures, had gained possession of the greater part of the kingdom.\u201d This person \u201cin the politest manner\u201d robbed him of the valuable gifts he was carrying home to the Pope, and detained him four months.\u2014Yule\u2019s \u2018Cathay,\u2019 p. 357.\nGhiy\u0101th edd\u012bn, whose wife was a sister of a woman Ibn Bat\u016bta had married at Delhi: he is therefore above called his brother-in-law. Ibn Bat\u016bta was hospitably entertained, and he thus continues:\u2014\n\nI had an interview with the Sultan and proposed the subject of the M\u00e1ldives, and the sending of an army to the islands. He formed a resolve to accomplish this object, and appointed the ships for the purpose. He arranged a present for the Queen of M\u00e1ldives, robes of honor, and gifts for the Emirs and Viziers. He entrusted to me the care of securing a marriage for him with the sister of the Queen; and lastly, he ordered three ships to be loaded with alms for the poor of the islands, and said to me, \"You will get back in five days.\" The Admiral Khodjah Serlec said to him, \"It will not be possible to go to the M\u00e1ldives until three months from this moment.\" The Sultan went on to address me, \"Since that is so, come to Fattan, so that we may finish this expedition and return to our capital at Moutrah (Madura): you will set out from there.\" I then remained with him, and as we waited I sent for my concubines and my comrades.\n\n[Ghiy\u0101th edd\u012bn won a great victory over the infidels and returned with Ibn Bat\u016bta to Fattan (? D\u00e9vipatam) a large seaport town, and thence to Madura. At Fattan the Sultan told the Admiral to cease preparing the vessels for the M\u00e1ldives expedition. He was then suffering from an illness, and shortly afterward died at a place near Madura. He left no son, and his nephew, N\u0101sir edd\u012bn, whom Ibn Bat\u016bta had known as a domestic servant at Delhi, was accepted by the army, and reigned in his stead:\u2014\n\nHe [N\u0101sir edd\u012bn] ordered that I should be provided with all the ships which his uncle had assigned to take me to the M\u00e1ldives. But I was attacked with fever, which is mortal at this place. I imagined that I was about to die. God inspired me to have recourse to the tamarind, which is very abundant in that country: I took about a pound and put it in water. I then\ndrank the beverage, and that relieved me in three days, and God healed me. I took a disgust for the town of Moutrah, and requested the Sultan's permission to take a voyage. He said, \"Where would you go? There remains only a month ere you start for the Maldives. Remain here and we shall give you all the equipment ordered by the master of the world (the deceased Sultan).\" I declined, and he wrote an order in my favor to Fattan, that I should be allowed to depart in any vessel I would. I returned to that town, and there found eight vessels setting sail for Yemen, and in one of them I embarked.\n\n[Ibn Bat\u00fata left this ship at Caoulem (Quilon) on the Malabar Coast, and there remained for three months. He then embarked in another, which was attacked by the pirates near Hinaour (Honore), and the traveller lost all his property, including the pearls and precious stones presented to him by the Ceylon King, and all his clothes:\u2014]\n\nI returned to Calicut and entered one of the Mosques. A lawyer sent me a suit of clothes; the K\u00e2zi, a turban; and a merchant, another coat. I was here informed of the marriage of the Vizier 'Abd Allah with the Queen Khadidjah, after the death of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin, and I heard that my wife, whom I had left enceinte, was delivered of a male child. It came into my heart to go back to the Maldives, but I feared the enmity which existed between me and the Vizier A'bd Allah. In consequence, I opened the Kur\u00e1n, and these words appeared before me, \"The angels shall descend unto them, and shall say, 'Fear not, neither be ye grieved.'\" (Kur\u00e1n, Sur. xii., 30.) I implored the benediction of God, took my departure, and arrived in ten days at the Maldives, and landed at the island of Cannalo\u00fbs. The Governor of this island, 'Abd al 'Az\u00eez Almakdach\u00e2ouy, welcomed me with respect, entertained me, and got a barque ready.
