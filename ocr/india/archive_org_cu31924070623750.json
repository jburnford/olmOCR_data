CAMPBELL.\n\nAugust 1886.\nPREFACE.\n\nIn placing in the hands of the public the Useful Plants of the Bombay Presidency, the writer does not claim for it the merit of originality, freely admitting that it is almost entirely a compilation from the various works on Indian Botany that have preceded it. Although nearly every botanical work has been availed of for his purpose, the writer has in the following pages directed references in the main to Brandis' Forest Flora of the North-West Provinces and Dalzell's and Gibson's Bombay Flora as being the two that are most handy and portable.\n\nThe timber trees are arranged in a regular botanical series, according to DeCandolle's system of classification, from descriptions which are found scattered in Balfour's Timber Trees, Brandis' Forest Flora, Beddome's Flora Sylvatica, Hooker's Flora of British India; and the writer's knowledge of the plants of some of the districts of the Deccan and Konkan,\u2014like Matheran, Khandala, Mahabaleshwar, Goa,\u2014together with the dried specimens which he has from time to time obtained from other places, have enabled him to verify and correct these descriptions where necessary.\n\nIn describing a tree the writer has invariably given the colour and arrangement of its flowers. This, coupled with the character of the other parts and the native names, will, it is hoped, enable the reader of ordinary intelligence to identify the various trees mentioned in the work.\n\nThe altitude of a tree has been given, not in reference to the highest point at which it is seen growing in this presidency, but to the highest point at which it is met with in India. Thus the Jambul tree, which in Bombay is not met with higher than at Sindolla (Mahabaleshwar), has 5000 feet recorded against it, the tree being found to grow at Kamaon, which has the above height.\n\nThe heights and girths given in this work are all average measurements. It is very well known that both vary, not only in different places and under different circumstances of climate, etc., but even in the same localities, according to differences of soil, exposure to winds, etc. Thus the Jambul, to which Brandis gives a\nheight of 70-80 and sometimes 90 feet, is in exposed high situations such as Sindolla, towards and on the slopes of Lingmalla (Mah\u00e1baleshvar), but a stunted shrub, bearing fruit scarcely one-fourth the size of that found in the Konkan. *Hymenedyction excelsum* (Karwa, Dandru or Dandeli), which is a large tree in the plains, becomes smaller and smaller as we ascend the Gh\u00e1ts.\n\nThe flowering time (Fl.) and the seasons during which trees ripen their fruit (Fr.) are also subject to considerable variations: e.g. *Millingtonia hortensis*, the Indian cork-tree, is in full bloom in Poonah at the end of August, whereas in Bombay it is in flower a month and a half later. In the description of timber trees the writer has not been very precise in the use of some of the technical terms; nor has he, in the enumeration of the characters of timbers, made a distinction between *sap* and *heart* wood, as in a great majority of cases the one gradually merges into the other; and even where the difference is clear, it becomes inappreciable when the timber is not well seasoned, the colour white or yellow becoming brown, dark brown, reddish-purple, or black. As an illustration of the difficulty sometimes thus arising may be mentioned the fact that, with the exception of Dr. Brandis, who describes separately the *sap* and *heart* wood of the first species in the list, *Dillenia Indica*, no other writer on Indian timbers makes this distinction. The wood of the second species, *D. pentaphylla*, is described even by Dr. Brandis without an attempt at separating the *sap* from the *heart* wood.\n\nThe description of fruits, vegetables, food, and oil-yielding plants, &c., mentioned in other sections is very short; for their cultivation, the uses and consumption of their products in each province are described in various volumes of the Gazetteer, for which alone the present one is written. Besides, a considerable number consists of the common garden and field plants, which are or may be readily identified by their native names.\n\nThe idea of dividing the work into sections has been borrowed from Sir G. C. M. Birdwood's interesting work *Vegetable Productions of the Bombay Presidency*. The writer has, however, not only made alterations and additions to Sir G. C. M. Birdwood's sections, but has introduced several entirely new ones, such as \"Plants mentioned in the Religious Books of the Hindus,\" \"Plants or their Products used in intoxicating Fish,\" \"Vegetable Poisons,\" \"List of Herbs, Tubers,\" &c., used as food by the poorer classes of India during seasons of famine. The Indian medicinal plants are grouped\ntogether according to their properties and uses, the modes of preparation and administration being also briefly given. \"Timber trees\" occupy more than half the book, thus making the work, the writer hopes, far more useful for reference.\n\nIt now only remains for the writer to crave the indulgence of his readers for the irregularities and errors that must of necessity have crept into a work which has been written under failing health and in the short intervals of time snatched from the anxieties of his professional duties. If time and health are permitted him, the writer hopes to correct these errors in a second edition of the work.\n\nJ. C.

Bly. Fl. 149. Soma.\n\n\"The Soma of the Vedas, its name being derived from the circumstance that it was gathered by moonlight by the ancient Hindus. They carried it to their homes in carts drawn by rams; and a fermented liquor was prepared by mixing its juice, strained through a sieve of goat's hair, with barley and ghee. This wine was drunk at all their religious ceremonies, and was used as an intoxicant by the rishis, who, in the golden age of Hinduism, combined it at their meals with beef.\"\u2014Birdwood.\n\nRoxburgh says:\u2014\"This plant yields a larger portion of very pure milky juice than any other I know; and, what is rare, it is of a mild nature, and acid taste. The native travellers often suck the tender shoots to allay their thirst.\"\n\nS. brevistigma grows at the foot of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and in various other rocky places in India. Whether it is the true Soma of the Veda or a substitute for it introduced in modern times, is difficult to say; but the description of Soma (Zend., Homa) given in Ayur-Veda as translated by F. Max-M\u00fcller points to a plant of the genus Sarcostemma.\n\nWe have in India, besides the above-mentioned plant, Sarcostemma intermedium and S. Brunonianum; the latter, eaten as salad by the natives, is found in the Deccan ascending to 4000 feet on the Neilgherries. Some dry twigs, sent to the writer by Mr. Kursetji R. Cama, of what he calls Homa slightly resemble those of this species and of S. intermedium.\n\nS. Stocksii grows in Sind.\n\nThere is another leafless asclepiad, Periploca aphylla, which is common in Afghanistan, ascending to 3000 feet on the mountains of Persia. Whether it possesses acid juice is not known.\n\nSince writing the above, the twigs used as Soma have been identified as belonging to Ephodra vulgaris, of Gnetaceae, which is found on dry stony hills in Afghanistan, Beluchistan, parts of the Him\u00e1layas, Jhelam, Chenab, and Sutlej; also at Khamaon and inner Sikkim.\n| Page | Line | For | Read |\n|------|------|-----|------|\n| 1    | 3    | of their leaves. | of their flowers. |\n| 2    | 13   | and are eaten | and is eaten |\n| ,,   | 35-36| Flowers brown tomentose, axillary. | Flowers axillary. |\n| ,,   | 41   | jarge, stock | large, stalk |\n| 3    | 42   | 2\u00bd-3 in., thick | 2\u00bc-3 in., linear-oblong, thick |\n| ,,   | 37   | about \u00bd-1 in.; | about \u00bd in.; |\n| ,,   | 9    | 5-lobed, | 5-valved, |\n| 9    | 9-10 | contain large | contain a large |\n| ,,   | 12   | but it is chiefly | but they are chiefly |\n| ,,   | 23   | galls as mordant. | galls as a mordant. |\n| ,,   | 32   | sagittate, purple.

Fl. May-June; it sheds its leaves in the dry season; the new ones appear April-June.\n\nWood is pale-coloured, soft and porous. It is often used as rafts to support fishermen in tanks, and the long dry fruit as floats for fishing nets. It appears that the reddish, mealy, acid pulp surrounding the seeds is refrigerent and diuretic, and is employed as a remedy in dysentery. The leaves, dried and powdered, are eaten mixed with food, and is said to restrain excessive perspiration. The bark has been proposed as a substitute for quinine; its liber affords excellent fibre. (See Fibres.)\n\n**Bombax malabaricum**, D. C.; Brand. For. Fl. 31; *Salmalia malabarica*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 22. *Sawr, saer, somr, semul, shembal, silk-cotton tree*.\n\nA glabrous tree covered with hard conical prickles, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) in., with black points; branches spreading. Leaves digitate, deciduous, 5-7 foliolate; leaflets generally 4-8 in. long, elliptic-oblong to oblong-lanceolate, acuminate or cuspidate at the apex, narrow at the base, glabrous, entire; common petiole as long as or longer than the leaflets; petiolules slender, about 1 in. Flowers numerous, large, scarlet or occasionally white, on short pedicels, fascicled near the ends of branches. Bracteoles 0. Calyx 1 in. long, cup-shaped, thick, coriaceous, irregularly cleft into short, obtuse 3-4 lobes, smooth externally, silk-hairy within. Petals 5, oblong, fleshy, recurved, tomentose externally, pubescent or nearly glabrous inside. Staminal tube shorter than the filaments; the latter thick and shorter than the petals, multi-seriate; 5 innermost divided at the top, each bearing an anther; 10 intermediate ones simple and shorter; the outer numerous and are united into 5 clusters.

Seeds numerous, obovate, smooth, enveloped in silky fine wool.\n\nIt is common in the Bombay Presidency, in the Konkan, Southern Maratha Country and in Gujarat; and all over India, Burma and Ceylon. Alt. 3000 ft. and cultivated as high as 6000 ft.\n\nThis tree attains the height of 60-90 ft. and a girth of 12-15 ft., in favourable circumstances much more. The trunk is straight and its corky bark of a grey ash colour, often marked with cracks. Fl. February-March; Fr. April-May. Sheds its leaves in November and continues leafless till April.\n\nWood very light, white or yellowish-white when fresh cut, becoming darker on exposure, coarse-grained, brittle, perishable, durable only under water, takes no polish. Used for coffins, packing cases, toys, scabbard, planking, fishing floats, and is said to be often rafted with heavier timber to make it float. Canoes are also made of it in Burma. From the bark exudes a gummy juice, which has been thought erroneously to be *mokhra* or *mucherus*, held in high esteem as a demulcent and astringent. It yields gallic and tannic acids, and occurs in more or less large, inodorous, opaque, dark-brown pieces, some of which present such a resemblance to galls, that they are called by some people *supari-ka-phal* (*areca nuts*). The botanical source of *mucherus* is unknown.\n\nThere are sold in the bazar under the name of *safed musli*, small, shrivelled rootlets, highly esteemed as useful in general debility and wasting diseases. They are white or buff-coloured, destitute of taste or odour, 1 or 2 in. long, and of the thickness of a quill. The source of\nthis drug was doubtful; it was supposed by some to be derived from the roots of *Saur* and by others from those of *Curculigo orchidoides*. Mr. Mohideen Shereef, of Madras, has positively stated that the bulbous rootlets of *Asparagus adscendens* are the source of *safed musli*.\n\nThe wool covering the seeds is used in stuffing pillows. The calyx of the flower-bud is eaten as vegetable.\n\n**Eriodendron anfractuosum**, D. C.; Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 22; Grah. Cat. Bby.

Fl. March-April; sheds its leaves in the cold season, and is covered with them in May.\n\nWood whitish, even-grained, soft and light; takes a fine polish. This tree exudes a fragrant gum-resin, which is sold in the bazaars under the name of *gugula* or *gugal*, which is believed to be the *bdellium* of old writers; it occurs in brittle tears of various sizes and of a red yellow or brownish colour, with a bitterish balsamic taste, and which probably furnishes part of the myrrh which is sold in Bombay. The *gugal* is said to be collected in the cold season by making incisions in the tree, and letting the resin fall on the ground. This accounts for the dirty condition in which it is imported into this city. The authors of the Bombay Flora, describing a plant from Kh\u00e2ndesh under the name of *B. Roxburghii* believed to be *B. mukul*, write:\u2014\u201cThe whole plant is aromatic, abounding in a viscid balsamic juice, which is exported in considerable quantities from Oomrawatty.\u201d\n\n**B.

Leafless February-April, and the new leaves appear soon after.\n\nThe wood is of a reddish-brown colour, hard, and very strong, even-grained, tough, and proper for naves of wheels and railway sleepers. The tree produces an abundance of flowers from which a strong spirit, called Maurah, is distilled in large quantities for exportation in Uran, Surat and Poona. Being sweetish to the taste these flowers are voraciously consumed by the poorer classes to whom they are a nourishing food. During the famine of 1873 and 1874 in Beh\u00e1r they kept thousands of people from starvation. A single tree is said to yield from 200 to 400 lbs. of flowers. From the seeds a greenish-yellow oil is expressed; the oil-cake is stated to be used to poison fish, and the smoke produced from burning it to kill insects and rats. The residuum left after the expression of the oil is used as an emetic. (See Section Fruits, Vegetables and Plants used during seasons of scarcity.)\n\nB. longifolia, Linn.; Dalz. & Gibs. Bby.

It would evidently be inconvenient and cumbersome to treat of, say, the mango as a fruit in one place, of mango as a pickle in another, of mango jelly or jam in a third, or of the dried strips of green mangoes that enter into the composition of various Indian curries in a fourth. Such a system would cause not only endless reference, but would in no way improve the value of the subject that is being treated. Hence the adoption of the above heading.\n\nAlmost all the species of plants belonging to the orders Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Dioscorideae, and Aroidae contain more or less acrid and poisonous principles. In some these principles are minimised or destroyed by cultivation, although apt to re-appear at times. In others the simple process of steeping in water is enough to effect the desired object; whereas in others, again, boiling once or oftener becomes necessary before the plants can be considered edible and harmless. Some creepers in themselves harmless, when allowed to climb trees that contain poisonous principles, become poisonous by absorption; as is the case with the vanilla creeper which, being sometimes made to climb the euphorbiaceous shrub *Jatropha curcas*, has been stated to become possessed of some of the injurious properties of the latter. This is not at all surprising when we remember that the parasitic plants belonging to the order Loranthaceae found growing on the nux-vomica tree have been found to contain the deadly alkaloids of the latter.\n\nWith the exception of the products belonging to the orders just referred to, the plants treated in this chapter are all more or less wholesome, though, it is perhaps needless to add, not equally nutritious. It is also necessary to exclude the pulse of *Lathyrus sativus* and the grain of *Paspalum scrobiculatum*.\n\n*Lathyrus sativus*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 322; Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 22. Chuckling vetch; known in Bombay by the name of lang, and in Bengal and the North-West Provinces by that of kesari or teori.\n\nIt is a small, annual, herbaceous, leguminous plant found growing in Europe, Asia and Africa, and is also cultivated in Gujar\u00e1t, the North-West Provinces and Bengal.\n\n*For the description of the trees mentioned in this and in the following sections, see the section Timber Trees. The description of small plants is rather short.*\nThis is a species of wild vetch, the dhall of which is well known to the people of Central and Northern India as producing very injurious consequences when eaten for any length of time. Nevertheless in seasons of great scarcity, when other food-grains are not cheaply procurable, it is freely consumed by the poorer classes. If taken mixed with other sorts of food the use of this grain may be continued for a very long period without producing any dangerous consequences, or perhaps no consequences whatever may follow; but if it forms the sole or principal article of diet, the direst results supervene. At first there is \"weakness and irregular motion of the muscles moving the knees, which are bent and moved with a tremulous irregular motion\" somewhat like that of chorea. As the disease advances, the lower extremities suffer emaciation, and eventually the patient is completely paraplegic. No case of recovery from this last stage appears to have been recorded.\n\nThe disease is one to which attention was first directed in this country by General Sleeman. He was then stationed near Saugor, and says that in the villages about that place the wheat crops were successively destroyed or very deficient in the years 1829, 1830 and 1831. During these three years, however, the kesari had remained uninjured, and large crops of it had been collected upon which the people mainly fed. The result of this food soon made itself manifest. The younger part of the population below the age of thirty began to be deprived of the use of their lower limbs by paralytic strokes more or less severe, and always coming on suddenly, generally when the person was asleep. The subject was taken up by Dr. Kinloch W. Kirk in Upper Sind. A villager had brought him his wife about thirty years old who was suffering from paralysis of the lower extremities. When questioned as to what he thought the cause to be, the man replied: \"It is from kesari; we are very poor, and she was obliged to eat it for five months on end.\" Dr. Kirk hereupon instituted enquiries into the subject, which confirmed the statement; and he adds that \"the natives know that this dhall is poison, but they eat it, because it is cheap, thinking that they can stop in time to save themselves from its consequences.\"\n\nDr. Irving, who went into the subject of palsy caused by the use of *Lathyrus sativus* more extensively, has published long tables showing that, in all the districts of the North-West Provinces where this grain is used as an article of food, injurious effects are believed to follow. He says that, if used occasionally and in small quantity, the results may be constipation, colic, or some form of indigestion; but if freely used, and especially without admixture of any other sort of grain, palsy of the lower limbs is very apt to occur. Dr. Irving's tables further show that these ill-effects are most apt to be produced in the rainy season, and that the great majority of the sufferers are males, the proportion being 6:11 males to only 0:59 females paralysed. He also suggests that the disease known in Bengal as *kumree*, which attacks the loins of horses, may perhaps be due to feeding upon grain largely adulterated with kesari dhall.\n\nThere is a form of palsy to be met within the Malabar Coast and Ceylon, formerly named barbiers, which somewhat resembles the disease we have just been speaking about. Its principal characters are, according to Dr. Copland, \"tremor with pricking, formicating pain, numbness of the extremities, chiefly of the lower, followed by contractions and paralysis of the limbs, inarticulation and hoarseness of voice, emaciation and sinking of all the vital powers.\" It is said to be violent on the Malabar Coast during the months of January, February and March, and to attack such as unwarily sleep exposed to the land winds of the morning. Severe cases of this disease are scarcely, if ever, amenable to treatment so long as the season continues and the winds have not shifted, but it readily yields with a change to the eastward.\nNow this barbiers has many points of resemblance to the paralysis of *Lathyrus sativus*, but there are well-marked differences which serve to distinguish one disease from the other. The latter generally comes on suddenly at night without any warning, and always in the rainy season, is incurable, always attacks the lower extremities, prefers males to females, the sense of feeling is unaffected, and life itself is not shortened. Barbiers, on the other hand, prefers the cold season, is curable by change and treatment, attacks any portion of the body, shows no preference for either sex, and most decidedly impairs the vital powers. Then the symptoms of barbiers are never attributed to eating any grain.\n\nWhile on this subject it may be as well to mention that there are two varieties of *Lathyrus sativus*, only one of which is supposed by some to be noxious. This theory is, however, one that does not meet much favour, for *Lathyrus sativus* not only produces ill-effects in India, but similar effects have also been observed in Europe, as may be seen from the following extract taken from Don's General System of Gardening and Botany:\n\n\"*Lathyrus sativus*; native of Spain, France and Italy. The seeds of *Lathyrus sativus* are commonly sown in Switzerland, for soiling horses, under the name of *gosse*. In several parts of the Continent a white, light, pleasant bread is made from the flour of the pulse, but it produced such dreadful effects in the seventeenth century that the use of it was forbidden by an edict of George, Duke of Wurtenberg, in 1671, and was enforced by two other edicts under his successor, Leopold, in 1705 and 1714. Mixed with wheat flour in half the quantity, it makes a very good bread, and appears to be harmless. But bread made with this flour exclusively has brought on a most surprising rigidity of the limbs in those who use it for a continuance, in so much that the exterior (extensor?) muscles could not by any means be reduced or have their natural action restored. These symptoms usually appear on a sudden without any previous pain. The disease was regarded as incurable, and being neither very painful nor fatal, those who were seized with it usually submitted to it with patience. Swine fattened with this meal, lost the use of their limbs, but grew very fat lying on the ground. A horse fed some months on the dried herb was said to have his legs perfectly rigid. Kine are reported to grow lean on it, but sheep not to be affected. Pigeons, especially young, lose the power of walking by feeding on the seeds. Poultry will not readily touch it, but geese eat it without any apparent damage. In some parts of Switzerland cattle feed on the herb without any apparent harm.\"\n\nDuvernoy Fubbroni of Florence says that\u2014\n\n\"The Government there had cautioned the peasants against the use of *Lathyrus sativus* in 1786; swine having lost the use of their limbs and became pitiable monsters by being fed on the pulse exclusively. The peasants, however, eat it boiled or mixed with wheat flour in the quantity of one-fourth without any harm.\"\n\nNor are the ravages that arise from the use of this dhall confined to man. Horses are believed to be equally subject to its ill-effects; but it is not yet established how far cattle, poultry, &c., are susceptible to its baneful influences. I may, therefore, perhaps avail myself of the present opportunity to call the attention of the members, principally of such as have frequent occasions to travel in the interior, to this subject, in the hope that they may, when occasions arise, investigate the subject, and thus help to throw light upon an as yet unsettled question.\n\n**Paspalum scrobiculatum**, Roxb. Fl. Ind. i. 278 and 279; Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 97. Kodra, kodri, pakodri.\n\nIt is a graminaceous plant, about 1-2 in. high. Grows in hilly parts about the commencement of the rainy season; the grain becomes ripe for harvest in November and December.\n\nSeveral varieties of this grain are mentioned by the natives, the differences in them being probably due to differences in the soil, method of cultivation, &c. Two sorts are, however, well known: the wholesome and the unwholesome. The former is smaller and paler than the next, and goes by the name of pechadi or harkin in the Konkan. In Goa it is called pakod. The unwholesome variety is called dhone or mojari.\nFood Plants.\n\nharik in the Konkan and mana kodra in Gujar\u00e1t. In Sanskrit it is named kodrava (injurious). The grain is the only poisonous part of the plant.\n\nAlthough the two principal varieties have been styled respectively wholesome and unwholesome, the arrangement is only one of convenience, for all the varieties are, as a matter of fact, more or less poisonous, and the highly poisonous seed of one locality when sown in a different soil from that which produced it, may yield a grain whose properties have become either modified or intensified according to the peculiarities of the two localities.\n\nThe black kodra, decidedly the most poisonous, shows, according to Surgeon-Major Pirie, the following characters under the microscope:\u2014\n\n\"The outer coat or husk has a dark outline of a fungus-like character and on the internal surface appears to consist of minute roundish cells containing dark spores.\" Several authorities have failed to recognize this fungus-like character in which is supposed to reside the poisonous principle;\u2014the fact, however, that kodra grain freshly reaped if left unstacked in the fields for some days when it was rainy and wet had become possessed of decidedly more poisonous properties than grain from the same field harvested and stacked when the weather was dry,\u2014together with the generally acknowledged truth that a very poisonous seed has under peculiarities of soil and cultivation yielded a comparatively harmless grain seems to bear out the fungus theory. Nevertheless the subject is one that can hardly be supposed to be sufficiently studied, and demands a great deal of close investigation. Though every part of the grain is poisonous, the husk and testa are more so; hence the natives take good care to separate the light grain, by means of water in which it floats, from the heavy and less injurious one.\n\nKodra grain is a common article of food with all the poor people in India. They prepare it by macerating it for 3 or 4 hours or more in a watery solution of cowdung, when the scum and hollow grain which rise to the surface are separated, and the good grain removed and spread out in the sun to dry. This process is repeated so long as any poison is suspected to remain in the grain. Boiling does not entirely destroy the poison, but if the grain is kept for a number of years its poisonous properties are found to diminish. When required for use it is ground in earthen mills, which remove the pericarp and then pounded and winnowed, which separates the different layers of the testa, and leaves the grain fit for use. Kodra is cooked sooner than common rice, and is very commonly used in the Konkan, where it is generally eaten both by men and cattle with whey, which latter is supposed to have the property of neutralizing its poison. Notwithstanding all precautions, however, cases of poisoning do occasionally occur, though they seem rarely attended with fatal consequences. Surgeon-Major Pirie, who has described a case of kodra poisoning (vide Transactions of the Medical and Physical Society of Bombay, 1869, No. 9, New Series) thus enumerates the symptoms:\u2014\n\n\"Unconsciousness, delirium with violent tremors of the voluntary muscles, pupils dilated, pulse small and weak, skin cold and covered with profuse perspiration, and difficulty in swallowing.\"\n\nFourteen persons belonging to four indigent families were taken to him suffering from the above symptoms. They had come on about 6 hours after the kodra had been eaten, and in extreme cases had lasted 18 hours. All had recovered under emetics, stimulants, warm clothing, and heat applied to the surface.\n\nIt will have been remarked by such members as belong to the medical profession that the symptoms given above are much like those of poisoning from datura, except the tremors, which are not met with in the last.\n\nThe regular use of kodra seems to establish a sort of tolerance of the\ngrain; but it is believed by people that if partaken with black pepper, even by habitual consumers, deleterious effects soon show themselves.\n\nThe evil effects of unwholesome kodra are far more severe in beasts than in man, due, no doubt, to their eating the grain, husk and all, and also to the absence of vomiting, an effect that almost always takes place in man. It proves fatal in quantities of about two and a half ounces to such large quadrupeds as horses, cows, &c., (more so to the former), and has also been known to kill buffaloes, goats, and asses. The active principle that produces these fearful effects has not, as far as I am aware, been yet isolated.\n\nNatives have various antidotes for kodra poisoning. The most usual ones are gruel made of the flour of urid (Phaseolus radiatus), the expressed juice of the stem of the plantain which is rich in tannin and the alkaline salts; the astringent juice of the leaves of Psidium guayara, or the leaves of Nyctanthes arbor tristis. Whey has already been mentioned before. It is used in Daman and the neighbouring villages.\n\n**DILLENIACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Dillenia Indica*, Brand. For. Fl. 1.\u2014*D. speciosa*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby.

A palatable jelly is made from them.\n\n*D. pentagyna*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 2. *Karmal.*\n\nThe fruit, size of a gooseberry, is eaten. The flower-buds and young fruits have a pleasant acid flavour and are eaten raw or cooked in the Central Provinces.\n\n**ANONACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Anona reticulata*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 2. *Anona*, Goa; *ram-phal* or *ram-phala*, Dec.\u2014called *bullock's heart* from its resemblance to it.\n\nThe fruit is not so good as the custard-apple, but is accepted in the absence of the latter.\n\n*A. squamosa*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 2. *Custard-apple; atta*, Goa; *sita-phal*, Dec. and Bby.\n\nThe fruit is of the size of a large apple; when well ripe, it bursts on being raised, and is decidedly of a most delicate flavour, on which account it must be protected from the ravages of birds and squirrels. The seeds, well pounded, are made into a kind of ointment in the Southern Maratha Country and Goa to destroy lice in the hair.\n\n**NYMPHACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Nymphaea lotus*, Uplea-kamal; *Nymphaea stellata*, Uplea-kamal; and *Nelubium speciosum*, Paisar-kamal. Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 6 and 7.\n\nThese water-lilies are found in tanks throughout the Konkan. Their flowers are of various hues. The tuberous roots and the scapes\u2014the latter known as *bishi* in the bazars\u2014are much esteemed as an article of food.\n\nThe immature berries, torus and seeds are eaten raw or in curries, pickled, or ground and mixed with flour are baked into bread. The\nripe berries are roasted and eaten: they are very palatable, and not a bad substitute for almonds. A syrup or confection is made from the petals, and used as a cooling drink or medicine.\n\n**PAPAVERACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Papaver somniferum.* *Afim* or *amal*, *afu*; *kadavi* (Marathi name of capsule).\n\nThe plant has been cultivated in India, Turkey, Asia Minor, Egypt, China, &c., from the earliest times for the sake of the juice of its capsules, named *post* or *poss*\u2014the inspissated juice being known as opium.\n\nThe seeds called *kas-kas*, very small, size of a millet grain, white, are eaten roasted, in curries, and made into various kinds of sweets. The oil of the seeds is sweet, and is used for culinary purposes and lamps. The seeds partially roasted and mixed with sugar and cardamoms act as a gentle purgative, useful in mild cases of dysentery in infants.\n\nThe use of opium has been known from the earliest times. In the writings of the younger Mesue, who died A.D. 1015, the syrup of poppies is recommended as a sedative in coughs and catarrhs, and in the first edition of the *Ricettario Fiorentino* published in 1498, which is the earliest pharmacopoeia known, a formula for the syrup is given under the name *Siroppo di Papaveri semplici di Mesue*. In the pharmacopoeia of the London College (1618) it is prescribed as *Syrupus de Meconio Mesue*. Long before this, however, Scribonius Largus had noticed the method of procuring opium in his *Compositiones Medicamentorum* (circa A.D. 40), and the drug was likewise known to Dioscorides, Pliny and Theophrastus. Coming nearer our own times, we find Pyres speaking of Egyptian and Cambay opium in his letters to D. Manuel, King of Portugal, and a little later Garcia d'Orta tells us that the opium of Cambay was collected in Malwa and was soft and yellowish. The advent of opium into India is connected with the spread of Mahomedanism, and was very probably favoured by the prohibition of wine inculcated by that religion. Barbosa is the earliest European who described opium as a product of India.\n\nThe cultivation of the poppy-plant is carried on to a large extent in India, the principal regions distinguished for the production of opium being the districts of Behar and Benares, the broad table-lands of Malwa and the slopes of the Vindhya Hills. The plant requires a rich moist soil, and is injuriously affected by heavy rains. In Behar the sowing takes place at the beginning of November, and the capsules are scarified in February, March and April. The scarification has to be repeated on different sides of the capsule at intervals of a few days, and the milky juice which flows is scraped off early on the following morning with an iron scoop, and being treated for the removal of *pasiva*, which is a dark coffee-coloured fluid which collects at the bottom of the vessel, is exposed to the action of air (never to the sun) until it acquires the proper degree of dryness. This drying operation, which still leaves behind about 30 per cent. of moisture, occupies between three and four weeks, and the opium is now ready for sale at the Government factory.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the quantity of opium produced in India, but in the official year ending 31st March 1872, 98,364 chests valued at \u00a313,365,228 were exported from Bengal and Bombay, the net revenue from which to the Government of India was \u00a37,657,213.\n\n**CRUCIFER\u00c6.**\n\n*Brassica oleracea*, Dalz, & Gibs.

Fl. 99. *Water-chestnut, shingaro.*\nFound in Asia and tropical Africa; common in tanks in the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t. Very extensively cultivated in Cashmere, and the Cashmere authorities admit it that for five months, during the late famine, 3,000 human beings lived on the nut of this plant, and that an annual revenue of \u00a3100,000, or ten l\u0101khs of rupees, was derived therefrom.\n\nColonel Sleeman in his \"Rambles\" gives the following account of this plant in the North-West Provinces:\n\n\"Here, as in most other parts of India, the tanks get spoiled by the water-chestnut (shingara) which is everywhere as regularly planted and cultivated in fields under a large surface of water as wheat or barley is on the dry plains. It is cultivated by a class of men called Dheemurs, who are everywhere fishermen and palankeen-bearers; and they keep boats for the planting, weeding and gathering the shingara. The holdings or tenements of each cultivator are marked out carefully on the surface of the water by long bamboos stuck up in it; and they pay so much the acre for the portion they till. The long straws of the plants reach up to the surface of the water, upon which float their green leaves; and their pure white flowers expand beautifully among them in the latter part of the afternoon. The nut grows under the water after the flowers decay, and is of a triangular shape and covered with a tough brown integument adhering strongly to the kernel, which is white, esculent, and of a fine cartilagenous texture. The people are very fond of these nuts, and they are carried often upon bullocks' backs 2 or 3 hundred miles to market. They ripen in the latter end of the rains or in September, and are eatable till the end of November. The rent paid for an ordinary tank by the cultivator is about 100 rupees a year. I have known 200 rupees to be paid for a very large one, and even 300, or 30 pounds a year. But the mud increases so rapidly from this cultivation that it soon destroys all reservoirs in which it is permitted; and where it is thought desirable to keep up the tank for the sake of the water, it should be carefully prohibited.\"\n\n**PASSIFLORACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Carica papaya*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 37. *Poppai.*\n\nThe fruit, which is as big as an ordinary cocoanut, is pale-yellow when ripe, presenting the tempting appearance of a ripe mango when cut open. It has a sweetish taste, and makes an excellent tart. It resembles the apple in taste, and is substituted for the sauce of the latter fruit. It has the property of making meat hung on the branches of the tree, tender; the green fruit is also mixed with meat when set to boil for the same purpose, and also cut into slices and eaten as vegetable. It is also pickled.\n\n*Passiflora quadrangularis*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 38. *Square-stalked passion-flower; common granadilla.*\n\nCultivated.

The unripe fruit, about 2-4 in. long, ovate, is bitter, but after being boiled is eaten in curries. The seeds are said to be anti-febrile; the whole plant is bitter, and is used in moderate doses as anti-periodic and for promoting digestion. In larger doses it acts as purgative and emetic.\n\n**Lagenaria vulgaris**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 36. *Harrea-kuddu* (Dec.), *tumbi, bobora branca* of the Portuguese.\n\nSupposed to be a native of India and tropical Africa, but now cultivated throughout the tropics.

Bby. Fl. 103; and *C. cicatrisatus* described\nby Dr. Stocks (a variety of the last) are said to be parents of the cultivated species:\n\n\"This appears to me to be far the most useful species of *cucumis* that I know; when little more than one-half grown they are oblong and a little downy; in this state they are pickled; when ripe they are about as large as an ostrich's egg, smooth and yellow; when cut they have much the flavour of the melon, and will keep good for several months, if carefully gathered without being bruised and hung up; they are also in this stage eaten raw, and much used in curries by the natives.\n\n\"The seeds, like those of the other *cucurbitaceous* fruits, contain much farinaceous matter blended with a large portion of mild oil; the natives dry and grind them into a meal, which they employ as an article of diet; they also express a mild oil from them, which they use in food and to burn in their lamps. Experience as well as analogy prove these seeds to be highly nourishing and well deserving of a more extensive culture than is bestowed on them at present.\n\n\"The powder of the toasted seeds mixed with sugar is said to be a powerful diuretic, and serviceable in promoting the passage of sand and gravel.\n\n\"As far as my observation and information goes, this agriculture is chiefly confined to the Guntoor Circar, where these seeds form a considerable branch of commerce; they are mixed with those of *Holcus sorghum* or some other of the large culmiferous tribe and sown together; these plants run on the surface of the earth, and help to shade them from the sun, so that they mutually help each other.\n\n\"The fruit I observed above keeps well for several months if carefully gathered and suspended.

Many of those who have gone to M\u00e2ther\u00e2n must have seen the natives at the foot of this hill collecting the flowers of the *mowah* which are much esteemed by them, and indeed during the famine of 1873-74 at Beh\u00e2r they are said to have kept thousands of people from starvation. They have a sweetish smell and taste. The seeds of the *mowah* yield by expression a greenish yellow oil which is used by unscrupulous dealers for adulterating ghee. It is also used in making soap in Kaira. The oil cake is employed for poisoning fish, and when burnt its smoke is reported to be a good insecticide and to kill rats also.

Suppl. 77.\nFood Plants.\n\nThe tapioca, mandioca and cassava plant introduced by the Portuguese in Goa, and has thence spread into gardens, and is extensively cultivated in Cochin, Travancore, and throughout Southern India. Birdwood quotes the following from Monardes and Piso:\n\n\"The rasped root mixed with water, boiled and fermented, yields a liquor called cassiri. Cassava meal is obtained by subjecting the grated root to pressure to express the juice, and then drying and pounding the residual cake. Of this meal cassava-bread is made. The expressed juice by repose deposits the farina called cassava starch or tapioca. A sauce called cassareep or cassireep is made from the juice.\"\n\nThe juice of the root is poisonous, and is said to be used by South Americans for poisoning their arrows. This poison, known as mandioca poison, is obtained by distillation, although it can only be expelled by the roots being roasted or boiled. Cases are reported of people being poisoned by incautiously eating the root before it is properly baked or boiled. The tapioca is a nourishing food, and affords a light diet for sick people. Cassava flour is also nourishing, and many poor people in Travancore and Southern India use it as food during the rainy months when rice is scarce and dear.\n\nURTICACE\u00c6.\n\nArtocarpus integrifolia, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 244. Jack-fruit-tree, jaca, panas.\n\nThis tree is found in most parts of India producing about the largest known fruit, which is of two kinds\u2014ghilla or the soft, and kaja or the hard kind, the latter being very generally preferred. The two varieties are known here and in Goa as rassal and kappa. It is said that a thick jelly-like substance of an agreeable melon-like taste can be made by boiling the pulp in fresh milk and straining the whole. The seeds, roasted or boiled, are eaten, and are as good as chestnuts. The unripe fruits and seeds are eaten as vegetable.\n\nA. incisa, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 79.

The fruit, of which there are many varieties\u2014white, purple and black, acid and sweet\u2014is eaten.\n\n**PIPERACE\u00c6.**\n\n**Piper nigrum**, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 84. *Miri, kalamiri.*\n\nDenuded of its outer covering it is called *safed-miri* (white pepper). Terete, woody stems rooting from the lower nodes, coriaceous, alternate, petioled, broad-ovate leaves, cordate, 5-ribbed at the base with 2 strong ones arising from the mid-rib immediately above these, monococious or dioecious spikes arising opposite the leaves, 2 anthers, 5-6 stigmas, and a sessile fruit size of a pea. The part used in commerce is the dry wrinkled fruit employed as a condiment and in medicine. It is cultivated throughout India from the earliest ages and in this Presidency from Sind up to Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and over some of the gh\u00e1ts. The fruits of the following plants are said to be substituted for true pepper:\u2014*Nigela sativa; Zantoxylon Badrunga; Z. Rhetsa; Vitez negundo or bicolor;* and *Myrtus communis.*\n\nThe pepper vine is indigenous to Malab\u00e1r and Travancore, and is now cultivated throughout India, Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra and West Indies. The plant is propagated by being planted on a rich soil near the trees on which or bamboo poles it is made to climb. It attains the height of 20-30 ft., but is usually kept down.\n\nPepper is one of the spices earliest used by mankind, it having for many ages been the staple article of trade between Europe and India. It was known to be of two kinds (black and long) to Theophrastus who flourished in the fourth century, and in the time of Pliny the long variety used to be sold for 15, the white for 7, and the black for 4 *denarii* the pound. It began to be more generally used in Europe during the Middle Ages, and was the \"very symbol of the spice trade to which Genoa, Venice and the commercial cities of Central Europe were indebted for a large part of their wealth; and its importance as a means of promoting commercial activity during the Middle Ages, and the civilizing intercourse of nation with nation can scarcely be overrated.\"\n\n**Piper betle**, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 84. *Betel-leaf plant, p\u00e1n.*\n\nScandent shrub rooting at the lower nodes, leaves alternate, membranous; bract ovate, cordate, 7-ribbed at the base with 2 more ribs rising immediately above these, from the mid-rib, spikes half a foot long arising opposite the leaves, and a globose fruit size of a pea.\n\nIt is cultivated throughout India, and in various places in this Presidency, but that which is produced in Poona, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and above the gh\u00e1ts is preferred. A large quantity is brought down from these places to\nFood Plants.\n\nBombay. It is chiefly consumed here, and partly exported to Karachi. The leaves are used as a masticatory folded with powdered cardamom, chalk, and areca-nut. They are carminative and stomachic, and assist in promoting digestion. In S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Poona the betel-vines are planted near the roots of *Melia azadarach*, *Moringa pterigosperma* and *Sesbania Aegyptiaca* over which they are made to climb. Besides giving support these trees afford the necessary shade, which is much needed for their successful cultivation. Bamboo posts are also used for support.\n\n**LORANTHACE\u00c6.**\n\nThe fruits of several parasitic species belonging to this order contain sweet mucilage, which is chewed by hill people.\n\n**SANTALACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Osyris Wightiana*, Dalz. & Gibs.

Sp.\u2014*M. sapientum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 88. *Common plantain, banana, khela.*\n\nCultivated throughout the tropics. Of this plant there are several varieties, all producing fruits of a peculiar pleasant taste which are designated by the general name *plantain*. The ripe fruit denuded of its rind is often cut in longitudinal slices and dried in the sun, and kept in well-covered jars to be used at desert. The dried plantain is an article of commerce in Bombay and many parts of India. An excellent jelly is made varying in consistency according as it is wished for immediate use or to be preserved for a length of time. In Mauritius, West Indies and South America the fruit dried in the sun is reduced to powder, and this powder is given as a light, nourishing food to infants and invalids. It is stated that the banana is highly nutritious, and equally with the potato is fitted to sustain the strength of the human body. The flowers, unripe fruit, tender spathes and spadix eaten as vegetable.\n\n*Zinziber officinale*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 87.\n\nThe fresh root is called *alch* or *alem, adu, adrack*; the dry root *sunt* or *sunta*. A small, annual, reed-like plant with distichous radical leaves.\n\nIt is indigenous to Asia, and is now cultivated throughout India, tropical America, Africa and Queensland in Australia. It is planted in May or beginning of June, and the produce is gathered in the following February and March or earlier. The tuberous roots form the *alch* of commerce, and are used as condiment.\n\n*Curcuma longa*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 87. *Halad or halada, haldi.*\nIs indigenous to Southern India, and is now cultivated in various parts of the country, and used as condiment or for dyeing. In Gujarat and Kaira it is planted towards the end of May, and yield from 60-300 mannds (of 26 lbs. each) per bigah. The halad of commerce is the tuberous root roasted to dryness in ovens.\n\n**C. Angustifolia**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 274. *East Indian arrow-root plant, tickar.*\n\nIt is an annual plant springing up at the beginning of the rains. Bulbs with oblong tubers hanging from the fibres; leaves narrow, lanceolate petioled; striated with fine longitudinal lines, petioles 6-10 in. long; spike radical, 4-6 in. long, crowned with a coma of purple bracts, flowers yellow, large, expanding in the morning and fading at sunset. It grows wild in various parts of India, Travancore, Nagpore, etc., and in Bombay at Ram Gh\u00e1t.\n\nThis species is said to yield a portion of what is called *Travancore arrowroot*. There is no doubt that curcuma arrowroot (known in this country as tickar, and to Europeans as *East India arrowroot*) is extensively manufactured in Southern India, specially in Cochin, Travancore and Kanara, but in a very rude manner, the granules resembling much those of *Marantha arundinacea*, which is also cultivated in India, and in fact what is called tickar arrowroot is often the produce of the latter plant, or curcuma starch mixed with that of cassava or tapioca plant.\n\nThere exists much confusion regarding the curcumas yielding tickars. Royle says:\n\n\"The pendulous tubers of *Curcuma rubescens*, *C. leucorrhiza*, and *C. angustifolia* yield a very beautiful fecula or starch which forms an excellent substitute for the West Indian arrowroot, *Marantha arundinacea*. It is sold in the bazars of Benares, Chittagong and Travancore, and eaten by the natives; a very excellent kind called tickar is also made at Patna and Boglipore from the tubers of *Batatas* (*Ipomea edulis*).\"\n\nDrury thus describes the mode of preparing arrowroot at Travancore:\n\n\"The tubers are first scraped on a rough stick, generally part of the stem of the common rattan, or any plant with rough prickles to serve the same purpose. Thus pulverised the flour is thrown into a chatty of water, where it is kept for about two hours; all impurities being carefully removed from the surface. It is then taken out, and again put into fresh water, and so on for the space of four or five days. The flour is ascertained to have lost its bitter taste when a yellowish tinge is communicated to the water, the whole being stirred up, again strained through a piece of coarse cloth, and put in the sun to dry. It is then ready for use.\u2014Roxb. Pers. Obs.\"\n\n**C. caulina**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 275. *Chowar.*\n\nLarge bulb with oblong tubers pendulous from the fibres. Leaves 12-20 in. long, upper alternate, short-petioled, frequently tinged red. Scape leafy, 2-3 ft. high. Coma of white bracts. Flowers yellow.\n\nVery common at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. First described by the late Mr. Graham of the Bombay Civil Service.\n\n*Curcuma caulina* grows at Mah\u00e1baleshvar abundantly, and for many years the Chinese ticket-of-leave men used to manufacture arrowroot from it, and sell it to the Commissariat, and in the bazars at Bombay. In 1878 a European prepared a few hundred pounds of it, and sent samples to be tried by Messrs. Treacher & Co., Phillips & Co., and Kemp & Co., but it was\nFood Plants.\n\nfound wanting in nutritive properties, though no objection was made to the colour and taste. That it is inferior to West Indian arrowroot, may be gathered from its market value, 5 to 6 lbs. to the rupee.\n\nDuring the famine of 1877 it was recommended to the suffering poor, but they never used it except in extreme scarcity.\n\nThe preparation of arrowroot at Mah\u00e1baleshvar is simple. The root (of which a cooly will gather 4 or 5 large basketsful a day for as many annas) is scraped, washed and rubbed to pulp on a grater, as mortars are found to crush the globales. The pulp must then be washed no less than a dozen times at least, the sediment being stirred at each washing. The dark scum on the sediment and the muddiness of the water of the first washing slowly disappear, till when the sediment is pure white it is allowed to harden into a cake, which is afterwards reduced to powder. A basketful of roots yields 3-4 lbs. of pure arrowroot.\n\nC. pseudo-montana, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 275. Sinderwani, sinderbur, sindelwan, hellounda.\n\nBulb oblong with round, small, potato-like tubers, hanging from the fibres. Leaves including the petiole 2-3 ft. long, narrow at both ends, 6-19 in. broad in the middle, quite green. Coma of a beautiful dark-rose colour, waved. Flowers yellow; appear in September.\n\nThis plant, which was first described by Mr. J. Graham, is common in the Konkan, where it arises at the beginning of the rainy season. The tubers, which are perfectly white inside, are boiled and eaten by the people during seasons of scarcity. Perhaps this plant, too, yields a part of East India arrowroot; that which comes from Ratn\u00e1giri is manufactured from its tubers.\n\nElettaria cardamomum, Maton.\u2014Alpinia cardamomum, Roxb. Fl. Ind. i. 70; Cor. Pl. t. 226. Ilachi, Malabari-ilachi, cardamom.\n\nA perennial plant with erect jointed stem, 6-12 ft. high. Leaves lanceolate, acuminate 1-2 ft. long, on long sheathing petioles. Flowers greenish-white, alternate, short-peduncled on lax, flexuous, horizontal scapes 6-18 in. long, which are thrown out in number of 3-4 close to the ground. Capsule oval, 3-sided, 3-valved, smooth. Seeds numerous, angular, dark.\n\nThe cardamom plant grows wild in the Anamallay, Cochin and Travancore forests, and in K\u00e1nara, and is also cultivated there as well as in Wynaad, Coorg, etc. There occurs in Ceylon a plant described by some authors as Elettaria major which yields a fruit elongated in form and larger in size. This is a mere variety of E. cardamomum.\n\nThe seeds are used as condiment, a carminative in medicine, and chewed along with areca-nut and betel leaf. It is said that Ceylon cardamom is much used in Russia, Germany, Sweden and Norway for flavouring cakes and for the manufacture of liqueurs.\n\nORCHID\u00c6.\n\nEulophia herbacea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 265.\n\nA small plant with a potato-like root found in the Konkan and Himalaya.\n\nThis orchid, E. campestris, and probably some others are said to be the source of the best salep of India. Dr. Royle believes that E. vera yields the best salep of this country.\nThere are sold in the bazaars, under the name of *banavatisalem*, an imitation of salep tubers made of wheaten flour. There are also sold another kind of tubers, or rather pseudo-bulbs, under the name of *badassahisalem* the source of which is unknown. It is very cheap and a poor substitute for true salep. There are in Europe and Asia many orchids with tubers more or less large, capable of yielding salep. The following species are some of those which have been actually tried:\u2014*O. maculata; O. saccifera; O. latifolia; O. conopsca; O. longieruris; O. ustulata; O. mascula*, etc.\n\nSalep is extensively used as a nutritive substance and a tonic, specially of the sexual organs, though it is very dear. The powdered salep is not easily mixed with water: for preparing a sort of congee or decoction powdered salep must be first stirred with a little spirit of wine, water must then be added, and the whole boiled. The proportions are\u2014salep one drachm, spirit 1\u00bd drachm, and water half a pint. Natives boil the powder in a large quantity of water till the latter is reduced to half the quantity by evaporation.\n\n**Vanilla planifolia**, Andr.\u2014*V. aromatica*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 85.\n\nIt is a plant striking roots on the trunks of trees on which it is made to climb, with fleshy leaves and large green flowers and obscurely triquetrous pod, size of a small finger.\n\nIt is indigenous to the Tierra Caliente of Mexico, but now generally cultivated throughout the tropics of both the New and Old World. In Bombay it was introduced about half a century ago by the late Colonel Jervis. It grows vigorously at Siwri, where it has been re-introduced by a graduate of Grant Medical College, Mr. Furdoonjee, and at Goa by Mr. M. R. de Quadros in his plantation at Sattari. It has been also introduced on a large scale in the Mauritius, and from 1867 in the French colony of R\u00e9union. For the effects of vanilla which has been made to climb the trunk of *Jatropha curcas*, see the general observations made at the beginning of this chapter.\n\nVanilla is chiefly used for flavouring chocolate, ices, creams and confectionery in general.\n\n**IRIDE\u00c6.**\n\n*Crocus sativus*, Royle Ill. Himal. Bot. t. 90. *Safran, kessar* or *kecara*.\n\nIt is a small beautiful crocus, with a fleshy corm, grassy leaves, purple flower, with 3 large orange-brown stigmas on a thread-like style.\n\nThis crocus is supposed to be indigenous to Greece, Asia Minor and perhaps Persia, but is now cultivated throughout the world\u2014Cashmere, China, France, Spain, Austria, United States, etc.\n\nThe part used consists of the styles and stigmas which have a powerful aromatic odour, and when rubbed on moistened fingers leave an orange yellow tint. Saffron is extensively used in this country in religious ceremonies and flavouring and colouring sweets, rice, and food in general.\n\nIt is believed to be antispasmodic and emmenagogue, and is employed in native medicine. Saffron is also used as condiment in Austria, Germany, some districts of Switzerland, etc. It is said that in Cornwall the practice of colouring cakes and other sweets with it is still prevalent.\nFood Plants.\n\nTACCACE\u00c6.\n\nTacca pinatifida, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 172.\n\nRoot tuberous, often as large as a child's head, round, smooth. Leaves radical, long-petioled, large, 3-partite; divisions pinnatifid down to a narrow wing with irregular acute segments; in fact, they resemble those of *Amorphophalus campanulatus*. Flowers greenish in a dense umbel, subtended by several leafy bracts, and numerous long drooping filiform filaments or barren pedicels. Stamens 6, inserted at the throat of the perianth, with coloured filaments and mushroom-like peltate stigma. Ovary inferior, one-celled, with three parietal placentas. Fruit baccate, globose, as large as a plum.\n\nGrows on Warli and Parel Hills in Bombay, and throughout the Konkan (see Grah. Cat. Bby. Pl.); also in the Malay Archipelago. Cultivated at the Mauritins. Roxburgh says that an excellent starch is obtained from the tubers.

Capsule oblong, smooth.\n\nCommon in this Presidency. Both the tuber and the bulb are eaten. All plants of the yam tribe contain an acrid bitter principle, but this is reduced to a minimum under cultivation. After undergoing the process of roasting, steeping in cold water, and boiling, both the tubers and the bulbs become eatable. The best mode of cooking yams is, after the tuber has been boiled, to cover it with hot ashes for half an hour or more. Natives of this country steep the tubers, cut into slices in cold water, and then boil and cook them with various spices and other vegetable.\n\nLILIACE\u00c6.\n\nSmilax ovalifolia, Dalz. & Gibs.

The kernel, which is enveloped by a hard shell, enters into nearly all culinary preparations, such as curries, sweetmeats, etc. The cabbage or tender leaf when boiled is a delicate vegetable. It is also eaten raw, pickled, or made into conserve.\n\n**Borassus flabelliformis**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 278. *Palmyra palm, tad, tadi.*\nThis palm yields a large black fruit containing a gelatinous pellucid pulp called *tad-gollah* in Bombay about the size of an ordinary orange, sometimes larger. The unripe fruit is sometimes pickled, and makes a good conserve. The tender leaf is a good vegetable. The fusiform roots are also eaten by very poor people. Young plants, 2-3 months old, are sold in Bombay under the name of *t\u00e1rta*, and form an important article of food. *(See Brandis about the manufacture of sugar.)*\nPhoenix sylvestris, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 278. Wild date palm, kajuri.\n\nLeaf bud or cabbage and ripe yellow fruit are eaten. The tree is common in Gujarat, Konkan, Bengal and Madras, and is highly esteemed on account of its juice called toddy. This is extracted by removing the lower leaves with their sheaths and cutting a notch into the pith of the tree near the top. The juice issuing from this notch is conducted by a small palm-leaf channel into an earthen vessel placed to receive it. Toddy is abundantly used by the natives as a cooling beverage, being sweet and like the water from a tender cocoanut; it is converted by a process of boiling into sugar, or distilled after allowing it to ferment into a kind of inferior spirit called arak. The tree begins to yield toddy towards the age of 7-10 years, the trunk being then about 4 ft. high, and continues to do so for about 25 years. The juice is extracted from November to February, each tree yielding during that period 180 pints on an average. Twelve pints of toddy can be converted into one of jaggri, and 4 of this into a pound of sugar, so that each tree produces annually between 7-8 lbs. of sugar, which being inferior in quality to cane-sugar sells usually for three-fourths the price of the latter.*\n\nP. dactylifera, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 786. Date palm, kaf\u00fcr. The fruit tamara, rajib, nakel, kurma, chuara.\n\nThis is the common date palm. Is very high, attaining 100-120 ft. Indigenous to the lower part of the Euphrates and Tigris, Doab, Arabia, Syria and Palestine, and the great African Sahara. It is now cultivated in Spain, Italy and Greece. In India it is cultivated but sparsely; it is, however, self-sown in Sind, Mult\u00e1n, Muzaffurgurh, Bundelkund, etc.\n\nThe ripe fruit forms an important article of food of the people of Arabia, Palestine, etc., and is largely consumed in Bombay, where it is known by the name of tamara. In Sind it is called khurma when collected ripe, and chuwarar or chu\u00e1ra where removed before it is fully ripe and boiled and dried in the sun. In the Punjab the produce of the best palm is named chirni; this is usually split in the middle and dried in the sun. The inferior varieties are named pind and bujri. The large, tender, succulent head of the palm, named guddah, gari or galli, is also eaten like cabbage. Indian dates are smaller and less sweet than those imported from Arabia.\n\nAreca catechu, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 95. Betel-nut, areca palm, madi, phopali (Goa and Southern Konkan).\n\nThis palm is extensively cultivated in low shady land in Goa, K\u00e1nara and Sunda for the sake of its fruit called suppari, which is exported to other parts of India. The kernel is chewed with betel-leaf, chunam and cardamoms.\n\n* See Ph. sylvestris in the next section.\nAROIDE\u00c6.\n\nColocasia antiquorum, Schot. Milit. i. 18. Kachu? alu, terem.\n\nStemless. Leaves radical, more or less peltate-ovate, shortly acute at the apex, cordate at the base, with a broad sinus, often above 1 ft. long; primary veins about 4-5 on each side of the mid-rib, pedate at the base of the leaf. The tube or convolute base of the spathe ovoid-oblong, usually about 1\u00bd in. long, neutral portion shorter or nearly equal; the male portion almost twice longer; the terminal appendage acute, varying in length or obsolete. Stigmas sub-sessile.\n\nThis excellent arum varies in the size of its leaves, and the length of its spathes, spadices and appendage. Is endemic in India, but cultivated throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of both worlds, in India, Spain, Portugal, Meridional Italy, Sicily, Greece, Creta and Cyprus, Egypt and tropical America. It is described under various names\u2014Arum colocasia, A. esculentus, Alocasia illustris, Colocasia Acres, O. Tontanesti. The common variety found in India is the one described by Roxburgh under the name of Arum nuphafolium. He says: \"I doubt if this can be reckoned anything more than a large aquatic variety of colocasia. In Bengal it is rarely cultivated, but found wild in abundance on the borders of the lakes and pools of fresh water. Every part of this plant is eaten by the Hindus. The root or rather the subterraneous stem often grows to the length and thickness of a man's arm. The petioles, scapes and leaves are of a reddish colour, and the plants considerably larger than any of the varieties of colocasia just mentioned, yet the leaves are narrow in proportion to their breadth. The only good specific mark to know it from colocasia by, is the shortness of the club of the spadix. Every part of this plant, variously prepared, is eaten.\"\n\nAmorphophallus campanulatus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 259. Suran.\n\nRoot tuberous, spheroid, as large as a cocoanut, covered with dark-brown skin externally. Leaves radical, few; lamina 3-fid, lateral divisions dichotomous, the central and the secondary lateral ones pinnatifid; segments obliquely-oblong, acuminate, unequal; petiole round, smooth or verrucose, light green with dark-green spots. Spathe large, leathery, convolute, infundibuliform at the base, membranaceous and patulous at the upper portion, purplish towards the curved and undulating margin. Spadix about as long as the spathe; female portion cylindric, male ob-conic, a little shorter than the female; appendage dark-purple, conical or sub-conical, lobate, rugose, sinuose. Flowers appear long after the leaves.\n\nWild on the banks of the streams in the Konkan and various other parts of India, Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Moluccas, Timor, New Guinea, Tahiti. Cultivated throughout India for the sake of its tuber, which affords good wholesome food to millions of this country. It contains an acrid principle which is removed by steeping the sliced tuber for a sufficient length of time in water.\n\nPinellia tuberifera, Schot. Prod. A. 20.\n\nUnder the name of ziravandmudhiraj there are sold in all the bazars in India small tubers of various sizes, from a pea to a betel-\nnut, round or depresso-globose, light reddish colour. These arise from the inferior third of the petiole of the above plant which is indigenous in China and Japan. They are starchy, and possess nutritive properties. They are sold here in India as the produce of *Aristolochia rotunda* with which they have nothing to do.\n\n**Typhonium bulbiferum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 258.\n\nGrowing in the Konkan and Malab\u00e1r, and *Amorphophallus bulbiferous*, described by Roxburgh under the name of *Arun bulbifera*, indigenous to Bengal also yield bulbs, but they are not stated to be edible.\n\n**THYPHIN\u00c6.**\n\n**Typha elephantina**, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 366. *Elephant grass, ramban,* or *r\u00e1mbana* (the arrows of R\u00e1m).\n\nA large, reed-like, marsh and aquatic plant. Stem smooth, round, 6-12 ft. high. Leaves linear, ensiform, smooth, 4-6 ft. long, \u00be in. broad, parallel veined, sheathing at the base. Flowers unisexual, very closely packed in separate spikes; the upper spike terminal, cylindric, about a foot long and 1 in. in circumference, 2-3 in. above the female spike; anthers yellow with green top, which gives to the spike a greenish appearance; filaments filiform surrounded by very thin hair. Female spike about as long and thick as the male. Each ovary is surrounded by a calyx consisting of fine capillary hairs. Fruit oblong, one-seeded.\n\nGrows on the margins of tanks and slow-running rivers in the Konkan and Deccan. It is said that *buri-bread* is made in Sind from the pollen of this plant. Elephants are very fond of the leaves; they are also used for thatch by the poor people.\n\nIt is called *pau\u00f1a-grass* in Sind, and is of great importance for binding the soil on the banks of the Indus with its long tortuous roots of which great care is taken when the culms are cut down to make matting of. They are tied in bundles and used like sedges (*Spargium ramosum*) in England as buoys to swim with.\u2014Grah. Cat. Bby. Fl.\n\n**ALISMACE\u00c6.**\n\n**Aponogeton monostachyum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby.

Leaves radical, mostly submerged, long-petioled, linear, oblong, or lanceolate, acuminate or obtuse at the apex, cordate or round at the base, entire, smooth, 3-7-nerved, 3-6 in. long, \u00bd-\u00be in. broad; scape as long as the leaves. Flowers hexandrous in densely packed terminal spikes. Perianth segments of 2 obovate, concave, membranous divisions. Fruit ovoid, smooth, tapering into a short, recurved point, 1-celled, 2-8 seeded.\n\nIn the tanks of the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Belgaum districts and throughout India.

Umbil supra decompound, many-flowered, erect, leaflets of the involucre from a few inches to 1-2 ft. long. Spikes brown-coloured. Fruit oblong, bristles 5, oblong.\n\nCommon in S\u00e1lsette and Th\u00e1na and throughout India, on the margins of tanks and rivers. The tuber is sold in Bombay, and is eaten by all classes here, in S\u00e1lsette, Ahmadabad, etc. It is sweet and starchy.\n\nGRAMINE\u00c6.\n\nPaspalum scrobiculatum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 97. Kodra, kodri, harick.\n\nRoot fibrous, culm tufted, 2-3 ft. high; nodes 3-4, glabrous, brown. Leaves bifarious, smooth. Sheaths terete, nearly as long or longer than the internodes. Spikes usually 2-4 alternate, 1-4 in. long. Rachis flat-keeled. Spikelets shortly-pedicellate, or sessile, imbricate, glabrous in 2 rows, ovoid, orbicular, flat.\n\nWild and cultivated in the tropical regions of the Old World. In India it is chiefly sown in the mountains, dry barren regions, and the grain forms the food of the poor people. It is said to be as palatable as rice, but occasionally it induces symptoms of intoxication like those caused by the seeds of datura. For further information see remarks at the beginning of this chapter.\n\nPanicum miliaceum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 98. Small-millet, wadi, sawa, chenah, sama, varika, umu.\n\nCulm erect, much tufted, very hairy, 2-4 ft. high. Leaves broad, very hairy, sheathless. Panicles nodding, much divided. Spikelets numerous, very small, ovoid, pedicellate. Fruiting glume (palca) smooth and shining, the outer glume acute, 3-nerved, the next two glumes broad, 7-11-nerved, acute. This is the common millet cultivated throughout India over the gh\u00e1ts and the Mediterranean coast.\n\nPanicum (Setaria) Italicum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 98. Kangu, kdingni, rala, rawla, bertia, kakun, keranj, kerakang, chena, kora (Dec., Hind. and Beng.)\n\nCulm tufted, erect, smooth, round, 3-5 ft. high. Leaves very broad, hispid, sheaths hairy at the mouth. Panicle much branched, cylindrical, stout, at length nodding at the summit; branches usually contiguous, oblong. Fertile floret minutely dotted at length smooth. Bristles at the insertion of the spikelet 1-3 roughened upwards, usually much exceeding it.\n\nCultivated throughout the hilly parts of India and other tropical regions. This is the Italian millet of the Europeans.\n\nP. frumentaceum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 98. Shamula, kathi, kangra, sawa, sanwa, saon, shama (Dec., Hind. and Beng.)\nCalm erect, 2-4 ft. high, flattish, smooth. Leaves large with hispid margins. Panicle erect, oblong, nodding; spikes numerous, second, incurved, occasionally verticelled. Rachis angular, sparingly hairy. Flowers almost always 3 from the same point, unequally pedicelled. Glumes 3-nerved, the two large empty glumes with shorter awn than the lowest glume; the flowering glume awnless. Fruit ovoid, pointed.\n\nWild and cultivated through India in and near the gh\u00e1ts and also in Africa. The grain is said to be wholesome and nutritious and is used chiefly by poor people inhabiting the hills. Cattle is said to be very fond of it.\n\n**P. pilosum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 98. *Arzan*, *bhadli*.\n\nErect or ascending, pilose, bearded at the nodes and mouth of the sheaths. Leaves lanceolate or linear acuminate, round at the base. Panicle spreading; rachis pilose with scattered hairs; branches numerous. Spikelet ovate, glabrous. Empty glumes 3-5-nerved. Fertile flowers ovate, pointed, smooth. This small plant is also cultivated over the gh\u00e1ts.\n\nThere are other grains sold in the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs of India named *mellashama*, *nella-shamalu*, *barti*, *dantig*, *roli*, *shallu*, *sundia*, *kunki*, the botanical sources of which are not ascertained. They are supposed to be varieties of the millets already described.\n\nMillet grain is largely used in India, China, Africa and in some parts of Europe. It is said to be very nutritious. Parkes says that \"millet bread is very good, and some was issued to the troops in the last China expedition. This should always be done in a millet country if wheat or barley cannot be obtained. In Northern China millet is almost exclusively used.\"\n\nThese observations are equally applicable to *bajri*, *jow\u00e1ri* and *n\u00e1chni*, which are also included by European authors under the name of millet.\n\n**Penicillaria spicata**, Wild. described in Dalz. & Gibs, Bby. Fl. Suppl. 98 under the name of *Holcus spicatus*. *Bajri*, *bajera*, *bajra*, *sazgaran*.\n\nThis is extensively cultivated in Kh\u00e1ndesh, Gujar\u00e1t, Deccan and throughout India and Africa. It does not grow in the Konkan and other low lands, but the grain is largely imported there and used by the poor people instead of rice, which costs them more.\n\n**Saccharum officinarum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bhy. Fl. Suppl. 99.\n\nThis useful plant is cultivated throughout the tropics of both hemispheres. The varieties introduced in Bombay are numerous; the chief are\u2014\n\n1. The large yellow or Mauritius cane.\n2. The common red.\n3. The Bamani or striped red and white.\n4. The small white or reed cane.\n5. The black Egyptian variety. This is quite equal to the Mauritius variety, but has disappeared.\nFood Plants.\n\nThe Mauritius cane was introduced into this country by Government, but it is found that it requires more water, and is more liable to be eaten by jackals and porcupines than the red Indian variety.\n\nThe plant is cultivated throughout the tropics, China, etc. Nowhere found wild.\n\n*Sorghum vulgare*, Pers., described in Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. as *Holcus sorghum*. *Jowari*, *joar*, *jondla*, *kangra*, *jaundri* (*karbi* dry culm and leaves).\n\nThis grain is extensively cultivated in the Karnatic, Bevaris, and throughout the hilly parts of India for the sake of its grain, which forms the staple food of millions of this country, and for the sake of the fodder (in its fresh and dried state called *karbi*) which is given to cattle of all kinds. For the latter purpose it is often so cultivated as to cause more the development of the culms and leaves.\n\n*Sorghum saccharatum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 99. *Shalu*, *devdhan*.\n\nCultivated throughout India in the rainy and cold seasons.\n\n*Oryza sativa*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 98. *Chaul*, *bhat*, *tandul*.\n\nThis is the common rice plant cultivated in both hemispheres. It is stated that about fifty varieties are cultivated in India; the large grain is preferred by most of the working people, who find it more substantial. It is not known, however, whether this variety contains more of the nitrogenous principles, nutritive fat and salts. Parkes says:\n\n\"The whole grain (paddy) deprived of the husk is sold as rice. There are many varieties of different colours (white, red, brown?) and composition. The amount of nitrogenous matter varies greatly from 3 to 75 per cent. of the moist grain. As an article of diet it has the advantage of an extremely digestible starch grain, and like the other cereals there is a great admixture of substances; it is, however, poorer in nitrogenous substances than wheat, and is much poorer in fat: consequently among rice-feeding nations leguminous seeds are taken to supply the first, and animal and vegetable fats to remedy the latter defect. Rice is also poor in salts.\"\n\nRice with or without the husk is called on this side of India *chaul* and *tandul*. Boiled rice is the *bhut* of some, and *dhan* and *sit* of others. In its wild state rice is known in some places [as *nivari* and *wri*; A rice field is generally sown twice in the year, the most fertile soil for this cultivation being land periodically inundated by rivers, *n\u00e1las*, etc., which carry with them much fertilizing matter. At first rice is sown thick, and then transplanted in between five to six weeks, the whole time from the planting to the reaping being from 2 to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ months.\n\n*Zea Mays*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 100.\n\nThis is the common *Indian corn* known to people in this country as *bhuta*, *mak\u00e1*. It is indigenous to America, and now cultivated extensively in India and throughout the tropics. In Bombay it is grown at the beginning of the rains for the sake of the grain which is roasted and eaten, and in the hot season (beginning of March) to\nafford fodder (called khadol) for cattle; for the latter purpose it is sown very close so as to cause the development of the leaves.\n\nThis Indian corn is very nutritious; it contains a large quantity of fat (6 to 7 per cent.). The gluten cannot be washed out as in wheat. It should be well cooked before being eaten, otherwise it is liable to cause diarrhoea. The bread is said to be palatable and nutritious.\n\n**Eleusine coracana**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 97. *N\u00e1chni, nagli, ragi, mand, marna, marha, kangra.*\n\nThis is extensively cultivated on the gh\u00e1ts and in the plains to about 20 miles inland and also in Egypt and South America. It is transplanted like rice and is a very productive crop.\n\nThe flour is baked into bread, and boiled and drunk as gruel either alone or with chillies. Said to be very nutritious, even more so than wheat. The grain is indestructible, and can be preserved for more than fifty years in dry grain pits.\n\n\"This is the most prolific of the cultivated grasses, forming the chief diet of the poorer classes in some parts of India as Mysore, Northern Circars and slopes of the gh\u00e1ts. Roxburgh says \"he never saw it in a wild state.\" \"A fermented liquor is prepared from the seeds, called bojak in the Mar\u00e1tha Country.\"\n\n**Avena sativa**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 97. *The common oat.*\n\nThis is pretty extensively grown in many parts, principally in Northern India; also near some of the more southern European stations like Poona. It is much used for feeding horses, but is apt to give rise to chronic cough and huskiness, as it contains much more of the paleaceous element than the European oat. Hence the preference shown by many to gram. Parkes says:\n\n\"Oats have been considered even more nutritious than wheat or barley, and certainly not only is the amount of nitrogenous substance great, but the proportion of fat is large. Unfortunately the nitrogenous substance has no adhesive property, and bread cannot be made; the amount of indigestible cellulose is large. But on the other hand, oatmeal has the great advantage of being very readily cooked, much more so than wheat or barley.\n\n\"The late researches of Krensler show that the nitrogenous substances of oats contain gliadin, and especially gluten-casein. This last substance is called \"avenin\" by Norton and Johnstone; it approaches very closely the legumin of peas and beans, and is so called by Retthansen. In nutritive principles it causes oatmeal to stand nearer to the Leguminoae than the other cereals do. It contains double as much sulphur as the legumin of peas.\"\n\nFor this reason and because it contains much nutriment in a small bulk, can be eaten for long periods with relish, and keeps unchanged for a long time, it would seem to be an excellent food for soldiers during war,\u2014an opinion which does not lose in force when we remember that it formed the staple food of one of the most martial races on record, the Scotch Highlanders, whom Jackson considered also one of the most enduring races. Formerly when oats were badly cleaned, intestinal concretions of the husk and hairs were common among those who lived on oatmeal, but these are now uncommon. It has been thought to be \"heating\" when taken continually, but this is probably a prejudice.\n\n**Bambusa arundinacea**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 299. *Vansa* (Sans.), *manga, mans, bans, tokar.*\nFood Plants.\n\nThis is the tallest bambu, attaining a height of 30-50 ft. and a diameter of 4-8 in. Culm green, shining and spinescent. Grows in Poona, Malab\u00e1r, etc.\n\n**B. vulgaris**, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 299. *Kalaka* or *bambu*.\n\nCulm unarmed, 20-50 ft. high, green or greenish-yellow. Cultivated in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and various parts of India.\n\n**Dendrocalamus strictus**, Brand. For. Fl. 569.\u2014*Bambusa stricta*, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 299. *Bans, bas, bassa, vassa*.\n\nCulm armed or unarmed, straight, strong and elastic, with a small cavity or none; attains 20-40 ft. in height. Common throughout India.\n\n**Arundinaria Wightiana**, Brand. For. Fl. 562.\u2014*Bambusa arundo*, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 299. *Chevari*.\n\nIt is a small thorny bambu 6 to 12 ft. high; grows at higher gh\u00e1ts. Walking sticks are made out of this for sale at Mah\u00e1baleshvar.\n\nBambus flower once in about 30 to 32 years, and when such an occurrence takes place the whole tract extending over many miles is in full flower; it sometimes happens, however, that only a few bambus of a cluster flower each year, when the flowering goes on every succeeding year with the other bambus of the cluster. The variety *Arundinaria Wightiana*, however, flowers and dies down annually, when new shoots spring up from the roots and attain their full size in a single season. Both in this variety and in others, the flowering is followed by the death of the stems, so that after seasons of general flowering a whole district presents for some time the spectacle of a large forest of dried up clumps. The product of the flowering of the bambu is a rice which is consumed by the poorer people in lieu of common rice. A very palatable bread is said to be made of the flour of this rice, although the colour of it is somewhat dark.\n\nIn the scarcity of 1812 in Orissa, of 1864 in K\u00e1nara, and of 1866 in Malda this rice formed the principal article of the food of the poor population: hence perhaps the belief, entertained by some Government officials, that the bambu only flowers in seasons of general scarcity.\n\nFrom the young tender bambu shoots pickle and preserves are made which are considered very palatable by the natives. The sliced shoots are also made into dishes.\n\nThere are other uses to which the bambu is put. Of the *Bambusa arundinacea*, which attains a height of from 60 to 80 ft. and a diameter of 6 to 8 in. and is by far the most important of the several varieties, many uses are made. It supplies poles for carrying purposes, tents, scaffolding, timber rafts, &c., and is used, besides, in the manufacture of furniture and for ladders, fencing, mats, baskets, fishing rods, window and door blinds and for many other useful purposes. The next in importance is the *Dendrocalamus strictus*, which grows from 20 to 40 ft. All this growth is attained in a single season. This bambu is solid and elastic, and is much\nused for roofing purposes and making shafts for spears, besides several of the purposes mentioned previously. Mr. Lethbridge says that all the varieties of bambus are capable of being employed in the manufacture of paper.\n\n*Triticum aestivum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 97. *Gium, ghawn, mar-ghum, ghawut-ghum.*\n\nThis is the common wheat cultivated throughout India. It does not grow below the gh\u00e2ts, as neither the soil nor climate suit it. There are several varieties known in the Presidency, such as *kaple, bakst*, etc. Both these are sown in irrigated lands; that which is raised in higher gh\u00e2ts is said to be proportionally heavier than that raised in the plains. The Indian wheat produced in Northern India is of late largely exported to Europe, where it fetches very good prices.\n\nThis grain is an article of diet, and is consumed all over the world; it is rich in nutritive principles and easily digestible. The nitrogenous substances are in large and varied proportions, consisting of soluble albumen (1 to 2 per cent.) and gluten (8 to 12 per cent.). The starchy substances, including sugar, are also in large proportions\u201460 to 70 per cent., and are easily digested. Wheat, however, is deficient in nutritive fat and salts.\n\n*Hordeum hexastychon*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 96. *Jow, satu, jab.*\n\nThis is the common barley cultivated throughout India in the cold season; alluvial soil suits it best. On this side of India it is much cultivated and consumed in the north of Gujar\u00e2t and in the Deccan. In the latter place it is said to be also grown as an offering to the gods.\n\nIt is very nutritious and like wheat contains a large proportion of nitrogen and other nutritive principles, and the Greeks trained their athletes on it. Dr. Pereira says that it is rather laxative, and hence not suited to such as suffer from relaxation of the bowels. For gruel country raised barley is superior to \"pearl\" and other kinds imported from Europe, because it is fresh.\n\n\"According to Bretschneider barley is included among the five cereals which, it is related in Chinese history, were sowed by the Emperor Shen-nung, who reigned about 2700 B.C.; but it is not one of the five sorts of grain which are used at the ceremony of ploughing and sowing as now annually performed by the emperors of China.\"\nFAMINE PLANTS.\n\nWILD HERBS, TUBERS, etc., USED AS FOOD DURING SEASONS OF SCARCITY.*\n\nNotwithstanding the efforts made by Government to inquire into and study the various plants used as food by the natives of India during seasons of drought, it is curious to find so many errors in the various reports that have been published on this subject\u2014plants and vegetables that are eaten all the year round in ordinary times being sometimes included in the list of famine foods. The officers who were employed on relief works during the last famine in some districts of the Bombay and Madras Presidencies, having for the first time seen natives using certain wild herbs naturally enough concluded that these were resorted to for want of ordinary food, or, in other words, that they were famine plants. It is a difficult task for a single man, howsoever long he may have resided in this country, to obtain an accurate list of all the food-grains and vegetables eaten by the natives of India during ordinary seasons and those of scarcity. Hence the most intelligent of these officers do not appear to have steered clear of such mistakes, and I particularly remember a certain gentleman who once belonged to the covenanted service of this Presidency and whose goodness of heart led him to constantly mix himself up with and inquire into the wants, habits and customs of the poor natives in the districts he happened to be located, asking me the question \"Do the natives eat tackla (Cassia tora)? it has such a disagreeable smell.\" Now the natives use this plant not only during famines, but almost all the year round, specially at the commencement of the rainy season; they also partake of it made into \"shak baji\" on every Monday of the month Shravan. The question was, therefore, one that much surprised me, the more so that the gentleman referred to, besides his particular interest in the natives, was himself a botanist. I have compiled a list of fruits and vegetables used by the people of this country which contains names that, I am sure, have never been heard by many Europeans and I will make bold to say by even a large majority of the natives, especially those who live in large towns. It is a fact, however, that even well-to-do natives eat some of the wild herbs found in or about their villages, either as a change, or as an addition to their meals, or when a supply of good cultivated vegetables is not procurable; nay many of them make a point to use, at least once a year, made into shak baji, herbs and tubers usually eaten by the humbler classes, whether cultivated or uncultivated,\n\n* This paper was read at one of the meetings of the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society.\nwhich appear successively in each season of the year, under the belief that such a proceeding assists in warding off the various causes of disease.\n\nIt is to be regretted that we have no chemical analysis of the various food-grains and vegetables eaten by the natives, nor is there any reliable information as to the knowledge which guides them in the selection of one species and the rejection of others, though all belonging to the same genus and order. This knowledge is perhaps the result of the accumulated experience of bygone generations. Afflicted by periodical droughts, subjected to persecutions by native princes whose armies plundered their fields during the intestine wars which were in past times very frequent, the people were driven from home to distant secluded places and hills for shelter and refuge. Here they must have learnt, from want of their ordinary food, to use various herbs, and must also have acquired the knowledge of the fact that the seedlings and tender stalks of almost every plant are wholesome; nay that even poisonous roots and tubers, if properly boiled, may be eaten with impunity.\n\nAlmost all the species of plants belonging to the order Aroidae are more or less poisonous: some, like Lagenandra toxicana\u2014Vatsumb of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, etc., are deadly poisonous. They contain an acrid principle which is said to be destroyed by the application of heat, or by the mere drying of the aroids. During the late famine in Madras and the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country thousands of people were seen to live upon tuberous roots and leaves of some aroids known to be poisonous. It is believed that the boiling or stewing process these herbs were subjected to prior to being eaten, destroyed their deleterious principle, and thus the tubers, etc., became innocuous, or rather wholesome food. With the exception of these the plants in the list below contain neither acrid nor poisonous principles; nay many of them are, I believe, used at all times of the year, though in small quantity, mixed with other food; but are they all equally nutritious? Cultivated pulses are known to be very nutritious, some of them coming up, in the quantity of nutrient principles they possess, to the best cereals. In the late famine people were seen at Kal\u00e1dgi, Shol\u00e1pur, Ahmednagar and elsewhere to use the seeds of Abutilon muticum, Indigofera linifolia, I. cordifolia, I. glandulosa, Alysicarpus rugosus, etc., which were ground and made into cakes or conjee either alone or mixed with the flour of b\u00e1jri. The analysis of Surgeon-Major Lyon has shown that all these seeds contain a large quantity of nitrogenous and carbonaceous principles,\u2014some quite as much as the best of cultivated pulses,\u2014in fact, it would appear that cultivation increases the cellulose of certain pulses at the expense of their nitrogen. But it does not follow from this that the wild grains above mentioned are easy of digestion, for it was a common complaint that the people who had lived on them alone had become lean, and weak, and suffered from bowel disorders, due perhaps to the fact that large quantities had to be eaten to satisfy the wants of the system, which could not be digested. And if these were the results of eating such pulses as were just referred to, it is not difficult to imagine what results would follow upon the prolonged use of such gritty grain as that of Tribulus terrestris, Cyanotis axillaris, and others which, although containing a fair proportion of nitrogenous principles, cannot be easily assimilated.\nFamine Plants.\n\nIn order that a substance, vegetable or animal, may be wholesome or useful as an article of food, it is necessary that it should contain principles, nitrogenous and carbonaceous, in due proportion, and in such a state of combination that they may be easily separated, disintegrated and digested in the stomach. It is a fact that many of the plants in the list given below contain less of nutritive principles and more of woody tissue, gummy and resinous substances and various extractive matters which are neither digestible nor nourishing; they may be palatable to the taste and temporarily appease the craving of hunger, but their exclusive use for a lengthened period brings on decay and emaciation, and renders the constitution an easy prey to disease. This assertion is not based on theory alone. Numerous facts observed during the famines in Orissa, Behar, Madras and Southern Maratha Country prove that the protracted use of such herbs alone, even of tackla, muchur, etc., which are used in ordinary seasons in small quantities along with other food, was followed by emaciation and other symptoms of slow starvation such as anaemia, scurvy, etc., often proving fatal by inducing diarrhoea, dysentery, dropsy of the whole body, or of the abdomen alone.\n\nMan whether asleep or awake, whether in a state of rest or actively engaged in the multifarious duties of life, is perpetually undergoing an imperceptibly slow process of disintegration. To put it clearer, every action in his life, from the involuntary one of breathing to that which demands the largest amount of physical or mental energy, causes the waste of a certain amount of muscular and nervous substance in the shape of nitrogen and carbon which exist in the various organs and tissues of the body and the loss of which has to be made up by food. It has been calculated by eminent authorities that a healthy adult excretes as much as 140 to 180 grains of nitrogen a day when at rest, the proportion of carbon excreted being placed by some at 4 and by others at as much as 7 times the quantity of nitrogen. In ordinary labour about 300 grains of nitrogen are excreted, the quantity lost under great physical exertion of many consecutive hours reaching as much as 5 to 600 grains. It is upon a knowledge of these facts that the dietaries of jails, hospitals, barracks and like establishments are based; for it is clear that, unless the quantity of food taken in contains enough of nitrogen and carbon to make up for the waste the body has undergone, the latter must prey upon itself so long as there is anything left to prey upon, and then die. This is exactly what happens when the food taken into the body is deficient either in quantity or in the elements that compose it. The diets of our jails are calculated to provide 200 to 300 grains of nitrogen daily, and care is taken to supplement these when necessary by meat, vegetables, &c., to prevent the body falling into a low condition incompatible with the exertion it has to undergo. The staple-food of the natives in India is rice, which contains between 70 to 80 grains of nitrogen per pound. An ordinary labourer would, therefore, require about 3 pounds per day of rice to keep his body at its working standard. Any great deduction from this quantity might perhaps suffice to maintain a state of feeble vitality for a certain length of time, but it admits of no doubt that before long the system begins to suffer the effects of starvation. This was well exemplified by the effects of what is now\nhistorically known as the one-pound ration of Sir Richard Temple during the famine of 1876-78. Such as were strong enough to resist the immediate effects of hunger for some time, even when afterwards well fed and taken care of, were found to be suffering from diarrhoea, dropsy, &c., from which nothing subsequently cured them, the tissues engaged in the process of assimilating food having from lack of sufficient nourishment undergone a degenerative process which unfitted them for their work.\n\nThere is another way in which the wild herbs and tubers mentioned below are said to affect injuriously those who eat them. In the presidential address delivered before the Grant College Medical Society in 1878, in speaking of the causes of leprosy, I said the following:\u2014\"Some attribute it to deficiency of salt in the food of the poor people of this country, and to the use of dall. The proportion of common salt existing in the blood is very great, and absolutely necessary for the due performance of various vital processes. The experiments made by Boussingault show that the addition of salt to the fodder of animals has no influence in the quantity of flesh, fat, or milk obtained from them, but it appears to have a favourable effect on the appearance and quality of the stock. After detailing his experiments he says:\u2014'The hair in the oxen which had got salt was smooth and shining; that of the other which had no salt added to their fodder, was matted, and the skin here and there devoid of hairs. Those of the first lot, on the contrary, retained the look of stall-fed beasts; their liveliness and frequent indication of a desire to leap contrasted strikingly against the heavy and cold temperament observed in those of the second lot. There is no doubt'\u2014continues Boussingault\u2014'that a higher price would have been obtained in the market for the oxen reared under the influence of salt.' Baron von Leibig (from whose Letters on Chemistry the above extract is taken,) after remarking how the constitution is lowered by deficiency of salt in food and thus becomes liable to be easily attacked by various morbid agents, says: 'Many agriculturists have, however, drawn very different conclusions from these experiments (Boussingault's). As addition of salt yields to them (the farmers) no profit, since by the outlay in salt nothing is gained in flesh, they conclude that salt is of no use whatever; nay these experiments have actually been abused as proofs and arguments against the reduction of the impost on salt,\u2014of all taxes on the Continent that which is the most odious, the most unnatural, and the most disgraceful to human nature. We may here see that more wisdom is displayed in the instinct of an ox, or a sheep, than in the arrangement of him, who, strange to tell, often regards himself as the image of Him who is the perfection of all kindness and of all reason.' You all know that the high tax on salt imposed by the Indian Government falls chiefly and heavily on the poor population. The Government is desirous of abolishing or reducing it, and we must hope that the time of its remission will soon arrive. The poor population of India generally uses as articles of food various wild and uncultivated herbs mixed with cultivated grain and pulses; but during scarcity and famine it lives entirely on the former. In this kind of food some find the cause of leprosy. I have examined all the wild vegetables said by the Government officers to be used by the poor natives, and have\nfound that the greater number of them must be of easy digestion and all innocuous; but it remains to be ascertained if the prolonged use of these substances can exercise any influence in engendering some morbid state of constitution; and if in times of scarcity good legumes are mixed with diseased grain, etc. It is a fact that all pot herbs, grains, pulses and tubers contain less salt: for example, potatoes and spinach cannot be eaten without salt; perhaps uncultivated leguminous vegetables, which by themselves are innocuous when eaten for a long period without being seasoned with a proper quantity of salt, may lead to deterioration of the nutrient fluid of the human body, ending ultimately in the production of the disease. Dall, good or diseased, may be noxious for the same reasons. This opinion does not appear, however, to have been based upon well-observed facts.\n\nThe following list, collected some four years ago is now with a few additions and corrections, brought before the Society, in the hope that it may not be deemed to be wholly uninteresting and that it may be useful in inducing such of the members as have opportunities of adding to it; for besides the plants below mentioned, there are many others which famine-stricken people make use of,\u2014in fact, it would appear that they devour whatever more or less tender vegetable substances they come across, provided they are not either very acrid or bitter.\"\n\n**POLYGAL\u00c6.**\n\n*Polygala chinensis*, Hooker Fl. of Brit.

They are said to have afforded food to many thousand people dur-\nFamine Plants.\n\ning the late famine in Madras. The Indian Agriculturist\u2014Edit. Notes, 1877\u2014says thus regarding this plant:\n\n\"This plant belongs to the same genus as the South American which yields the substance called coca. This coca is used as a masticatory by the native races on the Western Coast of South America, and produces a stimulating effect on their nervous system, banishing care, allaying the pangs of hunger, and enabling those under its influence, to endure great fatigue without any other sustenance. The Indian plant is nearly allied to the coca, and possesses some of the specific properties of that plant. It would appear very strange that the famine-stricken natives of India, like their brethren of the new world, should have resorted to this particular plant when there is nothing either in the appearance, taste, or texture of the leaves of the Indian plant likely to induce hungry men and women to eat them in preference to the leaves of any other plant common in the district. Experience has, no doubt, taught them that they have the power of mitigating the pangs of hunger and acting as a stimulant.\"\n\nThe virtue of the leaves is due to the presence of an alkaloid cocaina which in small doses is strongly stimulating, and produces a feeling of intoxication; in fact, it resembles in its action opium administered in small doses. Dr. Lindley in his Flora Medica, page 200, says that the leaves are \"a powerful stimulant of the nervous system, affecting it in a manner analogous to opium. Less violent in its effects than that drug, but more permanent in its action. The Peruvians chew the leaves with finely powdered chalk, and the Government of Potosi alone derived a revenue of as much as 500,000 pesos duros in the year 1583 from their consumption.\"\n\nThe revenue has since increased to a considerable extent. We have no information whether the leaves of the Indian species contain the alkaloid in sufficient proportions to produce similar effects. Observations are wanting in this respect. Probably cocaina, if really present, must exist in very small quantity, for people use the leaves and tender stalks as green and not as a masticatory.*\n\nTribulus terrestris, Dalz. & Gibs Bby. Fl. 45. Gokhr\u00fb.\n\nIt is a small humifuse plant, branches 1-2 ft. long. Flowers yellow. Fruit angular, prickly. Common in K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r, Gujar\u00e2t and the Deccan and all over India in hot dry places. The herb is eaten as pot herb.

The identification is, however, doubtful; for the flowers of *Glossocardia* are yellow, and not rose-coloured, as stated in the printed list of the Bombay Secretariat. The specimens sent from Kal\u00e1dgi with the above native names belong probably to *Cyathoclyne stricta*, the flowers of which are purple, and the leaves deeply cut.\n\n**Sapotaceae.**\n\n*Bassia latifolia*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 139; Roxb. Cor. Pl. t. 19.\n\nBoth the ripe and the unripe fruit are eaten by the natives, but perhaps the most important product of this plant is the flower, of which 200 to 400 lbs. are sometimes collected from a single tree. These flowers are always gathered early in the morning, dried in the sun, and then sold as an article of food, being consumed either raw or cooked along with parched grain. Many of those who have gone to M\u00e1ther\u00e1n must have seen the natives at the foot of this hill collecting the flowers of the *mowah* which are much esteemed by them; and, indeed, during the famine of 1873-74 at Beh\u00e1r they are said to have kept thousands of people from starvation. They have a sweetish smell and taste.\n\nThe seeds of the *mowah* yield by expression a greenish-yellow oil which is used by unscrupulous dealers for adulterating ghee. It is also used in making soap in Kaira. The oil-cake is employed for poisoning fish and to kill rats, and when burnt its smoke is reported to be a good insecticide. *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\n*Bassia longifolia*, Roxb. Fl.

Bby. Fl. Suppl. 93. Jungly annanas.\n\nCultivated in many parts of India. Dr. Cornish in his report on the famine relief measures in North Arcot mentions the use of the flowering stalks of the American aloe as food by the distressed population, and writes as follows:\n\n\"The American aloe is common in waste dry soils, and is used also for fencing. The flowering stalk of the aloe contains a sweet fibrous substance something like the pith of the sago palm, and for miles around Palmanair every flower stalk of the aloe has been cut down for food. The people boil it with tamarind, and it is by no means disagreeable to the taste. The nutritious matter is sugar and starch, but the great bulk of the pith is woody fibre. The interior of the lower part of the leaf stalk of the aloe is used in the same way, and the dried aloe leaf is given to the cattle. The green part of the aloe leaf contains a bitter purgative juice; but when dried in the sun, cattle will eat a little of the lower and thicker end of the leaf. I fear it cannot be a very nourishing diet for them. The prickly pear is fruiting very abundantly this year, and the children especially are eating the fruit to a great extent. The ripe fruit is sweet and juicy, and probably not unwholesome, except where it is used in undue proportion to other kinds of food.\"\n\nAnd the \"Englishman\" had some time ago a letter from one of its correspondents containing an extract from a \"Report on the Food Products of the North American Indians\" in which the following was stated about the American aloe. This plant, called mescal by the Americans, \"grows upon the most barren mountains, and is taken for food when old enough at any season of the year. It is in its prime, however, when about putting forth its flowering stem. To prepare it for use, the leaves are cut off at the base or crown, leaving a hard, white, bulbous mass, measuring one or two feet in circumference, having a flavour like chestnuts, but somewhat peppery. It cannot be eaten in its fresh state, but must be cooked. For this purpose the Indians dig a hole or pit, ten or twelve feet in diameter and three feet deep, lined with stones, upon which a fire is made, and the stones thoroughly heated. The fire being removed, a layer of damp grass is placed upon the rocks; then the bulbs, which are covered with the tender inside leaves taken from the crowns; a layer of grass is placed over these, and over all a thick coating of earth. After three days the contents of the pit are found to be thoroughly baked and converted into a sweet, juicy article of food; a favourite for use in camp; of a brown colour and resembling pears in taste. It is used as an article of commerce * * * * and is not only pleasant to the taste, but acts as an antiscorbutic * * Cut up into slices it is easily dried, and retains its sweetness for years. * * * * The leaf when washed and dried is employed by the Indians for smoking like tobacco, but being sweet and gummy, it chokes up the pipe. * * * * The crowns are sometimes baked in hot ashes, but are not so good as when baked in the pit. It is a common practice to collect the leaves into suitable bundles and press them flat. They soon dry, and are very sweet, but inferior to the crown. * * The leaf has a dirty black, stringy look, but is the favourite food of the Apaches when they are at war or on the hunt * * * * A fine mescal spirit is prepared from the roasted leaves of Agave Americana * * * * It is a strong, fiery drink, but not half so injurious as modern whiskey * * * * The wasted pulp when cut up, mixed with water, and boiled form a fine syrup, and when dissolved in cold water forms a pleasant drink and an excellent sauce to the usually very dry and insipid articles of Indian food. Although the roasted root is very dark, the distilled\nspirit is of a clear yellow colour. It cannot be adulterated with water without immediately rendering it ropy and distasteful, the water precipitating some mucilaginous matter or resin contained in it.\n\n**LILIACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Aloe Indica*, Royl. Ill. 390.\u2014*A. perfoliata*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 167. *Kumar.*\n\nGrowing in sandy places in the N.-W. Provinces, and cultivated in gardens of Bombay.\n\n*Aloe litoralis*, Pharmacop. Ind. 24. *Ohta-kunwar, kumar-bij.*\n\nOn the sea-coast of the Madras Presidency. The leaf bud or cabbage and tender pith of both these species are much resorted to during famines; but they are unwholesome, and cause dysentery and diarrhoea.\n\n**COMMELYNACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Commelyna communis*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 555. *Kena.*\n\nAn annual with much-branched procumbent stems; deep blue flowers on two peduncles on each circulate spathe. Common in Bombay and throughout the tropics.

Fl. 256. *Itsaka.*\n\nA creeping annual with 2 or 3 deep blue flowers, nearly sessile within the sheaths, filaments thickened above a dense tuft of hairs, and capsule 3-valved, 3-seeded. Common throughout India, Ceylon and Archipelago. It is stated that the seeds of both these spiderworts were eagerly sought during the famine, and it appears both from experience and from the chemical analysis that they are wholesome and nutritious.\n\n**PALM\u00c6.**\n\n*Phoenix sylvestris*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 278. *Kajuri.*\n\nLeaf bud or cabbage and ripe yellow fruit are eaten. The tree is common in Gujar\u00e1t, Konkan, Bengal and Madras, and is highly esteemed on account of its juice, called *toddy*, which is extracted by removing the lower leaves with their sheaths and cutting a notch into the pith of the tree near the top. The juice issuing from this notch is conducted by a small palm-leaf channel into an earthen vessel placed to receive it. *Toddy* is abundantly used by the natives as a cooling beverage, being sweet, and like the water from a tender cocoanut; it is also converted by a process of boiling into sugar, or distilled, after allowing it to be fermented into a kind of inferior spirit called *arak*. The trees begin to yield toddy towards the age of 7\u201410 years, the trunk being then about 4 feet high, and do so for about twenty-five years. The juice is extracted from November to February, each tree yielding during that period 180 pints on an average. Twelve pints of toddy can be converted into one of jaggri, and 4 of this into a pound of sugar, so that each tree produces annually between 7\u20148 lbs. of sugar, which being inferior in quality to cane sugar, sells usually, for three-fourths the price of the latter.\nPhoenix farinosa, Roxb.

The tender floral leaves are eaten raw or cooked with various condiments, and the pulp contained in the lower part of the drupes of the compound fruit is sucked.\n\nAROIDE\u00c6.\n\nBesides several cultivated species of Arum tribe, numerous wild ones afforded food to thousands of people during the late famine. Almost all the species are acrid and some poisonous, but, as stated above, by being boiled their acrid principle is destroyed or removed. The following are some of those which are supposed to have been resorted to:\n\nAmorphophalus campanulatus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 259.\n\nThe root tuberous, brown-coloured, of enormous size. Leaves radical, thrice bifid. Spathe large of a dull-red colour. It grows wild on the banks of rivers in the Konkan, and throughout India. It is widely cultivated for the sake of its root, which is said to be a very nutritious food. It is to be remembered that even this cultivated root is acrid.\n\nAris\u00ebema curvatum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 258. Sup-kanda (Khand\u00e1la name).\n\nM\u00e1ther\u00e1n, Khand\u00e1la and other Konkan hills.\n\nThe tuberous roots of this and allied species of Aris\u00ebema are used for food in times of scarcity by the Lipchas of Sikkim; they are prepared by burying them in masses in the ground, until acetous fermentation sets in, when they are dug up, washed and cooked. By this means the poisonous properties of the root are in part dispersed, but not altogether, and violent illness often follow a hearty meal of \"tong\", as this food is called. The nutritious starch, with which these tubers are filled, might be easily separated by grating and washing, and an aliment as good as Portland Island arrow-root (the starch of Arum maculatum) be thus procured in quantities.\n\nTyphonium bulbiferum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 258.\n\nFound in Malab\u00e1r and Konkan. Both the bulbs and leaves were eaten boiled.\n\nTyphonium divaricatum, Wight. Icon. t. 790.\u2014Arum divaricatum, Roxb. Fl.

Common throughout India.\n\n**Arundinaria Wightiana**, Brand. For. Fl. 562.\u2014*Bambusa arundo*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 299. *Chivari*.\n\nIt is a small thorny bambu, 6 to 12 feet high; grows at higher gh\u00e1ts. Walking-sticks are made of this, and sold at Mah\u00e1baleshvar.\n\nThe tribe *Bambusaceae* is represented by several genera, of which the above are found in the Bombay Presidency.\n\nSome of the bambus flower once in about thirty to thirty-two years, and when such an occurrence takes place, the whole tract extending over many miles is in full flower; it sometimes happens, however, that only a few bambus of a cluster flower each year, when the flowering goes on every succeeding year with the other bambus of the cluster. The variety *Arundinaria Wightiana*, however, flowers and dies down annually, when new shoots spring up from the roots and attain their full size in a single season. Both in this variety as in others the flowering is followed by the death of the stems, so that, after seasons of general flowering, a whole district presents for some time the spectacle of a large forest of dried up clumps. The product of the flowering of the bambu is a rice which is consumed by the poorer people in lieu of common rice. A very palatable bread is said to be made of the flower of this rice, although the colour of it is somewhat darker.\n\nIn the scarcity of 1812 in Orissa, 1864 in K\u00e1nara, and 1866 in M\u00e1lda this rice formed the principal article of the food of the poor population: hence perhaps the belief entertained by some Government officials that the bambu only flowers in seasons of general scarcity.\n\nFrom the young and tender bambu shoot, pickle and preserves are made which are considered very palatable by the natives. The sliced shoots are also made into dishes.\n\nMr. Lethbridge says that all the varieties of bambus are capable of being employed in the manufacture of paper.\nFERMENTED DRINKS.\n\nAnamirta cocculus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 4. Kakamari.\n\nThe drupes of this twining plant are the Cocculus Indicus of commerce. The seeds contained in the drupes are used in Europe to adulterate beer, and in this country to intoxicate and poison fish. It is said that they are also employed in Bombay to increase the intoxicating effects of country spirits sold in retail. As an insecticide they prove very effectual in destroying the pediculi which infest the human body. The drupes are subglobose, or somewhat kidney-shaped, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) in. diameter, black, wrinkled, enclosing an yellowish, oily, very bitter seed, which contains a crystallisable principle named picrotoxin. This is not affected by the re-agents which are usually employed for detecting the bitter poisonous alkaloids. Besides this principle, the seeds contain fat, which amounts to about half their weight, and which is said to be employed for industrial purposes; and stearic acid, formerly thought to be anamirtic or stearophanic acid. Cocculus Indicus is exported from Bombay and Madras, and the stock in the dock-warehouses of London on the 1st December, 1872, was 2,010 packages.\n\nDrury says:\u2014\u201cThat the seeds are illegally employed in the adulteration of beer by the lower class of brewers in England is an undoubted fact, although the penalties imposed by the Legislature are very severe. It is said that 1 lb. of these berries is equal to a sack of malt in brewing, and it was even recommended by one man, who wrote on the \u2018Art of Brewing\u2019, to add 3 lbs. of seeds to every 10 of malt. A considerable quantity of Cocculus Indicus is exported from Malabar and Travancore, and shipped for the London market, where the price varies from 18 to 24 shillings per cwt. The exports from Travancore alone for 1854-55 were upwards of 75 cadies. The imports in the English market are about 240 tons annually. In the four years ending 1856, 5,817 cwts. of the seeds were exported from the Madras Presidency, valued at Rs. 7,124, chiefly to Bombay, the United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that Cocculus Indicus has been exported to various ports of Europe from the earliest times. Gerard (Herbal) says it was well known in England (1597) as Cocculus Indicus, otherwise Cocci vel cocculus orientalis. In 1635 it was subject to an import duty of 2 shillings per pound as Cocculus Indiae. It is said that at the present time it is mostly exported to the Continent of Europe, very little being shipped to England.\n\nAnacardium occidentale, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 18.

Fl. 149. *Rui, arkar or ak*.\n\nThe tribes of the Western Ghats make an intoxicating drink, called *barr*, from the milk sap of the *mudar* or *ak*. The great Akbar was born beneath the *ak*, and took his name from it according to the local tradition of Umakot. Barth states that the pagan tribes of Central Africa also prepare from this plant their *guya*. \u2014Birdwood (B. Products).\n\n**Cannabis Indica** or **Sativa**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 79. *Indian hemp* or *ganja*.\n\nThe three principal forms in which Indian hemp is met with in Indian bazaars are, first, *ganja*, the dried flowering twigs and leaves from which the resin has not been removed; second, *churvas*, the resinous exudation from the stems, leaves and flowers; and, third, *bang, subji* or *sidhi*, the larger leaves and capsules without the stalks. In addition to these a sweetmeat, called *majum*, is made and sold, composed of *bang*, butter, sugar, flour and milk. An infusion of *ganja* or *bang* is also made, to which pounded *datura* seeds are added with the view of increasing the intoxicating and exhilarating effect. Cases of *datura* poisoning do occur when *datura* seeds are mixed in greater proportion than usual.\nDalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. says:\u2014\"In Poona a native beer, called *bhoja*, is brewed from jow\u00e1ri grain malted, and the bang is added as a substitute for hops; this is drunk in large quantities, and is said to be a refreshing and innocuous drink.\"\n\n*Caryota urens*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 278. *M\u00e1r*.\n\nToddy is made and spirit distilled from the sap of this palm.\n\n*Borassus flabelliformis*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 278. *T\u00e1r-goll\u00e1h, t\u00e1r, m\u00e1r*.\n\nToddy is made and spirit distilled from the sap of this palm.\n\n*Cocos nucifera*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 279. *M\u00e1r, narel*.\n\nSpirit is distilled from its sap.\n\n*Phoenix sylvestris*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 278. *Kajuri*.\n\nToddy is made from the sap. *(See Chapter on Fruits and Vegetables and Chapter on Famine Plants.)*\n\n*Saccharum officinale*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 99.\n\nStrong spirit, named *agua ardente*, is distilled at *Goa* from the juice.\nOIL-YIELDING PLANTS.*\n\nBefore giving an account of the oil-yielding plants of this district it may be as well to begin by stating that all oils are either fixed or volatile. Some of the fixed oils are called concrete oils, fatty oils, butyraceous oils or vegetable butters, from the fact of their being solid at ordinary temperature.\n\nCONCRETE OILS.\n\nGUTTIFER\u00c6.\n\nGarcinia Indica, D. C. Prod. i. 561, better known as Garcinia purpurea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 31.\n\nThe oil is obtained from seeds by boiling them in water, and as the decoction cools, it concretes into a solid cake, which is brittle, of a pale-yellowish colour, bland and mild taste, and preserving its solidity to 98\u00b0 Far. When melting in the mouth, it leaves on the tongue a sensation of cold similar to that produced by allowing a piece of ice to dissolve upon it. Kokum oil, as it is called, is used by the natives in cases of chapped skin, hands, face, etc., and also for adulterating ghee. It is an excellent substitute for spermeceti ointment, and is said to be exported to England for admixture with bear\u2019s grease in the preparation of pomatums. Experiments conducted by Mr. D\u2019Oliveira Pimentel and various English chemists have shown that this oil can be utilized for candle-making, and the only difficulty in the way of such a use appears to be that the oil cannot be obtained in sufficiently large quantities to serve such a purpose. The seeds yield only 10 per cent of oil.\n\nSAPOTACE\u00c6.\n\nBassia latifolia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 139. Mohwah tree.\n\nFrom the seeds a large quantity of oil is obtained by expression which is used in lamps and for adulterating ghee. It is thick and coarse, and concretes at 95\u00b0. It was experimented upon some years ago in England, and found useful in candle-making. A ton of it was reported worth \u00a335, at which figure large quantities could be easily disposed of. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nBassia longifolia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 139, or mohe (Hind.)\n\nAlso furnishes an oil very like the above, and used for the same purposes. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n* These notes on the oil-yielding plants of the Konkan are culled from an unpublished paper written for another purpose.\nMYRISTICE\u00c6.\n\nMyristica Malabarica, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 4.\u2014Myristica attenuata, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 4. Jungle jaiphal.\n\nThe fruits of these, like the officinal nutmeg, when bruised and subjected to pressure yield oils which are used medicinally.\n\nFIXED OILS.\n\n(Liquid at the ordinary temperature.)\n\nPAPAVERACE\u00c6.\n\nArgemone Mexicana, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 3. Gamboge thistle and fico del inferno of Europeans, and Feringhee datura or pil\u00e1 datura of the Deccan; suchianas, brahma dundie.\n\nA native of South America, naturalized and very common throughout India. It is an annual, from the seeds of which a bland oil may be obtained by expression, which in half-drachm doses is reputed by West Indian practitioners to act as an aperient and at the same time allay by a sedative action the pain in colic. The cake is extremely nutritious to cattle.\n\nCRUCIFER\u00c6.\n\nBrassica campestris, Napus and B. juncea and their varieties, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 156 and 157. Sarson, kai, kali, surson, tooria, rape seed plant.\n\nAbout 33 per cent. of oil is obtained by expression from the seeds, and is used in India for lamps and dietetical purposes, being seldom exported. A large quantity of the seeds (502,739 cwts. in 1879-80 from Bombay) is, however, being constantly shipped to Europe, etc., where the oil is employed for lubricating machinery. A single locomotive is said to consume 90 to 100 gallons of it annually. Rape seed oil burns considerably longer than olive oil (11 hours of the former to 9 of the latter), and the natives apply it to the body which it is believed to strengthen.\n\nBIXINE\u00c6.\n\nHydnocarbus Wightiana, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 11. Kowti oil, kois-tel.\n\nThe seeds yield on being boiled with water an oil which is sometimes used in lamps at Goa, where it is called koshtel, and also as an external application in cutaneous affections. The natives consider it to be of use in leprosy and ophthalmia.\n\nGUTTIFER\u00c6.\n\nCalophyllum inophyllum, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 31. Andi.\n\nC. Wightianum, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 274.\u2014C. spurium, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 32. Cherupinai. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nMesua ferrea, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 31. N\u00e1g champa or thorla champa. (See Timber Trees.)\nThe seeds of the first-named yield on expression 60 per cent. of an oil used in lamps and for cutaneous affections. The second supplies the oil known under the name of pootunjee oil, used also in skin diseases and for lamps. The oil from the seeds of the third is, according to Dr. \u00c6. Ross, used in K\u00e1nara as an embrocation in rheumatism.\n\n**MALVACE\u00c6.**\n\nGossypium (several varieties), Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 21. Cotton plant, kapas, rui.\n\nA very pure oil is obtained on expression from the seeds of the cotton plant which can be recommended for its cheapness, and may, no doubt, be utilized for burning in lamps. Large quantities of this oil are manufactured at Marseilles, where 96 lbs. of Egyptian seed yielded 2 gallons of oil. The cake is valuable as fodder, and large quantities of it are shipped to the English market from China, especially from Shanghai. 53,616 tons were imported into the United Kingdom in 1852. In India the natives believe in the antidotal virtues of cotton-seed oil when used in cases of poisoning from narcotics. Perhaps as a demulcent the oil may be useful. (See Fibres.)\n\nAmongst the Sterculiace\u00e6 and Tiliace\u00e6 there are several plants capable of yielding oils. Very little use is, however, made of them for this purpose.\n\n**LINE\u00c6.**\n\nLinum usitatissimum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 16. The well-known common flax plant, called tisi or alsi.\n\nLinseed yields 22 per cent. of oil, the remaining 78 per cent. of crushed seed or cake being very useful for fattening cattle. Linseed oil burns 11 per cent. longer than olive oil, and is a good drying oil, being, therefore, in request among painters. Indian linseed oil being, however, mixed with mustard oil, is not so much prized as the foreign. This adulteration is inseparable almost from Indian oil, as the flax and mustard are always cultivated side by side in the same field. Linseed is used for a variety of purposes. It is a demulcent useful in diarrhoea, catarrh, dysentery and visceral obstructions (Ainslie). A decoction of the seeds is employed with advantage in the shape of enema in abrasions of the intestines. When mixed with lime water the oil is a favourable application (Carron oil) to burns and scalds. It is one of the chief ingredients in painter\u2019s inks and oil varnishes. It may be either expressed cold, or by first heating the seeds to about 200\u00b0 and then crushing them. The oil obtained by the latter method has a disagreeable smell and brownish colour. Large quantities of flax are annually imported into England from foreign parts. Russia sent in 1872 \u00a33,000,000 worth, India \u00a31,144,942, Germany \u00a3144,108. The total quantity imported was 1,514,947 quarters. Bombay exported in 1879-80 539,182 cwts. valued at Rs. 36,10,165.\n\n**MELIACE\u00c6.**\n\nMelia azadirachta, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 544. Better known under its other name Azadirachta Indica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 36. Nimb.\nOil-yielding Plants.\n\nFrom the pericarp of the seed an acrid, bitter oil, called \"Margosa oil\", is obtained which is considered to be useful in leprosy and is, moreover, anthelmintic and stimulant, being used externally in cases of bad ulcers and as a liniment in headaches and rheumatic affections. The oil may be obtained either by expression or by boiling and is also used for burning and in imparting colour to cotton cloths, as it has itself a deep yellow dye. A large quantity of it is exported annually from Madras to Ceylon. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nCELASTRINE\u00c6.\n\nCelastrus paniculata, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 47. Staff tree, malkungani, kanguni.\n\nA tall, scandent, unarmed shrub with small yellow flowers in terminal panicles.\n\nCommon on the gh\u00e2ts and the hilly parts of the Konkan. From the seeds an empyreumatic oil is obtained to which Dr. Herklots gave the name of \"Oleum nigrum\", and which he employed in the treatment of \"beri-beri\", in the early stages of which disease it is, no doubt, highly beneficial. It has stimulant properties, and is administered in emulsion in doses of a few drops daily, its introduction into the system being followed in a few hours by free diaphoresis unattended by subsequent exhaustion. The natives call the oil \"Kanguni tel\".\n\nSAPINDACE\u00c6.\n\nSapindus emarginatus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 35, or S. trifoliatus, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 682. Soapnut tree, rhita.\n\nFrom the seeds an oil is obtained which the natives suppose to possess medicinal virtues, and use externally. The capsule is too well known for its detergent properties producing suds when agitated with water. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nANACARDIACE\u00c6.\n\nAnacardium occidentale, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 18. Cashewnut tree, kaju.\n\nTwo oils are obtained from this plant: one black and acrid from the pericarp of the nut, which is rubefacient and vesicant, and is used to floors, wooden rafters, etc., to prevent the ravages of the white ant; and the other from the kernel, which is remarkably sweet, edible and wholesome, and might be employed for pharmaceutical purposes. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nSemicarpus anacardium, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 52. Marking nut tree, biba, bilama.\n\nThis plant also yields two oils like the preceding. The oil of the pericarp is used to remove rheumatic pains, aches, and sprains, and is said to be useful in leprosy and scrofula;\u2014that of the kernels is also useful in sprains and rheumatism. Undiluted it is said to act as a blister. (See Timber Trees.)\n**Buchanania latifolia**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 52. *Pyal, charoli.*\n\nFrom the kernels \"cheronji oil\" is obtained. It has a pale straw colour and is seldom utilized. A black varnish, similar to that of the cashew-nut and other trees of this order, is likewise procured from the pericarp of the nuts of this plant. *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\n**LEGUMINOS\u00c6.**\n\n**Arachis hypogea**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 27. *Bhui-mung or bhuising.*\n\nAn annual, the nuts of which are good for eating and wholesome, and yield 50 per cent. of their weight of an oil considered fit for use for all purposes for which almond and olive oil are employed. This oil does not become easily rancid and has, therefore, been introduced into the Pharmacopoeia of India as a basis for ointments. In Calcutta it is used for adulterating gingelly and other oils and for making soaps, but it can be employed for lubricating the most delicate machinery even. French chemists convert it into a very fine imitation of Lucca oil.\n\n**Pongamia glabra**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 77. *Karunj.*\n\nFrom the seeds an abundance of oil is obtained by expression which is used by the poorer classes in lamps, and is also an efficient application in scabies and other cutaneous affections. It is said to have been used with benefit in mange. *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\n**Wagatea spicata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 80. *Wakiry, wagati.*\n\nAn annual climber with tapering spikes 1-2 feet long, of scarlet and orange-coloured flowers and legumes constricted between seeds. Common in the Konkan jungles.\n\nAn oil used in lamps is procured from the above.\n\nAt the exhibition of 1852 in London, oils from the following were shown:\n\n**Abrus precatorius**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 76. *Gunj*, a climbing shrub.\n\n**Butea frondosa**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 71. *Palas.* *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\n**C\u00e6salpinea bonducella**, Hook. Fl. Ind. ii. 254.\u2014*Guillandina bonducella*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 79. *S\u00e1gargota.* *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\n**Pithecolobium dulce**, Hook. Fl. Ind. ii. 302.\u2014*Inga dulcis*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 25. *Vilaiti \u00e1mli, chinch.* *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\n**Trigonella f\u0153num-gr\u0153cum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 21. *Methi.*\n\n**Dolichos biflorus**, Hook. Fl. Ind. ii. 210.\u2014*D. uniflorus*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 23. *Kulith.*\n\n**Dalbergia sisso**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 24. *Sissu.* Oil is extracted from the wood.\nThat from the bonduc or sagargota nut seems to be only one used medicinally.\n\n**MORINGACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Moringa pterygosperma*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 311. Indian horse-radish, *sujna, mungay, segat*.\n\nA well-known tree, the flowers, pods, and leaves of which are eaten by the natives. The root is said to have medicinal properties, and is a valuable rubefacient. The pods contain about 15 seeds, which when deprived of their 3-winged envelope look like pith-balls. These balls contain about 24 per cent. of a clear, colourless, tasteless and scentless oil, called \"Ben oil\", which might be kept a long time without becoming rancid, and is, therefore, well adapted for the use of the perfumer and watchmaker. *(See Timber Trees).*  \n\n*M. aptdera*, another species indigenous to Africa, also yield \"Ben oil\".\n\n**COMBRETACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Terminalia Bellerica*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 91. The Belleric myrobalan.\n\nOil obtained from the seeds of this is considered a good application to the hair. *(See Timber Trees).*  \n\n*Terminalia catappa*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 38. Indian almond tree.\n\nThe seeds yield a straw-coloured oil which becomes turbid by keeping. When fresh it has a pleasant taste and is edible. The cake is a good feeding for pigs. From the milk of the young leaves an ointment is prepared useful in scabies, leprosy and other cutaneous affections. The juice of the leaves is said to be useful in headache and colicky pains. *(See Timber Trees).*  \n\n*Terminalia chebula*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 91. The chebulic myrobalan.\n\nDr. Birdwood states that an oil is obtained from this plant, but does not tell us to what purposes it is applied. *(See Timber Trees).*  \n\n**CUCURBITACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Cucumis sativus*. Cucumber, *kakri*.\n\nThe seeds yield a sweet edible oil which is seldom extracted.\n\n*Cucumis melo*. Melon, *tarbug*.\n\nFrom the seeds of this a similar oil is obtained.\n\n*Cucurbita pepo*. White gourd or pumpkin, *kaula*.\n\nThe oil from the seeds of this is considered to be anthelmintic by American authors.\n\n**COMPOSIT\u00c6.**\n\n*Carthamus tinctorius*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 45. Bastard safflower, *kasumb, kardai*.\nThis plant is widely cultivated in Europe and Asia from its yielding a dye used for colouring silks. The seeds yield 28 per cent. of a light-yellow oil possessed of drying properties, and useful for culinary purposes and for lamps. This oil is supposed to be the Macassar oil of European perfumers, and although not exported, large quantities of the seed are sent to Liverpool and London.\n\n**Guizotia Abyssinica**, Cas. in Dicc. Sc. Nat. 59-248.\u2014*G. oleifera*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bly. Fl. 128. *Ramtil, kalatil.*\n\nExtensively cultivated on account of its seeds, which yield 35 per cent. of a sweetish oil, which is very cheap, and resembles gingelly oil. It is used in lamps and for culinary purposes by poor people.\n\n**Helianthus annuus**, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 443. Sun-flower plant, *brahmoka* (Mar.), *suraj maka*.\n\nEvery part of this plant has been applied to some useful purpose. Planted on swampy soils, where it grows without any care, it is a protection against intermittent fevers. The seeds yield 15 per cent. of an oil of superior quality used for edible purposes, for lubricating machinery and for mixing colours which artists employ; the pressed residue or cake forming a good, fattening, wholesome food for cattle. When shelled and ground, in place of being crushed for oil, it produces the finest and most palatable of all flour for the preparation of tea-cakes and other fancy bread, for which purpose it is largely used in Spain; and those who have resided in that country will have observed the peculiarly rich and yellowish tinge upon the best bread supplied to them there, which agreeable peculiarity is derived from the flour used. For this and other purposes it has from time to time been imported in considerable quantities into England. The leaves and stalks are good fodder for cattle and poultry of all kinds, though the stalks when reduced to fibre are much more profitable for the manufacture of paper.\n\nIt is said that the sun-flower is extensively cultivated in China, where from the stalk is extracted a fine fibre with which silk is adulterated. Each main head of flowers yields about 800 to 1000 seeds, and the collateral ones 50\u201460 each.\n\n**Sapotaceae.**\n\n**Bassia latifolia**, *B. longifolia*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 139. *Mowah*.\n\nA large tree which attains the height of 40\u201460 ft. From the seeds a greenish-yellow oil is obtained by expression which unscrupulous Banias employ to adulterate ghee (clarified butter) within some parts of India. The seed-cake is stated to be useful for poisoning fish, and its smoke to act as an insecticide, and to kill smaller animals like rats, etc. *(See Timber Trees).*\nExtensively cultivated everywhere on account of its seeds, which yield 45 to 50 per cent. of oil. This oil, which was used in Europe in the days of Pliny instead of olive oil, has a light-yellow colour, a mild agreeable taste, scarcely any smell, and is used in lamps and cookery. It keeps for years without becoming rancid, and in Japan it substitutes butter in frying fish and other purposes. The cake, left after the expression of the oil, is very good fodder for fattening cattle. The seeds are abundantly used in native confectionery mixed with sugar or jaggri; or, roasted and ground into meal, are eaten. Large quantities of it are annually exported to Europe. The exports from Bombay in 1879-80 amounted to 511,368 cwts. valued at Rs. 40,63,241.\n\nGingelly seeds of commerce are of two kinds, one white and the other black, the white variety being the rarer of the two. The black seed or kal\u00e1-til must be carefully distinguished from that of Guizotia Abyssynica, which also bears the same vernacular name.\n\nThe following mode of extraction of the oil is given in the Jury Reports of the Madras Exhibition:\u2014\u201cThe method sometimes adopted is that of throwing the fresh seeds, without any cleansing process, into the common mill, and expressing in the usual way. The oil thus becomes mixed with a large proportion of the colouring matter of the epidermis of the seed, and is neither so pleasant to the eye nor so agreeable to the taste as that obtained by first repeatedly washing the seeds in cold water, or by boiling them for a short time, until the whole of the reddish-brown colouring matter is removed, and the seeds have become perfectly white.\u201d\n\nThe black seeds yield the largest percentage of oil. The oil from both kinds of seeds sells at the same price, the average being from 3 to 4 rupees per maund of 25 lbs.\n\n**EUPHORBIACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Aleurites Molluccana*, Bedd. Fl. Sylv. t. 276.\u2014*A. triloba*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 76. *Akhrut*, Indian or Belganm walnut.\n\nThe nut is palatable, and 3\u00bd pounds of it yield, with very little labour, 10 gallons of a clear oil considered a good substitute for rape seed oil, and fit for employment in the manufacture of candles. *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\n*Ricinus communis*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 78. Castor-oil plant, *erundie* (Dec.)\n\nThere are two species, the large and small seeded. The former yields a heavy, disagreeable, dark-coloured, gross oil which is only fit for burning. The medicinal oil is extracted from the smaller seeds, either with or without the aid of heat, the last being more esteemed as it is paler and cleaner. For domestic use the oil may be obtained by taking, say, 5 sers of the small castor-oil seed, soaking them in cold water for one night, next morning straining off the water, and putting the seeds in fresh water and boiling them for about two hours, then again straining the water off. The seeds must now be dried for three days in the sun, bruised in a mortar\nand set to boil with the addition of ten measures of water, the whole being constantly stirred till all the oil comes up to the top; it may now be strained off, and on cooling is fit for use. Castor-oil is not only purgative, but is also used by the Hindus as an external application in skin-diseases. Large quantities of the oil and seed are exported to Europe. In 1872-73 Bombay sent to Genoa 1350 cwts. seeds and 2452 gallons of oil.\n\n**Jatropha curcas**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 77. Physic nut, Arabi or Mooglai erundie, Japal erundi.\n\nA hedge plant well known to school-boys on account of its juice, which seems to contain caoutchouc, and which is easily blown into bubbles. The seeds yield on expression 30 per cent. of a colourless or pale-yellow oil, which has purgative properties. 12 to 15 drops of this oil are said to be equal in action to an ounce of castor-oil, but the effect is uncertain. The seeds act as an acro-narcotic poison. The diluted oil forms a useful embrocation in chronic rheumatism. It has received the name of seed oil, and has within the last few years been brought to notice as a substitute for olive oil in dressing woollen cloths. It is a good drying oil, and the Chinese employ it in conjunction with oxide of iron in the preparation of a varnish.\n\n**PALM\u00c6.**\n\n*Cocos nucifera*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 279. Cocoanut tree, naril.\n\nEvery body is acquainted with the manifold useful purposes for which this palm is applied. An old writer said that this tree was alone sufficient to build, rig, and freight a ship with bread, wine water, oil, vinegar, sugar and other commodities. The leaves are used for thatching roofs; the thick stem makes picture frames and other articles of furniture; the shell of the nut is made into curiosities. The husk boiled in water is used in fevers; that of the green nut is an anthelmintic. The cabbage or terminal bud makes a fine pickle. The spathe yields toddy used for conversion into jaggri, vinegar, or arrack spirit. The fibres of the husk constitute the coir of commerce. The kernel yields oil, which, besides being used in lamps and cookery, is exported in enormous quantities for employment in soap and candle manufacture. It is also sometimes prescribed medicinally in cases where cod-liver-oil is indicated. Some idea of the enormous quantity of cocoanut oil exported from India may be formed from the fact that from Travancore alone about 1063 candies of oil, besides 20,000 candies copra and above 5 million nuts are shipped annually to various ports. To obtain the oil the kernel is divided into pieces and placed on a shelf with a charcoal fire underneath to dry them. After two or three days they are placed on mats and kept in the sun to dry, when they are fit for the press. A hundred nuts yield in this manner about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gallons of oil; but, since the introduction of steam presses, the yield has considerably increased. The cake is capital food for animals, and is said to be also a very superior kind of manure.\nVOLATILE OILS.\n\nANONACE\u00c6.\n\nUvaria narum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 3.\n\nA climbing shrub, which is a native of the Konkan, Matheran and Travancore, and bears flowers, at first brownish-green, but which subsequently become reddish. The anthers are yellow, and an unctuous secretion exudes from them. From the roots a sweet-scented medicinal oil is extracted on the Malabar Coast.\n\nRUTACE\u00c6.\n\nThis order, of which the orange is a well-known product, furnishes oils of considerable value. The various species of the genus Citrus were originally of Asiatic origin, but are now extensively cultivated throughout temperate Europe also. Oils are procured from the rind, leaves and flowers, principally in Italy and France. The industry is, however, one that can hardly be expected to flourish in India, where the sale of the fruit, which is produced in comparatively small quantity, will be found to be more profitable than its use for the extraction of oil. Small quantities of oil are, however, obtained from the following:\n\nMurraya Koenigii, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 503.\u2014Bergera Koenigii, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 29. Khari nimb (Mar.)\n\nAn oil extracted from this is used medicinally.\n\nZanthoxylum Rhetsa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 45. Cherphal tephli (Goa.)\n\nThe seeds yield an oil which is highly aromatic, and is possessed of medicinal virtues. Being very expensive it is seldom extracted. It may, however, be sometimes met with at Goa.\n\nAtalantia monophylla, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. 28. Makur-limboo, makri.\n\nA medicinal oil esteemed by the natives is obtained from this plant.\n\n\u00c6gle marmelos, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 31. Bela (Mar.)\n\nFrom the flowers a scented water is distilled in Southern India.\n\nROSACE\u00c6.\n\nRosa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 31. Gul\u00e1b (Mar.)\n\nThe several varieties of the rose all yield, or are capable of yielding, rose water and attar or otto. In Ghazipore the distillation of rose water is an industry that engages a large portion of the population\u2014men, women and children, the value of the roses grown in that district amounting to about 15,000 to 20,000.\nRs., and the profit made by their distillation to Rs. 40,000. A thousand roses yield 1\u00bd ser of rose water, but it is estimated that a tola of the attar requires one lac of flowers. This attar, which is pure (that sold in the bazar is always adulterated with sandalwood or geranium oil or roosa-oil) is sold at 50 to 60 Rs. per tola, and is not exported, being barely sufficient to meet the demands of native princes and magnates. It congeals at 20\u00b0 C. The method of obtaining the oil and water employed at Ghazipore is of the most primitive kind and involves much wastage. An account of it may be found in Dr. W. W. Hunter's Statistics of Bengal. Improved methods would, no doubt, increase both the yield as well as the profits. The natives consume large quantities of rose water on occasions of marriage festivals, and use it also in their sweetmeats.\n\nUMBELLIFER\u00c6.\n\nCarum copticum, Hook. Fl. Ind. ii. 682.\u2014Ptychotis ajowan, Dalz. & Gibs. Bhy. Fl. Suppl. 41. The ajowan, owa, or oomum plant, Bishop\u2019s weed.\n\nAn annual cultivated all over India, the seeds of which yield a volatile oil, colourless at first, but which soon acquires a yellow tinge. It has the odour of the fruit, and an acrid burning taste, and is used as a stimulant, carminative and antispasmodic.\n\nPtychotis montana, a common plant in the hills of the Konkan.\n\nThe seeds yield oil, which is used in rheumatism.\n\nSAPOTACE\u00c6.\n\nMimusops elengi, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 140. Wowli (Mar.), bacul mulsari (Hind.)\n\nA tree common to the whole of India, the flowers of which contain a volatile oil from which a sweet-scented water is distilled. The seed also contains oil. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nOLEACE\u00c6.\n\nThis order supplies us with some of the most sweet-scented of our garden plants, such as\u2014\n\nJasminum sambac, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 137. Mogra.\n\nJasminum latifolium, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 138. Kussar.\n\nNyctanthes arbortristis, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 51. Parijatuhk.\n\nAnd several other jasmines from all of which we may distil the volatile oils, or, if they are fugaceous, employ them for scenting some of the fixed oils. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nOlea fragrans, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 50.\n\nIntroduced from China, and used for perfuming teas.\nLABIAT\u00c6.\n\nIn this order, instead of the English thyme, lavender, rosemary, mint, &c., we have\u2014\n\nOcimum sanctum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 204. The sacred tulsi (Mar.) used in Hindu worship.\n\nOcimum basilicum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 203. Sweet basil, firanjmushk (Pers.) which possesses a fragrant camphoraceous taste, and is used for its supposed stimulant, diaphoretic and expectorant virtues.\n\nOcimum pilosum. Tukhm-i-rahan (Mar.)\n\nUsed as a demulcent in catarrh and for the relief of after-labour pains.\n\nOcimum gratissimum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 203. Tulsi-bija, tulsi bij.\n\nConsidered to be useful in the aphthae of children.\n\nMicromeria Malcolmiana, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 209. Possessed of all the aromatic and carminative properties of peppermint.\n\nAnisomeles Malabarica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 210, or Gul-i-qaozaban, than which few plants are more appreciated by the natives; an infusion of the bitter aromatic leaves being useful as a stomachic, and the oil distilled from them being considered an effective application in rheumatism.\n\nPogostemon patchouli, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 66. Patcha (Mar.), the tops of which were at one time used for scenting Cashmere shawls exported to Europe, and are now left in our cupboards for the like purpose.\n\nLavandula Burmanni, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. 207. Goroa (Mar.)\n\nVery common in Poona and the Deccan. And many other highly aromatic plants common in India might be utilized in substitution for oils received from Europe.\n\nLAURACE\u00c6.\n\nCinnamomum Zeylanicum, D. C. Prod. xv. 1-13. Dara chini (Mar.)\n\nThe bark is met with in the bazar in closely rolled quills of a light-yellowish brown colour and fragrant smell. This smell is due to the presence of a volatile oil possessed of aromatic, carminative and stimulant properties which is much used in medicine. A drop or two introduced into a carious tooth is found useful in relieving toothache. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nSANTALACE\u00c6.\n\nSantalum album, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 224. White sandalwood or safed chandan.\nThis tree is well known for its fragrant wood, the distillation of which yields 3 per cent. of a fragrant oil which is a perfect substitute for copaiba. The part of the wood nearest the root yields the best oil. The wood rubbed in water is used as an application to erysipelasous inflammations and cutaneous affections, and allays the itching. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**PANDANACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Pandanus odoratissimus*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 279. The screw pine, *keura* (Mar.)\n\nA well-known bushy shrub with long imbricated leaves, the margins of which are armed with fine sharp spines. The sexes on separate bushes. Fruit like a pine apple. The bracts are very fragrant, and an oil, called *keura oil*, is distilled from them. The perfume is chiefly extracted from the male flower bracts. The oil impregnated with the odour of the flower bracts, and the water distilled from them called *keura-arak*, are esteemed stimulant and antispasmodic, and employed in headache and rheumatism. A medicinal oil is also prepared from the roots.\n\n**GRAMINE\u00c6.**\n\nThe scented grasses are grown and cultivated throughout the Presidency. The following are frequently met with:\n\n*Andropogon nardoides*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 302; Linn.\n\nThe grass which yields the oil of *citronelle*, and is cultivated in Ceylon, where it reaches the height of 6 to 7 ft. This oil has a light-greenish colour, and is exported to Europe. It is used in medicine for the same purposes as the lemon grass or verbena grass oil.\n\n*Andropogon Sch\u00e6nanthus*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 99; Linn.; which yields oil known as lemon oil.\n\nThis oil is used in Turkey for adulterating otto of roses. Before being mixed with the attar it is shaken with water acidulated with lemon juice, and then exposed to the sun and air. This process gives to the oil a pale straw colour and deprives it of its penetrating after smell. A large quantity of grass oil added to the attar prevents the congelation of the latter.\n\n*Andropogon Iwarancusa*, Roxb.; Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 301.\n\nIt is found at Ahmedabad and Karachi. It yields an oil named *cusha* oil.\n\nThe oil-yielding grasses of India require careful examination. It appears to me that *Andropogon Martini* of Roxburg and *A. nardoides*, found in Kh\u00e1ndoseh and parts of the Deccan, are varieties of *Andropogon Iwarancusa*.\n\n*Andropogon muricatus*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 302. *Khus-khus* (Mar.)\n\nThis grass is well known from its fragrant root used for making *tatties*. No oil, however, appears to be extracted from it.\nFIBROUS PLANTS.*\n\nThe Bombay Presidency produces a large number of plants that yield fibre for conversion into strings and ropes, or suitable for paper manufacture.\n\nANONACE\u00c6.\n\n*Unona pannosa*, Bedd. For. Sylv. An. Gen. ix.\n\nThe inner bark gives strong fibre adapted for cordage and paper-making.\n\nBIXINE\u00c6.\n\n*Bixa orellana*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 5. *Kesri, shendri, arnotto*.\n\nFrom the bark of this plant cordage is made in the West Indies. This is a tall shrub or small tree with cordate leaves on long petioles, flowers in terminal panicles, pale, purple, or white; capsules prickly. The red pulp which covers the seed is called *arnotto* and is used for colouring cheese.\n\nMALVACE\u00c6.\n\nThis order contains numerous plants, the inner bark of which yields fibre.\n\n*Thespesia populnea*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 18. *Bendi*.\n\nThe bark yields coarse fibres adapted for paper.\n\n*Hibiscus cannabinus*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 20. *Ambari*.\n\nIt is cultivated for its capsule, which is used as a vegetable. An annual or perennial, stem glabrous, prickly, leaves lower cordate, upper deeply palmately five-partite, segments narrow, lanceolate, acuminate, serrate, petiole prickly. Stipules pointed. Flowers axillary, yellowish, with a crimson centre, sepals bristly.\n\nThe fibres of this plant\u2014which are prepared by steeping the stems in water, are hard, and more remarkable for strength than for fineness\u2014might be considerably improved by care. A line made of them, 4 ft. long, sustained, when dry, a weight of 115 lbs.; in the wet state its tenacity was greatly increased, and it bore a strain of 133 lbs. Is only adapted as a mixture for the commoner description of paper.\n\n* These notes are a summary of an unpublished paper written for another purpose.\nHibiscus mutabilis, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 1. The changeable rose, or \"amor inconstante\" (inconstant love) of the Portuguese.\n\nA tall shrub common in gardens.\n\nHibiscus (Abelmoschus) esculentus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 7. Bhendy.\n\nA much cultivated esculent. A line made from the fibres of this sustained, when dry, a weight of 79 lbs., and when wet of 95 lbs. This fibre is rougher than that of H. cannabinus, and therefore, adapted for conversion into paper.\n\nHibiscus tiliaceus, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 192.\u2014Paritium tiliaeum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 17.\n\nA tree met with in Bombay wild and in gardens, of the inner bark of which in Otaheite, matting, lines for fishing and ropes are made, and which in the West Indies is sucked in times of famine.\n\nHibiscus furcatus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 19.\n\nA prickly plant the bark of which is also full of strong white fibres possessed of considerable tenacity. A dry line made from them broke at 89 lbs. and a wet one at 92 lbs.\n\nHibiscus Surratensis, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 20. Rhan bhendy, the bark of which also yields strong fibre.\n\nHibiscus sabdariffa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 7. Roselle plant.\n\nFrom the bark of this, when the stem is cut while the plant is in flower, a fine and silky fibre may be obtained. Of the calyces and capsules freed from the seed jellies and tarts are made.\n\nAnother Malvaceous plant, which has of late attracted much attention is\u2014\n\nMalachra capitata or rotundifolia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 9.\n\nAn annual or perennial, prickly. Leaves orbicular, and rather angled 5-6 in. broad. Stipules narrow. Flowers small, yellow, in axillary or terminal heads. Fruits nearly globose, depressed.\n\nThis plant is said to have been introduced into India from Brazil; it now grows and thrives everywhere, attaining in good situations the height of 4-9 ft. The fibre has a silvery appearance with a peculiar lustre, and is almost as soft as silk. In passing the fibre through the machinery damped with oil and water, as is commonly done with Konkan jute, yarn was produced strong enough and nearly equal to that made from the second quality of Bengal jute. If the plant is carefully grown and well looked after, the fibre would, no doubt, rank fully equal to Bengal and Bombay jute. Owing to the high prices ruling for jute in Bengal and elsewhere the new fibre, if carefully prepared, would command a ready sale at Rs. 3.12-0 to Rs. 4 per Indian maund. But it is not so valuable for spinning as jute, being harsh, and lacking the forked ends of the latter.\nFibrous Plants.\n\n**Abutilon Indicum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 18.\n\nBelonging to the same family, also yields good fibre. It is a tall herbaceous plant, 3-5 ft. high, known at Goa, M\u00e1lva and Bengal as *petari* (a name given also to an euphorbaceous plant, *Trewia nudiflora*) and in Bombay as *mudmi* and sometimes as *kangai* (comb). Other species of this genus also furnish good fibre.\n\n**Urena lobata** and **Urena sinuata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 18.\n\nThe latter known at M\u00e1lvan and Goa as *tupkoty*, both supplying a material fit for conversion into cordage and paper.\n\n**Sida carpinifolia**, D. C. Prod. i. 460.\u2014*Sida acuta*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 17.\n\n*Pat*, called *ch\u00e1* (tea plant) at Goa, and the several species of this genus all of which abound in very tough and strong fibres, which are easily made into ropes, and are also fit for the manufacture of paper.\n\nThen again we have the cotton plant. Although merchants deal in a large number of cottons, there are, as a matter of fact, only four species of the genus *Gossypium*, with their varieties, which are recognized by botanists, viz.:\n\n**Gossypium Stocksii**, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 349.\n\nFound wild in Sind.\n\n**Gossypium herbaceum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 8.\n\nCultivated all over India, and having four varieties\u2014\n\n*G. obtusifolium*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 183.\n\n*G. hirsutum*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 185.\n\n*G. religiosum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 8.\n\n*G. vitifolium*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 186.\n\n**Gossypium arboreum**.\n\nFound in the plains of India and in gardens; not generally cultivated.\n\n**Gossypium Barbadense**, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. 187.\n\nIt is cultivated, and yields the several American varieties. Of this form we have the variety\u2014\n\n*G. acurminatum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 8.\n\nIt is usually larger in foliage than the other varieties and species. The natives call the cotton plant *kappas* or *kapus*.\n\nThe white hairs obtained from the capsules are known all the world over from the many domestic and manufacturing uses to which they are applied. The sacred thread of the Br\u0101hmans must, according to the institutes of Manu, be made of cotton only, and Zoroaster enjoined on his followers the use of the cotton *sadra*, and on the priesthood the white cotton turban as symbolic of their holy calling and of the pure lives they were expected to lead. Besides the hairs obtained from the capsules of the cotton plant, fibres may also be extracted from the bark of the stem, which are fit for conversion into cordage and paper.\n**Kydia calycyna**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 24. *Warung*. Also yields excellent fibre.\n\n**Adansonia digitata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 9. *Gorik-chinch*, *gorak-ambla*, *baobab*.\n\nContains fibres fit for cordage and for the manufacture of paper.\n\n**Eriodendron anfractuosum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 22.\n\nYields an excellent, clean, white fibre adapted for rope and paper-making.\n\n### STERCULIACE\u00c6\n\nIn this order, which is allied to the *Malvaceae*, we find the following fibre-yielding plants:\n\n**Sterculia guttata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 23.\n\nA large tree common along the gh\u00e2ts, yielding seeds the size of a chestnut which are roasted and eaten by the natives.\n\nThe tree is known to them by the name of *kukar* or *goldar*. Cloth is manufactured from the bark of this tree at Malab\u00e2r in the following manner:\u2014The tree is felled, its branches lopped, the trunk cut into pieces, 6 ft. long, a perpendicular incision is made in each, the bark opened, taken off entire, chopped, washed, and dried in the sun. In this state it is used for clothing. The tree is not cut for this purpose till the tenth year. The fibres are well adapted for cordage and for coarse paper.\n\n**Sterculia colorata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 23. *Khowsay* or *bhechkhol*.\n\nA large tree, found in the jungle tracts of the Konkan, which also yields fibre.\n\n**Sterculia villosa**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 22. *Gul-kandar*.\n\nA large tree growing in the Konkan, Veng\u00fbrla and K\u00e2nara, from the bark of which ropes and bags are made in Goa and K\u00e2nara.\n\n**Sterculia urens**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 23. *Kavali* or *kandul*.\n\nAlso a large tree furnishing fibres as good as those of the preceding, and a gum resembling and used as a substitute for tragacanth.\n\n**Sterculia foetida**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 10. *Jungly badam*, *poon* or mast-tree, *deodar* of the natives of Bombay.\n\nA tall straight tree, the trunk of which is used by the natives for masts.\n\n**Helicteres isora**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 22. *Muradsing*, *kwaan*, *kiwani*, *dhamni*, or screw-tree.\n\nA tall shrub or small tree. Flowers bright red and showy, appear in the rains, carpels five, screw-like, twisted together. The fibres are used in the manufacture of ropes; they are very coarse.\n\n**Guazuma tomentosa**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 11.\n\nThe bastard cedar of American origin and common in Bombay. The inner bark yields good strong fibre.\nFibrous Plants.\n\nTILIACE\u00c6.\n\nIn this order, which is also allied to the two preceding, several fibre-yielding plants are to be met with.\n\nGrewia tili\u00e6folia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 26. Daman.\n\nGrewia microcos, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 26. Shiral, ansale.\n\nIt bears fruit of a blackish purple colour, eaten by the natives.\n\nGrewia Asiatica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 26.\n\nCultivated on account of its gratefully acid fruit called phalai.\n\nGrewia polygama, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 26. Gowli or g\u00e6wali.\n\nCommon in S\u00e1lsette and the gh\u00e2ts. The other species of Grewia also yield good fibres.\n\nTriumpheta angulata, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 25.\n\nT. rotundifolia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 25. Called at M\u00e1lvan and Goa tucoty.\n\nIt might be utilized for the same purposes as Grewia oppositifoliu, of the inner bark of which the Himalayan natives make ropes and coarse cloth.\n\nBut the most important plant belonging to this order is\n\nCorchorus capsularis, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 25. The jute plant.\n\nAn annual. Leaves oblong, acuminate, coarsely toothed, base generally prolonged into tail-like appendages. Flowers small, yellow. Capsule truncate, wrinkled, muricated, 5-celled. Seeds few in each cell.\n\nCommon throughout India. Jute is an article that has begun to figure in commerce only during the last quarter of a century. About that time barely 5000 tons of it were imported annually into England; forty years ago the imports were nil. At present England imports, on an average, 300,000 tons of the fibre annually, and all this enormous quantity and more is produced in India, whence it is also sent to other parts of Europe and America. The fibres of C. capsularis are remarkable for their strength: a line 4 ft. long made from them sustained, when dry, a weight of 143 lbs., and when wet of 146 lbs. Similar to it is\n\nCorchorus olitorius, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 25.\n\nAn annual. Leaves ovate, acuminate, 3-5 nerved, serrated, the two lower serratures prolonged into long sharp points. Flowers yellow, peduncles 1-3-flowered. Capsules nearly cylindrical, elongated, 10-ribbed, 10 to 12 times longer than broad, with sometimes 5 terminal points.\n\nCommonly cultivated as a pot herb, and for its fibres; also called jute. These filaments are, however, not so thin as those of the foregoing, nor so strong. A dry line made from them sustained only 113 lbs., and a wet one 125 lbs. The natives are said to use the leaves and tender shoots of this plant for making salad.\n**LIN\u00c9AE.**\n\nIn this order we have the following very common and extensively cultivated plant:\n\n*Linum usitatissimum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 16. *Alsi*, the common flax plant.\n\nAn annual. Stem 2-4 ft. high, erect, branched above, simple below. Leaves narrow, lanceolate. Flowers blue-coloured, 1-in. diam. Capsule 5-celled.\n\nThe plant yields excellent filaments, but unfortunately they are utilized in few places for commercial purposes, in this country the cultivation being carried on more with a view to producing a large crop of the seed from which linseed oil is obtained, than for the fibre.\n\n**RHAMNACEAE.**\n\nRepresented by only one small shrub,\n\n*Ventilago Madraspatana*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 48. *Lakand\u00ed kanvail*.\n\nFrom the bark of this cordage is made. Rumphius says that the Ambocyna fishermen use the flexible stems of it instead of ropes.\n\n**LEGUMINOSAE.**\n\nThis order is represented by a few fibre-yielding plants, although it supplies us with a large quantity of beans, grains, medicines, dyes and timbers. The plant best known is\n\n*Crotalaria juncea*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 54. The hemp; *sunn* or *tag* as it is called by the natives.\n\nAnnual, stem erect, 4-8 ft. high, slightly striated, and more or less clothed with shining silky pubescence. Stipule and bracts setaceous. Leaves scattered, narrow, lanceolate, obtuse, mucronate, 2-6 in. long by \u00bd in. broad. Racemes terminal. Flowers papilionaceous, large, of a beautiful bright-yellow colour; calyx densely covered with rusty tomentum. Pod club-shaped, 2 in. long, broader upwards, twice the length of the calyx, downy. Seeds numerous, kidney-shaped.\n\nIt is hardly necessary here to enter into a description of the various methods of extracting the *sunn* fibre, or of the several purposes for which it is employed. The usual method is by steeping the stems in running or stagnant water for a few days. It may be stated here that the great Hindu lawgiver Manu enjoined on the Kshatriyas the use of the sacred thread made of the *sunn* fibre. *C. Burhia* and several other *Crotolarias*, of which there is a goodly number, all yield more or less good fibre which is extensively used for cordage and gunnies. The refuse could be employed (as well as the fibre itself) for paper-making. In fact, old gunnies are often used here and also exported for this purpose.\n\n*Butea frondoza*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 71. *Pallas*.\n\nThe bark of the roots of which yields a fibre used for caulking boats on the Ganges and other rivers; also for slow matches and cordage.\nFibrous Plants.\n\nBauhinia racemosa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 82. *Apta* tree, the fibres of which make strong and durable ropes, and the bark slow matches for matchlock men.\n\nBauhinia Vahlii, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 83. *Chambudi.*\n\nCommon at Khand\u00e1la, Thal and other gh\u00e1ts. Is an immense stout climber, from the bark of which ropes are prepared by boiling and then beating it. This fibre is suited only for the coarser kind of paper. The seeds are eaten raw, and the leaves are employed for thatching houses.\n\nAcacia leucophlea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 86. *Hiwar.*\n\nIs said to yield a strong and tough fibre used for fishing nets and cordage.\n\n**MYRTACE\u00c6.**\n\nIs represented by a single plant.\n\nCareya arborea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 95. *Kumba* or *kumbia.*\n\nIt supplies coarse strong cordage, and a stuff suitable for brown paper of good quality.\n\n**ASCLEPID\u00c6.**\n\nIn this order we meet with\n\nCalotropis gigantea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 159. *Rui* or *rowee,* *arka* or *akari.*\n\nA tall shrub covered with soft white tomentum. Leaves 4-8 in. long, oblong, ovate or obovate, downy, short-acuminate, nearly sessile, with a cordate, often amplexicaul base. Flowers large, purplish, lilac, or white, inodorous, with a grey down outside. Corolla, lobes spreading or reflexed. Follicles ovoid, ventricose, green.\n\nCommon in the Konkan. From incisions in the bark an article which, when duly prepared, answers all the tests and has many of the properties of gutta-percha, can be produced.\n\nThe stems, when cut and dried, yield a lustrous, silk-like fibre, equal in many respects to flax, and superior in strength to hemp. To obtain it the method followed in some places is: the largest branches are cut during the flowering season in October-November, and allowed to dry for three days. They are then beaten, and the fibre is picked off the inside of the bark, the workmen biting through it about the centre of the whole length, holding the tissue of the fibre in one hand, and separating the bark with the other. The fibre is also obtained by steeping the stems in water, but this process injures the filaments. Ropes and fishing lines are made from the fibre, and hill-men make their bow-strings from it, as it lasts well (about five years) through all sorts of weather. In former times a cloth for the use of princes was manufactured from it.\n\nThe follicle on bursting yields a smooth, glossy, yellowish-white product much resembling silk floss. This floss or cotton is utilized for spinning and weaving, but being difficult to spin on account of its glossy nature and short fibre, it is usually mixed with cotton in various proportions. It seems also capable of being blended with silk or wool to produce a brilliant, yet cheap, article of wear. It is also employed for stuffing pillows and quilts, and if collected free from dirt it only requires the ordinary bow to make it fit for use.\nFor paper manufacture this cotton has the great advantage that it can very easily be had clean, and requires no elaborate preparation beyond maceration in water, pulping, and but little washing to convert it into paper stuff. Some very fair paper was prepared in this manner in the Gujar\u00e1t Jail. The fibres of the stem are also well suited for making a first-class paper, being long, flexible, and very strong; in fact, in Bell\u00e1ry and Furruckabad paper has been manufactured from it.\n\nThe leaves and stalks serve for reclaiming reh (covered with saline efflorescence) lands. These leaves are strewn about the ground and covered with earth, and then crushed by being stamped upon. Water is then let on the land enough to flood it. When the water subsides the crushing is repeated, and the land again inundated. The decomposition of the leaves somehow or other \"kills the salt\", as the natives say. In fact, land that was thus treated for two successive years got so free from saline matter as to yield a very fair crop.\n\nAll parts of the plant are full of milk, which has powerful medicinal properties.\n\n**Calotropis procera**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 149.\n\nClosely allied to the last, if not the identical species.\n\nMet with in the arid places of the Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t. The dried and powdered root bark is an excellent alternative, diaphoretic and in large doses an emetic, and is used in cutaneous diseases, especially leprosy. The supposed active principle extracted from this plant is called mudarin, and has the property of being soluble in water and coagulating by heat. Fibres are also extracted from this plant in Arabia. They are very strong.\n\n**Hoya viridiflora**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 153. *Dodi* or *hiran dori*.\n\nA common creeper used as a substitute for rope to tie up bundles of firewood.\n\n**Hoya pendula**, Dalz. & Gibs. Fl.

The fibres are fine and silky, and are adapted for cordage and for paper manufacture.\n\n**BORAGIN\u00c6**.\n\nIn this order only one plant is found,\n\n**Cordia Rothii**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 174.\n\nFrom the bark of this ropes are made.\n\n**URTICACE\u00c6**.\n\nTo this order belongs the well-known\n\n**Cannabis Indica** or **C. sativa**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 79. *Ganja* plant.\nFibrous Plants.\n\nIt supplies the hemp of commerce. It is cultivated throughout Hindustan, but principally at Nagar and in the peninsula, more on account of its leaves, stalks and flowers, wherein resides the intoxicating substance which furnishes bh\u00e1ng and churrus, and which the natives use in smoking and as a drink. The use of this resin is almost general, and in small doses is not hurtful to health. In Poona, beer, called bhoja, is manufactured from the grain of jow\u00e1ri, to which bh\u00e1ng is added in place of hops. The Indian method of cultivating the hemp plant, which consists in sowing the plants at great distances from each other so as to allow a large number of branches to come out, is not fitted for the production of good long fibre. Hemp was known to the ancients long before the birth of Christ. Pliny says that the Romans were well acquainted with it, and Hiero, king of Syracuse, rigged his ships with ropes made of this fibre. The plant flourishes best at elevations of 4 to 7000 ft., and the best fibre is obtained from the male plants, which are cut a month earlier than the females.\n\nGirardinia heterophylla, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 238. Avah.\n\nA large shrub, armed with long stinging bristles which produce intense pain on being touched.\n\nCommon in the plains and forests of India and Burma, but chiefly in the Himalayas. Yields a fine fibre used in Sikkim for ropes, twines and coarser cloths.\n\nDebregeasia longifolia, Wedd.\u2014Conocephalus niveus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 239. Kapsi.\n\nA tall shrub or small tree.\n\nCommon at Mah\u00e1baleshwar and the Konkan jungles. The inner bark yields a fibre which in Ceylon, etc., is used for cordage and fishing-nets.\n\nBohemeria nivea, D. C. Prod. xvi. i. 206.\u2014Urtica tenacissima, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 78.\n\nIt grows spontaneously in Assam, where it is called rhea or china grass, and from which a fabric, called \"grass cloth\", is manufactured.\n\nIt was cultivated experimentally in many places, and during the administration of Lord Mayo the Government offered a prize of 50,000 Rs. for the best machine for extracting rhea fibre, and took other measures for extending the cultivation of this plant. The fibre is one of the best produced in the world, but difficult of preparation.\n\nSplitgerbera scabrella, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 239.\u2014Sponia Wightii, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 238.\n\nFrom the latter plant, called gol in Bombay, the Garrows of Assam obtain a cloth with which they cover themselves.\n\nAntiaris toxicaria, Lesch.\u2014A. saccidora, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 244. Chandul.\n\nCommon on the gh\u00e1ts and in Konkan, and from the bark of which sacs used to carry rice are made in a curious way. It yields also a good fibre which makes good cordage, and affords an excellent material for paper.\nMorus Indica \\{ Cultivated. Their bark is of a fibrous nature, Fibrous Plants. M. alba. \\} well adapted for the manufacture of paper.\n\nThe twigs of *M. Indica* are, on account of their toughness and strength, employed in some parts of India in binding and tying bundles of fuel, loads, etc.\n\n*Ficus Bengalensis*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 240. *Vad* or *war*.\n\nThe bark and the aerial roots give a coarse fibre adapted for rope-making. The fibre is used by the Sikhs for slow-matches to their match-locks.\n\n*Ficus religiosa*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 21. *Pipal*.\n\nIt is said that paper for green umbrellas was made in Burma from the bark of this tree.\n\n*Ficus infectoria*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 241.\n\nThe inner bark yields a tough fibre good for rope. Many other plants of this order yield excellent fibre for cordage and as a material for paper.\n\n**SCITAMINE\u00c6.**\n\nThis order furnishes us with the various species of the plantain, of which the ordinary table plantain is a well-known specimen. It is called\n\n*Musa paradisiaca* or *sapientum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 88.\n\nThe outer layers of the sheaths of the leaves yield a fine white fibre of considerable length and strength.\n\nThe ordinary method of obtaining the fibre is by scraping the sheathing footstalk of the leaf with a piece of iron and subsequently washing it to free it from pulp; but if the stem, previously cut longitudinally into four parts, is crushed between proper rollers, a much better quality of fibre can be had; each tree being calculated to yield about 4 lbs. of it. This fibre is fitted for conversion into straight ropes of considerable strength; a rope made from it sustaining 864 lbs. as against 924 lbs. borne by a similar one of pine-apple fibre. It can also be turned to use for making paper, as can also the combings. These combings make a good substitute for horse hair for stuffing purposes, etc. The peduncle or core can also be made to yield a half of it of stuff for paper-making.\n\n*Musa superba* and *Musa ornata*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 212.\n\nThese also contain fibre. These plants are known as *ran-kela*. Common over the slopes of Khand\u00e1la and other gh\u00e1ts.\n\n**AMARYLLIDE\u00c6.**\n\n*Agave Americana*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 166.\u2014*A. Cantula*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 93. *Jungly annanas*.\n\nFrom its leaves very tough and silk-like white fibres are procured which the natives of Malab\u00e1r use for making ropes and cordage.\nFibrous Plants.\n\nLILIACE\u00c6.\n\nSansevieria Zeylanica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 91. Bowstring hemp, murgali, morwa.\n\nWild and cultivated in Malab\u00e1r, Konkan, Ceylon, etc.\n\nThe fibre is usually removed by either steeping the leaves in water till the pulpy part has become rotten and can then be easily separated, or the leaves being placed on a board are scraped with a rough stick or iron till all the pulp has come away. The best method appears to be the latter, which is the same as is followed in the case of the Ananas sativa. The first-mentioned one yields a discoloured fibre in consequence of the fibres having to be steeped in water.\n\nThe fibre is pliant, soft and silky, and much resembles that of the pineapple. It is used for making thread, twine, bow-string, ropes, etc., and stands a greater strain than even Russian hemp: a line made from it bearing a weight of 120 lbs., while a similar one of Russian hemp broke at 105 lbs. It is also sometimes used for making a fine class of cloth, and is considered very valuable for paper manufacture, for which last mentioned purpose it has been utilized at Trichinopoly.\n\nYucca gloriosa.\n\nA native of America, but cultivated everywhere\u2014in this Presidency and elsewhere\u2014thrives well even in Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Has long sword-like leaves, terminating in a thorny point, and throws out a long flowering stalk surmounted by an ample panicle consisting of numerous (about 150-200) lily-like yellowish white flowers.\n\nThe fibre is 2-4 ft. long, rather wiry, fine, and strong; takes colour easily.\n\nBROMELIACE\u00c6.\n\nThis order gives us the pine-apple.\n\nAnanas sativa or Bromelia Ananas, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 94. Pine-apple.\n\nFrom its leaves beautiful silky fibres are obtained. The process is extremely simple. The leaf is stretched on a board, and the epidermis removed with a blunt knife, when the long white fibres lying on the lower parenchyma, running in a longitudinal direction, are exposed. These are easily detached by means of a pin, and are fit for use.\n\nA cloth from these is manufactured in the Philippines which equals, if it does not surpass, the finest muslins and cambrics. The fibres are very strong, and are not injured by immersion in water. In the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, at Goa, and along the coast of Malab\u00e1r, the natives use a string made from them for stringing gold ornaments and pearls.\n\nPANDANACE\u00c6.\n\nThis order is represented by only one plant,\n\nPandanus odoratissimus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 279.\n\nThis is the well-known and much used keura of the natives, an elegant shrub 6-10 ft. high, roots fusiform, issuing from the stem. Leaves 3-5 ft. long, at the extremities of the branches, drooping, smooth and shining; margins and back armed with sharp spines.\nFlower bracts light-yellow, very sweet-scented, fruit like a pine-apple and orange-coloured.\n\nThe fibres are obtained from the leaves which are cut for this purpose every second year. Each plant yields enough fibre to make two bags. In the Mauritius, sugar and coffee are packed in these bags; 140 lbs. of sugar are put into each bag, which never bursts, although holding so great a weight. The floral leaves are eaten either raw or boiled. The lower pulpy part of the drupes is eaten by the natives in times of scarcity. The roots are used by basket-makers to tie their work with, and being spongy they make a substitute for corks. The fibres are said to be also good for making paper, and the natives use them for the manufacture of a fine kind of mat to sleep upon. An oil prepared from the roots is employed in rheumatism.\n\nPALM\u00c6.\n\nThis order, to which the well-known cocoanut and date palm belong, also supplies very tough, durable and elastic fibres.\n\n*Cocos nucifera*, Dalz & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 279. *Maar*, cocoanut.\n\nProduces all our coir, which is used for a variety of purposes.\n\n*Caryota urens*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby Fl. 288. *Birli-maar*.\n\nCommon all over the Konkan, and supposed by some to be a native of Ceylon; also yields very strong fibres. They are obtained from the long flower-stalks, and ropes made from them are so strong that they are used for securing wild elephants; fishery lines are made from them.\n\n*Borassus flabelliformis*. *Tar* or *tad*.\n\nThe leaf fibres, which are about 2 ft. in length, are used in some parts of the Madras Presidency for making ropes and strings. The fibre round the nut is said to be suited for paper, but the supply of it would be small.\n\n*Phoenix sylvestris*. *Khajuri*.\n\nBags, basket work and mats are made from the leaves, and the footstalks of which are converted after being beaten into well ropes. The fibres are plentiful, soft, bleach well, and are very well adapted for the use of paper-makers. A free supply can always be obtained.\n\n*Areca catechu*.\n\nThe nut is imbedded in a covering of coir, consisting of three layers, the middle one of which is woody and coarse; the other two are fine and soft, and it is believed might be utilized for paper.\n\nGRAMINE\u00c6.\n\n*Saccharum spontaneum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 304.\n\nCommon in every part of India. In Sind it is abundant, and grows to be a tall grass about 3-15 ft. high. It is also found on the banks of the Deccan rivers and in Domus. It is distinguished from the other varieties by its wavy feathery flowers which have a silky whiteness. The culms are made into native pens, brooms, and the leaves after being deprived of their soft parts are used to make\nFibrous Plants. strings of. The whole plant is sometimes employed for thatching. It is also used as fodder.\n\nSaccharum mimja is a tall grass which is found throughout India, and principally in the Punjab, where it covers large tracts of land, and often encroaches upon cultivated ground.\n\nThe part of the plant which is most useful is the flower-stalk, which, after being deprived of its sheath and spathe and cut as high up as it remains of a uniform thickness, is made into chocks, the upper and tapering part being employed to form \"sirki\". The thin stalk-ends arranged side by side are bound together with grass, forming a species of matting, which, besides being employed for the ordinary purpose of giving shelter to carts, etc., is also used for thatching. The sheaths and spathe when reduced to shreds supply a material much used in making strings and ropes. This string or twine is reported to be of excellent quality and cheap; while the rope, which is very strong, is employed for rigging boats, and as a tow line on the Punjab rivers, as it does not deteriorate by being kept constantly wet. It is also used for Persian wheels and well ropes. The refuse yields a paper stuff, from which a very fair, almond-coloured, paper has been made; and as the grass grows in abundance and thickly everywhere, especially in Upper India, it may be said to supply an almost unlimited stock of stuff for paper-making; in fact, all the species of Saccharum are more or less adapted for the manufacture of paper.\n\nBAMBUS.\n\nThe various varieties of the bambu, such as Dendrocalamus strictus, Arundinaria Wightiana, Bambusa arundinacea, etc., are to be met with wild or cultivated in almost every part of India growing to an enormous height of 60-70 ft. and even more in moist alluvial lands, and near places where water is abundant. They propagate themselves by throwing outshoots, of which a single bambu produces as many as 10 to 20 a year. Three-fourths of these might be cut down each year without causing injury to, or bringing about the death of the parent shoot, which can thus be made to reproduce itself for many successive years.\n\nThe uses of the bambu are multifarious and too well known. Leaving every one of these aside, the grass is one that has latterly attracted considerable attention as a substitute for the esparto and alpha grasses in the manufacture of paper. Experiments conducted by Mr. Routledge, a well-known name in connection with the paper trade, tend to show that, in economy of production and quality, no other article approaches the bambu as a source of paper-supply, and its rapid growth establishes it at once as furnishing an unfailing supply of raw material. Another advantage which the bambu possesses is that being an endogen, it does not call for any elaborate manipulation such as that which is needed in exogenous plants, to separate the fibre from the woody stem-bark and other extractive matters; all that is required being to crush the sufficiently young bambus, previously split into halves, between proper rollers, dry them of their moisture, of which they hold between 60 to 75 per\ncent., and pack them for export or local use. An acre of ground which yields about 40 tons of stems can thus be made to represent 10 tons of dried produce. The stem proper for crushing are such as have, at least, one full season's growth, as in the very young ones the fibre is not sufficiently mature, and in old ones it is much too woody. The crushed material prepared in the manner just described only requires soaking down and bleaching to fit it for pulping and conversion into paper.\n\nThe best variety of bamboo for paper manufacture is that which grows the fastest and has the longest space between the joints. These joints have to be removed and rejected; hence the greater their number the greater the wastage. In planting the bamboos they ought to be sown close, so as to make the stem shoot upwards, thus securing a finer fibre with longer joints.\nDYES.\n\nIn the Bombay Presidency the vegetable kingdom yields a good many dyes. Some of these and the modes of fixing them are pretty generally known; certain remote villages, however, produce dyes which are not met with, and the methods for fixing which are not understood elsewhere.\n\nBIXINE\u00c6.\n\n*Bixa orellana*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl 5: *Kisri, sendri*.\n\nA native of South America, naturalized in India.\n\nThe pulp covering the seed contains the dye known under the name of *arnotto*. This dye is orange-red, and is obtained as follows. The pods are macerated for a week or more in boiling water, the seeds extracted, and the pulp left to subside. The liquor is then passed through sieves into proper vessels, and again boiled till it throws up a sort of scum, which holds the colouring matter. This scum, which is carefully removed from time to time, is now subjected to a further process of boiling, until it acquires sufficient consistence to be manipulated into balls or cakes, in which state the dye is fit for sale or the dyer's use. A better process, and one that is certainly less injurious to those engaged in the manufacture of this article, consists in washing the seeds of arnotto, on the surface of which the colour lies, thoroughly, and precipitating the colour by means of vinegar or lemon juice. This precipitate might then be removed and manipulated as already explained.\n\nArnotto does not appear to be much used in dyeing silk and woollen fabrics; on cotton, however, several beautiful shades are produced from it. In Sambalpur, in the Central Provinces, cotton cloths are dyed with it of a nice salmon colour, which, however, is not fast, and does not stand many washings. In Assam it produces a fleeting yellow. It is said that by the use of alkaline mordants the colour might be fixed on silk and wool. Several other uses are made of arnotto. It is employed, for example, to give butter, cheese, oils, etc., a yellow tinge, and milkmen sometimes colour buffalo milk with it to pass it for cow milk.\n\nTAMARISCINE\u00c6.\n\n*Tamarix gallica* or *T. Indica*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 100. *Jhau, lai*.\n\nA small tree or tall shrub common in Sind, Cutch, throughout India, Ceylon and Burma on the banks of rivers; also in Africa and Southern Europe.\nT. dioica, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 102. Sarru, laljhau, pichula.\n\nA small tree common in the beds of rivers in the Deccan and Konkan, and found from Sind and the Punjab to Assam and Burma.\n\nT. articulata, Hook Fl. Ind. i. 249.\n\nCommon in Sind, Punjab, etc.\n\nThe galls of all the above varieties are known as m\u00e1y or barri m\u00e1y, and are produced by the puncture of an insect which generally burrows in the branchlets. They are not used as dyes by themselves, but are employed as a mordant by tanners, calico-printers and dyers. Madder-dyed cloths have the colour fixed through their agency. Prepared with salts of iron these galls are employed to dye black.\n\nGUTTIFER\u00c6.\n\nGarcinia purpurea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 31. Kokam.\n\nThe acid juice is used as a mordant by people working in iron.\n\nG. xanthochymus, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 269.\u2014X. pictorius, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 31. Tamal, dampel.\n\nFrom the full-grown, but not ripe, fruit a quantity of creamy, resinous, yellow, gum-like gamboge is obtained which makes a tolerably fair water colour which might be used either by itself or to mix with blue to form green. The water dissolves a larger quantity of gum if a little alkaline salt be added to it.\n\nG. Cambogia, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 621.\n\nThe fruit, like that of the preceding, yields a yellow juice, an inferior sort of gamboge.\n\nOchrocarpus longifolius or Calysaccion longifolium Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 32 Suringe.\n\nThe tree grows in Kal\u00e1dgi, Shol\u00e1pur and Belgaum districts where its bark and root are used, and also exported to Ahmednagar for colouring red. Enormous quantities of this dye are used in Surat and Kaira also. It was believed by some that nagkesar (the flower buds) was employed for dyeing silk; but this is doubtful.\n\nBURSERACE\u00c6\n\nGarruga pinnata, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 312. Kurak.\n\nMELIACE\u00c6.\n\nMelia azadirachta, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 36. Nim.\n\nCedrela toona. Tun.\n\nThe white fragrant flowers boiled in water till one-fourth of the latter has evaporated, yields a yellow dye into which the cloth is simply dipped, and then squeezed to give it a fleeting yellow colour. Various shades ranging from light to deep yellow are thus produced, the mordant sometimes employed with them being alum. A red dye is obtained from the seeds. A sulphur yellow is sometimes\nproduced by mixing tyn flowers (*C. toona*) 4 oz., with turmeric 2 oz., lime 2 oz., and acidulated water.\n\n**RHAMNACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Zizyphus jujuba*, Dalz. & Gibs.

Fl. 52. *Biba, bilambi.*\n\nThis is used for producing a black colour which is not removed even by alkalies. It is, however, a caustic, and has, therefore, to be mixed with various other substances to modify its action.\n\n**LEGUMINOS\u00c6.**\n\n*Indigofera tinctoria*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 59. *Nib.*\n\nA shrub, 4-6 ft. high, faintly silvery white. Leaves pinnated, 1-2 in. long; leaflets 9-13 oblong ovate, turning blackish when dried. Flowers reddish-yellow. Legumes 1 in. long, approximated towards the base of the peduncle, slightly curved upwards.\n\nFound wild in the Konkan and elsewhere, but generally cultivated, especially in Bengal, North-West Provinces and Madras, on account of the indigo it yields.\n\nThe blue dye indigo is too well known to require any description, and various methods are employed for extracting it, all of which, generally speaking, consist in macerating the leaves in water and oxidising the liquid by agitation and exposure to the air.\n\nIndigo by itself produces a fast dye; but every colour in the production of which it enters, is not necessarily fast, the fastness of the colour depending upon the nature of the other dyes used. Several shades are produced by the agency of indigo, such as blue in all its shades and blends, and various blends of green; the dye first applied giving the prevailing tint.\n\nAll sorts of textile fabrics can be dyed by the agency of indigo. Mordants, properly so called, are not needed to fix the colour if simple blue is used; whenever such are employed, their action is called into requisition for the purpose of clearing the colour. The native method of dyeing blue consists in simply dipping the cloth into a solution of indigo and then squeezing it, and allowing it to dry. The oftener the cloth is dipped into the liquid, the deeper the shade of colour produced.\n\nTwo other plants described elsewhere produce a sort of indigo, viz., *Wrighta tinctoria* and *Orosophora plicata*.\nButea frondosa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 71. Pallas.\n\nThe bright scarlet flowers of this tree, infused either fresh or dry in water holding alum, or alum and tartar in solution, are employed for dyeing; a beautiful bright yellow. The dye known in Gujar\u00e1t as kissu may be extracted by simply pressing the flowers when fresh, or boiling them when dry in a weak solution of lime-water, but it is not permanent.\n\nFrom wounds in the bark a ruby-coloured astringent gum exudes, which loses colour by exposure, but it may be preserved by the gum being closely locked up in a bottle.\n\nB. superba, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 71. Pallas yel.\n\nA gigantic climber; leaflets membranous, the terminal 6-20 in. long, lateral oblique, smaller. Flowers orange-coloured, larger than those of the preceding, in racemes 1 ft. long.\n\nFound in Northern Konkan, Circ\u00e1r mountains, Travancore, Bengal, Oude, North-West Provinces, Burma, Pegu, etc.\n\nA yellow dye is obtained from the flowers, and from incisions in the bark a kino-like substance exudes.\n\nPetrocarpus santalinus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl.\n\nThe wood contains a red colouring matter, called santalin, which, though insoluble in water, is readily dissolved out by the alkalies producing a lasting dye. For dyeing cloth, however, a decoction of the wood is prepared into which the cloth is dipped. In Europe the dye-stuff is employed by pharmacists as a colouring agent, and also for dyeing leather red.\n\nC\u00e6salpinia coriana, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 27. Libi.\n\nThis beautiful tree, indigenous in the West Indies and Central America, was introduced into India by Dr. Wallich, and is now cultivated in Bombay, Poona and elsewhere. The pod contains a large quantity of tannin which is a valuable material for tanning. The average yearly produce from a single tree in the West Indies is said to be 100 lbs.\n\nC. sappan, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 27. Bakkam, patang.\n\nThe wood, broken into chips and boiled, yields a red dye which in the dry state is called gul\u00e1l, and is imported into Bombay from R\u00e1j\u00e1pur. In R\u00e1j\u00e1pur it is prepared from wood imported from the Malabar Coast. Some of the dye imported into Bombay finds its way to N\u00e1sik, where it is used for dyeing cotton thread. To dye cloth, the wood has to be soaked in water with lac and alum for two days and then boiled. This sappan decoction gives a fast colour. In the North-West Provinces sappan wood is employed in calico-printing.\n\nCassia auriculata, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 81. Tarwar.\n\nC. tora, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 81. Tacla.\n\nThe seeds of this plant are used in dyeing with indigo, their action being supposed to be that of starch in the indigo solution,\nDyes.\n\n**Acacia Arabica**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 86. *Babul.*\n\nThis tree yields catechu, or *kath* as it is called by the natives. Kath produces various shades of brown, and is also employed as a mordant in conjunction with other colouring stuffs. It is also eaten by the natives with *pan* and betel-nut.\n\nFor preparing catechu, after the proper tree has been selected, cut down, and the wood broken to pieces, boil the pieces in water till it assumes a port-wine colour, and set the water to cool. Hang a quantity of leaves or twigs into this water, and the catechu will coagulate on them.\n\n*A. suma*, *A. catechu*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 86. Also *A. sundra*.\n\nAll these produce catechu, and are used in much the same way and for the same purposes as the preceding.\n\n**Albizia procera**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby.

Fl. 91. *Ain.*\n\n*T. paniculata*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. *Kinjal.*\n\nAll the above species are more or less employed in dyeing. *T. catappa* is the Indian almond tree, the astringent bark and leaves of which yield in combination with salts of iron a black pigment from which Indian ink is made, and with which the natives sometimes colour their teeth.\n\nThe nut of *T. bellerica* also furnishes ink, and besides its medicinal use is employed in tanning and dyeing cloth and leather.\n\nThe *hird\u00e1* is by far the most important of the *terminalias*. The bark is boiled, and the decoction employed as a mordant in dyeing, as also for curing or tanning leather. The fruits are used to make ink. Mixed with alum they produce a very durable yellow dye which is much esteemed by chintz-painters and carpet-weavers. An equally good black dye is produced by acting upon the fruits with mud containing iron, and this dye is used by harness-makers as well as by dyers. The outer coat of the fruit produces with ferric sulphate a fine durable black colour, as does also the nut enclosed in it. This last mentioned is extensively used in ink-making, tanning and dyeing, and large quantities of it are annually exported from this country.\nThe barks of the remaining two *terminalias* also contain tannin, and both are employed in dyeing black. The fruits of both varieties are myrabalans.\n\n**MYRTACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Eugenia jambolana* vel *Syzygium jambolanum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 93. *Jambul.*\n\n**MELASTOMACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Memecylon edule*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 93. *Anjan.*\n\nA large shrub; branches round. Leaves ovate or oblong, 1-2 in. long, green and shining above, paler underneath, 1-nerved. Peduncles axillary, and below the leaves in older branches bearing an umbel-like cluster of small flowers of a beautiful purple. Fruit globose, smooth, about 3-4 lines diam., crowned by the 4-toothed limb of the calyx.\n\nVery common everywhere in the gh\u00e2ts and plains.\n\nAn infusion of the leaves in cold water yields a yellow colouring matter which becomes deep-red with the addition of myrabalans and sappan wood. Both dyes are employed in giving colour to cloths and mats.\n\n*Melastoma Malabaricum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 92.\n\nA shrub about 3 ft. high, more or less clothed with hairs or bristles; branches 4-angled, ultimate ones compressed. Leaves elliptic-oblong, 3-6 in. long. Flowers usually about 5-11 in terminal cymes, rose-coloured, handsome, large. Fruit nearly globular, small. Seeds embedded in a purple pulp.\n\nFound in Southern Konkan. The fruit is eatable, and yields a purple dye used for cotton-cloths.\n\n**LYTHRACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Woodfordia floribunda* vel *Grislea tomentosa*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 97. *Dhauri, dhayati.*\n\nA shrub. Leaves 2-4 in. long, lanceolate, hoary underneath, and having numerous small black glands. Flowers in axillary clusters, handsome red.\n\nCommon in our gh\u00e2ts. From the leaves and twigs a yellow colouring matter is extracted, used sometimes by calico-printers; the petals furnish a red dye which does not appear to be known outside of India.\n\n*Lawsonia alba (inermis)*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 97. *Mendi.*\n\nThis very common plant yields an orange-red dye which is easily obtained by macerating the leaves in water; mixed with alum this colour becomes permanent. It is employed for dyeing cloths, and forms a hair-restorer, the addition of indigo being needed to make the hair black. The triturated leaf is employed for staining red the nails, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Acids destroy the colour.\n\n*Lagerstr\u00e6mia parviflora*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 98. *Nana bondaroh.*\nPunica granatum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 34. Dalim, anar.\n\nThe rind of the fruit, particularly the wild one, boiled in water until the latter is reduced to one-fourth, yields a green decoction into which the cloth has to be simply dipped to colour it. But it is as a mordant that the rind is more generally used, being for this purpose always boiled along with the other dye with which it is employed.\n\nA light-red dye is obtained from the flowers, which, however, does not seem to be much used. The bark is said by some to be useful for tanning, and to be employed in dyeing Morocco leather.\n\nRUBIACE\u00c6.\n\nHymenidictyon excelsum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 117. Karwah.\n\nMorinda citrifolia; M. tinctoria and their varieties; M. bracteata; M. tomentosa; M. exerta, etc.\u2014Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 114. Aal, bartundi, madar.\n\nWild and cultivated in Bombay, Madras and throughout India.\n\nThe barks of all the above varieties yield a beautiful red dye which is obtained by bruising and boiling them in water; the root bark produces the best dye, with which alum is generally employed as a fixing agent. A bright yellow colour is said to be prepared from the wood in Bengal. In Ahmednagar a scarlet dye is obtained from the root bark, and is used for dyeing handkerchiefs, turbans, etc. It is also used to mix with other more expensive red dyes employed in colouring cloth and yarn. The red thread of carpet-makers is entirely dyed with it. In Madras turbans are coloured with this agent.\n\nRubia cordifolia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 121. Manjet, madar.\n\nThis yields a colour that is much brighter, though not so durable as the madder of Europe. Being, however, very expensive, its use is entirely restricted to Farakabad and Bareilly.\n\nCOMPOSIT\u00c6.\n\nCarthamus tinctorius, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 45. Kassumba, safflower.\n\nCultivated throughout India for the sake of the oil which is extracted from the seeds, and the dye obtained from the flowers. To obtain the dye the flowerets are gathered immediately on opening without being allowed to expand fully, and dried in the shade. After they are dry, water is poured over them, and they are made into lumps. These lumps are next placed on a mat-strainer, and a man treads them with his feet while water is slowly poured over the pulpy mass. The result of this process is the removal of the yellow colouring matter (which runs down) from the flowers, while the residual mass, which is made out into flat circular cakes and dried in the sun, constitutes the safflower of commerce.\nSafflower is used to dye silk and cotton cloths in nearly every part of India. It yields a number of shades of red, such as pink, scarlet, crimson, and is employed with other ingredients to produce the various series of oranges, purples, mauves, etc. All these colours are, however, very fleeting, and will not stand any washing, unless fixed by some mordants. The mordants more generally employed are the berry of *Ziziphus jujuba* and the carbonate of soda. The best safflower is said to be that from Dacca; that procured in Bombay is inferior.\n\nThe cultivation of the *Carthamus tinctorius* is very expensive and unremunerative if carried out by itself; it is, therefore, almost always grown as a subordinate crop along with barley, gram, etc., to which last the cultivator looks for his profits.\n\n**Tagetes patula**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 46. *Gul-jufri*, French marigold.\n\nCultivated extensively for the sake of the flowers, which are used by the natives in their temples, and worn in garlands by women round the neck and head. The flowers yield a yellow dye of inferior quality used by the poorer classes of some parts of India for dyeing their coarse cloths. The dye is extracted by soaking the flowers in water and squeezing them with the hands.\n\n**STYRACE\u00c6.**\n\n**Symplocos racemosa** vel **Hopea racemosa**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 140. *Lodhra, lodh*.\n\nCommon at Mah\u00e1baleshvar and other gh\u00e1ts.\n\nFrom the bark and leaves a yellow dye is extracted, which is used for mixing with madder. Its action appears, however, to be more that of a mordant than of a pure colouring agent, and, as such, it is used by the calico-printers and dyers in Calcutta.\n\nAn allied species\u2014*S. paniculata*\u2014found in the Himalayas yields a brownish or dark-bluish colour.\n\n**OLEINE\u00c6.**\n\n**Nyctanthes arbortristis**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 51. *Parijatak*.\n\nThe flower stalks yield a fine, but fleeting, buff or orange colour. To extract the dye the dried flowers are boiled in water, 1 lb. of flowers requiring 10 gallons of water, which are evaporated till only one gallon is left; the cloth is then dipped into the liquor and hung out to dye. Five yards of muslin can thus be dyed with 1 lb. of flowers. Silk also takes the colour very well.\n\nBut, besides being used by itself, the dye is often compounded with red, and produces rich flame, orange and salmon colours.\n\nThe bark is employed for tanning.\n\n**APOCYNACE\u00c6.**\n\n**Wrightia tinctoria**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 145. *Kala-kuda*.\nDyes.\n\nFrom the leaves and young shoots a blue dye\u2014indigo\u2014is extracted.\n\nW. tomentosa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 145. Kala-inderjao.\nThe remarks about the foregoing apply to this also.\n\nBORAGINE\u00c6.\n\nCordia myxa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 173. Bhokar, bargund.\nIt is said that in Otaheite the juice of the leaves is used in dyeing.\n\nBIGNONIACE\u00c6.\n\nOuroxylon Indicum vel Calosanthes Indica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 161. Tintun.\nThe bark and fruit are used in dyeing and tanning.\n\nACANTHACE\u00c6.\n\nAdhatoda vasica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 194. Adussa.\nThe leaves yield a more or less durable yellow colour which is used by some people to dye coarse cloths with. Mixed with indigo a beautiful dark blue-green is obtained. The colour is obtained by boiling the leaves in water (10 lbs. to 16) slowly for a long time till half the water has evaporated.\n\nVERBENACE\u00c6.\n\nTectona grandis, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 199. Sal.\nAvicenia officinalis, Brand. For. Fl. 371.\n\nEUPHORBIACE\u00c6.\n\nEuphorbia Tirucalli, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 76. Nival.\nCommon in hedges.\nThis is not a dye-producing plant properly so called, but the ashes of the burnt plant are used as an alkali in dyeing in certain parts of India, principally in Southern India.\n\nJatropha curcas, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 77. Jepal.\nThe oil extracted from the seeds and boiled with oxide of iron often forms a varnish used in China for covering boxes (Lindley).\n\nMallotus Philippinensis vel Rottlera tinctoria, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 230. Shendri, kapela, kamala.\nThe bark of the tree is used for tanning.\nThe reddish-yellow powder which covers the ripe fruit is brushed off and collected, and wants very little preparation before being used; all that is needed being to mix it with water holding in solution half its weight of carbonate of soda. Silk dipped into this takes a fine yellow colour, and cotton cloths may also be similarly dyed. Alcohol and ether dissolve the colouring matter with facility. The dye is in some places mixed with other substances to produce various shades of red, orange and brown. In Ahmedabad a deep orange colour is produced by mixing it with lime water, alum and turmeric or safflower.\nBriedelia retusa, B. montana, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 233. Phatarphod, assana.\n\nCrosophora plicata, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 232.\n\nAn annual, erect, hoary plant, common in Bombay, Deccan and Gujarat.\n\nThe juice of the green capsules imparts to wet cloth a beautiful blue colour similar to that of indigo.\n\nPhyllanthus emblica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Aola.\n\nPreticulatus Anisonema multiflora, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 234. Kalla Mahomed.\n\nA large climbing shrub with numerous twiggy branches; floriferous branches angular. Leaves about 1 in. long, ovate, membranous. Flowers aggregated, axillary, several males and 1 or 2 females in a cluster; of a purplish colour. Berry succulent, somewhat depressed, size of a pea, dark-purple. Very common. Ink is sometimes made from the fruit.\n\nURTICACE\u00c6.\n\nArtocarpus integrifolia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 244. Phanas.\n\nA. Lakoocha, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 244. Watamb.\n\nMYRICE\u00c6.\n\nCasuarina equisetfolia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 82\n\nThe bark contains tannin.\n\nA dye was prepared from it some years ago and shown at the Madras Exhibition of 1855. It gave a reddish nankeen with alum, and with iron a black colour. Exposure to the air also produced a stable nankeen red.\n\nSCITAMINE\u00c6.\n\nCurcuma longa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 87. Halad.\n\nBesides being used in various religious ceremonies, in medicine, and as a condiment by the natives, the tubers of turmeric are employed as a colouring agent by dyers throughout India, being used either by itself or with other dyes to produce various shades of yellow and other colours. The colouring agent is curcumin, which is freely taken up by ether and alcohol, and which is changed to a deep red or brown by alkalies. The colour of turmeric is not always fast, even when used with mordants; still it is extensively employed in dyeing, not only cotton cloths, but also silk and woollen fabrics,\u2014carbonate of soda and alum being the mordants more generally used along with it.\nGUMS AND RESINS.\n\nBIXINE\u00c6.\n\nCochlospermum Gossypium, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 90. Kumbi, kathalya.\n\nA small tree, trunk erect. Leaves scattered about the ends of branchlets, palmately 3-5-lobed, 3-8 in. long. Flowers golden-yellow, 4-5 in diam. Capsules oval, nearly the size of a goose-egg, 5-valved; seeds numerous, enveloped in a soft silky wool.\n\nDeccan, but planted everywhere. It yields the kuteera gum used as a substitute for tragacanth. The cotton is of no value, except for stuffing pillows. The timber is soft, and only used as firewood.\n\nANACARDIACE\u00c6.\n\nSpondias mangifera, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 19. Ambara, rhan amb.\n\nA small tree. Leaves near the extremities of branches, 1-1\u00bd ft. long; leaflets 4-6 pair, 2-9 in. long by 1-4 in. broad. Flowers small, greenish-white in long panicles. Drupe ovoid, 1\u00bd-2 in. long, yellow when ripe; kernel tough, fibrous outside.\n\nWild, and cultivated throughout India. It yields an insipid gum. The ripe fruit has an astringent acid taste, and is eaten, while the raw one is pickled. The wood is soft and brittle, and only used as fuel.\n\nBombax Malabaricum. Saur, saer.\n\nSterculia villosa.

Bby. Fl. 34, 35. *Rhita*.\n\nThe fruit when rubbed with water has the property of making the latter soapy, and is extensively used for cleaning cloths, boards, etc.\n\nThe fruit of *S. Mukorossi*, described by Roxb. ii. 280 under the name of *S. detergens*, said to be wild in Kumaon and Silhet and cultivated throughout the North-West Provinces and Bengal, is saponaceous, and is used for the same purpose. It is said that the fruit of *Dittelasma rarak*, belonging to the same order and described by Loureiro, as *Sapindus saponaria*, is also saponaceous.\n\n*Acacia Arabica*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 86.\n\nA decoction of the bark is a substitute for soap.\n\n*Acacia concinna*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 87. *Sikhakai*.\n\nA large climber. Branchlets, petioles and peduncles grey-downy and armed with numerous, minute, recurved prickles. Petiole 3-4 in. long with a large gland below the first pair of pinnae, and 1 between the uppermost pair; pinnae 12-16, 2-3 in. long; leaflets 30-50, \u00bc-\u00bd in.; membranous, linear, sensitive; with an oblique mid-rib, glabrescent, stipules large, cordate-ovate. Flower bud purple; flowers yellow in globose heads \u00bc-\u00bd in. diameter arranged in racemose panicles. Pod thick, succulent, straight, when dry shrivelled, 3-4 in. by \u00be-1 in. long, 6-10-seeded, slightly contracted between the seeds.\n\nThis shrub is common over the gh\u00e2ts and in the plains. The pod is very much used as a substitute for soap.\n\n*Randia dumetorum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 119. *Ghela*.\n\nCommon everywhere.\n\nThe fruit is used instead of soap by the hill-people, but is said to destroy cloths.\n\nWATER-CLEARING NUT.\n\n*Strychnos potatorum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 156. *Nirmali*.\n\nThe seeds are used for clearing muddy water: they are rubbed on the sides of the earthen vessel containing the muddy water; within a short time the mud subsides, leaving the water clean.\nAt a time when filters were not in use, and means of communication difficult, Europeans also resorted to this mode of clearing water.\n\n**Phyllanthus emblica**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl.\n\nChips of the wood thrown into muddy water assist in clearing it. The wood of this tree is frequently used for well-curbs, etc.\nMEDICINAL PLANTS.\n\nThere are in the Konkan numerous medicinal plants, some of which possess very active properties, and are officinal in the Indian Pharmacopoeia. A few shall be mentioned here, arranged in groups according to their properties.\n\nPURGATIVES.\n\nArgemone Mexicana.\n\nThe oil acts as a mild laxative in $\\frac{1}{2}$-drachm doses. (See Chapter on Oils.)\n\nCassia fistula, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 80.\n\nCommon in the hilly parts of the Konkan, and also planted. The part used is the pulp, in 1 to 2 drachm doses. It acts as a mild purgative, and briskly in 1 to 2 oz. doses.\n\nCassia alata, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 29. Dad-mardun.\n\nA handsome shrub with long pinnate leaves, conspicuous, erect racemes of yellow flowers and winged pod. Found in gardens. The parts used are the leaves; a tincture of the dry leaves acts in the same way as senna, and the extract from fresh leaves is analogous in its action to colocynth.\n\nThe leaves of C. sophora; C. occidentalis (hikal); and C. tora (takla),\u2014all very common, are used by natives as mild laxatives.\n\nClitoria ternatea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 68. Gokarna mul.\n\nStem twining. Leaflets 2-3 pair. Flowers large, blue or white. Legume linear, compressed, straight, many-seeded.\n\nVery common in hedges and cultivated in gardens. The seeds of this elegant plant possess purgative properties; they are roasted, powdered and administered in drachm doses. Dr. Dymock advises the administration in combination with twice their bulk of acid tartrate of potash. The root has purgative and diuretic properties assigned to it.\n\nTamarindus Indicus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 80.\n\nThe pulp of the fruit. (See Chapter on Timber Trees.)\n\nCitrullus colocynthis, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 101. Bitter cucumber or colocynth plant; kaddu kankri, indrayeen.\n\nFound in the Deccan, Gujarat and sparsely in the Konkan. From the fruit of this plant compound extract of colocynth was formerly prepared in large quantities at Hewra for the supply of the medical stores. It is\na hydragogue cathartic. The dose of the pulp is from 2 to 8 grs., that of the compound extract from 3 to 10 grs., and of the compound pill from 5 to 10 grs.\n\n**Cucumis trigonus**, Dalz & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 103. *Kavitha*; also called *indrayeen*.\n\nCommon in the Deccan. The bitter pulp of the fruit of this plant is said to possess the purgative properties of the last.\n\n**Ipomoea hederacea**, D. C. Prod. ix. 343 and 344. Generally known as *pharbitis nil*; *kala dana*.\n\nA tall herbaceous twiner. Leaves 1\u00bd-4 in. long, broadly cordate, more or less 3-5-lobed, the middle one larger. Flowers blue or purple, often about 2 in. long.\n\nCommon throughout India and cultivated in gardens on account of its flowers. The officinal parts are the seeds (*kala dana*), which are a safe cathartic, and form a good substitute for jalap in doses of from 30 to 50 grs. (powdered seeds). The officinal preparations are:\u2014Extract of seeds given in from 5 to 10 grs. doses in the form of pills; tincture of *kala dana*, 2 to 3 drachms; compound powder of *kala dana* in from 50 to 60 grs.; and resin of *kala dana* in from 5 to 8 grs doses.\n\n**I. turpethum**, Dalz. & Gibs.

Also called *jamalgota*.\n\nShrubby. Upper leaves lanceolate, lower ones broader, often lobed. Spikes axillary, about the length of the petioles. Flowers yellowish; female ones at the base. Capsul sub-globose, hispid; seeds smooth, marbled.\n\nFound on the hills of Karanja. One powdered seed is the dose generally administered to produce cathartic effects.\n\n**Jatropha curcas**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 77. *Jampal*, *jepal*.\nIs common everywhere.\n\nThe oil expressed from the seeds is colourless or pale-yellow, and acts as a purgative in 12 to 15 drop doses.\n\nEMETICS.\n\nBrassica campestris var. Napus.\u2014B. juncea, Hook. Fl. Ind. i. 156 and 157.\n\nThe mustard plant cultivated in India. A tea spoonful or more of the powdered seeds mixed with water is given as an emetic in cases of drunkenness, and when it is desired to empty the stomach without causing depression of the system.\n\nBarringtonia acutangula, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 95. Samundarphal.\n\nThe powdered fruit is given as an emetic; dose \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 1 fruit. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nRandia dumetorum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 119.\n\nThe fruit well bruised and mixed with water is administered to produce vomiting. The dose is one fruit. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nTylophora asthmathica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 150. Anthamul.\n\nTwining; branches slender. Leaves 2-3 in. long, ovate-roundish, pointed, cordate at the base. Flowers rather large, long-pedicelled, externally pale-greenish with a tinge of purple, internally light purple; divisions of corolla acute.\n\nCommon. Officinal part, the dried leaves which have a very disagreeable smell when bruised, and a nauseous taste. Dose as an emetic 25-30 grs. of the powder of the dried leaves conjoined with \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) gr. or a grain of tartar emetic. The powdered leaves are also given in catarrh, dysentery, fevers and in cases where ipecacuanha is generally employed. The root of this plant, found in the h\u00e2z\u00e2rs in the form of thick contorted pieces of a pale colour and a bitterish nauseous taste, has also emetic and diaphoretic properties, and is given in dysentery, etc. The natives bray on a stone \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) in. of the root, and administer the paste with a little water.\n\nAsclepias curassavica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 54.\n\nAn herbaceous, erect-growing plant cultivated in every garden. Leaves linear lanceolate, resembling those of Nerium oleander. Flowers of a reddish-orange colour in terminal umbels.\n\nThe root dried and reduced to powder is administered in the West Indies as an emetic in doses of from 20 to 40 grs.: hence the name bastard or wild ipecacuanha.\n\nCrinum Asiaticum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 275. Nagdaun.\n\nStemless. Leaves lanceolate, 3-4 ft. long, 5-7 in. broad. Scapes axillary, shorter than the leaves, a little compressed. Flowers 12-50 in an umbel, white, said to be fragrant at nights. Berries the size of a peacock's head.\n\nCommon in the Konkan and cultivated in gardens. Officinal part, the fresh root. Preparations:\u2014Juice of crinum, dose from 2 to 4 fl. drachms; syrup of crinum, dose about 2 fl. drachms.\nBoerhaavia diffusa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 213.\u2014Punarnav\nand Daemia extensa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 150. Uttarani or utarani.\n\nAre used as emetics.\n\nANTHELMINTICS.\n\nMelia azadirachta, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 36.\n\nThe root bark of this tree is administered as an anthelmintic in\nthe form of decoction (4 ozs. of fresh root bark, water 2 pints, boiled\ndown to a pint). The dose for a child is a table spoonful repeated\nevery third hour, until the bowels or stomach are sensibly affected.\nSome doctors prefer giving a dose twice a day for several successive\ndays, and then administering an active purgative. In larger doses\nit is said to produce narcotic symptoms.\n\nMucuna pruriens, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 70. Cowhage,\ncowitch.\n\nAn annual; branches hairy. Leaflets ovate, silvery beneath, \u00bd-\u00be ft.\nlong. Racemes drooping, \u00bd-1 ft. long; flowers purplish. Pod 2-3\nin. long, 5-6-seeded, shaped like the letter S, turgid, clothed with\ntawny stinging hairs.\n\nCommon everywhere in hedges. The hairs are administered for the\nexpulsion of round worms in the form of an electuary made with honey.\nA tea spoonful is given for a dose to a child and a table spoonful to\nan adult for 3 or 4 successive mornings, followed by a purgative. Applied\nto the skin, the hairs produce intolerable itching.\n\nButea frondosa, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 71.\n\nThe seeds of this tree are soaked in water, the testa carefully\nremoved, and the kernel dried and reduced to powder; 20 grs. of\nthis powder are given three times a day for three successive days\nfollowed by a dose of castor oil on the fourth. (See Timber Trees.)\n\nMangifera Indica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 51.\n\nPowdered mango seed is effectually administered in doses of 20\nto 30 grs.

The seeds\nare nauseous and bitter, and are administered, well bruised, for the ex-\npulsion of round worms in about 1\u00bd drachm doses made into an electuary\nwith honey. An infusion of the powdered seeds is also given. In some\nparts of India the powdered seeds made into a paste with lime juice are\nused to kill pediculi.\n\nPunica granatum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 34.\n\nThe root bark is very effectual in expelling tape worm. It is given in\nthe form of decoction, which is made by taking of fresh root bark, bruised,\n2 ozs., water 2 pints, boiled down to a pint. The mode of administration\nMedicinal Plants.\n\nis, 2 fl. ozs. are given before breakfast, and the same quantity repeated every \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) hour, until 6 doses have been taken; these are followed by an aperient. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**Mallotus Philippinensis**, Bedd. Fl. Sylv. 282.\u2014*Rottlera tinctoria*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. 230.\n\nThe powder is given in 2 to 3 drachm doses for the expulsion of tape worm. In these doses it acts on the bowels, causing in some cases considerable nausea and griping. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**Aristolochia bracteata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 224.\u2014*Kiramar*.\n\nPerennial plant trailing on the ground; stem about 12-15 in. long. Leaves kidney-shaped, whitish beneath. Flowers of a beautiful dark purple colour. Penduncles furnished at the base with a kidney-shaped curled bract.\n\nCommon all over India and kept in all houses in a dry state, and much appreciated on account of its anthelmintic properties. The whole plant is nauseously bitter. Two leaves bruised with water are given for a dose. The dry leaves are also administered in the form of infusion.\n\n**FEBRIFUGES.**\n\n**Adansonia digitata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 9. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**Melia azadirachta**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 36.\n\nOfficial preparations are:\u2014Decoction and tincture of the bark; the former is made by taking 2 ozs. of inner layer of the bark bruised; water 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pint, boiled for 15 minutes and strained when hot. Of this, 2 to 3 fl. ozs. are administered every second hour previous to the expected paroxysm. The tincture is made by macerating in a closed vessel 2\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) ozs. of the inner layer of *nim* bark in a pint of proof spirit for seven days with occasional agitation. Dose 2-3 fl. drachms. There is a belief among the natives that sleeping under this tree is effective in preventing a paroxysm of fever. Whether the tree has the same properties as *Eucalyptus globulus* and destroys the poison of malaria, is a point that requires further examination.\n\n**Soymida febrifuga**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 38. *Rohan, rohing*.\n\nIt is astringent, tonic and antiperiodic. The powdered bark is used in drachm doses three or four times before the expected paroxysm. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**Cedrela toona**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 38. *Tunna, tuni, limb*.\n\nThe bark of this tree is a powerful astringent and antiperiodic; the dose of the dry bark, about an ounce daily in the form of infusion. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**Caesalpinia bonducella**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 79. *Sagar-gotta*.\n\nThe seeds are tonic and antiperiodic; dose, 10 to 15 grs. Official preparation:\u2014Compound powder made of equal parts of seeds\npowdered after being deprived of their shells, and powdered black pepper; dose, 15 to 30 grs.\n\n**ASTRINGENTS USEFUL IN CASES OF DIARRH\u0152A AND DYSENTERY.**\n\n*Aegle marmelos*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 31.\n\nThe pulp of the fruit is very efficacious in arresting chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. Officinal preparations:\u2014Mixture, extract and liquid extract; but the best way of using it is making sherbet of the pulp of the ripe fruit, and taking it once or twice a day.\n\n*Adansonia digitata*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n*Punica granatum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 34.\n\nDecoction of the rind of the fruit (rind bruised 2 ozs. boiled down with a pint of water for 15 minutes in a covered vessel) is given in cases of diarrhoea and chronic dysentery in doses of from 1 to 1\u00bd fl. oz.\n\n*Eugenia jambolana*, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 484.\u2014*Syzygium jambolannum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 93.\n\nIts bark has very astringent properties, and is much used in the form of decoction. A syrup prepared from the juice of the ripe fruit is a very pleasant drink, and is administered in chronic diarrhoea with good success.\n\n*Mangifera Indica*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 51.\n\nPowdered seed acts as an effectual astringent in cases of diarrhoea in doses of from 20 to 30 grs. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n*Terminalia chebula*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 91.\n\nFruit and galls found on the leaves are given in diarrhoea. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n*Holarrhana antidysenterica*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 145. *Dawla kura*.\n\nThe bark, known as *conessee* bark or *codoga palla*, is used with great success in dysenteric affections in the form of decoction (bark 2 ozs., water 2 pints, boiled down to 1 pint). (See Timber Trees.)\n\n*Alstonia scholaris*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 145. *Satwin*. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n*Phyllanthus emblica*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 235. *Amla*. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n*Butea frondosa* (see Timber Trees) and *Pterocarpus marsupium*. (See Timber Trees). The gum (kino) of these trees is astringent.\n\n*Acacia catechu*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 86.\n\nThe extract of the wood of this tree is a powerful astringent. (See Timber Trees.) Baker in 'Hook. Fl. Ind.' describes this tree under *A. suma*.\nALTERATIVES.\n\nHydrocotyle Asiatica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. 105. *Bramee*, Indian penny-wort.\n\nA slender herbaceous plant, trailing on the ground. Leaves round, kidney-shaped. Umbels capitate, 2-3-flowered; flowers greenish-white. Fruit orbicular, reticulated with 4 ribs on each of the flat sides. Grows in moist shady places, near tanks and wells. The dried powdered leaves are used with good results in anesthetic leprosy, secondary syphilis and other cutaneous diseases, in from 5 to 8 grs. doses. Powdered leaves, either fresh or dried, are applied to indolent ulcers. Diuretic properties are also assigned to these leaves.\n\nEclipta prostrata, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 127. *Maka, bhangrahi*.\n\nA common weed belonging to the Order *Composite*, to be met with almost everywhere. Stem prostrate or ascending, rough with adpressed hairs. Leaves oblong; lanceolate, slightly serrated, rough. The heads of flowers white. The plant is used in the form of decoction in affections of the liver and spleen, and in dropsy. It is supposed to be a good substitute for taraxacum in hepatic affections. The expressed juice appears to be the best form of administration. The natives use the plant as pot herb.\n\nHemidesmus Indicus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 147. *Anantamul*, Mar.; *magrabu*, Hind.; *mackway*, Dec.; country sarsaparilla.\n\nSmall, twining plant. Leaves cordate, narrow, linear, pointed. Flowers pale-green on the outside, dark-blood-coloured inside. Follicles slender, straight.\n\nCommon everywhere. The root is the officinal part, and is esteemed as a valuable alterative tonic, diuretic and diaphoretic, being used in all cases in which sarsaparilla is employed. It is best given in the form of infusion (bruised root 1 oz., boiling water 10 ozs., infused in a covered vessel for an hour). Dose from 2-3 fl. ozs., thrice daily.\n\nCalotropis gigantea and C. procera, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 149.\n\nBoth the root and the milk of the stem are used in leprosy and other skin-diseases. *(See Fibrous Plants.)*\n\nHydnocarpus Wightiana, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 11.\n\nThe oil is used in leprosy. *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\nPongamia glabra, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 77.\n\nThe oil of the seeds is used in itch and other skin diseases. *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\nThespesia populnea, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 18. *Bhendi*.\n\nThe yellow viscid juice of the capsule is used in scabies, etc. *(See Timber Trees.)*\nSchleichera trijuga, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby: Fl. 35. *Kussan, kussim.*\n\nUsed in curing itch. *(See Timber Trees.)*\n\nFicus Bengalensis,* Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 240. *War, banyan tree, wad.*\n\nThe milky juice of this tree is applied with benefit to the troublesome cracks on the soles of the feet to which the natives are so liable.\n\n**TONICS.**\n\nAlmost all the medicines described as \"febrifuges\" are good and efficient tonics when used in smaller doses. It is believed that they act as antiparoidic by exercising a tonic influence on the stomach and improving the general health. They are not regarded to possess the same power, or act in the same way as quinine. Besides these, we have in India, and especially in the Konkan many other pure bitter tonics. A few will be enumerated here.\n\n*Tilnospora cordifolia*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 5. *Gul-vel, gulancha.*\n\nGrows in the Konkan and all over India. A climbing shrub, with scabrous corky bark, cordate leaves, small yellow flowers, and a berry the size of a cherry, red when ripe. It is a good tonic, given in cases of debility caused by repeated attacks of intermittent fever and enlargement of the spleen. The parts used are the root and the stem collected during hot season, when the bitter principle is most abundant.\n\nOfficinal preparations:\n\n*Tincture of gulancha*, dose 1 to 2 drachms, thrice daily.\n\n*Extract of gulancha*, dose 10 to 30 grs., thrice daily.\n\nThis corresponds to an impure extract prepared by the natives of Southern Maratha Country, and called *palo*, being used in doses of from 1 to 2 drachms.\n\n*Infusion of Gulancha.*\u2014(Gulancha cut small 1 oz., cold water 10 ozs.; macerate in a covered vessel for two hours, and strain). Dose from 1 to 3 ozs., thrice daily.\n\n*Ophelia chirata*. *Chiretta.*\n\nThis is a well-known plant, native of temperate Himalayas, whence it is brought to the plains; it is a pure tonic, extensively used in hospital and private practice.\n\nOfficinal preparations:\n\n*Tincture of Chiretta.*\u2014Dose 1 to 2 drachms, thrice daily.\n\n*Infusion of Chiretta.*\u2014(A quarter of an ounce infused in 10 ozs. of hot water in a covered vessel for half an hour). Dose 1 to 2 ozs., thrice daily.\n\n*The genera Urushigma and Covellia are united with Ficus,*\nThere are people who take a dose of this infusion every morning all the year round, in the belief that it prevents attacks of intermittent fever.\n\n**Ophelia multiflora**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 156. Also called *chiretta*, *k\u00e1rwi*.\n\nA small, herbaceous plant with quadrangular stem and white flowers; grows at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The dried stems and roots, sold in the b\u00e1zar, occur in pieces, about 2 inches long, of the thickness of a quill. It is an excellent substitute for officinal *chiretta*, and equal to it in effect.\n\n**Exacuum bicolor**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 156.\n\nPretty common in pasture grounds of the Konkan during the rains. It is worthy of a place in our gardens on account of its beautiful flowers. The Pharmacopoeia of India says that its dried stalks are sold in Southern India under the name of *country kariyat*. It possesses the same tonic and stomachic properties of gentian, and may, where procurable, be substituted for it.\n\n**Erithr\u00e6a Roxburghii**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 157. *Kuroo nai* or *kadav\u00ed nai*.\n\nAnother small, herbaceous plant with beautiful pink, star-like flowers, common in cultivated grounds after the rains. The whole plant is bitter like the other gentians, and is esteemed by the natives as a valuable tonic.\n\n**Eucostema (Hippion) orientalis**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 157.\n\nAnother gentian common in Gujar\u00e1t, though rare in the Konkan. Stem four-sided, leafy from the base; small white flowers. The bitterness of this plant is not so intense as that of chiretta, and approaches more nearly that of gentian. The natives of Gujar\u00e1t eat the herb pickled. It is said that it is much used by the natives of Madras as a stomachic, as, in addition to its tonic properties, it is also somewhat laxative.\n\n**Andrographis paniculata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 198. *Kiraita*, *kriat*, *kiraittem*, *karyat*.\n\nThis is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the order *Acanthace\u00e6* with quadrangular stem and beautiful white flowers. Officinal preparations are infusion and tincture. It is a bitter tonic and stomachic, analogous in action to quassia. It is much used in Southern Mar\u00e1tha countries and Southern Konkan (where it is confounded with officinal chiretta) in cases of general debility, especially of the stomach, during convalescence from fevers, in advanced stages of dysentery, etc.\n\n**Acorus Calamus**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 96. *Vakan*; sweet flag of the English.\n\nA common plant in moist places of India, Europe and America. The rhizome (root-stalk) has an aromatic bitter taste, and has been held in high esteem from the earliest ages as a good stomachic tonic.\nIts virtues reside in a volatile oil. The dried rhizome sold in the bazaar is of the thickness of the thumb, of various lengths, and covered with sheath-like scales. It is administered in cases of debility of the stomach, or dyspepsia attended with flatulence. Rubbed with spirits of cashew or any other spirit it is used as an efficient external application in sprains and chronic rheumatism. It is often rubbed for this purpose with equal parts of common extract of aloes. Internally it is best given in infusion (dried rhizomes, bruised, 1 oz.; boiling water 10 ozs.) in doses of 1\u00bd to 2 ozs. The natives administer it also in the form of powder in doses of from 20 to 40 grs. or more.\n\nThere are many oils minutely described elsewhere which are used medicinally. (See Chapter on Oils.)\nVEGETABLE POISONS.\n\nMENISPERMAC\u00c6.\n\nAnamirta cocculus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 4, Kakmari.\n\nThe seeds possess powerfully poisonous properties due to the presence of picrotoxin; 6 to 10 grains of them are stated to be sufficient to kill a dog. The symptoms produced are nausea, vomiting, tetanic convulsions, and finally insensibility. The chief use of the seeds is to poison fish, for which purpose they are mixed with rice and thrown into tanks and the stagnant water of rivers; the fish become stupefied, float on the water, and are thus easily taken. Though fish thus caught is thought to be poisonous, the natives eat it after repeatedly washing and cooking it. These seeds are officinal in the Pharmacopoeia of India, and enter as an ingredient in the preparation of an ointment used for the destruction of pediculi.\n\nCELASTRINE\u00c6.\n\nEl\u0153dendron Roxburghii, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 48. Tamruj.\n\nThe bark is said to be a virulent poison.\u2014Brand.\n\nANACARDIACE\u00c6.\n\nSemecarpus anacardium, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 52. Biba; marking nut.\n\nThe kernel of the seeds is eaten, but the pericarp is full of acrid juice which is collected and used for marking cloth. This juice is a powerful vesicant, and is also extensively used by the natives in the treatment of rheumatism, liver and other painful affections. It must, however, be employed with caution, as in certain constitutions it is apt to produce erysipelasous inflammation of the whole body, followed sometimes by death. It also causes deep ulceration and sloughing which has at times resulted fatally. Criminally it is applied to the os uteri to produce abortion.\n\nThe juice of the tree is so poisonous and acrid that people are afraid of cutting it, and they only do so after killing it by removing the bark. It is said that disagreeable consequences often result by even sleeping under the tree.\n\nLEGUMINOS\u00c6.\n\nLathyrus sativus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 22 Lings.\n\n(See Vegetables and Fruits, etc.)\nLYTHRACE\u00c6.\n\nAmmania baccifera, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 97. Daudmare (Bong.), jalmukhi.\n\nA small herb, 6 in. 2-ft. high, very common in cultivated ground during the rains. The leaves are very acrid, and are used by the natives to raise blisters, and as a counterirritant in rheumatic inflammations. The fresh leaves bruised and applied to the skin produce a blister within half an hour. It appears that the juice of the leaves mixed with cooked food has been often used as a poison; it produces extreme torments and acute suffering, with burning pain in the abdomen.\n\nSAMYDACE\u00c6.\n\nCasearia graveolens, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. ii. Moda (Mar.)\n\nIt is stated elsewhere that the fruit is used for killing fish. It is also believed that it acts as a poison upon men. An infusion of the leaves of C. ulmifera, named in Brazil \"marmeheiro do matto\", is given internally and also applied externally as a valuable remedy against the bites of serpents.\n\nCUCURBITACE\u00c6.\n\nMelothria Madraspatana, Cogn. in D. C. Prod. Cont.\u2014Muchia scabrella, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 100. Ghugri.\n\nThis cucurbit common in every hedge is hispid and scabrous all over; stem angular and berry globular, scarlet when ripe, size of a pea; seeds rugose.\n\nThe seeds are stated to be poisonous.\n\nLagenaria vulgaris, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 36. Tumbe, harrea kaddu; bottle-gourd.\n\nThe whole plant is of a musky scent, soft, downy. Leaves cordate, glaucous, with 2 glands at the base. Fruit smooth, bottle-shaped, yellow when ripe. In the wild state the fruit is poisonous, producing symptoms like those of cholera. Dr. Lindley says that some sailors were poisoned and died at one of the ports of England from drinking beer which was kept in a flask made of one of these gourds, and Dr. Royle states that he learnt from a respectable and intelligent native doctor attached to the jail hospital at Sharanpore that he had seen a case of poisoning from eating of the bitter pulp, in which the symptoms were those of cholera. The natives of the Deccan take advantage of the tough rind of the fruit for variety of purposes, and use the fruits as floats for crossing rivers. Four or five fruits are enough to support a man with a burden on his head.\n\nCOMPANULACE\u00c6.\n\nLobelia nicotian\u00e6folia, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 133. Darval, bokenal.\nThis is an elegant tall shrub with hollow stems, long sessile leaves and large white flowers. Common on our gh\u00e2ts. The seeds are said to be extremely acrid, and like those of the other species to contain an acro-narcotic poison, so much so that they are said to be preferred to datura when rapid effect is desired.\n\n**PLUMBAGINE\u00c6.**\n\n*Plumbago rosea*, Linn.\u2014*P. coccinea*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 71. *Lal-chitra*.\n\nA common shrub in the Southern Konkan and throughout India. The pounded root acts as a powerful vesicant, and a paste made from it is employed in rheumatism and other painful swellings of the joints, etc. It is also criminally employed to produce abortion, the scraped root-bark being introduced for this purpose into the os uteri. This is apt to result in inflammation of the uterus and the peritoneal cavity, and death. The action of the external application is often assisted by its internal administration. There are cases on record in which it has been used internally alone with criminal intention, and has resulted in death.\n\n*P. Zeylanica*, Dalz. & Gibs, Bby. Fl. 220. *Chitrack, chitra*.\n\nCommon in Gujar\u00e1t and the Konkan.\n\nIt is a shrubby plant, cultivated in gardens on account of its white flowers. The bark of its root is also poisonous and acrid.\n\n**APOCYNACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Nerium odorum*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 52. *Olean-der; kaner, ganira, karavera*.\n\nA large shrub indigenous to North-West and Central India, Sind and Afghanistan. Cultivated in gardens for the sake of its sweet-scented, rose-coloured, white or red flowers. All parts of this plant are more or less poisonous, the bark of the root being especially so. The bark is prescribed in leprosy and other cutaneous diseases by native doctors, but has also been used for criminal and suicidal purposes. Usually it acts by directly depressing the nervous system. A case has, however, been recorded in which well-marked tetanic symptoms followed its exhibition. The red flowers are a choice offering to Ganpatti. In some parts of the Mediterranean the root is employed to kill rats.\n\n*Thevetia neriifolia*, D. C. Prod. viii. 344.\u2014*Cerbera Thevetia*, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 53. *The exile or yellow oleander; pivala kaner*.\n\nA large shrub or a small tree, native of America and West Indies, and naturalized all over India. Leaves resembling those of the last species, bell-shaped, yellow flowers and fruit of the size of a crab apple. The bark of this plant, which is possessed of considerable antiperiodic properties, is employed in the treatment of intermittent fevers. In large doses it acts as an acro-narcotic poison by inducing purging and vomiting. Caution is, therefore,\nmuch needed in using it; for cases have been recorded in which the use of the kernels of the drupe produced symptoms of poisoning.\n\n**Cerbera odollam**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 53.\n\nIt is common along the swamps in Southern Konkan and the coast of Madras, Bengal, Australia, Indian Archipelago, etc. Cultivated on account of its beautiful shining leaves and white sweet-scented flowers. The milky juice and leaves are stated to be possessed of purgative properties; but their use is to be deprecated, as there are reasons for believing that even in moderate quantities this tree, and specially its drupe, are possessed of poisonous properties.\n\n**Ophioxylon (Rauwolfia) serpentinum**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 143. *Chandra, chandrika, chotachand, karavi.*\n\nThis shrub is common in the Konkan, Goa, forests of Madras, Burma, etc. It is stated in the Bombay Flora that it is used to poison tigers. (See Antidotes to Snake-bites.)\n\n**LOGANIACE\u00c6.**\n\n**Strychnos nux-vomica**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 155. *Kajra.*\n\nVery common in the Konkan. The seeds contain *strychnia*, an extremely bitter and poisonous alkaloid, mixed with another poisonous alkaloid *brucia*. These substances are also found in the bark and root of this and other species of the genus; and it is remarkable that parasitic plants of the order *Loranthaceae*, which grow on the trunk of *S. nux-vomica*, acquire the poisonous properties of the latter, and contain the same alkaloids. Sir W. O'Shaugnessy states that he saw an athletic European sailor killed in less than an hour by half a drachm of the powdered leaves (of one of these parasites) taken by mistake for cubeb. It appears, however, that the yellow juicy pulp between the nuts is not poisonous, for birds devour it voraciously, and Dr. Birdwood (Veg. Prod. of Bom. Pr.) says the same of the pulp enclosing its deadly seeds; in fact, he includes the fruit of *kajra* in his class of edible fruits. The seeds are swallowed by birds with impunity, being too hard to digest.\n\n**Strychnos colubrina**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 115. *Nagmassad* of Telingu.\n\nThe wood and root of this climbing shrub, which grows in the Konkans, contain strychnia. The fruit is also said to be poisonous. This is the true \u201cP\u00f3 de cobra de capello\u201d of the Portuguese, highly esteemed by the natives as an infallible remedy for the bite of the cobra and other venomous reptiles. For this purpose it is brayed in rice water, and given in small doses internally, and also applied externally.\n\n**ASCLEPIADACE\u00c6.**\n\n**Tylophora fasciculata**, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 151.\n\nIn one case, brought to my notice, the root of this plant is said to have caused poisoning. This requires confirmation.\nSOLANACE\u00c6.\n\nDatura alba, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 174.\n\nThis is a well-known shrub. Every part is poisonous, but the part generally used, is the seed which after being pounded is mixed with food and used by thieves in order to deprive their victims of the power of resistance. This poison causes a sort of temporary insanity, during which the sufferer does not know what passes before his eyes.\n\nWithania (Physalis) somnifera, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 175. Asgund.\n\nA common herb, 2-3 ft. high, met with in Bombay and other parts of India. It is stated in the Bombay Flora that \"the root and leaves are powerfully narcotic and diuretic; the seeds are employed to coagulate milk like the Puneera (in Sind), a plant of the same family.\"\n\nTHYMELACE\u00c6.\n\nLasiosiphon eriocephalus, L. speciosus, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 221. Rameitta.\n\nCommon at Mather\u00e1n, Karli, Khand\u00e1la and other gh\u00e1ts. The leaves are said to be acrid and poisonous, and to affect men as well as fish. The trees are often met with stripped of their bark, which is used in poisoning fish. It is a fact that an acrid poisonous principle abounds in most of the species of this order, and which possess very valuable medicinal properties, though not devoid of dangerous effects.\n\nEUPHORBIACE\u00c6.\n\nThe greater number of species of this order are violent poisons owing to the presence of an acrid principle existing in almost all the organs, especially in the milky juice. There are several plants in India which are very formidable and deleterious, such as\n\nEuphorbia tirucalli, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 76. Milk-bush; niwal, Goa; tiru kally, Malay.\n\nThe juice of this well-known and commonly cultivated (for hedges) euphorbia is extremely acrid and vesicant. (See plants used for poisoning fish.)\n\nEx\u00e6caria insignis, D. C. Prod. xv. p. ii. 1213.\n\nFalconera Malabarica, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 227. Honi, Bomb.; dudla, Guz.; hor or stiora, Goa.\n\nFruit and juice very acrid and poisonous.\n\nMallotus Philippinensis, Bedd. Fl. Sylv. t. 282.\u2014Rottlera tinctoria., Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 230.\nThe powder (kamela) is administered for the expulsion of intestinal worms, but acts as an irritant poison if given in large doses (see medicinal and fish-killing-plants). (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**Baliospermum montanum**, D. C. Prod. xv. p. ii. 1125.\u2014B. polyandrum, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 232. Jamalgota.\n\nThe seeds are very acrid, and have very strong drastic purgative properties. One seed pounded and mixed with some bland oil is the dose usually administered. In larger quantities they produce violent symptoms.\n\n**Chrosophora plicata**, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 232.\n\nA common herb in Bombay and elsewhere. The whole plant is acrid, and possesses drastic properties. The powdered seeds, mixed with large quantities of some bland oil, is given as a cathartic.\n\n**Securinega obovata**, D. C. Prod. xv. p. ii. 449.\u2014Fluggea virosa, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. 236. Kandori.\n\nIt has been stated elsewhere that the bark of this large shrub, common in Bombay, is employed in some parts of India to intoxicate fish. This bark is said also to affect men injuriously. (See Timber Trees.)\n\n**Croton tiglium**, Roxb. Fl. Ind. iii. Purging croton; jamalgota, jepal.\n\nRare in Southern Konkan. Common in Travancore and other parts of Madras, Bengal, Burma, Ceylon and Indian Archipelago. The seeds and their oil are well known as powerful cathartics: cases have, however, been recorded where their use in larger quantities, either criminally or unintentionally, have produced death from excessive purging. The oil applied externally produces a vesicular eruption; it is, therefore, sometimes prescribed in the form of liniment in rheumatism, paralytic affections, diseases of the joints, chest, etc.\n\n**Jatropha curcas**, Dalz. & Gibbs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 77. Jempal or jepal, arbi errand.\n\nNative of Brazil, introduced by the Portuguese, and now common all over India. The expressed oil from the nuts is used in small quantities as a substitute for castor oil, but is very uncertain in its action. In over-doses its action is that of an acro-narcotic poison. A case is recorded in which the partaking of twenty nuts produced very violent purging and vomiting and other symptoms of poisoning. It yielded, however, to careful treatment. Lime-juice is the best remedy.\n\n**Jatropha multifida**, D. C. Prod. xvii. 1089. French physic-nuts, coral plant.\n\nIndigenous in America and Africa and cultivated in gardens. The seeds are even more powerfully purgative than those of the preceding, and a case has been recorded where only three of them being taken, violent vomiting and purging, intense pain and heat in the stomach, with great prostration followed, though the patient eventually recovered under treatment.\nJatropha manihot, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 77. Tapioca, mandioca and cassava plant. (See Chapter on Vegetables and Fruits.)\n\nHura crepitans, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 76. Sand-box tree.\n\nA small tree with a few prickles on the trunk, native of South America and cultivated in gardens. Flowers red in pyramidal aments. Fruit round, smooth, size of a small orange, when ripe bursting into several valves with noise: hence the name. The juice of the bark and leaves is acrid and corrosive, produces blindness in a few days if touched to the eyes. The seeds are possessed of violent cathartic properties, and there are on record cases in which one or two seeds administered in the form of an emulsion nearly proved fatal.\n\nAMARYLLIDE\u00c6.\n\nCrinum Asiaticum, Dalz & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 275. Nagdown.\n\nThe root is officinal in the Pharmacopoeia of India, where it is recommended as a safe emetic. It has a peculiar narcotic smell. The plant was named by Rumphuis and others C. toxicarium on account of its virtues \"in curing the disease caused by the poisoned arrows of the Macassars in their wars,\" and not because of its toxic effects. I must state here, however, for future observation what was narrated to me by a friend acquainted with botany, viz., that a whole family had suffered from symptoms like those of cholera (vomiting and purging) from having accidentally eaten the powder of nagdown.\n\nMELANTHACE\u00c6.\n\nMethonia (gloriosa) superba, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 250. Kharia-nag, kala buch-nag.\n\nThe root of this climbing herbaceous plant, common everywhere and cultivated in gardens, is said by Gibson and Dalzell and others to be poisonous.

Watsanab.\n\nThis aroid is common in the marshes of Belgaum and South Konkan.\n\nSee Famine Plants for the account of other poisonous aroids.\n\nGRAMINE\u00c6.\n\nPaspalum scrobiculatum, Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. Suppl. 97. Kodra.\nIt is said that this grain occasionally produces violent symptoms of poisoning, purging, vomiting, and narcotism; perhaps it is the ergotised grain that is the cause of these. Gibson and Dalzell say that this is \"a very common and cheap grain, but not wholesome; grown on the hill lands of the Konkan, especially the variety Hareek, which often induces temporary insanity and spasms, etc. Large numbers of people may be occasionally seen thus affected.\" (See Chapter on Vegetables and Fruits.)\nPLANTS USED FOR POISONING FISH.\n\nAnamirta cocculus, Dalz. & Gibs.

As might, therefore, be naturally expected, a good many plants are worshipped or used in some of their religious ceremonies. The most important are the following:\u2014\n\nButea frondosa. Palas.\nProsopis spicigera. Shami.\nBauhinia racemosa. Apta.\nCalotropis gigantea. Rui.\nAchyranthes aspera. Agarah.\nF. glomerata. Umbar.\nFicus Bengalensis. Vad\nF. religiosa.

Nim.\n\nButea frondosa. Palas.\u2014The leaves of this plant are trifoliate; the middle leaflet is supposed to represent Vishnu, the left Brahma, and the right Shiv: hence its worship is enjoined in Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma. Hence also its use in the following three great ceremonies:\u2014\nSacred Plants.\n\n1. The leaves are used as platters on the occasion of the investiture of the sacred thread, when a particular part of the ceremony, called chewul (that is, when the barber removes the last tuft of hair from the head of the child to be invested), is being performed.\n\n2. The dry twigs under the designation of samidhas are used for the feeding of hom, or sacred fire, in the ceremony which goes under the name of nava grahas, celebrated to secure the pacification of the nine planets (nava=nine; grahas=planets) on the occasion of vastu shanti, i.e., entrance into a newly-built house, or one acquired from a non-Hindu.\n\n3. The stem is used as a staff on the day of sodmunj, a part of the thread ceremony.\n\nProsopis spicigera. Shami, shamri.\n\nThe worship of this tree is enjoined at page 153 of Vratraj (selections from Bhavishya Puran) to be performed on the tenth of Ashwin Shudhapaksha (Dasera festival). This day, also called vijaya dashmi, is selected on account of its being the one on which Arjuna\u2014one of the Pandavs\u2014took down the weapons he had left on this tree many years before, and fought one of his memorable battles with them. The tree is worshipped to obtain pardon for sins, success over enemies, and the realization of the devotee's wishes. It is believed that shami is transformed into the goddess that pleased Ram. The dry twigs are employed as samidhas for feeding the sacred fire already described. The leaves, as patri (leaf-offerings), are used in the worship of Ganpatti, being thrown at the feet of that god's idol.\n\nBauhinia racemosa. Apta.\n\nAn account of the way this tree is to be worshipped, is found in Dharm Sindhu in the Vol. Dvitya Parichhed, Section Ashwin Mahatma, Chapter Vijaya Dashmi.\n\nThis chapter tells us that this tree, called ashmantak (its Sanskrit name), must be worshipped instead of shami if the latter cannot be found. A complete narrative of this legend is also to be found in Sahadri Kand.\n\nIn the villages of the Konkan where shami does not grow, the ceremony of the worship of apta is performed somewhat as follows:\n\nEarly in the morning, people dressed in rich clothes assemble together, and in procession go outside the town to where the apta tree may be, and there, after a priest has recited some prayers prescribed in the ritual, the chief man of the town cuts a bough of it, the other people following him. These boughs they take along with them, and going to the nearest temple, usually of a goddess, worship her, and make her an offering of a few of the apta leaves, together with flowers of Tajetes patula (French marigold), and blades of rice and corn.\n\nOn returning home they first make an offering of the remaining leaves to their household gods, then to their priests accompanied by some copper or silver coins, and to their parents and guardians,\nor to the elderly people in the house; and, lastly, to their friends, saying: \"Take this gold\"; for the Hindus believe that the leaves over which the muntras are recited, are worth gold, or transformed into gold.\n\nIn Baroda this ceremony is performed with great pomp, the procession being headed by the Gaikwar himself, who is the first person to cut down the bough.\n\nIn Bombay there are two shemi trees, one at Mumbadevi and the other at Rambagh, planted many years ago. Here the people go and worship these trees on the Dasera day, and afterwards they proceed to the temple of Mahalaxmi, carrying along with them the leaves of apta, flowers, rice and corn blades, and make an offering of these to the goddess, as already stated. A great quantity of boughs is sold in streets and near the temples on this day.\n\nOn the tenth day of the month of Ashwin, the Dasera festival is held, and during the nine preceding days, Hindus perform in their houses certain ceremonies.\n\nOn the morning of the first day of Ashwin, they raise a sort of altar or seat, called ghat, for the goddess Bhagwati. There are two methods of putting up this altar\u2014the wet (ola) and the dry (suka). The wet is gone through in the following manner. On a raised seat is placed a copper or wooden tray filled with earth, on which wheat, rice and other grains are sown and watered. Over the top of this mound of earth they keep a copper or silver pot, called tambya, filled with water, and besmeared on the outside with gandh. A betelnut and some copper or silver coins are also put into the pot, over the tambya are fixed three or five betel-leaves (never two or four), and over these again a cocoanut on which is drawn with soot a human face (nose and eyes), sprinkled over with kunku, and covered with a hat, or rather a flat cap made of betel-leaves and the midrib (vid) of the leaves of the cocoa palm, tipped with the flowers of the French marigold. A canopy made of bambu, tastefully decorated with the choicest of flowers, is fixed right above this altar to a hook in the ceiling, and from which the light orange-coloured kawndal fruits (Trichosanthes palmata) and coloured glass globes are hung.\n\nBefore this altar, which is left standing for the space of nine days, every night one or more chapters from the sacred book, called Sapta-siti-pat, are read by the family priest: hence these devotions or readings are called navratra (literally nine nights) in honour of Shri Bhagwati, usually called devi. On the tenth day this altar is removed, the cocoanut is broken, and the kernel mixed with sugar is distributed among relatives and nearest friends; while the rice and corn plants, which have by this time grown to a pretty good height, are worn in the turbans.\n\nThe dry ceremony is performed in the same manner as the wet one, the only difference being that, instead of a mound of earth, a lot of dry rice is piled on a chavrang.\nSacred Plants.\n\nOn the midnight of the eighth day the hom ceremony is performed by some Hindus, and purn\u0101vat (rice, salt, etc.,) are thrown into the hom to appease the hunger of Shri Bhagwati; and on the ninth all the sacred books and weapons, if there be any at home at the time, are worshipped.\n\nCalotropis gigantea Rui.\n\nIn Chaturm\u00e1s M\u0101h\u0101tma, Chapter XX, in the narration of Gallava Rushi taken from Skand Pur\u0101\u1e47, this tree is mentioned to be the transformation of Surya, or the sun. It is used in various ceremonies, both religious and those of time-hallowed custom. The leaves are used as patri, in the same way as those of shemi in the worship of Ganpatti, Harit\u0101lik\u0101, Pitthori, etc. They are also employed in shusti puja (a ceremony performed on the sixth day after confinement for propitiating \"Jewti\", the goddess of destiny) by females. When a Hind\u016b is to marry a third time, it is believed that the third wife will soon die; in order to avoid such a calamity, the man is first married to this tree, which is then cut down. This ceremony is believed to ensure the longevity of the fourth, but really the third wife whom he now marries.\n\nIt is ordered in the Shr\u0101van M\u0101h\u0101tma to worship M\u0101ruti (who is also known as Hunum\u0101n) or the monkey-god on every Saturday with a garland of the flowers of this tree, which are then offered to him. The twigs are also ordered to be used as substitutes for tooth-brushes in the Smritisar Granth. They are also employed as samidhas for the feeding of sacred fires, as mentioned before.\n\nAchyranthes aspera Agarah.\n\nA very common, ash-coloured shrub, about 3 feet high. Leaves obovate rotund; branches 4-sided; spikes very long and slender; flowers purplish-green, shining; lateral bracts rigid and prickle-like.\n\nIn Chaturm\u00e1s M\u0101h\u0101tma, Chapter XX, this plant is mentioned as the transformation of Budh. In Smritisar Granth it is ordered to be used as a tooth-brush. In Vratr\u0101j (page 85) it is directed that on Bh\u0101drapad shudh 5th, females should wash their mouths with 108 pieces of this plant, using them as tooth-brushes; but in case of need the number may be reduced as low as seven; also to bathe 108 times, keeping each time a leaf of this plant on the head. It is also used as samidhas. In Shr\u0101van M\u0101h\u0101tma, Chapter XIII, it is recommended to worship Ganpatti with the leaves of this plant on Shr\u0101van shudh 4th. The same god is similarly worshipped on Bh\u0101drapad shudh 4th (or Ganesh Chaturthi).\n\nFicus glomerata Umbar.\n\nIn Chapter XX of Chaturm\u00e1s M\u0101h\u0101tma it is mentioned that Shukra (teacher of the demons) was transformed into this tree. Its stem is used as a nominal prop for mandaps on the day of Med-muhurth\u2014a ceremony performed a day or two before marriage. Its leaves are used as patri in the worship of Ganpatti, etc. The fruits are strung and put round a pregnant woman's neck on a particular day during the eighth month of pregnancy. This is not done by all, some using, instead, the flowers of various plants. It is mentioned in Guru Charitra, Chapter XIX, that Guru or the god Datta or Dattatri lives on this tree for ever. The fourth incarnation of the Hindu god named Narashinh, after tearing the demon\nHiranya Kashappu with his nails, relieved himself of the demon's poison by inserting them in the stem of this tree. Hence it is considered sacred, and worshipped.\n\n**Ficus Bengalensis. Vad.**\n\nIn Chapter XX of *Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma* it is mentioned that Br\u00e1hma was transformed into a vad tree. Its dry twigs are used as *samidhas* for producing sacred fire. The leaves are employed as one of the *panch pallavas* or platters, and also for pouring libations. In *Vratraj*, page 267, females are ordered to worship this tree on *Jesht shudh* 15th, to water it, to wind a thread round it, and to worship it with *gandh*, flowers, etc., and make *pradakshanas* (go round it a certain number of times). They are further ordered to praise it, and to pray to it for the survival of their husbands and for the fulfilment of their wishes. They are also told that by worshipping this tree they secure one of the heavens named *Shivloka*. The reason of this worship is given at page 42 of *Vrat Kaumudi*, wherein it is mentioned that S\u00e1vibri, the wife of Saty\u00e1w\u00e1n, worshipped this tree, and thereby got back her deceased husband. At page 78 of the same book it is stated that they should perform the thread ceremony of this tree and its marriage with the *durva* plant (*Cynodon dactylon*).\n\n**Ficus religiosa. Pipal.**\n\nChapter XX of *Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma* tells us that this tree is the transformation of the gods' *Guru*, and is termed *ashwath*. The cause of this transformation is mentioned in Chapter IV of *Kartik Mah\u00e1tma*. It is stated in *Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma* that this tree is frequented by all the gods, and is, therefore, ordered that it should be watered, worshipped, and *pradakshanas* performed round it. It is enjoined in the *Shr\u00e1van Mah\u00e1tma* to worship this tree on every Saturday of the month *Shr\u00e1van*. On page 39 of *Vrat Kaumudi* is ordered the worship of this tree on every *Somvati*, i.e., on every Monday on which a new moon should happen to fall. At page 342 of *Vratraj*, *Atharwan* tells the *Rushis* how to worship this tree; and *Valkhilya* mentions how Vishnu became a *pipal*. At page 65 of the same book is ordered the performance of the *m\u00fanj* or thread ceremony of this tree; at page 75 its marriage with *tulas* (*Ocymum sanctum*). The tree is also used in *samidhas* and for platters in *panch pallav* and for pouring libations.\n\n**Cynodon dactylon. Dub or durva.**\n\nChapter XX of *Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma* says that this grass is the transformation of *R\u00e1hu*. At page 124 is given a description of the *Durva asht\u00e1mi*, i.e., its worship on *Bhadrapad shudh* 8th. It is said that on this day the Hindus are ordered to go to this plant, pray to it, pluck it up from the ground, and bring it home, and worship it along with *Shiv*; pray to her (*Durva* is a goddess) to increase his family, as it (or she) is very fertile and gregarious. At page 156 of the same work is ordered the worship of *Ganpatti* with six *durvas*, etc., every day. At page 78 is ordered the marriage of this plant with *vad* or *war*.\nSacred Plants.\n\n**Eragrostis cynosuroides.** *Kush or darbh.*\n\nIt is mentioned in Chapter XX of *Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma* that this plant is a transformation of *ketu*. Chapter XXVI of *Shrav\u00e1n Pur\u00e1n* orders that these darbhs should be pulled out of the ground on *Pithori Amav\u00e1shya*. Unless this is done, the plants are not considered fit for use in sacred ceremonies. They are also employed in various funeral rites, such as *tarpan*, etc.\n\n**Eugenia jambolana.** *Jumbul.*\n\nThe god *Megh* is said to have been transformed into a jambul tree. The colour of the fruit being dark like that of *Krishna*, this plant is very dear to him; it is, therefore, worshipped, and Br\u00e1hmins are fed under it. The leaves are used as platters or *panch pallows* and for pouring libations.\n\n**Mangifera Indica.** *Amb.*\n\nIn Chapter XX of *Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma* it is said that this tree is the transformation of the god *Prajapatti*. In *Smritisar Granth* the twigs of this tree are ordered to be used as tooth-brushes and its leaves as platters in *panch pallows* and for pouring libations; and flowers in the worship of *Shiv* on the day of *Maha Shivr\u00e1tri* in the month of *M\u00e1gh*. The leaves are also employed in adorning *mandaps* and houses on occasions of various ceremonies.\n\n**Ficus cordifolia.** *Pair.*\n\nThe leaves are used in *panch pallows*.\n\n**Ocymum sanctum.** *Tulas.*\n\nThis is the holy basil common in all Hindu gardens and temples. Chapter XVII of *Chaturm\u00e1s Mah\u00e1tma* tells us that it is a goddess, and should be watered and worshipped daily, at least in *Chaturm\u00e1s*, i.e., from *Ashad shudh* 11th to *Kartik shudh* 11th. The worship of this tree and its marriage with the god *Krishna* is mentioned in Chapters XIX, XX and XXI of *Kartik Mah\u00e1tma* in selections taken from *Sannat Kumar Sumaheta*, also at page 72 of *Vrat Kaumudi*. At page 351 of the same book is ordered the *tulasi laksha vrat*, a ceremony performed when a vow is made, which consists in offering a lac of the leaves, one by one, to *Krishna*, the performer fasting until the ceremony is complete. It is said that *Krishna* recommended his king *Udeshtir* (Dharmr\u00e1j) to perform this worship.\n\n**Phyllanthus emblica.** *Aula.*\n\nChapter I of *Kartik Mah\u00e1tma* orders the worship of this tree and the feeding of a Br\u00e1hmin couple under it, whereby all the sins are washed off. At page 73 of *Vrat Kaumudi* is ordered the *vrat* and worship of this plant.\n\n**Musa paradisiaca.** *Kela.*\n\nAt page 251 of *Vratr\u00e1j* it is ordered that females should worship this tree on the 4th of *Kartik shudh*, whereby their husbands are said to survive them, and their life is lengthened. This tree is also worshipped on the 3rd of *Shrav\u00e1n*. The stems of the plants, laden with their long rachises of fruits, are invariably placed by the natives at the entrance of their houses, during their marriage or other festivals, as appropriate emblems of plenty and fertility.\n\u00c6gle marmelos. Bel or beli.\n\nIn Chapter XVIII of Chaturm\u00e1s M\u0101h\u0101tma is mentioned the origin of this tree. Its leaf is the symbol of the Hindu triad, and represents Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (Shiv). It is employed as patri in worshipping the deity Shiv. At page 352 of Vratraj, taken from Ja\u00efmini Aranya Katha, Durvas Rusa orders Draopadh, the wife of P\u0101ndave, to observe the bel laksha vrat, i.e., the worship of Mah\u0101deo with a lac of the leaves of this tree.\n\nSaraca Indica (Jonesia Asoca). Jassund\u012b, asok.\n\nThis is a small, handsome tree. Leaflets 6-12, oblong, lanceolate, 3-9 in. long. Flowers of a beautiful orange colour, collected in dense cymes at the ends of branches. Pod scimitar-shaped, 4-10 in. long, 4-8-seeded. Common in the Southern Konkan.\n\nAt page 224 of Vratraj it is ordered to worship this tree on Chaitra shudh 15th. It was under this tree that Sita, the wife of R\u0101m, passed her days when she was carried away and imprisoned by R\u0101wan, and I believe that it is so named because under it she was relieved of her grief (a=away from; shoke=grief.)\n\nCucurbita pepo. Kohala.\n\nPage 46 of Vrat Kaumudi recommends the worship of this tree, considering it a goddess. Dharmraj tells Krishna, and Narad priest of the gods tells king Chandrasen to observe the vrat of this cucurbitaceous plant (vide page 370 of Vratraj in selections taken from Padma Puran). Its fruit is also cut with some ceremony, called kohala muhurt, a day or two before a marriage.\n\nCucumis sativus. Kak\u016bli.\n\nAt page 371 of Vratraj it is related that Suth told the Rushis and Shiv told his wife P\u0101rwatti to worship this tree, as by doing so females do not lose their husbands, or that these survive them. The fruit of this tree is cut into thin slices, and employed in the worship of snakes on Shravan shudh 5th (nagpanchmi day). It is likewise employed in the worship of many other gods.\n\nPandanus odoratissimus. Keuda.\n\nChapter III of Kartik M\u0101h\u0101tma relates that this plant is cursed by Shiv for telling a lie and giving false evidence on the occasion of a dispute between Shiv and Vishnu. But he again took pity on it, and ordered that he (Shiv) should be worshipped with this plant on the day of Shivratri. The plant is also employed in the worship of many other gods.\n\nMelia azadirachta. Nim.\n\nWhen nectar was being taken to heaven from the world below for the use of the gods, it is believed that a few drops of it fell on this tree. Hence on new year's day of Shalivan shak, Hindus eat its leaves in the hope of thereby acquiring freedom from disease.\n\nIpomoea pes-capre. Marayada vel or marja vel.\n\nThe following curious practice is observed by Hindus at Bassein and some villages of the Konkan, though I have found no authority on this subject in their sacred books:\u2014\nThis creeper is twined round the cot of a Hindu mother on the sixth day after her confinement, and is intended to serve as a protection to the new-born babe against any evil effects that might arise from the visit of Jevti or Satvi (goddess of destiny), who is supposed on this day to call for the purpose of writing the child's destiny on its forehead, and sometimes even carry it away. The notion of this creeper being used in the manner above described, seems to be probably suggested by the fact that as it grows on the sea side, and serves to bind the sands together, and prevents the encroachment of the sea, it might, so to speak, be used to bind the child to its mother, and prevent the effect of Satvi's evil intention.\n\nSatvi is also propitiated by feasts (the members of the family keep a watch on and pass the fifth and sixth nights in jollity) and worship. This worship is of two kinds: one consists in drawing on the wall a female picture over whose face another face, made of dough is stuck and in whose four hands are four cradles with a babe in each. The figure is dressed in a cloth dyed with turmeric, and beneath it (the figure) is placed a stone, the one used for grinding masala, covered over with leaves of rui (Calotropis gigantea) having the figures of children drawn on them with red lead. Both the figures on the wall and on the leaves are then worshipped, different kinds of flowers and sweetmeats (usually gram and sliced cocoanut) being offered to the goddess. These sweetmeats are afterwards consumed by each and every member of the family and distributed among their friends. A widow in the family generally conducts this ceremony. The other form of worship, which is conducted by the father of the child, consists in placing on a four-footed stool (chawang) a piece of gold or silver of the size of a four-anna piece with a female figure stamped on it and a handful of rice. These are then worshipped, and the gold or silver piece is subsequently tied round the neck of the child to guard it against any danger to its life. This ceremony is known by the name of jivti pujan.\n\nPutranjiva Roxburghii.\n\nThe black nuts of this plant are made into necklaces or rosaries, and are put round the necks of children, as it is supposed that they have the power of warding off diseases caused by evil sight. Hence its name putra jiv\u2014life of a child.\n\nMelia azedarach.\n\nThe nuts are frequently strung and worn round the necks, and during the prevalence of epidemics of small-pox, etc., are suspended over the doors and verandahs.\n\nSymplocos spicata. Lodh.\n\nThe fluted seeds are put round the necks of children as necklaces, to avoid evil spirits.\n\nThe rosaries made of the fruits of the following plants are worn as religious emblems:\n\nElaeocarpus ganitrus. Rudraksh.\n\nThis plant is to be found on the higher gh\u00e2ts. The five-grooved and elegantly tubercled nuts are worn in the form of necklaces by\nshivbaktas (worshippers or followers of Shiv) in order to obtain\nsivaloka (i.e., heaven wherein the god Shiv resides) and to gain his\ngraces. A good account relating to this practice is to be found in\nSivalila murut. The plant being rare on our gh\u00e2ts, the nuts are\nimported in large quantities from Sing\u00e2pore, Nep\u00e1l, etc. I believe\nthat beads are manufactured of the aloes wood (Aquillaria agallocha)\nand perhaps of some other trees.\n\nEl\u00e6carpus tuberculatus.\n\nThe nuts of this tree are also worn as necklaces.\n\nOcymum sanctum. Tulas.\n\nThe Vishnuvas wear necklaces made of the root or stem of this\nshrub.\n\nMany plants, besides the above, are ordained by the sacred books\nof the Hindus to be used in religious ceremonies; a lengthy de-\nscription of them would be beyond the scope of this paper. I\nshall, therefore, describe, as shortly as possible, the way the daily\ndevotions are made, and mention the flowers and other vegetable\nsubstances used in their performance.\n\nThe gods, after being bathed (literally) in holy water (or water\nover which certain mantras are recited) and then dried with a towel,\nare placed in a copper dish according to their piously supposed\nrank. By some they are kept on a chavrang, a sort of small wooden\naltar. Then gandh (sandal-wood rubbed on stone which water) is\napplied to their heads or foreheads, followed by akshata (blessed\nrice) which is pressed or stuck over the gandh, then flowers of\nvarious hues are thrown over the head of each image, taking\ncare to offer, whenever possible, those flowers which are most\nacceptable to each god. Then the images are dusted over success-\nively with a pinch or two of \"abh\u00eer\", \"gul\u00e2l\", \"halad\", \"kunku\"\nand \"shendur\" (red lead). At the end of this \"arti\", a lighted\nlamp fed with ghee is shown to or carried over the heads of the\ngods, and a food called \"nayaved\" is offered to them, the whole\nceremony being wound up by burning a small bit of camphor and\n\"udbatti\" or \"agarbatti\". During the whole of the time the\nceremony is being performed, both the hands and the mouth are\nconstantly engaged.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the Hindu worship above described the images of the\nfollowing five gods are indispensably present, viz., Shiv, Vishnu,\nGanpat\u00ee, Surya (sun) and one devi named Anupurna (an incarna-\ntion of P\u00f4rvatti) the supplier of food. These five gods form the\nPanchayatan. To them are added the penates, or images of house-\nhold gods, varying in number according to the wishes of the devotees.\n\nAbhir is of a brown colour, and composed of various odoriferous\nsubstances.\n\nGul\u00e2l is a reddish powder, made of the flowers of Butea frondosa,\ncalled kissu in Gujar\u00e2t. It is also made of sapan wood (Caesal-\npinea sapan) and of starch obtained from the tuberous root of an\naroid or some other plant.\n\nHalad is turmeric, the tuberous root of Curcuma longa.\nSacred Plants.\n\n*Kunku* is the powder of the tuberous root of *Curcuma longa*, coloured red by being immersed for some days in some alkaline solutions, generally of lime water.\n\nAll these substances are, of course, pulverised before being used. *Halad* and *kunku* are sprinkled specially over the head of the *devi*; and *shendur* specially over *Ganpatti*.\n\n*Nayaved* may either consist of sugar alone, or milk and sugar, or any cooked food. When only of sugar or milk, it is offered in a brass cup, or one of any other metal; but when it consists of any cooked food, it is offered in a brass dish only. This dish is placed on the ground, in a square previously marked out with the fingers dipped in water. The worshipper, who during the whole ceremony squats on a very low stool, then takes two leaves of *Ocymum sanctum* (*tulas*) in his right hand, dips them in water, throws one on the food and the other, after five peculiar motions of the hand, on the gods, keeping during this time his eyes closed with the left hand.\n\nCamphor is the concrete oil of *Cinnamomum camphora*, a plant of China, Japan, Cochin China, etc., now introduced into Java.\n\n*Udbatti* is composed of several odoriferous substances, the chief ingredient being benzoin, a balsamic exudation procured by making incisions into the bark of a tree named *Styrax benzoin*, indigenous in Borneo, Java, Sumatra and Siam.\n\n*Agarbatti* is also composed of several substances, the chief of which is aloes or eagle-wood (*Aquilaria agallocha*), a tree growing in Bengal.\n\nAll the ingredients composing these two *battis* are made into paste, and then rolled into thin sticks, generally of the thickness of a small quill, and then dried. Either the one or the other is used according to the fancy and means of the devotee.\n\nIn the selection of the flowers to be offered to the deities, colour is carefully attended to. During the worship of the deity *Shiv*, white flowers are offered (those of water-lilies *nelumbium* and *nymphaea*, named *kamals*, being preferred); other colours are considered inadmissible. The leaves of *bel* tree (*Aegle marmelos*) are also offered; the whole leaf (not the leaflets) must be used. No other god is worshipped with these leaves.*\n\n*Pandanus odoratissimus* is cursed by *Shiv*: so its flowers, though acceptable to the other gods, are not used during his worship, except on one particular occasion (see what is stated in the sacrificial woods about this plant).\n\n*Vishnu* receives either white or red flowers or those of any other colour. He is the only god who is worshipped with *Ocymum sanctum* (*tulas*).\n\n* In Chapter XVIII of Chaturmads Mahdima it is stated that other gods may also be worshipped with these leaves, but it is never done.\nTo Ganpatti is offered flowers of all colours, but red are preferred, specially those of Nerium odorum (kanir) and Hibiscus rosasinensis (jaswand); yellow and white varieties are not rejected. During his worship, durva (Cynodon dactylon) is absolutely necessary. This is a common grass called huriyalbi, but known as durva or dub in religious books and during religious ceremonies.\n\nSurya (Sun.) It is believed that white and yellow flowers are disliked by this god, and red preferred. Hence the red varieties of Nerium odorum and Hibiscus rosasinensis are only selected for offerings, the white and yellow flowers being rejected. It may be for this reason that, in the gardens of Hindus, the red varieties of the trees above mentioned are usually to be found. On some occasions durva is offered to him.\n\nDevi.\u2014Flowers of all kinds are offered to her; kunku and halad (turmeric) mentioned above, are particularly placed over her head.\n\nGaur.\u2014The goddess of this name is much pleased with yellow flowers of Thespesia populnea (bhendi): hence these are invariably offered to her during her worship. The same flowers are also offered to Ganpatti and other deities, male and female, which are not particularly averse to yellow colour.\n\nShank (shell) is worshipped with gandh and flowers, but no rice is put over the gandh.\n\nHanuman.\u2014Leaves and flowers of Calotropis gigantea are sacred to Hanuman, and are used during his worship.\n\nManja.\u2014Euphorbia nerifolia (thor) is sacred to the goddess of serpents.\n\nLakshmi.\u2014This goddess resides or has her abode in the central yellow part (stamens and stigmas) of kammal (flowers of nelumbium and nymphea), but any flower can be used during her worship.\n\nThe spiral vessels which abound in the leaves and scapes of the water-lilies, after being carefully gathered, are made into wicks for lamps, which are lighted by the Hindus in the shrines of their idols.\n\nThe five flowers that tip the five arrows of Kama dev, the Indian Cupid, are\u2014\n\nMichelia champaca. Ohampa.\n\nMesua ferrea. Nagkeshar.\n\nPavonia odorata.* Bala.\n\nMangifera Indica. Amb.\n\nPandanus odoratissimus. Keuda.\n\nGaneshwar.\n\nThe handsome tree Cassia fistula, called bava in Bombay and cacay in Karnatak, is held sacred to Ganeshwar, the St. Januarius of\n\n* This is a small, herbaceous plant with cordate 3-5-lobed leaves, pink flowers, clustered at the ends of branches, common in various parts of India and Ceylon.\nIndia; the people in Mysore put stakes of it in the ground and worship them.\u2014Graham's Cat. Bombay Plants.\n\n**Nyctanthes arbortristis.** *Parijata.*\n\nThis tree is supposed by the Hindus to have been brought from heaven by the god Krishna for his wife Satyabhama, on account of the fragrance of its flowers. Hence the use of its high-scented flowers in the worship of all the gods.\n\n**Anthocephalus cadamba.**\n\nThe flowers of this plant are also much esteemed in some parts of India, where this plant is common.\n\n**Stereospermum chelonoides.**\n\nThe highly scented flowers of this plant are also much used by some people as an offering to the gods.\n\n**Crataeva religiosa,** Dalz. & Gibs. Bby. Fl. 8. *Narvala, varvana.*\n\nDrury states that \"in the Society Islands, of which this tree is a native, as well as of Malab\u00e1r, it is planted in burial grounds, being esteemed sacred to their idols.\" Probably this is the reason why it is named *C. religiosa*; for, so far as my enquiries go, it is not mentioned in Hindu religious books, nor used in their worship.\n\n**Gossypium.**\n\nThe sacred thread of the Hindus must, according to the institutes of Manu, be made of cotton only. And, moreover, this thread should be spun, tied and finished by a Br\u00e1hmin alone; no person of any other caste being permitted to prepare it. (See Fibrous Trees.)\n\n**Crotalaria juncea,** Dalz. & Gibs Bby. Fl. 54. *Sunn, tag.*\n\nThe great Hindu lawgiver Man\u00fa enjoined on the Shkatrias the use of the sacred thread of *sunn*. It appears that Man\u00fa, being a Br\u00e1hmin, always tried to keep this distinction, and claim superiority for his class. But, now-a-days, the sacred threads of almost all the Hindus are made of cotton.\n\nThe common sacrificial woods of the Hindus on this side of India are:\u2014\n\n**Butea frondosa.** *Palas.*\n\n**Prosopis spicigera.** *Shemi.*\n\n**Calotropis gigantea.** *Rui.*\n\n**Achyranthes aspera.** *Agarah.*\n\n**Ficus glomerata.** *Umbar.*\n\n**Ficus Bengalensis.** *Vad.*\n\n**Ficus religiosa.** *Pipal.*\n\n**Cynodon dactylon.** *D\u00fcb.*\n\n**Eragrostis cynosuroides.** *Kush.*\nThe five leaves (*panch pallav*), used by the Hindus of this side of India as platters and for pouring libations, are gathered from the following trees:\n\n- **Mangifera Indica.** *Amb.*\n- **Eugenia jambolana.** *Jambul.*\n- **Ficus Bengalensis.** *Vad.*\n- **Ficus cordifolia.** *Pair.*\n- **Ficus religiosa.** *Pipal.*\n- **Lea macrophylla.** *Dinda.*\n\nThe large leaves of this plant are used as platters for food every Monday during the month of *Shravan*.\n\nIt appears that the Hindus are enjoined not to use tooth-brushes made of plants the sap of which is coloured; those only being lawful whose sap is colourless. *Smritisar Granth* gives a long list of plants the twigs of which can be used for the purpose. The following are a few of them which have been identified:\n\n- **Bocagea Dalzellii.** *Sajiri.*\n- **\u00c6gle marmelos.** *Bel.*\n- **Feronia elephantum.** *Kavit.*\n- **Zizyphus jujuba.** *Bor.*\n- **Mangifera Indica.** *Amb.*\n- **Butea frondosa.** *Palas.*\n- **Acacia catechu.** *Kair.*\n- **Albizzia Lebbeck.** *Shiris.*\n- **Anthocephalus cadamba.** *Kadam.*\n- **Calatropis gigantea.** *Rui.*\n- **Wrightia tinctoria.** *Kuda.*\n- **Achyranthes aspera.** *Agarah.*\n- **Briedelia montana.** *Assana.*\n\nThe fruits of *wagatti* (*Capparis brevispina*) and of *gometti* (*Melothria heterophylla*)\u2014*Bryonia umbellata* of Dalzell and Gibson\u2014are eaten on *duadashis* which occur in the month of *Ashad*. The two fruits are invariably associated in the *bhaji* or dish made for those days.\n\n**Smithia sensitiva.** *Kaola.*\n\nEaten at all seasons as a pot herb, as stated elsewhere; is especially used on every Monday of *Shravan*.\n\n**Cassia tora.** *Takl\u00e1.*\n\nIs also eaten as a pot herb in this district by some people.\nOn Saturdays of the same month Shr\u0101van the Hindus prepare a kind of bh\u0101ji (called panch-bhelli-bh\u0101ji) of the following five plants:\n\n- Cassia tora. Takl\u00e1.\n- Bauhinia Malabarica. Koral.\n- Amaranthus oleraceus. Mat.\n- Celosia argentea. Kurdu.\n- Phalangium tuberosum. Kuli.\n\nMat is always taken, even if any one or more of the others be wanting. This kind of food is partaken of, because it is believed to be particularly acceptable to the gods.\n\nEclipta prostrata. Maaka.\n\nIs used in worship on the days when shr\u0101dha (office for the dead or ceremony in honour of the dead) is performed. The leaves of this plant and of Ocymum sanctum are thrown over the ball of cooked blessed rice (now called pind) made in honour of the dead. I believe some people use also the leaves and flowers of augusta (Sesbania grandiflora).\n\nA branch of gometti (Melothria heterophylla) is suspended by some people over the hood of the idol of cobra on n\u0101gpanchmi day, or during his worship.\n\nThese notes were drawn up from information supplied to me by an intelligent Br\u0101hmin, and confirmed by a Hindu friend acquainted with the subject.\nINDEX.\n\nA.\n\nAal ... ... ... 88, 162, 200, 246\nAbelmoschus esculentus ... 147, 227\nAbrus precatorius ... ... ... 217\nAbutilon: Indicum, 228; muticum, 194; tomentosum ... ... ...

Gray.\nTHE\n\nBOTANY OF THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY.\n\nTo furnish an even tolerably accurate account of the Botany of Western India is assuredly a task of no small difficulty. The main obstacle in the way of its fulfilment is the unmethodical and fragmentary manner in which the subject has hitherto been studied, and the next, our very imperfect acquaintance with the botanical features and products of some of the more remote and less known districts of the Presidency, especially those parts of it which are under native rule. Through the labours of such able botanists as Sykes, Law, Graham, Stocks, Gibson, and Dalzell, a vast deal has already been accomplished. Much still remains to be done, and good work is even now in active progress\u2014carried on by enthusiastic botanists whose labours will one day bear valuable fruit. When the botany of this Presidency and its dependencies shall have been fully worked out, and sufficient materials collected, it is to be hoped that some person may be found competent to undertake the task of preparing, on a new and enlarged scale, a comprehensive scientific guide to the Bombay Flora.\n\nIn this paper I purpose to include only a short description of the boundaries and extent of the Bombay Presidency, and its division into botanical provinces; the distribution in detail of the natural orders throughout the Presidency, with some account of their economic uses, and also those of the more important naturalised and cultivated plants belonging to each. I shall next offer some general observations on the vegetation of Western India, on the number and comparative development of the natural orders, and on the number and comparative frequency of species and individuals; and it will, lastly, be necessary to consider the subject of distribution, especially as influenced by climate, soil, exposure, and elevation.\n\nThe nomenclature of Indian plants is a subject of which the bare mention is sufficient to raise a host of difficulties. When the Flora of a country is explored by a number of botanists working at different times, each independently of the other, and in some cases in ignorance of the labours of those who have gone before, it is not extraordinary that to a very great extent new species should be instituted which will be found by a more careful observer to have been already described. There is no circumstance by which so many difficulties are thrown in the path of the student of Indian Botany as the incredible number of synonyms possessed by single plants.\u00b9 The identification\n\n\u00b9 For example, *Cissampelos Pareira*, a common climbing plant of the Konkan jungles, has been described under eighteen different names by various collectors. A plant with six or eight names is quite an ordinary occurrence. *Allophyllus Cobbe*, a climbing shrub belonging to the natural order *Sapindaceae*, possesses, according to Hooker's Flora of British India, no less than thirty synonyms.\nof a plant is thus often a work of time, solely in consequence of the numerous authorities which have to be consulted before the correct description can be found. In their imperfect definitions and sub-division of genera, Indian botanists have much to answer for; they have in this way not only introduced confusion into the old and well-defined genera, but they have also unnecessarily created new groups and sub-divisions which are of no practical value. Another prevalent evil is a tendency to the needless and excessive multiplication of species; this is mainly due to a deficiency in habits of accurate observation; the most trivial variations resulting from such causes as differences in climate, soil, aspect, and elevation being sufficient, in the judgment of some naturalists, to raise to the rank of distinct species individuals which might possibly have been the progeny of the same parents. The multiplication of species may also be attributed, in a great degree, to the want of harmony, just alluded to, between the labours of such a number of observers. It is inevitable that, under these circumstances, varieties of one species should be described as so many distinct species by an equal number of independent collectors. Nor are the records of Indian botany wanting in frequent examples where a detailed description of a species is drawn up by a botanist from observation of a single specimen, the variations of other individuals of the same species, no matter how produced, being ignored; it often hinders the prompt recognition of a plant, in consequence of the specific characters thus drawn being necessarily incomplete or even entirely erroneous. It may sometimes be a matter of nice judgment to determine to which description the particular specimen should be referred. That it is impossible to define a species accurately unless it has been examined in all its variations, is an important fact which is too frequently overlooked.\n\nIn the points above noted the Flora Indica seems to have suffered to a far greater extent than that of any other country. Dr. Hooker and Mr. Bentham, for their labours in reducing the number of genera and species, will deserve the grateful remembrance of all future botanists.\n\nThat part of the peninsula, commonly called Western India, to which the following detailed botanical description will apply, embraces within its limits the western half of the Deccan table-land; the Western Gh\u00e1ts; the Konkan; North K\u00e1nara; those parts of the S\u00e1tputa hills within the Collectorate of Kh\u00e1ndesh, with the neighbouring valley of the T\u00e1pti; K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t; and the western extremity of the Vindhy\u00e1 chain where it slopes downwards into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Country.\n\nThis great extent of territory it is necessary to divide into provinces in order to define clearly the range of the individual species comprised within its flora. Political or other arbitrary limits are here out of place; each province must be, above all other considerations, defined and characterized by its botanical features. The Presidency will thus almost naturally separate into five botanical provinces\u2014namely, Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Kh\u00e1ndesh, the Deccan, the Konkan and the Gh\u00e1ts, and North K\u00e1nara. Each one of these\nis distinguished from the others by the possession of some characteristic forms of vegetation, and more especially by the general aspect and constitution of its flora. It must not, however, be assumed that all the species of a botanical province are to be found nowhere outside its geographical limits; on the contrary, the characteristic vegetation of one province passes by insensible gradations into that of another, so that, owing to the absence of any sharply defined limits, their botanical boundaries cannot be considered as more than approximative.\n\nThe physical features and climate of each province I now pass on to describe\u2014not in any great detail however. This particular description is more especially demanded in order that we may appreciate clearly the influence which these exercise on the geographical distribution of plants and on the comparative development of any given provincial flora.\n\nFirst in order comes the botanical province of Gujar\u00e1t, including the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The river T\u00e1pti forms the southern boundary of Gujar\u00e1t proper; it is bordered on the east by the table-land of M\u00e1lwa; on the north-east it is separated from Meyw\u00e1r by a range of hills extending from the river Mahi by Dongarpur to below Mount Abu; on the north it is limited by M\u00e1rv\u00e1r; and on the west by the Ran and the Gulf of Cutch. The province easily falls into three divisions, which differ from one another in physical features to a very marked degree. (1) The central portion, embracing the alluvial country along the Gulf of Cambay, the P\u00e1lanpur State, the western parts of Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and the northern parts of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, is almost perfectly flat. Half the Surat district, together with the districts of Broach, Kaira, and Ahmedabad, and the neighbouring portions of the Baroda territory, with parts of P\u00e1lanpur and Mahi K\u00e1ntha, are fertile, well wooded, and richly cultivated; but the north of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and the districts of P\u00e1lanpur bordering M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and the Ran are sandy, arid, and comparatively devoid of vegetation. The average rainfall at Broach and Kaira is 27 inches, at Ahmedabad and P\u00e1lanpur 22 inches, but towards M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and the Ran it is much less. The hot-weather temperature near the Gulf of Cambay is 91\u00b0, and in the vicinity of the Ran and M\u00e1rv\u00e1r it is known to reach as high as 115\u00b0; hot winds also prevail here. In the cold season the average daily temperature is about 70\u00b0. (2) The eastern portion of the province, comprising Rewa K\u00e1ntha and the western slopes of the Vindh\u00fd\u00e1s, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, and the greater part of Mahi K\u00e1ntha, is mostly hilly and clothed throughout with dense vegetation, principally forest. The geological formation is granite interspersed here and there with trap, slate, and limestone; the hills are separated by deep ravines. The hot and cold weather temperatures are much the same as the plains near the Gulf of Cambay. The annual rainfall is, however, considerably in excess; the average for Mahi K\u00e1ntha is 33 inches, for Rewa K\u00e1ntha and the Panch Mah\u00e1ls 36, and for B\u00e1riya 46 inches; and it is accordingly to this greater humidity that the luxuriance of the vegetation is due. The climate, from the close of the rains to the beginning of the hot season, is very unhealthy. (3) The peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, with the exception of its northern part, is\nin general undulating. Towards the south it is traversed from east to west by a semi-circular range of hills, known as the greater and lesser Gir; this range throws off the rainfall into the Gulf of Cambay and into the Arabian Sea. Near Porbandar are the Barda hills, which are continuous with a range extending to the north-east, closely approaching the Ran, so that the rainfall of this part of the Peninsula is almost entirely sent into the Gulf of Cutch and into the Ran. The Gir is a succession of hills separated from one another by deep valleys, with their sides scored by steep-sided ravines, all clothed with dense jungle; during part of the year the climate is notoriously unhealthy. The Barda hills are also well covered with vegetation. The marine districts of the Peninsula are flat, with rich alluvial soil, and are well cultivated, while the central districts are rocky and possess but a very scanty flora. The temperature of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r ranges from $50^\\circ$ in the cold to $104^\\circ$ in the hot season. The annual rainfall in the southern districts is between 30 and 40 inches, but the central and northern parts being screened by the hills from the rain-bringing winds, it is at R\u00e1jkot considerably less,\u2014not more than 24 inches. The differences thus occasioned in the degrees of atmospheric humidity which exist in certain districts will in great part account for the varying character of the vegetation of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\n\nKh\u00e1ndesh.\u2014This botanical province includes the valley of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed from Burh\u00e1npur nearly to Surat, and the western half of the S\u00e1tpuda chain. South of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed, it is bounded on the west by the Gh\u00e1ts, and is separated from the Deccan by the Silb\u00e1ri and Laling hills and their eastern extensions. The t\u00e1luk\u00e1s of Ch\u00e1lisgaon, P\u00e1chora and J\u00e1mner will be included in the description of the Deccan, to which province they belong botanically. The S\u00e1tpud\u00e1s are formed of trap, are very steep, and are clothed on both sides with dense forest. The T\u00e1pt\u00ed valley, with an elevation of about 700 feet, is perfectly flat and is in general fairly well wooded; about S\u00e1vda the country has quite a park-like appearance. That part of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed valley which lies immediately below the southern slopes of the S\u00e1tpuda range is thickly covered with forest and jungle. The rest of the province south of Nandurb\u00e1r is traversed from east to west by three parallel ranges of hills with flat country between. The hills are wooded, while the flat country is covered, more densely however towards the west, with low thorny jungle. Towards the east the land is more fertile and is fairly cultivated; in the river valleys and near the towns some fine timber is to be seen. Geologically the trap formation of the province is similar to that of the greater part of the Deccan, the land sloping gradually towards the T\u00e1pt\u00ed. The temperature varies from $67^\\circ$ in the cold season to $93^\\circ$ in the hot season. The average annual rainfall at Dhulia is 21 inches; but on the hilly northern boundary this is more than doubled.\n\nThe Deccan.\u2014The districts of this great table-land which lie within the limits of the Bombay Presidency are bounded on the north by Kh\u00e1ndesh; on the east by the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory; on the west the province is separated from the sea by the Gh\u00e1ts and the Konkan; and on the south it is bounded by Mysore. The mean elevation of the table-land is about 2,000 feet. Its geological forma-\ntion is principally trap and laterite. The surface of its northern half is generally level and open, with isolated flat-topped hills dotted here and there, parallel spurs extending eastwards from the Gh\u00e1ts. The soil is comparatively shallow, there is little jungle, and, except near the towns and along the river banks, there is no timber. In the district of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and the southern parts of Belgaum and Kal\u00e1dgi the ground is more broken; instead of trap, we have granite, limestone, quartz, and sandstone making their appearance. In the western portion of Belgaum there is a good deal of jungle. In Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r the soil is deeper and much more fertile than in other parts of the province, and a corresponding influence on the vegetation is the result. Along the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e1ts are deep ravines, the sides of which are covered with jungle and scanty low forest. Altogether the flora of the Deccan, both in species and individuals, is far from being extensive. The cold-weather temperature is 68\u00b0, while that of the hot season seldom rises above 87\u00b0. The annual rainfall for Poon\u00e1, Ahmednagar, and Shol\u00e1pur averages 25 inches, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra 40, Kal\u00e1dgi 15, Belgaum 38, and Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r 29 inches.\n\nThe Konkan and the Gh\u00e1ts.\u2014This province extends from the Portuguese territory of Goa to the T\u00e1pti, and may be separated into two divisions which entirely differ from each other in physical conformation. The Konkan or marine division consists of a narrow, partly alluvial, strip, with a breadth of from 20 to 30 miles, and whose mean elevation is hardly more than 100 feet. Some parts of it are hilly and covered with jungle; many of the hills are isolated, but others are western projections from the Gh\u00e1ts. The more level country is open and well cultivated. The Gh\u00e1t division, or, to give it its proper appellation, the Sahy\u00e1dri range, is a continuous chain of flat-topped hills beginning abruptly in the T\u00e1pti Valley, where they suddenly rise to an elevation of at least 2,000 feet, and extending almost directly southwards to Malab\u00e1r. In some places, as at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, the hills attain a height of nearly 5,000 feet, but the mean elevation of the whole chain is scarcely more than 3,000 feet. Their western face is exceedingly precipitous, but to the east they slope gently into the plains of the Deccan. They are intersected by numerous valleys and ravines, at the bottom of which in the rainy season are raging torrents. The range, throughout its entire extent, is clothed from foot to summit with the densest vegetation, that growing in the valleys and ravines rising to the dignity of forest. At the northern extremity the unhealthy district known as the D\u00e1ng is covered with magnificent timber. The geological formation of the province is trap and laterite; the districts bordering the sea are, however, more or less alluvial, being formed in great part of the debris washed down from the hills by the monsoon rains. In the extreme southern portion metamorphic rocks begin to make their appearance, and these are continuous with the formation of the Goa territory and of North K\u00e1nara. Its climate may be classed as decidedly humid, not only from the abundant rainfall taken by the mountain chain from the south-west monsoon, but also by its proximity to the ocean, the sea breeze during the dry season tempering and rendering moist what would, in its absence, be an arid climate. The province enjoys,\ntoo, a singularly equable temperature, ranging from $74^\\circ$ in the cold season to $88^\\circ$ in the hot season. Along the higher Gh\u00e2ts, however, the temperatures are much less, at Mah\u00e1baleshvar it is only $71^\\circ$ in the hot and $64^\\circ$ in the cold weather. The rainfall increases gradually from the sea level to the summit of the Gh\u00e2ts: at Bombay the average fall is 75 inches; at Ratn\u00e1giri, elevated 150 feet, it is 108; at Thana 91; at M\u00e1ther\u00e1n 175; at D\u00e1poli 135; and at Mah\u00e1baleshvar it reaches its maximum, 254 inches. Towards the Deccan the rainfall rapidly decreases, and at P\u00e1nchgani, 4,000 feet above the sea and 14 miles east of Mah\u00e1baleshvar, it is only 50 inches. The moist atmosphere and abundant rainfall will thus account for the great luxuriance of the vegetation of this province; even at the driest season of the year it is more or less green, the country never presenting that burnt up arid appearance so generally observed at this period in the provinces previously described.\n\nK\u00c1NARA.\u2014This province resembles in some respects the southern parts of the Konkan, from which it is separated by the Portuguese possessions. It is bounded on the east by the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r district and on the south by Mysore. The surface of the country is more or less hilly and covered with a luxuriant tropical vegetation. The marine alluvial strip is narrower than that of the Konkan, and presents a similar aspect. In the eastern and elevated two-thirds of the province are situated the most valuable and extensive forests in the Bombay Presidency. The geological formation is, like that of the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, all metamorphic. The temperature does not differ from that of the Konkan. The rainfall at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r is 98 inches, and at Sirsi, above the Gh\u00e2ts, it is 89 inches. The province, from its greater nearness to the Equator, possesses a more humid climate than the Konkan, which fact, taken with the high and equable temperature, is sufficient to account for the predominance of heavier forest and the moisture-loving types of tropical vegetation. Except in the latter half of the dry season, the climate in the forest districts is well known to be exceedingly malarious, resembling in this respect the climate of the D\u00e1ng and of the eastern districts of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nThe foregoing sketch of the climate and leading physical features of Western India is necessarily very incomplete; on these matters fuller information will no doubt be obtained from the articles on geology and meteorology. I shall now proceed to give a somewhat detailed exposition of our indigenous natural orders, noticing too, in their proper places, the more important and best known of the naturalised and cultivated species, belonging to these and other orders, which are found growing on this side of India. It will be a more convenient plan to take this part of the subject with reference to the Presidency as a whole than to describe the flora of each province separately; such an arrangement as the latter would involve much needless repetition, and would besides unreasonably lengthen the article.\n\nIn Dicotyledons, the first great class of the vegetable kingdom, the following natural orders of the Bombay flora are included:\n\nRANUNCULACEAE is represented in Western India by only seven indigenous species. It is essentially an order of temperate countries, its Indian\nspecies being found chiefly in the mountainous regions to the north. The few Bombay members of the family are confined mostly to the Gh\u00e2ts and neighbouring parts of the Deccan. *Clematis*, a genus of climbing shrubs, has four representatives: *C. smilacifolia* occurs on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts and in various parts of the Konkan; *C. triloba*, a handsome species, and *C. Gouriana* are common climbers in the Gh\u00e2t jungles, the latter bearing a considerable resemblance to the British plant *C. vitalba* or \"Traveller's joy.\" *C. Wightiana* occurs at Mah\u00e1baleshwar. *Naravelia Zeylanica*, a climbing shrub, is found on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts; *Thalictrum Dalzellii*, a small stiff perennial herb, on some of the Deccan hills, and with it *Delphinium dasycaulon*, a plant with showy blue flowers. The latter also occurs in Abyssinia. None of the Bombay *Ranunculaceae* are distinguished by the possession of any peculiar properties or uses. The poisonous *Aconitum napellus* or Monkshood, with one or two other flowering members of the order, are sometimes to be seen in Bombay gardens, where the Larkspur, *Delphinium formosum*, is also a familiar plant.\n\n**Dilleniaceae.**\u2014Only two species of this order are known in Bombay. Both are middle-sized trees with splendid foliage. *Dillenia Indica*, found throughout the South Konkan, has large white flowers seven or eight inches across, a fleshy calyx possessing an acid flavour, and fruit the size of a cocoanut. The other species, *D. pentagyna*, occurs on the Gh\u00e2ts, in Kh\u00e2ndesh, and in the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country; the small yellowish green flowers, which appear before the leaves, are arranged in clusters along the lesser branches; the small fruit is edible. This order is widely distributed; it occurs abundantly in Australia, and is found also in the Eastern Islands, in many parts of India, in Madagascar, Africa, and America.\n\n*Michelia Champaca*, a member of the *Magnoliaceae*, an order nearly allied to the preceding, is a tall handsome tree with fragrant pale yellow flowers. It is indigenous to other parts of India, but is only found cultivated in Bombay.\n\n**Anonaceae.**\u2014About half the species of this tropical natural family occur in India: a large proportion are found in tropical America, and the remainder in tropical Africa and the Indian Archipelago. Out of 191 Indian species no more than seven or eight are indigenous to Bombay, all these latter being, without exception, natives of the Konkan and Gh\u00e2ts. *Uvaria narum*, a climbing shrub with reddish flowers, is found on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *Unona pannosa* a tree, *U. discolor* a shrub, and *U. Lawii* a climber, occur in S\u00e1vantv\u00e1di. *Polyalthia fragrans*, a tree with long leaves and fragrant yellow flowers, is found in the same locality. *P. cerasioides*, a tree with green flowers and cherry-like fruit, is found in the Northern Konkan and on the neighbouring hills. *P. longiflora*, a tall handsome tree with very beautiful foliage, and a native of Southern India, is now to be seen in many parts of this Presidency. *Succopetalum tomentosum* is a large tree growing on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. None of the indigenous species of this order are noted for any useful or ornamental quality. Among the naturalised species may be mentioned *Anona squamosa*, the well-known Sweetsop, said to be indigenous to the Malay Islands, but more probably a native of tropical America; *A. reticulata*, the Custardapple or Bullock's heart, and *A. muricata*, the Soursop, are natives of the West Indies, and along with the first are much cultivated here for their fruit. *Artabotrys odoratissimus*, a climbing shrub, a native of Bengal, is grown in Bombay gardens for the sake of its fragrant green flowers.\n\n**Menispermaceae.**\u2014Thirty-five species of this tropical order, or about one-third, are described as belonging to India, the remainder being found prin-\ncipally in tropical Africa and America. Only nine occur in Bombay, all which are common to other parts of India. They are climbing shrubs, generally with heart-shaped leaves, small green flowers, and red fruit. *Tinospora Malabarica* and *T. cordifolia* are found throughout the South Konkan, but the latter is also distributed to Kh\u00e1ndesh and the moister parts of Gujar\u00e1t; it grows in the most luxuriant manner on Malab\u00e1r Hill. *Anamirta cocculus*, the fruit of which is known as *Cocculus Indicus*, is a large climber with broad shining leaves and black fruit, very common in the South Konkan and in K\u00e1nara. *Cocculus macrocarpus* is a common M\u00e1ther\u00e1n climber with sea-green leaves and bunches of white fruit resembling grapes. *C. villosus* abounds everywhere; it occurs in all the botanical provinces of Western India, and extends to tropical Africa. *Stephania hernandifolia*, found in the Konkan, is indigenous also to Africa and Australia. *Cissampelos Pareira*, a large Konkan climber, is said to occur not only in Africa, but in tropical America. *Cyclea Burmanni* is a Gh\u00e1t climber, and *C. pellata* is universal throughout the Presidency. The plants of this order possess narcotic and tonic properties. The uses of *Cocculus Indicus* are familiar to most people. The root of *Tinospora cordifolia*, known as \u201cgalancha,\u201d is in common use here as a tonic and antiperiodic.\n\n**Nymphaeace\u00e6.**\u2014Three species of this aquatic order, noted for its beautiful flowers, are found in Bombay. *Nymphaea lotus*, which closely resembles in appearance the British *N. alba*, the white Water Lily, is common in the larger tanks throughout the Presidency: it is found in Africa, Hungary, and other places; its large handsome flowers, appearing after the rains, vary in colour from red or rose to white. *N. stellata* is quite as common as the preceding, but its flowers are somewhat smaller, and are blue, white, rose, or purple. *Nelumbium speciosum* occurs throughout India, in Persia, China, Australia, and Africa; it is extinct in Egypt. Its flower is said to be the \u201cLotus\u201d of Egyptian and Indian monuments, and its fruit the Pythagorean bean. In the Ajanta paintings the flower and leaf are frequently represented. The plant may be seen growing to perfection in a tank near the Th\u00e1na Railway Station. It is easily distinguished from *Nymphaea* by its leaves being always raised above the surface of the water, while those of the other invariably float. The flowers are much larger and are white or rose-coloured; the fruit, about the size of a nut, is eaten, as are also the roots, in Sind.\n\n**Fumariace\u00e6.**\u2014Nearly all the Indian species of this order are natives of the Him\u00e1layas. Only one, *Fumaria parviflora*, is found in Bombay. It is a common weed in cultivated lands in the Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh. The chief interest which attaches to it is due to the fact that it is also a British plant.\n\nThe Natural Order **Papaverace\u00e6**, closely allied to the preceding, is represented in Bombay by two naturalised species,\u2014namely, *Papaver somniferum*, the opium poppy, cultivated in some districts of Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t, and *Argemone Mexicana*, a native of America, but now naturalised in India and diffused over the whole country. In many parts of the Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh the latter plant is a perfect pest to the cultivators. It may be recognised by its bright yellow flowers and prickly thistle-like leaves.\n\n**Crucifere.**\u2014This large order chiefly inhabits temperate climates. Most of the Indian species are found in the Him\u00e1layas. One example only, *Cardamine hirsuta*, a small plant with yellow flowers, occurs in this Presidency\u2014near Belgaum and in parts of Gujar\u00e1t. Like the solitary species of the *Furmariace\u00e6*, it also is a British weed. *Raphanus sativus* the\nRadish, *Lepidium sativum* the Cress, *Nasturtium officinale* the Watercress, with several varieties of *Brassica* the Cabbage, Turnip, and Cauliflower, are cultivated in many parts of the Presidency.\n\n**Capparideae.**\u2014The plants of this order are largely distributed to India, tropical Africa and America. It is important to note that a great proportion of the Indian species extend into tropical Africa\u2014one of the many indications of the close botanical affinity existing between that country and India. About twenty species of the order are indigenous to Bombay, the majority of which are also African. *Cleome monophylla*, *C. viscosa*, *C. simplicifolia*, *C. Burmanni*, and *C. chelidonii* are all common annual weeds in the Deccan and Kh\u00e1nadesh. The first grows also in Cutch, and *C. viscosa* is very abundant in the Konkan. *Gynandropsis pentaphylla* is found everywhere. *M\u00e6rua arenaria*, a climbing shrub with fruit shaped like a string of beads, is common in the drier parts of the Deccan, Kh\u00e1nadesh, and Gujar\u00e1t. *Crataeva religiosa*, a small tree with handsome white flowers, is distributed to the moister parts of Kh\u00e1nadesh and Gujar\u00e1t, and to the Konkan and K\u00e1nara. *Cadaba Indica* is a small shrub found in Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan. *Capparis*, a genus of thorny shrubs and climbers, gives eleven or twelve species to the Presidency flora. Of these *C. Heyneana*, *C. Moonii*, *C. Roxburghii*, *C. tenera*, and *C. horrida* are found principally on the Gh\u00e1ts and in the moister districts; the last is by far the most common. *C. pedunculosa* is very abundant in Kh\u00e1nadesh and in the North Konkan. *C. Zeylanica*, *C. divaricata*, and *C. sepiaria* are plentiful in the Deccan. *C. spinosa*, a shrub, is common along the higher Gh\u00e1ts. A variety of this plant, found in the south of Europe, is the source of Capers. *C. grandis* is a small tree growing in the moister parts of the same district. *C. aphylla*, a thorny shrub with deciduous leaves and cherry-like fruit, is found only in the driest places in the Deccan, Kh\u00e1nadesh, Gujar\u00e1t, and Cutch. It is especially characteristic of the northern sandy localities of Gujar\u00e1t, and is widely diffused over the arid districts of Persia, Arabia, and Africa.\n\n**Violaceae.**\u2014One species only, *Ionidium suffruticosum*, a small plant with red flowers, is known in Western India. It is common in the South Konkan and in the Belgaum hills, and spreads to Australia. Many other species of the order are found in Eastern India. The violet, *Viola odorata*, may be seen in gardens at Poona, M\u00e1ther\u00e1n, and Mah\u00e1baleshwar.\n\n**Bixineae.**\u2014The plants of this order are natives of the hot moist parts of India, Africa, and America. About one-third of the known species are distributed to India and the neighbouring tropical countries, many of them extending to the Eastern Islands and one or two to Africa. Seven species are known in Western India; they are all trees of small size, and are usually thorny. *Scolopia crenata* is found on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. *Flacourtia montana*, *F. cataphracta*, *F. Ramontchi*, and *F. sepiaria* are very common on the Gh\u00e1ts; their fruits are generally eaten. The third extends to tropical Africa. *Hydnocarpus Wightiana*, bearing a large rugged woody fruit, is plentiful in the South Konkan; its seeds furnish an oil like Chaulmogra oil, which is much used in the treatment of leprosy. *Ochlospermum gossypium*, a member of a widely spread tropical genus, is a small tree with bright yellow flowers which appear before the leaves. It often occurs in the Deccan and Kh\u00e1nadesh near villages; it is said, however, to be a doubtful native, but I have seen it unquestionably wild in the Eastern Kh\u00e1nadesh hills. *Bixa Orellana*, from the seeds of which the red Anatto dye is prepared, is a native of Brazil, but is now a common shrub or small tree in Bombay and its neighbourhood. The cli-\nmate here seems to agree with it so well that its cultivation, for the preparation of the dye, would doubtless prove a lucrative enterprise.\n\n**Pittosporaceae.**\u2014Two species of this small order are found along the Gh\u00e2ts and in K\u00e2nara,\u2014*Pittosporum floribundum* and *P. dasycaulon*. They are both small trees, the former with yellow and the latter with white flowers. The plants of this order are almost entirely distributed to Australia.\n\n**Polygaleae.**\u2014This is one of the most widely distributed natural families. There are 34 species found in India, five or six of which are indigenous to Bombay. *Polygala persicariifolia* occurs on the Gh\u00e2ts and in the Deccan and is distributed to Africa and Australia; *P. eriopetra* in Gujar\u00e2t, and spreading to Arabia and Africa. *P. elongata* is found in K\u00e2thiaw\u00e2r, the Konkan and K\u00e2nara. *P. chinensis* is common in Gujar\u00e2t, the Deccan, and the Konkan, and extends also to Australia. *Salomonia ciliata*, a small annual like the four preceding species, is found throughout the Konkan. This order is chiefly remarkable for the wide range taken by its species.\n\n**Caryophyllaceae.**\u2014Of this large order more than one hundred representatives are found in India; nearly all are natives of the temperate Himalayan regions, many of them, however, ranging widely into Northern Asia and Europe. Only three, all annual plants, are as yet known to belong to the Bombay flora:\u2014*Saponaria vaccaria*, a weed of cultivation found all over India, is common in parts of the Konkan; *Arenaria Nilgerrensis*, a member of a large genus distributed to temperate and cold regions, occurs in the Southern Deccan; *Polycarpaea corymbosa* is found in Gujar\u00e2t, Cutch, the Konkan, and the Deccan; it exists also in most other parts of India, and in Africa, Australia, and America. *Dianthus caryophyllus*, the Carnation or Clove Pink, a native of Europe, and a well-known ornament of our gardens in Bombay, belongs to this family.\n\n**Portulacaceae.**\u2014Two or three species of this small but widely diffused order are indigenous to all parts of the Presidency. One of them, *Portulaca oleracea*, is a cosmopolitan annual with fleshy leaves, eaten as a salad or pot-herb and cultivated or indigenous in most warm climates. *P. quadriflora* has yellow flowers, like the preceding, and is an equally common annual. *P. tuberosa* occurs in Cutch. Another member of the same genus, an American plant with showy variegated flowers, is now abundant in Bombay gardens.\n\n**Tamaricaceae** is a small order commonly found in the hot arid regions of the northern hemisphere. *Tamarix ericoides*, a low shrub resembling a small Cypress, with heath-like flowers, inhabits the beds of the Gujar\u00e2t, Konkan, Deccan, and Kh\u00e2ndesh rivers. *T. dioica* is found in similar situations in Cutch and parts of Gujar\u00e2t. Four or five additional species are indigenous to Sind and other districts of India. One of these, *T. gallica*, extends to the South of Europe and to Northern and tropical Africa.\n\n**Elatineae.**\u2014Of this very small but widely distributed family three species are known in Western India. *Bergia odorata*, *B. ammannioides*, and *B. verticillata* are small plants, and uninteresting except for their very extensive range of distribution. The first is common in Gujar\u00e2t and extends into Egypt and tropical Africa. The two latter are aquatic, growing in and near tanks throughout the Presidency; they have an equally extensive range, the second being found as far as Australia.\nGUTTIFER\u00c6.\u2014This exclusively tropical, moisture-loving, order is common in the warmest parts of Asia and America, but is rare in Africa. Between 60 and 70 species belong to India, eight of which are to be found in this Presidency. They are all trees with beautiful dark-green abundant foliage, and usually showy flowers. *Garcinia Indica*, well known here as Kokam, is a common tree in the sheltered Gh\u00e1t and Konkan valleys from Khand\u00e1la to K\u00e1nara. This most graceful of trees bears fruit the size of a small orange; from the seed the concrete oil called Kokam is obtained, and the acid rind is an indispensable ingredient of native curries. *G. Xanthochymus* and *G. ovalifolius* are both elegant trees common on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. The gum-resin, Gamboge, is the produce of *G. Morella*, a native of Southern India and Ceylon. Many unsuccessful attempts have been made to cultivate in Bombay the Mangosteen, *G. mangostana*; nothing but a small stunted bush has been the result. *Ochrocarpus longifolius*, a handsome middle-sized tree, with white and red flowers, which are used for dyeing silk, is frequent in the Konkan and K\u00e1nara. *Calophyllum inophyllum*, a small crooked tree with shining foliage and showy white and yellow flowers, and *C. Wightianum*, which much resembles it, abound in the South Konkan and K\u00e1nara. *C. tomentosum*, a tall tree which yields one variety of Poon spars, is very common in the K\u00e1nara forests. The first mentioned species is widely distributed through Polynesia and extends to Madagascar and Mauritius. *Mesua ferrea*, found in the South Konkan, is a most beautiful tree with large, fragrant, pure white flowers; it is known in Bombay as \u201cN\u00e1g Ch\u00e1mpa.\u201d\n\nDIPTEROCARPE\u00c6.\u2014An order of tropical Asia. Ninety-one species, more than half the whole number, are described as belonging to India, Burma, and Ceylon. They are mostly large resinous trees, some of them producing valuable timber. This Presidency boasts of but one representative, *Anoistrocladus Heyneanus*, a handsome scandent shrub with white flowers; it is found along the Gh\u00e1ts from Khand\u00e1la southward. The absence of this order from Western India is somewhat remarkable; it is principally distributed to Eastern Bengal, Southern India, Ceylon, and Burma. *Shorea robusta*, the Sal, a valuable timber tree, also yielding one of the varieties of \u201cdammar,\u201d is abundant in the Central Provinces, and is found close to the confines of Kh\u00e1ndesh.\n\nMALVACE\u00c6.\u2014The plants of this large order are very abundant in all warm regions, and are comparatively common in temperate climates. About ninety species belong to India, more than one-third of these being indigenous in the Bombay Presidency. They vary in size from small herbs to lofty trees. One genus of the order, *Gossypium*, may perhaps be regarded as the most valuable to man of the whole vegetable kingdom. Among the species indigenous to Bombay are *Malva rotundifolia*, a small plant found in the Deccan near villages, and extending throughout India into Europe; five species of *Sida*, all of them small herbs with yellow flowers, are common in most places here and are distributed generally throughout the tropics of both hemispheres. Of *Abutilon* there are also five species, small shrubby plants with yellow flowers, found everywhere. *A. muticum* and *A. ramosum* occur in Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war; the former also in the Deccan where its seeds were much used as food by the poorer classes during the late period of famine. *A. Asiaticum* and *A. \u00cdndicum* furnish useful fibres. The latter extends to Africa and Australia. *A. striatum* is a common flowering shrub in gardens. *Malachra capitata*, a tall rough annual, a native of tropical America, now grows abundantly in waste ground in the neighbourhood of Bombay. A most valuable fibre, for which the plant is well worthy of cultivation, may be obtained from it. There\nare two species of *Urena*, small plants with rose-coloured flowers, very common and distributed also to the tropics of Africa and America. *Pavonia Zeylanica*, belonging to a large South American genus, is found in Gujar\u00e1t, and *Decaschistia trilobata* in the Konkan, on the Gh\u00e1ts, and in the Deccan; both are uninteresting shrubby plants. The first is widely spread throughout the tropics. *Hibiscus* is an important and widely diffused genus of about 150 species, extending to tropical Africa, America, Australia, and Polynesia. Nineteen or twenty species are indigenous to Western India, almost all of them being tall, rough, hairy annuals bearing large yellow flowers with a purple centre. *H. punctatus*, *H. intermedius*, *H. micranthus*, and *H. panduriformis* occur in Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, the third also extending into the Deccan. The remaining species are found in the Konkan, on the Gh\u00e1ts, and in K\u00e1nara. *H. cannabinus* is cultivated as a pot-herb, while from its stems is procured the \"amb\u00e1di\" fibre. *H. sabdariffa* is the well-known Rozelle. *H. abelmoschus*, recognised by the musky odour of its seeds, is also cultivated. The fruit of *H. esculentus* is the familiar vegetable, Bhendi. This plant is not known in a wild state, but is, in all probability, originally a native of India. *H. tiliaceus* is a small tree with broad heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers growing in the Konkan; it is also a common sea-coast tree of Australia and the Pacific Islands. A few years ago it was brought with some other plants from Sydney, whence its present frequency in Bombay gardens. *H. mutabilis*, *H. liliflorus*, *H. eriocarpus*, and *H. Rosa-sinensis*, the shoe-flower, shrubs with showy red or rose-coloured flowers, are abundant in gardens in all parts of the Presidency. *Thespesia lampas*, growing profusely on the Gh\u00e1ts, is a small shrub with large showy yellow flowers, appearing in the rainy season. *T. populnea*, the common Bhendi, seen everywhere, is a small tree bearing flowers similar to the last. Both these species are distributed to the Indian Archipelago and to tropical Africa, and the latter, in addition, to Australia. *Gossypium Stocksii*, the wild Cotton, is a straggling and sometimes, under certain circumstances, a climbing shrubby plant with small, deeply five to seven-lobed leaves, and yellow flowers an inch long, which gradually change to rose-colour before they wither; the cotton on the seeds is of a yellow hue. It is found truly wild in the Deccan, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Sind. There is hardly a doubt that this plant is the wild form of *G. herbaceum* and consequently the parent of the common kinds of Indian cultivated cotton. Some varieties of *G. Barbadianse*, the parent of the American cottons known as Barbadoes, Sea-Island, Orleans, and Bourbon, have been experimentally cultivated in this Presidency. *Kydia calycina*, a tree with heart-shaped leaves and numerous white flowers, is common on the Gh\u00e1ts. *Bombax Malabaricum*, the Red silk-cotton tree, a lofty spreading tree with prickly trunk and large scarlet flowers, is common in all the forests of the Presidency from Gujar\u00e1t and Kh\u00e1ndesh to K\u00e1nara; it extends throughout most of the hot forest regions of India, and is also indigenous to Australia. *Eriodendron anfractuosum*, another large tree, similarly distributed in this country, and extending into Africa and tropical America, has small greenish white flowers; it is known as the White silk-cotton tree. *Adansonia digitata*, the Baobab, an extraordinary looking tree with an immensely thick trunk but a small head, occurs about villages in the Konkan and near the Mahomedan cities of the Deccan; it is a native of tropical Africa. *Althea rosea*, the Hollyhock, a native of Europe, is a common ornamental plant of Bombay gardens.\n\n**Sterculiaceae.**\u2014This is a widely diffused tropical order, occurring abundantly in Asia and extending into Africa, Australia, and America. About ninety species are found in India, the Bombay flora possessing sixteen or eighteen of these. The largest and most important genus is *Sterculia*, many members of which are indigenous to tropical America. The\nBombay species are all large trees, common in the moist forest districts. *S. f\u00e6tida*, a tall erect tree, occurs in the K\u00e1nara forests, but does not appear to be indigenous north of that province; it yields one variety of Poon spar. This tree is common in the Eastern Archipelago. *S. urens*, a large spreading crooked tree with white papery bark, abounds on the Northern Gh\u00e1ts, in the D\u00e1ng, and in the Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t forests; it yields a large quantity of gum resembling tragacanth. *S. villosa* and *S. guttata* are abundant on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara; from the bark of the latter, cloth is made in Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r. *S. colorato*, a tall tree with red flowers, is common in the Gujar\u00e1t and Kh\u00e1ndesh forests and on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e1ts. *S. alata*, another lofty tree, occurs in K\u00e1nara. *Kleinhowia hospita* is a small straight tree with rose-coloured flowers found in the Konkan. *Helicteres isora*, a widely distributed shrub or small tree with red flowers and curiously twisted cylindrical fruit, is common in the Gujar\u00e1t forests and in the Deccan; it extends to the Indian Archipelago and to Australia. A useful fibre may be obtained from its bark. *Pterospermum acerifolium*, a low much-branched tree with splendid foliage, large white fragrant flowers, and woody fruit shaped like a small cocoanut, is common in the Konkan near Bombay; it is doubtful, however, whether the tree is really indigenous. *P. Heyneanum*, a species somewhat resembling the first in appearance, grows on the Gh\u00e1ts towards the south and in the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country. *P. suberifolium*, smaller than either, has very fragrant white flowers and is abundant in the Konkan jungles. *Briotiana Candollei* is a common tree on the Gh\u00e1ts, and *Melochia velutina*, a fast-growing tree with a profusion of small pink flowers, abounds everywhere. *M. corchorifolia* and *Waltheria Indica* are two widely diffused tropical weeds; in this Presidency they extend from Gujar\u00e1t to K\u00e1nara. *Buettinaria herbacea* is a common Bombay weed. A few specimens of *Guazuma tomentosa*, a native of tropical America and a small but elegant fast-growing tree with handsome foliage, may be seen in Bombay and its vicinity. In South India it is extensively planted. The most important member of this order, *Theobroma cacao*, the Cocoa tree, a native of tropical America, was formerly to be found in many Bombay gardens. It now, however, appears to have become extinct on this side of India.\n\n**Tiliace\u00e6**\u2014The species of this order are abundant in the tropics both of the Old and New Worlds, and comparatively so in temperate regions. About one-third belong to the Flora Indica, and of these nearly thirty are to be found in Bombay. Many plants of the order produce valuable fibres, others yield pleasant fruits. *Grewia* is a large and very widely diffused genus of trees and shrubs, of which about fourteen species, bearing white or yellow flowers, are found in Western India, principally in the Deccan and on the Gh\u00e1ts. *G. orientalis* is a common shrub on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts; it extends to Australia. *G. populifolia*, *G. orbiculata*, *G. Ritchiei*, *G. polygama*, and *G. Microcos* are all Konkan shrubs. *G. tiliacefolia* is a common tree in Bombay. *G. Asiatica*, a small tree with yellow flowers and edible fruit, is cultivated everywhere, and is found wild in the Deccan. Both the last-mentioned species are also indigenous to Africa. *G. pilosa* and *G. villosa* are also found in the Deccan. *G. carpiniifolia* and *G. abutilifolia*, both small trees, occur in the Deccan and in the Konkan. Fibres may be procured from the bark of all the members of this genus. *Erinocarpus Nimmoanus* is a small tree very abundant on the Gh\u00e1ts opposite Bombay; it bears showy yellow flowers and winged prickly fruit. *Triumfetta pilosa*, *T. rhomboidea*, and *T. rotundifolia* are common weeds everywhere south of Gujar\u00e1t; the two first extend into tropical Africa. *Corchorus* is an important and widely spread genus. *C. capsularis* and *C. olitorius*, from both of which Jute is obtained in Bengal, grow abundantly in the Konkan and in the moister parts of the Deccan. In the vicinity\nof Bombay they will reach a height of eight feet in sheltered situations on good soil, and will yield excellent fibre. *C. trilocularis*, *C. fascicularis*, and *C. antichoros* are found in the drier parts of the Presidency. *C. acutangulus* is a common Konkan weed. *Eleocharpus gonitrus*, a small tree of the Konkan and Ghats, bears purple fruit, the rough stone of which is used by religious mendicants for their necklaces. *E. oblongus* and *E. tuberculatus* are small trees found on the higher Ghats to the south. This is a large genus, abundant in India and the neighbouring islands; a few of its species occur in Australia.\n\n**Linaceae.**\u2014Of this, the Flax order, the greater number of species are natives of the South of Europe; several are, however, included in the Indian flora. *Linum Mysoreense* is a common annual about Bombay and in the Deccan. It is doubtful whether the Flax, *L. usitatissimum*, is indigenous to Western India, but it is extensively cultivated for its seed in Gujar\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and the Deccan. *Reinwardtia trigyna* and *R. tetragyna*, small shrubby plants bearing showy yellow flowers, are common in Bombay gardens, but are found wild on the Ghats. *Hugonia mystax*, a shrub with flowers like the last, occurs in the South Konkan and K\u00e1nara. Other members of the genus are natives of Western Africa.\n\n**Malpighiaceae.**\u2014This is a large tropical American order having but few Asiatic representatives. Only four species, all woody climbers, are known in Western India. *Hiptage Madablotia* is common in the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t jungles; it bears showy white and yellow flowers, which appear in the cold season, and winged fruit. *Aspidopterys cordata*, *A. Roeburghiana*, and *A. Canorensis* are smaller climbers than the last, found in the Konkan, and K\u00e1nara jungles. A native of the West Indies, *Malpighia coccifera*, is a frequent shrub in gardens; it resembles a miniature Holly. One species of *Galphimia*, a Mexican genus, and *Stigmaphyllon ciliatum*, another West Indian plant, are common climbers here; both have bright yellow flowers.\n\n**Zygophyllaceae.**\u2014A small tropical and sub-tropical order, widely diffused throughout warm regions, especially of Northern Africa. But two species are found in this Presidency, both inhabiting the drier districts. *Tribulus terrestris*, a small annual with yellow flowers and prickly three-angled fruit, is plentiful in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e1t, and Kathi\u00e1war; it extends into Australia, Arabia, Egypt, and tropical Africa. *Fagonia Ar\u00e1bica*, a shrubby spinous plant, occurs in similar localities.\n\n**Geraniaceae** inhabit the temperate, and to a less degree the tropical regions of both worlds. Some of the genera are confined to the northern, others to the southern hemisphere; a few may be termed cosmopolitan. About one-fifth of the order is included in the India flora, a large proportion of these being common to Europe and North Africa. The order is but scantily represented in this part of India. *Monsonia senegalensis*, a common weed with pink flowers, found in the Deccan, extends to Arabia, to North-Western India, and to portions of Southern Africa. *Oxalis corniculata*, a small spreading plant with yellow flowers, is common everywhere in cultivated land: it is the pest of Bombay gardens, and is also found in Europe, Africa, and Australia. *O. Acetosella*, the Wood-sorrel of England, although not found in Western India, may still be mentioned here as indigenous in all the temperate Himalayan regions. Another species with rose-coloured flowers may be seen in gardens, and is rapidly becoming a weed. *Biophytum sensitivum*, a common Konkan weed, extends throughout tropical Asia, Africa, and America. *Averrhoa carambola* and *A. bilimbi*, both small trees, are cultivated here for their acid fruit. Their native country is unknown. The large genus *Impatiens* has several re-\nrepresentatives in the flora of this Presidency. They are all annual plants with showy flowers, and appear only during the rainy season. The common garden Balsam is a cultivated variety of *L. balsamina*, a very variable plant and one of the commonest Bombay weeds, springing up everywhere at the first rainfall. The varying hue of the flowers in the wild species is no doubt due in many cases to their descent from a cultivated plant. After a couple of generations in its original habitat the best double variety will become single and take on the form of the wild parent plant. The remaining species are found in the Konkan and K\u00e1nara. A considerable proportion of the genus is distributed to the mountainous districts of Southern India. The cultivated varieties of *Pelargonium* and *Trop\u00e6olum*, so common in Bombay gardens, and so well known, belong to this order.\n\n**Rutace\u00e6.**\u2014The Bombay species of this important natural family will be most conveniently mentioned under the sub-orders in which they are classed. The solitary indigenous member of the sub-order *Ruteae* is *Peganum harmala*, a small plant with white flowers, occurring in the Deccan; it is supposed by some to have been introduced there by the Mahomedans. It occurs, too, in other parts of India and extends into the South of Europe. Although various species of the sub-order are found in this country, the main portion of it is distributed to Southern Europe, Africa, and Australia. *Ruta graveolens*, the evil-smelling Rue, is occasionally seen in Bombay gardens. The small sub-orders *Zanthoxyleae* and *Toddalieae* have several Indian representatives; but they are, however, chiefly distributed to tropical America and Australia. Only four species, all trees, are known in Western India. *Zanthoxylon rhetsa*, a prickly tree bearing small fruit which tastes like orange rind, and the seeds somewhat like black pepper, is found along the Gh\u00e2ts from Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 to K\u00e1nara. *Eodicia Roxburghiana*, a tree without prickles, with trifoliate leaves and white flowers, occurs in the same localities. *Toddalia aculeata* is a small prickly tree whose seeds also taste like black pepper; it grows along the Gh\u00e2ts and is abundant in K\u00e1nara. *Acronychia laurifolia*, a shrub with fragrant yellowish white flowers, occurs also on the Gh\u00e2ts. The small but important sub-order *Aurantiaceae* is almost entirely Indian. Fourteen or fifteen species are indigenous to this Presidency. *Glycosmis pentaphylla*, a small shrub with white flowers, is common in the Konkan; it is a very variable plant, as its numerous synonyms show. It extends to Australia. *Murraya exotica*, also Australian, and *M. Kenigii*, small trees with fragrant white flowers, are found on the Gh\u00e2ts. The first is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and the latter bears an edible fruit. *Clausena Indica* and *C. Willdenovii*, both shrubs, occur on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *Triphasia trifoliata*, a low thorny shrub with small crimson fruit, is said to be indigenous; this it almost certainly is not, being invariably seen here in gardens only and never wild. It is probably a Chinese plant. *Atalantia monophylla*, a climbing thorny shrub with delightfully fragrant white flowers, is common on the Gh\u00e2ts; it is especially abundant at M\u00e2ther\u00e1n. *A. racemosa*, which much resembles it, together with *Luvunga eleutherandra* and *Paramignya monophylla*, also thorny climbers, are found in the same localities. *Lemonia acidissima*, another thorny shrub, occurs on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *Feronia elephantum*, the Woodapple, a large spreading tree with leaves smelling of anise, and bearing a rough woody fruit the size and shape of a cricket ball, is very common in Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t. *Aegle marmelos* is a thorny tree with trifoliate leaves, and hard fruit resembling an orange in appearance; this is the well-known Bel fruit. The tree is found sparingly throughout the Konkan and K\u00e1nara, but is most abundant in the forests of Kh\u00e1ndesh and Eastern Gujar\u00e1t. The cultivated species of *Citrus* are to\nbe found in most parts of the Presidency, but principally in Bombay and the Deccan. The wild species from which they are derived are indigenous to Northern India, one or two of them to the Malayan Islands. *C. medica*, var. *medica*, is the Citron, var. *Limonum* of the same species is the Lemon, var. *acida* the Sour Lime, and var. *Limetta* the Sweet Lime. *C. aurantium*, var. *aurantium* is the common Sweet Orange, var. *Bigaradia* the Bitter or Seville Orange, and var. *Bergamia* the Bergamotte Orange. *C. decumana* is the common Pumelo or Shaddock.\n\n**Simarubeae.**\u2014This order, characterised by the possession of an intensely bitter principle, is distributed throughout most tropical regions, but chiefly to America, Africa, and the Indian Archipelago. The Bombay flora contains four or five species. *Ailantus excelsa*, a large tree with white bark, is comparatively frequent in Kh\u00e1ndesh, but is very common in Gujar\u00e1t. The bark possesses bitter antiprastic properties. *A. Malabarica* is common in K\u00e1nara. *Samadera Indica*, a small tree, is found in the same district. *Balonites Roxburghii* is a low thorny tree growing in Gujar\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and the Deccan. It occurs also in tropical Africa. *Quassia amara*, a native of Guiana, has lately been introduced into Bombay. This shrub is said to be the original source of the bitter drug, Quassia.\n\n**Ochnaceae.**\u2014A small order found chiefly in tropical America, Asia, and South Africa. Some of the Indian genera have representatives in Arabia. *Ochina pumila* is the sole species indigenous to Western India; it is a small shrub, with bright yellow flowers, found growing in the South Konkan. *O. squarrosa*, a native of Eastern Bengal, is a common shrub in Bombay gardens.\n\n**Burseraceae.**\u2014This small but very important family of resinous trees and shrubs is distributed to India, Arabia, Malacca, Eastern Africa, and tropical America. The different kinds of Olibanum, Bedellium, Myrrh, the Balm of Gilead, and other fragrant resins are yielded by plants of this order. Many of its species are as yet imperfectly known. The most interesting genus is *Boswellia*. *B. serrata*, the \"Salai\" of Central India, is the source of Indian olibanum, the true \"gugal\" of Sanskrit writers. It is a small crooked tree with whitish bark which separates in papery layers; it bears pinnate leaves and spikes of small pinkish-white flowers at the ends of the branches; the whole tree has a balsamic odour. It is very common on the S\u00e1tputa and Kh\u00e1ndesh hills and in Eastern Gujar\u00e1t, especially in the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da districts; but so far as I am aware it does not extend further south, in Western India at least, than the range of hills which forms the boundary between the Kh\u00e1ndesh and N\u00e1sik districts. In parts of Central India the tree is very abundant. The numerous varieties of frankincense and olibanum which are brought to Bombay from Aden are obtained from Arabian and African species of this genus. Three of these, introduced by Colonel Playfair, formerly Political Resident at Zanzibar, were described and named by Dr. Birdwood; they are still to be seen in the Victoria Gardens struggling to exist in this moist climate, so different from that of their native country\u2014arid Eastern Africa. It is doubtful whether *Balsamodendron mukul*, from which the common or \"byssa gugal\" of the Bombay bazar is obtained, is indigenous in any part of the Presidency except Cutch. Much of the \"gugal\" sold in Bombay is brought from the latter province. Several specimens of another member of this genus, described under the name of *B. Roxburghii*, are planted round a Hindu temple near the village of Peth in the Poona district, but where they were brought from cannot be discovered; it is said to occur wild in other districts of the Deccan and in Northern Kh\u00e1ndesh, but if so it must be exceedingly rare,\u2014I at least have never succeeded in finding it. It was for long suspected to be identical with the first mentioned species, but a\nrecent comparison would seem to point to the conclusion that it is a distinct species, or at least a well-marked variety. Further research on this vexed question is necessary. The fragrant resins, Myrrh and Balm of Gilead, are the produce of Arabian shrubs of this genus. *Garruga pinnata*, a tree with yellowish-white flowers and edible fruit, is found in all the moister parts of Western India\u2014cultivated no doubt in many cases. *Canarium strictum* is a tall tree with large leaves occurring along the Southern Gh\u00e2ts and in K\u00e2nara, as well as in the forest districts of Eastern Guj\u00e2r\u00e2t. It produces an aromatic yellow or brownish-yellow resin known as black dammar. Many other species of this imperfectly studied genus are indigenous to the Indian Archipelago and the neighbouring mainland. A few ill-grown specimens of *Felicium decipiens*, a tall tree of Southern India and Ceylon, are to be seen in Bombay gardens.\n\nThe small but important order *Meliaceae* consists of trees and shrubs, and is distributed to most parts of the tropics. About fifteen species are indigenous to Western India. *Turrea virens* and *Naregamia alata* are common Gh\u00e2t shrubs. *Melia azedarach*, the well-known Nim, is found in every district of India; on this side the tree reaches its greatest development in Guj\u00e2r\u00e2t. It is cultivated in many other parts of the world. *M. dubia* is a small Gh\u00e2t tree. *M. azedarach*, the Persian Lilac, a native of Northern India and of Persia, is a common cultivated fast-growing tree in Bombay. *Cipadessa fruticosa* is a shrub found on the Gh\u00e2ts and Deccan hills. *Amoora cucullata* and *A. Louvi* are Gh\u00e2t trees; other members of the genus extend to Australia. *Walsura piscidia* also occurs on the Gh\u00e2ts. The bark of this tree is used to poison fish. *Heynea triflora* is a small tree very common along the Gh\u00e2ts and in K\u00e2nara. *Soymida febrifuga*, a large and valuable timber tree, grows in the Kh\u00e2ndesh and Guj\u00e2r\u00e2t forests; its bark possesses a bitter antiperiodic principle. *Chickrassia tabularis*, another useful timber tree, is found in the South Konkan and K\u00e2nara. *Cedrela toona*, a large tree, yields a valuable wood resembling mahogany. It also is found in the same localities as the last and on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e2ts. It extends to Australia. *Chlorozylon Swietenia* is the Satin-wood; it is a small tree in this Presidency, but attains a large size in Ceylon and Southern India. It grows in the Ahmednagar district and about Belgaum and Gok\u00e2k. This order produces a number of choice timber trees. Mahogany is the wood of *Swietenia mahogoni*, a native of Central America, and now to be seen about Bombay. In Madras and Bengal some trees have already reached a considerable size. Many species of *Meliaceae* possess in addition tonic and antiperiodic properties.\n\n**Chailletieae.**\u2014A small order of tropical trees and shrubs with one representative in Western India. *Chailletia gelonioides*, a member of a widely spread genus, is a small tree found on the Gh\u00e2ts; it bears a fruit like a nutmeg, which is furnished with a similar red arillus.\n\n**Olacineae** is another small tropical family of which three or four species belong to the Bombay flora. The remainder are widely diffused throughout the tropics, a large proportion of them being indigenous to India. *Olaea Wightiana*, a climbing shrub with white flowers, *Mappia oblonga*, a small tree bearing fleshy yellowish-white flowers and purple fruit, and *Sarcostigma Kleinii*, a climbing shrub with bunches of orange-coloured fruit, are found on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. The first genus is distributed also to Africa and Australia, and the second has some tropical American representatives.\n\n**Ilicineae.**\u2014*Ilex Mulabarica* is the only member of this order known in the Bombay Presidency. It is a tree with shining leaves, small white flowers, and red berries, found growing on the Gh\u00e2ts. The order is distributed to Asia, South America, and South Africa. Several species occur in the Him\u00e2lay\u00e1s. The British Holly is *I. aquifolium*.\n**CELASTRIN\u00c6.**\u2014A widely diffused order found in most of the warmer parts of the globe. They are all trees or shrubs, often thorny. A considerable number of species are natives of India. *Euonymus Indicus* and *Pleurostylia Wightii* are shrubs found on the Ghats. *Lophopetalum Wightianum*, a small tree, occurs in K\u00e1nara. *Celastrus paniculata* and *Gymnosporia Rothiana* are common Gh\u00e1t and Konkan shrubs. *G. montana*, a variable species, grows very abundantly as a thorny shrub in the drier parts of the Deccan, Kh\u00e1ndesh, Gujar\u00e1t, and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war; it is distributed to Sind, Central Africa, the Indian Archipelago, and Australia. A small tree with yellow flowers, *Eleoedendron glaucum*, is found on the Ghats and in the moister parts of the Deccan hills. *Hippocratea Indica* and *H. Grahamii*, climbing shrubs, are among the commonest of Gh\u00e1t plants. Four or five species of *Salacia*, a widely diffused tropical genus, all shrubs, are found on the Southern Ghats and in the neighbouring parts of the Konkan. *S. prinoides* bears a cherry-like eatable fruit. Many plants of the order possess stimulant, emetic, and purgative properties.\n\n**RHAMN\u00c6.**\u2014These inhabit the temperate and tropical regions of every part of the world. Some of the genera are localised to particular countries, while others are extensively diffused. They are found in most parts of India, both in the mountainous districts and in the plains. About twelve species are natives of this Presidency. *Ventilago madraspatana* and *V. Bombaiensis*, both climbing shrubs with green flowers, grow on the Ghats. The first is common, too, in Gujar\u00e1t and extends to tropical Africa. *Zizyphus* is a large genus of thorny shrubs and trees scattered through many parts of the tropics. *Z. jujuba* is an exceedingly common tree in Western India and spreads to Australia and Africa; in Gujar\u00e1t and Kh\u00e1ndesh it is cultivated for its fruit. It is noted for the very fetid smell of its small green flowers. *Z. xylopyrus* much resembles the last in appearance; it is common on the Ghats and in the Konkan. *Z. rugosa* and *Z. oxoplia*, both thorny climbers, abound in the Konkan, Gh\u00e1t, and Deccan jungles; the former yields an edible fruit. *Z. nummularia*, a spreading shrub with hooked thorns, is found in the drier parts of the Presidency, and is especially plentiful in Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t, where it is much used for making fences. *Rhamnus Wightii*, the sole Bombay representative of a large widely spread genus, which extends to Great Britain, is a shrub found on the higher Ghats north of Bombay and in parts of the Deccan; its bark is used as a tonic. *Scutia Indica* is a very common thorny shrub at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. *Colubrina Asiatica*, a shrub with shining foliage and greenish-yellow flowers, abounds in the Konkan and on the Ghats. This genus is chiefly American, but our indigenous species is widely spread throughout the whole of the Old World tropics. *Gouania leptostachya*, a climber, occurs in the South Konkan. Green and yellow dyes are yielded by some plants of this order, while others produce agreeable fruits. Many possess a bitter purgative principle.\n\n**AMPELID\u00c6.**\u2014The Vine order. Its species abound in the tropics of Asia and Africa, but are more rare in those of America and in temperate climates. The cultivated Vine, *Vitis vinifera*, is supposed to be a native of Georgia and Mingrelia, and also of the Northern Him\u00e1layas. In this Presidency it is grown at Poona and in parts of Kh\u00e1ndesh. The genus *Vitis* contains about 230 species, spread over the tropics of both worlds. Between 70 and 80 are natives of India, in every part of which they are found. A great number, too, are indigenous to Africa. Sixteen or seventeen occur in Western India; these are all climbing plants with tendrils, small greenish flowers, and black, red, or white berries; they are common in all the moister parts of the Presidency, particularly near the sea. *V. quadrangularis*, a strange looking plant, often mistaken for a *Cactus*, is found in Gujar\u00e1t and along the coast; it may be recognised by its thick, fleshy,\nsquare stems, and small leaves. The species commonest in the Deccan are *V. glauca*, *V. setosa*, and *V. pedata*. *V. discolor*, a very handsome species, known by its deep green and purple, velvety leaves, is found in the shady Konkan ravines. *V. adnata*, *V. Indica* and *V. Rheedei* are the most frequent about Bombay. The remaining species occur chiefly in the Konkan and K\u00e1nara and along the Gh\u00e1ts. *Leea sambucina*, also an African and Australian species, is a handsome fast-growing shrub common in the Gh\u00e1t and Konkan jungles. *L. macrophylla* occurs on the Konkan hills.\n\n**Sapindaceae.**\u2014This large order is abundant in tropical regions, some of its genera being very widely diffused. Two or three of the Hym\u00e1layan genera spread as far as Great Britain, one of them to North America; several others, natives of the warmer districts, extend to Australia. A considerable number of species are indigenous to India, but of these hardly more than ten are to be found on this side. *Cardiospermum halicacabum*, a cosmopolitan tropical plant, is a common annual climber in the Konkan and other parts of the Presidency. It springs up everywhere during the rains and may be known by its small pinkish-white flowers, bladdery capsules, and black seeds which bear a white heart-shaped spot. The genus is principally American. *Hemigrossa canescens*, a tree with small white flowers, occurs on the Gh\u00e1ts. *Alophylus Cobbe* is a very variable species; consequently it is burdened with synonyms. According to soil and situation it is a small tree, a shrub, or a woody climber. It is found in the South Konkan, but is diffused also through the other moist parts of India, the Indian Archipelago, and Northern Australia; the genus has several American representatives. *Schleichera trijuga* is a common Gh\u00e1t tree occurring also in the Gujar\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and K\u00e1nara forests; it bears white flowers and prickly fruit, and is said to yield valuable timber. *Sapindus emarginatus* is a large tree common about villages in the Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh; it is, however, a doubtful native. *S. laurifolius*, a tree somewhat resembling the last, is to be found in all parts of the Presidency, where it appears to be truly wild. The three-lobed fruit of both trees is used as soap. By some these two are regarded as varieties of one species, namely, *S. trifoliatus*. The very marked difference, however, which is exhibited in general appearance and habit, and in the shape of the leaves, well seen when the trees grow near each other, renders it difficult to believe that they are not distinct species. The genus is diffused through all tropical countries. *Nephelium Longana*, a useful timber tree bearing edible cherry-like fruit, occurs on the Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. The Litchi fruit is the produce of *N. Lit-chi*, a Chinese tree sometimes found in Bombay gardens. *Dodonaea viscosa*, a shrub with clammy leaves and white flowers, is common on the Gh\u00e1ts and in the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country. The genus is chiefly Australian, but our indigenous species is cosmopolitan in the tropics. *Turpinia pomifera* is a small tree found on the Gh\u00e1ts to the south; it spreads to all the moister parts of India. Some plants of this order are remarkable for the possession of a saponaceous principle, others are stimulant and aromatic, and a few produce esteemed fruits.\n\n**Anacardiaceae.**\u2014No more than seven species, representing six genera, of this important and comparatively large tropical family, are indigenous on this side of India. They are, however, more abundant in the southern parts of the country. A large proportion of the order exists in tropical Africa and America, and one genus, *Rhus*, is found in North America, India, China, Australia, and South Africa. *Mangifera Indica*, the Mango, is too well known to need description. In this Presidency it attains its greatest size in the Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh. The finest specimens are to be seen at N\u00e1sik. In some parts of Kh\u00e1ndesh these splendid trees give to the landscape quite a park-like appearance. Many varieties are cultivated for their fruit; the best and most esteemed of these being found along the\nwestern coast. They have of late years been introduced into Queensland, where, judging by accounts recently received from thence, they appear to have become thoroughly acclimatised. In the West Indies and Mauritius the cultivated mango has long been known. *Buchanania latifolia*, a handsome forest tree with fragrant flowers and edible seeds, is found in all the forest districts, especially in K\u00e1\u0144ara, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Gujar\u00e1t. *Odina Wodier*, a large tree with white bark and spikes of small purple flowers, grows in almost every part of the Presidency. *Semecarpus anacardium*, the Marking-nut tree, is found in the Deccan, the Konkan, K\u00e1\u0144ara, and Gujar\u00e1t; its seeds are edible, and the acrid juice of its fruit is used for marking linen and as a vesicant. The tree is also indigenous to Australia. *Holigorna Arnottiana* is a useful timber tree found in K\u00e1\u0144ara; a fine black varnish is procured from its fruit. *H. Grahamii* occurs in the Konkan. *Nothopegia Colebroekiana* is a small tree growing on the Gh\u00e1ts and in the South Konkan. It bears white flowers and edible fruit. All the plants of this order yield an acrid resinous juice, which in some cases is a violent irritant poison. *Pistacia terebinthus*, the Chian turpentine tree, a native of Southern Europe, has lately been introduced into Bombay, where it seems to flourish exceedingly. *P. vera*, a Persian tree, yields Pistachio nuts. Cashew nuts are the produce of *Anacardium occidentale*, a Brazilian tree, now common in many parts of the Konkan, and no doubt introduced by the Portuguese. *Schinus molle*, the false Pepper, a small tree of tropical America, may be seen in Ganesha Khind Gardens. *Spondias mangifera*, a tree indigenous to many of the forest districts of other parts of India, has become pretty common about Bombay; its fruit is eaten.\n\n**Moringeae.**\u2014This order consists of but three species, two of which are indigenous to Western India and the third to Arabia and Eastern Africa. *Moringa pterygosperma*, known to Europeans in India as the Horse-radish tree, is found wild in Kh\u00e1ndesh\u2014in the forests along the base of the S\u00e1tp\u00fada range. In most parts of the Presidency it is planted near villages. Another species, *M. Concanensis*, occurs in the Konkan and in Sind; it has yellow flowers and larger leaves than the first, and may possibly be only a variety of *M. aptera*, which is found in Arabia, Egypt, and Eastern Africa. The two Indian species of this order possess in abundance the acrid pungent principle so characteristic of the *Cruciferae*. The root, scraped, of *M. pterygosperma* is always used in India as a substitute for Horse-radish, while its juice is occasionally employed as a vesicant. Ben oil, used by watchmakers, is said to be obtained from the seeds of *M. aptera*, and a similar oil may be expressed from those of *M. pterygosperma*. The latter tree yields a large quantity of gum, which is collected extensively by the Kh\u00e1ndesh Bhils.\n\n**Connaraceae.**\u2014A small order of trees and shrubs distributed to the tropics of Asia, Africa, and America. The two genera represented in the Bombay flora are common to all. Several species are found in other parts of India. *Rourea santonoides*, a climbing shrub with stiff shining leaves, occurs on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts; it extends also to Western Africa. *Concarus monocarpus*, a shrub with small yellowish-white flowers, leaves similar to the last, and long bright red fruit, together with *C. Wightii* and *C. Ritchiei*, is found in the same localities. The order is chiefly valuable for the ornamental wood yielded by some of its species. Oil is procured from the seeds of others.\n\n**Leguminosae.**\u2014This great family, containing upwards of 7,000 species, is probably the most important of the vegetable kingdom:\u2014whether we consider its numbers, variety of form, extensive distribution, or its manifold uses as food, in medicine, or in the arts. The order derives its name from the peculiar form of its fruit, by which character it may always be\nrecognised. Differences in the form of its flowers cause it to separate naturally into three sub-orders, viz., Papilionaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, and Mimosaceae. A familiar representative of the first would be *Erythrina Indica*, of the second *Cassia fistula*, and of the third *Acacia Arabica*. Papilionaceae are diffused over the greater part of the world, but are most abundant in warm regions and in the north temperate zone. Caesalpiniaceae are almost entirely confined to tropical regions, while Mimosaceae are pretty generally diffused throughout the tropics and the south temperate zone, being very rare in the sub-tropical parts of the northern hemisphere. There are 290 genera described as belonging to the first sub-order, 76 to the second, and 27 to the third. In Western India they occur in almost exactly the same relative proportions, while as regards distribution, Papilionaceae are pretty equably spread over the whole Presidency; with few exceptions Caesalpiniaceae are found most constantly in the Konkan, on the Gh\u00e2ts, and in K\u00e2nara; and Mimosaceae are best represented in the drier districts of the Deccan, Kh\u00e2ndesh, and Gujar\u00e2t. The Bombay flora possesses nearly twice as many specific representatives of Leguminosae as it does of any other natural family, while at the same time a large number of the species are extremely rich in individuals. At least 220 species are found on this side of India, a rather meagre proportion when it is remembered that the order contains altogether more than 7,000. Within the limits of the present paper it will be impossible to do more than merely allude to the greater number; a fuller notice will be taken in those cases only where the plants appear to possess qualities of sufficient interest.\n\nBelonging to Papilionaceae, the first sub-order, we have *Rothia trifoliata*, a small annual plant found sparingly in the Konkan. *Heylandia latibrosa*, the only member of the genus, is a spreading prostrate herb, exceedingly abundant in the Deccan. *Crotalaria* is a large tropical, principally African, genus of herbaceous plants, usually bearing showy yellow or purple flowers. The most important member of it, *C. juncea*, is extensively cultivated for its fibre, well known as San. *C. Burhia* and *C. Notonii* are found in the drier parts of Gujar\u00e2t and Kh\u00e2thi\u00e2war, and the remaining indigenous species, fully 30 in number, in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e2ts; several also occur in the Deccan. *Indigofera*, a second great tropical genus of annual plants, has at least 20 representatives in the Bombay flora. Most of these are found in the Konkan and a few spread into other districts of the Presidency. *I. linifolia*, *I. cordifolia*, and *I. glandulosa* abound in the Deccan, where their seeds prove valuable articles of food in seasons of scarcity. *I. tinctoria*, the plant from which indigo is obtained, grows wild in the Konkan. None of the remaining Bombay species possess any particular interest. Members of this genus, including several of our indigenous species, are especially numerous in tropical and Southern Africa. *Psoralia corylifolia*, an annual weed, abounds everywhere. *Millettia racemosa*, the single indigenous species, is a climbing shrub with large rose-coloured flowers, found near Belgaum and in the D\u00e2ng forests. Numerous species of the genus occur in other parts of India. *Mundulea suberosa*, a small tree, also bearing rose-coloured flowers, grows in the former locality; it extends into Eastern Africa. In this country its seeds are said to be employed for poisoning fish. Of the large genus *Tephrosia*, three species, shrubby or herbaceous plants, are common in the Konkan. One of these, *T. purpurea*, a cosmopolitan tropical plant, is plentiful also in Gujar\u00e2t and Cutch. *Sesbania aculeata* and *S. procumbens*, members of a very widely diffused tropical genus, are annual plants growing in great abundance near marshy ground in the Konkan; the first is plentiful also in the moister parts of the Deccan, Kh\u00e2ndesh, and Gujar\u00e2t; it spreads to Australia and Africa. *S. \u00c6gyptiaca* and *S. grandiflora*, fast-growing trees, probably not indigenous however, are common near Bombay. The latter bears beauti-\nful large white flowers, and its pods are eaten as a vegetable. Both trees appear to be natives of the Indian Archipelago. *Taverniera nummularia* is a small Deccan and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r shrub; it is widely distributed over the drier parts of Asia. *Geissopsis cristata* and one or two species of *Zornia* are minute annuals abundant in Deccan pastures; both genera are broadly dispersed, the first to tropical Africa, and the second to the Cape, Australia, and America. *Z. diphylla* is cosmopolitan in the tropics. *Alhagi maurorum*, the Camel thorn, is very common in the driest parts of Gujar\u00e1t. It occurs in all the arid sandy regions of India, Arabia, Syria, and Egypt, also in the south of Europe. Seven or eight species of *Smithia* are found on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in the adjoining parts of the Deccan; they are small herbaceous plants of no particular importance. *S. sensitiva* is exceedingly abundant in the Konkan. *Aeschynomene Indica*, an annual weed with yellow flowers, occurs in the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t; it is dispersed throughout the tropics of the Old World. *A. aspera*, a native of Bengal, furnishes the substance of which the common pith hats are made. *Pycnospora hedyaroides*, a small plant of the South Konkan, extends to China and Australia. *Pseudarthria viscosa* and *Urania picta* are also two small perennials of the South Konkan. Seven or eight species of *Alysicarpus*, all herbaceous plants, are common in the Konkan and the Deccan, the most abundant being *A. rugosus* and its varieties. The genus is represented, and by some of our Bombay species, both in Africa and Australia. Two or three extend to the Deccan. The solitary member of the genus *Ougeinia*, *O. dalbergioides*, is a large tree yielding a valued and durable timber. It bears a multitude of small pinkish white flowers and is common in the D\u00e1ng, S\u00e1tputa, and Gujar\u00e1t forests; it also occurs in K\u00e1nara. Several members of *Desmodium*, a large cosmopolitan genus of herbs and shrubby plants, scattered chiefly throughout the tropics, are found in the Konkan; numerous other species occur in various parts of India. *Abrus precatorius*, a well-known climbing shrub, easily recognised by its bright scarlet seeds, may be seen in all parts of the Presidency; its root is said to be used as a substitute for liquorice, but to this drug it has not, as far as my experience goes, the faintest resemblance. One variety of the plant has white seeds. The genus, and especially our indigenous species, is very extensively distributed through the tropics. *Cicer arietinum* is the common Gram or Chick-pea, and is cultivated in various temperate and tropical countries. *Shuteria vestita*, *Glycine pentaphylla*, and *Teramnus labialis*, members of small cosmopolitan tropical genera, are Konkan climbers. *Mucuna monosperma* and *M. pruriens* belong to a widely spread tropical genus of large climbing plants. Both species are abundant in all the moister districts of the Presidency; the latter is cosmopolitan in the tropics. They have dark purple, nearly black, flowers; the first bears a short thick pod, that of the second being curved like the italic letter *f*. The pods of both plants are covered with loose hairs, which come off at the slightest touch and produce the most intense irritation if allowed to fasten themselves to the skin. *Erythrina Indica*, a well-known tree of rapid growth, with a profusion of brilliant scarlet flowers which appear in January, is plentiful in all parts of the Presidency; it is found, too, in Australia and in many of the islands of Polynesia. A variety with white flowers grows in S\u00e1lsette. *E. stricta* and *E. suberosa* are both trees, also with scarlet flowers. The first is common along the Gh\u00e1ts and the other occurs in the K\u00e1nara, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Gujar\u00e1t forests. The genus is diffused throughout the tropics. A new species, *E. Australis*, has lately been introduced from Queensland and promises to be an acquisition to the naturalised flora of Bombay. *Grona Dalzellii* is a small Konkan climber, as is also *Galactia tenuiflora*; the latter is distributed to America, Australia, and Eastern Africa. *Butea frondosa*, a small crooked tree, covers large tracts of country in Kh\u00e1ndesh,\nEastern Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the Deccan; it bears abundance of showy scarlet flowers, which appear in February. An extensive jungle of this tree in full bloom presents a mass of colour the magnificence of which can hardly be surpassed. In the Konkan and K\u00e1nara it is comparatively infrequent. *B. superba* is a gigantic climber of the D\u00e1ng forests; it also bears large scarlet flowers. *Spatholobus Roxburghii*, another extensive woody climber with white or red flowers, occurs in the Konkan jungles. *Canavalia ensiformis* is a common Konkan herbaceous climber, of which there are several varieties both wild and cultivated; the pods are eaten as vegetables. The genus is widely distributed to tropical regions and has several American representatives. *Paeraria tuberosa*, a member of an Asiatic genus, is a twining shrub with showy blue flowers and an immense tuberous root which is sometimes eaten. The plant is common in the Konkan jungles. *Phaseolus* is a widely spread genus of herbaceous climbers, mostly tropical, many species of which are cultivated as pulse. Five or six are found wild in this Presidency, principally in the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t jungles. *P. trilobus*, also an African species, abounds in the Deccan. *P. vulgaris*, the kidney bean, is cultivated in Bombay; it is not known in the wild state, but is supposed to be a native of India. Amongst the other members of the genus which are commonly cultivated in Western India, *P. lunatus*, *P. aconitifolius*, *P. Mungo*, and *P. radiatus* are best known. All appear to be Indian plants. *Vigna vexillata*, a climber with a very extensive tropical distribution, is common in the Konkan north of Bombay. *V. catjang* is a well-known cultivated plant. *Oliorea ternata*, a cosmopolitan tropical species, and *C. biflora* are two very common plants during the rainy season; they have beautiful deep blue flowers. Two varieties of the first, which is a climber, have white and lilac flowers respectively. Two or three species of *Dolichos*, members of a widely diffused tropical genus of herbaceous twiners, occur in the Konkan jungles. *D. loblab*, as well as *D. biflorus*, are familiar cultivated species. Several species of *Atlylosia*, a genus common to India and Australia, are plentiful in the Konkan. One is a shrub and the others are small climbers usually with yellow flowers. *Cylista scariosa*, the solitary representative of the genus, is a very common climber; its large white membranous calyx makes it a conspicuous object in the Konkan jungles. *Rhynchosia*, a large tropical genus, gives at least two species to the Bombay flora. *R. minima*, a climber, abounds in the Deccan and Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t; it is cosmopolitan in the tropics. *R. cyanosperma*, a shrubby plant with yellow flowers and blue-black seeds, occurs somewhat sparingly on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. African varieties, with white or red flowers, are described. Several other species are indigenous to different parts of India. Four or five species of *Flemingia*, small shrubby or herbaceous plants, occur in the South Konkan. The genus is distributed to Asia, Africa and Australia. *Dalbergia* is a large and important genus of trees and woody climbers found chiefly in Asia and Africa, but extending also to the American and Australian tropics. Eight or nine species are known in Western India. The black heartwood of *D. sissoo* and *D. latifolia* is the Blackwood of Bombay. The first grows to a great size in the D\u00e1ng and Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t forests; the latter is commonest in K\u00e1nara and the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country. *D. confertiflora*, *D. Stocksii*, *D. sympathetica*, *D. volubilis*, and *D. monosperma* are Konkan and Gh\u00e1t climbers. *D. lanceolaria* and *D. paniculata* are timber trees of the Kh\u00e1n-desh and Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t forests; the latter also occurs in K\u00e1nara and on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e1ts. *D. melanozygon*, an African species, is found in Bombay and Poona gardens. *Pterocarpus marsupium*, a large handsome tree, occurs in most parts of the Konkan and in the D\u00e1ng and K\u00e1nara forests, also in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. The red astringent gum, called Kino, exudes from its bark, and its timber is hard and durable. The genus is\nwidely spread over India and extends to the tropics of Africa and America *Pongamia glabra*, the sole representative of the genus, is a well-known tree in every part of the Presidency. In Western India it attains its greatest size in Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t, where it is much planted about villages; it is found also in Australia and in some of the neighbouring islands. About six species of *Derris*, a scattered tropical genus of trees and woody climbers, are contained in the Bombay flora. *D. scandens* with *D. robusta*, *D. uliginosa*, *D. brevipes*, and *D. Heyneana* are Konkan climbers. *D. Canarensis*, an immense climber, may be seen stretching over the highest trees of the K\u00e1nara jungles; it bears a profusion of white flowers, and when in full bloom is a gorgeous plant. The first mentioned species is nearly as handsome. *Sophora Wightii*, a small shrub with yellow flowers, and belonging to a widely diffused tropical genus, occurs in the Deccan. *S. tomentosa*, probably indigenous also, is sometimes seen in gardens.\n\nHaving now disposed of the indigenous plants of *Papilionaceae*, the more important species, not previously mentioned, which are cultivated in Western India, may be noticed. Amongst these are *Pisum sativum*, the Pea; *Lathyrus sativus*, the Vetch; *Cajanus Indicus*, the Pigeon-pea; *Arachis hypogea*, the Ground-nut; *Medicago sativa*, the Lucern; *Cyamopsis psoralioides*, the \u201cGaur\u201d; *Ervum lens*, the Lentil; *Trigonella foenum-graecum*, the Fenugreek; and *Psophocarpus tetragonolobus*, the Chevaux-de-frise bean. The greater number of the cultivated *Papilionaceae* appear to have been originally natives of Egypt and Abyssinia; some of them are said to be still found wild in those countries; and in all parts of tropical and sub-tropical Africa they are largely cultivated.\n\nThe indigenous members of the sub-order *Caesalpiniae* are chiefly large trees and armed woody climbers; a few are small shrubs, or even annual herbs. At least six species of the widely diffused tropical genus *Caesalpinia*, four of which are thorny climbers, are found in various parts of the Presidency. *C. bonducella* may be seen everywhere, often planted however. It appears to be indigenous to all moist tropical countries, sometimes one, sometimes another being assigned as its original habitat. The seeds are asserted to possess antiperiodic properties. *C. Nuga*, *C. sepioria*, and *C. mimosoides* are thorny climbers of the Konkan jungles. The first has large yellow fragrant flowers. The second is commonest in the Deccan: it makes an excellent hedge plant. *C. Sappan*, a prickly shrub or small tree with bright yellow flowers, occurs in the South Konkan and K\u00e1nara. The heartwood furnishes a red dye. *C. pulcherrima* is a handsome shrub, with showy scarlet or yellow flowers, common in Bombay gardens. It is said to be a native of Arabia and Africa, whence it was introduced into India, but in the shady ravines of the Kh\u00e1ndesh hills I have seen it undoubtedly wild. *C. coriaria*, the Divi Divi, a native of tropical America, is now a rather common tree about Bombay. Its pods contain a large quantity of tannin. *Mezoneurum cucullatum*, a thorny climber, is common on the Gh\u00e1ts. *Poinciana elata*, a tree with white and yellow flowers, occurs wild in Gujar\u00e1t. *P. regia*, the Gulmohr, now so abundant in Bombay, is a native of Madagascar. A third species, from Chili, *P. Gillesii*, is sometimes seen in gardens. *Waagaea spicata*, the sole representative of the genus, is a thorny shrub with long spikes of scarlet and orange flowers; it is common in the Konkan, on the Gh\u00e1ts and in parts of Kh\u00e1ndesh. The great genus *Cassia*, containing nearly 400 species, is distributed to the tropics of both the Old and the New Worlds, and is especially abundant in America. India possesses several species: ten or twelve are found in this Presidency, some of them extending to Africa. *C. fistula* is familiar to most people; the tree is common in all the forest districts, from K\u00e1nara to Gujar\u00e1t, and\nis besides frequently planted near towns and villages. It may be easily recognised by its large hanging racemes of bright yellow flowers, which appear in the hot season, and by its long cylindrical pods. *C. occidentalis*, *C. sophera*, and *C. tora* are annual weeds with yellow flowers, abundant everywhere during the rains. They are cosmopolitan in the tropics. *C. auriculata* is a yellow-flowered straggling shrub very common in the drier parts of the Presidency, more especially in Kh\u00e2ndesh and Northern Gujar\u00e2t. *C. obovata*, one of the sources of Alexandrian Senna, is a common Gujar\u00e2t shrub. The Bombay Medical Stores are supplied with senna from *C. angustifolia* which, wild in Sind and Abyssinia, is cultivated at Ganesh Khind. *C. montana* is a Gh\u00e2t shrub, and *C. pumila* occurs in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e2t, and Outech. *C. absus*, another widely spread tropical species, is found in the Konkan. *C. glauca*, not indigenous to this side of India, is a common garden tree. *C. Sumatrana*, from the Eastern Archipelago, grows to a large size in the vicinity of Poona, where it is much used as a roadside tree. *C. bicapsularis*, a Brazilian shrub, may frequently be seen in Bombay gardens. *Cynometra ramiflora*, a member of a cosmopolitan tropical genus, is a small Konkan shrub. *Hardwickia binata*, an elegant tree furnishing valuable timber, occurs in Kh\u00e2ndesh and K\u00e2nara. *Saraca Indica*, a small tree with graceful drooping foliage and showy red and orange flowers, is plentiful throughout the Konkan. *Tamarindus Indica*, the Tamarind, is planted in every part of the Presidency. In Gujar\u00e2t and K\u00e2thi\u00e2war it grows to an immense size. Although usually spoken of as indigenous to India, its original home may with greater truth be ascribed to tropical Africa, from whence it has spread to both Asia and America. It is the only member of the genus; one of its varieties, however, being sometimes described as a distinct species, *T. occidentalis*, the West Indian or red Tamarind. *Bauhinia* is a large widely spread tropical genus, of which nearly forty species are natives of India; not more than five or six are indigenous here. *B. tomentosa* is a common ornamental shrub of Bombay gardens. *B. racemosa*, the sacred tree of the Dasara festival, is found everywhere. *B. Malabarica* is a small South Konkan tree. *B. Lavii* and *B. Vahlii* are Gh\u00e2t and Konkan climbers; the latter grows to a great size, overtopping the highest trees. *B. acuminata*, a shrub, and *B. purpurea* and *B. variegata*, both trees, all natives of other parts of India, are pretty common in Bombay. The two latter are often used as roadside trees.\n\nBesides the naturalised plants of this sub-order which have been already mentioned, there are still a few others requiring notice. *Peltophorum ferrugineum*, a tree with fragrant yellow flowers, a native of the Indian Archipelago, has recently been introduced. *Parkinsonia aculeata*, a thorny shrub or small tree with drooping branches and yellow flowers, from tropical America, abounds everywhere. *H\u00e6matoxylon campechianum*, the Logwood, a native of Central America, flourishes in Western India, where it might doubtless be profitably grown. *Schizolobium excelsum*, a large Brazilian tree, has been lately introduced into Bombay, where, so far, the climate appears to suit it perfectly. It promises to rival in magnificence the *Poinciana regia*.\n\nThe third sub-order\u2014*Mimosae*\u2014includes, like the preceding one, numerous useful trees and thorny climbers. *Neptunia oleracea*, a small annual plant, cosmopolitan in the tropics, is found in Konkan tanks. *N. triquetra*, another widely distributed annual, is common in pastures. *N. plena*, an American species, is common in wet ground near Bombay. *Xylia dolabriformis*, the only representative of the genus, is a valuable timber tree which abounds in the South Konkan and K\u00e2nara. *Entada scandens* is an immense climber with twisted stems, common along the Gh\u00e2ts. Its pods\nare frequently from three to four feet in length and four inches broad. This species occurs likewise in all the moist tropical regions of Africa, America, and Australia. *Prosopis spicigera*, a thorny tree, is abundant in parts of the Deccan and in Kh\u00e1nadesh, Gujar\u00e1t, and Cutch. It extends through Sind to Persia. *Dichrostachys cinerea*, known by its heads of yellow and rose coloured flowers, is a common shrub in the same parts of the Presidency. *Mimosa rubicaulis* and *M. hamata*, belonging to a large American genus, are both thorny shrubs, common, the first in the Konkan, and the second in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e1t, and Cutch. *M. pudica*, the Sensitive Plant, a Brazilian species, is abundant about Bombay and in parts of the Deccan. The great genus *Acacia*, consisting of more than 400 species, is comparatively infrequent in India. Two-thirds of it are exclusively Australian. In the Bombay flora we have but ten or twelve representatives, some of them cosmopolitan tropical plants. A very common shrub or small tree near Bombay is *A. Farnesiana*. It grows everywhere in the tropics, and would seem to be a doubtful native of Western India. Its yellow flowers are delightfully fragrant. The best known species of this genus is *A. Arabica*, the \u201cB\u00e1b\u00fal.\u201d It is found in all parts of the Presidency, attaining its greatest size in the black soil of the Deccan. In Kh\u00e1ndesh, the Konkan, and Gujar\u00e1t it is much less luxuriant, and in the northern arid districts of the latter province, although very abundant, it becomes a stunted shrub. This tree is distributed to Arabia, Egypt, and Eastern Africa, apparently delighting in arid climates, but not objecting to good soil and a moderate degree of moisture; under the latter conditions it generally develops into a large and valuable timber tree. It is the source of gum-arabic. Two or three varieties of it are known in the Deccan and Sind. *A. eburnea* and *A. tomentosa* are Kh\u00e1ndesh and Deccan trees: the latter is common, too, in Eastern Gujar\u00e1t. *A. leucophlo\u00eba* is a common tree of the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, also of Cutch. In the former district its astringent bark is much employed in the process of distilling spirits from palmjuice and sugar. *A. suma*, a tree with white bark, is common in the North Konkan, and is found, too, in parts of Gujar\u00e1t. *A. catechu*, a small tree with rough dark-coloured bark, abounds in the North Konkan, occurring also in Kh\u00e1ndesh, the Deccan, and Gujar\u00e1t. The astringent drug called Black Catechu or \u201cK\u00e1th\u201d is extracted from the close-grained, heavy, red heartwood of this tree. *A. sundra*, which somewhat resembles the preceding, is chiefly a Deccan tree, occurring, too, in K\u00e1\u00f1ara. *A. latronum* is another Deccan tree and may easily be recognised by the formidable spines with which it is armed. Three prickly climbers\u2014*A. concinna*, *A. intia*, and *A. pennata*\u2014abound in the Konkan jungles. The second is found also in Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and the third extends to tropical Africa. A naturalised species of this genus, probably *A. glauca*, is a fast-growing shrub abundant in the vicinity of Bombay. It is a great pest in gardens, from whence its numerous suckers and spreading roots make it difficult to eradicate. Attempts have been made to introduce some of the Australian *Acacias*, particularly *A. mela-noxylon* and *A. dealbata*, but hitherto with only partial success. Five species of *Albizia*, a genus spread through tropical Asia, Africa, and Australia, are common on the Gh\u00e1ts and in the neighbouring parts of the Deccan. *A. Lebbek* and *A. odoratissima* are both large timber trees of the Gh\u00e1t and Konkan forests. They are often planted along roadsides and near villages in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e1t, and Kh\u00e1ndesh. The first extends to Africa and Australia. *A. procera* is a valuable timber tree which grows to a great size in most parts of the Konkan. *A. stipulata* is found with it. *A. amara*, also an African tree, is an exceedingly handsome species frequent along the banks of the Deccan rivers and on the higher Gh\u00e1ts. It is especially abundant at M\u00e1ther\u00e1n. Of the cosmopolitan tropical...\ngenus *Pithecolobium* we possess but one indigenous species, *P. bigeminum*. It is a large tree occurring in the Konkan. *P. dulce*, a Mexican tree, is now very common in Western India. It is of rapid growth and well suited for a shade tree; it also makes excellent hedges, and its pod might be used as fodder. *P. suman*, a tree of Central America, has recently been introduced. Amongst the naturalised species of this sub-order which remain to be mentioned are *Adenanthera pavonina* from Southern India, *Parkia biglandulosa*, a large tree from Malacca, and *Inga hematocaylon*, an American shrub. The first is a very common tree in Bombay; its bright scarlet seeds are well known. The pods of the second contain a quantity of eatable farinaceous pulp. The third bears showy red flowers.\n\n**Rosaceae.\u2014**This large order is mainly confined to the north temperate zone. Numerous representatives occur in the mountainous regions of India. Not more than four are known to be indigenous in Western India, and these are found only on the higher Gh\u00e2ts. *Pygeum Gardneri* is a large tree common at Mah\u00e1baleshvar; it bears yellowish white flowers and a fruit not unlike a greengage plum in appearance. The other indigenous plants of the order are three species of *Rubus*, a very widely diffused genus of the northern hemisphere. *R. moluccanus* is one source of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar raspberries. *R. ellipticus* and *R. lasiocarpus* occur on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. The latter produces a very fair edible fruit. *R. id\u00e6us*, the common Raspberry, has been cultivated successfully at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. *Fragaria vesca*, a Himalayan, and also a British, species, is probably the parent of the different varieties of Strawberry which are so well grown at the same place. *Rosa*, the Rose, has from time immemorial been cultivated in Western India. The commonest kinds here are *R. damascena*, from the flowers of which attar is principally made; *R. centifolia*, the Cabbage rose; *R. Indica* and *R. microphylla*, the China roses; *R. fragrans*, the yellow Tea rose; and *R. rubiginosa*, the Sweet-briar. The original specific characters of most of these Roses have been so altered by crossing and cultivation that it is now all but impossible to decide which is a distinct species and which is not. *Eriobotrya Japonica*, the Loquat, a Chinese fruit tree, is sometimes seen in Deccan gardens. *Pyrus malus*, the Apple, has been planted at Poona and Ahmednagar, producing however but very indifferent fruit. A few trees of *P. communis*, the Pear, occur in Bombay. Attempts have been made to cultivate the Plum and Cherry, *Prunus domestica* and *P. cerasus*, but hitherto without success. *P. amygdalus*, the Almond, is sometimes found in gardens; and *P. persica*, the Peach, has succeeded very fairly at Panchgani.\n\n**Saxifragaceae** is another family of the northern temperate zone and is well represented in the mountainous districts of India. The Bombay flora possesses but one indigenous species, *Vahlia viscosa*, a small herbaceous plant with white or yellow flowers; it is common in Gujar\u00e1t and extends into Persia, Egypt, and tropical Africa. *Hydrangea hortensis*, a well-known Chinese shrub, belongs to this order; it occurs in Bombay and Poona gardens occasionally.\n\n**Crassulaceae** is a widely diffused order of succulent plants; they are commonest in arid temperate regions, especially in South Africa. Four or five are indigenous to Western India. *Till\u00e6a pentandra*, a creeping plant, occurs in the Konkan, and spreads to tropical Africa. *Bryophyllum calycinum*, a cosmopolitan tropical plant, is found in nearly every part of the Presidency, and frequently in gardens. Its leaves possess the curious property of forming buds at their edges which develop, drop off, and produce new plants. *Kalancho\u00eb glandulosa*, belonging to a South African genus, together with *K. laciniata*, occur in the Deccan; both are also African species.\nDROSERACE\u00c6.\u2014Two species of this small order, *Drosera Burmanni* and *D. Indica*, are found in the Konkan during the rainy season. They are small herbaceous plants and are very widely distributed through the Old World tropics. Like the common Sundew, *D. rotundifolia*, a native of Great Britain, these two plants bear on their leaves irritable glandular hairs, which possess the power of closing round insects that may happen to alight on them. The plants would appear also to be capable of digesting and assimilating the insects and other animal matter which are thus secured.\n\nOf the small but widely diffused order, HALORAGE\u00c6, we have two indigenous species. *Serpicula Indica*, a little creeping plant, occurs in the Deccan, and *Myriophyllum Indicum*, an aquatic species, is common in tanks.\n\nRHIZOPHORE\u00c6, another small order, consists of trees or large shrubs which inhabit principally the salt marshes near the mouths of tidal tropical rivers. *Rhizophora mucronata* is a tall shrub abundant along the coasts of India, Burma, Africa, Australia, and the islands of the Eastern Archipelago. In the salt swamps of tropical Africa it exists in enormous quantities; the labyrinth formed by their interlacing aerial roots, together with the mud of the swamps, is known as a Mangrove bog. *Bruguiera gymnorrhiza* and *B. parviiflora* are small trees common along the K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Gujar\u00e1t, and Konkan coasts. *Carallia integerrima* is another small tree frequent on the Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. Most of these species extend to Australia.\n\nCOMBRETACE\u00c6.\u2014Several large and useful timber trees belong to this order, and many of its species are extensive climbers. An astringent principle is contained in the bark and fruit of nearly all its members. The order is distributed almost exclusively to the tropics, both of the Old and New Worlds. A considerable number of species are contained in the Flora Indica, about ten of them being indigenous to this Presidency. *Terminalia* is an important genus of timber trees distributed to most parts of tropical Asia and Africa. *T. belerica* grows to a great size in all the Bombay forests, from K\u00e1nara to Gujar\u00e1t; its seeds, which taste like almonds, are eaten. *T. chebula* is a common tree in the inland parts of K\u00e1nara and on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e1ts; its fruits are very astringent and are exported in large quantities from Bombay for tanning. *T. tomentosa*, a tree with winged fruit, abounds in K\u00e1nara, the Konkan, and in the D\u00e1ng forests. It occurs also, but more sparingly, in the Deccan, and is, besides, found in many other parts of India. On the Gh\u00e1ts and Konkan hills it exists in enormous numbers, but, from being constantly cut down for firewood, it appears more or less stunted. It yields a hard and durable timber. *T. arjuna* is an immense tree in the Kh\u00e1ndesh, D\u00e1ng, and Gujar\u00e1t forests; it reaches a great size, too, in the K\u00e1nara and Belgaum forests. *T. paniculata* is another large tree of the South Konkan and Gh\u00e1ts. *T. catappa*, indigenous to Southern Asia, but a doubtful native here however, is a stately spreading tree found in most parts of the Presidency. Its fruits, together with those of *T. chebula*, are known as Myrabolans and are largely exported. *Calycopteris floribunda* is a common climbing shrub in the Konkan jungles. *Anogeissus latifolia* is a large useful timber tree found in all the forest districts; it yields a hard white gum. *Lumnitzera racemosa*, a shrub with spikes of white flowers, exists in the salt marshes along the coast; it is also an African and Australian species. *Combretum extensum* and *C. ovalifolium*, members of an extensive tropical genus, widely distributed, are large climbing shrubs common in the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t jungles. The latter species is also found in Gujar\u00e1t. *C. grandiflorum*, with *C. coccineum* and *C. purpureum*, are gorgeous scarlet climbers of Bombay gardens; the first is an African and the other two are...\nBrazilian species. *Quisqualis Indica*, another common Bombay climber, with showy red and white flowers, is indigenous to Bengal and tropical Africa.\n\n**Myrtaceae.**\u2014This large and important aromatic order is distributed to all the warmer parts of the globe. The Indian flora possesses a considerable number of representatives, chiefly of the great genus *Eugenia*. This contains upwards of 700 species, dispersed over tropical Asia and America, but few being found in either Africa or Australia. The Bombay flora boasts of only eight or nine representatives, all trees, and occurring on the Gh\u00e2ts and in the Konkan and K\u00e2nara. The species best known is *E. jambolana*, the \"J\u00e2mbhul.\" It is found in all parts of the Presidency except in the driest districts; on the higher Gh\u00e2ts it grows in great quantities. It is common, too, in Gujar\u00e2t and K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r, where many of the planted specimens reach a large size. In the Deccan it is often cultivated for its fruit. *E. Zeylanica*, a tree resembling a large Myrtle, together with *E. caryophyll\u00e6a*, *E. lanceolaria*, and *E. Wildenowii* occur on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *E. salicifolia*, *E. lata*, and *E. rubicunda* are common along all the higher Gh\u00e2ts. *E. pimenta*, a West Indian species, is the Allspice, and *E. aromatica*, a native of the Indian Archipelago, is the Clove tree; the latter, together with *E. jambos*, the Roseapple, and *E. malaccensis*, are found in Bombay gardens. *Barringtonia racemosa*, a timber tree, is plentiful in K\u00e2nara; it bears a profusion of showy pink flowers. *E. acutangula*, a small tree or shrub with scarlet flowers, occurs about the Konkan creeks. The first species is also an African tree. *Careya arborea*, a tree, is common everywhere in the Konkan, K\u00e2nara, and Dang forests. It bears large white flowers and fruit the size of an apple. Among the remaining naturalized plants of this order found in Bombay are *Myrtus communis*, the Myrtle, and *Psidium guayava*, the Guava of the West Indies. Some members of the great Australian genus *Eucalyptus* have been introduced here within the last few years. *E. globulus*, the Blue Gum, although repeatedly tried, has utterly failed in all parts of the Presidency except at Panchgani. Even there the few specimens which remain are more or less stunted. The only species, among those introduced, which at all promises to grow in the Konkan with any degree of vigour, is *E. saligna*, a native of Queensland. It finds here a congenial tropical climate.\n\n**Melastomaceae.**\u2014This extensive family inhabits principally tropical America. Several species are found in India, most abundantly however in the Southern Provinces. Five occur in this Presidency. It is worthy of note that none of the Indian genera of this order possess a single species which is indigenous to America; most of them have, however, Australian and African representatives. Except in an occasional instance, the plants of the order are endowed with no qualities of importance. Many of them are cultivated for their beautiful flowers. *Osbeckia truncata* is an annual plant found in grass lands in the Konkan. *Melastoma malabathricum*, a shrub with showy rose-coloured flowers, occurs in the jungles of the South Konkan and K\u00e2nara, and *Sonerila scapigera*, a small plant, on the Gh\u00e2ts. The first spreads to the Archipelago, Australia, and Polynesia. *Memecylon edule* is a very common tree on the higher Gh\u00e2ts. In the cold weather it is covered with beautiful violet-coloured flowers, from which a dye is obtained. *M. terminalis* is a small shrub of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. This large genus exists in considerable numbers in South India, Ceylon, Africa, and Australia.\n\n**Lythraceae.**\u2014The greater portion of this order is indigenous to tropical America, although a considerable number are also to be found in the tropics of the Old World. A few exist in Europe and three in Great\nBritain. About twelve belong to the Bombay flora. Seven or eight species of *Ammania*, a widely diffused tropical genus, are found on the Gh\u00e2ts and in the tanks and wet ground of the Konkan. They are all herbaceous plants. The leaves of *A. baccifera*, an exceedingly common Konkan species, are very acid and are used here as a vesicant. *A. senegalensis*, a very variable plant, and *A. salicifolia* are, as well as the first, also natives of Africa and Australia. *A. octandra* is a very common weed in most parts of the Presidency. *Woodfordia floribunda*, the only member of the genus, is a shrub with handsome red flowers, common in the Konkan, Kh\u00e2ndesh, and Gujar\u00e1t, and spreading to China, Africa, and Madagascar. *Lawsonia alba*, the Henna, is a small shrub cultivated throughout most eastern countries. It is indigenous to Arabia and Egypt, probably also to Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan. *Lagerstroemia reginae* is a tree found near river banks in the Konkan and K\u00e1nara, and in other moist parts of India. Its timber is valuable, and its abundance of large showy lilac flowers, which appear at the beginning of the rains, render it a conspicuous object. *L. parviflora* is an immense timber tree of the South Konkan and the K\u00e1nara forests; it produces one of the varieties of \"Benteak.\" *L. lanceolata* is another timber tree of the same districts; it is found, too, in the Kh\u00e2ndesh forests and in the Deccan. *Sonneratia acida*, found also in tropical Africa, the Indian Archipelago, and Australia, is a small tree growing along the coast in salt marshes and creeks. *Punica granatum*, the Pomegranate, is the single representative of an anomalous genus which has been placed at the end of this order. It is cultivated throughout India and in most tropical and sub-tropical countries, and is found truly wild in Northern India, Beluchistan, Persia, and Asia Minor.\n\n**Onagraceae.**\u2014Of this widely diffused order the majority of the species are distributed to North America. Some are found in Europe, India, Australia, and New Zealand, and several in Africa. *Jussiaea repens*, a member of a tropical aquatic genus, is a small plant with yellow flowers, common near tanks. *J. villosa* occurs near wet places in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e2ts; the former extends to Australia and the latter to Africa. *Ludwigia parviflora* is a very common annual plant in the same localities and is widely spread through the tropics of the Old World. *Trapa bispinosa*, a member of a small aquatic genus which is found in all the warmer parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, exists in great numbers in tanks throughout the Presidency. It appears to be quite as abundant in all the great African rivers, especially in the Zambesi; its seeds, called Water Chestnuts, are eaten. The *Fuchsia* of gardens, a South American plant, belongs to this order, and so does *Gnothera biennis*, the Evening Primrose of Mah\u00e1baleshvar gardens.\n\n**Samydaceae** is a small family of trees and shrubs found chiefly in the tropical parts of America. Several, however, occur in Africa and Asia, and the genus *Casearia* is distributed to both worlds. *C. tomentosa*, a small tree with greenish-yellow flowers, occurs in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e2ts, as well as in other parts of India. The acid milky juice of its fruit is used to poison fish. *C. graveolens*, a small tree, with *C. laevigata* and *C. rubescens*, shrubs, are found in the South Konkan. *Homalium Zeylanicum* is a Gh\u00e2t tree. The genus to which it belongs spreads to Africa, Australia and America.\n\n**Passifloreae.**\u2014The plants of this order are nearly all climbers, the greater number being indigenous to tropical South America. In the Old World they are comparatively rare, Africa perhaps being most favoured. But few exist in India; only one, *Modecca palmata*, is found in this part of it. It is a rather rare climber with a large thick woody\nroot, greenish flowers, and orange fruit, occurring in the South Konkan and the inland parts of K\u00e1\u0144ara. The genus is Asiatic, African, and Australian. The different kinds of Passion flower, so common in Bombay gardens, are South American species of this order. *Carica papaya*, the Papaw, now planted everywhere about Bombay, also belongs to it.\n\n**Cucurbitaceae.**\u2014A large order of annual climbing plants distributed throughout all the warmest parts of the globe, more especially to Africa, where fully half the genera are represented. Although extensively cultivated as fruits and vegetables, but few are indigenous to temperate climates. Both wild and cultivated they are very common in India, and are found in every part of the country, being most abundant in the moister regions. In Western India about twenty species are indigenous, and these, often existing in great numbers, form, during the rainy season, a characteristic feature of the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t jungles. Two species of *Trichosanthes*\u2014*T. cucumerina* and *T. palmata*\u2014common in the Konkan, have fringed white flowers. They are also indigenous to Australia. *T. anguina* is the cultivated Snake-gourd. *Luffa amara* and *L. echinata* are abundant in the Konkan; the latter, too, in Gujar\u00e1t. The fruit of *L. acutangula*, probably an African species, is a common vegetable in Bombay. *L. pentandra* is also cultivated. *Momordica dioica* and *M. charantia*, both with yellow flowers, abound in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e1ts. The fruit of the latter is eaten as a vegetable. *Cucumis trigonus* and *C. pubescens* are found not only in every part of this Presidency, but all over India. The latter is with good reason supposed to be the parent of the cultivated *C. Melo*, the Melon. It is also an African species. *C. sativus*, the native country of which is unknown, is the Cucumber. *Citrullus colocynthis* is the Bitter Cucumber or Colocynth, a well-known purgative. It grows wild in the Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t; also in Arabia, North Africa, and the South of Europe. *C. vulgaris*, another species indigenous both to India and Africa, is the parent of the cultivated Water-melon. *Cephalandra Indica*, with large white flowers and red fruit, is common everywhere and is also abundant in tropical Africa. *Bryonia* has representatives in all the temperate and tropical regions of the Old World. *B. dioica* is the sole British species of the order. *B. laciniosa* and *B. umbellata* are plentiful in most parts of the Presidency. The first may be recognised by its small red and white fruit; that of the latter is sometimes eaten. *B. Myroensis* occurs in the South Konkan. *Mukia scabrella*, the only member of the genus, is common in all parts of Western India, also occurring in Africa and Australia. One species of *Zehneria*, bearing clustered red fruits, one each of *Ctenolepis* and *Rhynchosarpa*, with three of *Corallocarpus*, are found in Gujar\u00e1t and the first also in K\u00e1\u0144hi\u00e1war. *Zamonia Indica*, with small yellow flowers and conical fruit, is a rare plant found in parts of the South Konkan. Besides the cultivated species already noted, there are several others common in Bombay. The chief of these are the Pumpkins, *Cucurbita Pepo*, *C. maxima*, and *C. moschata*. *C. ovifera* is the Vegetable Marrow, and *Lagenaria vulgaris* the Bottle Gourd. *Telfaria pedata*, an enormous species with a perennial stem from fifty to one hundred feet in length, was once introduced into Bombay from Zanzibar. It has, however, now completely disappeared. The fruit sometimes reaches 60 lbs. in weight, and the large oily seeds taste like almonds. Almost all the Bombay genera of this order are represented in tropical Africa, while nearly half of the indigenous species just mentioned are common to both countries.\n\n**Begoniaceae.**\u2014These are chiefly natives of South America. A few species are found in Asia and Africa. The genus *Begonia*, leaving out one anomalous plant, forms the entire order. It contains about 350 species. Many of these handsome foliage plants are cultivated in Bombay gardens.\nB. orenata, B. integrifolia, and B. trichocarpa, the only indigenous species, are found in rocky places on the Gh\u00e2ts.\n\n**Datisc\u00e6.**\u2014This little order consists of four species, only one of which, *Tetrameles nudiflora*, a large tree with yellow flowers, is found along the Gh\u00e2ts. Two of the remaining species are Indian and the fourth is a native of Mexico.\n\nSome mention of the natural order **Cact\u00e6**, which, with one exception from Western Africa, is entirely an American family, cannot be omitted here. A single American species, *Opuntia Dillenii*, the Prickly Pear, has spread in some districts of this Presidency to such an extent as to have become a noxious weed. In the Deccan, where it is largely used as a hedge plant, it generally forms dense jungles about villages. It has lately been proposed to use planted belts of it as barriers against the ravages of forest fires. One or two other species of *Opuntia*, introduced I believe when the cultivation of the cochineal was first attempted here, may be seen in Bombay gardens, along with *Cereus grandiflorus* and *Pereskia grandiflora*. A few additional examples of the order lately introduced, are now becoming pretty common.\n\n**Ficoid\u00e6.**\u2014This is a comparatively large order of herbaceous fleshy-leaved plants, mostly natives of hot and dry regions. One species of *Sesuvium*, three of *Trianthema*, and three of *Mollugo* are common weeds throughout the Konkan, less so in Gujar\u00e2t and the Deccan. One of the latter genus, *M. Glinus*, is cosmopolitan in the tropics. They grow most abundantly near the sea. The three genera are pretty widely distributed, four of the species found here being also indigenous to Africa. The Ice plant, *Mesembryanthemum crystallinum*, a native of the Cape, and the New Zealand Spinach, *Tetragonia expansa*, are sometimes seen in Bombay and Deccan gardens.\n\n**Umbellifer\u00e6.**\u2014This large, well-defined, and important natural family, deriving its name from the peculiar mode in which its flowers are arranged on the stalk, belongs principally to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Within the tropics its species are rarely to be found, except on mountains and near the sea. In the north of India they are common in the Him\u00e2layas, and on this side about fifteen species occur in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e2ts. Central Asia and Southern Europe appear to be the countries most favoured by the order. Several species are found in America, North Africa, and Australia. *Hydrocotyle Asiatica*, a cosmopolitan creeping plant of warm regions, is common in moist places in the Konkan. Another species, *H. tenella*, a native of Southern India, has lately found its way into Bombay gardens, where it has become a somewhat troublesome weed. A third, *H. vulgaris*, is a British weed. *Bupleurum falcatum* is found in the Southern Mar\u00e2tha Country and also in England. Five species of *Pimpinella*, a large widely scattered genus, grow about the Konkan and Gh\u00e2ts. *P. monoica* occurs on the highest Gh\u00e2ts, while *P. lateriflora* is common in the Deccan. *Polyzygus tuberosus*, the sole representative of the genus, is found in the South Konkan. *Peucedanum glaucum*, belonging to a large tropical and sub-tropical genus, occurs near Belgaum; its root is edible and tastes like a carrot. *P. grandis*, which, like the last, has yellow flowers, grows on the Gh\u00e2ts. *P. sativum* is the Parsnip. *P. graveolens*, the Anise, is largely cultivated in Western India. *Heracleum Concanaense* is found on the Konkan hills, and four additional species on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e2ts. Another member of this genus is the Cow Parsnip, one of the commonest British weeds. Several well-known aromatic species of this family are cultivated here; among them\nmay be mentioned *Foeniculum vulgare*, the Fennel; *Coriandrum sativum*, Coriander; *Cuminum cyminum*, Cumin; and *Carum ptychotis*, the Ajowan. The Caraway, *C. Carvi*, is not, so far as I am aware, grown on this side of India. As articles of food cultivated in Bombay we have *Daucus carota*, the Carrot; *Apium graveolens*, the Celery; and *Carum petroselinum*, the Parsley. A variety of foetid gum-resins, such as Assafetida, Galbanum, Ammoniacum, &c., are yielded by Asiatic plants of this order.\n\n**Araliaceae** is a widely diffused order belonging to tropical and subtropical countries. Only one indigenous species, *Heptapleurum Wallichianum*, is known in Western India: it is a small tree, or sometimes, according to circumstances, a woody climber found along the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. The genus is distributed to the mountainous regions of India and to Africa and Australia. Several species of the order are to be seen in Bombay gardens: amongst these is the Ivy, *Hedera Helix*. This is indigenous, not only to Europe and the Himalayas, but to Northern Africa, Western Asia, and Japan. Within the last three or four years *Brassaia actinophylla* has been introduced from Queensland; it promises to be an exceedingly handsome tree and to do well in Bombay. *Aralia Guilfoylei*, brought here about ten years since from the Fiji Islands, is now one of the commonest Bombay shrubs. *Panax cooleatum*, *P. fruticosum*, and *P. oblitum*, natives of the Indian Archipelago, are scarcely less common shrubs. *Fatsia papyrifera*, the Chinese Rice-paper plant, a native of Formosa, may be found in a few of our gardens.\n\n**Cornaceae**.\u2014This small family has, like the preceding, but one representative in Western India. *Alangium Lamarckii*, a small variable tree with spiny branches and white flowers, is found in the Konkan jungles and in K\u00e2nara; it also occurs in the Deccan, and is very common in Eastern Gujar\u00e2t: the fruit is sometimes eaten. A few species of the order exist in the Himalayas and two in Great Britain.\n\n**Rubiaceae**.\u2014In its importance to man this order holds a place second to none in the vegetable kingdom. When it is remembered that among its products are to be found Quinine, Coffee, and Ipecacuanha, this importance will be easily understood. It contains nearly 4,100 species spread over all the tropical and temperate regions of the globe. A large number are indigenous to India and are found in every part of the country. Between fifty and sixty\u2014timber trees, shrubs, and herbs\u2014belong to the Bombay flora. With few exceptions they are confined to the forest districts, especially of K\u00e2nara, the Konkan, and the Gh\u00e2ts. *Anthocephalus Cadamba*, a large handsome timber tree, is found near villages in the Konkan and K\u00e2nara, and in parts of Gujar\u00e2t, not very abundantly however. It seems to be a doubtful native and has probably been introduced into this Presidency from Southern India. Its fruit, in shape and colour like a small orange, is sometimes eaten. *Stephegyne parviflora* and *Adina cordifolia*, also timber trees, are found in the K\u00e2nara, Gh\u00e2t, Kh\u00e2ndesh, and Gujar\u00e2t forests. Two other timber trees, *Hymenodictyon obovatum* and *H. excelsum*, grow in K\u00e2nara and on the Gh\u00e2ts. *Argostemma cuneatum* and *A. glaberrimum* are small herbaceous plants found, the first growing on rocks and the second on trees, in the South Konkan. *Oldenlandia* is a large tropical genus of herbaceous plants, of which ten or twelve species occur in the Bombay flora, distributed principally to the Konkan and the Deccan. *O. foetida*, with blue flowers, is an exceedingly common weed in cultivated ground in the Deccan. *O. Heyneii* and *O. Burmanniana*, with white flowers, abound everywhere. *O. Abyssinica*, another Deccan weed, is also an African species. Most of the others occur in the South Konkan. *Ophiorhiza Harrisonii*, a member of an Asiatic and Australian genus, is a\nsmall weed of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *Mussaenda frondosa*, a handsome shrub with orange flowers, is common in the Konkan and Gh\u00e2t jungles; it may be easily recognised by the large white leaf into which one of its calyx segments has become developed. Several members of this genus are natives of Africa. *Randia* is a large tropical genus of shrubs and small trees, of which five or six species are common in Western India. *R. dumetorum*, *R. uliginosa*, *R. fragrans*, and *R. Webera*, all thorny shrubs with white or pale yellow flowers, are found in the Konkan and Gh\u00e2t jungles from the D\u00e2ng forests southwards. The first abounds at Mah\u00e1baleshvar; it is also indigenous to many parts of Africa and to the Malay Archipelago. *R. longispina*, not unlike it, occurs in the Kh\u00e2ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t forests. *Gardenia lucida*, a member of a genus which is widely diffused through the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the Old World, is a small tree common in the Konkan and K\u00e1nara; it is often cultivated in Bombay gardens for its fragrant white flowers. The yellow resin which exudes from the leaf bud, forms part of the \"Dikem\u00e1di\" of the b\u00e1z\u00e2rs; the remainder of this is procured from *G. gummiifera*, a large shrub of the Southern Mar\u00e2tha Country and K\u00e1nara. *G. latifolia* and *G. montana* are both small trees, the first occurring on the Gh\u00e2ts and in the Kh\u00e2ndesh forests, and the latter in the K\u00e1nara and Gujar\u00e1t forests. *G. florida*, a small slow-growing shrub with beautiful fragrant white flowers, a native of China, is frequent in Bombay gardens. *Diplospora sphaerocarpa* and *D. apiocarpa*, both trees, and members of an Asiatic genus, are found on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts, and *Knoxia corymbosa*, a small shrubby plant, in the South Konkan. *Cantilium* is a large genus distributed to Asia, Africa, Australia, and the South Sea Islands. *C. umbellatum*, an elegant tree with dark-green glossy foliage, together with three other species, are common along the higher Gh\u00e2ts. *Vangueria spinosa* is a small thorny tree with fruit like an apple, abundant on the Gh\u00e2ts opposite Bombay. The genus is very common in Africa. The large genus *Ixora* is found in nearly all tropical countries, more especially in Asia and Africa. *I. coccinea*, a shrub with beautiful scarlet flowers, abounds in some parts of the Konkan. *I. parvijiora* is a small tree common on the Gh\u00e2ts, and with it are found two other shrubs of the same genus. *Pavetta India*, belonging to another considerable tropical genus distributed like the preceding, is a white-flowered shrub, plentiful on the Gh\u00e2ts. *P. siphoantha* and *P. villosa*, also shrubs, grow on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *Morinda citrifolia*\u2014also indigenous to tropical Africa and Australia\u2014and *M. tomentosa* are very common trees of the Konkan and K\u00e1nara. *M. braeateata* occurs in the South Konkan, and *M. easerta* in Eastern Gujar\u00e1t. From the roots of the first mentioned a red dye is obtained. *Psychotria*, an immense genus, very abundant in tropical America, has two representatives in the Konkan, both insignificant shrubby plants. *Geophila*, *Saprosma*, *Lasianthus*, *Hamiltonia*, and *Spermacoce* have each one representative in the Bombay flora; they are all small plants occurring in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e2ts. *Rubia cordifolia*, a member of the cosmopolitan genus from which the order takes its name, is a common herbaceous climbing plant on the higher Gh\u00e2ts. It is also a native of South Africa. Madder is obtained from the British species, *R. tinctoria*. Amongst the useful and ornamental plants of this family to be found in Bombay may be mentioned *Coffea Arabica*, the Coffee, a native of Abyssinia. It has been successfully cultivated at Belgaum, S\u00e2vantv\u00e2di, and Goa, and there are doubtless many other parts of the Gh\u00e2t districts where the shrub might be profitably grown. Another valuable species, *C. Liberica*, a native of Western Africa, has lately been introduced into Bombay, where the climate has so far appeared to agree perfectly with it. At Mah\u00e1baleshvar attempts have been made to start a Cinchona plantation,\nbut an insufficient supply of water and an absence of shelter from the prevailing winds have effectually interfered with its success. *Cinchona succirubra*, *C. calisaya*, and *C. officinalis* are the species which have been principally planted there. The Ipecacuanha, *Cephaelis Ipecacuana*, indigenous to Brazil, has also been recently introduced; but although the Konkan climate is sufficiently moist, it does not, in Bombay at least, appear to flourish. It is probable that the vicinity of the sea in some way injuriously affects it, and it might possibly grow better a little further inland. As ornamental plants, species of *Serissa*, *Hamelia*, *Pentas*, *Rondeletia*, and *Catesbea*, all flowering shrubs, belonging to this order, are to be seen in Bombay gardens.\n\n**Compositae.\u2014**This, the largest natural family of the vegetable kingdom, contains upwards of 10,000 species, nearly all of which are herbaceous plants. They are diffused over every part of the tropical and temperate regions of the globe, but are most abundant in North America. The shrubby species inhabit chiefly the tropics and South Africa. In India the order prevails most in the temperate mountainous regions, while they are comparatively infrequent in the plains, bearing here a much smaller proportion to the whole vegetation than is the case in colder climates. In England, for example, they are twelve per cent. of the Dicotyledons; in Bombay, on the contrary, they bear a ratio to the same class of plants of only five per cent. Here, however, notwithstanding the comparative scarcity of species, the enormous number of individuals belonging to some of these species cannot fail to strike an observer. The same remark holds good with respect to certain members of the order which are indigenous to other countries,\u2014the common British thistle, for instance; but in this Presidency, at least, it applies to a considerable number of the native species. It is to be noted, too, that a majority of the Compositae belonging to the Bombay flora are found in the more elevated regions\u2014the Gh\u00e2ts and the Deccan\u2014and this fact corresponds to what has been observed elsewhere in India concerning the distribution of the order. Another important fact is that, with very rare exceptions, the genera found in Western India are likewise diffused through different parts of Africa; a considerable number of the species are indeed common to both countries. So far as Western India is concerned, the order has not yet been fully worked out by botanists; besides those indigenous species about to be noticed, there is little doubt that a more extended research will enable us to add many more to the list.\n\nBelonging to the tribe *Vernoniaceae*, the genera represented in the Bombay flora are *Adenoon*, *Vernonia*, *Lamprachanum*, and *Elephantopus*. In the first there is but one species, an Indian plant; the second is a very large genus, distributed to all parts of the tropics and most numerously to Brazil; one of its members, *V. cinerea*, also an African and Australian plant, exists abundantly in the Konkan; and *V. divergens*, a handsome flowering plant, is common on the higher Gh\u00e2ts. The second tribe is represented here by only two genera\u2014*Adenostemma* and *Ageratum*; *Adenostemma rivale* is found in Cutch; and *Ageratum conyzoides*, a cosmopolitan tropical weed with an exceedingly unpleasant odour, abounds in the Konkan. *Dichrocephala*, *Cyathocline*, *Grangea*, and *Conyza* are our indigenous genera of the third tribe\u2014*Astereae*. They occur chiefly on the Gh\u00e2ts. The fourth tribe, *Inuleae*, is universally diffused; at least eleven of its genera are included in the Bombay flora\u2014viz., *Blumea*, *Laggera*, *Pluchea*, *Epaltes*, *Sphaeranthus*, *Eleocharispermum*, *Gnaphalium*, *Anaphalis*, *Cesulia*, *Vicoa*, and *Pulicaria*. Some of these are represented in the Australian flora; others extend to Africa. Several species of *Gnaphalium* are British weeds. *Blumea holosericea* is abundant in the Konkan,\nthe Deccan, and on the Gh\u00e1ts; it may be recognised by the aromatic camphor-like odour of its leaves. Eleven or twelve additional species of the same genus occur in various parts of the Presidency, especially in the drier districts. The one named, as well as some of the others, have a wide tropical distribution. *Pluchea Indica*, a shrub, grows in Cutch and is also a native of Australia. *Casulia axillaris* is an exceedingly handsome species; it grows in wet places in most parts of the Presidency. Of the tribe *Helianthoideae* we have representatives in the Bombay flora of the genera *Xanthium*, *Siegesbeckia*, *Eclipta*, *Sclerocarpus*, *Blainvillea*, *Wedelia*, *Spilanthes*, *Guizotia*, *Glossocardia*, *Bidens*, and *Glossogyne*. Most of these are dispersed throughout the tropics. Of the first mentioned, *X. strumarium* extends to Africa and the Mauritius, and *Siegesbeckia orientalis*, a Deccan plant, to Africa and Australia. *Eclipta alba*, a very common weed in moist ground, and *Spilanthes acemella* are cosmopolitan in the tropics. Several species of *Bidens* are British weeds. *Glossocardia boscvallea* is extraordinarily abundant in the Deccan. *Guizotia Abyssinica* is cultivated in many parts of the Presidency for the oil which is extracted from its seeds. The only species of the seventh tribe which are known here are *Artemisia Indica* and *A. parviflora*. The first occurs on the higher Gh\u00e1ts and is a well-known drug in Indian bazaars. The genus is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, and several of its species are British plants. *Gynura simplex*, of the eighth tribe, grows on the Gh\u00e1ts; *Emilia sonchifolia*, an extensively diffused tropical weed, is common everywhere; and three or four species of *Senecio*, an immense cosmopolitan genus, are found in the Deccan. *Notonia grandiflora*, a large plant with yellow flowers, growing on the Deccan hills, has a reputation as a cure for hydrophobia; a second species, *N. balsamica*, occurs in the same localities.\n\nOf the tribe *Cynaroideae*, *Gonocaulon Indica* and *Echinops echinatus* occur in Gujar\u00e1t and the latter in Cutch and the Deccan as well. Five or six species of *Tricolepis*, an Indian genus, are found in the Deccan and Kh\u00e1n-desh, and one in Gujar\u00e1t and Cutch; they are all thistle-like plants. *Dicona tomentosa*, of the twelfth tribe, a Gujar\u00e1t and Kh\u00e1ti\u00e1w\u00e1r plant, is widely spread throughout Africa. *Lactuca Heyneanus* and *L. sonchifolius*, species of a widely diffused genus of the thirteenth and last tribe\u2014*Cichoraceae*\u2014are common everywhere. *L. sativa* is the garden Lettuce. *Launaea bellidi-folia*, also a Cape and tropical African weed, is a common plant in the sandy districts of the Presidency\u2014in Cutch especially.\n\nMany plants of this great order are cultivated in Bombay either for use or ornament. *Cynara Scolymus* is the Artichoke. *Carthamus tinctorius*, the Safflower, is extensively grown in Kh\u00e1ndesh and the Deccan. Oil is expressed from its seeds, and a pink dye is procured from its flowers. *Helianthus tuberosus* is the Jerusalem Artichoke and *H. annus* the Sunflower. *Taraxacum officinale*, the Dandelion, is cultivated at Ganesh Khind for the Medical Stores. *Guizotia Abyssinica*, the \u201cK\u00e1le Til,\u201d and *Lactuca sativa*, the Lettuce, have already been mentioned. Amongst the ornamental plants common in Bombay and Deccan gardens may be enumerated *Tagetes* and *Calendula*, the French and common Marigolds; *Bellis perennis*, the Daisy; with *Zinnia elegans*, *Dahlia*, *Coreopsis*, *Chrysanthemum*, and others. A Mexican plant, *Lagassea mollis*, grows in enormous quantities in the neighbourhood of Poona and Kirkee, where it has become a perfect pest.\n\n*Goodenoviae* is principally an Australian order. Our only indigenous species, *Scevolia K\u0153nigi*, is a shrub with large shining leaves and small white flowers; it is found near the seashore from Bombay southwards, and is also widely diffused over most of the warmer maritime regions of the Old World.\n**BOTANICAL VOLUME.**\n\n**Campanulaceae** is a considerable natural family dispersed over nearly all temperate and tropical regions, more especially of Africa and America; in South Africa they are abundant. Its largest and most important genus, the cosmopolitan *Lobelia*, has two representatives here. *L. trigona* is a small plant with blue flowers, found in the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t, and *L. nicotianefolia*, a tall and very poisonous plant with white flowers, on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e1ts and on the Deccan hills. When young the latter bears a somewhat close resemblance to a tobacco plant. A few other species are indigenous to the mountainous regions of India, and two or three exotic members of the genus are ornamental annuals of Bombay gardens. Two species of *Cephalostigma*, both small herbs, occur in this Presidency; *O. hirsutum* is found in the Konkan and extends to Abyssinia. *Wahlenbergia agrestis*, belonging to a South African genus, is a weed with pale blue flowers, growing on the higher Gh\u00e1ts. *Sphenoclea Zeylanica*, a herbaceous marsh plant, cosmopolitan in the tropics, is common about Bombay. *Isotoma longiflora*, a highly poisonous West Indian plant with white flowers, and *Pratia radicans*, a minute creeper, said to be a native of China, are now common in Bombay gardens; the latter is used principally as an edging to flower beds.\n\n**Plumbaginaceae** is a small but widely distributed order, of which two species are indigenous to Western India. *Plumbago Zeylanica*, a perennial with white flowers, is common in rocky places in the Konkan and may be found, too, in the Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh; it extends to tropical Africa and Australia. *P. capensis*, so common in our gardens, and a native of the Cape, has pale blue flowers; except in this respect it hardly seems to differ from the indigenous plant. *P. rosea*, a native of Southern India, is the well-known \"Lal chirak.\" All the species are exceedingly acrid. *Vogelia Arabica*, a small shrub with whitish leaves, is found in Gujar\u00e1t and extends to Arabia and South Africa.\n\n**Primulaceae.\u2014** The common Pimpornel, *Anagallis arvensis*, occurs in the Deccan, more sparingly in Gujar\u00e1t, and throughout most parts of India. It is the only plant of this family found in Western India. As \"Poor Man's Weather-glass\" it is a well-known British weed. It extends over Europe, Northern Africa, and Asia, and is said to be found even in Australia. The Deccan variety has either blue or rose-coloured flowers.\n\n**Myrsinaceae** is an order of trees and shrubs distributed to most parts of the tropics, especially to Asia and Australia. Six species, all shrubs, are indigenous to this part of the world. *Musa Indica*, with white flowers, grows on the Gh\u00e1ts, and its pea-like fruit is used to poison fish. The genus is represented in Arabia, Africa, and Australia. *Embelia basa* occurs in the South Konkan, and *E. Ribes* and *E. glandulifera* on the Gh\u00e1ts. *Ardisia humilis*, our sole representative of a large and widely diffused tropical genus, is a handsome shrub with rose-coloured flowers common on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. *Egiceras majus*, a shrub with fragrant white flowers, is abundant in the salt marshes along the coast; it is distributed chiefly to the tropical Asiatic coasts and extends as far as Australia and Polynesia. Several species of this order occur in the hilly districts of India.\n\n**Sapotaceae.\u2014** This family of trees and shrubs, yielding so many important products, is diffused principally through the Asiatic and American tropics; many species occur in Africa and several in Australia. The order is fairly represented in the Flora India, but the Indian Archipelago seems richest in species. Most of the genera mentioned below have a very extensive range. *Chrysophyllum Rouburghii*, a large tree bearing a fruit like an apple, grows on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. *C. Cainito*, the West\nIndian Star-apple, has recently been introduced into Bombay. *Sideroxylon tomentosum*, a middle-sized thorny tree, is very common along the higher Gh\u00e1ts; another common Gh\u00e1t tree is *Isonandra Candolleana*. The dried milky juice of *I. gutta*, a native of the Eastern Islands, is \"Guttapercha.\" *Bassia longifolia* and *B. elliptica*, both large trees, occur in the K\u00e1nara forests. *B. latifolia*, the well-known \"Mowa,\" is found from K\u00e1nara to Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t; in the forests of the latter province and in the D\u00e1ngs it is exceedingly abundant, growing to a great size, and having, at a little distance, very much the appearance of an Oak. In parts of Gujar\u00e1t it forms quite a feature in the landscape. A considerable quantity of spirit is distilled annually from its saccharine fleshy flowers, and a fixed oil is obtained from its seeds; its timber, too, is valuable. *Mimusops elengi* is a large tree occurring in the South Konkan and in K\u00e1nara. *M. Indica* is a great spreading timber tree common in the Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t forests; near Bombay it dwindles into a stunted crooked bush. *M. Browniana*, a small but handsome fruit tree and a native of Australia and the Indian Archipelago, is sparingly cultivated here. The fruit of *Achras sapota*, an indigenous tree of South America and now common in Bombay, is the Sapodilla plum.\n\n**Ebenaceae** are mostly distributed to tropical and sub-tropical regions, especially of India. The principal genus of this order is noted for the dark colour and hardness of the timber furnished by several of its members. Amongst our indigenous species, *Maba buxifolia* and *M. micrantha* are two small trees found on the Gh\u00e1ts; other species occur in Australia and Africa. Seven or eight species of *Diospyros* are known in this Presidency. All are trees, and grow chiefly on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. *D. melanocrylon*, from which one kind of ebony is procured, is found occasionally in K\u00e1nara, but plentifully in the Gujar\u00e1t and S\u00e1tpuda forests; it bears an edible fruit. *D. chloroxylon* is a large tree occurring in parts of Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan. *D. paniculata*, *D. pruriens*, and *D. nigricans* grow on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. *D. montana*, a middle-sized tree, and *D. Candolleana* are common along the Gh\u00e1ts; the former yields a beautifully variegated wood. The best ebony is the product of *D. ebenum*, a large Ceylon tree. *D. tessellaria*, a native of Mauritius, also yields valuable ebony. This large genus is widely diffused throughout the forest districts of India, and possesses representatives in nearly all the warmer parts of the world.\n\n**Styracaceae**.\u2014This small family inhabits chiefly tropical and sub-tropical Asia and America. A considerable number of species are found in India and Ceylon; but in this part of the country we have only two. *Symplocos spicata* and *S. racemosa*, both small trees, are common on the Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. The first extends to Australia. It may perhaps be mentioned that *Styrax benzoin*, a tree of this order and a native of the Indian Archipelago, is the source of the fragrant resin known as gum Benjamin or Benzoin\u2014a familiar drug of the Bombay b\u00e1z\u00e1r.\n\n**Oleaceae** are widely distributed to both tropical and temperate regions. They are usually trees or shrubs, the latter being often climbers. *Jasminum*, a large and well-known genus, has six or seven indigenous representatives in Western India. All these are noted for their fragrant flowers and some are cultivated in gardens. *J. sambac*, the sweet-scented \"Mogra\", is a common Bombay shrub. I have never seen it wild however. *J. pubescens* and *J. Rottlerianum*, both shrubs with white flowers, occur in the South Konkan. *J. latifolium* is an abundant climber in the Gh\u00e1t jungles; the delicate perfume of its white flowers must be familiar to residents at M\u00e1ther\u00e1n and Mah\u00e1baleshvar. *J. bracteatum*, another climber, is found in the Gujar\u00e1t hills. Several additional species are common in other parts of India.\nThe genus extends to Africa, South Europe, and Australia. *J. officinale* is the Jessamine of English gardens, and is supposed to be originally a native of this country; indeed it is said to grow wild in the Himalayas. The night flowering Jessamine, *Nyctanthes arbor-tristis*, is a common shrub or small tree in Bombay gardens. It inhabits chiefly the Himalayan jungles, and has also been found wild in the Satpuda forests in Kh\u00e1ndesh. Its numerous sweet-smelling white and orange flowers appear in the evening and fall at sunrise, when the ground is thickly strewed with them. An orange dye is made from the tube of the corolla, and the rough leaves are used for polishing wood. *Schrebera Swietenioides* is a tall timber tree found along the Northern Gh\u00e1ts and in the Gujar\u00e1t forests; its wood is very hard and close-grained. *Ichnocera Malabarica* is a small Gh\u00e1t tree. Of the very widely dispersed genus *Olea* we possess two indigenous species. *O. glandulifera* and *O. dioica*, both small trees bearing bitter purple fruit, are abundant on the Gh\u00e1ts. *O. Europea*, a native of South Europe, is the cultivated Olive. *O. fragrans*, a Chinese shrub, and said to be also indigenous to Eastern Bengal, is pretty common in Bombay gardens; it has deliciously scented white flowers. *Ligustrum Nilgiriense*, a shrub or small tree with fragrant flowers, grows on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. *L. vulgare*, a British species, is the well-known Privet.\n\n**Salvadoraceae.**\u2014Although this is a very limited order in point of numbers, consisting of hardly more than eight species, yet its distribution well illustrates the close affinity which exists between the Indian and African floras. *Salvadora* extends throughout North Africa, Arabia, and Persia to India. *S. Persica*, said to be the Mustard-tree of Scripture, is plentiful in most parts of the Presidency, especially near the sea and in salt soil; it is a small straggling tree with greenish yellow flowers and red berries tasting like cress. The bark of the root is exceedingly acrid.\n\n**Apocynaceae.**\u2014This order is largely represented in tropical and subtropical regions, more especially in those of Asia, but in temperate climates they exist only in small numbers. The Indian species appear to prevail most in the southern districts of the Peninsula and in the moister parts of Bengal. The plants of this order are very often poisonous,\u2014some of them virulently so. Between twenty-five and thirty species are indigenous to Western India, a considerable number of them being climbing shrubs. *Carissa carandas*, a spreading thorny shrub, forms by far the greater portion of the low Konkan jungles, and it abounds, too, in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e1t, and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. Its purple fruit is edible. *C. hirsuta* occurs in the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country. *C. lanceolata* grows on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fruit, which, like that of the first, is edible and much larger besides. The genus extends to Africa and Australia. *Rauwolfia serpentina*, a member of a widely spread tropical genus, is a pretty shrub common in the Konkan, and *R. Nilgiriensis* occurs on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. *Vinc\u00e1 pusilla*, a small annual plant with white flowers, grows in the Deccan, while *V. rosea*, an American species, is a familiar ornament of Bombay gardens. *Plumbiera acutifolia*, the well-known \"Khair Ch\u00e1mpe,\" is common near villages all over the Presidency; it is not found wild, and is probably not indigenous. *Ellertonia Rheedi* is a climbing shrub of the South Konkan. *Alstonia scholaris*, a spreading tree, is plentiful in K\u00e1nara; it is found, too, in various other parts of India and extends to Australia and tropical Africa. Its bark is said to possess antiperiodic properties. *Tabernamontana crispa*, a common Gh\u00e1t shrub with fragrant white flowers, belongs to a large and widely diffused tropical genus. *T. coronario*, with larger flowers, is found in the Konkan, and a double variety of it is abundant in gardens. *Holarrhena antidysenterica* is a common and well-known Gh\u00e1t tree the bark of\nwhich is employed medicinally. *Vullaris dichotoma* is a large climbing shrub, abundant in the Konkan and Deccan jungles. Its fragrant white flowers cause it to be frequently cultivated in gardens. *Parsonsia Rheedi* and *P. spiralis* are Konkan climbers. *Wrightia tomentosa*, a member of a small but widely distributed tropical genus, is a tree of the North Konkan, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Gujar\u00e1t forest districts, and *W. tinctoria*, which much resembles it; occurs through the South Konkan and in K\u00e1nara. A third species, *W. Wallichiana*, is found with the preceding. *Nerium odorum*, a poisonous shrub with fragrant white or rose-coloured flowers, is common in the Kh\u00e1ndesh ravines and dry river beds. It is undoubtedly indigenous, and appears in fact to be the wild form of the Oleander of Bombay gardens; it does not seem to differ materially from the European shrub *N. oleander*. *Ichnocarpus frutescens*, along with another species, are climbing shrubs of the Gh\u00e1t and South Konkan jungles. The genus spreads to Africa and Australia. *Anodendron paniculatum* is an immense climber very abundant on the Gh\u00e1ts. An equally extensive climbing shrub, common in the Konkan, is *Chonemorpha macrophylla*. *Beaumontia Jerdoniana*, a handsome climber, is plentiful in K\u00e1nara, and occurs also in the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country. *B. grandiflora*, a native of the Him\u00e1layan jungles, is one of our most splendid garden climbers. Amongst the exotic plants of this order which have become naturalised in Bombay may be mentioned three or four species of *Allamanda*, a South American genus. *A. cathartica*, and *A. purpurea*, with their large bright yellow flowers, are well-known Bombay shrubs. *Thvetia neriifolia*, an exceedingly poisonous shrub or small tree, from tropical America, with large yellow flowers, is pretty common about Bombay, as is also *Cerbera odollam*, a tall shrub with fragrant white flowers, and a native of Bengal, Seychelles, and Australia. *Rougelia grata*, a shrub from Western Africa, is another ornament of our gardens.\n\n**Asclepiad\u00e6** form a large natural family which has much the same distribution as the preceding, but extends in considerable numbers beyond the limits of the tropics. They are, like it, characterized by the possession of milky juice; their poisonous properties are, however, much less pronounced. The species of this order abound in India, the Bombay flora containing at least forty, nearly all of which are climbers. *Hemidesmus Indicus* is a twining plant, plentiful everywhere in hedges and waste lands; it is known as the Indian Sarsaparilla. *Periploca aphylla*, a nearly leafless shrub, is common in Cutch, and extends into Arabia and Egypt. *Cryptolepis Buchanani* and *Toxocarpus crassifolius* are common Gh\u00e1t climbers. *Oxytelma esculenta*, a handsome climber with showy rose-coloured flowers, occurs in the Konkan jungles near river banks. *Calotropis gigantea*, a well-known shrub, is abundant in all parts of the Presidency, especially in the drier districts. *C. procera*, which closely resembles it, is somewhat less common and is found chiefly in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e1t, and Cutch, extending through Persia and Arabia to Africa. Its milky juice is an acrid poison, and is said to have been one of the drugs used in this country for destroying female infants. Both species yield a fine silky fibre of great strength. *Holostemma Rheedi*, a twiner with fleshy red and white flowers, abounds in the Konkan. *Vincetoxicum pauciflorum*, a Deccan climber, belongs to a genus which is widely diffused through the temperate parts of Africa and Australia; it also extends on either side to South Europe and China. *Surcostemma brevisigma* and *S. viminalis*, both of them fleshy, leafless, partially twining plants, are found in the Deccan in stony ground; the former is common in Cutch, and the latter also occurs in Gujar\u00e1t, and extends, too, as far as the Seychelles and the Cape. The genus has Australian and South American representatives besides. *Pentatropis microphylla*, a twining plant with fleshy leaves and green flowers, and belonging to another\nAfrican and Australian genus, is common in Cutch, Gujara\u0301t and the Deccan. *Dombia extensa* is an abundant climber in every part of the Presidency. *Gymnema sylvestre* and *G. elegans* are Gh\u00e1t climbers; the first is a very widely diffused tropical species. Four or five species of *Tylophora* are Konkan climbers. *T. asthmatica* occurs also in the Deccan. Other members of the genus are African and Australian, and the last mentioned is found in the Seychelles. *Cosmostigma racemosum*, the only plant of the genus, is a very common climber during the rainy season. One species of *Heterostemma* and one of *Oianthus* occur in the Konkan; the latter, *O. urceolatus*, exists also in the southern parts of the Deccan. Four or five species of *Hoya* grow on the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t trees. *H. carmosa*, a native of the Archipelago and Australia, is the common Wax-plant of Bombay gardens. *Leptadenia reticulata* is an abundant Konkan climber; it bears fragrant green flowers. Another species, *L. Jacquemontiana*, is common in K\u00e1-thi\u00e1war and Cutch. Eleven or twelve species of *Ceropegia*, a widely diffused tropical genus, are found in the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t jungles; they are all climbers, and some of them have tuberous roots. *Caralluma fimbriata*, a fleshy leafless plant, not unlike a Cactus in appearance, occurs in the Deccan in rocky places. These peculiar plants are essentially natives of arid climates and are found most abundantly in South Africa. Amongst the naturalised plants of this order common in Bombay may be mentioned *Asclepias curassavica*, a native of the West Indies and South America; it is said to be the Peruvian silk plant. *Stephanotis floribunda*, a most beautiful climber with fragrant white flowers, is from Madagascar. *Pergularia odoratissima* and *Cryptostegia grandiflora* are both natives of Bengal. The latter is an immense climber with showy rose-coloured flowers.\n\n**Loganiaceae.**\u2014This small but very important order is scattered over the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the whole world. One species of *Mitreola* and one of *Mitrasacme*, small herbaceous plants, are found in the Konkan; both are also indigenous to Australia. *Buddleia Asiatica*, a member of a cosmopolitan genus, is a small Konkan tree. The widely dispersed tropical genus *Strychnos* contains some of the most poisonous plants known. Of our three or four indigenous species, *S. colubrina* is a climbing shrub found in the South Konkan and K\u00e1-nara. Its wood, known as Snake-wood, is supposed to be an antidote to the poison of venomous serpents. *S. Nux-vomica*, a middle-sized tree, is exceedingly common in the same localities. Its fruit, in appearance like a small orange, contains the Nux-vomica seeds from which the drug Strychnine is extracted. *S. potatorum*, also a tree, occurs in K\u00e1-nara and the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country; its seeds, called Clearing-nuts from the property they possess of quickly clearing muddy water, are non-poisonous. Other species of this genus occur in various parts of India. *S. Ignatia*, a native of the Philippines, yields St. Ignatius\u2019 beans, which contain a large quantity of Strychnine. *S. tieute*, an indigenous tree of Java, yields the \u00dapas-tieute poison, and from *S. toxifera*, a native of Brazil, is obtained the drug Curare. The yellow Jessamine, *Gelsemium sempervirens*, a highly poisonous shrub, belongs to this order. It is a native of North America, and has of late years been introduced into a few Bombay gardens.\n\n**Gentianae** is a cosmopolitan order of herbaceous plants which inhabit chiefly the mountainous regions both of tropical and temperate countries. A few, however, are found in the hot plains of India. The Him\u00e1layan flora is rich in species, and about fifteen are indigenous to this Presidency. Three or four plants of the Indian genus *Erycium* are found in the Konkan; all have blue flowers. *Enicostema orientalis*, the only member of the genus, is common in Gujara\u0301t and Cutch; it extends to Africa. *Erythrea Roxburghii*, a small plant with pink flowers, belonging to a genus which is\nwidely scattered over the temperate and sub-tropical regions of the globe, occurs in the Deccan. Four or five species of the tropical genus *Canscora* are found in the South Konkan. The most frequent of these, *C. diffusa*, is also an Australian plant. Three of *Swertia*, a mountain genus, are pretty common on the higher Gh\u00e1ts. *S. multijlora* is an excellent bitter tonic. The well-known \"Chirata,\" of the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, for which the preceding is the Bombay substitute, is *S. chirata*, a native of the Himalayas. *Limnanthemum*, a widely distributed tropical genus of aquatic plants, has three or four indigenous representatives on this side of India. *L. Indicum* is very abundant in the Konkan tanks, and is extensively diffused throughout the rivers and lakes of the tropics. It has pretty white flowers, and its round floating leaves are often mistaken for those of the Water Lily.\n\n*Hydrola Zeylanica* is the only member of the little order *Hydrophyllaceae* which is indigenous to Western India. It is a small creeping plant, with deep blue flowers, found nearly everywhere in wet situations. A species of *Wigandia*, belonging to this order and a native of tropical America, has recently been introduced at Poona. It has enormous leaves. The little *Nemophila* of Bombay gardens is also one of this family.\n\n**BORAGINAE.\u2014**This large order is distributed to all tropical and temperate regions. The genus *Cordia*, of which we have at least three indigenous representatives in Western India, is widely dispersed through the tropics. *C. Myra*, a handsome tree, may be seen everywhere; it extends from this country into Persia, Arabia, Egypt, the Indian Archipelago, and Australia. *C. Rothii*, also a tree, is nearly as common, and *C. Wallichii* is found in parts of the Deccan. *C. Sebestena*, a small South American tree, with showy red flowers, is frequent in gardens in Bombay. *Ehretia lavis*, our only native species of a widely spread tropical genus, is a Konkan tree. *Culdenia procumbens* is a common weed in rice fields, and, with the preceding, is also indigenous to Australia. *Rhabdia viminea* is a shrub of the Konkan river beds. *Tournefortia subulata*, a member of a cosmopolitan tropical genus of shrubs, occurs in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and Cutch. Seven or eight species of another cosmopolitan genus, *Heliotropium*, are indigenous to this part of India. They are all herbaceous plants and are found mostly in dry situations. Two of them, *H. Indicum* and *H. ovalifolium*, grow in all parts of the tropics. The common sweet-scented Heliotrope of gardens is *H. Peruvianum*, a native of South America. *Trichodesma Indicum* and *T. Zeylanicum*, rough herbaceous plants with pale blue flowers, are very common weeds in nearly every part of the Presidency during the rainy season. Both species extend to tropical Africa and Mauritius, and the latter, in addition, to Australia. Two or three species of *Paracaryum*, also herbaceous plants with blue flowers, abound in the jungles of the higher Gh\u00e1ts; they occasionally occur, too, in the Konkan. *P. celestinum* is a familiar M\u00e1ther\u00e1n plant. *Sericostoma paniciflorum* is a small shrubby species of the sandy districts of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. The prickly Comfrey, *Symphytum asperimum*, which has of late years been extensively brought into notice as a fodder plant, belongs to this order. It has been recently introduced into Bombay, but, so far as we can at present judge, the climate does not seem to agree with it.\n\n**CONVOLVULACEAE** form a large family of twining plants chiefly inhabiting the tropics, to all parts of which they are distributed; while in temperate regions they are comparatively infrequent. A large number of species exist in India, and of these about forty-five are contained in the Bombay flora. These are mostly found in the Konkan, on the Gh\u00e1ts, and in the forest districts elsewhere; others prefer the seacoast. The great\ntangled masses of vegetation formed in the Konkan during the rainy season are composed principally of these plants. Many of our genera are extensively diffused, spreading from Asia to Africa, Australia, and America. Several individual species, too, have a very wide range. *Erycibe* and *Rivea* possess two representatives each in Western India, and *Argyreia* five or six; the first spreads to Australia and the third to Africa. *A. speciosa* is the well-known Elephant creeper; it grows in most of the forest districts. *Lettsonia*, a small Indian genus, furnishes two species. Of the great cosmopolitan genus *Ipomoea* we have between twenty-five and thirty indigenous species, the majority of which are Konkan and Gh\u00e1t climbers; some, however, occur in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1v\u00e1r, and Cutch. *I. speciosa* is the beautiful Moonflower. *I. reptans* is aquatic and is very common in the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t tanks. *I. pes-caprae* abounds in sandy ground near the sea. Both the latter species are widely diffused through the tropics. The roots of *I. turpethum* and *I. paniculata*, also Australian plants, are used in native medicine. The seeds of *I. Nil* are a valuable substitute for Jalap, which itself is the product of an American member of this genus. A large number of the species possess showy flowers, and many, both indigenous and naturalized, are cultivated for that reason in Bombay and Deccan gardens. *I. Quamoclit*, a native of Bengal, is an abundant climber here, and may be recognised by its profusion of bright scarlet flowers. The tuber of *I. batatas*, an American species, is the well-known Sweet Potato. The Small Bindweed, *Convolvulus arvensis*, also a British plant, is met with everywhere, particularly in Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan. Other genera of this order, all widely diffused, and represented in the Bombay flora by a single species each, are *Hewittia*, *Evolvulus*, *Porana*, *Brewesia*, and *Oressa*. The second is an exceedingly common plant of grass lands in every part of the Presidency. *Porana racemosa* spreads over the highest trees on the Gh\u00e1ts. *P. volubilis*, a native of the Indian Archipelago, is one of our most beautiful garden climbers. *Cressa cretica*, the only representative of the genus and cosmopolitan in the tropics, is a small hairy plant very abundant in salt land in the Konkan. It covers the Byculla flats during the dry season. Two or three species of *Cuscuta*, or Dodder, are parasitic on various plants throughout the Presidency. The commonest of these, *C. chinensis*, is found everywhere in tropical Asia and extends to Madagascar and Australia. *Jacquemontia violacea*, a native of America, is now a common climber in Bombay gardens; its pretty blue flowers are well known.\n\n**Solanaceae.**\u2014Two products of this order, Tobacco and the Potato, cause it to be classed as one of the most important in the vegetable kingdom. The species abound most in tropical countries, especially in parts of America. *Solanum*, a large genus of upwards of 700 members, is diffused through all the hottest parts of the world, America more particularly, but is rare in temperate climates. About twenty-five species only are known in India, of which six or seven occur on this side. *S. Indicum* is a very common prickly shrub with yellow berries. *S. diffusum*, a low spreading plant covered with prickles and bearing violet flowers and yellow fruit, abounds in the drier districts. *S. trilobatum* is a prickly climber frequent in Gujar\u00e1t. *S. giganteum* is a very common shrub on the higher Gh\u00e1ts. *S. nigrum*, a doubtful native however, is a weed often found in gardens; it seems to be a plant of cultivation everywhere in the tropics. Another weed of the same nature is *S. sanctum*; this may be seen occasionally in parts of the Konkan and the Deccan. *S. auriculatum*, a cosmopolitan tropical plant, is a tall bush with pale blue or white flowers, found in the southern parts of the Presidency. We possess also five or six naturalised species of this genus. *S. tuberosum*, a native of South America, is the Potato. *S. melongena* is the common Egg-plant or \"Brinjal.\" *S. macrophyllum*, another South\nAmerican species, is a middle-sized tree sometimes found in gardens. *S. jasminoides*, from the same part of the world, is a pretty climber with white flowers. *Withania somnifera* is an abundant weed in many parts of Western India; it is a widely spread plant, and is found in Persia, the South of Europe, and at the Cape. *Lycium Europaeum*, a thorny shrub with white flowers and yellow or red berries, is common in Cutch, and is also indigenous to the Mediterranean region. The genus is principally distributed to the Cape and South America. The well-known narcotic *Datura alba* is found everywhere, and *D. fastuosa*, a species with white and purple flowers, is almost equally common. The first appears to differ but little from *D. stramonium*, the common Thorn-apple of Europe. *D. candida*, a large shrubby plant, and a native of Peru, is very common at Mah\u00e1baleshvar; its great white bell-shaped flowers make it a conspicuous object.\n\nBesides the naturalised species of this family already mentioned, we have several others, many of them of very great importance. *Lycopersicum esculentum*, a native of South America, is the common Tomato. *L. Galeni* is the Cherry Tomato. *Physalis Peruviana*, originally from Peru, is well known here as the Cape Gooseberry. The various species of *Capsicum*, so extensively cultivated as condiments, are generally supposed to have been first brought from South America, from whence they have been distributed over the world. The best known of our Bombay species and varieties of this genus are *C. baccatum*, the Bird Pepper; *C. frutescens* and *C. fastigiatum*, the common Chilly or Cayenne Pepper; and *C. grosso*, the Bell Pepper. The variety called *C. Nepalensis* is the Nepal Pepper. The Henbane, *Hyoscyamus niger*, is cultivated at Ganesh Khind for the Medical Stores. *H. insanus*, the seeds of which are sold in the Bombay bazar, is a native of Beluchistan. The Gujar\u00e1t Tobacco is yielded by *Nicotiana tabacum*, a native of tropical America; many of the American tobaccos are also the produce of this plant. Shiraz tobacco is obtained from *N. Persica*. Several of the Indian tobaccos, together with Manila and Turkish, are from *N. rustica*. Numerous varieties of a species of *Petunia*, which, like many of those just mentioned, is originally from South America, are now established as the most ornamental of our garden annuals. *Brunfelsia nitida*, an elegant West Indian shrub belonging to this order, is also not uncommon.\n\n**Scrophulariaceae.**\u2014This large natural family is widely diffused over nearly all parts of the globe, but is most abundant in temperate regions. A considerable number occur in the mountainous districts of India, while they are also pretty common in the plains. In Western India about forty species are indigenous, and these are to be found most frequently in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e1ts; they are all herbaceous, and none of them are of any particular importance. The prevailing genera are tropical. Of *Celsia*, *Linaria*, *Sutera*, *Mazus*, *Lindembergia*, and *Stemodia* we have one indigenous species each, those of the first two occurring in the Deccan and drier districts, the third in Gujar\u00e1t, and the rest in the Konkan. All these genera are very widely distributed to both tropical and temperate regions. Six or seven species of *Limnophila*, chiefly aquatic plants, are found near tanks; one of them, *L. gratioloides*, extends to Africa and Australia. *Herpestis Monnierei*, another common aquatic plant of the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t, and a member of an American genus, is cosmopolitan in the tropics. A second indigenous species occurs in the South Konkan. *Dopatrium* and *Artanema*, both small tropical genera of the Old World, are each represented here by a single species. Of *Torenia* and *Vandelia*, cosmopolitan tropical genera, we possess three or four representatives apiece, all of which are Konkan plants. *T. cordifolia* occurs also in Mauritius; and *T. bicolor*, a pretty climber, is occasionally seen in Bombay.\ngardens. *V. crustacea*, very common here, is found in every part of the tropics. *Hysanites hyssopoides*, an abundant weed in the rainy season, belongs to a small genus extensively diffused through the temperate parts of both Old and New Worlds. Five or six species of *Bonnaya*, and an equal number of *Striga*, small genera of the Asiatic and African tropics, occur in the Konkan, two or three of the latter spreading to the Deccan. *Glossostigma*, *Buchnera*, *Ramphicarpa*, *Cetranthera*, and *Sophubia* are all small tropical genera, and are represented in our flora by one species each. The indigenous member of the last genus, *S. delphinifolia*, is a very handsome plant. Amongst the naturalised ornamental plants of this family to be found in Bombay gardens may be mentioned *Angelonia lobanifolia*, a small shrubby plant with spotted purple flowers, and the common Snapdragon, a species of *Antirrhinum*. Two or three kinds of *Maurandia*, elegant climbers from Mexico, are frequent. *M. scandens* abounds in Mah\u00e1baleshvar gardens. *Russelia junc\u00e9a* and *R. floribunda*, handsome perennials with scarlet flowers, are also natives of Mexico.\n\n**Orobanchaceae** are parasitical plants found growing on the roots of other species, and are devoid of regular leaves. *Agyneta Indica* exists in most parts of India and is parasitic on the roots of various kinds of shrubs in the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t jungles. *Christisonia Stocksii* and *C. Lourii* are found in the same situations as the last. *Phelipaea Indica* occurs frequently on the roots of Tobacco plants. *Cistantha lutea*, a large species with yellow flowers, grows in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r on the roots of grasses and of *Calotropis procera*.\n\n**Lentibularie.**\u2014Seven or eight species of the large cosmopolitan genus *Utricularia* are indigenous to this part of India. They are small plants, appearing in the rainy season, and delighting in moist localities in the Konkan. Their flowers are usually blue or purple and rather showy. *U. stellaris*, a widely diffused tropical species, with yellow flowers, grows in tanks near Bombay, and also in Gujar\u00e1t.\n\n**Gesneraceae.**\u2014Four genera of this family\u2014*Aeschynanthus*, *Epithema*, *Klugia*, and *Didymocarpus*\u2014are represented in the Bombay flora by one species each. They are herbaceous plants found on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. The greater part of the order is exclusively South American. Species of the Brazilian genera *Gloxinia*, *Achimenes*, and *Gesnera* are common ornamental flowering plants of Bombay gardens.\n\n**Bignoniaceae.**\u2014This order, noted for the beauty of its flowers, is diffused throughout all the warmer parts of the globe. They abound in tropical America, and are also pretty common in India and Africa; a few are found in Australia. At least eight species, all trees, are indigenous to this Presidency. *Oroxylum Indicum*, the sole representative of the genus, is a small fast-growing tree, with fetid dark-coloured flowers and pods of enormous size, common in nearly all the forest districts of Western India. *Tecoma undulata*, a small tree with drooping branches and a profusion of large orange flowers, is frequent near villages in Western Kh\u00e1ndesh and in Gujar\u00e1t, less so in Cutch. It has usually the appearance of having been planted. *T. stans*, an American shrub with showy yellow flowers, *T. capensis*, a red-flowered shrub from South Africa, and *T. jasminoides*, a splendid Australian climber, are all common in our Bombay gardens. Two species of *Dolichandrone*, a small genus widely diffused through the Old World tropics, occur on this side of India. *D. falcata* and *D. crispa*, small trees with fragrant white flowers, occur in the South Konkan and in parts of the Deccan; the first may also be seen in the Kh\u00e1ndesh jungles. *Heterophragma Roxburghii*, the well-known \u201cWarus,\u201d is a very abundant tree\nalong the Gh\u00e1ts; it is common, too, in the S\u00e1tipuda and Gujar\u00e1t forests. *Stereospermum xylocarpum*, *S. suaveolens*, and *S. chelonoides* are found in the Gh\u00e1t forests, the first ranging from the D\u00e1ngs to K\u00e1nara; the second also occurs in the latter districts and in the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country. Several handsome exotic climbers belonging to this order abound in Bombay. Amongst these may be mentioned *Bignonia venusta*, *B. radicans*, *B. unguis*, *B. aquinoctialis*, and *B. gracilis*, with two or three others of the same genus, all from tropical America. *Millingtonia hortensis*, a tall elegant tree with fragrant white flowers, a native of Burma and the Indian Archipelago, is now common in the neighbourhood of Poona, where it grows to perfection; it makes a splendid roadside tree. Belonging also to this family we have in Bombay *Parmentiera cerifera*, the Candle-tree of tropical South America; with *Crescentia cujete*, the Calabash tree, and *C. alata*, both from the same region. *Kigelia pinnata*, a native of Madagascar, is now a not uncommon tree close to Bombay. Its large cylindrical woody fruit, hanging from long slender stalks, give it a strange appearance.\n\n**Pedalieae.**\u2014Two indigenous species of this little order are found in Western India. *Pedalium murex*, an annual plant with yellow flowers and spiny fruit, occurs in the Deccan and in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and Cutch. *Sesamum Indicum*, a well-known plant, is cultivated in many parts of the Presidency, particularly in Kh\u00e1ndesh. Its seeds are the \"Til\" seeds from which gingelly oil is expressed. It is cultivated also in Africa and America. *Martynia diandra*, another plant of this order and a native of tropical America, is now a common roadside weed about Bombay. It bears showy purple flowers and curious hooked fruits.\n\n**Acanthaceae.**\u2014Except for its numbers, and certain botanical affinities regarding this country which its distribution indicates, this large tropical family of shrubs and herbs possesses but a small share of interest. Its genera are diffused throughout the equinoctial regions of both Old and New Worlds, a few species extending into Europe and North America, and southwards to the Cape and Australia. One striking circumstance connected with their distribution is, that nearly all the genera found in the mountainous parts of western tropical Africa are represented also in India, several of them in this Presidency. The spinous *Acanthaceae*, which in this country are chiefly confined to the northern and western regions, are largely represented in the floras of Arabia and Northern and Eastern Africa. Various genera, too, are common both to Western India and the Cape. Hardly more than three of those in our flora are exclusively Indian; all the rest possess African, and a few American and Australian representatives. India is rich in species of this order. Between eighty and ninety, belonging to more than thirty genera, are contained in the Bombay flora. These are distributed principally to the Konkan and Ghats and to the other forest districts. The shrubby species form often the greater portion of the forest undergrowth, in many cases to the exclusion of everything else. Amongst the chief indigenous genera of Western India may be mentioned *Thunbergia*, *Etermeira*, *Hygrophila*, *Ruellia*, *Doodhacanthus*, *Strobilanthes*, *Blepharis*, *Acanthus*, *Barleria*, *Neuracanthus*, *Asystasia*, *Branthemum*, *Andrographis*, *Phlogacanthus*, *Lepidagathis*, *Justicia*, *Adhatoda*, *Rungia*, *Dicliptera*, *Peristrophe*, and *Hypocrites*. Of the first genus *Thunbergia fragrans*, a pretty Konkan climber with white flowers, and *T. Mysorensis*, an extensive climber with red or orange flowers, are often kept in gardens. *T. grandiflora*, another immense climber with large pale blue flowers, a native of Bengal, is also common here, as well as a fourth species, *T. alata*, from Madagascar. *Nelsonia campestris*, the sole member of the genus, is a common weed of the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t; it spreads through nearly all the tropical regions\nof the world. *Hygrophila longifolia* is very abundant about Bombay in swampy places, and is plentiful also in Gujar\u00e1t. Four or five species of the large tropical genus *Ruellia* are also common plants. Two or three varieties of *R. elegans* are cultivated in gardens. Of *Strobilanthes*, another large tropical genus, mostly Asiatic, we have ten or more indigenous species, many of which bear showy flowers. *S. asperrimus* forms a considerable portion of the forest undergrowth and jungle on the Gh\u00e1ts opposite Bombay. *S. elegans*, from Bengal, may frequently be seen in gardens. *Acanthus ilicifolius*, a spiny plant with blue flowers, and leaves exactly resembling those of the Holly, abounds in the salt marshes along the coast; it is indigenous also to Java and Australia. Several species of *Barleria*, a widely spread tropical genus, occur on the Gh\u00e1ts. *B. cristata* and *B. grandiflora* bear showy flowers and are often met with in gardens. *B. prionitis*, a spiny shrub with orange flowers, is perhaps the commonest plant in the Presidency, in every part of which it is found. *Neuracanthus sph\u00e6rostachyus* exists in great abundance in the Konkan. *Andrographis paniculata* is the common \u201cKreat\u201d of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r and is used as a substitute for Gentian. Several species of *Lepidagathis* are Konkan weeds; the genus is also represented in Africa and America. Seven or eight members of the large, widely diffused, tropical genus *Justicia* are indigenous. *J. procumbens*, a common weed, spreads to Africa and Australia. *J. gendarussa*, a native of the Indian Archipelago, is much employed here as an edging for flower beds, and is known to Europeans as \u201cTea border.\u201d Two or three species of *Adhatoda* are Gh\u00e1t and Konkan shrubs. *A. vasica*, common on the Gh\u00e1ts and in Gujar\u00e1t, spreads through tropical Asia and Africa. *A. cydoni\u00e6folia*, a Brazilian plant with beautiful violet flowers, is found often in Bombay gardens. The solitary species of which the genus *Ecbolium* consists, is common throughout the Konkan; it is also indigenous to tropical Africa. *Dicliptera*, of which we possess about four species, is diffused everywhere through the tropics, and spreads also to Australia and Polynesia. *Peristrophe* and *Hypastes* extend to Africa, Madagascar, and Australia. Several exotic species of this order are cultivated here either for their flowers or for their variegated leaves. *Meyenia erecta*, a shrub from Western Africa, has showy blue flowers. Two species of *Aphelandra*, both American plants, bear spikes of handsome red and rose-coloured flowers. The two species which form the Peruvian genus *Fittonia* have recently been introduced; they are elegant foliage plants. *Cryptophyllum pictum*, the Caricature plant, indigenous to the Indian Archipelago, is a familiar Bombay shrub. We possess at least four varieties of it.\n\n**Verbenace\u00e6** form a large and important natural order, most abundant within the tropics. A few species extend into North America and Europe, and to the Cape and Australia. The arboreous species are exclusively tropical. About twenty members of the order are indigenous to this side of India. Of the American genus *Lantana* we have one native representative, *L. alba*, a small shrub found in various parts of the Deccan. *L. camara*, a straggling shrub with red and orange flowers, from Brazil, is now exceedingly common in the Konkan, often forming dense jungles, and spreading rapidly when allowed to do so. In Ceylon it has taken entire possession of extensive tracts of country. *Lippia nodiflora*, a cosmopolitan tropical weed belonging to a large American genus, is very common in sandy ground. *L. citriodora*, a native of South America, is the well-known sweet-scented Verbena of gardens. One species of *Priva*, a common weed, is also indigenous. *Callicarpa lanata*, a straggling shrub or small tree with downy leaves and purple flowers, is very abundant along the higher Gh\u00e1ts. The genus extends to Australia and America. *Tectona grandis*, the Teak, occurs in all the forest districts of the Presidency. In K\u00e1nara-alone, how-\never, does it attain any considerable size, while in the Gh\u00e1t, D\u00e1ng, S\u00e1tpuda, and Gujar\u00e1t forests it is comparatively small. In parts of the North Konkan a stunted growth of this tree forms extensive jungles. A great part of the vegetation on the Gir hills in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r is said to be composed of Teak. Three or four species of *Premna*, a widely diffused tropical genus of shrubs and trees, are frequent in the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t jungles. *P. scandens* is one of the commonest of M\u00e1ther\u00e1n climbers. *Gmelina arborea*, a useful timber tree, is plentiful in both Konkans and in Eastern Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nOf the cosmopolitan genus *Vitex* we possess four or five indigenous species. *V. negundo* is an exceedingly abundant shrub in nearly every part of the Presidency, more especially in the black soil of the Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh. *V. leucoxylon* is a common tree in the South Konkan and about Bombay, and *V. altissima* is an important timber tree of the K\u00e1nares forests. We have at least four indigenous representatives of *Clerodendron*, an extensive tropical genus of shrubs and trees, many of which are cultivated on account of their showy flowers. *C. phlomoides*, a tall white-flowered shrub, is common in the Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t. *C. infortunatum* abounds in parts of the South Konkan as a forest undershrub; it is also cultivated in gardens. *C. inerme*, a straggling shrub with white flowers, is found everywhere near the sea. Like many other sea-coast plants, it has a wide distribution. *C. serratum* is a Konkan shrub with blue flowers. Amongst the introduced species of this genus to be seen in Bombay gardens we have *C. siphonanthus*, a native of Bengal; *C. fragrans*, a Chinese shrub with showy rose-coloured flowers; and *C. aculeatum*, from the West Indies. *C. nutans*, said to be a native of Madagascar, is one of our most elegant flowering shrubs. *C. Thomsoni* and *C. speciosum*, from Western Africa, and *C. squamatum*, a native of China, are also very ornamental flowering shrubs. *Symplocos involucrata* is a South Konkan climber. *Avicennia officinalis*, a shrub or small tree, is common in salt marshes along the coast; it is found on the tropical shores of both Old and New Worlds. Besides those already noticed there are various other exotic species of this order naturalised in Bombay. *Stachytarpheta urticifolia* and *S. mutabilis*, from tropical America, the one with blue and the other with rose-coloured flowers, are both very common herbaceous plants. Three or four species of *Verbena*, chiefly American, are cultivated for their showy flowers. *Petrea volubilis*, from South America, is a well-known climbing shrub with blue flowers. *Duranta Ellisii* and *D. Plumieri*, handsome flowering shrubs, also from tropical America, are found in every garden. *Holmskioldia sanguinea*, a Himalayan shrub with scarlet flowers, is likewise not uncommon.\n\n**LABIATE.**\u2014The greater number of species belonging to this large and important order are found in the temperate regions of the Old World. A considerable proportion are, however, distributed to the tropics. In this country several genera prevail in the plains and warmer districts, and these, more especially, display African and Australian affinities. The genera which are most common in the Him\u00e1layas show on the contrary affinities to the vegetation of very different regions. The Bombay flora contains about fifty species, and, with one exception, these are all herbaceous plants, many of them appearing only during the rainy season. They are chiefly distributed to the Konkan and Gh\u00e1t districts. Amongst our principal indigenous genera may be mentioned the widely spread genus *Ocimum*, of which at least three species out of the five or six found here occur also in Africa. *O. canum*, *O. basilicum*, and *O. gratissimum* are all common. *O. sanctum* is the well-known sacred \u201cTulsi.\u201d *Moschona*, *Acrocephalus*, *Orthosiphon*, and *Plectranthus*, all African genera, have each one or two representatives in Western India. *M. polystachyum*, of the first,\nis the cultivated Mint-basil; it occurs wild in the Konkan and extends to Africa and Australia. *P. rotundifolius*, of the last, is a creeping Konkan plant, and is also widely distributed elsewhere in the tropics. *Coleus barbatus*, indigenous to the Deccan, extends to Arabia. *C. aromaticus* is the so-called \"Borage\" of Bombay gardens. Several introduced species and varieties of this genus are cultivated here for their ornamental foliage.\n\nTwo species of *Lavandula* are Deccan plants; they may also be seen in gardens, together with *L. vera*, the common Lavender, a British plant. The genus is further distributed to South Europe, Egypt, Arabia, and Persia. Of the Indian genus *Anisochilus* we possess three or four indigenous species, and of *Pogostemon* and *Dysophylla*, also Asiatic genera, six or seven each. Nearly all are Gh\u00e1t and Konkan plants. *Pogostemon purpuricaulis* grows in great abundance, as forest undergrowth, on the higher Gh\u00e1ts. Its leaves have a strong odour of black currants. *P. Patchouli*, a native of the Eastern Archipelago, is the cultivated \"P\u00e1ch.\" *Colebrookia ternifolia* is a very common shrub, especially on the Deccan side of the Gh\u00e1ts. One aromatic species of the cosmopolitan genus *Mieromesia* grows in wet places on the higher Gh\u00e1ts. *Silvia plebeia*, also an Australian plant, is our only indigenous representative of a genus numbering 450 species. *S. coccinia*, a native of America, is cultivated in Bombay gardens, and so is *S. officinalis*, the common Sage. Of *Nepeta* and *Scutellaria*, large genera belonging to temperate regions, we possess also but a single representative each. *Anisomeles*, a small but widely diffused genus of the Old World tropics, gives us three or four species. Of *Lencas*, a genus distributed to nearly all parts of the tropics, we have ten or twelve indigenous species. *L. aspera*, a Konkan plant, spreads to Africa. *L. cephalotes*, *L. linifolia*, and *L. urticaefolia* are found in Gujar\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and Cutch. *Leonotis nepetifolia*, with orange and red flowers, is a common plant about Bombay and in parts of the Deccan. It is a doubtful native, however, and has probably been introduced from Africa, where it is certainly indigenous. In addition to those previously mentioned there are a few other exotic species of this family cultivated in Western India, either as ornamental plants or for their aromatic properties. Amongst these are *Mentha arvensis*, the common Mint; *Origanum Majorana*, the Marjoram; and *Thymus vulgaris*, the Thyme. *Rosmarinus officinalis*, the Rosemary, is occasionally seen in Deccan gardens.\n\n**Nyctaginaceae** is a small order widely diffused through the warmer regions of the globe. Our only indigenous representatives are five or six species of the cosmopolitan tropical genus *Boerhavia*. These are small plants found chiefly in the Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t. *B. diffusa* and *B. repanda* occur in the Konkan, the first especially being one of the commonest weeds. Both are spread over the whole of India and extend also to Africa and Australia. *B. repens*, too, has a wide distribution. *Pisonia morindifolia*, the familiar Lettuce-tree, a native of Java; three species of *Bougainvillea*, indigenous to Brazil; and *Mirabilis jalapa*, the Marvel of Peru, belong to this order. They are all too well known in Bombay gardens to need further notice.\n\n**Polygonaceae** is a considerable order, dispersed over every part of the world. They inhabit chiefly, however, the north temperate zone, are much less frequent in the tropics, and are comparatively rare in southern regions. The Bombay flora possesses but six or seven species. Two at least of the cosmopolitan genus *Rumez* are indigenous, namely, *R. Wallichii* and *R. dentatus*. Both are found in the Konkan, and the latter in the Deccan. *R. vesicarius*, the Bladder Dock, is cultivated as a potherb in the Deccan. Of the large and equally wide-spread genus *Polygonum* we have about four species. *P. glabrum* and *P. rivulare* are common in the water-courses of\nthe Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh, the latter, too, in Gujar\u00e1t. *P. Chinense* occurs on the higher Gh\u00e1ts, and *P. elegans* in Gujar\u00e1t and Cutch. *Antigonon leptopus*, a charming American climber lately introduced, as well as *Fagopyrum tataricum*, one of the varieties of Buck-wheat, belong to this order. The first is now common in Bombay gardens and the second is cultivated in the Deccan.\n\n**Amarantaceae.**\u2014In the rainy season the herbaceous plants of this cosmopolitan tropical family abound in the plains of India. The Bombay flora contains between twenty and thirty species, some of which are among the most widely distributed weeds of warm countries. *Deeringia celosio\u00efdes*, *Celosia argentea*, and three or four species of *Amaranthus*, are all common; the first extends to Australia and the second to Africa. *A. paniculatus* is cultivated in the Deccan for its seeds. *A. tristis* and *A. spinosus* are cosmopolitan tropical weeds, and are much used here as pothersbs. *A. salicifolius*, from the Philippines, together with other species and varieties, all with brilliant crimson or deep purple foliage, are well-known ornamental plants of Bombay gardens. *Amblygyne polygonoides*, *Menega tenuifolia*, and *Eucozolus oleraceus* are also common indigenous pothersbs. *Psilotrichum sericeum* is an abundant weed during the rains. Several species of the widely distributed genus *Aorea* are natives of Western India. Of these *A. lanata* and *A. brachiat*, both also African plants, are the most frequent. *A. javanica* and *A. monsonia* occur in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and Cutch. *Achyranthes aspera*, a cosmopolitan tropical species, grows in all parts of the Presidency. *Digera arvensis* is very common, as is also another universally diffused tropical plant *Cyathula prostrata*. *Pupalia atropurpurea* occurs near the coast in Gujar\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and Cutch, and spreads to Africa. *Alternanthera sessilis*, a small weed, abounds everywhere; it is also indigenous to tropical Africa and America. *Gomphrena globosa*, the Globe Amaranth, a doubtful native of this country, is common in gardens. A species of *Iresine*, an ornamental plant with deep crimson leaves, is also frequent in Bombay.\n\n**Chenopodiaceae.**\u2014This order is found principally in temperate regions, and generally in maritime localities. Of our three or four indigenous species, *Atriplex Stockei*, a small shrubby plant, occurs in Gujar\u00e1t. *Salicornia Indica*, *Sweda nudiflora*, and *S. Indica* are all abundant in salt ground near the coast, especially of Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. Other plants of these two genera exist in similar situations in many parts of the world. They contain a quantity of saline matter and are burnt for Barilla in all places where they are found in sufficient quantities. The succulent stems of *Salicornia Indica* are often eaten here as a vegetable, and the impure Carbonate of Soda, or \"Kh\u00e1r,\" so much used in Bombay, and brought from Sind and Arabia, is procured by burning the two last-mentioned species. *Chenopodium ambrosioides*, a widely diffused aromatic weed, native of America, is occasionally seen about Bombay. *Beta vulgaris*, the common Beet, a member of this order, is cultivated in Western India.\n\n**Myristicaceae** is a small order of which only two species are indigenous to this Presidency\u2014*Myristica attenuata* and *M. Malabarica*. These are lofty trees found on the Gh\u00e1ts and in the Konkan, the latter also in K\u00e1nara. They bear fruit like nutmegs, but much less aromatic. *M. moschata*, a native of the Indian Archipelago, is the Nutmeg. In Bombay this tree will grow only near the sea.\n\n**Laurineae** is an important order of aromatic shrubs and trees distributed chiefly to tropical regions, more especially those of Asia and America. They are very rare in Africa and a few are found in Australia. Not more than ten or twelve are indigenous to Western India, and these, with one\nexception, are common Gh\u00e1t and Konkan trees. Amongst them are two species of *Machilus* and one of *Alseodaphne*. *Beilschmiedia Roeburghiana* and *Cryptocarya floribunda* are both plentiful on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. *C. australis*, a Queensland tree, was introduced into Bombay a few years since. *Tetrantha laurifolia* is also a common tree: it extends to Australia. One of the most abundant trees of the higher Gh\u00e1ts, particularly so at Mah\u00e1balesh\u00edvar, is *Actinodaphne lanceolata*. Two other indigenous trees are *Cylicodaphne Wightiana* and *Litssea Zeylanica*: the latter has a wide range, spreading to Australia. *Cassytha filiformis*, a curious parasitic plant of this order and a member of an Australian genus, is cosmopolitan in the tropics. In Western India it is found everywhere, but is commonest in the Deccan, where its yellow thread-like masses may be observed covering the Milk-bush hedges or the B\u00e1b\u00fal trees. *Laurus nobilis*, the Sweet Bay, a native of South Europe, is sometimes found in Bombay gardens. A few specimens exist, too, of *Cinnamomum Zeylanicum* the true Cinnamon. *C. camphora*, the Camphor tree, has recently been introduced and appears likely to thrive well in this climate. *Persea gratissima*, the Avocado Pear of tropical America, is said to be occasionally seen in Deccan gardens.\n\n**Thymelaeae** is a considerable order inhabiting principally the temperate regions of both hemispheres. *Lasiosiphon speciosus*, a small shrub with yellow flowers, is the only species which occurs in the Bombay flora. It is exceedingly common on the Gh\u00e1t and Konkan hills. The plant is highly poisonous, and a silky fibre may be procured from its bark.\n\n**Elaeagnaceae**.\u2014Our sole indigenous representative of this little order is *Elaeagnus latifolia*, a large woody climber very common along the higher Gh\u00e1ts. It extends through the Eastern Archipelago to Australia. The genus, which is the principal one of the order, is widely distributed: other species occur in Persia, South Europe, and North America.\n\n**Urticaceae**.\u2014Of this large and important order the Bombay flora possesses but an inconsiderable proportion of representatives. The majority of these are trees and the remainder herbaceous plants. *Celtis Roeburghii* and *Trema orientalis*, members of very widely spread genera, are two common Gh\u00e1t and Konkan trees; the latter is indigenous also to Africa and Australia. *Ulmus integrifolia*, a large timber tree, is found in many parts of India: here it occurs in the Konkan and K\u00e1nara, but would seem to be most abundant on the S\u00e1tpuda and Western Kh\u00e1ndesh hills. Other species of this genus are the Elms of Great Britain. The important genus *Artocarpus* gives us at least three indigenous species. Of these *A. integrifolia*, the common Jack tree, is well-known: it is planted in nearly every part of the Presidency, but is found truly wild only towards the south. *A. hirsuta* and *A. Lakoocha* are Konkan and Gh\u00e1t trees. *A. incisa*, a native of the Eastern Archipelago and Polynesia, and often seen in Bembay, is the Breadfruit. Of the great cosmopolitan tropical genus *Ficus* we possess sixteen or eighteen indigenous species only. Certain trees of this genus form a characteristic feature of nearly every Indian landscape. The best known in this part of the country\u2014too well-known indeed to require any detailed notice, are *F. Indica*, the Banian; *F. religiosa*, the \"Pipal;\" *F. retusa*, the \"Nandruk;\" and *F. glomerata*, the \"Umbar.\" Amongst the others *F. Tsiela*, *F. tomentosa*, *F. cordifolia*, and *F. asperrima* are the commonest. *F. volubile* is a climbing Gh\u00e1t shrub. The chief of the remaining indigenous species, all of less interest than those just mentioned, are *F. Lambertiana*, *F. infectoria*, *F. benjamina*, *F. acutiloba*, *F. heterophyllum*, and *F. hispida*. The India-rubber tree, *F. elastica*, a native of Assam, has of late years become rather frequent in the vicinity of Bombay.\nF. Carica, which is probably a native of Persia, is the cultivated Fig. The best Figs sold in Bombay are grown at Poona. The Australian Banian, *F. macrophylla*, has been recently introduced from Queensland; and *F. eburnea*, from Bengal, is now becoming a common ornamental garden shrub. *Antiaris innocua* is a large forest tree found along the Gh\u00e2ts and in the Konkan and K\u00e2nara. Its fibrous bark removed whole from a section of the trunk forms a natural bag or sack. *A. toxicaria*, the famous Upas tree of Java, was introduced into Bombay a few years ago; and so far the climate appears to agree with it perfectly. *Streblus asper*, a small crooked tree with rough leaves, is very abundant in the Konkan, but somewhat less so in other parts of the Presidency. Two species of *Elatostemma*, herbaceous plants, grow in the Gh\u00e2t and Konkan jungles. *Debregeasia longifolia*, a large shrub, is common in the same localities, and *D. naucleiflora*, a large woody climber, occurs in the South Konkan. *B\u00e6hmeria scabrella* is a shrubby plant found chiefly in the Konkan. *B. nivea*, the China-grass or Rhea, a native of Assam and the Archipelago, grows luxuriantly in Bombay, where it has been naturalised for many years. Our flora contains also four or five members of the widely spread genus *Pouzolsia*. *P. Indica*, also an Australian plant, with one or two others, are some of the commonest monsoon weeds. Besides the above we have two indigenous species, which may be referred to the cosmopolitan genus *Urtica*, namely, *U. interrupta*, an exceedingly abundant weed during the rainy season, and *U. heterophylla*, a large and formidable stinging nettle found in the dense Gh\u00e2t jungles towards the south. A strong and useful fibre may be prepared from the latter species. The first stings, too, but slightly, and in appearance closely resembles the common European Nettle, *U. dioica*, which, it may be mentioned, once appeared in Bombay as an introduced weed, but has since vanished. Various species or varieties of Mulberry, belonging to this order, are cultivated in Western India, both for their leaves as food for silkworms and for their fruit. The commonest of these are *Morus alba*, with white or red fruit; and *M. Indica*, *M. nigra*, and *M. atropurpurea*, with dark purple or black fruit. Another plant of this order, the well-known *Cannabis sativa*, the Hemp, is cultivated in the eastern parts of the Deccan and in the Southern Mar\u00e2tha Country.\n\nA single species of the Australian genus *Casuarina* and natural order Casuarin\u00e6\u2014*C. equisetifolia*\u2014is indigenous to India; spreading thence from Australia, to which country the rest of the order is confined. It is a large fast-growing timber tree, well known about Bombay, where it is commonly planted. As a firewood and timber tree its merits are decidedly not so well appreciated here as they deserve.\n\nThe Willow order, Salicace\u00e6, which is distributed chiefly to the temperate and cold regions of the northern hemisphere, has one representative in the Bombay flora. *Salix tetrasperma* is a shrub or small tree found in moist places along the highest Gh\u00e2ts. *S. babylonica*, a native of Persia or Afghanistan, may often be seen in Bombay gardens.\n\nEuphorbiace\u00e6, a great natural order containing upwards of 3,000 species, is distributed to all parts of the world except the coldest regions. It is most abundant within the tropics, especially of America. From four to five hundred species\u2014herbs, shrubs, and trees, occur in India, and many of these are characterised by the possession of acrid milky or watery juice, which in some cases is of a highly poisonous nature. The Bombay flora contains, at the utmost, not more than seventy species. Some of these are very widely distributed, and several of our genera are common to tropical Africa, America, Australia, and Polynesia. The immense genus *Euphorbia*, comprising upwards of 700 species, and dispersed to most parts of the world,\nis represented here by twelve or fourteen only. *E. neriifolia*, a spiny cactus-like plant, is the common Milk-bush. It abounds on the Gh\u00e2ts and on the Deccan and Kh\u00e2ndesh hills, and is extensively used as a hedge plant all over the Presidency. *E. navulia*, which much resembles it in appearance, is common in Gujar\u00e2t, K\u00e2thi\u00e2war, and Cutch, and in parts of the Deccan and Kh\u00e2ndesh. *E. antiquorum* has the same habit as the preceding two species, but is much less frequent, being found only in the extreme southern districts. *E. acaulis*, a stemless plant with a large root, occurs on the Gh\u00e2ts and Deccan hills; *E. oreophila* on the Gh\u00e2ts and in Gujar\u00e2t; and *E. thymifolia*, *E. pilulifera*, and *E. parviflora* are common annual weeds seen everywhere. The two first are widely spread through the tropics. *E. Rothiana*, *E. uniflora* and *E. elegans* are Konkan plants. *E. tirucalli*, the Smooth Milk-bush, a native of Brazil, is now a universal hedge plant in the Deccan and Gujar\u00e2t; and *E. splendens*, a thorny shrub with red flowers, a native of South America, is common in gardens. Two species of *Antidesma*, *A. diandra* and *A. Ghasembilla*, are small Konkan trees with edible fruits; the latter extends to Australia. *Actephila excelsa* is a Gh\u00e2t tree, and *Sauropus ceratogynum* a small Konkan shrub. Of the large cosmopolitan genus *Phyllanthus* we possess only ten or twelve of the 480 species which it contains. *P. nitidus*, a large shrub, grows in wet places in the South Konkan. *P. lanceolarius* is one of the most abundant trees of the higher Gh\u00e2ts. *P. reticulatus*, a large climber, occurs all over the Presidency. *P. emblica* is a well-known Gh\u00e2t tree with edible fruit. *P. polyphyllus*, *P. Lawii*, *P. maderaspatanus*, and *P. simplex* are Konkan shrubs and herbs; the two latter spread to Australia and the last mentioned also to Africa. *P. Niruri* is an exceedingly common weed everywhere during the rains, and is distributed to nearly every part of the tropics. *P. Indicus* is a tree of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *P. distichus*, from the Eastern Archipelago, is a common garden tree, and its acid fruit, called by Europeans \u201cCountry Gooseberry,\u201d is eaten. *P. epiphyllanthus* is a curious West Indian shrub occasionally seen in Bombay gardens. Abundant in the Konkan jungles are *Melanthesopis patens* and *Putranjiva Roxburghii*, both trees; with *Securinega obovata* and *S. leucopyrus*, shrubs. The first is equally abundant in Eastern Gujar\u00e2t. The two latter are also indigenous to Australia. *Aporosa Lindleyana* and *Bischoffia Javanica*, with two species of *Hemicyclea*, are trees of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts and Konkan. *Briedelia montana* is a very common tree at M\u00e2ther\u00e2n and along the Gh\u00e2ts, and quite as abundant in the Konkan is *B. stipularis*, a climbing shrub. Of the immense and widely diffused tropical genus *Croton* we have about six indigenous species\u2014mostly Konkan trees: two of these, *C. reticulatus* and *C. oblongifolius*, are rather handsome trees. One species occurs in the Deccan. The familiar \u201cLaurel\u201d of Bombay gardens, a shrub with green and yellow leaves, is *C. variegatum*, a native of the Indian Archipelago. Numerous other species and varieties of the same genus have of late years been introduced here as ornamental plants. *Agrostistachys Indica* is a shrub of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts, and *Crozophora plicata* an annual plant of the Deccan and Gujar\u00e2t. *Acalypha Indica*, an abundant weed of the rainy season, is our single representative of a considerable and widely dispersed tropical genus. *A. Wilksiana* is an ornamental shrub, with scarlet and brown leaves, from the Fiji Islands: introduced into Bombay only a few years ago, it has since spread all over Western India. *Tragia involucra*, belonging to a cosmopolitan tropical genus, is a common Gh\u00e2t twiner; its leaves sting like a nettle. *Trevia nudiflora* is a handsome Konkan tree. Five or six species of *Mallotus*, another widely distributed genus of trees and shrubs, are indigenous: they all occur along the Gh\u00e2ts and in the Konkan and K\u00e2nara. The commonest and best known of them is *M. Philippensis*, which is also found in\nAustralia. The red powder with which its fruit is covered is used as a dye and as a vermifuge. *Macaranga peltata*, a tree, abounds on the Gh\u00e2ts. Two species of *Homonoya* and two or three of *Jatropha* are Deccan shrubs: they are plentiful in water-courses. Of the latter genus we possess three naturalised American species.\u2014*J. curcas*, the Physic nut, is common everywhere and is largely used as a hedge plant. The others are *J. multifida*, the French Physic nut, and *J. gossypifolium*. *Givotia Rottleriformis* is a small Deccan tree, and *Baliospermum montanum* a Konkan and Gujar\u00e2t perennial. *Sebastiana chamelea*, another Konkan weed, spreads to Australia and tropical Africa. Two species of the cosmopolitan tropical genus, *Excoecaria*, *E. Agallocha* and *E. insignis*, are indigenous trees containing poisonous milky juice: the one occurs in salt marshes along the coast, and extends to Australia, and the other is a rather infrequent Gh\u00e1t tree. *E. sebifera*, the Chinese Wax-tree, is occasionally seen here in gardens. Amongst our remaining naturalised plants of this order may be mentioned *Pedilanthus tithymaloides*, a little West Indian shrub much used as a border plant. *Poinsettia pulcherrima*, a Mexican shrub, is, with its bright scarlet bracts, a conspicuous object in Bombay gardens during the cold season. *Aleurites Moluccana*, a native of Australia and the Pacific Islands, is a handsome tree often planted near Konkan and Deccan villages. Europeans know it as the Bengal Walnut: the kernel of its fruit is eatable and resembles somewhat the English Walnut. *Ricinus communis*, the Castor-oil plant, is familiar to all. The Cassava or Tapioca, *Manihot utilissima*, a South American shrub, is frequently seen in Bombay. Although it flourishes in this climate, it seems strange that its systematic cultivation has not as yet been undertaken.\n\n*Aristolochiaceae* is a small tropical order, distributed principally to Asia, South America, and Australia. *Brugantia Wallichii* is a shrubby plant found in the South Konkan and common in K\u00e2nara. *Aristolochia acuminata*, belonging to a large cosmopolitan tropical genus, is a Konkan climber. *A. Indica* is sparingly scattered over most districts of the Presidency, and extends to Australia. *A. bracteata* grows in the Deccan, Gujar\u00e2t, and Cutch, and about Bombay. *A. ringens* and *A. ornithocephala*, natives of Brazil, are common climbers in our gardens. The strangely shaped, mottled, evil-smelling flowers of the latter are well known.\n\n*Loranthaceae*, the Mistletoe order, are all parasitic plants and are most abundant in tropical countries. Ten or twelve species of *Loranthus* occur on trees in the Bombay forest districts. The commonest of these, and found in nearly all parts of the Presidency, is *L. longiflorus*: it grows chiefly on Mango trees and, if not stripped off in time, eventually destroys them. About Bombay, however, many other trees, particularly the two kinds of silk-cotton trees, are subject to its depredations. This species extends to Australia. The remaining indigenous plans of the genus occur principally on Gh\u00e1t trees, but may also be found in Kh\u00e2ndesh and Gujar\u00e2t. Besides the above, the Bombay flora possesses two species of the widely-spread genus *Viscum*. Both of these\u2014*V. angulatum* and *V. attenuatum*\u2014grow on Konkan and Gh\u00e1t trees. The first spreads to Australia, but the second is by far the commonest in Western India. The Mistletoe, *V. album*, a well-known British plant, is found also on the Him\u00e1layas.\n\n*Santalaceae.\u2014Santalum album*, the Sandal-wood, is a small tree indigenous to the Southern Deccan districts, but planted about Poona and in other parts of the Presidency. Several Australian and Polynesian species of this genus also yield Sandal-wood. *Sphaerocarya leprosa* is a small tree of the South Konkan, and *Osyris arborea*, a shrub, is common on the Gh\u00e2ts.\nPiperaceae, the Pepper order, consisting almost entirely of two large genera, range very widely through the tropics. Of the genus *Piper*, containing upwards of 600 species, we have only two representatives. *P. sylvestre* and *P. Hookeri*, climbing plants rooting at the joints, are abundant on rocks and trees along the higher Gh\u00e2ts. *P. nigrum*, the Black Pepper; *P. cubeba*, the Cubeb; *P. longum*, the Long Pepper; and the familiar *P. Betle*, the \u201cP\u00e1n,\u201d are all to be found in Bombay gardens. The Black Pepper is largely cultivated in the South Konkan. *Peperomia portulacoides*, a member of another immense cosmopolitan tropical genus, is a creeping plant occurring on rocks and trees of the South Konkan and K\u00e2nara.\n\nThe small cosmopolitan aquatic orders Ceratophyllaceae and Podostemaceae are both represented in the Bombay flora. The first consists of a single species only, *Ceratophyllum demersum*, which is common in tanks: it is found in most parts of the world. Of the second order we have five or six species of *Terniola* and one of *Podostemon\u2014P. Hookerianus\u2014all of which are minute plants of the Konkan streams.\n\nGnetaceae, another small but widely distributed order, is represented in Western India by a climbing shrub, *Gnetum scandens*. This is plentiful in the denser Gh\u00e1t jungles, and spreads to the Eastern Archipelago and China. The genus itself extends to tropical America.\n\nAlthough we possess no indigenous species of the large and important order Coniferae, there are yet several exotic trees and shrubs belonging to it, and now more or less common in Bombay, which deserve mention. Amongst these are *Araucaria excelsa* and *A. Cookii*, the Norfolk Island Pines; and *A. Cunninghamii* and *A. Bidwilli*, the Moreton Bay Pines. All these have been introduced from Australia within the last twelve or fifteen years, but that they will ever become thoroughly naturalised in this part of India is doubtful. A few species of *Juniperus* and *Cupressus* are also pretty common. *C. sempervirens*, the Cypress, flourishes at Poona, and *C. glauca* is frequent in Bombay gardens. The Arbor-vit\u00e6, *Thuja orientalis*, a Chinese tree, grows well in Bombay. *Podocarpus elongata*, a tree from the Cape, is occasionally seen here. Of Cycad\u00e6ce, an order closely allied to the preceding, we possess also but a few exotic species. One of these, very frequently met with about Bombay, is *Cycas circinalis*, a native of Southern India and Ceylon. Europeans call it the \u201cSago Palm,\u201d doubtless from its palm-like habit of growth and from the fact that a starchy substance resembling sago may be obtained from its trunk. The true Sago Palm, *Sagus lewisii*, is, however, a member of the natural order Palmae. *C. revoluta*, a Japanese plant, is smaller than the first mentioned, and is less common here. *Encephalartos horridus*, an ornamental species of this order and a native of South Africa, may be found in a few Bombay gardens. It is a plant of extremely slow growth.\n\nIn the class Monocotyledons are included the following indigenous natural orders:\n\nThe first on the list is Hydrocharide\u00e6, an inconsiderable but widely diffused order of small aquatic herbs. Three or four species are found in tanks throughout Western India. Two of these, *Ottelia alismoides* and *Hydrilla verticillata*, are also Australian plants. The latter is the most abundant of all our aquatic weeds. A third species is *Vallisneria alternifolia*. A fourth, *V. spiralis*, is cosmopolitan.\n\nScitamine\u00e6.\u2014Of this large tropical family we possess between twenty and thirty indigenous representatives, which are almost exclusively distributed to the moist forest districts. Two species of the important genus\nMusa, M. ornata, and M. superba, the well-known wild Plantains, are very abundant along the Gh\u00e2ts. The first is found chiefly on the Southern Gh\u00e2ts and in K\u00e2nara, and the second is common throughout the whole range. The cultivated Plantain, of which we have numerous varieties, is M. paradisiaca. M. coccinea, a native of China, is common in Bombay gardens and may be recognised by its head or brilliant scarlet bracts. M. zebrina and vittata, American species, together with M. Africana, from tropical Africa, were introduced a few years ago and may now often be seen in gardens. Globba marantioides, with fragrant yellow flowers, is found in the South Konkan. Five or six species of Zingiber are common in the Konkan and Gh\u00e2t jungles. They have generally showy pink and yellow flowers. Ginger is the root-stock of Z. officinale, a plant much cultivated in Western India. Hedychium scaposum occurs near rivers in the South Konkan and K\u00e2nara. H. flavum, a native of Bengal, is a handsome plant occasionally found in gardens. The important Asiatic genus Curcuma gives us seven or eight indigenous species. C. angustifolia with yellow, and C. decipiens with purple flowers, occur in the South Konkan. C. zedoaria, another Konkan plant, has large rose-coloured bracts. Its rhizome is one of the varieties of the drug \u201cZedoary.\u201d C. caulina is common at Mah\u00e2b\u00e2leshvar and on the higher Gh\u00e2ts elsewhere, and C. amada occurs in the Konkan and Gujar\u00e2t. Turmeric is the rhizome of the cultivated C. longa. Alpinia Allughas, with fine rose-coloured flowers, grows in moist places in the South Konkan. A. galangas and A. calcarata occur in the same district. A. nutans, a native of China and the Indian Archipelago, is a common ornament of Bombay gardens. Costus speciosus, a member of a widely-spread tropical genus, is a very showy plant, with large pure white flowers; it abounds on the banks of the Konkan rivers. Phrynium capitatum, a small plant with pink flowers, grows in the Konkan jungles. Amongst the naturalised plants of the order we find three species of Heliconia, a tropical American genus. Ravenala Madagascariensis, the Water tree or Traveller\u2019s tree of Madagascar, is now pretty frequent in Bombay. It looks like a gigantic Plantain with its leaves arranged in the form of a fan; and it receives its common name from the circumstance that large quantities of water, derived either from rain, or from dew deposited on the surface of the leaf, are usually found stored at the lower part of the sheathing leaf stalk. Amomum Zeylanicum and K\u0153mpferia rotunda, from Ceylon and Southern India respectively, are both ornamental garden plants. Elettaria Cardamomum, the common Cardamom, is cultivated in K\u00e2nara. Several species of Cannna, a large American genus, are now abundant in Western India, the commonest being C. Indica, C. discolor, and C. lutea. Of late years many species of the ornamental foliaged American genera Calathea and Maranta have been introduced. M. arundinacea, the West Indian Arrowroot, exists in a few gardens, and, judging from its luxuriant growth, is capable of being profitably cultivated in Bombay.\n\nOrchide\u00e6.\u2014This large and very distinct natural order comprises upwards of 3,000 species, which may be arranged in two great divisions\u2014viz., epiphytal orchids which grow on other plants, and terrestrial orchids which derive their nutriment direct from the soil. The first division is confined to the moister parts of the tropics, and is specially abundant in South America, India, Burma, and the islands of the Eastern Archipelago. The terrestrial species occur chiefly in temperate regions, and also, but to a much less degree, in the tropics. Epiphytal species appear to favour a warm and, above all, a perennially moist climate, and for this reason they are far less abundant in Bombay, where the greater portion of the year is dry, than in other and more congenial parts of India. Hardly more than thirty epiphytal species are indigenous, inhabiting principally\nthe Gh\u00e1t districts. Of terrestrial orchids there are nearly as many more, and these are distributed to the Konkan, the higher Gh\u00e1ts, and to parts of the Deccan. For this comparative paucity of species the immense number of individuals in a few cases may in some measure compensate. The plants of this order are chiefly prized for their beautiful and curious flowers, but of our indigenous species not more than four or five are worthy of cultivation. Compared in this respect, however, with the orchids of other parts of the world, the Asiatic members of the order decidedly bear off the palm. Amongst the species found in Western India two of Oberonia occur on Gh\u00e1t trees. Of the large cosmopolitan tropical genus Dendrobium we have five or six representatives, none of which are noted for any special floral beauty: they are common on trees all along the Gh\u00e1ts. Cirrhopteridium fimbriatum, an elegant plant with red and cream-coloured flowers, occurs on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. Eria iraccuta is a delicate little orchid common on the trees near Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Two other species occur in the South Konkan. One species each of Microstilis, Pholidota, Cottonia, Micropora, and Sarcanthus are found on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. Saccolabium Blumei, a most beautiful plant, is very abundant on the mango trees in S\u00e1lsette, as are also S. papillosum, with insignificant greenish flowers, and S. rubrum, with rose-coloured flowers. The latter grows, too, on the \"mhows\" trees in Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t. Two or three other members of this genus are found along the Southern Gh\u00e1ts. Two species of the terrestrial genus Geodorum occur in the South Konkan. Of Eulophia, another terrestrial genus, we have four or five representatives. E. pratensis is common in the Deccan, and the others are Konkan plants. Aerides includes more than one handsome species. A. crispa abound on trees and rocks at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, its large purple and rose-coloured flowers making it a conspicuous object during the hot season. A. Lindleyanum and A. maculosum, less handsome species, are common in S\u00e1lsette. A. Wightianum, with yellow flowers, is found in the South Konkan. A very large orchid, Cymbidium aloefolium is common on Konkan trees. One species of Lauzia occurs in the South Konkan. Pogonia, Spiranthes, Cheirostylis, and Monochilus, all terrestrial genera, are each represented by a single species, found on the Gh\u00e1ts to the south. Spiranthes Australis, our indigenous plant, has a very wide range, extending over part of Europe, and through Asia to Australia and New Zealand. Other members of this genus are American. Of the large cosmopolitan terrestrial genus Habenaria we have seventeen or eighteen indigenous species. These are distributed chiefly to the Konkan and Gh\u00e1ts, with a few also to the Deccan. All have white or yellowish-green flowers, which in some cases are delicately fragrant. H. rariflora is exceedingly common at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, flowering in the hot season. The principal species, however, is H. Susanne, the giant Orchis; this grows on the bleakest parts of the higher Gh\u00e1ts opposite Bombay, and occasionally on some of the South Konkan hills. It has a stem about four feet in height, and bears large white flowers. It is also a native of China and the Archipelago. Two species of Peristylis, the last indigenous genus on our list, occur in the South Konkan and a third in the Deccan. But few introduced plants of this order are to be seen in Bombay. Vanilla aromatica, a Mexican plant, appears to thrive fairly so far as stem and leaves are concerned, but not so well as in a moister climate. It has not yet fruited here. Phalaenopsis grandiflora, a native of Java, is a splendid species, and flowers freely in Bombay. Phayus Blumei, another handsome orchid from the same island, is occasionally seen in gardens.\n\nBurmanniaceae and Taccaceae are two small orders each represented in the Bombay flora by a single species. Burmannia triflora, belonging to a cosmopolitan genus, is a small herbaceous plant with purple flowers, found\nsparingly in the Konkan. *Taccapinnatifida*, a stemless plant with green flowers and a large tuberous root, is common in the same district. It has a wide range over the Archipelago, Australia, and the islands of Polynesia. The root contains much starch, which is occasionally eaten.\n\n**AMARYLLID\u00c6.**\u2014This important order is distributed principally to warm dry countries. It is represented in the flora of Western India by twelve or fourteen species belonging to three genera. Three species of *Curculigo*, a small but widely spread tropical genus, are little plants with yellow flowers and grass-like leaves, occurring along the higher Gh\u00e2ts. They are very common at Mah\u00e1baleshwar at the beginning of the rains. Of the cosmopolitan genus *Crinum*, *C. Asiaticum* is our commonest species. It is a large bulbous, very poisonous plant, with white flowers, and abounds near the Konkan rivers and the coast: it extends to Australia and the Archipelago, and in Bombay is often planted in gardens. A very similar plant, *C. Roeburghii*, occurs on the banks of the Deccan rivers. *C. augustum*, with fragrant rose-coloured flowers, is found in the same localities. *C. brochymene*, a handsome species, also with fragrant flowers, grows on the higher Gh\u00e2ts. *Pancratium parvum*, a beautiful lily-like plant with showy white flowers, abounds on the Gh\u00e2t and Konkan hills. Of the important American genus *Agave* of this order, *A. cantala* and *A. Americana* have become naturalised in Western India. The former occurs abundantly in parts of the Konkan and Deccan and on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e2ts. Both yield valuable fibre. A third species, with stiff thorny leaves, quite a formidable plant, is used about Poona for fencing purposes. *Fourcroya gigantea*, another American species, with its enormous sword-shaped leaves and tall flower stem, is a conspicuous plant in Bombay gardens. *Zephyranthes rosea* and *Amaryllis equestris*, West Indian flowering plants, are very common here.\n\n**DIOSCORID\u00c6** are twining herbs with large tuberous roots which contain abundance of starch. Six or seven species of *Dioscorea* are plentiful in the Konkan and Gh\u00e2t jungles and the other forest districts of the Presidency. *D. pentaphylla* has fragrant flowers which are eaten as a vegetable. The root of *D. oppositifolia* is also eaten. The genus is dispersed throughout most tropical countries. Yams are the roots of *D. sativa*, *D. globosa*, and *D. aculeata*, all of which are much cultivated in Bombay. The first is indigenous and abounds in the Konkan. It spreads through the Indian Archipelago to Australia.\n\n**LILIACE\u00c6.**\u2014This large order, like the *Amaryllid\u00e6*, is distributed chiefly to dry and warm countries, and is most abundant in the south of Europe and at the Cape. In Western India it is very sparingly represented, not more than twenty species, at the outside, being indigenous. Of the large cosmopolitan genus *Smilax*, *S. ovalifolia* is our sole indigenous representative. It is a common climbing plant of the Gh\u00e2t jungles and of some of the other forest districts. The Sarsaparilla of the Pharmacopoeia, *S. officinalis*, a native of Central America, was introduced into Bombay a few years since: it promises to succeed well in this climate. *Flagellaria Indica* is a tall climber, with white flowers and red berries, found along the coast. It extends to Australia and Africa. *Asparagus sarmentosus* is another climber, abundant on the higher Gh\u00e2ts and in the Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t. Being a rather ornamental plant, with graceful feathery foliage and fragrant white flowers, it is a frequent inhabitant of gardens. *A. officinalis*, the well-known vegetable, a European and British species, is occasionally cultivated in gardens in the northern parts of the Presidency. Six or seven species of *Chlorophytum*, a genus extending to Africa and Australia, occur on the Gh\u00e2ts and in the Konkan. *C. tuberosum* is very\ncommon. Of the Indian genus *Ledebouria*, two indigenous representatives have been described. *L. maculata*, with spotted leaves and blue flowers, grows in the Konkan and the Deccan, and *L. hyacinthina*, also with blue flowers, in the South Konkan. The African genus *Uropetalum* gives us at least two small species, the one found in the Deccan and the other in the Konkan. *Urginea Indica*, a member of a south European and Mediterranean genus, is very abundant along the coast, particularly to the north of Bombay. Its dried bulbs are now substituted at the Medical Stores for the Squills of the Pharmacopeia, which are yielded by *U. maritima*, a native of South Europe and Malta. *Methonica superba* is a common and well-known climbing plant of the Konkan jungles. Its gorgeous red and orange flowers render it a conspicuous object during the rainy season; the tuberous root is a most virulent poison. In Bombay we find several naturalised species belonging to this order. Amongst them are numerous representatives of the large genus *Dracaena*, natives chiefly of the Archipelago and Polynesia. They are all well-known ornamental shrubs. *Yucca gloriosa* or \"Adam's needle,\" a Mexican species; *Polianthes tuberosa*, the Tuberose, indigenous to India; and *Sansviera Zeylanica*, from Malabar and Ceylon, are all common in gardens. A second member of the latter genus from Singapore was introduced a few years ago and has now become thoroughly established. Both plants yield a strong and valuable fibre. The yellow-flowered *Aloe striatula*, from which the excellent variety of medicinal Aloes, called Jafarabad Aloes, is obtained, is common in Bombay and its neighbourhood. It is cultivated in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, where the drug is prepared, and although noted here amongst the naturalised plants of the order, there is good reason for believing it to be truly indigenous to Western India. *A. Socotrina*, which yields the famed Socotrine Aloes, and is a native of Socotra and the adjoining mainland, is frequently seen about Poona. Except, however, in its having red flowers, it does not appear to differ materially from the first-named plant. They are possibly varieties of one species. *Allium sativum*, the Garlic, and *A. cepa*, the Onion, both belonging to this order, are much cultivated in Western India.\n\n**Pontederaceae** is a small but widely diffused aquatic order, nearly allied to the preceding. Two species, *Monochoria vaginatis* and *Pontederia hastata*, inhabit tanks in most parts of the Presidency. The first spreads to China and the Archipelago. Both are handsome plants with showy blue flowers.\n\nOf the small cosmopolitan tropical family, **Xyridaceae**, we have one indigenous representative\u2014*Xyris Indica*\u2014a little plant with yellow flowers, found in salt marshes along the coast. The genus is as widely distributed as the order.\n\n**Commelynaceae**.\u2014The members of this order are chiefly natives of India, Africa, and Australia. Between twenty and twenty-five species are found here, springing up everywhere during the rainy season. They often resemble in appearance a broad-leaved grass, for which they might easily be mistaken by a careless observer. Most of the Bombay plants of this family are distinguished by their delicate blue flowers, which are not unlike those of the British Forget-me-not. *Commelyna Bengalensis* and *C. communis* are common everywhere; the first occurs also in Africa and the latter in Australia. Ten or twelve species of the widely diffused genus *Aneilema* are found in the Konkan. *A. ochraceum* and *A. versicolor* differ from the others in having yellow instead of blue flowers. *A. giganteum* spreads to Australia. Seven or eight indigenous species of the Asiatic and African genus *Cyanotis* are described. *C. vivipara* grows on the\ntrees of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts. *C. fasciculata*, which abounds in rocky places in the Deccan, has rose-coloured flowers. It is also an African species. *C. tuberosa* is abundant, too, in parts of the Deccan. *C. cristata* is the commonest species in the vicinity of Bombay. *C. axillaris*, which extends to Australia, is most plentiful in cultivated land throughout the Deccan. During the late season of scarcity its seeds were largely used as food by the poorer classes. *Floscopa paniculata*, which is exceedingly like a grass in appearance, grows on the Gh\u00e2ts. It is a cosmopolitan tropical plant. Our only foreign species of this order are the American *Tradescantia discolor* and *T. zebrina*. They have green and purple leaves and white flowers, and are both very common in gardens.\n\n**Palms.**\u2014This great and splendid tropical family is second to none in its importance to man. They have been often said to rank next in utility to Gramineae. The number of our indigenous Palms will appear very small indeed when the frequency of the order in other parts of India is remembered. This paucity of Palms is a noticeable feature in the Botany of the Bombay Presidency, and what renders the fact more remarkable is, that when the southern limits of the Presidency are passed, the number of species appears suddenly to increase. They are far more abundant in Ceylon and in the South and East of India than they are here. Not more than five species can be considered indigenous. The first of these is *Calamus Rotang*, the Cane or Rattan, a climbing palm with thorny stem and leaves; it is common in the dense jungles of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts and K\u00e2nara. *C. tenius*, a Ceylon and Assam cane, occurs in a few of our gardens. This genus is abundant in tropical Asia, extending also into Africa, the Archipelago, and Australia. *Caryota urens*, the \u201cMh\u00e1d\u201d Palm, a member of a small Asiatic and Australian genus, abounds in the Goa and K\u00e2nara jungles, but occurs somewhat less frequently in other parts of the Gh\u00e2t and Konkan valleys. North of Bombay it does not seem to exist in the wild state. *C. sobolifera*, from the Indian Archipelago, was introduced a few years ago and is now pretty frequent in Bombay gardens. *Borassus flabelliformis*, the well-known Palmyra, is chiefly abundant in the Konkan between Bombay and Buls\u00e1r. It also occurs in the forest districts east of Baroda, and in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t, and occasionally in the Deccan. *Phoenix sylvestris*, the familiar wild Date or Teddy Palm, grows in all parts of the Presidency, generally planted however. It is very common in moist ground and near river banks in the Deccan; and in the Konkan it is extensively cultivated for toddy. *P. acaulis*, which is not unlike a stemless or stunted variety of the preceding, is common on the Gh\u00e2ts. A few specimens of *P. dactylifera*, the Date Palm, exist in Bombay. The climate here is too moist, however, to permit of the tree being successfully cultivated. Amongst our non-indigenous species the chief are *Areca catechu*, the Betel or \u201cSup\u00e2ri\u201d Palm, and *Cocos nucifera*, the Cocoa-nut. Both these are largely cultivated throughout the tropics, especially near the sea. In Western India immense mixed plantations are to be seen in sandy soil all along the coast, from S\u00e1lsette to K\u00e2nara. Inland, too, they are often found planted near tanks and temples. The original home of these Palms has never yet been satisfactorily determined. Several other exotic Palms, some of them of long standing in Bombay, may be mentioned. *Kentia Wendlandiana* and *Ptychosperma elegans* are two beautiful Australian Palms, lately introduced. *Oreodoxa regia*, from Brazil, is a noble Palm, of which a few well-grown specimens may be seen in the Victoria Gardens. *Pinanga Kuhlii* and *Daemonorops palombanica* from the Indian Archipelago, are also recent acquisitions. *Hyphaene Thebaica*, the curious branching Doum Palm of Egypt, grows in the old Siwri gardens and on Malab\u00e1r Hill. The soft inner coating of the fruit tastes exactly like gingerbread: hence the English name of the\ntree, Gingerbread Palm. Of *Corypha umbraculifera*, the celebrated Talipot, a native of Ceylon and Southern India, two fine specimens stand in the compound of Grant College. *Rhapis filabelliformis* is a small Chinese Palm which has long been an inhabitant of Bombay gardens. Four species of *Livistona*, three of them from the Archipelago, and one, *L. Australis*, from Queensland, were introduced a few years ago and, so far, have grown luxuriantly. The most valuable, however, of all our recent introductions is *Elaeis Guineensis*, the Palm-oil tree of Western Africa. To judge from its manner of growth, it will evidently succeed well in this climate.\n\n**Pandaneae.\u2014**Only two species of this, the Screw-Pine order, are indigenous to Western India. *Pandanus odoratissimus*, a native also of Australia and the Archipelago, is a very common bush throughout the Konkan, particularly near the sea. Its long prickly leaves and straight roots springing from the stem and branches, render it a curious and interesting natural object. The male flowers are highly fragrant and may be smelt from a distance of several yards. *P. furcatus* is much like the preceding, except that its leaves are somewhat broader and of a brighter green. It is found in great abundance in wet ground in S\u00e1vantv\u00e1di and K\u00e1nara, where it appears to replace the first almost completely. *P. javanicus* and *P. labyrinthicus*, natives of the Archipelago, are now pretty common in Bombay gardens. A very considerable proportion of this genus is indigenous to Mauritius. *Carludovica palmata*, a tropical American species of the order, and an extremely handsome palm-like plant, has been lately introduced and is rapidly multiplying. The celebrated and costly Panama hats are made from its leaves.\n\n**Aroideae.\u2014**This family abounds in the moister parts of the tropics, especially of South America, and a few species occur in temperate regions. In Western India we have from sixteen to twenty indigenous representatives, some of which are, however, but imperfectly known. With one or two exceptions all are confined to the Konkan and Gh\u00e1ts and to K\u00e1nara. Of the widely dispersed genus *Ariseema* we possess at least three species. *A. Murryi* is the well-known Snake-lily, so abundant at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. *Amorphophallus campanulatus*, a plant with an immense tuberous root, which is eaten, and a great spreading branched leaf, is largely cultivated in Western India. It occurs wild in parts of the Konkan. *A. sylvaticus*, a much smaller plant, is exceedingly abundant in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e1ts during the rains. *Typhonium bulbiferum* occurs in the South Konkan and *T. divaricatum*, which has a deep crimson spathe, is common near Bombay. The genus is widely spread through the Old World tropics. In the rainy season *Tapinocarpus Indicus* and *Ariopsis peltata* are frequent in the Konkan. *Rewaustia vivipara* grows in holes in the trunks of trees and rocks along the higher Gh\u00e1ts. *Cryptocoryne Roxburghii*, a pretty common species, and *Lagenandra toxicaria*, are found in marshy places. The latter occurs in the South Konkan and in parts of the Deccan, and is said to be a highly poisonous plant. *Colocasia antiquorum*, commonly cultivated in Bombay as a vegetable, is a doubtful native. It is indigenous on the other side of India and is often seen here, apparently wild, in marshy ground. It may, however, have escaped from cultivation. *Pothos scandens* and *Scindapsus pertusus*, curious plants, climbing and rooting on trees, are common in the Gh\u00e1t and Konkan jungles. The first-mentioned genus spreads to Africa and Australia. The latter plant has a thick fleshy stem, and broad leaves pierced with large holes. *Pistia stratiotes* is an odd little floating aquatic plant of this order, plentiful in tanks everywhere. It may be easily recognised by its stiff fan-like leaves. The species is very widely spread through the tropics.\nAmongst the introduced representatives of Aroideae, the following are found in Bombay:\u2014Caladium, of which so many varieties are cultivated in our gardens as ornamental plants, is a South American genus. A few species, however, occur in other parts of the tropics. At least one hundred varieties are known here. Several exotic species of Alocasia also have of late years become very common and are highly ornamental plants. Acorus calamus, the Sweet Flag, a native of Great Britain, may be occasionally seen. Dieffenbachia seguine, the Dumb-cane of the West Indies, and one of the most poisonous of plants, has long been an inhabitant of Bombay and Poona gardens. Several other members of the same genus, together with species of Philodendron and anthurium, all South American plants, have been recently introduced.\n\nOf the very small but cosmopolitan aquatic order Typhaceae, we possess one indigenous representative. Typha elephantina is a tall Bulrush which is abundant in tanks and streams in most parts of the Presidency. T. angustifolia, the lesser Bulrush of Great Britain, a most widely diffused species, has not yet been detected in Western India, but as it is indigenous in many other parts of the country, it is highly probable it exists here also.\n\nLemnaceae, another small aquatic order, gives us two species. Lemna trisulca, the Duckweed, a minute floating plant, is as common in stagnant water here as it is in Europe. It occurs in nearly every climate. L. globosa, a still smaller plant, often forms a considerable part of the green scum on the surface of tanks. Other species of the genus are as widely dispersed.\n\nNaiad\u00e6, also an aquatic family, is chiefly interesting on account of the very extensive distribution of some of its species. Four or five members of the cosmopolitan genus Potamogeton are found in tanks and streams in all parts of the Presidency. Of these, P. natans, the Pondweed, P. perfoliatus, P. crispus, and P. pectinatus are indigenous also to Great Britain; the first and two last to America, and all to Australia. The common Grasswrack, Zostera marina, occurs in salt marshes along the coast, and is found in similar situations and in tidal estuaries in most parts of the world. Naias Indica, belonging to another ubiquitous genus, is common in tanks.\n\nAlismace\u00e6 resembles the three preceding orders in being aquatic and in the extensive distribution of some of its species. Four or five are found in Western India. Two at least of Sagittaria, a genus spread throughout the northern hemisphere, are pretty common in the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t tanks. Butomopsis lanceolata, the single species to which the genus is limited, occurs also in Gujar\u00e1t. It extends over tropical Asia, Africa, and Australia. Aponogeton monostachyus, which is quite as widely dispersed as the last, is found in standing waters in the Deccan.\n\nEriocaulone consists of the single genus Eriocaulon, nearly all the species of which are aquatic and are distributed to the tropics of the Old World and Australia. They are generally grass-like plants. Ten or twelve species are indigenous to Western India and are most commonly found in marshes, tanks, and rivers in the Konkan. E. sexangulare extends to Africa and E. quinquangulare to Australia.\n\nCyperace\u00e6.\u2014This, the Sedge order, contains upwards of two thousand species, diffused over the whole world, especially in the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. In marshy plains, on the banks of rivers and lakes, and on the slopes of high mountains they often take the place of grasses, covering a large extent of surface. In this Presidency, although there are comparatively but few species, yet individuals abound, not only in wet localities everywhere but in the drier Deccan pastures and along the summits of the higher Gh\u00e2ts. Between forty and fifty species of\nthe order occur in Western India, nearly one-half of which belong to the great tropical and sub-tropical genus *Cyperus*. These latter are very common in almost every part of the Presidency. *C. polystachyus*, *C. squarrosus*, *C. difformis*, *C. Haspan*, *C. distans*, *C. compressus* and *C. rotundus* are cosmopolitan, being found not only here and in other parts of India and Asia, but in Australia, Africa, and America. The bulbous roots of the last are bitter and aromatic, and are used as medicine and as a perfume. Amongst our other indigenous representatives of the genus, *C. pumilus*, *C. globosus*, *C. alopecuroides*, *C. tuberosus*, *C. iria* and *C. umbellatus* are widely spread through the intertropical countries of the Old World. *Kyllinga monocephala* and *Heleocharis capitata* are also cosmopolitan in the tropics. *Fimbristylis*, another genus of warm climates, gives us five or six indigenous species, and of these *F. monostachya*, *F. ferruginea*, and *F. quinquangularis* are found throughout the tropics of both Old and New Worlds and in Australia. The last is our commonest species. *F. milacea* has nearly as wide a range. Seven or eight species of *Scirpus* are indigenous to Western India, occurring chiefly in and about tanks. *S. squarrosus* and *S. articulatus* are also Australian and African plants, but *S. maritimus* spreads over most parts of the world, including Great Britain. Few genera have so extensive a range as this, its members being found not only in every tropical and temperate country, but also in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Of the cosmopolitan genera *Lipocarpha*, *Fuireno*, *Rhynchospora* and *Scleria* we possess one species each. *Carex Indica*, the solitary representative in the Bombay flora of a genus numbering upwards of one thousand species, grows at Mah\u00e1baleshwar. This great genus is distributed to cold and temperate regions and to mountainous districts within the tropics.\n\n**Gramineae**\u2014The Grass order comprises nearly 4,500 species, abundantly diffused over all parts of the globe, in every variety of station, and ranging in size from small herbaceous plants a few inches in height to tall Bamboos, which in some cases attain a growth of nearly one hundred feet. The important nutritious principles contained in the stems and leaves, and more especially in the seeds of this immense family, entitle it, in an economic and political point of view, to take by far the highest rank amongst the various classes of plants useful to man. This conclusion will appear sufficiently obvious when it is remembered that three great staples of life\u2014wheat, rice, and sugar\u2014are among its products; to say nothing of the countless myriads of lower animals to which this order affords the means of existence, and through these again to mankind.\n\nThe major portion of *Gramineae* inhabit the temperate zone, but the tribes, or divisions, *Panicaceae*, *Andropogoneae*, *Chlorideae*, and *Bambusaceae* are especially tropical, and to these fully seventy-five per cent. of our known indigenous species belong. As far as the flora of Western India is concerned, this natural order has never yet been completely investigated: up to the present hardly more than ninety species have been enumerated, and judging from the fact that several additions to the catalogue have recently been obtained in the vicinity of Bombay itself, it is scarcely too much to assume that careful research in the less explored districts of this Presidency will yield many more. As regards number of species, *Gramineae* stand second on our list of indigenous orders of flowering plants. *Leguminosae* being the first, but with respect to individuals the grasses are probably more numerous than all these other orders put together. As with *Cyperaceae* a great many tropical grasses are cosmopolitan in their distribution: some of the commonest Bombay species range round the world. A few of our grasses are, in Western India, confined to the higher Gh\u00e1ts, others to the Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t, but the majority are diffused over the whole Presidency. It will of course be understood that the greater number make their appearance during the rainy season only.\nThe first species to be mentioned is the well-known and widely spread *Coix lacryma*, the large hard stony fruits of which are called \"Job's Tears.\" It is a tall coarse grass very abundant in marshy ground in the Konkan. *Paspalum scrobiculatum*, also an African and Australian species, is the cultivated \"Kudru,\" a grain often used by the poorest classes of the Konkan. Under certain circumstances, not yet fully understood, this grain produces symptoms of narcotic poisoning in persons who eat it, such a result being not improbably due to the development of a fungus. *Eriochloa punctata*, belonging to a small but widely diffused tropical genus, occurs about Bombay. Of the immense genus, *Panicum*, fifteen or sixteen species are described as indigenous to this part of India, while others are cultivated. Amongst the former *P. stagninum*, *P. cimicifugum*, *P. floridum*, *P. helopus*, *P. colonum*, *P. Burmanni*, *P. crus-galli*, and *P. myurus* are the commonest. The four last, together with *P. prostratum* and *P. sanguinale* are also found in Australia and tropical Africa, and at least four of those enumerated occur in America. *P. Nepalense* is a Gh\u00e1t grass. The principal cereals of this genus which are cultivated in Western India are *P. frumentaceum*, *P. miliaceum*, *P. Italicum* and *P. pilosum*. The celebrated Guinea-grass is *P. maximum*, a native of Western Africa. It is now largely grown, for Commissariat use, in the northern parts of the Presidency. *Setaria glauca* and *S. verticillata*, both cosmopolitan plants, are pretty common. *Pennisetum aureum* is frequent in the Deccan and two species of *Cenchrus* in Gujar\u00e1t. Of *Lappago*, *Perotis*, *Manisurus*, *Ophiurus*, *Oropetium*, *Rottboellia*, and *Chionachne* we possess one representative each. *Manisurus granularis*, which is plentiful everywhere, and *Ophiurus corymbosus*, a tall coarse Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t species, range round the world in the tropics. *Chionachne barbata* extends to Australia. *Ischaemum*, which is chiefly an Asiatic genus, furnishes at least four indigenous species; all of these are abundant in the Konkan, and a considerable proportion of the green monsoon fodder used in Bombay consists of *I. conjugatum*. *I. pilosum* abounds all over the Presidency. *Saccharum spontaneum*, usually a gigantic grass, but variable in size, grows in many parts of Western India. In the D\u00e0ng, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Gujar\u00e1t forests, where it forms the principal mass of undergrowth, it often attains a height of seven or eight feet; on the banks of the Deccan rivers it reaches six feet, but in other situations, in dry or poor soil, it is scarcely more than two feet in height. The huts of the wandering Brinj\u00e1ris are formed of the stems of this grass. *S. officinale*, the Sugarcane, is much cultivated in Gujar\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and the Deccan. The great tropical genus *Andropogon* is represented in the Bombay flora by fifteen or sixteen species. *A. iwananusa*, *A. muricatus*, and *A. Sch\u0153nanthus* are aromatic. The first is probably the source of one kind of False Spikenard; the fragrant roots of the second are the familiar \"Khuskhus;\" and from the third, which is a widely-spread plant of the Old World tropics and Australia, and which abounds in Eastern Gujar\u00e1t, the well-known \"Rusa\" oil is distilled. *A. contortus*, a very common grass here, is found in all parts of the tropics. *A. aristatus*, *A. acicularis*, and *A. verticillatus* extend to Mauritius, and the second also to Australia, *A. scandens* and *A. glaber* are common Deccan fodder grasses. *A. citratus*, a garden species in Bombay and probably a native of Ceylon, is the sweet-smelling Lemon-grass. Another highly aromatic member of this genus, and whose specific name is as yet undetermined, grows on the walls of tanks and wells in the neighbourhood of Bombay, and is reported to be cultivated in Kh\u00e1ndesh along with the \"Rusa.\" *Anthisteria cymbaria* is a large coarse plant, abundant everywhere. *A. ciliata*, smaller and still more abundant, is one of our best fodder grasses: the greater part of the hay used here is composed of it. The latter species is indigenous also to tropical Africa and America, and is the celebrated Kangaroo grass of\nAustralia. *Pelostachys filiformis* is a small plant of the higher Gh\u00e2ts. *Aptluda aristata* is plentiful everywhere in hedges and under trees; it has frequently a length of seven or eight feet. Four species of *Arundinella*, a widely diffused tropical genus, are common on the Gh\u00e2ts. *Aristida setacea*, *A. hystric*, and *A. depressa* are the well-known and troublesome spear-grasses, so common in the Deccan. The last mentioned extends to Australia and Africa. The most abundant grass in the Presidency is probably *Cynodon dactylon*, the \"Hariala.\" It is found in nearly all hot, and in some temperate, countries, and in the south of England it appears also to have established itself. In stony ground and on roadsides in the Deccan *Melanocenchrus Rothiana* abounds. The cosmopolitan *Chloris barbata* is plentiful everywhere, and a second indigenous species is said by Dalzell to be found only on the old city walls at Surat. *Eleusine Aegyptiaca*, a small stiff creeping grass, is common about roadsides and on dry banks and rubbish heaps. Like so many others, it is diffused through all parts of the tropics. A second species, which is probably *E. indica*, occurs in similar localities and has an equally extensive distribution. *E. coracana* is the cultivated \"N\u00e2gli.\" *Leptochloa calycina* is an elegant grass frequent in the Konkan, and *L. chinensis* is also occasionally seen. Of the widely diffused tropical genus *Sporobolus* we have three indigenous species, and of *Isachne, Uniola, Phragmites, Elytrophorus*, and *Koeleria* one each. *Sporobolus diander* and *Elytrophorus articulatus* spread to Australia. *Phragmites Roxburghii* is a great reed often growing, in favourable situations, to a height of fifteen or sixteen feet. There seems to be some doubt, however, whether it is truly indigenous on this side of India. *Koeleria lagopodioides* is a small grass common in salt or sandy soil. The local flora contains eight or ten species of the large tropical genus *Eragrostis*. The most abundant of these are *E. nutans*, *E. tenella*, and *E. viscosa*. The second, with *E. pilosa*, extends to Australia. The flowers of the last are covered with a disagreeably smelling viscid substance. *Poa flexuosa* is, so far, our only known representative of a large genus\u2014one of the most widely distributed of the order. Of Bamboos we have at least five or six indigenous kinds, one or two of which do not as yet appear to have been fully described. *Bambusa arundinacea* is the commonest species in Western India and grows in all the moist forest districts from K\u00e2thi\u00e2war and the S\u00e2tput\u00e2s to K\u00e2nara. In the latter province and in Goa and the southern parts of Dh\u00e2rw\u00e2r it is exceedingly abundant, forming impenetrable jungles. When well grown and standing apart there is no more graceful plant in the whole vegetable kingdom. *B. vulgaris* has a yellow stem and denser foliage than the first. It is cultivated in some parts of the Deccan, but would seem to exist wild only towards the extreme south. *B. arundo* is a Gh\u00e2t species and is frequent at Mah\u00e2baleshwar. *Dedrocalamus strictus*, our only indigenous species, is the variety of Bamboo from which the handles of boar-spears are made. The numberless important uses to which Bamboos of all kinds are put in this country, are too well known to need further mention here.\n\nBesides the cultivated species of the order which have been already noted, there are several others largely grown in Western India, and so familiar to every one as to require only to be enumerated. Amongst these are *Sorghum vulgare* and its varieties, *Jow\u00e2ri*, and \"Imphee\" or Chinese Sugarcane; *Oryza sativa*, the Rice; *Zea Mays*, the Indian Corn, a native of America; *Penicillaria spicata*, the B\u00e2iri; *Triticum aestivum*, Wheat; and *Hordeum hexastichon*, the six-rowed Barley. Attempts are often made to grow English fodder grasses in this part of India, but, as might naturally be expected, such grasses are quickly supplanted and killed by the indigenous species.\n\nThe description of the flowering plants of Western India terminating with this order, I shall next proceed to give a brief account\nof our indigenous Cryptogamia, or flowerless plants. It may be mentioned, however, that the species belonging to this class which are included in the Bombay flora have never as yet been fully described or investigated, and there are doubtless multitudes of new species still to be discovered. Under such circumstances, therefore, the account which I shall offer here of the Bombay Cryptogamia will of necessity be exceedingly imperfect.\n\nFilices, or Ferns, are, in Western India, almost entirely confined to the moister Gh\u00e1t districts, and the greater the elevation the more abundant do both species and individuals become. About fifty species are at present known to occur within the limits of this Presidency. None of them would appear to be peculiarly restricted in their distribution; they are all more or less dispersed over various parts of India, and in some few instances are widely diffused throughout the Old World. Along the banks of rivers and in marshy places near the coast towards the south, Acrostichum aureum exists in great quantities. Stenochlaena scandens is a fern which climbs to the tops of the highest trees in K\u00e1nara. Pteridopteris terminans grows in the jungles along the lower part of the Gh\u00e1ts. Blechnum orientale, a large and handsome fern, is found in the South Konkan and in K\u00e1nara. Gymnopteris Feei is common on trees at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Adiantum lunulatum, a small slender fern, of most elegant appearance, abounds throughout the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e1ts. A. caudatum, much less common, occurs on the higher Gh\u00e1ts. A. Capillus-veneris, the well-known Maiden-Hair, grows under sheltered banks, near water-courses, in the Deccan, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Gujar\u00e1t. Cheilanthes farinosa, known here as the Silver Fern, abounds everywhere along the Gh\u00e1ts. It is widely distributed through the tropics. C. tenuifolia occurs in dry localities in the Deccan. Pteris aquilina, the Braken, a familiar British fern, is very abundant at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. P. longifolia and P. pellucida are also found there. P. quadriaurita is very common in most of the shady Gh\u00e1t jungles, and a beautiful green and white variety may be seen in Bombay gardens. Actiniopteris radiata, in appearance like a miniature palm, grows on rocks and old walls in the Deccan. Asplenium planicaule and A. trapeziforme occur at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Athyrium falcatum and A. filix-femina are found in the same locality. The latter is better known as the Lady fern. Allantodea Brunoneana grows in moist places along the Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. Callipteris esculenta is one of the commonest large ferns of the higher Gh\u00e1ts, and also of Bombay gardens. Hemionitis cordata, a delicate little species, occurs on the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and in K\u00e1nara. Gymnogramma leptophylla, another small and delicate fern, is found at Mah\u00e1baleshvar and in parts of the Deccan. Goniopteris prolifera is a climbing fern of the Konkan. Niphobolus adnascens, Pleopeltis Wightiana, and P. membranacea abound on the trees of the Gh\u00e1t and Konkan jungles. P. phymatodes occurs more to the south. Drynaria quercifolia, the Oak fern, grows on trees in most parts of the Konkan. Aspidium polymorphum is found at Mah\u00e1baleshvar and along the higher Gh\u00e1ts. Sagenia coadunata, known also as the Oak fern, abounds in all the shady Gh\u00e1t jungles. Nephrodium molle is plentiful at Mah\u00e1baleshvar and on the eastern slopes of the Gh\u00e1ts. Three species of Lastrea\u2014L. cochleata, L. eriocarpa, and L. sparsa\u2014occur in the same situations. Nephrolepis tuberosa is found in K\u00e1nara, and this species, together with N. exaltata, from Southern India, and N. Davallioideae, a native of Malacca and Singapore, are common garden ferns of Bombay. Acrophorus pulchra and A. immeritus, both small, delicate, and rather rare ferns, grow in the shadiest Gh\u00e1t jungles, as does also Davallia tenuifolia, which much resembles them. Peranema cyatheoides is a beautiful but somewhat scarce Mah\u00e1baleshvar fern, found in moist shady locali-\nties. *Gleichenia dichotoma*, cosmopolitan in the tropics, is a creeping fern occurring in the Konkan and on the Gh\u00e2ts towards the south, also in K\u00e2nara. *Lygodium scandens* and *L. flexuosum* are elegant climbing ferns of the South Konkan and Gh\u00e2t jungles. *Osmunda regalis*, the Royal Fern, also a British species, grows in the water-courses at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. It is cosmopolitan in temperate regions. *Angiopteris evecta*, another widely diffused species, is a large and handsome fern with a stem from three to four feet in height, and broad spreading fronds from twelve to fifteen feet in length; it occurs in the jungles of the Southern Konkan and K\u00e2nara. *Botrychium virginicum*, a kind of Moonwort, together with *Ophioglossum reticulatum* and *O. pendulum*, Adders-tongue ferns, are found sparingly in grassy places on the Gh\u00e2ts. *Helminthostachys Zeylanica*, a curious looking species, grows in the South Konkan. Besides the indigenous ferns mentioned above, numerous exotic species of this order have of late years been introduced into Bombay, where they may frequently be seen in gardens.\n\nOf *Marsileaceae*, an aquatic cryptogamous order, a few species are found in the Konkan. *Marsilea quadrifolia* is very common on the margins of tanks in the neighbourhood of Bombay and in Gujar\u00e1t. It is also indigenous to Europe, as well as to Australia and other parts of the world. *Salviniae* is another small aquatic family, of which we possess one species, the widely spread *Salvinia natans*, a minute floating plant of tanks and marshy places. *Lycopodiaceae*, the Club Moss order, has at least seven or eight representatives in this part of the world. They grow chiefly in the moist shady jungles of the Gh\u00e2ts and Konkan. *Lycopodium Phlegmaria*, a widely diffused species, is parasitic on Gh\u00e2t trees. *L. cernuum*, *L. circinale*, and *L. volubile*, with some two or three other undetermined members of the order, occur in the Konkan. A few exotic species of *Lycopodium* and *Selaginella* are ornamental plants of Bombay gardens. *Isoetes Cordemelina*, belonging to the little order *Isoetaceae*, is a grass-like plant occurring in tanks and marshes. Our indigenous species of the cryptogamic orders *Characeae*, *Musci*, *Lichenes*, *Fungi*, and *Algae* are so very imperfectly known, that it is impossible, and indeed unnecessary here to do more than mention a few of the commonest. When the abundance in temperate or cold climates of the last four orders is borne in mind, the comparatively scanty members by which such large families are represented in Western India can hardly fail to strike an observer. This is true as regards species of any size, but the microscopic species of some of these orders are probably abundant enough. A species of *Nitella*, belonging to the first mentioned order, grows in green hair-like masses in ditches during the monsoon. A few of the *Musci*, or Mosses, are found on old walls about Bombay, and in other parts of the Konkan, in the rainy season; their numbers are, however, increased by the greater elevation and diminished temperature of the higher Gh\u00e2ts. At Mah\u00e1baleshvar, for instance, although there are still but few species to be noticed, yet for this the abundance of individuals, which clothe every tree and rock, will serve to compensate. The commonest *Lichens* on the higher Gh\u00e2ts are the cosmopolitan *Usnea barbata* and its variety *U. florida*. These are well known to Europeans as the White Tree-moss. A few other species of the order occur on the trunks of trees and on rocks in various parts of the Presidency, notably on the Palmyra palm. In large *Fungi* the Bombay flora would appear to be very deficient. Two or three species of *Agaricus* are common on rubbish heaps during the rains. One of these closely resembles the Mushroom in many respects, and, like it, is edible. Several kinds of *Polyporus* grow on decayed trees and damp wood work; while a species of *Thelephora*, which is very similar to, if not identical with, the British *T. anthocephala*, is common on rotten stumps. A kind of *Phallus*, more delicate in appearance but still closely resembling the British species *P.*\nimpudious, and possessing quite as fetid an odour, is sometimes seen about Bombay in the rainy season. One of the Puff-balls\u2014*Lycoperdon*\u2014is pretty common at the same time of year. A species of *Reticularia*, a soft gelatinous fungus, occurs on the bottoms of flower tubs and on decayed and damp timber. On dead branches of trees one of the cup-shaped *Pezizas* is found. Besides the above, a few additional species of this order, which have hitherto remained undescribed, may occasionally be seen. Microscopic Fungi, or moulds, are, as most people know, sufficiently abundant in Bombay during the wet season. The microscopic fresh water Algae exist in great quantities in all the stagnant waters of the Presidency, and in damp situations. The green colour assumed by walls, after continuous rain, is due to the development of these minute plants; and so is the green scum which frequently covers the surface of Vehar Lake. The almost entire absence of large Seaweeds or marine Algae in the neighbourhood of the Western coast is remarkable. The few that do occur have as yet been hardly identified, much less studied in detail; neither has there been a more intimate acquaintance formed with the Bombay fresh-water species of this great order.\n\nThe detailed account of the distribution of our indigenous natural orders throughout the Presidency having now been completed, a few general considerations, on the Bombay flora as a whole, will not be out of place; without something of the kind, this paper would be simply a bare statement of facts, while the various interesting and important inferences to be drawn from such facts would thus be left unnoticed.\n\nAn examination of the manner in which the orders of the vegetable kingdom are distributed will show that more than half of them are represented in the flora of Western India. Certain orders are, as might be expected, much more largely developed than others; about an eighth of the Dicotyledons, for example, may be referred to *Leguminosae*, while one-fourth of the Monocotyledons belong to *Gramineae*. Representatives of these two orders, together with species of *Acanthaceae*, *Compositae*, *Euphorbiaceae*, *Rubiaceae*, *Labiatae*, *Convolvulaceae*, *Scrophulariaceae*, *Malvaceae*, *Asclepiadaceae*, *Apocynaceae*, *Urticaceae*, *Amarantaceae*, *Orchidaceae*, and *Cyperaceae* form fully five-eighths of the plants indigenous to the Bombay Presidency. It must, however, be remembered that, although they are greater numerically in indigenous species, the orders just mentioned are not those which are most largely represented in proportion to the total number of species contained in each. The great cosmopolitan order *Compositae* for instance, which possesses upwards of 10,000 species, is represented here by probably something less than 100. *Rubiaceae* might perhaps be cited as a less extreme example; it contains 4,500 species, of which hardly more than 60 exist in our flora. These proportions will appear very small when compared with the number of species belonging to other orders: the little order *Aurantiaceae* is a good case in point; it contains only 100 species, out of which no less than 14 are indigenous to Western India. The orders then which are best developed here, in proportion to their total number of species, are *Convolvulaceae*, *Aurantiaceae*, *Asclepiadaceae*, *Apocynaceae*, *Malvaceae*, *Capparidaceae*, *Ebenaceae*, *Meliaceae*, *Jasmineae*, *Urticaceae*, *Cucurbitaceae*, *Commelynaceae*, and *Zingiberaceae*. It is noticeable, on the other hand, that several large tropical families, and one or two peculiar Indian orders, are almost, or even entirely, absent from\nWestern India. *Myrtaceae*, a tropical order of 1,800 species, is represented here by only eight, and *Melastomaceae*, comprising an equally large number, by five or six. There are twelve or fifteen indigenous species of *Liliaceae*, an order of 1,500 members. *Dipterocarpaceae* and *Dilleniaceae*, both Indian families, are represented by one and two species respectively. *Cycadaceae* are entirely absent. *Palmae* are very deficient, only five species being indigenous. It is not easy to account for the absence of the large orders *Cruciferae* and *Umbelliferae* from the more temperate districts of the Presidency; of the former there is only one indigenous species known, and of the latter, but fifteen or sixteen. Notwithstanding the extent of the Bombay Presidency, its diversified surface, and its variations in climate and soil, it is impossible to characterise its flora as a very rich one; some might perhaps be tempted to call it poor. The whole flora, leaving out of consideration the minute *Cryptogamia*, contains under 2,000 species; and its comparative poverty may be realised when it is asserted that in other parts of India an almost equal number of species may be gathered within a radius of twenty miles, or less. The Deccan and the alluvial parts of Gujar\u00e1t, like most other Indian plains, are exceedingly poor in species, and it is only in the more humid Gh\u00e1t and Konkan districts that any considerable collection can be made. Except under very favourable circumstances, it is unusual to find a large number of different species assembled together within a limited space; it is common, on the other hand, to see, during the rainy season, an enormous number of individuals belonging to one or two annual species congregated within a comparatively small radius. Putting aside *Gramineae* and *Cyperaceae*, both essentially gregarious orders, this is notably the case with the various species of *Impatiens* and with some members of the order *Compositae*. In the Konkan *Smithia sensitiva*, and in the Deccan *Heylandia latibrosa*, *Indigofera linifolia*, *I. glandulosa*, and *Cyanotis fasciculata* are amazingly abundant. As regards shrubs, trees, or perennial herbs, *Leguminosae*, *Myrtaceae*, *Labiatae*, and *Acanthaceae* present remarkable examples of this congregation of individuals. In Kh\u00e1ndesh and Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t extensive tracts of country are covered with *Butea frondosa*. *Eugenia jambolana* exists in great numbers on the higher Gh\u00fats, and in the same localities, in even greater numbers, *Pogostemon purpurivaulis* forms nearly the whole undergrowth. *Newacanthus spherostachyus* sometimes covers entire hillsides, while two or three species of *Strobilanthes* are equally abundant. A large extent of country, too, may often be seen covered with Teak to the exclusion of nearly everything else. Two instances will show that this segregation of individuals in great numbers is not confined to indigenous plants. *Malachra capitata*, an American member of the *Malvaceae*, and *Lagasea mollis*, a Mexican species of the *Compositae*, spring up in perfectly incredible quantities during the rains, the one about Bombay and the other in the vicinity of Poona.\n\nLet us now note a few of the conditions which take part in regulating the distribution of species to each botanical province. In tropical and sub-tropical climates the foremost and most important condition which influences vegetation is the amount of humidity in the air, the distribution of tropical plants being affected to a far\ngreater extent by the moisture of a climate than by its temperature or any other condition. In this part of India the amount of atmospheric moisture is, as a rule, in direct proportion to the nearness of the sea. So sensitive are plants to the degree of humidity, that it is no uncommon thing to find species, genera, or even whole natural orders confined within definite hygroscopic limits, causing, on a large scale, the greatest difference between the vegetation of moist and dry climates, and a corresponding diversity in the aspect of a country. Of this fact numerous instances occur in Western India; some plants, notably the Zingiberaceae and epiphytal Orchidaceae, which require a constantly humid atmosphere, are almost entirely confined to the Konkan, the Gh\u00e1t districts, and K\u00e1nara. One species of the latter order extends as far as the Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t forests. The Anonaceae, Melastomaceae, and Piperaceae, of the Bombay flora, are also limited to the moister localities; other plants are confined to regions of perennial drought, while a third class is dependent on alternations of heat or drought, and moisture. The amount of rainfall has far less influence; a district covered with vegetation may often be noticed where the air is found saturated with moisture; although the precipitation is but scanty when compared with that of other places which possess a growth of inferior luxuriance. The temperature has a much smaller influence than might be supposed on the development of a tropical flora; an equable, though comparatively low temperature, combined with a humid atmosphere, is especially favourable towards the growth of vegetation, and it is this combination of circumstances, occurring however to a less degree here than in the insular climates of other parts of the tropics, which produces the comparatively luxuriant vegetation, or tropical flora, of K\u00e1nara and the Southern Gh\u00e1ts and Konkan. In the strict sense of the expression, however, no district of Western India can be called perennially humid, such a condition as is experienced in Ceylon and in parts of Burma and Eastern Bengal. On the contrary every part of this Presidency presents more or less contrasted seasons of excessive moisture and excessive drought. It is during the warm season of great moisture that the annual species of the Bombay flora make their appearance. Many of these are uniformly dispersed over a great part of the Presidency, seemingly regardless, in their distribution, of any influence but moisture. A second class appear to be affected, in addition, by elevation, some of these being found only in the Konkan and low-lying country, whilst others occur nowhere except in the more elevated districts; all, however, agreeing in the circumstance that their existence is dependent on the annual return of the rainy season. A great degree of heat, with little moisture, characterises the climate of part of Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan, and produces, in some districts at least, what is termed a Desert Flora. In no part of the Presidency are great extremes of heat and cold known; snow is unheard of, and frost, except in the most northern parts, is never seen.\n\nAnother condition which exercises a powerful influence over distribution is elevation. Its effects can be studied to advantage in the Gh\u00e1t flora, where, from below upwards, successive groups of species may be seen to appear and disappear, their places being occupied by others, until, finally, the vegetation at the greatest altitude presents\ntotally different characters to that growing on the plain below, palms and other tropical plants flourishing here, while above may be seen, existing in full luxuriance, *Pteris aquilina* and *Osmunda regalis*, both indigenous ferns of temperate Britain.\n\nDifferences in soil and geological formation affect distribution to some extent. In the black cotton soil of Gujar\u00e1t and parts of the Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh are found plants for which we may search in vain on the red soil of other districts. The flora of the Ratn\u00e1giri Collectorate is richer and more varied than that of any other part of the Presidency, and this fact is doubtless to be attributed to the diverse character of its soils. The degree of exposure has also a certain influence on distribution. Numerous species occur only in the deep shade of the forest or in the dark ravines and valleys of the Gh\u00e2ts; others are found nowhere except in the bleakest and most exposed situations.\n\nThe consideration in greater detail of the special botanical features of each province, the variation and development of species as affected by climate and geographical position, as well as the geographical alliances and affinities of the Bombay flora with those of other countries would appear to demand, in a paper like this, a fuller notice than they have received: but the materials for a useful discussion on these points are still so imperfect, and the amount of research and labour needed for the collection of suitable material is so great, while at the same time the necessary opportunities are non-existent, that I am compelled to forego such observations as I had originally proposed to offer on this part of the general subject. The article may now be regarded as complete so far as it is in my power to render it so.\n\nW.

Mango, Mangifera indice, \u00e1mbo. The mango, cultivated in all parts of the province both for its shade and for its fruit, is found near villages and in gardens.\n\nThe tree yields a gum and its bark is considered a valuable dressing for boils, and is used with that of the babul and rohan for dyeing cloth to a reddish brown. The leaves wrapped round tobacco are used as cigarettes. Its light-coloured timber not being durable is used only for the planking of ceilings, door panels, and for cheap packing cases. In its unripe state, when it is called marva, great quantity of mangoes are pickled. The ripe fruit, ker\u00ed, is much eaten by all classes both at private dinners and at caste feasts. In larger towns, assemblies of as many as a thousand people sometimes meet together to feast on mangoes. On this occasion the fruit is first pressed by the hand, and the juice strained though a cloth is mixed with clarified butter, ghi, and distributed to the guests.\n\n---\n\n1 Compiled from materials supplied by Mr. G. H. D. Wilson, C.S., and Lieutenant-Colonel J. G. McRae.\nfavourite form of caste dinner consists of mango juice, with wheaten cakes and vegetables of different sorts.\n\nNo. 2. Bassia latifolia, mahudo. The mahudo, which is one of the most useful of forest trees, is only found in the eastern Gujar\u00e1t. The flowers of this tree form a principal article of food for the rude tribes residing in the Gujar\u00e1t forests, especially those of Rewa K\u00e1ntha, and a scarcity of the mahuda crop is as severely felt by them as a failure of the grain crop in the more highly cultivated parts of the province.\n\nBesides forming an article of diet the flower of the mahuda is used in the manufacture of spirits, and for this purpose large quantities are yearly exported from Gujar\u00e1t, chiefly to Bombay and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. When set apart for the manufacture of spirits the flowers are first allowed to dry and then soaked in water in the proportion of forty pounds of the flower to fifty pounds of the water. Here they ferment, and are generally left in this state for eight or nine days. While the dried flowers are fermenting the still is being made ready. This apparatus consists of four parts. First, there is a copper boiler with a somewhat narrow mouth; second, a shallow bowl-shaped copper vessel laid on the mouth of the boiler; third, a funnel-mouthed pipe, its broad end within the boiler, and as it narrows passing out through an opening in the boiler's side and stretching for some inches beyond; and fourth, a separate copper vessel or receiver. When eight or nine days have passed, and fermentation has ceased, the liquid is poured into the boiler, the hollow rounded lid laid in its place and filled with cold water, the broad end of the tube placed below the centre of the bottom of the lid, the opening in the side of the boiler made carefully air-tight, and the receiving vessel set below the outer end of the tube. Fuel is now collected below the boiler and set alight, and as the liquid grows warmer steam rises, and, condensing on the cold surface of the lid, falls in drops into the broad mouth of the tube, and passing outwards through the pipe, flows from its outer end into the receiving vessel. The contents of the receiving vessel produced by this single distillation are weak, used only by the poorer classes. The mahuda spirit ordinarily drunk is made from this once distilled liquid mixed with an equal quantity of fermented mahuda and again distilled. For the best varieties of spirit the mahuda is twice distilled. To give these stronger drinks an agreeable flavour, dried rose leaves and raisins are sometimes mixed with the mahuda, and to impart a red colour chips of the pattang, C\u00e6salpinia sappan, tree are also sometimes thrown in.\n\nThe berry of mahuda is not much eaten. But from the seeds a useful oil known as doliyu is prepared. Among other uses this doliyu oil is employed at the town of Kapadvanj in the Kaira district in the manufacture of soap. In preparing this soap the oil is placed in a large vessel, and over it water mixed with carbonate of soda, called us, is poured. The vessel is then heated, and for the space of eight or nine hours the mixture of oil, water, and carbonate of soda is constantly stirred by a long wooden ladle. A tap in the lower part of the vessel is then opened and the water allowed to drain off. Fresh carbonate of soda is then poured in\nand the process repeated. This goes on for three days, the furnace being kept burning all the time. At the end of the third day the oil becomes incorporated with the carbonate of soda and assumes a thick consistency. The vessel is then taken off the fire and the thick substance poured into masonry tanks and there mixed with a salt earth called kh\u00e1ro. Afterwards it is taken out and made into cakes, which when dried in the sun are ready for sale.\n\nThe timber, which is of a light colour, is used for building purposes. It is not, however, of any very great value, as, besides being neither strong nor durable, it is very liable to the attacks of insects.\n\nNo. 3. Mimusops indica, r\u00e1yan. The r\u00e1yan though found in all parts of Gujar\u00e1t is most common in the northern districts. It gives a dense shade and at the end of the hot weather months (May) bears a profusion of bright yellow berries called r\u00e1yan. These are sweet and nutritious, but somewhat heating and indigestible if largely eaten. The Kolis of Northern Gujar\u00e1t, who during this season live almost entirely upon these berries, take draughts of whey to counteract any ill effects. When dried the berries called k\u00e1kodia will keep good for more than six months. From the seeds an oil is extracted which is used for burning. The timber of a light pinkish brown colour is tough and hard. Cart wheels, ploughs, and oil-men\u2019s presses are made of it, and it is especially useful for the framework of wells, having an unusual power of resisting the action of water. The r\u00e1yan is said by the natives to be one of the longest lived of their trees, not yielding fruit till it is fifty, and remaining strong and vigorous for 500 years. In appearance and fruit this tree reminds one of a well-grown olive.\n\nNo. 4. Tamarind, Tamarindus indica, \u00e1mli. The tamarind is found throughout the province, sometimes singly, in other places, chiefly on the sites of Musalm\u00e1n burying grounds, in large groves. The acid fruit is extensively used in native cookery and the pulp for the manufacture of cooling drinks. The leaves are given as fodder to cattle and are supposed greatly to increase the amount of milk given by cows. Though considered inferior to babul, the wood being hard and dense is good for fuel, and is also made into oil-presses and sugar-rollers. As it is very liable to the attacks of insects, it is not however used for house-building. The \u00e1mli is also considered to be haunted by spirits, and is worshipped in Jambughoda on a day called \u00c1mli Agi\u00e1ras. There is a red-fruited variety, Pithelocobium dulce, which affords a superior sharbat.\n\nNo. 5. Jambul, Eugenia jambolana, j\u00e1mbudo. The jambul, except in Northern Gujar\u00e1t where it is rather scarce, is found near villages and in gardens in all parts of the province. Its light grey bark and bright green oval leaves, with its drooping habit of growth, make this one of the most ornamented of trees, while its shade is good and its fruit wholesome. The berries are eaten largely and in the monsoon season (June and July) sold extensively in almost all markets. The fruit of another variety called P\u00e1ras J\u00e1mbudo is much larger than that of the common jambul, and the\nwood is said to be excellent for building purposes. Jambul timber is, however, but little used in Gujar\u00e1t. Its bark is astringent, and yields a gum resin.\n\nNo. 6. Jujube, Zizyphus jujuba, bordi. The bordi is one of the commonest fruit trees, found near villages and on cultivated as well as on waste lands. It is a low-growing wide-spreading tree, in form not unlike the English apple and producing berries much resembling those of the Siberian crab apple. The fruit is offered for sale in almost all markets during the cold season (December and January) and is much eaten. Being a thorn-bearing tree the natives hold its wood unlucky, and for this reason, though in itself tough-grained and strong, the timber is but little used for house-building purposes.\n\nNo. 7. Phyllanthus emblica, \u00e1vla or \u00e1mla, is a common jungle tree, occasionally seen in cultivated land and near villages. Its round three-ribbed astringent tasted fruit like a green gooseberry forms a good preserve, and when pickled is a favourite dainty among natives. On account of a peculiar flavour it imparts, some of the forest tribes eat it before drinking water. It is also used in washing. The bark being strongly astringent is sometimes used in diarrhoea, and, like the bark of the kher tree, said to be capable of yielding k\u00e1th. This tree though found throughout Gujar\u00e1t, is more frequent in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls jungles, and is remarkable for its graceful plume-like foliage.\n\nNo. 8. Custard apple, Anona squamosa, sit\u00e1phal. The custard apple, though seldom growing to the size of a tree, is important for its fruit's sake. Originally an exotic the custard apple has long been naturalized in Gujar\u00e1t, and where the soil is gor\u00e1du or light yellow, is found growing wild in the hedges and waste lands. The fruit is extensively sold in all markets.\n\nNo. 9. Wood apple, Feronia elephantum, kothi or kavit. The wood apple, a tree of elegant growth, though yielding but scanty shade, is found throughout the province both in cultivated and uncultivated lands. The pulp of its fruit is relished by the natives as an article of food, and is also given medicinally in cases of diarrhoea and dysentery as an astringent. Its light-coloured timber is strong and hard, but, as it is wanting in lasting qualities, it is not much used.\n\nNo. 10. Bel tree, \u00c6gle marmelos, bili. Like most of the orange family the bel tree is very ornamental, and, though rather scarce in the more populous parts of the province, is common in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. It is the astringent rind of the fruit which is valuable in diarrhoea and dysentery. The pulp is not astringent, and its only effect is that of an antiscorbutic, and as such it is of value in cases of scorbutic dysentery. The pulp of limes or oranges would do quite as well. The value of the pulp contained in its fruit as a medicine in cases of dysentery and diarrhoea is well established. Its hard light yellow wood is sometimes used for native oil-mills, but is not durable enough for house-building. The tree bears a sacred character among Hindus, and is seldom cut except by the lowest classes of the people. Its ternate leaf, an emblem of the Hindu trinity, is much esteemed as an offering to Mah\u00e1dev, and for this reason the tree is often planted near shrines and other holy places.\nNo. 11. Carissa carandas, karamda, is a thick bush common in the Surat and Panch Mah\u00e1ls jungles, particularly on hill-sides and the banks of rivers. Its glossy leaf and profusion of bright star-like sweet-scented little blossoms make it a great ornament to the scenery. Its purple fruit of the size of a sloe is much eaten by the natives when ripe and is also used as preserves. Europeans prefer it plucked just before it is ripe, when it affords a delicious taste reminding one of green gooseberries. In the parts of Gujar\u00e1t, not mentioned above, it is generally found in gardens where it is developed into a larger variety having fruit as big as an olive.\n\nNo. 12. Diospyros montana, timru. This tree, though not widely distributed, is common in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls forests. The fruit is eaten and much relished by the forest tribes, but is seldom offered for sale in the market. It has a very hard strong wood, but, except for cart poles, is not much used. The fact that it is not durable, that it suffers from the attacks of insects and cannot be crested, takes away from the value of its timber. The centre or heart-wood, which is very small, is ebony of an inferior kind; but, except that it is turned into wooden bracelets, it is apparently not known in trade. Except in the size of its fruit, which is as large as an apple, it is scarcely distinguishable from No. 13, Diospyros melanoxylon, t\u00e1mrug, whose fruit is of the size of a plum. The heart-wood of both affords an ebony. The fruit is gathered chiefly by the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s and brought into the baz\u00e1r at Godhra and H\u00e1lol for sale.\n\nNo. 14. Buchanania latifolia, ch\u00e1roli, is found sparingly in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls jungles, more frequently about J\u00e1bughoda in the N\u00e1rukot State. A small tree with pretty foliage; the berry is eaten by the natives. Found in forests it does not appear to be cultivated in gardens, though its fruit is marketable. The kernels are extensively used in native confectionery.\n\nNo. 15. Citrus acida, limbu; No. 16. Citrus limetta, mitha limbu; No. 17. Citrus limonum, kadva limbu; found in gardens throughout Gujar\u00e1t, are well known. No. 15 is used in pickles, dyeing, &c.\n\nNo. 18. Citrus medica, kavli, is found in gardens, but not common.\n\nNo. 19. Pomelo, Citrus decumana, chakotru, found only in gardens, is not worth eating.\n\nNo. 20. Orange, Citrus aurantium, n\u00e1range, is not common, found in a few gardens only, does not thrive, and the fruit consists of mere abortions.\n\nNo. 21. Averrhoa carambola, kamrakh, is found in gardens; not common throughout. Handsome in its dark green glossy leaves, clusters of small pale rose-coloured flowers, and deeply-ribbed amber fruit largely eaten. Acid juice of the fruit is said to remove iron moulds from linen.\n\nNo. 22. Pomegranate, Punica granatum, an\u00e1r or d\u00e1hdam, is not common; found in a few gardens only. The fruits of the Dholka sub-division in Ahmadabad are much esteemed. The astringent rind sometimes used in dyeing yellow.\nNo. 23. Fig, Ficus carica, anjir. Found in gardens. Fruits largely eaten.\n\nNo. 24. Mulberry, Morus indica, setur. Found in gardens; not common.\n\nNo. 25. Sweet sop, Anona reticulata, r\u00e1mphal. Found in gardens.\n\nNo. 26. Papaw, Carica papaya, pap\u00e1u. Common in gardens throughout Gujar\u00e1t; fruit when green is made into a good imitation of apple tart. Its juice when ripe is said to make tough meat tender.\n\nNo. 27. Jack, Artocarpus integrifolia, phanas. Not very common, only found in gardens and near habitations. Fruits of value eaten largely. Fine yellow-coloured hard wood used for furniture and planks.\n\nNo. 28. Cocoanut palm, Cocos nucifera, n\u00e1rel or n\u00e1riyali, is only to be found in gardens and compounds attached to temples and shrines, and grown as a curiosity. Leaves used for thatching, husk of fruit used for the coir of commerce,\u2014fruit well known. It is both eaten and used for extracting oil.\n\nNo. 29. Amygdalis communis, bud\u00e1m, is only found in gardens, not common. Kernel of nuts eaten. Grown for curiosity. Tooth brushes made of its twigs are said to be good for toothache.\n\nNo. 30. Cicca disticha, harf\u00e1-revdi. Found only in gardens. Fruit eaten and preserved.\n\nNo. 31. Areca catechu, sop\u00e1ri. Not common. Found in pleasure gardens. Nut eaten with p\u00e1n; wood used for walking sticks.\n\nNo. 32. Plantain, Musa sapientum, kel. Is plentiful in Surat; but although gardens exist there are none grown fit to eat in the rest of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\n**FLOWERS AND FLOWERING TREES.**\n\n| No. | English name | Botanical name | Vernacular name |\n|-----|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 28  |              | Michelia champaca (yellow) | F\u00e9\u00e9 champo. |\n| 29  |              | Phyllanthus emblica | K\u00e1la champo. |\n| 30  |              | Tecomaria montana coronaria | Tapra. |\n| 31  | Shoe-flower | Hibiscus rosa sinensis | T\u00e1davant. |\n| 32  |              | Bauhinia purpurea | Krash\u00e1vali or dev-k\u00e1nchan. |\n| 33  | Oleander    | Nerium odoratum | K\u00e1ren. |\n| 34  | Rose        | Rosa centifolia | G\u00e1lba. |\n| 35  | Varieties of jessamine | Jasminum grandiflorum | Champa-puli. |\n| 36  | Do.         | Do. sambac | Mogr\u00f3. |\n| 37  | Marvel of Peru | Mirabilis jalapa | Gub\u00e1s. |\n| 38  | Marygold    | Tagetes patula | Guchad\u00e1li. |\n| 39  | Basil       | Ocimum sanctum | Tulsi. |\n| 40  |             | Ocimum basilicum | Tulsi or garm\u00e1la. |\n| 41  |             | Wrightia tinctoria | Kalo k\u00e9d\u00f3. |\n| 42  |             | Wrightia tomentosa | Dudh\u00e1. |\n| 43  |             | Butea frondosa | R\u00e9n p\u00e1ng\u00e1ra. |\n| 44  |             | Bombax malabaricum | Shim\u00e1l. |\n| 45  |             | Albizia stipulata | Sh\u00e9r\u00edbar. |\n| 46  |             | Dolichos lablab falcata | N\u00e1tar\u00e9ngi. |\n| 47  |             | Morinda exota | \u00c1rvi. |\n| 48  |             | Parkinsonia aculeata | D\u00e9vi b\u00e1b\u00fal. |\n| 49  |             | Poinciana pulcherrima | Sankeshwar. |\n| 50  |             | Polycarpia elata | V\u00e1yni. |\n| 51  |             | Mimusops elengi | Borsalt. |\n| 52  |             | Agati grandiflora | Agathi. |\nNo. 33. Michelia champaca, r\u00e1e champo. Not common; found in gardens only. An ornamental tree with very strong scented yellow flowers. They are used by males for wearing in turbans and by females they are worn in the hair. They are also offered to idols. Fine timber; but not used, probably because the tree is considered sacred.\n\nNo. 34. Plumieria acuminata, khad champo. Found only in gardens and near habitations. Looks remarkably odd in the cold weather when the gouty-looking stems are bare, but pleasing during the hot and rainy seasons when it bears at their extremities bunches of white and strongly fragrant flowers, with a yellow eye and surrounded by deep green lance-shaped leaves. Its soft useless wood looks hard and strong, but is not used as timber.\n\nNo. 35. Tabern\u00e6montana coronaria, tagar. A favourite garden shrub, its sweet-scented white flowers are common as a decoration to the hall dress in Europe.\n\nNo. 36. Hibiscus rosa sinensis, j\u00e1svant, has a large handsome crimson flower, the juice of which was used to blacken leather. Hence the name shoe-flower.\n\nNo. 37. Bauhinia purpurea, krosh\u00e1vali or dev-k\u00e1nchan. A very beautiful tree when in bloom, being covered with rose-coloured sweet-scented flower in shape like that of a French Geranium (prop. Pelargonium). These are offered at the temples; not uncommon in gardens where it grows into a fair-sized tree.\n\nNos. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 are all cultivated plants.\n\nNo. 45. Cassia fistula, garm\u00e1la or b\u00e1va. Forest tree. Very beautiful when in flower; looking like a gigantic laburnum. Young leaves are used as a remedy for itch\u2014the soft matter inside the pods used medicinally and known in commerce. Bark of the root used as a purgative. Found wild most plentifully about the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad Hill\u2014more sparingly throughout the Panch Mah\u00e1ls jungles. Very rare in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nNo. 46. Wrightia tinctoria, k\u00e1lo kado, has handsome clusters of white jasmine-scented flowers with a long tube to the corolla; a garden plant; its height and habit of growing are like that of a pear tree, and blooming it shows also a mass of white blossoms. These, however, when examined more nearly prove to be flowers resembling jasmine, but larger and in branches of 10-12, or even 15, and throwing out a beautiful scent. Blossoms much esteemed as offerings at temples. Although found in Kaira gardens, is abundant throughout the Panch Mah\u00e1ls forests.\n\nNo. 47. Wrightia tomentosa, dudhi, has flowers also white, but of a more delicate make without the long tube of the last and with a peculiar spicy scent. Found only in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, especially in the rocky hills in close forests.\n\nNo. 48. Erythrina suberosa, r\u00e1n p\u00e1ng\u00e1ra. Common on the sides of the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad Hill and the neighbouring jungles. Occasionally found in other parts of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and in Kaira near the\nMahi. Conspicuous for the spikes of brilliant scarlet flowers it bears at the end of every branch just before its leaves begin to shoot; distinguishable from the Erythrina indica so frequent on Malabar Hill and in the Deccan by its sharp thorns and smaller leaves.\n\nNo. 49. Silk-cotton tree, Bombax malabaricum, sainay or shimal. It also bears its fleshy crimson blossoms before the shooting of its leaves, and is then a great ornament to the landscape. The silky down from its pods is much valued for stuffing pillows, cushions, and mattresses, which are then more luxuriously soft than those stuffed with ordinary cotton. Its light and soft wood is used for troughs, water conduits, canoes, wooden platters, and sword scabbard.\n\nNo. 50. Albizzia stipulata, shembar. Has large flowers of a beautiful pink, and is not uncommon in the Panch Mahals jungles.\n\nNo. 51. Dolichandrone falcata, netarsingi. Has pretty white fritted flowers and grows to a fair size in the Panch Mahals jungles.\n\nNo. 52. Morinda exerta, alri or \u00e1lan. The fruit is eaten pickled; from the bark of the root a yellow dye is extracted, and its wood, a very pretty bright yellow in colour, appears suitable for turning. But it is most noticeable in April and May for its profusion of waxen-white sweet-scented flowers.\n\nNo. 53. Parkinsonia aculeata, devi b\u00e1bul, occasionally found in waste lands and borders of fields. When in flower with its long drooping plumes of blossoms clear yellow touched with red, it is very pretty, but for the greater part of the year it is a ragged looking plant hardly reaching to the dignity of a tree.\n\nNo. 54. Poinciana pulcherrima, sankeshvar. There is no doubt that this tree is a Poinciana. It could answer the description of Poinciana elata in Dalz, since it has white flowers turning to yellow, but it wants the lax purple filament. It must, therefore, be a distinct variety; met with in Kaira here and there about the outskirts of villages, but it grows wild in the jungles.\n\nNo. 55. Poinciana elata, v\u00e1ymi. This is the real Poinciana elata to be found in the Bhadar at Ahmadabad and near Godhra, and in the neighbourhood of villages in Kaira; but is rare.\n\nNo. 56. Mimusops elengi, borsali. Not a lofty but a very handsome tree with spreading branches and dark green shining leaves, sweet-scented small blossoms, and berries of which natives make a preserve. The wood strong and durable. Found very rarely in gardens.\n\nNo. 57. Agati grandiflora, agathio. Not seen in forests; common. The large rose-coloured and white flowers are shaped like those of a sweet pea and smell like a fresh apple. They are much used by the natives as offerings at shrines. Also they as well as the pods are eaten in pickles and made into curries. Though very erect the agathio is hardly large enough to be called a tree.\n### TIMBER TREES\n\n| No. | English name | Botanical name | Vernacular name |\n|-----|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 58  | Teak         | Tectona grandis | S\u00e1g or s\u00e1gw\u00e1n.  |\n| 59  | Blackwood    | Dalbergia sissoo | Sisam or sisoo. |\n| 60  | Adina cordifolia | Aladhvan.       |                 |\n| 61  | Stephegyne parviflora | Kalam.          |                 |\n| 62  | Ougeinia dalbergioides | Tanach.        |                 |\n| 63  | Terminalia tomentosa | Ain.            |                 |\n| 64  | Pterocarpus marsupium | Avar bila.     |                 |\n| 65  | Schrebera retinoides | Moka.           |                 |\n| 66  | Acacia kerek | Kathi or kegar. |                 |\n| 67  | Schleichera trijuga | Kosamb.         |                 |\n| 68  | Albizzia odoratissima | K\u00f3loasras.    |                 |\n| 69  | Grewia asiatica | Shidman.        |                 |\n| 70  | Gmelina arborea | Shidman.        |                 |\n| 71  | Babul        | Ascalia arabica | B\u00e9tol.          |\n| 72  | Dalbergia paniculata | Passi.         |                 |\n| 73  | Anogeissus latifolius | Dheda.        |                 |\n| 74  | Briedelia montana | Asanna.        |                 |\n\n**No. 58.** Teak, *Tectona grandis*, *s\u00e1g* or *s\u00e1gw\u00e1n*. Though the teak is found in the Panch Mah\u00e1l forests and in some parts of the Surat district, all large teak logs come from the D\u00e1ngs. The timber of this tree useful for nearly every purpose is for all works requiring strength and size by much the best wood grown in Gujar\u00e1t. The timber is light in colour with a reddish brown tinge near the heart of the tree; strong, very durable, and not too heavy.\n\n**No. 59.** Blackwood, *Dalbergia sissoo*, *sisam* or *sisoo*. Blackwood is pretty widely distributed over the whole province, but is common only on the slopes of the eastern range of hills. As compared with the forests of Southern India the blackwood of Gujar\u00e1t attains no considerable size. Logs eighteen inches in diameter are seldom met with. The timber is of a very dark colour, strong and durable. It is used for furniture, for carriages and carts, and very seldom in house-building for uprights. It is too heavy to be commonly used for other purposes.\n\n**No. 60.** Adina cordifolia, *aladhvan*. This tree though pretty widely distributed attains a considerable size only in the D\u00e1ng forests. Not found in Kaira or Ahmadabad; it is very frequent in the Panch Mah\u00e1l forests. The timber, which is light yellow in colour, is neither very strong nor very durable. Its chief use is in house-building for panelling.\n\n**No. 61.** Stephegyne parviflora, *kalam*. Very similar to *aladhvan*, but not nearly so extensively used. Common in the Panch Mah\u00e1l forests. Wood reddish-coloured, close-grained and good for gunstocks.\n\n**No. 62.** Ougeinia dalbergioides, *tanach*. Large logs are not procurable, as the tree does not grow to any size and is seldom free from flaws. This, which is very tough wood of a light colour, is used for poles of country carts and is suited for purposes in which strength, toughness, and comparative lightness are required.\n\n**No. 63.** Terminalia tomentosa, *ain*. Though found in almost all the wilder parts of the province, this tree grows to no great height except in the D\u00e1ngs.\u00b9 The bark is used by Bhils to poison\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 There are not a few fine *ain* trees in the Panch Mah\u00e1l forests.\nfish. The timber is dark reddish brown in colour and in texture is very hard, heavy, strong, and durable. It is used in house-building, but on account of its weight, is rather objected to.\n\nNo. 64. Pterocarpus marsupium, bio or bibla. This tree is found only in large forest tracts. To get at the leaves, an excellent fodder, professional cattle-breeders often do great damage to these trees. Its timber is valuable for building purposes, being second only to teak.\n\nNo. 65. Schrebera swietenioides, moka. The tree grows to a good size though not very common in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Its timber is hard, strong, and tough; not used in house-building. Makes excellent cart wheels.\n\nNo. 66. Acacia kerek, kathli or kegar. The timber of this tree, which in colour is very dark, is heavy, strong, and hard. It is not much known, its weight preventing it from being generally used. Except in colour it is very similar to kher and may still prove to be as valuable.\n\nNo. 67. Schleichera trijuga, kosamb. Except in the D\u00e1ng forests this tree grows to no size. It yields lac. The timber is very hard and strong, considered unequalled for the naves and axles of cart wheels. It is, however, seldom if ever offered for sale in the market.\n\nNo. 68. Albizzia odoratissima, k\u00e1losaras. So called probably from its heartwood being almost black while the outer wood is white. It grows freely, gives a tolerable though not a dense shade, and is on the whole an ornamental tree. Bark brown; wood hard and strong, used for cart wheels; not much known in trade, nor preserved as timber by the Forest Department. Bark used for embroacations. The leaves boiled and applied externally are considered a remedy for rheumatism. The blossoms, which appear like tufts of green worsted, give out a most delicious apricot like scent. The timber takes a fine polish and is good material for desks or work-boxes.\n\nNo. 69. Grewia asiatica, dh\u00e1man. Does not grow to any large size, but is well known in trade. Has an edible fruit of a pleasant acid taste. The wood is light and strong, and is valued for shafts of carriages. Found in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls forests.\n\nNo. 70. Gmelina arborea, shevan. The fruit is eaten by goats and cattle. The wood very light both in colour and weight is used for furniture and ordinary purposes; is first rate for carriage parcels. It is well known in trade. Found in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls forests. A large tree conspicuous for its abundant and beautiful yellow flowers.\n\nNo. 71. Babul, Acacia arabica, bav\u00e1l. Is the most useful tree and found throughout the province. The pods while green are a first-rate fodder for fattening sheep and goats. The tree yields an inferior gum arabic, the bark is much used in tanning, and when mixed with that of the r\u00e1yan and mahuda gives a fine brown dye. In the Surat district it is the practice for cultivators to set apart\nsome of their land for the growth of the babul. In all parts of the province its growth is encouraged on the edges of fields, not only for fuel, but because of the value of its timber for the manufacture of all sorts of agricultural implements. The wood is considered second only to kher, and is used for making carts, oil-mills, sugar-rollers, house beams, and other articles where great strength is required.\n\nNo. 72. Dalbergia paniculata, passi. A fine and rather graceful tree scattered sparsely about the Panch Mah\u00e1ls jungles, giving a light-coloured strong wood.\n\nNo. 73. Anogeissus latifolius, dh\u00e1vda. This tree yields a perfectly white gum known in trade, but not of much value. The wood is light in colour and very hard. It is used for the axles of country carts, but not for general purposes. Its gray bush and graceful habit of growth make it an ornament of the forest.\n\nNo. 74. Briedelia montana, asanna. A good timber tree found in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls jungles, in appearance something like a j\u00e1mbul.\n\n**AROMA AND SPICE-PRODUCING TREES.**\n\n| No. | English name | Botanical name | Vernacular name |\n|-----|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 75  | Sandal wood  | Santalum album | Chandan.       |\n| 76  | Boswellia serata | Boswellia serata | Gugal.         |\n\n**DYE PIGMENT AND TAN-YIELDING TREES.**\n\n| No. | English name | Botanical name | Vernacular name |\n|-----|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 77  | Nyctanthes arbor-tristis | Nyctanthes arbor-tristis | P\u00e1rij\u00e1tak. |\n| 78  | Bastard teak | Butea frondosa | Kh\u00e1khiro.     |\n| 79  | Catechu tree | Acacia catechu | Behda.        |\n| 80  | Terminalia bellerica | Terminalia bellerica | Dh\u00e1vati.    |\n| 81  | Woodfordia floribunda | Woodfordia floribunda | Rohan.      |\n| 82  | Soymida febrifuga | Soymida febrifuga | Rohan.      |\n\nNo. 75. Sandal tree, Santalum album, chandan. Is found sparingly in the fields in Kaira and Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Found wild here and there in the hedges\u2014not common. Wood inferior in size, but certainly not so in quality to the sandalwood of Mysore.\n\nNo. 76. Boswellia serata, gugal. Yields a sort of resin in great abundance. The wood, which is very light and soft, is made into wooden platters. The resin is used by natives as incense in religious rites, and a stake cut from this tree is set in the ground where a marriage takes place amongst Bhils.\n\nNo. 77. Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, p\u00e1rij\u00e1tak. Found only in gardens and near habitations. A tree from 10 to 30 feet high covered each night in the rains with star-like white flowers with orange centre having a delightful honey-like fragrance. These drop off each morning. The stem of the flower yields a yellow dye which is much used in dyeing turbans.\n\nNo. 78. Bastard teak, Butea frondosa, kh\u00e1khiro. The bastard teak well known for its mass of strange scarlet flowers is found throughout the province, but is especially common in its less cultivated parts. Though its wood does not serve for timber, this is one of the most generally useful of trees. From its leaves are\nformed the cups and platters used at their meals by almost all high class Hindus. The flowers yield a yellow dye known as kesudina ful, the same which in the form of a yellow decoction is much used at Holi time. The tree is well suited for the production of lac besides yielding a valuable red gum. The seed of the beans is known as palas p\u00e1pda and used medicinally as a cure for worms. The fibre of its roots is well suited for the manufacture of ropes.\n\nNo. 79. Acacia catechu, kher. This tree is very common in the D\u00e1ng, Panch Mah\u00e1ls, and Rewa K\u00e1ntha forests. Its most important product is the astringent extract called k\u00e1tho, Terra japonica, commonly eaten with betel leaves. The preparation of this extract, which further south has given their name to the K\u00e1thkaris or K\u00e1thodis of the Th\u00e1na hills, furnishes employment to several of the forest tribes of Eastern Gujar\u00e1t. The mode of preparing this extract varies to some extent in different parts of the province. In the Rewa K\u00e1ntha forests branches of the kher tree stripped of their bark are chopped into small pieces between three and four inches long. These are then thrown into earthen pots filled with water and boiled until the greater part of the water evaporates. The thick sticky substance remaining in these earthen pots is next placed in a small bamboo basket set over the mouth of a narrow hole about five or six feet deep. Here the decoction is allowed to strain. When the straining process is complete the hard useless portions are left in the basket above, the watery part passes off soaking through into the earth, and the valuable extract is found in the pit and placed on leaves in the sun to dry.\n\nIn the D\u00e1ng forests in the south-east of Gujar\u00e1t a slightly different process is adopted. The heartwood is cut into chips by the men and the boiling is superintended by the women. Each woman has in front of her two rows of six pipkins each in which the chips are boiled; in the centre are two large pots, into which the concentrated k\u00e1th from the smaller pots is collected; here it is allowed to thicken still more, and finally is extracted in portions as large as can be taken up in the fingers and left to dry in the sun. The people who make the k\u00e1th are of a low race and filthily dirty, and the dirtiness of the people is rivalled by the dirtiness of the process.\n\nBesides this artificial product the kher tree yields a bright amber-coloured gum valued for its astringent properties. The bark is used in tanning and dyeing, and by Bhils for poisoning fish. The timber is red in colour and of excellent quality, being durable, hard, strong, and heavy. Though from its somewhat crooked habit of growth good kher logs are seldom obtained, yet for beams driven into the ground, piles left to stand in water and generally where wood work is likely to be much exposed to the weather this timber is prized. For burning purposes it is also valued both as firewood and in the manufacture of charcoal.\n\nNo. 80. Terminalia bellerica, beheda. A very large and handsome forest tree. The fruit, the myrobalans of commerce, is used in tanning leather and by the Bhils to poison fish.\n\nNo. 81. Woodfordia floribunda, dh\u00e1vri. From the blossoms of this small tree a red dye is extracted.\nNo. 82. *Soymida febrifuga*, rohan. Ch\u0101rans and other cattle-breeders feed their buffaloes on the fruit of this tree. From the bark a purple brown dye is obtained. Its timber is dark in colour and strong, but as it is too heavy for general purposes it is seldom used.\n\n**Other Useful Trees**\n\n| No. | English name | Botanical name | Vernacular name |\n|-----|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 83  |              | *Holarrhena antidysenterica* | Kada.           |\n| 84  |              | *Bauhinia racemosa* | Jengi, asotri, or asindro. |\n| 85  |              | *Prosopis spicegera* | Samdi.          |\n| 86  |              | *Moringa pterygosperma* | Sekto or saragvo. |\n| 87  | Bamboo       | *Bambusa arundinacea* | Vans.           |\n| 88  |              | *Murraya koenigii* | Mitho limdo.    |\n\nNo. 83. *Holarrhena antidysenterica*, kada. The seed of this tree called *indra jav* is used medicinally as a cure in cases of worms.\n\nNo. 84. *Bauhinia racemosa*, jengi, asotri or asindro. Is a pretty tree though never of large growth. The leaves are famous, for the country cigarette is generally made of tobacco rolled up in them. At the Dasera festival, natives give each other leaves of this tree, calling them gold. The wood both light and strong is used for legs to native cots.\n\nNo. 85. *Prosopis spicegera*, samdi. This common tree, in appearance not unlike a leafless babul, grows to no great size. Its pods are edible and its timber useful for curbs in well-sinking. This is one of the sacred trees of the Hindus. It is worshipped on the Dasera festival (October), because on a tree of this kind the five P\u0101ndav princes hung up their arms when they entered Vir\u0101t Nagri in disguise. On the tree the arms turned to snakes and there remained untouched till the owners came back to claim them.\n\nNo. 86. *Moringa pterygosperma*, saragvo or sekto. There are two varieties of this tree, one with sweet and the other with bitter pods. From the seeds of both the ben oil used by watchmakers is obtained. The roots are an excellent substitute for horse radish. The other variety is horse radish tree, which yields an inferior gum very plentifully; seldom seen in the forest; more common near villages; grows very rapidly, but is very short-lived. Beans eaten in curry. Bark used for embrocations. No use as timber.\n\nNo. 87. Bamboo, *Bambusa arundinacea*, vans. The very large kinds of bamboos are not found in the Gujar\u0101t circle, but they run up to a good size, say ten inches in circumference at the butt in the D\u0101ngs. Seed sometimes boiled and eaten in seasons of scarcity. Well known and used for various purposes. Young shoots are made into pickles.\n\nNo. 88. *Murraya koenigii*, mitho limdo. Very similar to the common nim, but much rarer. Leaves used in native cooking as a condiment.\nLIQUOR-YIELDING TREES.\n\n| No. | English name       | Botanical name          | Vernacular name |\n|-----|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n| 89  | Palmyra            | Borassus flabelliformis | T\u00e1di, Khajuri   |\n| 90  | Bastard Date       | Phoenix sylvestris      |                 |\n\nNo. 89. Palmyra palm, Borassus flabelliformis, t\u00e1di. Not common throughout the whole Gujar\u00e1t. One or two may be seen here and there towering above the other trees and serving for a landmark; yields t\u00e1di, a well-known intoxicating drink made from the sap. Leaves used for thatching and basket work; wood sometimes used for water conduits.\n\nNo. 90. Bastard date-palm, Phoenix sylvestris, khajuri. Not common throughout Gujar\u00e1t. Found in abundance in the Surat district; yields t\u00e1di; contains sugar in considerable quantity. Leaves used for matting and basket work. Fruit eaten by poor people, but not palatable.

Terminalia arjuna, panio s\u00e1dado. This tree is found only in forest tracts near water-courses. The timber is seldom used for house-building or other purposes.\n\nNo. 92. Ficus glomerata, gular, or umbardo. Found throughout Gujar\u00e1t in forests and occasionally near villages and in fields. The fruit, which is much sought after by bears, is sometimes eaten by the forest tribes. The leaves are a favourite fodder for goats.\n\nNo. 93. Lagerstroemia parviflora, bond\u00e1ra. Though sometimes used in building huts, its timber is useless for ordinary purposes.\n\nNo. 94 Sterculia urens, kad\u00e1i, or kangdoli. It yields large quantities of gum, but of so inferior a kind as to have no market value.\n\nNo. 95. Moyna or moghal. This tree like the last yields a large quantity of very inferior gum.\nNo. 96. *Melia azadirachta*, *bakkan limdo*. Handsome tree, grows fast, and would do for road side. Bark used medicinally for worms.\n\nNo. 97. Banian tree, *Ficus bengalensis*, *vad*, No. 98, *Ficus religiosa*, *piplo*, and No. 99, *Ficus tsiela*, *pipad*, are common in Gujar\u00e1t as they are all over India. They are often planted as shade trees in avenues along roads or on open spots near and within village towns. The wood of these trees on account of their religious character is not used even for fuel. The leaves of No. 97 are a most favourite fodder for goats, and the ends of the pendent roots are much esteemed as tooth sticks. The milk is used medicinally. The holy fig-tree No. 98 is worshipped by native females on various occasions. Among other blessings the worship of this tree is held to procure to the worshipper (1) children; (2) a husband's favour; (3) personal salvation. It is also considered to be haunted by the spirits of the dead, to whose movements is attributed the constant agitation of its leaves even when there is apparently no wind. Cattle and birds eat the figs of No. 99, and its milky sap is used for bird lime.\n\nNo. 100. *Nim*, *Azadirachta indica*, *limdo*. The nim common in all parts of the province is a valuable road-side tree. By the natives its shade is considered particularly healthful, as well as cooling, while the bitterness of its juice saves the tree from the attacks of white ants. Its leaves are useful as fodder for camels. The skin is also supposed to have valuable medicinal properties, a decoction of the bark being a favourite drink in cases of fever, while a plaster of boiled nim leaves and the earth of white ant's nest is considered a first-rate application for reducing inflammation. The seeds are collected by the poor, and when crushed afford an oil for lamps. The timber though strong is not much used. On their new year's day *Chaitra suddha Padvo* (March-April), Hindus, especially Deccani Br\u00e1hmans, drink a juice extracted from the leaves of the nim. This they do, believing that the lives of all who begin the year by drinking nim juice will be spared till its close.\n\nNo. 101. *Pongamia glabra*, *karanj* or *kannaj*. Useful and ornamental as a road-side tree. The fixed oil expressed from its seed is used as an external application in cases of ringworm and other skin diseases in men, and as a cure for mange in dogs and cattle. Mixed with paste and wool this oil is used in the manufacture of country felt.\n\nNo. 102. *Ulmus integrifolia*, *kamraj* or *v\u00e1vli*. The *kamraj* is by the natives believed to be the male of the foregoing. But this is not the case, as each tree bears its own seed. Though in some ways much alike the *karanj*, it can be easily distinguished by the want of polish on its leaves and by its bolder habit of growth.\n\nNo. 103. *Ailanthus excelsa*, *aduso*. The large leaves of this tree are a useful fodder for camels.\n\nNo. 104. *Polyalthea longifolia*, *\u00e1sop\u00e1lav* or *\u00e1sup\u00e1l*. Looks like mango and is found occasionally wild about the fields; a handsome erect growing tree having long wavy shining leaves. The leaves are used in marriage ceremonies for covering *m\u00e1ndv\u00e1s*. It is found but rarely in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls jungles.\nNo. 105. Gum-berry, Cordia rothii, gundi. Found commonly near villages and in fields. Fruit made into pickle.\n\nNo. 106. Cordia myxa, vadgundi. Is as large as a small cherry, and so sticky that when you have once bitten it you can hardly again open your mouth. This tree has, however, broader leaves than its sister gumberry; grows to a much greater size, gives a good shade, and is more common in the fields.\n\nNo. 107. Albizzia lebbek, dholio saras. Light-coloured wood fairly strong, but not much used. Hardly to be considered as a timber tree.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS TREES\n\n| No. | English name | Botanical name | Vernacular name |\n|-----|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 108 | Acacia tomentosa | Anjar. | Ateri. |\n| 109 | Balanites roxburghii | Hingori. | Mindhal. |\n| 110 | Morinda citrifolia | Al. | Bhindi or palaspiplo |\n| 111 | Thespesia populnea | Chor\u00e1mla. | Anklo. |\n| 112 | Adansonia digitata | Gugal. | Andrak. |\n\nNo. 108.
