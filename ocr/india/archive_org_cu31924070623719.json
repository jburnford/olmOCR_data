In 1881 it had a population of 582,487 or 128.84 to the square mile, and in 1882 a realizable land revenue of \u00a3104,969 (Rs. 10,49,690).\n\nExcept B\u00e1rsi in the north-east which is surrounded by the Niz\u00e1m's country, Shol\u00e1pur is bounded on the north by Ahmadnagar and the Niz\u00e1m's country; on the east by the Niz\u00e1m's country and the Akalkot state; on the south by the river Bhima, the district of Bij\u00e1pur, and the Patvardhan and Jath states; and on the west by \u00c1tp\u00e1di, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Phaltan, Poona, and Ahmadnagar. The district outline is irregular. Beyond the limits of the main body of the district in the extreme north-east lies the whole of B\u00e1rsi, and several groups of Karm\u00e1la, Shol\u00e1pur, and S\u00e1ngola villages. Several Akalkot, Jath, Niz\u00e1m, and Patvardhan villages also lie within Shol\u00e1pur limits.\n\nFor administrative purposes the lands of the district are distributed over seven sub-divisions. Of these B\u00e1rsi lies isolated in the north-east, Shol\u00e1pur is in the south-east, S\u00e1ngola in the south-west, M\u00e1l\u00edsiras in the west, Karm\u00e1la in the north-west, and M\u00e1dha and Pandharpur in the centre. These sub-divisions have, on an average, an area of 646 square miles, 102 villages, and 83,212 people:\n\n| Sub-Division | Area | Villages | Population |\n|--------------|------|----------|------------|\n|              |      | Government | Alienated | Total |\n|              |      | Villages | Hamlets | Villages | Hamlets | Government | Alienated | Total |\n| B\u00e1rsi        | 596  | 145      | 3        | 16       | 6       | 4         | 148       | 162     | 110,046 | 184,844 | 29,682 |\n| Shol\u00e1pur     | 647  | 116      | 32       | 11       | 3       | 4         | 115       | 122     | 149,589 | 176,551 | 19,764 |\n| S\u00e1ngola      | 649  | 84       | 3        | 3        | 4       | 3         | 85        | 99      | 62,849  | 96,824  | 13,975 |\n| M\u00e1l\u00edsiras    | 574  | 112      | 29       | 4        | 11      | 1         | 112       | 112     | 68,332  | 101,632 | 15,322 |\n| Karm\u00e1la      | 766  | 77       | 1        | 15       | 1       | 8         | 78        | 86      | 61,545  | 80,341  | 11,488 |\n| M\u00e1dha        | 619  | 68       | 51       | 3        | 12      | 1         | 57        | 69      | 76,961  | 109,797 | 8455   |\n| Pandharpur   | 470  | 57       | 37       | 12       | 1       | 1         | 57        | 69      | 72,212  | 153,94  | 8449   |\n| Total        | 4521 | 658      | 5        | 212      | 25      | 54       | 8         | 653     | 54      | 717     | 582,487 | 128,84  | 104,969 |\n\nChapter I.\nDescription.\n\nBoundaries.\n\nSub-Divisions.\nThe district has a length of about 100 miles from the north of Karm\u00e1la to the south of S\u00e1ngola, and a breadth of about 100 miles from the west of M\u00e1lsiras to the east of Shol\u00e1pur. It lies in the basins of the Nira, Bhima, and Sina. Most of M\u00e1lsiras in the west drains north into the Nira which falls into the Bhima in the west of the district. The drainage area of the Bhima, which winds north-east through the centre of the district, includes on the left bank south Karm\u00e1la, M\u00e1dha, Pandharpur, and south Shol\u00e1pur, and on the right bank east M\u00e1lsiras, S\u00e1ngola, and south Phandharpur. The Sina, which flows roughly south-east parallel to the Bhima, drains B\u00e1rsi and north-east Shol\u00e1pur on the left, and north Karm\u00e1la and M\u00e1dha and a little of central Shol\u00e1pur on the right. Round Shol\u00e1pur the country is about 1800 feet above sea level. Except north B\u00e1rsi west M\u00e1dha and south-west M\u00e1lsiras and Karm\u00e1la which are hilly, Shol\u00e1pur is flat or waving. Most of the surface rolls in long low uplands separated by hollows, with an occasional level. The shallow-soiled uplands are suited for pasture, and the deep-soiled lowlands under careful tillage yield the richest crops. In Karm\u00e1la and M\u00e1dha in the north-east and centre the watershed of the Bhima and Sina is marked by low table lands and small separate hills. Except this, the Shol\u00e1pur uplands are gently rounded swellings of trap overgrown with yellow stunted spear-grass. Low-lying villages are shaded by trees, and B\u00e1rsi has large mango groves. The rest of the district is bare bleak and treeless. The only timber trees are stunted b\u00e1bhuls and mangoes and a few n\u00edms Azadirachta indica and pipals Ficus religiosa. As these afford no cover the district is without the larger wild animals except the wild pig and wolves. Near river and stream banks the soil is deep black and rich, and on rising ground it is gravelly and reddish, yielding little but stunted yellow spear-grass. In S\u00e1ngola the soil is black and stony. The villages, as a rule, are small and generally lie on stream or river banks one to four miles apart. The B\u00e1rsi and M\u00e1dha villages are shady; in the rest of the district they are generally bare. Except in S\u00e1ngola and M\u00e1lsiras most of the villages are walled. In Shol\u00e1pur the village walls have fallen, and in other parts they are decaying, though in almost all the gate remains. In Pandharpur and S\u00e1ngola the husbandmen though poor, are skilful; in the rest of the district, they are generally poor and careless, trusting much to chance and the season.\n\nExcept in B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, M\u00e1dha, and M\u00e1lsiras, Shol\u00e1pur has few hills. The chief hills are Vadshigh\u00e1t in B\u00e1rsi, V\u00e1ghoba and Bodki in Karm\u00e1la, Chinchgaon in M\u00e1dha, and Gurvad in M\u00e1lsiras. In north B\u00e1rsi several spurs from the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t range in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country, twelve to sixteen miles to the north-east, pass south for a few miles. Of these the chief is the Vadshigh\u00e1t about fourteen miles east of B\u00e1rsi, noted for a cave temple sacred to R\u00e1meshvar. In Karm\u00e1la V\u00e1ghoba hill, about 210 feet high, and Bodki hill, about 190 feet high, lie about sixteen miles south-east of Karm\u00e1la. The slopes of both hills are covered with stunted grass, and the tops are flat and untilled. Above the trap rock the hills have generally three layers of soil, a surface\nlayer of red *murum*, a second of white earth mixed with lime stone, and a third of *murum* or broken trap. In the M\u00e1dha sub-division, about four miles north of M\u00e1dha, the *m\u00e1la* or highland of Chinchgaon, about 300 feet above the plain, lies between the villages of Chinchgaon Tadval and Vadshinga. The hill is steep and covered with grass and has a spring at the foot. Its flat top is tilled by Mar\u00e1thia husbandmen, and a cart-road passes by the hill with little traffic. A layer of *murum* or broken trap separates the black surface soil from the central trap. In the west of the district a chain of flat-topped hills runs along south-west M\u00e1lsiras. The chief hill, near the village of Gurvad, about eight miles south of M\u00e1lsiras, is crowned by a temple of Tuk\u00e1\u00ed about 400 years old.\n\nThe chief rivers are the Bhima, with its right bank feeders the Nira and the M\u00e1n, and its left bank feeder the Sina which receives the Bhog\u00e1vati from the north. The Bhima and Sina run south-east, the Nira nearly east, the M\u00e1n north-east, and the Bhog\u00e1vati south-east. During the dry season all the rivers are fordable; even in the Bhima except occasional pools the stream dries or runs only ankle-deep. During the south-west monsoon the smaller streams are flooded by local rain, and the Bhima by heavy falls in the Poona Sahy\u00e1dris.\n\nThe Bhima is one of the chief feeders of the Krishna. It rises in $19^\\circ 4'$ north latitude and $73^\\circ 34'$ east longitude, in the Sahy\u00e1dris in the Khed sub-division of Poona. The source of the river, which is adorned by the temple of Bhim\u00e1shankar, is one of the twelve chief *ling* shrines in India. From Bhim\u00e1shankar the river runs south-east through Poona, Ahmadnagar, Shol\u00e1pur, and Bij\u00e1pur, and, after forming the north-eastern boundary of the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak, falls into the Krishna about sixteen miles north of Raichur in the Niz\u00e1m's territory. Of about 180 miles which lie within Shol\u00e1pur limits, for a winding length of about seventy miles the river separates Karm\u00e1la on the left from Ind\u00e1pur in Poona on the right; for about six miles it separates M\u00e1dha on the left from M\u00e1lsiras on the right; for about twenty miles it separates Pandharpur on the left from M\u00e1lsiras on the right; for about forty miles it passes through Pandharpur; and for about forty miles it separates Shol\u00e1pur on the left from Bij\u00e1pur on the right. The course of the river is throughout winding with a generally south-east direction. Near the centre of the Pandharpur subdivision it passes on the right Pandharpur one of the holiest places in the Deccan. Of its three feeders the Bhima receives the Nira from the right about five miles south-west of Tembhurni in Karm\u00e1la, in the west of the district; the M\u00e1n also from the the right near Sarkoli about ten miles south-east of Pandharpur in the south of the district; and the Sina from the left about ten miles southwest of Ahirv\u00e1di in Shol\u00e1pur in the south-east of the district. The water of the Bhima is little used for irrigation. The river flows between high alluvial and tilled banks 500 to 1500 feet apart. In places it is rocky, but as a rule the bed is either smooth and gravelly or muddy. Beginning from the north, the Bhima is crossed by nine ferries, three in Pandharpur, at Kuroli Pandharpur and Brahmapuri, and six in Shol\u00e1pur, at Ghodeshvar, Kus\u00e1r, Bhandar-Kavta, Sad\u00e9pur,\nAurj, and T\u00e1lki. During the rains the Bhima flows full and strong with occasional floods. After the rains it rapidly dwindles, till in the hot season pools remain only in the deeper hollows with an occasional flow in the parts between.\n\nThe Nira, the chief right bank feeder of the Bhima, rises in the Bhor state in the spur of the Sahy\u00e1dris which is crowned by the fort of Torna. From the Sahy\u00e1dris it runs south-east and east along the borders of Poona, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and Shol\u00e1pur. Of its total length of 110 miles about thirty lie on the borders of Poona and Shol\u00e1pur. During these thirty miles the Nira runs nearly east forming the north boundary of M\u00e1lsiras, and, passing the villages of Akluj and T\u00e1bve, falls into the Bhima about five miles south-west of Tembhurni in Karm\u00e1la. The banks of the Nira are steep and rocky and its bed is gravelly. It is about 400 feet broad, and has a few small pools from which water is drawn by lifts or budkis to water garden crops.\n\nThe M\u00e1n, a right bank feeder of the Bhima, rises in a spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range in the M\u00e1n sub-division of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and runs through M\u00e1n in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, \u00c1tp\u00e1di in the Pant Pratinidhi state, and S\u00e1ngola and Pandharpur in Shol\u00e1pur. Of its total length of about 100 miles, about fifty lie within Shol\u00e1pur limits. For about fifty miles to the west of Shol\u00e1pur limits the river runs south-east, and, for fifty miles within Shol\u00e1pur limits, it runs north-east passing the towns of Nazre and S\u00e1ngola, and falling into the Bhima at Sarkoli, about ten miles south-east of Phandharpur. The banks of the M\u00e1n are low and cultivated, and its bed is gravelly.\n\nThe Sina, one of the chief left bank feeders of the Bhima, rises fourteen miles west of the town of Ahmadnagar, and running south-east through Ahmadnagar and Shol\u00e1pur, falls into the Bhima near Kudul, about twenty miles south of Shol\u00e1pur. Of 110 miles, the total length of the Sina within Shol\u00e1pur limits, for about sixty the Sina separates the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country on the left from Karm\u00e1la and M\u00e1dha on the right; for forty-five miles it flows through M\u00e1dha and Shol\u00e1pur; and for five miles it separates Akalkot on the left from Shol\u00e1pur on the right. About four miles north of Mohol in M\u00e1dha, the Sina receives the Bhog\u00e1vati after a course of about forty miles north through B\u00e1rsi and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s lands. The Nira is 300 to 600 feet broad. The banks are steep and earthy and the bed sandy and sometimes rocky. The Sina is crossed by five ferries, one in M\u00e1dha at Kolgaon, and four in Shol\u00e1pur at Lamboti, Tirha, Vaddakb\u00e1l, and V\u00e1ngi.\n\nThe Bhog\u00e1vati, a large tributary of the Sina, rises in the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t range in the north-east of B\u00e1rsi, and after a south-westerly course of about forty miles through B\u00e1rsi and part of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s dominions and M\u00e1dha falls into the Sina about four miles north of Mohol in M\u00e1dha. It is about 100 feet broad, and has a slender stream during the hot season.\n\nAs the rainfall is light and uncertain Shol\u00e1pur often suffers from want of water. Even in ordinary seasons during the hot weather the smaller streams and most of the wells dry and the water in the reservoirs becomes scanty and unwholesome. In 1882-83 according\nto the Collector's returns, Shol\u00e1pur had 18,402 wells and 253 ponds. Of late years much has been done to improve the water storage of the district, the chief work being the making of the Ekr\u00fck lake about three miles north of Shol\u00e1pur with an area of 4640 acres of water surface and commanding 17,746 acres of land. The other most important reservoirs are at Koregaon in B\u00e1rsi, and Ashti in M\u00e1dha, and four water supply-works at Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1l\u00e1, and M\u00e1dha.\n\nAs in most of the Deccan, the general geological formation is trap, covered in most places with a shallow over-layer of very light soil, and in parts by a good depth of rich loam suited for cotton.\n\nThe climate of Shol\u00e1pur is healthy, and, except the hot months of March April and May, is agreeable and free from extremes of heat or of cold. The year may be roughly divided into three nearly equal seasons; the cold season from November to February, the hot season from March to mid-June, and the rainy season from mid-June to the end of October. October is a time of transition from the rainy to the cold season. During the cold season the air is generally bright, clear, and bracing, the nights and mornings being especially cool and freshening. Easterly and north-easterly winds prevail but are not strong enough to be unpleasant. The hot season from March to June, especially during March and April, is marked by a dry scorching heat. The mean temperature during this period is $86^\\circ$; and the climate is oppressive with strong hot winds and occasional dust-storms. In March the hot winds blow from the east and in April and May from the west. The hot winds generally cease after nine and the nights are usually cool. During May clouds begin to gather, the wind grows fitful, and heavy thunderstorms generally cool the air. The rainy months are pleasant. The sky is more or less overcast, rain falls in frequent heavy showers broken by gleams of sunshine, the moisture is never excessive, the temperature is generally mild and even, and the wind almost always fresh and cool from the west and south-west, a delightful change from the dry stifling hot winds. The mean temperature during the rains is $80^\\circ$ and from November to February about $73^\\circ$. Bitter cold is almost unknown.\n\nAll over the district the rainfall is scanty. For the ten years ending 1882 rain returns are available for seven stations.

trap, nodular limestone or kankar is everywhere abundant. At Sholapur unslaked lime fit for whitewash sells at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)d. the pound (Rs. 15 the khandi), and slaked lime used in building at \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\)d. the pound (Rs. 9 the khandi).\n\nThe building stone of the district is trap or basalt found either in quarries or in boulders strewn over the murum plain. The stone used at Sholapur is brought less than fifteen miles from Chincholi, Darphal, Haglur, Kegaon, Kondi, Lamboti, Pakni, Savleshvar, and Shelgi. The Savleshvar quarries supply slabs four to six feet long, and the Chincholi and Lamboti quarries large stones for rollers, five feet long and about three feet in diameter. Rubble is taken from quarries about a mile from Sholapur, the best of which is owned by one Bhau Ghongade. In B\u00e1rsi trap stones four to six feet long are brought ten to eighteen miles from Gh\u00e1ripuri, Mohol, Ropla, and Shelgaon. The building stone used in the town of B\u00e1rsi is brought from V\u00e1di three miles north-west of B\u00e1rsi and is mostly of small size. Within sixteen miles of Pandharpur are quarries of good black hard stone at B\u00e1bulgaon, Bhalvani, Gursal, Korti, and Penur, and in the hills which form the southern boundary of the S\u00e1ngola sub-division in the south-west of the district. Some of these quarries yield stone of any size. Except a few Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the stonecutters and quarrymen are Vaddars who always work by contract and earn 1s. 6d. to 2s. (Re. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) - 1) a day. The cost varies greatly according to the size, the quantity taken, and the season of the year. At the quarries rubble generally costs 2s. to 3s. (Rs. 1 - 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)) the hundred cubic feet.\n\nRoad metal is commonly made from the boulders which strew the murum plains in various parts of the district. At Sholapur it is chiefly taken from quarries, and at the quarry it costs 7s. to 8s. (Rs. 3\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) - 4) the hundred cubic feet.\n\nSholapur houses are generally built with flat roofs covered either with lime or mud. In mud-roofed houses layers of brick are laid over the planking and are covered with the white earth which is found in almost every village, or with karal a kind of sandy oily loam. A few years ago the Government offices were the only tiled buildings in Sholapur, but of late people have begun to use tiles. In some cases they use the flat local tile and the round tile together, the round tile being laid on the top of the flat tile to prevent leakage through the joints. Clay fit for making bricks and tiles is found near many stream and river banks. The tiles cost 8s. to 12s. (Rs. 4-6), and the bricks, which are generally rough and brittle, cost 12s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 6-12) the thousand.\nIn the Sholapur sub-division at Bh\u00e1nddarkavtha, Halgur, Telgaon, Venchur, and several other places small quantities of b\u00e1bhul wood charcoal are made. At Sholapur charcoal sells at \\( \\frac{3}{2}d. \\) the pound (Rs. 25 the khandi) and at Pandharpur and B\u00e1rsi at \\( \\frac{9}{2}d. \\) the pound (Rs. 17-20 the khandi). Charcoal is largely imported from the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kolh\u00e1pur states of Jamkhandi, Miraj, and S\u00e1ngli. As it is safe from the attacks of white ants and other insects, the wood of the nim, Azadirachta indica, is largely used for building. Its light yellow colour deepens with age. Besides as fuel and in making carts, sugarcane mills, ploughs, and other field tools, b\u00e1bhul wood is largely used for building. It is of a deep reddish colour and is very lasting. For building purposes nim and b\u00e1bhul wood sell at nearly the same rates 4s. to 5s. (Rs. 2-2\u00bd) the cubic foot; as fuel b\u00e1bhul wood sells at \\( \\frac{3}{2}d. \\) to \\( \\frac{9}{2}d. \\) the pound (Rs. 6-12 the khandi).\n\nThe dry shallow soiled uplands of Sholapur are ill suited for trees. The present (1883) area reserved for forests is 242 square miles or about 5.35 per cent of the whole area of the district. The forest area is much scattered. It may be roughly divided into two tracts of forest land, on the hills between B\u00e1rsi and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territories in the extreme north-east and on the hills to the south of M\u00e1lsiras and S\u00e1ngola in the extreme south-west. Before December 1871, when forest conservancy was introduced, Sholapur was extremely bare of trees and brushwood. Almost the whole land was taken for tillage. Before the great spread of tillage, which dates from about 1860, B\u00e1rsi M\u00e1lsiras and S\u00e1ngola had large tracts of scrub forest chiefly khair Acacia catechu, and nim Azadirachta indica, and in the valleys of the Bhima and the Sina were considerable areas under the b\u00e1bhul, the bor Zizyphus jujuba, and the nim Azadirachta indica. In December 1871 two square miles of scattered grass land or kurans were handed to the forest department. During the twelve years ending 1883 these two miles have spread to 242 square miles. Advantage was taken of the shrinking of tillage which followed the 1876 famine to take for forest about 111,150 acres or 173\u00be square miles of arable land. Of these, 23,900 acres were in Sholapur, 42,150 in Karm\u00e1l\u00e1, 24,500 in M\u00e1dha, 1300 in Pandharpur, 7150 in M\u00e1lsiras, 12,150 in S\u00e1ngola, and none in B\u00e1rsi. The rest has chiefly been taken from meadows or kurans, and from village grazing lands or g\u00e1yr\u00e1n\u00e1s.\n\nIn 1872, at the beginning of forest conservancy, the Sholapur forest lands were placed in charge of a forest inspector under the district forest officer of Poona. In 1876 the forest inspector gave place to a sub-assistant conservator. At present (1882-83) the forests are under the charge of an assistant conservator or district forest officer, seven rangers, seven round guards, and eighty-seven beat guards, together with an office establishment of one sheristed\u00e1r or head clerk, and three messengers. In 1882-83 the total yearly cost of this staff was \u00a31406 8s. (Rs.14,064).\n\nBetween 1872 and 1878 no great additions were made to the forest area. Since then large areas have been almost continuously taken for forest, and the lands of the Sholapur and Karm\u00e1l\u00e1 subdivisions have\nbeen demarcated, and those of the B\u00e1rsi M\u00e1dha and M\u00e1liras subdivisions have been both demarcated and settled. In the Pandharpur and S\u00e1ngola sub-divisions the lands of those villages which are not under the command of the Mhasvad and Ashti reservoirs, have been demarcated; the lands of the remaining villages will be demarcated as soon as it is known what parts of these villages are not commanded by the reservoirs.\n\nThe whole of the Shol\u00e1pur forest area is reserved that is no timber-cutting rights are admitted to exist within forest limits. In these reserves, where they have been found to exist before the lands are brought under reserve, the rights of having periodical gatherings at shrines within forest limits, of using the water for village cattle, and of passing along the existing foot bullock and cart tracks have been admitted. In 1882-83 of the 242 square miles of forest land 102 have been reserved and 140 were proposed for reserve. Of 756 state or kh\u00e1lsa and fifty-five part-alienated or dhum\u00e1la villages 351 state villages have forest reserves. Of these, eighty-four villages out of a total of 152 are in Shol\u00e1pur, fifteen out of 123 are in B\u00e1rsi, sixty-four out of eighty-nine are in M\u00e1dha, eighty-five out of 123 are in Karm\u00e1la, twenty-nine out of eighty-five are in Pandharpur, thirty-eight out of sixty-nine are in M\u00e1liras, and thirty-six out of seventy-five are in S\u00e1ngola. In about one-third of the remaining 310 state villages reserves cannot be formed as no waste land is available; in the remaining two-third villages the formation of reserves will depend on the orders of Government. Of the total area of 154,840 acres or about 242 square miles, 32,573 acres are in Shol\u00e1pur, 8032 in B\u00e1rsi, 43,495 in Karm\u00e1la, 27,503 in M\u00e1dha, 2066 in Pandharpur, 21,826 in M\u00e1liras, and 19,845 in S\u00e1ngola. The forest lands are of two classes, scrub forest and b\u00e1bhul meadows. The scrub forest is found on the hills of B\u00e1rsi, M\u00e1liras, and S\u00e1ngola, and the b\u00e1bhul meadows occur all over the district. Of the total area 24,885 acres are scrub forest and 129,955 acres are b\u00e1bhul meadows. The blocks of scrub forest vary from six to 3000 acres and the b\u00e1bhul meadows or kurans from six to 200 acres. In the scrub forests the chief trees are the kh\u00e1ir Acacia catechu, and nim Azadirachta indica, with a young growth of \u00e1pta Bauhinia racemosa, b\u00e1bhul Acacia arabica, bor Zizyphus jujuba, dh\u00e1vda Conocarpus latifolia, guti Zizyphus xylopyra, h\u00edvar Acacia leucophloea, kinai Acacia procera, l\u00fatye Acacia amora, medshing Spathodea falcata, murmut Acacia eliunea, pair Ficus cardifolia, r\u00e1n-bor Zizyphus mummularia, salai Boswellia thurifera, shikuk\u00e1i Acacia concinna, s\u00edras Acacia odoratissima, temru Diospyrus montana, turan Zizyphus rugosa, and umbar Ficus glomerata. In the b\u00e1bhul meadows the chief trees are the b\u00e1bhul Acacia arabica, the bor Zizyphus jujuba, the j\u00e1mbhul Syzigium jambolanum, and the nim Azadirachta indica. The best b\u00e1bhul meadows are in sandy soil, the next best on black soil, and the worst on shallow broken earth overlying murum.\n\n1 The details are: Of scrub forest 7621 acres lie in B\u00e1rsi, 10,051 in M\u00e1liras, and 7213 in S\u00e1ngola, and of b\u00e1bhul meadows 32,573 acres lie in Shol\u00e1pur, 411 in B\u00e1rsi, 43,495 in Karm\u00e1la, 27,503 in M\u00e1dha, 2066 in Pandharpur, 11,275 in M\u00e1liras, and 12,632 in S\u00e1ngola.\nThe forest lands have little timber fit for cutting. In Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, M\u00e1cha, and Pandharpur about 186 tons (534 khandis) of firewood, and in Pandharpur about forty large b\u00e1bhul and nim trees are yearly felled for local use. The woodcutters are Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Mh\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Seven hundredweights (1 khandi) of firewood cost 6d. to 9d. (4-6 as.) to fell, and sell at 2s. to 3s. (Rs. 1 - 1\u00bd) in the forest reserves. The forty timber trees cost about \u00a32 (Rs. 20) to fell and sell at \u00a317 10s. (Rs. 175). The timber is locally used in making carts and house beams. The timber-dealers are chiefly V\u00e1nis and Musalm\u00e1ns. Besides selling local b\u00e1bhul, bor, and nim wood, which are largely used even in the better class of buildings, the timber-dealers import teak and kenjal or Terminalia aluta from the Poona and Nagar Sahay\u00e1dris either by rail or floated down the Bhima and Sina. The large teakwood spars for beams comes from Bombay by train. At Shol\u00e1pur a species of shevri Bombax malabaricum which grows like a pole with no branches to a height of about twenty-five feet and has a diameter of nine to twelve inches at the base, is much used as rafters in house and bungalow roofs.\n\nForest receipts are comparatively small. During the eleven years ending 1882-83 receipts have risen from \u00a3274 (Rs. 2740) in 1872-73 to \u00a3829 (Rs. 8290) in 1882-83. During the first four years receipts rose from \u00a3274 (Rs. 2740) in 1872-73 to \u00a3404 (Rs. 4040) in 1875-76; during the next three years owing to the famine they fell from \u00a3404 (Rs. 4040) in 1875-76 to \u00a3264 (Rs. 2640) in 1878-79; and during the last four years they again rose from \u00a3264 (Rs. 2640) in 1878-79 to \u00a3829 (Rs. 8290) in 1882-83. During the eleven years ending 1882-83 the expenditure has risen from \u00a3230 (Rs. 2300) in 1872-73 to \u00a32021 (Rs. 20,210) in 1882-83.\n\nShol\u00e1pur Forest Receipts, 1872-73-1882-83.\n\n| Year | Receipts | Charges |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1872-73 | 274 | 259 |\n| 1873-74 | 354 | 179 |\n| 1874-75 | 351 | 150 |\n| 1875-76 | 404 | 128 |\n| 1876-77 | 370 | 286 |\n| 1877-78 | 260 | 439 |\n| 1878-79 | 264 | 776 |\n| 1879-80 | 301 | 1258 |\n| 1880-81 | 511 | 1961 |\n| 1881-82 | 704 | 2215 |\n| 1882-83 | 829 | 2021 |\n\nOf the whole 242 square miles of forest land about one-fifth is yearly sold for grazing. In the remaining four-fifths, which are yearly sold for grass-cutting, plantations are formed according to six systems; full ploughing, furrow ploughing, sowing by drill, sowing in pits, dibbling, and broadcasting. During the seven years ending 1883-84, 1152 acres were planted by full ploughing, 551 by furrow ploughing, 11,828 by sowing in pits, 1874 by dibbling, and 92,555 by broadcasting. By sowing by the drill which was introduced in 1883, 157 acres were planted. Most of the broadcast sowing is done on the hill slopes of the B\u00e1rsi and M\u00e1lsiras sub-divisions, where trees have rapidly grown. Of the six systems of planting the broadcasting is the cheapest and is fairly successful; the full ploughing though more successful than the broadcasting is much more costly. As it is both cheap and successful, sowing by the drill will probably supersede all systems except broadcasting. Besides for fuel the\ntimber of the *babhul* Acacia arabica and the *nim* Azadirachta indica are used in making beams, posts, doors, carts, ploughs, and other field tools. The bark of the *babhul* Acacia arabica and the *tarvad* Cassia auriculata is used for tanning, and their pods as well as the flowers of the *palas* Butea frondosa are used in dyeing. The bark of the *apta* Bauhinia racemosa is made into ropes.\n\nThe chief Sholapur trees are: *Ain* Terminalia tomentosa, *amba* Mangifera indica the Mango, *anjan* Memecylon tinctorium, *anjir* Ficus carica the Fig, *apta* Bauhinia racemosa, *ashok* Jonesia asoca, *\u00e1vla* Phyllanthus emblica, *babhul* Acacia arabica, *bakul* Mimusops elengi, *bel* \u00c6gle marmelos, *bor* Zizyphus jujuba, *chandan* Santalum album the Sandal, *chilh\u00e1ri* C\u00e6salpinia sepiaria, *chinch* Tamarindus indicus the Tamarind, *d\u00e1limb* Punica granatum the Pomegranate, *dh\u00e1vda* Anogeissus latifolia, *dikemali* Gardenia lucida, *erand* Ricinus communis, *gindhan* Cordia rothii, *hingan* Balanites \u00e6gyptiaca, *hivar* Acacia leucophlo\u0153a, *jamb* Eugenia jambos the Rose-Apple, *jambhul* Syzygium jambolanum, *karanj* Pongamia glabra, *karvand* Carissa carandas, *kavath* Feronia elephantum the Wood-Apple, *khair* Acacia catechu, *limb* Azadirachta indica the Indian Lilac, *limb\u00e1ra* Heynea trijuga, *medshing* Spathodea falcata, *mendhi* Lawsonia intermis, *moha* Bassia latifolia, *nandruk* Ficus retusa, *n\u00e1ral* Cocos nucifera the Cocoa-Palm, *nimbu* Bitens limmoun the Lemon, *palas* Butea frondosa, *p\u00e1nya* Erythrina indica, *p\u00e1rsaa* pimpal Hibiscus populneoides, *pimpal* Ficus religiosa, *pimp\u00e1r* Ficus comosa, *r\u00e1mphal* Anona reticulata the Bullock's Heart, *r\u00e1nbor* Zizyphus vulgaris, *ritha* Sapindus emarginatus, *s\u00e1g* Tectona grandis the Teak, *salai* Boswellia thurifera, *saundad* Prosopis spicigera, *shevga* Moringa pterygosperma, *shevri* Bombax malabaricum the Silk-cotton, *shindi* Ph\u0153nix sylvestris, *shiras* Albizzia odoratissima, *sit\u00faphal* Anona squamosa the Custard-Apple, *sontarvad* Pomcina pulcherrima, *sup\u00e1ri* Areca catechu the Betel-Palm, *t\u00e1d* Borassus flabelliformis the Palmyra-Palm; *tart\u00ed* Capparis rythocarpus, *tarvad* Cassia auriculata, *umbar* Ficus glomerata, and *vad* Ficus indica the Banyan tree.\n\nIn 1882-83 the stock returns showed 192,733 oxen, 101,318 cows, 55,523 buffaloes, 10,292 ponies, 418,240 sheep, 6807 goats, 4480 asses, and 40 camels. Exclusive of ponies sheep goats and asses, the returns give an average of 510 head of cattle to each village. In the Sholapur district large grass lands or *kurans* are few, and are either private or mixed with forest land. Throughout the year the village cattle, except the plough bullocks, are generally sent every day about eight in the morning to graze in waste or *padit* numbers and are brought back to the cattle sheds in the evening by boys paid to attend them. During the five months ending in November the cattle generally have excellent fodder, improve greatly in health, and make up what they lose in the hot season. During December and January the cattle are fed on millet stalks or *kadbi*.\n\n---\n\n1 The description and use of these trees given in the Poona Statistical Account apply to Sholapur.\nDuring the remaining four or five months from March to June the village cattle suffer much from want of fodder, and grow weak and thin. In these months as the fields are empty, the cattle find little fodder outside of the house. At home the allowance is generally very scanty\u2014a bundle or two of millet stalks a head. Every morning and evening the cows and she-buffaloes are milked, and after meeting local wants, the milk is made into clarified butter.\n\nOxen, returned at 192,733, are of six breeds khil\u00e1ri raised by Dhangers of that name, deshi or local, lam\u00e1ni or Lam\u00e1n\u00ed cattle, m\u00e1li from M\u00e1lvi, sorti from Gujar\u00e1t and gok\u00e1ki from Gok\u00e1l in Belgaum. The khil\u00e1ri bullocks are the best and the local the commonest. The khil\u00e1ri bullocks are largely found in the state of Jath and the \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division of the Pant Pratinidhi's state to the south and south-west of Shol\u00e1pur. They are stout, hardy and well-made mostly of one bright colour, with straight horns red eyes, and somewhat fierce look, and an ill temper. As they cost as much as \u00a310 to \u00a330 (Rs. 100 - 300) the pair only the rich can afford khil\u00e1ri bullocks. The local bullocks are mostly home-bred and are quiet and tame. Though equally lasting and patient, the local bullock is inferior to the khil\u00e1ri bullock in strength and beauty. In the plough and in the cart one pair of khil\u00e1ris will do as much as two pairs of local bullocks. In colour the local breed is more mixed and less bright than the khil\u00e1ri breed. They are much cheaper costing \u00a34 to \u00a310 (Rs. 40 - 100) the pair. The four remaining breeds are rare. The lam\u00e1ni is valued for its size and appearance, the m\u00e1li is a larger species of lam\u00e1ni, and the sorti and gok\u00e1ki are admired for their heads. The gok\u00e1ki bullocks are better suited for carting than ploughing. The bullocks are usually owned by husbandmen who use them chiefly in the field. Plough and cart bullocks are never sent to graze with the village herd. During about ten months in the year, from April to February bullocks have constant work. For about eight months, from July to February, a well-to-do husbandman, who has enough lands to raise crops in rotation, can supply his bullocks every day with fresh fodder. In July and early August the husbandman feeds them on the fresh stalks of the hundi or eighty days' ju\u00e1ri; in late August September October and November on fresh grass, which, under the care of a young boy, the working bullocks are allowed to graze three hours every morning; in December January and part of February he feeds them on the green fodder of the early and late crops. During March April May and June the bullocks are given dry, stale, and unnourishing fodder. To keep them in strength during these dry months working bullocks are also given corn and oil-cakes. From March to May the poorer husbandmen who have not much field work take to carting. As Shol\u00e1pur is the trade centre for the Niz\u00e1m's dominions in the north and north-east and the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak in the south a large traffic chiefly in cotton and wheat giving constant work to carts, finds its way through and out of the district. Carting pays well and enables both the husbandmen and the bullocks to pass comfortably through the hot season and to return to field work in good strength. In an ordinary year the keep of a bullock costs little\nEven during the hot season a pair does not cost more than 10s. (Rs. 5) a month. Besides this, if in regular carting work, bullocks cost 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) a month for oil cakes or pend and 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) for millet stalks or kadbi and other fodder. No special care is given to bullock breeding. Bullocks begin to work when four years old. They are first yoked to the lightest field tool the kulav or harrow, then to the plough or n\u00e1ngar, and lastly to the mot or leather bag which takes more out of a bullock than any other work. The kulav generally requires two bullocks to draw, the plough, which runs six to twelve inches below the surface, requires six to eight bullocks, the water-bag two to eight bullocks, and the cart two bullocks. About 1000 pounds is the heaviest load one pair of bullocks can draw in a cart. As the district is generally flat, good roads have lately been made and carts have almost entirely taken the place of packs. A few pack-bullocks are used by T\u00e1mbolis or betel-sellers, Manyars or hardware dealers, and other petty traders. A bullock seldom lives more than twenty-five years. About twenty they become unfit for work. Then the poor generally sell them to the butcher, and the well-to-do keep them at home till they die. The great bullock festival is Pola or Ox Day which in Shol\u00e1pur falls on the thirtieth day of Shr\u00e1van or July-August. On this day bullocks are well washed, gaily dressed, and richly fed, and in the evening they are taken to the village deity with much show and music.\n\nCows returned at 101,318 are mostly of local breed. The cows are all sent to graze daily with the village herd. At home milch cows get a little fodder at night and again in the early morning. Cows not in milk, get no fodder till the month of Paush or January-February. From February to June, as the fodder in the grazing lands becomes scarcer, the cow\u2019s daily allowance of grass is each month raised by one bundle. At this rate in May and June they get five bundles a day. In these months cows look lean and miserable. A good cow costs \u00a33 to \u00a34 (Rs. 30-40) and an ordinary cow \u00a31 to \u00a32 (Rs. 10-20). When about four years old, the cow begins to bear, and continues to bear every year for ten or twelve years. At sixteen she generally becomes barren and is left to herd with other cattle. As she gets little help from her owner, except a handful of millet stalks or kadbi and rice chaff or bhusa, she soon loses strength and dies after two or three years. For a day or two after calving a cow is generally fed on Indian millet or j\u00fa\u00e1ri. To increase her milk the well-to-do give her for a week khir or boiled wheat and the poor give ghugri that is bajri boiled unsplit and unhusked. Along with the khir or the ghugri four tonics or mas\u00e1l\u00e1s are mixed, catechu k\u00e1th, aloes bol, rock-salt saindhav, and sweet fennel badishep. Cows are milked twice a day in the morning and in the evening; only half the milk is taken, the rest being left for the calf. At each milking a good cow gives about six pints (3 sher) of milk and an ordinary cow three pints (1\u00bd sher). Two months after calving the supply of milk falls off about a third, and, in the fifth and sixth months, about two-thirds. At about eight months after calving the milk ceases. Of the two chief products of the cow husbandmen care more for the calves and other classes for the milk, by whom cow\u2019s milk is specially valued as the most wholesome food.\nfor children. To husbandmen who have nothing to pay for grass, a cow in milk costs about 2s. (Rs. 1) a month for corn and oil-cakes; to others, who have to pay for grass, she costs about 4s. (Rs. 2) in villages and 8s. (Rs. 4) in towns. All Shol\u00e1pur Hindus except the lowest hold the cow sacred. To promise holding the tail of a cow is the most binding Hindu oath. The cow is also considered to represent the earth. As it is a sin to sell a cow, when a Br\u00e1hman wishes to dispose of one he exchanges it for some other animal.\n\nBuffaloes are returned at 55,523, of which 18,739 are he and 36,784 are she-buffaloes. During the day both he and she-buffaloes are sent to graze with the village herd. He-buffaloes are generally used for draught and field work and she-buffaloes for milk. Their dullness and slowness make he-buffaloes unpopular. Few except the poor own them. Watermen or Bhistis use them in carrying water skins, Mh\u00e1rs in carrying fuel and timber, and poor husbandmen in carrying millet stalks and other field produce. As they are neglected from infancy few he-buffaloes are well formed. The specially strong and well made, which are kept for breeding, fetch about \u00a37 10s. (Rs. 75); the others fetch \u00a31 to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 10-25). They are chiefly bought by Devaru Gos\u00e1vis who sell them in the Konkan at a good profit. She-buffaloes are of two breeds gavli or milkman\u2019s and deshi or local. The gavli\u2019s or milkman\u2019s she-buffaloes have long horns and are of a deep black colour; the deshis have short horns and are of a dirty colour. Well-to-do husbandmen keep one or two and Gavlis keep herds of she-buffaloes. When about four years old, a she-buffalo begins to calve, and continues to bear once every year. She generally turns barren at fifteen and dies at twenty. She-buffaloes are milked twice a day in the morning and in the evening. They give more milk than cows. A first class gavli she-buffalo gives eight to sixteen pints (4-8 shers) at each milking. As it gives more butter than the cow\u2019s milk, the she-buffalo\u2019s milk is much valued, and sells at twenty-four pints (12 shers) the rupee. A deshi she-buffalo costs \u00a32 to \u00a35 (Rs. 20-50); a gavli she-buffalo not less than \u00a38 (Rs. 80) and sometimes as much as \u00a315 (Rs. 150). She-buffaloes are better fed than cows and cost about twice as much to keep. In towns a good she-buffalo yielding twelve pints (6 shers) at a milking costs \u00a31 to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 10-12) a month to keep, and an ordinary she-buffalo costs 12s. (Rs. 6). In villages the cost of keeping is about three quarters less. The skins of buffaloes are specially valued as they are used in making mots or leather water-bags.\n\nPonies, returned at 10,292, are rarely more than twelve hands high. Shol\u00e1pur is not now a good district for ponies\u00b9. The 1876 famine and the 1879 Afgh\u00e1n war greatly reduced the number\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Broughton (1808, Letters Written in a Mar\u00e1tha Camp, 44-46) writes of the Deccan horse. They are held in the highest esteem by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They are bred from Arabs with the mares of the country which are very small. The Deccanis are seldom above fourteen and a half hands high and the best are often less. They are short in the barrel and neck; have small well-shaped heads and slim remarkably well formed limbs; they have generous tempers and are full of spirit, and are said to be able to bear more fatigue than any horses in India. \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 (Rs. 3000 to Rs. 4000) is often paid for a Deccani,\nof good animals. In the large towns of Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, and Pandharpur, they are used both for riding and driving. The Government stud horses kept at S\u00e1ngola are largely used and raise a good class of animal. On the 31st March 1883, in the Government stud at S\u00e1ngli were two very good Arab stallions. In 1882-83 the number of branded mares was eighteen and sixty-nine mares were covered; the average yearly cost of keep for each stud horse was about \u00a323 (Rs. 230). An ordinary pony fetches \u00a31 to \u00a33 (Rs. 10 - 30), and a good pony \u00a35 to \u00a310 (Rs. 50 - 100). The ordinary ponies are badly cared for, being left to graze where they can. The better ponies are fed on fresh grass and millet stalks and are also given gram or other pulse. A good pony costs 4s. to 16s. (Rs. 2 - 8) a month to keep. During the three Pandharpur fairs in Chaitra or April, Ash\u00e1d or July, and K\u00e1r\u00edk or November a large number of ponies are yearly brought for sale.\n\nSheep and Goats are returned at 425,047, of which 418,240 are sheep and 6807 goats. More than half the district, especially the three southern sub-divisions, M\u00e1l\u00edsiras S\u00e1ngola and Pandharpur, with their dry whitish-soiled grazing plains are specially suited for rearing sheep and goats. In these southern grazing lands are large numbers of Dhangars or shepherds and Sangars or blanket weavers. Every flock of a hundred sheep requires one man to look after them. Every morning they are taken to the plains to graze and are brought home in the evening. When starting with his flock, the shepherd takes with him a long rough stick to knock the pods off the b\u00e1bhul trees. To help him in guarding the flock from the attacks of wolves every shepherd is accompanied by a dog. Every flock of sheep has also two or three goats to lead them to the grazing lands. At night the sheep are sheltered in pens or mendh\u00e1v\u00e9d\u00e1s, outside of the village close together in one line. They are fenced all round with thorns except a narrow opening which at night is closed by a door of thorns. A sheep costs 5s. to 6s. (Rs. 2\u00bd - 3). Every two years they bear thrice one lamb at a time. Sheep are reared more for their wool than for their milk. Twice every year, in March and again in July, their wool is cut. If black, it is sold to Sangars or blanket weavers at 6d. a pound (2\u00bd shers the rupee) and of mixed black and white at 5d. a pound (2\u00bd shers the rupee). At each shearing 100 fleeces are worth about \u00a31 (Rs. 10) that is about \u00a32 (Rs. 20) a year. To keep a flock of 100 sheep costs about \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) a year for grass and \u00a35 (Rs. 50) for a man to look after them; that is a yearly cost of about 1s. 6d. (12 as.) a head. Sheep\u2019s dung is much valued for field manure, but as the sheep-owners are generally well-to-do landholders, they use it in their own garden lands and seldom either sell it or pen their sheep in other men\u2019s lands. The bulk of the people eat mutton, but few of them can afford it except on great days. Rams with twisted horns, called edk\u00e1s, are much valued for fighting; the strongest fetch as much as \u00a32 (Rs. 20) each. The poorer classes who cannot afford to keep a cow, keep she-goats, chiefly for their milk. In her second year a she-goat generally bears two or three, sometimes one and occasionally as many as four kids. As she mostly lives on tree leaves, a she-goat costs little to keep. A she-goat fetches\n4s. to 12s. (Rs. 2-6) and a he-goat 4s. to 8s. (Rs. 2-4). Goat\u2019s milk is drunk in spleen and liver complaints, and is rubbed on the hands and feet to cure sleeplessness.\n\nAsses, returned at 4480, are kept as beasts of burden by Beld\u00e1rs or quarrymen and Kumbh\u00e1rs or potters. They carry a load of about 128 pounds (4 mans). An ass costs about \u00a31 (Rs. 10) to buy and almost nothing to keep as they are left to pick what they can. Asses\u2019 milk is sometimes given to weak children. Camels, returned at forty-two, are kept by Musalm\u00e1n traders to carry loads. They are not reared in the district and vary in price from \u00a34 to \u00a310 (Rs. 40-100). Pigs returned at 180, are kept and eaten by Vaddars or earth workers. There are two varieties of dog, the common smooth-haired village dog and a long-haired shepherd\u2019s dog, a fierce and brave animal, which is kept by Dhangars and sometimes by husbandmen.\n\nFowls are reared by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Musalm\u00e1ns, Mh\u00e1rs, and M\u00e1ngs. Two varieties of fowl are reared the small local or deshi and the larger kalam, that is big bird also known as surti because apparently imported through Surat. Of the common fowl the black-boned and the ruffle-feathered are found in Shol\u00e1pur, and the ruffle-feathered is unusually common. Fowls are eaten on holidays by the low caste poor Hindus and sacrificed to gods in fulfilment of vows. The price of a hen varies from 1s. (8 as.) in towns to 6d. (4 as.) in the country parts. A hen lays forty to eighty eggs in a year. She does not go on laying at regular intervals, but has fits of laying, which last ten to twelve days and are separated by intervals of four to six weeks. In Shol\u00e1pur and other large towns eggs are sold at 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) the dozen, and in villages at about 2\u00bdd. (1\u00bd as.)\n\nThe treeless plains of Shol\u00e1pur have no cover deep enough for tigers, panthers, or bears. The Wolf l\u00e1ndga Canis pallipes, is found throughout the district, and has greatly increased in numbers since so large an area has been set apart as forest land. The Jackal, kolha Canis aureus and the Grey Fox khokad or lomri Vulpes bengalensis, are common everywhere. The Wild Boar dukar Sus indicus is common, specially in Karm\u00e1la. About twenty-five years ago Karm\u00e1la was the favourite meeting place of the Deccan hunt. The spread of tillage afterwards made wild pig scarce, but of late they have again rapidly increased. Of Deer the only species are the Indian Antelope or haran and the Ravine Deer or chik\u00e1ra. The 1876-77 famine greatly reduced the number of antelope. Ravine deer are rare. The Alligator susar Crocodilus palustris, is fairly common in both the Bhima and Sina. Of smaller animals the Hare sassa is very common. The Ape v\u00e1nar Presbytis entellus is occasionally seen. In 1882 an Otter p\u00e1n m\u00e1\u00f1jar Lutra nair, was killed on the Ekruk lake about five miles north of Shol\u00e1pur.\n\n1 The Bhima, Nira, M\u00e1n, and Sina and the larger reservoirs and ponds are fished almost throughout the year. During the rains most of the streams are full of fish, but during the dry season fish\n\n---\n\n1 From materials supplied by Mr. Sh\u00e1nt\u00e1ram Vin\u00e1yak Kantak.\nare found only in pools or dohs. In Shol\u00e1pur there is little large demand for fish. In 1881-82 the right of fishing the Ekruk lake close to the city of Shol\u00e1pur fetched only \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 24). Besides at the Ekruk lake, the only other restrictions on fishing in Shol\u00e1pur are on the Bhima near Pandharpur where the Br\u00e1hmans object to it, and at M\u00e1chnur about sixteen miles south-east of Pandharpur, where a priest or gurav prevents it. According to the local Bhois or fishermen fish breed between May and the end of September. Except the maral which spawns in the hot weather in deep water, almost all fish breed during the rains, when the waters are swollen and muddy and netting cannot be carried on. The chief fishing classes are Mar\u00e1tha Bhois, K\u00e1che Bhois, Menjage Bhois, and B\u00e1gdi Bhois. Besides these hereditary fishers, Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, Kolis, Kunbis, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Parits, R\u00e1moshis, T\u00e1mbolis, Vaddars, and perhaps all other classes except Br\u00e1hmans, Ling\u00e1yats, V\u00e1nis, and Son\u00e1rs, often catch fish for food. Even among Br\u00e1hmans fishermen are sometimes found. The Br\u00e1hman proprietor or j\u00e1gird\u00e1r of \u00c1mba in Pandharpur, was a keen and successful fisher. Few even of the hereditary fishers live solely by fishing. The Mar\u00e1tha Bhois are perhaps the most persistent fishers and even they, besides catching fish, are husbandmen, litter-bearers, and petty shopkeepers selling parched gram and other grain. The K\u00e1che Bhois fish during the rains, and during the dry season raise river-bed crops of cucumbers, water and musk melons, and brinjals. The Menjage Bhois are a wandering tribe who live in the villages bordering on the M\u00e1n in S\u00e1ngola in the south-west of the district and in Pandharpur. They go from village to village begging and playing on a tabor or daur. They tie small wooden ploughs round their necks and bind iron chains round their wrists. They are followed by their women and beg in plaintive tones, praying for money as Government have fined them and they must collect the amount. Though they beg Menjage Bhois are fairly off and carry on a large trade in he-buffaloes. They bring flocks of he-buffaloes from Kh\u00e1ndesh and M\u00e1lwa and sell them in Southern India where they are much used in field work. B\u00e1gdi Bhois are also wanderers who, during the dry season, move from village to village, live outside of the village, and earn a living by darning country blankets. They carry big nets and catch fish wherever they have a chance. Of late the Bhois seem to have found that their indiscriminate fishing is reducing the stock of fish. In a caste meeting held in 1882, they passed a rule forbidding maral fishing between April and June, when the maral are believed to breed. Any Bhoi, who breaks this rule, is fined 5s. (Rs.2\u00bd) for each offence. Bhois are feared as magicians. Some of them are believed to have power to keep fish out of their neighbours' nets and force them into their own. Angling is dangerous as to destroy the angler evil spirits sometimes take the bait in the form of a fish. From this danger the Bhois' net is free because as the Bhoi makes his net at all hours of the day some meshes must be knotted at such lucky moments as to make the net fiend-proof.\n\nFish are generally caught in one of three ways, in basket traps, in bag-nets, and by poisoning pools. In catching fish most Bhois,\nespecially Mar\u00e1tha Bhois use nets, and the Kolis the hook and line. Other classes use basket traps or poison pools. The basket trap is set almost upright at the foot of a rapid or waterfall and left for the whole night. Hardly any fish that gets into a basket trap can escape. In poisoning pools the juice of the leaves of the *hingan* Balanites \u00e6gyptiaca, and the milk of the milkbush are used. In both cases the leaves and tender branches are ground into pulp and mixed with the water of the pool. Ten nets are used in Shol\u00e1pur. Of these three are plunge-nets or *pagirs*, the *sarki*, *savki*, and *kaner*; three are drag-nets, the *pandi*, *mirache-j\u00e1le*, and *pharak-j\u00e1le*; and four are stationary nets the *khavri*, *tatti*, *botki*, and *bhuse* or *kand\u00e1le*. Of the plunge nets the *sarki* and *savki* are used by Mar\u00e1tha Bhois and the *botki* and of the stationary nets the *bhuse* or *kand\u00e1le* are used by B\u00e1gi Bhois. Of the plunge nets the *sarki* is a heavy casting net of strong cord with meshes three or four inches wide. It is worked or drawn mouth foremost. A cord, passing through its meshes at the outer diameter, is drawn through a mouth which makes the inner diameter and is pulled turning the net into a bag. Unless when the Bhoi sees a fish in deep water and throws the net over it, the *sarki* is used only in low water and in the dry season. Fish ten to twelve pounds in weight are often caught in this net. The *savki*, five to ten feet square, is conical in shape, and has small meshes of fine cord. All round inside the rim it has pockets and lead-sinks along the rim. It is used in muddy water at all times of the year. The *kaner* differs little from the *savki* except that its meshes are larger about half an inch wide. Of the drag-nets the *pandi* is used in water, six to seven feet deep and as much wide. Its length varies with the breadth of the stream. Its meshes are about three-fourths of an inch wide. A cord passed along the upper edge of the net is held on both banks by two or more men who either wade or float. The bottom of the net is dragged along the bottom of the stream and has pockets and lead sinks. This net is used in muddy water, chiefly during the rains. The *mirache-j\u00e1le* is like the *pandi* except that it is heavier and requires ten to fifteen men to work it. It is eight to ten feet wide and often more than fifty feet long. Its meshes are about half an inch wide. It has no lead-sinks and has only one pocket in the middle of the lower margin. Two cords, of which one passes through the meshes of the upper margin and the other through those of the lower margin, are tied to two poles held upright one on each bank, and the poles are carried along the banks, keeping the net at the stretch. This net is used in December and January. The *pharak-j\u00e1le* is conical in shape and is worked by two men. Its mesh is three-fourths of an inch. It has pockets all round and pieces of lead tied to the lower margin. To keep it tight dry gourd floats are tied along the upper edge. This net may be either dragged along the bottom by two men or worked as a plunge-net. It is used in the dry season in shallow water. Of the stationary nets which are set for a night or for twenty-four hours the *khavri* is a bag-net used in three to three and a half feet of water. It is left all night. It is funnel-shaped and at the mouth is several feet in diameter. The net is set with the mouth against the current kept open by two post.\none on either side. The water rushes through the mouth and the fish passes through a ring which has a net-septum with a small hole in the centre. As the net-septum of the ring prevents it from returning, the fish is caught in the further end of the funnel which is tied. In the morning the fisherman comes, opens the lower end, empties the bag, ties the end, and again sets the net. Like the basket trap the tatt\u00ed is set almost upright at the foot of a waterfall and left for the whole night. The botki is two or three feet wide and of varying length and fine meshes. It has no pockets. To weight it down pieces of tiles are tied at the bottom and to make it float pieces of dry gourd or light reed are tied along its upper margin. The net is kept floating erect across a shallow stream. One or two men go ahead and splash the water, making it muddy. The fish are frightened and rush headlong into the net. It is chiefly used in catching small fish in low water during the dry season. The bhuse or kand\u00e1le differs little from the botki except that it is wider and has larger meshes. Besides these nets the ghile or pelmi is a net tied to a triangular frame of bamboos and is used in much the same way as the European shrimping net. Besides by basket traps, by bag-nets, and by poisoning the water, fish are caught in two other ways. One way is to put under water an earthen pot with bread in it. A man stands by watching. As soon as a fish enters the pot, he throws a piece of cloth over the mouth of the pot and lifts it out of the water. This answers only in shallow streams. In the other device which is called vetha, a cord twenty-five to thirty feet long is decked with branches of nim twigs, one or two inches apart. Two men go to the water side each taking one end of the cord. One man stands on the bank and the other goes waist-deep into the water. Then both move down the stream slowly dragging the cord along the bottom and starting the fish who swim in front. The man in the water goes a little faster than the man on shore till they come to a place where two other men are standing by the water edge each holding one end of a waistcloth about fifteen feet long. The waistcloth is held open and is stretched a few inches above the surface of the water with a slight slope towards the direction from which the men with the string come. When they draw near the cloth the men with the string of nim tufts splash the water, and the frightened fish leap out of the water and are caught on the cloth. Flat stones three to four inches long are sometimes used instead of nim tufts. This device is peculiar to the Kolis. It answers only when the water is low.\n\nExcept by Br\u00e1hmans Ling\u00e1yats, V\u00e1nis, M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris, and P\u00e1nch\u00e1l Son\u00e1rs fish are eaten by almost all classes. The Bhois believe that pills made of flour mixed with the slime on the body of the ahir Anguilla bengalensis, especially if made up on a Saturday, cure impotency. These pills fetch a considerable price in the Pandharpur market. The stone found in the brain of the maral Ophiocelalus marulius is believed to cure blindness, and a clove kept in the gall-bladder of the t\u00e1mlda Labeo fimbriatus to cure cataract.\n\nThe following fish are found in the Bhima near Pandharpur: Alkut or p\u00e1tuchi Chela clupeoides, ahir Anguilla bengalensis, chondgi\nChapter II.\n\nProduction.\n\nFISH.\n\nBarbus ticto, ch\u00e1lat or bhadgi Notopterus kapirat, chikni or mur, of two species, Lepidocephalichthys thermalis with longitudinal dark stripes along the dorsal to the lateral line, dakhu or dokda Ophiocephalus striatus, d\u00e1ndvan or kanheri Rasbora daniconius, g\u00e1nde-chir or jh\u00e1njda Ambassis nama, ghogra Rita pavimentata, gud-dani o tepd\u00ed Rohtee cotio, gugli Callichrous bimaculatus, k\u00e1la gugli Callichrous malabaricus, k\u00e1la shengal Macrones corsula, kanoshi Labecalbasu, kavd\u00e1sha Labeo kawrus, kharpa or khurbi Gobius giuris khudra Barbus neilli, kolashi Barbus kolus, kurdu or kat\u00e1rna Rites hastata, kutra or chit\u00e1ru Belone cancila, l\u00f3li Cirrhina fulugee, mara of two species Ophiocelalus marulius and leucopunctatus, masli Barbus jerdoni, nakta Labeo nukta, p\u00e1gat Barbus dobsoni, phek or gudadu Rohtee vigorsii, pitule or nibar-hadi Barbus sarana, s\u00e1nd Labeo boggut, shengal Macrones seenghala, shing\u00e1ta or sonkat\u00e1rn Macrones cavasius, shivda or varshivda Wallago attu, t\u00e1blda Labecimbriatus, t\u00e1bti or karoti Labeo potail, tharota Bagarius yarrellii v\u00e1m Mustacembalus armatus, and v\u00e1yadi or bat\u00e1si Pseudeutropius taakree. Besides these thirty-eight fish fourteen have been found but not identified: The ambl\u00ed, called piura in Poona, is a small fish not growing more than two to three inches long. It has two pectoral fins and one small dorsal and is red in the fins and in the ventral region. Its body is cream-white. The bobri is a small fish. The g\u00e1gar, called gegar in Poona, is found during the dry weather. The ichna, called ichka or ichki in Poona, is a small fish found only during the rains. It has a pair of pectoral and ventral fins and one dorsal. It has mottled spots on the body and its ossicular rays of the dorsal and pectoral fins are sharp and inflict wounds which cause acute inflammation. The jhinga is a small fish. The jhora called jhivra in Poona, is also a small fish. The k\u00e1vli, called phekin in Poona, grows to about five to six inches and is broad for its length.

It has hair above the lip, a pair of ventral fins and also a dorsal ossicular fin. Its pectoral fins are strong and ossicular. The pargiri or khudra is said to be a small variety of the khudra Barbus neilli. The phol\u00e1ti, a small fish not found in Poona, has two small pectoral fins. The piturdi, a small fish not found in Poona, has a pair of pectoral, ventral, and anal fins and one dorsal fin, and three to four dark cross stripes from the dorsal to the lateral line. The v\u00e1vans is like the khudra but grows much larger. It is not found in Poona. It has two pectoral, two ventral, two anal fins, and one dorsal fin. The valanj, a big fish more than a foot long, found in Poona, is of two varieties, bekar with ossicular dorsal fins and shilan with cartilaginous dorsal fins.\n\nBIRDS.\n\nA list of Sholapur birds is given in the Appendix.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPEOPLE.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census the population of the district was 582,487 or 128\u00b784 to the square mile. Of these Hindus numbered 537,635 or 92\u00b729 per cent; Musalm\u00e1ns 43,967 or 7\u00b754 per cent; Christians 625 or 0\u00b710 per cent; P\u00e1rsis 157 or 0\u00b702 per cent; Jews 94; Sikhs 8; and Buddhist 1.

into six classes:\n\nI.\u2014In Government Service, Learned Professions, Literature and Arts 11,552 or 1\u00b798 per cent.\n\nII.\u2014In House Service 6858 or 1\u00b717 per cent.\n\nIII.\u2014In Trade and Commerce 5938 or 1\u00b701 per cent.\n\nIV.\u2014In Agriculture 210,667 or 36\u00b716 per cent.\n\nV.\u2014In Crafts and Industries 60,962 or 10\u00b746 per cent.\n\nVI.\u2014In Indefinite and Unproductive Occupation, including children, 286,510 or 49\u00b718 per cent.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census of 97,882 houses, 81,203 were occupied and 16,679 were empty. The total gave an average of 21\u00b765 houses to the square mile, and the 81,203 occupied houses an average of 7\u00b717 inmates to each house.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census, six towns had more than 5000 and three of the six had more than 10,000 people. Excluding these six towns which together numbered 109,885 or 18\u00b786 per cent of the population the 472,602 inhabitants of Sholapur were distributed over 706 villages giving an average of one village for 6\u00b740 square miles, and of 669\u00b740 people to each village. Of the 706 villages 33 had less than 100 people, 78 between 100 and 200, 243 between 200 and 500, 230 between 500 and 1000, 96 between 1000 and 2000, 16 between 2000 and 3000, and 10 between 3000 and 5000.\n\nBrahmans according to the 1881 census included thirteen classes with a strength of 26,979 or 5\u00b701 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n---\n\n1 These accounts of Hindu castes have been compiled from materials collected by Mr. Sh\u00e1nt\u00e1ram Vin\u00e1yak Kantak, L.M., Assistant Surgeon, Pandharpur; and Mr. K. Raghu\u00f1\u00e1thji of Bombay.\nDeshasths, or Desh that is either Plain or Local Br\u00e1hmans, returned as numbering 23,360 and as found over the whole district. They are old settlers in the district and have no tradition or memory of any earlier home. They are divided into \u00c1shval\u00e1yans, K\u00e1n and Yajussh\u00e1khis or M\u00e1dhyandins, who eat together but do not intermarry. Among the members of the same section intermarriage cannot take place if the family stocks or gotras are the same. Their surnames are \u00c1radhe, Dandvate, Deshp\u00e1nde, G\u00e1t\u00e1de, Go Gulj\u00e1r, K\u00e1le, K\u00e1nd\u00e9, Konkne, T\u00e1th\u00e9, and Thite. Persons bearing the same surname cannot intermarry unless the surname is or was an office or calling name. Thus a Deshp\u00e1nde of one village can give his daughter in marriage to a Deshp\u00e1nde of another village provided their family stocks are different. The names in common among men are Anant, Bandoba, Bhagvant, Bindo, Gindo, Krishnch\u00e1rya, Malh\u00e1r, Narhari, Sh\u00e1mr\u00e1j, Tim\u00e1ji, Venim\u00e1dhav, and Yam\u00e1ji; and among women, Gita, Koyna, Krishna, Lakshmi, R\u00e1dl R\u00e1hi, Sarasv\u00e1t\u00ed, and Satyabh\u00e1ma. They are generally dark with regular features, but are rougher, hardier, and less acute than Konkanasth Br\u00e1hmans. The women, like the men, are dark and rough and not so goodlooking as the Konkanasth women. They speak broad-toned Mar\u00e1thi with a drawl and without the Konkanasth nasal twang.\u00b9 Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans live in houses of the better sort one or more storeys high with walls of mud and stone and flat roofs. Almost all the houses are built round an open square or chauk, one side of which in the upper storey is the kitchen and underneat it the cattle shed. In a niche in the wall near the kitchen door are the house gods, near whom an oil lamp is kept constant burning. Their house goods include copper and brass pots and pans, plates, ladles, and cups, also cots, bedding, and quilts. They generally have no servants, the women of the house doing all the work. Those who have fields keep cattle but families with fields and cattle are unusual. They have no pet animals or birds and are thrifty careful people. They are vegetarians, whose staple food is millet bread, rice, pulse, and vegetables. They are extremely fond of spices and chillies. They are great eaters but are not skilful cooks. They serve their food without neatness or finish.\n\n\u00b9 For no, n\u00e1hit, n\u00e1hita is colloquially used; for karat\u00e1t, bolat\u00e1t, and j\u00e1t\u00e1t they say karatet, bolat, and j\u00e1tet; for balantjh\u00e1li or is in childbed, kodani jh\u00e1li; for aj\u00e1ri dha, sick nj\u00edla ahe; for jv\u00e1ri, millet, d\u00e1rne; for wheat bread, tukda; for sutak mourn gunta; for over or sample, udle; and for chikhal or filth, chikhol.\nhave seldom any delicacies. They like coarse sugar better than fine sugar because coarse sugar is sweeter. Some use the charcoal of the castor oil plant and others use cow's urine as a spice. Their chief holiday dishes are gram cakes or puranpolis and sugared and spiced milk. Except the Sh\u00e1kts or worshippers of female energies they do not use liquor, and few of them either smoke tobacco or hemp, or drink hemp water. Snuff-taking and tobacco-chewing is common and betel-eating is universal. The men wear the top-knot and the moustache, but neither the beard nor the whiskers. They dress in a waistcloth, a waistcoat or a coat, a headscarf or turban, a shouldercloth, and shoes or sandals. Except in public the shouldercloth takes the place of the coat and waistcoat. The women dress in the backed bodice and the full Mar\u00e1tha robe with the skirt drawn back between the feet and tucked in at the waist behind. They mark their brows with a large red circle and braid the hair into a coil like a scorpion's tail. They generally wear false hair but do not deck it with flowers. They do not dress with taste or show any liking for gay colours. They have rich clothes in store many of which have been handed down two or three generations. As a class they are indolent, and untidy, but thrifty and hospitable, and franker and less cunning than Konkanasths. Their slovenliness and dullness have given them the name of dh\u00e1my\u00e1s or dh\u00e1mgands, that is stay-at-homes. They are writers, bankers, moneylenders and changers, traders, medical practitioners, landholders, priests, and beggars. They claim to be superior to all Br\u00e1hmans, professing to look down on the Konkanasths as Parashur\u00e1m's creation or srishti. They associate freely with Konkanasths and Karh\u00e1d\u00e1s, and eat with them, but except in a few cases do not marry with them. Some are Sm\u00e1rts or followers of the doctrine that the soul and the universe are the same, and others are Bh\u00e1gvats who hold that the soul and universe are distinct. The members of both sects worship all Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, and keep the ordinary fasts and festivals. Their priests belong to their own caste. They make pilgrimages to \u00c1landi, Allahabad, Benares, Gaya, Jejuri, Mathura, N\u00e1sik, Pandharpur, R\u00e1meshvar, and Tulj\u00e1pur. They believe in sorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying, omens, and lucky and unlucky days, and consult oracles. They always have their horoscopes cast, and when anything goes wrong they either consult their horoscopes or go to an astrologer. They have house gods and goddesses, goddesses being more frequently worshipped. Some of the goddesses Karamma, Sahadevi, Sh\u00e1kambari, and Yallamma, seem to point to a Dravidian that is an eastern or a southern origin. In social matters they belong to the great local community of Br\u00e1hmans which includes the members of the Chitp\u00e1van, Deshasth, Devrukha, and Karh\u00e1da castes. They send their boys to school and are a rising class.\n\nDevrukha Brahmans, of whom there is only one family of eight returned from M\u00e1lsiras, are immigrants from Devrukh in Ratn\u00e1giri. They have no subdivisions and their family stocks or gotras are Atri, J\u00e1madagnya, and K\u00e1shyap. Their surnames are Joshi, Mule, and Padval. Sameness of stock not sameness of surname bars marriage. In house, dress, food, and customs they do\nnot differ from Deshasths. They are either Sm\u00e1rtas or Bh\u00e1gvats, keep all Br\u00e1hmaic fasts and festivals, and go on pilgrimage to Benares, Jejuri, N\u00e1sik, and Pandharpur. They believe in sorcery and witchcraft, and consult oracles. They form part of the great Br\u00e1hman community, and settle social disputes at meetings of local Deshasths, Chitp\u00e1vans, Kerh\u00e1d\u00e1s, and Devrukh\u00e1s. They send their boys to school, and are in easy circumstances.\n\nGolaks are returned as numbering twenty-eight and as found only in B\u00e1rsi and in Pandharpur. They say they are Govardhan Br\u00e1hmans, and that they are considered degraded because their ancestors instead of rearing cows, sold them and lived on the proceeds. They say they came to Shol\u00e1pur from Parali Vaijn\u00e1th in the Konkan about fifty years ago in search of work. They are divided into Mund, Pund, and Rand Golaks who eat together but do not intermarry. Of these the Mund Golaks are said to be the offspring of widows whose heads have been shaved; the Punds the offspring of widows who became pregnant within a year of their husband\u2019s death, and the Rands of widows whose heads have not been shaved. The names of their family stocks or gotras are Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1j, Bh\u00e1rgav, K\u00e1shyap, Kausik, S\u00e1nkhy\u00e1yan, Vasishth and Vats; and their surnames are \u00c1l\u00e1t\u00e9, te, Avte, K\u00e1kde, Kolsune, Mandvale N\u00e1chne, P\u00e1chpore, Pol\u00e1de, Rishi, and Supnek\u00e1r. Persons bearing the same stock name and the same surname cannot intermarry. They look like Deshasths, and differ little from Deshasths in speech, house food or dress. They are hardworking, even-tempered, and hospitable, but neither neat nor clean. They are writers, money changers, cloth merchants, messengers, and husbandmen. Boys begin to work at fifteen and are thoroughly trained in three or five years. The women, besides looking after the house, help the men in the field, watching the crops and reaping at harvest. The men do no work in the fields without the help of Kunbi servants or labourers. Those who keep cloth shops buy the cloth in Poona, Bombay, or Shol\u00e1pur, and sell it at a profit of about six per cent (1 a. in the rupee). They generally sell country made cloth. Most of them have some small capital, and to increase their business take in partners. Their work is not steady and their income is doubtful. Many are in debt which they say is due to heavy marriage expenses. They have not much credit but can borrow up to \u00a350 (Rs. 500) at eighteen to twenty per cent a year. They claim to be equal to Deshast Br\u00e1hmans, but Deshasths consider them inferior and neither eat nor drink with them. They worship the usual Br\u00e1hman and local gods and goddesses, especially Bahiroba, Khandoba, and the Bhav\u00e1n of Aundh, Kolh\u00e1pur, and Tulj\u00e1pur. They keep all Hindu fasts and feasts and call Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans to officiate at their houses. They go on pilgrimage to \u00c1landi, Allahabad, Benares, Jejuri, Oudh, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur. They believe in sorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying, omens, and lucky and unlucky days, and consult oracle. When a child is born, a midwife who is generally a Kunbi cuts the navel cord, puts the cord and the after-birth in an earthen jar alor\n\n* Details of Govardhan Br\u00e1hmans are given in the N\u00e1sik Statistical Account.\nwith a copper coin, a turmeric root, and a betelnut, and buries the whole in the lying-in room. The child and its mother are bathed in warm water and laid on the cot. For the first day the child is fed on castor oil, on the second on honey, and from the third on its mother's milk. For the first five days the mother is fed on rice and clarified butter. In the evening of the fifth day an image of the goddess Satvai is placed on a grindstone in the lying-in room and surrounded with five to ten dough lamps. On the stone are laid a blank sheet of paper, a pen, and some ink and the knife with which the navel cord was cut. The midwife lights a brass hanging lamp, worships the stone and the articles on the stone, offers them cooked rice and butter, and begs them to be kind to the child and the mother. For ten days after the birth the mother and her family remain impure, and either on the twelfth or on the thirteenth the child is laid in the cradle and named. When the child is between a month and three years old its hair is clipped for the first time. It is seated on its maternal uncle's knee, has its hair cut by a barber, is bathed, dressed in new clothes, and taken to the village temple. A dinner is given to near relations the chief guests being a married woman and her husband. A Golak boy is girt with the sacred thread between his fifth and his eleventh year.\n\nA couple of days before the girding, the boy's parents and a few near relations accompanied by music start to ask neighbour relations and friends always beginning with the village god. At the house a booth is made and an earthen altar raised facing the west. On the day before the day fixed for the girding the rice-pounding and god-installing are performed. On the thread-girding day the family barber shaves the boy's head and the boy eats from the same plate with his mother for the last time. His brow is decked with ornaments and flowers, he bows low before the house gods, his elders, and the learned Br\u00e1hmans, and sits on the altar on a heap of rice in front of his father. Between the boy and his father two male relations hold a sheet of unbleached cotton cloth marked with red lines, and the family priest hands grains of red rice both to male and female guests. The astrologer or in his absence the family priest repeats verses and when the lucky moment has come the cloth is pulled on one side, the musicians play, and the guests throw rice over the boy's head. The boy makes a low bow before his father, and the father takes him with both his hands and seats him on his knees. The priest kindles the sacred fire on the altar in front of the father and feeds it with firewood, cowdung cakes, and butter. The priest ties a cotton thread round the boy's waist and gives him a loincloth to wear. He rolls a piece of cloth round his waist and another round his shoulders. A piece of deer skin is hung on the boy's left shoulder in the same way as the sacred thread. A sacred thread is thrown round his left shoulder, and the boy walks between the fire and his father. The father whispers the sacred gayatri or sun-hymn into his right ear; a sacred grass or munj cord is tied round the boy's waist; a palas staff is given into his hands and his father advises him to behave with religious exactness or \u00e1ch\u00e1r. In the evening accompanied by male and female relations and music, the boy is taken to the village temple, makes a low bow before the god, and is\nbrought home. Instead of going into the house the boy sits in the booth and is given alms consisting of sweetmeat balls and money which become the priest's property. The priest rekindles the sacred fire and teaches the boy twilight prayers or sandhya. The boy makes over to the priest the staff, the deer skin, the loincloth, and the grass cord. A feast to Br\u0101hmans ends the thread-girding. Golak girls are married before they are twelve and boys before they are twenty or twenty-five. They are bound together by a strong caste feeling, and settle social disputes at meetings of adult castemen. They send their boys to school but are not prosperous.\n\nGujar\u0101t Brahmans are returned as numbering 237 and as found over the whole district except in M\u0101lsiras. They come in search of work either as cooks or priests, stay for a few years, and go back to their native country.

They keep neither servants nor domestic animals. They are vegetarians, and their staple food is rice, wheat bread, pulse, butter, and sugar or molasses. Their favourite spices are black pepper, cloves, and cinnamon. They do not eat oil. They generally eat once in the afternoon, but bathe twice in the morning and at three in the afternoon. They avoid onions, garlic, and masur pulse, and use no intoxicating drinks. Many drink hemp water at midday and in the afternoon, and eat opium often twice a day in the morning after bathing and in the afternoon. They neither chew nor smoke tobacco. The men dress in an irregular carelessly-folded turban with the end left dangling a foot or a foot and a half from the head. It is shorter and not half so broad as the Deccan turban and is called batti or the lamp because if twisted it would be no thicker than an ordinary lamp wick. They wear a fine white coat reaching to the knees with creases at the waist; the waistcloth which is twelve feet long is worn doubled as Kunbis wear it; the shouldercloth is an old waistcloth doubled to make it look short; and their shoes are not double-toed like\nDeccan Br\u00e1hman shoes, and have a top to the heel.

They send their boys to school, but do not keep them there long. They take to no new pursuits and are in easy circumstances.\n\nKanauj Brahmans are returned as numbering 279 and as found over the whole district except in M\u00e1lsiras. They are an offset from the K\u00e1nya-Kubjas of North India, and are said to have come into the district as soldiers in Aurangzeb\u2019s army (1658-1707). They are divided into Kanaujs, San\u00e1dhy\u00e1s, and Sarvariy\u00e1s, who eat together but do not intermarry.

Their home tongue is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, but out of doors they speak Mar\u00e1thi and K\u00e1narese.

Sameness surname is no bar to marriage. The names in common use both among men and among women are the same as those among Chitpawar. Their home Marathi differs little from the ordinary Sholap.\nMarathi, but it is more like the Chitpavans' dialect than any other. In their house, dress, and food they do not differ from Chitpavans. They are the best cooks of all Deccan or Konkan Brahmins. They are thrifty clean and neat in their habits, hospitable, and orderly. Most of them serve as writers or karkuns in the revenue, police, and judicial departments of Government service.

They hold caste councils, send their boys to school, are free from debt, and live in fair comfort.\n\nKonkanasth Brahmins are returned as numbering 1627 and as found over the whole district. They are said to have come into the district during the time of the Peshw\u00e1s (1714-1818). They are divided into Apasthams or the followers of the Yajurved, and \u00c1shvalayans or the followers of the Rigved. The members of both these branches eat together and intermarry. Their personal names stock names and surnames are the same as those of Poona Konkanasths. Both men and women are fair, many of them with gray eyes. They have an air of intelligence and superiority, and are always awake to their own interests. The women are delicate with small hands and feet and are the fairest Hindus in the district, though those who have been long in the district are somewhat darker and rougher than Katn\u00e1giri Konkanasths. Their home Marathi differs from the Deshasth Brahman Marathi in being more nasal and in the use of some peculiar phrases.\u00b9 Most of them live in houses of the better sort one or two storeys high, with mud walls and flat roofs. Their houses are neat, clean, and well kept, and their house goods include metal vessels and earthen grain jars. Among the well-to-do the waterpots and cups, plates, and other vessels of worship are of silver. Their pet animals are cows and she-buffaloes, and in addition the well-to-do keep horses, bullocks, carriages, men and women servants, and Brahman cooks and water-carriers. Their staple food includes rice, pulse, wheat, millet, curds, and pickles. They are good cooks, though compared with those of the Deshasths or Karhad\u00e1s their dishes are somewhat insipid. They are very fond of curds and buttermilk, cocoanuts, and kokamb, and live almost entirely on rice. Like other Brahmins they are fond of clarified butter eating it chiefly with b\u00e1jri bread. A favourite dish is sponge cake called kh\u00e1parpoli eaten with cocoanut milk. Though strict vegetarians in ordinary life they keep to the\n\n\u00b9 For dilhe gave Konkanasths say dilan, for kh\u00e1ll\u00e9 ate khallan, for marle killed m\u00e1rlan, and for kele made kelan.\nold Br\u00e1hman practice of eating flesh at the religious offerings called yajnas. Their holiday dishes are spiced sweet milk and curds eaten with wheat cakes fried in butter, sweet spiced rice, wheat and pulse cakes eaten with clarified butter, milk, cocoanut milk, gram balls, and a variety of dishes. Sweet or hot and pungent mango, lemon, plum or karvand, green turmeric and chilly pickles are often used, and wafer biscuits of three kinds s\u00e1ndg\u00e1s, kh\u00e1rwadis, and kurwadis. They both chew and smoke tobacco and eat betelnut and leaves. The men wear the top-knot and the moustache, and sometimes the whiskers; and the women wear the hair in a peculiarly high, neat, and tightly coiled braid. They wear false hair and sometimes deck their heads with flowers. The men make a red or a white sandal brow mark, and the women apply a circle of redpower to the brow or draw a cross streak but make no imitation of the basil leaf. Both men and women dress in the same way as Deshasths but with much more taste and neatness. The men wear a waistcloth, a coat, a waistcoat, a shouldercloth, a turban or headscarf, and shoes. The women wear a robe and bodice the same as Deshasth women. Their intelligence, pride, cunning, and love of intrigue have combined to raise the Konkanasths to the first place among Deccan Br\u00e1hmans. They are hardworking, sober, and wide-awake to their own interests. They are thrifty and proverbially stingy. Konkanasths are landed proprietors, moneylenders, cloth and grain dealers, Government servants, and beggars. They are fond of parading their religiousness. They are either Sm\u00e1rts or Bh\u00e1gvats and worship all Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses. They keep the usual fasts and festivals and their priests belong to their own caste. They make pilgrimages to Benares, Kolhapur, and Tuljapur, and believe in sorcery and witchcraft, and in the supernatural powers of magicians. They have a full belief in astrology, referring all the good and the evil which happens to the conjunction of good and bad stars in their nativity. They have no headman. Their customs from birth to death are the same as those given in the Poona Chitp\u00e1van Br\u00e1hman account. They form part of the Br\u00e1hman community which includes Konkanasths, Karhad\u00e1s, Deshasths, and Devrukh\u00e1s. Petty social disputes are settled by the adult male members of the subdivisions who live in the neighbourhood, and serious questions are referred to Shank\u00e1r\u00e1ch\u00e1rya the pontiff of Sm\u00e1rt Br\u00e1hmans whose headquarters are at Shringeri in north-west Maisur. All of them send their boys to school and most of them teach them English. They are a rising and prosperous class.\n\nM\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. Ma\u2019rwa\u2019r Bra\u2019hmans are returned as numbering sixty-seven and as found over the whole district except in M\u00e1dha, Pandharpur, and S\u00e1ngola. They say they have come into the district from M\u00e1rw\u00e1\u00ed within the last thirty years. They are divided into \u00c1digauds, Audichs, D\u00e1yamas, Gauds, Gujar Gauds, P\u00e1rikhs, Purohits, San\u00e1vadis S\u00e1rasvats, Shri-Gauds, and Shrim\u00e1lis. The names of some of their family stocks or gotras are Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1j, Bh\u00e1rgav, Gautam, K\u00e1shyap, S\u00e1ndsan, and Sh\u00e1ndilya, and persons belonging to the same family stock or gotra do not intermarry. The surnames are Joshi, Mishar\nOjha, P\u00e1nde, Pandit, Tiv\u00e1ri, Up\u00e1dhyya, and Vy\u00e1s; and persons bearing the same surname cannot intermarry. The names in common use among men are Bansil\u00e1l, Bhol\u00e1ram, Girdharl\u00e1l, Rupchand, and Shivl\u00e1l, and among women Champa, Chhoti, Kasturi, Keshar, Rangu, Saku, and Thaki. They are fair, tall, and stout, the women fairer than the men. The men have notably hard greedy lines at the corners of their mouths and sharp twinkling eyes. Among themselves they speak M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, a mixture of Gujar\u00e1ti and Brij. They generally live in one-storeyed houses built of mud or mortar and stones and with flat mud roofs. Their house goods include wooden boxes, bedsteads, mirrors, glass globes, carpets or mats and cushions, copper and brass vessels, silver plate, and other articles. They keep cows and parrots but no servants. Their staple food includes wheat bread, pulse, rice, butter, and vegetables. They are fond of sweet dishes and butter, and dislike hot spicy dishes. They are generally good cooks, supplementing their food with a variety of pickles and fruit. They are careful to destroy no animal life in the water they drink. M\u00e1rw\u00e1r Br\u00e1hmans never touch intoxicating liquor, except that those whose family deity is Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i drink wine on the Ashvin or September-October full-moon. They use opium, hemp water, and tobacco but not to excess. The men wear the waistcloth and a long fine tight-fitting white coat falling below the knee with sleeves cut so that the cuffs may be turned back. The coat is so tight that part of the right chest is left bare. They generally wear no waistcoat. Their turbans are either red or rose coloured and twisted and folded like Mar\u00e1tha turbans. They wear shoes and a shouldercloth and carry no handkerchief. The men wear the top-knot, beard, and moustache and keep a tuft of hair above each ear. The women wear the hair in a braid at the back of the head, and the hair on either side of the forehead is also braided with red and yellow thread. The side braids are drawn behind the ears and all three braids are folded and tied in a knot, or are turned in an open coil on the head as is done by Deshasth and other Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hman women. The women wear a petticoat generally made of country bodicecloth and an open-backed bodice. They cover the upper part of the body with a sheet, one end of which they tuck into the waist in front or a little to the right side, and carry the other end over the head covering the back and shoulder. Some wear a coloured robe about twelve feet long instead of the sheet. They are hardworking, sober, and almost miserly in their thriftiness. They are writers, petty bankers, moneychangers, cooks, and beggars. They complain that their work is not steady and that they are not well-to-do. They believe in astrology, but profess to have no faith in witchcraft sorcery or oracles. Their customs are the same as those of Poona M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri Br\u00e1hmans. Child marriage and polygamy are allowed, widow marriage is forbidden, and polyandry is unknown. They are bound together by a strong caste-feeling and settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen. When an offence is proved the culprit is fined 2s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 1-10), and is not considered a member of the caste until the fine is paid.\nThe amount is spent in the service of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji. They send their boy to school until they know how to read, write, and cast accounts. They are not considered a thriving people.\n\nRa'm\u00e1nuj Bra'hmans are returned as numbering fourteen and as found only in Pandharpur. R\u00e1m\u00e1nujis, or followers of R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj the twelfth century reformer of Vaishnavism, belong to all high and middle class Hindus. Each marries with and keeps to the customs of his own caste. All the Pandharpur R\u00e1m\u00e1nujis are Br\u00e1hmans by cast and ascetics. R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj the founder of the sect was it is said a incarnation of Shesh the cobra god, on whose coils and under whose open hood lies N\u00e1r\u00e1yan or Vishnu the universal spirit. Shesh played a leading part in some of Vishnu's later incarnations, appearing as Balir\u00e1m the brother of Krishna and as Lakshman the brother of R\u00e1m. When, in spite of all his efforts, Vishnu saw that the world was growing worse, he about 1130 sent Shesh once more on earth to live in R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj, the son of a Dravidian Br\u00e1hman name Keshav\u00e1ch\u00e1rya and of his wife K\u00e1ntimati. After R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj was invested with the sacred thread, he studied the Veds and other sacred books under his maternal uncle Y\u00e1davprak\u00e1\u015bhat K\u00e1nchi or K\u00e1njiveran. He generally lived at Shrirang near Trichinopoly and from there travelled over most of India, stopped a considerable time at Benare, Jagann\u00e1th, and Jaypur, disputing with the Shaivs and Jains. At Jaypur he not only overcame the Jains in argument, but made the king of Jaypur so hot a convert to his faith that he slaughtered numbers of Jains and established a R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj monastery. R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj went about reforming, establishing the worship of Vishnu, and reclaiming temples from the worship of other gods one of the most famous of which was the Shaiv temple of Tirupati in North Arkot, now one of the leading South Indian centres of Vaishnavism. R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj belonged to the Vishisht\u00e1dvait school which regards the Deity as one with the universe. The sect spread widely in Southern India, most of its followers being Dravidian Br\u00e1hmans, though it also numbers many Northern India or Gaud Br\u00e1hmans. His followers claim a high antiquity for the sect, but, as has been noticed, R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj seems to have lived in the twelfth century. The R\u00e1m\u00e1nujis of Pandharpur are a Br\u00e1hmans and are divided into Badagalai or Badahalai meaning northerners and Tingolai meaning southerners who eat together an intermarry. Their family stocks or gotras are Atri, Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1j, J\u00e1ma, agnya, K\u00e1shyap, and Sh\u00e1ndilya. Sameness of stock is a bar to marriage. A member of the R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj sect, whether his caste be Br\u00e1hman, V\u00e1n, Son\u00e1r, Sut\u00e1r, or Kunbi, can be easily known by two upright yellow guardian-sandal or gopichandan marks which stretch from between the eyebrows to the root of the hair and are known as Vishnu's feet. Between the two lines is a third, red or yellow, representing the goddess Lakshmi, Vishnu's spouse. A Tingolai or southerner in addition at the end of the curve between the eyebrows, draws the middle line half-way down the nose. The different members of the\n\n---\n\n1 Badagalai is the Tamil badag north; and Tingolai is the Tamil tingol south.\nsect speak their mother tongue Hindust\u00e1ni, Gujar\u00e1ti, Mar\u00e1thi, or Telugu. The Pandharpur R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00eds are unmarried ascetics who live in a strongly built math or religious house at Pandharpur well supplied with vessels and furniture and with cows, buffaloes, and parrots. Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00eds are strict vegetarians. They are great eaters and fair cooks. Their staple food is jv\u00e1ri and wheat bread, pulse, and vegetables. They have several peculiar rules regarding their meals. Before they touch it they offer the whole of the cooked food to their gods. The dishes containing the cooked food are brought from the cook room and laid in front of the gods, a tulsi or holy basil leaf is laid on each, verses are said over them, and the men withdraw. After a few minutes during which the gods are supposed to dine, they carry the food back into the cook house. If the vessels containing the cooked food are too heavy to be removed, Sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m, the bored stone in which Vishnu lives, is taken from the god house to the cook-room and the food is offered to it. They dine once a day each man from a separate dish. When dining they wear a silk waistcloth, do not allow their food to be seen by others, and do not sit in a line with persons who though R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj Br\u00e1hmans are not strict observers of rules. The men wear a loincloth and over it a waistcloth. When going out they dress in a coat a waistcoat and a headscarf or cap. They keep the top-knot but never wear the moustache. Among those who are not ascetics the Badagalai but not the Tingolai widows shave the head. The men wear the sacred thread unless they turn ascetics, mark their brow with the n\u00e1m or two upright colour lines and brand their arms with the discus or chakra and other symbols of Vishnu. The Pandharpur R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00eds are a quiet, hospitable, and harmless people, following no calling. They are in easy circumstances and appear to have large resources. During the 1876-77 famine they fed some hundreds of famished people daily at their own expense. They claim equality with Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans, but will not eat or drink at their houses. Deccan Br\u00e1hmans keep aloof from them and profess to look down on them. Except P\u00e1nch\u00e1s other Hindus eat at their houses. They are religious and believe Vishnu to be the Supreme Being who exists from before the creation and will forever remain. Their leading gods are the incarnations of Vishnu, Krishna, R\u00e1m, and Vithoba. Their chief religious books are the Bh\u00e1rgavpur\u00e1n, Vishnupur\u00e1n, and R\u00e1m\u00e1nujbh\u00e1shya. Their chief monastery is in Northern India and they also have shrines in South India. They are the priests of B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed's temple at Giri or Tirupati in North Arkot. Their head priest or guru belongs to their own community and is married. They believe in witchcraft sorcery and soothsaying. Except their initiation their customs are the same as those of the caste to which they belong. When a person wishes to become a R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj he goes to the head or guru of the religious house and makes known his wish. In the morning of a lucky day which is fixed by an astrologer the novice bathes in a pond or river, takes some milk, curds, honey, sugar, flowers, sesamum, and barley, and goes to the religious house. The guru bathes, washes his gods with milk, curds, butter, sugar, and honey, rubs them dry and puts scented and redpowders sandal\nand flowers over them, burns frankincense before them, and offers them sweetmeats. He lights the sacred fire and feeds it with *pimpal* Ficus religiosa sticks, butter, barley, and sesamum. He heats metal symbols or *n\u00e1m* on the fire and when they are red-hot, stamps the novice\u2019s right and left arms with them. He makes the mark on his brow, gives him two pieces of cloth one to wear between his legs as a loincloth and one to tie round his waist as a waistcoat. The *guru* seats him near himself, and covering them both with sheet or shawl, whispers in his ears the mystic verse, *Om R\u00e1ma namas* Salutation to R\u00e1ma. To drown the *guru\u2019s* words the other ascetics keep chanting Vedic verses in a loud tone. The novice takes the sheet or shawl off himself and the teacher lays before the house gods money varying according to his means from a few shillings to some hundred pounds. The novice fasts during the day and remains by himself in the religious house. Next day a feast is given to the brotherhood and the novice either remains in the religious house or dresses in his usual clothes and goes back to his family.\n\n**Shenvis** are returned as numbering 165 and as found over the whole district except in Karm\u00e1la and S\u00e1ngola. The Shol\u00e1pu Shenvis say that they take their name from *Sh\u00e1h\u00e1nnavi* or ninety-six villages over which they had authority. They are also called S\u00e1rasvats which they derive from the founder of their caste, S\u00e1rasva by name the son of Sarasvati, a tributary of the Ganges. According to their account Parashur\u00e1m, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu, the destroyer of the Kshatriyas, brought three families of S\u00e1rasvat from a town called Trihotrapur supposed to be T\u00edrhat and settled them and their family gods in Goa; the original settlers were afterwards joined by seven more families. The Shol\u00e1pur Shenvi are said to have been settled in the district for four or five generations and to have originally come in search of work from Gw\u00e1lior, Kolhapur, and the Konkan. They are divided into B\u00e1rdeskars, Kud\u00e1ldeskars, R\u00e1japurkars, and Shenvis proper. These divisions do not intermarry and used not to eat together though lately the Shenvis proper, who are the highest of the four classes have begun to employ R\u00e1japurkars as cooks. The men are generally middle-sized, and the women taller than the men fair and regular featured. The men shave the head except the top-knot and the face except the moustache. The men rub their brows with sandal paste and the women with redpowder, and tie the hair in a knot behind. They speak Mar\u00e1thi both at home and abroad. They have forgotten the Konkani dialect which Goa M\u00e1lvan, and S\u00e1vantr\u00e1di Shenvis speak, though their speech has still traces of the Konkan twang. Most live in houses of the better sort one or two storeys high with walls of mud and stone and flat mud roofs. A few have servants, and almost all have cows buffaloes and horses. Their house furniture includes metal and earthen vessels, bedsteads, boxes, and lamps, and a few have tables chairs, sofas, argand lamps, glass hanging globes, and framed pictures. Their staple food includes rice, pulse, vegetables, pickles and wheat or *jv\u00e1ri* bread, curds, milk, whey, butter, and spices. Their holiday dish is gram cakes or *puranpolis*. They stealthily,\neat fish or flesh, but, during the four sacred months or ch\u00e1turm\u00e1s, July, August, September, and October they do not eat even onions, garlic, or brinjals. They do not use spirituous liquor. Many smoke, several chew, and a few snuff tobacco. Both men and women dress like Br\u00e1hmans. They are neat, clean, sober, hospitable, and orderly people. They are landholders and in Government service as writers. They are a well-to-do class seldom in debt and able to raise money at nine to twelve per cent a year. They hold themselves equal to Deshasth Konkanasth and Karh\u00e1da Br\u00e1hmans and have the same privileges as other Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. The daily life of a man varies according to his occupation. The landholders do not work in the fields and have much leisure. A Shenvi landlord rises early, washes, stands facing the east, and joining his hand bows to the sun repeating verses. If he has no servants he goes to market to buy vegetables and other articles of daily use. On his return he either sits gossiping with a friend or acquaintance or bathes and spends an hour or two in praying or worshipping his house gods, he then dines generally about noon, and, after dinner, sleeps for an hour or two. In the afternoon he writes letters or attends business or he goes out and gossips with friends till evening when he visits a temple on his way home. On his return he washes his hands and feet, says his evening prayers, worships the house gods, sups, and goes to bed. Shenvi women are quiet, forbearing, and hardworking. A rich man\u2019s wife leads an easy life generally with a servant to do the heavy and unpleasant parts of the housework. The wife of a poor Shenvi is always busy. She is early at work, grinding grain, often singing as she grinds. If she has young children she has to prepare an early breakfast of bread and chatni. After the children have breakfasted she has to attend to the chief morning meal; she bathes early and goes to the hearth and takes advantage of any rest in her cooking to worship the tulsi plant or tell her beads. When the midday meal is ready she serves it to the men of the house and the little children. After they are done, with any female relation who may be in the house, she takes her dinner and makes over the rest to the servants. If there is a servant he cleans the pots and washes the clothes, if not the wife has to do the cleaning and washing. When this is over she either looks to her children or their clothes, sits sifting rice for the next day\u2019s meal, or goes to the temple where sacred books are read, or to her mother\u2019s house if it is in the village. In the evening she has again to cook and serve supper, sups, and cowdungs the hearth. Both boys and girls attend school both in the morning and afternoon. They are religious and worship all Hindu gods and goddesses. The shrines of their family gods are chiefly in Goa. They are either Sm\u00e1rt or Bh\u00e1gvats and their priests are Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. They keep the usual Hindu fasts and feasts and go on pilgrimage to \u00c1landi, Benares, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur. They have three religious teachers or Sv\u00e1mis, two of them Bh\u00e1gvats and the third a Sm\u00e1rt. The two Bh\u00e1gvat religious houses are in Gokarn in North K\u00e1nara and in Cochin, and the religious house of the Sm\u00e1rt teacher is in Goa. They travel in state accompanied by a number of disciples gathering money.\npresents. They do not try to make fresh converts and are not much respected by the educated and leading members of the caste. The sacraments or sansk\u0101rs observed by Shenvis are puberty, pregnancy, birth, naming, first feeding, keeping of the top-knot, thread-girding, marriage, and death. The Shenvis hardly ever meet to settle social disputes. In case of a serious breach of caste rules the Sv\u0101mi is asked, but the members are indifferent and seldom notice breaches of rules. They send their children to school and are a rising and prosperous people.\n\nTelang Brahmans are returned as numbering fifty-six and as found in B\u00e1rsi, Pandharpur, and Shol\u00e1pur. They do not always live in the district but come once every two or three years, gather money by begging, and go back to Telangan in the south. They have no subdivisions, and the names of their family stocks are Angiras, Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1j, Kaundanya, K\u00e1shyap, Kanshik, and Strivat. Their surnames are Chal\u00e1v\u00e1ru, Chalbat\u00e1v\u00e1ru, Pidalbat\u00e1lav\u00e1ru, and Rant\u00e1chantal\u00e1v\u00e1ru, and persons having either the same family name or the same surname do not intermarry. The names in common use among men are Govindanna, R\u00e1chaya, R\u00e1maya, R\u00e1man; and Shripatanna; and among women K\u00e1shib\u00e1i, Mariamma, and Shit\u00e1mma. The men are dark, tall, and stout, and besmear the face and hair with cocoanut oil. They wear long thick top-knots and grow the moustache and beard but shave the whiskers. The home tongue is Telugu, but abroad they speak an incorrect Mar\u00e1thi. They have no houses of their own. Their house goods are blanket mats, and a couple of sheets, a few metal or earthen cooking vessels, and a couple of water pots and cups. They are greedy eaters and fond of sour dishes. Their staple food is rice and curry with a large share of tamarind pulp. They are fond of whey and curds and will fast for a day or even two days in advance if they hear of a dinner party where they think they will succeed in securing a plate. The Telang Br\u00e1hman is proverbial for the unbidden guest. When a dinner is given to Br\u00e1hmans the Telangs come unasked, clamour for a share, and if they get no share load the host with hearty curses. Both men and women dress like Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. But the men prefer going bareheaded and wearing a short waistcloth either held under the armpit or rolled round the shoulders. They are clean but idle and hot-tempered. They are beggars and some make and sell sacred threads. They are religious and are chiefly Sm\u00e1rtas or followers of Sankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya the apostle of the doctrine that the soul and the universe are one. They worship a Br\u00e1hman gods and goddesses, and their family gods are Jagadam\u00e1 and Vyankoba whose shrines are in the Telangan country. They keep the ordinary fasts and feasts, and their priests belong to their own caste. They have great faith in sorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying omens, and lucky and unlucky days and consult oracles. When a Telang woman is brought to bed she sends for a Kunbi midwife. When the child is born, the midwife cuts the navel cord and buries it with a copper coin, a betelnut, and a turmeric root in an earthen vessel at the back of the house. The child is bathed in warm water and laid on the cot beside its mother. For the first three days the child is fed on honey and after that on milk.\nmother's milk. The mother is washed for the first time on the fourth day and fed on rice and butter. On the evening of the fifth day the midwife lays the knife with which the child's navel cord was cut on a grindstone in the mother's room and worships it, offering it flowers and burning incense before it. The mother's family is impure for ten days after the birth, and the child is named on the twelfth or thirteenth. If the child is a boy his head is shaved on a lucky day between his first and third year. A boy is girt with the sacred thread between five and eleven. The day before the girding an invitation goes round accompanied by music, and a feast is given to near relations and friends. On the thread-girding day the sacrificial fire is kindled on the altar and the sacred thread is put round the boy's neck and right arm. The ceremony ends with a dinner to Br\u00e1hmans.\n\nTelangs marry their girls between eight and twelve, and their boys before they are twenty-five. If both fathers are well-to-do no money payment is made. If the girl's father is poor the boy's father pays him \u00a35 to \u00a330 (Rs. 50-300). When the parents agree, relations and friends are asked to witness the settlement. On the marriage day the boy goes in procession to the girl's house on horseback, and stands facing the girl on a wooden stool. Two near relations hold a sheet between them and the priests and other Br\u00e1hmans present repeat marriage verses. At the end grains of rice are thrown over their heads and they are husband and wife. Presents of clothes are made and dinners are given by the two families and the marriage is over. The Telang's puberty, pregnancy, and death ceremonies are generally the same as those of Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. They hold caste meetings, send their boys to school, and are poor.\n\nT\u00edrguls are returned as numbering 359 and as found over the whole district except in Karm\u00e1la and S\u00e1ngola. According to Shol\u00e1pur Br\u00e1hmans, apparently a play on the words tin gul or gol, T\u00edrguls are those whose ancestors for three generations have been Golaks. The local history is that during the time of the Peshw\u00e1s Br\u00e1hman widows and wives who were pregnant by men who were not their husbands were sent on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur, to prevent them committing abortion and infanticide. The women lay in at Pandharpur and the infant with or without money presents was made over to any one who would take it. This is said to be the reason why so many T\u00edrguls are found in and about Pandharpur. Their family stocks are Angiras Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1j; Haritasya, K\u00e1shyap, Lohit, and Shr\u00edvats, and their sub-stocks or pravars are Bh\u00e1rgav, Chavan, Jamad\u00e1gni, and Shr\u00edvats. They look and speak like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, are betel-vine growers, cultivators, grain dealers, moneylenders and changers, bankers, and Government servants. Their house, food, and dress do not differ from those of Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. They are well-to-do but other Br\u00e1hmans do not eat with them and look down on them because in growing the betel vine they kill insects. They are either Sm\u00e1rtas or Bh\u00e1gvats and worship all Br\u00e1hman gods and goddesses and keep the usual fasts and festivals. Their priests are Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. They go on pilgrimage to \u00c1land\u00ed, Benares, N\u00e1sik, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur, and believe in\nsorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying, omens, and lucky and unlucky days, and consult oracles. Among Tirguls a lighted lamp is kept burning in the lying-in room for three months after childbirth. For the first ten days the family priest every evening repeats sacred verses at the mother's house, and, at the end of the verses, throws grains of red rice over the mother and rubs ashes on the mother and child's brows. On the fifth day in the mother's room, on grindstone, are placed a rolling pin, a blank sheet of paper, pen, and some ink, the penknife with which the child's navel cord was cut, thirty-two kinds of medicines, a bamboo stick, a hoe, brass water pot filled with water, betelnuts, dry cocoa kernel, turmeric root, and a copper coin, and over the whole flower garlands are hung from the ceiling. To the left of the grindstone is a lighted lamp which is allowed to burn ten days. The midwife sits in front of the stone and worships it, sprinkles red and turmeric powder over it, waves a lighted lamp and frankincense before it and offers it dishes of rice, vegetables, and sweetmeats. She places a handful of wheat grains and a betelnut in front of the whole which is considered to mean filling the goddess' lap. The midwife's lap is filled with wheat and a betelnut, and she dines that evening at the mother's house. After the midwife is done, the guests and the house people dine. From eight in the evening five next morning, four Brahmans sit in the house repeating sacred verses, and are dismissed with a packet of betelnut and leaves an 6d. (4 as.) each. On the sixth or seventh the thirty-two medicines which were worshipped on the fifth are pounded together, divided into three equal parts, and a third taken daily for three days. On the tenth day the mother's bedding and clothes and cot are washed and the whole house is cowdunged. Six dough lamps are made and set each on a cowdung cake. Of the six four are placed one near each of the four feet of the cot, the fifth on the spot where the child was born, and the sixth on the spot where the navel cord was buried. The midwife lays red and turmeric powder before each lamp and afterwards takes the lamps to her house. This day again the lap of the midwife is filled with wheat and a packet of betelnut and leaves, and she dines at the mother's house. On the morning of the eleventh day the mother and child are bathed and cow's urine is sprinkled on the cot and over the whole house. Five married women are called and seated on a mat or carpet in the mother's room. Another carpet is spread and a rice figure of a child is made on the carpet with its head to the south and its feet to the north. The mother, sitting in front of it, worships the image by sprinkling turmeric and redpowder over it and offering it a pound mixture of ginger, sugar, and dry cocoa kernel. The five married women are presented with turmeric and redpowder, packets of betelnut and leaves, dry cocoakernel, and the ginger mixture and retire. The rice figure is taken away by some married childless woman, who cooks and eats it in the hope that the figure will take birth in her womb in the form of a child. On the twelfth day five pebbles are arranged in a line in front of the house and are worshipped by the mother, who sprinkles red turmeric an-\nsweet scented powder over them, burns frankincense in front of them, and offers them cooked rice, curds, and sweetmeats. A Tirgul girl is named on the twelfth and a boy on the thirteenth, the naming is the same as among Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. Three months after childbirth the mother is taken to her husband's. A couple of days before she moves the father's mother sends word to the child's mother's parents that she is going to take the child and its mother home on a particular day. On the day named the child's grand-mother and a few near relations start for the mother's, taking in a tray a couple of robes and bodices, a frock, a cap, a hooded cloak, a cocoanut, about two pounds of sweet smelling rice, half a pound of betelnuts, one hundred betel leaves, a handful of cardamoms and mace, and about five pounds of sugar and butter. On reaching the mother's they are seated on carpets or mats. One robe and bodice are presented to the child's grandmother and the other to the child's mother, and the child is dressed in the frock cap and cloak. They empty the tray and walk home with the child and its mother. When the child is between one and three years old if it is a boy the barber clips its hair with the same details as at a Deshasth Br\u00e1hman's hairclipping. A boy is girt with the sacred thread before he is ten years old. They marry their girls before they are eleven and their boys before they are twenty-five. Their customs are generally the same as Deshasth Br\u00e1hman customs. They have a caste council, send their boys to school, and are in easy circumstances.\n\nVidurs are returned as numbering 280 and as found only in B\u00e1rsi and Shol\u00e1pur. They are said to be illegitimate, born of a Br\u00e1hman father and a Mar\u00e1tha mother. They say they cannot tell when and whence they came into the district. The names of their family stocks or gotras are K\u00e1shyap, Govardhan, and Kaundanya, and their surnames are Dagade, Devle, Londhe, and Parm\u00e9le. Persons whose surname and family name are the same cannot intermarry. They look like Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans, and are healthy and strong. They speak a Mar\u00e1thi closely like that spoken by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and cultivating Kunbis. They live in middle class houses with walls of mud and stone and flat roofs. They keep their houses clean, and own cows, buffaloes, bullocks, and parrots. Their house furniture includes metal and earthen vessels, carpets, blankets, bedding and cots, and stools. They have no servants. Their staple food includes rice and jv\u00e1ri bread, pulse, and vegetables. They say they do not eat fish or flesh and do not drink liquor. Both men and women dress like Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans, but, unlike all other Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, their widows never shave their heads. They are hardworking, sober, thrifty, and hospitable. They are landholders, moneychangers, clothsellers, and writers, and some are beggars. They are either Sm\u00e1rts or Bh\u00e1gvats, worship all Br\u00e1hman gods and goddesses and keep the usual fasts and festivals. Their priests are Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. They go on pilgrimage to \u00c1landi, Benares, Jejuri, N\u00e1sik, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur, and believe in sorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying, omens, lucky and unlucky days, and oracles. When a person is possessed his relations\ncall a spirit-scarer called *j\u00e1nta* that is the knowing man or *devrushi*. The spirit-scarer burns *vishesh* or the sap of *Boswellia serrata* before the patient and the spirit or *bhut* in the patient begins to sway him to and fro and begins to speak through the patient\u2019s voice. The scarer waves three lemons round the patient\u2019s head. Two of them he cuts in half over the patient\u2019s head when they turn red and he orders them to be thrown outside the house in four directions. The third lemon he orders to be laid under the patient\u2019s pillow until he recovers. Cooked rice sprinkled with redpowder is waved round the patient\u2019s head and laid in the corner of the street, where spirits are known to haunt. Sometimes the seer after examining the patient says he has offended Khandoba, M\u00e1rti, or some other god, and that he should take a journey to some holy shrine or send to the seer\u2019s house uncooked food enough to feed thirty to fifty Br\u00e1hmans. These orders are carefully followed. Their customs from birth to death are the same as those of Deshasths. They are bound together by a strong caste feeling and settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen. The offender is fined by being ordered to give a dinner to from five children to twenty-five adults. They send their boys to school and keep them at school until they are able to read write and cast accounts. They seldom send their girls to school. When a girl is sent to school the reason generally is that she is troublesome at home. They take to new callings opening grocer\u2019s shops or tilling land, and are in easy circumstances.\n\n**Writers** include two classes with a strength of 184. Of these 111 (males 51, females 60) were K\u00e1yasth Prabhus, and 73 (males 31 females 42) were Mudli\u00e1rs.\n\n**K\u00e1yasth Prabhus** are returned as numbering 111 and as found over the whole district except in M\u00e1lsiras.

They gird their boys with the sacred thread before they are ten years old and marry them before they come to manhood. They marry their girls before they are ten, and spend \u00a320 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 200-1000) on a child\u2019s marriage. They burn their dead, forbid widow marriage and practise polygamy, polyandry is unknown. They worship all Br\u00e1hmamic gods and goddesses, but so greatly prefer to worship goddesses that they are known as *devi-bhakts* or goddess worshippers.

They go on pilgrimage to Ben\u00e1res, N\u00e1sik, and Pandharpur, and believe in witchcraft and soothsaying and consult oracles. They settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen. They send their children both boys and\ngirls to school and keep their girls at school till they are about twelve years old. In spite of their small numbers and of the keen competition for clerkship they hold their own against Br\u00e1hman and other non-writer classes whom they term intruders. They are decidedly well-to-do.\n\nMudli\u00e1rs literally South-easters also called Madr\u00e1s\u00eds are returned as numbering 73 and as found in B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, and Shol\u00e1pur. They are said to have come to the district from the Madras Presidency twenty-five or thirty years ago in search of work.

The names in common use among men are Armu, Jagann\u00e1th, Khamaya, M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v, Narhariaya, Pulaya, and T\u00e1ndr\u00e1v. The mode of writing their names is to write the initial letter of their native town, then the person\u2019s name, his father\u2019s name, and lastly the name of the subdivision or caste; thus Tanjor M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Jagann\u00e1th Pille or T. M. Jagann\u00e1th Pille, or simply T. M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v. The women\u2019s names are Bh\u00e1girthi, Ganga, M\u00e1nakb\u00e1i, and Sonub\u00e1i.

They dress in a doubled waistcloth, a long native or a short European coat, falling below the knee or reaching the waist. They arrange the headscarf so that the outer folds cross exactly in the middle of the forehead. They carry a red handkerchief in their hands, and from their ear lobes hang gold worked rudr\u00e1ksh beads. The women tie their long oily black hair in a knot on one side behind the ear. They are fond of rubbing the hair with cocoa oil to keep it glossy and prevent baldness, which is rare among them. The women wear a robe but do not pass the skirt back between the feet. They draw the upper end across the chest, and passing it across the back, tuck it in at the waist. Their bodice is the same as the Mar\u00e1tha bodice. They buy their clothes from the local market except their costly robes and headscarfs which come from Madras. The men are clean in their habits, and always wear clothes washed by a washerman. They are hardworking, even-tempered, hospitable, thrifty, polite, and orderly. Their women are not so neat or clean as the men. They delight in soaking their hair in cocoa oil, and anointing their bodies especially their faces. They are clerks and\nwriters, contractors, moneylenders, landholders letting fields to husbandmen on the crop-share system, tobacconists selling cigarettes and cheroots, and country and European liquor sellers.

They fast on Saturdays and the lunar elevenths or Ek\u0101dashis and keep the ordinary Hindu fasts and festivals. Their spiritual head is a member of their own community who lives in the Madras Presidency. They believe in sorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying, omens, and in lucky and unlucky days, and consult oracles. When a child is born the mother is washed in hot water and laid on the cot. The midwife cuts the child\u2019s navel cord and buries it with the afterbirth outside of the house. The child is bathed in hot water and laid on the cot beside the mother. For three days the child is fed on castor oil and honey, and on the fourth day the mother bathes and then suckles it. During the first two days the mother fasts and from the third to the tenth day is fed on rice and butter. The family is considered impure for nine days. On the tenth the house is cowdunged, the clothes are washed, and the whole family bathes. On the twelfth a party of women come, cradle the child, and the father\u2019s mother or other elderly female relation whispers a name in its right ear. The cradle is rocked, a song is sung, and after the guests have presented the child and its mother with clothes, they are feasted and retire with packets of betelnut and leaves. When a child, whether a boy or a girl is one to three years old, its hair is clipped by the family barber. They marry their girls between ten and sixteen and their boys between fifteen and twenty-five. The girl\u2019s father has to find her a husband. When a boy is found, on a lucky day his parents with relations and friends go to the girl\u2019s and present her with a robe, a bodice, and ornaments. A couple of days before the marriage, booths are made at both houses, and a marriage altar is built at the girl\u2019s. On each of the four sides of the altar is set an earthen jar striped with yellow and red lines and filled with cold water, and near each jar is set a lighted brass lamp. On the marriage morning the earthen jars are worshipped and a lucky post or muhurtmedh is set in front of the house to the top of which are tied a bundle of hay, two coconuts, bunches of wheat plants, and a piece of yellow cloth with a couple of turmeric roots in it. On the marriage day the bridegroom with music and accompanied by his parents relations and friends goes to the girl\u2019s riding on horseback. At the girl\u2019s her mother waves five wheat cakes round the boy\u2019s head and throws them on one side. He dismounts and takes his seat on a low wooden stool set on the altar. He worships Ganpati and a water pot or Var\u1e47a. He puts off his waistcloth and puts on a loincloth and a sacred thread and resumes his seat. The priest mutters some verses and throws grains of rice over the boy\u2019s head. The girl\u2019s father presents him with a new waistcloth which he puts on,\nand again takes his seat. The boy's father presents the girl with a new robe and bodice which she puts on, and takes her seat on the altar close to the boy on a low wooden stool. A gold not a tinsel marriage ornament is tied round the boy's brow, and a member of the girl's family sets in front of the boy a brass plate with red rice a cocoanut and a necklace of black glass beads. The plate is shown to each guest, who takes a pinch of rice in his hands and with his fingers touches the cocoanut and the necklace. After all have touched the cocoanut and the necklace the priest lays the plate in front of the boy and girl, repeats verses, places the cocoanut in the boy's hands, and ties the necklace round the girl's neck. The guests throw the rice over the couple's head and the verse-repeating is over. The priest kindles a sacred fire on the altar in front of the boy and girl who feed it with butter, dry dates, and dry cocoa-kernel. He takes two pieces of cotton yarn and makes five folds of each, and, tying a turmeric root to each, fastens them round the boy's and the girl's right wrists. A dinner to all present ends the day's proceedings and the guests retire. For two days the bridegroom remains at the bride's, and, on the morning of the third, the pair are bathed and dressed in fresh clothes and seated on two low wooden stools on the altar. In front of them is set an earthen jar filled with a mixture of turmeric powder and lime and water, and in it are dropped a gold finger ring and a conch shell and the pair are told to pick them out. They struggle hard, for whoever gets the ring is cheered and whoever gets the shell is jeered. If the bridegroom gets the ring, his friends are delighted; if the girl gets the ring her friends lament that so fit a girl should have got so feeble a husband. If the girl gets the ring her father presents it to the boy and sprinkles the guests with turmeric and lime from the ring jar which by this time has turned red. The boy and girl are seated on a horse and taken to the boy's accompanied by male and female relations and friends. They are feasted and the marriage festival is over. When a girl comes of age she is seated by herself for three days. On the fourth she is presented with a new robe and bodice, and goes to live with her husband. After death the body is anointed with oil and bathed in hot water on the spot where the dead breathed his last. The body is carried out laid on a bamboo bier, covered with a sheet, and tied all round with twine and coloured cotton. It is borne on the shoulders of four men, the chief mourner walking in front carrying an earthen jar containing live coal. A near relation carries in his hands a winnowing fan with parched grain, betelnuts dyed yellow with turmeric, and sugar cakes or bat\u00e1s\u00e1s, walks throwing them over the bier for a short distance, and then returning to the deceased's house, lays the fan in front of the house and rejoins the procession. When the procession has gone half way, the chief mourner throws a few copper coins over the body and the bier, and they again go on. At the burning ground the mourners busy themselves raising a pile of cowdung cakes and fuel, and the chief mourner, sitting near the corpse's feet, has his face shaved and his head except the topknot. He bathes, the body is laid on the pile, and with the help of the other mourners the chief mourner sets fire\nto it. To make it burn fiercer kerosine oil is poured over the pyre. When the body is consumed the mourners bathe and going to the deceased\u2019s house, look at the lamp which is kept burning on the spot where he breathed his last, and go to their houses. The mourning family is impure for fifteen days. On the second day the chief mourner with a few near relations, goes to the burning ground, bathes, and sprinkles over the ashes, milk, curds, and cow\u2019s urine, and with the help of the other mourners gathers the ashes and throws them into water. He lays sweetmeats on the place where the body was burnt, bathes, and all return to the mourner\u2019s house. On the sixteenth day the mourning family bathe, the house is cowdunged, and the married male members put on fresh sacred threads. A feast is given during the day, and in the evening the chief mourner is presented with a white turban and taken to the nearest temple. After this the mourner is free to go out and the mourning is over. They are bound together by a strong caste feeling, and settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen. They send their boys and their girls to school, and keep the girls at school till their twelfth year. They readily take to any new calling and are well-to-do.\n\nTraders include nine classes with a strength of 37,940 or 7.05 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Divisions       | Males | Females | Total |\n|-----------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Agarv\u00e1ls        | 7     | 10      | 17    |\n| Bh\u00e1t\u00e1s          | 86    | 57      | 143   |\n| Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis   | 1295  | 1211    | 2506  |\n| K\u00e1shi K\u00e1pidis   | 49    | 56      | 105   |\n| Kont\u00eds          | 1665  | 640     | 2225  |\n| Ling\u00e9y\u00e1 V\u00e1nis   | 10,719| 10,539  | 21,308|\n| Loh\u00e1ns\u00e1         | 5     | 1       | 6     |\n| M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1nis    | 3842  | 3392    | 7234  |\n| Vaishya V\u00e1nis   | 2216  | 2110    | 4326  |\n| Total           | 19,874| 18,066  | 37,940|\n\nAgarv\u00e1ls are returned as numbering seventeen and as found in B\u00e1rsi, Pandharpur, and Shol\u00e1pur. They believe they are called Agarv\u00e1ls because they make frankincense sticks or agarbattis, and think they came to Shol\u00e1pur about three hundred years ago from the neighbourhood of \u00c1gra and Delhi. They are divided into Dasa and Visa Agarv\u00e1ls who eat together but do not intermarry. They have no surnames. The names in common use among men are Chandul\u00e1l, Girdharl\u00e1l, Motir\u00e1m, Shankarl\u00e1l, Shivd\u00e1s, and Vithall\u00e1l; and among women Bh\u00e1girthi, Dv\u00e1rka, Jasoda, K\u00e1shib\u00e1i, Lakshmi, and Muny\u00e1b\u00e1i. They are dark and stout and speak Mar\u00e1thi. They live in ill-kept and dirty middle class houses. Their staple food includes millet, pulse and vegetables, and they are specially fond of sweet and oily dishes. Both men and women dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and are hardworking, even-tempered, thrifty, and hospitable, but neither clean nor neat. They are perfumers, selling scents, frankincense sticks, powders, and oils, and spices, butter, sugar, wheat, millet, rice or pulse flour, and cloth both country-made and European. Some are husbandmen whose women help them in the field. They worship all Br\u00e1hman gods and goddesses, and their family deities are B\u00e1l\u00e1ji of Giri, Bhav\u00e1ni of Tulj\u00e1pur, and K\u00e1l\u00edka of Delhi.\nTheir priests are Gaud Br\u00e1hmans. Their fasts and festivals are the same as those of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and they believe in sorcery, witchcraft and soothsaying. On the fifth day after a birth the midwife rubs five pebbles with redlead and laying them on the floor in the mother's room throws flowers and turmeric and redpowder over them, burns incense, and lays before them cooked rice, vegetables, wheat bread, and pulse. After the midwife has finished the mother makes a bow. They do not keep awake all night. The child's father's family remains impure for ten days. On the morning of the eleventh, the whole house is cowdunged, and the members of the family bathe, wash their clothes, and are pure. On the twelfth the mother sets five pebbles in a line outside of the house and does as the midwife did on the fifth day, throws flowers and turmeric and redpowder over them, burns incense, and lays before them cooked rice, vegetables, wheat bread, and pulse. On the evening of the twelfth if it is a boy and of the thirteenth if it is a girl, the child is cradled and named. Between its seventh month and its fifth year a child's hair is clipped for the first time. A girl is married between three and twelve, and a boy between five and twenty-five. The boy's father has to look for a wife for his son, and, when a girl is found, on a lucky day presents her with a robe and bodice and ornaments. On the turmeric rubbing day the boy and his parents are anointed with turmeric and oil and bathed in warm water, and the rest of the turmeric powder is sent to the girl's with a green robe and bodice. Next in the middle of the booth is set a wooden post called vatan kh\u00e1mb about five inches thick and three or four feet long. On the top of the post is fixed a small wooden box in which are kept the following lucky articles, a comb, a mirror, a small wooden box containing red powder and another containing yellow powder, a few dry grapes, almonds, and dry dates, and some cocoa-kernel. At each corner of the lid of this box, is a wooden sparrow, and in the middle of the lid is a cocoanut tied on with cotton yarn. Below the box on the floor are five piles each of five earthen jars marked with red green and yellow lines and in the middle is placed a lighted oil lamp. This, which they term the marriage guardian or devak, is the same both at the boy's and at the girl's. Then at each house the family priest takes a piece of yellow cloth, and rolls in the cloth a blade of darbh or sacred grass and a piece of dry date and cocoa-kernel, and ties the cloth to the left wrist of the boy and to the right wrist of the girl. These are called the marriage wristlets or kankans. In the afternoon of the marriage day the bridegroom, dressed in rich clothes and wearing a paper coronet called morm\u00e1rn\u00ed is seated on a horse, and carried to the girl's accompanied by kinsfolk, friends, and musicians. At the girl's some elderly male or female relation of the girl waves a cocoanut round the boy's head, who alights from the horse and takes his seat on a low stool in the booth. The girl's family priest rubs his brow with redpowder, and the girl's father presents him with a new turban and a waistcloth, which he puts on and stands on the stool. The girl is brought from the house and stands facing the boy on another stool, with a cloth held between them by two men. Both family priests repeat marriage verses, and, as soon as the verses\nare ended, the guests throw red rice over the pair's heads and the musicians play. Then the girl followed by the boy goes six times round the post. At each turn the family priest asks the guests if they know anything against the marriage, Do the family stocks not suit, or have the boy's and girl's families committed any offence against caste discipline or been guilty of any other misdemeanour. If anything is known against either family the seventh turn is not made until the offender has paid a fine, and if the offender refuses the marriage is stopped until he pays. Cases are known in which even at this seventh round marriages have been finally broken off. When the seventh turn has been taken, the boy and girl sit side by side on two low wooden stools and the sacred fire is lit and fed with sesamum seed, butter, and pieces of *pimpal* Ficus religiosa wood. Then, while the priests mutter verses, the girl's father pours water on the ground in front of the boy, and the girl-giving or *kany\u0101ddan* is over. The girl's relations draw near the boy, wave from 2s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 1-10) each round his head and lay the money in a plate in front of him and this becomes his property. Betel is served and the guests retire.\n\nOn the second day the girl's father gives a dinner to relations and friends, and on the third day a dinner is given at the boy's. On the evening of the third day the bridegroom's parents, relations, and friends with music go to the girl's, and present the girl with a suit of new clothes. Then a cot is set in a room in the house and the pair are seated on the cot. The family priest spreads a sheet before them on the ground and sets seven betelnuts in a line on the sheet. The boy and girl set a lighted lamp close to the betelnuts, throw flowers and rice over them, wave the lighted lamp and camphor and frankincense round them and lay sweetmeats before them. As the boy and girl do this without leaving the cot the ceremony is called *palang\u00e1char* or the cot-rite. The priest unties the lucky wristlets and the *devak* or marriage guardian is removed. The boy and girl are then seated on a horse and carried in procession to the bridegroom's, where the bride is again presented with a robe and bodice and her lap filled with rice, fruit, and a cocoanut. The bride bows before all the elders in the house and before the guests, and presents all married women with turmeric and redpowder. The boy's marriage guardian or *devak* is bowed out and a feast on the next day ends the marriage festivities. When a girl comes of age they hold her impure for four days, and on any lucky day within the first sixteen, the boy and girl are presented with new clothes, and seated near each other on low wooden stools. The girl's lap is filled with grain and fruit, and the ceremony ends with a dinner to near relations. They burn the dead and mourn ten days, with almost the same rites as those of local Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They are bound together by a strong caste feeling. They keep their boys at school till they are about fourteen years old, and are fairly off.\n\n*Bh\u00e1tias.* Bh\u00e1tia's are returned as numbering 143 and as found in B\u00e1rsi and Shol\u00e1pur. They have come from Cutch probably through Bombay since the beginning of British rule. They are stout and healthy and the men wear the top-knot and moustache. Their home tongue is Gujar\u00e1ti and out of doors they speak Mar\u00e1thi. They live in houses of the better sort with metal vessels, and\nservants, cattle, and ponies. They are strict vegetarians, and among vegetables avoid onions and garlic, and spend on caste feasts about \u00a35 (Rs. 50) for every hundred guests. Both men and women keep to the Gujar\u00e1t dress the men wearing their peculiar double-peaked turban, and the women the petticoat, open-backed bodice, and upper scarf or odhni. They are sober, thrifty, hospitable, hard-working, and well-to-do. They used only to sell tobacco, now they are traders, dealing in grain, oil, and butter, and also acting as moneychangers and moneylenders. They are Vaishnavs, have images of their gods in their houses, and employ Gujar\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmans as priests. After childbirth a Bh\u00e1tia woman remains impure for a month and a quarter if the child is a girl and for a month and a half if the child is a boy. On the sixth the priest draws a cradle on a piece of paper and pastes it to a wall in the lying-in room and offers it sandalpaste, flowers, and cooked food in the name of Chhati or Mother Sixth. In the evening the child is presented with clothes, and, when the guests leave, each is given 6d. to 1s. (4-8 as.). They name their children on the sixteenth and cut their hair when they are five years old. When seven years old the boy is taken to the priest\u2019s house and is there girt with the sacred thread.\n\nTheir marriages are preceded by betrothals, they rub the boy and girl with turmeric at their houses, raise an earthen altar in the girl\u2019s marriage booth, set earthen jars at its four corners, and pass a thread round them. A sacred fire is lit, and when the boy and girl have walked four times round the fire they are husband and wife. They burn their dead, the corpse-bearers being helped on the way by other mourners. They mourn ten days, on the eleventh day wheat flour balls or pinds are offered to the deceased and thrown in a running stream. They feast Br\u00e1hmans on the twelfth, and their castefellows on the thirteenth. They do not allow widow marriage and settle social disputes by a caste council. They send their boys to school and are a wealthy rising class.\n\nGujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis are returned as numbering 2506 and as found over the whole district. They are believed to have come into the district within the last two hundred years and are divided into Humbads, Khad\u00e1its, L\u00e1ds, Mods, N\u00e1gars, Porv\u00e1ds, and Shrim\u00e1lis, each of which is again divided into Das\u00e1s and Vis\u00e1s. The main divisions neither eat together nor intermarry, and the subdivisions eat together but do not intermarry. Their home tongue is Gujar\u00e1ti, but most of them can speak pure Mar\u00e1thi like Br\u00e1hmans. It is sometimes difficult either from their look or their talk to tell a Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00ed from a Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hman. Their houses are of the better sort and they have a variety of metal vessels. They are vegetarians, living on rice, wheat, butter, pulse, vegetables, sugar, and milk, and they often prepare sweet dishes of wheat balls and cakes. They eat butter in large quantities, and their caste feasts cost them over \u00a34 (Rs. 40) the hundred guests. The men dress like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, and the women either like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hman women in the full robe and backed bodice or in Gujar\u00e1t fashion in a petticoat or lunga, an open-backed bodice, and an upper robe or odhni. They are clean, neat, sober, frugal, and hardworking, and are shopkeepers, moneylenders, merchants, and petty dealers. On the sixth day\nafter the birth of a child they worship the goddess Chhati or Mother Sixth, name their children on the twelfth, and shave their heads when they are between one or two months old. They marry their girls before they are twelve, and, as they have to pay large sums to the girl\u2019s parents, they do not marry their boys till they are between fifteen and twenty-five. Widow marriage is forbidden. Their priests are Gujar\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmans and they have images of their gods in their houses. They settle social disputes at caste meetings and keep their boys at school till they learn to read and write a little and to cast accounts. They are a well-to-do class.\n\nKa\u2019shika\u2019pd\u00eds are returned as numbering 105 and as found only in B\u00e1rsi and Shol\u00e1pur. They are wandering beggars and petty dealers of Telugu extraction but they cannot tell when and whence they came into the district. They have no subdivisions. They speak Telugu among themselves and broken Mar\u00e1thi with others. They are dark, tall, and regular featured, and their young women are pretty. They live in poor houses and their staple food is millet, pulse, and vegetables. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. They dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the men in big loose turbans, coats, waistcoats, waistcloths, and shoes; and the women in the full robe and backed bodice. They are a hardworking, thrifty, and orderly people. Besides begging they sell sacred threads, necklaces of basil and rudr\u00e1ksh beads, sandal grindstones, dolls, small metal and wooden boxes, looking glasses, metal ladles, and glass beads. They are religious worshipping all Hindu gods and goddesses. Their priests are Telang Br\u00e1hmans to whom they show great respect. Their family deities are B\u00e1l\u00e1ji of Telangan, Bhav\u00e1ni, and Durga. They keep the usual Hindu fasts and festivals and believe in witchcraft soothsaying and sorcery. They marry their girls before they are ten, and their boys before they are twenty. They allow child and widow marriage and practise polygamy. They burn their dead and mourn ten days. They hold caste councils, send their boys to school for a short time, and are a poor people.\n\nKomtis\u00b9 are returned as numbering 2295 and as found over the whole district except in S\u00e1ngola. They are said to have come for trade purposes within the last two or three hundred years from the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak, Penguthpattan, and Telangan. They say they had once six hundred family stocks or gotras but that the number has dwindled to one hundred and one. The story of the decline in the number of family stocks is that once a lowcaste king wished to marry a beautiful Komti girl Kanika of the L\u00e1bhhshatti family. The girl refused his offer and the king sent an army to bring her by force. Kanika agreed to come but asked that she might worship her family goddess. Her wish was granted. She bathed, kindled a great fire, walked round it several times, and threw herself in. Men of a\n\n\u00b9That several distinct classes are known by the name of Komti suggests that Komti is a country name corresponding to Gujar meaning a Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1ni or to M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri meaning a M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1ni. The home of the Komti V\u00e1nis must be in the Telugu country. The similarity in sound suggests Komometh about 120 miles east of Haidarabad. It seems probable that the name K\u00e1m\u00e1thi is in origin the same as Komti.\nhundred and one families, each after offering a fruit or a vegetable to Nagareshvar the village god, leaped after her into the fire. The 499 other families joined the king's army and lost caste. The order in which the 101 devotees followed Kanika is preserved by the number of dough lamps which the members of the different family stocks burn when they worship Kanika, and a trace of the offering of a flower or a vegetable to Nagareshvar remains in the rule under which the use of some one fruit or vegetable is forbidden to the members of each family. The one hundred and one families are known by the name of Yaggin-v\u00e1ndlus or the injured and the remaining four hundred and ninety-nine by the name of Yagganv\u00e1ndlus or the disgraced. A section of the 499, found in Madras but not in Shol\u00e1pur, are known as Rep\u00e1kv\u00e1ndlus who eat fish and drink liquor. Of the one hundred and one family-stocks only eight are found in Shol\u00e1pur, Buchankula, Chedkula, Dhankula, Gundkula, M\u00e1satkula, Midhankula, Pagadikula, and Pedkula. The members of these family stocks eat together but do not intermarry. The L\u00e1bhshattis, Kanika's family, have died out. Their memory is said to be preserved in L\u00e1bh the traders' name for the first measure. The commonest names among men are Bhumaya, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, Narsaya, Sangaya, Viraya, and Vithu; and among women Ganga and Vitha. Men add appa or aya that is father, and women amma or mother to their names. Komtis are tall and thin and proverbially black; as black as a Komti is a common phrase for a dirty child. The men wear the top-knot and moustache and sometimes whiskers but never the beard. Their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi, very few speak Telugu. Most live in houses of the better class one or two storeys high with walls of mud, stone, or bricks, and tiled or flat roofs. If there are cattle in the house a servant is kept and including food is paid 6s. to 10s. (Rs. 3-5) a month. He also serves as a shopboy. They own cows, bullocks, she-buffaloes, and horses. Their house goods include copper brass and wooden boxes, stools, corn bags, cradles, handmills and stones, dinner plates, cots, bedding, carpets, and blankets. They are vegetarians, and their staple food is millet, rice, pulse, and vegetables. Their holiday dishes are spiced milk and gram cakes. They employ Br\u00e1hmans to cook their caste feasts, wear silk or woollen waistcloths when at their food, and dine from separate dishes. The ordinary monthly food expenses of a household of five, a man his wife, two children, and one relative or dependant, living well but not carelessly, would be \u00a31 to \u00a31 12s. (Rs. 10-16). Both men and women dress like Deccan Br\u00e1hmans. The chief peculiarity is that the women wear a nosering adorned with a bunch of small pearls. Some women wear gold bead and pearl wristlets, and other head ornaments shaped like the sacred bel leaf, and rub their faces with turmeric. They keep rich clothes in store.\n\n---\n\n1 These and other estimates of monthly cost of living are framed on the basis that the family has to buy retail the grain and other articles it uses. The actual cash payments of the bulk of the middle and lower orders who either grow grain or are wholly or partly paid in grain must therefore be considerably less than the estimates. The figures mentioned in the text are not more than rough estimates of the value of the articles which under ordinary circumstances the different classes of the people consume.\nfor great occasions. A family of five spends about \u00a34 (Rs. 40) a year on clothes. As a class Komtis are hardworking, forbearing, sober, thrifty, even-tempered, and orderly. Most of them are grocers, dealing in spices, salt, grain, butter, oil, molasses, and sugar. They also trade in cotton, hemp, and oil seeds. A few are money-changers and lenders, writers, and husbandmen. Their women, besides looking after the house, help their husbands both in the field and in the shop, and also grind and clean split pulse. Boys of ten or twelve and over help their fathers in their work. Those who have no capital serve as shopboys at \u00a31 10s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 15-20) a year, and in time either join their masters as partners or open new shops generally beginning by selling spices. Komtis complain that the railway has broken down their profits and made them poor. In spite of their complaints they are in easy circumstances, able to borrow at twelve per cent a year. They claim a higher position but rank with Vaishyas. They eat from Br\u0101hmans only, and say that they are Br\u0101hmans and have a right to perform the sixteen sacraments or sansk\u0101rs according to the Veds. Deccan Br\u0101hmans do not admit their claim and say they are Shudras. The Komti trader rises early in the morning, opens his shop, and sits in it till late at night. The women, besides minding the house, help in the shop, and the children attend school. Komtis are a religious people, and worship the usual Br\u0101hmanic gods and goddesses. Their family deities are B\u00e1l\u00e1ji, Kanyakadevi, Nagareshvar, Narsoa, R\u0101jeshvar, and Virbhadra, all of whose chief shrines are in Telangan. All their ceremonies are conducted by Deshasth Br\u0101hmans. They keep the usual Br\u0101hmanic fasts and festivals and make pilgrimages to Benares, N\u0101sik, Pandharpur, and Tuljapur. Their goddess Kanika is or rather lives in a metal waterpot whose mouth is closed with a metal cup. In the waterpot are a betelnut and a piece of turmeric root, and the outside of the pot is marked with red and turmeric lines, and is stuck over with red rice. Each family should have one of such shrines of Kanika and worship her on the full-moons of M\u0101gh or January-February, Ph\u00e1lgun or February-March, Chaitra or March-April, Shr\u0101van or July-August, Ashvin or September-October, K\u0101rtik or October-November, and Paush or December-January. Those who have no Kanika jar in the house worship the god Virbhadra before beginning a marriage. In worshipping Virbhadra an earthen waterpot or chatt\u012b is divided into an upper and a lower half, and a piece of cloth is soaked in oil, twisted into a torch, lighted, and set in the lower half of the jar. The lower half is then placed in the upper half and set on the head of the mother of the boy or of the girl or of both in case neither family has a Kanika jar in their house. With male and female relations they go to the temple of the village god, bow, and return in the same way as they went carrying the jar with the lighted torch on their heads. They then begin the marriage ceremony. Their religious guide or guru is the Shankar\u0101ch\u0101rya, Sv\u0101mi and Bh\u0101skar\u0101ch\u0101rya a pupil of his is also now acknowledged as a guru. They have a separate teacher known as Mokshguru literally the Sin-freeing teacher who repeats verses to the penitent to ensure his salvation. The sin-freeing teacher\nis by caste either a Br\u00e1hman or a Vaishya. If he is a Br\u00e1hman his disciples drink water in which his feet have been washed; if he is a Vaishya he pours a few drops of the water in which his feet have been washed on a pinch of cowdung ashes or bhasm which they eat. A teacher is generally succeeded by his eldest son. If a guru dies without heirs the leading Komtis of a town where at least one hundred family stocks are represented meet and choose a new teacher. The family god of some families is Nagareshvar or the city god a form of Mah\u00e1dev who is found only in cities where there are Komtis of at least one hundred family stocks. His chief shrine is in the valley of the K\u00e1veri. Some Komti men wear the sacred thread, others wear the ling, and others wear both the ling and the thread. The ling is worn as a purifying or diksha rite. A Jangam or Ling\u00e1yat priest cannot claim a ling-wearing Komti as a Ling\u00e1yat. A ling-wearing father may ask a Jangam to invest his child with a ling immediately after birth, but this is done without any ceremony. The child can at any time give up wearing the ling. The son of a ling-wearing father is not bound to follow his father\u2019s practice. Lately in Shol\u00e1pur a ling-wearing Komti died; a Jangam claimed his body, but the other thread-wearing Komtis took it and burnt it with Br\u00e1hmanic rites. So also Komtis assume the sacred thread without ceremony, even without calling a Br\u00e1hman. A father can present his son with a sacred thread at any time before the boy\u2019s wedding. When a Komti father girds his son with a sacred thread the boy goes begging, beginning at his sister\u2019s house, and asking his first alms from his sister\u2019s daughter. Before he leaves their house his sister and her husband pour water over the boy\u2019s hands. Among Komtis a man must marry his sister\u2019s daughter however ugly or deformed she may be. So strict is the rule that if the sister is young the brother must wait until the sister gets a daughter and the daughter grows old enough to marry him. It sometimes happens that the parties do not agree, and a caste meeting is called to settle the dispute. Under no circumstances can the girl be given away without the consent of the boy\u2019s parents. Among Komtis a woman pregnant with her first child is sent for her confinement to her parents\u2019 house. When the child is born a bellmetal plate is beaten, and the midwife sprinkles the babe with a handful of water. The mother and child are washed in warm water, the child\u2019s navel cord is cut, the child is bound in swaddling clothes and laid beside the mother on the cot, and an old shoe is laid under its pillow to ward off evil spirits. Word is sent to the father\u2019s family, who, if the child is a boy, distribute sugar among their relations. The house where the child is born is considered impure for ten days, and that no evil spirit may enter it, a couple of Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans are engaged to repeat verses every evening and are paid about a couple of rupees. Neighbouring Kunbi women, in the hope of getting a bodice or a robe, for ten days pour cold water in front of the house, or a water-carrier is employed to pour buckets full of water, and at the end of the ten days is given a turban. A flower girl hangs a flower garland to a peg near the outer door, and a Jingar pastes a paper and tinsel frame above the door. On the fifth\nor panchvi day the mother's room is cowdunged, the cot is washed and marked with lines of cement and redlead. The mother and child are bathed and laid on the washed cot. At lamplight, square is traced in the mother's room with redpowder and in the square the grindstone or pitda is laid. On the grindstone turmeric and redpowder square is traced, and, in the square, is set a silver or gold embossed plate or pratima of the goddess Panchvi. A little lower than the plate are set packets of betel leaves and five kinds of cooked wheat, dishes of biscuits and fruit, a lamp and two cakes. Oil and a wick are put in the lamp and lighted and on the cakes, cooked rice, pulse, and vegetables are laid. The midwife seats the mother beside her in front of the grindstone and worships the goddess Panchvi calling her to guard the child and its mother during the night. A washerwoman or partin is called, and as Komtis do not touch a washerwoman she is seated in an outer room, is given turmeric which she rubs on her face, and redpowder which she rubs on her brow, and is served with cooked food. The mother bows before her, and the washerwoman if she does not wish to eat the whole of the food, takes at least five mouthfuls and carries the rest to her home. The day ends with a feast. On the fifth day after a birth no married girl of the family is allowed to remain in the house. All are sent to their husband's or kept for the day and night at a neighbour's or near relation's. Any pregnant woman of the family is not allowed to remain in the house for twelve days after a birth. On the satvi or sixth the fifth day ceremony is repeated. On the tenth the whole house is cowdunged, the mother and child are bathed, and the cot is washed and marked with red and white lines, and the bath-water hole is filled, and five pounds or handfuls of rice wheat or jvari are laid in the midwife's lap, and she is paid five copper, silver, or gold coins. On the eleventh the whole of the father's house is cowdunged, sacred threads are changed, and a mixture of cowdung, cow's urine, water, curds, milk, and sugar are drunk by the whole household, and they and their whole family become pure. If the child is a girl she is named on the twelfth day and if a boy on the thirteenth. On the morning of the twelfth male and female relations and the midwife are called to the house. Each kinswoman brings a plate with a hooded cloak or kunchi, a bodice, a handful of wheat, and a betel packet. Seven elderly mothers among the guests have their faces and arms rubbed with turmeric and redpowder rubbed to their brow. In an outer room a cradle is hung to the rafters by ropes or chains, and clothes are spread in it. The mother is called and comes either carrying the child or followed by the midwife with the child in her arms, and takes her seat on a wooden stool near the cradle. Below the cradle a square is drawn and in the square five wheat flour cakes are placed on five flour dishes, five lamps, and five biscuits are placed one near each lamp. Oil and a wick are put on each lamp and they are touched with redpowder and lighted. Wet turmeric is handed to the mother who rubs it on her cheeks and rubs redpowder on her brow. Then each woman guest presents the mother with turmeric, daubs her brow with redpowder, and\ntouching the hem of the bodice with redpowder hands it to the mother and puts the hooded cloak or *kunchi* on the child. When the presenting is over the midwife brings a stone rolling-pin or *varvanta* and taking one of the hoods puts it on the stone and holding the hooded stone in her arms stands near the cradle. A second woman stands on the other side of the cradle facing the midwife. The midwife says, Take Gop\u00e1l, and hands her the hooded rolling-pin, passing it over the cradle. The woman in taking the rolling-pin answers, Give Govind. She then passes the rolling-pin back under the cradle and says, Take M\u00e1dhav. The midwife in receiving the stone says, Give Krishna, and lays it in the cradle. The child is then taken from the mother's arm and treated in the same way as the rolling-pin. A song is sung by the women present and the plates of the women who brought presents are filled with sugar, betelnut, and baked *ju\u00e1ri* grains or *ghugris* which are also handed among children. Then all both men and women are feasted. The chief guest is the child's father, and the chief dish is gram cakes or *paranpolis*. Then money is given to the seven married women as well as to the Br\u00e1hmans who repeated verses during the last ten days. The child is shown to its father and the guests retire. After three months have passed the father's mother takes to the mother's house a present of betelnut, dry cocoa-kernel, *dig*, *god\u00e1mb\u00e1s* or sweet preserved mangoes, cloves, *patri* or mace, nutmeg, betelnut and leaves, bodices for the mother and the grandmother, and a hood for the child. She takes her seat with the grandmother in the mother's room. The mother with the child in her arms takes her seat on a wooden stool, and the father's mother presents the mother with turmeric and redpowder, throws rice over her and her child, and fills her lap with sweet smelling rice. She touches the hem of one of the two bodices and presents the bodice to her and makes over to her the plate of spices. The mother's mother is given turmeric and redpowder and presented with the other bodice. In return the mother's mother presents the father's mother with turmeric, redpowder, betel, and sugar or sweetmeats, and the father's mother goes home. Next day from the father's house kinswomen bring the mother and the mother's mother a present of a robe and bodice, and a hood, a small coat, and a cap for the child. The mother's lap is filled with a cocoanut, a handful of rice, dates, almonds, a betelnut, and turmeric root, and she is taken to the village temple, and, after the god has been presented with a copper and a second copper waved round his head, the mother is placed before him, and with a long bow retires and walks to her husband's. Three, five, or twelve months after this the boy's hair is clipped. On the hair-clipping day, on a low wooden stool set in an outer room of the house a bodicecloth is spread and the boy's maternal uncle sits on the cloth with the child on his lap. The barber clips off the hair and musicians play sweet music that the child may not weep. They leave top-knot and ear tufts, and the barber is given the bodicecloth and some wheat, and a dinner. The child is presented with new clothes and ornaments, and is taken to the village temple accompanied by music, and a packet of betel and\na copper are presented to the god. The hair-cutting ends with a feast to relations friends and a few Br\u0101hmans.\n\nThe thread-girding now forms part of the wedding. They say they used to have a separate thread-girding ceremony and gave it up because of its costliness, as the rule was that all the boy made by begging which was sometimes over \u00a310 (Rs. 100) had to be increased fourfold and given to the priests. Others say they gave up a separate thread ceremony because it was degrading for them as merchants to beg. According to a third account the thread-girding was given up because they rode on bullocks. The Br\u0101hmans said they must give up either the sacred thread-girding or the bullock-riding. They preferred to give up the sacred thread ceremony. Among Komtis girls are married between seven and ten and always before they come of age; boys are married between ten and fifteen. The child\u2019s marriage occupies the parent\u2019s thoughts from its earliest days. In families who have a young daughter the women, in consultation with the men, fix on some boy as a good match for the girl and either the girl\u2019s father or other near male relations are sent to the boy\u2019s house to see if they are willing to take the girl in marriage. The girl\u2019s relations do not go straight to the boy\u2019s house. They go to a neighbour and ask the people if their neighbours think of marrying their boy. The neighbour goes to the boy\u2019s, tells them that people with a marriageable daughter have come to his house, and ask if the boy\u2019s parents wish to get a wife for their son. The boy\u2019s father asks what is the stranger\u2019s name, his home, his calling, and how he is off. If he thinks the answers promising he asks the neighbour to bring his guest to his house to see the boy. The guest comes and is seated on a carpet in the house. The boy is called by his father, and either stands before them or sits beside his father. The neighbour, on behalf of the guest who sits quiet, asks the boy several questions What school he is at and what he learns, and makes him write, read a little, and cast some accounts. The girl\u2019s father retires to the neighbour\u2019s house where he waits till the neighbour brings word that the boy\u2019s father is anxious to see the girl. The girl\u2019s father thanks the neighbour for the trouble he has taken and goes home. The girl\u2019s father tells his house people that the boy is a good-looking youth fair, strong, and intelligent, that he reads and writes well, and that the boy\u2019s people are coming to see the girl. About a week after the boy\u2019s father, with a relation or two, goes to a house near the girl\u2019s and sends word by his host to the girl\u2019s father that the boy\u2019s relations have come and wish to see the girl. Either the girl\u2019s father or some one from his house goes to the neighbour and brings the boy\u2019s relations to the girl\u2019s. They are seated on a carpet and the girl is called by her father, and the neighbour asks her what her name is, her mother\u2019s name, how many brothers and sisters she has, makes her walk a little in front of them, and, when she has gone a little way off, calls her gently by her name to see if she is quick of hearing. Then if the girl is under seven she is stripped, if she is ten or more, her bodice is taken off and the hair on her back is examined, for if the hair grows in the form of a snake or gom the boy\u2019s father will die within a year of the wedding. When they have seen the girl they leave,\nsaying they will let the girl's father know their intentions. After consulting the people of their house and other relations, the boy's father sends word in a week or so they will come to settle the marriage dates. On the day fixed the boy's maternal uncle is sent for, and with the boy's father and some elderly married women, goes to the girl's house taking a plate with a robe and bodice, redpowder, and a packet of sugar cakes. At the girl's the men are seated outside and the women go into the house. The girl's family priest who has by this time come, sits near the men. The two fathers hand the priest the boy's and girl's horoscopes and he examines them. If the horoscopes agree each of the fathers gives the priest a handful of betelnuts and a half-anna, and the priest calls the girl. When the girl comes, she takes her seat near the priest, and the boy's father touches the girl's brow with redpowder and hands her the robe and bodice. She goes into the house and puts on the clothes and comes and takes her seat as before near the priest. The boy's father hands her the packet of sugar cakes, and she bows first before the priest, then before the boy's father, and then to the rest of the guests. She walks into the house followed by the boy's maternal uncle, who asks the woman who came from the boy's house if she has seen the girl. The woman looks closely at the girl and says, She looks a nice good girl who is certain to manage her husband's house well. The girl's mother then presents the woman with a handful of betelnuts and she and the boy's father and uncle withdraw. Next day the girl's father and maternal uncle go to the boy's house to fix the marriage dates. When they are seated, the boy's father tells the neighbour, who serves as go-between, to ask the girl's father how much he will give in cash or hunda, how much in clothes or karni, and how much in metal vessels. The girl's father is taken outside and the neighbour tells him the boy's father wishes that his son should have \u00a350 (Rs. 500) in money and as much in clothes. The girl's father says he cannot afford to give so much, but is willing to give \u00a310 (Rs. 100) for each. The boy's father is told by the go-between that the girl's father will give \u00a315 (Rs. 150) in cash and the same in clothes. The boy's father says No, the girl's father must give at least \u00a340 (Rs. 400) under both heads. The girl's father says, I wish I could but am too poor. I will give \u00a330 (Rs. 300) in all, if the boy's father does not agree to this I must put off my daughter's wedding. When the boy's father hears that the girl's father will give no more than \u00a330 (Rs. 300) he comes to terms, and agrees to take \u00a330 (Rs. 300), \u00a315 (Rs. 150) in cash and \u00a315 (Rs. 150) in clothes. The girl's father is told that the boy's father agrees to the terms, and he is called in and takes his seat as before. An elder calls on some one to bring a paper and pen and draw up a list. If the families and parents do not belong to the same village the question arises where the wedding is to be held. After some talk it is generally settled that the boy's party should go to the girl's village. Then the list is made out. At the top of the list comes the name of the family god, the names of the boy's and girl's fathers, their villages and the list of articles to be presented to the girl and her parents and relations. The ornaments generally include for the hair five gold\nChapter III.\n\nPeople.\n\nTraders.\n\nKomitis.\n\nflowers or phuls, two gold tassel cups or gond\u00e1s, chandrakor or gold half moons, kevd\u00e1s, belp\u00e1ms or gold bel leaf and rakhdis for the ears b\u00e1l\u00eds or earrings; for the nose a nath; for the neck sari\u015b, necklaces of putlis and jarem\u00e1ls; for the wrists p\u00e1tlis and k\u00e1nkans; for the ankles s\u00e1nkhlis or chains, v\u00e1l\u00e1s, and painjans. The clothes include a silk robe or s\u00e1di, ten small robes or chirdis a gold-bordered bodice, a turban, a shela or shouldercloth, and a bodice and robe for the girl\u2019s mother and bodices for near relations. The number of feasts to be given to the girl\u2019s relations are generally two. They are entered in the list and the following presents which the girl\u2019s father has to give the boy, and the boy\u2019s parents and relations to the boy\u2019s father: \u00a315 (Rs. 150) in cash, two turbans, a waistcloth, a gold-bordered silk waistcloth, a broadcloth coat, a turban, and shouldercloth, to his mother a robe and bodice, and bodices to female relations. Three feasts are entered to be given by the girl\u2019s parents to the boy\u2019s parents and relations. The list containing the girl\u2019s presents is signed by the boy\u2019s father and handed to the girl\u2019s, and the list with the boy\u2019s presents is signed by the girl\u2019s father and handed to the boy\u2019s. Betel is served and the meeting is over. At both houses stores of ornaments, clothes, supplies of grain, butter, sugar, betelnuts, and spices are laid in and a wedding booth is built. If the relations live in another village cards are sent to them, asking them to the marriage of their child at the place and time fixed. Not every one that is asked comes. Those who come arrive a day or two before the marriage. If the marriage is to take place on a Sunday, the guests come on Friday evening. No special dish is prepared for that evening, but instead of jv\u00e1ri cakes they get wheat cakes or polis. If the boy\u2019s relations go to the girl\u2019s village for the marriage, they do not go straight to the village, but, halting two or three miles off, send word to the girl\u2019s father that the boy and his relations have come and have halted. The girl\u2019s father with music and kinspeople brings them to the village, and settles them in a lodging which he has hired for them. The day before the wedding from both houses a married girl, taking a plate with gram flour, turmeric, redpowder, and oil, goes to the houses of several married women whose husbands are alive, called tel-sav\u00edsins, lays a little gram flour, turmeric, and redpowder, and pours a little oil on the threshold, and walking into the house and setting the plate before the woman to be asked, says \u2018To-day a feast of married women is held at our house. Be pleased to come.\u2019 The woman who is asked takes a pinch of the gram flour, turmeric, and redpowder out of the plate, to show she accepts the invitation, and the girl goes to another house. In this way she asks five married women. At the other houses she does not present the oil and turmeric or tilkiska, but simply powders the doorway, and, going into the house, asks them to come for the feast. After going to all the houses she returns home. This is done both at the bride\u2019s and at the bridegroom\u2019s houses. The Br\u00e1hman priest, the astrologer, and other Br\u00e1hmans come and are seated on mats or blankets. Then either in the marriage hall or on the house verandah four stools are set, three in a line and the fourth for the\npriest close by at right angles to the three. The father comes dressed in a silk waistcloth and with a shawl either thrown round his shoulders or tucked under his right arm. The mother comes in a rich silk robe and bodice, and the child in the usual cotton clothes, and they seat themselves on the three stools, the father next the priest, the mother on the father's right, and the boy or girl beyond her. The priest touches their brows with redpowder and repeats verses. Then in the name of, that is as a shrine for, Varun the water god a brass waterpot or kalash is filled with cold water, and in it are dropped a copper coin, some rice and a betelnut, five betel leaves are spread on the top, sandal lines are drawn on the outside, and flowers and rice, sugar, five packets of betelnuts and leaves, and a copper coin are laid before it. Then in the name of Ganpati, that is as a shrine for Ganpati, the priest takes a leaf plate, lays in the middle of it about a pound of rice, and sets a betelnut on the rice, and lays before it flowers rice and sandal. In front of the betelnut are laid a dry cocoa-kernel filled with molasses or gulkhobre, five betel packets, and eleven coppers. After the worship is over, the astrologer takes away the betelnut Ganpati and the priest takes away the waterpot Varun. Then a potter or Khumbh\u00e1r comes bringing about twenty-six earthen pots all white-washed and marked with red lines, of which six are lids or yelmis properly velmis. He places the twenty pots and five of the covers under a cover in a corner, and he places a pot and a cover near where the boy and his parents are sitting. The priest takes a new winnowing fan and places in it the earthen pot which was set near the boy and his parents. In the pot he places the betelnut and a piece of turmeric root rolled round with thread, and on the fan near the pot are laid a new bodice and robe, a cocoanut, and nine betel packets, and four copper coins are laid before the fan and worshipped. The hems of the mother's robe and of the father's shawl are knotted together, they rise from their seats, the father takes the earthen pot in his hands and the mother the fan, and they lay them near the family gods. A lighted brass lamp is set close by and fed with oil. The girl's maternal uncle unties the knot in the father's and mother's clothes, and they go and sit as before near the family priest. The five married women now go to the girl's parents and are seated on wooden stools. The girl's mother offers them turmeric and redpowder and the lap of each is filled with wheat or rice, a betelnut, and a copper coin. This ends the worship and the priest retires. Then two handmills are washed and rubbed with turmeric and redpowder. Round the neck of each of the grindstones a turmeric root and a few grains of rice are tied in a piece of cloth. Turmeric is put in one of the mills, ground into powder, and taken in a brass dish mixed with oil and wetted with cold water, and rubbed on the girl except on her head. Then the girl and her father and mother are made to stand in a line on wooden stools at one corner of the marriage hall and five waterpots are set round them and a thread is passed five turns round the pots. The five married women then bathe the girl and her parents and they go into the house. Some wet turmeric is put into a brass cup, and set in a plate along with\na handful of *chikni* betelnut, and, with male and female relations and music, is taken to the boy's. As part of the procession two married women carry on their heads two copper waterpots or *gh\u00e1gars* whitewashed, marked with red lines, and filled with cold water. At the boy's house they are seated on a carpet in the marriage hall, and the boy comes out and sits on a low wooden stool, and the turmeric powder brought by the girl's relations is rubbed on his body either by his sister or by the five married women or *sav\u00e1sins*. If a rupee is dropped in each of the waterpots brought by the girl's relations, the women who brought the pots on their heads keep the rupee and make over the pots to the boy's relations. If instead of a rupee, only two bodices are given, the pots are taken back with the bodices, after the water is poured out. The boy and his father and mother are bathed as at the girl's, and they go into the house and dress. When the bath is over, the girl's relations retire. The five married women and the guests all dine. When dinner is over, the girl's relations and friends start, accompanied by the family priest, to ask guests for the marriage. They first go to the village temple, and setting a few grains of rice mixed with redpowder, a copper, and a betelnut before the god ask him to attend the marriage. They then go to the houses of relations. When they enter a house, they call the house owner by name, and, when he comes, the family priest gives some grains out of the rice cup into his hands and he stands with joined hands, while the girl's father also with joined hands asks him to his house for the god-pleasing, and boundary worship, and for his daughter's marriage. The head of the house, whether he means to come or not, says *Bare*, Very good. When they have asked all the guests they return home. The same is done at both the bride's and the bridegroom's. Then the women, accompanied by the priest's wife, go round asking the women guests and with the same forms as the men. About lamplight time from the girl's house word is sent to the men and women guests that everything is ready for starting. When the guests come both men and women go in procession with the priest, his wife, and music to ask the god. They first go to the boy's house, and, standing at some distance, send word to the boy's party that the girl's father is waiting for them; the boy's party if they have not already started, start now, and, meeting the girl's party, both go to the village temple, lay red rice, a betelnut, and copper coins before the god, make a bow, and retire, the boy's party to the boy's house and the girl's party to the girl's house. About nine at night the girl's male and female relations, accompanied by their family priest and music, with a plate containing a turban, a waistcloth, flower garlands and a nosegay, a cocoanut, a little sugar and honey, a pot full of water, betelnut and leaves, cash and sandal and redpowder, go to some house or temple where there is a large empty space, and send a horse with music to the boy's house. The boy's father, taking betelnut, leaves, and cash seats the boy on horseback, and, with relations and friends, goes to the place where the girl's relations are assembled. The boy is first seated in the midst of the assembly and the other guests take their\nseats. Then the boy and the boy's priest move to where the girl's priest is seated. The girl's priest calls to the girl's parents, and the girl's father sits in front of the boy and the girl's mother stands to the left of her husband. The girl's father unwinds a couple of turns of his own turban, and hangs it round his neck, letting the gold end fall down his back. A pinch of rice is laid on the carpet before him and a betelnut is set on the rice, and the father worships it. Then a plate is laid before the boy, who puts his feet in the plate and the girl's mother pours water over his feet and the girl's father washes them. Then the girl's father pours milk, curds, honey, sugar and butter over the boy's feet, the mother pours water, the father rubs them, and the girl's mother wipes them. The girl's mother traces a square with redpowder round the boy's feet and makes a round dot or *thipka* in the middle of the square. The girl's father rubs sandal on the boy's brow, worships him as the god N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and gives him a rich waistcloth and turban to wear, throws flower garlands round his neck, sets a bunch of flowers in his turban so that they fall over his right cheek, offers him a pinch of sugar which he eats, and gives him the cash allowance or *hunda*. Then the girl's parents retire. The girl's and boy's father or their near relations distribute money among Br\u0101hmans and betel packets are handed both among male and female relations. If the boy's mother has come, her lap is filled by the girl's mother with rice and a cocoanut, and the other women are given half a dry cocoa-kernel filled with molasses. This is repeated by the boy's mother, and again the women guests are given dry cocoa-kernel and molasses. All prepare to start. Fireworks are let off, they return to their homes, and the day's ceremony is over. On the morning of the marriage day the boy's father and mother, with kinspeople, friends, and music, taking with them a bodice and robe, rice, dry cocoa-kernel, turmeric roots, almonds, betelnuts, and dry dates, silver anklets, gold wristlets, and a necklace or *sari*, go to the girl's house, and are seated in the marriage hall. The boy's priest asks the girl's priest to bring the girl. When the girl comes, she is seated next to her own family priest. The boy's father folds his turban round his neck letting the gold border fall down his back, sets a betelnut on a pinch of rice, and touching his eyelids with water worships the betelnut. The boy's father touches the girl's brow with redpowder and presents her with a robe and bodice, and she goes into the house, puts them on without passing the end of the robe back between her feet, comes out, and takes her seat. A goldsmith comes and decks the girl with ornaments and the boy's father fills her lap with cocoanut, dry dates, almonds, and betelnuts, and the girl walks into the house. Betel is served and the ceremony is over. When the boy's father returns home, the girl's brother and other relations with music go to the boy's. The girl's sister carries in her hands a plate with two lighted lamps in it, and her brother carries a second plate with flower garlands. When they reach the boy's house, they are seated on carpets in the marriage hall. The boy is called, comes dressed, and takes his seat before them on a wooden stool. The girl's brother throws the flower garland round\nthe boy's neck and sets a bunch of flowers in his turban. He is then offered a cup of sugared milk. After drinking the milk he starts on horseback for the girls' with a band of kinspeople and music. The boy's sister, who is called the karavli or best maid, walks behind the horse carrying a lighted brass lamp, whose wick is made of black cotton cloth and not like ordinary lamp wicks of cotton. The procession halts in front of the village temple, when the boy alights, and placing a copper and a packet of betelnut and leaves before the god, goes round the temple once, remounts, and the procession goes on. When it reaches the girl's house the girl's brother asks the bridegroom to alight, and he stands facing the door. The girl's mother takes a handful of cooked rice mixed with curds, waves it round the boy's head, and throws it to the boy's right. A servant from the girl's house takes a cocoanut and waving it round his head dashes it in pieces, and throws it to the boy's right and left. Then the girl's mother takes a copper waterpot marked with cement and red lines, fills it with cold water, pours a little of the water on the boy's feet, rubs some on his eyes, and throws the rest on one side. The boy's relations throw a robe over the pot and the girl's mother takes the robe. The boy walks into the marriage hall and stands till the girl's brother asks him to sit on the carpet. Learned Br\u00e1hmans and the clerk and headman of the village are sent for. Meanwhile the girl's father asks the boy to take off his turban, coat, and shouldercloth. When he has done this, the girl's father presents the boy with a rich silk gold-bordered waistcloth. The boy puts it on and sits on a low wooden stool. The priest goes into the house and brings out the girl who is dressed in a rich cotton robe and bodice and loaded with gold silver and pearl ornaments, and seats her on a low wooden stool on the boy's left. Then the priests of both houses sit near, and one of them, taking a sacred thread, repeats verses over it, and hands it to the boy who puts it over his left shoulder so as to fall on his right side. The boy and girl are then seated close to each other on low wooden stools on the earth altar, which is one span high and nine spans square having nine steps behind each step shorter than the step below it. On the top step a ball of earth is laid and in the ball a mango twig is stuck; and before the twig and the ball turmeric and redpowder are laid. Five bamboo or kalak sticks are set round the altar and four more on the top of it, and five millet stalks or kadba bundles are spread over it. Five plantain stems are tied to the five bamboo posts and three to the right of the altar. Three rows of five earthen pots and three covers in each row, are made to the right of the altar and two ranges of five pots each to the left with rice in all five rows. The girl's priest asks the girl's mother to bring fire from the house, and either she or some other married woman brings fire on a plate covered with a bunch of mango twigs and gives it to the priest. The priest gives her a redpowder box, and, she, touching her brow with the powder, takes away the plate. The sacred fire is lit on the altar and the boy feeds it with clarified butter the girl touching his arm. Rice is cooked in a small metal pot over the fire, and the boy and girl leave their seats and go\nand sit as before in the marriage hall on the carpet. A little cooked rice, curds, and honey are put on the boy's and girl's right hands, and they sip them. This ceremony is called *madhupark* or the honey sipping. Their hands and mouths are washed, and the boy's father presents the girl with the ear ornaments called *b\u00e1lis*, necklaces or *thushis*; bracelets called *k\u00e1kans* and *v\u00e1l\u00e1s*, and anklets called *paijans*. She is given a rich gold-bordered robe, and she and the boy are made to stand opposite one another on the altar, with betel packets in their joined hands, and a cloth held between them with a red central square lucky cross or *nandi*. The boy and girl stand touching the cloth with the tips of their fingers, and keeping their eyes fixed on the red lucky cross or *nandi*. Coloured rice is handed to guests and the priests begin chanting verses. As soon as the last verse is over, the guests throw rice over the couple, and they are husband and wife and the music ceases. The boy and girl are seated on the low wooden stools on which they were standing. Five castemen belonging to different family stocks or *gotras* from the boy and the boy's maternal uncle, and the girl's father and maternal uncle, are called and take their seats round the boy and girl. They hold a cotton thread in their thumb joints pass the thread five times round and again four times holding the thread a little below the thumb joints. The thread is cut in two laid in a metal plate, and worshipped by the boy and girl with curds, milk, honey, sugar, and butter. A copper coin, two turmeric roots called *kombs* or *gadd\u00e1s*, and two betelnuts are put over the threads and the two threads are taken and the thread of five strands along with a turmeric root is tied by the Brahman to the boy's right wrist and the thread of four strands round the girl's left wrist with the other turmeric root. These are called *viv\u00e1h kankans* or wedding bracelets. Money from both houses is gathered and handed among Brahmans each of whom gets 1\u00bdd. to 1s. (1-8 as.) and other beggars from \u00bdd. to \u00bed. (\u00bc-\u00bd a.). After the money has been handed, the boy and girl take their seats on the carpet in the marriage hall. The boy and girl put on the clothes they were dressed in before the marriage, and amuse themselves by rubbing each other's faces with wet turmeric. They are then given betel-leaf rolls or *surl\u00eds*. The boy catches one end of the rolled leaf in his teeth and the girl bites off the other end. The girl in her turn catches one end of the rolled leaf in her teeth and the boy bites it off. In like manner dry cocoa-kernel or *k\u00e1tli*, and cloves are bitten. Then a few girls side with the girl and a few boys with the boy and play games of odds and evens or *ekibeki*. The boy holds a betelnut in his closed hands and the girl tries to take it from him, and the girl is given a betelnut which she holds fast in both her hands and the boy is told to take it from her. If the boy succeeds it is well, if not he is laughed at. The guests, including the boy's parents and relations, are given a handful of betelnuts and leaves and retire. The five men of five different family stocks and the five married women or *telsav\u00e1sins*, and male and female relations are feasted at both houses. When the guests begin to dine, the hems of the parents' clothes are tied together. The father takes a\nmetal pot with clarified butter in it and goes pouring it in an unbroken line round the diners. Some Komtis instead of pouring butter, pour water and present the butter to the priest, with uncooked rice or *shidha*. In the presence of the guests the boy and girl dine from the same plate, and at times feed one another. After they and the guests have dined packets of betelnut are handed round. The boy is taken on horseback to his house by the girl\u2019s relations, the horse is left there, and the girl\u2019s relations return. This closes the marriage day. On the morning of the second day the girl\u2019s father and his priest, taking some boys with them and a silver cup containing red rice and a rupee, go to the boy\u2019s house with music. They are seated in the marriage hall on a carpet and the boy\u2019s father sends for his relations. When they have come and taken their seats, the girl\u2019s father taking wet redpowder daubs the brows of the boy\u2019s father\u2019s priests or *mah\u0101jans*, and of the other guests. A few grains of red rice from the silver cup and the rupee are given to the boy\u2019s father, and the cup is passed round, each guest taking out of it a couple or so of rice grains. When the cup has passed all round, the guests retire, including the girl\u2019s father who returns to his own house. Women from the girl\u2019s house start accompanied by music, taking with them the metal waterpot, a dish, five brass boxes holding red and scented powders, a foot-cleaner or *vajri*, half a cocoa-kernel, and a bodice, and a high wooden stool. When they are seated they place the wooden stool near them and the boy is called and seated on it. The girl\u2019s mother takes a plate and holding the boy\u2019s feet over it, pours water over them, rubs them with the metal foot-cleaner, and wipes them dry with a bodice-cloth. The boy then retires. His mother is called and served in the same way as the boy, and she too in her turn retires. Then the girl\u2019s mother returns to her house, taking with her the boy\u2019s mother and his other kinswomen. The guests are seated in the marriage hall and the boy and girl are seated near them, and they play together rubbing turmeric and scented powders called *haladutne* on one another\u2019s faces. An invitation to dinner is sent to the boy\u2019s father, and he comes in company with those who have received red rice grains from the girl\u2019s father. When they come they are feasted and presented with betel and flowers; sweet smelling oil is rubbed on their hands, and redpowder is sprinkled over their bodies. A woman from the girl\u2019s house goes to invite women guests and returns with them. The boy and girl are seated on low wooden stools in the presence of the women guests, who dine and each party in turn sing bantering verses. The boy and girl feed one another at intervals. The inside is cut out of a cake and some of the bride\u2019s kinswomen, without letting her know, drops the rim round the boy\u2019s mother\u2019s neck either from behind or while she is serving cakes to the guests. If the boy\u2019s mother is a quiet woman, she sets the cake on the ground, if she is playful she takes it in her hands, and, leaving her seat, goes and drops it over the head of some one of the girl\u2019s relations. This feast lasts for over two hours. After dinner they are served with betel in the same way as the men after their dinner and retire with the boy. In the evening comes the *rukhvat* or boys\u2019\nfeast when the girl\u2019s relations with music bring on servants\u2019 and kinswomen\u2019s heads, metal plates filled with sweetmeats, toys, birds, and fruit, and a high paper stool or chaurang with paper cups fastened to it, holding sweetmeats, and, on the middle of the stool, a little stick with gold plumes and flowers. They leave these in the boy\u2019s house and retire. On the third day comes the s\u00e1da or robe ceremony. In the early morning, the girl\u2019s father asks the boy\u2019s father to bring his kinspeople and friends for the s\u00e1da or robe ceremony. When they come they are seated in the marriage hall, and the boy and girl play with turmeric and sweet smelling powders. They are then made to stand on low wooden stools in a corner of the marriage hall, five waterpots are set round them, and filled with hot water and redpowder. The five married women pour on the couple water from the five pots and the boy and girl are given dry cocoa-kernel to chew, which they throw on one another after they have chewed. Hot water is brought in a bathing tub and the boy and girl are bathed, rubbed, and presented with new clothes. Then the boy\u2019s father and other near relations stand and are bathed by the girl\u2019s mother, and after their bathing is over the girl\u2019s mother bathes her own kinswomen. The girl\u2019s parents are then bathed by the women of the house, and they, along with the boy and girl and the boy\u2019s parents, sit on low wooden stools in the veranda with their priests and other Br\u00e1hmans. The girl\u2019s father presents the boy with a new dress, and the girl\u2019s mother and father, taking their daughter\u2019s right hand by the wrist, place it in the boy\u2019s hands, telling him to centre his love in her and to treat her kindly. The boy clasps the girl\u2019s hand in his and promises to treat her well. The girl is then in like manner made over to the boy\u2019s parents, who present her with some head ornaments called n\u00e1g gond\u00e1s or venicha s\u00e1y. The boy\u2019s mother and near kinswomen are presented with bodices. Then the boy, seating the bride before him, mounts a horse, and, accompanied by kinspeople, goes to the village temple and from the temple to his house. Before they enter the house a cocoanut is waved round their heads and dashed to pieces. The boy and the girl are seated on a carpet in the house near each other, the girl to the left of the boy. The boy\u2019s priest makes a woman\u2019s face of wheat dough and sticks the back part of it on to a metal pot, or he sticks dough on to a metal pot and cuts a female face in the dough and covers the pot with a robe and bodice, and decks the face with a married woman\u2019s head and neck ornaments. He heaps rice in front of the face and hides the neck ornament called vajrat\u00edka in the rice. The face is worshipped as the goddess Lakshmi. Before her are placed red and other powders, rice, betel, sugar, and 6d. to 10s. (Rs.4\u00bd-5) in cash, and, with a low bow, the boy and girl and the boy\u2019s parents leave their seats. The boy\u2019s father asks the boy what he has brought with him, he answers, the goddess Lakshmi. The girl is asked how she came; she answers, With gold and silver footprints bringing happiness, joy, and plenty to my husband\u2019s home. The girl is then told to see if there is anything in the heap of rice. She searches and says, Behold, I have brought wealth, and takes out the gold ornament. She shows it to the people. They ask what\nit is and she answers a gold necklace. They tell her to bind it round her neck and with the necklace to bind round her neck long life, happiness, and children. She puts on the necklace saying *Tath\u0101stv*, So be it. The boy and girl go before each person present, bow before them, and ask their blessing. Some do not allow them to bow down, some speak kind words, and others, especially the girl\u2019s kinswomen, sad at parting with her clasp her in their arms, weep, and shower blessings on her. The boy and girl return on horseback to the girl\u2019s. A cot is laid in the marriage hall and spread with a carpet. On the carpet are laid in a line twenty-six betel packets each packet holding thirteen leaves, thirteen betelnuts, and a pinch of turmeric. On the thirteenth and the fourteenth packets is laid a ball of wet turmeric. The boy and the girl sit on the cot in front of them, and, taking a piece of cotton thread about twenty feet long, fold it in a hank a foot and a half long, knot it thirteen times, lay two balls of turmeric in the middle of it, and offer it sandal paste, rice grains, and flowers. This thread is called the *mujumdora*. Then the two wedding wristlets or *k\u0101kans* to which the turmeric roots are tied are taken off and laid near the *mujumdora*. Two small pieces of palm or *t\u0101d* leaf and five black glass beads are laid on each of the twenty-six betel packets and worshipped with sandal and rice. The boy\u2019s priest ties the *mujumdora* to the girl\u2019s right wrist, and, so long as her wedded life lasts, it remains on her wrist, and is renewed on every *Samkr\u0101nti* in January. The boy and girl then leave their seats and the twenty-six betel packets, the turmeric powder, the *t\u0101d* leaves, and the black glass beads are sent to families of different family stocks, who hold it lucky and send it round to the members of their family stock. If there are not so many families in one village the betel and beads remain in the girl\u2019s house. The boy and girl go and stand on the altar, and worship the altar and the piles of earthen pots; the girl\u2019s brother presents the boy with a robe and pulls the boy by his shouldercloth, who takes hold of a bundle of millet stalks and jumps down from the altar. The maternal uncles of the boy and girl take them on their shoulders and dance and throw redpowder on one another. This is called *dhend\u0101n\u0101chavine* or the war-dance. When the dance is over the boy and girl are again seated on the altar. Then the girl comes down from the altar, and, sitting on horseback along with the boy, goes to the boy\u2019s house. The girl is given one or two kinds of sweet dishes called *k\u0101navl\u0101s* and *shingad\u016bs*, and distributes them among her friends and relations. When they reach the boy\u2019s house his mother takes the girl by her hand and leads her over the whole house showing the stores and other rooms where pots, grain, oil, and ornaments are kept, stating, at the same time, what each pot or box contains. When this is over the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s parents each at their own house bow out the guardian of the marriage hall and the other marriage gods by throwing red rice over them. The winnowing fan is given to the priest, and the boy\u2019s parents feast the girl\u2019s parents and her other relations. The girl\u2019s father is given a rupee and some rice, and they go to the boy\u2019s house where a feast is held. After they have dined and dressed red colour is prepared and sprinkled on both the men and women guests and they return to\ntheir homes. This finishes the marriage ceremony. About a couple of months after, on a lucky day, the boy and girl are presented with wood and metal toys. These toys are brought with music to the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s houses by the kinswomen of the people who give them. At the toy-giving time the boy is also presented with a turban, and the girl with a robe and bodice. Their marriage expenses cost a boy\u2019s father \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1000-1500) and the girl\u2019s father \u00a350 to \u00a360 (Rs. 500-600).\n\nWhen a girl comes of age a woman takes her to her parent\u2019s house. Then with her parents, relations, and friends she goes to her husband\u2019s house with music, and a plate filled with turmeric and red powders, rice, betelnut and leaves, nutmeg, mace, cloves, and cardamoms, a bodice and robe, and a chaplet of flowers or j\u00e1lid\u00e1nda. When they reach the boy\u2019s house they are seated. The girl is seated on a low wooden stool, and the boy\u2019s mother, from a distance, throws on her wet turmeric and redpowder which the girl rubs on her cheeks and brow and offers to other married women present, who rub it on their cheeks and brows. The boy\u2019s mother lays before the girl a robe and bodice, and the girl goes into some room, and puts them on and again takes her seat. She ties the chaplet of flowers to her brow, and holds in her right hand a sandalwood doll which has a baby doll in its arms. The girl\u2019s lap is filled with about half a pound of rice, betelnuts, almonds, dry dates, and dry cocoa-kernel, and she is given a packet of betel and spices to chew. Other women are offered betel packets, and the girl\u2019s mother and kinswomen go and return with plates full of sweetmeats to the boy\u2019s house. At the boy\u2019s the girl is seated on a low wooden stool in a wooden frame. The guests take their seats and betel is served to them. The girl rubs her palms with wet turmeric, and, without looking behind, plants them on the wall. The guests all retire. The girl\u2019s mother cooks at her house rice, pulse, pickles, wafer biscuits, sugared milk, and sweetmeats, and putting on silk woollen or fresh washed cotton clothes takes the dishes on the heads of married women to the boy\u2019s house. At the boy\u2019s the girl\u2019s mother and kinswomen serve these dishes to the boy\u2019s family and their near relations and friends offer them betel and retire. At night, except that the girl sleeps on a carpet or blanket apart from the other members of the family, nothing special is done. On the second morning the girl\u2019s mother goes to the boy\u2019s with sweet milk, wafer biscuits and pickles, and a fresh flower chaplet or j\u00e1lid\u00e1nda, turmeric, redpowder, almonds, dry dates, rice, cocoa-kernel, and music. When she reaches the boy\u2019s, she calls the girl and seating her in the wooden frame presents her with the three dishes, which she eats with one or two children from the house. When she has eaten the dishes, the girl washes her hands and mouth and sits in the frame. She is given turmeric and red powders, and the flower brow-chaplet, and her lap is filled. The girl ties her old chaplet to the doll\u2019s brow and fills her lap and rubs turmeric and red powder on her cheeks and brow. The mother retires without music and the players go to their homes. On the third day the second day ceremony is repeated. On the morning of the fourth day a plantain stem is tied to each of the four posts of the wooden frame, the girl\nand her doll are bathed in the morning early by the boy's kinswomen, and she is dressed in a new robe and bodice. The girl's mother father and kinspeople bring to the boy's, with music, a turban, robe, bodice, rice, five specimens of fruit, five turmeric roots, redpowder, five betelnuts, five dry dates, and almonds. The boy and girl are seated in the frame on low wooden stools, and the boy's mother taking rice and fruit fills the laps of the girl and of her relations. The girl's mother, going in front of the boy and girl, throws rice over their heads and the musicians play. The girl's father, touching the hem of the turban with redpowder, gives it into the boy's hands. He rolls it round his head, and the girl's mother, touching the hems of the robe and bodice with vermilion, presents them to the girl who retires, puts them on, and again takes her seat. The mother throws flower garlands round the boy's neck, sets a bunch of flowers in his turban, and tying the flower chaplet round the girl's brow fills her lap with fruit. A cocoanut is given to the boy and he lays it in the girl's lap. The guests retire. A few Br\u00e1hmans and men and women guests are feasted. On the fifth day a few Br\u00e1hmans are asked to kindle the sacrificial fire and to dine at the boy's house. When the Br\u00e1hmans come the boy and girl bathe and sit on low wooden stools, and the sacred fire is lit the Br\u00e1hmans and priests repeating verses. When the verses are over the boy and girl are seated near each other on low wooden stools, and their bodies are rubbed with sweet smelling oils and powders, and they are bathed with hot water. Then they are dried and dress in their usual clothes. Then the girl's parents and kinspeople arrive with music, bringing a plate with a turban and a pair of waistcloths, a bodice, and a robe and flowers, including garlands, chaplets, a nosegay, fruit, turmeric and redpowders, dates, and almonds and rice. The men sit in the veranda with the plate before them, and the women go into the house. The boy and girl are called and they sit near each other in the middle of the assembly. The girl's father takes a few grains of rice from the plate, sticks them on the boy's and girl's brows, and throws them over their heads. The girl is handed a little turmeric and redpowder. She rubs the turmeric between her eyebrows and the redpowder a little above in the middle of her brow. The girl's father gives the boy a waistcloth which he puts on, and a turban which the boy rolls round his head. The girl is given a robe and bodice and she retires, puts them on, and again seats herself. A flower garland is thrown round the boy's neck, a nosegay is given in his hands, a bunch of flowers is hung from his turban, and the chaplet of flowers is tied round the girl's brow and her lap is filled. He hands the boy a cocoanut, which he lays in the girl's lap. Then, with a party of kinspeople, the boy and girl go and bow before the village god. The musicians walk first, behind them comes the boy on whose right and left walk two men holding state umbrellas over his head, and a few kinsmen follow. A few paces behind them, also with two umbrellas held over her, timidly walks the young girl partly hiding her face. From the village temple they go to the girl's, and bow before her family gods and the elders of the house. They are given a feast and return to the boy's where a second feast is held. At this feast the\ngirl serves a few of her caste people with butter, and, after they have dined, retires with a packet of betelnut and leaves. About eight at night the girl's relations go to the boy's house with a cot, bedding, pillows, a white sheet, a quilt, and a plate with spice boxes and bags and flowers. On reaching the boy's, the women are seated on carpets, and the cot is laid and bedding is spread in the room prepared for the couple. The boy's sister calls to him and he comes with a turban on his head. A low wooden stool is set near the cot and the boy is seated on the stool. The washing pot or tast is placed in front of the boy and he holds his feet over it. The girl comes near, pours water over his feet, and rubs them with the foot scraper or vajri, dries them, marks his brow with redpowder, and sticks rice over the powder. She throws flower garlands round his neck, hands him a nosegay, and offers him sweet milk. He sips a little and sets it on the ground, and afterwards offers it to his wife when they are left alone. She offers him a betel packet, the women withdraw and the boy shuts the door. For some time, often for hours after, the pair are not left in quiet, young married women and children knocking at the door and telling them to open. Next day the boy and girl are taken to the girl's house, a feast is held, and the boy is presented with a waistcloth. Every day from the fourth to the sixteenth a song is sung especially by the priest's wife in the hearing of the girl. In the third month of a woman's first pregnancy comes the hidden bodice or chorchooli when the girl's mother rubs her arms with sandal, her cheeks with turmeric, and her brow with redpowder, and presents her with a new green bodice which she puts on. This is done stealthily without telling even the women of the house, so that it may not be noised abroad that the girl is pregnant. She is then treated to a sweet dish. In the fifth month of her pregnancy the ceremony is repeated at the boy's house but this time she is openly presented with a green bodice, new glass bangles are put on her wrists, and a feast is held to which near married kinswomen are called. In the seventh month of her pregnancy the ceremony is repeated for the third time. On this occasion she is presented with a new robe bodice and bangles, and with music and in the company of a few near kinswomen goes to the temple of the village god, makes a low bow, and returns home. On her return home a grand feast is given to both kinsmen and kinswomen. From the next day till the ninth month the girl is feasted by turns by both her mother's and her husband's relations, and is sometimes presented with robes or bodices. This is called the dohlejevan or longing-dinner and costs \u00a32 10s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 25-50). Every day the married women of the house sing a song in the pregnant woman's hearing.\n\nChapter III.\nPeople.\nTraders.\nKomtis.\n\n1 These boxes are one for cement, one for catechu, one called chauphula with several holes in which catechu cloves nutmeg nutmace and cardamoms are kept, and a fourth, called pampuda, in which betel leaves are kept. There are also five cotton or silk bags called pishvis in which betelnut, cloves, nutmeg, nutmace, and cardamoms are kept; a waterpot and panchpatra, a foot-cleaner or vajri, a spittoon, a lamp, a washing pot or tast, sweet-smelling flower garlands and nosegays and five peculiarly folded betel packets with spices and small bits of betelnut, and a cup of sugared milk.\nWhen sickness takes a deadly turn the family priest brings a cow with a calf, a miniature silver cow if a live cow is not available. The eldest son or other nearest kinsman lays sandal, rice grains and flowers before the cow, and a ladle full of cold water in which her tail is dipped is dropped into the dying person's mouth. The priest is given 10s. (Rs. 5) as the price of the cow, and a Br\u00e1hman, in a rather loud voice reads some sacred book so as to make the dying person hear what he reads. Presents of grain and coppers are made to Br\u00e1hmans and other beggars, and, on a spot on the ground floor, a blanket is spread. On the blanket the dying person is laid with his face towards the north, and a few drops of sacred water, either water from a holy river or water in which a Br\u00e1hman's toe has been washed, is poured into his mouth. The name of some god is shouted in his right ear, and he is told to repeat it. The eldest son sits by his father, takes his dying head on his lap, and until he draws his last breath, near relations comfort the dying man promising to take care of the children and wife. After death the body is covered with a sheet, and the women sit round weeping and wailing. The men go out and sit on the veranda bareheaded, and one starts to tell relations of the death. The chief mourner hands money to a friend who goes to market and buys what is wanted. When the messenger comes back the mourners busy themselves in making the body ready spreading millet stalks on it. A fire is lit outside of the house where the bier is made ready, and water is heated in an earthen pot. The body is brought out through the regular door by the four nearest kinsmen, and laid on the ground in front of the house. While this is going on the women are not allowed to leave the house. If the deceased leaves a widow, one of the four bearers goes into the house, and tears off her marriage string and wrist cords, takes them away, and burns them with the dead. But it often happens that the widow sees him coming and herself tears them off and throws them at him. If the deceased is a married woman one of her husband's sacred threads is touched with the redpowder from his dead wife's brow, and the other is torn off the husband and carried with the body to the funeral ground. One of the four bearers rubs butter on the dead head and pours hot water over the body. The body is dressed in a silk waistcloth and laid on the bier with crossed hands and feet, and red and scented powder is rubbed on the brow. It is then rolled in cloth and tied all round with twine. If the dead leaves a son the face is left open, if he has no son it is covered. On the body red and scented powder is sprinkled. To one of the hems of the bodycloth the marriage string and mujumdora cord are tied, and to the other end rice and a copper coin. Live coal is put in an earthen jar which is slung in a string and given to the chief mourner who is told to walk in front of the body.\n\n1 The details are: Wooden poles and sticks, cotton cloth, a silk waistcloth, rope, millet straw, basil leaves, flowers, red and scented powder, earthen pots, sandalwood, firewood, 5000 cowdung cakes, clarified butter, a copper coin, a water-pot, a cup and dish, wheat flour, rice, and a leaf plate together worth \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10-15).\nwithout once looking back. Of the men who have come from the house, some follow the body bareheaded repeating R\u00e1m R\u00e1m in a loud voice, and others go back to their houses. Except the men who belong to the same family stock or gobra, and have to observe mourning, the mourners follow the body in their ordinary dress including turbans and shoes and are careful not to touch any of the chief mourners. Among the mourners are the village astrologer or joshi, the family priest or up\u00e1dhy\u00e1, and a barber, all of whom wear their usual clothes. The body is carried at a quick pace, the chief mourner keeping very close in front. Except the wife of the deceased, women follow the body to the burning ground. On nearing the burning ground the bier is lowered and the men rest and change places. They take from the hem of the bodycloth the rice grains and the copper coin and lay them near the roadside and again move on. The chief mourner does not stop but keeps on very slowly without looking behind. At the burning ground a few verses or mantras are repeated and the priest tells the chief mourner to ask the astrologer for leave to shave. The Joshi orders the shaving and the barber, with his clothes on, shaves the chief mourner\u2019s head and moustache. After the shaving is over the mourner bathes and offers wheat flour balls and throws them into the river. The chief mourner again bathes and a funeral pile is raised. First a layer of about a hundred cowdung cakes is made, over it are ranged billets of wood, and firewood, and over the firewood another thick layer of cowdung cakes, and on it the four bearers lay the bier with the corpse. Another layer of cowdung cakes is heaped about the body and the chief mourner, pouring the fire from the earthen jar on the ground, puts pieces of cowdung cakes and stalks of dry ju\u00e1ri over it, kindles them, and puts the lighted fuel in several places below the pyre. Women mourners go and sit at some distance, and the men stay near the body. The body takes about three hours to burn. When the skull bursts the chief mourner walks round the pyre thrice, beats his mouth with the back of his hand, and calls aloud. After the body is completely burnt, such of the male and female mourners as have touched the body or the four bearers, bathe, and then the four bearers take nimb branches and go to the chief mourner\u2019s. At the house of mourning, after the body is taken to the burning ground, the children and the wife of the deceased are bathed by neighbour women and the spot where the deceased breathed his last is cowdunged. When the funeral party returns, the four bearers pluck nimb leaves from the branches in their hands, and spread them on the spot where the deceased breathed his last, and return to their houses. When they reach their home if they have not touched the body, the bearers, or the members of the mourning family they go into their houses. Those who touched the dead or the chief mourners stop in the veranda of their house, and receive from their wives, on the palm of the right hand, a little curds milk and rice-flour which they touch with their tongues and throw away. They do not enter their houses or eat anything until they have seen a star in the evening, when they dine. At the mourner\u2019s house near relations bringing cooked food serve it on a leaf plate and leave it covered with a bamboo basket on the spot where the deceased breathed his last. Food is served to the mourners and\nafter they have eaten the relations return to their houses. In the same evening the leaf plate is removed from the spot by some people of the house, and given to Mh\u00e1rs or M\u00e1ngs. The spot is cowdunged and small stones are laid, and in the middle of the stones an iron lighted lamp, covered with a bamboo basket or dur\u00e1di, is allowed to remain for ten days. On the second day the chief mourner accompanied by the priest goes to the river bank where the dead was burnt with a handful of wheat flour and rice, and a leaf plate folded in a hanging cloth. At the river bank they buy cowdung cakes worth about \\( \\frac{3}{4} d. \\) (\u00bc a.) and the chief mourner bathes, kindles a fire, and cooks rice. He makes a dough ball, and offers it with the cooked rice, bathes, and returns home with the metal plate duly folded in cloth and held as before. When he comes home, a near relation cooks food, and he dines if well-to-do along with a few relations. After dinner, instead of the usual betel packets, the guests are offered only a piece of betelnut to chew and retire. This is repeated till the ninth day. On the tenth, the mourner, accompanied by near relations, goes to the river bank, and after bathing offers as usual wheat-flour balls and rice. The crow is prayed to take the offering. If the crow comes and takes it the deceased is believed to have died happy; if the crow does not come the deceased had some trouble on his mind. With much bowing the dead is told not to fret himself, that his family and goods will be taken care of, or if the ceremony was not rightly done, the fault will be mended. They promise that a number of Br\u00e1hmans will be fed, or that his name will be given to his grandchild. If in spite of all these appeals, the crow does not come till evening, the chief mourner with a blade of sacred grass, himself touches the ball and the cooked rice; the rest of his companions bathe and all retire. On the eleventh day, the whole house is cowdunged, and the vessels are cleaned, clothes washed, sacred threads and women's marriage strings are changed, and a wheat flour ball is offered. Presents of shoes, an umbrella, a staff, a turban, a shouldercloth, a waist-cloth, lamps, and a waterpot are made to the Br\u00e1hman, and two castemen of different family stocks or gotras are feasted and dismissed with a present of \\( 6d. \\) (\u00bc as.) each. On the twelfth day the shr\u00e1ddh ceremony is performed when three wheat flour balls or pinds are offered, and the four bier bearers and two castefellows belonging to different family stocks are feasted. Br\u00e1hmans are presented with the deceased's bedding and metal lamp and money varying from \\( 6d. \\) to \\( 8s. \\) (Rs. \\( \\frac{1}{4} - 4 \\)). On the thirteenth day the chief mourner has his head shaved, a dish of sugar cakes is prepared, and relations and friends are feasted. A cow is presented to a Br\u00e1hman, the mourner marks his brow and the brows of Br\u00e1hmans with red sandal, and they retire to their homes. Their funeral ceremonies cost them \\( \u00a35 \\) to \\( \u00a320 \\) (Rs. 50-200). They are bound together as a body and their social disputes are settled at caste meetings, under their hereditary headman or mah\u00e1jan. Important questions are referred to their chief religious head or guru Bh\u00e1skar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya a Yajurvedi \u00c1pastambh Br\u00e1hman the deputy of Shankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya. He has four monasteries at Bodhan and N\u00e1nder in the Niz\u00e1m's country, near Hampi thirty-six miles north-west of Bel\u00e1ri, and near\nPendgaon Pattan in Maisur. He occasionally visits his followers in Sholapur. The penalty of breach of caste rules is a heavy fine and the sipping of water in which the teacher's toe has been washed. The fine goes to the guru. They send their children both boys and girls to school, and, when able to read and write and keep Marathi accounts, they apprentice them to shopkeepers. They are in easy circumstances.\n\nLingayatVannis are returned as numbering 21,308 and as found all over the district but chiefly in Sholapur. They seem to have come into the district about two hundred years ago. According to the Nandikeshvar Puran, Basveshvar, the founder of the Lingayat sect, was born of a Brahman woman at Bagevadi in Kaladgi, and claiming divine inspiration, founded the Lingayat faith. He established his religion about the middle of the twelfth century at Kalyan in the Nizam's dominions, and he, or rather one of his apostles, is said to have gone to Marwar, and brought back 196,000 converts from Marwar and spread them all over the Panch Dravid country or Southern India. The earliest Sholapur settlements of these Marwari converts are said to have been Kasegaon a village three miles to the south of Pandharpur, Mohol, and Malikpeth in Madha. These towns are now greatly declined and Kasegaon and Malikpeth are in ruins. Their second great centre was Vairag in Barsi which remained a prosperous place until the railway centred trade at Sholapur. Their chief family stocks or gotras are Bhringi, Nandi, Skand, Vir, and Vrishabh. They lay little count on family stocks. Many people do not know their stock, and intermarriage takes place among families belonging to the same gotra so long as the surname is different. The names in common use among men are Baslingappa, Chanbasappa, Gopalshet, Hariba, Kalappa, Krishnappa, Malkarjun, Maruti, Rajaram, Ramshet, Shivappa, Shivlingappa, Vishvanath, and Vithoba; and among women Basava, Bhagirathi, Chandrabhaga, Janki, Kashibai, Lakshmi, Lingava, Malava, Rakhumai, and Vithai. Their commonest surnames are Ainapure, Barge, Bodhke, Galakatu, Karanje, Kare, Korpe, Lokhande, Mahalshet, Rajmane, Samshet, and Shilavant. The surnames have their rise in distinctions of trade, calling, residence, or any notable family event or exploit. Thus Galakatu, or cut-throat, arose from the fact that years ago some member of the family had his throat cut by highwaymen. Whatever their surnames all Lingayat Vannis eat together but do not intermarry. They are a dark, thin, and middle-sized people, healthy and long-lived. They can be easily known from other Hindus by the ash-mark on the brow and by the ling case which they wear. Most speak Marathi both at home and abroad, and some speak Kanarese at home. All speak Hindustani and a few English. Most live in houses of the better sort one or two storeys high with walls of mud and stone and flat mud.\n\n---\n\n1 In connection with this story it is worthy of note that Ujain in Malwa is one of the five chief or lion seats of the Lingayats. At the same time the story of converts brought from Marwar seems unlikely. Perhaps the foundation of the story was the conversion of local Jains who were afterwards confused with Marwaris as most modern Jains come from Marwar.\nroofs, built round an open quadrangle which acts as a shaft for air and light. In the veranda of a well-to-do house is a raised earthen seat or ota large enough for one man to sit on. On this a blanket is spread and the Jangam or Lingayat priest is seated when his feet are washed and the holy water or birti is drunk by the house people. The house goods include cots, bedding, blankets, metal and earthen vessels, stools, lamps, cradles, grindstones, and handmills. Few have servants as Lingayat V\u0101nis seldom take service with any one. They keep cows, bullocks, she-buffaloes, and a few carts and ponies. Their staple food is millet, rice, wheat, pulse, vegetables, and curds. They like hot dishes, and eat chillies as freely as if they were common pot herbs. One of their pet dishes is cooked jv\u0101ri mixed with curds and kept fermenting for three or four days. This they eat with much relish adding a little salt to lessen the acidity and using chillies and oil as condiments. Their caste dinners cost about \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) the hundred guests. The special dish is a k\u0101nji or gruel prepared by cooking wheat in water until the grain bursts through the skin, adding molasses and butter, and again boiling for a short time. They dine sitting on the floor and eat from plates set in front of them on iron tripods or on wooden stools. At their meals they wear cotton or silk waistcloths and do not leave the dining-room till they have chewed betelnut and leaves. They do not allow strangers to see their food and are careful to prevent the sun shining on their drinking water, and to leave no scraps of food after their meals. After every scrap has been eaten they wash the plate and drink the water. Men and women eat off separate dishes and neither a wife nor a husband eats another's leavings. This is because no Lingayat can offer to another's ling the remains of food which has already been offered to his own. To avoid this Lingayats do not allow a particle of food to remain on the plate. Lingayats are strict in avoiding flesh and liquor. They both chew and smoke tobacco. Some use opium and a few drink hemp-water or bh\u0101ng and smoke hempflower or g\u0101nja. The men dress in a waistcloth, a waistcoat, coat, headscarf, and shouldercloth, and occasionally a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 turban, and shoes. They wear the moustache, whiskers, and top-knot but not the beard. The women dress in the full Mar\u0101tha robe and bodice, wear the hair either in a knot behind or allow it to hang in braids down the back. Married women rub redpowder on their brows, use false hair, and deck their heads with flowers. Both men and women mark their brows with ashes, carry the ling in a small metal box, or roll it in an ochre-coloured cloth, tied either in the headscarf, round the neck, round the upper left arm or right wrist, or hanging from the neck down to near the heart, or the navel. They are hardworking, sober, thrifty, and hospitable, but hot-tempered, overbearing, and impatient. They term themselves Virshaivs that is fighting Shaivas. They greet one another with the words Sharan\u0101rth or I submit or prostrate. They are mostly traders dealing in grain, spices, salt, oil, butter, and molasses or sugar. They are cloth-sellers, bankers, moneylenders, brokers, and husbandmen. They apprentice their boys to shopkeepers, the time and pay of the apprenticeship varying according to the trade or calling. An apprentice in a rich firm is paid as much\nas \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15) a month, but the general monthly rate of pay is 8s. to 10s. (Rs. 4-5), and some well-to-do persons have their boys apprenticed to bankers and well-to-do brokers without receiving any pay. The apprenticeship begins between twelve and fifteen and lasts six months to two years. Unless he has his father\u2019s shop to enter after completing his apprenticeship elsewhere, the youth prefers working as an assistant in the shop where he was apprenticed. An assistant is paid \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10-15) a month, and besides his pay gets valuable experience. He learns the little tricks by which customers are beguiled, the vigilance with which inferior articles should be palmed off on customers, and gains an insight into the intricacies of trade. At the end of three or four years he has learned much and probably has laid by a considerable sum. He then begins as a grocer on a small scale with a capital of \u00a320 to \u00a330 (Rs. 200-300) of his own or borrows money from a banker at nine to twelve per cent a year. He deals first in assafoetida, black pepper, cummin seed, pulse of different kinds, oil, coarse sugar, sugar, butter, turmeric, chillies, onions, and garlic. He buys his stock himself in the town from wholesale dealers and sells retail renewing his stock at least two or three times a month. A shopkeeper of this kind with a capital of \u00a320 to \u00a330 (Rs. 200-300) makes about \u00a310 (Rs. 100) a year. As he enlarges his capital he increases his stock and takes to dealing in grain and advancing money to landholders on the security of crops. Some act as brokers a business which does not require capital unless the broker acts as shroff or moneychanger, making purchases on account of orders from outside customers. A good broker earns \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1000-1500) a year and more if he has a fairly large capital. As husbandmen some are over-holders but most take fields from others paying a certain yearly acre cash rent. Their women help them in watching the fields and bringing their meals to their husbands. Though they abuse railways for lowering their profits, they are a prosperous and well-to-do people and have considerable power over the local market. They have credit and at any time can borrow at three to nine per cent. They have no regular position in the local caste list. They eat from no one not even from Br\u00e1hmans.\n\nLing\u00e1yat V\u00e1n\u00ed are a religious people and worship all Hindu gods and goddesses, calling them forms of Shiv. Their family deities are Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i of Tulj\u00e1pur, Banali and Danamm\u00e1i in Jat, Dhana\u00ed in the Konkan, Es\u00e1i, Jan\u00e1i, and Jotiba of Kolh\u00e1pur, Khandoba of Jejuri, Mah\u00e1dev, Malik\u00e1rjun near Vyankoba in Tirupati, Nesai, Rachotivir-bhadra in Giri, Revansiddheshvar in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Sh\u00e1kambari in B\u00e1d\u00e1mi, Siddheshvar of Shol\u00e1pur, Yallamma of Saundatti in Bij\u00e1pur, Vyankoba and Virbhadra, to all which places they go on pilgrimage. Their worship is the same as that of Br\u00e1hmamic Hindus except that they offer their gods neither red flowers nor kevda Pandanus odoratissimus. Their family priest is a Jangam of the rank of a Mathapati or beadle. He is the general manager of all their ceremonies. He issues invitations, walks at the head of processions, blows the conch shell, and is the man of all work in their social and religious gatherings. A strict Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1ni does not respect Br\u00e1hmans and never calls them to conduct his weddings so long as he can find a\nJangam to conduct them. Still in practice they tolerate Br\u00e1hmans, and, after the Jangam is done, allow a Br\u00e1hman to repeat verses and throw grains of red rice or *mantr\u00e1khada* over the boy and girl. The only use they make of a Br\u00e1hman is in finding out lucky days for the performance of ceremonies, and also on the day when turmeric is rubbed on the boy and girl on which occasion he chooses women to rub the turmeric. A Ling\u00e1yat has no horoscope based on the time of his birth, but of late Jangams have learned enough to act the astrologer's part and thus the occasions on which Br\u00e1hmans are needed are becoming fewer. They keep the usual Hindu fasts and festivals, and believe in sorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying, omens, lucky and unlucky days, and oracles. Ling\u00e1yats marry their girls between eight and sixteen, and their boys between twelve and twenty-five. For the redpowder rubbing or *kunkul\u00e1vne* that is the public announcement that a match has been made, the boy's father, accompanied by kinspeople and friends and a Jangam goes to the girl's, and, rubbing her brow with redpowder, presents her with a robe and bodice, and the Jangam fills her lap either with a handful of sugar or a cocoanut. If the girl's father is rich he presents the boy's father with a turban and a dinner closes the day. The next of the marriage observances is the *m\u00e1gni* or public asking. On a lucky day the boy's kinspeople, with a Ling\u00e1yat beadle or *mathapati*, go to the girl's and present her with a robe, bodice, and ornaments. The girl's mother is presented with another robe and bodice and five of her kniswomen with bodices. The girl's lap is filled with five pounds of rice, five dry dates, turmeric roots, betelnuts, plantains, five half-dry cocoa-kernels, and a cocoanut. A dinner and a service of betel packets closes the day. Next day the girl's kinspeople and friends go to the boy's and present him with a turban, and, if well-to-do, with robes and bodices for the boy's mother and kinswomen. The day closes with a dinner. This ceremony is not performed if the boy and the girl belong to the same village. A marriage generally takes place within a couple of years of the asking, and on any day in *M\u00e1gh* or January-February, *Ph\u00e1lgun* or February-March, *Vaish\u00e1kh* or April-May, *Jyeshth* or May-June, *K\u00e1r\u00edk* or October-November, and *M\u00e1rgashirsh* or November-December. A few months before the wedding the boy's relations go to the girl's and fix a month for the marriage. At least five days before the marriage the boy's relations go to the girl's and presenting her and her mother with a robe and bodice, fill the girl's lap with rice, dry dates, a cocoanut, turmeric roots, and betelnut and leaves, and retire. The village Br\u00e1hman is called in and gives the names of five married women who should rub the girl with turmeric. The girl is seated on a low wooden stool and round her are set four metal waterpots. Cotton thread is passed five times round the pots, and the girl is anointed with sweet smelling oil, turmeric powder is rubbed on her body, and her brow is marked with redpowder by the five women. She is bathed and dressed in a new robe and bodice and her lap is filled with rice, and dry cocoa kernel and redpowder are rubbed on her brow. The cotton thread is taken off the four waterpots, a turmeric root is tied to the thread, and it is then fastened round the girl's right wrist. Besides\nthe tying of the turmeric root to the wrist, for five days the girl is anointed, bathed, and her lap filled by the five chosen women. During these days the girl is taken to the houses of near relations and friends and feasted. A couple of days before the wedding day two girls go to the houses of relations and friends with a brass plate containing an oil jar and some turmeric and redpowder. They go to a house, pour a spoonful of oil on the threshold, drop a pinch of the powder over the oil and ask the women of the house to dine with them. On their return they lay on a winnowing fan an allowance enough for one man, and, going to the potter's, make over the contents of the fan to him and receive from him twelve to seventeen big and small earthen jars, which have already been bargained for on promise of a money present or a secondhand robe, return to the girl's and lay the pots in the booth. A couple of men with music go to the forest lands and bring a branch or two of mango, shami, pimpal, and vad, and of other trees if others can be had though if the four trees are not to be had any one of these is enough. They take an earthen jar from those brought from the potter's, fill it with ashes from the oven, and cover it with gram cake. Over the cake is set a lighted dough or clay lamp and it is hung in the booth. The hems of the clothes of a married man and his wife are knotted together, and they sit opposite the ash jar, and with the help of the mathapati or beadle worship the jar by throwing flowers and sandal at it, by waving frankincense and a lighted lamp round it, and by offering it cooked food. The tree branches are hung round the jar. A dinner is given and the parts of the ceremony common to both houses are at an end. A marriage always takes place in the evening or at any time of the night, never after daybreak or before lamplight. The marriage time is fixed either by a Jangam or by the village Br\u00e1hman astrologer. On the marriage day the boy is seated in a litter or on horse or bullock back, and is taken in procession to the village temple of the god M\u00e1ruti with a party of kinspeople and friends with music. A marriage ornament is tied to the boy's brow. He is met by the girl's relations and the two parties throw red and scented powders on each other and are led to the girl's house. At the girl's a woman of her family waves a cake and water round the boy's head and throws the cake on one side to satisfy evil spirits. In the booth is raised an earthen altar covered with a rich carpet on which the Jangam sits and in front of him on another carpet sits the boy. Near the Jangam are laid two trays, one from the girl's house containing a waist and shouldercloth and a turban, the other from the boy's with a robe, a bodice, and ornaments for the girl. The Jangam touches the hems of the different clothes with redpowder and gives them to the boy and the girl. The girl walks with them into the house and comes back dressed in them, and the boy puts them on in the booth. The Jangam or the village Br\u00e1hman fills the girl's lap with grains of rice and with fruit and both take their seats as before facing the Jangam. One end of a piece of five strands of gray cotton thread is held by the Jangam under his feet and the other end by the boy with both his hands, and the boy's hands are held by the girl with both her hands. An enclosure is\nformed with a sheet in which are the Jangam and the boy and the girl. The hems of the couple\u2019s garments are knotted together and the mathapati repeats verses over their joined hands, pours a little water over them, and rubs them with ashes. He throws sandal, grains of rice and flowers over them, burns incense camphor and a lamp before them, and puts a little sugar into the boy\u2019s and the girl\u2019s mouths. He repeats verses, and, at the end, throws grains of rice over their heads, pulls the threads from their hands, throws them on the ground, and orders the curtain to be pulled aside. The couple now turn their faces towards the guests, and the Br\u00e1hmans repeat marriage verses or mangal\u00e1staks and at the end throw rice over the boy\u2019s and the girl\u2019s heads and the musicians play. Money is given to Jangams and Br\u00e1hmans and the guests retire each with a packet of betelnut and leaves. The ceremony of giving away the bride or dh\u00e1ryh\u00e1lne is now performed. The hems of the boy\u2019s and the girl\u2019s clothes are knotted together, and the father taking in his hands a metal pot of red water and the mother a plate, sit in front of the boy and girl. The girl\u2019s mother holds the boy\u2019s feet in both her hands over the plate, the father pours water over them from the pot, and the mother rubs them with both her hands and wipes them dry. The pot and the plate are now the property of the boy and the ceremony is over. The boy\u2019s father presents the girl\u2019s mother with a robe and bodice and her father with a turban and shouldercloth. The ceremony of sheshbh\u00e1rne comes next when women by turns draw near the couple, and each standing in front of them with both hands throws pinches of coloured rice over the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s knees, thighs, shoulders, and heads. Some in addition wave a copper coin over the couple\u2019s heads and give the coin to a Jangam. The couple are now taken before the house gods, make a low bow to them, and retire. Then as a sign of friendliness and good feeling they perform the bh\u00fam or earth offering ceremony, when a large tray filled with various dishes is set in the middle and the boy and girl and their kinsmen sit round it and take a few morsels. Sometimes the men merely touch the tray with their fingers and give the food to children to eat. On the third day comes the rukhv\u00e1t or boy\u2019s feast when the girl\u2019s kinswomen take several cooked dishes to the boy\u2019s on the heads of servants, empty them, and return with the empty pots and baskets. The boy and girl rub one another\u2019s body with turmeric powder and wash one another with warm water. They then play games of odds and evens with betelnuts and bite off rolls of betel leaves from one another\u2019s mouths. Either on the fourth or the fifth evening the boy\u2019s relations are asked to dine at the girl\u2019s. On their way cloths are spread for them to walk on. The girl\u2019s relations carry with them a large jar filled with water, a dish, and strings of onions, and carrots, rags, old brooms, and a broken piece of a whitewashed jar. At times on the way the boy\u2019s mother takes offence and refuses to go further. A wooden stool is set in the street and she is seated on it and the girl\u2019s mother washes her feet, gives her clothes, and asks her to walk on. On the way one of the party takes one of the pieces of the whitewashed earthen jar and asks the boy\u2019s mother to look at her face in the looking-\nglass. Some hold old brooms over her head, and hang strings of onions carrots and rags round her neck. When they reach the girl's house, the women are bathed, new glass bangles are put round their wrists, or, if they are well-to-do, they are presented with robes and bodices. Next day comes the robe or s\u00e1du ceremony when the boy's relations and friends go with music to the girl's house and present her with a new robe and bodice. The girl's parents present the boy with a new waistcloth and turban and the pair dress in the new clothes. Either the Jangam or the Br\u00e1hman priest fills the girl's lap with grains of rice and the boy and girl are seated on a horse or bullock or in a palanquin and with kinsfolk and music go in procession to the boy's. At the boy's they are seated on low wooden stools, and the boy's mother, approaching the girl with a wooden rolling-pin wound in a bodice cloth and smeared with redpowder, calls it a child and lays it in the girl's lap. The girl asks the boy to take it saying she is going to look after the house. She then looks to her father and mother-in-law and husband and says she must have good clothes for her child, and putting the bodiced rolling-pin into her husband's hands, says she is going to sweep the house. After this the boy's parents present the girl's parents with clothes and one of the boy's relations, taking a winnowing fan or a basket, beats it with a stick crying: The wedding is over it is time the guests were taking their leave. Every year on Sankr\u00e1n Day in January and on N\u00e1gpanchmi Day in August the boy's father sends a robe and a bodice to the girl at her parent's house, and the girl's father presents the man who brings the clothes with a turban and gives him a dinner. This goes on so long as the girl remains with her parents. When she is grown up, a few months before she comes of age, the ceremony of ovasa that is home-taking takes place, and from that time the girl lives at her husband's. On the afternoon of a lucky day a party of the boy's kinspeople go to the girl's with robes and bodices for the girl and her mother, and a turban and shouldercloth for the girl's father. They also take rice, wheat, gram, sugar, cocoanuts, and butter with them and go to the girl's house with music. The guests spend the day at the girl's. At night the girl is gaily dressed, and early next morning presents of clothes and grain are made to the girl's parents. The girl is dressed in the new robe and bodice and her lap filled with fruit and grain by the Jangam or the village Br\u00e1hman. She is seated on a horse or bullock, and is taken first to the math or monastery, then to the houses of the great men, and then to those of relations and friends. At each house the Jangam leaves a piece of cocoa kernel filled with sugar, and, on being questioned, the Jangam tells them that the girl is going to her husband's house. They then return to the girl's house where a feast is held, at which gram cakes are prepared. After dinner return presents are made to the boy's relations about the same in quantity and quality as those received by the girl's. A feast is held in honour of the girl and sweetmeats are sent round the villagers' houses.\n\nWhen the girl comes of age she sits apart for three days, on the first of which her parents present the boy and the girl\nwith clothes. On the fourth morning the girl is bathed and the family Jangam throws the dust off his feet on her body and she becomes pure. A bamboo frame is made in the house in which two low wooden stools are set near each other, and, at about eight in the evening, the boy and girl are dressed in new clothes and sit on the stools. The Jangam draws near the girl, fills her lap with fruit and grain, and withdraws. A nuptial room is made ready in which is a cot and bedding, a spittoon, betel boxes, and a lamp. The boy goes in first and takes his seat on the cot, and the girl is pushed in and throws a flower garland round the boy\u2019s neck, places a nosegay and a spiced betel packet in his hands, and the women retire leaving the couple alone.\n\nDuring the first three or four months of a girl\u2019s pregnancy a dinner is given by her husband\u2019s father to which near kinswomen are asked. In the seventh month of her pregnancy another dinner is given and the boy\u2019s parents present the girl with a robe and bodice, and the girl\u2019s parents present the boy with a shouldercloth and turban. The girl\u2019s brow is marked with red-powder and her lap is filled with fruit by a kinswoman or a Jangam. Lingayat V\u0101nis allow widows and divorced women to marry. For a widow\u2019s marriage the widow\u2019s consent is necessary and for a divorced woman\u2019s marriage both her and her husband\u2019s consent is wanted. If a man wishes to marry a divorced woman he applies to the headman of the caste who is called Shetya, who summons both the woman and her husband, and, in the presence of some of the castemen, asks them whether they are willing to separate. If the husband is willing he gives his consent in writing. Then on a dark night the man goes to the woman\u2019s with a few friends among them perhaps a widow or two, as no married woman attends these marriages, and there the couple sit in a room on a bullock\u2019s harness. The Jangam who officiates sits in front of the couple on a blanket or wooden stool. He partly shuts the door, as except the priest and the couple no one should see the ceremony. The Jangam mixes a little milk in butter in a cup and asks the man to drink half of it, which he does, and asks the woman to drink the rest. As soon as they have drunk the mixture the Jangam leaves the room and joins the guests. The guests chew betel and leaves and retire without looking at the couple, who remain indoors and do not let any one see them. Next morning they bathe, rub themselves with ashes, and mix in society as before. For her first confinement a young wife goes to her parents\u2019. When the child is born its navel cord is cut by a Lingayat midwife. If the midwife belongs to another caste, the mother is purified by drinking water in which a Jangam\u2019s feet have been washed. They name their children on the twelfth day after childbirth. In the morning the mother is bathed and dressed in a new robe and bodice. In the afternoon, when the women guests have come, a cradle is hung from the roof in the women\u2019s hall and under it on a handful of rice grains is placed a waterpot. The mother walks with the child in her arms and sits with it on a low wooden stool in front of the cradle. One of the female guests worships the waterpot by the name of the goddess Satvai, throw;\nsandal, redpowder, and flowers over it, waves lighted camphor and frankincense before it, and offers it sugar. After the worship is over such of the female guests as have brought presents of clothes present them to the child and mother. A few women sit on either side of the cradle and one of them taking the child in her hands passes it under the cradle to the woman on the other side repeating, Take Gopichand or Govind, if the child is a boy, and Take Ganga or Bh\u00e1girathi, if the child is a girl. The women on the other side take the child without saying anything and in their turn pass it from above the cradle saying, Take Harichandra or R\u00e1mchandra. This is repeated three or four times and in the end the child is laid in the cradle. With the consent of the child\u2019s parents the name generally of some deceased relation is chosen and repeated three or four times in the child\u2019s right ear ending each time with a kur-r-r-r. As soon as the last word is uttered the other women guests slap the woman\u2019s back or give her some blows. Several of the married women are given red and turmeric powder which they rub on their brows and cheeks, get a handful of boiled or soaked wheat or gram, and retire. Before they go the door is closed, and, before she is allowed to leave, each woman has to introduce her husband\u2019s name into a couplet. The day ends with a feast to near relations. The ling-girding or Lingdh\u00e1rna, takes place on the fifth day after a child\u2019s birth. In a ling-girding the Mathapati or beadle, the Sth\u00e1var resident, the Deshantari, the Math Gan\u00e1ch\u00e1rya or manager, and the Guru or teacher should take part. But as the Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis cannot keep up all these priests the Mathapati or beadle and the Deshantari or head of a religious house serve the purpose. On the morning of the fifth the whole house is cowdunged, and the mother\u2019s bedding and clothes are washed. The Mathapati and Deshantari bring a ling, and, after rubbing it with a mixture of molasses and cement, place it in a metal plate, and bathe it first with the five nectars or panch\u00e1mrits milk curds honey sugar and butter, and again with the five cow gifts or panchgavya urine dung curds milk and butter, then with water, again with lime and sugar, and once more with water. It is marked with sandalpaste, rice tulsi leaves and flowers are laid on it, camphor and frankincense are waved round it, a few drops of water in which a Deshantari\u2019s feet have been washed are poured over it, and a mixture of sugar, sugarcandy, dates, cocoa-kernel, almonds, and dry grapes are laid before it. The ling is folded in a piece of white cloth and tied round the child\u2019s neck. The fee charged for the performance of the ceremony is either 4\u00bd d. or 8\u00bd d. (2\u00be-5\u00bd as.) for a boy, and 1\u00bd d. or 4\u00bd d. (1\u00bc-2\u00bd as.) for a girl, and this fee is divided in the proportion of six to five the larger share going to the Mathapati.\n\nWhen a Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1n\u00ed is on the point of death money is distributed among Jangams. After death the body is bathed in cold water, wiped dry, and rubbed with ashes. Earth is heaped in the veranda into a raised seat and the dead is seated on it leaning against the wall, with his head tied to a string hung from a peg in the wall or to the ceiling. The body is dressed in its every-day clothes, and the Mathapati, sitting in front of it, lays sandal paste flowers and burnt\nfrankincense before it, and the ling which hangs from the neck. Over the body and the ling the Mathapati throws belleaves, flowers, sandal, water, and ashes, and burns incense and camphor before them. Then with a low bow, the Mathapati gives the Jangams who are present, pieces of cloth about a foot and a half square to the end of which are tied bel leaves, ashes, and a couple of coppers. The Mathapati then calls forward four men from among the mourners and rubs them with ashes as a sign that they are to lift the body. If the family is well-to-do the body is carried in a bamboo frame, if poor it is carried in a blanket slung from two bamboos, and the head is held behind by the chief mourner. In front of the body musicians play and a Jangam blows the conch shell. Behind the body walk the male mourners and after them the female mourners, all repeating Har Har, Shiv Shiv. When they reach the outskirts of the village, the bearers change places those behind going in front and those in front coming behind. Then the body is borne to the burial ground. A grave is dug and in the grave a second hole five p\u00e2nds or the dead man\u2019s five feet long broad and deep, and, in front of it, facing either east or north, a niche is dug three and a half feet deep and four square with an arched top. The whole is either cowdunged or whitewashed and the dust of the Jangam\u2019s feet is thrown into it. The body is seated in the hole, and, except the loincloth, all the clothes are stripped off. The Mathapati takes the ling worn by the deceased, lays it on the dead man\u2019s left hand, and places the palm on the left thigh. He then lays before the body rice, flowers, sandal, and ashes, and round it waves burning incense and camphor. The ling is tied with a string to the hand and it is lifted up and laid in the niche in front. Bel leaves, cowdung ashes, salt, and earth are thrown in, and, when the earth is filled as high as the face, a piece of gold is laid in the dead mouth and the chief mourner, touching the dead lips with water, strikes his mouth, and covers the dead mouth with a cloth. The hole is filled with earth and stones, and a small mound of earth and stone is raised over it. The Mathapati stands on the mound repeating verses and the mourners stand with bel leaves, and, as soon as the verses are over, the mourners throw the leaves on the grave and cry Har Har, Mah\u00e1dev. A clay bullock is set on the ground and sprinkled with redpowder. The mourners go to the river or stream and wash their hands and feet, the chief mourner gives each of the Jangams present a copper, and all go to the mourner\u2019s house. The spot where the dead breathed his last is cowdunged and a pot of water and ashes are set on it, and each mourner drawing near to it takes a little ashes, rubs them on his brow, and goes home. The Ling\u00e1yats keep no mourning except that a few of the nearest relations and friends send the family presents of cooked dishes. On the third day the chief mourner, Jangams, and the four corpse-bearers go to the burial ground, pour a little milk and butter on the grave, return to the deceased\u2019s house, and dine. Money presents are made to the Jangams and the deceased\u2019s clothes and other personal effects are made over to the Mathapati or to the deceased\u2019s guru. Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis are bound together as a body and settle social disputes at meetings of the Shetya, the Mathapati, and the castemen. If the\nchief guru is present he presides. The Shetya is the most influential hereditary headman. He had formerly privileges and rights equal to those of a police p\u0101til. What a p\u0101til is to a village a Shetya is to the Ling\u0101yat peth or ward of a town. The chief offences to punish which meetings are called are eating fish and flesh, drinking liquor, drinking water with people who are not Ling\u0101yats, and cohabiting with a woman who is not a Ling\u0101yat. The minor offences are many as they are most strict in observing the rules of their faith. Caste meetings are held in religious houses or maths. The Mathapati opens the proceedings by stating the object of the meeting. The question is discussed and the majority of votes carries the day. The offender is fined, and, until the fine is paid, is put out of caste. If he is to be let back he has to pay a certain sum to the different religious houses in the town, gifts to Jangams, and in rare cases he has to give a caste feast. The power of caste shows no signs of failing. Ling\u0101yat V\u0101nis send their children to school but do not keep them at school for any length of time. The boys learn to read and write Mar\u0101thi and to cast accounts, and the girls learn to read Mar\u0101thi and K\u0101narese at home. They are a prosperous people.\n\nLoh\u0101na's, or Cutch traders apparently of Afghan origin, are returned as numbering six. Probably they were pilgrims on their way to Pandharpur as no Loh\u0101nas are settled in the district.\n\nM\u0101rwa'r V\u0101nis are returned as numbering 7234 and as found in all the towns and leading villages in the districts. They are tall, dark, hardy, and vigorous with sharp eyes and hollow cheeks. The men shave the head leaving three patches of hair, a top-knot, and a lock over each ear. All wear the moustache, and some whiskers and beards dividing the beard down the chin. They speak M\u0101rw\u0101ri among themselves and an incorrect Mar\u0101thi with others. When they come from their native country they bring nothing except a brass drinking pot, tattered clothes, and a long stick. By degrees they come to own good houses with a store of brass and copper vessels, and gold silver or pearl ornaments. They keep cattle, ponies, and carts, and eat jv\u0101ri, wheat, split pulse, butter, and vegetables. Their feasts are dinners of rice, split pulse, and sweetmeats called shir\u0101puri, l\u0101psi, bundi, jilbi, dalya, besan, and b\u0101sundi. They cost \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) for a hundred guests. The men wear a Hindu waistcloth waistcoat and coat, a small flat M\u0101rw\u0101ri or Deccan Br\u0101hman turban, and a shirt and shoulder-cloth wound round the waist. They let their hair show outside of the turban behind and on both sides. Their women dress in open-backed bodices and petticoats gh\u0101gr\u0101s and veil their faces with a cloth or odhni. Both men and women wear ornaments, the men wearing gold and pearl ornaments in the ears and on the neck and fingers, silver or gold waistchains, and silver toe-rings. The women's arms are covered to the elbow with thick ivory bracelets, and they have rich gold and silver ornaments and silk clothes and shawls. They also wear necklaces made of lac and gold beads; bangles of lac, glass, coral, and gold; and a gold bead on the head having a coloured cotton or silk cord entwined in the hair and worn in three plaits, two in front one on each side near the eyes and one in\nthe middle from the hair-parting or bh\u0101ng. They colour their teeth and nails with henna called mendi or alita meaning lac dye, and have a number of rings on their fingers with mirrors in them and joined to each other with silver chains. They have lately taken to wearing ornaments like those worn by Deccan Br\u0101hman women. They are sober and orderly, but dirty, cunning, and miserly, and in their dealings greedy and unscrupulous. They trade in cloth, yarn, metal, and grain, and keep shops, and sell tobacco, cocoanuts, parched grain, sweetmeats, sugar, molasses, oil, and salt. When they first come they begin by serving as shopboys in M\u0101rw\u0101ri shops or go hawking parched gram, crying out K\u0101ch b\u0101ngdi phut\u0101ne meaning that parched grain will be exchanged for broken glass and bangles. They begin with a capital of 3d. to 6d. (2-4 as.), buying parched grain and receiving in exchange, not copper or silver coin, but pieces of glass and glass-bangles, old iron, and other articles, which a needy daughter-in-law or daughter gives away stealthily. These the hawker gathers and sells to bangle-makers and blacksmiths. M\u0101rw\u0101ris also sell balls of parched jv\u0101ri or bhus l\u0101dus at one ball for two handfuls of grain, a rate which yields a four-fold profit. They also keep eating houses or kh\u0101nd\u0101vals, serve as shroffs or moneychangers, moneylenders, and bankers, and are a wealthy class. They worship P\u0101rasn\u0101th, and their priests are M\u0101rw\u0101ri Br\u0101hmans. Social disputes are settled at caste meetings. Their women are impure for ten days after childbirth, they worship the goddess P\u0101chvi on the fifth, and name the child on the twelfth. They have betrothals and marry their girls before they come of age. Eight days before marriage, each at their own house, the boy and girl are seated on a horse, dressed in rich clothes, and paraded through the town with music and a party of kinspeople. This is called the horse parade or ghoda miravni. During their monthly sickness their women sit by themselves for four days, and they mourn the dead for ten days. They do not allow widow-marriage. They teach their boys first at home, and then send them to school to learn Mar\u0101thi and Modi and to cast accounts. They are a well-to-do class.\n\nVaishya V\u0101nis are returned as numbering 4326 souls and are found mostly in B\u0101rsi, M\u0101dha, and Shol\u0101pur. They are rather tall thin and dark, and the men wear the moustache and top-knot. Their women are fair but not goodlooking. Their home speech is Mar\u0101thi. They own one-storeyed mud and stone houses with flat or tiled roofs and keep cattle, and sometimes have a shopboy belonging to their own caste. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. The monthly food charges of a family of five vary from 14s. to 18s. (Rs. 7-9). The men dress in a waistcloth, a coat, a shouldercloth, and a scarf or turban folded in Brahman fashion and shoes. The women dress in the ordinary Mar\u0101tha robe and bodice. They are hardworking and thrifty, but not enterprising. They are husbandmen traders and petty shopkeepers. They worship the usual Hindu gods, have images in their houses, and keep all the Hindu fasts and feasts. Their priests are the ordinary Mar\u0101tha Br\u0101hmans generally Deshashths. Their social disputes are settled at caste meetings. They send their boys to school for a short time and are in easy circumstances.\nHusbandmen include three classes with a strength of 204,273. Of these 1437 (males 746, females 691) were H\u00e1tkars, 178,938 (males 89,978, females 88,960) Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, and 23,898 (males 12,093, females 11,805) M\u00e1lis.\n\nH\u00e1tkars are returned as numbering 1437 and as found over the whole district. They say they came from Bij\u00e1pur about a hundred and twenty-five years ago. Their surnames are Bhusvar, Jarvar, Karvar, Sadgar, and Yarngar, who eat together and intermarry except with families bearing the same surname. They speak Mar\u00e1thi and eat the flesh of goats, sheep, hare, and deer, and drink liquor. A family of five spends 8s. to 12s. (Rs. 4-6) a month on food and a feast costs \u00a32 to \u00a33 (Rs. 20-30). The women do not eat fish or flesh, and men who have eaten flesh are held impure and are not touched till the next morning. Flesh is not cooked or eaten in a house where women live and flesh feasts are held in out-of-the-way places. In house and dress they do not differ from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They are landholders, potters, messengers, house servants, shepherds, and a few moneychangers. Their family deities are Bhav\u00e1ni, Durga, Khandoba, and Sidoba, and their priests are ordinary Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. Their women are impure for twelve days after childbirth, they worship Satv\u00e1i on the fifth, and name girls on the twelfth and boys on the thirteenth. They cut the child\u2019s hair any time between its first and its fourteenth years. The hair-cutting is later with them than with other castes, as before cutting the hair they have to offer seven sheep to seven different Satv\u00e1is and hold feasts. They have betrothals. P\u00e1t\u00edls are paid \u00a35 to \u00a310 (Rs. 50-100) when their boys are married, in other cases the boy\u2019s father has to pay the girl\u2019s father \u00a35 to \u00a350 (Rs. 50-500). Except that they tie two marriage ornaments one over the other on the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s brows, their marriage ceremonies do not differ from those of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Their marriage guardians are the p\u00e1\u00f1ch p\u00e1lv\u00eds or five tree-leaves in whose honour they feast five married women, seven in honour of the goddess Satv\u00e1i, five in honour of Jukerya the water goddess, seven in honour of the goddess Ashar, and three in honour of Gadjivan. They either bury or burn the dead. The chief mourner shaves his moustache on the thirteenth day after death and feasts his caste. They have two headmen each of whom they term gauda the K\u00e1narese for headman. They send their boys to school and are steady people.\n\nMar\u00e1tha\u2019s\u00b9 are returned as numbering about 180,000 and as found over the whole district. According to local accounts the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s came to Shol\u00e1pur from Karh\u00e1d, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the western Deccan after the great Durg\u00e1devi famine at the close of the fourteenth century. After their coming they are said to have degenerated into Kunbis. A Mar\u00e1tha proper keeps no spinning wheel or bell-metal pot in his house, allows no widow marriage, and never owns a particoloured quilt or v\u00e1kal. A Kunbi allows widow marriage and keeps the wheel and the quilt, and eats and drinks from bellmetal vessels. Kunbis are said to be bastards or akarm\u00e1she Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the offspring of a Mar\u00e1tha by a Mar\u00e1tha woman not his wife. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Kunbis eat together but do not intermarry. Mar\u00e1tha\n\n\u00b9 Details are given in the Poona Statistical Account.\nKunbis vary greatly in appearance. Some of the gentry, the village headmen, and other large landholders are strongly built occasionally fair with good features and a martial air. The bulk of the caste, though as a rule stalwart and well made, are dark and coarse featured hardly to be distinguished from Dhangars and Mh\u00e1rs. All the men wear the top-knot and among the Kunbis some wear ear tufts. All wear the moustache, some the whiskers, and some both whiskers and beards. Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s both at home and abroad speak a somewhat coarsely and broadly pronounced Mar\u00e1thi.\\(^1\\) Rich Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s live in houses of the better sort generally one storey high with mud walls and flat or tiled roofs. Of the old mud walled forts or gadd\u00eds, which, in the hands of the Mar\u00e1tha gentry or deshmukhs, sometimes held out against an army, examples remain in K\u00e1shegaon, Gurhal, and Mohol. The furniture in Mar\u00e1tha houses includes metal and earthen vessels, bedsteads, and field tools. Most of them have cattle and ponies but few keep house servants. A servant's yearly wages vary from \u00a32 to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 20-25) with food; the monthly keep of a cow costs about 8s. (Rs. 4) and of a she-buffalo 10s. to 12s. (Rs. 5-6). Kunbis generally live in untidy, ill-cared for mud-walled flat-roofed houses which would cost about \u00a315 (Rs. 150) to build and 8s. to 12s. (Rs. 4-6) a year to rent. Their staple food includes millet, pulse, and vegetables. They eat the flesh of sheep, goats, hare, deer, fowls, the wild hog, and eggs, and drink liquor. They are great eaters. The Mar\u00e1thi saying is If grain is not life then of what use is life.\\(^2\\) Their holiday dishes include wheat and gram cakes fried in oil, wheat cakes, vegetables, fowls, and mutton and liquor. Animal food is too dear to be often used. Those who have become v\u00e1rkaris or keepers of holy times profess to leave off fish flesh and liquor. But many of them still eat flesh and drink liquor on the sly after hanging their tulsi bead necklace to a peg. Mar\u00e1tha men dress in a loincloth, a waistcloth, or a pair of short drawers reaching the knee. The well-to-do use silk-bordered waistcloths and gaily dyed tight-fitting well folded Mar\u00e1tha turbans. Their women wear the backed short-sleeved bodice and the full robe with or without passing the skirt back between the feet. When going out women of the higher Mar\u00e1tha families cover themselves from head to foot with a broad white sheet which prevents any part of the body being seen. This is commonly known as the Mar\u00e1tha mola or Mar\u00e1tha practice. They do not work out of doors, the water being brought home by servants or by the men of the house. An upper class Mar\u00e1tha woman on no account shows her face before strangers. The wives of Kunbis work in the fields and appear with their faces uncovered in public. Women wear glass bracelets, and pearl gold and silver nose, ear, neck, hand and foot ornaments, as well as the black glass bead necklace the mangal-sutra or lucky thread. The ordinary dress of a Kunbi man does not cost more than six or eight shillings (Rs. 3-4) and of a woman\n\n\\(^1\\) The leading local peculiarities are emphasising the last syllable of a word if it is long and lengthening it if it is short and at the same time shortening and flattening the last syllable but one. Thus bolt\u00e1t they say becomes bolteete; j\u00e1t\u00e1t, they go, jateete; kart\u00e1t, they do, kartete. Nasals are also much rarer than in Poona.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Mar\u00e1thi runs: Annamev pr\u00e1n nahi tar k\u00e1y upayogdche.\n12s. to 14s. (Rs.6-7) a year. They keep in stock a silk-bordered waistcloth worth 6s. to 10s. (Rs.3-5), and a turban worth 12s. to 14s. (Rs.6-7). A robe for special occasions costs 10s. to 12s. (Rs.5-6) and a bodice 1s. to 1s. 3d. (8-10 as.). They are hardworking, hospitable, and frugal in ordinary life, but wanting in forethought and extravagant on great occasions. Most are husbandmen. Of the husbandmen many are landholders, many under holders, and many field labourers with no interest in the crop beyond their wages. The women help the men in the field. The field labourers are generally paid in grain and during the harvest seasons make good profits. Landholders have generally some stock of farm cattle. The position of Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis in the local caste list is rather uncertain. Well-to-do Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s claim connection with the old Mar\u00e1tha aristocracy and consider themselves Rajputs and Kshatriyas, claim to rank immediately after Br\u00e1hmans, and say they eat from Br\u00e1hmans only. The Kunbis consider themselves Shudras and eat from Br\u00e1hmans, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. The Kunbis' busy season begins in May when they start making ready their fields for the next season. They work from sunrise to sunset with a short midday rest. Their slack season begins about February or March after the cold-weather crops are in. Besides minding the house the women help the men in the field. Their children take cattle to graze, and a few go to school. They worship Jotiba near Ratn\u00e1giri, Khandoba of Jejuri, Mah\u00e1dev of Singn\u00e1pur, and Vithoba of Pandharpur. Their priests are Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. They go on pilgrimage to Pandharpur, Tulj\u00e1pur, and sometimes to Benares. Within the last few years the worship of Vithoba of Pandharpur has greatly risen in favour. The feeling, partly perhaps from motives of economy, has been gaining ground that it is the place Pandharpur quite as much as the image of Vithoba that is holy. To see the pinnacle of the temple spire is as good as to touch the god. The men who hold these views belong to the V\u00e1rkaripanth or season-keeping sect, whose leaders are hereditary married teachers or gurus. Each guru has five to six thousand followers who visit all the chief shrines and gather money to get up large feasts or bhand\u00e1r\u00e1s. The followers of these teachers are known by wearing a necklace of tulsi beads. The gurus try to gain new followers by preaching their views. Those that are not V\u00e1rkaris worship local deities. The Mar\u00e1tha holidays are the same as those of other Hindus. The husbandman's chief holiday is the Pola or Ox Day, which falls on the last day of Shr\u00e1van in July-August. In M\u00e1lsiras the Ox Day is known as Bendur and falls on the last day of Bh\u00e1drapad or August-September. On Ox Day the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s deck their bullocks and feed them on sweetmeats. At births, among the well-to-do, betel packets are distributed among kinspeople and friends. After childbirth a Kunbi woman is held impure for ten days during which neither is she touched nor are her house gods worshipped. On the fifth evening, to the grindstone or p\u00e1tta, fruit, cakes, and sweetmeats are offered. A sword or a common house knife or vila is laid near the grindstone and a dry millet stump which they call an arrow or tir. The goddess Satv\u00e1i is believed to come on that night to guard the\nmother and her infant from evil. A blank sheet of paper, a pen and an ink-pot are set near the stone to enable her to write the child's destiny. They name their girls on the twelfth and their boys on the thirteenth. On the naming day kinswomen and friends are called, and present the child with new clothes, and cradle and name the child the name being chosen by the village astrologer. The guests retire with a handful of wet gram or wheat. A year after, on a lucky day, the child if it is a boy is seated on its maternal uncle's lap and its hair is clipped. The barber is given a few coppers, some grain, and the clothes which the child has on at the time, and, in the evening, kinspeople and friends are feasted on flesh and cakes. Before a marriage can be fixed, the boy's father must ascertain that the boy and girl are not of the same clan, have different surnames, and have a different devak that is guardian or crest. The Kunbi marriage is preceded by a betrothal. The marriage may take place immediately after the betrothal and in no case should more than a year pass between the two. On the betrothal day the boy's relations bring a bodice, a robe, and an ornament or two to the girl's house and present them to her. The village astrologer is asked to fix a lucky day for marrying the boy and girl, and at their houses the boy and girl are rubbed with turmeric first by the village washerwoman and then by five married women. On the marriage morning the guardian or devak is brought and tied to a post in the marriage porch. In the evening the boy is taken to the girl's in procession on bullock or horseback with music and a band of kinspeople. At the girl's the boy and girl are made to stand on a blanket facing each other and a cloth is held between them. While the priest repeats verses one of the party goes on the roof of the house or mounts a tree to see the sun go down. When the sun is set the verses cease, the cloth held between the boy and girl is pulled on one side, and they are husband and wife. Cotton thread is passed ten times round the boy and girl, and the threads are cut in two and tied round the wrists of the boy and girl. Next comes the girl-giving or kany\u0101d\u0101n when butter is poured over the hands of the boy and girl. The girl's parents wash the boy's feet in a metal plate with water and the ceremony is over. The boy and girl are seated on a blanket and fed with milk and rice. Br\u0101hmans are presented with money and retire. Either on that or on the next day the boy steals an image from the girl's family god house and goes in procession to his village. Mar\u0101th\u00e1s allow widow marriage but hold the ceremony only on dark nights. No married woman or girl attends the ceremony and the faces of the newly married couple are not seen for a couple of days. When a girl comes of age she is seated by herself for four days and her lap is filled with rice or wheat, dry cocoa-kernel, and dates. Mar\u0101th\u00e1s, as a rule burn their dead, and the Kunbis either burn or bury. The dead body is washed, laid on a bier, and redpowder and betel leaves are thrown over it. The chief mourner walks before the body, carrying a firepot hanging from a string. They mourn ten days and offer a rice flour ball on the eleventh. They feast bearers and kinspeople on the twelfth and thirteenth. They are bound together by a strong caste\nfeeling, and settle social disputes at caste meetings under the village p\u0101\u1e6dil or headman. Some of them send their boys to school but keep them at school only for a short time. They suffered severely during the 1876-77 famine, and though they have since improved considerably they are still as a class poor and in debt. Many of them have taken service as messengers and constables or work as day labourers either locally or wherever they hear of well paid employment. They stay away until they can bring back a score or two, ekvisa or donvisa, of rupees.\n\nMalis, or Gardeners, are returned as numbering about 24,000 and as found over the whole district. They are divided into Khirs\u0101gar Malis and R\u0101nt Malis. Their home tongue is Mar\u0101thi, and they look and dress like cultivating Mar\u0101th\u0101s except that the women wear shoes like men\u2019s shoes. Their houses do not differ from Kunbi houses and they keep servants, cattle, ponies, and sheep and goats. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor, and their feasts of the cakes called puran polis and telchis cost them \u00a31 8s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 14-20) for every hundred guests. Malis are a hardworking orderly and contented people. They earn their living as husbandmen gardeners and labourers, and their women and children help in selling vegetables and flowers. They worship Amb\u0101i, Bhav\u0101ni, Jan\u0101i, Khandoba, Mah\u0101dev, Tuk\u0101i, and Vithoba; and their priests are ordinary Mar\u0101tha Br\u0101hmans to whom they pay great respect. Except that at the marriage time their boys and girls are rubbed with turmeric at their house by washerwomen, their customs are the same as those of Mar\u0101th\u0101s. They either bury or burn their dead, hold caste councils, send their boys to school, and are a steady class.\n\nCraftsmen include thirty classes with a strength of 74,900 or 13\u00b79 per cent of the Hindu population.

They are strong and dark and the men wear the moustache and top-knot. They speak Mar\u0101thi. They are stone-cutters and bricklayers, digging wells, blasting rocks, and breaking stones. Their houses are like those of cultivating Mar\u0101th\u0101s. The men wear the loincloth, waist-cloth, and short tight trousers or choln\u0101s, the jacket, and the\nMar\u00e1tha turban; and the women dress in the ordinary Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice and do not tuck the end of the robe back between the feet. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. They are hardworking, orderly, and hospitable but fond of drink. They have caste councils, do not send their boys to school, and are a steady people earning enough to maintain themselves.\n\nBhadbhunj\u00e1s or Grain-Parchers, are returned as numbering four and as found in the Shol\u00e1pur town. They are divided into Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Pardeshis. The following particulars apply to the Mar\u00e1tha Bhadbhunj\u00e1s. Their surnames are G\u00e1ikav\u00e1d, J\u00e1dhav, Pov\u00e1r, and Sinde, who eat together and families with the same surname do not intermarry. They look like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, speak Mar\u00e1thi, and live in houses the same as Mar\u00e1tha houses except for the furnace or bhatt\u00ed and a shop in the veranda. In dress and food they resemble Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, eating fish, fowls, and the flesh of the hare, deer, and wild hog. They are an orderly, sober, hardworking and even-tempered people. In addition to parching and selling grain and pulse, they sometimes serve as day labourers, entrusting their shops to their wives and children. They sometimes borrow money and have to pay interest at two, three, or even four per cent a month. They always borrow small sums never as much as one hundred rupees as no one will advance them that sum on the security of their goods. In religion, customs, and community they are the same as Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They send their boys to school and are a poor people.\n\nBuruds, or Bamboo-workers, are returned as numbering 343 and as found in towns and large villages. According to their own account they are descended from Kenshuka, whose father's name was Bhivar and his mother's Kuvinta, and they are said to have come into the district five or six generations back. They are dark and strong and the men wear the top-knot and moustache. They speak Mar\u00e1thi both at home and abroad, and live in untidy and ill-cared for grass huts or houses of stone and mud with flat or tiled roofs.

Their staple food is jv\u00e1ri, vegetables, and chillies. They drink liquor sometimes to excess. The dress of the men and women is the same as the Mh\u00e1r's dress. They are hardworking, patient, and forbearing, but intemperate and dirty. They make bamboo baskets, mats, winnowing fans, and sieves, and a few make cane chairs and cots. In Pandharpur they find good employment in making fine bamboo sticks for the use of the frankincense stick preparers. Their women, besides minding the house, help them in their work of making and hawking fans and baskets. They belong to no particular sect, and worship all Hindu gods and goddesses, chiefly Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i, Jotiba, Khandoba, and Satv\u00e1i. Their priests are village Br\u00e1hmans and they have no priests belonging to their own caste. They keep all Hindu fasts and feasts and believe in sorcery and witchcraft. They marry their children early; the girls between seven and twelve, and the boys between twelve and twenty. The\ncost varies from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a36 (Rs. 25 - 60). Except that their guardian or devak is the mango tree, branches of which are brought home and tied to the marriage hall, and that the boy and girl are married on the earthen altar or ota, their marriage and funeral ceremonies are the same as those of Mhars and Mangs. They generally bury their dead. They allow widow marriage making over the first husband's children to his relations. They have a caste council, and their headman, who is called mhetrya decides social disputes in consultation with a few leading members of the caste. The fine generally takes the form of a caste feast. They do not send their boys to school, and, as their calling is not well paid, many have turned Varkaris or Pandharpur holy time keepers and go about begging.\n\nChambhars, or Leather-workers, are returned as numbering 1131 and as found all over the district. Their surnames are Dhodke, Kamble, and Vaghmare. Families with the same surname eat together but do not intermarry. They are generally rather fair with regular features, and the men wear the top-knot and moustache, and a few the whiskers. They speak Marathi and live either in grass huts with thatched roofs or in mud and stone houses with flat roofs, setting apart the veranda for a workshop. They keep cattle, goats, and sheep, and their houses are dirty and ill-cared for. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. The men wear a loincloth and blanket, and occasionally a waistcloth, jacket, and turban. The women dress in the usual Maratha robe and bodice. Their ceremonial dress is the same as their every-day dress except that it is clean. They are hospitable and forbearing, but fond of drink, and proverbially lazy, as the saying goes, Under his haunches the awl, and in his house starving children. They work in leather, cut and dye skins, make sandals shoes and water bags, and till the ground. The women help the men in drawing silk flowers and making silk borders to the shoes. Some serve as labourers and hold torches in marriage processions. They worship the ordinary Hindu gods and goddesses, and have house images of Bahiri, Jotiba, Khandoba, and Mhasoba. They keep the usual Hindu fasts and feasts, and their priests are village Brahmins to whom they pay the greatest respect. They worship Satvai on the fifth day after childbirth, name the child either on the twelfth or the thirteenth, and clip the child's hair within four to six months. With them marriage is preceded by betrothal. Before marriage they rub the boy and girl at their houses with turmeric, and as a guardian or devak tie panchpalvis or five tree leaves that is of the mango, the umbar Ficus glomerata, the jambhul Syzgium jambolanum, the saundad Prosopis spicegera, and rui Calotropis gigantea to a post of the booth and worship them, offering a fish and feasting on its flesh. The poor bury the dead and those who can afford it burn them. They allow widow marriage, the widower during the ceremony being seated on bullock harness and the widow on a low wooden stool. They have a caste council and settle social disputes in\n\n---\n\n1 The Marathi runs: Gandikhalai ari ani gharant pore mari.\npresence of the headman. They do not send their boys to school. Their income is fair and enough to keep them.\n\n**Gavandis**, or Masons, are returned as numbering 812 and as found all over the district. They are divided into Jingars, Jires, K\u00e1m\u00e1this, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, P\u00e1nch\u00e1l\u00eds, and Sagars. A few Br\u00e1hmans also work as masons. Of these Jingars, K\u00e1m\u00e1this, and Br\u00e1hmans are found in very small numbers in the district, and P\u00e1nch\u00e1l\u00eds are rare.\n\n**Jire Gavandis** are found only in Pandharpur and Shol\u00e1pur. They are called Jires after their headman\u2019s surname who was the B\u00e1dhsh\u00e1s\u2019 or Bij\u00e1pur kings\u2019 builder. They are said to have been Mar\u00e1tha husbandmen who were put out of caste because they refused to pay a fine of \u00a315 (Rs. 150) which their castefellows levied on them for building mosques for the Adil-Sh\u00e1hi kings (1490-1686) at Bij\u00e1pur. They say Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are willing to let them back, but that they do not wish to go back, because the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s have lately taken to eating, and, in out-of-the-way places, marrying with Telis and Sangars. The Jires and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s eat together, and their married women or sav\u00e1shins attend feasts at one another\u2019s houses. Bodhleb\u00e1va, a great Mar\u00e1tha saint, whose head-quarters are at Dh\u00e1mangaon in B\u00e1rsi, is anxious that the Jires should go back and join the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Jires are said to have come into the district seventy or eighty years ago to build Sindia\u2019s mansion in Pandharpur. They have Kadus or bastards among them, with whom they eat but do not intermarry. The Jire surnames are K\u00e1mle, Pav\u00e1r, S\u00e1lunke, and Surve, and families having the same surname do not intermarry. The names in common use among men are \u00c1pa, Balvanta, Ganpati, and R\u00e1ma; and among women Elub\u00e1i, Itt\u00e1\u00ed, Rakhum\u00e1i and Sub\u00e1i. All belong to the sun family called Surygotra or Surugotra. Neither men nor women differ from cultivating Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in look, speech, house, dress, or food. They eat fish and the flesh of goats, sheep, rabbits, hares, and fowls, and their staple food is bajri, tur, jv\u00e1ri, milk, and every two or three days rice. They drink liquor once or twice a year especially on the last day of the Shimga or Hobi holidays in March-April. They are not great eaters or drinkers, neither are they good cooks. There is nothing special or proverbial about their cooking. Before beginning to dine, they sprinkle a little cold water round the dining plate and sip some water repeating the words Krishn\u00e1rpan that is for the acceptance of Krishna. The Jires are hardworking, eventempered, sober, thrifty, hospitable, contented, and orderly. They are masons and husbandmen and their women mind the house. Their boys begin to help from fifteen or eighteen. A trained mason earns \u00a31 10s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 15 -30) a month. All find constant employment. They build houses, ponds, wells, bridges and temples, and carve stone or mould clay images of gods and animals, which they sell at 3d. to \u00a320 (Rs. \u00bd - 200). Their craft prospers and they have credit being able to borrow at twelve to eighteen per cent a year and almost never fail to pay their debts. Their family deities are Bhav\u00e1mi of Tulj\u00e1pur, Jakh\u00e1i and Jokh\u00e1i, and Khandoba of Jejuri. They also worship all Br\u00e1hmanical gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and feasts. Their priests are the ordinary\nMar\u0101\u1e6dha Br\u0101hmans, before whom they bow and whom they worship as gods. Their gurus or religious teachers are either Gos\u0101vis or Br\u0101hmans. When a child or a grown person is initiated the teacher whispers into his right ear a sacred verse. A year or two after marriage they generally go and seek the advice of the teacher. They believe in sorcery witchcraft and soothsaying, and, when sickness comes to a family, they consult a seer or devrushi as to the best means for driving out the evil spirit. When a boy is twelve, sixteen, or eighteen years old his parents think of marrying him. The girl chosen to be his wife is generally eight to twelve years old, but they have no rule that girls should be married before they come of age. Before a marriage can be fixed, the parties must ascertain that the boy and girl have different surnames and have not the same guardian or devak. After talking the matter over with his wife and the elderly women of his house and fixing on some girl the boy\u2019s father goes to a Br\u0101hman and asks him when he should set out to make an offer of marriage for his boy. The Br\u0101hman, who is generally a village astrologer names the day, and the boy\u2019s father, tying in a cloth a few cakes and some vegetables, fried fish, and pounded chillies, starts for the girl\u2019s with a kinsman or two. When they reach the girl\u2019s, the boy\u2019s father makes over the bundle of cakes to the women of the house, and the fathers sit on the veranda, on a blanket spread for them, talking the matter over, asking one another the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s ages, their surnames, and their guardians or devaks. After some pressure the girl\u2019s father agrees to give his daughter, and they sup together often from the same plate. Next morning the fathers go to the village Br\u0101hman, and tell him the boy\u2019s and the girl\u2019s names, eat a dish of rice and sugar, and settle what presents each is to make to the other\u2019s child. Next day some of the boy\u2019s kinspeople bring a robe and bodice, go to the girl\u2019s house and present it to her. From this time marriage preparations are pressed on. When the Br\u0101hman has fixed a lucky evening for the wedding, word is sent to the girl\u2019s parents, and the boy\u2019s father sends invitations to relations and friends. Marriage booths are built at both houses. Except that an altar is built at the girl\u2019s, the preparations at both houses are the same. Musicians are called and early in the wedding morning at the girl\u2019s house, the house handmill is washed, and turmeric roots are ground to powder. The girl\u2019s head is rubbed with oil and her body with turmeric and she is bathed with a band of little children. When all the children have bathed, the girl\u2019s mother sits by her and bathes, and her kinspeople present her with a new robe and bodice. The girl is dressed in a robe and green bodice, her clothes are stained with turmeric, and her brow marked with redpowder. A flower or a tinsel chaplet is tied round her brow and her head is covered with a blanket. By this time the boy has been rubbed with turmeric and bathed. He is then dressed and a tinsel chaplet is tied to his brow. The guests feast, and, seating the boy on a horse or bullock, with music and friends go to the girl\u2019s village M\u0101ruti, and from it to the boundary of the girl\u2019s village. The girl\u2019s friends come and bring them to the village temple, they bow before the god, and the boy is led to the door of\nthe girl's marriage hall, bathed, dressed in new clothes, and seated near the outer wall of the house. The girl is seated on the boy's left. They are then made to stand facing each other, and a cloth is held between them. Behind the girl and the boy stand their maternal uncles and their sisters or karavlis with lighted lamps in their hands. The boy's brother also stands behind him with a lemon stuck on the point of a dagger. The Br\u00e1hman repeats verses, and the guests throw rice over the pair. At the end of the verses the Br\u00e1hman claps his hands, the musicians play, and the boy and girl are husband and wife. Then the boy and girl are seated on the altar, the girl on the boy's left. They dine and the guests either stay for the night or go home. On the fourth day the boy takes the girl to his own house. Jires allow widow marriage and polygamy. When a girl comes of age she is seated in a room by herself for four days. On the fifth she is bathed and word is sent to her parents. She is given a cot, bedding, waterpots, and a robe and bodice, and the boy is given a turban. A feast is held and the girl is told to make the bed ready, and the boy and girl are shut in the room. A young wife generally goes to her parents for her first child. When a child is born a Br\u00e1hman is asked to name it. The midwife cuts the navel cord, bathes the mother and child in warm water, and swathes the child in cloth bandages. A piece of cloth soaked in cow's milk is put in the child's mouth, and the mother is fed on rice, butter, and warm water. A lamp is kept burning in the room, and, on the fifth day, the goddess Satvai is worshipped, and on the twelfth day the child is named. When a Jire is on the point of death, his son lays his father's head on his right knee and drops water into his mouth. When he breathes his last some Ganges or God\u00e1vari water and tulsi leaves and a piece of gold are put in his mouth. The body is brought out of the house and laid on the door-step with its feet to the road. Warm water is poured over it, it is laid on the bier, and covered from head to foot with a sheet. On the sheet is sprinkled redpowder or gulal and basil leaves, and two copper coins and a handful of grain are tied in the hem of the sheet. The chief mourner ties a piece of white cloth across his shoulder and chest. Then holding in his right hand an earthen jar with live coal in it, the chief mourner starts, and four near kinsmen lift the bier and follow. At the burning ground a stone called jivkhada or the stone of life is picked up, and kept in some safe place in the burning ground. The bier is set on the ground and the pile is made ready. The chief mourner bathes, brings a potful of water, pours a few drops into the dead mouth, and lights the pile. He takes the jar, bores holes in it, walks three times round the pyre, dashes the pot on the ground, and beats his mouth with the open palm of his right hand. Then they bathe and go back to their homes. While the funeral party are away, at the chief mourner's house the spot where the deceased breathed his last is cowdunged, a cup of milk and a lighted lamp are set on it, and the ground is strewn with wheat or rice flour. The neighbours come with cooked food, serve it to the mourners, and dine with them. In the evening they look for the marks of an ant or other insect's feet, and from the footsteps judge that the deceased has died happy and his\nspirit has passed into an ant or a fly. If no footsteps are traced, the dead is believed to have had some unfulfilled wish or care that keeps him from leaving the earth. They beg him to come and drink and leave his footsteps that they may not be anxious what has come to him. This is repeated night and day, the people if no traces are shown puzzling what can be the deceased\u2019s unfulfilled wish. On the third day, the chief mourner with some near kinspeople goes to the burning ground and throws the ashes into water. The crows are offered rice balls, and they are asked to come and eat them. If the crows come and touch the balls, it is believed that the soul of the deceased is happy; if the crow refuses to eat the mourners pray the dead to say what ails him, and promise to fulfil his wishes. For ten days the house is in mourning. On the eleventh the whole house is cowdunged, and on the twelfth and thirteenth cooked food and rice balls are again offered to the crows. The chief mourner does not become pure till the morning of the thirteenth, when the whole house is cowdunged, uncooked food and money presents are made to Br\u00e1hmans, and the caste is feasted. The Jires are bound together by a strong caste feeling. They have no headman and settle their social disputes at meetings of their own and other castemen. The power of caste has of late grown weak. The Jires can read and write Mar\u00e1thi both B\u00e1bdhod and Modi, and keep their boys for long at schools. They are a steady and contented if not a rising class.\n\nSagar Gavandis claim to have come from Benares in search of work to the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Haidarabad. Their castefellows are still found near Haidarabad some of them wearing sacred threads and dining in silk waistcloths. They occasionally come on pilgrimage from Haidarabad to Pandharpur when they dine with the Shol\u00e1pur Sagars, but not unless the local Sagars dress in a silk or in a fresh washed waistcloth. They are said to have come into the district about three hundred years ago, and are divided into Sagars proper and Lekavl\u00e1 or Kadus that is bastard Sagars who eat together but do not intermarry. The names in common use among them are Govind, N\u00e1g\u00fa, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, and Narsu; and among women Bh\u00e1girthi, K\u00e1shi, Yamuna, and Yashvada. Their surnames are Gadpate, Kalburge, K\u00e1sle, and Narne; and families bearing the same surnames do not intermarry. All belong to the K\u00e1shyap family stock. Both men and women look like Mar\u00e1tha husbandmen, the men wear the top-knot and moustache, but not the beard, and mark their brows with sandal. Their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi, but those who are settled in the Karn\u00e1tak and Moghl\u00e1i or Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country speak Telugu. Their houses are the same as Mar\u00e1tha houses with mud and stone walls and flat earth roofs and their house goods include cots, boxes, metal and earthen vessels, clothes, cattle, and ponies. They eat fish and the flesh of sheep, goats, hares, rabbits, and fowls, and their staple food is jv\u00e1ri, tur, b\u00e1jri, and occasionally rice and wheat bread. Formerly all ate flesh whenever they could afford it without offering it to the gods. Many of them keep to the old practice, but some who have become v\u00e1rkaris or Pandharpur devotees, offer no sheep, goats, or fowls, have given up eating flesh and drinking liquor, and have taken to wear a\nChapter III.\n\nPeople.\n\nCraftsmen.\n\nSagar Gavandis.\n\nnecklace of tulsi beads. For their holiday dinners they prepare grain and wheat cakes. They drink liquor but only twice or three times a year on great occasions like Sankranti in January and Shimga in March. They are not great eaters or drinkers, neither are they good cooks. There is nothing special or proverbial about their cooking or their pet dishes. Their only peculiar practice at meals is before beginning to eat to lay some cooked rice for the god Agni or fire in front of their plates. Both men and women dress like Marathas, the men in a waistcloth, turban, jacket, coat, shoulder-cloth, and shoes, and the women in a robe and bodice. The women do not deck their heads with flowers or false hair. Both men and women are fairly neat and clean but they do not show any taste in dress and have no special liking for gay colours. Their holiday dress is made of rich stuff with gold borders. There have been no recent changes in the shape or material. The women wear the nosering, earrings, neck ornaments, bangles, and toe-rings. Men wear a gold neckchain and finger rings, and boys up to fifteen wear wristlets. They are hardworking, even-tempered, sober, thrifty, hospitable, and orderly. Besides by stone-cutting some earn their living as husbandmen and some as labourers. Boys begin to help their fathers at the age of twelve and become skilled workers at the age of twenty-five. A boy gets 8s. to 10s. (Rs. 4-5) a month, and when he becomes a skilled worker his wages rise to 16s. to \u00a31 12s. (Rs. 8-16). Their work is not constant. They sometimes take fields on lease and work in them. They build houses, wells, and bridges, make earth and lime images of Hindu gods and saints, and sell Ganpati at 1\u00bdd. to 6d. (1-4 as.). They are not in debt, and are generally able to borrow at about two per cent a month. Sagars claim Kshatriya descent though they admit they have fallen to be Shudras. They eat with Marathas, Dhangars, and Lingayat Vanis, but not with Lingayat Telis, Panchals, Jingars, Sonars, Kasars, or low caste Hindus like Buruds, Mhars, and Mangs. They are a religious people and worship Hindu gods and goddesses as well as Musalm\u00e1n saints and the tabuts or Muharram biers. Their family deities are Balaji of Giri or Tirupati, Bhavani of Tuljapur, Jotiba of Ratnagiri, Khandoba of Jejuri, and Yallama of the Karnatak to whom they sometimes go to pay vows. Their priests are the ordinary Maratha Brahmins to whom they show the greatest respect. The gurus or teachers of some are Ramans and of others Shankaracharya. They are either Smarts or Vaishnavs and keep the usual Brahmanic fasts and feasts. They believe in sorcery witchcraft and soothsaying. They marry their girls between seven and twelve, and their boys between twelve and twenty-five. After talking the matter over and fixing on some girl, the boy's father consults a Brahmin and starts with a couple of relations for the girl's house. They talk the matter over, and, after some pressure, the girl's father agrees to give his daughter. An astrologer is sent for, the boy's and girl's horoscopes are compared, and, if the horoscopes agree, the parents settle what presents are to be given. The astrologer is asked to fix a lucky day for formally asking for the girl, and, when this is settled, the boy's father returns to his house with his companions. On a lucky day named by the astrologer\nthe boy's kinspeople taking a robe and bodice, a packet of sugar, fruit, dry dates, and betelnut and leaves, go to the girl's house, present her with the robe and the bodice, fill her lap with fruit, dry dates, rice, and betel, and an astrologer is sent for who draws up the marriage papers or patrik\u0101s, receives a money present, and retires. The boy's brother or if he has no brother, the boy's father is presented with a turban, a feast is held, and sugar is handed among the guests. Instead of the boy, the girl, with kinsfolk and music, starts on horseback for the boy's. They stop at the village M\u0101ruti temple and send word to the boy, and the boy's party come with pots full of cold water, cakes, and millet gruel. After the gruel has been served to such as wish to share it, they are brought into the village and taken to their lodgings. The boy is bathed and rubbed with turmeric, and what is over is sent to the girl's with a robe and bodice. The boy's kinswomen bathe the girl, dress her in the new clothes, and fill her lap with fruit dry dates and betel. Two branches of each of the five guardian trees or panchp\u0101lvis that is the leaves of mango, the umbar Ficus glomerata, the jamb\u016bl Syzygium jambolanum, saundad Prosopis spicegera, and rui Calotropis gigantea, are laid in an earthen jar and placed in M\u0101ruti's temple. Then from both houses a band of kinspeople with music go to fetch the jar or guardian shrine to their houses, place it near the house gods, and worship it with flowers and rice grains. An altar is raised at the boy's with a plantain stem and a pile of six earthen jars at each corner. A procession is formed and the girl's kinsfolk with the girl carried in the arms of a near relation go to the village temple, and from the temple to the boy's. When the girl reaches the boy's she takes her stand near the door of the booth, the boy's mother waves round her head a cocoanut and cooked rice, and throws it to one side, and the girl walks in with her relations and takes her seat in the house. Two low wooden stools are set in front of the altar, the boy and girl take their stand on the stools face to face, grains of rice are handed to the guests, and, when the Br\u0101hmans have finished chanting the marriage verses, the guests throw the rice over the couple and they are husband and wife. Four or five turns of cotton thread are passed round the boy and girl; the threads are offered vermilion and rice, cut, tied round a turmeric root, and bound to the wrist of the boy and of the girl. The priest throws a sacred thread round the boy's shoulders, the boy and girl are seated on the altar, the sacrificial fire is lit, betel is handed, and the guests withdraw. The boy and girl are taken before the house gods, bow to them, and are lifted on the shoulders of two men who dance to music. The day ends with the biting of betel leaf rolls by the boy and girl and the playing of odds and evens with betelnuts, and a feast. Either on the second or the third day after marriage, in the marriage hall, a cot is laid in front of the house door, on which the boy and girl sit near each other. Between them is placed a stone rolling-pin muffled in a piece of white cloth and daubed with turmeric. The pin is by turns placed in the arms of the boy and of the girl, and cold water is dropped on the ground near their feet, and the women call out that the boy's or the girl's child has passed over water. The family priest unties the\nwedding wristlets, the boy takes off his sacred thread, and after worshipping them they are kept in some corner of the house and in the end thrown away. The girl's father asks the boy's father how many betelnuts he wishes. If the girl's father says twenty, ten are added, and thirty betelnuts are handed to each of the guests whether man woman or child. In this way large quantities of betelnuts are handed round whether or not the guests belong to their own caste. Then except those who have been asked to stay for dinner, all leave. Feasts on both sides end the marriage ceremonies. Their age-coming and pregnancy rites are the same as those of the K\u00e1m\u00e1this. On the fifth day after the birth of a girl's first child the midwife lays healing herbs and roots on a grindstone, and lays vermilion, turmeric paste, flowers, burnt frankincense, and cooked food before them. A feast is held and either five or seven widows are feasted in honour of the goddess Satv\u00e1i who is believed to be a widow. The women of the house keep awake the whole night. Next morning the midwife carries to her own house and eats the food which the evening before was offered to the healing plants. The plants are taken away and given to the young mother. On the tenth the house is cowdunged, the mother and child are bathed and laid on the fresh washed cot spread with fresh clothes. On the eleventh, as on the tenth, the mother and child are bathed, the cot is washed, and the whole house cowdunged. On the twelfth, five seven or nine pebbles are arranged in a line outside of the house in the name of Satv\u00e1i, and water is poured over them, red and scented powder sprinkled, flowers rice and sandal strewn, frankincense burnt, and cooked food and two pieces of thread or n\u00e1d\u00e1s laid before them. The mother makes a low bow, and retires. In the afternoon the child is laid in the cradle and named, and the thread or n\u00e1da offered to the goddess Satv\u00e1i is cut in two, and one-half tied round each of the child's wrists. After three months the father's people fetch the child and its mother to the father's house, and its hair is clipped on some lucky day. When a Gavandi is on the point of death he is laid on a blanket, and water mixed with sweet basil or tulsi leaves, and a piece of gold are put in his mouth. After death the body is bathed in warm water on the house steps, a silk cloth is wound round the waist, and the body is laid on the bier, red and scented powders are sprinkled over it, and it is covered with a white sheet, to whose hem are tied a few grains of rice and a copper coin. Both men and women follow the body to the burning ground. About half-way the bier is lowered, the rice and the copper are laid on one side, the bier is again raised and they go to the burning ground. While the pile is building, the chief mourner bathes and has his head and moustache shaved, and the body is laid on the pile. The chief mourner again bathes, dips the hem of his robe in water, squeezes some drops into the dead mouth, and sets fire to the pile. When the pile is half burnt the chief mourner takes the jar in which he brings fire, fills it with water, bores three holes in it, goes thrice round the pyre and dashes the pot on the ground, and beats his mouth with the back of his hand. Then the mourners bathe, pluck a little grass, return to the house of mourning, and sprinkle the grass on the spot where the dead breathed his last. Ashes are\nspread on the grass to show footprints, cooked rice is laid close by, and the whole is covered with a basket. Neighbours and kinspeople bring cooked food and ask the mourners to eat. They mourn the dead ten days, and on the twelfth hold a feast, when the four bier-bearers are the chief guests. The funeral priest is presented with a cot, bedding, waterpot, umbrella, walking stick, and shoes, to help the dead along the weary way to heaven. The mourners are taken to M\u00e1ru\u1e6di\u2019s temple, bow to the god, and are brought back, and the neighbours return to their homes. Sagar Gavandis are bound together by a strong caste feeling. They have no headman, and settle social disputes at meetings of men of their own and of other castes. The spread of English law and of lawyers has weakened the power of caste, and the people are afraid to enforce their rules by the old penalties. They send their boys to school till they are about twelve, when their fathers take them to work as masons. N\u00e1r\u00e1yan B\u00e1puji a member of this caste was postmaster of Pandharpur for over twelve years and is now a Government pensioner. Another was a telegraph master of the Peninsula railway. The Sagars are beginning to keep their boys longer at school. They are a steady class.\n\nGhis\u00e1dis, or Tinkers, are returned as numbering 269 and as found wandering over the whole district. They are said to have originally passed from Gujar\u00e1t to Haidarabad and from Haidarabad, about five hundred years ago, to Shol\u00e1pur in search of work. Their commonest surnames are Chavh\u00e1n, K\u00e1te, Khetri, Padval, Pay\u00e1r, Shel\u00e1r, Solanke, and Suryavanshi, who eat together and intermarry. They are said to have sprung from Vishvakarma the framer of the universe, who brought out of fire the airan or anvil, the bh\u00e1ta or bellows, the s\u00e1ndas or tongs, the ghan or hammer, and the h\u00e1tod\u00ed or small hammer. He taught the Ghis\u00e1dis how to make the sudarshan chakra or Vishnu\u2019s discus, b\u00e1n or arrow, trishul or trident, n\u00e1l or horseshoe, khady or sword, and rath or war chariot. When these were prepared and approved by their master the caste came to be called Ghis\u00e1dis and were told to make various tools and weapons of war. They are strong, dark, dirty, drunken, hot-tempered, and hardworking. The men wear a tuft of hair on the crown of the head, and the moustache and beard. They speak a mixture of Gujar\u00e1ti and Mar\u00e1thi. They are wandering blacksmiths and tinkers. They have no regular dwelling but live in the open air, sometimes stretching a blanket over their heads as a shelter. They have cattle, and during the rainy season live in mud or thatched huts. They have a few brass and copper vessels, and are helped in their calling by their wives and children. They eat fish and flesh, and drink to excess. Their daily food is jv\u00e1ri, split pulse, and vegetables. The men wear a turban folded in Mar\u00e1tha fashion, a jacket, a shouldercloth, and a waistcloth; and their women the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, silver ornaments, and the lucky neckthread or mangalsutra. They make horse shoes, field tools including sickles, and cart axles and wheels. They hold their women impure for a month and a quarter after childbirth, and during that time the men do not worship the house gods, rub sandal on their brows, or get their heads shaved. The mother bathes after her impurity is\nover, and puts new bangles round her wrists, the old ones being removed and carried away by the bangle-seller. A ceremony called p\u00e1nchvi is performed on the fifth day after a birth, and another on the seventh when the child is cradled and named. The child\u2019s hair is not clipped until another child is born. If the mother shows no sign of being pregnant, the child\u2019s hair is clipped after a couple or three years. On the hair-cutting day the child\u2019s maternal uncle first cuts a lock of hair and puts it in a safe place, and the barber shaves off the rest. On some lucky day the lock which was put aside is offered to the village Satv\u00e1i and a feast is held. The goddess is offered cooked food and is asked to preserve the child. After the hair-clipping the child is bathed and dressed in new clothes presented by its maternal uncle. They have a betrothal ceremony which is performed one to five years before marriage. On the betrothal day, with kinspeople and music, the girl is taken to the boy\u2019s house, is presented with new clothes and a full set of ornaments, is feasted, and is sent back. In honour of the ceremony the girl\u2019s father presents the caste with \u00a31 10s. (Rs.15) in cash, of which a little is spent in buying gram and molasses, and distributed among relations, friends, and castefellows. The rest is spent on drink and sweetmeats. The boy\u2019s father has to give \u00a310 (Rs. 100) in cash to the girl\u2019s father. If the boy\u2019s father fails to pay this amount, the girl is offered to another boy on payment of \u00a325 (Rs. 250) to the former boy\u2019s father. Of this sum of \u00a325 (Rs. 250) \u00a35 (Rs. 50) are given to the caste and \u00a320 (Rs. 200) to the former boy\u2019s father, on account of the betrothal ceremony already performed by him and of the ornaments presented to the girl. All the ornaments along with the girl become the second boy\u2019s property. No second betrothal ceremony is performed. At the time of the marriage the boy stands with a dagger in his hand in front of the girl on an earthen altar, and a cloth is held between the boy and the girl. The Br\u00e1hmans repeat verses and they are husband and wife. Four near relations stand on the four sides of the boy and girl and pass cotton thread round them on their thumbs, cut the threads into two parts and tie them with two turmeric roots to the wrists of the boy and the girl. Feasts are exchanged, and the boy takes his wife to her new home, their sisters walking behind them with lighted dough-lamps in their hands. When the boy reaches his house the girl\u2019s father presents the boy with 6s. to 10s. (Rs.3-5) as safety money for bringing home his daughter without accident. This sum is spent either on sweetmeats or on liquor. A girl is held impure for five days when she comes of age. On the sixth day her lap is filled and her parents present her and the boy with clothes. That day is spent in feasting, but no flesh is eaten and no liquor is drunk. They burn their dead and mourn for eleven days. On the eleventh the chief mourner gets his head and moustache shaved, prepares eleven dough balls, and, taking one of the balls in his hands, jumps into the river or stream, leaves the ball at the bottom, and comes out. He does this eleven times, and when all the balls have been left under water he bathes, kindles a sacred fire, goes round it five times, and makes a long bow before it. A feast is held on the spot, and one of the party presents the mourner with a new turban. The\nBr\u00e1hman is given uncooked food, and a gondhal or a drum or daur dance is held during the night. On the twelfth his relations friends and castefellows feast the mourner and a sheep is slaughtered for the occasion. On the thirteenth cooked rice, split pulse, and butter are mixed together, served on castor or erand leaves, and laid on the spot where the body was burned, where the bier was rested, and where the deceased breathed his last. The ashes are removed and river water is poured over the spot. After a bath the mourner and his friends return to the mourner\u2019s house, sprinkle cold water on the bodies of the house people to make them entirely clean, and to rid him of his mourning, his friends offer the chief mourner a cup of sugared milk, and return to their homes. They allow widow marriage. They settle social disputes at caste meetings, and the fine is spent in drink. They do not send their boys to school and take to no new pursuits. They are a poor class.\n\nK\u00e1ranjkars, that is Fountain Makers, including Jingars, that is Saddlers, who call themselves Somvanshi \u00c1rya Kshatris, are returned as numbering 448 and as found over the whole district. They say that the Brahm\u00e1nd and Bhavishyottar pur\u00e1ns contain a full account of their origin. The founder of their caste was Mauktik, Mukdev, or Mukteshvar, whose temple is in Shiv K\u00e1nchi or the modern Conjeveram in Madras. The spot where Mukteshvar bathed and prayed is called Muktam\u00e1la Harini. Even two demons Chandi and Mundi were made holy by bathing there, and bathing at this spot still cleanses from sin. This place the K\u00e1ranjkars hold to be sacred and make pilgrimages to it. They have no divisions and have eight family stocks or gotras, the names of which are Angiras, Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1j, Garg, Gautam, Kanv, Kaundanya, V\u00e1lmik, and Vasishth. Their surnames are Chavh\u00e1n, G\u00e1dhe, Gavli, Honkalas, K\u00e1le, K\u00e1mble, Lohare, V\u00e1ghm\u00e1re, and Vasunde. Of these Chavh\u00e1ns belong to the Vasishth gotra, Mukteshvar pravar, Rudrag\u00e1yatri, Rigved, and the colour of the horse and chariot is white or shvet. Families belonging to the same family stock eat together but cannot intermarry. They have regular features and are neither dark nor fair. The men wear the top-knot and moustache and rub sandal on their brow. Their women, who are fair and pretty, tie the hair in a knot behind the head and rub redpowder on their brows. They use false hair but do not deck the head with flowers. The home tongue of most is Mar\u00e1thi, but some speak K\u00e1nareso both at home and abroad. Their houses are generally built of mud and stone with flat roofs, having a veranda or room in the front of the house to serve as a shop. Their houses are neat and clean and well-cared-for, and they keep servants to help in their shops, and cows, she-buffaloes, and parrots. They have generally a good store of brass copper and earthen vessels. They are not great eaters or drinkers, and their every-day food consists of rice bread, pulse, and vegetables. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. The men dress like Deccan Br\u00e1hmans in a waistcloth, coat, waistcoat, shouldercloth, head-scarf, Br\u00e1hman turban, and shoes. The women dress like Br\u00e1hman women, in a robe and bodice. Children go naked till four or five. After five a boy wears a loincloth, and a girl a petticoat and bodice.\nBoth men and women are neat and clean but are not tasteful in their dress and have no special liking for gay colours. Most of them have a fresh set of clothes for special occasions, a rich robe and bodice worth \u00a32 to \u00a36 (Rs. 20-60) which last for several years. They wear head, ear, nose, arm, and foot ornaments. They are sober, thrifty, hardworking, even-tempered, hospitable, orderly, and clever workers. They follow a variety of callings, making cloth-scabbards, and khogirs or pad-saddles and charj\u00e1mas or cloth-saddles, but not leather saddles. They make boxes and cradles, carve stones, paint and make figures of clay and cloth, pierce metal and paper plates, carve wood, make and repair padlocks, make and repair tin brass and copper pots, make gold and silver ornaments, cut diamonds, and make vin\u00e1s or lyres and s\u00e1rangis or fiddles and other musical instruments. Their women and children help in their work. Their children begin to work at seven and are skilled workers by twenty. If the boy belongs to their own caste he is expected to know something and is paid 16s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 8-10) according to the amount he does. If the boy belongs to another caste, from whom the workman does not expect much help, beyond blowing the fire and handing him articles, the boy is paid 2s. to 8s. (Rs. 1-4) a month, but if he proves intelligent and useful his wages are raised to \u00a31 to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 10-12) a month. A skilful workman seldom serves under another man. He opens a shop or works in partnership with his master. The Arya Kshatris always work to order, and keep no ready made articles in stock. The merchants who want the articles give them the metal agreeing to pay them at so much a pound. The yearly income of a working family, including a man his wife and two children, varies from \u00a310 to \u00a320 (Rs. 100-200). Their work is not constant and few of them have capital. According to their calling Jingars are known as Chit\u00e1ris, Jades, Loh\u00e1rs, N\u00e1lbands, Ot\u00e1ris or casters, Patvekars, Son\u00e1rs, Sut\u00e1rs, T\u00e1mbats, T\u00e1rkars or wire drawers, and Tar\u00e1sgars or scale-makers who eat together and intermarry. Besides receiving payment in cash they barter their wares for clothes and grain. They complain that the use of European and Australian copper sheets has taken from them part of their old calling, and, that since the 1876 famine, people have been too poor to paint their houses or to buy ornaments. They are somewhat depressed and some have sunk to be labourers. The uncertainty of their work and the large sums they spend on family observances have sunk some of them in debt. They have credit and borrow at one to two per cent a month. They claim to be Somvanshi Kshatris and their claim is supported by deeds or sanads given to them by the Shankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya of Shringeri in Maisur. The Arya Kshatris are Sm\u00e1rts and keep images of their gods in their houses. Their priests are ordinary Br\u00e1hmans, generally Deshasths to whom they pay great respect. They keep the usual Br\u00e1hmanic fasts and feasts, and make pilgrimages to Benares, Gaya, Jejuri, Shiv K\u00e1nchi, Tulj\u00e1pur, and Vishnu K\u00e1nchi near R\u00e1meshvar, and Mukteshvar near Seringapatam. Their teacher or guru is Shankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya whose chief monasteries are at Shringeri and Sankeshvar. Every two or\nthree years his followers make Shankaracharya a money present at 2s. (Re. 1) a year from each house. For her first child a young wife generally goes to her parents'. A room is cleaned, cowdunged, and furnished with a cot, and, when her time comes, a midwife is sent for, and the woman is taken to the lying-in room. The child is laid on a cloth on the ground and a hole is dug close by. The midwife washes the mother, cuts the child's navel cord, bathes the child in warm water, binds it in swaddling clothes, and lays it beside its mother on the cot. The hole is worshipped, betel and leaf packets are laid near it, and the navel cord and after-birth are buried outside of the house. The lying-in room is cowdunged and the mother's clothes are washed by the midwife. The mother is given a mixture of butter and assafoetida, and is fed on equal quantities of rice and butter. The child's head is marked with sweet oil and it is fed by sucking a piece of cloth soaked in cow's milk. A lighted lamp is laid near the mother's cot, and, according to the custom of the family, either five wheat flour lamps are lighted and kept burning in the mother's room for five days or one on the first day, two on the second, and so on to five lamps on the fifth day. Some make no dough lamps, and content themselves with a single brass lamp. On the fifth morning the child is bathed and a handful of vekhand or orris root powder is rubbed on its head, a hood is drawn over its head, and it is laid beside its mother. A grindstone and roller are laid in a corner of the mother's room, and thirty-two kinds of healing plants, herbs, and roots are laid on the grindstone. A penknife is also laid on the stone and worshipped by the midwife, if she belongs to the mother's caste. If the midwife does not belong to the mother's caste the mother herself lays before the grindstone cooked rice, sugar cakes, and five betel packets. A lighted lamp is placed near the grindstone and fed the whole night with oil. Of the five betel packets one is eaten by the mother and the four others are eaten by four young women, who keep watch the whole night over the mother and her child, playing with dice, odds and evens, and other games. Next morning some married woman or the midwife throws the dough lamps into a stream or river. The healing herbs are moved from the stone and given to the young mother. On the morning of the tenth the whole house is cowdunged, the mother and child are bathed, and all her clothes and the cot are washed. On the morning of the eleventh day the house is again cowdunged, the mother and child are bathed, her cot and clothes are again washed, and the men of the family change their threads. From this day the mother is touched by the people of the house, but she is not pure enough to enter the cook room or offer cooked food to the house gods. On the twelfth day, five married women whose children are alive, wash the child's cradle, rub it with turmeric and redpowder, and hang it from one of the house rafters. On the ground below the cradle is placed a leaf plate with a handful of wheat and on the plate a lighted dough lamp. In front of the lamp on a betel leaf are laid boiled gram, and the five married women mark the cradle with turmeric and redpowder. They fill one another's laps with boiled gram,\nbetelnut and leaves are served, and they go home. In the afternoon when the feast is ready, the five married women come with other guests who have been asked in the morning, and they dine and go home. In the evening women guests come with presents of caps, hoods, betel, rice, and dry cocoa-kernel. When all have come, a low wooden stool is set near the cradle, and the mother takes the child in her arms and goes and sits on the stool. The guests sit round her and the child\u2019s maternal grandmother fills the laps of women guests who do not belong to her daughter\u2019s family. The young mother\u2019s lap is filled by her mother or by a kinswoman, and copper anklets are put round the child\u2019s feet. The child\u2019s maternal grandmother marks her daughter\u2019s brow with redpowder and presents her with a bodice, fills her lap with rice and dry cocoa-kernel, and puts a hood on the child\u2019s head. The other women guests follow her example, presenting the child and mother with clothes, and filling the child\u2019s mother\u2019s lap. Then the child\u2019s father\u2019s sisters stand on each side of the cradle, dress a piece of sandalwood in a hood and child\u2019s other clothes, and pass it from one to another singing songs. The child is treated in the same way as the piece of sandalwood. It is then laid in the cradle and two women one after the other cry out kur-r-r in the child\u2019s ears, and slap each other gently on the back. Then a song is sung by the women guests, sugar and betel are served, and the guests withdraw. On a lucky day, in the third month, if the child is a boy, his head is shaved. In the morning on or below the veranda of the house a low wooden stool is set and on the stool is spread a piece of bodice cloth or cholkhan sprinkled with grains of rice. The child\u2019s maternal uncle takes the child on his knee, sits on the cloth, and, while musicians play, the barber cuts the child\u2019s hair with a pair of scissors, leaving a top and two ear tufts. The uncle leaves his seat with the child in his arms, and, seating the child on another stool, rubs it with fragrant oil and five married women bathe it in warm water and rub its brow with redpowder. It is then dressed in its best clothes, ornaments are put on, and it is seated on a stool. The guests present the child and its mother with clothes. The barber is given the piece of cloth on which the uncle sat while the child\u2019s hair was being cut, ten copper coins, a betel packet, and uncooked food. The child is taken to the village temple with women guests and musicians, the god is presented with a copper coin and a betel packet, they bow to him and withdraw. A feast is held and the guests go home. When the boy is two or three years old comes the top-knot keeping. In the morning a low wooden stool is set on the veranda covered with a piece of bodice cloth, grains of rice are sprinkled over it, and the boy is seated on it and held from behind by his father. The barber shaves the child\u2019s head and the two ear tufts but leaves around top-knot. The child\u2019s body is rubbed with fragrant oil and he is bathed. A new cloth is wound round his waist and he is carried into the house where he is dressed in rich clothes and taken to the village temple with women guests and music. A copper coin and a betel packet are laid before the god and they return to the child\u2019s house. Married women are presented\nwith turmeric and redpowder, and a feast is held when a couple of sweet dishes are prepared and the guests withdraw. When the boy is between seven and nine the boy's father asks the village astrologer to fix a lucky time for performing the thread-girding. The astrologer names a day, and the father goes home, tells the house people what the astrologer said, goes to the market, and, for luck buys 1s. (8 as.) worth of turmeric root and 6d. (4 as.) worth of redpowder. On a lucky day three to five handmills are set in the house. To the neck of each, in a piece of yellow cloth, are tied a turmeric root, a few grains of rice, and a betelnut. Five married women who have children alive are called and asked to grind a handful of turmeric, and they grind it singing songs. After the turmeric has been ground into powder it is poured into a metal pot, the grinders are presented with turmeric and redpowder, and return to their homes. The house people set to making preparations buying grain, butter, oil, molasses, and clothes. A booth is raised, and, in a yellow cloth, a betelnut, a turmeric root, and a few grains of rice are tied to one of the booth posts which is called muhurtmedh or the lucky post. The morning before the day fixed men and women, with the family priest and music, go to the houses of relations, friends, and neighbours, and to the village god asking them to come next day to the thread-girding. After they return the marriage god or devak is installed as among Br\u00e1hmans. In the evening an altar is raised by the housepeople measuring five and a half spans broad by the boy's hand and nine spans long and whitewashed. On this day all married women of the caste and boys whose munj or grass thread has not been taken off are asked to dine. Early on the thread-girding morning the boy's parents bathe, and a barber is called. The priest asks the barber to bring the razor with which he is going to shave the boy's head. The barber takes the razor out of his leather bag and lays it on the ground. The priest mutters verses over it, throws a few grains of red rice over it, and, taking it in his hands, cuts a strand of the sacred thread with it, as if to test its sharpness, and, with another blade of sacred grass, draws lines over it and gives it back to the barber. The boy is seated on a low wooden stool, and the barber shaves his head except the topknot. The boy is bathed, his brow is marked with red sandal powder, and he dines from the same plate with his mother in company with married women and boys who have not ceased to wear the munj or grass cord. When his meal is still unfinished, the boy is made to leave the dining plate, his hands and mouth are washed, and he is seated in front of the barber. The barber again shaves the boy's head except the topknot, and a married woman rubs him with fragrant oil, bathes him, marks his brow with red sandal, and seats him on a stool near his father. The priest repeats verses, sprinkles water on the boy's head from the point of a blade of sacred grass, gives him a silk loincloth to wear, and blesses a sacred thread and puts it round the boy's left shoulder so as to fall on his right side. The priest holds in his hand a pimgal Ficus religiosa staff or dand, three feet nine inches long, to which is tied another loincloth and stands facing the boy. The boy is made\nto stand on the low wooden stool on which he had been sitting, and\nthe men and women stand round the boy with grains of rice in their\nhands. A cloth is held between the boy and the staff, and the priest\nrepeats verses. When the verses are over, the cloth is pulled to one\nside, and the boy is seated on his father's lap, who eleven times over\nwhispers the gadyatri or sun-hymn in the boy's right ear. The boy\ntakes his seat on the altar, lights the sacrificial fire with the help of\nthe priest, and feeds it with clarified butter, sesamum seeds, and\nparched rice. Next the boy comes off the altar and stands close by\non a low wooden stool, a cord of twisted sacred grass is tied round\nhis waist, and another along with the sacred thread, is put round\nhis shoulders. He takes the staff or dand in his hands, walks into\nthe house, makes a bow before his house gods, comes out, and he is\nagain seated on the altar along with the priest. Married women\nbring sugar balls and lay them on the altar, and every one present,\nmen women and children, takes in his hand a ladle to which a lucky\nthread or mangalsutra is tied, puts a sugar ball and a silver or\ncopper coin into the ladle, and when the boy calls Om bhavati bhiksh\u00e1n\ndehi, Give alms, oh lady, in God's name, rolls the coin out of the ladle\ninto his bag. The money is gathered, a few coppers are added, and\nthe whole is divided into two equal shares, one of which is given\nto the priest and the other is divided among the Br\u00e1hman guests.\nAfter this the boy dines and the priest is given uncooked food or\nshidha and 6d. (4 as.) in cash. The priest also gets a further fee of\n3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) in cash. The guests then feast on sweetmeats, betel is\nserved, and they withdraw. At five in the evening the priest goes\nto the boy's, seats him on a low wooden stool, teaches him the\nprayer or sandhya, and continues to come and teach him every day\ntill he learns it. On the second day nothing particular is done and\non the third day the sacrificial fire is put out. In the morning of\nthe third day the boy is bathed and seated on the altar close to the\npriest. The priest repeats verses and the boy feeds the fire with\nbutter. Then water mixed with milk is sprinkled on the fire to put\nit out or as they say to make it calm or sh\u00e1nt. The Br\u00e1hman is\ngiven uncooked food and a couple of annas. A dish of cakes is\nprepared and eaten in the house. The guardian gods are bowed out\nand the booth is pulled down, and if the boy's family deity is a\ngoddess a gondhal dance is performed. From the Gondhli's house\na broad hollow pipe or chavandika is brought and worshipped along\nwith the family gods and cooked food is offered to them. A few\nmarried women and the Gondhlis are feasted. The dancers bring\nwith them two bags or jholis, three baskets or kotambalis stuck all\nover with cowrie shells, and a metal lamp or divti which they call\nthe goddess Amba Bhav\u00e1ni. These are placed in a line on the\nground and the boy's father bows before them, and, on five betel\nleaves, lays all kinds of food cooked in the house. The guests\nincluding the dancers dine, betel packets are offered them, and\nthe married women and the dancers are each presented with a copper\ncoin. They retire leaving the goddess that is the lighted lamp in\nthe booth. About nine or ten at night the dance is begun and the\nGondhlis go on dancing and singing till six next morning. At the\nend of the dance the dancers are presented with an old turban or\nrobe and a rupee in cash. Then comes the munj loosening or sodmunj which takes place from the fifth day to two, three, or six years after the thread-girding, but always before the boy's marriage. On the morning of the munj loosening a barber is called, and the boy's head is shaved, and he is bathed by married women. The cords of sacred grass which at the thread-girding were tied round his waist and shoulders are brought from the place where they have been kept, and are tied round his waist and shoulders as before. A sacrificial fire is kindled with the help of the Br\u00e1hman priest and fed with butter and parched rice. The boy leaves his seat and sits close by on another low wooden stool. He is dressed in a waistcloth, turban, coat, and shoulderloth, lamplack is rubbed on his eyes, shoes are drawn over his feet, a walking stick and an umbrella are put in his hands, a bag of rice is laid on his right shoulder, and he is told to ask leave of all present to go to Benares to study the Veds. He asks leave to go. If they agree he walks a few paces, when his maternal uncle stops him, begs him to give up the idea of an ascetic life, and to return, marry his daughter, and lead the life of a householder. The boy comes back and makes over the bag to the priest with about 1s. (8 as.) in cash. The priest is given uncooked food, and the day ends with a feast.\n\nA'rya Kshatris marry their girls between five and eleven, or, on pain of loss of caste, at least before they come of age. Boys may be married at any time and are generally married between twelve and eighteen. The parents limit the choice to families of the same caste, and, among castefellows, to families of a different stock or gotra. In families who have a young daughter the women of the house consulting with the men fix on some boy as a good match for their daughter. The girl's father goes to the boy's house, and, after dining, stands on the veranda, looking for a passer-by. He accosts one, and asks him to intercede on his behalf, as he has come from his own village in the hope of getting the son of the owner of the house to marry his daughter. The stranger agrees, leaving any work however urgent, as the helper of a marriage gains merit. He walks in and asks the householder to come out. The three seat themselves on a blanket or carpet, and the go-between explains to the host the object of the guest's visit. He praises the guest and his family and declares that his daughter is healthy handsome and wise. The householder says he does not wish his son to be married, times are hard, and he must consult his people. After much persuasion and flattery, the householder agrees, but says he must first see the girl and decide whether she is suitable for his son. The guest asks the householder to call his son. When he comes, the guest asks the boy his name and his family name, puts him several questions, asks him to show his copy and study books, makes him read and write a little, shows him a picture or a drawing and asks him what fault it has, and if the boy can draw asks him to show some of his work. After having satisfied himself the guest asks the host to fix a day on which he will come to the girl's house to see her. A day is named and the girl's father and the go-between leave. The boy's father talks the matter over with his wife and other members of the house. He tells them he should much like to get his boy\nmarried during his lifetime. On the day named he starts for the girl's house and puts up there. The girl is dressed in rich clothes, decked with ornaments, and brought forward and shown to the boy's father, and one or two relations or neighbours whom the girl's father has asked to be present. The boy's father, taking the girl by her hand, seats her on his lap, and, that he may see her more plainly, another person in front calls the girl and seats her on his lap. He asks her her name, and her parents' and brothers' names, and after a few more questions, she is told to bow before the boy's father and the rest of the company, and then walks into the house. Betel is served and the guests retire. If the boy's father approves of the girl a few Br\u0101hmans are called, and the boy's and girl's horoscopes are handed them and they compare them to see if they agree. If they agree the girl is called, and the boy's father presents her with a robe and bodice, she goes into the house and puts them on, and takes her seat as before. A packet of sugar is handed her which she takes, bows before them all, and walks into the house. The girl's father presents the boy's father with a new turban, betel is handed, and the guests prepare to leave. Before they go the boy's father asks the guests to wait for a short time, as he is anxious to settle some points before returning home. Then, either himself or some one on his behalf, asks the girl's father how much money he wishes settled on the boy and what clothes and ornaments he expects to be given to the girl. The girl's father says he is willing to give \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) in cash as hunda or dowry and \u00a35 (Rs. 50) worth of outfit or karni. After much haggling the cash and the outfit together are fixed at \u00a310 (Rs. 100). Lists are made of things to be presented to the boy by the girl's father and to the girl by the boy's father, read, and handed to the fathers. Then the Br\u0101hmans are asked to fix some lucky day for the marriage. After the marriage day or muhurt is fixed, sugar and betel packets are handed and presents made to Br\u0101hmans. The boy's father is feasted and returns to his home. On his return he sets to work, buying grain, clothes, ornaments, and other articles required for the wedding. Red-sprinkled invitation cards are sent to distant kinspeople, and, if the boy's parents do not live in the same village with the girl's, the boy's people ask the villagers to come with them and they start so as to reach the girl's village at least a couple of days before the marriage. At the girl's village a house is hired for the boy's party, marriage booths are built at both houses, and an image of the god Ganpati is drawn under the front door of each house. When the boy's party comes close to the girl's village, they send a message to the girl's parents.\n\n---\n\n1 The lists are to the following effect: Y\u0101di or list of articles to be presented to the daughter of R\u0101mchandra B\u0101b\u0101j\u012b inhabitant of Shol\u0101pur by Govind B\u0101p\u016b inhabitant of Kolhapur, the boy's father, five chirdis or girls' robes, five cholis or bodices, three turbans, three sashes, three rich robes, three common robes, one silver chain, one pair of silver feet chains or v\u0101d\u0101s; one pair of silver toe rings or jodvis, one gold belp\u0101n and one gold kevda for the head, one puty\u0101chindal or coin necklace, one pair of b\u0101lis or earrings, nosering, and one pair of gold wristlets or p\u0101tis. Y\u0101di or note of articles to be presented to the son of Govind B\u0101p\u016b inhabitant of Kolhapur by R\u0101mchandra B\u0101b\u0101j\u012b inhabitant of Shol\u0101pur, the girl's father, dowry or hunda Rs. 25 in cash, one silk robe, three waistcloths, eight turbans, eight sashes, three robes, three bodices, and metal vessels worth \u00a31 (Rs. 10).\nevening a party start in procession with a gaily trapped horse and music, and seating the boy on the horse, bring him to his lodgings, followed by a number of carts containing guests, furniture, and clothes. This procession is called varh\u00e1d or marriage. The house is lighted and the guests are seated, and, when betel has been served, they are taken over to their new lodging, shown the rooms, where to store their goods, and where to cook, sleep, and sit. A cook is sent to the boy\u2019s lodgings with uncooked dishes, and, after they are cooked, the guests are feasted, one of the girl\u2019s party acting as host. The invitation to the village god and other guests, the installation of the marriage gods, and the simant pujan or boundary worship are the same as among Komtis. An earthen altar is raised at the girl\u2019s, seven by eleven of the girl\u2019s spans, the back rising about eighteen inches above the altar in three six inch tiers each narrower than the tier below it. When finished the whole is whitewashed. Twenty-six earthen pots, including five covers, are brought from a potter\u2019s and laid near one another. Next morning four plantain posts or kh\u00e1mbs are set one at each corner of the altar. Near each post are piled five earthen vessels one above the other, a fifth pile is raised to the right of the altar, and the topmost pot in each of the five piles is closed by an earthen lid or cover called yelni. Married women rub the girl with turmeric and bathe her, and the rest of the turmeric is taken to the boy\u2019s in a plate with music and the present of a turban, sash, waist-cloth, and a cup of oil. The boy\u2019s relations rub the boy with turmeric, bathe him, and the girl\u2019s relations present him with clothes. He wears the waistcloth, rolls the turban round his head, covers his body with the sash, and walks into the house. The plate and cup are left as a present to the boy, and the girl\u2019s relations are starting to return, when they are asked to wait and accompany the boy\u2019s party to the girl\u2019s. The boy\u2019s relations take in a plate, a green robe and bodice, a betel packet, almonds, rice, dry dates, and turmeric roots and with music go to the girl\u2019s. They call the girl, give her the bodice and robe to wear, fill her lap with the almonds turmeric roots and other articles brought in the plate, and the boy\u2019s party return home. Near the altar the astrologer sets a bathing tub or gh\u00e1ng\u00e1l on rice grains, fills it with cold water, and floats a copper cup in it with a small hole in its bottom. Each time the cup sinks, the astrologer marks a line on the wall with wet red-powder. In front of the waterpot he sets a lighted lamp and sits all the while repeating verses. A procession from the boy\u2019s house starts accompanied by kinsmen and kinswomen, the priest, and music, and taking a robe and bodice, silver anklets or v\u00e1l\u00e1s and silver chains or s\u00e1nkhl\u00e1\u015b, gold wristlets or p\u00e1tl\u00eds, a gold coin necklace or putlyanchim\u00e1l, and earrings or b\u00e1l\u00eds, also rice, dry cocoa-kernel, turmeric roots, betel, redpowder, sugar, and 2s. (Re.1) in copper. They are all seated and the girl is called and presented with the robe, bodice, and ornaments. Her father is presented with a turban, and after betel is served and Br\u00e1hmans are paid, the guests retire. After this comes the marriage ceremony. On the marriage morning, from the girl\u2019s house, the girl\u2019s sister, holding a metal plate with a lighted lamp in it, and giving a servant a second\nplate with a flower garland, nosegay, cocoanut, and a cup of sweet milk, and, accompanied by married girls and boys and musicians, goes to the boy\u2019s house. They are seated on a carpet and the boy is called. When he comes he is seated on the carpet and one of the girl\u2019s relations puts the garland round his neck, sticks the nosegay in his turban, and asks him to drink the milk. Marriage ornaments or mund\u00e1vols are put round his brow, he bows before the house gods, is seated on a horse, and, followed by his and the girl\u2019s sisters, with lighted lamps in their hands and kinspeople, friends, and music, goes in procession to the village M\u00e1runi and from that to the girl\u2019s. When the boy comes near the gate of the girl\u2019s marriage hall, the girl\u2019s mother goes in front of him, waves curds and cooked rice round his face, and throws them on one side. She then takes a whitewashed copper waterpot, touches the boy\u2019s eyes with a little water from the pot, and pours the rest on the horse\u2019s feet. The boy\u2019s father presents her with a bodice, and the girl\u2019s father waving a cocoanut round the boy\u2019s head dashes it on the ground. The girl\u2019s brother takes him off the horse, leads him into the marriage hall, and seats him on the carpet with the other guests. The girl\u2019s priest draws near, asks him to take off his coat, waistcoat, turban, and shoes, and the girl\u2019s father presents him with a new silk waistcloth. Then the madhupark or honey-sipping is performed with the same details as among Br\u00e1hmans. Rolls of betel leaves are placed in the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s hands, they are made to stand in front of each other on low wooden stools, and a necklace of black glass beads is tied round the girl\u2019s neck. Between the two wooden stools is laid a sandal grindstone or sah\u00e1n which the boy and girl touch with their toes and a cloth is held between them. In the middle of the cloth is drawn a redpowder cross or nandi, and the boy and girl are told to fix their eyes on the red lines. Behind both the boy and girl stand their maternal uncles and red rice is handed to the guests. The priests repeat marriage verses, and, at the end, throw red rice on the heads of the couple and they are husband and wife. Betel is served, money is presented to Br\u00e1hmans and other beggars, and the guests retire. The cloth and the sandal grindstone are removed and the boy and the girl are seated on the low wooden stools on which they were standing. Five Br\u00e1hmans sit round the couple, repeat verses, and taking a cotton thread dip it in water and pass it seven and nine times round the couple. The thread is divided in two and laid in a plate along with two turmeric roots and worshipped by the boy and girl. Turmeric roots are tied to the two threads, the thread of seven turns being tied to the girl\u2019s wrist and the thread of nine turns to the boy\u2019s wrist. This is called the tying of the wristlets or kankans, and silver toe-rings or jodvis are also put round the girl\u2019s big toes. The boy and girl leave their places and are seated on the altar or low wooden stools near each other, the girl to the left of the boy. A married woman brings fire from the house, and, setting it on the altar in front of the boy, marks her brow with redpowder and retires. The boy feeds the sacrificial fire with butter, and the girl feeds it with parched grain which her brother hands her. This ends the hom ceremony, and the boy and girl walk into the house. The ear-squeezing ceremony is not performed but on\naccount of it the boy's father presents the girl's brother with a turban. The boy and girl dine in company with other children, and after the guests have all dined, the marriage day is over. On the morning of the second day the girl's kinspeople accompanied by music go to the boy's and ask his party to a feast at their house. The boy and girl are rubbed with turmeric and they play games at odds and evens and bite off rolls of betel leaves from each other's mouths. They are then bathed and dine with children. About twelve the girl's kinsmen go to the boy's house with music and fetch the men to dine at their house. After the men have dined the women are brought and after dining they too retire. On the third day the same ceremonies are performed as on the second day except that the women walk on cloths which the washerwomen spread in front of them. The girl's mother washes the boy's mother's feet with warm water and presents her with a comb and five brass boxes and a washing pot or tast. About eight in the evening the girl's mother and a few kinsmen and kinswomen go to the boy's with music and take their seat in the house on carpets and mats. The boy's parents with relations and friends and the girl's relations all leave for the girl's house, on the way throwing redpowder or gul\u0101l on one another and rubbing it on one another's faces. When they reach the house door, the boy's mother refuses to enter unless she is given a rich paithani robe. The girl's party at once promise her one but she refuses to move unless it is given into her hands on the spot. The girl's relations then give her 10s. (Rs.5) in cash and she walks into the house, the rest of her company following her. The boy's mother dresses in old clothes, her body is rubbed with fragrant oil and powders, and she is bathed in warm water. Such of her relations as wish are also bathed in the same way. Then the boy and girl are rubbed with turmeric and bathed. The boy puts on a silk waistcloth, kindles a sacrificial fire, and feeds it with butter. The girl's father presents him with a suit of new clothes, which he puts on and sits on a low wooden stool in the marriage hall, and the girl sits on another in front of him. The girl's parents sit beside their daughter. In front of the boy and girl a heap of wheat is made and over it is placed a big red earthen jar or dera. Round the big jar are set four small earthen pots or madkis. Then a piece of thread is fastened from each of the small pots to the great jar. When the four little pots are tied to the great jar a few grains of rice are dropped in each of the five pots and the big jar is closed with an earthen lid or yelni, and the mouths of the four small pots are covered with betel leaves. Then over each of the four small pots a lighted dough lamp is set and a big lamp on the big jar, and twenty-one lamps on a round bamboo plate called shiptar or padli. The girl's parents worship all the twenty-six lamps, and the girl leaves her seat and sits beside the boy on a low wooden stool. The girl's father marks the boy's brow with sandal and the girl's mother marks the girl's brow with redpowder. The girl's father throws a garland round the boy's neck and a nosegay is stuck in his turban. The boy's father presents the girl with a robe, bodice, cash, hair ornaments, and a nosering. She goes into the house, dresses in the new robe and bodice,\nputs on the ornaments, and throws the sash or *shela* over her head. The girl\u2019s mother makes small grain-like balls or *maltya* of wheat flour, and fills the girl\u2019s lap with them, and tells her and the boy pointing to the big jar that the big jar is to warm their daily bath water, the jar lid is to be their dinner plate, and the four small earthen pots are to be their daily cooking pots. The girl\u2019s father sets the bamboo basket with the lighted lamps first on the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s heads, and then on the heads of the boy\u2019s father, mother, and paternal uncles. The girl\u2019s mother takes the bamboo basket in her turn and sets it on the heads of the boy\u2019s mother and her near kinswomen. The boy\u2019s father presents the girl\u2019s father with a new turban and cash and the boy\u2019s mother presents the girl\u2019s mother with a rich robe as a *potjh\u00e1hni* or stomacher and the girl\u2019s other relations with bodices. The girl\u2019s mother presents the boy\u2019s mother with a rich robe and bodices, or robes to close relations. The boy goes into the house, takes one of the girl\u2019s house gods, and hides it in his clothes. He comes back to the booth and is presented with a waterpot and cup and a brass lamp. The boy and girl are seated on horseback, and, accompanied by kinspeople and music, are taken to the boy\u2019s house. At the boy\u2019s the *Lakshmipurjan* or Lakshmi worship is performed with the same rites as are described in the Komti account. That night the girl stays at the boy\u2019s house. Next morning the boy and girl bathe and are taken to the girl\u2019s house where they dress in silk clothes, and take their seats on low wooden stools near each other. The priest repeats verses, and the threads or *kankans* are untied from the wrists of the boy and girl, laid in a plate, and worshipped by the boy and girl, after which a pinch of rice is thrown over them and their guardian power leaves them. A hole is dug somewhere near the house, milk is sprinkled over the hole, and the two strings with the turmeric roots are buried in it. The women guests throw a few rice grains over the five piles of earthen jars. Five are kept for the use of the girl\u2019s mother and the rest are handed among the women guests. The boy\u2019s sister cowdungs the altar and throws two robes over it which become the girl\u2019s mother\u2019s property. The boy and girl are taken to the boy\u2019s house and the girl\u2019s parents and relations are feasted. Meanwhile at the boy\u2019s house the marriage gods are bowed out. Next day the marriage gods at the girl\u2019s house are bowed out and the boy\u2019s party are feasted. If their family deity is the Tulj\u00e1pur Bhav\u00e1ni a *gondhal* dance is held that night. After a couple of days the boy\u2019s party has a final feast and starts for its own village. A plateful of sweetmeats or *k\u00e1navl\u00e1s* are presented to the women of the boy\u2019s party, who distribute them among all the women present. The girl is presented with a variety of sweetmeats and the girl goes to her new home. When they reach the boy\u2019s home the Lakshmi worship is repeated. The girl is kept for a week or so, is presented with a new robe and bodice, and is sent back to her parents. When a girl comes of age her mother sends a message or a letter to the girl\u2019s father-in-law to say that he has been blessed with a grandson. If they belong to the same village, on receipt of the message, the girl\u2019s father-in-law tells his wife the news. The messenger is given a packet of betelnut and leaves and a handful of sugar and goes\nback. The boy's parents talk the matter over. If the boy is young or the day is not lucky, word is sent to the girl's house that it does not suit them at present to bring the girl to their house. The girl's mother then makes a bamboo frame, folds a turban round it, and seats her girl in it on a low wooden stool. She is offered turmeric and redpowder, and her lap is filled with rice, betel, and dry cocoa-kernel. The lap-filling is repeated for three days, and, on the morning of the fifth day, she bathes and becomes pure. Five married women fill her lap with rice grains, turmeric roots, betel, dry dates, and almonds, and she is feasted on some sweet dish. After about a month when she is at her father-in-law's she is again seated in a frame, as at her mother's and her lap is filled. On the second day the girl's mother takes her a present of sugared milk and biscuits, and feasts her along with some children. On the third morning the same ceremony is observed as on the second, and on the fourth morning nothing is done beyond bathing the girl. On the fifth morning the boy and girl bathe as usual and are seated in the frame. The girl's parents come with presents of a robe, bodice, waistcloth, turban, flowers, rice, cocoanuts, and fruit. The girl's mother marks her brow with redpowder and presents the boy and girl with the clothes. They go into the house, put on the new clothes, come back, and again seat themselves in the frame. A flower garland is put round the boy's neck, a nosegay is fastened in his turban, the girl's lap is filled with fruit rice and betel, and the boy takes a cocoanut and puts it in the girl's lap. The boy puts on a silk waistcloth, and sits on a low wooden stool the girl sitting on another stool close to him. The god Ganesh is worshipped, with the help of the Br\u00e4hman priest, a sacred fire is lit and fed with butter and parched rice. The boy and girl are rubbed with fragrant oils and bathed in warm water. They then dress in fresh clothes and are presented with new clothes. Betel packets are handed round, and, if the parents are well-to-do, a feast is given, the girl serving butter on at least five of the dinner plates. After the feast is over the girl's mother makes the girl a present of a set of betel dishes, bedding, lamps, water vessels, cups and saucers, and a carpet, and retires. In the evening the boy's mother asks the girl to spread the bedding in one of the bedrooms, to fill the waterpot with cold water, to put a wick and oil in the lamp and to light it, and to make packets of betelnut and leaves. When she has made all these ready the boy is asked to walk into the room, and the girl follows with a lighted lamp in her hands, and the mother closes the door behind her. The little wife washes the boy's feet with the water she brought in the jar, rubs his body with fragrant powder, throws a flower garland round his neck, and fastens a bouquet in his turban, offers him milk, and betel, and waves the lamp round his face. In the seventh month of a girl's first pregnancy, a letter is sent to her parents, asking them to a feast at the boy's in honour of the event. No one attends the dinner except the girl's father, who brings a robe, bodice, turban, and grain. To avoid two dinners, the girl's father hands the grain to the boy's father, and a joint feast is given. The boy and girl are presented with the robe, bodice, and turban and the father takes back his daughter to.\nhis house. The boy's father says, Why take the girl she is both your and my child. Let her stay here and spare yourself the expense. If the girl's father is anxious to take his child home with him the boy's father allows him. After the girl has gone to her father's she is now and then taken to some garden on the banks of a river and feasted. If no river is near she is seated on a swinging cot, songs are sung, and she is feasted on dainties.\n\nShortly before death a dying Jinger is laid on a blanket and his son sits with his father's head on his right knee. Water in which a Br\u00e1hman's toe has been washed, a few drops of the Ganges water, and the five cow gifts are dropped into the dying mouth. When all is over relations gather round the dead and weep. A bamboo bier is made, and the body is brought out of the house and laid on the house steps. Its head is rubbed with butter and warm water is poured over the body. It is dressed in a flax or t\u00e1g waistcloth and covered with a white sheet. It is then tied to the bier with a cord and carried to the burning ground with a copper coin and rice grains tied to one of the hems of the sheet. The chief mourner goes in front carrying an earthen fire-pot and the other mourners follow. Somewhere near the burning ground the bier is lowered and the copper coin and the rice are laid by the side of the road, the bearers lift the bier on their shoulders, and carry it to the burning ground. A pile of cowdung cakes is made and blessed by the Br\u00e1hman priest who throws a few sesamum seeds over it. The chief mourner bathes, has his head and moustache shaved, and again bathes. The body is laid on the pile, a handful of rice is cooked and a ball of wheat flour made, and, after offering the ball and cooked rice and throwing sesamum seed on them, they are laid on the dead man's chest. The mourner dips his shoulder-cloth into water, squeezes a few drops into the dead man's mouth, and the pile is lit. The Br\u00e1hman priest throws a few sesamum seeds over the pyre, repeats verses, and after boring the jar in three places, the chief mourner walks round the pile thrice, and throws the jar backwards over his shoulder on the ground beating his mouth with his open hand. He takes a pebble from the spot where the jar fell and brings it home as the stone of life or jivkhada, and lays it in some safe place. All the mourners bathe and each carrying a nimb branch they return to the deceased's house. The spot where the deceased breathed his last is cowdunged, and each mourner, taking a leaf or two of the nimb tree, throws it on the spot and returns home. The neighbours bring cooked food for the mourners and ask them to dine. They tell them they do wrong to weep for the dead has gone to God; all has been well with him. He was fortunate in having friends to drop the holy water in his mouth and to close his eyes. Weeping will never bring him back. It does him evil not good for every tear swells to a river which the poor soul crosses with great suffering. The mourners, to please their friends, try not to think of their sorrow and eat a little and the neighbours leave. Before he eats the chief mourner makes a rice ball and lays it under a basket on the spot where the deceased breathed his last. Next morning with a Br\u00e1hman priest, the chief mourner takes the stone of life to the burning ground, cooks rice,\nmakes a wheat flour cake, and, placing it on a small earthen pot, offers it to the stone and throws it into the river or stream. The chief mourner returns home, and, before dining, lays some cooked rice in front of the rice ball. On the morning of the third day the rice flour ball and the nimb leaves are removed and taken to the burning ground; the spot where the dead breathed his last is cowdunged, and a lighted lamp is set on it, and kept burning night and day till the tenth day. At the burning ground the mourner gathers all the ashes, throws them into the water along with the nimb leaves and rice ball he brought from his house, bathes, and returns home. On the fourth day he takes wheat flour and rice, goes to the burning ground, bathes and prepares four wheat balls one on account of the third day ceremony and three on account of the vedishraddh or altar mind-rite which he lays each at one corner of an earthen triangle. On the morning of the fourth day a wheat ball and cooked rice are offered to the stone of life, sesamum seed is dropped over it, and the offering is thrown into the river. This is repeated on the fifth and sixth, and daily up to the ninth. On the tenth day six balls and cakes are made, one on account of that day and five on account of the vedishraddh or the altar mind-rite, offered to the lifestone, and thrown along with the stone into the river. By the time the mourner returns, the house is cowdunged and all the clothes are washed. On the eleventh day, the lamp, which was kept burning at the place where the dead breathed his last, is put out, and the men belonging to the deceased\u2019s family go to the river to bathe, sip the five cow gifts, and change their sacred threads. On this day the chief mourner makes seventeen dough balls, one larger than the rest on account of that day, and sixteen on account of the shodashi shraddh or sixteen-ball mind-rite, and offers them on a leaf plate to the deceased and his ancestors. Sesamum seed is dropped on them and cooked rice ball is laid before them, and the chief mourner takes the large ball, and, at some distance from the rest, lays it for the crows. After the crows have eaten or at least touched the big ball the remaining balls are thrown into the river. Then, besides a cow and calf, ten presents or dashd\u00e1ns are made to Br\u00e1hmans. On the twelfth day three dough balls and a long piece of dough like a stone rolling-pin, eight fingers by three, are made, and laid on a leaf-plate. The chief mourner takes a few blades of sacred grass, twists them into a cord, and divides the dough rolling-pin in three parts. He takes each of the three parts of the dough rolling-pin, adds it to each of the three balls, and, by sprinkling water over them, offers the balls to the spirit of the dead, his father, and his grandfather. The balls are then thrown into the river, the chief mourner bathes, and other three balls are prepared, worshipped, and thrown into water. Br\u00e1hmans are presented with a blanket, a walking stick, a fan, an umbrella, an earthen jar, uncooked food, and money. On the thirteenth day a shraddh or mind-rite is performed and castefellows are feasted. Presents are made to Br\u00e1hmans, a cow with her calf, a waterpot, a set of betel dishes, sacred books, a rosary of basil or other beads, and a lighted lamp with butter enough to last for a considerable time. On the fourteenth the mourner\u2019s head is shaved, and Br\u00e1hmans and near kinsfolk are feasted on gram cakes. Red\nsandal is rubbed on the mourner's brow and the Br\u00e1hmans bless him and retire. About three more mind-rites or shr\u00e1ddhs are performed, one a month or six months after the death, the second on the death day, and the third on some day before the death day. The \u00c1rya Kshatris have a caste council and settle social disputes at meetings of castemen. Breaches of caste rules are punished by fines which take the form of caste feasts. If the offender is poor, a service of betel takes the place of a dinner. Of late the authority of caste has grown weak. Their boys go to school but they remain there only till they can read write and cast accounts.

For the first three days the mother is fed on rice and butter and the child on castor oil and honey. On the fourth day the mother for the first time suckles her child, and in the evening of the fifth day, a grindstone is set in the mother\u2019s room with a lighted lamp beside it. Then the rolling-pin is set upright leaning against the wall, and on the grindstone are arranged the knife with which the navel-cord was cut, dough lamps, thirty-two kinds of healing herbs, an image of Satv\u00e1i, a sheet of blank paper, a pen and an ink pot, and over the whole a woman of the house sprinkles turmeric and red and scented powders, burns camphor and incense, and offers them rice flour balls and betel. The mother, sitting in front of these articles, bows before them, and prays them to be kindly to her child. Near kinspeople and friends are asked to dine, when the chief dish is wheat flour cakes or mutk\u00eds boiled in split pulse. The guests retire with a present of betel, and, during her confinement, to strengthen her gums, after her meals, the mother is given betelnut soaked in marking-nut oil and pieces of dry cocoa-kernel. During the night the women stay awake, singing, talking, and playing. Next morning the worship of the goddess Satv\u00e1i is repeated with the same details, and, except the image of Satv\u00e1i, the whole is thrown into water. They hold the mother unclean for ten days, and on the morning of the tenth cowdung the whole house and wash the cot, the bedding, and the mother\u2019s clothes. On the eleventh the child and the mother are bathed, cow\u2019s urine is sprinkled over the house and sipped by all the inmates, and the men change their sacred threads. On the morning of the twelfth the mother worships five pebbles\noutside of the house, and names the child if a girl on that day and if a boy on the following day. When it is between three months and two years old the child is laid on its maternal uncle's lap, its hair is clipped for the first time, and it is taken to the village temple to bow to M\u0101ruti. They gird their boys with the sacred thread when they are between seven and nine. From a week to a month before the day fixed for the thread-girding near friends and relations are told, and during the interval by turns feast the boy's parents. Drummers and pipers are sent for, the terms on which they will play at the thread-girding are settled, a booth is built, and cards are sent to distant kinspeople and friends. To ask the people of the caste, the boy's parents and their kinspeople and friends start with music. Before they start they lay a cocoanut in front of the house gods and ask them to attend the ceremony; they then ask the village god, and then their relations and friends. A feast called the Br\u0101hmans' feast or Br\u0101hmanbhojan is held when kinsfolk and castefellows are asked to dine. In the booth an earthen altar is raised seven lengths of the boy's right foot and about eight inches high. In front is a step and behind rises the wall above the altar. On the right side of the altar are arranged two and on the left three piles of earthen pots each pile of five pots, the upper ones being smaller than those below. Each contains a few grains of coloured rice and a piece of turmeric. A carpet is spread in the booth and round it is traced a line of wheat within which the boy sits, to his right his mother and to her right his father. Five married women come out of the house, each rubs the brow of the father, mother, and son with redpowder, and waves a betelnut and a lighted lamp round their heads. They then anoint the three with fragrant oil, and seating them on low wooden stools in the same order in which they sat in the wheat square, place five earthen jars round them and pass a cotton thread round the jars. While musicians play, the three bathe in warm water, dress in silk, and take their seats on three wooden stools as before. The family priest lays a betelnut before them in honour of Ganpati, the three lay before the Ganpati betelnut, sandal, red and scented powder, flowers, and grains of rice, wave a lighted lamp, camphor, and frankincense before him, and offer him sugar. In this manner they worship Mother Earth or bhumi and the water-pot or kalash. The father takes a winnowing fan, spreads a bodicecloth over it, and arranges twenty-seven betelnuts on it. He makes six rolls of mango leaves in which he puts the j\u0101mbhul and shami leaves and ties the roll with thread. He lays them in the winnowing fan alongside of the betelnuts, takes a whitewashed and red-lined earthen jar, fills it with wheat, lays a cocoanut over its mouth, winds cotton thread over the whole of it, offers it sandalpaste vermilion rice and flowers, and lays it in the winnowing fan. He calls it the Vighnan\u0101sh or evil-killer. All this time the mother and child sit quiet doing nothing. The mother takes the earthen jar into both her hands and the father takes the winnowing fan, and they walk into the house. The father throws a few grains of rice over the house gods and a few more in front of them. On the grains in front of the gods, he lays the winnowing fan and the mother sets the jar in the fan as before. They make\na low bow and go into the booth. Then the father hangs bunches of mango leaves round the booth, and performs the N\u00e1ndishr\u00e1ddh that is festive ancestral worship or peace offering by repeating the names of his three immediate ancestors. The family barber is called and the priest takes a razor from him, sprinkles water over it, and keeps it near him. The priests rubs curds over the boy\u2019s head and sticks small balls of butter behind the boy\u2019s two ears, at the back and on the crown of his head, and over his brow. He holds a blade of the sacred grass over the boy\u2019s head and cuts it in two with a razor. He gives the razor back to the barber and tells him to shave the boy\u2019s head leaving the hair on the spots marked with butter. The boy is anointed with fragrant oil and bathed. He dines from the same plate with his mother in company with five married women and five bachelors who have been girded with the sacred thread. When dinner is over the boy is taken back to the barber, who shaves four of the five locks, and leaves the fifth on the crown of the head. The boy is again bathed, and dry sandal paste is rubbed all over his brow, and grains of rice are stuck on the brow-sandal. He stands on a low wooden stool in front of the altar, and his maternal uncle stands behind him supporting him. His father sits on a low wooden stool on the altar, and near relations hold a cloth between the boy and his father. The maternal uncle puts a little sugar into the boy\u2019s mouth, and the priest, along with some of the guests, repeat the lucky verses or mangal\u00e1stak\u1e63. After the verses are over grains of red rice are thrown over the boy\u2019s head by the guests and the cloth is pulled on one side. The priest ties a piece of cotton thread and a piece of silk round his loins. He hangs a bit of gold and deer\u2019s skin to a string of sixteen strands and puts it across the boy\u2019s shoulders. The boy is seated on a low wooden stool and the priest sits on another stool near him and covering himself and the boy with a shawl whispers into his ears the sacred sun-hymn or g\u00e1yatri and makes him repeat it after him until he has learnt it by heart. The boy next sits on the altar on a low wooden stool, kindles the sacrificial fire, and feeds it with eighteen pieces of pimpal and butter. The boy is given a pimpal staff in his hands, his father covers him with a shawl, seats him on his hip, and takes him to the village M\u00e1ruti before whom the boy lays a copper coin and makes a low bow. On his return the boy is seated in front of the fire and feeds it with sixteen handfuls of cooked rice and butter. The boy stands with a bag and begs for alms. His kinspeople and friends present him with sugar cakes and dry cocca-kernel or cocoanuts. Then they dine. In the afternoon women go with a variety of dishes to the village temple accompanied by musicians, leave a little of each dish before the god, and go home. In the evening the sacrificial fire is kindled and fed into a blaze with a couple of cups full of clarified butter. The priest teaches the boy the evening prayer, and after the prayers are over, the mother presents the boy with a rich conical cap with two ear flaps, a coat, and a waistcloth. After this the mother and the other women take a ladle, wind a black glass bead necklace round its handle, fill it with a gram ball, and empty the ball into the boy\u2019s bag. Next morning the boy bathes and the priest teaches him his prayers.\nThe sacrificial fire is rekindled and fed with butter, dry dates, and a twisted cord of the sacred darbh grass. The priest makes four clay cakes and arranges them in a pile one on the other, and, on the top of them, plants a branch of the palas tree Butea frondosa. The boy and his parents sit in front of the branch, and offer it a betelnut and leaves and a copper coin. Then the boy followed by his father, and the father by the boy\u2019s mother go round the branch. At the end of the first round the boy sprinkles turmeric water over the branch, at the end of the second round the father throws a few grains of red rice over it, and at the end of the third the mother throws gram pulse over it. Then the three go to the god Vighn\u00e1n\u00e1sh or evil-killer and throw a few grains of red rice over him. The mother takes the earthen jar in both her hands, and the father the winnowing fan, go into the booth, and set them on the ground as before. The jar and the winnowing fan are worshipped with flowers and sandal, and they, that is the guardian spirits in them, are asked to depart. The priest carries the fan and its contents to his own house, and the day\u2019s proceedings end with a feast.\n\nWithin sixteen days after the thread-girding, though it is sometimes put off till the boy is ten or twelve years old, comes the sam\u00e1vartan or pupil\u2019s return. Till that time the boy continues to wear the piece of deer\u2019s skin and the grass waistcord. If before the return ceremony comes off, the grass cord gets snapped, it is taken off and carefully kept until the return ceremony is performed. On the morning of a lucky day the boy\u2019s head is shaved except the topknot, his body is anointed, and he is bathed. The boy\u2019s parents bathe and dress in silk, and, along with the boy and with the help of the priest, perform the preliminary ceremonies of Punyahav\u00f3chan or holiday calling, Ganpatipujan or Ganpati worship, and M\u00e1trik\u00e1pujan or the worship of the divine mothers. No N\u00e1ndishr\u00e1ddh or festive ancestral worship is performed, neither do they bring into use the earthen water jar or the winnowing fan, but arrange the twenty-seven betelnuts on a piece of cloth. The sacrificial fire is kindled, and, while the priest is chanting verses, the boy throws over the fire two dry dates, sixteen pimpal Ficus religiosa sticks, and clarified butter. The boy is dressed in a new waistcloth, coat, shoulder-cloth, turban, and shoes. A staff and an umbrella are put in his hands, as well as bundles of half a pound of rice, wheat flour, pulse, salt, chillies, and spices. Thus supplied the boy asks his parents for leave to go on pilgrimage to the river Ganges. He starts, and after walking a few paces is stopped by his maternal uncle who asks whither and why he is going. The boy answers he is going on a journey to the holy Ganges. The uncle persuades him to give up his journey, and come back and live among them, and he will give him his daughter in marriage. The boy agrees and coming back makes over the provisions to the priest, and the ceremony ends with a feast.\n\nA girl is married between eight and twelve and a boy between twelve and twenty-five. The boy\u2019s father has to look out for a wife for his son. When he has found a girl, he calls a few of his and of the girl\u2019s near kinsfolk, and tells them that the girl\u2019s father has promised to give his daughter in marriage to his son. Betel is\nserved and the guests retire. The fathers give a dinner and a return dinner and exchange turbans. After a few days the girl's father asks his own and the boy's relations to his house, as well as the family priests of both houses and fixes the marriage day. A few days before the marriage their near kinsfolk feast the boy and girl by turns at their houses. Musicians are called and the terms on which they will play are settled. Invitation cards are sent to distant kinsfolk and friends, and, to ask close relations and friends, the men and women of the boy's house start with music. Before starting they ask the house gods to be present at the wedding and to let the lucky matter they have in hand come to a prosperous end. They go to the village god, and from the god to relations, friends, and castefellows. Next day some of the girl's relations go with music to the boy's, and the girl's mother washes the boy's feet, and the girl's father wipes them dry, marks his brow with sandal, and sticks grains of rice on the sandal. He puts a new turban on the boy's head and a sash over his shoulder, tucks a bunch of flowers in his turban, and ties a chaplet of flowers round it. He lays curds on the boy's right palm which the boy sips, puts a nosegay into the boy's hand, and retires to his house with his party. The boy is seated on horseback, and with kinsfolk and music goes to the village temple. At the temple he is met by the girl's party, and the girl's father rubs his brow with sandal, presents him with a new turban and shouldercloth, and puts a flower garland round his neck and a nosegay into his hands. The girl's mother approaches the boy, washes his feet, and, after wiping them dry, gives him sugared milk to drink, and the parties return to their houses. This is called the boundary worship or shevantipujan, properly simantipujan. On the marriage day the girl's kinswomen, with cooked dishes, go to the boy's house, serve the food to the boy and his kinswomen, and go home. A square earthen altar is raised at the girl's house nine lengths of the girl's left foot and about eight to nine inches high, whitewashed, and five piles of earthen jars are set round it. The boy's kinswomen go to the girl's with music and a tray containing a green robe, a bodice, and glass bangles. They seat the girl on a low wooden stool, anoint her with oil and turmeric, dress her in the new robe and bodice, and put glass bangles round her wrists. The girl's kinswomen accompanied by the boy's go to the boy's house with the rest of the oil and turmeric and rub it on the boy, bathe him, and return home. The boy's kinspeople taking trays of clothes, ornaments, fruit, rice, and betel go to the girl's house, one of the men worships Ganpati and Varun, and, seating the girl before him on a low wooden stool, rubs her brow with redpowder, on the powder sticks grains of rice, and presents her with a robe and bodice, which she puts on in the women's room, comes out, and takes her former seat. The boy's father decks her with ornaments and fills her lap with rice, almonds, betel, dry cocoa-kernel, dates, turmeric, and plantains, and returns home. This is called vaknischaya that is troth-plighting, and after this the girl is supposed to be half married to the boy. A party of friends and relations start from the girl's house with a richly trapped horse and followed by the girl's sister richly dressed, with a lighted dough-lamp in her hands.\nwith blackened wicks. Behind her walk the guests and servants with plates filled with garlands and nosegays and a jar of sugared milk mixed with wheat. At the boy\u2019s the bridegroom\u2019s brow is touched with redpowder, garlands are thrown round his neck, a nosegay is put in his hands, and sugared milk is offered him. He is seated on a horse, his sister walks behind him with a burning dough-lamp in her hands, the same as the lamp which was carried by the girl\u2019s sister, and his kinspeople follow him. At the door of the girl\u2019s booth, some one from the girl\u2019s house waves cooked rice and curds round the boy\u2019s head and throws it to his right and left. He alights from the horse and takes his seat on a low wooden stool in the booth.\n\nThe girl\u2019s father offers him water to wash his feet, and, after he has washed them, he is presented with a new silk waistcloth which he puts on and covers his shoulders with a shawl. The girl comes out of the house, stands on a stool facing the boy, and near relations hold a sheet between them. The priest and a few of the guests repeat marriage verses, and, at the end of each verse, throw grains of red rice over the heads of the boy and girl. When the verses are over, the curtain is pulled on one side, and the boy and girl change places and take their seats on the stools. The girl\u2019s father pours on the boy\u2019s open palm milk, curds, butter, sugar, and honey, and he sips them thrice. This ceremony which is called the honey-sipping or madhupark is performed either before or after the marriage. The priest gives the boy a sacred thread and he wears it along with his old one. He then clasps both the girl\u2019s hands in his and four married men sit round them with outstretched hands. The priest takes a cotton thread, winds it round the couple\u2019s thumbs and from their thumbs winds it round the thumbs of the four men. In this way he makes two sets of circuits, one of five turns and the other of four, and draws off the two sets of thread and keeps them by him. The boy lets go the girl\u2019s hands, and she holds her open hands over the boy\u2019s, and the priest keeps a metal dish below the boy\u2019s hands. The girl\u2019s father pours water over the girl\u2019s hands, and it trickles down on the boy\u2019s and from the boy\u2019s into the dish. He drops some silver coins into the girl\u2019s hands which she lets pass into the boy\u2019s hands, and he into the dish. Water is again poured into the girl\u2019s hands and the ceremony of giving away the girl or kany\u0101dan is over. The priest takes the two circlets of thread he kept near himself, and tying a piece of turmeric root to each of the threads, fastens the one of five strands round the boy\u2019s right twist, and the one of four strands to the girl\u2019s left wrist. This is called the wristlet tying or kankanbandhan. The boy\u2019s father presents the girl with a pair of toe-rings which she puts on her toes, and a married woman ties a necklace of black glass beads round the girl\u2019s neck. The boy and girl take their seats on the altar, and, with the priest\u2019s help, kindle the sacrificial fire, feeding it with pimpal Ficus religiosa sticks and clarified butter. The girl\u2019s brother stands behind his sister and she throws handfuls of parched grain into the fire. In reward for standing behind his sister, her brother is presented with a turban by the boy\u2019s father, which he puts on. The hems of the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s robes are knotted together, and the pair go into the house and\nmake a low bow before the house gods. They then go into a room on the wall of which a mango tree is drawn, and, below the tree on the ground, are spread grains of wheat and on the wheat sixteen earthen jars in four piles. In front of the jars is spread a bodice-cloth, and on it are laid rice grains, dry cocoa-kernel, turmeric, almonds, and betelnuts, and the boy and girl sit in front and make a low bow. The girl's mother hands the boy a cup of sugared milk which he drinks, leaving some for the girl. The boy and girl leave their seats and go and sit on the altar, and the hems of their garments are untied. The girl walks into the house and joins the women, and the boy sits in the booth with the men. The day ends with a feast. Next morning the girl and boy play together rubbing each other with turmeric and throwing water over each other. In the afternoon the boy's kinsfolk and friends are dined. On the third morning the boy and girl splash one another with water, bathe, dress in silk clothes, and sit on the altar. The priest comes and with his help the boy kindles the sacrificial fire and feeds it with butter and darbh grass. The pair leave their seats and sit in the booth on stools the girl to the boy's left. In front of them two whitewashed red-lined earthen jars are set on wheat grains one above the other, the upper closed with a shallow plate or lid. In the first or lower jar is water, in the upper jar rice, and in the plate, pulse, a wafer biscuit, and wheat bread, and over the whole a dough lamp. Round this pile are arranged four small earthen jars with wheat grains spread underneath them. The jars are whitewashed and red-lined and covered with wafer biscuits, wheat cakes, and dough lamps. In a winnowing fan are arranged sixteen small dough lamps set on biscuits and cakes. In front of the boy and girl, on the other side of the jars, sit the girl's parents dressed in silk. The boy and girl lay sandal paste, rice grains, vermilion, turmeric, and betel leaves with nuts and a copper before the jars and light the dough lamps including the sixteen in the fan. The girl is seated on the boy's knee and her father lifting the winnowing fan in both his hands, holds it over the boy's head, and the priest hands the boy a pinch of sugar which he puts into the girl's mouth. The girl's father holds the fan over the boy's father's head and seating the girl on his knee, the boy's father puts a pinch of sugar into her mouth. In this way the girl is seated on the knee of each of the kinsfolk both of the boy and of the girl, and the winnowing fan is held over their heads. The girl's father presents the boy with a turban and shouldercloth and the boy's father presents the girl with a green robe and bodice. The hems of the boy's and girl's robes are tied together, and they are seated on a mare and taken in procession to the village temple, and from the temple to the boy's house. In a room at the boy's a dough image of the goddess Lakshmi is made and set on a water drinking pot or t\u00e1mbya turned upside down. This pot is placed on a big metal waterpot or tapele, turned upside down like the drinking pot, and the goddess is rolled in a robe whose folds cover the two pots. Ornaments are put on the goddess' neck head and ears, and three heaps of rice are made in front of the goddess. In the middle heap the priest hides a gold ornament, and seats the boy and girl in front of the heaps on two low wooden stools. The priest sits\nnear the boy, takes a plate full of rice, writes in the rice the name to be given to the girl, and asks the boy to read it, which he does in a loud voice. The girl is told to repeat the boy's name, and, after much hesitation and persuasion, she agrees. The priest asks the girl to find what is in the middle heap of rice and keep it as a present from her husband. She searches, finds the gold necklace, and puts it on. The priest hands the guests sugar in token of the new name given to the girl, unties the boy's and girl's wristlets or kankans, throws a few grains of rice over the earthen jars and the marriage gods, and the guests retire with presents of sugar and betel. Exchange feasts are given and after three or four days spent at the boy's, the girl returns to her father's and the marriage rites are at an end.\n\nWhen a girl comes of age, word is sent to her husband's house, who send a band of kinswomen, who take the girl either on foot or in a carriage with music to her husband's. If the girl happens to be at her husband's when she comes of age, she is sent quietly to her parents if their house is in the same village or to some neighbour's and brought back in pomp to the husband's with a party of kinswomen and music. Before starting for the husband's, her parents present her with a new robe and bodice which she puts on, deck her head with a net or j\u0101li of flowers, and rub red-powder on her brow and turmeric on her face and arms. A sandalwood doll rubbed with red and turmeric is put in her hands. At her husband's a bamboo frame or mokhar is raised, surrounded with a twisted turban, or hung with glass bangles. The wife is seated in the frame, red and turmeric powders are given her and the guests, and they retire. For three days the girl is considered impure. On the fourth morning she is bathed and her mother presents her with a new robe and bodice. She is seated in the frame along with her husband, and her mother-in-law fills her lap with rice fruit and betel, and her husband puts a cocoanut into her lap. The girl's mother next fills her lap with rice and fruit, and the wife and husband bow before the house gods, go to the village temple, bow before M\u0101ruti, and come home. On the fifth morning, or on any other lucky day within sixteen days from the coming of age, the husband and wife are bathed, and, sitting on two low wooden stools, with the help of the family priest worship the gods Ganpati, Varun, and Navagrahas or the nine planets. A sacrificial fire is kindled and fed with cooked rice, butter, sesamum, wheat, and bits of palas Butea frondosa, \u0101mba Mangifera indica, khair Acacia catechu, aghd\u0101 Achyranthes aspera, jambul Syzgium jambolanum, and umbar Ficus glomerata. The husband lays cooked rice on a leaf plate, covers it with wheat bread, sprinkles redpowder over it, and sets on the top of it a dough lamp with a thick cotton wick soaked in oil and lighted. A R\u0101ul brings a trident which the husband sticks in the cooked rice, lays flowers and grain in front of the trident, and places some money near it. The R\u0101ul lifts the whole in his two hands and going outside sets it at the roadside and walks away with his trident. The husband and wife walk after the R\u0101ul, as far as the outer door, sprinkling water after him. On coming back they wash their hands and feet and walk into the house. They are anointed\nwith oil, bathed, dressed in silk and seated side by side on low wooden stools. They again throw rice at and bow before a betelnut Ganpati, are taken in procession accompanied by kinspeople friends and music to the village temple, bow to M\u00e1ruti, and return home. A feast is held at which the wife serves butter to at least five guests. In the evening the husband and wife are thrust into a room prepared for them and the ceremony is over. In the seventh month of the wife\u2019s first pregnancy a feast is given to kinswomen and female friends and her mother-in-law presents her with a new robe and bodice.\n\nP\u00e1nch\u00e1ls burn their dead. The dying is laid on a blanket strewn with darbh grass. After death a couple of kinsmen or friends go to the market and bring what is wanted for the funeral. When they come back they busy themselves making the body ready, and when it is ready they take it out of the house, wash it, and lay it on the bier. The bier is raised on the shoulders of four kinsmen and carried out feet foremost. The chief mourner walks carrying an earthen jar containing burning cowdung cakes. When the mourners have gone half way, the bier is lowered, a couple of copper coins are laid on the ground, the bier is raised, and carried to the burning ground. At the burning ground a pile of cowdung cakes is raised, the chief mourner has his head and face shaved by a barber, bathes, and, after the body is laid on the pile, sets fire to it. He next fills with water the jar in which he carried the burning cowdung cakes and picking a pebble called the ashma or lifestone, makes a hole in the jar and thrice walks round the pyre. At the end of the third turn he dashes the pot on the ground and beats his mouth. Along with other mourners he bathes, and carrying the lifestone home with him, keeps it in some safe place rolled in cloth. The mourners on coming to the deceased\u2019s house, look at the burning lamp which has been set on the spot where the dead breathed his last, and return home. From the second to the ninth day, with the priest, the chief mourner goes to the burning ground, makes three balls of rice, offers them to the stone of life, and throws them into water. On the third day in addition the chief mourner sprinkles curds, milk, and cow\u2019s urine on the ashes, removes them, and throws it into water. He makes a mound of sand on the spot where the body was burnt, sets three small earthen jars on the mound, and fills their mouths with rice balls. He lays the pebble close by on the mound, offers it the balls, and then gathers the balls, throws them into water, and returns home with the lifestone. They mourn the dead ten days. On the tenth morning the chief mourner goes once more with the priest to the burning ground, makes six balls of rice and sets five of them on five earthen jars, and the sixth in the middle of the mound. Near the balls he lays the lifestone, offers it sesamum seed and water, and leaving the sixth ball for the crows, throws the five into water, and returns home with the pebble. On the eleventh day he kindles the sacrificial fire, drinks the five cow gifts, offers thirty-two balls of rice, bathes, and returns home. A dough cow and calf are made and presented to the Br\u00e1hman, and, after making him a money present, the cow and calf are thrown into water, and they go home. On the twelfth day the chief mourner cooks several dishes of rice and vegetables, offers them to the spirit\nof the dead, feasts at least five men, and returns home. On the thirteenth the mind-rite or shr\u00e1ddh ceremony is performed, and on the fourteenth a caste feast is held and the mourning is over. P\u00e1nch\u00e1s have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school for a short time and are fairly off.\n\nPa'tharvats, or Masons, are returned as numbering 410 and as found over the whole district. They look like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, speak Mar\u00e1thi, live in mud and stone houses, and eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. Both men and women dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and are hardworking even-tempered and hospitable. They make stone pillars, handmills, grindstones, rolling-pins, and images of gods, and also work as stone masons and carriers. They worship the usual Hindu gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and feasts. Their priests are the ordinary Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, and their customs are the same as those of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They marry their widows and burn their dead. They have a caste council, send their boys to school, and are a steady class.\n\nPatvekars, or Tassel Makers, are returned as numbering seven and as found in the town of Shol\u00e1pur.

They say they were originally Kshatris, and that their ancestors who were twin brothers, on being pursued by Parashur\u00e1m, hid in a temple belonging to the goddess Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i and sought the goddess' protection. The goddess gave one brother a piece of thread and a needle, and the other a paint which she spat at him and told the one to sew and the other to dye. Meanwhile Parashur\u00e1m begged the goddess to make over to him the two Kshatris, but she denied all knowledge of them, and Parashur\u00e1m had to go back disappointed. From that time the sewer became a Shimpi and the dyer a Rang\u00e1ri.

The pots which they use in making dyes are satkal a circular copper water vessel, baguna a metal vessel for boiling colour, and jh\u00e1n\u00edji a square high legged wooden stand with thick cloth tied on the top in which colour is poured, and through which it drops into a vessel. If the Rang\u00e1ri is poor these vessels are of earth. Earth vessels cost 8s. to 10s. (Rs. 4-5) and metal vessels \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 25-30). If they are told to give a turban a 4s.

On the twelfth morning the mother lays five pebbles by the roadside in front of the house and worships them, throws red and yellow powder over them, burns incense and camphor before them, and offers them cooked food and betel. A feast is held to which only near kinswomen are asked. In the evening the child is named with the usual ceremonies and the image of Satvai is tied round its neck with a silk thread. They clip the child's hair, whether it is a boy or a girl, between one and three years of age. The child is seated on the left knee of its maternal uncle who clips a lock of its hair and the rest is cut by the family barber. They gird their boys with the sacred thread between five and eleven and marry their girls between eight and twelve and their boys between twelve and twenty-five. Their thread-girding and marriage ceremonies are generally the same as those of Maratha Brahmans. A girl is considered impure for fifteen days after coming of age, and, on the morning of the sixteenth, is bathed and becomes pure. In the afternoon the husband and wife, helped by the family priest, light the sacrificial fire and feed it with cooked rice. The rest is laid on a leaf plate, sprinkled with redpowder, and a dough lamp is kept on the top of it. The husband carries the plate outside of the house and it is laid in the street in front of the house, and the wife follows sprinkling water after him. The plate is left at a street corner, and, after washing their hands and feet, the husband and wife walk in, and take their seats before the sacred fire. They are presented with clothes the husband with turbans and waistcloths and the wife with robes and bodices. A feast ends the day. They burn their dead, hold caste councils, send their boys to school for a short time, and are well-to-do.\n\nTambolis, or Betel-Sellers, are returned as numbering eight, and as found in the town of Sholapur. In appearance, speech, house, food, and dress they do not differ from cultivating Marathas. They grow betel leaves, and sell them retail and their women help in their calling. They are shopkeepers, selling betelnut, catechu, and lime which people chew along with the betel leaves. They open their shops at six in the morning and shut them about eight at night. Their boys help from twelve or fifteen. They sell the leaves from twenty to thirty-two for \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{d.} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\text{a.} \\) and make \\( 3\\text{d.} \\) to \\( 4\\frac{1}{2}\\text{d.} \\) (2-3 as.) a day, and, as they can hardly live on this, they cultivate and serve as labourers. When asked they say they are Kunbis rather than Tambolis. They worship all Hindu gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and festivals. They allow and practise child and widow marriage and polygamy, and their customs social and religious are the same as Maratha customs. They burn their dead and mourn ten days. They have a caste council. They do not send their boys to school and at present are poor.\nTelis, or Oil-Pressers, are returned as numbering 6750 and as found all over the district. They are divided into L\u00e1ds, Lingd\u00e1s or Ling\u00e1yats, Mirjis, Pardeshis, and Tuljapuris, who neither eat together nor intermarry. The Tuljapuris look like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi. Their houses are like those of ordinary middle class Hindus, with a front verandah which serves as a shop. They have a bullock or two and sometimes a servant. They do not eat fish or flesh. Both men and women dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the women without drawing the end of the robe back between the feet. They are proverbially dirty but hard-working and thrifty. They press sesamum seed, kardai seed, and groundnuts, and their women and children help the men in their work. They sell the oil in their houses and have shops, but do not hawk the oil. They worship the ordinary Hindu gods, and their house deities are Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i, Jotiba, and Khandoba. Their priests are the ordinary village Br\u00e1hmans and Lingd\u00e1s in addition employ Jangams. Except that the Lingda women after childbirth become impure for five days and tie a ling to the child\u2019s neck on the fifth, their ceremonies are the same as Mar\u00e1tha ceremonies. Besides the ling ceremony the Lingd\u00e1s worship Satv\u00e1i on the fifth day like other Telis and name their children on the twelfth. Except that their dev\u00e1k or guardian is the iron bar or pah\u00e1r and the stone oil-mill or gh\u00e1na, their customs are the same as those of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The marriage priests of all Telis are the ordinary village Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. The Lingd\u00e1s carry their dead in a bag or jholi behind a Jangam who blows a conch shell. The Telis bury their dead, mourn three days, and offer no balls. They allow widow marriage and practise polygamy. Their headman or mhetar settles social disputes in presence of the council or panch. They do not send their boys to school. Though the competition of kerosine oil has lowered the price of the local oil the Telis\u2019 oil commands a good sale and as a class they are well-to-do.\n\nServants include two castes with a strength of 10,254 or 1\u00b79 per cent of the Hindu population. Of these 6169 (males 4179, females 2990) were Nh\u00e1vis and 4085 (males 2041, females 2044) were Parits.\n\nNh\u00e1vis or Barbers, also called Variks or Time-keepers, are returned as numbering 6169 and as found all over the district. They are divided into Mar\u00e1tha, Telangi, Ling\u00e1yat, Pardeshi, M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, and Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed Nh\u00e1vis. The following particulars apply to Mar\u00e1tha Nh\u00e1vis only, who are divided into Konkanis and Deccanis who eat together but do not intermarry. Their houses are the same as Mar\u00e1tha houses. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. They dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the men wearing a waistcloth, coat, jacket, turban or headscarf, and shoes; and the women the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. They are a quiet orderly and obliging people, and amuse their patrons with talk and gossip and sometimes with a song. They are barbers, hold umbrellas over the bride and bridegroom at weddings, play the sanai or pipe and the drums called samel and chaughada, and sing excellent songs. They also bleed and apply leeches, and their women act as midwives. They are husbandmen, messengers, and torch-bearers, and are very\npopular servants. Their customs are the same as Mar\u00e1tha customs. They worship the goddess Satv\u00e1i on the fifth day after childbirth, cradle and name the child on the twelfth, and marry their girls between ten and fourteen and their boys between fifteen and twenty. The marriage ceremony lasts four days. They allow widow marriage, practise polygamy, worship the ordinary Hindu gods and goddesses, keep the regular fasts and feasts, and employ the local Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans as their priests. They settle social disputes at caste meetings. They give their boys a little schooling and are a steady people.\n\nParits, or Washermen, are returned as numbering 4085 and as found in small numbers all over the district. They have no memory of any former home and are divided into Ling\u00e1yats, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Telangis, who neither eat together nor intermarry. The following details apply chiefly to Mar\u00e1tha Parits. Their personal names and surnames are the same as those of Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis and they do not differ from local Kunbis in look, speech, house, dress, or character. Parits generally wear articles of dress which have been sent them to be washed, as the proverb says, The king\u2019s headscarf is the washerman\u2019s loincloth. They are hereditary washermen, and some of them are landholders and labourers. When they get clothes to wash, Parits examine them closely and mark them with the marking-nut or biba, the marks being generally dots and lines, not letters, as few Parits can read. Thus they can arrange any number of clothes and show remarkable keenness and memory in picking different clothes from the heap and returning them to their owners. They are paid either in cash or in grain, or in cooked food which is their favourite form of payment. In washing their clothes they use s\u00e1ban or soap, p\u00e1pad kh\u00e1r or carbonate of potash and soda, nil or indigo, and k\u00e1nji or rice starch. Their appliances are metal washing basins called satele or gindi, the istari or iron, and the mogra or wooden mallet. Parits are helped by their women and children in collecting clothes, drying them, and returning them to their owners. Parits rise early, take the clothes to the nearest river or running brook, and wash and dry them in the sun. They go home, soak the clothes in soap water, boil them, and again wash them in the river. This they do twice or thrice and dry them, fold and beat them with the mallet or mogra or iron them, and the clothes are ready. Parits belong to the class of baluted\u00e1rs or village servants but many of them are poorly paid. They rank very low in the social scale almost next above the impure classes. Their social and religious customs are the same as those of local Kunbis. Early marriage, polygamy, and widow marriage are allowed and practised and polyandry is unknown. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. A few send their boys to school but their calling is poorly paid and they are badly off.\n\nMusicians include three castes with a strength of 7519 or 1\u00b72 per cent of the Hindu population. Of these 254 (males 121, females 133) were Ghadshis; 3583 (males 1803, females 1870) Guravs, and 3682 (males 1837, females 1845) Hol\u00e1rs.\n\n---\n\n1 The Mar\u00e1thi runs: R\u00e1j\u00e1che shiri, Parit\u00e1chi tiri.\nGhadshis, or Musicians, are returned as numbering 254 and as found in towns and large villages. They are a dark people and look like cultivating Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They speak and dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and have the same customs. They are musicians songsters and beggars. They act the part of Bh\u00e1ts and Bahurupis, and imitate half-naked Gos\u00e1vis and Bain\u00e1gis. If they hear of the arrival of a well-to-do person, they dress in a big newly coloured turban with its gold ends dangling by their sides, a silk-bordered shouldercloth, a broadcloth or fresh-washed cotton coat, and a coloured waistcoat, waistcloth, and shoes, and demand the present of a shawl or of a new turban. They refuse copper or small silver coins saying they have abundance of silver in their houses and, if the stranger likes, will send him some cartloads full. They stand for hours talking and demanding a present, and will not leave till they get a turban or a shawl, or at least a coat or waistcoat. They send their boys to school, have a caste council, and are a falling people.\n\nGuravs, or Priests, are returned as numbering 3583 and as found in small numbers all over the district. They are divided into Kh\u00e1tavni and Nakh\u00e1tavni, who neither eat together nor intermarry. They speak Mar\u00e1thi, live in ordinary flat roofed houses or in thatched huts, have metal and earthen vessels, and keep cattle and ponies. They neither eat fish or flesh, nor drink liquor, and their staple food is jv\u00e1ri, pulse, and vegetables. Their feasts of pulse cakes cost them \u00a31 10s. (Rs.15) the hundred guests. They are clean in their habits, hardworking, even-tempered, and hospitable. They serve at the shrines of the village gods and live on the village offerings of food and grain. They make leaf cups and plates and are excellent musicians. The men dress in a waistcloth, coat, and turban, and the women in the ordinary Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. They wear the sacred thread, and their chief gods are Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i, Khandoba, Mah\u00e1dev, and M\u00e1ruti. Their priests are ordinary Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, whom they show great respect. Their women are impure for ten days after childbirth. They worship the goddess Satv\u00e1\u00ed on the fifth day and name the child on the twelfth. They shave the child's head for the first time when it is two months old, and, at the age of nine, gird their boys with the sacred thread. Their guardian or devak is the leaves of the vad or banyan tree which they tie to a post of the marriage hall and worship. The boy and girl are married standing face to face and a cloth is held between them. When the Br\u00e1hman priest has finished the marriage verses, and the guests have thrown rice over their heads, they are husband and wife. Feasts are exchanged on both sides, and the boy walks with his bride to his village. They burn their dead, dressing the body in a green robe and bodice if the deceased is a married woman. Their social disputes are settled by their headman without calling a caste meeting. They do not send their boys to school and are a poor people.\n\nHola'rs apparently meaning Field Men or Sons of the Soil, are returned as numbering 3682 and as found over the whole district. They are divided into \u00c1yavle, Birlinge, G\u00e1rode, Gijge,\nGulik, J\u00e1vir, Kamele, Karde, H\u00e1lm\u00e1ne, Namd\u00e1se, P\u00e1rsha, and V\u00e1g\u00e1r, who all eat together but do not intermarry. They are like M\u00e1ngs, dark tall and strong, and like them the men wear the top-knot and moustache but not the beard. They speak Mar\u00e1thi both at home and abroad and live in straw huts with thatched roofs, and use earthen pots and pans. They have no servants, but some keep cattle and goats. In food and dress they are the same as M\u00e1ngs, and are hardworking, dirty, and, when they can afford it, drunken. They are shoe and sandal makers, leather dressers, tillers, musicians, and day labourers. The women help the men in their work and the children herd cattle. They keep no birthday ceremony, and their women remain impure for twelve days. They worship a grindstone on the fifth in honour of the goddess Satv\u00e1i whom they greatly fear, and name the child on the twelfth the name being given by the village Br\u00e1hman who is told the day and the hour when the child was born. They clip the child\u2019s hair if it is a boy between its second and its seventh or eighth years. Betrothal takes place before marriage, and they generally marry their girls between five and fifteen and their boys between twelve and twenty. They have a great fondness for child marriage but their poverty often prevents them satisfying their and their women\u2019s wishes. They allow widow marriage, but the ceremony is always held in dark nights, and no one will look at the newly married couple\u2019s face till the sun has been up four or five hours. They bury their dead, but say they would burn them if they could afford it. In religion they are the same as M\u00e1ngs, worshipping all Hindu gods and goddesses, especially Bahiroba, Damr\u00e1i, Jan\u00e1i, Jokh\u00e1i, Khandoba, and Satv\u00e1i. Their priests are the ordinary village Br\u00e1hmans whom they greatly respect. They have a caste council and their social disputes are settled at caste meetings. They do not send their boys to school and are a poor class.\n\nShepherds include two castes with a strength of 59,385, or 11\u00b704 per cent of the Hindu population. Of these 57,704 (males 29,038, females 28,666) were Dhangars and 1681 (males 871, females 810) were Gavlis.\n\nDhangars, or Shepherds literally Cowkeepers, are returned as numbering 57,704 and as found over the whole district. They are said to have come to Shol\u00e1pur during the great Durg\u00e1devi famine (1396-1408) from the valley of the M\u00e1n river in north-east S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They are divided into Barges or Bandes, Hatgars, and Khutegars or Khutes, who neither eat together nor intermarry. The chief Dhangar surnames are Bh\u00e1ge, Chendke, Duble, G\u00e1d\u00e9kar, Kore, Murle, and R\u00e1yur\u00e1l. They are dark, large, and well-featured. The men wear the top-knot and the moustache. Their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi. They live in houses of mud and stones with flat roofs, and their house furniture includes brass copper and earthen vessels worth about \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25). They eat the flesh of goats and sheep and fowls and drink liquor. Their staple food is je\u00e1r\u00ed, pulse, and vegetables, milk, curds, and buttermilk. The men dress in a loincloth, a turban, a jacket and a waistcloth or short trousers reaching to the knee.\nThey throw a blanket over the head and let it hang down the back to the knee. The women wear a robe and bodice, and neither use false hair nor deck their heads with flowers. They are neither neat nor clean in their dress. The men are strong, sturdy, simple, hospitable, orderly, dirty, and rough. Their women are brave and hardworking. The Khutegars are weavers and the Hatgars sell milk, butter, clarified butter, and wool, sell sheep and goats, and make and sell country blankets. The Barges are husbandmen. Some Dhangars also work as bricklayers, day labourers, petty shopkeepers, messengers, writers, and a few are moneylenders and cloth merchants. Besides goats and sheep they own cows and buffaloes. They spread all over the district during the fair season, grazing over the whole country, and, for the sake of the manure, are often paid by landholders to pen their flocks in their fields. Their women take milk and butter to market. The men generally spend their time in grazing sheep and goats, and the women, besides minding the house, spin wool and sell milk, butter, and curds. The wool fetches about 7d. (4\u00bd as.) a pound. Many Dhangars buy blankets from their castepeople, add a coloured cotton border, and sell them at a profit of 3d. to 6d. (2-4 as.) on each blanket. The price of a blanket varies according to its texture from 1s. 6d. to 5s. (Rs. \u00bc - 2\u00bd). Exclusive of the material the cost of weaving the two borders of a blanket is about 1d. (\u00bd a.). A man will weave borders on four or five blankets in a day. Dhangars who weave blanket borders have generally capital of \u00a330 to \u00a340 (Rs. 300-400). They have credit with moneylenders and borrow at nine per cent a year. Their chief gods are Bahiroba of Raji in the Indi sub-division of Bijapur, Bhuloba, Khandoba of Jejuri, Tuk\u00e1\u00ed of Tulj\u00e1pur, and Yem\u00e1i of Mardi in Shol\u00e1pur. Dhangars worship the ghosts of their deceased ancestors and keep ancestral images in their houses. On Dasara Day they go to the temple of the god Hedamdev in waste lands with music, and one of them gets possessed and strikes himself with a naked sword but is not wounded. Those who are present throw wool and pieces of cocoa-kernel over their heads and all dance and sing. They have Br\u00e1hman priests who officiate at their marriage and death ceremonies. They keep the usual Hindu holidays and fast on the elevenths of every lunar month. After the birth of a child the mother is held impure for twelve days. For five weeks she is not allowed to cook or to enter the cook room. On the fifth day after the birth the goddess P\u00e1nchvi is worshipped and on the twelfth the child is named. On a lucky day before the boy is three years old his hair is cut in front of the goddess Satv\u00e1\u00ed. A sheep is sacrificed and a feast is held. A lock of hair is left on the child\u2019s skull until a brother or sister is born to him. Seven or eight years later the tuft is removed and a proper top-knot is kept on the crown of the head. They marry their boys between five and fifteen and their girls at any time before they come of age. Their marriage customs are the same as those of cultivating Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, except that the bride sends to the boy a present of about two hundred stuffed cakes. Most Dhangars bury the dead, but those who can afford it burn them. A woman who dies in childbirth is always buried. A feast is given on the twelfth day after death. They have a caste\ncouncil and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They do not send their boys to school and are a steady people.\n\nGavlis, or Milkmen, are returned as numbering 1681 and as found all over the district. They are divided into Bij\u00e1pur Gavlis, Kunbi Gavlis, and Nagarkar Gavlis who neither eat together nor intermarry. The Bij\u00e1pur and the Nagarkar Gavlis are Ling\u00e1yats. The Kunbi Gavlis were formerly in the service of the Bij\u00e1puris. They have established themselves as Gavlis, but eat drink marry and associate with Kunbis from whom they differ in no respect. The chief surnames among the Bij\u00e1pur and Nagarkar Gavlis are Agl\u00e1ve, Ajidv\u00e1ni, B\u00e1shkar, B\u00e1hervadi, Bh\u00e1g\u00e1nagdi, Chipkar, Dh\u00e1j\u00e1le, Divte, Gadya-P\u00e1l\u00e1tukar, Ghule, Ghungre, Gholi, G\u00eds\u00e1l, Huchche, Jangayli, K\u00e1l\u00e1gate, Lakdy\u00e1, Langute, Malkun\u00e1ik, N\u00e1mdhe, Pangud, S\u00e1the, Sh\u00e1d\u00e1pure, and Shol\u00e1pure. The Gavlis look like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and speak Mar\u00e1thi. They are dirty in their habits, but hardworking and thrifty. They keep cattle and sell milk, curds, and cowdung cakes. Their houses are of mud with thatched or tiled roofs and a large yard for cattle, and they have a store of brass vessels. Their staple food includes jv\u00e1ri bread, vegetables, curds, and whey. Their holiday dishes are of sugared milk, wheat bread, and split pulse, and they neither eat flesh nor drink liquor. The men dress in the waistcloth, waistcoat, turban, and blanket; and the women in the ordinary Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. The men wear the ling in their turbans. They generally carry betel and tobacco in a pouch or batva with bells tied to it. Well-to-do men wear earrings and a waistchain, and women ear, nose, arm, and toe rings. The women sit by themselves for three days during their monthly sickness. The men spend their time looking after cattle, cleaning the stable, and with the boys taking the cattle outside of the town to graze. Besides minding the house the women go about selling milk, curds, and cowdung cakes. On the fifth day after the birth of a child the mother worships the goddess Satv\u00e1i and a Jangam or Ling\u00e1yat priest ties a ling to the child\u2019s cot. On the twelfth day five married women with songs cradle the child and name it, the name being given by the village Br\u00e1hman. The mother is bathed, new bangles are put on her wrist, and near kinswomen present her with robes and bodices and her child with frocks. The laps of all the married women are filled with boiled gram, which is also given to children and other guests who either eat it on the spot or take it home. If the family are well-to-do the guests are feasted. On a lucky day, when a boy is eight or ten years old, his head is shaved leaving a top-knot. The hair is offered to the village goddess, and a feast to near relations ends the shaving or j\u00e1val. Before the shaving, the hair is from time to time cut with scissors and kept, and finally offered to the goddess along with the hair shaved off on the lucky day. Some go to the temple of M\u00e1nkeshvar or Satv\u00e1i in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country to shave their boys\u2019 heads for the first time. They marry their girls between six and twelve and their boys some time before they are twenty-five. Before marriage they have the same m\u00e1gni or asking ceremony as among cultivating Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. A day before the asking they worship as the marriage guardian or devak a branch of j\u00e1mbhul, \u00e1mba, saundad, or b\u00e1bhul. When the marriage is fixed, a millet-stalk\nbooth is raised about fourteen feet by eight. It is cowdunged in the inside and covered with a cloth ceiling. About forty pounds of each of the following articles, molasses, sweet oil, wheat, and jv\u00e1ri are heaped in the middle of the marriage hall. On the heap is set a small stone bull or nandi and five married women worship the heap by throwing turmeric and redpowder over it as a sign of good luck. The married women take a handful of jv\u00e1ri in a winnowing fan, and, after sifting it a little, lay it on the ground near the heap. Some elderly woman of the house presents the five married women with turmeric and redpowder and betel packets and they retire to their houses. During the night, neighbouring women come, sing songs, grind the jv\u00e1ri or millet and wheat, and after the whole has been ground return to their homes. The flour, molasses, oil and other articles brought for the marriage are not taken into the house but kept in the marriage hall until the marriage ceremony is over. Next day the boy's relations go to the market and buy five to eleven turbans, waistcloths, shouldercloths, robes, and bodices, and arrange them in a line in the marriage hall. First they pile the turbans in a heap, then the shouldercloths, then the waistcloths, next to them the robes, and last the bodices. On each heap of men's clothes is laid a bit of silver plate with the image of a god stamped on it, and on each heap of women's clothes a silver plate stamped with the image of a goddess. Then the boy's parents with five married women, lay before each of the heaps turmeric, redpowder, betel, and oil cakes, on each of which is laid a little cooked rice and wheat dough mixed with sugar. Last of all lighted lamps are set before the heaps and the heaps are prayed to be kindly. Near the heaps five plantain posts are set three in a line and two in front of the first and third. An elderly married woman presents each of the five married women with turmeric redpowder and betel, and they retire to their homes. At night men are again called to grind jv\u00e1ri and wheat. The flour molasses and oil are kept in the marriage hall and are not taken into the house. Next day the boy's relations go to the market to buy five to eleven bodices, waistcloths, turbans and shouldercloths and lay them in a line in the marriage hall; first the heap of turbans, next the heap of shouldercloths, then the robes, and last the bodices. On each heap of men's clothes are laid silver plates with images of gods, and on the heaps of women's clothes silver plates with goddesses stamped on them. The heap in the middle has a plantain flower or kelphul tied to it and across the three plantain posts is tied a jv\u00e1ri stalk. To the jv\u00e1ri stalk are fastened two white Madras robes, and each of the plantain posts is dressed in a robe and bodice and in the ornaments worn by married women including the nose-ring and neck ornaments. The upper part representing the brow is daubed with redpowder, and in front leaning against the posts two stamped silver plates are laid each on a betel leaf. They take five earthen dishes or par\u00e1ts and laying in each dish an oil cake, a little cooked rice, and some wheat dough, set one dish at each corner post and one between the two robed plantain-goddesses. In each of these five dishes is set a dough lamp with five cotton wicks. Then two pounds\nof millet seed are pounded in a mortar and cooked, and the dough is spread on a handkerchief in front of the plantain posts and kneaded to make it even and hard. Over the layer of millet are spread two pounds of wheat dough. The wheat dough is kneaded like the millet dough and on it five oil cakes are laid. They take about a pound of wheat flour, rub it with butter and make it into a lamp, roll it in a cloth, and put it in an earthen pot filled with cold water and boil it. When it is boiled the wheat lamp is laid on the oil cakes, and other oil cakes are heaped round it so as to hide its bottom. It is filled with butter and furnished with a cotton wick. A new winnowing fan is taken, twenty-one dough lamps are put into the fan and filled with butter and cotton wicks, and lighted along with the big lamp. A piece of camphor is burned close by on a betel leaf and the whole is worshipped. Cakes and cooked rice and vegetables are offered and lighted camphor is waved in front. This is called the chauk bhojani ai or the mother goddess dining in a square. Next day the boy's parents, with kinspeople and music, take in a plate a lighted lamp, an oil can, and three cups holding spices turmeric and redpowder, go to the house of a casteman of a different family stock, and ask him to get them a marriage guardian or devak. The man goes to some waste land and cuts a branch of the b\u00e1bhul, j\u00e1mbhul, mango, or shami tree, generally choosing a mango branch. Both the man and his wife are dressed in their usual clothes and the hems of their garments are knotted together. The man carries a hatchet in his hand and the woman a plate with an oil can and some cups of pink and yellow powder. Four men hold a cloth over their heads, the husband touches the cloth with the hatchet and they start. As they start the boy's father tells them to go to five houses which he names. When they reach one of the houses the woman tells the mistress of the house that So and So ask her to their son's wedding, and, at the same time, she gives the woman whom she asks a little of the oil and some of the coloured powder. When they have asked the five women or jakhins whom the boy's father named, the plate-and-hatchet-bearing couple go back to the boy's. Meanwhile the five wise women or jakhins at whatever inconvenience bathe and go to the boy's. When they come the plate-and-hatchet-bearing husband and wife repeat each other's names and untie their skirts. Each of the five wise women takes an earthen jar from the potter's, and, marking it with lines of cement and redlead, sets it on her head and starts for a river or stream with music, kinswomen, and servants carrying oil cakes and ten pieces of cocoa-kernel and betel. At the river side they spread a carpet and pick five men whom they call virs or heroes. These five men take the earthen pots from the five married women, fill them with water, and set them on a blanket, covering the pot mouths with earthen lids and decking them with flower garlands. The five men are then presented with pieces of cocoa-kernel and packets of betel. The five wise women are then given turmeric which they rub on their cheeks and redpowder with which they cover their brows. Each is presented with an oil cake, a piece of cocoa-kernel, and a betel packet. Lighted camphor is laid on the lid of each of the earthen jars, and,\nwhen it has burnt out, the five women take the earthen pots on their heads and return to the boy\u2019s with music and guests. At the boy\u2019s the pots are set in a corner of the marriage hall and a feast is held when the guests or the five women are given water from the jars to drink. This ends the wise-woman or *jakhin* ceremony.\n\nOn the marriage day the boy is dressed in new clothes, goes on a bullock to the village M\u00e1ruti with kinsmen and kingswomen friends and music, makes a bow, and goes straight to the girl\u2019s house where he and the bride are seated together on a blanket in front of the altar or *bahule*. Round the couple are piled five heaps of millet and wheat, and on each heap is set a coloured earthen pot with betel and turmeric inside and round the pots a thread is wound. Br\u00e1hmans repeat verses, and, when the verses are ended, throw rice over the pair and they are husband and wife. The thread that was passed round the earthen pots is cut in two, a turmeric root is tied to each half, and of the two parts one is wound round the right wrist of the boy and the other round the right wrist of the girl. Betel is served and the guests retire. Next day a feast is held at the boy\u2019s and on the day after at the girl\u2019s. The boy and girl are presented with clothes and seated on the shoulders of two men, who dance while musicians play and the boy and girl pelt each other with sweet scented powder. Then the boy and girl are seated on the shoulders of a man who is called *kotv\u00e1lghoda* or the police commissioner\u2019s horse and he dances to music. Marriage brow-horns or *bh\u00e1shings* are tied to the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s foreheads, they are set on a bullock, and go to the boy\u2019s with kinsfolk and music. At the boy\u2019s the two kinsmen and the double-burdened police horse again dance the couple, betel or wheat bread and rice are served, and the guests retire.\n\nExcept women who die in childbirth Gavlis bury the dead. The body is carried sitting in a bamboo frame, the grave is dug, and sprinkled with cowdung and cow urine and water in which a Jangam\u2019s feet have been washed. The body is lowered into the grave and the Jangam goes into the grave, drops some water in which his toe has been dipped into the dead mouth, places the *lingam* which the dead wore in his clasped hands, and comes out. The grave is filled with earth up to the corpse\u2019s neck, from that till the head is covered it is filled with salt, and above that with earth. When they come home the mourning family are impure for three days, and on the fourth day are purified by drinking a mixture of cow\u2019s urine, dung, milk, curds, sugar, and honey. They worship all the usual Hindu gods, and chiefly Amb\u00e1h\u00e1i, Khandoba, and Krishna, and fast on Mondays, on the elevenths of every lunar month, and on *Gokulashtami* in August and *Anantchaturdashi* in September. Their priests are Jangams whom they hold in great respect. They call caste meetings to settle social disputes. Caste offences are punished with fine, and after the fine is paid the offender drinks water in which a Jangam\u2019s toe has been washed, and is pure. They do not send their boys to school and are a poor people.\n\n**Fishers** include two castes with a strength of 8705 or 1\u00b76 per cent of the Hindu population. Of these 1001 (males 494,\nfemales 507) were Bhois; and 7704 (males 3939, females 3765) were Kolis.\n\nBhois, or Fishers, are returned as numbering 1001 and as found in towns and large villages. They are divided into Mar\u00e1tha Bhois who speak Mar\u00e1thi and Pardeshi Bhois who speak Hindust\u00e1ni. The following particulars apply to Pardeshi Bhois. They live in mud or stone houses with thatched roofs, and have metal and earthen vessels in store. They are said not to eat fowls, but they eat fish and the flesh of goats and sheep. Their staple food is j\u00fadri and vegetables. The men dress in a loincloth, waistcloth, a coarse cotton jacket, and a Mar\u00e1tha turban; and the women wear the bodice and robe without drawing the end of the robe back between the feet. They are a lazy and dirty people, earning their living as fishers and day-labourers, the women helping the men in selling the fish. Their chief god is Vyankoba. They keep all Hindu holidays, and their priests are ordinary village Br\u00e1hmans. After childbirth the mother is impure for seven days. In the evening of the fifth day the goddess Satv\u00e1i is worshipped, and the child is named on the thirteenth. When it is a year old the child's head is shaved, whether it is a boy or a girl, and in the evening the caste are feasted. On the marriage day Pardeshi Bhois fix a post in the ground in the middle of the booth, and place near the post a new earthen jar filled with cold water. When the boy comes to the girl's house, he and the girl are bathed in the booth with the cold water from the jar, and they are seated near the post. The Kulkarni or any other Br\u00e1hman repeats marriage verses, throws grains of rice over their heads, and they walk five times round the post and are husband and wife. Marriage brow-horns or b\u00e1shings of date palm or shind\u00ed leaves are tied to their brows, and the boy goes walking with the bride to his house with kinsfolk friends and music. Their marriage guardian or dev\u00e1k is the sun god or Surya. They allow widow marriage and either bury or burn the dead. Their chief deities are Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i, Bahiroba, and Khandoba; and their great holiday is Shivr\u00e1tra in February. Their headman, who is called chandh\u00e1ri, settles social disputes and levies fines varying from 2s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 1 - 50). When a fine of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) is recovered the headman is presented with a turban, and the rest is spent in a feast. They do not send their boys to school. Fish is in little demand and they are a poor people.\n\nKolis are returned as numbering 7704 and as found all over the district. According to a book called the M\u00e1l\u00fat\u00e1rangranth, Sh\u00e1liv\u00e1h\u00e1n, with his minister R\u00e1mchandra Ud\u00e1vant Son\u00e1r, sent four Koli chiefs from Paithan to Shol\u00e1pur, to punish a rebel in the Dindirvan forest. After the rising was put down the Koli chiefs were placed in charge of the forest and the country round, and were ordered to maintain themselves by carrying on the work of boatmen and by acting as priests in all Mah\u00e1dev temples. Afterwards two more chiefs with their families and the parents of the four original chiefs came and settled in the district. The names of the four original chiefs were Abhangr\u00e1v, Adhatr\u00e1v,\n\n1 Details of the Mar\u00e1tha Bhoi customs are given in the Poona Statistical Account.\nNehetr\u00e1v, and Parchande, and these with a few others have become Koli surnames. The Kolis are divided into Mar\u00e1tha and P\u00e1nbhari or P\u00e1n Kolis who eat together and intermarry.\\(^1\\) The names in common use among men are B\u00e1b\u00e1ji, Hari, Keru, Kondi, Limba, Mukund, N\u00e1th\u00e1j\u00ed, P\u00e1ndu, and Rakhma; and among women Bh\u00e1g\u00fa, Gita, Kondu, Kusha, Krishna, Rakhma, Rangu, and Tulsi. They look like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and are strong, dark, and hardy, the men wearing the top-knot moustache and whiskers, but not the beard. They speak an incorrect Mar\u00e1thi mixed with peculiar expressions, some for shortness sake and others without any apparent reason.\\(^2\\) They live in middle class houses\u2014one storey high with walls of mud and stone and flat roofs. They are not neat or clean, and their house goods include a cot, a cradle, and a couple of boxes, blankets, carpets, and metal and earthen cooking vessels. They keep cows, buffaloes, goats, and domestic fowls, but not servants. Their staple food includes millet, pulse, and vegetables, and they are very fond of chillies and hot spices. They give caste dinners on marriages and the anniversaries of deaths. They eat fish and the flesh of goats, sheep, hares, deer, and domestic fowls and eggs. They hold themselves impure when they eat flesh and on that day do not visit the temple. Such of them as have turned V\u00e1rkaris or season-keepers to the Pandharpur Vithoba and wear necklaces of basil or tulsi leaves, have given up eating flesh. They sometimes get over the difficulty by hanging their tulsi necklaces to a peg in the house before tasting flesh and putting them on again next morning after bathing. They use spirituous and other intoxicating drinks, eat opium, and smoke hemp flowers and tobacco but not to excess. Both men and women dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The men dress in the loin and waistcloth, coat, waistcoat, Mar\u00e1tha turban, and sandals or Br\u00e1hman shoes, and rub their brows with sandal. The women wear a robe and bodice, but do not pass the end of the robe back between the feet. They tie their hair in a knot behind the head, rub their brows with redpowder, but do not wear false hair or deck their heads with flowers. Neither men nor women are neat or clean in their dress. Their only special rule regarding clothes is that the women never wear black robes and that the men never wear black turbans. They have special clothes for great occasions and their gold, silver, and pearl ornaments are the same as those worn by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They are a hardworking, even-tempered, thrifty, hospitable, and orderly people. They are boatmen, carrying passengers across rivers and streams during the rainy season, charging \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{d.} \\) (\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\text{a.} \\)) for each fare, except people of their own village or town who give them a grain allowance at the end of the year.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Besides these two classes of Kolis some K\u00e1m\u00e1this from the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills in the Niz\u00e1m's country call themselves Mah\u00e1dev Kolis. Most speak Mar\u00e1thi out of doors, but in many families the home speech is Telugu. This class is interesting as they apparently are the origin of the Mah\u00e1dev Kolis of the Ahmadnagar hills. Details are given in the Ahmadnagar Statistical Account.\n\n\\(^2\\) Thus for do not want nako; they say nag; for yonder palikade, palyad; for take this he ghe, hinga; for plenty pushkal, lai, or m\u00e1ym\u00e1l; for little thode, ulis; for there tikade, takad; for here \u00fakade, hakad; for soon taokar, begi; and for beat m\u00f3r, h\u00e1n.\n\np 125\u201420\nThey are hereditary ministrants in Mah\u00e1dev\u2019s shrines and take to themselves the offerings laid before the god. The P\u00e1n Kolis or watermen carry water in bags on the backs of buffaloes, supply the villagers, and receive a yearly allowance in grain, hay, or money. The Kolis are also husbandmen and are helped in their work by their wives and children. They are a poor class sunk in debt which they have undergone to meet special expenses on marriages and deaths and on boat building. They claim the same rank as Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis with whom they dine. A Koli rises at dawn and goes to his boat. About eight he eats a bit of bread either in the boat or on the river bank with onions and powdered chillies, and washes it down by a draught of water. He returns home between eleven and twelve, bathes, takes his midday meal, and, after an hour\u2019s nap, goes to the shrine of which he is ministrant or to the place where his caste meet to get his share of the day\u2019s earnings. If he has nothing else to do, unless he is an old man, he joins his companions in playing cards or other games, or he goes to a house where the sacred books or Pur\u00e1ns are read and sits hearing them. During the dry months, when there is no ferrying, unless he has a shrine to look after, a Koli generally moves about the country in search of work. The Kolis\u2019 busy season is during the rains, and in large towns such as Pandharpur they are hardworked during the fairs or jatr\u00e1s. P\u00e1n Kolis have no busy or slack time, as they have to work all the year round. They are a religious people and worship the usual Hindu gods and goddesses. Their family gods are Vithoba of Pandharpur, Bhav\u00e1ni of Tulj\u00e1pur, and Khandoba of Jejuri. Their priests are Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans to whom they pay great respect. They keep the usual Hindu fasts and festivals. Their spiritual guides or gurus are the slit-eared or K\u00e1nph\u00e1ta Gos\u00e1vis. When a member of a family wishes to become the disciple of a teacher, the teacher is asked to the house and is seated on a stool. The candidate bathes and sits in front of the teacher, washes his feet, and worships him by rubbing sweet scented oil on his brow, throwing garlands of flowers round his neck, and flowers and rice over his head. He presents the teacher with 6d. to 2s. (Re. \u00bd-1) in cash and bows before him. The guru fastens a rosary of one hundred and eight basil beads round the candidate\u2019s neck and whispers something in his right ear. A feast to the guru and a few near relations or friends ends the ceremony. The Gos\u00e1vi becomes the family guide and the members of the family take advice from no one else. Kolis believe in sorcery, witchcraft, soothsaying, omens, and lucky and unlucky days, and consult oracles. They marry their boys before they are twenty, and their girls before they are twelve. The father of the boy has to look out for a suitable girl as a wife for his son. When he has found a girl he goes to her house with the family priest and a few near kinsmen and fixes the marriage day. He presents the girl with a robe and bodice, serves betel, and returns home. This is called the m\u00e1gni or asking. Five days before the marriage day, five married women bathe the boy and rub him with oil and turmeric. Some of the women of the boy\u2019s house put the rest of the turmeric in a leaf cup, take it to the girl\u2019s with a robe and bodice, bathe her, rub her with oil and turmeric, dress her in the robe and bodice, and return to the boy\u2019s.\nOn the second or third day after the turmeric-rubbing, at both houses, they call seven married women with their husbands, and, going to waste lands, bring branches of five trees or *p\u00e1nchp\u00e1lvis*, and, together with the hatchet with which they chopped the branches and some cooked food, tie them to one of the posts of the booth, and this they call the marriage god or *devak*. At night a dinner is given. On the wedding day an earthen altar is built in the girl's house. In the afternoon the boy, dressed in his best clothes, with a marriage ornament or *b\u00e1shing* tied to his brow with kinsfolk and friends, goes riding on horseback to the village temple, and thence to the girl's house. Here a woman waves a cake round his head, and, dividing the cake in two, throws one part to the right and the other to the left. He dismounts and takes his seat in the booth on a carpet. The Br\u00e1hman priest rubs his brow with sandal and hands him a new turban which he folds round his head. Two baskets plaited with acacia or *b\u00e1bhul* twigs are set opposite each other, and in one of them is laid a grindstone and in the other a coil of rope. The girl stands in the grindstone basket and the boy in the rope basket and the priest ties round the girl's neck a necklace of black glass beads. Between them two Br\u00e1hmans, who repeat marriage verses, hold a new waistcloth, and, at the end, they throw grains of rice over the couple's head and seat them in the baskets. The priest five times winds cotton thread round the couple's necks and the girl's father presents the boy with a brass plate and a waterpot and pours water over the girl's hands who lets it fall on the boy's hands. This forms the girl-giving or *kany\u00e1d\u00e1n*. The priest takes the thread off their necks, cuts it in two equal parts, dyes it yellow with turmeric powder, and tying a piece of turmeric root to each half, binds one to the left wrist of the girl and the other to the right wrist of the boy. This is called tying the marriage wristlets or *kankans*. The boy and the girl take their seats on the altar near each other and in front of them is set a dish with a lighted lamp in it. Kinspeople draw near, wave a copper coin round the couple's heads, and throw the coin into the dish. The money thrown into the dish is equally divided between a Bh\u00e1t and a Gurav. The hems of the boy's and girl's robes are knotted together and the priest takes them to bow before the house gods. They seat themselves as before on the altar and the priest unties the hems of their garments. Betel is served and the guests withdraw. The girl's mother offers the boy and the girl sweetmeats which they eat. For about a couple of days the boy stays at the girl's, during which the boy and girl bathe together, and splash one another with water and blow water from their mouths over each other. Caste dinners are interchanged, and, on the evening of the third day, the boy's father with kinspeople and a plate containing a new bodice and robe, grains of rice, red and turmeric powder, and betel packets comes to the bride's. The priest takes a waterpot, puts water and a betelnut and turmeric root into it, and sets it on a heap of rice. Over the pot are placed a couple of cocoa-kernels and round the pot a thread is wound. A betelnut is set near the pot and the boy and girl, sitting in front of them, worship the betelnut and the waterpot by throwing over\nthem red and turmeric powder and flowers. After waving a lighted lamp before them and throwing grains of rice, the priest lifts the waterpot, and with it touches the brows of the boy and girl, and again sets it down on the spot where it was. He does this thrice and at the end asks the boy and girl separately, 'Has the burden been removed?' Each of them answers 'It has been taken away.' The priest takes the robe and bodice and presents them to the girl and she puts them on and sits as before. The priest unties the marriage wristlets or kankans, and seating the boy and the girl on horseback takes them in procession to the boy's accompanied by kinsfolk and music. Next day at the houses both of the boy and the girl, the married couple who previous to the marriage had installed the marriage guardians or devaks, that is the hatchet and five tree leaves or panchpalvis, bathe, and, with their garments knotted together, throw rice grains on the hatchet and five tree leaves, bow before them and ask the guardians to depart and the wedding is over. Except that they hold a girl unclean for three days, the Kolis do not perform any ceremony when a girl comes of age. For her first confinement a Koli girl goes to her mother's. As soon as the child is born, cold water is sprinkled over it to make it hardy and fearless. The midwife, who is generally a Maratha, cuts the navel cord and buries it in the lying-in room. On the fifth day the mother worships the goddess Satvai and the members of the family keep awake the whole night. The mother is held impure for ten days and on the eleventh she and her child are bathed, their clothes are washed, the house is cowdunged, and the mother and child are pure. On the twelfth day the mother sets five pebbles outside of the house and lays sandal, flowers, vermillion, and sweetmeats before them. They name their girl on the thirteenth day after birth. When a child is between one and three years old it is laid on its mother's lap and its hair is clipped by a barber. They either bury or burn their dead. On the way to the burning ground they halt, and leaving a cake and cooked rice folded in an old piece of cloth go to the burning ground. The body is either buried or burnt and the chief mourner, taking the firepot and filling it with water, goes round the grave or the pyre, and picking a pebble makes a hole in the jar, dashes the pebble and the jar on the ground, and beats his mouth with the palm of his open hand. He marks the spot by a big stone, bathes in the river or stream, and goes home. Except the four bearers the mourners do not enter the house but stand outside. The four bearers are given packets of betelnut and leaves which they bite, and, coming out, spit the betel in front of the other mourners. Then the chief mourner walks into the house and the rest go to their homes. The chief mourner remains impure for ten days. On the third day with a few near kinsmen he goes to the burning ground, removes the ashes, sprinkles flowers over the spot, lays two earthen saucers one with bread and the other with water, bathes, and goes home. Either on the tenth or the twelfth day the chief mourner goes to\n\n1 The Marathi runs: Oze utarle k\u00e1y? Hoy utarle.\nthe burning ground and has his moustache shaved. He then takes a *nimba* branch, dips it in oil, and with it touches the shoulders of the four corpse-bearers, asking them at the same time 'Are the shoulders rested,' and they answer 'They are rested.' When they go home a mutton feast is held. A Bh\u00e1t who is called in, sings songs, and leaves with uncooked food and money. His nearest relations present the chief mourner with a turban and he is free to go out. The Kol\u00eds have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school but do not keep them for more than a couple of years. They take to no new pursuits and are a poor class.\n\n**Labourers** include six classes with a strength of 7416 or 1\u00b74 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division | Males | Females | Total |\n|----------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Kal\u00e1ls   | 70    | 55      | 125   |\n| K\u00e1m\u00e1th\u00eds | 108   | 106     | 214   |\n| Kh\u00e1t\u00edks  | 364   | 882     | 746   |\n| Lodh\u00eds   | 159   | 173     | 332   |\n| Panch\u00eds  | 1897  | 1688    | 3585  |\n| Rad\u00eds    | 1317  | 1831    | 3148  |\n| **Total**| **3715** | **3701** | **7416** |\n\n**Kal\u00e1ls**, or Distillers, are returned as numbering 125 and as found in the town of Shol\u00e1pur. They are said to have come into the district from Lucknow about forty years ago in search of work. They are dark and strong. The men wear the top-knot and ear-knots, and the moustache and whiskers. They speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, their houses are of mud and stone one or more storeys high, with flat or tiled roofs. They keep cattle and ponies, and their staple food is *jv\u00e1ri*, split pulse, and vegetables. They do not eat fish or flesh, neither do they drink liquor. The men wear a short waistcloth tucked behind, a coat; waistcoat, and shouldercloth; and the women, a petticoat or robe and a bodice fastened either at the back or in front. Their ornaments are generally the same as those of Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, except that their nosering which is of gold with a couple of pearls fastened in it is so heavy that its weight is borne by a silk thread fastened in the hair. Some make and sell spirits, others are husbandmen, and others serve as day labourers. They worship the goddess Satv\u00e1i on the fifth day after childbirth, and clip the child's hair except its top-knot. The mother is impure for ten days and on the twelfth the child is named by a Br\u00e1hman priest. They marry their children at any age but their girls generally before they come of age. They burn their dead and mourn ten days. On the tenth day they offer rice balls to crows and beg them to eat, and on the twelfth the caste is feasted. They practise polygamy but do not allow widow marriage. On the death of the husband the widow's necklace and nosering are taken off, but her\n\n---\n\n1 The Mar\u00e1thi is, Kh\u00e1nd\u00e9 utarle k\u00e1y? Hoy utarle.\nhead is not shaved, and she is allowed to wear bangles. A headman called either mukhi or shetya settles all their social disputes. They send their boys to school but only for a short time and are a poor people.\n\nKa'ma'this are returned as numbering 214 and as found in small numbers over the whole district. They have come from the Niz\u00e1m's country since the beginning of British rule. They are tall dark and robust, and their young women are goodlooking and healthy. A few speak Telugu, and the rest Mar\u00e1thi and write B\u00e1lbodh. They are an active, hardworking, and frugal people. They are masons, husbandmen, gardeners, messengers, blacksmiths, carpenters, housebuilders, painters, stonecutters, shopkeepers, grain sellers, moneylenders, and moneychangers. Most of them are labourers, both men and women working for daily hire. Their houses are built of stone and earth with flat roofs. They keep cattle and horses but have no servants. Their food includes jv\u00e1ri, b\u00e1jri, pulse, fish, and the flesh of goats and sheep, deer, fowls, and hares. They drink liquor and serve it to such of the guests as take it before sitting to dine. They give caste dinners on births marriages and deaths. The men dress in a round turban much like a Mar\u00e1tha Kunbi turban, a coat, a jacket, and a waistcloth. The women dress in a robe and bodice. Their boys are married between eleven and fifteen and their girls between nine and eleven. The boy's father sends a present to the girl's to ask if her parents will give their daughter in marriage. If they agree, a Deshash Br\u00e1hman is called, the horoscopes of the boy and girl are laid before him, and he calculates and says whether or not the marriage will prove lucky. Next day, if the answer is favourable, the boy's father with a Br\u00e1hman and a few kinspeople, goes to the girl's and the Br\u00e1hman tells them that the stars are favourable. The Br\u00e1hman prepares two marriage papers or patrik\u00e1s, fixes the marriage day, and leaves with a present of about 1s. (8 us.) from each house. Then the boy's father with his nearest kinsfolk and friends, and with the Br\u00e1hman priest goes to the girl's and sits on a carpet on the veranda. The girl is called, the priest repeats verses, and the boy's father presents the girl with a robe and bodice and an ornament. The girl takes the present, goes into the house, dresses, and coming out resumes her seat. The boy's father fills her lap with fruit and dry cocoa kernels. He and his friends are treated to a feast of cooked rice with sugar, and return to their homes with a packet of betelnut and leaves. About two days before the marriage the girl's parents with music and friends go to the boy's with a present of millet gruel or \u00e1mbil and offer it to little children. In front of the house a marriage hall is built and on one side of the hall an earthen altar is raised. On the wedding morning after the household have bathed, five married women are asked to a feast, and a wedding guardian or devak which consists of \u00e1pta Bauhinia tomentosa, shami Prosopis spicegera, mango, and j\u00e1mbhul Syzigium jambolanum branches, is brought with music from M\u00e1ruti's temple where a Gurav sits with the branches in his hands. Then with music they bring from the potter's eleven earthen pots and drop some grains of rice into each pot,\nsprinkle the pots with turmeric powder, and lay them before the house gods. The boy's relations present the girl with a robe and bodice, rub her body with turmeric, and fill her lap with fruit, cocoa-kernels, and rice, a feast is held, and the boy's relations retire. The boy's relations seat the boy on horseback and start in procession for the girl's. At the girl's door cooked rice and cocoanuts are waved round the boy's head and dashed on the ground. The boy walks into the marriage hall and is seated on the altar. The girl is called and she and her mother are presented with a robe and bodice, and her father with a turban. The boy stands on the altar and the girl is made to stand before him face to face and a cloth is held between them. The Br\u00e1hman repeats verses and the guests keep throwing grains of jv\u00e1ri on the heads of the boy and girl. When this is over the boy and girl are husband and wife. They are seated on low wooden stools near the altar and round their wrists threads are bound to each of which is tied a turmeric root and a marriage paper or patrika. The boy and girl then go into the house and bow before the house gods. A feast is given, betel is served, and the guests withdraw. Next morning the boy and girl are taken to the girl's and friends and relations are feasted. On the third day comes the s\u00e1da or robe ceremony when the boy's father presents the girl with a robe and bodice and ornaments, and the girl's father presents the boy with a turban and waistcloth. The boy and girl are seated on horseback, taken to the village god, and brought back to the girl's house, where they bow to the elders of the family and to the house gods and the boy's parents take the boy to their house with the girl. The wedding ends with a feast or two at the boy's to the girl's friends and the untying of the turmeric bracelets and the marriage papers. Widow marriage is allowed. The man makes the offer of marriage, and the wedding generally takes place between ten and twelve at night in the presence of a few near relations. It is kept secret till next morning when a few kinspeople and friends are asked to dine. When a girl comes of age word is sent to the boy's and she is taken with music to the boy's house. If the family is well-to-do a wooden frame is built, if not, she is seated on a blanket in the house near the wall. She rubs wet turmeric on her hands and presses them over her back against the wall. On the fourth day the boy's mother bathes her, and, on any lucky day within sixteen days after she comes of age, her parents present her with a robe and bodice.

When the child is born a hole is dug, and, along with a copper coin, the navel cord and afterbirth are buried in the hole. The child is bathed, rolled in swaddling bands, and laid on the cot beside its mother. The mother is bathed,\nChapter III.\nPeople.\n\nLABOURERS.\nK\u00e1m\u00e1this.\n\nbows before the hole, and is laid on the cot.

On the twelfth the child is named and married women are feasted. The guests present the mother and child with clothes, lay the child in a cradle, and name it, wet gram is served, and the guests withdraw. After three months the father's kinsfolk present the mother with clothes, her lap is filled with rice and fruit, and her husband's kinspeople bring her to his house. Between the time when the child is three months and one year old a barber clips its hair and a feast is given. Until the mother is pregnant a second time, no top-knot is left on the boy's head. When she becomes pregnant she and the child are taken before the village god and a tuft of hair is left on the crown of the child's head. Near kinspeople are feasted on the spot, and they return to their homes. When a K\u00e1m\u00e1thi dies butter is rubbed on his head and warm water is poured over his body, a silk cloth is tied round his loins, his body is sprinkled with redpowder and betel leaves, flower garlands are thrown round his neck, the Jangam marks the brow with cowdung ashes, and the body is laid on a bamboo bier. The body is covered from head to foot with a white cloth, it is raised by four persons, musicians head the party, and the son walks in front of the bearers with an earthen firepot. The Jangam walks in front blowing a conch shell. The body is burnt, and the Jangam retires with a present of a couple of coppers. As soon as the body is moved from the house, the spot on which it lay is cowdunged, ashes are spread, and a lighted lamp is set close by and left for three days. At the end of the three days the ashes are searched for footprints, and the marks are supposed to be those of the animal into which the spirit of the dead has passed. After examining them the ashes are gathered and thrown into the river. Mourning lasts ten days.

They are divided into G\u0101da or Cart Vad\u0101rs, M\u0101ti or Earth Vad\u0101rs, and P\u0101thrat or Stone Vad\u0101rs, who eat together and intermarry. Cart Vad\u0101rs take their name from their low solid-wheeled stone carrying carts, Earth Vad\u0101rs because they do earth work, and Stone Vad\u0101rs because they quarry and dress the stone. They are dark, tall, and regular-featured, the men wear a topknot, whiskers, and moustache, but not the beard. Boys up to twelve or thirteen wear ear knots. Their home tongue is Telugu, but with others they speak Mar\u0101thi. They live outside of villages in mud and stone houses with flat roofs, and some in huts of cane or mats of long stiff grass or pansar. Their houses are filthy, and are surrounded by pigs, donkeys, fowls, cattle, dogs, and buffaloes. Their staple food is jv\u0101r\u012b, vegetables, and pounded chillies, and when they can afford it, they eat the flesh of sheep, goats, fowls, hogs, and rats of which they are specially fond. They drink liquor but do not eat beef. They keep from animal food on Fridays Saturdays and Mondays in honour of their gods Narsoba and Vyankoba. Their dress is like that of other low caste Hindus. The men wear a coarse white turban or scarf, a shoulder-cloth, short trousers reaching to the knee, and a jacket. They wear sandals and forbid shoes so strictly that any one who wears shoes is put out of caste and is not allowed to come back. Their\nwomen wear the robe but not the bodice. They have glass bangles on the left wrist, and tin brass or silver bangles on the right wrist, and they wear nose and ear rings, necklaces, wristlets, and false hair. The younger women deck their heads with flowers. As a class Vad\u00e1rs are hardworking, thrifty, hospitable, and orderly, but rude, drunken, hot-tempered, and of unsettled habits. The G\u00e1da or Cart Vad\u00e1rs carry building stone either in low solid-wheeled carts or on donkeys. The M\u00e1t\u00ed or Earth Vad\u00e1rs dig ponds and wells and make field banks. The P\u00e1thrat or Stone Vad\u00e1rs cut and make grindstones, quarry, and work as masons. They are also known as Gavandis. They make stone images of gods and animals and cups, which are bought by pilgrims at Pandharpur. The three classes keep to their hereditary calling. They say they do not wish to snatch another\u2019s bread and put it into their own mouths. They work as field labourers and sometimes beg. Children, as soon as they are old enough, help the men in their work but the women generally do nothing but mind the house. They are one of the hardest working classes in the Deccan, working in gangs almost always by the piece. Their services have been of the greatest value in the great water and railway works which have been pushed forward in the Deccan during the last ten years. They have worked hard and earned high wages, but spent much of their earnings on liquor. High caste Hindus touch Vad\u00e1rs, and they hold aloof from Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs. They worship the usual Hindu gods and goddesses, and their chief object of worship is Vyankoba of Giri or Tirupati in North Arkot. They worship Mariamma, Narsoba, Padmava, and Yallamma. Among their house gods are the images of their deceased ancestors, generally square flat metal plates with turned edges and a figure stamped on them. They worship them with the same rites as other Hindus, washing them, rubbing them with sandal, throwing flowers over them, burning incense before them, and offering them cooked food. They have no priests, but ask Br\u00e1hmans to name their children and to fix a lucky day for their children\u2019s marriages. They keep the regular Hindu fasts and feasts. They make pilgrimages to Pandharpur, Tulj\u00e1pur, and Vyankatgiri in North Arkot. They believe in sorcery witchcraft and soothsaying. They generally marry their boys after twenty and their girls after sixteen. An unmarried girl who has a child is put out of caste and is not allowed to come back. They allow widow marriage and practise polygamy. They have no music at their marriages, exchange no presents of clothes, and do not rub the boy and girl with turmeric. They say they used to have music, presents, and turmeric, but gave them up because a man who was sent by one of their chiefs to buy clothes for a wedding on his way to the town saw by the roadside the lower half of a stone handmill. He lifted the stone and under it saw a beautiful naked girl the goddess Satv\u00e1i. The girl told him to put back the stone. He was confused by her beauty, failed to obey, and was struck dead. The chief waited for a time and had to go on with the marriage without the presents. When the marriage was over they searched the country and found the dead man. Since then they have never used turmeric music or presents. Vad\u00e1rs are bound together by a strong caste feeling and settle their social disputes at caste meetings. They do not send their\nboys to school. During the last three or four years they have enjoyed steady and highly paid work.\n\nVanjaris are returned as numbering 3508 and found in all sub-divisions. They are tall, dark, and rather goodlooking, and their women are healthy and well made. They speak Marathi somewhat mixed with Gujarati, and are an indolent class. They earn their living as day-labourers and field workers. They generally live in grass huts inside the village, and their staple food includes jv\u00e1ri bread, pulse, and vegetables. Some of the men eat the flesh of goats and sheep, and drink liquor, but the women touch neither liquor nor flesh. The men dress in a loincloth and waistcloth, a jacket, a scarf or turban, and shoes. They sometimes carry a blanket and throw a cloth over their shoulders both in front and behind. Their women wear the Maratha robe and bodice. They have silk and embroidered clothes in store which they wear on great days. Both men and women pass their time in the fields and their children go to the waste to graze cattle. Unlike other Hindus they use the cow as a beast of burden. On the fifth day after the birth of a child they worship the goddess Satvai and get a Br\u00e1hman to name the child on any lucky day between the twelfth and the marriage day. They marry their children at any time between five and thirty but girls are generally married between twelve and twenty. Their marriage ceremony lasts five days and they rub the boy and girl with turmeric at their houses, at least couple of days before the marriage. Marriage halls are raised at both houses and kinspeople and castefellows are feasted. On the marriage day the boy, with kinspeople friends and music goes to the girl's on a bullock and they are married, the marriage verses being repeated by a village Br\u00e1hman. Feasts are given at both houses and when the feasts are over the boy goes with his wife on a bullock to his house with kinspeople and music. They allow widow marriage and practise polygamy. They generally burn their dead, and mourn ten days, offer wheat cakes and balls to the crows, and purify themselves. The ceremony ends with a caste feast on the thirteenth. They worship Ambabhavani, Mah\u00e1dev, and R\u00e1mchandra, and also non-Br\u00e1hmanic gods as Mari\u00e1\u00ed, Mhasoba, and V\u00e1ghoba whom they generally fear. They keep the usual Hindu fasts and feasts, and there has been no recent change in their religious beliefs. They settle their social disputes at meetings of the castemen. They do not send their boys to school. They have not yet recovered their losses during the 1876 famine.\n\nDepressed Classes include four castes with a strength of 65,330 or 12\u00b713 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division     | Males | Females | Total |\n|--------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Dhors        | 1009  | 1049    | 2058  |\n| Hal\u00e1lkhors   | 24    | 14      | 38    |\n| Mhars        | 21,944| 22,057  | 44,001|\n| M\u00e1ngs        | 9625  | 9608    | 19,233|\n| **Total**    | **32,602** | **32,798** | **65,330** |\n\nChapter III.\nPeople.\nUnsettled Tribes.\nVanjaris.\n\nDepressed Classes.\nDhors, or Tanners, are returned as numbering 2058 and as found over the whole district. The founder of the caste is said to have been the sage Lurbh\u00e1t who was born of an Aygav father and a Dhigvar mother. Their surnames are Bor\u00e1de, Katavdore, Khandore, and Sinde. They are divided into Mar\u00e1tha and Ling\u00e1yat Dhors who do not eat together or intermarry. In each division families having the same surname eat together but do not intermarry. They are generally dark with round faces, thick lips, and straight black hair. The men wear the moustache and cut the head hair short. Both at home and abroad most speak Mar\u00e1thi, and the rest speak K\u00e1narese at home. Their houses are generally ill-cared for, one storey high, with mud and stone walls, and flat roofs. A few live in thatched huts. They have a front veranda which is used as a shop. Their vessels are of metal and clay and they have cattle and a servant or two to help them. Their staple food includes jv\u00e1ri bread, pulse, and vegetables, and they eat the flesh of goats and sheep and drink liquor. Their holiday dishes of rice, wheat, and gram cost a family of five 1s. to 4s. (Rs. \u00bd - 2) and their caste feast cost \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10-15) the hundred guests. The men dress in a loincloth, a waistcloth, a turban, a waistcoat, a shouldercloth, and a blanket; and the women wear the robe and bodice in Mar\u00e1tha fashion. They have a spare suit of clothes for holidays and other festive occasions. They are hardworking and hospitable, but intemperate and dirty. They work in leather, cut and dye skins, make saddles shoes and water-bags, and till the ground. They are fairly off. They are religious and keep house deities, generally B\u00e9hiroba, Bhav\u00e1ni, and Khandoba. Their priests are the ordinary village Br\u00e1hmans whom they greatly respect. They fast on every lunar eleventh and on Shivr\u00e1tra in February. The Ling\u00e1yat Dhors who are a small body are invested with a ling by a Jangam soon after birth. Their teacher or guru who is a Ling\u00e1yat visits them occasionally when each family gives him 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bc) in cash. Some well-to-do families give more, and also hold caste dinners in his honour. Except the Ling\u00e1yat, Dhors hold their women impure for ten days after childbirth. In their customs they differ little from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Their guardian or devak is formed of the branches of five trees or p\u00e1nchp\u00e1lvis, which they tie to a post in the marriage booth. At the time of marriage the boy is made to stand on a grindstone and the girl facing him in a basket on a coil of thick plough rope, belonging to her father's field. A quilt is held between them, the Br\u00e1hman priest utters some words and throws grains of rice over their heads, and they are husband and wife. They are then seated on an earthen altar in the marriage hall, and, to keep off evil, married women draw near and each in turn takes a few rice grains in her hands and throws them over the boy's and the girl's head, body, knees, and feet. The hems of their garments are knotted together and they are taken on a bullock to the village M\u00e1ruti, and thence to the boy's. They allow widow marriage and practise polygamy. They either bury or burn the dead, and mourn ten days. The chief mourner shaves his moustache and the body is carried on the shoulders of two bearers in a blanket or coarse cloth slung on a pole. Ling\u00e1yat Dhors as a rule bury the dead, do not shave the\nmourners' moustache, and observe no mourning. Their headman is called Mhetar and their social disputes are settled at caste meetings. They do not send their boys to school. They are well-to-do, living in comfort and laying by.\n\nHala\u0142khors, or Scavengers, are returned as numbering thirty-eight and as found in all municipal towns. They are Hindustanis and have come into the district since the establishment of municipalities for whom they work as night-soil men. They are tall dark and thin, and the men wear the moustache, beard, and whiskers. They speak Hindustani. Their houses are like those of poor cultivating Marathas, and they have metal and earthen vessels and cots. They keep cattle, sheep, goats, and fowls, and eat the flesh of sheep, goats, fowls, cows, and hares, and drink liquor. A family of five spends 10s. to 14s. (Rs. 5-7) a month on food, and a caste feast costs them about \u00a36 (Rs. 60) the hundred guests. At their feasts they use large quantities of flesh and liquor. The men dress in short trousers, a waistcloth, a coat, a jacket, and a turban or headscarf. The women wear the Maratha robe and bodice, and like Maratha women, when at work, they tuck the end of the robe back between the feet. A family of five spends about \u00a33 (Rs. 30) a year on clothes. Their women wear neck, nose, and ear ornaments, and glass bangles on their wrists. Most of them have spare clothes in store. They sometimes have sets of silver masks or talas in their houses which they worship without the help of any priest. Their priests are ordinary village Brahmins, who during the marriage stand at a distance and repeat the texts. They have a caste council; a few of them send their boys to school, and they are a steady class.\n\nMangs are returned as numbering 19,233 or 3\u00b76 per cent of the Hindu population and as found all over the district. According to their tradition they are descended from Jambrishi, and their ancestors came into Pandharpur at the same time as the god Vithoba. They say that their high priest or chief Dakalvar, who lives in Karwar in North Kanara, knows their whole history and occasionally visits them. They are divided into Mangs proper, Mang Garudis, Pend Mangs, Holar Mangs, Mochi Mangs, and Dakalvars. Of these the first are considered the highest, and their leavings are eaten by Holars and Dakalvars. The Dakalvars say they are the highest branch of Mangs and that the others profess to despise them to punish the Dakalvars because they refused to touch the other Mangs. This story seems unlikely as Dakalvars eat the leavings of Mangs and Nade Mangs and no Mang will touch them. They are not allowed to drink water from a well or stream used by Mangs, but most take water from other Mangs. At the same time some sanctity or power attaches to the Dakalvars as no Mang will ever swear falsely by a Dakalvar. As a class Mangs are tall, some of them as much as six feet high, dark, and strongly made, and the white of their eyes is generally bloodshot. Most of the men wear the top-knot and the moustache, whiskers, and beard. Some men wear a tuft over each ear and no top-knot. They generally speak Marathi both at home and abroad. Sometimes among themselves at home they speak a language known as paroshi or out of use which is unintelligible to a Maratha stranger. Their Marathi\naccent and intonation are rough and coarse. They live by themselves in a quarter known as the M\u00e1ngv\u00e1da, separate from the Mh\u00e1rs, the hereditary rivals and enemies of their tribe. Their dwellings are generally thatched huts, though some own houses of the better sort with walls of earth and stone. The M\u00e1ng G\u00e1rudis or snake-charmers being a wandering class of jugglers have no fixed dwellings and live under a stretched canvas-like awning somewhat like a tent tied to pegs on the ground. They keep dogs and use donkeys and buffaloes as pack animals. The M\u00e1ngs too keep donkeys, buffaloes, cows, oxen, sheep, and goats. Their staple food is j\u00e9dri bread, vegetables, and pounded chillies, and they also eat the flesh of goats, sheep, dead cattle, and pork, but not of cows like the Mh\u00e1rs. On holidays they prepare dishes of gram cakes mixed with molasses. At caste feasts they drink kardai Carthamus tinctorius oil in large quantities, the feast costing 6s. to 8s. (Rs. 3-4) the hundred guests. They have one-fourth share in every head of cattle that dies, while the Mh\u00e1rs have three-fourths and besides own the skin and horns. Their dress is the same as that of their neighbours the Mh\u00e1rs. They are passionate, revengeful and cruel, as the common expression M\u00fang hridayi, or cruel hearted, shows. They are greatly feared as sorcerers, and are sturdy, fit for hardwork, and trusty village servants. They are hardworking, unthrifty, dirty, and fond of pleasure and drink. All classes of Hindus from the highest to the lowest employ M\u00e1ngs to punish an enemy by sending an evil spirit at him or else to overcome hostile charms, and, when some member of the family is possessed and does not speak, to find out and punish the witch that has possessed him. A mixture of chillies, part of a horse\u2019s leg or par near the knee, and hog\u2019s dung are burnt; and the face of the possessed person is held over the fumes. Then the spirit that is in the sick begins to speak through his mouth and tells who and what he is.\n\nMangs make thin cord or char\u00e1te of amb\u00e1da Hibiscus cannabinus or hemp and of kekti or Sweet Pandanus, ropes, date brooms, slings for hanging pots in, and also slings for throwing stones with, and bullock-yoke straps. They are carpenters, bricklayers, musicians, songsters, beggars, labourers, sellers of cowdung cakes grass and firewood, scavengers, and hangmen. Several of them are village watchmen and guides while others keep to their former trade of robbing and plundering. Like Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs and Mh\u00e1rs, Hol\u00e1rs make shoes, slippers, whips, water-bags, saddles, harness, and horses\u2019 grain-bags. Dakalv\u00e1rs breed peacocks and are astrologers, going about with calendars and Pur\u00e1ns. They beg only at the houses of M\u00e1ngs, because they say they have a claim on M\u00e1ngs who are their religious followers, and therefore they do not eat or drink with any other caste. M\u00e1ngs rank lowest among Hindus and will take food from any caste except Bhangis. M\u00e1ngs do not eat from the hands of twelve castes of which the only ones the Shol\u00e1pur M\u00e1ngs know are Ghadshis, Jingars, Mh\u00e1rs, and Buruds. They are not a religious people. Their chief deities are Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i, Jotiba, Khandoba, Mah\u00e1dev, Mariamma, and Yallamma. Their fasts and feasts do not differ from those of Mar\u00e1tha cultivators. Unlike Mh\u00e1rs, who\nuse the word Joh\u00e1r, that is Oh Warrior in saluting, M\u00e1ngs say Ph\u00e1rm\u00e1n probably the Persian pharm\u00e1n or command to their castefellows; to others they say Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j, at the same time passing the right palm to their forehead. A woman is held impure for five weeks after childbirth, but after the twelfth day she is touched, though nothing is eaten from her hands. On the twelfth the goddess Satv\u00e1i is worshipped and the child is put in a blanket-bag or jholi and named, the name being given by the village Br\u00e1hman who is paid \u00a7d. or \u00bc a. Female guests are asked and boiled gram or wheat is distributed among them. A month later new bangles are put round the mother\u2019s wrists. The boy\u2019s hair is cut at any time when he is between one and three years old and relations and friends are feasted. They marry their children very young, sometimes as babies, when the marriage ornaments or b\u00e1shings are tied to the cradle instead of to the brow. Their betrothals do not differ from Mh\u00e1r betrothals, the girl being presented with a bodice and robe worth 2s. to 10s. (Rs. 1-5), and clothes are exchanged between the two fathers. M\u00e1ng marriages take place during Vaish\u00e1kh and Jyeshth that is in April May and June, and on days when Br\u00e1hmans perform their marriages. Daily for five days before the marriage the girl is rubbed with turmeric at her house, and the rest is sent with music to the boy. On the afternoon of the third day at both houses a sheep is offered to the family god and slain in the marriage hall. In the evening the boy\u2019s paternal uncle cousin or brother with music and kinspeople goes to the temple of M\u00e1runi carrying a hatchet in his raised hands, four men hold a cloth over his head, and cooked food or naivedya is carried with them. At the temple the Gurav or ministrant has ready as devaks or marriage guardians, mango, j\u00e1mbhul Syzigium jambolanum, rui Calotropis gigantea, sondai properly saundad Prosopis spicegera, and umbar Ficus glomerata branches. The cooked food and a copper are laid before the guardians and they return with the devak and tie it to one of the posts in the marriage hall. After this the boy with kinspeople and music, goes either on a horse or a bullock to M\u00e1runi\u2019s shrine, when the girl\u2019s father meets him, and presents him with a waistloth and turban, which he puts on and is led to the girl\u2019s and seated in the marriage hall. Then two baskets are taken, hides and ropes are placed in them, and the boy and girl are seated face to face and a curtain is held between them. The village Br\u00e1hman, who acts as priest from a distance, repeats verses, and the guests who stand with rice grains in their hands throw them over the heads of the couple, and, when the verses are ended, they are husband and wife. Then they are made to stand side by side on the ground and are covered with the cloth which was held between them. Cotton thread is passed five times round them and divided into two pieces and one piece with a turmeric root is tied to the boy\u2019s right wrist and the other piece to the girl\u2019s left wrist. The couple are made to stand on an earthen altar or bahule and thrice\n\n---\n\n1 Some M\u00e1ngs instead of a hide place a grindstone in the girl\u2019s basket and a thick or thin rope in the boy\u2019s, instead of a cloth they hold up a quilt called jamnika, and instead of rice throw jv\u00e1ri.\nchange places. Their faces are rubbed with turmeric and the boy spends the night at the girl's sleeping with the other male guests in the marriage hall. The boy and girl play with betelnuts and beat each other's backs with twisted waistcloths. On the second and third the girl's parents feast the boy's and their own relations and caste fellows, and on the fourth the boy's father presents the girl with a bodice and robe and ties marriage ornaments to their brows. They are taken in procession to the village M\u00e1ruti and thence to the boy's house. Next day the couple are sent round the villagers' houses, and the marriage ceremony is at an end. During the month of Shr\u0101v\u00e1n or August the girl's parents carry presents of a robe and bodice, wheat flour, molasses, and pulse to the boy's and fetch their daughter to their house. M\u00e1ngs generally bury the dead. When any one dies fire is lit in the front part of the house and water heated over it in a new earthen jar, and the body is carried out of the house, bathed, and dressed in a waistcloth turban and coat; the body is then laid on a bier, redpowder and betel leaves are sprinkled over it, is raised on the shoulders of four men and carried to the burying ground, with a copper coin and some grains of rice tied to the hem of its garment. The chief mourner walks in front with an earthen firepot and his own turban under his armpit, and music, and the mourners follow. The musicians who belong to their own caste and play their pipes and drums are paid 3d. to 6d. (2-4 as.). On the way to the burying ground the bearers halt, but the firepot is not allowed to touch the ground lest it should become impure, and the copper coin in the shroud hem is thrown away. On reaching the burying ground a hole is dug and the body is lowered into the hole and laid on its back. The chief mourner dips the end of his turban in water, squeezes a little water into the dead mouth, and strikes his own mouth with his open hand that the gods may hear and open the gates of heaven, Svargi gh\u00e1t v\u00e1jte that is The bell of heaven rings. The grave is filled and the mourners bathe in a river or stream close by and return to the deceased's house each carrying some grass and nimb branches. At the house of mourning cow's urine is sprinkled on the spot where the dead breathed his last, and the grass and nimb leaves are thrown over the urine. The mourners return to their homes. On the third day the chief mourner with the four bearers and a kinsman or two go to the burial ground taking three jv\u00e1ri cakes, cooked rice and curds, or only milk if the dead is a child. They leave one of the cakes at the rest-place and the other two on the grave. They bathe, return to the deceased's house, and are sprinkled with cow's urine. The four corpse bearers sit in a line, and their shoulders are touched with nimb leaves dipped in sweet oil. They are then fed on jv\u00e1ri, molasses, oil, and s\u00e1nja or a mixture of wheat flour and sugar and clarified butter. The chief mourner is held impure for twelve days during which he is not touched. At the end of the twelve days a caste dinner is given when jv\u00e1ri bread and pulse are served. At night one of their own s\u00e1dhus or ascetics is called. He pours water from an earthen jar on the spot where the dead breathed his last, and the night is spent in reading sacred books or singing hymns in praise of the\ngods. They allow widow marriage and polygamy. They have a headman called *mhetrya* and settle social disputes at meetings of the leading members of the caste. They levy fines of 2s. 6d. to 10s. (Rs. 1\u00bd - 5) and spend the amount on a caste feast. Till the feast is given the offender is not allowed back into caste. They do not send their boys to school and are poor.\n\n*Mha'rs* are returned as numbering about 44,000 or 8\u00b716 per cent of the Hindu population and as found over the whole district. They are divided into \u00c1dvans, B\u00e1vans, Godvans, Kadvans or bastards, Soms, and Tilvans, who except the Kadvans all eat together and intermarry. Of these divisions the Soms, or Somvanshis, are the most numerous. Their surnames are J\u00e1dhav, Jugle, More, Shel\u00e1r, and Sarvgod. They are generally tall, strong, muscular, and dark, with regular features and low unintelligent foreheads. The men shave the head except the top-knot; some wear whiskers, all wear the moustache, and a few wear beards. The women wear their hair either in a braid, or in a knot, or loose. Their home speech is Mar\u00e1thi. They live outside of the village in untidy and ill-cared for houses of mud and stones with thatched or in rare cases flat mud roofs. Most of them live in huts with wattle and daub walls. Except a few of metal, their cooking and water vessels are made of earth. The well-to-do rear cattle, sheep, and fowls. Their daily food is millet bread, split pulse, and pounded chillies. They eat the leavings of other people, and when cattle and sheep die they feast on their carcasses. They do not eat pork. Mh\u00e1rs scorn M\u00e1ngs for eating the pig, and M\u00e1ngs scorn Mh\u00e1rs for eating the cow. They drink liquor and smoke tobacco and hemp flower. Their holiday dinners include rice cakes and a liquid preparation of molasses. Within the last ten years several Mh\u00e1rs have become Vaishnavs and given up flesh and liquor. A man's indoor dress is a loincloth, and, in rare cases, a jacket; his outdoor dress is the same, with, in addition, a white turban or a cap, and a blanket. Both indoors and out of doors women wear the ordinary Mar\u00e1tha robe, generally red or black, and a bodice, and children of both sexes under seven or eight and sometimes up to ten, go naked. Except that it is somewhat richer, the Mh\u00e1r's ceremonial dress is the same as their outdoor dress. Their clothes are country-made and are bought in the local markets. Both men and women spend 8s. to 10s. a year on clothes. The women wear glass and lac bangles, brass earrings, a necklace of black glass beads, a black silk neck-cord or *n\u00e1da*, and silver finger and toe rings. The men formerly wore a black thread round their neck, but many of them have of late given up the practice. They carry in their hands a thick staff about four feet long and with one end adorned with bells. They are fairly hardworking and hospitable to their castefellows, but they are dishonest, intemperate, gluttonous, hot-tempered, mischievous when they have a quarrel, and occasionally given to petty gang robberies. *Mharj\u00e1ticha* or Mh\u00e1r-natured is a proverbial term for a cruel man. They are village servants and are authorities in boundary matters; they carry Government treasure, escort travellers, call landholders to pay the land assessment at the village office, and remove dead animals. Most of them enjoy a small Government payment partly in cash and partly\nin land, and they occasionally receive presents of grain from the village landholders. They do watchman's work by turns, and the man in office is called veskar that is gatekeeper. He goes about begging food from the villagers, skins dead cattle, and sells the skins and horns. Besides as watchman and boundary referee he is useful to the villagers by taking wood and cowdung cakes to the burning ground or by digging the grave when a villager dies, and carrying the news of his death to his kinspeople in neighbouring villages. Some are husbandmen, labourers, street and yard sweepers, and others gather wood and cowdung and cut grass. The Mh\u00e1r prepares the threshing floor or khale at harvest time and watches the corn day and night before it is stored in a grain pit or pev. He formerly received a sixteenth to a twentieth of the produce of the land as the grain allowance or balute, the corn that falls on the ground at the foot of every stalk, and a bodice and robe or a headscarf at every marriage at a landholder's house. They are a poverty-stricken class, barely able to maintain themselves, and often living on the refuse of food thrown into the streets. They hold a low position among Hindus and are both hated and feared. Except in Pandharpur, their touch, even the touch of their shadow, is thought to defile. In Pandharpur Mh\u00e1rs mix freely with other castes, Br\u00e1hmans and Mh\u00e1rs bringing their supplies from the same shop and drinking water from the same pool. Formerly an earthen pot was hung from their necks to hold their spittle, they were made to drag thorns to wipe out their footsteps, and when a Br\u00e1hman came near had to lie far off on their faces lest their shadows might fall on him. Even now, a Mh\u00e1r is not allowed to talk loudly in the street while a well-to-do Br\u00e1hman or his wife is dining in one of the houses. Mh\u00e1rs are Shaivs and Vaishnavs and worshippers of goddesses. Most of them are Vaishnavs and worship Bhav\u00e1ni of Tulj\u00e1pur, Chokhoba, Jny\u00e1noba of \u00c1landi, Khandoba of Jejuri, and Vithoba. They also worship the usual Hindu gods and goddesses and Musalm\u00e1n saints especially the ancestral Cobra or N\u00e1goba, the small-pox goddess Satv\u00e1i, and the cholera goddess Mari\u00e1 whose shrines are found in all Mh\u00e1r quarters. They go on pilgrimage to most of the places mentioned above as well as to the shrine of Shambhu Mah\u00e1dev in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Their religious teachers are Mh\u00e1r gurus and s\u00e1dhus or gos\u00e1vis. They have also Mh\u00e1r v\u00e1chaks or readers, who read and explain their sacred books, the Bhaktivijay, D\u00e1sbodh, Jny\u00e1neshvari, Harivijay, R\u00e1mvijay, Santlila, and the poems of Jy\u00e1noba, Tukoba, and others. The readers also preach, and repeat marriage verses when a Br\u00e1hman is not available. The gurus, s\u00e1dhus, v\u00e1chaks and Mh\u00e1r gos\u00e1vis all belong to the Mh\u00e1r caste and some of them are very fluent preachers and expounders of the Pur\u00e1ns. Any one of these lecturers who maintains himself by begging may become a guru or teacher. Every Mh\u00e1r both among men and among women has a guru; if they have no guru they are not allowed to dine in the same line with the s\u00e1dhus. A child is first brought to be taught by its guru when it is about a year old. The rite is called k\u00e1nshr\u00e1vni or ear-whispering and more commonly k\u00e1nphukne or ear-blowing. About seven or eight at night the parents take the child in their arms and go to the teacher's\nhouse, carrying frankincense, camphor, red and scented powders, flowers, betelnut and leaves, a cocoanut, dry dates, and sugar. In the teacher's house a room is cowdunged and a square is traced with white quartz powder. At each corner of the square a lighted lamp is set, and, in the middle, on a wooden plank or on a low wooden stool, is a metal pot or ghat filled with cold water. Another board or stool is set facing the square and the teacher sits on it cross-legged. He sets flowers, sandal paste, and rice on the waterpot and takes the child in his lap resting its head on his right knee. He shrouds himself and the child in a blanket or a waistcloth, mutters the sacred verse into the child's right ear, pulls off the blanket, and hands the child to its parents. The priest is presented with 3d. to 2s. (Re. \u00bd-1), and, if they are well-to-do, the parents give him a waistcloth, one or two metal water vessels and a plate. A feast is given to the teacher and a few near relations, or if the parents cannot afford a feast, sugar is handed round. After the dinner the parents retire with the child.\n\nWhen cholera rages in a village the people raise a subscription and hand the money to the headman. The headman brings a robe and a bodice, some rice and flour, a he-buffalo or a sheep, and flowers, camphor, frankincense, redpowder, and betelnut and leaves. He takes three carts, fills one with cooked rice, a second with cakes, and in the third places the other articles of worship, and, leading the he-buffalo, takes the carts through the village accompanied by music and a band of the villagers. The carts then go to the Mh\u00e1rs' quarters outside of the village, where is the shrine of Mari\u00e1 the cholera goddess. The headman and the other villagers stand at a distance, while a Mh\u00e1r bathes the goddess, dresses her in the robe and bodice, fills her lap with rice, betelnuts, dry dates, and a cocoanut, waves burning frankincense and camphor before her, and with joined hands begs her to be kind. All the villagers lift their joined hands to their heads, and ask the goddess to be kind, and retire leaving the Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs. The buffalo is led in front of the goddess and a Mh\u00e1r chops off its head with a sword or a hatchet, and touches the goddess' lap with a finger dipped in its blood. The cart-loads of food and meat are shown to the goddess and are distributed among such of the villagers as do no object to eat them. This concludes the sacrifice. They say that the goddess truly partakes of the sacrifice, as the food and meat become insipid and tasteless. The Mh\u00e1r's priests are village Br\u00e1hmans who do not object to act as priests at their marriages and other ceremonies. In their daily worship Mh\u00e1rs do not require the help of Br\u00e1hmans. The office of religious teacher or guru is hereditary. They believe in sorcery witchcraft and soothsaying. They have many spirit-scarers or exorcists among them some of whom are Gos\u00e1vis who have been devoted to the service of the gods since they were born, and the rest are potras or devotees of Lakshmi, who cover their brows with redpowder and carry a whip with which they lash their bodies while they beg singing and dancing. They fast on Mondays and on the eleventh of each half of every lunar month. Recent changes in religious views are confined to the V\u00e1rkaripanth or timekeeping sect. After the birth of a child the mother is held impure for twelve days, during which she keeps aloof from everyone except the\nmidwife. On the third day a ceremony called *tirvi* is performed, when five little unmarried girls are feasted on millet or *karri* made into lumps and eaten with a mixture of milk and molasses, or sugar, or with curds and buttermilk. On the fifth or *p\u00e1nohvi* day five stone pebbles are laid in a line in the house and worshipped by the midwife and millet is offered. On the sixth or *satvi* day the hole made for the bathing water in the mother's room is filled, levelled, cowdunged, and sprinkled with turmeric and redpowder and flowers, and wheatcakes are laid before it. On the twelfth day the *b\u00e1rav\u00ed* or twelfth day ceremony is performed, when the whole house is cowdunged and seven pebbles are laid outside of the house, worshipped by the mother, and presented with wheat bread. Five married women are feasted. Between the thirteenth and any time within about two months, the boy's father goes to the village astrologer, gives him the time of the child's birth, and asks him whether the moment of birth was a lucky moment. The Br\u00e1hman tells him to offer a cocoanut to the village M\u00e1rti or some other village god, and to pour a copper's worth of oil on him. The father asks for a name for the child, the astrologer looks up his almanac and tells him. The father goes home and tells the women of the house what name the priest has given. In the evening married women are called, a spot is cowdunged, a drawing is traced with white quartz powder, and the cradle is set in the tracing. The mother brings the child and lays it in the cradle, in a loud voice calls it by the name chosen by the astrologer, and putting her mouth to the child's right ear says *kur-r-r*. If the astrologer's name is not to the mother's liking she calls the child by another name, and the women sing songs. A handful of millet, a little sugar, and betel are served and the guests retire. When the child is a year old, if it is a boy, the hair-cutting or *j\u00e1val* is performed. The child is taken to the shrine of the goddess Satv\u00e1i, and his hair is either clipped or shaved by one of the family who leaves a few hairs on the crown. The goddess is worshipped, a few hairs are laid before her, and she is offered wheat bread and cooked rice. There is no other ceremony till marriage.\n\nMh\u00e1rs marry their girls sometimes when they are infants and always before they come of age, and their boys sometimes before they are twelve and seldom after they are twenty. They have no rules forcing them to marry their girls before they come of age. Among them the *m\u00e1gni* or asking the girl's parents to give their daughter in marriage is the same as among Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. About a week before, the village Br\u00e1hman is asked whether there is anything in the names of the boy and girl to prevent their marrying. He consults his almanac and says there is no objection. He is then asked to fix a lucky moment for the marriage and for the turmeric rubbing. He again consults his almanac and tells them the days and gives them a few grains of rice which he blesses in the name of Ganpati. Each of the fathers gives the Br\u00e1hman a copper for his trouble. For four days before the marriage the parents both of the boy and of the girl rub them with turmeric powder, and branches of five trees or *p\u00e1nchp\u00e1lvis* are worshipped as the marriage guardian or *devak*. On the marriage day the boy, with kinspeople friends and music, goes to the girl's\nsometimes on horseback and generally on an ox. On reaching the girl's house, the girl's brother or some other near kinsman leads the boy into the house and seats him on a blanket. The girl is brought by her sister or some other kinswoman and seated on the blanket beside the boy. The guests of both houses feast at the girl's where a sheep has been killed in the morning. The boy is presented with a turban, a waist-cloth, a shouldercloth, and a pair of shoes. He dresses in the new clothes and takes his stand on a wooden stool near the blanket. The girl stands on another stool facing him, and each of them holds a roll of betelnut and leaves in both hands. A cloth is held between them, the boy and girl stretch out the tips of their fingers till they touch on either side of the cloth or below the cloth and the village priest from some distance, or if not one of their own holy men repeats marriage verses. When the last verse is over the guests throw over the couple's head rice mixed with the rice which the Br\u00e1hman astrologer gave the fathers at the time of settling the marriage day. The cloth is pulled on one side and five persons hold it over the pair's heads. To the hems of the pair's garments are tied rice, turmeric roots, and betelnut, and they are seated on the altar or bahule. Cotton thread is passed five times round the fingers of the five cloth holders, and again four times, and each of the two windings is made into a string about a cubit long, and the string of five turns, with a turmeric root and a betelnut tied to it, is wound round the boy's right wrist and the string of four turns round the girl's right wrist. Then a married man repeats his wife's name and unties the knot that fastens together the hems of the boy's and girl's garments. Kinswomen and the bride's and bridegroom's maids or karavlis wave lighted lamps round the couple's faces. Each of the fathers pays the Br\u00e1hman 3d. (2 as.) and gives him a cocoanut, sugar, and betel. For four days, including the marriage day, the boy stays at the girl's and feasts are held. On the evening of the fifth comes the s\u00e1da or robe ceremony when the boy's father presents the girl with a robe and bodice, a necklace of black glass beads with a gold bead in the centre, glass bangles, and silver toe-rings. The boy and girl are seated on the laps of their maternal uncles and bite the ends off betel leaf rolls, and a piece of cocoa kernel is hung between them from a black thread. At night a procession is formed and the boy and girl are seated on an ox and paraded through the village with kinspeople, music, and dancing. The marriage is over and the guests go home. Either on Sankr\u00e1n Day the twelfth of January, or on N\u00e1gpanchmi in July-August comes the vasa or home-taking, when the boy with his parents and kinspeople goes to the girl's, taking a robe and bodice, a measure of wheat flour, pulse, and clarified butter and molasses. At the girl's they are feasted, and, after the feast, take the girl back with them to the boy's house. When a Mh\u00e1r girl comes of age she sits five days by herself. At the end of the fifth day she is presented with a white robe and bodice and the caste is feasted. They allow and practise widow marriage and polygamy. Mh\u00e1rs generally bury the dead. After death the relations weep over the dead, lay his body on the threshold of the house, and throw over him warm water heated in a new earthen jar. The\nbody is shrouded in a new cloth, laid on the bier, and sprinkled with redpowder and betel leaves, and grains of rice are tied to one of the hems of the cloth. The body is carried to burial on the shoulders of four near kinsmen who as they pass say R\u00e1m R\u00e1m in a low voice. The chief mourner walks in front with fire in the new earthen jar and music if he has the means. The mourners follow. On the way to the grave the party halts, the rice from the hem of the deceased\u2019s robe is laid on the ground, and five pebbles are set on the rice. When they reach the burial ground, a pit five feet deep is dug, and the body is stripped of all its clothing, even the loincloth, according to the saying, Naked hast thou come and naked shalt thou go. It is lowered into the grave and laid on its back. The chief mourner scatters a handful of earth on the body, the rest also scatter earth, and the grave is filled. The chief mourner fills the firepot with water, sets it on his shoulder, and goes thrice round the grave crying aloud and striking his open mouth with the palm of his right hand. At the end of the third turn he pours water from the jar on the grave and dashes the jar to pieces on the ground. All bathe in running water, and go to the mourner\u2019s house each carrying a nimb branch. At the house an earthen pot of cow\u2019s urine is set on the spot where the dead breathed his last, the mourners dip the nimb branches into the urine, sprinkle it over their heads and bodies, and go to their homes. On the third day a few of the deceased\u2019s kinsmen go to the burial ground, the chief mourner carrying in his hands a winnowing fan with two pieces of cocoa-kernel and some molasses in each piece. At the rest-place, where the bearers halted, they lay a piece of cocoa-kernel with molasses on it under the five stones. The other piece is laid on the heaped grave. They beat the grave down to the level of the rest of the ground, bathe, and go to the chief mourner\u2019s house. The four bearers are seated in a line on the bare ground in the front room of the house. Each holds a nimb branch under his arm, the chief mourner drops a little molasses into his mouth, and they go to their homes. On the seventh day a bread and vegetable caste feast is given. Like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s Mh\u00e1rs keep the death-day, when crows are fed with rice and a dish of molasses. They settle social disputes either by a council or panch\u00e1yat composed of the foremost members of the caste, under the hereditary headman called p\u00e1til, or by a caste-meeting. Caste decisions are enforced by forbidding the caste people to smoke or drink water with the offender, or by exacting a fine of 6d. to 10s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) which is spent on drink. Mh\u00e1rs sometimes send their boys to school, but they never take to new pursuits. They are a poor people.\n\nBeggars include thirteen classes with a strength of 8979 or 1\u00b75 per cent of the Hindu population.

Of the children some of the girls become prostitutes and others marry the boys belonging to the order. When such marriages take place boys marry between sixteen and twenty, and girls between twelve and fourteen. Their women keep by themselves during their monthly sickness. They bury the dead, dressing the body in an ochre cloth, and burying it sitting with a quantity of salt, and, on the head, bel leaves if the dead was a Shaiv, or tulsi leaves if a Vaishnav. They never mourn the dead. Their only funeral service is on the thirteenth a feast to castefellows including the four corpse-bearers. They allow widow marriage. They have a headman. In cases of disputes they go to Allahabad, Benares, Dvarka, or other places where their people gather and settle the disputes according to the opinion of the majority. Those who are traders send their boys to school for a short time, but as a rule Gosavis live from hand to mouth and are the most wretched class in the district.\n\nJangams, or Lingayat Priests, are returned as numbering 3828 and as found in small numbers over the whole district. Almost all have come north from the Kanarese country. The men wear the moustache and top-knot but not the beard. Their home tongue is Marathi. Their houses are either of earth and stone, with tiled or flat roofs, or thatched huts, and they have copper and brass vessels, wooden stools, and bedding, and own cattle and ponies. They neither eat flesh nor drink liquor. Their staple food is jvari split pulse and vegetables. They eat from separate plates, which they lay on low wooden stools called adnis, and are careful not only to eat every scrap but to wash the plate and drink the washings. Their caste feasts of gram cakes cost about \u00a32 (Rs. 20) the hundred guests, and those of sweet milk \u00a31 (Rs. 10). The men wear a waistcloth, a waistcoat, a cloth rolled round the head or a Brahman turban, and shoes; and the women wear the robe and bodice. Both men and women wear a ling in a small box or shrine hung round the neck, bound round the upper right arm, or hid in the folds of the headcloth. Jangams are clean, sober, thrifty, even-tempered, hardworking, and hospitable. They are traders and shopkeepers, selling both by retail and wholesale. They sell almonds, sugarcandy, spices, cocoanuts, oil, butter, molasses, and drugs, and also beg. Their chief god is Mahadev, and they fast on Mondays Tuesdays and Thursdays as well as on Ekadashis or all lunar elevenths and observe the usual Hindu holidays. After the birth of a child the family remains impure.\nfor five days. On the fifth evening they offer dough cakes to the goddess Satvai. They name the child, if a girl on the twelfth and if a boy on the thirteenth. Either on the fifth or twelfth a ling is brought by a Jangam and tied round the child\u2019s arm hung from its neck, or laid under its pillow. The Jangam is feasted and sent away with a few coppers. Their boys\u2019 heads are shaved for the first time when they are six months or a year old. They do not gird their boys with the sacred thread, and they marry their girls between ten and twelve and their boys between twelve and twenty. They rub them with turmeric daily for five days before the wedding and marry them on a lucky day fixed by the village astrologer. Their marriage guardian is a bunch of mango and jambhul Syzygium jambolanum leaves, tied to a post in the marriage hall. Their priests are Maratha Brahmins who repeat marriage verses and throw rice over the heads of the boy and girl. Feasts are held for five days, and at the end the boy takes the girl with him, and visits the village Maruti, and goes straight with his wife and relations to his village. After a week or ten days the girl returns to her parents.\n\nOn Sankrant Day in January the boy\u2019s people send a present of a robe and bodice to the girl. They allow widow marriage and bury the dead. When a person dies redpowder is rubbed on his face, and he is carried to the burying ground in a blanket hung from a pole which is carried on two men\u2019s shoulders. On the spot where the dead breathed his last, a pot full of water is laid, and the mourners when they return from the burial ground bring in their hands a few blades of grass, throw them on the pot, rub their brows with ashes, and return to their homes. On the third day the whole house is cowdunged, clothes are washed, and the impurity is at an end. The chief mourner takes a cup of milk, and with friends and kinsmen, goes to the burying ground and pours the milk on the grave. On their return to the house of mourning a milk party is held, and a shraddh or mind-rite is performed at the close of the year. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They fine offenders \u00a31 to \u00a32 (Rs.10-20) and spend the amount on a caste feast. They send their boys to school till they can read and write a little, and cast accounts. They are a steady class, neither falling nor rising.\n\nJoharis are returned as numbering thirty-eight, and as found in the towns of Pandharpur and Sholapur. They are said to have come into the district from Northern India during the times of the Peshwa. About twenty families numbering in all one hundred and twenty-five came in search of work and settled near Sholapur.

They sell pearls, corals, diamonds and other precious stones, and glass beads. They buy old gold and silver lace and embroidered clothes, burn them, and extract the gold and silver. Their women keep small haberdashery shops selling wooden and tin boxes, combs, glass beads of different sizes and colours, needles, thread, buttons, marbles, looking glasses, tops, whistles, dolls, and small brass cups and dishes. They worship Khandoba, Mah\u00e1dev, Satv\u00e1\u00ed, Vithoba, Vyankatesh, and Yallamma and other Hindu deities, and keep Sundays, Gokulashtami in August, and Shiv\u00e1tra in February as fast days. Their priests are Kanat\u00fa Br\u00e1hmans, and in their absence the ordinary Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans officiate at their houses. Women are impure for ten days after childbirth. They worship the goddess Sati on the fifth day, and name the child on the twelfth. A few wear the sacred thread and generally marry their girls before they come of age. At the time of marriage date leaves are tied to the brows of the boy and girl as marriage ornaments, and they are made to stand on wooden stools, face to face, and, after repeating marriage verses and throwing rice grains, they are husband and wife. The priest kindles the sacred fire and the boy feeds it with parched grain. Feasts are interchanged, and, followed by kinsmen friends and music, the boy starts with his bride for his home either on foot or on horseback. They do not allow widow marriage and practise polygamy. They burn the dead and mourn ten days, feed crows, and offer rice balls in the name of the deceased, the deceased\u2019s father, and the deceased\u2019s grandfather. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school for a short time, and are a steady class.\n\nKolha\u2019tis or Domba\u2019ris, Rope Dancers and Tumblers, are returned as numbering 161 and as found scattered in towns and large villages. They have no subdivisions and their surnames are Andh\u00e1re, J\u00e1dhav, Pav\u00e1r, and S\u00e1nkeshvar, who eat together and intermarry. According to their story the founder of their class was a man who was named Nat or dancer and nicknamed Kola, born of a Teli father by a Kshatriya mother. They have no tradition about coming into the district or of any former home. Their chief settlement in the district is at M\u00e1nkeshvar in B\u00e1rsi. They are active and dark. The men wear the topknot, moustache, and whiskers, and a few the beard. Their home speech is a mixture of Mar\u00e1thi and Gujar\u00e1ti. They are a wandering tribe of tumblers and rope dancers. They are of bad character; the women are prostitutes, and all when they get the chance steal and kidnap girls. They are under the eye of the police. They make the small buffalo horn pulleys which are used with cart ropes in fastening loads. They also make hide combs and gunpowder flasks.

Their holiday dishes are gram cakes, the flesh of goats and sheep, and liquor. They are a wandering people. Except during the rains when they generally live outside of villages, they have no fixed settlements and move from village to\nvillage carrying low mat huts with them. They keep donkeys and ponies which they use in travelling from place to place and generally have a watch dog. The men dress in a pair of short drawers, a jacket, and a tattered turban, and sometimes a pair of wristlets and a gold earring. The women wear a long rich robe worth about \u00a31 or \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 10 - 12) and a tight-fitting bodice worth Is. 6d. (12 as.) and have gold silver and brass ornaments.\n\nOn the fifth day after the birth of a child the mother is washed, the goddess Satvai is worshipped, and either wet gram or wheat is served to women guests and children. On the thirteenth the child is named by the village Br\u00e1hman. The mother keeps by herself for a month, and when the child, if it is a boy, is a year or two old its hair is clipped, a sheep is killed, and the caste are feasted. As the boy\u2019s father has to pay the girl\u2019s father a dowry of \u00a310 to \u00a320 (Rs. 100-200), two families, if they can, make a double marriage and so avoid the expense. Two or three days before marriage a sheep is offered to the village god and the caste are feasted. Next day a marriage hall is built, two earthen pots are whitewashed and worshipped, and a bunch of mango leaves is tied to a post in the marriage hall called their guardian devk\u00e1rya or devak. The boy and girl are rubbed with turmeric at their homes and bathed by kinswomen who sing songs.

No dinner is given, but large quantities of liquor are drunk. The women dance and sing the whole night. Next day the fathers knot the hems of their clothes together, and taking the boy and girl on their shoulders, carry them to the village M\u00e1ruti before whom they bow. They are then taken to the boy\u2019s house, where the hems of the fathers\u2019 garments are untied and the boy and girl call each other by their names. A large feast is held, and quantities of flesh and liquor are taken. When a girl comes of age she is called to choose between marriage and prostitution. If with her parents\u2019 consent she wishes to lead a married life, she is well taken care of and carefully watched. If she chooses to be a tumbler and a prostitute, she is taken before the caste council, a feast is given, and with the consent of the council, she is declared a prostitute. The prostitutes are not allowed to eat with other Kolh\u00e1tis except with their own children. Still when they grow old their castefellows support them. They bury the dead, carrying the body sitting slung from a pole on the shoulders of four men. On the third day funeral ceremonies are performed, and a dish of rice, split pulse, salt, and oil is prepared. Six months after the caste is feasted on wheat bread and split pulse. They worship Amb\u00e1bhav\u00e1ni, Hanum\u00e1u, Khandoba, and the cholera goddess Mari\u00e1i, but their favourite, and, as they say their only living gods are the bread-winners or hunger-scarers the drum, the rope, and the balancing pole. They do not send their boys to school and are a falling class.\n\nKudbuda Joshis, or Kudbud-playing Astrologers, are returned as numbering 735 and as found wandering over the whole district.\nThey occasionally come to the district from the Konkan and are a class of Mar\u00e1tha astrologers and beggars who wander playing on an hourglass-shaped drum called the kudbud. Their surnames are Bhosle, Chavh\u00e1n, J\u00e1dhav, and Pov\u00e1r; and families of all these surnames eat together and intermarry.

They eat flesh and drink liquor and their staple food is ju\u00e1ri, vegetables, and pounded chillies, and they also eat the leavings from Br\u00e1hmans\u2019 leaf-plates. The men generally wear a white turban and rather a long coat, a waistcloth, and mark their brows with white sandal. Their women dress like Mar\u00e1tha women, and except glass bangles have few ornaments. They wander from house to house and village to village beating a drum. They know how to read and write, foretell events by referring to a Mar\u00e1thi calendar which they carry rolled in their turbans, and tell fortunes from lines on the hands. Their women remain impure for twelve days after childbirth. On the fifth day the goddess Satv\u00e1i is worshipped and a feast of wheat bread and pulse is given. On the twelfth day the child is cradled and named, and five married women are rubbed with turmeric and redpowder and worshipped. The guests are offered boiled wheat or gram and go to their homes. Four to six months after, if the child is a boy, except some left as a top-knot his hair is clipped. Among Kudbud\u00e1s marriage is preceded by betrothal, the girl is presented with a robe and bodice, her brow is rubbed with redpowder, and feasts are given. On the marriage day the guardian or devak, which is the leaves of five trees or p\u00e1nchp\u00e1lvis, is tied to a post of the booth along with a hatchet, two wheat cakes, and an earthen lighted lamp. A sheep is offered to the guardian and the caste is feasted. The boy and girl are rubbed with turmeric at their homes, and the boy goes on horseback to the girl\u2019s, where both the boy and girl are made to stand in bamboo baskets half full of rice and a curtain is held between them. The Br\u00e1hman priest hands red rice to all the guests, and chants marriage verses, and at the end along with other guests throws grains of rice over the couple\u2019s heads and the boy and girl are husband and wife. Kudbud\u00e1s allow widow marriage and practise polygamy. They bury their dead, the body being slung from a pole carried on the shoulders of two men. On the third day wheat bread, rice, and milk are laid on the spot where the dead was buried. They mourn the dead ten days and feast castefellows on the twelfth. Their chief deities are Amb\u00e1bhav\u00e1ni, Bahiroba, and Shidoba. Their priests are Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans to whom they pay great respect. They have no headman, but have a caste council which punishes all breaches of caste rule by fines varying from 1s. to 2s. (Re.\u00bd-1). They send their boys to school till they can read and write a little. They are a poor class.\n\nVa\u2019ghy\u00e1s and Murl\u00eds.\n\nVa\u2019ghya\u2019s are returned as numbering thirty-two and as found in the larger towns. They are divided into Mar\u00e1tha, Dhangar and Mh\u00e1r V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s, of whom the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the Dhangars eat together but do not intermarry. The surnames of the Mar\u00e1tha V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s are Chavh\u00e1n, Dh\u00e1igude, J\u00e1dhav, Kare, and Sinde. Like Murl\u00eds, V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s are children of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Dhangars, and Mh\u00e1rs whose parents have\nvowed them to the service of the god Khandoba. Both boys and girls are devoted as V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s; only girls become Murlis. V\u00e1ghya boys and girls can marry; a Murli cannot marry as she is Khandoba's bride. V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s generally marry into their father's caste, but there is no objection to the intermarriage of a V\u00e1ghya boy and a V\u00e1ghya girl. Their children are V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s and marry with their father's caste. The child is always dedicated in Khandoba's temple at Jejuri in Poona on any day in the month of Chaitra or April-May. When parents have to dedicate a boy to Khandoba they go to Jejuri, stay at a Gurav's house, and tell him the object of their visit. The boy's father buys turmeric, dry cocoa-kernel, a cocoanut, some milk, curds, honey, sugar, a flower garland, and a nosegay, some sandalpaste, and a turban and sash. Then taking the boy, the Gurav, V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s, and Murlis go in procession with music to Khandoba's temple. At the temple the Gurav bathes and worships the god offering him the turban and sash and 2s. to \u00a31 (Rs.1-10) in cash. He then marks the boy's brow with turmeric, throws turmeric over his head, fastens round his neck a deer or tiger skin wallet hung from a black woollen string and thrice throws turmeric and dry cocoa-kernel over the god, twice repeating the words Elkot ghe, that is O! Elkottake. All who are present in turn throw turmeric on the god and the ceremony is over. The Gurav is paid 10s. (Rs. 5) as his fee and 2s. 6d. (Rs.1\u00bd) as the price of the wallet and each of the V\u00e1ghya and Murli guests is presented with a copper. When the parents return home cooked food is offered to the house Khandoba and a feast is held costing 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs.5-10) the hundred guests. V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s are considered Khandoba's disciples, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and other middle and low caste Hindus bow down to them. They have to go to Jejuri once every three years. They beg loitering in the streets ringing small bells in their left hand, singing, and rubbing turmeric on the brows of passers-by. Sometimes a Murli goes with them. If the Murli is clever and goodlooking the people give, otherwise V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s get little. Their religious, ceremonial, and social observances are the same as those of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They are a falling people.\n\nMurlis, literally Flutes as if instruments on which the god may play, are returned as numbering thirty-one and as found over the whole district. They are divided into Mar\u00e1tha and Mh\u00e1r Murlis. The following details apply to Mar\u00e1tha Murlis. They are like Mar\u00e1tha women most of them plain and somewhat harsh-featured, many of them pleasant-looking, and some of them handsome. Their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi and their houses are of the better sort with metal and earthen vessels and cattle. They keep V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s in their houses to dance, to take care of them, and as servants. They eat fish and flesh and are fond of liquor. They wear a flowing robe and a tight-fitting bodice; they mark their brows with red and turmeric powder, and wear gold and silver ornaments. Their special ornament is a necklace of nine cowry shells. They are clean neat and hospitable, but idle dishonest and given to drink. They are prostitutes and beggars, singing and dancing with bells in their hands. They generally go with two or three V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s who beat small drums or dafris. The V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s dance and if the Murli is handsome the entertainment is popular. The Murli\nsings songs generally indecent in praise of Khandoba, while singing she suddenly seats herself in the lap of one of the listeners, kisses him, and will not go till she is paid in silver. Murlis like V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s are generally children whose parents have vowed them to Khandoba's service. Others are married women who leave their husbands and even their children, saying they have made a vow to Khandoba, or who are warned in a dream that they should be the brides of Khandoba not of men. Middle and low class Hindus respect and bow before the true Murli who was wedded to the god as a girl; they look down on women who leave their husbands and children to play the Murli. Girls whose parents have vowed them to Khandoba are married to the god between one and twelve and always before they come of age. When she is to be married to Khandoba her parents take the girl to Jejuri some time in Chaitra or April-May. They bring turmeric, dry cocoa-kernel, flower garlands, nosegays, a robe and bodice, a sash, turban, milk, curds, sugar, butter, honey, and flowers, and, with a Gurav priest and a band of V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s, Murlis, and musicians go to the temple. At the temple the girl is bathed, the god is rubbed with turmeric and the rest of the turmeric is rubbed on the girl. The girl is dressed in the new robe and bodice, green glass bangles are put round her wrists, and flower marriage ornaments or mund\u00e1valas are tied to her brow. The god is worshipped, the turban and sash are presented to him, and the Gurav, taking in his hands a necklace or g\u00e1tha of nine cowrie shells, fastens it round the girl's neck. This is called the g\u00e1tha phodna or breaking cowrie necklace, and the Gurav is paid 2s. 6d. (Rs.1\u00bd) as the price of the necklace. The girl is made to stand to the left of the god and the guests throw turmeric over the god-bridegroom and the bride crying out twice Elkot ghe, Elkot ghe, Elkot take, Elkot take. Her parents give the Gurav who acts as priest 10s. (Rs. 5), and each V\u00e1ghya and Murli who is present receives a copper. The bride and her parents retire and at their house give a feast to Murlis and V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s. When a Murli comes of age she sits by herself for four days. Then she looks for a patron. When she succeeds in finding a patron, she calls a meeting of her brethren the V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s, and, in their presence, the patron says I will fill the Murli's lap, Hichi oti mi bharin. The V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s ask him what he will pay, and after some haggling a sum of \u00a32 10s. to \u00a310 (Rs. 25-100) is fixed. If the sum is \u00a35 (Rs. 50) or over, half of the money goes to the V\u00e1ghya-Murli community who spend it in caste vessels and in feasts. With the balance the girl buys a robe and bodice for herself, and bedding. She sets up a bamboo frame, puts green bangles on her wrists, and, dressing in the new clothes sits in the frame and has her lap filled by Murlis or if there are no Murlis by married women. She is taken to the village M\u00e1runi with Murlis, V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s, and music, presents the god with a copper and a betel packet, returns home, and feasts her caste fellows. She lives with her patron fifteen days to a month, and afterwards, if he wishes to keep her, he settles with her at 16s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 8-12) a month. Murlis have house images, generally of Bahiroba, Bhav\u00e1ni, Jotiba, Khandoba, and Satv\u00e1i. Their priests are ordinary Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. They keep the usual Hindu\nfasts and feasts and settle social disputes at meetings of V\u00e1ghy\u00e1s. They send their boys and girls to school and if not a rising are a steady class.\n\nVa'sudevs are returned as numbering seventy-five and as found over the whole district. They are dark tall and regular-featured, they speak Mar\u00e1thi, and their houses are the same as Mar\u00e1tha houses. They own cattle and goats and eat fish, fowls, and the flesh of goats, sheep, hare, and deer, and they say they used to eat the wild hog. They dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the women wearing the robe without tucking the skirt behind. The men beg dressed in a long crown-like hat with a brass top and surrounded with peacock feathers, a long white coat, and trousers. They dance and sing while begging, playing on several musical instruments, and blowing a whistle. They train their boys from infancy and by fifteen they are expert dancers and singers. Their house deities are Bahiroba, Bhav\u00e1ni, Jotiba, and Khandoba, and their priests are ordinary Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. Their women are impure for seven days after childbirth. On the evening of the seventh they worship the village Satv\u00e1i and become pure. They name their children on the twelfth and their marriage and death customs are the same as Mar\u00e1tha customs. They allow widow marriage, hold caste meetings, do not send their boys to school, and are a steady class.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns returned at 43,949 or 7\u00b754 per cent of the population are found all over the district. They include forty-three subdivisions, seventeen of which, all with a foreign element marry together and form the main body of regular Musalm\u00e1ns, and twenty-six of local and apparently unmixed Hindu origin form distinct communities. The foreign element includes strains of Arab, Abyssinian, Persian, Moghal, and Upper and South Indian blood. It dates from the early spread of Isl\u00e1m probably as far back as the eighth century after Christ. Under the R\u00e1shtrakutas of M\u00e1lkhed\u00b9 (760-978) considerable numbers of Arabs, coming as horse dealers and adventurers were persuaded to take service and settle in the country.\u00b2 The employment of foreign mercenaries under the Hindu chiefs seems to have become general, and, by the end of the thirteenth century, the practice of engaging men from the west and from the north was usual. Besides traders and soldiers, from the earliest times (640) Arab missionaries found their way into the Deccan and spread Isl\u00e1m among its Hindu inhabitants. According to a Hindn tale, a large body of Momins or cotton weavers were converted in the thirteenth century by an Arab missionary Khw\u00e1ja Syed Husein Gaisudar\u00e1z, better known as Khw\u00e1ja Mukd\u00e1m Gesudar\u00e1z of Gulburga. The conquest of the Deccan at the close of the thirteenth century (A.D. 1294), and, a few years later, Muhammad Tughlik's attempt to make Daulatabad the capital of his empire brought to the Deccan large numbers of foreign and Upper Indian Musalm\u00e1ns. Under the Bahmani (A.D. 1347-1490) and Bij\u00e1pur (A.D. 1490-1686) dynasties though few of their\n\n\u00b9 M\u00e1lkhed the old R\u00e1shtrakuta capital is in the Niz\u00e1m's country, about ninety miles south-east of Shol\u00e1pur.\n\u00b2 Th\u00e1na Statistical Account, Bombay Gazetteer, XIII, 431, 434; Elliot and Dowson, I. 24, 34, 69.\nkings favoured its forcible spread, Isl\u00e1m steadily gained in strength by the zeal of Arab missionaries, and by the constant streams of Turks, Arabs, Persians, and Abyssinians who came to West India to seek service at the courts of the Deccan kings. The fall of Bij\u00e1pur in 1686 introduced two new Musalm\u00e1n elements, one foreign the other local. Of the foreign element Moghals and Upper Indians few traces remain as almost all have probably been drawn to Haidarabad the centre of Moghal power. Many of the separate communities say that they owe their conversion to Aurangzeb.\\(^1\\) In the eighteenth century, in spite of the decline of the Musalm\u00e1n power, considerable numbers of Arabs were attracted to the service under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chiefs and the fall of the Musalm\u00e1n kingdom of Maisur in 1799 brought some Musalm\u00e1n adventurers to the Deccan during the early years of the present century either as merchants or as camp followers. Most of the mercenaries disappeared from the Deccan districts on the establishment of the British power in 1818. But the K\u00e1kars, Bedras, beef-butchers, Mukris, and other camp followers remain chiefly in Shol\u00e1pur town and cantonment. Most of them have a tradition that they came to their present settlements with General Wellesley\u2019s army in 1803, but it is probable that so long as the Deccan continued to be garrisoned from Madras newcomers from the south settled at the different military stations and during the last fifty years a small number of Bohora and Momin traders from Gujar\u00e1t and Cutch have settled in the Shol\u00e1pur cantonment.\n\nExcept that the men wear the beard, the local converts differ little in appearance from Shol\u00e1pur Hindus. As a rule, the communities of outside or of part-outside origin are larger-boned and fairer-skinned and have sharper and more marked features and lighter eyes than the corresponding classes of Hindus. The women show fewer traces of foreign blood and in many cases can hardly be distinguished from Hindu women. Except a few villagers who speak Mar\u00e1thi and K\u00e1narese, and the fresh settlers from Gujar\u00e1t and Cutch who speak Gujar\u00e1ti, and from Persia and Arabia, who speak Persian and Arabic, the home-tongue of the main body of the Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, spoken either correctly or with a mixture of Mar\u00e1thi, Gujar\u00e1ti, or K\u00e1narese words. Those of local origin speak either Mar\u00e1thi or Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed abroad. Of the town Musalm\u00e1ns Bohor\u00e1s, Memons, mutton-butchers, and Momins live in two-storeyed well built houses with stone and mortar walls and tiled or flat roofs. These houses as a rule have a surrounding court-yard, and several rooms furnished in European style and have a large store of chinaware and of brass and copper vessels. The bulk of the town Musalm\u00e1n houses are one storeyed and flat roofed, many of which have a front and back enclosure surrounded by a stone wall four or five feet high. The houses of the well-to-do have walls of cut stone and mortar, a frame of good timber and\n\n\\(^1\\) Almost all separate Hindu convert classes state that their forefathers were converted either by Aurangzeb or by Tipu of Maisur. It is probable that several of these classes are older converts and that they trace their conversion to Aurangzeb or to Tipu because these are the two best known of Musalm\u00e1n rulers.\nroofs lined with cement; the walls are whitewashed every sixth month and the floor is cleaned with cowdung every fortnight. The poor houses are built with rough stone and clay, and have earth roofs and scanty timber. Village Musalm\u00e1n houses are built in much the same style as poor town houses, and have generally three rooms, one in front, perhaps the largest, is used as a stable for their cattle, the middle one as a bed room, and the third as a kitchen. Poor town and village Musalm\u00e1ns have no taste for European furniture. Their house goods include low stools, bedding, carpets, quilts, one or two cots, boxes, and a few copper and brass vessels tinned both inside and outside. The well-to-do keep a woman servant and two men servants, and keep she-buffaloes, cows, and sometimes horses. Middle class and poor families have no servants but rear cattle and goats. Except a few of the newly come Bohora and Meman settlers none eat wheat. The staple food of the majority of the Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns is rice, millet, pulse, and vegetables, with chillies and tamarind. Husbandmen as a rule take three meals a day, breakfast about seven in the morning, dinner about midday while they are in their fields, and supper on returning home in the evening. As a rule all Musalm\u00e1ns take two meals a day, breaking their fast about ten in the morning with millet bread, pulse, and hot dishes and supping at eight at night. Well-to-do families daily eat rice, mutton or beef, vegetables, pulse, milk, eggs, fowls, and fish. Almost all Deccan Musalm\u00e1ns eat more chillies than other Musalm\u00e1ns. Musalm\u00e1ns as a rule use all kinds of usual animal food including beef, but they eschew the flesh of the buffalo and the pig. In addition to the two main meals the well-to-do men drink tea with bread about seven in the morning and some drink coffee at night. Poor Musalm\u00e1ns cannot afford mutton or beef daily, but almost all have it on Bakar Id, Ramz\u00e1n, and Shabeard\u00e1t and other great days. In spite of the religious rules against intoxicating drinks Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns drink both imported wines and spirits and country liquor. Of other stimulants and narcotics, tobacco is smoked by almost all, and snuff is taken by old men. Opium and hemp are smoked and drunk by religious mendicants and servants, and the artisan classes, almost all of whom are of local descent, use fermented date palm juice in large quantities. As a rule most men of the Shaikh and Syed classes wear a headscarf or dupeta, a long overcoat, a shirt, a waistcloth, and loose trousers. The Labbays dress in the same way as the Shaikhs or Syeds except that they wear the lungi or waistcloth instead of trousers. Middle class and poor men dress in a pair of trousers or a waistcloth, a shirt, a coat, a Mar\u00e1tha turban, and a pair of shoes. Except Bohor\u00e1s and Memans who dress in a backless short-sleeved bodice with a petticoat and a pair of trousers, all Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1n women wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice without passing the skirt of the robe back between the feet. Except the Bohor\u00e1s who wear a large cloak that covers the face and figure, they have no special outdoor dress, but they wrap themselves up in a white sheet covering the head and the upper part of the body to the waist, when they go out of doors. Both men and women have a store of fine clothes for great occasions. Their ornaments are the same as the\nornaments of the Poona and Ahmadnagar Musalm\u00e1ns.\\footnote{Details are given in the Poona and Ahmadnagar Statistical Accounts.} Except the traders weavers and other classes of craftsmen, the bulk of the town Musalm\u00e1ns are somewhat idle, given to drink and good living, and improvident; of the villagers, the husbandmen especially are hardworking, orderly, and thrifty. Of town Musalm\u00e1ns some are tradesmen and a good many are craftsmen. The bulk are soldiers, constables, messengers, and servants. Of the village Musalm\u00e1ns, the greater number are husbandmen and the rest craftsmen. The women add nothing to the family income among traders, soldiers, messengers, constables, and servants, but among husbandmen, and weavers and other craftsmen, the women earn as much as the men. Traders and some weavers and husbandmen are well-to-do, but as a class the Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns are badly off, as they have not yet been able to make up the losses they have suffered during the 1876-77 famine and many craftsmen have to sell their goods to pay debts incurred, as the demand for their articles was then very slack. Sameness in faith, worship, manners and customs binds the Musalm\u00e1ns into one body. Except the bodies of Musalm\u00e1n converts who have either never given up or who have again reverted to Hindu practices all are Sunnis by faith, worship at the same mosques, perform the same ceremonies and employ the same k\u00e1z\u00eds. Among the local converts the Bohor\u00e1s who are Ism\u00e1\u00edli Shi\u00e1s of the D\u00e1\u00fadi sect have a separate mosque and never pray in the regular Sunni mosque. Another irregular sect are the Ghair Mahad\u00eds or Anti-Mahad\u00eds who hold that the expected Saviour or Im\u00e1m has come in the person of Muhamad Mahadi who lived in North India during the fifteenth century; and the Wahabis who would do away with the worship of saints and with all respect for religious doctors. Among the special communities the Bakar Kas\u00e1s or mutton-butchers, the B\u00e1gb\u00e1ns or fruiterers, the Pinj\u00e1r\u00e1s or cotton teasers, the Sikalgars or armourers, the Gavand\u00eds or masons, the Dhob\u00eds or washermen, and Pakh\u00e1l\u00eds or water-carriers have such strong Hindu leanings that they do not associate with other Musalm\u00e1ns, almost never come to the mosques, eschew beef, keep Hindu feasts and openly worship and offer vows to the Hindu gods. Of the regular Musalm\u00e1ns about ten per cent teach their children to read the Kur\u00e1n. Almost all Musalm\u00e1ns are careful to observe the circumcision of their male children, and the initiation or bismillah, and to have their marriage and death ceremonies performed by the k\u00e1zi or judge, or by the mulla or priest. Though as a rule they do not attend daily prayers, almost all Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns attend public prayers on the Ramz\u00e1n and Bakar \u00cdds, and are careful to give alms to the poor and to pay the k\u00e1zi his dues. Their religious officers are the k\u00e1zi or judge, now chiefly the marriage registrar, the kha\u00edtib or preacher, the mulla or priest, the muj\u00e1var or beadle, the b\u00e1ngi or caller to prayer. Under Musalm\u00e1n rule the k\u00e1zi was the civil and criminal judge, but, except that he leads the public prayers on the days of the Ramz\u00e1n and Bakar \u00cdds, he is now little more than a marriage and divorce registrar.\\footnote{In the town of Shol\u00e1pur the k\u00e1zi either himself attends marriages or sends his deputy n\u00e1ib who is paid one-quarter from the k\u00e1zi's fee, and one-half in villages.}\nspite of the loss of his most important functions the k\u00e1zi holds a high place in the Musalm\u00e1n community. The mulla or priest who is a deputy of the k\u00e1zi, generally appointed by him, conducts marriage and death ceremonies at villagers' houses and kills animals both for Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s as a rule do not themselves kill sheep and goats or eat the flesh of animals killed by any one except by mull\u00e1s. The mulla holds a free grant of land or is yearly paid in grain by the villagers, besides what he gets for conducting marriages and deaths at the villager's, after having paid the k\u00e1zi three-fourths of the proceeds. Most of these mull\u00e1s are illiterate and know only thrice to repeat bismillah or In Allah's Name on the knife before it is used in cutting the animal's throat. For this as a rule he is paid \\( \\frac{1}{2}d. \\) to \\( 1\\frac{1}{2}d. \\) (\u00bc - 1 a.) for each goat or sheep.\n\nThe muj\u00e1var or beadle is either a hereditary servant at the shrine of a saint employed by the descendants of the saint or a descendant himself when the income of the shrine is small. He keeps the shrine clean and lives on the offerings that are made to the saint. When the worshipper brings offerings to the shrine, the beadle burns frankincense before the saint's tomb and lays the offerings at the top of the tomb. He then asks the saint to give his blessing to the worshipper and divides the offerings into two parts, keeping one for himself and handing the other to the worshipper with a pinch of frankincense ashes. The religious teachers of the Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns are called p\u00edrj\u00e1d\u00e1s or descendants of saints. They live at Belgaum, Bij\u00e1pur, or Gulburga, and come yearly or once in two or three years to gather their dues from their worshippers. As a class p\u00edrj\u00e1d\u00e1s are lazy, unthrifty, and uneducated, and most of them are fond of intoxicating drinks and drugs. They live on the produce of their quit-rent lands and funds raised by contribution among their followers or worshippers, and do not preach their doctrines or make new converts. The followers or worshippers of the same saint or p\u00edr love each other so well that each follower looks upon his fellow-disciple as a brother or sister calling each other p\u00edrbh\u00e1i or religious brother, or p\u00edrbhain or religious sister.\n\nWhen a Musalm\u00e1n wishes to become a disciple of a p\u00edry\u00e1da he has to give a money present or n\u00e1zr\u00e1na of 10s. to \u00a32 10s. (Rs.5-25) and a dinner party to his religious teacher, who enrolls the new worshipper's name in his list of followers and gives him in return a paper roll of genealogical tables containing the names of the teacher's ancestors. The worshippers value these tables even more than life, and, especially among the lower classes they are buried with the dead under the belief that the names mentioned in the tables may relieve the dead from the agonies of hell. All Musalm\u00e1ns except the\n\n---\n\n1 Under the 1880 K\u00e1zi's Act Government have appointed two k\u00e1z\u00eds at Shol\u00e1pur, one for the cantonment and the other for the native town and the district. The town k\u00e1zi has an hereditary title and has quit-rent or j\u00e1gir land. His ordinary fee varies from 5s. to 10s. (Rs.2\u00bd-5).\n\n2 Before killing an animal a Musalm\u00e1n is required to express the following wish or niy\u00e1t either in Arabic or in his mother-tongue; 'I being desirous to bring into proper and lawful use this creature of Allah kill this bird, or beast; that it may become pure and lawful for us to eat by the truth that Allah is all-powerful and Muham-mad is his prophet.' After repeating these words the knife should be passed three times over the animal's throat. To separate the head from the neck is considered wrong but it does not make the animal hard\u00edn or unlawful.\nBohor\u00e1s and Wahabis believe in saints or pirs and offer them vows when they are sick or in difficulty. Most of the artisan classes and husbandmen also either privately or publicly worship the Hindu gods and goddesses and make vows to Mhasoba, Satvai, and Yallamma. The Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns make pilgrimages to Bij\u00e1pur, Poona, and Gulburga and believe in witchcraft soothsaying and evil spirits. The chief ceremonies among the Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns are at birth, circumcision, marriage, puberty, and death. Town Musalm\u00e1ns marry their boys between fifteen and twenty and their girls before they come of age. Village Musalm\u00e1ns marry their children earlier than townsmen, and, except that they are less expensive village Musalm\u00e1n marriages are a counterpart of town Musalm\u00e1n marriages. Except that many Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns have ceased to perform the betrothal ceremony since the 1876-77 famine, their customs are the same as those of Poona Musalm\u00e1ns. A few send their boys to school and teach them to read the Kur\u00e1n. About twenty per cent of town Musalm\u00e1ns, including traders and Government servants, teach their boys Mar\u00e1thi and Urdu and sometimes English. Almost all village Musalm\u00e1ns make their sons begin to work as soon as they are eight or nine. Meman and Bohora boys learn Arabic enough to read the Kur\u00e1n and also Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed and Urdu. On the whole, the town Musalm\u00e1ns are fairly off and except a few craftsmen, the village Musalm\u00e1ns are poor.\n\nThe forty-three classes of Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns may be arranged into two groups, four main classes and thirteen minor classes who intermarry, differ little in look dress and customs, and together form one body; and twenty-seven separate communities most of which are distinct in matters of marriage and have some peculiar or irregular customs or dress. The main body of Musalm\u00e1ns who intermarry and differ little in look dress or customs, besides the four main classes of Syeds Shaikhs Moghals and Path\u00e1ns, include thirteen minor classes, of whom the Wah\u00e1b\u00eds are a separate religious sect, the Bedras are traders, the At\u00e1rs or perfumers are shopkeepers, and seven classes, including Barutgars or firework makers, Kafshgars or embroiderers, Kalaigars or tinners, Many\u00e1rs or bracelet makers, Rafugars or tailors, Rangrez or dyers, and S\u00fat\u00e1rs or carpenters are craftsmen, and two classes Mah\u00e1wats or elephant drivers and S\u00e1rb\u00e1ns or camel drivers are servants. Of the twenty-six separate communities six are of non-local origin, of whom four Bohor\u00e1s and Memans from Gujar\u00e1t, Labbays from the Malab\u00e1r coast, and Mukris from Maisur are traders, and two K\u00e1kars or Afgh\u00e1ns and Pendh\u00e1ris are dealers in ponies. Of the twenty-one separate communities of local origin one is a religious sect of Ghair Mahadis, four B\u00e1gb\u00e1ns or fruitiners, Bojgars or millet beer sellers, T\u00e1mbolis or betel sellers, and Bhadbhunj\u00e1s or parched grain dealers are shopkeepers, two Bhois or fishers and Kanj\u00e1rs or fowlers are animal dealers; nine Bakar Kas\u00e1bs or mutton-butchers, G\u00e1i Kas\u00e1bs or beef-butchers, Gavandis or masons, Momins or weavers, Pinj\u00e1ris or cotton teasers, Patvegars or silk weavers, R\u00e1chbhar\u00e1s or Raibhar\u00e1s literally reed-fillers that is weavers, Sikligars or armourers, and Saltangars or leather dyers are craftsmen; one Darweshis or wild beast keepers are tiger and bear showmen; and four Bhatyar\u00e1s or\ncooks, Dhobis or washermen, Hal\u00e1lkhors or sweepers, and Pakh\u00e1lis or water-carriers are servants.\n\nOf the four leading divisions of Musalm\u00e1ns Moghals, Path\u00e1ns, Shaikhs, and Syeds, all except Moghals are large communities whose members are found throughout the district.\n\n**Moghals** are found in small numbers over the whole district especially in the town of the Shol\u00e1pur. They claim descent from the Moghal conquerors of the Deccan in the seventeenth century (Ahmadnagar 1628 and Bij\u00e1pur in 1686). By intermarriage, and probably because many of them are local converts who took the name Moghal from their patron or leader, they have entirely lost their foreign appearance. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, and, like Shaikhs and Syeds whom they are similar to in look, they speak Mar\u00e1thi and K\u00e1narese with the local Hindus. The men add *mirza* or *beg* to their names and the women *bibi* to theirs. The men shave the head and wear the beard full, and, except that they wear a Mar\u00e1tha turban, their dress is the same as the Syed\u2019s or Shaikh\u2019s. The women who wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice add nothing to the family income and never appear in public. They are constables, servants, messengers, and husbandmen, and are hardworking and thrifty but badly off and in debt. They are Hanafi Sunnis and religious and marry their daughters to Path\u00e1ns, Shaikhs, and Syeds. They teach their children to read the Kur\u00e1n and send them to school but are very poor.\n\n**Path\u00e1ns**, found over the whole district in large numbers, are said to be the descendants of the Afgh\u00e1n mercenaries and military leaders who conquered or took service in the Deccan, or of the local converts who took the name of their leader. The men are tall, dark, or olive-skinned well made and strong. They shave the head, wear the beard full, and dress in a turban or headscarf, a shirt, a waistcoat, and a pair of tight trousers. The women are well built and regular featured and dress in the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. The men add *kh\u00e1n* to their names. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and they speak K\u00e1narese and Mar\u00e1thi abroad. The women do not appear in public, and do nothing but mind the house. The town Path\u00e1ns are soldiers, constables, messengers, and servants, and the village Path\u00e1ns are husbandmen. Though hardworking and thrifty most of them still suffer from the effects of the 1876-77 famine. They do not differ from Syeds and Shaikhs or Moghals in their social and religious customs and give their daughters to and take wives from these three classes. They are Sunnis but are very careless about saying their prayers. They send their children to school.\n\n**Shaikhs** in theory belong to three leading Kuraish families, the Sidikis who claim descent from Abu Bakar Sidik, the Fakirs who claim descent from Umar al F\u00e1ruk, and the Abb\u00e1s\u00eds who claim descent from Abb\u00e1s one of the prophet\u2019s nine uncles. In fact the bulk of the Shaikhs are chiefly if not entirely of local descent. The men take Shaikh or Muhammad before their names and women add *bibi* or lady to theirs. They do not differ from Syeds in look and like them speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed at home. The men shave\nthe head or let the hair grow and wear full beards. The town Shaikhs wear a headscarf or dupeta or Hindu turban, a shirt, and a pair of tight trousers, and the village Shaikhs a turban, waistcoat, and a waistcloth. The women, who differ little in appearance from high class Hindu women, dress in the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, and, except the poor and villagers, do not appear in public or add to the family income. Both men and women are clean and neat in their habits. The men are husbandmen, soldiers, constables, messengers, and servants, and are hardworking and thrifty. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and are religious and careful to repeat their prayers. They respect the k\u00e1zi and employ him to conduct and register their marriages. They have no special organisation and marry either among themselves or with any of the leading Musalm\u00e1ns. They teach their boys to read the Kur\u00e1n and send them to vernacular schools.\n\nSyeds, or Elders, are said to have settled in the district from the beginning of Musalm\u00e1n rule in the Deccan. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni but they speak both Mar\u00e1thi and K\u00e1narese fluently. As a rule Syeds are larger-boned and better featured than the local Musalm\u00e1ns, and their women are fair and delicate featured. The men shave the head and wear the beard and dress in a headscarf or dupeta, a shirt, a waistcoat, and an overcoat hanging to the knees, a waistcloth, or a pair of loose trousers. The women wear the Hindu robe and bodice, and neither appear in public nor add to the family income. As a class they are clean, neat, honest, hardworking, and thrifty. They are landholders, religious teachers, soldiers, constables, and servants. They are fond of ease. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school, and are religious and careful to say their prayers. They respect and obey the k\u00e1zi and keep no Hindu customs. They have no special organisation and except that they occasionally marry their daughters to Shaikhs and take to wives the daughters of the regular Musalm\u00e1ns, they marry only among their own class. They send their boys to school and teach them to read the Kur\u00e1n and Mar\u00e1thi books.\n\nTwelve classes who are separate in name only and marry with the four general divisions and with each other form part of the main body of Shol\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nAt\u00e1rs, or Perfumers, all local converts, are found in small numbers in Shol\u00e1pur and other towns and large villages. They are middle-sized, dark, and well built, and speak Hindust\u00e1ni at home and Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese abroad. Except that they sometimes wear the waistlotho instead of trousers, the men dress in the same way as Path\u00e1ns or Moghals. The women appear in public and help the men in their work. They sit at the shop when the men are away. They are clean, neat, honest, hardworking, and thrifty. At\u00e1rs are dealers in scented oils and powders, but they lost greatly during the 1876-77 famine and many have since abandoned their craft and taken to earn their living as constables and messengers. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and their customs differ little from those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They are religious, obey and respect the k\u00e1zi, and marry with the regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They teach\ntheir children to read the Kur\u00e1n and send their boys to local schools.\n\n**Barutgars**, or Firework Makers, a class of local converts are found in Shol\u00e1pur town. They rank themselves with Shaikhs and their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni. Of middle height, strongly made and dark or olive-skinned, they are clean, neat, and hardworking. The men dress in a turban, a shirt, a waistcoat, a pair of trousers, and shoes, and the women in a Mar\u00e1thi robe and bodice. The women appear in public and help the men in their work besides minding the house. Barutgars are firework makers and their trade is brisk in the fair season especially at Div\u00e1li and during the marriage time. The Shabebar\u00e1t holidays also bring them a good deal of work. They work to order, and a few among them are constables, messengers, and servants. Their social and religious customs are the same as those of other regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They belong to the Hanafi sect of Sunnis and are careful to say their prayers. They marry among ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns and have no separate community. They do not send their children to school and are a falling class.\n\n**Bedras**, immigrants from Maisur, are found in small numbers in the town and cantonment of Shol\u00e1pur. They are converts from the great Bedaru tribe of hunters and husbandmen and were converted by and were in the service of Haidar Ali, and are said to have come to Shol\u00e1pur in 1803 with Colonel Wellesley\u2019s army. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni at home and Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese abroad. They are tall, middle-sized, well made, and fair. The men shave the head, wear the beard full, and dress in a headscarf, a long loose-sleeved shirt, a waistcoat, and loose trousers. The women dress in the Mar\u00e1thi robe and bodice and do no work except minding the house. They are traders and servants and being sober, hardworking, and thrifty are well-to-do. They rank with the Path\u00e1ns and marry with both Shaikhs and Path\u00e1ns. They are religious and differ little from other Musalm\u00e1ns in customs. They teach their children to read the Kur\u00e1n and send their sons to the local vernacular schools.\n\n**Kafshgars**, or Shoemakers, are local converts found in small numbers in the town and cantonment of Shol\u00e1pur only. The men are wheat-coloured and middle-sized and shave their head but wear the beard full. The Kafshgar\u2019s home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni but they speak Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese abroad, and, except that the men sometimes wear trousers, their ordinary dress does not differ from that of Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis. Their women appear in public and mind the house. Kafshgars are makers of the embroidered red or yellow broadcloth shoes which are generally worn by Musalm\u00e1n married women for one or two years after marriage. Since the 1876-77 famine many shoemakers have left their trade for Government service as constables and messengers. Kafshgars marry with the lower classes of Musalm\u00e1ns and do not form a separate community. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school, and obey the k\u00e1zi, but are not careful to say their prayers. Their social and religious customs are the same as those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They do not send their children to school and are a decaying class.\nKala'igars, or Tinners, all local converts, are found in small numbers all over the district. In look, dress, speech, character, and religion they are similar to Kafshgars and their customs are the same as regular Musalm\u00e1n customs. As a class they are hardworking and thrifty and their women do not appear in public or help them in their work. They tin copper and brass vessels and are chiefly employed by Musalm\u00e1ns and Europeans who pay them 8s. to 10s. (Rs. 4-5) the hundred vessels. A few are constables and messengers and some are servants. They belong to the Hanafi sect of Sunnis and have no special organisation. They are religious and careful to say their prayers and send their boys to school.\n\nMaha'wats, or Elephant Drivers, the descendants of local converts, are found in the cantonment of Shol\u00e1pur. In look, speech, dress, character, and customs they resemble regular Musalm\u00e1ns. Since they have found their services in less demand than before the British rule, they have become husbandmen, messengers, and servants. They are religious and send their boys to school and teach them to read the Kur\u00e1n. They are fairly off.\n\nManya'rs, or Bangle Sellers, the descendants of local converts, are found in small numbers in towns. They resemble other regular Musalm\u00e1ns in speech, look, dress, and character, and are neat, clean, hardworking, and thrifty. Their women do not appear in public, but, besides minding the house, help the men in their calling. The Many\u00e1rs sell glass and wax bangles and deal in hardware. They buy their articles wholesale from the local Hindu traders and Bohor\u00e1s and sell them retail. They are religious and their social and religious customs are the same as those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits. Their calling is well paid and they are fairly off.\n\nRafugars, or Darners, descendants of local converts, are found in small numbers in the town and cantonment of Shol\u00e1pur. They rank themselves with Shaikhs and are similar to them in look, speech, dress, and character. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and are careful to say their prayers and obey and respect their k\u00e1zi. Their social and religious customs are the same as Shaikh customs. Besides darners many are soldiers, constables, and servants. Though hardworking and thrifty as a class they are badly off. They do not send their boys to school and are poor.\n\nRangrez, or Dyers, descendants of local converts, are found in towns only. They are middle-sized, strong and well built and their women are fair and regular featured. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni and they are neat, clean, and hardworking. In look and dress they resemble regular Musalm\u00e1ns and their women appear in public and help in preparing colours besides minding the house. They dye robes, turbans, scarfs, and constable's trousers. Their calling is well paid and their trade is brisk in the fair weather especially during the marriage months and the Div\u00e1li and Shimga holidays. They belong to the Hanafi Sunni sect but are very careless in saying their prayers. They have no separate organisation and their social and religious customs do not differ from those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits. But their calling is well paid and they are fairly off.\nSa'rbans, or Camel Drivers, are descendants of local converts of the Hindu class of the same name and are found in the town of Shol\u00e1pur. They are dark, middle-sized, regular featured and strong, and their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni. Both men and women dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Their women appear in public, and, except that they mind the house, do not help the men in their work. Both men and women are clean and neat in their habits, but, though hardworking and thrifty, they are seldom well-to-do. Under the British Government the demand for their services has fallen, and many have taken to new pursuits. Some are constables and a few are messengers and servants. They are religious and belong to the Hanafi sect or Sunnis. They teach their children to read the Kur\u00e1n and do not differ from regular Musalm\u00e1ns in religious or social customs. They are a poor class. None of them have risen to any high position under the British.\n\nS\u00fat\u00e1rs, or Carpenters, descendants of local converts from the S\u00fat\u00e1r caste, are found in the town and cantonment of Shol\u00e1pur. In look and speech they resemble regular Musalm\u00e1ns, and, except that they do not wear the trousers and that their clothes are dirty, their ordinary dress does not differ from the Shaikh or Path\u00e1n dress. The women dress in the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and do nothing but mind the house. They are carpenters and earn \u00a31 4s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 12-30) a month. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school but are careless of fulfilling their religious duties. They practise all the regular Musalm\u00e1n observances and have no special community rules for themselves. They do not send their boys to school. They are hardworking and well paid but they are given to drinking country liquor and are badly off.\n\nThere are two or three Wah\u00e1b\u00ed preachers in the town of Shol\u00e1pur who try to persuade the people to join their sect. The movement has not met with the support of the learned or rich and has made little progress. Their converts are chiefly from Mukris, Pendh\u00e1ris, and a few betel-sellers, all of them ignorant and illiterate. Still these converts have received their doctrines with great care and readiness and have begun to attend regularly five times a day in the mosques for prayers.\n\nOf the twenty-six separate communities, the four of non-local origin are:\n\nBohora's mostly immigrants from Gujar\u00e1t are found in small numbers in the town of Shol\u00e1pur. They are partly of Hindu and partly of Arab and Persian origin, and are said to have come from Gujar\u00e1t to Shol\u00e1pur about forty years ago. Their home-tongue is Gujar\u00e1ti and they speak Hindust\u00e1ni abroad. They are thin tall and fair, the men shave the head and wear full beards and dress in a white turban, a long white Gujar\u00e1t Hindu coat, a shirt falling below the knee, and a pair of loose trousers of white or striped cotton. The women, who are delicate fair-skinned and regular featured, dress in a coloured cotton or silk petticoat, a backless short-sleeved bodice, and a coloured cotton headscarf. When they go out of doors they throw a dark cloak over their head which covers the body to the ankles, with gauze openings for the eyes. Both men and women are clean and neat in their habits and have a large store\nof Chinaware and copper vessels. All are shopkeepers dealing in English hardware, drugs, and piece-goods, and make tin pots and looking glasses. They buy their articles through agents in Bombay. As a class they are honest, hardworking, and well-to-do; the women do nothing but mind the house. They marry among themselves alone, and, though they dine with other Musalm\u00e1ns, they form an altogether separate community. In religion they are Shi\u00e1s of the Ism\u00e1li sect, believe in the twelve Im\u00e1ms or saints, and hold in great respect the Mulla S\u00e1heb of Surat, the high priest of their faith. One of the rich traders of their community is appointed the Mulla S\u00e1heb's deputy at Shol\u00e1pur, and collects the high priest's dues which vary from 2s. (Re. 1) to the fifth of each man's income. They have a separate mosque where they preach without the help of any priest. Though they do not associate with ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns there is no great difference in their customs and observances. Their chief peculiarity is that their month begins with the full-moon and their feast and fast days fall a fortnight before those of the Sunnis. They send their children to ordinary Mulla schools where they learn to read the Kur\u00e1n, and teach them Gujar\u00e1ti at home. They are a rising class.\n\nGa'ikasa'bs, or Beef-butchers, descendants of local converts, are found in small numbers in the Shol\u00e1pur cantonment. They say their forefathers were converted by Tipu Sultan (1783 - 1799) and came to Shol\u00e1pur with General Wellesley's camp. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni. Except that they wear the beard full, in look and dress beef-butchers resemble mutton-butchers. The women dress in a robe and bodice, appear in public, and help in selling beef. Both men and women are dirty and untidy in their habits. They kill both cows and buffaloes buying cows at \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10 - 15) each and buffaloes at 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5 - 10). They have fixed shops and sell beef to Musalm\u00e1ns and Christians, and buffalo flesh to a few Christians and Musalm\u00e1ns and to Mh\u00e1rs, Bhang\u00eds, M\u00e1ngs, and other low-caste Hindus. They sell cow beef at 1\u00bdd. to 3d. (1-2 as.) a pound and buffalo beef at \u00bdd. to 1\u00bdd. (\u00bd - 1 a.) a pound. They sell the hides to the local Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs. They are hardworking but extremely fond of date palm juice, and are seldom well-to-do. They have no separate organisation and their customs are the same as those of ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns. They belong to the Hanafi school of Sunnis in name only as they are said to be very careless in repeating their prayers. They are illiterate themselves, and do not send their children to school, and are a poor class.\n\nMehma'ns, properly Momins or Believers, immigrants from\n\n---\n\n1 The Cutch Mehm\u00e1ns through whom probably the Halai Mehm\u00e1ns changed their faith are said to have been converted to Isl\u00e1m in Sind in 1422 by an Arab missionary named Yusufud\u00edn a descendant of the celebrated saint Mohidin Jilani commonly known as the saint of saints or p\u00edr\u00e1n pir. Yusufud\u00edn succeeded at first in winning over two leading men of the Loh\u00e1na caste named Hansr\u00e1j and Sundarji, and a large number of Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s the friends and relations of the two followed them and thus a separate community was formed with Sundarji or Adamji as he was called after his conversion at their head. About a hundred and twenty years after, in 1514, a large body of Musalm\u00e1ns moved from Sind to Cutch which since then has become the head-quarters of the Mehm\u00e1ns or Momins.\nCutch have two houses in Shol\u00e1pur town. They are chiefly descended from converts of the Cutch Loh\u00e1na caste and are said to have come to Shol\u00e1pur from Bombay within the last sixty years. Their home-tongue is a mixture of Cutchi and Hindust\u00e1ni and they speak Hindust\u00e1ni abroad. They are tall, fair, and well made. The men shave the head and wear the beard full. They dress in a headscarf, a long overcoat, a waistcoat, a long shirt falling to the knees, and a pair of loose trousers. Their women are delicate, fair, and regular featured, and dress in a headscarf, a long silken shirt falling to the ankles, and a pair of loose silk trousers. They seldom wear the bodice. They do not appear in public, and mind the house only. As a class they are clean, neat, and hardworking and deal in English cloth, furniture, and other Europe articles. They marry among themselves only, and form a distinct community but have no separate class organisation and no headman. They respect and obey the k\u00e1zi of the ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns and associate with them in every respect. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and are careful to say their prayers. They teach their children to read the Kur\u00e1n. Many men learn to read and write Mar\u00e1thi, but none of them knows English, but as a class they are hardworking and thrifty and as their calling is well paid they are a well-to-do and rising class.\n\nMukris said to mean Deniers, are found in small numbers over the whole district. They are immigrants from Maisur and are said to be descendants of Hindus of the Lam\u00e1n tribe who were converted by Tipu Sult\u00e1n (1785-1799). They call themselves Pat\u00e1ns or people from Ser\u00edngapatam and seem to have got the name Mukris or Deniers for their proverbial dishonesty.\\(^1\\) They say they came to Shol\u00e1pur with General Wellesley\u2019s army in 1803.\\(^2\\) Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni. They are tall, dark, strong, and regular featured. The men wear full beards and dress in a loosely tied particoloured headscarf, a shirt, a waistcoat, and a pair of tight trousers or a waistcloth. The women who are tall like the men but fairer and thinner, except that the old women among them wear a Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, dress in a headscarf, a bodice, and a striped cotton petticoat; they are clean and neat, appear in public and mind the house only. The men have no taste for showy furniture and deal in corn, sugar, molasses, and other groceries, which they buy wholesale and sell retail. They are proverbial cheats, and being hardworking and thrifty are well-to-do. They form a separate community with a headman called chaudhari generally chosen by the caste people from among the richer families. The chaudhari punishes breaches of social rules with fines and caste feasts. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and respect and obey\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Regarding the origin of these people the story is told that a servant of Tipu Sult\u00e1n bought a quarter or man of corn from a Mukri and found 10 lbs. (5 shers) less on weighing it at home. He brought the fact to the notice of the Sult\u00e1n who sent for the corn dealer and demanded an explanation. The Mukri denied the fact and made the full weight in the presence of the king who had twice weighed the corn before and had found it short. The king was embarrassed and had nothing to say against the man, and gave him the name Denier.\n\n\\(^2\\) These and other classes probably came with General Munro in 1818 not in 1803.\nthe k\u00e1zi of the regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They teach their boys to read and write Mar\u00e1thi. Besides as corn dealers they serve as constables, contractors, messengers, and servants. They are a rising class.\n\nThe twenty separate communities of local origin are:\n\nBa'gb\u00e1ns, literally gardeners or fruiterers, all descended from local Kunbis are found in large numbers in towns and large villages. In speech and look they resemble ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns, and, except that they do not wear trousers, their daily dress is the same as the regular Musalm\u00e1n dress. The women wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and a bodice, appear in public, and help the men in their calling. As a class B\u00e1gb\u00e1ns are dirty, but hardworking, honest, orderly, and thrifty, and are fruit and vegetable sellers. A few among them are well-to-do but many of them are in debt. They nominally belong to the Hanafi sect of Sunnis but practically are Hindus worshipping regular Hindu gods, keeping the Hindu fasts and feasts, and eschewing beef. They marry among themselves and form a separate community with a headman chosen from among their richest families. The head with the consent of the majority of the castemen punishes breaches of social rules with fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. They do not send their children to school or take to new pursuits, and are a falling class.\n\nBakar Kasa'bs, or Mutton-butchers, descended from converts of the Lad Kas\u00e1b caste, are found in large numbers all over the district. They trace their conversion partly to Aurangzeb and partly to Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n of Maisur. They are said to have come to Shol\u00e1pur with the army of General Wellesley, but are more likely to have come with General Munro in 1818. They have two subdivisions K\u00e1ml\u00e1s or blanket-wearers and Kaund\u00e1s or quilt-wearers. K\u00e1ml\u00e1s found in the Deccan and Karn\u00e1tak work as butchers only while the Kaund\u00e1s are found only in the Niz\u00e1m's country and are called Ch\u00e1knav\u00e1l\u00e1s or boiled mutton sellers. The Shol\u00e1pur K\u00e1ml\u00e1s speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed at home and Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese abroad. The men shave the head and either shave the beard or wear it short. A few wear gold earrings, a little larger than women's earrings, and dress in a turban, a waistcoat, a waistcloth, or a pair of tight trousers. The women wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and help in selling mutton. Both men and women are dirty and untidy, but hardworking and thrifty. They have fixed shops and never hawk flesh about the streets. As a class they are orderly, honest, and well-to-do. Except that they ask the k\u00e1zi to register their marriages or employ him at their deaths, they never perform any Musalm\u00e1n rites or associate with other Musalm\u00e1ns. They keep all Hindu fasts and feasts, hold beef-butchers in contempt, and eschew beef. Their names are the same as Hindu names and they form a separate community under their headman or p\u00e1t\u00edl who settles social disputes with the consent of the majority of the caste. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, live in comfort and lay by.\n\nBhadbhunja's, or Grain Parchers, are found in small numbers in all towns and large villages. They are dark, strong, and well built, and, except that they wear the beard; in look speech and dress they\nresemble Upper Indians or Pardeshis. The women wear a Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and help in parching grain. As a class they are dirty and untidy but orderly and hardworking. Though many of them are thrifty, as a class Bhadbhunj\u00e1s live from hand to mouth. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school but seldom say their prayers, and their customs are a mixture of Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n rites. They marry only among themselves and have a well organised union under their headman who is chosen from among the richest families. He has power to fine any one who breaks caste rules. They differ from ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns in eschewing beef, keeping Hindu feasts, and offering vows to Hindu gods. They respect and obey the k\u00e1zi whom they employ to register their marriages and sometimes to settle their caste disputes. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits. Besides as grain parchers they earn their living as servants and labourers and are a poor class.\n\nBojgars, or Boj or Millet Beer Sellers, local converts of the Bhoi caste, are scattered in small numbers over the district. They speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed at home and Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese abroad. They are dark spare tall and rough featured, shave the head, and wear the beard full. The men dress in a Mar\u00e1tha turban, a shirt, a coat, and a waistcloth, and the women in the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. The women appear in public, but mind the house only. As a class Bojgars are clean and neat in their habits but are given to smoke hemp flower and drink liquor and sell millet beer at their fixed shops. Besides at liquor shops the men and women work as labourers. Some among the men are fishers and palanquin bearers. They are careless of the future, spend what they daily earn, and are poorly clad and generally in debt. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi sect and though careless in saying their prayers they obey and respect the kdzi and employ him to register their marriages. They marry among themselves and form a distinct community under a headman chosen from among the oldest and richest families. They have a caste council. They are unlettered themselves and do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits.\n\nBhois, or Fishers and Palanquin Bearers, descended from local converts of the Hindu tribe of the same name, are found over the whole district. They speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed among themselves and Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese with others. The men are dark, middle-sized, and well made, shave the head, wear the beard full, and dress in a Mar\u00e1tha turban, a waistcoat, and a waistcloth. The women are fairer than the men, wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, and appear in public but do not add to the family income. As a class Bhois are dirty and untidy. The men are palanquin bearers but except on marriage occasions among the Musalm\u00e1ns the demand for their services has ceased since the time of the opening of roads and railways. As a class they are badly off. Some among them have become millet beer sellers, fishers, constables, messengers, and servants. They are hardworking but given to drink. They marry among themselves or with Bojgars and form a separate community. They have strong Hindu leanings, eschew beef, and keep Hindu festivals. Though\nSunnis of the Hanafi school in name, they seldom pray or keep Musalm\u00e1n customs. They obey and respect the k\u00e1zi and employ him to register their marriages. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits.\n\nBhatya'ra's, or Cooks, probably descended from local converts, are found in small numbers over the whole district. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni with themselves and K\u00e1narese or Mar\u00e1thi abroad. In look and dress they do not differ from ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns. The women dress in the robe and bodice, appear in public, and help the men in their work. As a class Bhaty\u00e1r\u00e1s are dirty and untidy in their habits and are boarding-housekeepers. They have fixed boarding houses which are scarcely supplied with any furniture except mats and are often dirty. Their customers are chiefly travellers and poor houseless labourers and the men are often employed to cook Musalm\u00e1n dinner parties. They make 1s. to 4s. (Rs. \u00bd - 2) a day and their women manage the boarding house. Though hardworking and earning much they waste their money in drink and are poor. They marry among themselves and form a distinct body under a headman chosen from among their richer families. Though they call themselves Sunnis of the Hanafi school they seldom say their prayers. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, and none of them have risen to any high position.\n\nDhobis, or Washermen, converts from the Hindu caste of the same name, are found in small numbers over the whole district. In look speech and dress they resemble ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns and their social and religious customs are the same as Musalm\u00e1n customs. Their women appear in public and help the men in washing clothes. As a class Dhobis are clean and neat, hardworking, sober, and thrifty. The men make 12s. to \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 6 - 18) a month but many are given to drinking date-palm juice and are seldom well-to-do. They have a headman and a caste council and marry among themselves only. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi sect but they never say their prayers and have strong Hindu leanings, eschewing beef and keeping Hindu feasts and making vows to Hindu gods. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, and are a falling class.\n\nGavandis, or Kadi\u00e1s, local converts of the caste of the same name, are found in small numbers in towns and large villages. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni at home and Mar\u00e1thi abroad. They are strong dark and well made. The men shave the head but wear the beard and dress in a Mar\u00e1tha turban, a waistcoat, and a waistcloth.

They say they are Sunnis of the Hanafi school but have strong Hindu leanings, making vows to Hindu gods, eschewing beef, and keeping Hindu festivals. They do not send their children to school, and are a falling class.\nGhair Mahadis, or Anti-Mahadis, who believe that the last Im\u00e1m or Saviour has come, are found in small numbers over the whole district. The founder of their sect was Muhammad Mahadi, son of Syedkh\u00e1n of Jaunpur who was born in 1443 (847 H.). He began to preach at the age of forty as a saint or wali and drew round him a number of followers both at Mecca and at Jaunpur. In 1497 he openly called himself the looked-for Mahadi and his public career was marked by a number of miracles. After his death in 1504 from fever his son with a few followers came to the Deccan, and in 1520, Burh\u00e1n Nizamsh\u00e1h of Ahmadnagar became a staunch believer in the sect Mahadi. Even now their largest number of Ghair Mahadis are found in Ahmadnagar. Their converts were chiefly low and ignorant Musalm\u00e1ns. Though free to profess their opinions the Ghair Mahadis still practise caution or takkiy\u00e1b, and most of them are anxious to pass as orthodox Musalm\u00e1ns. They speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, and, except that they hold that Muhammad Mahadi is the last Im\u00e1m or expected Saviour and that they do not repent for their sins or pray for the souls of the dead, they do not differ from regular Musalm\u00e1ns in look dress or customs. They marry among themselves and live in circles or dair\u00e1s governed by rules of their own. Both men and women are clean, neat, honest, hardworking, orderly, and thrifty. The women dress in a Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice and do not work beyond minding the house. The men dress like regular Musalm\u00e1ns and are constables, messengers, and servants. They take to new pursuits and are fairly off. They teach their boys to read the Kur\u00e1n and send them to school. They are a steady class.\n\nHala\u00edkhors, or Sweepers, perhaps descended from local converts of the Bhangi caste, are found in considerable numbers in Shol\u00e1pur. Except that they are nightsoil-men they do not differ from other Musalm\u00e1ns in look dress and social and religious customs. The women work as much as the men. As a class they are dirty and untidy in their habits, hardworking but given to drinking date-palm juice. They have a separate caste council and a headman called p\u00e1til. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and have strong Hindu leanings. They employ the k\u00e1zi at their marriages and deaths and attend mosque only on the Bakar Ids and the Ramz\u00e1n days. They do not associate with other Musalm\u00e1ns who look down on them. They are considered impure, and are not allowed to read or even to touch the Kur\u00e1n. They worship Hindu gods and keep Hindu feasts. They do not send their children to school and are a low and poor class.\n\nKanj\u00e1rs, or Poulterers, probably descended from local converts of the Vad\u00e1r or P\u00e1rdhi tribes, are found in small numbers over the whole district. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and all are tall dark and thin. The men wear the beard and dress in a waistcloth, a waistcoat, and a Mar\u00e1tha turban. The women wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and help in rearing and selling poultry. As a class Kanj\u00e1rs are dirty and untidy in their habits, rear and sell poultry, and make hemp ropes and coir. Though hardworking and thrifty in managing the house both men and women are\ngiven to drink. The women are proverbially quarrelsome. Except that they say that they are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and ask the k\u00e1zi to register their marriages they are Hindus in religion, worshipping all Hindu gods and goddesses and keeping the regular Hindu fasts and feasts. They form a separate community under their headman or chauthari who settles social disputes and punishes breaches of social rules with fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. They marry among themselves only and do not send their boys to school but live from hand to mouth.\n\nMomins, or Weavers, probably local converts of the Koshti or S\u00e1li class, are found in large numbers over the whole district. They are said to have been converted in the fourteenth century by an Arabic preacher Pir Syed Husein Gaisudar\u00e1z or Kh\u00e1v Bunda Naw\u00e1z who died in 1408 (825 H.) at Gulbarga. The descendants of this saint or pir still hold the position of religious teachers or pirj\u00e1d\u00e1s to the Shol\u00e1pur Momins who call themselves the pirj\u00e1d\u00e1s' disciples or murids and pay them a yearly tribute. Except that they wear the beard and speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed at home, in look dress and speech they resemble the Hindu weavers, and their women appear in public and help in weaving. Both men and women as a rule are dirty and untidy, but honest, orderly, and hardworking. They are weavers and use English yarn as it is cleaner and finer than local hand-made yarn. The well-to-do among them employ servants to work under them. They sell their goods to cloth merchants in Shol\u00e1pur or go hawking them from place to place. Except during the rains their work is constant. Their goods are in great demand especially during the marriage seasons from January to June. They work both day and night with short intervals for food and rest. Owing to the reduced condition of the Shol\u00e1pur people in consequence of the 1876-77 famine, Momins' goods are not in so much demand as they once were, and though hardworking they are given to date palm juice drinking and are badly off. The women work as much as the men and mind the house. They marry among themselves and form a separate body under their headman or chauthari who is chosen from among their rich and well-to-do families, and punishes breaches of social rules with fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi sect and though seldom careful to say their prayers, they obey the k\u00e1zi and perform all the leading Musalm\u00e1n ceremonies. They pay great respect to the Gulbarga saint by whom their forefathers were converted to Isl\u00e1m and to his descendants. They pay them yearly dues and bury a roll of written paper containing the pedigree of the saint with their dead under the belief that the angels of death Munkir and Nakir will cease to tease the spirit of the dead when they see the paper. A few among them teach their boys to read the Kur\u00e1n and send their boys to school. Two Momins are employed as English clerks and one rich Momin is a Municipal Commissioner at Shol\u00e1pur.\n\nPakh\u00e1lis or Water Carriers, probably descended from local converts from the Hindu caste of the same name, are found in small numbers in towns only. Except that they wear a heavy gold earring, the Pakh\u00e1lis do not differ from ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns in dress, look, speech,\nand customs. The women appear in public, mind the house, and help the men in their work. As a rule Pakh\u00e1lis are clean, neat, hardworking, and orderly. They are water-suppliers and carry water in leather bags on their bullocks' back. They are employed by P\u00e1risis, Musalm\u00e1ns, and Europeans, but their calling is poorly paid and many of the men are given to intoxicating drinks and drugs. They marry among themselves only, and have a separate caste council and headman who settles social disputes with the consent of the majority of the castemen, and punishes breaches of social rules with fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and have strong Hindu leanings, worshipping Hindu gods, keeping Hindu feasts and fasts, and eschewing beef. They do not send their boys to school.\n\nPendh\u00e1ris, found in small numbers in the Shol\u00e1pur cantonment, are descended from converts from mixed Hindu classes, who, before the establishment of British supremacy in India were a dread and plague to the country. They have a mixture of local and Upper Indian blood, and speak a mixture of rough Hindust\u00e1ni M\u00e1lvi and Mar\u00e1thi. As a class they are tall, dark, strong, and well made. The men either shave the head or cut the head hair close, wear the beard full, and dress in a dirty and untidy turban, a shirt, a waistcoat, and a pair of tight trousers or a waistcloth. The women who are rather fairer than the men, wear a dirty Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and add to the family income by selling fuel, grass, eggs, and fowls. Though hardworking they are neither sober nor honest. The men keep ponies and work as servants and labourers. They marry among themselves, and have a separate caste council and a headman or jam\u00e1dd\u00e1r who settles their social disputes at meetings of castemen. They eschew beef and worship Yallamma. In religion they say they are Sunnis of the Hanafi school, and their customs are the same as ordinary Musalm\u00e1n customs. Of late some among them have begun to attend the mosque and to leave worshipping Hindu gods. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits.\n\nPanjn\u00edgars, or Sizers, descended from local converts, are found in small numbers in towns only. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni among themselves and Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese with Hindus. They are dark strong and middle-sized. The men wear the beard full and dress like other Musalm\u00e1ns. The women, who are fairer than the men and regular featured, dress in the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, mind the house, and help the men in their work. Both men and women are clean and neat in their habits. They are hardworking, but given to drinking date-palm juice, and hence are poorly clad and seldom well-to-do. They form a separate body under their headman and marry among themselves only. They call themselves Sunnis of the Hanafi sect but seldom say their prayers. They do not send their children to school.\n\nPatvegars, or Tassel Twisters, descended from local converts of the caste of the same name, are found scattered over the district in small numbers. In look speech and dress they resemble other local Musalm\u00e1ns and are clean and neat in their habits. They are tassel\ntwisters, make silk buttons, deck pearl and gold ornaments with silk, and sell false hair. They hawk their goods about the streets and make 6d. to 2s. (Re. \u00bc -1) a day. They are hardworking, orderly, and thrifty and are fairly off. They form a distinct body under their headman called *chaudhari* and marry among themselves. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school, obey and respect the *k\u0101z\u012b*, and employ him at marriages and deaths, but they seldom say prayers and have strong Hindu leanings. They eschew beef, keep Hindu feasts, and offer vows to Hindu gods and goddesses. They do not send their boys to school but teach them to read the Kur\u00e1n at home. Their calling is well paid and they are a saving class.\n\n**Ra'chbharas**, or Heddle Fillers, probably descended from local converts of the same caste, are found in towns and large villages. They form a distinct branch of Mornins, and are like them in look, speech, dress, and customs. Besides heddle-filling they weave and are hardworking but given to drink and live from hand to mouth. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school but seldom say their prayers and keep Hindu festivals. They do not send their children to school and are badly off.\n\n**Sikalgars**, otherwise called Sikligars or Armourers, descended from local converts of the Loh\u00e1r caste, are found in small numbers all over the district. In look speech and dress they resemble ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns and as a class they are neat and clean in their habits. The women appear in public, mind the house, and help the men in their calling. They sharpen swords, daggers, knives, and other weapons, and are hardworking and thrifty but their labour is in little demand and they are badly off. They marry among themselves and form a distinct body under their headman who is generally chosen from their well-to-do families. Their social and religious customs resemble those of Patvegars and other Musalm\u00e1ns of local origin. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits and are a decaying class.\n\n**Saltangars**, or Tanners, descended from local converts, are found in small numbers in Shol\u00e1pur. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni at home and K\u00e1narese or Mar\u00e1thi abroad, and in work, dress, and social and religious customs are like ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns. As a class they are dirty and untidy in their habits. They buy sheep and goat skins from butchers, tan them, and sell them to Mochis or shoemakers. Their trade has lately suffered much owing to the competition of Labbays. Though hardworking they are given to drink and are poor. They marry among themselves and form a distinct community under their headman or *chaudhari*. Though Sunnis of the Hanafi school they seldom say their prayers and have strong Hindu leanings, keeping the Hindu feasts and offering vows to Hindu gods. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits.\n\n**Ta'mbolis**, or Betel Sellers, local converts of the Kunbi class, are found in considerable numbers in towns and large villages. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni among themselves and Mar\u00e1thi or K\u00e1narese with others. The men are tall or of middle height, and dark or olive skinned. They shave the head, wear the beard full, and dress in a\nMar\u00e1tha turban or headscarf, a waistcoat, and a waistcloth. The women are fairer than the men and wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. They appear in public and help the men in selling betel. As a class T\u00e1mbolis are hardworking, clean, neat, orderly, and thrifty, and many of them are fairly off. They marry only among themselves and have a separate and well organised class union under their headman called p\u00e1t\u00edl who holds caste meetings, settles social disputes, and fines the breakers of caste rules. They have no connection with other Musalm\u00e1ns and eschew beef. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi sect, but worship Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses and make offerings to Mari\u00e1\u00ed, Mhasoba, and Satv\u00e1i. They keep Hindu fasts and feasts but obey their k\u00e1zi and ask him to register their marriages. They do not send their boys to school. Besides betel sellers they are messengers and servants and are well-to-do.\n\nChristians are returned as numbering 625 and as chiefly found in Shol\u00e1pur. Of the 625 Shol\u00e1pur Christians, 158 were Europeans mostly soldiers, sixty-eight Eurasians, and 399 Natives who are mostly converts of the American Mar\u00e1tha Mission.\u00b9 The mission began its work in the district in 1862. To spread Christian knowledge the mission opened schools, kept for sale a large stock of the Holy Scriptures and other Christian books and tracts, and its missionaries preached to the people. By the end of 1877 sixty Hindus were converted, one-fifth of whom were high and middle caste Hindus, and the rest were Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs. At present (1882) Sholapur has three American mission churches one each at Shol\u00e1pur, Dhotre in B\u00e1rsi, and Vatvat in Shol\u00e1pur. The congregations are under two European missionaries aided by twenty-five natives as preachers, pastors, and catechists. Most of the converts have kept their names and surnames; but in naming their children they generally prefer Christian to Hindu names. Persons bearing the same surname intermarry; but close relationship is a bar to marriage. They form one community eating together and intermarrying. But Br\u00e1hman and other high class converts are averse from marrying with families who originally were Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs. They do not differ in food, drink, dress, calling, faith, and customs, from Ahmadnagar Native Christians. Most send their children to school and show signs of improving.\n\nP\u00e1rsis are returned as numbering 157 and as found chiefly in Shol\u00e1pur. As shopkeepers, merchants, and contractors, they are well-to-do and prosperous.\n\nThe organization of village communities varies little in different parts of the district. The duties and position of the deshmukh or district head and the deshp\u00e1nde or district clerk formerly corresponded for a group of villages to the duties of the p\u00e1t\u00edl or village head and the kulkarni or village clerk in one village. Under the British system of land management no duties attach to the offices of deshmukh and deshp\u00e1nde, but under the Summary Settlement Act (VII, of 1863) about two-thirds of their former emoluments\n\n\u00b9 Details are given in the Ahmadnagar Statistical Account.\nhave been continued to the holders of those offices. Such of them as are well-to-do are still respected as men of old family, but division of land has brought most of these families to poverty. The full village staff is composed of the P\u00e1til or headman, the Kulkurni or accountant, the Joshi or astrologer, the Gurav or temple ministrant, the Son\u00e1r or goldsmith, the Sut\u00e1r or carpenter, the Loh\u00e1r or iron-smith, the Parit or washerman, the Nh\u00e1vi or barber, the Kumbh\u00e1r or potter, the Mh\u00e1r or the village watchman and beadle, the M\u00e1ng or scavenger, and the Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1r or shoemaker. Only the largest villages support the full staff of servants. Ordinary villages have a varying number of servants and every village has at least the p\u00e1til, kulkarni, M\u00e1ng, and Mh\u00e1r. The barber, washerman, carpenter, blacksmith, astrologer, and others have often to serve several villages. In the south and south-east of the district where K\u00e1narese is spoken the p\u00e1til is called g\u00e1vda and the accountant is called sh\u00e1nbhog. Since the introduction of the survey rates villagers have neglected to pay the village servants grain allowance or balute, and many village servants have either left their villages or have taken to tillage. Still as most landholders continue to pay the old allowance of grain the community keeps its hold on most of its servants. The population of most Shol\u00e1pur villages is mixed. Some villages are entirely Dhangar settlements, who, though the two classes do not intermarry, can hardly be known from Kunbis. The village clerk or kulkarni and the astrologer or joshi, as a rule, are Br\u00e1hmans. The headman or p\u00e1til is generally a Mar\u00e1tha Kunbi and occasionally a Musalm\u00e1n, Dhangar, Gurav, or Lingayat. M\u00e1ngs, Mh\u00e1rs, Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, and Dhors are not allowed to use the village well; they have generally their own well and when they have no well, they get their water from a Kunbi, or a member of the other classes who has the right to use the village well. When a work of public usefulness, such as repairing the village temple is to be done, a subscription is raised by the richer families, and those who cannot pay in cash pay in labour. But village unions to carry out public works of this kind are gradually becoming rarer. Formerly with few exceptions the villages were surrounded with walls generally of mud. These are now neglected and as a rule are in ruins. There is no distinction between original settlers and new comers. Here and there an inhabitant of one village tills land in another village. The headman receives special honour in most public religious ceremonies. He offers the first cake when the Holi is worshipped during the Shimga holidays in March, his bullocks take the lead in the cattle procession on Pola or Ox Day in August, and on Dasara Day in September-October he is the first to worship the \u00e1pta tree. The women of the headman's family take the first place at all Mar\u00e1tha marriage parties. The headman sometimes, but not often, acts as a moneylender. After the 1876-77 famine the headmen in several cases used their influence to persuade moneylenders to make advances to villagers. But as a rule they never interfere between the lender and the borrower, and the professional moneylender rarely calls in the headman to help him in settling a claim. Religious disputes and disputes regarding the sharing of ancestral property when the amount is not very large,\nare still sometimes referred to village councils. Of late years a large area of land has virtually passed from the husbandman to the moneylender. In many cases the land continues in the village books in the husbandman's name, but the rent is paid by the moneylender to whom the land has been mortgaged.\n\nThere is little movement either out of or into the district.\\(^1\\) During the 1876-77 famine an unsuccessful attempt was made to persuade husbandmen to settle in the Husangabad district of the Central Provinces. At the same time large numbers moved to the B\u00e1lg\u00e1gh\u00e1t districts of the Niz\u00e1m's country, and many are believed to have remained there. Almost the only class who leave the district in search of work are educated youths chiefly Br\u00e1hmans, who take service in the Niz\u00e1m's state. The number of wandering tribes and of wandering carriers is small.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The 1881 census shows that 41,572 people born in Shol\u00e1pur were in that year found in different parts of the Bombay Presidency. The details are: Poona 10,552, Bombay City 8769, Bij\u00e1pur 5260, Ahmadnagar 5243, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra 3998, Kh\u00e1ndesh 1950, Th\u00e1na 1526, Belgaum 1390, N\u00e1sik 1056, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r 587, Ratn\u00e1giri 383, K\u00e1nara 267, Kol\u00e1ba 248, Surat 190, Ahmadabad 95, Aden 28, Broach 14, Panch Mah\u00e1l 13, and Kaira 3.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census, agriculture supports about 389,000 people or 66 per cent of the population. The details are:\n\n| Age          | Males | Females | Total |\n|--------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Under Fifteen| 74,484| 69,697  | 144,181|\n| Over Fifteen | 122,514| 122,629 | 245,043|\n| Total        | 196,998| 192,226 | 389,224|\n\nIt may be roughly estimated that about forty per cent of the husbandmen are Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, about thirty per cent Lingayats, about twenty-five per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, Dhangars, Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and other low-caste persons, and the remaining five per cent Br\u00e1hmans, Gujars, and M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris. The higher class live in houses built of stone and mortar, but most live in mud dwellings with walls and roofs supported by rough beams and rafters. Only the poorest and lowest live in thatched huts. Their house furniture in all cases is of the simplest; that of the better classes being distinguished from the lowest only by the number and size of their cooking and washing vessels. They may also have a bed or two and cupboards to contain their valuables. Their surplus money is spent more on personal adornment, in clothes and jewelry, than in embellishing their houses. The higher classes have their grain stored in pits within the village limits. Great quantities of grain are kept in this way, the pits being opened only when prices are high enough to give a large profit. Middle class landholders usually keep in reserve grain enough to last them for a year or more, while the poorer husbandmen in average seasons have only enough to last them a few months. The villagers are not only unschooled but dull. They are careful not to neglect rites and observances and most of them are much under the influence of their priests whether Br\u00e1hmans or Jangams. The women are chaste and drunkenness and crime are rare. The landholding classes are essentially conservative. What is customary, what has come down to them from their fathers, is sacred and right. Changes on local usages they strongly resent. On the whole they lead a remarkably simple, frugal, sober, and contented life. Their occasional bursts of extravagance are connected with religious rites, births, marriages, and deaths. On these occasions social usage forces a man to spend beyond his\n\n1 Mr. H. Woodward, C. S.\nmeans, and debt thus contracted is held creditable and a proof of respectability. Of late years, owing to the restriction of loans caused by the provisions of the Relief Act of 1879, these ceremonies have been conducted on a far less pretentious scale than formerly, and the expenses connected with them have markedly decreased. As husbandmen they may be said to make as much out of the soil as their circumstances admit. They may be divided into three groups, high, middle, and low. The higher class embraces holders of large areas mostly of superior soil with adequate stock and field tools. Some of their land is usually watered and the owners have a small capital either inherited or saved. These form about ten per cent of the landholding class, and are solvent and independent. The middle class includes holders of fifty to hundred acres of middling land who own two to four pairs of bullocks. The best land in their holdings is usually sold or mortgaged. The tillage of their holdings shows intelligence and industry. By sowing a variety of crops, as a rule they manage to set the gains of some against the losses of others. Only in seasons when all crops fail, does their condition become critical. This middle class includes about forty per cent of the landholders. The remaining fifty per cent till petty holdings of not more than forty acres and sometimes of as little as five. Members of this class have usually one pair of bullocks, sometimes only one bullock, and often no bullocks at all. In tilling their land they are helped by their neighbours or kinsfolk, whom they repay out of the crop or by labour. Even in average seasons wretched crops are the result of their wretched tillage.\n\nIn garden land manure is always used, and it is used in dry-crop land when it is available. The usual mode of manuring a field is by turning into it a flock of sheep and goats, for whose services their owner is paid according to the length of their stay. For some crops as wheat, unless the supply of water is abundant, dung the only readily available form of manure is found to render the ground too hot for the proper sprouting of the seed. Scarcity of manure is the main reason why so little land is watered compared with the area commanded by the Ekruk lake and other water works. A well-to-do farmer ploughs his land several times before he sows it, and he weeds it several times while the crop is growing. Though the tillage is generally rude it seems thoroughly fitted to the soil and to the means of those who practise it. Five field tools are in almost universal use, the plough or n\u00e1ngar which is of various sizes, the kulav or harrow, the seed drill or tiphan, the seed-harrow or r\u00e1smi, and the weeder or kolpa. An irregular rotation of crops is observed and about a fifth or a sixth of the holding is often left unsown. As a rule the poorer landholders neither weed nor manure their land. They run a light plough over it, sow the seed broadcast, and leave it to itself. They expect to get from it at the best merely a bare food supply for the year, and while the crop is ripening, have to supplement their field profits by the wages of labour. Much of the best land is in the hands of moneylenders who have either bought it or taken it on mortgage. The moneylenders do not themselves till, but put in tenants, usually the former owners under\nthe terms of a lease. In cases of sale or mortgage between cultivator and cultivator the case is different. The former owner is ousted as the buyer or mortgagee takes possession and himself tills the land. The poorest land is seldom mortgaged, as no one cares to accept as security for a loan. The poor landholder is thus often forced to sell. The tendency seems to be for the petty landholders to diminish in number and the land to fall into the hands of men of capital who employ the old holders as their tenants or labourers. The higher class husbandmen are usually also merchants, dealing in cotton, cloth and grain, and lending money. The middle class usually devote the whole of their time and energies to agriculture. The women of the house weave coarse stuffs or prepare cotton yarn and from the profits buy clothes for themselves and the men of the house acquire petty comforts. The women take pride in providing these things by their unaided efforts. When not engaged in the fields, middle class husbandmen employ their carts and bullocks in the carryin trade which in certain parts of the district is large and profitable. Even in average seasons the lower class of husbandmen are usually obliged to eke out the profits of their land by working for hire. After deductions on account of assessment, cost of cultivation, and customary payments to village craftsmen and other claimants, the returns from their badly-tilled, neglected, and exhausted land do not suffice for more than a bare grain-food supply. Though he often holds more than he is able to till if he can help it, nothing will induce the landholder to give up his land. He keeps to his village and prefers to work within reach of its limits on half the wages he could earn further away. Unless driven by want he never deserts his home in search of labour. On the first chance he returns with his small savings and boldly makes a fresh attempt at tillage.\n\nIndividuals of the higher class are often out of debt and indeed have never incurred debt. Though sometimes indebted, they are well able to meet their liabilities and may be considered solvent and prosperous. Their debt, if they have any debt, may almost always be traced to expenditure connected with religious and social rites as is prompted rather by a love of show than by necessity. The best land of middle class holders is usually sold or mortgaged as security for loans. Under the conditions which existed before the Ryot Relief Act the middle and lower class landholders, who together form about ninety per cent of the rural population, acquired the habit of applying to the moneylender to meet all agricultural and other wants. That the ease with which loans could be obtained has often been the one main inducement to borrow, and that easy borrowing has brought foolish spending is obvious. At the same time it must be admitted that necessity often constrains the borrower. Failure of crops whole or partial, the death or the aging of cattle, pressure for the payment of the Government rental, want of grain for seed and for food, and the performance of recurring religious and social ceremonies, these emergencies constantly arise and they can be met only by a loan. These and numerous other personal and miscellaneous wants can be satisfied only by one whose thorough local knowledge of the circumstances of each individual with whom\nhe deals enables him to render the required assistance promptly and effectively as the need arises. One chief reason why tagai advances from Government have been comparatively unsought, is that they cannot be obtained at once and on the spot. Months may pass before the landholder receives the money he has applied for, and often, when he gets it, the need for it no longer exists. It may be accepted that only about ten per cent of the agricultural classes are free from debt, and that the remaining ninety per cent are involved, advances from time to time under some shape being a necessity to them. The Relief Act, by protecting their property from attachment and sale for debt, has doubtless rendered this necessity less urgent. Still in seasons of scarcity which recur almost every third year in Sholapur, the need will arise; and, in the absence of the moneylender, who naturally holds his hand, will have to be met by the State. Credit loans are made on rates varying from eighteen to $37\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent according to the solvency of the borrower, and secured loans at half those rates. The relief measures have not affected the rate at which money is lent, but have induced circumspection in lending. Pledges of valuables are the most acceptable form of security, while loans on house property command higher rates, owing to possible depreciation in the value of the security, difficulty of finding tenants, and of realisation of advances by sale.\n\nThe effects of the 1876 and 1877 famine are still (1883) noticeable in the poverty of the people and in their diminished numbers. As a rule they are badly fed, housed, and clothed. Half of them are ruined by one season of drought and they have no resources to fall back on. In most villages dwellings still (1883) lie in ruins untenanted since they were deserted by their starving owners. Compared with 1872 the census figures of 1881 show in B\u00e1rsi and Sholapur a fall of 50,000 or about one-sixth, and, since the famine, a considerable area of land in holdings on which assessment is levied has remained unsown. Sometimes the land is kept fallow or for pasturage, but the want of tillage is more often due to want of means to cultivate. The owner keeps on hoping for a bumper crop or some access of fortune which never comes by which he will be enabled to bring all his land under the plough. The last thing he thinks of is to resign any portion of his holding. He would not perhaps get it again when he wanted it. This clinging to his land involves a heavy loss to the landholders. In addition to the land which is paid for and not tilled the returns of arable waste show an increase of about 40,000 acres in Sholapur and of about 4000 acres in B\u00e1rsi over the arable waste before the famine. At the same time the large area of arable waste in the Sholapur sub-division is hardly a safe test of the poverty of the landholding class. Much land which lapsed to Government owing to default during the famine season has not since been given out for cultivation. Applications for it are numerous, but, pending forest settlement, are held in abeyance. Still it may be affirmed that losses to cultivation sustained during the years of famine have not been fully retrieved. The value of land is low, as shown by the insignificant sums realized at the auction sales of occupancy rights. The bodily effects on the people are no longer apparent. The sick\nand weakly who lingered after the famine have either died or recovered. Births have resumed their normal excess over deaths. In recent years food has been abundant and cheap while the wages of labour have been high.\n\nAs has already been noticed, during the last ten or twenty years there has been a marked tendency for the land to fall into the hands of men of capital whether of the cultivating or non-cultivating class. Most of the best land has passed to them by mortgage or sale. They alone could afford to hold these lands and pay the assessment on them during the years of famine between 1876 and 1879. During those years many transfers were effected. The former owners have sunk to rack-rented tenants or farm labourers and the number of registered occupants has greatly diminished. Under the Relief Act a small percentage of mortgagors will succeed in recovering their mortgaged lands, but the operation of the Act will probably in the end result in still further transfers to the moneyed class. The poorer landholders must have loans and an out-surrender of their land is the only effectual form of security they can now command. So long as the seasons continue favourable they will be spared the necessity of borrowing, but with bad years the necessity will return. During the last few years many petty money-lenders have given up their former calling and devoted themselves and their capital wholly to agriculture. This again will reduce the number of tenants and force them to the status of labourers.\n\nOf an area of 2,348,731 acres, 2,646,136 acres or 92\u00b788 per cent are in 663 Government villages and 202,595 acres or 7\u00b712 per cent in 54 alienated villages. The Government lands have been all surveyed and of the lands in alienated villages 132,696 acres have been surveyed. Of the 2,646,136 acres of Government land, 2,400,243 acres or 90\u00b770 per cent are arable, 155,709 acres or 5\u00b788 per cent unarable, 5,449 acres or 0\u00b721 per cent grass or kuran; 29,553 acres or 1\u00b712 per cent forest; and 55,182 acres or 2\u00b709 per cent village sites, roads, and river beds. Of the 2,400,243 acres of arable land in Government villages 215,115 or 8\u00b796 per cent are alienated. Of the whole arable area of 2,400,243 acres, 1,873,098 acres or 78\u00b703 per cent were in 1882-83 under tillage. Of this 62,382 acres or 3\u00b733 per cent were garden land, 2854 acres or 0\u00b716 per cent were rice land, and 1,807,862 acres or 96\u00b751 per cent were dry crop land.\n\nIn 1882-83, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 49,656 with an average area of about forty-eight acres. Of the whole number, 2837 were holdings of not more than five acres, 3270 were of six to ten acres, 9479 of eleven to twenty acres, 22,104 of twenty-one to fifty acres; 8190 of fifty-one to 100 acres; 2622 of 101 to 200 acres; 505 of 201 to 300 acres, 149 of 301 to 400 acres; and 97 of above 400 acres. The occupants who have holdings of over 100 acres are Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, Gujars, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Dhangars. As a rule the Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, and Gujars sublet their holdings.\n\nAccording to the Collector's yearly returns the 1882-83 field stock included 20,493 ploughs, 11,569 carts of which 835 were\nriding carts and 10,734 were used in carrying loads, 192,733 bullocks, 101,318 cows, 55,523 buffaloes of which 33,716 were females and 21,807 males, 10,292 horses mares and colts, 4480 donkeys, 418,240 sheep and goats, and 40 camels.\n\nThe soil of Sholapur is of three kinds, kali or black, barad or coarse gray, and timbdii or reddish. Except in Barsi where black soil is the rule and coarse gray is rare, most of the district is either gray or red. As there are few table lands, the black soil is almost confined to the banks of rivers and large streams. Most of the black soil is stiff and clayey, though near the meeting of the Bhima and Sina in the Sholapur sub-division it is particularly fine. Of three main divisions of soil the black has three varieties, pure black, morvandi and chopan or chikan that is loamy; the barad or gray has three varieties, pandhar or white, barad or coarse gray, and chunkhadi or limy; and the tambdi or red has two varieties, gada and pure tambdi or reddish. Of the three varieties of black soil the pure black is generally found in flat plots. The soil is perfectly black and free from sand or stones. When mixed with water it swells and is very soft to the touch. However abundant the rainfall, it soaks in the whole of the rain and does not allow it to flow off or to stagnate. When the rains are over it does not crack. For a depth of about seven feet below the surface the soil is found of the same quality; below this is either water or a rocky black stratum. This soil does not need an abundant supply of fresh water. With one heavy shower good crops grow even though the later rains fail. This soil is generally used for rabi or cold weather crops such as jondhala that is Indian millet and gram. It is seldom suited for kharif or rain crops, and among rain crops, only for cotton, kardai or safflower, and tur or Cajanus indicus. Of garden crops, groundnuts, even if not constantly watered, thrive in this soil. In a few parts of the district this pure black soil occurs in whole numbers. In most places the black soil occurs as small patches in gray and red fields. A mixture of this black is required before red or gray soils can be fertile. Pure black soil is not difficult to plough and the seed grows surely and rapidly. The morvandi soil is found away from river banks and streams. It is less black and soft to the touch than the pure black soil, but like pure black, it is altogether free from a whitish or reddish element. In this soil occur a black sandy substance and flat pieces of white reddish or black flint, as large as small lemons. The soil is two to three feet deep; below it are white and black layers of rock coloured like burnt black bricks. This soil does not need heavy showers. It is generally sown when a short rainfall seems likely. If the seedling once takes it needs no more water than the natural moisture of the soil. Morvandi soil is easily ploughed. It is well suited for gram, and is used only for rabi or cold weather crops such as jondhala or Indian millet, gram, safflower, and barley. In years of heavy rainfall this soil does not yield good crops; otherwise the growth of the crops is speedy and certain. When the rain fails the surface gapes in large deep cracks. The pieces of flint which occur in this soil seem to help it to keep its moisture. Chopan or chikan that is\nloamy soil is found within a mile or two of river banks and streams. It is mixed white and black, the white element being not very noticeable. Under this loam which is often as much as fifteen to twenty feet deep, lies a layer of rock. It is saltish and free from stones or sand. It is soft to the touch, even softer than the pure black. It is very hard and does not easily yield either to the plough or to the rain. It grows wheat and Indian millet jondhala, and during the rains, it can grow bajri. When the rains cease the soil gapes in large cracks and fissures, often fifteen to twenty feet deep; these serve as village granaries, and keep grain ten to twenty years without spoiling. An inferior but widely used salt used to be made from this soil, but since the passing of the Salt Act (Act VII. of 1873) the manufacture has been stopped. Of the three varieties of barad soil the pandhar or white is generally found near villages, seldom far from the village site or gavthan. It is never found near the banks of rivers or streams. It is whitish, saltish, and free from stones or sand. When mixed with water it does not swell and is hard to the touch. It is not sticky and can be easily worked by water. This soil is found to a depth of four or five feet, below which comes a layer of rock. It does not easily yield to the plough. With constant water it grows tobacco, wheat, chillies, and fruit trees. Though a useful soil it is so hard to work that it is often left waste, or used in making unfired bricks, building walls, plastering roofs, and in making sora or saltpetre. Barad or coarse gray soil is found on the slopes of high lands. It is whitish and reddish and much mixed with murum or crumbly trap. A layer of pure barad soil is rarely found more than one foot deep; below this is a layer of crumbly trap mixed with sand, earth, and small brittle stones which under pressure turn to dust. It is formed of different substances washed out of the rocks. When mixed with water it becomes solid. It is not sticky and can be easily pulverised. It requires constant showers, and if the rains hold off for a week becomes dry and useless. Cold weather crops are rarely grown in barad or coarse gray soil, and of the rain crops red Indian millet called jogdi alone does well. Chunkhadi or lime-laden soil is found on the tops of high lands. It is whiter than the coarse gray or barad and has a strong limestone element. Even on the surface this soil is not unmixed with lime. About a foot below the surface is a layer of soft murum or crumbly trap which is less red than the murum found under gray soil. It needs constant water. It is never used for rabi or cold weather crops. Of the kharif or rain crops it is best suited to hulga or Dolichos biflorus. Of the two varieties of tambdi or red soil the gada is chiefly found in hollows near river banks and streams. It is reddish and free from stones and sand. The soil is five to six feet deep, below which is a layer of sand. When wet it becomes very soft. It does not yield salt and does not crack when dry. During the rains gada soil is constantly liable to be washed by floods. As it consists of fine earth deposited from running or standing water the gada soil is rich, and is very favourable to the growth of trees, plants, and vegetables. Grass of excellent quality grows readily on this\nsoil. The soil is not hard to the plough and is well fitted for rabi or cold weather crops. Of the crops grown on it Indian millet or jondhala and castor seed or erandi thrive best. It does not want a constant supply of moisture and with one heavy shower yields a good crop. In yield it comes next to the best black soil. It is the soil most used by potters in making earthen vessels. Pure red or t\u00e2mbdi soil is generally found on the tops and slopes of high lands, much mixed with small soft stones. It does not remain pure for more than half a foot from the surface. About a foot from the surface comes a layer of soft murum or crumbly trap which is easily ground to powder. It is well fitted for growing mangoes and other fruit trees, especially the plantain. Of the rain crops b\u00e2jri, til, mugi, and matki thrive best in this soil. Cold weather crops are sometimes grown but the outturn is small.\n\nThe chief field tools are the plough or n\u00e2ngar, the harrow or kulav, the rake or phan, the bullock hoe or kolpa, the drill or tiphan, the seedharrow or r\u00e2sni, the small pickaxe or kudal, the spade or khore, the hand rake or d\u00e2t\u00e2le, the grubbing hoe or khurpe, the crowbar or pah\u00e2r, the axe or kurh\u00e2d, the sickle or vila, and the sling or gophan. The plough is made of b\u00e2bhul wood curved on one side whose end is covered with movable iron plating. The beam is pierced with a central hole in which a wooden pole five to six feet long is fixed. A tapering piece of wood is also fixed to the bar which serves both as a handle and to press the plough into the soil. In the Pandharpur, M\u00e2lsiras, and S\u00e2ngola sub-divisions in the south and west ploughs are often drawn three to five inches deep by two to four bullocks in the m\u00e1l or high and the barad or gravelly soils; in the Shol\u00e2pur, B\u00e2rsi, Karm\u00e2la, and M\u00e2dha sub-divisions in the east and north they are drawn twelve to fifteen inches deep by eight to ten bullocks in deep black soil. The plough costs about \u00a32 (Rs. 20). The harrow or kulav is a beam of wood about three feet long with two holes pierced on the under-face near the ends. In each of the holes is fixed a spar of wood about a foot and a half long and between the ends of the two spars runs an iron blade three inches broad and nearly three feet long. Into the wooden beam is thrust a pole six to seven feet long and to the pole a handle is fixed. While the harrow is in motion the driver stands on the beam and holds fast the handle. The kulav costs about 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd). The rake or phan consists of a wooden headpiece in which iron-cased wooden teeth are fixed and a long handle set in a hole in the middle of the beam. The phan costs about 4s. (Rs. 2). The weeding harrow or kolpa is a beam of wood three feet long pierced with a wooden pole in the middle and with two small holes one on each side of the pole. In each of these holes is a small spar of wood whose end is armed with sickle-shaped iron blades fit to cut grass and weeds. A small bar of wood fastened into the beam serves as a handle. Except that it has two curved instead of several straight teeth the kolpa differs little from the phan or rake. The kolpa costs about 3s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00be). The seed-drill or tiphan consists of a heavy b\u00e2bhul beam 3\u00bc feet long and 2\u00be feet round. Its transverse section is a square. It is provided with three tines with interspaces of eleven or twelve inches. The tines project forwards\nand downwards and are pierced in the centre of the exposed portion by holes which receive the bamboo seed tubes. These meet above the beam and are there brought together by a cup-shaped receiver, into which the seed is poured by the hand of the sower. The bottom of the cup communicates by holes with each seed tube. The pointed coulters make the seed drill, and each is directly before the lower mouth of its seed tube. The lines of the drills are kept straight by making the off-bullock on the return journey travel on the outside drill of the three made in the first. The seed-harrow or r\u0101sni is a light harrow very like the kulav except that the beam and knife are much longer and lighter. The knife is three feet long and the beam about 3\u00bd to four feet. It follows the seed drill to cover up the seed and level the ground. It costs about 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd). Of smaller tools, the crowbar costs about 2s. (Re. 1), the pickaxe, axe, spade, and sling each about 1s. (8 as.), the hand rake or d\u0101t\u0101le and the sickle each about 6d. (4 as.), and the grubbing hoe about 3d. (2 as.).\n\nShol\u00e1pur has seven water works, of which three the Koregaon Ashti and Ekruk lakes supply tillage water, and four at Shol\u00e1pur B\u0101rsi Karm\u0101la and Pandharpur supply drinking water. Of the three tillage water works the Koregaon lake is an old work improved and the Ashti and Ekruk lakes are new works.\n\nThe Koregaon lake lies thirteen miles north-east of B\u0101rsi and is formed by throwing two earthen dams across two separate valleys. The larger dam on the west is 995 feet long and seventy-one feet high in the centre, and the smaller dam on the south-east is 300 feet long with a greatest height of twelve feet. The drainage area is 4\u00be square miles. The original depth of the lake near the dam seems to have been fifty feet, but several centuries of silt have much lessened its depth and reduced its storage capacity. Between 1855 and 1858, under the orders of the Collector, the full supply level was raised nine feet which led to the building of the smaller dam. As the dams were of inferior materials, the increased head of water in the lake caused great leakage. Surveys made in 1863 showed a greatest depth of twenty-one feet, a mean depth of thirteen feet, and an area of 7,406,312 square feet or 170 acres. In 1864 and 1865 steps were taken to stop the leakage. These repairs included the entire rebuilding of the front of the larger dam for a depth of thirty feet that is to below low-water level, and the making of a puddle trench, twelve feet deep and three feet wide, along the whole length of the smaller dam. In September 1870 the smaller dam was breached, and the efficiency of the work was greatly impaired. It has for several years past (1878) been proposed to restore the work by repairing the larger dam and by building on the site of the smaller dam a waste-weir, 435 feet long, of concrete faced with rubble masonry, and by making new outlet arrangements consisting of a twelve-inch pipe, fitted with a sluice valve of the ordinary pattern. The lake will then have a depth of fourteen feet from outlet to full supply, an available capacity of 81,298,114 cubic feet, and a full supply area of 8,793,017 square feet or 202 acres. A run-off of eight inches would fill the lake, and it is estimated that,\nafter deducting fourteen millions of cubic feet for evaporation, one filling would suffice to water 970 acres of rabi or cold weather crops. The restoration is estimated to cost about \u00a3983 (Rs. 9830), or, including establishment and other charges, about \u00a31200 (Rs. 12,000). In 1882-83 the lake watered 84\u00bd acres in the village of Koregaon which paid \u00a317 8s. (Rs. 174) for water rates. Of the 84\u00bd watered acres nineteen grew groundnut, eight turmeric, 7\u00bc sugarcane, thirty-five ju\u00e1ri, thirteen wheat, and 2\u00bd gram.\n\nThe Ashti lake lies in the M\u0101dha sub-division twelve miles northeast of the large town of Pandharpur. The project was originally drawn up in 1869 by Major Penny, R. E. The lake is formed by throwing across the Ashti stream, a feeder of the Bhima, an earthen dam 12,709 feet long, with a greatest height of 57\u00b775 feet. The lake when full has an area of rather more than four square miles and holds 1,499,470,085 cubic feet of water. From this lake two canals are led. The left bank canal, which is 11\u00bd miles long, discharges thirty cubic feet a second and commands 12,258 acres; the right bank canal, which is ten miles long, discharges ten cubic feet a second, and commands 5624 acres. The land commanded is chiefly in the Pandharpur sub-division which has an arable area of 221,066 acres. Of this area 8823 acres or four per cent were generally watered, chiefly by wells. The lake supply is sufficient to water 10,809 acres in regular rotation, thus raising the arable area under command from four to nine per cent of the whole cultivated area. The dam is entirely of earth and of the usual section with a top width of six feet at reduced level 244, that is 1561 feet above mean sea level. The slopes are one and half to one down to reduced level 232 which is the full supply level. Below this the inner slope is made at three to one, and the outer slope at two to one. A puddle trench ten feet thick runs throughout the length of the dam, being founded everywhere on rock or other impermeable strata. In addition a concrete wall, five feet thick, has been built at the river crossing, founded on rock and running well into the banks on both sides. The concrete wall is under the centre of the dam, and the puddle trench is put forward parallel to and twenty feet in front of the wall and brought in again on both sides to join the centre line, thirty feet from the end of the concrete wall. For this length puddle trenches, seven feet wide, run on each side of the concrete wall, and then the width is gradually reduced till ten feet is reached, and with this width the puddle trench is carried to the ends of the dam. The exposed portions of the dam are guarded from wear by a mixture of crumbly trap and earth. The inner slope is pitched between reduced level 205 and 240 with stone varying in thickness from six to twelve inches. The whole dam was built in six-inch layers, well watered and rammed. A waste weir, with crest at 232 and 800 feet wide, is formed by cutting through a saddle on the right bank of the lake. The discharging capacity is 48,000 cubic feet a second, equal to a run-off of 0\u00b780 of an inch the hour from the drainage area of ninety-two square miles. The height to which such a flood would rise is seven feet above the crest of the weir and five feet below the top of the\ndam. The side slopes in both canals are uniformly one and a half to one, except in the tenth mile right bank canal where they are one to one. All flood water is passed under the canals by aqueducts, or above them by over-passages which also serve as accommodation bridges during the dry weather. The outlet and regulating works for the left bank canal include a head wall, on the face of which are arranged the lifting gear of two cast-iron valves, through which the water is discharged into a tunnel, by which it is passed under the dam into a discharging basin, constructed at the head of the canal. The head wall is of coursed rubble masonry, with a cornice of neatly dressed Ashlar work, one and a half feet high. The length at bottom is eighteen feet and the breadth 10\u00bd feet. The front face is vertical with two recesses, finished off at the top with relieving arches, to admit of working the lifting gear. The rear face is stepped in gradually by three one-foot offsets and one of 1\u00bd feet. The sides are carried up vertically for twelve feet and are then given a batter of one in twelve to the top. The height of the wall is 33\u00b75 feet, and the reduced level at top is 241 or three feet below the formation level of the dam. The cornice projects 1\u00be feet beyond the wall proper, and the platform on the top is thus 8\u00be feet by 17\u00bc. This platform is joined to the dam by a simple foot bridge of two plate girders with teak flooring. The clear span is twenty-two feet and the breadth four feet. It rests on the platform at one end, and, at the other, on an earthwork bank thrown out from the dam to receive it. Cast-iron standards and hand rails are provided on both sides of the bridge and round the platform. There are two two-feet square sluice valves. The frame on which the valves work is of cast-iron fixed to the masonry by bolts and furnished with iron guides for the valves. Each valve is worked by a hollow cast-iron screw column attached to the valves by lifting rods. A male screw fixed to the capstan on the top works in this column, lifting and lowering it and the valves. Thrust blocks are provided, and pedestals at five feet centres guide the lifting rods. In passing through the sluices the water is received into a conical egg-shaped tunnel, with a major axis of 10\u00b779 feet and a minor of eight feet. This section gradually decreases for ten feet in length, and then joins the tunnel proper which also is egg-shaped and six by four feet with a uniform thickness of 1\u00bd feet. The larger end is at the bottom and not at the top, as is the custom in sewage works, where a large velocity with a small head is indispensable. To prevent the creep of water between the tunnel and the earthwork, three concrete rings have been constructed round the tunnel passing 1\u00bd to three feet into the earthwork. The discharging chamber, twenty-four feet by twelve has been provided to reduce the speed of the water before it is passed into the canal. This chamber is four feet wide at its meeting with the tunnel and six feet wide at the head of the canal. The head works of the right bank canal are almost the same as those of the left bank canal; but as the required discharge is only one-third of what is necessary for the left bank canal, all parts of the work are of a smaller size. Three circular valves twelve inches in diameter, of the ordinary pattern, have been provided, arranged\nin two tiers, with two valves below and one above. The lake was completed on the 31st of July 1881 at a cost of \u00a333,499 (Rs. 3,34,990). The dam was begun on the 1st of December 1876 as a famine relief work. The greatest number of famine labourers employed on any one day was 19,949. The total expenditure on relief work was about \u00a330,962 (Rs. 3,09,620), including payments to children and charitable relief. The work done was worth \u00a314,628 (Rs. 1,46,280) at normal rates, that is a loss of \u00a316,334 (Rs. 1,63,340) on the relief element of the work. The work was finally closed as a famine relief on the 30th of November 1877. From the 16th of July 1878 to the 5th of February 1882 a gang of convicts was employed in making the dam, laying the pitching, and clearing the waste weir channel. The convicts also did all the earthwork for fifteen miles of the canals. The greatest number of convicts employed was 1110. In 1882-83, of 15,418 acres, the whole arable area under command, 248 were watered and paid about \u00a390 (Rs. 900) for water rates. Of these 248 watered acres thirty-four were poor rice, thirty-three sh\u00e1l\u00fa or Indian millet, forty-five wheat, fifty-two groundnut, eighteen sugarcane, twenty chillies, fourteen tobacco, and the rest miscellaneous crops. The water rates charged were \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12) the acre for twelve months crops, 8s. (Rs. 4) for eight months crops, 4s. (Rs. 2) for four months or cold weather crops, 2s. (Re. 1) for dry or rain crops, and 8s. (Rs. 4) for hot weather crops. For watering by lifts half rates were charged.\n\nThe Ekruk Lake, the largest artificial lake in the Bombay Presidency, lies five miles north-east of Shol\u00e1pur. The scheme was prepared in 1863 and sanctioned in 1866. It comprises a reservoir formed by an earthen dam 7200 feet long and seventy-two feet in greatest height and three canals. The dam is thrown across the valley of the Adhila, a feeder of the Sina, which has a drainage area of 160 square miles above the lake. The lake is sixty feet deep when full, and holds 3350 millions of cubic feet. The area of water surface is 4640 acres or 7\u00bc square miles. Two waste weirs, together 750 feet long, are provided for the escape of flood water after the lake is full. Of the canals one on each bank is at a high level, designed for four months\u2019 watering, and the third on the left bank is at a low level, designed for a twelve months\u2019 discharge. Of the two high level canals the right bank canal is eighteen miles long, discharges sixty cubic feet a second, and commands 565 acres; and the left bank canal is four miles long, discharges twenty-five cubic feet a second, and commands 856 acres. The low level left bank canal is twenty-six miles long, discharges seventy cubic feet a second, and commands 10,601 gross acres. The canals are bridged and regulated throughout, and can be lengthened so as to command a larger area. The low level canal flows close past the town of Shol\u00e1pur. The work was begun in 1866, and the dam was closed in December 1869. Some water was supplied to the kharif or rain crop of 1871-72. At the end of 1876-77 the work was completed, except the masonry heads to distributaries and the last two miles of the low level canal and the last twelve miles of the high level right bank canal. By the end of 1881-82 all the works connected with the Ekruk lake were completed at a total cost of about \u00a3121,262 (Rs. 12,12,620). In 1882-83, of\n15,820 acres, the arable area under command, 1306 were watered and paid \u00a3524 (Rs. 5240) for water rates. Of these 1306 watered acres 395 were for wheat, 145 for inferior rice, forty-eight for ju\u00e1ri, thirty-nine for gram, 236 for groundnut, 173 for sugarcane, fifty-seven for fruit and flower trees, forty-eight for vegetables, fifty-seven for chillies, thirteen for turmeric, and the rest for miscellaneous crops. Besides tillage water, the Ekruk lake supplies drinking water to the town of Shol\u00e1pur.\n\nOf the four town water works the Shol\u00e1pur water works were designed and completed by Mr. C. T. Burke, B.E., executive engineer. They were begun in November 1878 and opened in March 1881. The highest daily demand of water was estimated at five gallons a head for a population of 50,666, or 253,330 gallons. The water is drawn from the low level canal of the Ekruk lake in the fifth mile, into a settling pond 146 feet square at the floor and 148 feet square at top. The depth of water is 10'4 and that available 9'6 feet. The capacity is 1,292,705 gallons or 5'1 days of the estimated supply. The settling tank is provided with a scouring pipe nine inches in diameter fitted with a sluice valve. The water is drawn from this pond through two suction pipes by two of Tangye Brothers and Holman's special steam pumps. These pumps are direct-acting and capable of being worked separately or combined. They can each deliver 200,000 gallons in ten hours into the high level reservoir, that is an elevation of 160 feet through a line of piping ten inches in diameter and 8500 feet long. Each pump has a steam cylinder eighteen inches, and a water cylinder ten inches in diameter, both having a stroke of thirty-six inches. The water cylinder is lined with brass. Cast-iron air vessels of ten times the capacity of the barrel of the pump are fixed, one on the supply and the other on the delivery main, to equalize the flow of water. They are provided with air pumps and relief valves. The two boilers are of the Cornish type with six Galloway tubes in the flue. They are twenty-eight feet long, 5\u00bd feet in diameter, and have steam domes three feet high and 2\u00bd feet in diameter. Suitable engine house, boiler room, and fuel shed have been provided near the settling pond. The water is pumped into two service reservoirs with floors at eighty-six feet and 58\u00bd feet above that of the settling pond; from these it is distributed by sub-main and branch pipes to all parts of the town and suburbs. The high level reservoir is designed to supply the Sakharpeth and the suburbs, and the low level reservoir supplies the rest of the town. The low level reservoir is circular having arched radial walls which support a roof of galvanized corrugated iron. Of the chief dimensions the internal diameter at floor level is eighty-two feet and at full supply 85\u00bd feet; the depth of water is twelve feet. The available capacity is 68,711 cubic feet or 429,133 gallons, equivalent to 1\u00b769 days of the estimated supply. The floor and foundations are of concrete founded on rock. The external or main wall is of carefully executed uncoursed rubble masonry, with a face of coursed rubble in six inch courses. The thickness on top is 2\u00bd feet and at bottom six feet, the total height being ten feet. The inner face has a batter or slope of one in twelve, and the external surface is formed with a curve of seventeen feet radius.\nThe high level reservoir is similar in design, but larger than the low level reservoir, having an available capacity of 88,193 cubic feet or 549,442 gallons. The diameters of the distributing pipes have been carefully adapted to the work required of each; for a length of 10,530 feet these pipes are six inches in diameter, for 9969 feet four inches, and for 12,737 feet three inches. Sluice valves have been fixed upon all pipes so as to render each part of the distribution independent of the rest. The actual delivery of water for use is made from sixty-eight stand-posts fitted with push cocks and erected at convenient points throughout the town. The whole work cost \u00a321,718 8s. (Rs. 2,17,184), which were paid by the Shol\u00e1pur municipality. After being maintained by the public works department for six months, the work was handed to the municipality in September 1881. In 1881-82 the quantity of water used was 15,846,725 cubic feet, and the rate charged was 2s. (Re. 1) for every 10,000 cubic feet of water delivered into the settling pond.\n\nTo supply drinking water to B\u00e1rsi a storage reservoir was built close to the town in 1877 at a cost of \u00a32825 (Rs. 28,250). It is designed to contain nineteen millions of cubic feet, and has a drainage area of 1\u00bd square miles and a surface area of sixty-five acres.\n\nTo supply drinking water to Karm\u00e1la the water from springs in wells lying about three quarters of a mile to the south of the town is carried through an earthenware conduit to dipping wells at convenient sites. The water works were completed in 1877 at a cost of about \u00a3235 (Rs. 2350) which was paid by the municipality.\n\nTo supply drinking water to Pandharpur a storage reservoir, about a mile south-west of the town, was built in 1874 at a cost of \u00a321,614 (Rs. 2,16,140) which were paid by the municipality. The dam is built of earth faced with stones, is 3500 feet long, and has a greatest height of forty-four feet and a greatest depth of thirty-three feet. The drainage area is ten square miles and the surface area when full is 196 acres. The capacity is 89,330,058 cubic feet and the available capacity or that above level of sill of regulator is 79,166,083 cubic feet. From this reservoir to a service reservoir built close to the town, water is carried by a line of iron piping 3700 feet long, and from the service reservoir it is distributed through iron mains six to ten inches in diameter.\n\nBesides from the Koregaon, Ashti, and Ekruk lakes b\u00e1gdyat or garden land is watered either by throwing dams across streams or by wells. From the dams land is watered at the latest till the end of March. Wells are rarely sunk in m\u00e1lr\u00e1n or high level lands. According to the 1882 returns, Shol\u00e1pur has ten rivers, the Bhima, Sina, M\u00e1n, Bhog\u00e1vati, Apenpa, Bedki, Chandani, Korna, Nil, and Sira, 818 streams, 214 reservoirs, and 17,472 wells. Of the 17,472 wells 4812 are used for drinking and washing and 12,660 for watering; 4712 are with steps and 12,760 are without steps. The wells without steps have an average depth of twenty to twenty-five feet and cost \u00a320 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 200 - 2000) to make. The wells without steps have an average depth of fifteen to forty feet and cost \u00a320 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 200 - 1000). Wells are either round or\nChapter IV.\nAgriculture.\n\nWELLS.\n\nMost wells are round as round wells last longer than rectangular wells. To water land, water is drawn from the wells by a mot or leather bag holding about fifty gallons. The leather bag is of the shape of a cylinder, with this difference that the one end is about five times as broad as the other. The broader end is fastened to an iron ring three to four feet in diameter. The iron ring is held by a rope, passed over a pulley, fixed to the top of the frame work, raised over a platform slightly inclined in the direction of the well. The other end is also held by a rope which is passed over a cylindrical wheel attached to the bottom of the frame. The other ends of these ropes are tied to a yoke drawn down a slope by two and sometimes by four bullocks. The length of the slope is equal to the distance between the top of the platform and the level of the well water. When the bag is dropped into the water the team is backed up the slope, and the bag is so sunk into the water that the broader end fills, while the narrow end is slightly upheld so as to prevent the water running out. The smaller end of the bag is tied to a rope shorter than that which holds the larger end. When the bag is full of water it is drawn up by the team running down the slope, and is discharged in the cement-lined water trough or th\u00e1role on the top of the platform. Through an opening in the side of the trough the water is carried into the channel or p\u00e1t. The p\u00e1t or channel is one to two feet broad and is generally in earth, mud being piled on the sides to stop leakage; it is rarely built of bricks and stone. Generally two men work the leather bag with two to four bullocks; one drives the bullocks up and fills and draws the bag and the other distributes the water to proper places. If the well has enough water, a mot worked with two bullocks can water four acres of sugarcane, six acres of hundi jv\u00e1ri, wheat, rat\u00e1la, and chillies, and ten acres of r\u00e1l\u00e1 and rice. The leather bag costs about \u00a31 4s. and of its appliances the wooden frames and its two wheels cost 6s. (Rs. 3).\n\nMANURE.\n\nGarden lands, as a rule are watered, and always manured. Jirdy\u00e1t or dry crop lands are rarely manured, chiefly because the rainfall is generally too scanty to allay the heat of the manure and the crop dries and often perishes. The commonest kinds of manure are cowdung, rotten grass, ashes, house sweepings, red earth, and sheep-dung. Of this manure, for sugarcane house sweepings and dust are used, for betel leaves red soil house sweepings and dust are used, and for rice, chillies, groundnut, and jondhala or Indian millet, sheep-dung is particularly useful. To manure their garden lands with sheep-dung husbandmen often engage shepherds to pen a flock of sheep. Many well-to-do husbandmen own flocks of sheep chiefly for their manure. For manure cowdung, house sweepings, and ashes are generally stored in one place for a year and carted to the fields in May. When bought, a cartload equal to about 900 pounds of such manure costs 6d. to 1s. (4-8 as.) About twenty-five cartloads are required to manure one acre of sugarcane, twenty for chillies onions garlic and groundnut, fifteen for wheat, and ten for rice and Indian millet.\n\nTILLAGE.\n\nThe first step a husbandman takes is to work the soil with the plough. The plough uproots weeds and grass and turns the soil three\nto fifteen inches deep. The plough is worked by two to ten bullocks. In November or December when the soil is still moist and is easier to turn than at the end of May, a five-yoke plough can plough about a quarter of an acre of land in a day. Except coarse gray or barad soil which is simply scratched by the harrow or kulav, the plough is worked both in black and red soils. For garden or bagayat crops the soil must be ploughed every year. For jirayat or dry-crops the black soil which is once ploughed with cross ploughings, does not require fresh ploughing for six to eight years, but the red soil requires ploughing every third year. In ploughing two men are wanted, one to stand on the plough to press the share into the soil, and the other to sit on the drawing gear to drive the bullocks. While ploughing husbandmen sing to lighten their labour and to amuse the oxen. After ploughing the rake or phan is used to powder the clods. The harrow or kulav clears the soil of grass and makes it fit to receive the seed. The more the harrow is worked, the better the crops will grow. After the harrowing is over the seed-drill is used to sow the seed and the seed-harrow or rasni to level the surface. About a month after the seed is sown, the weeding harrow or kolpa is used which removes weeds and grass and heaps the soil to the roots of the young plants. A raised babhul seat is made in the centre of the field to watch the crops. On this raised seat the watchman sits armed with a sling of two ropes with a small circle of cords in the middle, with which he slings at the birds stones about the size of a small lemon. Watching lasts for a month or two till the crops are ripe enough to be reaped.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 1,873,096 acres the whole area held for tillage, 303,739 acres or 16\u00b721 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 1,569,357 acres 26,184 were twice cropped. Of the 1,595,543 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 1,248,264 acres or 78\u00b723 per cent, of which 950,477 were under Indian millet jvari Sorghum vulgare, 208,460 under spiked millet bajri Pennicillaria spicata, 41,836 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 24,409 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 11,673 under maize makka Zea mays, 1278 under rala or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 796 under s\u00e1va and vari Panicum miliaceum and miliare, 693 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 8642 under other grains of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 127,866 acres or 8\u00b701 per cent, of which 53,107 were under tur Cajanus indicus, 41,689 under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 7868 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, 4322 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 711 under udi\u00e1 Phaseolus radiatus, 30 under masur Ervum lens, 17 under peas v\u00e1tana Pisum sativum, and 20,132 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 150,760 acres or 9\u00b744 per cent, of which 25,312 were under linseed als\u00ed Linum usitatissimum, 2022 under gingelly seed til Sesamum indicum, and 123,426 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 47,166 acres or 2\u00b795 per cent, of which 28,088 were under cotton k\u00e1pus Gossypium herbaceum, 19,013 under Bombay hemp son or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea, and 65 under brown hemp amb\u00e1di Hibiscus cannabinus. Miscellaneous crops occupied 21,487 acres or 1\u00b734 per cent, of which 6915 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 3637 under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 2977 under tobacco tamb\u00e1kh\u00fa Nicotiana\ntabacum; 45 under hemp ganja Canabis sativa; and the remaining 7913 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe crop details given in the Poona Statistical Account apply to Sholapur. The following are local notes on three of the more important crops, cotton, wheat, and tobacco:\n\nCotton, kapus (M.), Gossypium herbaceum, had in 1881-82 a tillage area of 28,088 acres. It is all local or deshi cotton Gossypium indicum. It is sown late in June and in July. A day or two before sowing, that it may run freely through the tiphan or seed drill, the seed is rubbed with cowdung. In Sholapur cotton is sown in rows one foot apart. This crowding prevents the plants from getting sufficient moisture, the plants get entangled, and as they cannot spread, grow straight and tall. The husbandmen defend the crowding of the plants by saying, 'The more seed the more cotton, and the more cotton the more money.' The cotton crop is picked in December and January by women who are generally employed by moneylenders, who have made advances to the husbandman on his crop. The women carry drag-bags tied to their waists, in which they gather the picked cotton, and, when the bags are full, they empty them on the ground in heaps. In the evening each picker takes her heap to the village to be weighed, where she is paid by her employer, in proportion to the weight of the picked cotton either in kind or in money. Sholapur cotton is ginned only by the foot-roller or payv\u00e2ne, for the staple is too short and too brittle to be cleaned either by the saw-gin or the wheel-gin. The foot-roller is mostly worked by women, who are paid by the out-turn. To increase the weight of the ginned cotton the women press their feet gently on the roller and allow seed to pass. Their employers notice this but do not check it, for they also gain by the increase in weight. Sometimes the seed is as much as twenty-five per cent of the cleaned cotton. In 1851 some attempts were made to clean the Sholapur cotton by saw-gins, but the staple was so cut that traders refused to buy it. In 1851-52, as an experiment in different parts of the district 238\u00b75 acres (318 bigh\u00e1s) were sown with New Orleans cotton, but apparently without much success. Some husbandmen were persuaded to try a second chance, and in 1852-53, 1739\u00b725 acres (2319 bigh\u00e1s) were sown. This year the crops failed, and the people were so discouraged that in 1853-54, only 6\u00b775 acres (9 bigh\u00e1s) were sown. As in other cotton-growing districts the American war (1862-1865) greatly increased the area under cotton, but fraud and mixing injured its quality. In 1867 the cotton inspector of Sholapur distributed improved Hinganghat seed in some of the subdivisions, and at Madha carried on an experiment in deep ploughing. He ploughed thirty acres ten inches deep with the common field tools of the district. Though he worked under the disadvantage of an unusually dry season, the crop yielded 100 pounds an acre, when neighbouring fields gave only eight to ten pounds. This great difference between the yields convinced the husbandmen of the advantage of deep ploughing, but their poverty prevented them from adopting it. This experiment also showed that, when the ground is ploughed deep enough, the tap root passes\ninto the subsoil and sucks moisture from it when the surface soil is parched. In the opinion of the cotton inspector so long as husbandmen stick to the harrow scratching, there is no hope of improving the outturn even by introducing good selected seed. Good seed often improves cotton for a time, but if the cultivation does not improve, the seed will degenerate.\n\nWheat, *gahu*, Triticum aestivum, with in 1881 a tillage area of 41,836 acres, is generally grown in the best black soil. It has two chief varieties, *sheta* a dry-crop and *khapla* or *jod* a watered garden crop. About sixteen pounds of seed are required to sow an acre of wheat. Wheat is sown in October and reaped in February. Of the *sheta* and *khapla* varieties *sheta* is affected by mildew which is caused by dew, cloudy weather, heavy rain, and excessive cold, generally at the time when the ears come to bearing.\n\nTobacco, *tamb\u00e1khu*, Nicotiana tabacum, with a tillage area of 2977 acres in 1881-82, is generally grown in white soil near villages and sometimes in black soil. The soil is manured with cowdung. Tobacco is sown in seed beds in June, planted in August, and cut in January and February. Tobacco wants little water. When they are ready the plants are cut down to the stumps. There is no second crop. Tobacco grown in white soil is superior to that grown in black soil. The average cost of raising an acre of tobacco is estimated at \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18) and the average yield at about 450 pounds (5\u00bd Bengal mans).\n\nIts scanty and uncertain rainfall makes Shol\u00e1pur peculiarly liable to scarcity and famine. The earliest recorded famine is the great Durga D\u00e9vi famine which began about 1396 and is said to have lasted nearly twelve years. It arose from the want of seasonable rain and is said to have spread over the whole country south of the Narbada and to have depopulated whole districts. The famine of 1460 is remembered in the Deccan as D\u00e1m\u00e1ji Pant's, an officer of the Bahmani king Hum\u00e1yun who, as is related in the History Chapter, spent the government grain stores at Pandharpur in gifts to Br\u00e1hmans, and was saved from disgrace and punishment by the god Vithoba appearing at court as a Mh\u00e1r and paying the value of the missing grain. About 1520 a great famine is said to have been caused by military hordes destroying and plundering the crops. The famine of 1791 was very severe especially in the Karn\u00e1tak where the crops entirely failed. In the Deccan the yield was one-fourth to half the usual outturn; but as thousands of people came from the Karn\u00e1tak to the Deccan for support, the distress became very severe. During this famine grain sold at six pounds (3 *shers*) the rupee. In 1802 the plunder and destruction of crops by Holkar and the Pendh\u00e1ris caused a serious scarcity which the failure of the rain in October and November 1803 turned into a famine of ruinous severity. The price of grain is said to have risen to 1\u00bd pounds (\u00be *sher*) the rupee. At Pandharpur Dhondbhat Kutke and at Mohol an officer of the Nimbal\u00edkar are said to have fed large numbers of the destitute. In 1818 partly owing to the ravages made by B\u00e1jir\u00e1o's\n\n---\n\n1 Famine details up to 1865 are taken from Colonel Etheridge's Past Famines, 97-101, 144, 153.\narmies and partly owing to the failure of crops towards the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t in the Niz\u00e1m's country, the sub-divisions of B\u00e1rsi, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur suffered from famine. The famine was accompanied by a plague of cholera which destroyed thousands of lives. Grain sold as high as six to eight pounds (3-4 shers) the rupee. At Vair\u00e1g in B\u00e1rsi a rich moneylender named Ghongdey is said to have fed many starving people. In 1824, a failure of rain caused a partial famine in the Pandharpur sub-division and the country from the Bhima to the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri. During this famine grain sold at twelve to sixteen pounds (6-8 shers) the rupee. At Pandharpur an officer of Sindia's and at Vair\u00e1g a moneylender named Ghongdey opened a relief house or anachhatra where food was given free to the suffering. In 1832-33, want of rain caused famine throughout Shol\u00e1pur and the neighbouring districts over an area of about 150 square miles. Many left their lands and homes, and large remissions had to be granted. The famine lasted nine or ten months and in spite of the remission of grain duties, grain sold at ten to twelve pounds (5-6 shers) the rupee. The sub-collector of Shol\u00e1pur submitted to Government a proposal for certain public relief works, but Government did not consider the distress in Shol\u00e1pur sufficiently severe to call for so extreme a measure. At Shol\u00e1pur a Br\u00e1hman moneylender named Mah\u00e1ndra B\u00e1pu Kulavdev and many M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri moneylenders and at Vair\u00e1g the family of the moneylender Ghongdey are said to have given free food to the sufferers. In 1845 and 1854 owing to scanty rainfall scarcity of grain was felt in Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, and Mohol. In 1862, a scanty rainfall caused a scarcity of food in Poona, Ahmadnagar, Shol\u00e1pur, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and part of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. So great was the distress that as relief works roads were begun from Karm\u00e1la to Jeur, from Pandharpur to Mohol, from Shol\u00e1pur to Bij\u00e1pur, from Tembhurni to Paranda, and from Lunud to Pandharpur. For the relief of Government servants drawing monthly salaries of less than \u00a320 (Rs. 200), Government sanctioned grant of grain compensation.\n\nThe scanty rainfall of 9'11 inches in 1876, compared with an average of 25'21 inches, led to failure of crops and distress amounting to famine over the whole of the district. Of the seven sub-divisions, the crops in two, B\u00e1rsi and M\u00e1lsiras, were bad, and in the remaining five very bad. In September and October, except one or two local showers, there was no rain, and no cold weather crops were sown. Early in August the poorer classes began to show signs of distress, and, on the 4th of September, Government sanctioned the opening of relief works. With rising grain and want of field work distress increased, and by the beginning of September relief works were begun. For a week or two, the rapid spread of distress caused a panic, and dealers refused to part with their grain at any price. Government and the relief committees had to buy grain at the large markets and send it to the relief works. This lasted until grain began to be brought by rail when prices fell. For some months importations were large and the price of grain remained moderate. But in the hot months a fresh rise caused much distress. A favourable rainfall, at the opening of the rainy season, was followed by a long drought, which forced millet up to ten pounds and caused great suffering. Distress and anxiety continued till September and\nOctober when a plentiful and timely rainfall brought down prices and gave much relief. At the close of November the demand for special Government help ceased.\n\nThe following summary shows, month by month, the progress of the distress and the measures taken to relieve it. In September 1876, except some showers in M\u00e1liras and one or two other places, no rain fell. The early crop had entirely failed, and as rain held off, the ground could not be prepared for the cold-weather sowings. Except in Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi there was great distress, and by the beginning of the month, local relief works had to be opened. In October rain still held off and no cold-weather crops could be sown. Indian millet rose from sixty-six to fifteen pounds, and even at fifteen pounds the supply was small. Distress was increasing, and the number seeking relief rose so rapidly that it soon became evident that relief works were wanted on a larger scale than local funds could supply. Cattle were sent away in large numbers, and of those that remained many died from want of fodder. By the middle of the month (18th) about 20,000 cattle had left the district, and many villages were deserted, the people moving to the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s dominions, Ber\u00e1r, and Kh\u00e1ndesh. Already the numbers on relief had risen to 32,000. On the 13th, Government placed \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) at the Collector\u2019s disposal to supply pond clearing, prickly-pear cutting, and other light village works for those who were too weak to go long distances. About the middle of November slight rain fell in the three sub-divisions of M\u00e1liras Karm\u00e1la and Pandharpur. Many villages were entirely emptied, the people having left with their cattle. During the month large supplies of grain came by rail into Shol\u00e1pur. At first the distribution of grain over the district caused much difficulty. This was gradually overcome, and, except in M\u00e1liras and S\u00e1ngola, grain became plentiful and j\u00fa\u00e1ri prices fell from fifteen to about $16\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds the rupee. Except Shol\u00e1pur and Pandharpur, each of which had two rivers and a large lake, the water-supply was scanty. B\u00e1rsi and S\u00e1ngola were very badly off, and in Karm\u00e1la, M\u00e1liras, and M\u00e1dha, the only source of supply was holes dug in the beds of rivers and streams. The numbers on relief rose from about 40,000 in the beginning of the month to about 68,000 at its close. Of 47,821, the average daily number for the month, 14,487 were able-bodied, expected to do a full day\u2019s work and superintended by ordinary public works officers, and 33,334 were aged or feeble, expected to do two-thirds of a day\u2019s work and superintended by civil officers.\u00b9 About the end of the month cholera made its appearance in Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi. December passed without rain, and though there was no change in crop prospects, grain continued to be imported in such large quantities that rupee prices fell from $16\\frac{1}{2}$ to twenty pounds. In the beginning of the month there\n\n\u00b9 The rates of wages originally fixed for the workers were: For a man 3d. (2 a.), a day, for a woman 2\u00bdd. (1\u00bc a.), and for a boy or girl 1\u00bdd. (1 a.). About the middle of November a sliding scale was introduced providing that when prices rose over sixteen pounds the rupee, the money rate should vary with the price of food grain, and that in addition to 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) for men and \u00bed. (\u00bd a.) for women and children, men and women should receive the price of one pound of grain, and children of one or half a pound of grain according to the discretion of the supervising officers.\nwas slight cholera in two sub-divisions, but it soon disappeared. The number of the destitute rose, on civil works to 58,809 and on public works to 27,730. About the end of January 1877 a slight fall of rain improved the water-supply. The supply of grain continued sufficient. Large quantities were brought every week into the district, jv\u00e1ri prices remaining steady at twenty pounds the rupee. The number of the destitute rose on public works from 27,730 to 37,940, on civil works there was a small fall from 58,809 to 56,659, and 1018 persons were supported by charitable relief. About the middle of the month slight cholera appeared in two or three sub-divisions. On the 19th Government reduced the daily wage of feeble men workers by \\( \\frac{3}{4} d. ( \\frac{1}{2} a.) \\) and of women and children by \\( \\frac{3}{4} d. ( \\frac{1}{2} a.).^1 \\) About the end of February, 11 cents of rain fell at Shol\u00e1pur. The grain supply continued good, jv\u00e1ri prices remaining steady at twenty pounds the rupee. Cholera was general, and large numbers of people and cattle continued to leave the district. The numbers on relief fell, on public works from 37,940 to 32,134, and on civil works from 56,659 to 18,097. At the same time the number on charitable relief rose from 1018 to 1429. The large decrease in the numbers on the relief works was mainly due to organized opposition to the orders reducing the pay on civil agency works, and requiring the transfer of the able-bodied from civil to public works. The managers of the strike and many of those who had gone with them were no doubt well enough off to decline work, and such men it was the object of Government to get rid of. But others of the weaker people were not able to remain idle without suffering. After a time of much anxiety, about the middle of the month, the people slowly began to come in. Efforts were made to draft them to large works out of the district, such as the Nira canal and the Dhond-Manm\u00e1d railway. This at first met with most stubborn opposition. But, about the close of the month, many were induced to go to work on the Mhasvad lake in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Early in March, 37 cents of rain fell at Shol\u00e1pur and about a fortnight later there was a general fall of 11 cents. The grain supply was sufficient, and rupee prices fell from twenty to twenty-one pounds. The migration of people and cattle continued. Early in the month there was slight cholera over the whole district, but it was afterwards confined to one sub-division. The numbers on relief fell to 46,775; 6598 of them on civil agency and 40,177 on public works. The number on charitable relief was 813. The decrease in the number of the workers was chiefly due to large numbers absenting themselves on account of the Holi holidays. Fresh, but unsuccessful, efforts were made to draft the people to the Dhond-Manm\u00e1d railway. A few went to the Nira canal, but many, though in distress, refused to go on the works, because of the task and distance tests rather than on account of the reduction in the rates of pay. Towards the end of April smart showers fell throughout the district. The grain supply continued sufficient; but prices, partly from the general rise\n\n---\n\n1 The new rates were: For a man, the price of one pound of grain and \\( \\frac{3}{4} d. ( \\frac{1}{2} a.) \\) instead of \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} d. (1 a.) \\); for a woman, the price of one pound and \\( \\frac{3}{4} d. ( \\frac{1}{2} a.) \\) instead of \\( \\frac{3}{4} d. ( \\frac{1}{2} a.) \\), and for a boy or girl, the price of half a pound of grain and \\( \\frac{3}{4} d. ( \\frac{1}{2} a.) \\). Orders were also given to enforce task and distance tests.\nthroughout the country partly from enhanced cart rates, rose from twenty-one pounds in the beginning of the month to about nineteen near the close. The people who had left the district early in the season were returning; very few brought back their cattle with them. Against a small fall from 6598 to 5633 on civil works, the number of the destitute rose on public works from 40,177 to 43,292, and on charitable relief from 813 to 2194. Owing to the increased pressure of distress Government ordered work to begin on the P\u00e1ngaon lake, whose heavy earthwork, it was thought, would give immediate employment to about 10,000 labourers. There was slight cholera in a few places. May began and ended with smart showers. Emigrants were returning in large numbers. The supply of grain was fair, but prices rose from nineteen to $16\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds. Several parts of the district suffered severely from cholera. Distress spread steadily, and the number on relief rose to 61,348, 50,299 of them on public and 11,049 on civil works. The number on charitable relief rose to 6501. During June rain fell freely, and the sowing of the early crops was begun. There were large grain importations, and prices fell from $16\\frac{1}{4}$ to $17\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds. Many of the destitute found work as field labourers, and the number on relief fell to 52,172, 39,202 of them on public and 12,970 on civil works. The number on charitable relief rose from 6501 to 16,068. The mortality from cholera continued very heavy. In the beginning of July strong south-west winds were followed by a few heavy but partial showers, and the young crops were reported to be withering. More rain was required. The grain supply was fair, but, about the close of the month from the critical state of the crops, j\u00fadri rose from $17\\frac{1}{4}$ to $12\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds the rupee. The number on relief fell to 29,927, 26,526 of them on public and 3401 on civil works, and the number on charitable relief to 10,436. In August an average fall of 4\u00b760 inches of rain improved the young crops, and green grass was plentiful. At the same time the railway supply of grain began to fall short, and, about the close of the month, prices rose to $9\\frac{3}{4}$ pounds, causing very great distress. The numbers on public works fell to 12,904, on civil works to 3656, and on charitable relief to 9226. The mortality from cholera considerably decreased. In September there was heavy rain all over the district. The crops went on well, and green grass for cattle was abundant. Though the grain supply continued small, the favourable harvest prospects brought out local stores, and prices fell from $9\\frac{3}{4}$ to $13\\frac{3}{4}$ pounds the rupee. The number on public works fell to 7705 against an increase on civil works to 6092, and on charitable relief to 17,590. October was also a month of heavy rain, with an average fall of 6\u00b758 inches. The crops were good except in S\u00e1ngola and M\u00e1lsiras, when they were slightly damaged by too much rain, and the sowing of the late crops was delayed. About the end of the month the millet harvest was begun and the late sowing was in progress. The state of the people was improving, but many still required charitable relief. The grain supply was good, and prices fell for j\u00fadri from $13\\frac{3}{4}$ to twenty-four and for b\u00e1jri from $19\\frac{1}{2}$ to $29\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds. The numbers on public works fell to 6067, on civil works to 4034, and on charitable relief to 14,347. In November there was only slight rain, and more was required for the\ncold-weather jv\u00e1ri crops. By the close of the month, except tur and cotton, almost all the early crops were harvested. Rabi sowing was still in progress. Prices rose for bajri from thirty to twenty-eight, and fell for jv\u00e1ri from twenty-four to twenty-five pounds the rupee. The numbers on public works fell to 4956, on civil works to 584, and on charitable relief to 4601. Civil relief works were closed about the middle of the month, and public relief works at the end. In December, except in the M\u00e1lha sub-division, there were smart showers all over the district, and the jv\u00e1ri crops were much improved. Prices fell for bajri to thirty-one and for jv\u00e1ri to twenty-eight pounds. Though Government continued to offer charitable relief, the numbers wanting help fell from 7176 in the beginning to 1089 on the 22nd of the month.\n\nThe following statement of Indian millet prices and numbers receiving relief, shows that during the first four months of 1877 grain kept steady at about twenty pounds the rupee or more than thrice the ordinary rate; that its price rose rapidly in May June and July, till about the end of August it reached $9\\frac{3}{4}$ pounds. In September it fell slightly to $13\\frac{3}{4}$, and then quickly to about twenty-eight pounds. The number on relief had in January risen as high as 94,599. By lowering wages and enforcing task and distance tests the number fell to 50,231 in February and 48,925 in April. In May it again rose to 61,348, and from that went on falling till it fell to 5540 in November, when the relief works were closed. The number on charitable relief rose from 1018 in January to 1429 in February, then fell to 813 in March, and then steadily rose to 16,068 in June. From that, after falling to 9226 in August, it again rose to 17,590 in September. During the next three months it fell rapidly till in December it reached 1089:\n\nShol\u00e1pur Famine, 1876-77.\n\n| Month       | Average Daily Numbers | Average Prices | Rainfall |\n|-------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------|\n|             | On Relief Works       |                |          |\n|             | Civil Agency          | Public Works   | Total    |\n|             |                       |                |          |\n| 1876        |                       |                |          |\n| November    | 83,884                | 14,487         | 47,821   | 16\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches |\n| December    | 58,809                | 27,730         | 86,539   | 20 inches |\n| 1877        |                       |                |          |\n| January     | 56,659                | 27,640         | 94,599   | 20 slight |\n| February    | 15,097                | 32,184         | 47,281   | 20 0\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| March       | 65,685                | 40,292         | 105,977  | 21 0\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| April       | 56,623                | 40,292         | 96,925   | 19 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| May         | 11,049                | 50,929         | 61,978   | 16\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) 0\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) |\n| June        | 12,970                | 59,202         | 72,172   | 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) 7\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) |\n| July        | 3401                  | 26,526         | 29,927   | 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| August      | 8658                  | 12,904         | 16,560   | 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| September   | 6092                  | 7,708          | 13,800   | 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| October     | 4094                  | 6,097          | 10,191   | 24 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| November    | 554                   | 4956           | 5540     | 28 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) 0\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) |\n| December    |                       |                | 1089     | 28 Good rain |\n| Total       | 220,916               | 343,419        | 564,335  | 32\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) |\n| Average     | 16,993                | 26,417         | 43,410   |                |\n\nTotal Cost Rs. 18,61,842 203,183 2,065,025\nA special census taken on the 19th of May 1877, when famine pressure was general and severe, showed that of 62,712 workers, 52,136 on public and 10,526 on civil works, 41,112 belonged to the sub-divisions where the works were carried on; 15,164 belonged to different sub-divisions of the same district; 3470 were from other districts; and 2966 from neighbouring states. As regards their occupation, 3471 were manufacturers or craftsmen, 21,840 were holders or sub-holders of land, and 37,401 were labourers.\n\nThe total cost of the famine was estimated at \u00a3206,502 10s. (Rs. 20,65,025), of which \u00a3186,184 4s. (Rs. 18,61,842) were spent on public and civil works, and \u00a320,318 6s. (Rs. 2,03,183) on charitable relief.\n\nIn ordinary times the daily cart rates varied from 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d. (Rs. \u00bc - 1\u00bc). During the famine from December 1876 to December 1877 the highest daily cart rates rose to 12s. (Rs. 6) in Pandharpur, 6s. (Rs. 3) in Sholapur, 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) in Sangola, and 4s. (Rs. 2) in Barsi, Karmala, Madha, and Maliras.\n\nFrom the beginning of November 1876 a m\u0101latd\u0101r at each sub-division and from the beginning of January to the end of November 1877 special assistant and deputy collectors in charge of the sub-divisions were employed on famine duty as relief officers. For every group of about ten villages circle inspectors were appointed. Besides these, military officers, and their subordinates and hospital assistants, and the clerks and measurers of the Poona and Nasik revenue survey staff, and some teachers of vernacular schools were lent for famine duty.\n\nBesides the seven relief houses, one at each sub-divisional headquarters, at Sholapur, Barsi, Karmala, Madha, Pandharpur, Maliras, and Sangola, five other special relief houses were opened, two in Sholapur at Hiparga and Mandrup, two in Madha at Yeoti and Barsi Road Station, and one in Barsi at Pangaon. Almost all the relief houses were opened in November 1876 and closed at the end of November 1877. Except at Pandharpur where a large municipal building was available, all the relief houses were temporary sheds. The relief houses were supervised by the relief m\u0101latd\u0101r and the assistant or deputy collector in charge of the sub-division. At each relief house, for every 200 people a muster clerk and an accountant were kept. With a few exceptions the food was cooked and the water supplied by the inmates of the relief house; in some cases bhistis or water-carriers were employed. Between the 1st of November 1876 and the 31st of December 1877, the relief houses in Sholapur cost \u00a33800 8s. (Rs. 38,004), in Barsi \u00a31541 18s. (Rs. 15,419), in Karmala \u00a32651 18s. (Rs. 26,519), in Madha \u00a33743 16s. (Rs. 37,438), in Pandharpur \u00a33607 10s. (Rs. 36,075), in Maliras \u00a32725 16s. (Rs. 27,258), and in Sangola \u00a31365 10s. (Rs. 13,655), or a total cost of \u00a319,436 16s. (Rs. 1,94,368).\n\nNo grain shops were opened at Government or municipal expense. In the beginning of the famine when grain dealers attempted to raise the price of grain to an artificially high level by refusing to sell at any price, a local committee at Sholapur sold grain to the poor for\nChapter IV.\nAgriculture.\n\nFamines, 1876-77.\n\nGrain.\n\na few months at cost price out of a private charity fund. The local dealers, who withheld grain in the beginning of the famine, gave way when grain came in large quantities into the district. Grain was imported from the Central Provinces by private agencies. From Bombay the import of grain was so large that all the railway stations were crowded with bags, and for a time much confusion prevailed. To lessen the distress from want of fodder pressed grass bales were largely imported from the Konkan by the Conservator of forests; a large number of cattle were also sent to graze in Government waste lands in the hilly tracts. The scarcity of water was greatly felt, and, but for the Ekrulk lake many of the residents of Sholapur city would have been forced to leave. The want of water was partly met by deepening wells and digging holes.\n\nEmigration.\n\nA considerable number of people, chiefly husbandmen, left the district and went to Berar and to the Nizam's territory. Well-to-do husbandmen sent their cattle in charge of some member of their families. By leaving the people did not much improve their condition. They would probably have done better had they stayed at home and worked as labourers on relief works. Except a few who emigrated, the poor people had no alternative but to work on the relief works. Of the high and well-to-do classes, a few who could afford it made provision for the expected scarcity; others lived by selling their gold and silver ornaments and other property. As they were ashamed to live on charity and unaccustomed to live by labour a large number of respectable people did not take advantage of the relief offered by Government and were reduced to poverty.\n\nLosses.\n\nDuring the famine a large number of cattle died. The tillage area fell from 2,151,617 acres in 1876-77 to 2,136,988 in 1878-79 that is a fall of 14,629 acres. Compared with the 1872 census returns the 1881 returns show a decrease of 136,888. Adding to this 50,351 as the normal one per cent increase during the seven non-famine years the total loss from death or migration during the famine amounts to 187,239. At the end of 1876-77 the outstanding balances were \u00a384,949 (Rs. 8,49,490) of which about \u00a339,633 (Rs. 3,96,330) were recovered in subsequent years and \u00a345,316 (Rs. 4,53,160) were remitted in 1878-79.\n\nRats.\n\nBetween 1878 and 1882, unlike Poona and other parts of the Deccan Sholapur was not visited by locusts. During the cold season of 1879 from January to March swarms of rats and mice appeared and ate the grain before it was ripe enough to harvest. Many fields were entirely stripped and of others only a small portion was saved by gathering the ears while they were still green. About seven-eighths of the crop were wholly destroyed by rats. In Sholapur about \u00a3657 (Rs. 6570) were paid as reward for about 660,000 rats killed at 2s. (Re. 1) the hundred. This rat plague was not confined to Sholapur; it was severely felt in Parner, Shrigonda, and Karjat in Ahmadnagar.\n\n1 The details of the species of rats and mice and the steps taken to destroy them given in the Ahmadnagar Statistical Account apply to Sholapur.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nAccording to the census returns, in 1872 the district of Sholapur had 8477 persons in positions implying the possession of capital. Of these 673 were bankers, moneychangers and shopkeepers, 5681 were merchants and traders, and 2123 were supported by incomes derived from funded property shares annuities and the like. The available income tax returns show that in 1870-71 of a total of 2100 persons assessed, 1550 or 73.8 per cent were taxed on yearly incomes of less than \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), 386 or 18.3 per cent on incomes of \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 1000 - Rs. 2000), 159 or 7.5 per cent on incomes of \u00a3200 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 2000 - Rs. 10,000), and five or 0.2 per cent on income of \u00a31000 to \u00a310,000 (Rs. 10,000 - Rs. 1,00,000). Under the head capitalists and traders, the 1878 license-tax assessment papers showed 9131 persons assessed on yearly incomes of more than \u00a310 (Rs. 100). Of these 3529 had from \u00a310 to \u00a315 (Rs. 100 - Rs. 150), 1795 from \u00a315 to \u00a325 (Rs. 150 - Rs. 250), 1515 from \u00a325 to \u00a335 (Rs. 250 - Rs. 350), 492 from \u00a335 to \u00a350 (Rs. 350 - Rs. 500), 657 from \u00a350 to \u00a375 (Rs. 500 - Rs. 750), 267 from \u00a375 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 750 - Rs. 1000), 242 from \u00a3100 to \u00a3125 (Rs. 1000 - Rs. 1250), 135 from \u00a3125 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1250 - Rs. 1500), \u00a3141 from 150 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 1500 - Rs. 2000), 132 from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 2000 - Rs. 3000), 88 from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 (Rs. 3000 - Rs. 4000), 36 from \u00a3400 to \u00a3500 (Rs. 4000 - Rs. 5000), 62 from \u00a3500 to \u00a3750 (Rs. 5000 - Rs. 7500), 25 from \u00a3750 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 7500 - Rs. 10,000), and 15 over \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). Since 1879 incomes under \u00a350 (Rs. 500) have been exempted from the License Tax. In 1881-82, of 1386 persons assessed on yearly incomes of \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and over, 611 had from \u00a350 to \u00a375 (Rs. 500 - Rs. 750), 219 from \u00a375 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 750 - Rs. 1000), 175 from \u00a3100 to \u00a3125 (Rs. 1000 - Rs. 1250), 64 from \u00a3125 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1250 - Rs. 1500), 98 from \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 1500 - Rs. 2000), 106 from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 2000 - Rs. 3000), 58 from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 (Rs. 3000 - Rs. 4000), 19 from \u00a3400 to \u00a3500 (Rs. 4000 - Rs. 5000), 25 from \u00a3500 to \u00a3750 (Rs. 5000 - Rs. 7500), 3 from \u00a3750 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 7500 - Rs. 10,000), and 8 over \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). There are no local insurance offices.\n\nFew houses confine themselves to strict banking business, and granting and cashing bills of exchange. In most cases money-lending and sometimes trade are joined with banking. Banking houses are found only in the largest towns, Sholapur, B\u0101rsi.\n\n1 Most of this chapter is contributed by Mr. C. E. G. Crawford, C. S.\nPandharpur, and perhaps Karmala. At Barsi out of fifteen bankers or shroffs only three confine themselves to banking, the others being also engaged in moneylending and general business. A branch of the Bank of Bombay was established at Sholapur in 1861-62, and was open about three years. It had a favourable influence on trade as it lent money at lower rates of interest than had been customary, and issued and accepted bills payable at sight, or at a fixed period. Ninety per cent of its transactions were with natives. Except in the case of some European servants of Government it was not resorted to by the public for deposit. The Sholapur branch was closed early in 1867. A branch of the New Bank of Bombay was opened in 1868-69, but was soon closed from want of business.\n\nExchange bills are of two kinds, payable at sight or darshani and payable within a given time or mudati. The leading traders and moneylenders, who are chiefly Gujarati Marwari and Lingayat Vanis, Bhatias, Khetris, Komtis, and Brahmins, grant bills up to \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) on Bombay, Poona, Ahmadnagar, Madras, and Amba Salur and Haidarabad in the Nizam's territory. The rates of bills vary according to the demand for cash. Generally for a bill payable at sight a premium of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) per cent is charged and for a bill payable within a given time a discount of one-half per cent is allowed.\n\nMost classes can, and probably the majority of individuals do, save money. With most all and perhaps more than all they have saved is spent in a day of feasting, a marriage, a funeral, or some other religious occasion or holiday. The higher paid Government servants, pleaders, and moneylenders, especially Gujars and Marwaris, save most.\n\nOf investments for savings and capital, the chief are trade, house property, the purchase and improvement of land and farm stock, hoarding whether of cash or of ornaments, state saving banks and government securities, shares in joint stock companies, and money-lending. Traders invest most of their savings in extending and improving their business; cultivators in improving and adding to their holdings and in buying bullocks and carts. Carts are a favourite investment, where, as on lines of road and near large towns, the carrying trade offers employment when field work is slack. Thus in the Sholapur sub-division, in the thirty years ending 1870-71, the number of carts rose from 219 to 1167 or 433 per cent, in the Barsi sub-division from 705 in 1840-41 to 1794 in 1871-72 or 154 per cent, and in the Madha sub-division from 435 in 1839-40 to 1323 in 1868-69 or 204 per cent.\\(^1\\) The 1882 returns show a further rise in carts to 1389 in Sholapur, to 3081 in Barsi, and to 1769 in Madha. The trading and moneylending classes do not invest their money in land, except when, having advanced money on the land and being forced to sell their debtor's property, their only means of recovering the debt is to buy the\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Sel., New Series. CL. 9, 11, 163, 307, 310.\nland at the auction. With pleaders and other moneyed men with some English education the purchase and improvement of land is a favourite investment. This class is also given to house-building, a form of investment which is also popular with well-to-do villagers. All classes lock up their savings in ornaments, but, it is said, not to so large an extent as in other parts of the country. Ornaments are a specially favourite form of investment among small traders and craftsmen.\n\nDuring the thirteen years ending 1882 the yearly payment of interest to holders of Government securities rose from \u00a3108 (Rs. 1080) in 1870-71 to \u00a3172 (Rs. 1720) in 1882. The deposits in the district Savings Bank which in 1870-71 were \u00a31250 (Rs. 12,500) had in 1877-78 risen to \u00a33299 (Rs. 32,990) of which latter sum \u00a31703 (Rs. 17,030) belonged to 204 Hindus, 988 (Rs. 9880) to seventy-five Christians, \u00a3595 (Rs. 5950) to forty-two P\u00e1rsis, and \u00a312 (Rs. 120) to two Musalm\u00e1ns. In 1882 the deposits showed a further rise to \u00a36729 (Rs. 67290). As a rule, only Government servants and others of the higher classes invest their savings in Government securities and in savings banks.\n\nThe bulk of the people know nothing about investing in shares. About forty-four of the Shol\u00e1pur Spinning and Weaving Company's \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) shares are held locally.\n\nFew men live solely by lending. Almost all lenders draw part of their income from trade, from husbandry, or from a profession. Moneylenders are of two kinds, professional and non-professional. The professional again belong to two classes, local and foreign. Among non-professional moneylenders are men of all classes, almost all whose calling has yielded them a little money will lend it at interest. The foreign or immigrant moneylenders are Gujar\u00e1t Shr\u00e1vaks locally known as Gujars, and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis known as M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. Br\u00e1hmans and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis form the chief classes of local moneylenders, who have to a very great extent been ousted by the intruding Gujar or M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri. Besides lending money the Gujars are chiefly cloth-dealers, and the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris deal in grain, groceries, and oil. The Br\u00e1hman lender is generally a land proprietor, a pensioned Government servant, or a pleader. He is generally found in towns and seldom lends except to the better class of landholders. The Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis are chiefly iron-mongers and grocers and are seldom moneylenders. Besides these classes the Mar\u00e1tha or Kunbi moneylender is found in villages and towns; he is a husbandman, and, as a rule, does not lend except to people who belong to his village or with whom he is connected.\n\n1 The details of deposits for the thirteen years ending 1882 are: \u00a31250 in 1870, \u00a32169 in 1871, \u00a32636 in 1872, \u00a33764 in 1873, \u00a32891 in 1874, \u00a33791 in 1875, \u00a34532 in 1876, \u00a33299 in 1877, \u00a32937 in 1878, \u00a34124 in 1879, \u00a36640 in 1880, \u00a35940 in 1881, and \u00a36729 in 1882. The chief causes of the rise and fall in deposits are given in the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r Statistical Account. The details of interest during the same thirteen years are: \u00a3108 in 1870, \u00a394 in 1871, none drawn in 1872, \u00a349 in 1873, \u00a331 in 1874, \u00a3216 in 1875, \u00a325 in 1876, \u00a3481 in 1877, \u00a3162 in 1878, \u00a3136 in 1879, \u00a3163 in 1880, \u00a338 in 1881, and \u00a3172 in 1882.\nGujars, most of them Shr\u0101vak V\u0101nis of Gujar\u0101t, are said to have settled in the district within the last hundred years. They are now spread over the whole district, and are said to be more than three times as numerous as the local Hindu moneylenders. Most of them are Jains or Shr\u0101vaks by religion. They usually bring their families and settle in the district and do not leave it except when they have to make pilgrimages to Shetrunga near P\u0101lit\u0101na in K\u0101thi\u0101war, or some other Jain sacred place. In moneymaking, unlike M\u0101rw\u0101r V\u0101nis, Gujar V\u0101nis do not start from beggary. The Gujar starts with some small capital which he invests in a miscellaneous petty trader's shop. When he has made a handsome sum by shopkeeping, he calls himself a banker or sh\u0101huk\u0101r, and enters widely on moneylending. The Gujars are reputed to be less hardhearted and more polite, obliging, and friendly than their M\u0101rw\u0101r rivals, and in consequence more attractive and popular. In Shol\u0101pur and other large towns, they have formed no relations with the cultivating classes, but confine themselves to lending money on mortgage of landed and house property, and as pawn-brokers, on pledges at interest of not more than two per cent a month. The village moneylending Gujar is a cultivators' and villagers' moneylender, keeping a general shop, and supplying the villagers with all they require in the way of advances either of cash or of grain. All Gujars and particularly village Gujars by long residence are apt to become assimilated in manners and dress to the people among whom they live. They even come to fold their turbans after the Shol\u0101pur fashion. Their other dress, though showy, is economical, for though very fond of ornaments when they wear gold ornaments, they are usually hollow, while the women's practice of showing the left arm only, and not like Mar\u0101tha Hindus of showing both arms, considerably lessens the expense of ornaments. Like the local Ling\u0101yat Jangams, they take their food from a dish placed on a tripod of iron. Caste dinners are not uncommon and at least one caste dinner must be given after a death. On marriage and other religious festivities they spend large sums, intermarrying among themselves only without distinction of rich or poor. The destitute of their own class are so few that they make no special provision for them. To general charity they devote large sums, and are particularly known for their care of animals. Where they are numerous, they have their own temples, as at Shol\u0101pur where there are two temples of P\u0101rasn\u0101th. Gujars have been known to build rest-houses and wells for the public use. Their religious teachers enjoy incomes which enable them to entertain large bodies of followers and dependents.\n\nM\u0101rw\u0101ris are said to have appeared in this district about fifty years ago. They usually come from M\u0101lwa or M\u0101rw\u0101r, but instances of their settling in Shol\u0101pur from neighbouring districts are not rare. They are perhaps not so widely spread over the district as the Gujars, nor do they show so marked a tendency to assimilate to the people of the country. They bring their own language and customs, sometimes mixing M\u0101rw\u0101ri with Mar\u0101thi, an unpleasant and unserviceable jargon. A M\u0101rw\u0101ri is easily known by his long hair and scanty turban, barely thirty yards long, usually of two shades of red with\ngold ends, coat and jacket of the ordinary type, a red-fringed loincloth or *dhoti*, and red shoes with turned-up toes. A M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri often begins life as a beggar, his whole estate consisting of a few rupees, probably borrowed, a drinking and two or three cooking pots, and barely enough clothes to cover him. He begins as a seller of parched grain, and saves a little besides paying off his borrowed capital. With the savings of a year or two he opens a small shop, often in partnership with a countryman. In other cases the newly arrived M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri binds himself in some capacity as servant to a settled M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, and works with him till he is fit to open a petty shop on his own account. This he will often do on capital borrowed from his late master, or from other merchants who give him credit at low interest. If his shop succeeds he gains a share in some cloth-dealing concern, and, at the same time, starts as a moneylender or pawnbroker, and rapidly increases his wealth. At this stage in his career he sends for his family and some of his distant relations. A M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri who has begun to make a fortune rarely returns to settle in his native place. If his family is not with him, marriages and other religious ceremonies sometimes require his presence at home, and he may have to go home to seek a bride. Once he has settled permanently, he begins to acquire landed property and seldom or never breaks up his establishment, or goes away not to return. During any temporary absence, his business is managed by his confidential clerk or *munim* in default of a partner, or by one of his relatives. M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris are reputed as they grow in wealth and years, to grow fonder of money, harder hearted, and less inclined to show leniency to their debtors. Their thrifty habits they never lose. Of all moneylenders the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri has the worst name. He shows neither shame nor pity in his treatment of his debtor. He will press a debtor when pressure means bankruptcy. He shows no feeling. The saying runs that he will attach and sell his debtor's cooking and drinking vessels even when the family are in the midst of a meal. They marry in their own caste only, but without distinction of rich or poor. Though thrifty and averse from pomp and show, they are expected to spend large sums on marriage and other religious ceremonies, and it is usual for them on such occasions to entertain their whole caste. They have their own temples, and they are understood to contribute for the support of their own poor. No instance is known of a M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri having built a well or a rest-house for the use of the village where he is settled.\n\nOther moneylenders whether professional or unprofessional, whether foreign or local, may be divided, though the divisions often overlap, into dwellers in towns and dwellers in villages, and again into those who keep regular accounts and those who keep only rough accounts or none at all, basing all their dealings on bonds or *rohks*. Pawnbroking also forms a distinct branch of moneylending, though in practice it is usually combined with one of the other branches. As a rule the town lender who keeps regular accounts, the daybook or *kird*, the ledger or *kh\u00e1t\u00e1vani*, and the rough memorandum book of daily transactions from which the others are written up, does not seek exorbitant interest, deals only with the higher classes, on mortgage of houses or other...\nimmovable property, or on pledge in the way of pawnbroking, and keeps aloof from poor husbandmen and other embarrassed borrowers. These houses generally do a large business. The smaller men deal with the poor classes who agree to pay higher interest. They keep no accounts, depend entirely on bonds, or at best keep what are called pat\u0101ni accounts, that is a mere day-book which is allowed to run for years without a balance being struck. Many non-professional moneylenders come under this head, and in this way the successful tailor or weaver often finds a favourable employment for his savings. The professional lender of this class is usually a M\u0101rw\u0101ri, exacting both a pledge and an exorbitant rate of interest, and looking to making his money not so much by repayment as by his debtor's failure to redeem his pledge which consequently falls to the lender.\n\nThe professional village moneylender is usually, unless he is in a very large way of business, also a shopkeeper, dealing in grain, chillies, salt, pepper, oil, clarified butter, and such other petty chandlery as the village requires. His shop is held in the front veranda of his house, which is also his storeroom and is generally the sole difference between his house and those of his neighbours. He is usually a Gujar or M\u0101rw\u0101ri, but sometimes a Ling\u0101yat V\u0101ni. The non-professional village moneylender is usually a cultivator, a Mar\u0101tha, probably of the family of the village headman or p\u0101til, or a Br\u0101hman of the village accountant or kulikarni, and village priest or joshi family. These have a better name for leniency and indulgence towards debtors than professional lenders. Others say that from their cleverness and knowledge of the land, they do a better business than any other lenders in the way of mortgages on land.\n\nMost classes of the community are at times forced to borrow. Petty traders and shopkeepers usually start on borrowed capital, and afterwards often require advances to buy their year's stock. Of other dwellers in towns craftsmen and labourers cannot meet the expenses they are compelled to incur at marriage and funeral feasts and caste dinners without running into debt. Weavers dyers and other craftsmen who require about \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15) to buy their materials, usually have to borrow if they are not, as is perhaps more usual, wholly in the hands of a capitalist who advances them the material, and pays them day wages for working it. Of the village population few without borrowing can obtain the large sums they spend on feasts and entertainments, and the poorer peasantry have to borrow money to pay their rent, to meet the cost of tillage, and, in many cases, to buy grain for seed and food. Villagers are said to be apter to incur debt than townspeople because their receipts come in a lump sum, once or at most twice a year. This they thoughtlessly spend, and have to borrow for a bare subsistence eleven months out of the twelve. Apparently no sharp line can be drawn between moneylenders who deal exclusively with townspeople and well-to-do landholders, and those who lend only to the poorer classes. As a rule, the fairly well-to-do traders, shopkeepers of credit, and large landholders can get\nadvances from houses of capital, who keep regular accounts. People of less credit have to resort to the smaller moneylender, professional or unprofessional, who keeps no accounts except the bond he invariably takes from the debtor. In particular the Marwari moneylender is credited with insisting both on a pawn in pledge and on a high rate of interest. Labourers can hardly get an advance without pledging as security their hut, plot of land, ornaments or brass vessels, or their service. Where an ornament or other article is pledged the yearly interest for craftsmen of fair credit varies from seven to eighteen per cent. Though no class of moneylenders deal solely with villagers, in practice only well-to-do landholders are allowed to borrow on account from the large town banking houses which keep regular accounts and as a rule do not take a bond from borrowers. Small landholders have to resort to the moneylender of their own or of a neighbouring village for such advances as they require. In all cases the credit of a would-be borrower is not gauged by his calling but by his personal credit and the security he can offer. Thus where a well-to-do landholder will get an advance for petty field purposes on his personal security at twelve to twenty-four per cent, a poor landholder will have to pay at least twenty-four, and not improbably thirty-six per cent, and even higher. Advances with a lien on standing crops are charged much the same rates as on personal credit, for moneylenders are shy of standing crops because they find it difficult to establish their lien without going to the civil courts. When houses or land are mortgaged the rates vary from six to twenty per cent. The poorer landholders very often seek from the moneylender advances of grain both for food and for seed. These are repaid at harvest, usually at the rate called v\u0101dhi didhi that is one and a half times the quantity advanced, or sometimes a little more or less. As a rule grain advances are repaid before the crop leaves the field. A bond is usually passed for the value owing in money at such terms as the creditor chooses. Sometimes such advances amount to a virtual sale in advance of the crop, the full produce of the field being estimated, and an advance of about twenty-five per cent less being made.\n\nMortgage of labour is not uncommon in the case of men without credit or security who wish to raise money for some extraordinary expenditure, such as a marriage or a house-building. The bond is entirely personal, and the mortgagee has no lien on the services of the mortgagor's wife or children. A man's services are valued at the yearly rate of \u00a32 10s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 25-50) besides his food. To pay off an advance of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) with interest at eighteen per cent a year, a man would have to serve five years with his food, or two years without his food. If he gets his food, the mortgagor must give all his time to his master; if he gets no food he is allowed to go home to feed for an hour twice a day. The use of corporal punishment to force the mortgagor to work is unknown. If better service offers the mortgagor will get the new master to pay what he owes to his old master, who will then set him free to take up his new employment.\nExcept the large town houses all moneylenders are credited with taking unfair advantage of the ignorance and necessity of the poorer borrowers, and of all lenders the reputation of the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri is darkest both for trickery and hardheartedness. The borrowing classes are willing sullenly to admit the usefulness of the moneylender, but they have a hundred complaints against him. His terms are exorbitant. If a man borrows 2s. (Re.1) he is told to repay 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) in a week, or be charged monthly interest at \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{d.} \\) (\u00bd a.) the rupee, that is 37\u00bd per cent a year. When they make payments in cash or kind, the lender neither passes a receipt nor credits the payment in his books. He is forever forcing them to pass fresh bonds for the principal and accumulated interest, or else he files a suit against them, perhaps on a false claim, very likely bribing the court official to keep the debtor unaware of the suit, while the court gives judgment in the bond, and refuses to look beyond it. On the other hand, in defence of the moneylender it is urged that they who say such things are just the men who have not, and never will have money to pay their debts, that their terms and rates of interest are of old standing and used to be satisfactory, that when debtors charge them with not crediting payments in account, they forget the small miscellaneous advances they have had, and remember only the original loan, that the blame really belongs to the new Limitation Law which forces lenders to be always renewing bonds or filing suits, so that the fault is the Legislature's, 'When the mother cuts the throat, who will save the child.'\u00b9 That when a debtor allows himself to be beguiled by soft words and makes a payment on account without securing a particle of evidence, or passes a new bond, which he cannot read and does not trouble himself to have it read to him, his folly is beyond hope, and the civil court can do nothing to protect him.\n\nGenerally a debtor has current dealings with only one creditor. United action between the creditors of a single debtor is unknown. Only those moneylenders who deal solely with the well-to-do classes can abstain from the civil court. When a decree is obtained,\u00b2 the favourite use to which it is put is to get a mortgage of his land from the debtor under fear of execution. Imprisonment\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The Mar\u00e1thi runs: M\u00e1i k\u00e1pi gal\u00e1, kon rakhil bhala.\n\n\u00b2 According to a statement supplied by Mr. Ganesh B\u00e1b\u00e1ji M\u00e1t\u00e9, a pleader of the Sholapur court, in 1884 for non-agriculturists the total cost to the plaintiff on a suit of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) amounts to \u00a32 14s. 3d. (Rs. 27\u00bd), and to the defendant to 13s. (Rs. 6\u00bd). The details are: Of the total plaintiff's cost \u00a31 19s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 19\u00bd) are spent before the judgment is passed, 15s. (Rs. 7\u00bd) on stamps, 1s. (8 as.) for vakilit\u00e1rd\u00e1ma or power of attorney, 1s. (8 as.) for retaining fee, 6s. 6d. (Rs. 3\u00bd) for fee and allowance, 3s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 1\u00bc) for the allowance subsistence and contingencies of three witnesses, 2s. (Re. 1) to a private peon to look up the witnesses, 6s. (Rs. 3) for retaining fees to witnesses, and 4s. (Rs. 2) for personal expenses; and the remaining 15s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 7\u00bd) go in the execution of the decree, 1s. (8 as.) being for application for execution, 6s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 3\u00bd) for copy of decree and judgment, and 8s. (Rs. 4) for warrant, allowance, and auction. Of the total defendant's cost 1s. (8 as.) go for vakilit\u00e1rd\u00e1ma or power of attorney, 6s. (Rs. 3) for retaining fee, and 6s. (Rs. 3) for witness' allowance. Since the introduction of the Rayats' Relief Act in November 1879, besides the cost of other items, agriculturists are charged half, that is 7s. 6d. (Rs. 3\u00bd) instead of 15s. (Rs. 7\u00bd) on stamps, and 1s. (8 as.) instead of 2s. (Re. 1) for a private peon to look up the witnesses.\nof the debtor is not common. Creditors seldom cease to press their claims or write off outstandings as bad debts. They prefer to keep their decrees alive by renewing them at intervals of three years, and keep debts, however hopeless, on their books in case something may turn up to improve the debtor's finances. In defence of their exactions lenders allege a growing tendency on the part of the borrowers to evade their liabilities by fraudulent transfers of land to kinsmen or friends, or to another moneylender, a rival of their creditor. There is no great complaint of agrarian crime, other than cattle-poisoning, and cattle-poisoning is due to ill-feeling between Kunbis and Mhars and not to the hatred of borrowers and lenders.\n\nTransfers of land commonly take place in one of three ways. Land is relinquished by the holder or sold by Government on the failure of the holder to pay his rent; land is sold under the orders of the civil courts; and land is transferred by voluntary sale or mortgage. When land is sold in satisfaction of a civil court's decree, it commonly happens that the decree-holder buys it himself, not because he covets land, but because there is no other bidder. This is sometimes to be accounted for by all the people of the village being friendly to the debtor, more generally because the court's sale is without guarantee. When the auction purchaser goes to take possession, he is met with previous mortgages and other claims and has to prove the judgment debtors' title which is not easy, especially when the judgment debtor is hostile to him and perhaps in collusion with a rival claimant. When the decree holder buys the land himself, he commonly keeps the judgment debtor on it to cultivate it either as his servant or at a rack-rent. When land is mortgaged it generally remains in the possession and cultivation of the mortgagor, who executes a bat\u00e1-patra or acknowledgment of lease to the mortgagee as evidence that he holds under him and delivers to him yearly such share, one-half or one-third, of the produce as has been agreed and generally himself\n\n---\n\n1 The following account of two debts was obtained, the one from the debtor, the other from the moneylender's books, by R\u00e1o S\u00e1heb Ganpatr\u00e1o Amrit Mankar, late Snb-Judge of M\u00e1dha. They are believed fairly to illustrate the transactions of moneylenders. Anantsing Bh\u00e1nsing borrowed \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) on a bond from Bhav\u00e1niband about twenty years ago, at three per cent interest a month. In three years the sum was doubled, the debtor paid \u00a32 6s. (Rs. 23) and passed a new bond for the balance \u00a32 14s. (Rs. 27); this was replaced three years afterwards by another bond for \u00a35 8s. (Rs. 54), and that after the same interval by another for \u00a36 6s. (Rs. 63), \u00a34 10s. (Rs. 45) being paid in cash at the same time. When the principal and interest amounted to \u00a312 (Rs. 120) the debtor delivered to the creditor kadbi or millet stalks of the value of 16s. (Rs. 8), and passed a bond for \u00a310 (Rs. 100), the balance being relinquished. When in 1874 the \u00a310 had risen by interest to \u00a320 (Rs. 200) the creditor filed a suit and obtained a decree for that amount. On the 6th January 1868 Danya, wife of Vithu, borrowed \u00a31 2s. (Rs. 11) on a bond bearing interest at three per cent a month from M\u00e1nikchand Khimchand Gujar. On the 24th of June 1871 a new bond, with Danya's son Kondi as security, was passed for \u00a32 4s. (Rs. 22) being the principal and interest according to the rule of d\u0101md\u0101yut, that is a principal doubled by accumulated interest. On the 20th of June 1874 the creditor instituted a suit against the mother and son, and obtained a decree for \u00a34 8s. (Rs. 44) with costs 14s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 7-2-1), and recovered \u00a31 12s. (Rs. 16) by sale of a house belonging to Kondi on the 5th of March 1875. He has still to recover \u00a32 16s. (Rs. 28) and costs 17s. 5\u00bdd. (Rs. 8-11-7), being 3s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 1-9-8) additional cost of executing the decree.\npays the assessment. Where the mortgagee has reason to apprehend fraud on the mortgagor's part he will put in his own man, or, in some cases cultivate the land himself.\n\nWithin the six years ending 1883 borrowing has become less general among all classes of husbandmen. The practice of renewing bonds has also greatly fallen off. It is usually the borrower who refuses to renew the bond. To meet this lenders have begun to insist that before any fresh agreement, they shall receive possession of land or house property. Much land has changed hands. Some of it has been thrown up and has remained either waste or has been taken by Government for forests. A good deal has passed from the names of husbandmen to the names of moneylenders. In Shol\u00e1pur the moneylenders fail to find people to cultivate the land. A considerable number of husbandmen are said to have fallen from being landholders to be either labourers or half-sharers of the crop. At the same time there seems a general agreement that among the cultivating classes there has of late been a notable increase of thrift and foresight. Instead of empty stories of the former greatness of their families, their talk is of their debts and how they can get rid of them. They refuse to renew bonds; they keep back grain enough for seed and for food during the rains; and they have cut down their marriage charges from a third to a half. In many cases professional lenders, especially M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, have to a great extent given up lending, or before they lend they insist on the transfer of land or house property; or they refuse to lend more than small sums. On the other hand there seems to be a small but widespread increase in the number of Br\u00e1hmans and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, chiefly landowners, who lend money or advance grain to their poorer neighbours. Of the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris who have given up lending, none seem to have fallen into poverty, or to have been forced to take to husbandry or other callings which they formerly thought to be below them. Almost all seem to have taken to trade, and in Shol\u00e1pur city the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri is a great and successful trader in silk, sweetmeats, grain, and groceries. During the three years ending 1883, though the crop was in the end good, the seasons have severely tried the husbandmen's capital and credit. The early crops have been sown several times and in most places failed either altogether or partly. In each year a late and heavy rainfall has changed a bad season into a good season. When the rain fell, little if any land was left unsown from want of seed. This seed seems to a great extent to have been obtained without the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris' help. It was partly grain kept by the husbandmen out of the last harvest, partly borrowed from their richer neighbours, Kunbis and Br\u00e1hmans.\n\nThe changes in Shol\u00e1pur moneylending during the past ten years are due to three chief causes: the agrarian riots of 1875, the famine of 1876-77, and the Agriculturists' Relief Act of 1879. It is not easy to fix what share in the change belongs to each of these causes. The agrarian riots which in Poona and Nagar seem to have driven M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris from villages to towns or led them to send their families and their treasure into towns, had no direct effect in Shol\u00e1pur. The memory of their sufferings in the famine of 1876 is said to be one cause of the reduction in marriage expenses, and the refusal of the\nM\u00e1rw\u00e1ris to advance grain during the famine is said to be one reason why husbandmen now keep back a share of the harvest for seed and for food during the rainy months.\\(^1\\) As to the effect of the Relief Act opinions differ. According to some the passing of the Act has done good by giving borrowers the hope that their load of debt may be cleared, and by warning lenders that there are limits beyond which their claims will not be enforced. Some trace the increase of thrift and forethought chiefly, and some entirely, to the Relief Act. A fourth party hold that the Act has done harm by curtailing the borrowing power even of respectable landholders. The balance of opinion seems in favour of the Act.\n\nAt the present time (1884) according to returns received, in small transactions, where an article is given in pawn, an artisan with fair credit pays yearly interest at rates varying from nine to eighteen per cent, for a well-to-do cultivator the minimum rises to twelve per cent, and for a poor cultivator the rates are not less than twelve to twenty-four per cent. In such transactions, if personal security only is received, the yearly rates are said to vary from twelve to twenty-four per cent for the richer and from eighteen to forty-eight and sometimes even to sixty per cent for the poorer class of borrowers. In large transactions, if movable property is mortgaged, the yearly rates are stated to vary from six to fifteen per cent for richer and from twelve to twenty-four per cent for poorer borrowers. When land is mortgaged, the yearly rates are said to vary from six to thirty-six per cent. These rates form only a part of what the borrower has to pay for his loan. Out of the amount of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) entered as principal in the bond, the borrower has to pay 2s. (Re. 1) for the stamped paper on which the bond is written, 6d. (4 as.) for the writing of it, and 6s. (Rs. 3) for registration. Discount for ready money is also deducted sometimes at as high a rate as ten per cent. Besides this, except sometimes when the transaction is to extend over more than three\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Before the famine of 1876-77 it was the practice for husbandmen to hand over the bulk of their crop to their chief creditor, generally a M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, who advanced them grain for seed to be paid at harvest time at one and a half and for food at double the quantity advanced. In the famine year, when their grain was done, the husbandmen went to the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri expecting an advance on the usual terms. But the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri was making fourfold or fivefold profits by the sale of grain, and in spite of prayers and tears, refused to make any advance. At the next harvest when, according to custom the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri came to take the crop, the husbandmen refused to give him the grain or kept back a large share of it saying they must keep grain by them as they could not trust the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri to feed them and give them seed. On this the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri who had outstanding claims took out a decree and had the field attached, sold, and bought. The villagers met this by arranging that no one should plough the field, that no washerman should wash the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri's clothes, no barber shave him, no Koli bring him water, no herdboy tend his cattle, and that his servants, except his M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri servants, should leave him. To frighten back his servants the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri charged them with theft and assault, and, in the hope of bringing the villagers to trouble, some M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris set fire to their own houses. Inquiry showed that the complaints were false or frivolous and the accused were not even put on their trial. Then the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri gave in. He went round to the houses of the leading villagers, showed them what mischief ill-will between lenders and borrowers worked, and begged them to persuade the people to be friendly. He promised never again to press his debtors too hard and in some cases gave back fields to the former owners. This is said to have happened particularly in Supa in Poona.\nyears, interest is charged for at least twenty days of the intercalary month. From six to nine per cent a year is said to be generally considered a fair return for money invested in land.\n\nThe Government rupee, which is locally called the Surat rupee, is the standard in all transactions. But at B\u00e1rsi where three-quarters of the exports and imports come from and go to the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country, the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s rupee, variously called the Samsher\u00ed, Hali Sicca, or Salar rupee, is in circulation at rates varying from $13\\frac{1}{2}$ to $14$ annas. Cotton, clarified butter, oil, and surangi are quoted in the market in Niz\u00e1m\u2019s rupees, but are paid for in Government coin at seven to eight per cent discount. During the season the moneychangers drive a brisk trade at a discount of fourteen to eighteen per cent for the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s rupees. The Niz\u00e1m\u2019s customs authorities receive Government rupees at a fixed premium of $16\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. The old copper pies, known as shivr\u00e1\u00eds, abound in the district.\n\nFifty years ago (1834) a man\u2019s daily wage was $2\\frac{1}{4}d.$ ($1\\frac{1}{2}$ as.). Between 1862 and 1865 the high price of cotton and at the same time the great railway demand for labour raised daily wages to $6d.$ (4 as.). In 1877, the famine year when there were numbers of the destitute and no work, the daily wage of a man labourer in the city fell to $3d.$ (2 as.), of a woman to $2\\frac{1}{4}d.$ ($1\\frac{1}{2}$ as.), and of a child to $1\\frac{1}{2}d.$ (1 a.). At present (1884) a town labourer earns $6d.$ (4 as.) a day and a field labourer $4\\frac{1}{2}d.$ (3 as.), a carpenter or mason in Shol\u00e1pur city $1s.$ 6d. (12 as.) and a bricklayer $1s.$ 3d. (10 as.).\n\nIn the Shol\u00e1pur mills common labourers earn (1884) 12s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 6-15) a month, women employed as reelers and winders of yarn make 10s. to 18s. (Rs. 5 -9), and children employed as piecers and doffers 6s. to 10s. (Rs. 3 -5). Smiths, bricklayers, fitters, and firemen at the Shol\u00e1pur mills earn \u00a32 to \u00a34 (Rs. 20 -40) a month. No high class Hindus have as yet taken to mechanical work at the mills. Spinners, weavers, and their overlookers are generally paid by piecework. The regular hours of labour are from six in the morning to six in the evening with half an hour\u2019s rest at dinner time. The workpeople bring their food with them. Alternate Sundays and the principal holidays are allowed for rest. Most of the better paid workpeople spend their surplus earnings in drink.\n\nField labourers are commonly paid in kind, daily, at the field. A wife is usually paid two-thirds of her husband\u2019s earnings, or enough to supply her own clothes and such little luxuries for the family as salt, chillies, and other ornaments. Where there are more than one grown woman in a household, one stays at home and the rest go to work. Boys from ten and girls from twelve go to work, and earn about a quarter of what their fathers earn. Children also earn money by gathering cowdung for fuel, and boys by herding sheep and cattle. Respectable labourers can get loans up to six months\u2019 earnings on the security of themselves and their family or that of their vessels and clothes. In towns and in all but small villages in ordinary times labourers can make a living all the year round. Field work keeps them busy during the harvest seasons that is in October and November, and again in January February and March, and some of them are busy right through from June till\nMarch. At other times they cut firewood and grass for sale, and work as bricklayers, labourers, and well-diggers. In large places women can always find work in grinding corn in the houses of the well-to-do. In small country places where there is nothing but field work, labourers even in the best times are in some distress during the slack season.\n\nExcept for eight years between 1847 and 1854, yearly price details, which are little more than estimates, are available for the fifty-five years ending 1883. During these fifty-five years the rupee price of Indian millet, which is the staple grain of the district, varied from 188 pounds in 1843 to fifteen pounds in 1877 and averaged seventy pounds. Of the fifty-five years, in ten the price was below 100 pounds the rupee, 188 in 1843, 172 in 1842, 165 in 1855, 138 in 1841, 124 in 1844, 116 in 1857, 114 in 1839, 110 in 1840, and 104 in 1828 and 1858; in two it was between 100 and ninety pounds, ninety-eight in 1859 and ninety-two in 1826; in five it was between ninety and eighty pounds, ninety in 1822 and eighty-eight in 1829 1830 1856 and 1860; in three it was between eighty and seventy pounds, eighty in 1827, seventy-eight in 1861, and seventy-one in 1881; in eight it was between seventy and sixty pounds, seventy in 1837, sixty-nine in 1874, sixty-eight in 1836, sixty-six in 1833 and 1832, sixty-three in 1875, and sixty-two in 1838 and 1883; in ten it was between sixty and fifty pounds, sixty in 1825, fifty-eight in 1862, fifty-seven in 1880, fifty-six in 1823 1846 and 1873, fifty-five in 1845, fifty-four in 1831 and 1834, and fifty-two in 1835; in four it was between fifty and forty pounds, fifty in 1821, forty-seven in 1868, forty-five in 1863, and forty-three in 1869; in five it was between forty and thirty pounds, thirty-eight in 1866, thirty-seven in 1867, thirty-six in 1870 and 1872, and thirty-one in 1824; in six it was between thirty and twenty pounds, twenty-nine in 1864 1865 and 1879, twenty-eight in 1871, twenty-seven in 1876, and twenty-six in 1832; and in two it was between twenty and fifteen pounds, eighteen in 1878 and fifteen in 1877. Since 1858 the price has never been below 100 pounds the rupee. The fifty-five years may be divided into eight periods. Except in the famine year of 1824 when it was thirty-one pounds, in the first period of ten years ending 1830 the price varied from 104 pounds in 1828 to fifty pounds in 1821 and averaged seventy-four pounds. Except in the famine year of 1832 when it was twenty-six pounds, in the second period of eight years ending 1838 the price varied from seventy pounds in 1837 to fifty-two pounds in 1835 and averaged fifty-six pounds. Except in 1845 and 1846 when it was fifty-five pounds, in the third period of eight years ending 1846 the price varied from 188 pounds in 1843 to 110 pounds in 1840 and averaged 119 pounds. For the eight years ending 1854 price details are not available. Except in 1862 when it was fifty-eight pounds, in the fourth period of eight years ending 1862 the price varied from 165 pounds in 1855 to seventy-eight in 1861 and averaged ninety-nine pounds. In the fifth period of ten years ending 1872 the price varied from forty-seven pounds in 1868 to twenty-eight pounds in 1871 and averaged thirty-seven pounds. In the sixth period of three years ending 1875 the price varied from sixty-nine pounds in 1874 to fifty-six pounds in 1873 and averaged\nsixty-two pounds. In the seventh period of four years ending 1879, owing to bad years the price was unusually high, varying from twenty-nine pounds in 1879 to fifteen pounds in 1877 and averaging twenty-two pounds. In the eighth period of four years ending 1883 the price varied from seventy-one pounds in 1881 to fifty-seven pounds in 1880 and averaged sixty-four pounds.

A dh\u00e1n is a single rice grain. The rati is generally of fine pebble, cut, and usually rounded to the required size. The tola is equal to 180 Troy grains. Gold and silver are weighed by the table eight gunj\u00e1s one m\u00e1sa, and twelve m\u00e1s\u00e1s one tola. The gunj is the small oval seed of the Abrus plant, about the size of a pea, red with a black speck. The m\u00e1sa is generally a bit of broken chinaware or the like, round, and about the size of a half-copper (\u00bd a.). The other metals are sold by tol\u00e1s, shers, and mans; sixteen shers of eighty tol\u00e1s making one man. The same weights are used for alkali, coffee, cotton, drugs, spices, molasses, and sugar, sometimes also for salt, but salt is more commonly sold by capacity measures. The weights are of iron and are usually round. At B\u00e1rsi cotton sells by the boja or bundle of three mans, one boja including the sacks weighing 246\u00bd pounds. Spirituous liquor is sold by the bottle. Oil, milk, honey, and other liquids are bought and sold by the sher in measures of brass or copper, in shape something like ordinary glass.\ntumblers. All kinds of grain and usually salt are also sold by the *sher*. The *sher* measure is commonly of iron, cylindrical in form, but compressed in the middle to make it easier to hold; its height is $7\\frac{1}{2}$ inches and its diameter $5\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. The water capacity of the *sher* is 164 *tol\u00e1s* of 130 grains Troy. One *sher* of the best rice weighs 152$\\frac{1}{2}$ *tol\u00e1s*, of common rice 151, of *jv\u00e1ri* 138, of wheat 140, of gram 146, of *d\u00e1l-tur* 142$\\frac{1}{2}$, and of salt 160. Before 1848 when the eighty *tola sher* measure of weight was introduced, the Shol\u00e1pur *sher* of capacity was 100 to 120 *tolas*. The present *sher* was then adopted as the equivalent of two *shers* of eighty *tol\u00e1s*, one *sher* being found inconveniently small. English and mill-made cloth is sold by the yard, hand-woven by the *h\u00e1t* or cubit. The land measures are acres, *gunth\u00e1s* or one-fortieth of an acre, and *ann\u00e1s* or one-sixteenth of a *guntha*. Masonry is measured by the cubic foot. Logs, scantlings, and boards are measured by the cubic foot, and battens by the hundred lineal feet. Earth work is measured by the foot.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE.\n\nFew details of roads are available before 1855. At the accession of British power in 1817 and from that time till about 1850, Sholapur had no made roads and few carts; all traffic went over fair weather tracks on pack bullocks. During the four rainy months the tracks were impassable and for about two months afterwards the passage was rendered most tedious and difficult by the black soil and the numerous streams. During the eight dry months also the tracks were neither smooth nor easy for carts. Of these old tracks eight lines centred at Pandharpur, eight at Sholapur, and two at P\u00e1gaon in B\u00e1rsi. Of the eight lines which centred at Pandharpur, one went twenty-three miles north to Tembourni in Karmala; one went fifty-seven miles north-east to B\u00e1rsi by Mohol, Vair\u00e1g, and P\u00e1gaon; four went south and south-west, one being forty-two miles to Jath, another seventy miles to Athni in Belgaum, a third eighteen miles to S\u00e1ngola, and from S\u00e1ngola sixty miles to Miraj, and a fourth eighty miles to Kar\u00e1d in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; and two went west and north-west, one passing eighty-nine miles to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by Mhasvad and Koregaon, and the other 148 miles to Poona. Of the eight lines which centred at Sholapur, two went north-east to the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, one being twenty-five miles to Tuljapur and the other thirty-eight miles to Dh\u00e1rshiv; one went 176 miles east to Haidarabad by Naldurga and Kaly\u00e1n; one went south-east twenty-two miles to Akalkot; one went south fifty-eight miles to Bijapur; two went west, one passing thirty-eight miles to Pandharpur and the other 152 miles to Poona by Tembourni and Indapur, and one went north-west fifty-four miles to the old fort of Paranda in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. The two lines which centred at P\u00e1gaon in B\u00e1rsi, went north-east to the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, one passing sixty-six miles to L\u00e1tur and the other sixty miles to Ambegaon.\n\nAt present (1883) Sholapur has ten lines of made roads together equal to 382 miles. Of these three are Provincial and seven local fund. The three Provincial lines are the Poona-Haidarabad road seventy-eight miles, the B\u00e1rsi road with its extension towards the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory sixty-two miles, and the Sholapur-\n\n---\n\n1 Road details are chiefly compiled from materials supplied by Mr. G. A. Bhat, assistant engineer.\n2 Government Selections, New Series, IV. 3-4. As in Poona carts originated with Sir George Wingate; they were first made at Tembourni in Karmala by a B\u00e1rsi named K\u00e1vasji Nasarv\u00e1n\u00edji. Carts were then distributed among husbandmen and the cost was recovered by instalments. This had so good an effect that by 1850, in the Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, and Karmala sub-divisions private carpenters made carts in numbers on the Government model but of rougher and cheaper materials. Ditto, 4-11.\nBij\u00e1pur road nineteen miles. Of the seven local fund lines four are first class, the B\u00e1rsi-Pandharpur road thirty miles, the Mohol-Pandharpur twenty-four miles, the Pandharpur-Janoni forty-two miles, and the Jeur-Karm\u00e1la with its extension towards Ahmadnagar and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory twenty-seven miles; and three are second class, the Shol\u00e1pur-B\u00e1rsi forty-two miles, the Shol\u00e1pur-Akalkot fifteen miles, and the Jeur-Pandharpur forty-three miles. As forming part of the direct line from Poona to Shol\u00e1pur and Haidarabad the seventy-eight miles within the district of the Poona-Haidarabad road was the first care of the Bombay Government. Between 1849 and 1855 the sixty-one miles of this section which run north-west to south-west from the Bhima on the borders of Poona and Shol\u00e1pur to the city of Shol\u00e1pur, were completed by Captain H. C. Adams of the Bombay Engineers at an estimated cost of \u00a322,020 (Rs. 2,20,200). The road enters the district at Ranjini on the Bhima in Karm\u00e1la and runs south-east through the subdivisions of Karm\u00e1la M\u00e1dha and Shol\u00e1pur. Of the towns and villages which lie on this road the chief are Tembhurni in Karm\u00e1la, Vadvad Shetphal Chikhli and Mohol in M\u00e1dha, and Kegaoon and Shol\u00e1pur in Shol\u00e1pur. It is an excellent murum or crumbly trap road, curbed and drained throughout except on the Bhima and Sina, and four other large streams which it was deemed unnecessary to bridge owing to the nearness of the rail road then under consideration. The Bhima and Sina which are both unfordable during the rains, are crossed by flying bridges, the Bhima near Ranjini in Karm\u00e1la and the Sina at Lamboti on the borders of M\u00e1dha and Shol\u00e1pur. From Shol\u00e1pur this road runs seventeen miles east towards Haidarabad up to the T\u00e1nduv\u00e1di stream which separates Shol\u00e1pur from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. The road was laid out and completed in 1858 at a cost of about \u00a34170 (Rs. 41,700). This portion carries a considerable traffic in grain, especially in wheat and gram. The B\u00e1rsi road, running nearly east and west for about thirty-five miles, was made and murumed in 1856 by Captain Haughton of the fourteenth Bombay Native Infantry. As the traffic from Tembhurni to B\u00e1rsi largely increased, the murum road was severely injured and cut up every season. After the construction of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in 1860, the traffic on this road rapidly increased and the twenty-one miles from B\u00e1rsi to Kurduv\u00e1di or B\u00e1rsi Road station became an important feeder of traffic from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, the average number of carts being estimated at about 500 a day. To carry this heavy traffic more easily an estimate was submitted to make a tram line from B\u00e1rsi to B\u00e1rsi Road station, and in 1870, at a cost of about \u00a350,000 (Rs. 5,00,000) this portion was metalled bridged and made fit to lay rails, though no rails were eventually laid down. From B\u00e1rsi the road is extended twenty-seven mileseast towards the large town of L\u00e1tur in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. Of these, nineteen miles from B\u00e1rsi to the village of Yedsi on the Talgh\u00e1t or the first range of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills were improved in 1862 by the civil department. In 1875 this portion was transferred to the public works department and during the 1876 famine was improved at a cost of about \u00a310,300 (Rs. 1,03,000) and made a Provincial road. In 1881-82 this portion was metalled and bridged throughout with\nmasonry road dams. For a little over half a mile the road runs over the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills; the ascent is easy and where necessary is provided with parapet walls. On this hill pass the traffic in cotton, oilseed, wheat, gram, and barley is unusually heavy, being over 500 carts a day. In 1881-82 the traffic yielded a toll revenue of about \u00a31700 (Rs. 17,000) and in 1882-83, as the toll on each bullock cart was reduced to 3d. (2 as.), it yielded about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). In continuation of this road the further eight miles above the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t range from Yedsi to Tadvala were improved and repaired by the civil department till 1882, but owing to heavy traffic this portion was so badly cut every year that plans and estimates amounting to \u00a36755 (Rs. 67,550) have been now submitted for Government sanction to metal and bridge it.\u00b9 Of the Shol\u00e1pur-Bij\u00e1pur road about nineteen miles run south within Shol\u00e1pur limits from Shol\u00e1pur to T\u00e1kli on the Bhima. Till 1874 this road was kept by the civil department. In 1875 it was transferred to the public works department and partly bridged at a cost of about \u00a36700 (Rs. 67,000), and during the 1876 famine it was further improved at a cost of about \u00a34800 (Rs. 48,000). At present (1883) it is a good murumed road. Of the two rivers, the Sina and Bhima which the road crosses, the Sina is crossed by a flying bridge at Vadakb\u00e1l ten miles south of Shol\u00e1pur and the Bhima is crossed by a flying bridge and by a ferry at T\u00e1kli nineteen miles south of Shol\u00e1pur. Since 1863 roads have been much improved from local funds. Of the seven local fund lines the B\u00e1rsi-Pandharpur road, running about thirty miles north and south, is a first class road. It is bridged and drained throughout except a few large streams. As a large number of pilgrims from the Deccan and North India visit the sacred shrine of Vithoba at Pandharpur from B\u00e1rsi Road station, this road carries a heavy cart and pilgrim traffic throughout the year. The Mohol-Pandharpur road, running about twenty-four miles east and west, is a first class local fund road. It joins Pandharpur with the Great Indian Peninsula railway at Mohol station by the shortest way. This road is largely used by pilgrims from the east. The Pandharpur-Janomi road, running forty-two miles south-west, is an important first class local fund road. In 1875 this road was transferred to the public works department and during the 1876 famine it was considerably improved at a cost of about \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000). It leads to the large market of Athni in Belgaum and carries to B\u00e1rsi Road station by Pandharpur a considerable traffic in grain and oil-seed from Belgaum and other parts of the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak. The Jeur-Karm\u00e1la road runs from the Jeur station eleven miles north to Karm\u00e1la. It is a first class local fund road and is bridged and drained throughout. From Karm\u00e1la the road branches into two, one branch passing eight miles north to Jategaon and the other eight miles north-east to Alj\u00e1pur.\n\n\u00b9 To the south of the village of Yedsi and about one-third of a mile from the road the well-known old temple of Shiv, called the R\u00e1m\u00edng, lies in a deep shaded valley and surrounded by the R\u00e1mmadi on three sides. In old times this place is said to have been a favourite abode of Hindu yog\u00eds or ascetics, who led their pious secluded life in neighbouring rock-cut caves. The villagers still consider the place a cool and beautiful summer retreat.\neight miles from Karmala to Aljapur were considerably improved during the 1876 famine at a cost of about \u00a31050 (Rs. 10,500). Most of the exports from South Ahmadnagar and from the parts of the Nizam's territory which lie east of Karmala go to Jeur station by the Jeur-Karmala road. Of the remaining three second class local fund roads the Sholapur-Barsi road runs forty-two miles north to Barsi from Sholapur, the Sholapur-Akalkot road runs fifteen miles southeast towards Akalkot, and the Jeur-Pandharpur road runs forty-three miles south to Pandharpur from Jeur station. These second class roads are fairly good. Besides these ten well-made lines, four other lines have been lately transferred to the public works department which will soon be made second class roads. Of these one runs from Sholapur ten miles north towards Tuljapur in the Nizam's territory, and three run from Pandharpur, one twenty-five miles west towards Karad through Pandharpur and Sangola, another twenty-six miles west towards Satara through Pandharpur and Malisiras, and the third forty-six miles north-west towards Mahad and Poona by Velapur, Malisiras, Nataputa, and Dharmapuri.\n\nBesides by made roads communication has been much improved by railways. The south-eastern branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway passes through the district with a length of 115 miles. Crossing the river Bhima in the north-west on the border of Poona and Sholapur, the railway enters the district and runs southeast to Ingalgai on the frontier of Sholapur and Akalkot. In these 115 miles are twelve stations, Katraj 189 miles from Bombay, Pomalvadi 195 miles, Sogaoon 203 miles, Jeur 213 miles, Kem 223 miles, Barsi Road 234 miles, Madha 244 miles, Angar 253 miles, Mohol 263 miles, Pakni 273 miles, Sholapur 283 miles, and Hotgi 292 miles. The line up to Sholapur was begun in 1856 and the portion from Diksai in Poona to Barsi Road was opened on the 23rd of October 1859, from Barsi Road to Mohol on the 20th January 1860, and from Mohol to Sholapur on the 6th June 1860. Work on the line from Sholapur southwards was begun on the 3rd August 1865 and the line was opened for traffic on the 1st February 1870. Except the bridges across the Bhima and the Sina, no engineering difficulties were met with. The Bhima bridge at 184 miles from Bombay and about 1317 feet long, has twenty-eight segmental arches of masonry of forty feet each. The piers are sixty feet high from rail level with foundations resting on rock and the flood stream is forty-six feet deep. It was built at a cost of about \u00a326,000 (Rs. 2,60,000). The Sina bridge at 269 miles from Bombay and about 575 feet long, has twelve segmental arches of masonry of forty feet each. The piers are fifty-four feet high from rail level resting on foundations partly of rock and partly of clay. The flood stream is forty-one feet deep. It was built at a cost of about \u00a314,800 (Rs. 1,48,000). Besides the ordinary building at the different stations costing \u00a3250 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 2500-Rs. 10,000) with quarters for a station master and a booking office, there is a refreshment room at Sholapur.\n\nBesides the Peninsula railway the East Deccan or Hotgi-Gadag section of the Southern Maratha and Bombay Karnatak railways which are now being made, runs north and south for eight miles in the\neast of the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division. This section leaves the Great Indian Peninsula railway at Hotgi station at 292 miles from Bombay which was chosen as the nearest point on the Peninsula railway to Bij\u00e1pur and as it affords an easy approach to the crossing of the Bhima river. About a quarter of a mile to the east of Hotgi station, after crossing a small stream, the line gets on to a ridge to which it keeps for about eight miles till the village of Jovalgi is reached and the line enters the Akalkot state. This ridge is fairly straight and flat and the work on it very easy, the general direction being nearly due south. The only station on this length of line is Hotgi. No bridges or other works call for remark.\n\nOf twelve toll bars four are on Provincial and eight on local fund roads. The four Provincial toll bars are one each at Kondi on the Poona-Shol\u00e1pur road, at Bor\u00e1mani on the Shol\u00e1pur-Haidarabad road, at Kuslamb on the B\u00e1rsi-Mominabad road, and at Papaus on the B\u00e1rsi and B\u00e1rsi Road station road. The eight local fund toll bars are one each at T\u00e1kli on the Shol\u00e1pur-Bij\u00e1pur road, at Tirhe on the Shol\u00e1pur-Pandharpur road, at Ulhe on the Shol\u00e1pur-Tulj\u00e1pur road, at Kumbh\u00e1ri on the Shol\u00e1pur-Akalkot road, at K\u00e1krumb on the Shol\u00e1pur-B\u00e1rsi road, at Ashti on the Kurduv\u00e1di-Pandharpur road, at Devl\u00e1li on the Jeur-Karm\u00e1l\u00e1 road, and at V\u00e1kri on the Pandharpur-Poona road. All the tolls are yearly sold by auction to the highest bidder. The amount realized in 1882-83 was \u00a33449 (Rs. 34,490) on the Provincial roads and \u00a31323 (Rs. 13,230) on the local fund roads, that is a total toll revenue of \u00a34772 (Rs. 47,720).\n\nBesides three Collector\u2019s bungalows at Mohol and Sheptphal in M\u00e1dha and at P\u00e1ngao in B\u00e1rsi, there are four bungalows for European travellers at Shol\u00e1pur, Ashti lake, Pandharpur lake, and B\u00e1rsi Road station. Besides the Collector\u2019s and travellers\u2019 bungalows there are 319 rest-houses or dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s for native travellers. Of these nineteen are in Shol\u00e1pur, thirty-nine in B\u00e1rsi, thirty-six in M\u00e1dha, forty-three in Karm\u00e1l\u00e1, sixty in Pandharpur, thirty-seven in M\u00e1lsiras, and eighty-five in S\u00e1ngola.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The nineteen in Shol\u00e1pur are: One each at Ahirv\u00e1di, Bor\u00e1mani, Ghodeshvar or Begamour, Kant\u00ed-budruk, Kasegaon, Kumbh\u00e1ri, Lamb\u00f3ti, Mandrup, Pathri, Savatkhed, Singoli, T\u00e1kh, T\u00e1ndulv\u00e1di, Tirhe, Ulhe, Vadakbal, V\u00e1lsang and Vangi.

The forty-three in Karm\u00e1l\u00e1 are, one each at Adbegaon, Akol\u00e1khurd, Alj\u00e9pur, Bitargaon-V\u00e1ngi, Dahiv\u00e1di, Devl\u00e1li, Gulsadi, Hivre, J\u00e1tegaon, Jeur, Kandar, Kavitgaon, Kem, Kolegaon, Kondharchincholi, Korti, Mangi, Padle, P\u00e1nde, R\u00e1juri, Sade, S\u00e1toli, Sheptphal, Sing\u00e9v\u00e1di, Son\u00e1ri, and Vadshivne; two each at Pothre, Pom\u00e1lv\u00e1di, and V\u00e1ngi; and eleven at Karm\u00e1l\u00e1. The sixty in Pandharpur are, one each at Adhiv, Aher\u00e1babaugaon, Ambe, Badalkote, Bathan, Bhatumbre, Bhovali, Bhose, Degaonbudruk, Gadhegaon, Gardi, Ghurnik\u00e9, Gursale, Isbavi, Jaloli, Karole, Kharsoli, Khed-Bhalavani, Khed-Bhose, Kondarki, Korti, Kuroli, Machnur, Mundhev\u00e1di, N\u00e1r\u00e1yanchincholi, Ojh\u00e9v\u00e1di, Palsi, Phulchincholi, Rhatvadi, Sarkoli, Segaon-Bhalavani, Shelve, Sheptphal, Shevte, Sidev\u00e1di,\nThree flying bridges and three ferries are supported from local funds; besides these about sixty ferries at Pandharpur belong to private persons. Of the three flying bridges one is on the Poona-Sholapur road at Lamboti about fifteen miles west of Sholapur, and two are on the Sholapur-Bijapur road, one at Vadakbal across the Sina ten miles south of Sholapur, and the other at Takli across the Bhima nineteen miles south of Sholapur. Of the three ferries one plies across the Sina at Tirhe and one across the Bhima near Begampur on the Sholapur-Sangola road, and in addition to the flying bridge the third plies across the Bhima at Takli on the Sholapur-Bijapur road. The flying bridges consist of a galvanized wire rope 3\u00bd feet in circumference, with a deflection of 1/5th of the span, supported on teakwood standards set in coursed stone and lime masonry on the banks. The raft consists of two boats joined together and supporting a platform twenty-nine to 29\u00bd feet by fourteen to eighteen feet. It is provided with a wooden railing and is large enough for four laden bullock carts or for sixty passengers. The boats forming the bridges are twenty-nine to 29\u00bd feet long, seven to 7\u00bd feet wide, and 3\u00bd to 3\u00be feet deep. The ferries are single boats 27\u00bd feet long, nine wide, and 3\u00bd to four deep; when laden they draw 1\u00bd to 1\u00be feet. They are large enough to carry two laden carts or fifty passengers. All are made entirely of teak and were built on the spot or at Bombay. The cost of a flying bridge with a raft ranged from \u00a3600 to \u00a3900 (Rs. 6000 - 9000) and that of the ferries or single boats from \u00a380 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 800 - 1000). The bridges and ferries are in charge of t\u00e1ndels who are paid 10s. (Rs. 5) a month from local funds all the year round for steering the boats and taking care of them when not in use. The crew are supplied by the ferry contractors and are paid monthly 12s. to 14s. (Rs. 6 - 7). The total yearly revenue from the bridges and ferries is about \u00a3183 (Rs. 1830).\n\nSholapur forms part of the Ahmadnagar postal division. Of the forty-one post offices one is a disbursing office, one a town sub-office, nineteen sub-offices, and twenty-four village offices. Of these, besides the two disbursing and town sub-offices at Sholapur, thirteen sub and twenty village offices are within British limits, two sub and four village offices are within the limits of the Sholapur and Kolhapur and Bombay Karnatak agencies, and four sub-offices are within the limits of the Nizam's territory.

Of the post offices within the limits of the Shol\u00e1pur and Kolhapur and Bombay Karn\u00e1tak agencies the two sub-offices are at Akalkot and Mangalvedha; and the four village offices are at Dudhni, Maindargi, Modnimb, and Pimpalner. The four sub-offices in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory are at Dh\u00e1rashiv, L\u00e1tur, Mominabad, and Parli. The disbursing post office at Shol\u00e1pur is in charge of a postmaster who draws a yearly salary of \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200). The sub-offices are in charge of sub-postmasters who draw a yearly salary of \u00a318 to \u00a348 (Rs. 180-480). The village post offices are in charge of schoolmasters who receive, in addition to their pay as schoolmasters, yearly allowances varying from \u00a32 8s. to \u00a37 4s. (Rs. 24-72). In towns and villages which have post offices letters are delivered by thirty-one postmen drawing a yearly salary of \u00a37 4s. to \u00a312 (Rs.72-120). In small villages without post offices letters are delivered by sixty-seven postmen. Of these forty-two are paid yearly from \u00a39 12s. to \u00a310 16s. (Rs. 96-108) from the Imperial post and twenty-five are paid yearly from \u00a310 16s. to \u00a312 (Rs. 108-120) from the Provincial post. In some villages letters are also delivered by postal runners who receive yearly \u00a314s. (Rs.12) for this additional work. Mails to and from Bombay to Shol\u00e1pur are carried by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. From the large towns of B\u00e1rsi, Pandharpur, and Karm\u00e1la which lie off the railway line, mails are carried in t\u00e1ng\u00e1s or pony carts, from B\u00e1rsi and Pandharpur to B\u00e1rsi Road station and from Karm\u00e1la to Jeur station. The post offices are supervised by the superintendent of post offices Ahmadnagar division, who has a yearly salary of \u00a3300 (Rs.3000) and whose head-quarters are at Ahmadnagar. The superintendent is assisted in Shol\u00e1pur by an inspector who draws \u00a396 (Rs. 960) a year and whose head-quarters are at B\u00e1rsi Road station.\n\nBesides the railway telegraph offices at the different stations, there are two Government telegraph offices at Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi.\n\nThe chief agencies for spreading imports and gathering exports are trade-centres, markets, fairs, village-shops, and travelling carriers. The largest centres of internal trade are Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, and Pandharpur, and next to these Vair\u00e1g, M\u00e1dha, Mohol, Karm\u00e1la, Akluj, N\u00e1tepute, and S\u00e1ngola. Of these Shol\u00e1pur, Mohol, and M\u00e1dha are near the railway. But Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi being on the edge of the district, their connection is chiefly with the country outside it while the trade of Pandharpur rests on its necessities as a place of pilgrimage; so that the lesser centres do not draw their supplies immediately from the larger centres but directly from the same places as they. The number of traders is about 6000, the chief being Ling\u00e1yats, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, Gujars, V\u00e1nis, N\u00e1gars, Shimpis, Nir\u00e1lis, M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, Br\u00e1hmans, Bohoras, and Khatris with capitals of \u00a3200 to \u00a310,000 (Rs. 2000-Rs. 1,00,000).\nThey are mostly independent. Some are agents to Bombay and other traders for whom they gather and export cotton, grain, and other local produce, and import rice, hardware, piecegoods, and salt. In large trade centres husbandmen have generally their adaty\u00e1s or middlemen, through whom they sell their field produce. The export trade of the district is chiefly carried on by moneylenders to whom husbandmen give their produce in payment of loans. Some well-to-do husbandmen directly export their field produce to a small extent. The import trade is chiefly carried on both by wholesale traders of large trade centres and other petty local traders who often buy their stock from wholesale traders. The trade of B\u00e1rsi requires special notice as it is almost entirely a transit trade. B\u00e1rsi forms the western outlet for the produce of all the Niz\u00e1m's territory east of it, here generally known as the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, comprising the towns and markets of L\u00e9tur, Gang\u00e1khed, Mominabad, Nandiar, Pathri, Hingoli, and Bhir, which also receive their imports through it. Of the articles almost entirely produced within Niz\u00e1m's limits which pass through and generally change hands in B\u00e1rsi, the chief is cotton the yearly value of which is estimated at \u00a3360,000 (Rs. 36 l\u00e1khs). The next is linseed whose yearly value is estimated at \u00a360,000 (Rs. 6 l\u00e1khs). Oil produced from a mixture of various seeds including k\u00e1rle or niger seed, til or sesame, havri til or white sesame, kardai or safflower, and bhuimug or groundnut, is estimated at a yearly value of \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2 l\u00e1khs). The value of the export of turmeric, which is mainly produced in the B\u00e1rsi sub-division, is estimated at \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2 l\u00e1khs). In the same way, the imports of which the chief are salt, piecegoods, yarn, sacking, and ironware, pass through B\u00e1rsi on their way to the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t. The exporters of cotton, oils, and linseed are all Bombay men, and do not touch imports: otherwise the same firms often deal in both imports and exports. Consignments up to \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) in value are ordered from Bombay through agents. To get consignments worth more than \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) dealers either go themselves or send a confidential clerk. At B\u00e1rsi, besides Bombay and local native traders two European firms Messrs. Ralli Brothers and Messrs. Gaddum Bythell and Company deal largely in cotton and linseed.\n\nThe position of the adaty\u00e1s, that is brokers or agents, is a peculiar feature of the district trade. The following details belong to B\u00e1rsi, but with few changes they apply to Shol\u00e1pur and other places. The broker or adatya is a Komti or Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1ni, a Br\u00e1hman, or a M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, with little or no capital. He enjoys good credit with the brokers and moneylenders, and can get financial accommodation in time of need with comparative ease. In all cases, husbandmen and dealers bring their raw produce to an adatya and are guided by him in disposing of it. The cultivator will probably wait four or five days in B\u00e1rsi. If by that time his goods have not been sold or if there is a serious fall in prices, or a probability in the adatya's opinion of an advantageous rise, the cultivator returns home, leaving his goods in the charge of the adatya, and getting from him an advance of fifty or sixty per cent of their value, which the adatya has got from a\nmoneylender. In a month or so the cultivator returns to receive the balance. The adatya charges a commission of 1s. (8 as.) on each bundle or boja of 250 pounds for cotton, and one per cent on the proceeds of other goods, with interest on any advance made. The adatya has no direct or indirect interest in the rise and fall of prices, but simply earns his commission by selling the goods, the cultivator or dealer getting the profit and loss of the rise and fall of prices. It is frequently the case that all the cultivators of certain villages go to the same adatya year after year, unless they have grave cause of dissatisfaction. Most brokers deal uprightly with the cultivator, who in most cases is perfectly innocent of arithmetic, and he in turn places great faith in his adatya, and agrees to whatever he does for him without questioning.\n\nForty-two weekly markets are held in the district, ten in the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division one each at Begampur, Keshar Javalge, Mandrup, Mangrul, Mardi, Musti, Salgar, Shol\u00e1pur, Vad\u00e1le, and Valsang; four in the B\u00e1rsi sub-division one each at B\u00e1rsi, P\u00e1ngri, Tadvale, and Vair\u00e1g; eight in the Karm\u00e1la sub-division one each at Jinti, Karm\u00e1la, Kem, Kondhej, Korti, Son\u00e1ri, Tembhurni, and V\u00e1ngi; eleven in the M\u00e1dha sub-division one each at Angar, Ashti, Bembre, Kurdu, Kurduv\u00e1di, Kurul, Laul, M\u00e1dha, Mohol, Narkhed, and Patkule; three in the Pandharpur sub-division one each at Bh\u00e1loni, Karkam, and Pandharpur; two in the M\u00e1lsiras sub-division one each at Akluj and N\u00e1tetepu; and four in the S\u00e1ngola sub-division one each at Gherdi, Jaule, N\u00e1zre, and S\u00e1ngola. At these places petty traders, peddlers, and hawkers set up booths and offer for sale their goods consisting of cotton, grain, groceries, spices, cloth, yarn, oils, earthenware, clarified butter, hides, and fuel. Of these the local production of grain and oil meets local wants with a margin for export in good years. These markets are held generally for the whole day. In some places they are held during the heat of the day and are closed in the evening. Shol\u00e1pur is the largest market; it is held on every Tuesday and the buyers and sellers number about 10,000. It is a distributing as well as a gathering centre. The producers themselves sell grain, earthenware, yarn, and garden produce. Fuel is sold by Mh\u00e1s and other low caste people who gather it in the neighbouring forest lands. Ling\u00e1yats, Gujars, and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris mostly sell groceries. The sellers are chiefly from Shol\u00e1pur and the surrounding villages. The buyers are the townspeople and traders or their agents. There is little barter. Cattle markets are held in almost all trade centres. At Shol\u00e1pur is a considerable cattle market, where cows, she-buffaloes, ponies, and sheep and goats are offered for sale. No change has lately been made in the local market system.\n\nOf nineteen fairs held in the district one held at Shol\u00e1pur on the 12th of January, three held at Pandharpur in April July and November, and one held at Son\u00e1ri in April are the most important. The details are:\nThe fairs are places for distributing as well as for gathering goods. The sellers are generally V\u00e1nis, Ling\u00e1yats, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, and cultivators. The chief articles for sale are cloth, pots, grain, glass bangles, and live stock. The buyers are townspeople, pilgrims, and neighbouring villagers. There is no barter.\n\nNearly every village has a shopkeeper, generally either a Gujar, a M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, or a Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1ni. He keeps for sale grain, clarified butter, oils, molasses, spices, coarse blankets, salt, and cloth, and sometimes sugar and betelnut. He gets the articles he requires for his stock from one of the traders in the chief town of the sub-division or from any near market town. In his village he is a general dealer and sells his goods to the villagers and travellers who happen to stop at that village. His whole stock is worth \u00a310 to \u00a350 (Rs. 100-Rs. 500) and in a large village \u00a310 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 100-1000). Villagers either make cash payments or clear their accounts periodically. Payments are occasionally made in kind. Only middle class and poor villagers deal with the village shopman. Whenever they can, the rich bring their supplies from market towns and trade centres. If the village shopman is a M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, he is generally both a shopkeeper and a moneylender. As a shopkeeper he has generally no agent to go to fairs or market towns. He goes himself or if possible sends one of his family. He has seldom any connection with a large trading firm. His position has not changed of late years.\n\nBesides by shopkeepers, especially in Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi provisions are supplied by Lam\u00e1n hawkers. They buy grain from traders in central towns and move about carrying their stock on pack-bullocks to several places of importance in the country round. They have also dealings with some of the villages in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country. Since the opening of railways the number of Lam\u00e1ns has greatly fallen. There are no travelling carriers with carts. In some parts of the district village peddlers are seen. Some of these are craftsmen who during the rainy months work a stock of goods and in the fair months move from village to village offering them for sale. The articles are chiefly coarse cloth, small metal vessels, and in some cases groceries. Peddlers are generally of the Ling\u00e1yat, K\u00e1s\u00e1r, or Kunbi castes. They carry their stock on bullocks and sell it to cultivators and others. The traffic is conducted by cash payments though barter is\nnot unknown, and as they periodically visit the same villages they also sell on credit.\n\nThe following are the chief imports: Of building materials teakwood, nails, screws, and other articles are brought from Bombay and Poona by Lingayat Musalm\u00e1n and carpenter traders and are sold wholesale to the people or to petty traders who retail them in their shops. These articles are used by the rich in building houses. Of house furniture, including utensils, ready-made brass and copper mugs and other vessels are brought by K\u00e1s\u00e1rs from Bombay, Poona, N\u00e1sik, and Nagar and sold retail to the people in their shops which are generally in large trade centres. K\u00e1s\u00e1rs also import from Bombay copper and brass sheets which they make into vessels. Of wooden furniture the chief imports are chairs, tables, couches, benches, cupboards, and boxes. Of food drink and drugs, salt, cocoanuts, dates, oil, sugar, groceries, and spices are brought from Bombay and the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak. Salt was formerly brought by Lam\u00e1ns on pack bullocks; it is now brought by rail. Of tools and appliances iron is brought from Bombay and made into nails, horse-shoes, and rough field tools. Of dress including ornaments, European twist piecegoods and flannel come from Bombay. A large part of the country cloth and yarn sold in the district is made locally; the rest comes from Ahmadnagar, Bhir, J\u00e1lna, Muhlingpur, N\u00e1gpur, N\u00e1r\u00e1yanpeth, and Yeola. Gold, silver, pearls, and jewels chiefly come from Bombay.\n\nThe chief exports are of vegetable products, cotton, grain, oilseed, and earthnuts; of animal products honey, wax, lac, and hides and horns; and of manufactured articles cloth, carts, indigo, oil, and clarified butter. The following are the chief details regarding exports. Little cotton is grown in Shol\u00e1pur. Almost the whole local supply of cotton is used in local spinning and weaving and in some sub-divisions the quantity grown is not enough to meet the local demand. Almost all the cotton exported comes from outside of the district. Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi are the two chief cotton marts. The chief cotton traders are Bombay Bh\u00e1tias and some local Lingayats, Komtis, Gujars, and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. Till about 1870 Shol\u00e1pur was the only large cotton mart. Since 1870 B\u00e1rsi has taken most of the cotton trade of Shol\u00e1pur and is now the first cotton mart in the district. Of the cotton which once drew to Shol\u00e1pur a number of European and native merchants from Bombay, most came from the north and north-east of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory as well as from Bel\u00e1ri, T\u00e1l\u00edkoti, and other parts of the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak in the south. At Shol\u00e1pur, about 1866, when steam presses were erected, the cotton sent by rail and road to Bombay amounted to 28,000 full-pressed bales and 80,000 bundles a year. About this time, the railway rates for salt and piecegoods being higher than at present, Bombay salt and piecegoods came to Shol\u00e1pur in carts from Panvel at a cheaper cost than by rail; these carts on return took cotton to Panvel at a cheaper cost than by rail. Since then the railway rates on salt and piecegoods were reduced to secure the export of Shol\u00e1pur cotton by rail, and not a single cart-load of cotton now goes by road from Shol\u00e1pur to Panvel. In the city of Shol\u00e1pur, till about 1870, cotton used to be sold through\nmiddlemen or *adaty\u00e1s*, of whom there are forty. Of these forty middlemen fifteen are rich moneylenders owning large cotton godowns, and twenty-five are grain dealers who keep their consignments of cotton near and round their shops. In the cotton-growing districts of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory and in T\u00e1l\u00edkoti and Bel\u00e1ri whence cotton came to Shol\u00e1pur, the husbandmen generally sold their cotton to local dealers. When they had enough cotton, these local dealers sent it in charge of one of their number to Shol\u00e1pur to be sold through brokers or *adaty\u00e1s*. Sometimes when the price offered by the local dealers was too low, the husbandmen of the cotton-growing districts clubbed together and themselves sent the cotton to the Shol\u00e1pur brokers. Between 1866 and 1868 when cotton came in large quantities to Shol\u00e1pur, about three-fourths was brought by the local Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1ni dealers of the cotton-growing districts. Upon receipt by the broker of a consignment of cotton he advanced cash to the amount of one-fifth to three-fourths of the value of cotton, according to the credit of the consignors. It was the broker\u2019s business to receive charge of the cotton, to store it, to watch over it, and to sell it at the best market rate on behalf of his *vachhiy\u00e1t* or consignor. The broker was also responsible for all losses in cases of defaulting buyers. For this trouble and risk, on each *boja* or bundle of 250 pounds the broker charged a monthly godown rent of 3d. (2 *as.*), and a commission of 1s. 9d. (14 *as.*). Of this commission 9d. (6 *as.*) were paid by the owner of the cotton and 1s. (8 *as.*) by the buyer. In the city of Shol\u00e1pur this system of selling cotton still obtains, but cotton has forsaken the Shol\u00e1pur market. The fall of the Shol\u00e1pur cotton trade is chiefly due to two causes. As the Shol\u00e1pur brokers began to take from each bundle or *dokra* a considerable quantity of cotton as a toll or *dasturi*, the cotton dealers of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory made B\u00e1rsi their chief cotton mart. The other cause was that when the Peninsula railway was carried to R\u00e1ichur, the cotton dealers of the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak began to send cotton from stations nearer the cotton land than Shol\u00e1pur. Still, at present (1884) a considerable quantity of cotton comes to Shol\u00e1pur from B\u00e1galkot, Hungund, Muddebih\u00e1l, and T\u00e1l\u00edkoti in Bij\u00e1pur. To the first buyer in the Bij\u00e1pur district cotton costs \u00a36 to \u00a38 (Rs. 60-80) the *khandi* of 784 pounds; on this, cart carriage to Shol\u00e1pur costs 8s. to 16s. (Rs. 4-8), and rail carriage from Shol\u00e1pur to Bombay costs \u00a32 (Rs. 20). When the trade in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country cotton left Shol\u00e1pur the steam presses were moved from Shol\u00e1pur to B\u00e1rsi. Most Bombay traders also went to B\u00e1rsi which became the chief cotton mart. B\u00e1rsi lies forty-seven miles north of Shol\u00e1pur and has about 10,000 people. It has a large trade in cotton and linseed. Cotton comes to B\u00e1rsi chiefly from Dignor, Dismatt, Khamdabar, Kirkeli, Madnor, Makair, Nandiar, Parli, and Unvir in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. At B\u00e1rsi cotton is bought and sold in two ways. Either the local dealers or husbandmen of the cotton-growing districts themselves bring the cotton to the market and sell it through brokers or *adaty\u00e1s* in the same way as at Shol\u00e1pur; or after the Diw\u00e1li holidays, that is in the beginning of the Hindu new year in October-November, the native traders or their agents or *gum\u00e1st\u00e1s* start from Bombay or B\u00e1rsi for the cotton-growing dis-\ntricts of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s dominions. Here, through a respectable moneylender the traders enter with the husbandmen into a contract for cotton by paying a commission of 2s. (Re. 1) for every bundle or boja of 250 pounds. The moneylender guarantees the fulfilment of this contract. In these cotton-growing districts the moneylenders have such influence and are so much trusted by the husbandmen that they make no cotton contract except through the moneylenders. On the day the contract is signed by the husbandman and endorsed by the moneylender, a draft on Bombay in full payment of the cotton contracted is given to the moneylender at eleven days\u2019 sight. The contract always accompanies this draft. Contracts are not made for selection or classification. Contracts made through moneylenders are seldom broken.\n\nOf other exports under grain come jv\u00e1ri, b\u00e1jri, wheat, gram, and pulse. Jv\u00e1ri and wheat are largely sent to Bombay from the Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi Road stations. In an ordinary year the greatest export of grain averages about 127,000 tons, chiefly from Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi. Of oilseeds, linseed, which grows to a considerable extent in the district, is largely sent to Bombay generally by Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s and sometimes by Ling\u00e1yat Komti Gujar and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri traders of Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi. In Shol\u00e1pur linseed sells at about twenty-five pounds (8\u00bd shers) the rupee, and the cost of carriage from Shol\u00e1pur to Bombay is 14s. to 16s. (Rs. 7-8) the khandi. Hides and horns are sent in small quantities by Labbey Musalm\u00e1ns. Since the 1876 famine which greatly reduced the number of cattle, the export of hides and horns has been considerably reduced. Clarified butter is made by Gavlis or milkmen, and is largely sent to Bombay by Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s. At Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, and Pandharpur native carts are made by S\u00fat\u00e1s and Gh\u00eds\u00e1dis and sent all over the district. At Shol\u00e1pur and Karm\u00e1la cart traffic is brisk, and Karm\u00e1la carts are known for strength and cheapness. At Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, and Pandharpur country cloth is woven by a large number of S\u00e1lis or Koshtis. From the S\u00e1lis the cloth is generally bought by local traders on market days and is partly used locally and partly sent to Poona, Ahmadnagar, and Bombay. When hard-pressed for cash, as soon as they are woven, the S\u00e1lis themselves sell their piecegoods from door to door.\n\nThe extension of the Peninsula Railway to Shol\u00e1pur in 1860 and to R\u00e1ichur in 1870, has much reduced the cart and pack bullock traffic which went from Shol\u00e1pur in the east towards the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory and in the west towards Bombay by Panvel. By the opening of the East Deccan Railway from Hotgi in Shol\u00e1pur to Gadag in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r this traffic will further be reduced towards the south and Shol\u00e1pur will suffer as a trade centre.\n\nOf the four years ending 1883, for two years 1880 and 1881 complete railway traffic returns are available for all stations of the district and for two years 1882 and 1883 details are available only for six large stations. During these four years, excluding details of six minor stations since 1882, the district passenger traffic rose steadily from 398,774 in 1880 to 478,966 in 1883. Of these four years, during the three years ending 1882, the goods traffic also steadily\nrose from 86,850 tons in 1880 to 197,372 tons in 1882; in 1883 it fell to 167,143 tons. Of the two largest stations B\u00e1rsi Road and Shol\u00e1pur, at B\u00e1rsi Road, except a slight fall in 1881, the passenger traffic during the four years ending 1883 rose from 109,311 in 1880 to 121,426 in 1883; and for the three years ending 1882 the goods traffic rose from 38,520 tons in 1880 to 81,051 tons in 1882; in 1883 it fell to 71,522 tons. At Shol\u00e1pur, of the four years, during the three years ending 1882 the passenger traffic rose steadily from 189,024 in 1880 to 226,621 in 1882 and the goods traffic from 37,528 tons in 1880 to 65,669 tons in 1882; in 1883 the traffic fell slightly, passengers to 224,386 and goods to 52,330 tons. Of the other four large stations for which details are available for all the four years ending 1883, the passenger traffic rose steadily at all the stations, at Jeur from 18,809 to 27,878, at M\u00e1dha from 16,832 to 24,391, at Mohol from 30,310 to 47,900, and at Hotgi from 2786 to 32,985. Of the four years, for the three years ending 1882 the goods traffic for three stations rose steadily at Jeur from 4590 to 17,652 tons, at M\u00e1dha from 4084 to 11,811 tons, and at Hotgi from two to 17,258 tons; in 1883 the goods traffic fell slightly, to 11,443 tons at Jeur, to 10,078 tons at M\u00e1dha, and to 16,818 tons at Hotgi. At Mohol, during the four years ending 1883, the goods traffic, except a slight fall in 1881, rose from 1305 tons in 1880 to 4952 tons in 1883. At Hotgi the unusual rise in traffic is chiefly due to the carriage of railway materials for making the East Deccan or Hotgi Gadag railway.

The chief are the dyeing of yarn, the handloom weaving of cotton cloth and\nwoollen blankets, the spinning weaving and pressing of cotton by steam power, oil pressing, and working in gold and silver, copper and brass, iron, stone, earth, wood, and leather.\n\nThread dyeing is partly in the hands of weavers and is partly along with cloth-dyeing a separate industry. Of about 1000 dyers, chiefly Hindu Rangaris and Niralis, about 300 are at Sholapur and 100 at Valsang. The dyers of Sholapur and Karmala have a good local name. At present the industry is not thriving. Calico printing is carried on to a large extent in Sholapur, Barsi, and Pandharpur. The chief dye-stuffs are safflower or kusumb, red ochre or kapila, cochineal or kirmaj dane, sandars wood or surangi, and indigo or nil. Of these dyes about 500 acres of sandars wood are yearly tilled in the Barsi sub-division. It is sown in September in the same manner as jv\u00e1ri. The plants are allowed to grow for three years, and are then pulled up by the roots and the small roots cut off and dried in the sun. From these roots the dye is made. The cost of tillage is estimated at about 2s.6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) the acre, and the profit at 6s. (Rs. 3). About twenty tons (600 mans) of sandars wood is yearly grown at Barsi. Of this about a ton (30 mans) is locally used and the rest is sent to Sholapur Poona and Ahmadnagar. In Sholapur sandars wood sells at 2\u00bdd. to 3d. (1\u00bd-2 as.) a pound, cochineal at 2\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (1\u00bd-3 as.), safflower at 3d. to 4\u00bdd. (2-3 as.), and indigo at 4s. (Rs. 2). Of the different dyes sold in the district the sale of sandars wood and indigo at Sholapur is each valued at about \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000), of cochineal and red ochre each at \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000), and of safflower at \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000), making a total sale of \u00a311,400 (Rs. 11,400); at Barsi the sale of sandars wood is valued at \u00a380 (Rs. 800), of indigo at \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), and of safflower at \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000), making a total sale of \u00a3580 (Rs. 5800). Of the articles dyed with these stuffs silk is dyed magenta and yellow. The silk is first softened by being placed with lime and carbonate of soda in boiling water; afterwards to dye it magenta, it is steeped six days in the water in which cochineal has been dissolved. Silk is dyed yellow by being boiled in a solution of water, carbonate of soda, red ochre, and oil made from the common kardai or safflower. Cloth is dyed red and blue. The red colour is produced by sandars wood or by safflower. In dyeing with sandars wood the wood is ground to powder, and about eighty pounds (1 man) of this powder, together with 1\u00bd pounds (\u00bc sher) of alum, are dissolved in water. The cloth is steeped in oil, then in salt water, and then put in the solution of the dye. It is dried and dipped in the dye alternately two or three times. Safflower is used chiefly for dyeing turbans. The safflower is moistened and tied in a cloth in the sun for twenty-four hours, 1\u00bd pounds (\u00bc sher) of wild fig tree ashes being mixed with about eighty pounds (1 man) of safflower. The cloth is soaked in water in which fig tree ashes have been mixed, and the dye is applied after it has been washed. Cloth is dyed blue with indigo. The indigo is first boiled for two hours and compressed into round balls. A solution is then made consisting of this prepared indigo, salt, gul or molasses, and lime in equal quantities. In this solution the cloth is steeped three or four times,\nbeing always dried before it is steeped. All these dyes are permanent.\n\nOf the industries of the district, next to agriculture, spinning and weaving are the most important. Silk and the finer sorts of cotton cloth, such as turbans and women's robes, are woven at Sholapur and at most of the towns and large villages in the Sholapur sub-division, particularly at Valsang. They are also produced at Karkam in the Pandharpur subdivision, at Sangola and the villages round, and at Karmala and the villages round. The coarser kinds of cotton cloth also and woollen blankets are woven at all these places, and at Barsi and three other towns in that sub-division, in six towns or large villages in the Madha sub-division, and at Tembourni in the Karmala sub-division. At Pandharpur and at Natepute in the Malsiras sub-division there is a considerable manufacture of blankets. At Sholapur there are 6425 looms and 4250 people supported by weaving, of whom five-eighths are Hindus and three-eighths Musalmans; at Valsang there are one hundred weaving families; at Karkam there are 830 looms, of which fifty are for blankets; at Sangola there are fifty looms; at and around Karmala 229 looms for cotton and ninety-six for woollen goods. In the Barsi sub-division there are 376 looms for cotton goods and 117 for woollens; in the Madha subdivision 200 families are employed in weaving; at Tembourni there are thirty looms. The blanket looms at Pandharpur number forty and at Natepute about 100. Chiefly at Barsi, Karmala, Mandrup, Mohol, Pandharpur, Sangola, Sholapur, Vairag, and Valsang, weaving is largely carried on by about 1000 families of Koshti, Sali, Khatri, and Momin weavers. Some of the weavers weave independently; others both men and women weave on wages of 3d. to 9d. (2-6 as.) a day. Weavers work from morning to evening and rest for an hour at noon. In weaving fine women's robes, bodices, and other fine cloth steam-spun yarn chiefly that woven at the Sholapur mill, is generally used; and in weaving pasodis or cotton sheets, jajams or floor cloths, jhuls or horse-cloth, phadkis or scarves and other coarse cloth hand-spun yarn is used. Hand-made fine cloth is not much liked and rarely goes outside of the district. Owing to the comparative cheapness of machine-woven English and Bombay cloth, the hand-made cloth of the country finds little favour among the well-to-do, and consequently the hand-loom industry is said to have fallen seriously in the last twenty years. Still some of the well-to-do hold to the hand-loom cloth, and will wear no other. The labouring classes find the thick strong hand-made cloth cheapest in the long run. The hand-loom cloth called khareva is much used by all classes for bedding.\n\nBesides hand-spinning and weaving a steam-spinning and weaving mill, the property of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Limited, began working at Sholapur in March 1877. This company has a nominal capital of \u00a380,000 (Rs. 8 lakhs), in 1884 an actual capital of \u00a367,850 (Rs. 6,78,500), and is managed by Messrs. Morarji Gokaldas and Company of Bombay. The machinery, driven by two engines, each of forty horse-power, works 20,888 spindles and 175 looms and employs 850 hands at a monthly\nwage expenditure of about \u00a3770 (Rs. 7,700). Of the workmen about 150 are Musalm\u00e1ns and the rest Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Besides two Europeans who act as mill manager and assistant manager, two P\u00e1rs\u00eds are employed as fitters. Except about 100 hands who are from M\u00e1lvan in Ratn\u00e1giri, the rest belong to Shol\u00e1pur and the neighbourhood. About half of the staff get fixed wages and the rest are paid by piece work. Of those who get fixed wages the mill-manager and spinning master draws a monthly salary of \u00a340 (Rs. 400), the assistant manager \u00a310 (Rs. 100), the native engineer \u00a315 (Rs. 150), the weaving master \u00a37 (Rs. 70), the card, frame, mule, and throstle masters \u00a34 to \u00a36 (Rs. 40-60), the mechanic foreman \u00a34 4s. (Rs. 42), and smiths and fitters \u00a31 6s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 13-20). Of the hands who are paid by the piece, the women employed as reelers earn 10s. to 18s. (Rs. 5 - 9) a month; weavers 16s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 8 - 20) at \u00bdd. a pound of cloth, and frame-tenders 16s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 8 - 12) at 1\u00bdd. to 1\u00bed. a hand. Of the hands who are paid fixed wages, the men earn 12s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 6 - 12), the women about 10s. (Rs. 5), and the boys 8s. to 18s. (Rs. 4 - 9) a month. When temporary hands are employed, a man is paid 6d. (4 as.) a day and a woman or a boy 3\u00bdd. (2\u00bd as.). The total amount paid as wages in 1883-84 was \u00a38620 (Rs. 86,200). The working hours are from sunrise to sunset, half an hour from twelve to half-past twelve being allowed for rest. Two or three holidays are given in the month. Of 1,758,000 pounds or 784 tons of cotton, the average yearly consumption in the mill, about two-thirds comes from B\u00e1rsi and one-third is bought in the local market. The daily outturn of yarn is 5500 to 6000 pounds. The wholesale price is about \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 125) a bale of 300 pounds. Most of the outturn is used locally, bought by local dealers, distributed over the chief market towns, and used by hand-loom weavers. A portion is worked into cloth, the chief kind being longcloth and occasionally sheets, dangri, sail-cloth, and towels. The cloth is sold wholesale at 10\u00bdd. (7 as.) a pound. Besides being used in Shol\u00e1pur the cloth goes to B\u00e1rsi, Bij\u00e1pur, and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. In addition to the weaving mill at Shol\u00e1pur, there are at B\u00e1rsi two steam press houses, one, formerly belonging to Messrs. W. & A. Graham and Company and now the property of Messrs. Gaddum Bythell and Company of Bombay, was started in 1876, and has two finishing presses of the latest construction; the other belonging to the East Indian Press Company was started in 1866 and has three presses of the old system worked jointly with a powerful finisher. These presses turn out bales each of 3\u00bd hundredweights of cotton. During the cotton season from March to May the steam presses give well-paid employment to a large number of Mar\u00e1tha and Musalm\u00e1n labourers who often earn 1s. to 1s. 6d. (8 - 12 as.) a day. The pressed bales go by rail from B\u00e1rsi Road station to Bombay.\n\nAlmost all over the district blankets are woven by Dhangars and Sangars. Sangar weavers are chiefly found in the B\u00e1rsi and S\u00e1ngola sub-divisions. The wool is from their sheep, which are sheared twice a year. The wool is chiefly black with some dirty white threads. It has to be several times washed before it is ready\nfor use. The blankets and seat cloths or \u00e1sans woven in the village of Gherdi in the S\u00e1ngola sub-division have a local name. Blankets fetch 1s. to 10s. (Rs. \u00bd - 5) each. In some parts burnus or coarse felt is also made. Dhangar weavers earn 3d. to 6d. (2 - 4 as.) a day.\n\nOil-pressing supports about 2000 Teli families scattered all over the district. The chief oil-seeds pressed are sesame, groundnut, safflower, castor, linseed, havi til or white sesame, karle or niger seed, and amb\u00e1di or hemp. Oil is also pressed from the cocoa-kernel. The oil press costs about \u00a33 (Rs. 30) and is of simple construction. The Telis are mostly Hindus. They generally buy the seed from cultivators and in large towns from dealers. The village produce is consumed by the villagers and the surplus is sent to market towns for sale. As extracted oil is generally impure it soon gets rancid. Linseed, sesame, and groundnut oil are used for burning and cooking; cocoanut and castor oil only for burning. Of late years kerosine oil from Bombay has been much used and has caused much loss to the local oil-pressers. The oilman generally has his shop in the house where the oil is pressed. His wife goes from house to house selling oil, and is also taken by the oilman to large villages and towns on market days. In spite of the competition of kerosine the craft is fairly thriving and still yields a good profit. The average daily output of a single press is about fifty pounds. The average price is 2\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (1\u00bd - 3 as.) a pound.\n\nIn almost all market towns working in gold and silver is carried on by Deccan Son\u00e1rs, who make ordinary native ornaments. The goldsmiths of Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, and Pandharpur have a good local name for their skill. Son\u00e1rs seldom keep any store of gold or silver or of gold and silver ornaments. When he wants ornaments, the customer supplies the goldsmith with raw gold and silver. As in other districts the Shol\u00e1pur goldsmith is not trusted. While at work he is closely watched by the customer or some member of his family. Son\u00e1rs usually work to order eight to twelve hours a day. Their children help them in the work. They are generally well off, though not rich, and earn \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10 - 15) a month. Their busiest time is during the marriage months. The Shol\u00e1pur Son\u00e1rs suffered much during the 1876-77 famine. They have no trade organization.\n\nAt Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, Vair\u00e1g, Karm\u00e1la, Pandharpur, and some other places copper and brass vessels are made by T\u00e1b\u00e1ts and K\u00e1s\u00e1rs. Copper and brass sheets are brought from Bombay at 10\u00bdd. to 1s. the pound (Re. \u00bd - 1 the sher of 80 tol\u00e1s); cooking and drinking pots, mugs, lampstands, and other articles made of these sheets are sold at 1s. to 1s. 3d. the pound (Rs. 1 - 1\u00bc the sher of 80 tol\u00e1s). Coppersmiths work eight to ten hours a day. Their women help in blowing the bellows. During the fair season some coppersmiths sell their wares from village to village; others sell them throughout the year in shops. They are generally well off, and earn 9d. to 1s. 6d. (6 - 12 as.) a day. They have no trade organization.\nIn all towns and in almost all large villages iron work is done by Ghis\u00e1dis and Loh\u00e1rs. Besides the Ghis\u00e1dis and Loh\u00e1rs some T\u00e1mbats at Shol\u00e1pur also work in iron. Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1ni and Bohora traders of trade centres bring large quantities of iron from Bombay by rail and sell it to petty dealers and blacksmiths. The chief articles made are nails, hinges, buckets, water cisterns, spoons, pans, horse-shoes, hoes, sickles, hatchets, spades, and tires for cart wheels. The village blacksmith mostly makes and repairs field tools and carts, and is paid in grain. Blacksmiths work eight to ten hours and earn 6d. to 1s. (4-8 as.) a day. The opening of the railways and the steam factories has given them a larger field for work and on the whole they are well-to-do.\n\nStone is cut by P\u00e1tharvats and Mar\u00e1tha Gavandis or masons. The P\u00e1tharvats of Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, and Pandharpur have a good local name as skilled workers. Stone workers move from place to place where work is found. They receive no help from their women and children. They work eight to ten hours a day, P\u00e1tharvats earning 1s. to 1s. 9d. (8-14 as.) a day and Gavandis 9d. to 2s. (Re. \u00bd -1). Though stone-cutters earn good wages, their work is not constant, and as a class they are rather badly off.\n\nIn almost all villages earthen vessels, bricks, and tiles are made by Kumbh\u00e1rs and Kunbis. The clay is got free from fields and village sites. Earthen waterpots and jars are made in all villages, and other more showy pots and bricks and tiles are made in towns and large villages. On market days the potters take their wares for sale in carts or on ass-back. The potter\u2019s work is slack during the rains. About half the work is done by women. They do not earn more than enough to maintain them. Village potters are mostly paid in grain.\n\nIn towns and large villages lime is made by Lon\u00e1rs. The lime-kiln is round and is about eight feet in diameter and three feet high with a side hole at the bottom. At the bottom of the kiln is placed a layer of charcoal, then a layer of lime nodules mixed with charcoal and again a layer of charcoal. After allowing them to burn three or four days the contents of the kiln are taken out through the hole at the bottom. The lime is then separated from the charcoal and is ready for sale. Lon\u00e1rs earn 6d. to 9d. (4-6 as.) a day.\n\nIn most large villages wood-work is done by S\u00fat\u00e1rs and sometimes by others who learn the craft. Most of the timber worked is of local growth; teak and sandalwood are sometimes brought from Bombay and Poona and used in the better class of buildings. The carpenters of Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, and Pandharpur have a good local name. The Karm\u00e1la carpenters make excellent carts, which fetch \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 25-30) each and are used generally throughout the district. Two or three families at Shol\u00e1pur are well known for their skill in making boxes, tables, cots, and tools. Carpenters\u2019 work is brisk during the fair season and slack in the rains. Their women do not help them in their work. For about ten months during the year carpenters earn 1s. (8 as.) a day. As a class they are well-to-do.\nIn almost all large villages hides are tanned generally by Dhors, Mh\u00e1rs, and M\u00e1ngs, and shoes are made by Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs. Hides are taken off dead animals free of charge. The process of tanning is simple. Cattle and buffalo hides are steeped in water for two or three days, washed, and the hair scraped off with knives. Lime is applied to the hide, and after washing, it is left to steep twenty days in the extract of the taruud Cassia auriculata bark. It is again washed and laid in clean water for a fortnight and then dried in the shade. Goat and sheep skins are soaked for a day in a solution of salt and the leaves of the utrand Cynanchum extensum. The hair is then scraped off and the skin carefully cleaned. It is covered for one day with Indian millet dough and then dyed by being steeped in a solution of the gum of the pipal Ficus religiosa together with a small quantity of carbonate of soda and the bark of the lodh Symplocos racemosa. Tanners work eight to ten hours a day. The women help the men in their work. Besides shoes Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs make sandals, buckets, and water bags. The shoemakers of Shol\u00e1pur and Karm\u00e1la have a good local name for their skill. Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs work eight to ten hours a day. The making of silk borders on the shoes is generally done by women. Shol\u00e1pur shoes are not sent outside the district. English boots from Bombay and native shoes from Poona and Bij\u00e1pur are imported for local use.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nLittle is known of the early history of Sholapur. Though no early reference to it has been traced its great and widespread holiness among middle and lower class Deccan Hindus seems to show that Pandharpur is an ancient place of pilgrimage. The statue of Vithoba Dr. Bhagv\u00e1nl\u00e1l believes to belong to about the fifth century after Christ, but the only known inscriptions in the temple are of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Like the rest of the Deccan, in the early centuries of the Christian era (B.C. 90-A.D. 300?), Sholapur probably formed part of the territories of the Sh\u00e1takarni or Andhrabhritya dynasty whose capital was Paithan on the God\u00e1vari on the Ahmadnagar-Niz\u00e1m frontier about 150 miles north-west of Sholapur. Probably also, though this is not proved by local inscriptions, during the 900 years ending with the Musalm\u00e1n overthrow of the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs in the beginning of the fourteenth century, Sholapur, like the neighbouring districts of Bij\u00e1pur Ahmadnagar and Poona, was held by the Early and Western Chalukyas from 550 to 760, by the R\u00e1shtr\u00e1kutas to 973, by the revived or Western Ch\u00e1lukyas to 1184, and by the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs till the Musalm\u00e1n conquest of the Deccan about 1300.\n\nOf Devgiri Y\u00e1dav rule traces remain in Sholapur in about ten Hem\u00e1dpanti temples and a well and nine inscriptions, four of which appear from their dates (1192, 1300, 1300, 1304) to belong to the third Devgiri Y\u00e1dav king Bhillam (1188-1192) and the ninth king R\u00e1mchandra (1271-1308).\n\nThe first Musalm\u00e1n invasion of the Deccan took place in 1294, but the power of the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs was not crushed till 1318.\n\n1 Details of the Chalukya and Ch\u00e1lukya, R\u00e1shtr\u00e1kuta, and Devgiri Y\u00e1dav dynasties are given in Fleet's History of the Dynasties of the K\u00e1narese Districts of the Bombay Presidency, pp. 17-78 and in Bhand\u00e1rkar's Early Deccan History, pp. 36-69, 74-92. Compare Poona Statistical Account, p. 214 and Bij\u00e1pur Statistical Account, pp. 379-389.\n\n2 The Hem\u00e1dpanti remains are at Chapalgao and Jehur in Akalkot, Bavi and Mohol in M\u00e1dha, M\u00e1lsiras, N\u00e1tepute, and Vel\u00e1pur in M\u00e1lsiras, Pandharpur and Pulunj in Pandharpur, and Kandalgao K\u00e1segaon and Marde in Sholapur. The inscriptions are at Karabgaon in Akalkot, Mohol and V\u00e1pha in M\u00e1dha, Vel\u00e1pur in M\u00e1lsiras, and Pandharpur and Pulunj in Pandharpur.

In 1294 R\u00e1mdev the ruling king of Devgad was surprised in his capital by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji, the nephew of the Delhi emperor Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn Khilji, and forced to pay tribute. In 1297, R\u00e1mdev gave shelter to R\u00e9i Karan the fugitive king of Gujar\u00e1t, and neglected to pay tribute for three years (Ditto, I. 365). In 1306 Malik K\u00e1f\u00fcr, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn's general, reduced the greater part of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra, distributed it among his officers, and confirmed R\u00e1mdev in his allegiance (Ditto, I. 369). In 1309 Malik K\u00e1f\u00fcr, on his way to Telingan, was received with great hospitality at Devgad by R\u00e1mdev (Ditto, I. 371). In 1310, as R\u00e1mdev was succeeded by his son Shankardev who was ill-affected to the\nFrom 1318, Mahar\u00e1shtra began to be ruled by governors appointed from Delhi and stationed at Devgiri. In 1338, Muhammad Tughlik the emperor of Delhi (1325-1351) made Devgiri his capital and changed its name to Daulatabad or the Abode of Wealth. In 1341 Musalm\u00e1n exactions caused a general revolt in the Deccan, which, according to Ferishta, was so successful that in 1344 Muhammad had no part of his Deccan territories left him except Daulatabad. This statement seems exaggerated as in 1346 Musalm\u00e1ns were governing at Kulbarga, R\u00e1ichur, Bij\u00e1pur, Bedar, Ganjauti, Raib\u00e1g, Gilhari, Hukeri, and Ber\u00e1r. In the same year there was widespread disorder and the Delhi officers plundered and wasted the country.\n\nThese cruelties led to the revolt of the Deccan nobles under the able leadership of an Afgh\u00e1n soldier named Hasan Gangu. The nobles were successful, and freed the Deccan from dependence on Northern India. Hasan founded a dynasty, which, in honour of his patron a Br\u00e1hman, he called Bahmani, and which held command of the Deccan for nearly 150 years. The Bahmani capital was at Kulbarga about sixty miles east of Shol\u00e1pur, till, in 1426, it was moved to Bedar or Ahmadabad-Bedar about 100 miles further east. By 1351 Al\u00e1-ud-din Hasan Gangu Bahmani, by treating the local authorities in a liberal and friendly spirit, had brought under his power every part of the Deccan which had before been subject\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns, Malik K\u00e1fur, on his way to the Karn\u00e1tak, left a force at the town of Paithan on the left bank of the God\u00e1vri to overawe the Y\u00e1d\u00e1ys. (Ditto, I, 373). In 1312 Malik K\u00e1fur marched a fourth time into the Deccan seized and put Shankardev to death, wasted Mahar\u00e1shtra, and fixed his residence at Devgad (Ditto, I, 379), where he remained till Al\u00e1-ud-din in his last illness ordered him to Delhi. During Malik K\u00e1fur\u2019s absence at Delhi, Harp\u00e1ld\u00e9v the son-in-law of R\u00e1mdev stirred the Deccan to arms, drove out many Musalm\u00e1n garrisons, and, with the aid of the other Deccan chiefs, recovered Mahar\u00e1shtra. In 1318 Mub\u00e1r\u00edk Khilji, Al\u00e1-ud-din\u2019s son and successor, marched to the Deccan to chastise Harp\u00e1ld\u00e9v who fled at the approach of the Musalm\u00e1ns, and was pursued, seized, and flayed alive. Mub\u00e1r\u00edk appointed Malik Beg Laki, one of his father\u2019s slaves, to command in the Deccan, and returned to Delhi (Ditto, I, 333).\n\n1 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, I, 426-427. 2 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, I, 432-433.\n3 Hasan was an Afgh\u00e1n of the lowest rank and a native of Delhi. He farmed a small plot of land belonging to a Br\u00e1hman astrologer named Gangu who was in Muhammad Tughlik\u2019s favour. Having accidentally found a treasure in his field Hasan gave it to his landlord Gangu, who was so struck with his honesty that he used his influence to advance Hasan\u2019s fortunes. Hasan rose to a great station in the Deccan, took the name of Gangu out of respect and gratitude to his patron, and for the same reason added the title of Bahmani to his name when he became the founder of a dynasty. Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, II, 284-285; Elphinstone\u2019s History of India, 666.

In 1357 Al\u00e1-ud-din divided his kingdom into four provinces or tarafs over each of which he set a provincial governor or tarafdar. Sholapur formed part of the province of Kulbarga, which, besides Sholapur, included Kulbarga, Bijapur, Raichur, Mudgal, Saggar, and Naldurg. During the latter part of the fourteenth century, under the excellent rule of Muhammad Shah Bahmani (1358-1375), the banditti which for ages had harassed the trade of the Deccan were broken and scattered and the people enjoyed good government. This period of prosperity, when probably Sholapur and several other forts to the east were built, was followed by the awful calamity of the Durga Devi famine, when twelve rainless years (1396-1407) are said to have turned the land to a desert. In the first years of the famine Mahmud Shah Bahmani (1378-1397) is said to have kept ten thousand bullocks to bring grain from Gujar\u00e1t to the Deccan, and to have founded an orphan school in each of the seven leading towns of his dominions. No efforts of any rulers could preserve order or life through so long a series of fatal years. Whole districts were left without people and the strong places fell from the Musalmans into the hands of the local chiefs. Before the country could recover, it was again wasted by two rainless years in 1421 and 1422. Multitudes of cattle died, and the people broke into revolt. In 1429, the leading Bahmani noble, whose title was Malik-ul-Tujar or Chief of the Merchants, went through the Deccan restoring order. So entirely had the country fallen waste that the old villages had disappeared and fresh ones had to be formed generally including the lands of two or three of the old villages. Land was given to all who would till it free of rent for the first year and for a horse bag of grain for the second year. This settlement was entrusted to Dadu Narsu K\u00e1le an experienced Brahman and to a Turkish eunuch of the court. In 1436, in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-din Shah Bahmani II. (1435-1457), the king's brother Prince Mohammad, in the hope of making himself independent, with the aid of the Vijaynagar king to whom he was sent to demand tribute, took Sholapur and other neighbouring places. He was soon defeated and forced to accept Raichur as an equivalent for the territory he had usurped. In 1460, a famine known as D\u00e1m\u00e1jipant's famine again wasted the Deccan. According to the local story a Brahman named D\u00e1m\u00e1jipant was employed at Mangalvedha, about twelve miles south of Pandharpur, as a revenue officer under the Bedar government. He had charge of a large store of government corn at Mangalvedha. Hundreds of Brahmans and others flocked to Mangalvedha and were fed by D\u00e1m\u00e1jipant out of the government stores. Hearing of his breach of trust the Bedar king issued orders that D\u00e1m\u00e1ji should be seized and brought before him. While D\u00e1m\u00e1ji was on his way to Bedar, the god Vithoba, whom D\u00e1m\u00e1ji worshipped, took pity on his servant and appearing as a village\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, II.291-292; Grant Duff's Marath\u00e1s, 25.  \n2 Briggs' Ferishta, II.325-6.  \n3 Briggs' Ferishta II. 349-50.

To remove this evil, M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n, the learned and able minister of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Bahmani II. (1463-1482), framed a scheme under which the territories were divided into eight instead of into four provinces. The province of Kulbarga was divided into Bij\u00e1pur and Ahasnabad, and Ahasnabad, of which Shol\u00e1pur formed a part, was entrusted to Dastur Din\u00e1r an Abyssinian eunuch,\\(^3\\) and under him Shol\u00e1pur and Par\u00e1nda, with the eleven surrounding districts, were entrusted to two brothers Zain Kh\u00e1n and Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n. In each province only one fort was left in the governor's hands; all others were entrusted to captains and garrisons appointed and paid from headquarters. The pay of the captains was greatly raised and they were forced to keep their garrisons at full strength. This scheme brought on M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n the hatred of the leading nobles, who in 1481, by false charges of treason, succeeded in procuring his death. Bahmani power never recovered the loss of M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1485, Bid and other districts near Daulatabad were added to the estates of the Bahmani minister Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, the successor of M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n, who appointed Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n governor of Par\u00e1nda and the eleven surrounding districts.\\(^4\\) The end of Bahmani overrule was at hand. In 1489 Yusuf Adil Sh\u00e1h the governor of Bij\u00e1pur assumed independence and overran all the country north of Bij\u00e1pur as far as the Bhima, including the present Shol\u00e1pur sub-divisions of M\u00e1l\u00edsiras, S\u00e1ngola, and part of Pandharpur.\\(^5\\) Under the partition treaty of 1497, between Malik Ahmad the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi king of Ahmadnagar, Yusuf Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur, and Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk of Ber\u00e1r, the whole province of Daulatabad, which must have included Par\u00e1nda and its eleven districts, became part of Malik Ahmad\u2019s dominions.\\(^6\\) Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n of Par\u00e1nda and his brother Zain Kh\u00e1n, though excluded from this partition treaty,\\(^7\\) continued to hold Par\u00e1nda and the eleven surrounding districts in subjection to Ahmadnagar.\\(^8\\) Zain Kh\u00e1n, the younger brother, who was governor of Shol\u00e1pur laid claim to half of the eleven districts and endeavoured to obtain a grant from Bedar to that effect. But Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, supported by Malik Ahmad of Ahmadnagar, succeeded in keeping the whole and opposing the claims of Zain Kh\u00e1n at the court of Bedar. In 1508, on the death of Malik Ahmad of Ahmadnagar (1490-1508), Yusuf Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur marched against Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, and compelled him to cede five and a half of the eleven districts round Shol\u00e1pur to his brother Zain Kh\u00e1n.\\(^9\\)\n\n---\n\n1 Colonel Etheridge\u2019s Famine Report (1868), 99-100.

As no aid came from Ahmadnagar, Zain Kh\u00e1n, on receiving security for the safety of his family and wealth delivered (1511) Shol\u00e1pur into Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n\u2019s hands together with the five and a half districts of which he had charge.\u00b9 Par\u00e1nda and its five and a half districts, including perhaps Karm\u00e1la M\u00e1dha and B\u00e1rsi the three northern sub-divisions of the present district of Shol\u00e1pur, remained for many years under Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n who seems to have been a half independent vassal of the king of Ahmadnagar. In 1523, after one of their numerous wars, through the intervention of Sh\u00e1h T\u00e1hir Junaidi, Ism\u00e1el of Bij\u00e1pur and Burh\u00e1n of Ahmadnagar met in the fort of Shol\u00e1pur and agreed to peace.\u00b2 On this occasion Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h asked the hand of Mariam the sister of Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h, and the marriage was held with great state. The kings interchanged valuable presents including elephants and horses, and the rejoicings lasted a whole month (Rajab ii. 930). When the festivities were over the kings took leave of each other and returned to their capitals. It is asserted that in the treaty of alliance Asad Kh\u00e1n of Belgaum promised, on the part of his master Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h, to give the fort of Shol\u00e1pur, with its five and a half districts, as a dowry with the Bij\u00e1pur princess. But as Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h afterwards denied that he had authorized this concession, Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, under the advice of Sh\u00e1h T\u00e1hir, was induced to drop the demand and return to Ahmadnagar.\n\nDuring the next forty years the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi king\u2019s claim to Shol\u00e1pur was the cause of constant wars. In 1524 the Bij\u00e1pur princess quarrelled with her husband Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h because he treated a dancing girl called Amina as his chief wife. This quarrel led to war between Ahmadnagar and Bij\u00e1pur. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h secured the aid of Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h king of Ber\u00e1r and of Amir Berid regent of Bedar, and the confederates marched with forty thousand men to besiege Shol\u00e1pur and to occupy the ceded districts. Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h, with 10,000 foreign cavalry, advanced to meet the allies, and for forty days the armies continued encamped between the forts of Shol\u00e1pur and Naldurg four miles from each other without coming to action. During this time of inaction 3000 mounted foreign Bij\u00e1pur bowmen were most successful in hovering round the allies\u2019 camp and cutting off their supplies. Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n Dakhani, governor of Par\u00e1nda, vexed with the inactivity of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, quitted the camp, attended by four thousand Dakhani cavalry, intending to surprise the Bij\u00e1pur bowmen. Next evening the foreigners, as usual, took post for the night on the banks of a rivulet, and having picketed their horses were disarming and waiting for supper. As night set in, Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n Dakhani, with a reconnoitering party, came upon them, but was discovered at a short distance from the outposts by a sentry who gave the\n\n\u00b9 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 36. \u00b2 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 51-52, 216.\nalarm. The bowmen instantly took to their horses, but before all were mounted Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n fell on them and killed about three hundred. Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n\u2019s Dakhanis, after returning from the pursuit, came to the spot on which the archers had been encamped, and dismounting, plundered and ate the archers\u2019 victuals. The Bij\u00e1pur bowmen, seeing by their own experience how easily an army may be surprised, resolved to attack the camp of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. They accordingly moved direct to his lines, and the sentinels, taking them for Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n\u2019s detachment returning to camp, allowed them to pass. When in the midst of the camp, the Bij\u00e1pur bowmen discharged their arrows and made great havoc and pursued their route direct to the tents of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. Confusion was general. Friends could not be known from foes, and the bowmen, when sated with slaughter and plunder retired with little loss. Next morning, while the Ahmadnagar troops were still suffering from the terror caused by the night attack, Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h advanced to give battle. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h and Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h drew up their line, but in so great disorder and with such haste, that they were unable to withstand the Bij\u00e1pur onset. Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h, being charged by Asad Kh\u00e1n the Bij\u00e1pur champion, fled almost without a blow and did not halt till he reached his fort of G\u00e1val in Ber\u00e1r. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h was also on the point of giving way but being timely reinforced by Amir Berid with 6000 fresh horse, continued to resist. At last Khush-Geldi \u00c1gha and Ismad \u00c1gha, Turki officers in the Bij\u00e1pur service, gained the enemy\u2019s rear with two thousand horse, while Asad Kh\u00e1n attacked the right wing. These assaults threw the Ahmadnagar troops into utter confusion, and Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, overcome by the weight of his armour, was nearly falling from his horse through faintness. At this stage of the action some Turki slaves, seeing the state of the Ahmadnagar king, led his horse off the field and his army was instantly routed. About 3000 Ahmadnagar troops were slain in the pursuit, and the royal Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi standard fell into the hands of Asad Kh\u00e1n, besides forty elephants, many cannon, and the whole tents and baggage. After this victory Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h returned in triumph to Bij\u00e1pur, where he held rejoicings for a month and conferred rewards and honours on the officers who had most distinguished themselves.\n\nIn 1528 Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h accompanied by Amir Berid, again invaded Bij\u00e1pur. Asad Kh\u00e1n a second time completely defeated the allies within forty miles of Bij\u00e1pur. Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n of Par\u00e1nda and several officers of distinction were taken prisoners; the fugitives were pursued as far as Par\u00e1nda; and much baggage and twenty elephants among them the elephant which carried Burh\u00e1n\u2019s canopied seat or amb\u00fari were taken. In 1531, Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h wrote to Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h that, as the cool season had begun, he proposed to make a tour of his dominions and intended to visit Shol\u00e1pur and Naldurg; he hoped that Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h would warn the officers of his frontier not to be alarmed or\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III, 52-54.\nmisconceive the object of his march. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h in reply told Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h that it would be more for his interest if he staid at home. Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h, who had started from Bij\u00e1pur, received this message at B\u00e1hmanhalli while at evening prayer. He was so enraged that he started with only 400 horse and forty foot and reached the river at Naldurg, a distance of about sixty miles, before evening prayer on the next day. He dismissed Burh\u00e1n\u2019s ambassadors telling them he had done all he was bound to do to avoid war, that he would now wait for his royal brother to come, as he had repeatedly come before, and amuse himself with the sight of the stormy ocean of war. On the return of his ambassadors, Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, attended by Amir Berid, marched with 25,000 horse and a considerable train of artillery to the Bij\u00e1pur frontier. Ism\u00e1el left the arrangement of the troops to Asad Kh\u00e1n. All the young men, sons of foreigners and Rajputs were formed into one body, composing a light division under Sanjar Kh\u00e1n the son of Mirza Jah\u00e1ngir Kumi, while their fathers, who were mostly old, remained in the line, agreeing that this was a day for the young soldiers to show their courage. Asad Kh\u00e1n assumed command of the right wing, leaving the left to Must\u00e1pha \u00c1gha, Shikandar \u00c1gha, and Kush Geldi \u00c1gha, all Turki leaders of note. The centre was commanded by Ism\u00e1el who joined as soon as the line was formed. On seeing that the colour of the canopy, the royal standard, and the enemy\u2019s flags were green instead of white, Ism\u00e1el asked the cause of the change, and was told that they were the signs of rule conferred on Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h by Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h of Gujar\u00e1t. While he was speaking, the light division became engaged and Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h instantly advanced with his whole line. The action became general and was so well maintained on both sides that victory was long doubtful. At length Khurshid Kh\u00e1n the commander of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi army was killed and his troops fled in disorder. Shortly after Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h was surrounded by the Bij\u00e1pur horse, and was in danger of being taken prisoner, when his body-guard by a desperate effort freed their sovereign, and, they escorting him from the field, he fled to Ahmadnagar without waiting to gather his scattered army. Much plunder fell into the victors\u2019 hands and Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h\u2019s superiority was established throughout the Deccan. The battle was called the Victory of the Foreign Boys as the brunt of the fighting had fallen on them. The corps rose in the king\u2019s esteem and many of the youths were ennobled though their fathers were alive. This was the last contest between Ism\u00e1el Adil Sh\u00e1h and Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. They met on the frontier and made peace.\n\nIn 1540, when the breach between Ism\u00e1el\u2019s son Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h and his minister, Asad Kh\u00e1n became known, Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h and Amir Berid circulated reports, that, whenever they would come, Asad Kh\u00e1n had promised to deliver them Belgaum. Accordingly in 1542 they invaded Ibr\u00e1him\u2019s territories, and wresting\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 68-70.\nthe five and a half Shol\u00e1pur districts from his officers, gave them to the servants of Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n Dakhani and marched to Belgaum. The reconciliation between Ibr\u00e1him and Asad Kh\u00e1n changed the state of affairs. Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h and Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h marched against Burh\u00e1n and Amir Berid, who retreated with haste towards Daulatabad, hotly pursued by the Bij\u00e1pur and Ber\u00e1r troops who took ample revenge for the depredations committed in Bij\u00e1pur. Soon after this Amir Berid suddenly died, and Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h was reduced to sue for terms, sending the venerable Sh\u00e1h T\u00e1hir to make overtures. In the treaty which followed Burh\u00e1n agreed to restore the five and a half districts to Ibr\u00e1him and promised never again to lay claim to them. When the treaty was signed and exchanged each of the sovereigns returned to his capital. In 1543 Ibr\u00e1him, with great pomp, married Rabia Sult\u00e1na daughter of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h of Ber\u00e1r. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, vexed at the issue of the late war, in spite of his promise, declared he could never rest till he had won back the five and a half Shol\u00e1pur districts. Shortly after, availing himself of some agreement between Ibr\u00e1him and Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h, Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m formed secret alliances with R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja of Vijaynagar and Jamshid Kutb Sh\u00e1h of Golkonda to wage war against Bij\u00e1pur on the south and east, while, with his own army and the troops of Ali Berid and Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, he invaded them from the north. With this force he laid waste many districts, and on several occasions defeated the Bij\u00e1pur troops, and the kingdom of Bij\u00e1pur, attacked at once by three powerful armies in separate quarters, seemed on the brink of destruction. Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h, at a loss how to act and without confidence in his counsellors, sent for Asad Kh\u00e1n from Belgaum and asked his advice. Asad Kh\u00e1n observed that Burh\u00e1n had urged the rest to fight; if he could be removed it would be easy to manage the others. He advised that for the sake of peace the five and a half Shol\u00e1pur districts should be given up. Ibr\u00e1him acted according to this advice and peace was concluded. Still Shol\u00e1pur was not given to Ahmadnagar.\n\nIn 1549, to save his own territories from being wasted by the Ahmadnagar king, Ibr\u00e1him invaded Ahmadnagar. He came suddenly before Par\u00e1nda, and, finding the gates open, rushed with a body of troops into the fortress which submitted and was given in charge to one of his Dakhani officers. From Par\u00e1nda Ibr\u00e1him laid waste the country round, levied contributions, and retreated on hearing of Burh\u00e1n's approach. Before Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h arrived within many miles of Par\u00e1nda, the governor, who mistook a gnat near his ear for Burh\u00e1n's distant war trumpets, fled by night without telling his followers. Next morning the garrison followed their chief's example, and on the third day Burh\u00e1n quietly entered the empty fortress.\n\nIn 1551 Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, with the help of the Vijaynagar king R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, took Shol\u00e1pur and strengthened it. Some time\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 89-93.  \n2 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 104.  \n3 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 104-105.\nafter, although peace was concluded between Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h Burh\u00e1n's son and successor and Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h, Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, the hereditary chief of Par\u00e1nda, who had fled to avoid the resentment of his sovereign, came to Bij\u00e1pur and inspired Ibr\u00e1him with hopes of retaking Shol\u00e1pur. For this purpose Ibr\u00e1him concluded a treaty with R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja and invited into his service Saif Ain-ul-Mulk commander-in-chief of the army of the late Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who had taken refuge in Ber\u00e1r from Husain's oppression. Saif Ain-ul-Mulk accepted Ibr\u00e1him's proposals, and Ibr\u00e1him conferred on him high titles with considerable estates and presents of money. By his advice Ibr\u00e1him soon after espoused the cause of prince Ali the son of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who had taken refuge at his court. It was agreed that if Ali Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h gained the Ahmadnagar throne, the forts of Kalli\u00e1ni and Shol\u00e1pur should be surrendered to Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nTo effect these objects, prince Ali, accompanied by the 2000 horse which had come with him from Ahmadnagar, marched to the frontier to draw the nobles of that kingdom to his cause. This attempt met with little success. Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h put his army in motion, and Ibr\u00e1him, after distributing large sums among his troops, marched from Bij\u00e1pur to support prince Ali. The armies met on the plains of Shol\u00e1pur and drew up to engage. Ibr\u00e1him gave the command of his right wing to Saif Ain-ul-Mulk Gil\u00e1n\u00ed and Ankush Kh\u00e1n and the command of the left to Nur Kh\u00e1n and Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk, and himself took post with the household troops in the centre. The advanced guard was commanded by Saif Ain-ul-Mulk who pushed on from the line and began the action with great dash. Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h, disapproving of his separation from the main body, ordered the advanced guard to keep closer to the line. Saif Ain-ul-Mulk answered that his Majesty was right, but that, as he had advanced so far, to return would only inspirit the enemy. Having sent this message Saif went on, seized and spiked the enemy's guns, and drove their picquets back on their main body. Here he was resolutely opposed by Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h who commanded in person, still the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi army began to give way and must have been defeated had Saif Ain-ul-Mulk been supported. Several Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi chiefs who had been engaged on the left came to the aid of their sovereign and almost surrounded Saif Ain-ul-Mulk whose division was thrown into confusion. Seeing the standards of Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h, though at a distance, as was his custom on desperate occasions, Ain-ul-Mulk dismounted, resolved to conquer or die. Some of the troops seeing him dismount, told Ibr\u00e1him that Saif Ain-ul-Mulk had gone over to the enemy and had alighted to pay his respects to Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. Ibr\u00e1him's suspicions of treachery were confirmed, and he fled from the field and did not draw rein till he reached Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nIn 1557, Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h, the successor of Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h anxious to recover the forts of Kalli\u00e1ni and Shol\u00e1pur, without waiting for the customary compliment of receiving ambassadors from the surrounding powers, despatched Kishwar Kh\u00e1n and Sh\u00e1h.\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 105-107.\nAbu Turab Shir\u00e1zi to negotiate a treaty of alliance with R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja at Vijaynagar. At the same time he sent Muhammad Husain S\u00e1dikki for the same purpose to Ahmadnagar. R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja received the ambassadors with great honour and sent back one of his confidential officers with Kishwar Kh\u00e1n to congratulate the king on his accession. Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, jealous of Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h's designs against Shol\u00e1pur, did not show the usual respect to his embassy, nor send one in return, but gave strong proofs of enmity. Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h, intent on repairing the losses sustained by his father, entered into a close alliance with R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja. As his enmity towards Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h daily increased Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h sent him a message through Sh\u00e1h Husain \u00c1nju, that it was clear that the forts of Kalli\u00e1ni and Shol\u00e1pur belonged to his family by ancient right, though owing to his father's misfortunes they had passed into the hands of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi kings, that now he hoped they both or at all events Kalli\u00e1ni would be restored. As Sh\u00e1h Husain \u00c1nju's arguments failed to induce Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h to give up either place, Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h sent another ambassador to Ahmadnagar, representing that passion and obstinacy in the discussion of political questions did not become great kings, and that to prevent ill consequences he trusted Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h would see the justice of giving up the forts when the friendship between their states would increase. If not he might look for an army which would waste his dominions without mercy. Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h answered this message by an indecent jibe, which so enraged Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h that by way of defiance, according to the Deccan custom, he changed his canopy and standard from yellow to green Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h's colour. In the war that followed the Ahmadnagar king was forced to leave his capital which was besieged by the Bij\u00e1pur and Golkonda kings and by R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja of Vijaynagar. At last, scandalized by the behaviour of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, the Golkonda king persuaded Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h to raise the siege and march against Shol\u00e1pur. When within some miles of Shol\u00e1pur Kishwar Kh\u00e1n the Bij\u00e1pur minister, seeing the dangerous power and ambition of the Hindu king, represented to Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h that, if the fort of Shol\u00e1pur fell, R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja would probably keep it and the country round it for himself. It seemed advisable to reduce the fort of Naldurg and to leave Shol\u00e1pur to a more convenient time. Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h approved of this advice and persuaded R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja to change his plans and move to Naldurg where the allies took leave of each other and returned to their dominions. Some time after, Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h thought of forming a league between the three Musalm\u00e1n kings of Bij\u00e1pur Ahmadnagar and Golkonda against the Hindu king R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja of Vijaynagar, and the Golkonda king promised Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h to obtain for him the fort of Shol\u00e1pur which had been the original cause of the disagreement between the Ahmadnagar and Bij\u00e1pur kings. It was agreed that Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h should give his daughter Ch\u00e1nd Bibi in marriage to Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h with the fortress of Shol\u00e1pur as her dowry; that he should receive Haddia\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, III, 121, 122.\n2 Briggs' Forishta, III, 123-124.\nSult\u00e1na, Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h's sister, as a consort for his eldest son Murtaza; that a treaty of eternal friendship should be passed between the two states; and that they should unite to reduce the power of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja. In 1565 R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja was slain in the battle of Tal\u00edkoti and his army scattered, Vijaynagar was taken and sacked, and the power of the great Hindu kingdom was at an end.\n\nFor some years there was peace. In 1590, Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, the Bij\u00e1pur regent attempted to raise himself to supreme power, and was driven from the country. He fled to Ahmadnagar and was favourably received by Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h II. (1590-1594), enrolled among his nobles, and appointed to reduce the forts of Shol\u00e1pur and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1durg. Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h sent ambassadors to request that Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n might be sent to him. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h instead of granting this demand prepared for war. In 1592 on Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n's advice he marched towards Bij\u00e1pur, and passing the frontier laid the country waste. On reaching Mangalvedha about twelve miles south of Pandharpur as no army was sent to meet him, Burh\u00e1n suspected some device to draw him into the heart of the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom, and retreated. At the Bhima Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n persuaded him to halt near a ruined fortress which he ordered to be repaired. Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h, who had neither given orders to assemble his nobles nor taken measures to defend his country, on hearing of the fort said that Burh\u00e1n would shortly act like the child who builds walls of clay and then destroys them with his own hands. Ibr\u00e1him continued to act as if no enemy was in his country; and, contenting himself with despatching a few horse to watch Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m's motions, appeared to give himself to amusement. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m consulted his officers. Some said Ibr\u00e1him was sunk in pleasure and neglected his kingdom, others believed that he suspected his officers and was afraid of calling them together. Ibr\u00e1him, who was well informed of what was passing, sent a message to Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n pardoning him for his past offences and asking him to return and take charge of his affairs. Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n suspecting no treachery, with Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h's permission, went back to his master, and was blinded and imprisoned until his death. When he was rid of Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, Ibr\u00e1him sent his Bargi or Mar\u00e1tha chiefs with 6000 horse to cut off all supplies from Burh\u00e1n's camp, and sent 100,000 horse under Rumi Kh\u00e1n Dakhani and 3000 more of the household troops under Elias Kh\u00e1n against Burh\u00e1n. The Bargi cavalry greatly distressed the enemy, defeating several detachments till Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m advanced in person to attack them. Unable to oppose regular troops the Bargis recrossed the Bhima which was then fordable, and a flood immediately after swelling the river prevented their being pursued,\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 125.\n2 Bargi, according to Shakespeare's Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed dictionary, is the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed form of the Mar\u00e1thi varga apparently meaning either of one class from varg a class as opposed to the mixed regiments of foreign cavalry, or troops of irregular horse. The word Bargi is distinct from B\u00e1r\u00edgir, properly B\u00e1gi, also used of Mar\u00e1tha troopers. The B\u00e1rgirs had horses supplied by a chief or by the state in distinction to the Shiled\u00e1re or self-horsed cavalry soldiers. This b\u00e1gi seems to mean a rider from b\u00e1g a rein. Colonel F. Wise.\nand Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m returned to his lines. After this Burh\u00e1n suffered so severely from famine and pestilence that he was forced to retire several marches. When he had received supplies and the pest had somewhat abated Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m moved again intending to lay siege to Shol\u00e1pur. He was met on his march by Rumi Kh\u00e1n and Elias Kh\u00e1n who defeated a large part of his army under Nur Kh\u00e1n Amir-ul-Omra of Ber\u00e1r and took a hundred elephants and 400 horses. After this loss the affairs of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h declined daily, and numbers of his troops, tired of a long and fatiguing campaign, deserted his camp and conspired against his life. On discovering the plot, Burh\u00e1n, full of suspicion, began his retreat towards Ahmadnagar. His first march was so harassed that he thought it imprudent to attempt moving further till he could make peace with Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h to whom he sent ambassadors. For nearly a month Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm refused to listen to any accommodation till Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h destroyed the fort he had built within Bij\u00e1pur territory on the bank of the Bhima. To this Burh\u00e1n reluctantly agreed. He threw down the first stone with his own hands, and his troops demolished the whole fabric which had cost much trouble and expense. Then disheartened he marched quickly back to Ahmadnagar.\n\nIn 1594 Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h entered into a treaty with Venkat\u00e1dri of Penkonda and resolved again to invade Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u2019s territories. He accordingly despatched Murtaza Kh\u00e1n \u00c1nju at the head of 10,000 horse with orders to reduce Sh\u00e1h\u00e1durg and Shol\u00e1pur. Murtaza Kh\u00e1n \u00c1nju advanced as far as Par\u00e1nda, and, halting there, sent detachments to lay waste and plunder the country round. These troops suffered a severe check, their commander Uzb\u00e9k Kh\u00e1n was killed, and his force defeated under the walls of Shol\u00e1pur.\n\nIn 1599, the city of Ahmadnagar was taken by the Moghals. After this, partly from the disorders caused by the rebellion of Jah\u00e1ngir\u2019s son Khusru, which followed Jah\u00e1ngir\u2019s accession on the death of Akbar in 1605, Moghal power in the Deccan declined. Their generals in Ahmadnagar had also to deal with the Abyssinian Malik Ambar a man of the highest civil and military talent. Though the Moghals still held Ahmadnagar fort, in 1605 Malik Ambar raised Murtaza Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h II. to the throne, and succeeded in making Khadki near Elura, afterward called Aurangabad, the headquarters of a state which included the greater part of the former Ahmadnagar possessions. Malik Ambar\u2019s power remained unshaken till his death in 1626 when he was succeeded in the regency by his son Fatteh Kh\u00e1n. Great as was his success as a general, Malik Ambar is best known by his land revenue system. He stopped revenue-farming, and, under Musalm\u00e1n supervision, entrusted the collection of the revenues to Br\u00e1hman agents. He renewed the broken village system, and, when several years of experiments had enabled him to ascertain the average yield of a field, took about two-fifths of the outturn in kind, and afterwards (1614) commuted the grain payment to a cash payment representing about one-third\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 170-175.\n2 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 185, 286.\nof the yield. Unlike Todar Mal, Akbar's famous minister by whom the lands of North India were settled, Malik Ambar did not make his settlement permanent, but allowed the demand to vary in accordance with the harvest. This system was so successful that, in spite of heavy war charges, his finances prospered, and his territories which included the northern sub-divisions of Sholapur, threw and grew rich. In 1623 Malik Ambar collected an excellent army, and, bringing grain from Daulatabad, laid siege to Sholapur and took it by storm. In 1629 the rains failed and a second failure in 1630 caused grievous suffering. Thousands left the Deccan, numbers perished in their homes, and whole districts were emptied of their people. The famine was accompanied by an almost complete loss of cattle and was followed by a pestilence.\n\nIn 1635, the Moghal general Sh\u00e1iste Kh\u00e1n marched towards the Bij\u00e1pur borders, reduced Naldurg, and occupied the districts between Sholapur and Bedar. In 1636, under a treaty between the Bij\u00e1pur king and the Moghals, the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi dynasty came to an end, and it was settled that the forts of Par\u00e1nda and Sholapur with their dependent districts should be given to the Bij\u00e1pur king M\u00e1hmad Adil Sh\u00e1h. For the next thirty years (1636-1665) no reference to Sholapur has been traced. In 1665, the Moghals entered into a treaty with Shiv\u00e1ji to undermine the power of Bij\u00e1pur under which Shiv\u00e1ji, with 2000 horse and 8000 foot, co-operated with Jaysing the Moghal commander. Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h, the Bij\u00e1pur king, endeavoured to prevent the invasion by promising to settle the Moghal demands. Jaysing the Moghal commander, continued his advance from Phaltan which he had reduced. He met with little opposition till, near Mangalvedha, the Bij\u00e1pur horse appeared and acted against him with great vigour. Abdul Muhammad, the prime minister, was the commander of the Bij\u00e1pur forces. The chief officers were Abdul Karim Bahlole Kh\u00e1n, Khaw\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n, Sidi Aziz, and Venk\u00e1ji R\u00e1ja Bhonsla Shiv\u00e1ji's half-brother. The Mar\u00e1tha horse in the service of Bij\u00e1pur fought with uncommon spirit, Venk\u00e1ji R\u00e1ja and Ratt\u00e1ji M\u00e1ne Deshmukh of Mhasvad in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra being most conspicuous. On the side of the Moghals Shiv\u00e1ji and Net\u00e1ji P\u00e1lkar distinguished themselves, particularly on one occasion when they had command of the rear guard. They were also detached against several places of strength which were reduced by Shiv\u00e1ji's infantry.\n\nAbout the middle of 1668, a treaty was concluded at \u00c1gra between Aurangzeb and Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur. The terms on the part of the Bij\u00e1pur government were negotiated by Sh\u00e1h Abdul Husain K\u00e1m\u00e1n, who, as the price of peace, gave up the fort of Sholapur and territory yielding \u00a363,000 (180,000 pagod\u00e1s) of yearly revenue. In 1679, Bij\u00e1pur was besieged by the Moghals, and Shiv\u00e1ji who was\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 43.

Finding he could not force the Moghals to raise the siege he made a show of attacking, and, advancing slowly until within twenty-four miles of the camp, turned to the north, rapidly crossed the Bhima, and attacked the Moghal possessions with fire and sword, leaving the inhabitants houseless and the villages in ashes. As the besiegers did not raise the siege of Bij\u00e1pur, Shiv\u00e1ji continued his depredations from the Bhima to the God\u00e1vari. In 1684 Aurangzeb issued orders to levy a tax of \u00a31.6s. (Rs.13) on every \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000) owned by all except Muhammadans. In 1686 when the final siege of Bij\u00e1pur began Aurangzeb's camp was at first at Shol\u00e1pur. Later on he moved to Bij\u00e1pur to help in the siege.\n\nAfter reducing Bij\u00e1pur in October 1686 Aurangzeb marched to Golkonda which fell into his hands in September 1687. From Golkonda he returned to Bij\u00e1pur where he remained till in 1689 he was driven north by a deadly plague. He halted at Akluj on the south bank of the Nira about eight miles north-east of M\u00e1l\u00edsiras. After his arrival at Akluj he was harassed by plundering parties of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and detachments were sent to Sambh\u00e1ji's territories. One of these under Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n was sent to Kolh\u00e1pur. Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n succeeded in capturing Sambh\u00e1ji and twenty-six others at Sangameshvar in Ratn\u00e1giri and marched with the prisoners to the Moghal camp. The news of Sambh\u00e1ji's capture was received at Akluj with great rejoicing. During the four or five days when Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n was known to be approaching with the prisoners, all classes were so overjoyed that they could not sleep and went out four miles to meet the prisoners and give expression to their joy. In every town or village on or near the road, wherever the news reached, there was great delight; and wherever the prisoners passed the doors and roofs were full of men and women who looked on rejoicing. It was proposed to spare Sambh\u00e1ji's life but his insolence and foolhardiness towards Aurangzeb resulted in September 1689 in his execution at Tol\u00e1pur in Poon\u00e1. Under R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m, Sambh\u00e1ji's brother and successor, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s began to plunder the Moghal dominions in the North Deccan and successfully resisted the Moghal detachments sent to oppose them. These raids greatly annoyed Aurangzeb, who, in 1694, in the hope of drawing the enemy southwards, moved from a place on the Bhima to Galgale in south-west Bij\u00e1pur. This feint proved unsuccessful. The raids continued in the north and R\u00e1mchandrapant one of the Mar\u00e1tha leaders levied contributions as far east as Shol\u00e1pur. Aurangzeb was forced to bring back his unwieldy army to Brahmapuri on the Bhima below Pandharpur, where he established his chief store and built a cantonment in which he held his court. From Brahmapuri the operations of his armies and the affairs of his empire were directed for several years. In 1699, when R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m was on tour collecting chauth and\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 128-129.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 145.\n3 Muntakhb-ul-lubab in Elliot and Dowson, VII. 322.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 158.\n5 Elliot and Dowson, VII. 340; Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 159-160.\n6 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 167.\nsardeshmukhi, Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, whose success in the Karn\u00e1tak made him the only Moghal officer whom the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s dreaded, was ordered to repair to the cantonment at Brahmapuri. It was then determined to adopt a new plan of operations by which while one army attacked the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the field another was set apart for the reduction of their forts. The fort army Aurangzeb reserved for himself, and gave the command of the field army to prince A\u2019zam\u2019s son Bedar Bakht with Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n as his lieutenant. Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n\u2019s first effort was to attack R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m when he was plundering J\u00e1lna in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territories. The attack was so vigorous that R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m had to fly pursued by the Moghal army. R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m evaded pursuit; but the fatigue of the march brought on an illness which proved fatal (1700). While Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n was in pursuit of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m the cantonment at Brahmapuri was abandoned much to the regret of idle Moghal officers many of whom had built excellent houses. A store was formed under the protection of the fort of Mashnur, about twenty-five miles south-west of Shol\u00e1pur, which was within the line of the cantonment and a strong guard was left for its protection. The emperor marched to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra which after some resistance surrendered in June 1700.\n\nOn the death of Aurangzeb, on the 21st of February 1707, Shol\u00e1pur probably passed to K\u00e1m Bakhsh, Aurangzeb\u2019s son who had been appointed governor of Bij\u00e1pur and continued under him till in 1708 he was killed in an engagement with his brother Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h (1707-1712). In the contest for the imperial throne among Aurangzeb\u2019s sons prince A\u2019zam, on promise of steadfast allegiance, released Sh\u00e1hu, Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s son, who had been a prisoner in the Moghal camp since Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s execution. Sh\u00e1hu was also promised the tract conquered by Shiv\u00e1ji from Bij\u00e1pur with additional territory between the Bh\u00edma and the God\u00e1vari. This tract included Shol\u00e1pur; but A\u2019zam\u2019s defeat and death at Agra by Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h prevented Sh\u00e1hu, when master of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, from taking possession of the country promised by A\u2019zam. Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s claims to the Mar\u00e1tha chiefship were resisted by T\u00e1ra B\u00e1\u00ed the widow of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m, on behalf of her son, and her cause had the sympathy of the common people. While Sh\u00e1hu was marching towards S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from the banks of the God\u00e1vari, the people of a village fired on his troops. The village was immediately assaulted. During the attack, a woman carrying a boy in her arms rushed towards Sh\u00e1hu and threw the child before him calling out that she devoted him to the R\u00e1ja\u2019s service. Sh\u00e1hu took charge of the boy, always treated him like a son, and in memory of his first success called him Fattehsing to which he added his own surname of Bhonsla. This Fattehsing Bhonsla became the founder of the family of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Akalkot now under Shol\u00e1pur. In 1709 D\u00e1ud Kh\u00e1n, the Moghal governor of the Deccan, settled with such Mar\u00e1tha chiefs as acknowledged Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s authority, to allow them one-fourth of the revenue of the six Deccan provinces, but reserved the right of collecting and paying it through his own agents. This arrangement continued till 1713 when D\u00e1ud\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 173-174.  \n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 185  \n3 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 188.\nKh\u00e1n was removed to Gujar\u00e1t, and Chin Kilich Kh\u00e1n, the future founder of the Haidarabad Niz\u00e1m\u2019s family, was appointed in his place with the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk was partial to the Kolhapur branch of Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s family and was hostile to Sh\u00e1hu. He set aside D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n\u2019s settlement and took one Rambh\u00e1ji Nimb\u00e1lkar who had deserted Sh\u00e1hu into his service with the title of R\u00e1v Rambha. Rambh\u00e1ji distinguished himself in the Moghal service, particularly in Poona, and was rewarded with an estate near Poona. In 1715 the Niz\u00e1m received into his service another Mar\u00e1tha noble, the son of Haibatrav Nimbalkar and rewarded him with B\u00e1rsi and other districts. In 1716 Syed Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n was appointed Moghal Viceroy of the Deccan. In his scheme for the destruction of the Emperor Ferokshir (1712-1719) Syed Husain courted Sh\u00e1hu, who, as the price of his alliance, demanded among Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s old possessions the tract of country east of Pandharpur. In 1719, in reward for the help given to Syed Husain Kh\u00e1n and his brother in deposing the Emperor Ferokshir, Sh\u00e1hu received, besides two grants for levying chauth or one-fourth and sardeshmukhi or ten per cent of the revenues of the six Deccan provinces, the country east of Pandharpur as part of his home rule or sv\u00e1r\u00e1j. The country watered by the Nira and the M\u00e1n which includes east and part of south Shol\u00e1pur, and which was noted for good horses, hardy soldiers, and some ancient and independent Mar\u00e1tha families was also placed under the authority of Sh\u00e1hu. In 1720 Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk relieved the Emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h (1720-1748) from the tyranny of the Syeds, and in 1723 he threw off his allegiance to the emperor and became the master of the Moghal dominions south of the Narbada. The fort and town of Shol\u00e1pur, Karm\u00e1la, and other portions of north and west Shol\u00e1pur, which did not form part of the Mar\u00e1tha home rule or sv\u00e1r\u00e1j, then passed to the Niz\u00e1m. In 1727 Rambh\u00e1ji Nimbalkar received Karm\u00e1la in exchange for his estate in Poona. The Niz\u00e1m divided the revenue with Sh\u00e1hu in the parts of the Deccan and the Karn\u00e1tak which were not either wholly ceded in j\u00e1gur or included in the Mar\u00e1tha sv\u00e1r\u00e1j or home rule. This division of revenue caused frequent wars between the Niz\u00e1m and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\nIn 1749 Sh\u00e1hu died. As part of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Peshwa\u2019s (1740-1761) scheme for usurping the sole authority Fattehsing Bhonsla, Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s adopted son, was confirmed in possession of his estate, in various minor claims or shares of revenue, and in the title of R\u00e1ja of Akalkot, which, except the detached claims, his descendents still enjoy. In 1750 B\u00e1l\u00e1ji\u2019s usurpation was resisted by one Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev who threw himself into the fort of S\u00e1ngola, about twenty miles south-west of Pandharpur, and raised the standard of rebellion. Sad\u00e1shiv Bh\u00e1u, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji\u2019s cousin, marched to S\u00e1ngola to put down the rebellion. Sad\u00e1shiv was accompanied by R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chief so that Yam\u00e1ji might have no excuse for resistance. Yam\u00e1ji\u2019s rising was soon suppressed. During his stay at S\u00e1ngola R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja agreed to give up the entire power and to lend his sanction to what\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 191.\n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 195.\n3 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 200.\n4 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 220.\never measures the Peshwa might pursue, provided a small tract round S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was assigned for his own management. To these conditions B\u00e1l\u00e1ji agreed, but they were never carried out and R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja was taken under a strong escort from S\u00e1ngola to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1752, in the conflict for power between the great Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk\u2019s sons Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din assisted by the Peshwa B\u00e1l\u00e1ji and Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t Jang assisted by the French under M. Bussy, Karn\u00e1la the residence of J\u00e1noji Nimb\u00e1lkar was visited by Syed Lashkar Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t Jang\u2019s minister. As part of their avowed scheme of enlisting the sympathy of the chiefs in favour of Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t Jang, Syed Lashkar and J\u00e1noji Nimb\u00e1lkar had an interview with B\u00e1l\u00e1ji, who, by the advice of Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din, detained both of them and took them to Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din\u2019s camp. They remained with Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din until his death by poison soon afterwards. In 1756, in pursuance of the secret agreement between B\u00e1l\u00e1ji and the Haidarabad minister Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n of driving the French out of the Deccan, M. Bussy was dismissed from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s service immediately after the fall of S\u00e1vanur in the siege of which he had been engaged with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. After his dismissal Bussy marched towards Haidarabad pursued by a detachment of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s army under J\u00e1noji Nimb\u00e1lkar of Karn\u00e1la. A detachment of 600 Arabs and Abyssinians enlisted at Surat was marching to Bussy\u2019s aid; but the party was intercepted by J\u00e1noji Nimb\u00e1lkar who killed fifty of them and the rest surrendered. Soon after the Niz\u00e1m was reconciled to Bussy who gained more power than ever at Haidarabad.\n\nIn 1774, owing to the murder of his nephew N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v (1773), Peshwa Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v became the head of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v\u2019s claims to the headship were opposed by the Poona ministers, one of whom Trimbakr\u00e1v M\u00e1ma, jealous of Raghn\u00e1th\u2019s name as a soldier and ambitious of the honour of defeating him, marched south from Poona to stop Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v who was returning from the Karn\u00e1tak. On the 4th of March 1774, Trimbakr\u00e1v M\u00e1ma crossed the Bhima at Pandharpur and prepared to attack Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v who was close at hand. On a fine plain between Pandharpur and K\u00e1segaon four miles south of Pandharpur Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v made a dashing charge on Trimbakr\u00e1v, and, in less than twenty minutes, with a force considerably inferior to that of his opponent, gained a complete victory, mortally wounded Trimbakr\u00e1v, and took him prisoner. Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v was one of the foremost in the charge supported only by his own division of about 10,000 horse. Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1stia second-in-command of Trimbakr\u00e1v\u2019s army was wounded but escaped. This victory gave momentary life to Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v\u2019s cause. He was enabled to raise large sums in Pandharpur partly by contributions and partly by pawning a portion of some prize jewels he had brought from North India. Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v\u2019s cause was ruined by the birth of a posthumous son to the murdered Peshwa Nar\u00e1y\u00e1nr\u00e1v.\n\nIn 1784 Sarbuland Jang an officer of the Niz\u00e1m was appointed to\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 271.  \n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 293-294.  \n3 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 367.\nchastise the unruly proprietors of Shol\u00e1pur;\u00b9 and in 1786, probably in reward for this service, the same officer, with the title of warden of Shol\u00e1pur, received the command of 5000 and a curtained palanquin and jewels.\u00b2\n\nIn 1792 the country south of Pandharpur was open, woody, and well watered. The soil though rich bore no grain crops. Pandharpur, which was in the territory belonging to Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1\u00fa Patvardhan, contained many buildings, and had a market supplied not only with grain cloth and other local products, but with a variety of English articles, which filled a whole street of shops of Bombay and Poona traders. The road seventeen miles north-west to M\u00e1lkh\u00e1mb\u00ed led through fair soil. Akluj on the south bank of the Nira was a large respectable town with a well supplied market and with several handsome buildings.\u00b3\n\nIn 1795 at Kharda fifty-five miles south-east of Ahmadnagar the Niz\u00e1m suffered so heavy a defeat that he was forced to cede to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s a large tract of country including his possessions in Shol\u00e1pur. In 1803 (April), in accordance with the treaty of Bassein (31st December 1802) General Wellesley passed through Pandharpur and Akluj to Poona to reinstate B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Peshwa who had been driven from Poona by Yashvantr\u00e1v Holkar in October 1802. At Akluj, General Wellesley was joined by Colonel Stevenson the detachment under whose command was reinforced by the Scotch brigade.\u2074 In February 1804, on his return from Poona, General Wellesley dispersed a band of freebooters who had gathered in numbers about Akkolt.\u2075\n\nIn 1815, to settle some money disputes of long standing between the Peshwa and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r of Baroda, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r sent a Br\u00e1hman named Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri as his agent. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s love of intrigue and the influence which Trimbakji Denglia had over him made the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r so afraid of treachery, that, before sending Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri to Poona, he obtained from the British Government a formal guarantee of Gang\u00e1dhar\u2019s safety. Finding his efforts at Poona fruitless, Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri determined to return to Baroda and leave the settlement to British arbitration. This disconcerted B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s plans, whose real object was to arrange an union with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r against the English, and he and Trimbakji Denglia after much persuasion induced Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri to stay. In July (1815) B\u00e1jir\u00e1v went to Pandharpur on a pilgrimage and took with him Trimbakji and Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri. On the 14th of July Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri dined with the Peshwa, and, in the evening, Trimbakji asked him to Vithoba\u2019s temple where the Peshwa was. Gang\u00e1dhar who was unwell excused himself, but was pressed by Trimbakji and went to the temple with a few unarmed attendants. After a prayer to Vithoba he talked with Trimbakji and then went to pay his respects to the Peshwa who was seated in the upper veranda of the\n\n\u00b9 Eastwick\u2019s Kaisar-N\u00e1ma-i-Hind, 90.\n\u00b2 Eastwick\u2019s Kaisar-N\u00e1ma-i-Hind, 97.\n\u00b3 Little\u2019s Detachment, 339-342.\n\u2074 Wellington\u2019s Despatches, III, 70-72.\n\u2075 Wellington\u2019s Despatches, III, 463, 465.\ntemple and treated him with marked attention. When the visit was over Gang\u00e1dhar started for his lodging in high spirits. He had scarcely gone three hundred yards when he was attacked in the street by assassins hired by Trimbakji and was almost cut to pieces. The murder of a Br\u00e1hman in the holy city of Pandharpur and Trimbakji Denglia\u2019s share in the deed caused much excitement. The death of a man for whose security the British Government had pledged themselves, the proved guilt of Trimbakji, and the wavering and intriguing conduct of the Peshwa led to the outbreak of the war between the English and the Peshwa, the fate of which was decided by the British victory at the battle of Kirkee (5th November 1817).\n\nAfter his defeat at Kirkee, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, accompanied by his chief commander B\u00e1pu Gokhale, fled from Poona through S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Pandharpur. He was pursued by General Smith who was accompanied by Mr. Elphinstone. The Peshwa fled from Pandharpur fifteen miles north to Karkam, but 5000 of Gokhale\u2019s horse threatened the rear and left of the British troops. On the march towards Pandharpur, the British troops went almost in square, the flanks well protected with cavalry and infantry and the auxiliaries in front and rear of the baggage. Except near Pandharpur, there were no signs of tillage. About Pandharpur the Peshwa\u2019s troops, 6000 or 7000 strong, came in sight on the rear and to the right of the rear. They were in three or four solid bodies which kept at a great distance, probably three miles, while many single horsemen advanced to within 250 or 300 yards of the British. These thickened about the rear, firing their matchlocks and occasionally rocketing, in spite of the riflemen who were unsuccessful. At length a ball wounded General Smith\u2019s orderly\u2019s horse, a rocket fell in the midst of the cavalry and wounded a man and a horse, and Captain Tovey descried three rocket camels within reach. It was resolved to charge them and General Smith dashed off with the three troops of cavalry and a galloper or light horse artillery gun. Mr. Elphinstone joined the cavalry after they had come up with the camels. The cavalry was halted and immediately divided into two parties. The division on the left charged and that on the right with the gun came on at leisure as a reserve. Though the left division charged with great spirit, a body of the enemy formed up to it and showed a determined front. As they advanced to meet the left division the right division came on the right flank. At this moment General Smith injudiciously halted. The left division also halted and began to fire their pistols. This discouraged the men of the right division, for there was ground for alarm as the body in front of them stood firm and their balls whizzed round in great numbers and to the right the plain was covered with horsemen, numerous though not compact. Then the left division retired on the right by order, and came in haste and confusion, followed by the enemy, shouting, with their lances at rest. The right squadron was astonished, but not unsteady; and the men moved on and checked the enemy with their pistols. The left division also formed rapidly and pistoled. This checked the enemy, who stopped\nat a short distance and fired, while Captain Bruce was sent to bring up the infantry. At this moment an injudicious word of command to retreat, unauthorized by General Smith, nearly lost all. As it was, the cavalry was brought back instead of the infantry being brought forward which was dangerous; but the fire of the infantry, though not more than twenty men and these unsteady, checked the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The British force remained unable to retreat waiting anxiously for the recovery of an overturned gun, when Captain Tovey appeared with a gun of the horse artillery, followed by two companies of the rear guard. The gun opened on the enemy close at hand, yet they did not show much panic. The infantry afterwards came up but did not fire. The British cavalry who were drawing off halted to pick up a dead trooper and again drew off without being insulted or molested.\n\nThe Peshwa continued his march northwards to Junnar in Poona, keeping the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and his mother and brothers in his camp. From Junnar he was again driven south to the Karn\u00e1tak. On arriving on the banks of the Ghatprabha he found the country to the south already in the hands of Colonel Munro\u2019s troops. The rapid progress of Colonel Munro in the south and the advance of General Pritzler from the north-west compelled B\u00e1jir\u00e1v to march north-east to Shol\u00e1pur. After the reduction of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra on the 10th of February General Smith, at the head of two regiments of cavalry, a squadron of the 22nd Dragoons, 1200 auxiliary horse and 2500 infantry marched in pursuit of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v who was near Shol\u00e1pur levying heavy contributions. General Smith followed by moderate marches in order to gain on him with fresh troops. On the 19th of February he arrived at Vel\u00e1pur about twelve miles south-east of M\u00e1l\u00edsiras and heard that the Peshwa was on the route from Shol\u00e1pur towards Pandharpur. General Smith made a corresponding movement the same night, but on his way hearing that the enemy had suddenly turned on Karkam about fifteen miles north of Pandharpur, he changed his course, crossed the Bhima at Karauli, and heard that the Peshwa was camped at Ashta. Taking the cavalry and horse artillery, and desiring the rest to follow in all haste, he continued the march without break by Mendh\u00e1pur and came in sight of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at eight on the morning of the 20th as they were moving off the ground. The enemy were not ignorant of the approach of the cavalry, and, though unable to avoid a conflict, they were not without time to prepare for it. The Peshwa, who did not consider himself safe in a palanquin, mounted a horse, and fled in haste with a sufficient guard, leaving B\u00e1pu Gokhale with eight to ten thousand horse to cover his retreat, and, if possible, to save the baggage. Before leaving Ashta B\u00e1jir\u00e1v taunted Gokhale for allowing the army to be surprised; Gokhale replied that he might rest assured his rear would be guarded. Probably thinking the entire Fourth Division with its baggage was advancing Gokhale further assured B\u00e1jir\u00e1v that he would amuse General Smith who would, as usual, open his guns. When the British cavalry alone were discovered\n\n1 Colebrooke\u2019s Elphinstone, II. 10-12.\nmoving over the hill, Gokhale was forced to make other dispositions.\\footnote{Blacker's Mar\u00e1tha War, 249.} His friends advised him to retire for support and return better prepared to meet the British. He replied, Whatever is to be done must be done here. His force was divided into several bodies, which made a show of supporting each other. Between them and the British cavalry was a difficult streamlet which the attacking body must cross. Meanwhile General Smith's corps was advancing in regimental columns of threes at forming distance, the two squadrons of His Majesty's 22nd Dragoons in the centre, the 7th Madras Native Cavalry on the right, and the 2nd on the left. On the outer flanks, a little retired, were the Bombay Horse artillery and gallopper guns, the Horse artillery under Captain Pierce on the right, and the gallopper guns under Captain Frith on the left. Thus disposed they approached the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and were about to form when Gokhale, with a body of two thousand five hundred horse with several ensigns, advanced from opposite the left, cleared the streamlet, and, delivering a volley from matchlocks as they passed, charged obliquely across the front to the place where the 7th Cavalry were unprepared to receive them. About three troops were imperfectly formed. These with the rest of the regiment advanced through broken ground and ravines, as the enemy circled round their right flank, to which they couched their lances and gained the rear. This manoeuvre threatened the right flank and rear of the 22nd Dragoons who were then engaged to the front. But Major Dawes, with the presence of mind of an old soldier, threw back the right troops and bringing forward the left, charged in turn. Gokhale was foremost to receive the attack, and met in conflict a young officer of the Dragoons, Lieutenant Warrand, who had the honour of receiving from him a wound on the shoulder. Gokhale had many more antagonists and fell at the head of his corps with three pistol-shot wounds and two sabre-cuts covering his head with his shawl as he fell.\\footnote{Blacker's Mar\u00e1tha War, 249-250.} He fought bravely to the last, dying, as he had promised, with his sword in his hand. His person was large, his features fine and manly, and his complexion nearly fair. He wore on the morning of the action a rich dress of gold kinkh\u00e1b, with a pearl necklace, diamond earrings, and a turban ornament of immense value.\\footnote{Fifteen Years in India (1822), 522.}\n\nGeneral Smith was on the right as the enemy made their charge, and, before he could quit that position, received a sabre-cut on the back of his head. In the confused mixture of dragoons, native cavalry, and enemy's horse, the 2nd Cavalry formed on the left and threw out a squadron which checked some parties of the enemy who were still in the rear of the other regiments. The fall of their chief deprived the M\u00e1rah\u00e1s of hope, and they fled towards the left, in which direction their main body, who had never come into action, left the field pursued by the 2nd Cavalry. A squadron of this corps were met by a band of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, which proved to be the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and his brother and mother all of whom voluntarily\nsought British protection. The remaining regiments, as soon as they recovered a little order, joined in the pursuit. In the hollow beyond the village of Ashta they found a body of horse which had never been engaged and still made a show of covering the retreat of the baggage. These fled on a nearer approach; and twelve elephants fifty-seven camels and many palanquins fell into the pursuers' hands. The enemy were followed about five miles and completely scattered. The horse artillery on the right had been ordered in the first instance not to fire as it would prevent the immediate charge of the cavalry; and the difficulties of the ground opposed their subsequent passage of the streamlet in time to be brought into action. The gallopper guns on the left found greater facility of crossing and opened with some effect. The enemy lost about two hundred killed, including some chiefs besides Gokhale, while the British loss amounted to no more than fourteen Europeans and five Native cavalry killed and wounded. The cavalry returned to the field of action, and encamped near Ashta where they were rejoined by the infantry and baggage from the rear. Thus closed this brilliant affair, which, with little loss, freed the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra family, and completely ended the enterprise of the Peshwa's horse.\n\nAbout three months after the battle of Ashta, during which the Peshwa's S\u00e1t\u00e1ra strongholds were reduced, Shol\u00e1pur was again the seat of severe fighting. After reducing the greater part of the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak General Munro marched towards the Bhima between which and the Ghatprabha the Peshwa's choicest infantry and guns were camped. General Munro's army was not strong enough to enable him to push on the war. On the 19th of April he was joined at Nagar Manoli in North Belgaum by General Pritzler's division of the reserve force from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. This force consisted of two companies of artillery under Lieutenant-Colonel Dalrymple; the European flank battalion composed of the flower of four regiments, who, notwithstanding the difficulties of maintaining in a state of regularity a corps composed of various details, under Major Giles' command, had been as remarkable for their discipline and order as for their gallantry; the four companies of Rifles, the second battalion of the 22nd Native Infantry, the second battalion of the 7th Bombay Native Infantry, and a detachment of Pioneers. Two much-needed iron eighteen pounder guns, and two mortars were likewise brought from the Bombay battering train. With this force General Munro marched north, passed Gherdi about twelve miles south-east of S\u00e1ngola, and arrived at Sid\u00e1pur on the Bhima which was crossed on the 7th of May. The approach of Munro's force compelled the Peshwa's troops to fall back on Shol\u00e1pur to make their final stand. On the 8th of May the British force crossed the Sina at P\u00e1tri and on the 9th took up ground within two miles of the Mar\u00e1tha position, which General Munro immediately under a continual fire closely reconnoitred. A summons,\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 661; Blacker's Mar\u00e1tha War, 248-253.\nwith an offer of terms, had been sent forward by a native officer Chensing, subhed\u00e1r of the 2nd battalion of the 4th Regiment. His singular intelligence and address had in many cases enabled Chensing to induce garrisons to come to terms. On this occasion, in spite of the holiness of his flag, Chensing was cruelly murdered by the Arabs under the walls of the fort. Nothing remained but to begin the siege.\n\nThe Shol\u00e1pur fort is an oblong of large area, with a wall and faussebraye or rampart-mound of substantial masonry flanked by capacious round towers. A broad and deep wet ditch encircles the place, and the north and east sides are covered by a large town surrounded by a good wall and divided into two parts of which one is close to the fort. To the south, communicating with the ditch, a lake, surrounded on three sides by a mound, formed a respectable breastwork to the Mar\u00e1tha position under the walls. Their force thus strongly posted amounted to 2000 Arabs, 1500 Rohil\u00e1s, 1000 Sid\u00eds, 700 Gos\u00e1vis, 5000 infantry, and 1500 cavalry. Major DePinto, a country born European, commanded the regular infantry, and Ganpatrav Pense was the hereditary commandant of the Peshwa's artillery.\u00b9 Nothing effective could be attempted against the fort while the covering army continued unbroken, and to hazard an attack on the army without gaining possession of the works on which it leaned was useless. General Munro accordingly turned his attention chiefly to the reduction of the town. Finding that the walls were not so high or the ditch so deep as to make it impracticable he resolved to try and take the town by escalade. At three on the morning of the 10th of May, the British troops chosen for the attack began to get under arms. The second battalion of the 12th Madras and the 2nd battalion of the 7th Bombay Native Infantry, except their flank companies, remained in charge of the camp under Lieutenant-Colonel Fraser. The remaining troops were formed in the following order. For the escalade of the town walls, under the general orders of Colonel Hewitt, two columns commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Newall and Major Giles, each composed of two European flank companies, two companies of rifles, one incomplete battalion of Native Infantry, and one company of Pioneers. For the support of the escalading force, a reserve, under the personal command of General Pritzler, consisted of a squadron and a half of dragoons with gallopper guns, two European flank companies, four native flank companies, four six-pounders, and two howitzers. The escalading columns took up positions 1000 yards from the point of attack till the day broke. At daybreak they moved briskly forward preceded by the Pioneers carrying scaling ladders, while the reserve,\n\n\u00b9 Blacker's Mar\u00e1tha War, 299. The details of the force vary: According to Blacker the enemy's force amounted to 850 horse, 5550 foot including 1200 Arabs, and fourteen guns independent of the garrison estimated at 1000. This is in Glei's opinion (Life of Munro, I, 494) an under-estimate and the strength in the text was obtained from official returns. According to General Munro's official report in the Bombay Courier dated the 25th of July 1818, the strength of the enemy amounted to 4500 infantry of whom 1200 were Arabs with thirteen guns and about 700 horse.\nfrom a position opposite the same face, opened a smart fire on the front and flanking defences. The ladders were planted with promptitude; and the heads of both columns topped the walls at the same moment. As soon as a sufficient number of men were formed by each column, the towers to the right and left were taken, parties were sent to open the gate, and the whole force entered. The right column, under Lieutenant-Colonel Newall, followed the course of the wall by the right; and, having gained the wall which divides the town, occupied three large houses in the quarter close to the fort. Major Giles with the left column, which was accompanied by Colonel Hewitt, separated into two parts of which one kept along the wall on the left, and the other advanced up the central street to the opposite end after forcing the gate which divided the town. The outer gate was also forced and the columns, both parts of which here rejoined, passed through and, by detaching a company of European grenadiers, dislodged a party of the enemy posted in a neighbouring suburb. Meanwhile outside of the town Ganpatrav left his position near the fort, and, passing round by the eastern side, placed himself with seven guns and a respectable body of horse and foot opposite the reserve on which he immediately opened fire. General Munro, finding himself too weak in men to storm this position and with too few guns to silence the fire, withdrew the reserve under the wall of the town and sent to Colonel Hewitt for a reinforcement. Before the reinforcement came, one of the enemy's tumbrils blew up and the order was given to attack with the bayonet. General Pritzler headed the dragoons, and Colonel Dalrymple the infantry, joined by the artillerymen from the guns, while General Munro then fifty-seven years old directed the charge in person vociferously cheered by the Europeans, whose delight at the veteran's presence among them excused the noisy freedom of their greeting. Meanwhile the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s lost their commander, who was severely wounded, and their second in command who was killed by a cannon shot. They began to draw off their guns, but not in time to prevent three of them falling into the hands of the reserve, while their foot were driven into a garden and enclosures from which they were dislodged by Colonel Newall with a body of Europeans and rifles from the town. In retreating to their original position near the fort the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s passed the south gate of the town, from which Colonel Hewitt ran out a field piece and opening suddenly on them caused much annoyance. A gate leading into the inner town was taken by a company of the 69th Regiment and three companies of Native Infantry. But as the range of their position was found by one of the enemy's guns, the gate was abandoned and the troops confined to the main street and the avenues leading into it. The enemy kept possession of the parts of the town which their matchlocks could reach from the fort. The reserve returned to camp which had meanwhile been moved from the west to the north of the town. It was here joined by Duli Kh\u00e1n an officer in the Niz\u00e1m's service with eight hundred irregulars of whom three hundred were horse. During the day\nthe garrison made some faint attempts to extend their possession of the town. As these efforts proved unsuccessful, their friends outside seemed anxious to quit their position which the events of the morning had made unsafe. As soon as this movement was known in the camp, the detachment of dragoons and as many auxiliary horse, with the two gallopper guns, were ordered out under General Pritzler; and Duli Kh\u00e1n\u2019s horse was directed to follow with all speed. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had left their guns that their flight might not be checked and had fled seven miles before they were overtaken. The gallopers opened on their rear with grape, while a half-squadron took ground on each flank of the retreating column, which maintained an unsteady matchlock fire. When the half squadron came in contact with the enemy, the guns limbered up, and followed as a reserve with the remaining half squadron and Duli Kh\u00e1n\u2019s horse till these likewise and the auxiliary horse joined in the general destruction. Before night put an end to the pursuit on the banks of the Sina the force was completely dispersed. Nearly a thousand men were left dead on the field. Those who remained sought their homes in small parties of ten or fifteen, many of them wounded. The cavalry were back in their lines by ten at night.\n\nAfter the attack on the town no time was lost in beginning operations against the fort. The southern face was chosen as the most favourable for an approach, as on that side there was considerable cover, and as the ditch there was partially dry. On the 11th a battery of one mortar, one howitzer, and two six-pounders, was established behind the dam of the lake to keep the enemy within the walls, and to cover the working parties and advanced posts. This battery was enlarged on the same evening by three additional mortars which opened on the following morning with some effect. On the 13th an approach was made towards the fort, and, under cover of the fire, the beginning of a breaching battery was laid, from the mortars and six-pounders, the practice from which was so admirable as to silence the enemy at many points. An enfilading or raking battery was also marked out for two twelve-pounders and six-pounders and was half finished towards evening, while the garrison were busily employed in throwing up retrenchments. This as well the breaching battery was completed during the night; and both opened on the morning of the 14th with unremitting vigour. By noon the breach of the outer wall was reported practicable; and at the same time the enemy, viewing the rapid progress which had been made, sent to demand terms. They were promised security for themselves and their private property, and on these terms marched out on the following morning. The principal officers received passports to proceed to Poona and the troops dispersed to their homes. In the fort were thirty-seven one to forty-two pounders, including eleven field guns. There were also thirty-nine one to three-pounder wall-pieces. The reduction of this important fort deprived B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s troops of their last rallying-point in the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak; while the losses they had suffered during the operations completely\ndisheartened all abettors of his cause. The loss of the British troops as of the enemy occurred almost entirely on the 10th and amounted to 102 men including four officers.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe fall of Sholapur brought the whole district under the British Government.

On the overthrow of the Peshwa in 1818, 261 villages, ninety-two in Shol\u00e1pur, 123 in B\u00e1rsi, twenty-eight in M\u00e1dha, eight in Karm\u00e1la, and ten in Pandharpur came into the hands of the British Government. In 1822, His Highness the Niz\u00e1m, by a treaty dated the 12th of December 1822, ceded 232 villages, thirty-eight in Shol\u00e1pur, fifty-five in M\u00e1dha, 113 in Karm\u00e1la, and twenty-six in Pandharpur. In 1828, on the death of Daulatr\u00e1v Sindia, two villages in M\u00e1dha lapsed to Government. In 1839 on the death of the Nip\u00e1ni chief eleven villages in Shol\u00e1pur lapsed to Government. In 1842 on the death of the chief of the fourth share of the Miraj state five villages, two in M\u00e1dha, two in Karm\u00e1la, and one in Pandharpur, lapsed to Government. In 1845 on the death of the Soni chief three villages, two in M\u00e1dha and one in Pandharpur, lapsed to Government. In 1848, on the death of the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, 188 villages, forty-four in Pandharpur, seventy-five in S\u00e1ngola, and sixty-nine in M\u00e1lsiras lapsed to Government. In the same year (1848) on the death of the T\u00e1sgaon chief two villages in Pandharpur lapsed to Government. In 1868 His Highness Holkar, under Government Resolution 4470 dated the 28th of November 1868, in exchange for other lands, ceded one village in Pandharpur. In 1870, His Highness the Niz\u00e1m, under Government Resolution 3519 dated the 22nd of July 1870, in exchange for other lands, ceded eleven villages in Shol\u00e1pur.\n\nThe revenue administration of the district is entrusted to an officer styled Collector, on a yearly pay of \u00a32790 (Rs. 27,900). This officer, who is also Political Agent, district magistrate, district registrar, and executive head of the district, is helped in his work of general supervision by a staff of four assistants of whom two are covenanted and two uncovenanted servants of Government. The sanctioned yearly salaries of the covenanted assistants range from \u00a3384 to \u00a31080 (Rs. 3840 to Rs. 10,800) and those of the uncovenanted assistants from \u00a3369 to \u00a3720 (Rs. 3600 to Rs. 7200). For fiscal and other administrative purposes, the lands under the Collector's charge are distributed over seven sub-divisions. Four of these are generally entrusted to\n\n\u00b9 Materials for the Land History of Shol\u00e1pur chiefly include, besides elaborate survey tables prepared by Mr. J. W. Scott of the Revenue Survey, the Survey Reports contained in Bom. Gov. Sel. CL.\nthe covenanted assistant collectors and three to one of the uncovenanted assistants styled district deputy collector. As a rule no sub-division is kept by the Collector under his own direct supervision. The other uncovenanted assistant, styled the head-quarter or huzur deputy collector, is entrusted with the charge of the treasury. These officers are also magistrates and those who have revenue charge of portions of the district have, under the presidency of the Collector, the chief management of the different administrative bodies, local fund and municipal committees, within the limits of their revenue charges.\n\nUnder the supervision of the Collector and his assistant and deputy collectors, the revenue charge of each fiscal sub-division is placed in the hands of an officer styled m\u00fcmlatd\u00e1r. These functionaries who are also entrusted with magisterial powers have yearly salaries varying from \u00a3180 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 1800 - 3000).\n\nIn revenue and police matters the charge of the 663 Government villages is entrusted to 814 headmen or p\u0101t\u012bls of whom three are stipendiary and 811 hereditary. Of the stipendiary headmen one only performs revenue duties and two police and revenue duties. Of the hereditary headmen 147 perform revenue, 143 police, and 521 both revenue and police duties. The headman's yearly endowments depend on the revenue of the village and consist partly of cash payments and partly of remission of land assessment. The cash emoluments vary from 12s. (Rs. 6) to \u00a321 5s. (Rs. 212\u00bd) and average about \u00a33 15s. 8\u00bdd. (Rs. 37 as. 13\u00bd), while the remissions from land assessment range from 1s. (8 as.) to \u00a337 19s. (Rs. 37\u00bd) and average about 10s. 8\u00bdd. (Rs. 5 as. 5\u00bd). Of \u00a33515 (Rs. 35,150) the total yearly charge on account of village headmen, \u00a33080 (Rs. 30,800) are paid in cash and \u00a3435 (Rs. 4350) are met by grants of land and by remissions of assessment on land. To keep the village accounts, draw up statistics, and help the village headmen there is a body of 626 village accountants or kulkarnis. Of these nine are stipendiary and 617 are hereditary. Each has an average charge of one village containing about 930 people and yielding an average yearly revenue of about \u00a3163 (Rs. 1630). Their pay is not fixed once for all but is revised after thirty years. At present the yearly cash allowance amounts to \u00a34672 (Rs. 46,720). The accountant's yearly pay varies from \u00a31 13s. to \u00a320 5s. (Rs. 16\u00bd - 202\u00bd) and averages about \u00a37 9s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 74\u00bd).\n\nUnder the headmen and the accountants are the village servants with a total strength of 1173. These men are liable both for revenue and police duties. They are Musalm\u00e1ns or Hindus of the Koli, Mh\u00e1r, and M\u00e1ng castes. The total yearly grant for the support of this establishment amounts to \u00a31649 (Rs. 16,490) being \u00a31 8s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 14 as. 1\u00bd) to each man or a cost to each village of \u00a32 9s. 9\u00bdd. (Rs. 24\u00bd). Of this charge \u00a3294 (Rs. 2940) are paid in cash and \u00a31355 (Rs. 13,550) are met by grants of land.\n\nIn alienated villages the village officers and servants are paid by the alienees and perform both revenue and police duties for Government.\nThe average yearly cost of village establishments may be thus summarised:\n\n| Sholapur Village Establishments, 1884. |\n|--------------------------------------|\n| Headmen ... | \u00a33515 | Rs. 35,150 |\n| Accountants | 4672 | 46,720 |\n| Servants    | 1649 | 16,490 |\n| Total       | 9886 | 98,360 |\n\nThis is equal to a charge of \u00a314 16s. 8\u00bdd. (Rs. 148 as. 5\u00bd) a village or about ten per cent of the district land revenue.\n\nBefore 1869, when the present (1884) district of Sholapur was formed, its subdivisions were frequently transferred from one district to another. Of the seven sub-divisions included in the present district, Pandharpur and S\u00e1ngola were in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra until 1864 and M\u00e1lsiras until 1875. Before 1838 the northern sub-division of Karm\u00e1la was in Ahmadnagar and the central sub-division of Mohol was in Poona; and the eastern and southern sub-divisions of B\u00e1rsi and Sholapur more than once passed from Ahmadnagar to Poona and from Poona to Ahmadnagar. In 1838 the sub-divisions of Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, Mohol, M\u00e1dha, Karm\u00e1la, Indi, Hippargi, and Muddebih\u00e1l, formed a collectorate styled Sholapur which was abolished in 1864. In 1869 the sub-divisions of Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, Mohol, M\u00e1dha, and Karm\u00e1la together with Pandharpur and S\u00e1ngola were formed into the present (1884) Sholapur district which in 1875 received from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the addition of M\u00e1lsiras.\n\n1 S\u00e1ngola and M\u00e1lsiras were formed between 1862 and 1864 out of Pandharpur and Khat\u00e1v in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n2 Afterwards Mohol and M\u00e1dha, and now (1884) M\u00e1dha.\n3 The following are the available notices of these changes. In 1819 some sub-divisions were made over from Ahmadnagar to Poona (Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 50 of 1822, 164; see East India Papers, III, 795). In 1819-20 B\u00e1rsi was a sub-division of Ahmadnagar. (Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 50 of 1822, 161). Between 1820 and 1822 B\u00e1rsi was attached to the sub-collectorate of Sholapur and in return for those ceded to the Niz\u00e1m, Ahmadnagar received the pargonds of Karm\u00e1la and Korti. (East India Papers, IV, 728). In 1822-23 that part of the Sholapur sub-collectorate which lay to the north of the river Bhima was transferred to Ahmadnagar. (Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 50 of 1822, 501). In 1824-25 the Sholapur sub-collectorate consisting of Sholapur, Mohol, B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, and Korti was subordinate to Ahmadnagar. (Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 123 of 1825, 8, 17). About this time it was found that the districts were not well managed by sub-collectors and the proposal to make Sholapur a collectorate was sanctioned (18th February 1825), the sub-divisions being B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, Korti, Sholapur, Mohol, Indi, and Muddebih\u00e1l. (Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 123 of 1825, 519, 535, 550). In November 1826 the collectorate was abolished, Indi, Muddebih\u00e1l, Sholapur, and Mohol being transferred to Poona, and B\u00e1rsi Karm\u00e1la and Korti to Ahmadnagar. (Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 174 of 1827, 403; and Rec. 207 of 1828, 501, 503, 505). In October 1829 the Sholapur sub-division was transferred from Poona to Ahmadnagar and Indi and Muddebih\u00e1l from Poona to Dh\u00e1rwar; and in March 1830 Ahmadnagar was made a principal collectorate with a sub-collector at Sholapur. (Rev. Rec. 352 of 1831, 2, 102). In January 1831 the sub-divisions of B\u00e1rsi and Sholapur were transferred from Ahmadnagar to Poona. (Rev. Rec. 406 of 1832, 235). In 1831-32 Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, and Mohol were in Poona and formed a sub-collectorate (Rev. Rec. 484 of 1833, 31, and Rec. 694 of 1836, 313); and Poona was made a principal collectorate and Ahmadnagar reduced to be a collectorate, Karm\u00e1la and Korti remaining sub-divisions of Ahmadnagar. (Rev. Rec. 408 of 1832, 43, 45, 49, and Rec. 548 of 1834, 52). In 1835-36 Sholapur was a sub-collectorate subordinate\nThese territorial changes show that during the first twenty years (1818-1838) of British rule, the present (1884) district of Sholapur was partly in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra a native state, which lapsed in 1848, and partly in the British districts of Poona and Ahmadnagar. The revenue history of British Sholapur during this period differs little from the history of Ahmadnagar, and still less from that of Poona as more of Sholapur was in Poona than in Ahmadnagar. As was the case in Poona and Ahmadnagar after a few years of rapid advance the chief characteristics subsequent to 1825 were low prices, heavy assessment, and large remissions.\n\nThe kam\u00e1l rates remained in force till 1830 when, as Sholapur for some years had been steadily deteriorating, they were replaced by Mr. Pringle\u2019s settlement. Mr. Pringle\u2019s settlement from its errors, its excessive rates, and also from the very bad seasons which followed its introduction, broke down; short or ukti and lease or kauli rates were granted between 1836 and 1839; and in 1840 the thirty years\u2019 revenue survey settlement was begun by Captain Wingate. In the Sholapur sub-division the approximate average acre rates were under the Musalm\u00e1n tankha 1s. 1\u00bdd. (9 as.), under the Mar\u00e1tha kam\u00e1l 1s. 7\u00bdd. (13\u00bd as.), under Mr. Pringle\u2019s settlement of 1830 1s. 5\u00bdd. (11\u00bd as.), and under the survey settlement of 1840 9\u00bdd. (6\u00bd as.). The average collections under the Mar\u00e1tha kam\u00e1l were at the rate of 1s. 3\u00bdd. (10\u00bd as.), the average collections under Mr. Pringle\u2019s settlement were at the rate of 1s. 1\u00bdd. (9\u00bd as.), and the average collections under the survey settlement were at the rate of 9\u00bdd. (6\u00bd as.). During the twenty years ending 1838 the condition of the Sholapur district was no less distressed than that of Poona. The revenue survey was begun in Sholapur at the same time and under the same officers as in Poona. In Poona the first survey settlement was introduced into Ind\u00e1pur between 1836 and 1838 and in Sholapur the first survey settlement was introduced into Mohol-M\u00e1dha in 1839-40. The following are the leading details of the Mohol-M\u00e1dha settlement.\n\nIn 1839-40 after completing the settlement of Ind\u00e1pur now in Poona, Lieutenants Wingate and Davidson introduced the survey settlement to Poona. It included the sub-divisions of Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, Mohol, and M\u00e1dha a part of the old Mohol subdivision. (Rev. Rec. 772 of 1837, 101, 123). In 1838 Sholapur was made a collectorate including the sub-divisions of Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, Mohol, M\u00e1dha, Karm\u00e1la, Indi, Hippargi, and Muddebih\u00e1l. (Rev. Rec. 1098 of 1840, 3 and Rec. 1243 of 1841, 40). In 1844 the Sholapur collectorate which stretched from Korti to N\u00e1latv\u00e1d on the river Krishna some forty miles south of Bij\u00e1pur was abolished; its southern sub-divisions of Indi, Hippargi, Mangoli, and Muddebih\u00e1l were taken from it to form the new collectorate of Kal\u00e1dg\u00ed now (1884) styled Bij\u00e1pur; and the remaining sub-divisions with the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-divisions of Pandharpur and Sangola formed the sub-collectorate of Sholapur. In August 1869 this sub-collectorate was raised to be a junior collectorate and the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division of M\u00e1lsiras was added to it in 1875. The collectorate so formed is the present (1884) Sholapur district.\n\n1 The Muhammadan or tankha rates of assessment were superseded during the latter years of Mar\u00e1tha rule by what were known as the kam\u00e1l rates which included cesses of various kinds. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 254.\n\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 61, 184, 335, 427.\n\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 254-255.\ninto M\u0101dha and Mohol. Until three years before this settlement these two village groups had formed the single sub-division of Mohol. In 1822-23 the Mohol group of villages yielded a revenue of about \u00a34950 (Rs. 49,500) on a cultivated area of about 78,000 acres. Between 1822 and 1826 tillage spread to 85,000 acres, but collections fell to about \u00a33700 (Rs. 37,000). Of these four years, 1824-25 was a year of famine whose memory remained in 1871, and in which of a rental of \u00a36300 (Rs. 63,000), only \u00a3850 (Rs. 8500) were collected. After 1825 a decline in tillage set in and steadily continued till in 1832-33 tillage had fallen to 56,000 acres. Like 1824-25, 1832-33 was a year of famine when the collections were about \u00a3850 (Rs. 8500). By 1838-39 the revenue had risen to about \u00a34500 (Rs. 45,000). Of the villages of the Mohol-M\u0101dha group, complete returns were available only for the Mohol villages. The state of the M\u0101dha villages was in every way so much like the state of the Mohol villages that the Mohol details may be taken to apply to both the groups. In the Mohol group during the seventeen years ending 1838-39, the tillage area roughly averaged 69,000 acres. On this the average assessment was \u00a35356 (Rs. 53,560) that is an average acre rate of 1s. 6\u00bd d. (12\u00bd as.). The collections during these years averaged \u00a33200 (Rs. 32,000) or an average acre rate of 11\u00bd d. (7\u00bd as.). Even this reduced rate seemed to press too heavily on the landholders. Between 1822-23 and 1835-36 tillage declined from 78,000 acres in 1822-23 to 57,000 acres in 1835-36, and collections from \u00a34950 (Rs. 49,500) to \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000). Lieutenant Davidson noticed that every year of large collections was followed by a decline of tillage and every year of low collections was followed by a spread of tillage. In the absence of any record of the character of the different seasons included in this period it is impossible to say how far the changes in tillage were the result of the varying seasons and how far they were due to the changes in the collections. As in other parts of the Deccan a chief cause of the depressed state of the Mohol-M\u0101dha villages was the ruinous fall in prices. The rupee price of jv\u0101ri which, excluding the famine year of 1824-25, in the three years ending 1825-26 averaged 80 pounds (32 shers), fell to 260 pounds (104 shers) in 1826-27 and in 1827-28, and between 1828-29 and 1838-39, except in the famine year of 1832-33 when it rose to 67\u00bd pounds (27 shers), varied from 237\u00bd to 122\u00bd pounds (95 to 49 shers) and averaged 162\u00bd pounds (65 shers). In the three years ending 1838-39 the price was steady at 162\u00bd pounds (65 shers) that is about half as high as during the three years ending 1825-26.\n\nThe tillage, collections, and price details are:\n\n1 Lieut. Wingate, Surv. Supt. 86 of 15 June 1839; Lieut. Davidson, Asst. Supt. 20th May 1839; Bom Gov. Sel. CL. 47, 80.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 53.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 109 and the survey diagram in Lieut.

CL. 84-85, Survey Diagrams.\nIn 1836-37 short or *ukti* rates were introduced which were equivalent to the remission of part of Mr. Pringle's assessment. The result of these remissions in the Mohol group was that in the three years ending 1838-39, while tillage rose from 62,000 to 90,000 acres, collections fell from \u00a34800 (Rs. 48,000) to \u00a34500 (Rs. 45,000).\u00b9\n\nThe following statement shows that during the eighteen years ending 1838-39 the gross yearly rent settlement or *jam\u0101bandi* of the Mohol and M\u0101dha village groups varied from \u00a313,343 (Rs. 1,33,430) in 1832-33 to \u00a319,758 (Rs. 1,97,580) in 1822-23 and averaged \u00a316,968 (Rs. 1,69,680); the collections varied from \u00a33048 (Rs. 30,480) in 1832-33 to \u00a316,128 (Rs. 1,61,280) in 1833-34 and averaged \u00a311,468 (Rs. 1,14,680); and the percentage of collections varied from 21 in 1824-25 to 97 in 1833-34 and averaged 67.

The escape pipe of a reservoir could not more effectually prevent the rise of its waters than the Mar\u00e1tha kam\u00e1l prevented the increase of wealth in the Mohol villages. The state of the sub-division was a remarkable proof of the ruinous effects of heavy assessment and yearly remissions. None were rich because it was their interest to be poor. The standard of comfort had fallen so low that in a year of complete or even of partial failure of crops there was no margin left for retrenchment. Some of the villages which had suffered most from the famine of 1832-33 were a mass of roofless walls. The people had died or fled because they were too poor to buy grain. In every country the section of the people who live from hand to mouth are rendered destitute by a season of scarcity. In this tract such was the poverty of the people that one bad year reduced the bulk of them to destitution. Poverty prevented the people from attempting to improve the tillage. With a little capital, garden tillage might be greatly extended and would be one of the best safeguards against the full force of a famine. Another improvement, for which the natural features of the country gave many facilities, was the building of walls to catch soil which was being swept from the uplands to the streams during the rainy season floods. First rate soil gathered behind embankments with the most surprising speed.\n\nDetails collected by the survey officers showed that in five Mohol and M\u00e1dha villages out of 373 landholders 190 had one to three bullocks, 126 had four to seven bullocks, and only fifty-seven had more than seven bullocks. As in the lands of these villages not fewer than eight bullocks were required to draw a plough and no fewer than four were wanted for the proper working of the harrow, called palli or kulav, these details showed that without help from others nearly half of the landholders could not till their land. Except Tenki, all the villages from which these details were taken had garden land and were rather favourable specimens of the groups. In Tenki, which had suffered cruelly from the 1832-33 famine, of forty landholders only one had cattle enough to work a plough while no fewer than thirty-three had not stock enough to work a harrow.\n\n---\n\n1 Lieut. Davidson's Report referred to the Mohol group. According to Lieut. Wingate, 15th June 1839, this description was equally true of the M\u00e1dha villages, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 54.\n2 Lieut. Davidson, Asst. Supt. of Survey, 20th May 1839; Bom. Gov. Sel. CL, 82-83. In Lieut. Davidson's opinion besides a heavy land tax, other causes of poverty were the subdivision of property and early marriages.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 55. The details are:\n\n| Bullocks | Landholders |\n|----------|-------------|\n|          | M\u00e1dha | Laul | Jaloli | B\u00e1bulgaon | Tenki | Total |\n| 8 and more | 19    | 24   | 8      | 5         | 1     | 57    |\n| 4 to 7    | 58    | 41   | 7      | 14        | 6     | 128   |\n| 1 to 3    | 85    | 60   | 15     | 7         | 33    | 190   |\n| Total     | 162   | 115  | 30     | 26        | 40    | 373   |\n\nMohol-M\u00e1dha Farm Stock, 1839.\nThe general poverty of the landholders greatly depressed the husbandry. The M\u0101dha villages had 21,834 bullocks and male buffaloes that is only one bullock to every ten dry-crop acres under tillage instead of one bullock to every six acres of dry-crop or jirdy\u0101t. Lieutenant Wingate was unable to find a single recent case of a price being paid for the privilege of occupying Government dry-crop or jirdy\u0101t land. The fact that dry-crop land had no sale value showed that the present assessment absorbed the whole rent of the land; further proofs that the assessment absorbed the whole rent of the land were to be found in the bat\u0101i tenures which obtained in every village. Under every variation these tenures had one common feature that the actual cultivator or under-holder assigned part of the gross produce to the over-holder on condition that the over-holder paid the assessment. The usual arrangement was that the under-holder bore the cost of seed and tillage, and, after the customary payments had been made, assigned the over-holder a half to a third of the produce. Lieutenant Wingate knew of no instance in which the share of the crop assigned to the over-holder was less than one-third. Even the third was almost always in newly ploughed land which was prepared at greatly more than the ordinary cost. Seeing that these tenures were common in every village, even where waste land was abundant, and every effort was made to induce people to take it for tillage, it would appear a consideration of capital importance that, where they occurred, the cultivator, rather than became responsible for the payment of the assessment, would assign to another a third, nay in most cases a half of his gross produce. The over-holders of fields, cultivated on the crop share or bat\u0101i tenure, were generally Br\u0101hmans or poor hereditary holders or mir\u0101sdd\u0101rs who calculated on making some little profit in average and good seasons, and of receiving remissions in bad. In Lieutenant Wingate's opinion these facts proved that the assessment was burdensome. He was persuaded that if it was not for the state monopoly of land in a tract so thinly peopled and so empty of capital as Mohol-M\u0101dha, the rent of even the richest lands instead of varying from a third to a half would be less than one-fourth of the produce. Even if the present assessment was not more than what the land could pay in an ordinary season and when grain was selling at an average price, it would be oppressive and ruinous in a tract so liable to failure of crops.\n\nIn July 1839 in submitting to Government the survey officers' reports, the Revenue Commissioner Mr. Vibart observed that though he agreed with the survey officers that the people were among the poorest in the Bombay Presidency and that a reduction of assessment was called for, he did not agree with them that the people were on the verge of starvation. Even Lieutenant Wingate's figures of farm stock, though they proved a deficiency, proved also that the people were several removes from starvation.\n\nTests taken by the survey officers showed a creditable accuracy\n\n---\n\n1 Lieutenant Wingate, 15th June 1839, Bom.

Of the forty-six Mohol villages examined by Lieutenant Davidson, in five only did the error in measuring the cultivated land exceed ten per cent; the average error of the remaining forty-one villages was five per cent. In the M\u00e1dha group Lieutenant Wingate found the former survey measurements of cultivated land fairly correct. Eleven of seventy-two villages had to be remeasured; in the remaining sixty-one villages the error in the cultivated land was a little over six per cent. As the boundary marks had disappeared, the whole of the waste land in both the sub-divisions, Mohol and M\u00e1dha, had to be remeasured. The whole arable area was reclassed on the system followed in Ind\u00e1pur in the Poona district.\u00b9 The proposed rates for Mohol were ten per cent and for M\u00e1dha five per cent in advance of the Ind\u00e1pur rates.\u00b2 The two groups together contained 381,000 acres of Government arable land. At the proposed rates the assessment on the arable area amounted to nearly \u00a313,700 (Rs. 1,37,000). Including \u00a31600 (Rs. 16,000) on account of miscellaneous or s\u00e1yar revenue and watered land assessment, the full rental of Mohol and M\u00e1dha under the new settlements amounted to \u00a315,300 (Rs. 1,53,000). The average collections from all sources including the full allowances of claimants or hakd\u00e1rs, village expenses, and outstanding balances, between the British accession and the close of 1838-39, amounted to about \u00a311,450 (Rs. 1,14,500) a year. Compared with this the above survey total was \u00a33850 (Rs. 38,500) more or an increase of 33 per cent. The immediate effect of the new settlement was to reduce the rental to \u00a311,600 (Rs. 1,16,000) that is \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) or 17\u00bd per cent less than the collections of 1838-39.\u00b3 In the Mohol group the survey rates on the dry-crop or jir\u00e1yat land under tillage caused a reduction from \u00a34700 to \u00a33700 (Rs. 47,000 - Rs. 37,000) or 21 per cent.\u2074\n\nIn 1840-41 the survey settlement was introduced into Shol\u00e1pur. The measurements of the Shol\u00e1pur and Ahirv\u00e1di village groups, comprising a circle of twelve to fifteen miles round the town of Shol\u00e1pur, were tested between November 1838 and June 1839, and the reclassing\u2075 of the Shol\u00e1pur group was well advanced when the survey settlement proposals were submitted in June 1839. Of the whole area of 256,878 acres, of which a very large proportion had lain waste since Mr. Pringle's survey and whose boundaries had been often nearly obliterated, ten per cent were tested. Of seventy-one villages, in fifty-one the error was found to be within ten per\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel.

The new rental Rs. 1,16,000 was Rs. 5000 more than the average collections previous to the introduction of the ukhi or short rates. In the two years 1836-1838 the revenue was 'sustained at an unnatural height' by a partial introduction of the revised settlements under the name of short or ukhi rates. Ditto, 61.\n\u2074 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 87.\n\u2075 The reclassing of the two groups began in December 1838. In Shol\u00e1pur sixteen villages with an area of 71,618 acres or half of the whole were finished and tested before June 1839. In consequence of the very limited establishment at the beginning the work necessarily proceeded slowly. It was calculated (June 1839) that it would be finished before the next rent settlement or jam\u00e1bandi, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 183.\ncent, in five it was above ten per cent in cultivated land, and in twelve it was above ten per cent in waste land, while three villages required total remeasuring.\\(^1\\) The Shol\u00e1pur group was bounded on the north-west by Mohol, on the north-east by the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, on the east and south by the Akalkot state, and on the west by the river Sina.\\(^2\\) Its total area was 401 square miles or 256,878 acres.\\(^3\\) Of these exclusive of 16,255 alienated acres the total arable area was 210,996 acres and the rest was appropriated as pasture and farmed out. Of 128,095 acres the area under tillage 2434 acres were let at short or \\textit{ukti} rates averaging 3d. (2 as.) an acre. Of garden land there were only 1044 acres in the Shol\u00e1pur and 599 in the Ahirv\u00e1di group or a total of 1643 acres.\\(^4\\) The country was bare with a waving surface which in places rose into small hillocks showing the bare rock. It was less rugged and stony than the Mohol group which bounded it on the north-west. The quality of the almost level surface was various and irregular; the dips had much fine alluvial soil. The proportion of each soil in a few villages, which the assistant survey superintendent Captain Bellasis examined, was, of 100 parts, ten black, fifty red, and forty gravelly. The black soil being about one-tenth of the whole was found only in small patches of no great depth, resting on a sandy loam with pebbly limestone under it. Towards the banks of the Sina black soil was more plentiful but meagre, with limestone under-layers. On the whole the soil of this survey group, particularly near Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1la, Degaon, and the south-east of Ahirv\u00e1di, was rich enough to grow finer products than the depressed people could attempt. Signs of careless tillage were common everywhere, and a field was seldom ploughed but from necessity. The climate was dry and the supply of rain, as there were neither hills nor woods, was very scanty. All the late or \\textit{rabi} grains, oils, and pulses were grown, but there was little \\textit{bajri}. The rude though often efficient system of tillage was in all respects like that of Ind\u00e1pur and east Bhimthadi.\n\nThroughout the two groups of Shol\u00e1pur and Ahirv\u00e1di, the roads or more properly the cart-tracks were good. Within Shol\u00e1pur limits the Poona road had been cleared of stones. The fords of the Sina near Narkhed, L\u00e1mboti, N\u00e1ndur, and Tirha, all required clearing.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In several villages the old survey fractions or \\textit{tut} numbers of ancient fields or \\textit{kadim d\u00e1g} were remeasured and village boundary stones restored whenever the parties could be brought to agree. Out of 2620 acres in dispute 1480 were settled by arbitration. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 181.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Niz\u00e1m\u2019s villages were mixed with the Shol\u00e1pur villages on the north. Three Shol\u00e1pur villages called \\textit{phut} or detached were isolated in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, a belt of which about ten miles broad separated Shol\u00e1pur from Vair\u00e1g and B\u00e1rsi. Mangrul, the most distant village was eighteen miles from Shol\u00e1pur. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 185.\n\n\\(^3\\) The 1839 details are: In the Shol\u00e1pur group 88,343 acres were under tillage, 43,713 acres of arable waste, 2038 acres of grass land or \\textit{kurans}, 10,867 acres of alienated or \\textit{indm} land, 367 acres disputed, and 19,832 barren; total 165,180 acres. In the Ahirv\u00e1di group 39,752 acres were under tillage, 38,048 acres of arable waste, 5388 alienated, 773 disputed, and 7737 barren; total 91,698. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 184.\n\n\\(^4\\) The 599 acres of garden land in Ahirv\u00e1di were all well-watered and the assessment as fixed by a jury or \\textit{panchayat} in 1835-36 was fair. In Mangrul alone there were 400 acres. As it was an ancient or \\textit{kadim} garden village, the garden land of Mangrul was assessed at an acre rate of 13s. 6d. (Rs. 6\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)) though the average acre rate was only 5s. 6d. (Rs. 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 184.\nand repair. Sholapur in the centre of the group was a considerable thriving town of 24,000 people. It was a ready, in fact the only, market for the surplus produce of the surrounding villages. In 1838 the import duties amounted to \u00a31354 (Rs.13,540). Large quantities of kir\u00e1na, ginger, garlic, safflower, betel, surangi, and other valuable products were brought from the neighbouring Niz\u00e1m\u2019s villages to Sholapur. Sholapur was also a centre of the salt and betelnut trade between the Ratn\u00e1giri coast and the inland tracts, and for cotton, coarse cotton cloths, and robes, from the surrounding villages.\n\nBefore they came into British possession the most flourishing period of the Sholapur and Ahirv\u00e1di groups was said to have been about the beginning of the century when they were under the management of R\u00e1mchandra Shiv\u00e1ji a relative of the Peshwa. At that time nearly the whole of the arable land was said to have been under tillage and all the wells in repair. From this state of prosperity the groups were thrown into the deepest poverty by the famine of 1803-4 which was known as the one and a quarter sher or p\u00e1nchchipti year and nearly emptied the country.\u00b9 From 1817 (Fasli 1227) they were superintended by \u00c1b\u00e1ji Ball\u00e1l the commander or killed\u00e1r of Sholapur under the M\u00e1nkeshvar of Tembhurni until \u00c1b\u00e1ji was deposed for oppression a little before the affair at Ashta. The old or m\u00e1mul measures, which as usual varied in every six or eight villages, were the shers and t\u00f3ks (72 to the sher), the pais\u00e1s, the adhel\u00e1s, and the bigha of the Musalm\u00e1ns; all varied with the quality of the soil. The full or sosti rates, including all the extra cesses levied by the Peshwa\u2019s managers, must have weighed heavily on the Kunbi and paralysed his exertions, had not tracts of the poorer lands, particularly under M\u00e1nkeshvar\u2019s management, been given on easy rising leases or ist\u00e1ra kauls and at light or ukti rates as an offset to the heavy regular rate. It was this that gave rise to the present (1839) clamour for leases or kauls as the existing assessment was as heavy as the total or kamdl without the leases. In some villages Captain Bellasis found only one rate for every kind of soil; in others there were as many as five or six rates. At Narkhed where the original or m\u00e1mul bigha was the nominal measure, five rates were in force varying from eight to twelve annas the bigha, and leases or kauls ran from five to seven years. The fields varied in size from twenty to forty acres and the rates averaged \u00a31 10s. to \u00a32 10s. (Rs.15-Rs. 25) the navt\u00e1k or one-eighth of a sher.\u00b2 The twenty-four years ending 1838 included five specially bad years, three 1820-21, 1824-25, and 1832-33 of partial famine caused by drought; one of failure of crops from excess of rain, the year known as \u2018kard\u00eds\u00e1l\u2019; and one 1825-26 known as the rat year or und\u00edrs\u00e1l when the crops were nearly destroyed by rats. In 1838-39 little or no rain fell. During the twenty-two years ending 1839 cholera had thrice thinned the population. The only specially good season was 1833-34, known as\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel.

Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 192.\nIn 1839 the proportion of arable waste was 33 per cent in the Shol\u00e1pur group and 48 per cent in the Ahirv\u00e1di group. Most of this waste land bore marks of former tillage. Seventeen of the thirty Ahirv\u00e1di villages were nearly empty, all of which showed signs of former prosperity. Except these seventeen Ahirv\u00e1di villages, the villages were many degrees better than most in Bhimthadi, Ind\u00e1pur, or Mohol. Still they were very ruinous and filthy, the walls were in ruins, and the appearance of most villages was uncomfortable and desolate. The headmen had lost the greater part of their incomes. They were everywhere apathetic and indifferent, and in some villages no man could be found willing to take the post of headman. Their houses were in ruins; many were living in the thatched corners of old mansions or vadd\u00e1s. Numbers who formerly owned a horse a cart or a camel were reduced to the bare necessaries of life and forced to work in the fields as labourers. The village clerks were not so badly off as the headmen. Most of the landholders were without the means of completing their four-pair team of plough cattle. Great and small were sunk in debt and powerless to repair wells or to spread tillage.\n\nExcept in a few villages the highest dry-crop or jir\u00e1yat acre rates of the old survey were about 4s. (Rs. 2). One of the most heavily assessed villages was Ulha eight miles north of Shol\u00e1pur. The rate here was 4s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 2\u00bd) the acre. Captain Bellasis remembered (1839) that before the 1832 famine this had been a prosperous village, populous, and with a couple of shops. In 1839 it was next to deserted, the shops were removed; the trees had disappeared, the wall was down, and the place in ruins. Of 4100 arable acres 2475 were waste, and the revenue had fallen from \u00a3106 12s. (Rs. 1066) in 1831-32 to \u00a361 16s. (Rs. 618) in 1838-39. The village headman and clerk had become involved in defalcations and were ruined; there was an outstanding balance of \u00a3346 12s. (Rs. 3466). Several of the people who had left Ulha were settled in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s village of Taradgaon. In 1827, three years before Mr. Pringle\u2019s survey, Ulha yielded a net revenue of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000).\n\nThat this ruin was the work of over-assessment was shown by the neighbouring village of Honsal which though similar to Ulha was assessed at only 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) the acre. Nearly the whole village was under the plough; out of 2049 arable acres only 384 were waste; the revenue was improving, only \u00a38 (Rs. 80) were outstanding; and during the seven years ending 1839 the remissions amounted to only \u00a310 (Rs. 100).\n\nOn the basis of the rates introduced into Ind\u00e1pur in Poona, Captain Bellasis proposed a highest dry-crop acre rate of 2s. (Re. 1). Though this was 33 per cent higher than the Ind\u00e1pur rate, the immediate effect of the settlement was estimated to be a reduction\n\n---\n\n1 Captain Bellasis, Assistant Survey Superintendent, 26th June 1839, Shol\u00e1pur and Ahirv\u00e1di Survey Report, Bom.

Captain Bellasis believed that this slight sacrifice of revenue would prove so great a relief to the landholders that the spread of tillage would soon make up or more than make up for the loss of revenue. Many well-to-do landholders would at once come in from the Niz\u0101m\u2019s villages.\n\nSettlement proposals for the Mandrup group of forty villages, the rest of the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division, were made in 1839-40, and the settlement was introduced in 1840-41 in the entire sub-division including Shol\u00e1pur Ahirv\u00e1di and Mandrup. The Mandrup group was bounded on the north by Mohol and on the east south and west by the Sina and Bhima rivers. Across the Sina on the east lay Shol\u00e1pur Ahirv\u00e1di and the Akalkot state. Across the Bhima on the south-west and west was a strip of land belonging to the Patvardhan family. Beyond the Patvardhan strip the territory of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chief formed the bank of the Bhima on the south till its meeting with the Sina. The greatest length of the Mandrup group was about twenty-three miles from north-west to south-east and its greatest breadth about eighteen miles. It included forty villages of which one was a double-owned or dum\u00e1la village of the Nip\u00e1nikar, and two, which belonged to the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division, were for convenience placed under the mah\u00e1lkari of Mandrup. The total area was 138,470 acres of which 4857 acres were under the dum\u00e1la village. The country was in general flat, particularly on the banks of the Sina. In some parts of the upper end of the group the ground was rocky and uneven. With this exception and that of a few risings near the centre the whole of the land was a black soil plain. Beginning at K\u00e1m\u00edti Khurd and going down the Sina to Kudal, the land of thirteen villages was beautiful. Except little patches of grazing ground the greater part was a deep black mould. The land of K\u00e1m\u00edti Budrukhl, Gunjegaon, J\u00e1mgaon, Vatvat, Barud, and M\u00e1lkanta was not good. Kandalgaon, Antroli, Yelgaon, Mandrup, and N\u00e1ndni had mixed soil, some good some very inferior, and Vad\u00e9pur had a ridge of rocky ground. With these exceptions, beginning at Miri and going down the Bhima to Kudal, including Vinchur and Nimbargi, the land on the Sina side was excellent.\n\nMost of the Mandrup villages were sadly ruined. The walls in some places were unconnected pieces of mud, and in others the old site only was pointed out. Yelgaon was the only village at which any attempt had been made to rebuild the wall, the headman having induced each of the villagers to build a little. The village officers were apathetic and indifferent.\n\nMany villages in Mandrup had streams holding water throughout the year. In many cases this water was not used though ruined water-\n\n---\n\n1 The collections of 1838 were \u00a37783 (Rs. 77,830); the largest collection since the 1830 survey was \u00a39040 (Rs. 90,400); the rental estimated at the new survey rates on the actual tillage \u00a35630 (Rs. 56,300) and on the entire arable land \u00a33739 (Rs. 37,390).

The survey officer feared some time must pass before the people would again be able to use these streams. Some years of low assessment would be required before the capital would be available. The village wells were in a bad state, and the want of water caused great distress to man and beast. No use for irrigation purposes was made of the water either of the Bhima or of the Sina. The great force of these rivers when in flood was a reason why no attempt had been made to throw a dam across them and no water was raised by bags because the people believed that to pollute the river with the touch of leather was a sin.\\(^1\\) The two chief roads were to Bij\u00e1pur and to R\u00e1j\u00e1pur. Streams and rivers made these roads difficult for carts and the soil was so heavy and black that the roads could not be kept in repair during the wet weather. Many of the fords across the Bhima and the Sina required clearing and improving. These villages had suffered considerably from gangs of robbers. The people were much impoverished and nothing would so much tend to improve them as a light assessment. The only industry was agriculture and in consequence of the high assessment they had been forced to live in the poorest possible way. In Mr. Robertson's opinion, probably an incorrect opinion, they were perhaps the worst housed, worst fed, and worst clothed people in the world. There was no trade and no manufactures. The poverty and wretchedness of the cultivators were gradually undermining the class above them and bade fair to involve all in the common ruin.\\(^2\\)\n\nAs in the formerly settled village groups, in Mandrup Mr. Pringle's survey measurements were tested, and villages in which more than ten per cent of error was found were remeasured. Mr. Robertson found the old survey measurements upon the whole very good. In all cases a new classing was introduced. Mr. Robertson proposed rates fifteen per cent above those introduced into Ind\u00e1pur. The rates of several m\u00e1l\u00e1s or vegetable gardens had been revised a few years before Mr. Robertson's settlement by a jury or panch\u00e1yat who had fixed a bigha rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) equal to an acre rate of 8s. (Rs. 4). This rate Mr. Robertson did not change.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn April 1840 Lieutenant Wingate the Survey Superintendent submitted Captain Bellasis' proposals for the Shol\u00e1pur-Ah\u00edrv\u00e1di survey group, and Lieutenant Robertson's proposals for the survey group of Mandrup. Lieutenant Wingate observed that the soils, climate, and circumstances of the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division in all essential respects were the same as those of the adjoining subdivisions of Mohol and M\u00e1lha. At the same time the Shol\u00e1pur group had the great advantage of the Shol\u00e1pur market. This advantage was almost certainly the reason why its tillage had been less subject than other neighbouring groups to extremes of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Sel.

This was the case in spite of the extensive and flourishing market of Sholapur where the demand for field produce was greater than it had been in the times of the late government. Lieutenant Wingate, from what he had himself seen was satisfied that there was an utter absence of activity or enterprise among the husbandmen and that both the villages and the husbandry were wretched. That this was chiefly due to an excessive land tax, Lieutenant Wingate was convinced from reflection and still more from observing the happy results which had immediately followed a reduction in every group of villages hitherto settled. In a country so subject to drought as this part of the Deccan it would probably be impossible to do without yearly remissions, at least until garden tillage had greatly increased and the state of the people had much improved. The yearly remissions and outstandings during the period before the survey settlement were large, averaging twenty per cent of the land revenue. This in Lieutenant Wingate's opinion showed that the present assessment was grievously disproportional to the means of\n\n---\n\n1 Remissions and balances include items on account of s\u0101y\u0101r or miscellaneous revenue. It would be enough if about \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) a year were added to the collections on this account. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 213. The sher was a large sher one-ninth larger than that of Indapur.

In illustration of the opposite effects of heavy and light assessment Lieutenant Wingate cited the already mentioned case of the two neighbouring and similar villages of Ulha and Honsal in which a highest dry-crop acre rate of 4s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 2\u00bd) had reduced Ulha to ruin and a corresponding average rate of 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) had raised Honsal to prosperity. He also cited the case of Indapur which had passed through the bad season of 1838-39 without requiring more than four per cent of remissions. All these considerations led to the conclusion that the Sholapur rates called for reduction. Lieutenant Wingate supported Captain Bellasis' proposal for a highest dry-crop acre rate of 2s. (Re. 1) for the Sholapur-Ahirvadi group, a rate which as already noticed was thirty-three per cent higher than the Indapur rate. For the Mandrup group instead of Mr. Robertson's proposed increase of fifteen per cent over the Indapur rate, Lieutenant Wingate proposed an increase of twenty per cent. These rates gave an average acre rate of 9d. (6 as.) for the Sholapur group and 10\u00bdd. (7 as.) for the Mandrup group where the soil was better. The total survey rental for the entire Sholapur sub-division including the extra cess to be imposed on watered lands, amounted to \u00a312,700 (Rs. 1,27,000), or \u00a31100 (Rs. 11,000) in excess of the average collections of the seventeen preceding years, and \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000) in excess of the collections of the four preceding years. The garden assessment had been fixed by jury or panchayat about 1836. No complaints had been made against it. It was moderate but very unequal, the acre rates varying from 4s. to 13s. 6d. (Rs. 2-6\u00bd). Lieutenant Wingate believed that in many cases the number of acres allotted to the gardens was underrated. On this account and to ensure greater equality of assessment as well as similarity of system in the newly settled sub-divisions, Lieutenant Wingate proposed the extension to this Sholapur sub-division of the plan adopted in Indapur, Mohol, and Madha. The plan originally proposed for Mohol-Madha differed in a slight degree from that carried into effect in Indapur, but as the modifications had not met with the approval of Government the Indapur system was adhered to. Every garden, whether previously taxed or not, was assessed at one uniform acre rate of 4s. (Rs. 2). The number of acres was adjusted to meet the difference in the supply of water and other circumstances affecting the value of the land for the purposes of irrigation. This settlement proved generally acceptable to the holders of gardens, and though the aggregate amount of the extra tax imposed was considerably over \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000) in the Mohol-Madha group, very few complaints were received. Lieutenant Wingate recommended that this plan should be adopted in the Sholapur subdivision. Lieutenant Wingate's proposals were sanctioned by Government in August 1840 and the settlement was introduced in 1840-41.\n\n---\n\n1 Lieutenant Wingate, Surv. Sept. 29th April 1840. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 210-211.\n2 Government Letter 2587 of 8th August 1840. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 220.\nIn 1840-41 the survey settlement was introduced into B\u00e1rsi. B\u00e1rsi lay to the north of Shol\u00e1pur separated from it by a narrow belt of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country. It was the level tract between the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t range of hills to the east and the Sina river to the west. The tract was of no great width and had a gentle south-west slope from the hills to the river. None of the streams which crossed it were of any considerable size. The Bhog\u00e1vati which had a course of forty miles from its source in the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t till it met the Sina at the village of Narkhed, was the most considerable. A few smaller streams in favourable seasons held running water during the greater part of the year and in some few villages their water was used for the land.\\(^1\\) Still B\u00e1rsi was on the whole better supplied with running streams than any other sub-division north of the Bh\u00edma. B\u00e1rsi was believed to have a better climate than the rest of Shol\u00e1pur owing to the nearness of the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t hills, which rose three to five hundred feet above the B\u00e1rsi plain. As regards markets also B\u00e1rsi was better placed than either Mohol or M\u00e1dha though it was not so well placed as Shol\u00e1pur. Almost the whole of its surplus produce was in the first instance disposed of at its own marts of B\u00e1rsi and Vair\u00e1g. Both were considered prosperous towns for the Deccan, though of late years eclipsed by the flourishing mart of Shol\u00e1pur.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn 1818, when it came under British management, the B\u00e1rsi sub-division was more flourishing than any other sub-division in Shol\u00e1pur.\\(^3\\) In 1840 Lieutenant Wingate held that under British management it had seriously deteriorated. The reason of this was that in spite of the fall of prices the attempt had been made to realize the same revenue as when prices were high. In 1818-19 nearly the whole arable land was under tillage, and for the first two years (1818-1820) every rupee of the assessment was collected. This extent of exaction proved excessive and was followed in the third year (1820-21) by a marked diminution of the cultivation. Still as prices continued good until 1821-22 the collections were made with punctuality. About this period prices began to fall rapidly. Still for several years the remissions granted were liberal and tillage continued to spread until it reached its greatest height in 1826-27; the collections rose to an unprecedented amount and were enormous, whether compared with those of preceding or of following years. This apparently flourishing state of things was, in Lieutenant Wingate\u2019s opinion, deceptive and disastrous in its consequences. He thought that in 1840 the sub-division was still\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lieutenant Wingate (16th September 1840) thought that the stream water supply might be better husbanded than at present in certain localities but the supply of water was too small to make any considerable extension in tillage possible.

A considerable decrease of cultivation and revenue immediately took place, and, with few and inconsiderable exceptions, the decline continued till 1835-36, when the revenue and the tillage were little more than one-half what they had been nine years before. About 1830 Mr. Pringle's settlement was introduced into B\u00e1rsi. During the ten years it remained in force the fluctuations of cultivation and revenue, excepting in the famine year of 1832-33, were comparatively small. Their average amount was lower than that of the preceding years of British management. From this Lieutenant Wingate inferred that Mr. Pringle's system was better than that which it supplanted, but was too burdensome to allow the sub-division to advance. During the ten years of Mr. Pringle's settlement the rate of assessment on the land in cultivation averaged more than 2s. (Re. 1) the acre, while in the preceding years the average acre rate was less than 2s. (Re. 1), and this was more especially remarkable in the first two years (1818-1820) when, with reference to the quantity of land in cultivation, the assessment was actually lower than it had ever since been. That is when the sub-division came into British possession and produce prices were high, the cultivators paid a lower acre rate than about 1840 when the value of produce had fallen about fifty per cent. From a mere comparison of the difference of assessment in money, no just conception of the actual weight of the land tax at the two different periods could be formed. The correct way to ascertain the weight of the land tax was to estimate the assessment on cultivated land in produce. Under Mr. Pringle's settlement the assessment on cultivated land, estimated in produce, was at least double what it had been when the subdivision came into British possession. More need not be said to account for the sub-division at one period having been flourishing with nearly the whole arable land under cultivation, and at the other depressed with one-half of its arable land waste. The increase of cultivation in 1839-40 was owing to extensive grants of waste land at short or ukti rates. The returns showed that during the twenty-two years ending 1839-40 the collections had varied from \u00a320,037 (Rs. 2,00,370) in 1826-27 to \u00a33988 (Rs. 39,880) in 1832-33.

Wingate, Surv. Supt. 16th Sept. 1840. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 334-335.\nThe survey diagram showed that twenty-two years before, when produce prices were about double what they were in 1840, B\u00e1rsi was flourishing, the cultivated land paying an average acre rate of 1s. 8\u00bdd. (13\u00bd as.); under Mr. Pringle's settlement it was much less prosperous, and in spite of the great fall in prices the average acre rate on the cultivated land was more than 2s. (Re. 1). From this Lieutenant Wingate argued that to ensure the restoration of the subdivision to its former prosperous condition, and to compensate for the great depreciation in the value of produce, the assessment ought to be fixed not only lower than Mr. Pringle's, but even much lower than that existing at the time of the British acquisition. The depreciation in the value of produce was probably not less than fifty per cent. On the other hand the landholder had formerly been subjected to several indirect cesses from which he was now relieved, while the security of his tenure was enhanced. For these reasons Lt. Wingate thought that an average rate of assessment higher than one-half of that which obtained at the time of acquisition might be imposed with safety. He also thought, from other considerations such as climate and position, that B\u00e1rsi could well bear rates of assessment equal to those of Sholapur that is thirty-three per cent higher than those introduced into Indapur. Calculations based on the assessment of several villages showed that at these rates the average acre charge would be 11\u00bdd. (7\u00bd as.) on the whole arable land, 248,000 acres, giving a highest dry-crop assessment of \u00a311,500 (Rs. 1,15,000), or, including the extra tax on watered land, a total rental of \u00a312,000 (Rs. 1,20,000). This new rental was \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) or four per cent less than the average collections \u00a312,500 (Rs. 1,25,000) on account of land revenue during the twenty-two years ending in 1840; \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) or 4\u00b735 per cent more than the collections of the eighteen years ending in 1840; and \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000) or 14\u00b728 per cent more than the collections of the twelve years ending in 1840. The immediate effect of the settlement was a reduction from \u00a310,600 (Rs. 1,06,000) in 1839-40 to \u00a38400 (Rs. 84,000) or 20\u00b775 per cent.\n\nThe existing garden settlement in B\u00e1rsi was, as in the Sholapur subdivision, a temporary arrangement. Lieutenant Wingate proposed to fix the extra water-cess on the B\u00e1rsi garden lands in the way that had been adopted in Mohol, M\u00e1dha, and Sholapur. In no subdivision of the district, as it was constituted in 1840, was the quantity of irrigated land at all considerable or one-fourth what it might easily be. It was of the utmost importance to fix a rate of assessment so moderate as to offer every encouragement to the extension of irrigation. The extra rate was intentionally low. At the same time in the subdivisions into which it had been introduced, it had been followed by so considerable an increase of irrigation that this low rate had on the whole increased the revenue from garden land. The irrigated land of B\u00e1rsi as of the rest of the collectorate was almost wholly well-watered. The channel-watered land was small.\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 336.\nin area and smaller in value. It depended on streams whose supply was sufficient or insufficient according to the abundance or the scarcity of the rainfall. In some seasons two garden crops were raised, in others only one, and occasionally water was so scarce that nothing could be grown. Under these conditions systematic garden husbandry was impossible, and the lands commanded by water-channels had almost no special value. Lieutenant Wingate had hitherto placed a small extra assessment on channel-commanded land with reference to the particular advantages of each field, and he proposed to follow a like course in the case of B\u00e1rsi. It was in reality of no importance what plan was followed, as the area of channel-watered or p\u00e1tasthal land was inconsiderable and there existed no probability of its ever being materially increased. The case of the well-watered garden land was very different. It was impossible to attach too much importance to the extension of well irrigation. So great were the facilities throughout the Sholapur collectorate of extending garden cultivation by sinking wells, that Lieutenant Wingate was (1840) satisfied that four times the present agricultural population might by this means be supported in ease and plenty, and the country in great measure freed from dependence on its extremely scanty and uncertain rainfall. Lieutenant Wingate's proposals were sanctioned by Government in November 1840.\n\nThe survey settlement was introduced into the Ropla petty division of Karm\u00e1la in 1842-43 and into the main division of Karm\u00e1la in 1843-44. In 1840-41 the area of the Ropla petty division was 125,030 acres. Of these 8446 acres were held free of rent and 11,667 were unarable, leaving 104,917 acres of arable rent-paying land. Of these about 74,000 acres were tilled and about 30,000 or thirty per cent, most of which was extremely poor, were waste. As the Ropla group lay only ten to twenty miles east of Ind\u00e1pur, the conditions of the two tracts were closely alike. The nearness of the eastern hills to the Ropla group made the late or September-November rainfall more certain and heavier than in Ind\u00e1pur. The late or rabi Ropla harvest was therefore always better. The kinds of produce, the qualities of soil, and the mode of tillage were precisely the same in Ropla as in Ind\u00e1pur. Bajri and jw\u00e1ri were the two chief grains, the proportion of bajri to jw\u00e1ri being as one to four. So entirely did the two millets form the staple crop that the lands left for the other grains seldom yielded more than was wanted for home use. In Ropla as in Ind\u00e1pur the soil was black and heavy along the rivers and brown and lighter near the central watershed. The heavy ten-bullock plough was common to both and the times of sowing and reaping were the same. In markets the difference was slight. Ropla had no market of any note. The price returns for Karm\u00e1la twelve miles north-west of Ropla and for Ind\u00e1pur showed that the Karm\u00e1la prices, apparently for Indian millet, were only about five per cent higher than the Ind\u00e1pur prices.\n\n---\n\n1 Lieutenant Wingate, Survey Superintendent, 16th September 1840, and Government Letter 3427 of 7th November 1840. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 329-342.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 428, 436-437, 444.\nThe Ropla villages had passed from the Niz\u00e1m to the British in 1821. In 1842 the people still looked back with horror on their state under the Niz\u00e1m. All was uncertain and oppressive. Their fields were given them at low rates, but if the crop promised well the rent was doubled or trebled. If the enhanced rates were not paid the crop was seized and the husbandmen thrown into confinement and punished. The people were wretched and much of the land was waste. In 1842 their condition was markedly better than the condition of the people of the neighbouring Niz\u00e1m\u2019s villages, which were mostly deserted and overgrown with brushwood, the few people being extremely wretched and poverty-stricken. In the Ropla villages most of the arable land was under tillage. The people though not well-to-do, were comparatively well off and were secure. They were not well-to-do because the assessment was too heavy. Liberal remissions had been granted, but the system of remissions had disadvantages. The crops had to be left uncut till their condition was examined. The examining clerk made the remissions small for fear he should be thought corrupt, and the testing officer made them smaller on the belief that the clerk was likely to be too lenient. The people were far from well-to-do. They lived on grain borrowed from time to time from the village V\u00e1n\u00ed to whom, with few exceptions, they were much in debt. They paid their rents with money borrowed from these V\u00e1nis at very high interest, and in return gave them all the produce of their fields at prices which, as the V\u00e1nis always combined together, were far below the market rates. Though in the hands of moneylenders, the people did not feel the pressure of poverty. Any of them who remained staunch to one V\u00e1n\u00ed always had his wants moderately supplied.\n\nThe returns show that in the Ropla villages during the nineteen years ending 1841 the tillage area varied from 41,655 acres in 1834-35 to 74,896 in 1840-41 and averaged 52,849 acres. The returns show that the group passed through three periods, five years of prosperity ending in 1826-27 with an average tillage area of 60,435 acres; nine years of depression ending in 1835-36 with an average tillage area of 44,533 acres; and five years of steady recovery, the tillage area rising from 46,884 acres in 1836-37 to 74,896 acres in 1840-41. During the first of these three periods (1822-1827) the collections varied from \u00a31629 (Rs. 16,290) in 1824-25 to \u00a34477 (Rs. 44,770) in 1826-27 and averaged \u00a33347 (Rs. 33,470); during the second period (1827-1836) the collections varied from \u00a31064 (Rs. 10,640) in 1829-30 to \u00a33647 (Rs. 36,470) in 1833-34 and averaged \u00a32274 (Rs. 22,740); during the five years ending 1840-41 the collections varied from \u00a32764 (Rs. 27,640) in 1838-39 to \u00a33578 (Rs. 35,780) in 1836-37 and averaged \u00a33159 (Rs. 31,590). The last four years 1837-1841, in consequence of very liberal remissions, combined an increase in tillage and a lowering of the demand. The details are:\n\n1 Mr. W. S. Price, Asst. Supt. 25th July 1842, Bom. Gov. Sel.CL. 432-433.\n2 Bom Gov. Sel. CL. 442.\nDuring the twenty years ending 1840-41 there had been two years of famine prices 1824-25 and 1832-33, in both of which at Ropla jv\u00e1ri sold at about 40 pounds (20 shers) the rupee. There was one year, 1822-23, of surprising cheapness jv\u00e1ri selling, if the returns are correct, at about 256 pounds (128 shers) the rupee. During the remaining seventeen years the rupee price of jv\u00e1ri varied from about 84 pounds (42 shers) in 1825-26 to about 160 pounds (80 shers) in 1828-29, 1830-31, 1834-35, and 1837-38, and averaged about 122 pounds (61 shers). During the five years ending 1840-41 the rupee price of jv\u00e1ri had varied from about 160 pounds (80 shers) in 1837-38 to about 104 pounds (52 shers) in 1839-40 and averaged about 130 pounds (65 shers). There seemed to be no sign of any general rise in prices. The details are:\n\nRopla Jv\u00e1ri Prices: Shers the Rupee, 1821-1841.\n\n| Year | Ropla | Kar-m\u00e1la | B\u00e1rsi | M\u00e1dha | Ind\u00e1-pur |\n|------|-------|----------|-------|-------|----------|\n| 1821-22 | 64 | 43 | 52 | 32 | 1831-32 |\n| 1822-23 | 128 | 54 | 48 | 80 | 32 | 1832-33 |\n| 1823-24 | 44 | 32 | 44 | 40 | 37 | 1833-34 |\n| 1824-25 | 20 | 15 | 16 | 13 | 18 | 1834-35 |\n| 1825-26 | 42 | 32 | 37 | 44 | 18 | 1835-36 |\n| 1826-27 | 55 | 48 | 48 | 44 | 64 | 1836-37 |\n| 1827-28 | 58 | 33 | 49 | 48 | 32 | 1837-38 |\n| 1828-29 | 50 | 51 | 56 | 68 | 80 | 1838-39 |\n| 1829-30 | 48 | 32 | 44 | 46 | 46 | 1839-40 |\n| 1830-31 | 80 | 50 | 42 | 48 | 10 | 1840-41 |\n\nLieutenant Nash the Survey Superintendent agreed with Mr. Price that the Ropla villages contrasted well with the neighbouring Niz\u00e1m\u2019s villages. At the same time the assessment was too high. The older assessment on which it was based, in Lieut. Nash\u2019s opinion,\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 443.\nhad been a nominal rather than an actual rental. How impossible it was to collect was shown by the fact that in the Karmala sub-division during the twenty years ending 1842, of an assessment of \u00a3290,000 (Rs. 29,00,000), \u00a3130,000 (Rs. 13,00,000) or about 45 per cent had to be remitted. In the last year (1841-42) of \u00a317,900 (Rs. 1,79,000) \u00a39160 (Rs. 91,600) or more than one-half of the demand had to be foregone. Though in the end the people might not be actually overassessed, a system of large remissions opened a wide door for fraud. So long as the district was kept prosperous only by the yearly grant of enormous remissions, Government must be the loser in all cases where bribes were successfully given to obtain special remissions. On the other hand landholders who did not bribe had their fields rated too highly, that the total amount of remissions might not be so high as to attract notice by the favour shown to those who paid for favour.\n\nAs the existing fields appeared in most cases to be at variance with Mr. Pringle's records all the land was remeasured. As in Indapur, the soil was divided into nine classes of different qualities. Mr. Price and Lieutenant Nash proposed for the Ropla group the same dry-crop rates as had been introduced into Madha which lay immediately to the south, that is an increase of five per cent over Indapur rates. For the garden land which yielded no very valuable crops, Mr. Price proposed acre rates of 4s., 3s., and 2s. (Rs. 2, Rs. 1\u00bd, and Re. 1) and Lieutenant Nash recommended that the one Indapur rate of 4s. (Rs. 2) the acre should be adopted. At the proposed dry-crop rates the assessment of 104,917 acres of arable land in the whole Ropla group amounted to \u00a33733 (Rs. 37,330) that is an average acre rate of 8\u00bdd. (5\u00bd as.). This was 3\u00bdd. (2\u00bd as.) less than the past average acre payment, and \u00bed. (\u00bc a.) less than the Indapur average, because the quantity of superior soils was greater in Indapur than in Ropla. Compared with \u00a33074 (Rs. 30,740) the sum collected for dry-crop land in 1840-41, the assessment on the same area at the new rates showed a reduction of \u00a3421 (Rs. 4210) or 13\u00b77 per cent. The total survey rental exceeded the average amount of the dry-crop collections of the previous nineteen years by \u00a31128 (Rs. 11,280) that is an increase of 43 per cent. Government sanctioned the rates proposed by Lieutenant Nash, in October 1842.\n\nAs has been noticed the survey settlement was introduced into the main Karmala group in 1843-44. This group was bounded on the north-west by Karjat in Ahmadnagar, on the east by the river Sina and the Nizam's territories, on the south by the Ropla group, and on the south-west by the river Bhima and Indapur. It comprised 196,204 acres of which 9680 were held free, 31,854 were\n\n---\n\n1 Lieutenant Nash, Survey Superintendent, 19th September 1842, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 424-425. These remarks apply to the Karmala sub-division generally.\n2 During the nineteen years ending 1840-41 the total survey rental \u00a33733 (Rs. 37,330) was exceeded only by the dry crop collections of 1826-27 which amounted to \u00a34286 (Rs 42,860). Mr. Price, 1842, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 438.\n3 Government Letter 3134 of 31st October 1842, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 449-450.\nunarable, and 154,670 were arable. The highway of traffic between Poona and the Haidarabad districts to the east of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills passed through this group, as did the highways from Ahmadnagar to Shol\u00e1pur and Pandharpur. Though there were no hills, much of the surface was rough and rocky. The Karm\u00e1la group included the whole of the V\u00e1ngi and parts of the old Shrigonda and Kadevalit sub-divisions. Of these groups, until they passed to the British in 1818, the villages of V\u00e1ngi had for sixteen years been held by Sad\u00e1shiv Pant M\u00e1nkeshvar. The Shrigonda and Kadevalit groups did not pass to the British till 1821. Except one year during which they had lapsed to the Niz\u00e1m, these groups had for upwards of 120 years formed part of the estate of the Nimb\u00e1lkar family. As landlords M\u00e1nkeshvar and Nimb\u00e1lkar had greatly differed. M\u00e1nkeshvar\u2019s demands were moderate and varied with the season. Nimbalkar, who was always pressed for funds to keep his troops, rackrented his people. In spite of the difference in management, when they came under the British, the condition of the two groups was almost equally wretched, as M\u00e1nkeshvar\u2019s efforts to improve his villages had been thwarted by the ravages of the Pendh\u00e1ris. Mr. Price was satisfied that the people had greatly improved under British management. One great difference between the state of the country under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and under the British was that under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s there was a large body of non-productive consumers. Their demand served to keep up the price of grain, and the crops found a ready market. Under the English, when almost all were producers, prices had fallen and crops were difficult to sell. This, by forcing Government to grant large remissions, caused them a serious loss of revenue. At the same time it was accompanied by one great advantage. In former times little grain was stored and in the famines of 1792-93 and 1803-4 the people died in masses. In 1842 there was enough grain in store to carry the people through a year of complete failure of crops. It was true that the stores of grain were in the V\u00e1nis\u2019 hands, and that the landholders lived by a ruinous system of borrowing. It was usual to lay the blame of the impoverished state of the people on the heavy assessment. This explanation, Mr. Price was satisfied, was only partly correct. In the Karm\u00e1la group the nominal assessment had not formed the basis of a single rent settlement. In the early years of British management low rate leases had been granted, and afterwards outstandings were allowed to stay over or be t\u0101hkub, or lands were given at short or ukti rates. During the twenty years ending 1842 not one-half of the nominal assessment had been levied. Applying the settlement rates which had been sanctioned for Ropla to the Karm\u00e1la villages, and deducting on account of waste land, Mr. Price found that they would yield about the same amount of revenue as what had actually been received by Government. He thought that the reason why the people had prospered so little under so moderate a demand was the\n\n---\n\n1 The satisfactory state of Karm\u00e1la, compared with other parts of Shol\u00e1pur, is partly due to the fact that it had belonged to Ahmadnagar and not to Poona.\ncorruption of the village officers. In spite of the increased independence of the people and the elaborate checks on fraud which had been introduced under British management, in 1842-43 Mr. Price knew that the villages had paid the village officers large sums to have their crops under-estimated. In former years the village officers never told the people what remissions had been granted, but continued to screw as much out of them as they could. As in Ropla, the Karmala returns for the twenty years ending 1841-42 show three periods, the five years ending 1826-27 a time of prosperity, with a tillage acreage varying from 117,667 in 1825-26 to 139,934 in 1823-24 and averaging 127,966; the ten years ending 1836-37 a time of depression, the tillage varying from 83,270 acres in 1835-36 to 110,848 in 1829-30 and averaging 94,174; and the five years ending 1841-42 a time of recovery, with tillage varying from 100,444 acres in 1837-38 to 143,796 in 1841-42 and averaging 128,741. The collections for the third period varied from \u00a33262 (Rs. 32,620) in 1839-40 to \u00a35728 (Rs. 57,280) in 1841-42 and averaged \u00a34286 (Rs. 42,860). Compared with what would have been taken had the Ropla rates been in force, the greatest excess was \u00a36424 (Rs. 64,240) in 1826-27 instead of \u00a34251 (Rs. 42,510). In four out of the twenty years, the amount taken was very much less than the amount which would have been due under the Ropla rates. The average for the whole period was almost the same, \u00a34116 (Rs. 41,160) of collections and \u00a34078 (Rs. 40,780) due under the Ropla rates.

CL. 468.\nof difference were that the fall of rain during the late crop or rabi season was more plentiful in Karmala than in Indapur and that its market was better. The greater fall of late crop rain was common to Karmala and Ropla. In the Ropla group the value of this better rainfall had been estimated at five per cent. Mr. Price proposed a corresponding increase of five per cent for the Karmala group and a further increase of five per cent because of Karmala\u2019s better market. At these rates the dry-crop assessment of the Government arable area amounted to \u00a36531 (Rs. 65,310) that is an average acre rate of about 10s.d. (6\u00bd as.). This compared with the average assessment during the twenty years ending 1841-42 showed a decrease of \u00a31710 (Rs. 17,100) or 20 per cent. Compared with the average collections of the same twenty years the survey rental showed an increase of \u00a32416 (Rs. 24,160) or 58 per cent, and compared with the average of the five years ending 1841-42 an increase of \u00a32245 (Rs. 22,450) or 52 per cent. The immediate effect of the settlement on the tillage area of 1841-42 was an increase from \u00a35728 (Rs. 57,280) to \u00a36075 (Rs. 60,750) or six per cent. For garden land Mr. Price proposed the Indapur or Ropla acre rate of 4s. (Rs. 2) at which the total garden assessment amounted to \u00a3266 (Rs. 2660).\u00b9\n\nIn July 1843, in submitting Mr. Price\u2019s report, Lieutenant Nash noticed that the cause of the cheapening of grain was not so much the increase of production, for tillage had spread but little. The cause was rather the stoppage of the flow of money which the Marathas used to bring from the greater part of India to the Deccan. It was not so much that there was more grain in the land as that there was less money. While agreeing with Mr. Price that the hoarding of large quantities of grain was likely to some extent to lighten the extreme pressure of famine, Mr. Nash pointed out that so long as the grain was in the hands of dealers and not in the hands of husbandmen, the gain was comparatively slight, because the people were thrown out of work by the stoppage of field labour and had no funds with which to buy the grain. Mr. Nash thought that in the case of the Karmala group Mr. Price was correct in holding that if the remission clerks had given the landholders the benefit of the amounts remitted, the people would not have suffered from over-assessment. He also agreed with Mr. Price that a large proportion of the remissions had never reached the landholders, or that, if they did, they had been obliged to pay heavily for them.\u00b2 Lieutenant Nash concurred in Mr. Price\u2019s rates both for dry-crop and for garden lands. Government sanctioned the proposed garden rate. As regards dry-crop they agreed with the Collector Mr. Stuart that the Ropla rates and not five per cent over the Ropla rates should be adopted. This deduction of five per cent from the estimated dry-crop rental reduced the amount from \u00a36075\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Price, Asst. Supt. 18th July 1843. Bom. Gov. Sel.

The reduced total represented a slight increase of \u00a344 (Rs. 440) or 0\u00b776 per cent above the dry-crop collections of 1841-42.\u00b9\n\nIn 1856-57 the survey settlement was introduced into seventy-one villages of the Pandharpur sub-division. At that time Pandharpur was in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. A group of seventy-one villages in the south and south-east was settled in the beginning and the remaining sixty-nine villages in the close of 1857. The first group included all the villages to the south of and the villages immediately to the north of the M\u00e1n river; the second group included all the remaining villages up to the river Bhima the northern and north-eastern boundary of Pandharpur. In the first group of seventy-one villages the climate was not favourable to tillage, the rainfall being both scanty and uncertain.\u00b2 As regarded moisture the villages in the south of the group were in a slight degree worse off than those in the north and north-east. The reason was that in the south villages rocky and shallow soils prevailed and the rain ran off instead of being absorbed and again given out to the atmosphere. Judging from the soil of its southern part, Pandharpur was an early or kharif crop district, the red and gray soils predominating so greatly as to reduce the black and heavy soils to a fraction of the whole. The eagerness with which black soils were sought, showed that the climate was more favourable to late or rabi tillage, and that these soils would bear a much heavier relative rate than they would in districts having a climate more favourable to the growth of early crops. Except those to the south all the surrounding districts had a larger supply of rain, and the rain in the south as far as Bij\u00e1pur was almost uniform with that which fell in the south and south-east villages of Pandharpur. A really good season in Pandharpur should have heavy rain in June followed by light continued showers during July August and September, and closing with heavy falls during October and the beginning of November. Such a season would secure both the early and the late harvest. It had not occurred within the fifteen years ending in 1857. During that period there were only two more than middling seasons, 1847-48 when there was a remarkably good early crop and 1851-52 when there was a specially heavy late crop.\u00b3 Of the crops which were the same as in Bij\u00e1pur, jv\u00e1ri, b\u00e1jri, cotton, and kardai, there was more of b\u00e1jri and less of kardai in Pandharpur than in Bij\u00e1pur. When any important purchases or sales had to be made, the markets of Shol\u00e1pur and Pandharpur were resorted to. The ordinary markets available for the people of South Pandharpur were at S\u00e1ngola, Mangalvedha, N\u00e1zre, J\u00e1vl\u00ed, and Jath. Of these S\u00e1ngola, Mangalvedha, and Jath were more lively than the others. Jath had also the advantage of\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Letter 3302 of 12th October 1843, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 475-477.\n\u00b2 In point of rainfall and general circumstances the south of Pandharpur was very similar to the north of Bij\u00e1pur in Kal\u00e1dgi and of Athni in Belgaum. Pandharpur was separated from Bij\u00e1pur and Athni by about four miles of alienated or j\u00e1gir land. Capt. W. C. Anderson, 20 of 17th January 1857.\n\u00b3 Mr. W. S. Price, Asst, Supt. Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, January 1857.\nbeing a cattle-market and was resorted to when the poorer class of cattle had to be bought or sold. The places to buy good cattle at were Shol\u00e1pur, Pandharpur, and above all B\u00e1rsi, which was the chief cattle-market in the whole country. Shol\u00e1pur was the greatest general market with a sure and profitable outlet for produce and special facilities for buying. The surplus supply of millets found so ready a sale in the west and south that it had seldom to be sent to the Konkan. Large quantities of kardai or safflower oil were taken to the south and west even as far as the Konkan where it found a ready sale and the cotton was carried to the coast for shipment to Bombay. The landholders had no share in the carrying trade. They sold the produce to the local moneylender, who either himself exported it or handed it to an outside dealer who moved about the country gathering grain. Enough coarse blankets and cotton cloth were made to meet the local demand. There was no export. There were many mills or gh\u00e1n\u00e1s for pressing the kardai oilseed, the chief being at Kaut\u00e1li an alienated village on the Bhima.\n\nPandharpur did not pass to the British till 1848 when the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra state lapsed. The rates of assessment at the time of the survey had been long in force. The assessment was pitched at so high a standard that large permanent reductions were required to induce husbandmen to keep their old lands or to take up new. These reductions were ostensibly made to equalize the assessment, but as they were on no systematic plan and rather with an eye to the influence or means of the cultivator than to the capabilities of the land, the pressure of the permanent assessment had become more unequal than ever. Influential village officers and landholders secured large reductions when no reduction was wanted, while the poorer husbandmen were tempted by the levy of only nominal rates to hold lands which they had not stock enough to till properly, trusting, if the crop failed, that they would be allowed a remission even of the little revenue they had engaged to pay. By this means the Government treasury failed to recover its dues, a large part of the cultivating classes was kept impoverished, and the productive powers of the district were impaired by the loss of the labour of the large class of pauper husbandmen, who, tempted by the nominal rent, derived a bare subsistence by cultivating on their own account in place of living on the wages of labour. Notwithstanding the large permanent reduction of assessment, every year large remissions were required on account of the failure of crops, the failures being in part due to the deficiency of rain but to a greater extent to imperfect tillage.\u00b9 The returns for this south-east and south Pandharpur group for the ten years ending 1856 show a tillage area varying from 161,366 acres in 1846-47 to 169,563 in 1851-52 and averaging 166,400, and collections varying from \u00a34650 (Rs. 46,500) in 1848-49 to \u00a36361 (Rs. 63,610) in 1846-47 and averaging \u00a35728 (Rs. 57,280). The details are:\n\n\u00b9 Capt. W. C. Anderson, Surv., Supt. 20 of 17th January 1857.\nAs a class the landholders were badly off. Very few were free from debt, and still fewer had the means of cultivating their fields properly. This was partly due to the very unfavourable climate and partly to the laziness of the people who in this respect were a marked contrast to the people to the south of the Krishna. In fixing the rates to be paid by the seventy-one villages of the group, they were divided into five classes with highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 1s. 10\u00bdd. to 1s. 1\u00bdd. (15-9 as.). Six villages on the Bhima closer than any others to the great markets of Sholapur and Pandharpur were charged 1s. 10\u00bdd. (15 as.). Eight villages near the first class, but somewhat less favourably placed as regards markets, were charged 1s. 9d. (14 as.). Twenty-six villages, still worse placed than the second class, were charged a highest acre rate of 1s. 6d. (12 as.). Twenty-three villages in the south of the sub-division and less favourably situated as regards markets and climate were charged 1s. 3\u00bed. (10\u00bd as.). And eight villages in the south-east of the sub-division, in all respects the worst of the whole, were charged 1s. 1\u00bdd. (9 as.). Water was nowhere at any great distance from the surface, and many villages had a considerable area of well-watered garden land. The average revised well-water acre rate was estimated at 3s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd). The rate was low, but a low rate was required to encourage well-cultivation which was so necessary in so dry a district. A low rate was also necessary because water was easily procured, and, as no special water rate was to be charged on lands watered from wells built after the survey, if the rate on the old wells was not low, they would fall out of use. The estimated effect of the new rates was to raise the assessment from \u00a36108 (Rs. 61,080) to \u00a37882 (Rs. 78,820), an increase of twenty-nine per cent. The details are:\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. W. S. Price, Assistant Superintendent, January 1857.\n2 The survey rates introduced in the neighbouring districts were: in the main body of Athni highest dry-crop acre rates of 12 as. and 14 as.; in the northern villages of Bijapur a highest dry-crop acre rate of 8 as. The M\u0101dh\u0101 rates agreed with the Pandharpur rates, though the method of classing and rating in that sub-division was a little different from that pursued in the Southern Maratha Country Survey. Capt. Anderson, 20 of 17th January 1857.\nCaptain Anderson was of opinion that under the new rates the tillage area would at first be somewhat reduced. Pauper cultivators, no longer able to hold land on nominal rates, would take to labour as a means of subsistence, a change which in Captain Anderson's opinion would be most advantageous both to themselves and to the community. The assessment on superior land would be nearly everywhere reduced, and some of the better class of waste would be brought under tillage. It was specially easy to extend irrigation in Pandharpur. Water was everywhere near the surface, and it was thought that new wells would be sunk in all directions. The M\u00e1n river, a tributary of the Bhima, flowed through the group. Dams might be thrown across it at intervals at no great expense, and a sufficient head of water obtained to irrigate a large area of land and in great measure to secure the people from the frequent disastrous effects of a short rainfall. Government sanctioned the proposed survey rates in February 1857.\n\nIn 1857-58 the survey settlement was introduced into the remaining sixty-nine villages of Pandharpur and into twenty-seven villages of the N\u00e1teputa petty division of Khat\u00e1v in S\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1. The climate of such of these Pandharpur villages as lay to the east of the parallel of Bh\u00e1lavni was much the same as that of the villages settled in the previous year. West of the parallel of Bh\u00e1lavni an improvement in climate began and rapidly increased. The improvement in climate was all in favour of the early or kharif crops, which, owing to the nature of the soil, were widely grown particularly in the villages of the N\u00e1teputa group. This better rainfall had the effect of enhancing the relative value of the poorer soils. Over the whole Pandharpur sub-division the rainfall was scanty, though the want of moisture was somewhat less felt in the extreme north than in the centre. Several villages had a few weavers of coarse cloth, the produce of whose looms was entirely used to meet the local demand. In the north of the sub-division numerous Dhangars or shepherds had large flocks of sheep, whose wool was made into blankets which were sent to the Konkan in considerable quantities.\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Letter 869 of 21st February 1857.\n2 Mr. Price, 28th Nov. 1857; Capt. Anderson, 422 of 10th Dec. 1857.\nThe people in the north were generally better off than those in the south, chiefly because they were nearer to large markets. In every village there were a few well-to-do landholders, and in consequence of frauds in shifting boundaries and in getting their lands entered at unduly low rates, the village headmen and clerks were often rich. The agriculture was very slovenly, as exceedingly low rates had tempted many to hold more land than they had stock to cultivate. The whole of the survey group was well off for markets. The villages near the large town of Pandharpur were specially well off, and several second-class markets were within and near the edge of this survey group, Bh\u00e1lavni, Akli\u00faj, Vel\u00e1pur, Mhasvad, and N\u00e1teputa. The large markets of Ind\u00e1pur and Phaltan were not many miles distant. The railroad, which was being made between Poona and Shol\u00e1pur, passed within some twenty miles of the northern boundary of Pandharpur; and, besides the made road from Pandharpur to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra which passed through the centre of this group, to the north was a much used cart track from Pandharpur to Poona.\n\nThis group of sixty-nine north Pandharpur villages and twenty-seven N\u00e1teputa villages had therefore a decided advantage over the southern group which had been settled in the previous year. During the ten years ending in 1857 in the sixty-nine Pandharpur villages tillage had varied from 215,803 acres in 1855-56 to 222,954 acres in 1850-51 and averaged 219,163 acres, and collections had varied from \u00a35204 (Rs. 52,040) in 1849-50 to \u00a37322 (Rs. 73,220) in 1854-55 and averaged \u00a36615 (Rs. 66,150). In twenty-six of the N\u00e1teputa villages tillage had varied from 50,490 acres in 1849-50 to 64,087 acres in 1856-57 and averaged 59,199 acres, and collections had varied from \u00a31293 (Rs. 12,930) in 1849-50 to \u00a32481 (Rs. 24,810) in 1847-48 and averaged \u00a31960 (Rs. 19,600).\n\nThe details are:\n\n**Pandharpur-N\u00e1teputa Tillage and Revenue, 1847-1857.**\n\n| Year | 69 Pandharpur Villages | 26 N\u00e1teputa Villages |\n|------|------------------------|---------------------|\n|      | Acres | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. | Acres | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. |\n| 1847-48 | 218,893 | 2073 | 87,651 | 71,969 | 67,037 | ... | 21,061 | 24,814 |\n| 1848-49 | 219,112 | 9159 | 85,467 | 64,808 | 50,072 | 2689 | 20,926 | 18,539 |\n| 1849-50 | 220,425 | 21,904 | 89,152 | 52,037 | 50,490 | 6396 | 22,705 | 12,627 |\n| 1850-51 | 221,062 | 21,418 | 89,317 | 52,128 | 50,628 | 6292 | 22,625 | 11,555 |\n| 1851-52 | 221,162 | 17,637 | 92,018 | 55,752 | 61,915 | 2387 | 27,944 | 18,143 |\n| 1852-53 | 221,742 | 4033 | 91,698 | 70,778 | 62,765 | 1093 | 27,104 | 21,477 |\n| 1853-54 | 217,734 | 8569 | 89,243 | 65,000 | 62,188 | 1866 | 25,942 | 21,228 |\n| 1854-55 | 217,091 | 982 | 88,929 | 73,222 | 62,477 | 629 | 24,832 | 23,877 |\n| 1855-56 | 215,803 | 7421 | 88,838 | 67,298 | 63,329 | 4066 | 25,881 | 19,617 |\n| 1856-57 | 216,716 | 4107 | 88,903 | 71,925 | 64,087 | 3918 | 25,778 | 21,280 |\n\nAverage | 219,163 | 8312 | 89,561 | 66,152 | 59,199 | 3034 | 24,454 | 19,696 |\n\nThe sixty-nine Pandharpur villages were arranged in four classes and charged highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 2s. 3d. to 1s. 9d.

In the fourth class were placed sixteen villages which lay to the south of the third class villages and immediately to the north of the villages assessed at 1s. 6d. (12 as.) in the previous year. These sixteen villages were charged a rate of 1s. 9d. (14 as.) because they were similarly situated with those assessed at the same rate in the previous year. Of garden land there were 5000 acres. Little sugarcane was grown; wheat and vegetables were the chief garden crops. The average garden rate was estimated at 3s. 9d. (Rs. 1\u00bd), and the highest rate was proposed at 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd). The result of the survey settlement was an increase in the rental on tillage from \u00a37192 to \u00a39258 (Rs. 71,920 to Rs. 92,580) or 28 per cent.

(Re. 1) for nineteen villages, and 1s. 10\u00bdd. (15 as.) for eight villages immediately under the hills in a broken country and somewhat less favourably placed for traffic than the first class. These twenty-seven N\u00e1teputa villages had upwards of 2000 acres of garden land.

This group had a marked advantage in nearness to great markets and means of communication with them, with further advantages in prospect at no distant day on the opening of the rail road. The Khatav sub-division was generally separated from Pandharpur by the Mah\u00e1dev hills, Khatav being above the gh\u00e1ts on the table land and Pandharpur below. The twenty-seven villages of the N\u00e1teputa group for settlement comprised that part of the Khatav sub-division which was below the gh\u00e1ts and naturally belonged rather to Pandharpur than to Khatav, from which they were divided by the highest part of the Mah\u00e1dev range; they were situated immediately to the west of the northern part of Pandharpur, and had the same boundary to the north, the river Bhima.\n9d.

Since the survey in 1840 many territorial changes had taken place. The 1871 M\u00e1dha included forty Government and two double-owned or dum\u00e1la villages of the old M\u00e1dha group, thirty-one Government and five double-owned or dum\u00e1la villages of the old Mohol group, and eleven Government villages of the Karm\u00e1la group, or a total of eighty-nine villages. This modern M\u00e1dha group was of irregular shape. It was bounded on the north-west by the river Bhima, on the east by the river Sina though five villages to the east of this river were included in the sub-division, on the south by Shol\u00e1pur, and on the west by Pandharpur. Its greatest length from north-west to south-east was about forty miles and it varied in breadth from twenty-five to thirty miles in the north to eighteen or twenty in the south. According to the new survey the area amounted to 390,322 acres of which 339,947 acres were arable, 22,565 unarable, 11,330 meadow or g\u00e1yr\u00e1n, and 16,480 alienated. The sub-division was a bare waving almost treeless plain, the tops of the low rolling downs often covered with stunted yellow spear grass, a sure sign of barren soil. The watershed passed north-west to south-east through the greatest length of the sub-division; its streams flowed east into the Sina and south into the Bhima which at no point was many miles distant from the south-western boundary. None of these streams were of any size owing to the low elevation at which they took their rise and the shortness of their courses. Except the Bhend none of them continued to flow throughout the year.\n\n---\n\n1 Of the twenty-seven villages for settlement, the papers of one village were not received by the Survey Superintendent at the time of his report (December 1857). This one village was therefore entirely excluded from the statement.\n2 Gov. Letter 265 of 21st January 1858.\n3 Mr. Grant, Surv. Supt. 40 of 12th Jan. 1871; Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 5.46, 107-132.\n4 The 10,968 acres of irrigable land, which was almost entirely under wells, was only 3\u00b722 per cent of the total arable area, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 118.\nBhend rose near Kem in Karmala and emptied itself into the Sina a little to the north of the village of Undargaon. The belt to the east of the Sina was nowhere of any considerable breadth, while Madha did not pass far enough west to include any of the Bhima plain. The greatest portion of Madha consisted of comparatively high land whose soil was generally shallow though it varied much both in depth and quality. The villages along the Sina formed the richest part of the Madha subdivision and were mostly of black soil, of great depth, and of excellent quality. During the five years ending 1869 the rainfall varied from 12'96 inches in 1865 to 29'95 in 1867. A large share of the Madha rainfall was late in the season. The late harvest was therefore the chief harvest representing 76 per cent of the whole outturn.\n\nIn 1839 when the original survey settlement was introduced the group was supposed to be suffering from over-assessment. The rates were therefore fixed with the view of granting substantial relief. They caused a reduction in the revenue from \u00a314,100 to \u00a311,600 (Rs.1,41,000 to Rs.1,16,000) or 17 per cent. Since the 1840 settlement a great advance had been made in communications. There was not a mile of made road in 1839. Since then the railway had been opened passing along the northern boundary of the group with three stations within its limits, Mohol, Madha, and Barsi Road. The Sholapur Pandharpur and Satara road passed through the south of the sub-division and the old Sholapur-Poona road through its centre. In addition to these there was a cross road from Barsi to the Barsi Road station which was continued to Tembhorni. All the villages except four or five in the rocky west had every facility for getting rid of their produce. As regards markets Madha was also particularly well placed. With a few exceptions on the north-west corner no village was more than four or five miles from a market. These local markets were small\n\n---\n\n1 In 1865, 12'96 inches; 1866, 19'58; 1867, 29'95; 1868, 14'64; and 1869, 22'01. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 118.\n\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 7, 61. The Survey Superintendent Mr. Grant wrote (Jan. 1871): \"A recent article in the Indian Economist attributes the terrible depression which marked the agriculture of the country some thirty or forty years back, not to over-assessment, to which the revenue officers of the day ascribed it, but to the contraction of the currency of the country (under the exactions of foreign rule) and to the continuous fall in the price of produce that resulted from it. Whatever may have been the real cause of the depression which is admitted to have existed then, the only remedy which lay in the hands of the revenue officers was to reduce the assessment which under the existing circumstances was higher than the people could pay. This was accordingly done, and the very low rates fixed have continued in force till now. A few years after the introduction of these rates the real cause of depression, according to the Economist, was removed by the influx of bullion into the country, consequent on the discovery of the gold fields of California in 1847, followed almost immediately by those of Australia. 'The gold fields,' says the Economist, 'set the industry of the world in motion. It was discovered in the Crimean war that India could grow oil-seeds as well as Russia, and the moment that a stream of silver in payment of these new exports was directed upon the thirsty land, the landholders' emancipation came. We heard no more complaints of over-assessment or outstanding balances.' The correctness of this view is apparently borne out by the returns of cultivation and the prices of produce in this district for the last thirty years.\" Mr. Grant, Surv. Supt. 40 of 12th January 1871, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 7-8.\nbecause of the nearness of Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, Karkam, and Tembhurni, where better prices drew the bulk of the produce. There were ten market villages, M\u00e1dha, Laul, Ashti, Narkhed, Uplai Budrukh, Angar, Kurdu, Mohol, P\u00e1tkul, and Kurul, and two, Karkam and Tembhurni, close beyond the border. M\u00e1dha had formerly been the chief local market, but trade was said to have left it to avoid certain municipal dues.\\(^1\\) In 1871 Mohol was the most largely attended market, and there was a very useful and yearly increasing market at the B\u00e1rsi Road station. Tempted by the favourable terms at which cotton could be bought, a small band of V\u00e1nis had settled at B\u00e1rsi Road and built a large rest-house for their caste people who came to trade. Goods met with a ready sale, though there was no particular market day. Weaving was the only manufacture of any importance in this survey group. There were weavers in about twenty villages, the chief of which were Narkhed, B\u00e1rloni, P\u00e1tkul, and Bembla. Both cotton cloth and woollen blankets were made but the quality was inferior and the demand was purely local.\n\nCompared with the jv\u00e1ri rupee prices at M\u00e1dha\\(^2\\) during the ten years ending 1839, the average during the ten years ending 1869 showed an increase from about 124 to 50 pounds (62 - 25 shers) or about 150 per cent.\\(^3\\)\n\nAccording to the former survey the seventy-seven villages brought under the revision settlement contained 269,587 acres of arable land which were assessed at a rental of \u00a310,058 (Rs. 1,00,580).

Then a decline set in and in 1845-46 both tillage and revenue had gone back almost to the point at which they stood in 1839-40. After 1845-46 cultivation soon went up to 250,000 acres, and, with slight fluctuations, remained at about that amount till 1858-59 which was the twentieth year of the lease. The area under tillage in 1858-59 was 251,200 acres and the realized revenue \u00a39738 (Rs. 97,380). At the close of 1857-58 about 18,000 acres of arable land assessed at \u00a3580 (Rs. 5800) were still waste. In the five years ending 1863 this waste had been taken and during the five years ending 1869 the whole assessed area was held for tillage. In 1871 the waste arable area was 170 acres assessed at \u00a35 (Rs. 50).

Remissions amounted to Rs. 8000 in 1839-40, Rs. 13,000 in 1845-46, Rs. 2000 in 1846-47, and Rs. 4000 in 1853-54. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 8-9.\n\nB 125-43\nIn 1839-40 of 1282 wells 190 were out of repair. During the survey lease ninety-eight wells were repaired and put in working order and 861 new wells were sunk, making in 1870 a total of 2051 working wells. As in Indapur these improvements kept pace with the increase of capital. During the first ten years of the survey lease only fifty-seven wells were made, during the next ten years 214 were made, and in the last ten years 590. Assuming as in Indapur that each well cost about \u00a340 (Rs. 400) and each old well was repaired at a cost of \u00a315 to \u00a317 10s. (Rs. 150 - 175), during the thirty years' survey lease more than \u00a335,000 (Rs. 3,50,000) had been spent on wells. The people had also contributed over \u00a3700 (Rs. 7000) towards building village offices or chavdis and rest-houses or dharmshalas. The sale price of dry-crop land, which in 1839 was almost nothing, during the settlement, as is shown later on, rose to twelve to fifteen years' purchase, or taking the assessment at about one lakh of rupees in 1870 the property in land represented \u00a3150,000 or fifteen laks of rupees. During the thirty years of the survey lease population had advanced from 64,195 to 80,676 or 26 per cent; farm bullocks from 24,793 to 28,490 or 15 per cent; carts from 435 to 1323 or 204 per cent; and ploughs from 1758 to 2423 or 38 per cent; other cattle had decreased from 66,345 to 59,193 or 11 per cent.\n\nIn 1871 the dry-crop tillage was lax and careless, though not perhaps more careless than in the neighbouring parts of the Deccan. The land was never ploughed more than once in three or four years and little or no attention was paid to any rotation in the raising of crops. Mr. Fletcher thought this careless tillage was not due to a want of cattle as the returns showed one ox to every 11\u00bd acres while in Nariad one of the most highly tilled parts of the Presidency the proportion was one ox to nine acres. Mr. Grant the Survey Superintendent was of opinion that the slovenly tillage was due to the low assessment which since the rise in prices represented a very small proportion of the outturn. The result of the very low rates was that the people took large areas of land and worked them carelessly.\n\n---\n\n1 Forty-five offices or chavdis were built at a cost of Rs. 7869 of which Government paid Rs. 3048 and the people Rs. 4821; and twenty-one rest-houses or dharmshalas were built at a cost of Rs. 6932 of which Rs. 4275 were paid by Government and Rs. 2657 by the people. Of the total cost of Rs. 14,831 Government paid Rs. 7323 and the people Rs. 7508. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 10.\n\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel.

But the number of people to the square mile of arable area was (1866) 119 in Indapur and (1869) 146 in Madha. Bom.-Gov. Sel. CL. 11.\n\n4 Considering the large expansion of tillage this increase of only 15 per cent in farm cattle is less than might have been expected. This scarcity of cattle was doubtless in some measure the reason of the slovenly and lax cultivation noticed in the text. Mr. Grant, Surv. Supt. 1871, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 11, and Lieut.-Col. Francis, Surv. Comr. 1871, Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 113.\n\n5 Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 8-9.\n\n6 In support of his view that the extreme lightness of the rates had favoured a slovenly style of tillage, Mr. Grant quoted the following sentences from McCulloch:\n\n\"It is difficult to say whether the over or under renting of land be most injurious. If a farm be too high-rented, that is if no exertion of skill or reasonable outlay on the part of the tenant will enable him to pay his rent and obtain a fair return for his...\"\nnant Colonel Francis did not agree with Mr. Grant that the careless tillage was due to the low rates. Colonel Francis thought the chief cause of the slovenly tillage was the uncertain and insufficient rainfall. Until rain fell the ground was so hard that it could not be worked and when rain fell the object was not to work a small plot of ground elaborately but to loosen as much of the surface as possible before it again dried. The difficulty was increased by the small number of cattle. That the slovenliness was not due to laziness, he thought, was shown by the care with which the garden lands which had a certain supply of water were tilled. In suitable places, as in the village of Kurul on the Sholapur-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road and in the villages on the B\u00e1rsi road, the people showed their willingness to work by their zeal in developing the cart traffic.\n\nIn 1869-70 in the eighty-eight surveyed villages of M\u00e1dha the proportion of the tilled area which was under the different crops was of the khar\u00edf or early crops, b\u00e1jri 18\u00b78 per cent, rice 1\u00b71 per cent, tobacco 0\u00b75 per cent, sugarcane 0\u00b76 per cent, matki 1\u00b76 per cent, and kulthi 0\u00b75 per cent, total 23\u00b71 per cent; and of the rabi or late crops jv\u00e1ri 54\u00b77 per cent, wheat 1\u00b71 per cent, gram 1\u00b76 per cent, cotton 9\u00b74 per cent, linseed 0\u00b75 per cent, miscellaneous 8 per cent, and fallow 1\u00b76 per cent, total 76\u00b79 per cent. The areas under the different crops were rice 3541 acres, sugarcane 1770 acres, jv\u00e1ri 185,909 acres, tobacco 1770 acres, wheat 3541 acres, gram 5312 acres, b\u00e1jri 63,740 acres, cotton 31,870 acres, linseed 1771 acres, matki 5312 acres, kulthi 1770 acres, miscellaneous crops 28,329 acres, and fallow 5312 acres, total 339,947 acres. There were 88,880 people lodged in 18,243 houses; 3319 wells, 2439 for watering, 148 for drinking, and 732 out of repair; 1375 carts; 2669 ploughs; 6144 milch and young buffaloes; 17,492 cows; 31,787 plough oxen; 1826 buffaloes; 39,115 sheep; and 1727 horses.\n\nThere were 7625 distinctly recorded kh\u00e1t\u00e1s or holdings; the average area of each holding was 46 acres; the average number of husbandmen to each holding was 1\u00b78; the average area of cultivation to each head of the total population was four acres and for each head of the agricultural population twenty-five acres; the average area to each plough, 133 acres; the average assessment on each holding \u00a32 14s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 27\u00bd). The population was 148\u00bd to the square mile of the total area and 161\u00bd to the square mile of the arable area; the realizable assessment was 4s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 2 4\u00bd).\n\ntrouble, he gets dispirited. The farm is in consequence ill managed, scourging crops are resorted to, and ultimately it is thrown on the landlord's hands in an impoverished and deteriorated condition. But the disadvantages attending the under-renting of land are hardly less obvious. To make farmers leave those routine practices to which they are very strongly attached and become really industrious and enterprising, they must not only have the power of rising in the world, but their rent must be such as to impress them with a conviction that if they do not exert themselves their ruin will assuredly follow. Estates that are under-rented are, uniformly almost, farmed in an inferior style compared with those that are let at their fair value, and the tenants are not generally in good circumstances.\"\n\n1 Bom.

(Rs. 343 as. 12\u00bd) to the square mile of the whole area. The survey kum\u00e1l or total assessment on waste and arable lands, deducting the value of alienations, was \u00a339 2s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 391 as. 2\u00bd) to the square mile of arable area and \u00a334 7s. 8\u00bdd. (Rs. 343 as. 13\u00bd) to the square mile of the total area.\n\nIn contrast to their state in 1839, in 1871 the bulk of the people were prosperous and independent. The only exception was the holders of land whose payments were less than \u00a31 (Rs. 10), who, from the Hindu rule of dividing property, had been left with a share of land which was not large enough for their support. In bad seasons these small holders suffered considerably. Since the 1839 settlement the value of land had greatly risen. In 1839 dry-crop land had no sale value nor could money be raised on its security. Mortgages were granted on garden and private or in\u00e1m lands; but Lieutenant Wingate was unable to find a single recent case of a price being given for the privilege of occupying Government dry-crop land. As a contrast to the above Mr. Grant notices that when he was in M\u00e1dha in 1870, in the village of M\u00e1dha eighteen acres of land assessed at \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18) and containing two wells one built and one half-built, sold for \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), and two dry-crop or jir\u00e1yat numbers containing 3\u00be acres assessed at 3s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00be) sold for \u00a33 (Rs. 30); in the village of D\u00e1rphal four acres assessed at 6s. (Rs. 3) sold for \u00a33 (Rs. 30); and in the village of Pads\u00e1li 23 acres assessed at \u00a31 (Rs. 10) in which a well had lately been built were bought by the village V\u00e1ni for \u00a335 (Rs. 350), and he refused to part with the field though he was offered \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000). This was an exceptional case. The ordinary sale value for dry crop land varied from twelve to fifteen years' purchase.\n\nAs the waste lands had not been measured in Mr. Pringle's survey, a fresh measurement was required. This showed that the area under tillage was 35,600 acres in excess of the area on which assessment was paid, representing a yearly loss to Government of about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). It was also found advisable to reclass the land. In 1839-40 the Mohol group was assessed at ten per cent and the M\u00e1dha group at five per cent above the Ind\u00e1pur rates. At the close of the thirty years' lease there was no material difference between the Mohol and the M\u00e1dha prices. The tract had been so opened by roads and by the railway that their position as regards markets was precisely the same. Mr. Grant therefore proposed a general highest dry-crop acre rate of 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) for the whole group and a special rate of 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bc) for fifteen villages within five miles of the railway stations of Mohol M\u00e1dha and\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov.

There was even less difference in baj\u00edri. During the ten years ending 1849 baj\u00edri was 2 per cent dearer at M\u00e1dha than in Mohol; during the ten years ending 1859 it was 3\u00bd per cent cheaper; and during the ten years ending 1869 it was 2\u00bd per cent cheaper.\nB\u00e1rsi Road. For seventy-seven villages whose thirty years' lease had expired or was soon to expire, the effect of the revised settlement was (January 1871) an increase of 77 per cent. In spite of this large addition the average acre rate was only 1s. 2d. (9\u00bd as.). No extra assessment was placed on well garden lands, the highest acre rate for which was the same as for first class dry-crop lands. Government sanctioned the proposed rates. They approved the principle of laying no extra cess on well-watered lands. They ordered that the highest dry-crop rate should be imposed only on such of these lands as were formerly subjected to extra well-assessment and not on lands watered from wells sunk during the survey lease. They observed that it was of the utmost importance to give every encouragement to the sinking of wells in a tract whose rainfall was so light and uncertain. Any applications which might be made for advances for well-sinking would meet with favourable consideration.\n\nIn 1871-72 the revised survey settlement was introduced into Shol\u00e1pur. At the time of the revision the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division included 150 villages. Of these 112 Government and two alienated villages belonged to the original Shol\u00e1pur sub-division; nine were villages of the Nip\u00e1nikar's which had lapsed to Government since the former survey; fifteen Government villages and one alienated village had been transferred from the old Mohol sub-division; and eleven villages had been received from the Niz\u00e1m. The revised settlement was introduced into 147 of the Government and one of the alienated villages. The total area of the 135 Government villages included in the survey diagrams was 789 square miles or 504,080 acres, and the number of inhabitants 135,710 or 172 to the square mile. At Shol\u00e1pur during the eighteen years ending 1870 the rainfall had varied from 13\u00b765 inches in 1855 to 35\u00b778 inches in 1869, and averaged 26\u00b75 inches.\n\n---\n\n1 Of the 82 Government villages five were settled in 1856-58.

One of the chief changes which had taken place during the thirty years of the survey lease was the opening of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway connecting Shol\u00e1pur with the eastern and western shores of the continent of Hindust\u00e1n. As Shol\u00e1pur was the only railway station within the subdivision, it, as in 1840, continued the chief market for local produce. Besides the railway, during the survey lease many roads had been opened. Among these the chief were to Poona, Haidarabad, Pandharpur, Akalkot, and Bij\u00e1pur. So great an impulse had been given to traffic that during the thirty years the number of carts had risen from 219 to 1167 or 433 per cent and during the seven years ending 1870-71 the tolls had yielded a revenue varying from \u00a31562 (Rs. 15,620) in 1867-68 to \u00a32145 (Rs. 21,450) in 1866-67, and averaging \u00a31814 (Rs. 18,140).\u00b9 There were public ferries on the Sina at L\u00e1mboti, Tirha, Vadakb\u00e1l, and V\u00e1ngi; and on the Bhima at Ghodeshvar, T\u00e1kli, and Bandarkanta. The farm of these ferries during the five years ending 1871 averaged \u00a3339 8s. (Rs. 3394). In the Shol\u00e1pur cantonment during the seven years ending 1871 ju\u00e1ri rupee prices had ranged from 28 pounds in 1864-65 to 51 in 1868-69 and averaged 38, and b\u00e1jri from 21 to 54 pounds and averaged 33 pounds.\u00b2\n\nDuring the survey lease in 135 Government villages the average yearly tillage increased from 345,620 acres during the ten years ending 1851 to 355,620 acres during the ten years ending 1861, and to 379,490 during the ten years ending 1871.

During the thirty years' lease 213 or nearly one-fifth of the wells then at work had fallen into disrepair; seventy-five of the old wells had been repaired and 537 new wells built of which 298 or nearly three-fifths had been made during the ten years ending 1870. The result was an increase in working wells of 395 or 35\u00b73 per cent. In January 1872 the great Ekruk lake had been completed about three miles to the north of Sholapur. Of other public works during the lease sixty-two village offices or chavdis and thirteen rest-houses or dharmshalas had been built at a cost of \u00a31827 (Rs. 18,270) of which about \u00a3974 (Rs. 9740) had been paid by Government and \u00a3853 (Rs. 8530) by the people.

During the first two years of the survey lease (1841-1843) in 120 Sholapur villages the cultivated area was about 314,000 acres and the collections \u00a313,100 (Rs. 1,31,000), \u00a3227 (Rs. 2270) being remitted in 1841-42 and \u00a328 (Rs. 280) in 1842-43. The average waste of these two years was 28,000 acres or about one-twelfth of the whole area. In the two years ending 1845 cultivation fell to 297,000 acres, and the waste rose to 44,400 acres or to about one-eighth. During the three years ending 1848 cultivation and collections rose, the average being 322,645 acres cultivated and \u00a313,969 (Rs. 1,39,690) collected. During the three years ending 1851 tillage fell to 313,000 acres and collections to \u00a313,650 (Rs. 1,36,500). During the three years ending 1854 the average cultivation was 308,000 acres, the collections \u00a313,400 (Rs. 1,34,000), and the waste 35,800 acres or about one-tenth. During the four years ending 1858 the cultivation rose to 315,000 acres and the collections to \u00a313,890 (Rs. 1,38,900). In the three years ending 1861 the average cultivation rose to 335,300 acres and the average collections to \u00a314,510 (Rs. 1,45,100) and the waste fell to 9940 acres or one thirty-fifth. The average collections for the ten years ending 1861 were nearly four per cent in excess of the ten years ending 1851. During the ten years ending 1871 the average cultivation was 344,384 acres, and the average collections \u00a314,889 (Rs. 1,48,890) or seven per cent in excess of those of the second decade and nearly eleven per cent in excess of those of the first decade. The arable waste had shrunk to about the thousandth part of the whole area. In the fifteen villages transferred from Mohol to Sholapur the average waste during the five years ending 1846 was 4932 acres or 13\u00b78 per cent, and the average collections \u00a31181 (Rs. 11,810). During the five years ending 1851 the average yearly collections rose to \u00a31233 (Rs. 12,330) and the waste fell to 1092 acres or three per cent. During the ten years ending 1861 collections averaged \u00a31284 (Rs. 12,840) and waste 1366 acres; and during the ten years ending 1871 collections averaged \u00a31324 (Rs. 13,240) and waste was only 019 per cent. Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 168-169.\n\n2 Looking to the great increase in ploughs and carts compared with the increase in bullocks, and to the decrease in cattle sheep and goats, the Survey Superintendent, Lieutenant-Colonel Waddington (January 1872), doubted the correctness of the return.

CL. 225.\nShol\u00e1pur a large area of land let for grazing paid eighteen times the Government assessment.\\(^1\\) Three-fourths of the tillage was jv\u00e1ri, bajri came next but with only one-tenth of the jv\u00e1ri. With the jv\u00e1ri occasional rows of safflower which required little moisture were almost always grown. Coarse rice was raised in hollows where water lodged and the rice was occasionally followed by a crop of pulse. Neither Mauritius sugarcane nor the mulberry nor the potato was grown. About 14,000 acres or 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent of the whole tillage was given to cotton. Sw\u00e1ngi or Indian madder was grown in small quantities in dry-crop lands. The garden crops were sugarcane, plantains, guavas, limes, earthnut, wheat, turmeric, and vegetables. Turmeric was chiefly grown in the outlying villages in rotation with sugarcane and wheat.\\(^2\\) The chief market was the town of Shol\u00e1pur with 81,000 people among whom were over 7000 traders and craftsmen. At its weekly market \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000) worth of cotton goods and blankets woven in and near Shol\u00e1pur, \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) worth of grain, and \u00a350 (Rs. 500) or \u00a360 (Rs. 600) of horses and cattle were offered for sale. Weekly markets were also held at Ghodeshvar, Keshar Jovalga, Mandrup, Mangrul, M\u00e1rdi, Musti, Vad\u00e1la, and Valsang, where \u00a330 to \u00a3250 (Rs. 300-Rs. 2500) worth of goods changed hands. Large quantities of cotton robes or s\u00e1dis, turbans, coarse cloth or kh\u00e1di, and carpets were woven; and the blankets commanded good prices. Shol\u00e1pur had 6425 cotton looms, 4250 weavers, 310 dyers; and 840 thread spinners; Valsang had 200 weavers and 100 dyers and Ahirv\u00e1di, Ghodeshvar, Hotgi, Mandrup, M\u00e1rdi, and Salgad had many looms. The yearly value of the produce of the cotton hand-looms of the sub-division was estimated at \u00a357,600 (Rs. 5,76,000), of the woollen goods at \u00a33900 (Rs. 39,000), of the brass and copper vessels at \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000), and of the iron tools at \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000), that is a total of \u00a367,900 (Rs. 6,79,000). In 1872 the people seemed well off and well clothed, and the villages were much better kept and better cleaned than those of Ind\u00e1pur and Bhimthadi. Land sold readily at ten to seventy years' purchase.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe Shol\u00e1pur sub-division was remeasured and the lands reclassed.

Out of eighty-one numbers taken at random in thirty the difference of classification exceeded three annas, in ten numbers the difference exceeded five annas, and in one instance the fault was more than eleven annas. In some of the best placed villages the rates had been exceptionally low. In the lands of the flourishing city of Sholapur the average acre rate was 7d. (4\u00bd as.) and the average in the rich villages of Degaon and Bala was 7\u00bdd. (5 as.) and 9\u00bdd. (6\u00bd as.). The new classing brought to light great inequalities in the former settlement. A highest dry-crop acre rate of 2s. 9d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) raised Dahitna 186 per cent while with the same highest rate Togarhali rose only 43 per cent; again in Khed and Kegaon, neighbouring villages with a similar highest rate, the increase in Khed was 127 and in Kegaon only 2 per cent. Excluding the eleven villages received from the Nizam, the unrecorded land found under tillage represented about seven per cent of the whole tillage area. Its assessment at the revision average dry-crop acre rate of 1s. 5d. (11\u00bd as.) amounted to \u00a31983 (Rs. 19,830). The Survey Superintendent proposed highest dry-crop acre rates of 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) for the lands of the Sholapur city, 2s. 9d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) for the surrounding villages, and 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bc) for those more distant. For the Mandrup villages which had not profited so much by the opening of the railway and still depended on ferries to cross the Sina during the rains, the proposed rates were 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bc) for the nearest and 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) for the more distant villages. Compared with \u00a317,410 (Rs. 1,74,100) the assessment on the land held for tillage in 1870-71 the revision survey rental was \u00a330,931 (Rs. 3,09,310) that is an increase of 77 per cent. The 1548 acres of arable waste were assessed at \u00a368 (Rs. 680) and brought the total assessment to \u00a330,999 (Rs. 3,09,990).

The total assessment on account of water was only \u00a3199 (Rs. 1990). It was proposed that lands under wells built during the survey lease should be exempted from any extra assessment, and that lands under wells which existed before the original lease should pay nothing beyond the highest dry-crop rate. For 2503 acres which yielded coarse rice and sometimes a second crop of pulse a highest acre rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) was proposed. Want of information regarding the area commanded, and the quantity of the supply, prevented the Superintendent making any proposals for the lands under the Ekruk lake. The proposed rates were sanctioned by Government in April 1872.\n\nIn 1872-73 the revised survey settlement was introduced into thirty-three villages of the Pandharpur sub-division. As noticed above the Pandharpur sub-division was settled by the survey department in 1857-58 when it formed part of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It was transferred to Shol\u00e1pur in 1864. Of the thirty-three villages thirty formerly belonged to the Mohol-M\u00e1dha and three to the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division. They were transferred to Pandharpur in 1866. The term of their settlement expired with that of M\u00e1dha in 1869 and revised rates were proposed in 1872-73. These villages lay to the south of the M\u00e1dha sub-division and between M\u00e1dha and the Bhima river which had formerly been the boundary between Mohol-M\u00e1dha and Pandharpur. They comprised a narrow strip of country about forty miles in length skirting the banks of the Bhima. The town of Pandharpur, though on the opposite side of the river, was in the centre of the group. Their area was 104,300 acres of which about 95,000 acres were arable. During the thirty-three years ending 1872, except in 1853-54 when \u00a385 (Rs. 850) were remitted, there were no remissions between 1847 and 1871. In 1871-72 the remissions amounted to \u00a3842 (Rs. 8420) or one-fourth of the whole land revenue. Notwithstanding this large deficit the average collections of the ten years before revision were a little in excess of those for the preceding ten years; and, throwing out 1871-72, the collections for the twenty-four years before the revision had been steady at \u00a33400 to \u00a33600 (Rs. 34,000 to Rs. 36,000). During the thirteen years ending 1852 the area of arable waste averaged 6\u00bd per cent, during the next ten years 4\u00bd, and during the last ten it was inappreciable. The question of fitting rates was almost already settled. The adjoining M\u00e1dha villages on the north had new rates introduced in 1871-72 and the Pandharpur villages on the south were settled in 1857-58 by the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r or Southern Mar\u00e1tha country survey. In the M\u00e1dha villages to the north the highest dry-crop acre rate was 2s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 1\u00bd) while in the Pandharpur villages to the south it varied from 2s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 1\u00bd) in Pandharpur and Gop\u00e1lpur to 1s. 9\u00bdd. (1\u00bd as.). Considering the rise in produce prices since the southern Pandharpur villages had been settled in 1857, Colonel\n\n---\n\n1 Lieut.-Col.

The effect of the M\u0101dha rates was as shown below to raise the assessment on occupied land from \u00a33605 (Rs. 36,050) to \u00a36271 (Rs. 62,710) that is an increase of 74 per cent:\n\n**Pandharpur Revision Settlement, 1872-73.**\n\n| SETTLEMENT | OCCUPIED | UNOCCUPIED | TOTAL |\n|------------|----------|------------|-------|\n|            | Area.    | Rental.    | Area. | Rental. |\n|            | Rs.      |            | Rs.   |         |\n| 1872-73    | 90,922   | 62,712     | 57    | 28      |\n| 1839-40    | 84,233   | 36,048     | 40    | 14      |\n| Increase   | 5989     | 26,664     | 17    | 14      |\n|            |          |            |       |         |\n|            |          |            |       |         |\n\nIn some villages the new rates raised the assessment over 100 per cent, in Ard\u1e47\u0101ri the rise was over 150 per cent. The average increase in the M\u0101dha sub-division had been 77 per cent and the average acre rate 1s. 2d. (9\u00bd as.). In the present Pandharpur group of thirty-three villages, though the average acre rate was 1s. 4\u00bdd. (11\u00bd as.), the increase was only 74 per cent. Channel-watered land was found in only four villages and the area watered was very small. For this a highest acre rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) descending to 1s. (Re. \u00bd) was proposed. Well-watered lands were treated in the same way as the well-watered lands of M\u0101dha. Of g\u0101\u1e0d\u012b or rice land there were only four acres for which the highest Shol\u0101pur acre rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) was proposed. Only three villages had grass or kuran lands. In 1871 the grass of these villages was sold for \u00a381 4s. (Rs. 812). The average receipts during the first thirteen years of the lease had been \u00a325 2s. (Rs. 251), during the next ten years \u00a342 (Rs. 420), and during the last ten years \u00a3106 14s. (Rs. 1067). The survey rates were not applied to these grass lands. They continued to be put to yearly auction. In forwarding the Superintendent's proposals the Survey Commissioner Colonel Francis increased the rates of four villages about four miles round Pandharpur. This change raised the enhancement under the revised rates from 74 to 76 per cent. Government sanctioned the proposed rates as modified by the Survey Commissioner.\n\n---\n\n1 The details are:\n\n**Pandharpur Settlement, 1872-73.**\n\n| VILLAGES | Superintendent's Total | Increase Proposed | Total | Percentage Increase |\n|----------|------------------------|-------------------|-------|---------------------|\n|          | Rs.                    | Rs.               | Rs.   |                     |\n| Adhiv    | 1238                   | 137               | 1270  | 89                  |\n| Chincholi| 506                    | 56                | 562   | 84                  |\n| Deagon   | 3476                   | 386               | 3862  | 54                  |\n| Gurs\u0101l\u0101  | 2278                   | 253               | 2531  | 88                  |\n\n2 Gov.

In 1872-73, except some outlying villages on the north-east, the B\u00e1rsi sub-division was fairly regular in shape and was surrounded by the territories of the Niz\u00e1m. From the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t hills on the north, with an average breadth of about twenty-three miles, B\u00e1rsi stretched south twenty-five to twenty-eight miles. There was a gradual south-westerly slope with a succession of dips and rises from east to west between each of the streams which crossed the sub-division, the slopes to the crests of the different water-sheds growing more and more gentle towards the east. As usual the richest land was towards the bottom of the slopes which commonly became almost level along the banks of the streams and were generally dotted with clumps of magnificent mango trees. Scarcely any of the soil was so poor as to bear nothing but spear-grass. Even the barrenest parts had earth enough to yield good grass during the rains. On the whole B\u00e1rsi was the best part of Shol\u00e1pur. There were no large rivers, the chief being the Bhog\u00e1vati, which, after crossing the sub-division, fell into the Sina. The minor streams were the Sina, Ch\u00e1ndni, N\u00e1gjhar\u00ed, Bedki, Zarina, and Ram. The rainfall was heavier in B\u00e1rsi than in any other part of Shol\u00e1pur. The appearance of the sub-division, even in so dry a year as 1871, the green grass and splendid river-side trees, the pools in almost every stream bed, the number of working wells, and the nearness of the water to the surface, satisfied (14th August 1872) Colonel Waddington that B\u00e1rsi had a better climate than any other part of Shol\u00e1pur to the north of the Bhima. At the town of B\u00e1rsi during the nine years ending 1871 the fall had varied from 16\u00b767 inches in 1871 to 43\u00b719 inches in 1870 and averaged 25\u00b762 inches. B\u00e1rsi was about thirteen miles distant from the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t hills. In Colonel Waddington\u2019s opinion the country between B\u00e1rsi and the hills had a heavier fall than B\u00e1rsi. Little land was watered except from wells. There were no large waterworks. The dam of the old Karkera reservoir in Koregaon in the extreme north-west had been repaired by Government about 1858 but was carried away in the floods of 1870, which also destroyed the dam of the Kaudgaon pond in the east of the sub-division.\n\nIn 1840-41 when the survey settlement was introduced, the people\n\n---\n\n1 The details are:\n\n| Year | B\u00e1rsi | Shol\u00e1pur | Kar-m\u00e1la | M\u00e1dha | Pand-harpur |\n|------|-------|----------|----------|-------|-------------|\n|      | Inches | Inches   | Inches   | Inches | Inches      |\n| 1863 | 24\u00b720  | 21\u00b728    | 12\u00b759    | 19\u00b772  | 13\u00b798       |\n| 1864 | 22\u00b758  | 20\u00b777    | 20\u00b779    | 24\u00b760  | 18\u00b759       |\n| 1865 | 19\u00b705  | 13\u00b772    | 13\u00b700    | 8\u00b726   | 18\u00b705       |\n| 1866 | 22\u00b745  | 20\u00b702    | 11\u00b786    | 15\u00b774  | 6\u00b750        |\n| 1867 | 22\u00b770  | 20\u00b747    | 11\u00b771    | 23\u00b712  | 23\u00b783       |\n| 1868 | 18\u00b762  | 25\u00b792    | 11\u00b771    | 14\u00b786  | 16\u00b755       |\n| 1869 | 38\u00b712  | 35\u00b778    | 37\u00b749    | 21\u00b704  | 23\u00b790       |\n| 1870 | 43\u00b719  | 35\u00b708    | 31\u00b770    | 35\u00b775  | 26\u00b737       |\n| 1871 | 16\u00b767  | 13\u00b709    | 10\u00b720    | 14\u00b781  | 11\u00b700       |\n| Average | 25\u00b762 | 23\u00b749    | 18\u00b756    | 20\u00b747  | 17\u00b786       |\n\nRem.

Owing to the fall in prices in 1835-36 the revenue and cultivation were little more than one-half what they had been nine years before. B\u00e1rsi produce prices were not available for the years before 1856. In the Survey Superintendent's opinion the rise must have been quite as great in B\u00e1rsi as in the neighbouring sub-divisions and could not have been less than 60 to 70 per cent. The average prices of jv\u00e1ri and b\u00e1jri between 1866-67 and 1871-72 were about three times as high as the prices between 1856-57 and 1860-61 and the difference in the price of wheat was even greater. During the fifteen years ending 1871 the rupee price of jv\u00e1ri had varied from sixty-one to thirteen shers and averaged about thirty-three shers.\\(^1\\) In the first year of the survey settlement the B\u00e1rsi villages made a very sudden advance. A bad season in 1845-46 checked the advance and several years of variable revenue and tillage followed. But about 1853-54 a steady upward turn set in and by about 1860 the full rental began to be realized. Between 1861 and 1872 the full rental continued to be realized without any remission. During the twelve years ending 1852 the average collections were \u00a310,374 (Rs. 1,03,740), the average waste 40,803 acres, and the average remissions \u00a3442 (Rs. 4420).\n\nAt the time of the settlement Captain Wingate estimated that in 1840-41 the first year of the settlement the assessment on the land under cultivation would be \u00a38400 (Rs. 84,000). But the records show that in the first year of the new settlement 25,000 acres of waste were taken for tillage and the revenue rose to \u00a310,688 (Rs. 1,06,880). Still 50,000 acres or little more than one-fifth of the whole arable area was waste, and \u00a3892 (Rs. 8920) of remissions were allowed. In 1841-42 7000 acres of waste were taken for tillage and only \u00a317 (Rs. 170) were granted in remissions. In 1842-43 the waste again rose to 46,986 acres and in the following year to 55,246. In 1844-45 the waste was slightly less and in 1845-46 over 11,000 acres were taken for tillage, but the remissions amounted to the large sum of \u00a34087 (Rs. 40,870). In 1846-47 over 18,000 acres were taken for tillage and the waste reduced to 24,254 acres, and only \u00a332 (Rs. 320) were remitted. From 1846-47 tillage again gradually declined until in 1851-52 the waste amounted to 35,490 acres or about one-seventh of the whole area.

After 1852-53 the waste rapidly decreased while collections rose and remissions dwindled until in 1861-62 the twenty-second year of the settlement there were 2633 acres of waste, the collections were \u00a312,348 (Rs. 1,23,480), and there were no remissions. During the ten years ending 1872 almost the whole waste was taken for tillage, the collections averaged \u00a312,459 (Rs. 1,24,590), and there were no remissions.\n\nDuring the thirty-two years ending 1872 population had increased from 66,245 to 100,566 or 51 per cent, houses from 13,788 to 18,495 or 34 per cent, village offices from 48 to 126 or 162 per cent, carts from 705 to 1794 or 154 per cent, ploughs from 1543 to 2476 or 60 per cent, bullocks from 26,466 to 31,469 or 18 per cent, and cattle sheep and horses from 58,831 to 64,905 or 10 per cent. Wells showed an increase from 1776 to 2844 or 60 per cent. In 1840 there had been 1776 working wells. In 1872 there were 3947 wells of which 136 were used for drinking, 967 were out of repair, and 2844 that is an increase of 60 per cent were used for watering. Of these 110 had been made during the twelve years ending 1852, 299 during the ten years ending 1862, and 987 during the ten years ending 1872.\u00b9\n\nThough B\u00e1rsi was on the whole the best sub-division in Shol\u00e1pur few villages were almost entirely of the best soil. On the other hand there was almost no very poor soil. The field tools in use were the same as in other parts of the Deccan, and the heavier dry-crop soils were not ploughed more than once in four or five years. In the intermediate years the surface was merely scratched with a harrow but this seemed to be all that it required. The garden lands were very carefully ploughed and harrowed every year and were heavily manured. Manure was also occasionally used in the dry-crop soils. The chief early or kharif crops were b\u00e1jri, tur, cotton, mug, amb\u00e1di, and til; the late or rabi crops were jodri which covered 62 per cent of the whole, wheat, gram, linseed, and safflower. The garden products were turmeric, earthnuts, barley, rice, wheat, onions, sweet potatoes, yams, chillies, and vegetables, and also ju\u00e1ri and maize for fodder. Sugarcane and plantains were occasionally grown and a few villages had gardens of p\u00e1n or betel vine but the staple garden crops were turmeric and earthnuts.\u00b2\n\nThe chief line of traffic was the twenty-two miles from the town of B\u00e1rsi to the B\u00e1rsi Road railway station. This was bridged and metalled throughout, and was one of the best highways in this part of the Deccan, as it was originally intended for a tramway. It passed through B\u00e1rsi to Yeds\u00ed above the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills; but beyond B\u00e1rsi it was not metalled.

The cotton sent from the B\u00e1rsi Road railway station chiefly came from the Niz\u00e1m's territories but much of the oil seed, grain, and other field produce was grown in B\u00e1rsi. In 1840 Captain Wingate estimated the value of the cotton trade of B\u00e1rsi at about \u00a312,500 (Rs. 1,25,000). The average for the five years ending 1871 showed 337,424 mans or at about \u00a32 (Rs. 20) a man about \u00a3600,000 to \u00a3700,000 (Rs. 60,00,000-Rs. 70,00,000) that is an increase of over fiftyfold.\u00b9 There were two towns B\u00e1rsi and Vair\u00e1g and four large villages K\u00e1ri, P\u00e1ngao, P\u00e1ngri, and Tadval. Next to Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi was the largest town in the district. In 1872 it had a population of 15,759 that is an advance since 1840 of 62 per cent and 4314 houses or a rise of 141\u00bd per cent. It was a well built town with broad clean streets. About 250 carts passed through it every day. The chief market towns were B\u00e1rsi, Vair\u00e1g, and P\u00e1ngri, and, besides live stock and grain, the chief articles for sale were turmeric, sugar, butter, cotton, metals, oil, wood, cotton and woollen twists, cloth, dyes, tobacco, leather, and bangles. In B\u00e1rsi about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) worth of goods were estimated to change hands weekly, and in Vair\u00e1g about \u00a31400 (Rs. 14,000) worth. Manufactures were confined to the weaving of coarse cotton and woollen cloths. The chief weaving centres were B\u00e1rsi, P\u00e1ngri, Tadval, and Vair\u00e1g. They had together 376 cotton looms and 117 woollen looms. The people were thriving. Though 1871 had been a bad year, almost every village had a number of stacks of straw or kadba. For five years there had been no remissions, and no sales of land because of failure to pay the Government rent.\u00b2 The sale and mortgage value of land varied from five to seventy times the assessment.\u00b3\n\nUnder the revision survey the 111 Government villages were arranged in four classes with highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 3s. to 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd - 1\u00bc). The highest rate of 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) was confined to the town of B\u00e1rsi. In the second class with a rate of 2s. 9d. (Rs. 1\u00be) were fifty-eight villages within five or six miles of B\u00e1rsi, or near the hills, or on the road to Vair\u00e1g, or to B\u00e1rsi Road station. Forty-seven villages made up the third class with a rate of 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bc); these villages were further from B\u00e1rsi and the hills to the south of the road from B\u00e1rsi to Vair\u00e1g, and some villages in the north-east corner. A group of five villages in the south-east corner formed the fourth class with a rate of 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00be).\u2074 The effect of the settlement was a rise of 80 per cent in the first class, 66 in the second, 62 in the third, and 95 in the fourth.\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel.

Of these only 111 Government and four two-owned or dumda came under the revised settlement.

(11\u00be as.) against the Sholapur rate of 1s. 5\u00bdd. (11\u00be as.). In these 111 Government villages the largest collections between 1818-19 and 1839-40 exclusive of miscellaneous or s\u00fay\u00e1r revenue were \u00a318,930 (Rs. 1,89,300) in 1826-27. Compared with this the revised survey rental \u00a320,725 (Rs. 2,07,250) showed an increase of \u00a31795 (Rs. 17,950) or 9\u00b748 per cent. Compared with the collections under the original settlement the new rental was \u00a310,351 (Rs. 1,03,510) or 100 per cent more than the average revenue during the twelve years ending 1852; \u00a33900 (Rs. 89,000) or 75 per cent more than the average during the ten years ending 1862, and \u00a38266 (Rs. 82,660) or 66 per cent more than the average during the ten years ending 1872. Cases of a very great increase in individual villages were less common than in the Sholapur sub-division. In only eleven instances was the increase more than 100 per cent. The greatest rise was in the village of Gorm\u00e1la which was raised 150 per cent and the least was in Pimpalvandi and Turk Pimpri which were raised 13 per cent. The following statement shows the effect of the revision in 111 Government villages:\n\n**B\u00e1rsi Revision Settlement, 1872-73.**\n\n| Settlement | Occupied | Waste | Total |\n|------------|----------|-------|-------|\n|            | Area.    | Rs.   | Area. | Rs.   | Area. | Rs.   |\n| 1872       | 278,509  | 2,07,174 | 88    | 72    | 278,592 | 2,07,246 |\n| 1840       | 248,465  | 1,24,658 | 59    | 9     | 248,524 | 1,24,667 |\n| Increase   | 30,044   | 82,516  | 24    | 63    | 30,068 | 82,579 |\n\nUnder the existing settlement the assessment on land watered by wells and channels was \u00a3831 (Rs. 8310). This had been imposed in a lump without any detail of what proportion was on account of the well-watered and what on account of the channel-watered land. The revision survey showed 14,133 acres under wells so that by abandoning the cess on wells at least \u00a32800 (Rs. 28,000) would be foregone.\u00b9 The channel-watered area was 1058 acres for which a highest water rate of 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) decreasing to 1s. (Re. \u00bd) was proposed. The total channel-water assessment in 111 villages was \u00a3191 (Rs. 1910) or an average additional acre rate of 3s. 7\u00bdd.

CL. 381-384.\nIn 1873-74 the revised survey settlement was introduced into Karm\u00e1la. The Karm\u00e1la sub-division lay in the north-west of the district between the Bhima and the Sina rivers. It was bounded on the north by Karjat in Ahmadnagar, on the east by the Sina river with the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory beyond, on the south by M\u00e1dha in Shol\u00e1pur, and on the west by the Bhima river with Ind\u00e1pur of Poona beyond. The greatest length of the sub-division from north to south was thirty-eight miles and its breadth from east to west twenty-eight miles. Its total area was 772 square miles or 494,063 acres. The water-parting of the Bhima and Sina rivers which ran from Kem north-west to a little west of the town of Karm\u00e1la divided the sub-division in two. The country was a succession of rises and dips with a good deal of high tableland in places covered with loose stones and occasionally with boulders. Near Kem were two small hills and much of the north and north-west was rough and fissured by large streams. Except in the valleys and near villages, trees were rare and stunted compared with the B\u00e1rsi trees. The soil as a rule was good though shallow. The climate of Karm\u00e1la was less favourable than that of M\u00e1dha. During the nine years ending 1871 the average rainfall at Karm\u00e1la was 18\u00b756 inches against 20\u00b748 at M\u00e1dha. As regards rain the north-east of Karm\u00e1la had perhaps a slight advantage over the south near Tembhurni. But the seasons were most uncertain; a really good one did not come oftener than once in three or four years. When the season was good, the harvest was so abundant that if the people were more provident, they could easily tide over the poor years and meet the Government demands. But the bulk of the people were in the hands of the moneylenders to whom most, if not the whole, gain of a good harvest went.\n\nAt the former settlement in 1842-44 Karm\u00e1la included two revenue divisions: the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s charge of thirty-four Government and one alienated villages and the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s charge of forty-eight Government and one alienated villages, that is a total of eighty-two Government and two alienated villages. The territorial changes made in 1859-60, 1862-63, and 1866-67 and the lapse of three villages in 1869-70 had increased Karm\u00e1la to 111 Government and twelve alienated villages, all of which were under a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. All of these 123 villages had been surveyed at different times.

The first survey settlement was introduced into them between 1842 and 1844.\n\nDuring the ten years ending 1841 the average rupee price of Indian millet or *jevari* was 86 pounds (43 *shers*) and of millet or *bajri* 64 pounds (32 *shers*); during the ten years ending 1852 Indian millet was at 128 pounds (64 *shers*) and millet at 100 pounds (50 *shers*), or a decrease in price of about 33 per cent in Indian millet or *jevari* and 36 per cent in millet or *bajri*. During the ten years ending 1862 the average price rose to nearly the same as that of the ten years ending 1841 that is to 80 pounds (40 *shers*) of *jevari* and to 66 pounds (33 *shers*) of *bajri*. During the ten years ending 1872 the average price was *jevari* 42 pounds (21 *shers*) and *bajri* 34 pounds (17 *shers*), or an increase of 90 and 94 per cent over the ten years ending 1862, and of 205 per cent in *jevari* and 194 per cent in *bajri* over the ten years ending 1852. The average of the fifteen years ending 1857 was *jevari* 112 pounds (56 *shers*) and *bajri* 90 pounds (45 *shers*), and, excluding the five years of extremely high prices ending 1867, the average for the fifteen years ending 1872 was *jevari* 62 pounds (31 *shers*) and *bajri* 50 pounds (25 *shers*) or eighty per cent above the corresponding prices in the fifteen years ending 1857.\n\nIn 1843 when the settlement was introduced there were no less than 72,800 acres or 37 per cent of arable waste assessed at \u00a32543 (Rs. 25,430). During the four years ending 1847 half the waste was taken for tillage; at the same time in 1845-46 the remissions amounted to \u00a34473 (Rs. 44,730) or more than half the assessment. From 1847 to 1851 the cultivation and collections steadily decreased until in 1850-51 the waste was no less than 79,919 acres and the collections only \u00a37478 (Rs. 74,780). The two years ending 1853 saw the waste reduced to 61,000 acres and the collections increased to \u00a38335 (Rs. 83,350). The average cultivation during the ten years ending 1853 was 211,116 acres, the remissions \u00a3546 (Rs. 5460), and the collections \u00a37849 (Rs. 78,490). During the ten years ending 1863 the waste lands were steadily absorbed and the collections simultaneously rose, until in 1862 there were only 758 acres of unoccupied assessed land and the revenue collected was \u00a310,679 (Rs. 1,06,790).\n\n---\n\n1 The details are:\n\n| Year | Jevari | Bajri |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 1843-44 | 100 | 60 |\n| 1844-45 | 44 | 39 |\n| 1845-46 | 80 | 57 |\n| 1846-47 | 38 | 36 |\n| 1847-48 | 74 | 65 |\n| 1848-49 | 88 | 77 |\n| 1849-50 | 88 | 72 |\n| 1850-51 | 65 | 55 |\n| 1851-52 | 60 | 42 |\n| 1852-53 | 60 | 52 |\n| Average | 64 | 50 |\n\nThe average of the fifteen years ending 1857-58 was *jevari* 112 pounds (56 *shers*) and *bajri* 90 pounds (45 *shers*), and, excluding the five years of famine and American war prices (1863-1868), the average of the fifteen years ending 1872-73 was *jevari* 62 pounds (31 *shers*) and *bajri* 50 pounds (25 *shers*). Bom. Gov. Sel. CL. 416-417.\nThe average remissions during this period were only \u00a37 (Rs. 70), the occupied area was 250,105 acres, and the collections \u00a39919 (Rs. 99,190) or 26 per cent higher than during the ten years ending 1853. In the ten years ending 1873 the average cultivation was 271,415 acres and the average collections \u00a310,652 (Rs. 1,06,520), the waste being only 464 acres. Remissions amounting to \u00a3437 (Rs. 4370) were granted only in 1871-72. Compared with \u00a38198 (Rs. 81,980) the average collections of the five years ending 1843, the average collections for the ten years ending 1873 showed an increase of thirty per cent.\n\nDuring the thirty years ending 1873 in the ninety-three villages under revision, population increased from 55,733 in 1843 to 68,971 in 1873 or 24 per cent, carts from 449 to 1276 or 184 per cent, ploughs from 1762 to 2421 or 37 per cent, bullocks and male buffaloes from 25,907 to 27,433 or 5:8 per cent, and sheep and goats from 32,567 to 34,780 or 6:8 per cent; houses decreased from 10,952 to 9974 or 8:9 per cent; and working wells increased from 1090 to 1730 or 58 per cent. Of the new wells 49 were made in the ten years ending 1858, 150 in the ten years ending 1863, and 391 in the ten years ending 1873.\n\nMr. Whitcombe estimated that of the whole soil fifty per cent was black, twenty-five per cent red, and twenty-five per cent stony. Except along the banks of the streams and in the valley of the Sina river the black soil was usually somewhat shallow. It was frequently stiff and clayey in texture and required a heavy rainfall to ensure a full crop. In favourable years the outturn was equal or even superior to the best black soils, but in ordinary years it yielded an indifferent crop and in unfavourable years the outturn scarcely paid for the seed. A small quantity of alluvial land lay along the Bhima. The people of J\u00e1t\u00e9gaon were hardworking and painstaking and ploughed their lands every year; the usual practice in the Karm\u00e1la sub-division was to plough the land only once in three, four, or even in five years, the harrow alone being employed in the intermediate years. Much more labour was bestowed on the garden lands. The use of manure was confined almost entirely to gardens except close to the town of Karm\u00e1la where the population was denser and more manure was available. One cause of slovenly tillage was the small number of plough cattle. In 1873 the stock of cattle was insufficient for the proper tillage of the land. In many cases men held fifty or sixty acres of land without owning a single working bullock. No land could be properly worked whose owner trusted to the chance of hiring bullocks in the sowing season. The uncertain and scanty rainfall was another cause of careless tillage. This was not peculiar to Karm\u00e1la; it affected almost all the subdivisions of Shol\u00e1pur. The usual crops were jv\u00e1ri, b\u00e1jri, safflower, a small quantity of wheat, cotton, and gram chiefly in garden lands, and other crops in small proportions. The occupied waste was less in proportion to the cultivated area than in most of the lately settled sub-divisions. The usual rotation of crops was in early harvest or khar\u00edf land in the first year b\u00e1jri mixed with tur, hemp, and khur\u00e1smi; in the second year a late crop; and in the third the same\nas in the first year. In late harvest or rabi lands in the first year b\u00e1jri, in the second year jv\u00e1ri with every fifth furrow of safflower and two or three furrows of linseed, and in the third year the same as in the first year. In garden lands the succession was in the first year b\u00e1jri, with a second crop of wheat gram or vegetables; in the second year Indian corn, rice, udid, or mug; in the third year the same as the first year and sometimes but seldom sugarcane. The proportions in which the different crops were grown were in 1872, 57\u00b75 per cent of jv\u00e1ri, 15\u00b74 of b\u00e1jri, and 27\u00b71 of other crops.\n\nKarm\u00e1la was crossed from west to east by the Peninsula Railway. The railway followed the course of the Bhima about half-way through the sub-division, passed over the water-shed near the Kem station, and from Kem followed the Sina valley until it crossed the Sina near Mohol. Three railway stations Pomalv\u00e1di, Jeur, and Kem were within Karm\u00e1la limits and two D\u00edks\u00e1l and B\u00e1rsi Road were close to its border. Karm\u00e1la was indifferently off for roads. The only made roads were ten miles from Karm\u00e1la to the Jeur station and a short piece of the Poona-Shol\u00e1pur road which passed through South Karm\u00e1la. The chief fair weather road was from Ahmadnagar to Karm\u00e1la and thence to Shol\u00e1pur, Pandharpur, and B\u00e1rsi. A good deal of traffic used to pass by this route but the railway had almost monopolised the carriage, although many thousand pilgrims annually travelled through the sub-division on their way to Pandharpur. Still at times a not inconsiderable cart traffic passed through Karm\u00e1la from Shol\u00e1pur and B\u00e1rsi to Nagar. Karm\u00e1la was well provided with markets. Besides the chief market town of Karm\u00e1la, weekly markets were held within the sub-division at Tembhurni, Kem, V\u00e1ngi, Kondej, Korti, and Son\u00e1ri and the markets of Ind\u00e1pur, Kurdu, Narsingpur, Akluj, and Par\u00e1nda were within easy reach. In addition to its local markets the subdivision enjoyed the advantage of the railway, which offered every facility for the transport of surplus produce to Poona, Bombay, and Shol\u00e1pur. The manufactures were confined to the making of a few coarse cotton and woollen fabrics, such as robes, turbans, kh\u00e1dis, and blankets. The number of cotton looms was 229 and of woollen looms ninety-six. Considerable quantities of saltpetre were made in the rudest manner by the lowest castes the M\u00e1ngs and Mh\u00e1rs. The process was simple and cheap. The soil was mixed with water in shallow pans built of stone and mortar allowing evaporation to take place by the heat of the sun. The yearly yield of a pan was estimated to average four to five thousand pounds. It was sold to dealers at sixteen pounds the rupee, and retailed rough at ten or twelve pounds and refined by boiling at six or seven pounds. The manufacture was carried on in the fair season and the outturn in 1872-73 was estimated at 250,000 pounds; the license fees for the right to make saltpetre amounted to \u00a380 (Rs. 800).\n\n1 The details were: jv\u00e1ri 57\u00b75, b\u00e1jri 15\u00b74, kardai 4\u00b79, cotton 3\u00b71, wheat 2\u00b74, gram 2\u00b73, math 1\u00b78, tur 1\u00b74, bulga 1\u00b76, khurtsni 0\u00b79, amb\u00e1di 0\u00b77, mug 0\u00b75, rice 0\u00b73, chillies 0\u00b73, bhuiumug 0\u00b73, Indian corn 0\u00b73, linseed 0\u00b73, castor oil 0\u00b73, tobacco 0\u00b72, til 0\u00b72, miscellaneous 0\u00b72, sugarcane 0\u00b71, r\u00e1dli 0\u00b71, s\u00e1tiu 0\u00b71, and occupied waste 4\u00b78.

Mr. Whitcombe the Assistant Survey Superintendent thought the want of progress was due to the scanty and uncertain rainfall; Colonel Waddington thought it was because people held more land than they could properly cultivate; and Colonel Francis thought the chief cause was the influence of the moneylender. It could hardly be over-assessment as the average dry-crop acre rates were only half an anna higher than in Indapur.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn Karmala as in other parts of Sholapur it was common for occupants to sublet their lands. Land was usually sublet for a payment of grain. In dry-crop land the commonest arrangement was that the occupant should pay the Government assessment, and in the case of wheat and gram supply two-fifths of the seed grain, and receive two-fifths of the produce. In garden lands the usage was for the occupant to pay the Government demand and one-third of the expense of leather bag, ropes, manure, and weeding, and in the case of wheat, gram, and sugar, find one-third of the seed, and exact one-third of the produce. In the event of lands being sub-let for grazing, the payments were in cash and the receipts were generally considerably more than the Government rental. The occupancy right of land sold for considerably less than in many other sub-divisions. Dry-crop lands fetched 2s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 1 - 10) the acre and garden lands \u00a31 10s. to \u00a34 12s. (Rs. 15 - 46); the higher rate was rare.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe ninety-three Government villages were divided into three classes and charged highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) to 2s. (Re. 1). Jeur and Kem at which there were railway stations were placed in the first class and charged a highest rate of 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). The second class contained twenty-one villages and was charged a highest rate of 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)); one of these villages was Ropla; the other villages lay within four miles of a railway station and along the line. The third class contained the seventy remaining villages which were further removed from the railway; they were charged a highest rate of 2s. (Re. 1). In the village of Singevadi the increase under the new assessment exceeded seventy per cent. This was a specially good village and the old classification was thought to be much too low, especially the classification of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lieut.-Colonel Waddington, Surv.

In three other villages the assessment was raised between 60 and 70 per cent but in none of these did the new average acre rate exceed 1s. 5\u00bdd. (8\u00bd as.). In Nimbhora in which the assessment was most raised the new average acre rate was only 8\u00bdd. (5\u00bd as.).\n\nIn 1872-73 the occupied area was 271,194 acres and the collections \u00a310,690 (Rs. 1,06,900). Under the revised survey the occupied area was 293,487 acres and the proposed assessment \u00a314,776 (Rs. 1,47,760), which was \u00a34086 (Rs. 40,860) or 38 per cent higher than the payments of 1872-73. There was besides a small quantity of unoccupied land which was assessed at \u00a364 (Rs. 640) making a total of \u00a314,840 (Rs. 1,48,400). Irrigation was chiefly confined to wells of which 1730 were in working order in 1873 against 1090 in 1843. The 1873 well-assessment ranged from 6d. to \u00a32 14s. (Rs. \u00bc - 27) on each well according to capability, and the total well-assessment was \u00a3456 8s. (Rs. 4564). Under the revision survey there was no separate water charge on well-water. Channel-watered lands were all watered from lately built temporary dams. With few exceptions the water-supply did not last beyond the end of December or the beginning of January. A few villages had water enough for the growth of wheat and onions, and the supply was available until the middle or the end of February. The highest acre rate for channel-watered lands was proposed at 7s. 6d. (Rs. 3\u00be), and the total rental amounted to \u00a398 (Rs. 980) giving an average acre rate of 3s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 1\u00bd). Of rice land there were only thirty-four acres on which a highest acre rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) was imposed.\n\nThe proposed settlement was sanctioned by Government in February 1874.\n\nIn October 1874, in consequence of the marked fall in produce prices during the three previous years, Government decided that it was advisable to limit and in some cases to reduce the amount of revision enhancements. It was right that Government should share in the increase of wealth caused by high prices, and by improved communications. It was also right that mistakes in the former survey should be corrected and that land which was held in excess of the proper area should pay its due rental. At the same time as there seemed reason to believe that the high prices which had ruled during the ten years ending 1871 would not continue,\n\n---\n\n1 The details are:\n\n| Year | Tillage 1872-73 | Waste | Total |\n|------|----------------|-------|-------|\n| 1873-74 | 1,47,757 | 639 | 1,48,396 |\n| 1842-43 | 1,06,897 | 239 | 1,07,136 |\n| Increase | 40,860 | 400 | 41,260 |\n\n2 Lieut.-Colonel Waddington, 921 of 3rd Oct. 1873, Bom.

The enhancement of the rental of a holding was generally due to one of three causes. Land was assessed which in the first survey had been included in a number as unarable; the holder had spread over the borders of his land and encroached on waste; and land was more highly valued than before because of a change in the valuation scale. As regards land originally included in a number as unarable but on revision found to be arable Government inclined to the opinion that the holder should have the benefit of the doubt and the change in the soil be considered an improvement and therefore should remain untaxed. This ruling was cancelled in consequence of objections taken to it by the Government of India. As regards land included in a holding through the encroachment of the holder on Government waste, Government ruled that encroachments should in every case be regularly assessed. As regards changes in the official valuation of land, Government noticed that after the introduction of the survey several years passed before the system for the uniform valuing of soil was perfected. The system laid down in the orders known as the Joint Rules published in 1847-48 was sound and correct. It was probable that in none of the settlements which had been made after the passing of the Joint Rules would a revaluing be required. In the case of settlements which had been made before the Joint Rules were in force, variation from the Joint Rules standard, if very small, should be allowed, care being taken to keep the valuation of poor soils low. Village groups whose revision enhancements were in excess of the enhancement now sanctioned by Government, were to receive the following treatment. In all village groups the revision enhancement was to be reduced to fifty per cent.\\(^2\\)\n\nAfter the enhancement of a village group had been reduced to fifty per cent, if the enhancement in any one village remained more than 75 per cent and the enhancement in any one holding remained over 100 per cent, the case was to be reported for the orders of Government. In consequence of these orders the revision enhancements\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The details are:\n\n*Sholapur Survey Settlements, 1839-1844 and 1869-1874.*\n\n| Sub-Division | Original Settlement | Revised Settlement |\n|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n|              | Arable. | Rental. | Average Acre Rate. | Arable. | Rental. | Average Acre Rate. | Increase |\n| M\u00f3hla        | 1,00,580 | 0       | Rs.

Cholera killed 359 men and cattle disease 157 cattle. The tillage area was 1,731,009 acres and the collections were \u00a377,035 (Rs. 7,70,350); 10s. (Rs. 5) were remitted and there were no outstandings. Jv\u0101ri rupee prices were twenty-nine pounds.\n\nIn 1865-66 the rainfall, though not seasonable, was generally sufficient. Both the early and the late harvests were good. The district was free from epidemic sickness. The tillage area rose from 1,731,009 to 1,738,544 acres, and the collections fell from \u00a377,035 to \u00a376,916 (Rs. 7,70,350 to Rs. 7,69,160); 10s. (Rs. 5) were remitted and \u00a31 18s. (Rs. 19) left outstanding. Jv\u0101ri rupee prices fell from twenty-nine to thirty-eight pounds.\n\n---\n\n1 The Sub-Collector, 150 of 3rd February 1865.\nIn 1866-67 the rainfall was sufficient throughout the district except in Pandharpur where both the early and the late harvest almost entirely failed. In other parts of the district the early crops were middling and the late harvest was good. Cholera and cattle disease were both prevalent. The tillage area rose from 1,738,544 to 1,794,031 acres and the collections from \u00a376,916 to \u00a378,575 (Rs. 7,69,160 to Rs. 7,85,750); \u00a313 (Rs. 130) were remitted and there were no outstandings. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices rose from thirty-eight to thirty-seven pounds.\n\nIn 1867-68 the rainfall was seasonable. The kharif crops on the whole were good, though in Sholapur at the time of ripening they suffered a little from want of rain. The rabi crops were generally good, middling in M\u00e1dha Pandharpur and S\u00e1ngola, and bad in Sholapur owing to excessive rain. Cotton crops entirely failed in Sholapur and were worm-eaten in M\u00e1dha. Public health was good. Cholera slightly prevailed in the district, and cattle-disease killed about 500 cattle, the greatest number being in Karm\u00e1l\u00e1. The tillage area rose from 1,794,031 to 1,795,142 acres and the collections fell from \u00a378,575 to \u00a378,364 (Rs. 7,85,750 to Rs. 783,640); \u00a317 (Rs. 170) were remitted and there were no outstandings. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 37 to 47 pounds.\n\nIn 1868-69 the rainfall was not generally favourable. In S\u00e1ngola and in parts of Pandharpur and Karm\u00e1l\u00e1 want of rain caused widespread failure of crops, and also of water in some places. Public health was good, except that cholera prevailed slightly in October and November. The collections rose from \u00a378,364 to \u00a378,689 (Rs. 7,83,640 to Rs. 7,86,890); \u00a333 (Rs. 330) were remitted and \u00a343 (Rs. 430) left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices rose from 47 to 43 pounds.\n\nIn 1869-70 the rainfall was general and sufficient and the early harvest was good; the late crops suffered from excessive rain. There was a slight epidemic of cholera. The collections rose from \u00a378,689 to \u00a378,788 (Rs. 7,86,890 to Rs. 7,87,880); \u00a323 (Rs. 230) were remitted and \u00a376 (Rs. 760) left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices rose from 43 to 36 pounds.\n\nIn 1870-71 the early crops were greatly damaged by excessive rain and in January 1871 it was feared that from the same cause the late crops and the cotton would be below the average. At and near Pandharpur an outbreak of cholera proved fatal in 743 cases; otherwise the year was healthy. About 554 head of cattle died of disease. The collections fell from \u00a378,788 to \u00a378,491 (Rs. 7,87,880 to Rs. 7,84,910); \u00a37153 (Rs. 71,530) were remitted and \u00a390 (Rs. 900) were left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices rose from 36 to 28 pounds.\n\nIn 1871-72 the deficiency of rain was generally felt in the district, and especially in the greater portions of Pandharpur and S\u00e1ngola. In the other sub-divisions and particularly in B\u00e1rsi the crops in the better soil yielded a more favourable harvest. The average yield for the whole district was estimated at about six\n\n---\n\n1 Sub-Collector, 24th January 1868, Bom. Gov. Rev., Rec. 59 of 1868, 339.\nannas in the rupee. Public health was good. There was slight disease among cattle. The collections fell from \u00a378,491 to \u00a366,610 (Rs. 7,84,910 to Rs. 6,66,100), \u00a323,520 (Rs. 2,35,200) were remitted and \u00a37777 (Rs. 77,770) left outstanding. Ju\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 28 to 36 pounds.\n\nIn 1872-73 the rainfall was general and plentiful. Nearly a fourth of the whole arable land was sown with early and the remaining three-fourths with late crops. Both harvests were good. The year was not healthy. There was an outbreak of dengue fever, in 1235 cases cholera proved fatal, and 582 head of cattle died from disease. The tillage area rose from 1,881,109 to 1,921,166 acres and the collections from \u00a366,610 to \u00a396,577 (Rs. 6,66,100 to Rs. 9,65,770); \u00a311,336 (Rs. 1,13,360) were remitted and \u00a3863 (Rs. 8630) left outstanding. Ju\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 36 to 56 pounds.\n\nIn 1873-74 the rainfall was 24 inches. In B\u00e1rsi and Shol\u00e1pur it was above and in the other sub-divisions it was below the average. Except in S\u00e1ngola the first fall was seasonable for sowing. A drought followed and continued long enough to kill most of the early crops. In Pandharpur, S\u00e1ngola, M\u00e1dha, and Karm\u00e1la want of rain delayed the sowing of the late crops until after the middle of October. Afterwards when the seed was coming up the rain again held off. The result was not more than half a harvest. Public health was good. In the Karm\u00e1la sub-division 625 head of cattle died from disease. The tillage area rose from 1,921,166 to 1,941,632 acres and the collections from \u00a396,577 to \u00a3106,243 (Rs. 9,65,770 to Rs. 10,62,430); \u00a34583 (Rs. 45,830) were remitted and \u00a31877 (Rs. 18,770) left outstanding. Ju\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 56 to 69 pounds.\n\nIn 1874-75 the rainfall was 29 inches. In the greater part of the district the rainfall was favourable for the early or khari crops. Excess of rain in S\u00e1ngola caused slight damage. In October the river M\u00e1n, which runs through parts of S\u00e1ngola and Pandharpur, overflowed and washed away the crops and some of the land. Except in B\u00e1rsi the late or rabi harvest was injured by heavy rain. Public health was good. 1557 head of cattle died from disease. The tillage area fell from 1,941,632 to 1,929,170 acres and the collections from \u00a3106,243 to \u00a3102,126 (Rs. 10,62,430 to Rs. 10,21,260); \u00a39047 (Rs. 90,470) were remitted and \u00a3249 (Rs. 2490) left outstanding. Ju\u00e1ri rupee prices rose from 69 to 63 pounds.\n\nIn 1875-76 the rainfall was 18 inches. The fall in the first fortnight of September was favourable to the early crops throughout the district and the outturn was about half a harvest. The late crops were also fair. There were two rather severe outbreaks of cholera. About 1650 head of cattle were carried off by disease. In this year the district was increased by the addition of M\u00e1lsiras from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The tillage area rose from 1,929,170 to 2,147,432 acres and the collections from \u00a3102,126 to \u00a3107,191 (Rs. 10,21,260 to Rs. 10,71,910); \u00a3274 (Rs. 2740) were remitted and \u00a3449 (Rs. 4490) left outstanding. Ju\u00e1ri rupee prices rose from 63 to 27 pounds.\nIn 1876-77 the rainfall of 9 inches was very slight and partial. Nearly all the early crops perished and the little late crops which were sown came to nothing. Cholera caused 2139 deaths; 400 cattle died of disease. Many works had to be started to relieve the destitute, and the scarcity of fodder killed numbers of cattle and forced many owners to send their animals into the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country. The tillage area rose from 2,147,432 to 2,151,617 acres and the collections fell from \u00a3107,191 to \u00a321,896 (Rs. 10,71,910 to Rs. 2,18,960); \u00a3753 (Rs. 7530) were remitted and \u00a384,949 (Rs. 8,49,490) left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices rose from 27 to 15 pounds.\n\nIn 1877-78 the rainfall of 33 inches was general and plentiful. It began early in June and was at first favourable. It then held off and caused great loss to the pulse. Rain fell again late in August and the other early crops were saved. The late harvest was fair. The year was unhealthy. Numbers died from cholera fever and small-pox. Early in the year many of the cattle were removed to the Sahy\u00e1dri grazing grounds, and of these a large number did not return. The tillage area fell from 2,151,617 to 2,138,788 acres and the collections rose from \u00a321,896 to \u00a393,461 (Rs. 2,18,960 to Rs. 9,34,610); \u00a3104 (Rs. 1040) were remitted and \u00a312,665 (Rs. 1,26,650) left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 15 to 18 pounds.\n\nIn 1878-79 the rainfall was 36 inches. The early sowings were almost entirely destroyed by heavy rain in October. Heavy rain also reduced the area of the late crops and those that were raised suffered so greatly from the ravages of rats that Government had to take measures to relieve the distress. The year was unhealthy with severe epidemics of cholera and fever. The tillage area fell from 2,138,788 to 2,136,988 acres and the collections from \u00a393,461 to \u00a372,749 (Rs. 9,34,610 to Rs. 7,27,490); \u00a399 (Rs. 990) were remitted and \u00a333,239 (Rs. 3,32,390) left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 18 to 29 pounds.\n\nIn 1879-80 the rainfall of 23 inches was unseasonable. The early crops were inferior and the rice poor. The late harvest was generally good and the watered crops, except where they were slightly damaged by frost, were excellent. The plague of rats continued long enough to damage the early crops. The year was unhealthy. The tillage area fell from 2,136,988 to 1,901,402 acres and the collections rose from \u00a372,749 to \u00a388,757 (Rs. 7,27,490 to Rs. 8,87,570); \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) were remitted and \u00a39113 (Rs. 91,130) left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 29 to 57 pounds.\n\nIn 1880-81 the rainfall of 28 inches was somewhat above the average but most of it fell so late as to interfere with the sowing of the early crops. The late harvest, which at one time promised well, was damaged by heavy and unseasonable rain in November. The harvest was middling and the season healthy. The tillage area fell from 1,901,402 to 1,833,263 acres and the collections rose from \u00a388,757 to \u00a395,852 (Rs. 8,87,570 to Rs. 9,58,520); \u00a3114 (Rs. 1140) were remitted and \u00a31518 (Rs. 15,180) left outstanding. Jv\u00e1ri rupee prices fell from 57 to 71 pounds.\nIn 1881-82 the rainfall was 23 inches. Late crops were generally good. The tillage area rose from 1,833,263 to 1,873,096 acres and the collections from \u00a395,852 to \u00a397,889 (Rs. 9,58,520 to Rs. 9,78,890); \u00a3105 (Rs. 1050) were remitted and \u00a3235 (Rs. 2350) left outstanding.

Of the 1882-83 remissions, \u00a324,594 (Rs. 2,45,940) were granted to reduce for three years ending 1882-83 the enhancement under revision settlements within twenty per cent of the former assessment.\n\n(b) In this year the district was increased by the addition of the M\u00e1liras sub-division from S\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nOf fifty-three alienated villages, thirty are owned by Br\u00e1hmans, twelve by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, five by Muhammadans, and three by Vanj\u00e1ris. The revenue of two alienated villages in M\u00e1liras is set apart for the god Mah\u00e1dev and is under the management of a devasth\u00e1n or temple-committee. The revenue of Shegaon in Pandharpur is set apart for the benefit of the Pandharpur dispensary under Government Resolution 1030 of the 15th of March 1860. Many alienated villages are held by undivided families; not more than twelve villages are divided among the sharers. Except four in M\u00e1liras which have been mortgaged few alienated villages have either been mortgaged or sold. In all but a few cases the proprietors live in and manage their villages. Neither in the condition of the people\n\n1 The Collector, 280 of 19th January and 2251 of 16th May 1884.\nnor in the character of the tillage is there any notable difference between alienated and neighbouring Government villages. In a few cases the soil of the alienated villages may be a little better than that of surrounding Government villages. No alienated villages seem to have grades of tenants. All holders of land in alienated villages enjoy equal rights with respect to the ownership of the land. Yearly tenants are almost unknown except in the few fields that stand in the proprietor's name and are tilled by yearly tenants. The bulk of the landholders pay a fixed rent. Hardly any proprietor has claimed a right to enhance the rates. Almost all rents are paid in cash. In surveyed alienated villages the rates do not in any way differ from those in neighbouring Government villages. In Karm\u00e1la the rates in unsurveyed villages are little higher than the rates of the original settlement, but much below those of the revision survey. In unsurveyed alienated villages the rates vary from 4\u00bdd. to 2s. (Re. \\( \\frac{1}{16} - 1 \\)) on dry-crop or jir\u00e1yat land and from 1s. 9d. to 3s. (Rs. \\( \\frac{7}{8} - 1 \\)) on garden or b\u00e1g\u00e1yat land. These garden rates are higher than those in the neighbouring Government villages. No special arrangements are in use to meet the case of a tenant improving his field, digging a well in it, or turning it from dry-crop to rice land. No higher assessment is levied should such improvements be carried out. The proprietor makes no arrangement with his tenants as to grazing their cattle or for cutting timber. The tenants reserve the waste part of their land for grazing and cut timber from their land. In most cases some g\u00e1ir\u00e1n or grazing numbers and some wastelands are every year sold by auction for grazing to the highest bidders. In surveyed alienated villages the Collector helps the in\u00e1md\u00e1r to recover his rent for the current year to the extent of the survey rates; in unsurveyed villages according to the rates agreed on between the in\u00e1md\u00e1r and his tenant. The aid given is in accordance with the provisions of the Land Revenue Code.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nBetween 1819 and 1824, for purposes of civil and criminal justice, Sholapur was under Poona. In 1825 a first or senior assistant judge was appointed for Sholapur. In 1842 Sholapur was made a separate district, excluding Pandharpur, Sangola, and Malsiras which were then under Satara and including besides other sub-divisions Indi, Sindgi, Bagevadi, and Muddebihal which are now under Bijapur. In that year the senior assistant judge gave place to a district judge. About 1848-49 Bijapur was added to Sholapur. About 1864-65 when Indi, Sindgi, Bijapur, Bagevadi, and Muddebihal were taken and included in the present Bijapur district and Pandharpur and Sangola were added to Sholapur, the district judge gave place to a joint judge. From March 1866 to March 1884 Sholapur was in charge of a senior assistant judge and joint sessions judge with the full powers of a District Judge. In 1875-76 Malsiras was added to Sholapur. From April 1884 Sholapur has been made a separate charge of a District Judge.\n\nAt present (1884) the district has a District Judge and six sub-judges. The sub-judges are all second class with powers to try original suits of not more than \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000). Of the six sub-judges one is for Malsiras and Sangola and the others are for Barsi, Karmala, Madha, Pandharpur, and Sholapur. From January 1883 the sub-judge for Malsiras and Sangola holds his court alternately for two months at Malote in Malsiras and at Sangola. Till the end of February 1883 there was one sub-judge for Karmala and Madha, holding his court alternately for one month at each station; since then Karmala has been in charge of a separate sub-judge. The average distance of the Sholapur sub-judge's court from its furthest six villages is thirty-two miles, of the Barsi court twenty-eight miles, of the Karmala court thirty miles, of the Madha court twenty-six miles, of the Pandharpur court twenty miles, and of the Malsiras and Sangola courts nineteen miles in Malsiras and twenty in Sangola.\n\nDuring the thirteen years ending 1882 the number of suits decided varied from 7116 in 1872 to 2172 in 1882 and averaged 4869. These thirteen years may be divided into three periods. In the first period of seven years ending 1876 the number of suits varied from 7116 in 1872 to 5553 in 1874 and averaged 6326. In the second period of three years ending 1879 the suits fell about forty per cent, varying from 4238 in 1878 to 3459 in 1877 and averaging 3816. And in the third period of three years ending 1882, owing to the introduction of the conciliators and village munsifs under the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act in 1879 the suits further fell by about thirty-four per cent, varying from 3002 in 1880 to 2172 in 1882 and averaging 2525. Of the total number of cases decided, fifty-seven per cent have on an average been given against the defendant in his absence, the percentage varying from 70.5 in 1872 to 6.2 in 1881. For the ten years ending 1879 the percentage varied from\n70\u00b75 in 1872 to 53\u00b79 in 1879; and for the next three years ending 1882, owing to the introduction of conciliators and village munsifs under Act XVII. of 1879 the percentage fell suddenly, varying from 10\u00b76 in 1880 to 6\u00b72 in 1881. The details are:\n\n**Sholapur Ex-parte Decrees, 1870-1882.**\n\n| Year | Suits | Decreed Ex-parte | Percentage |\n|------|-------|------------------|------------|\n| 1870 | 6822  | 4623             | 67\u00b78       |\n| 1871 | 5886  | 3958             | 67\u00b78       |\n| 1872 | 7116  | 5023             | 70\u00b75       |\n| 1873 | 6891  | 4770             | 69\u00b72       |\n| 1874 | 5553  | 3652             | 66\u00b77       |\n| 1875 | 6382  | 3832             | 61\u00b71       |\n| 1876 | 5761  | 3282             | 57\u00b72       |\n| 1877 | 3459  | 1069             | 56\u00b79       |\n| Average |      |                  |            |\n\nOf contested cases, during this period of thirteen years an average of 13\u00b76 per cent have been decided for the defendant, the percentage varying from 21\u00b76 in 1870 to 7\u00b72 in 1878. In 130 or six per cent of the suits decided in 1882 the decree was executed by putting the plaintiff in possession of the immovable property claimed. The number of this class of cases varied from fifty-nine out of 2401 in 1881 to 201 out of 6822 in 1870. In 337 or 15\u00b75 per cent of the 1882 decisions, decrees for money due were executed by the attachment or sale of property, 262 or twelve per cent being for immovable property and seventy-five or 3\u00b75 per cent for movable property. The number of attachments or sales of immovable property varied from 262 in 1882 to 2659 in 1875, and of movable property from seventy-five in 1882 to 543 in 1875. During the thirteen years ending 1882 the number of decrees executed by the arrest of debtors varied from eight in 1881 to 460 in 1870. For the first seven years ending 1876 this number fell steadily from 460 in 1870 to eighty-two in 1876. During the next six years (1877-1882) the number was between eight and twenty-nine with slight alternate rises and falls. The following table shows that during the same thirteen years (1870-1882) the number of civil prisoners varied from 145 in 1874 to twelve in 1881:\n\n**Sholapur Civil Prisoners, 1870-1882.**\n\n| Year | Prisoners | Days | Satisfying Decrees | Creditors' Requests | No Subsistence | Disclosure of Property | Time Expired |\n|------|-----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------|\n| 1870 | 192       | 26   | 13                 | 30                 | 70            | 4                      |             |\n| 1871 | 131       | 25   | 11                 | 44                 | 64            | 5                      |             |\n| 1872 | 106       | 34   | 6                  | 31                 | 60            | 4                      | 1           |\n| 1873 | 187       | 25   | 16                 | 25                 | 80            | 4                      |             |\n| 1874 | 145       | 32   | 11                 | 34                 | 75            | 11                     | 4           |\n| 1875 | 123       | 26   | 18                 | 35                 | 69            | 4                      |             |\n| 1876 | 69        | 41   | 6                  | 15                 | 47            | 1                      |             |\n| 1877 | 16        | 26   | 3                  | 4                  | 22            | 2                      |             |\n| 1878 | 31        | 24   | 3                  | 4                  | 22            | 2                      |             |\n| 1879 | 17        | 48   | 2                  | 3                  | 12            |                        |             |\n| 1880 | 29        | 13   | 3                  | 5                  | 91            |                        |             |\n| 1881 | 12        | 16   |                    |                    |               |                        |             |\n| 1882 | 17        | 18   | 3                  |                    |               |                        | 2           |\nThe following statement shows in tabular form the working of the district civil courts during the thirteen years ending 1882:\n\n### Sholapur Civil Courts, 1870-1882.\n\n| Year | Suits | Average Value in \u00a3/s | UNCONTESTED | CONTESTED | EXECUTION |\n|------|-------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n|      |       |                      | Decreed Ex parte | Decreed on Confession | For Plaintiff | For Defendant | Mixed | Total | Arrest of Debtor | Possession of Immoveable Property | Attachment or Sale of Property |\n| 1870 | 6832  | 9\u00b719                 | 4628         | 2          | 448       | 636        | 5914 | 642 | 186 | 30 | 858 | 460 | 201 | 1960 | 331 |\n| 1871 | 5536  | 10\u00b713                | 3958         | 3          | 506       | 663        | 5019 | 611 | 156 | 50 | 817 | 435 | 147 | 2056 | 491 |\n| 1872 | 7116  | 9\u00b711                 | 5023         | 3          | 829       | 596        | 6149 | 788 | 143 | 36 | 967 | 359 | 197 | 2165 | 518 |\n| 1873 | 6891  | 11\u00b74                | 4770         | 4          | 455       | 606        | 5025 | 758 | 120 | 88 | 966 | 207 | 145 | 2541 | 463 |\n| 1874 | 5553  | 8\u00b718                | 3852         | 2          | 283       | 618        | 4555 | 733 | 143 | 122 | 998 | 281 | 141 | 2079 | 380 |\n| 1875 | 6395  | 9\u00b77                 | 3832         | 136        | 332       | 892        | 5242 | 814 | 148 | 131 | 1093 | 165 | 128 | 2659 | 548 |\n| 1876 | 5751  | 9\u00b78                 | 217          | 313       | 4472       | 916        | 173 | 168 | 129 | 82 | 1296 | 356 | 129 | 2505 | 466 |\n| 1877 | 5459  | 10\u00b71                | 210          | 186       | 347        | 544        | 2034 | 347 | 144 | 106 | 821 | 264 | 124 | 1381 | 370 |\n| 1878 | 4248  | 11\u00b72                | 2391         | 118        | 391       | 469        | 3274 | 788 | 70 | 106 | 824 | 29 | 124 | 1381 | 370 |\n| 1879 | 3750  | 10\u00b71                | 2022         | 19         | 285       | 609        | 2032 | 670 | 66 | 82 | 818 | 10 | 104 | 1318 | 410 |\n| 1880 | 3002  | 9\u00b73                 | 321          | 135       | 673        | 1073       | 2202 | 567 | 94 | 139 | 500 | 28 | 96 | 756 | 224 |\n| 1881 | 2401  | 16\u00b717               | 151          | 7         | 545       | 858        | 1561 | 537 | 126 | 177 | 840 | 4 | 59 | 391 | 141 |\n| 1882 | 2172  | 14\u00b74                | 160          | 19        | 291       | 904        | 1864 | 493 | 112 | 203 | 808 | 12 | 130 | 262 | 75 |\n\nRegistration has two branches, one under Act III. of 1877 and the other termed village registration under the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act (Act XVII. of 1879). Under Act III. of 1877 the work of registration employs seven special or full-time sub-registrars, one being stationed at each of the sub-divisional head-quarters. According to the registration report for 1882-83 the gross receipts for that year under Act III. of 1877 amounted to \u00a3430 (Rs. 4300) and the charges to \u00a3405 (Rs. 4050), thus leaving a credit balance of \u00a325 (Rs. 250). Of the total number of 1523 registrations, 1302 related to immovable property, 190 to movable property, and thirty-one were wills. Of 1302 documents relating to immovable property 375 were mortgage deeds, 660 deeds of sale, thirty-three deeds of gift, 139 leases, and ninety-five miscellaneous deeds. Including \u00a344,996 (Rs. 4,49,960) the value of immovable property transferred, the total value of property affected by registration under Act III. of 1877 amounted to \u00a352,597 (Rs. 5,25,970). Under Act XVII. of 1879 village registration employs twenty-seven village registrars, all special or full-time officers. In every case a sub-registrar of assurances under Act III. of 1877 is ex-officio a village registrar, has within the limits of his charge as sub-registrar a jurisdiction similar to that of other village registrars, issues registration books to the village registrars of his circle, and embodies in one general form the monthly accounts of the village registrars. In 1882-83 the gross receipts under Act XVII. of 1879 amounted to \u00a3344 (Rs. 3440) and the charges to \u00a3647 (Rs. 6470), thus showing a deficit of \u00a3303 (Rs. 3030). Of 12,574 the total number of registrations, 7396 related to immovable property and 5178 to movable property. Of 7396 documents relating to immovable property, 1227 were mortgage deeds, 1431 deeds of sale, twenty-two deeds of gift, 4376 leases, and 340 miscellaneous deeds. Including \u00a346,657 (Rs. 4,66,570) the value of immovable property transferred, the total value of property affected by registration under Act XVII. of 1879 amounted\nto \u00a374,070 (Rs. 7,40,700). Owing to the introduction of village registration under Act XVII. of 1879, registration under Act III. of 1877 has considerably fallen. Compared with the figures of 1879, the year previous to the working of the Act XVII. of 1879, the 1882 registration figures under Act III. of 1877 show a fall of 2825 in registered documents, of \u00a3493 (Rs. 4930) in fees received, and of \u00a351,494 (Rs. 5,14,940) in the value of property affected by registration. Under Act XVII. of 1879 a special officer styled the inspector of village registry offices examines village registry offices. Over both branches of registration, in addition to the supervision by the Collector as District Registrar, a special scrutiny under the control of the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps is carried on by the divisional inspector.\n\nDuring the calendar year 1883, of the work done by the several officers appointed under the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act of 1879, thirty-four village registrars registered 7312 documents; seventy-seven conciliators disposed of 12,610 applications and under sections 44 and 45 of the Act forwarded 4085 agreements to courts; nineteen village munisfs decided 332 cases and under chapter II. of the Act six sub-judges decided 1648 cases.\n\nAt present (1883) nineteen officers share the administration of criminal justice. Of these, five, including the District Magistrate, are magistrates of the first class, and fourteen are magistrates of the second and third classes. Of the magistrates of the first class two are covenanted European civilians, and three, the assistant, the district, and the huzur deputy collectors, are Natives. The District Magistrate has the general supervision of the whole district and of the other first class magistrates, the huzur deputy collector has the charge of about eight square miles within Sholapur city limits and of 59,890 people, and others as assistant or deputy collectors have each an average charge of 1504 square miles and 174,199 people. In 1882 the District Magistrate decided fifty-four original and appeal cases and other first class magistrates 942 original and appeal cases. The average charge of the fourteen second and third class magistrates all of whom are Natives, was 646 square miles with a population of 83,212. In 1882 these magistrates decided 1000 original criminal cases. Besides their magisterial duties three officers exercise revenue powers as m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs, mah\u00e1lkaris, or head clerks of m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs. Besides these officers, from May 1883 a bench of three persons at Pandharpur has been given the powers of third class magistrates. In 1882-83, under section 14 of the Bombay Village Police Act (Act VIII. of 1867) 629 village headmen, or police p\u00e1t\u00eds were entrusted with power to imprison for twenty-four hours in the village office or ch\u00e1r\u00fadi. The average yearly emoluments of these village headmen in cash and land amount to about \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 24).\n\nThe district has no special criminal classes. Small wandering parties who have generally their head-quarters in the Niz\u00e1m's territory, constantly move through the district. They often commit thefts and take refuge with their stolen goods in the Niz\u00e1m's territory.\nIn the year 1882 the total strength of the district or regular police force was 527. The force consisted of the District Superintendent, one subordinate officer, ninety inferior subordinate officers, fifteen mounted and 421 foot constables. The cost of maintaining this force was for the Superintendent a total yearly salary of \u00a3637 8s. (Rs. 6374), for the subordinate officers on yearly salaries of not less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) and the inferior subordinate officers on yearly salaries of less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) a total yearly cost of \u00a32300 8s. (Rs. 23,004); and for the foot and mounted constables a cost of \u00a34737 12s. (Rs. 47,376). Besides their pay a total sum of \u00a3217 16s. (Rs. 2178) was yearly allowed for the horse and travelling allowances of the Superintendent; \u00a3234 (Rs. 2340) for the pay and travelling allowances of his establishment; \u00a3114 (Rs. 1140) for the horse and travelling allowances of subordinate officers; and \u00a3894 6s. (Rs. 8943) a year for contingencies and petty charges. Thus the yearly cost of maintaining the police force amounted to \u00a39135 10s. (Rs. 91,355). On an area of 4521 square miles and a population of 582,487 these figures give one constable for every 8:56 square miles and 1,103 people, and a cost of \u00a32 5d. (Rs. 20\u00bd) to the square mile or 3\u00bcd. (2\u00bd as.) to each head of the population. Of the total strength of 527 exclusive of the Superintendent, twenty-six, four officers and twenty-two men, were in 1882 employed as guards at district, central, or subsidiary jails; eighty-five, ten of them officers and seventy-five men, were engaged as guards over treasuries and lock-ups or as escorts to prisoners and treasure; 342, sixty-six of them officers and 276 men, were employed on other duties in the district; and seventy-four were stationed in towns, municipalities, and cantonments. Of the whole number, exclusive of the Superintendent, 244 were provided with fire-arms and forty-two with swords or with swords and batons; and 241 were provided with batons only; 117, of whom thirty were officers and eighty-seven men, could read and write, and eighty-seven men were under instruction.\n\nExcept the Superintendent who was a European, the members of the police force were all natives of India. Of these, thirty-four officers and 190 men were Muhammadans, seven officers and twelve men Br\u00e1hmans, eleven officers and forty-two men Rajputs, twenty-seven officers and 141 men Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, one officer a Prabhu, one man a Ling\u00e1yat, ten officers and fifty men Hindus of other castes, one officer a P\u00e1rsi, and one officer a Christian.\n\nThe returns for the nine years ending 1882 show a total of 102 murders and attempts to murder, thirty-five culpable homicides, 113 cases of grievous hurt, 386 gang and other robberies, and 21,716 other offences. During these nine years the total number of offences gave a yearly average of 2483 or one offence for every 234 of the population. The returns show that during the famine year of 1877 the total number of offences was unusually large, being 4083 or about sixty-four per cent more than the average.

The number of convicts in the Shol\u00e1pur jail on the 31st of December 1882 was 113, of whom ninety-five were males and eighteen females. During the year 1883, 204 convicts, of whom 178 were males and twenty-six females, were admitted and 215, of whom 186 were males and twenty-nine females, were discharged. During the year the daily average of prisoners was 107 and at the close of the year the number of convicts was 102, of whom eighty-seven were males.\nand fifteen females. Of 204 convicts admitted during the year 156 males and twenty-three females were sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, ten males and two females were for over one year and not more than two years; nine males were for more than two years and not more than five years; and two males and one female were under sentence of transportation, and one male was sentenced to death. The total yearly cost of diet was \u00a3156 6s. (Rs. 1563) or an average of \u00a31 9s. (Rs. 14\u00bd) for each prisoner.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nFINANCE.\n\nChapter X.\nFinance.\n\nThe earliest balance sheet of the district is for 1870-71. Exclusive of \u00a330,037 (Rs. 3,00,370), the adjustment on account of alienated lands, the total transactions entered in the district balance sheet for 1881-82 amounted under receipts to \u00a3301,575 (Rs. 30,15,750) against \u00a3270,950 (Rs. 27,09,500) in 1870-71 and under charges to \u00a3308,199 (Rs. 30,81,990) against \u00a3286,060 (Rs. 28,60,600). Leaving aside departmental miscellaneous receipts and payments in return for services rendered, such as post and telegraph receipts, the revenue for the year 1881-82 under the heads Imperial, provincial, local, and municipal, came to \u00a3167,854 (Rs. 16,78,540) or on the 1881 population of 582,487 an individual share of 5s. 4d. (Rs. 2\u00bd). During the twelve years between 1870 and 1881 the following changes have taken place under the chief heads of receipts and charges.\n\nLAND.\n\nLand Revenue receipts which form 68.03 per cent of the whole revenue of the district, have risen from \u00a390,153 (Rs. 9,01,530) in 1870-71 to \u00a3106,059 (Rs. 10,60,590) in 1881-82 and charges from \u00a317,030 (Rs. 1,70,300) to \u00a317,168 (Rs. 1,71,680).\n\nSTAMP.\n\nStamp receipts have fallen from \u00a318,859 to \u00a37430 (Rs. 1,88,590-Rs. 74,300), and charges from \u00a3642 to \u00a3227 (Rs. 6420-Rs. 2270).\n\nEXCISE.\n\nExcise receipts, chiefly owing to better supervision, have increased from \u00a36060 (Rs. 60,600) to \u00a313,500 (Rs. 1,35,000). In 1881-82 the charges amounted to \u00a3852 (Rs. 8520). Of seventy shops eight are licensed to sell Europe and other foreign imported liquor, twenty-seven to sell country spirit, twelve to sell toddy, and twenty-three to sell intoxicating drugs. The European and foreign liquor is brought from Bombay. At the Sholapur central distillery built in 1878 at a cost of \u00a321,25 (Rs. 21,250), the farmer under Government supervision makes spirit from mahuda or flowers of the Bassia latifolia and supplies it to all district shops. In 1882-83, from this distillery 43,743 gallons of spirits were issued, 24,151 gallons being of 25\u00b0 under proof that is under London proof, and 19,592 gallons of 50\u00b0 under proof. On each gallon of 25\u00b0 under proof the farmer pays a still-head duty of 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) and sells at any price up to 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) a gallon. From the 1st of August 1884 this still-head duty will be increased to 6s. (Rs. 3), the selling price remaining the same as before; and spirit of 60\u00b0 instead of 50\u00b0 under proof will be issued,\n\n---\n\n1 Of the territorial changes made in the district between 1870 and 1882, Malsira with a land revenue of about \u00a315,320 (Rs. 1,53,200) was transferred to Sholapur in 1875-76.\n\n2 This total includes the following items: \u00a3121,080 land revenue, excise, assessed taxes, and forest; \u00a35627 stamps, justice, and registration; \u00a31313 education and police; and \u00a336,834 local and municipal funds; total \u00a3167,854.\n\n3 Yearly land revenue collections are given above, p. 365.\n\n4 The alcoholic strength of liquor is denoted by degrees over or under the standard of London proof which is taken as 100 degrees. Thus 25\u00b0 U. P., that is under proof is equivalent to 75 degrees of strength, 50\u00b0 U. P. is equivalent to 50 degrees of strength; and 25\u00b0 O. P., or over proof, is equivalent to 125 degrees of strength.\npaying a still-head duty of 3s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 1 1/6) a gallon and being saleable at 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) a gallon. Toddy is chiefly drawn locally from brab and date trees, brab trees being tapped on paying a yearly tax of 6s. (Rs. 3) a tree and date trees of 2s. (Re. 1). In 1892-83 about 6000 trees were locally tapped against 7800 in 1881-82. Under special permission the farmers also import toddy from the Nizam's territory. Of the intoxicating drugs the chief are bh\u0101ng or drinking hemp, g\u1e5b\u1e45ja or smoking hemp, m\u0101jum that is spices mixed with bh\u0101ng boiled in clarified butter, and bhoja that is an intoxicating liquid made by boiling in water bh\u0101ng, old jv\u0101ri, gulvel or Menispermum glabrum, and kachola or Curcuma zedoaria.\n\nLaw and Justice receipts, chiefly fines, have fallen from \u00a31114 (Rs.11,140) to \u00a3679 (Rs. 6790) and charges owing to an increase in the pay of the officers and staff have risen from \u00a37577 (Rs. 75,770) to \u00a310,003 (Rs. 1,00,030).\n\nForest receipts have risen from \u00a317 (Rs. 170) to \u00a3624 (Rs. 6240) and charges from \u00a34 (Rs. 40) to \u00a32215 (Rs. 22,150).\n\nThe following table shows, exclusive of the tax on official salaries, the amount realized from assessed taxes levied between 1870-71 and 1881-82. Owing to the variety of the rates and incidence it is difficult to make any satisfactory comparison of the results. No tax was levied between 1873-74 and 1877-78:\n\n| Year       | Amount |\n|------------|--------|\n| Income Tax |        |\n| 1870-71    | \u00a36012  |\n| 1871-72    | \u00a31954  |\n| License Tax|        |\n| 1878-79    | \u00a37472  |\n| 1879-80    | \u00a33657  |\n| 1880-81    | \u00a33947  |\n| 1881-82    | \u00a33377  |\n\nOpium receipts have risen from \u00a32541 (Rs.25,410) to \u00a33519 Customs, (Rs. 35,190).\n\nMilitary receipts have fallen from \u00a31791 (Rs. 17,910) to \u00a3757 (Rs. 7570) and charges from \u00a317,188 (Rs. 1,71,880) to \u00a34526 (Rs. 45,260).\n\nPost receipts have risen from \u00a32226 (Rs. 22,260) to \u00a37705 (Rs. 77,050) and charges from \u00a31443 (Rs. 14,430) to \u00a38192 (Rs. 81,920). The receipts and charges shown in the 1881-82 balance sheet, besides letters books and parcels, include money received and paid under the money order system.\n\nIn 1881-82 telegraph receipts amounted to \u00a3305 (Rs. 3050) and charges to \u00a31873 (Rs. 18,730).\n\nRegistration receipts have fallen from \u00a31156 (Rs. 11,560) to \u00a3518 (Rs. 5180) and charges have increased from \u00a3664 (Rs. 6640) to \u00a3849 (Rs. 8490).\n\nIn 1881-82 education receipts amounted to \u00a3719 (Rs. 7190) and charges to \u00a31572 (Rs. 15,720).\n\nPolice receipts have risen from \u00a31 (Rs. 10) to \u00a3594 (Rs. 5940), and charges from \u00a3254 (Rs. 52,540) to \u00a39972 (Rs. 99,720).\n\nMedical receipts have been almost none, and charges have fallen from \u00a31893 (Rs. 18,930) to \u00a3908 (Rs. 9080).\nChapter X.\nFinance.\n\nTRANSFER.\n\nJail receipts have fallen from \u00a3714 (Rs. 7140) to \u00a3441 (Rs. 4410) and charges have risen from \u00a31050 (Rs. 10,500) to \u00a34030 (Rs. 40,300).\n\nTransfer receipts have risen from \u00a3123,588 (Rs. 12,35,880) to \u00a3145,714 (Rs. 14,57,140) and transfer charges from \u00a3173,418 (Rs. 17,34,180) to \u00a3205,871 (Rs. 20,58,710). The increase under receipts is due to receipts on account of local funds and cash remittances from other districts. The increase under charges is due to charges on account of the local funds and to a large surplus balance remitted to other treasuries.\n\nBALANCE SHEET,\n1870 AND 1881.\n\nIn the following balance sheet the figures shown in black type on both sides under 1881-82 are book adjustments. On the receipt side the item of \u00a330,037 (Rs. 3,00,370) represents the additional revenue the district would yield had none of its lands been alienated. On the debit side the item of \u00a36607 (Rs. 66,070) under land revenue and \u00a31246 (Rs. 12,460) under police are the rentals of lands granted for service to village headmen and watchmen. The item of \u00a322,184 (Rs. 2,21,840) shown under allowances and assignments, represents the rental of lands granted to hereditary officers whose services have been dispensed with and of religious and charitable land-grants. Cash allowances to village and district officers who render service are treated as actual charges and debited to land revenue:\n\nSholapur Balance Sheet, 1870-71 and 1881-82.\n\n| Head | 1870-71 | 1881-82 |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| Land Revenue | 90,158 | 106,059 |\n| Stamps | 18,859 | 7,430 |\n| Excise | 754 | 10,820 |\n| Justice | 1114 | 679 |\n| Forests | 17 | 824 |\n| Assessed Taxes | 6575 | 3570 |\n| Miscellaneous | 294 | 770 |\n| Interest | 30 | 558 |\n| Opium | 2541 | 3519 |\n| Salt | | |\n| Public Works | 14,389 | 9800 |\n| Military | 1791 | 757 |\n| Mint | | |\n| Post | 2226 | 7705 |\n| Telegraph | | 305 |\n| Registration | 1156 | 518 |\n| Education | 719 | |\n| Police | 1 | 594 |\n| Medicine | | 1 |\n| Jails | 714 | 441 |\n| Tributes from Native States | | 1390 |\n| Stationery and Printing | | 28 |\n| Superannuation Receipts | | 58 |\n| Total | 147,362 | 155,861 |\n\n| Head | 1870-71 | 1881-82 |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| Land Revenue | 17,030 | 17,168 |\n| Stamps | 642 | 227 |\n| Excise | 435 | |\n| Justice | 7577 | 6416 |\n| Forestry | | 2216 |\n| Assessed Taxes | 68 | 10 |\n| Allowances | 16 | 6956 |\n| Pensions | 1442 | 1465 |\n| Ecclesiastical | 52 | 22 |\n| Miscellaneous | 839 | 480 |\n| Public Works | 38,422 | 32,006 |\n| Military | 17,158 | 4926 |\n| Post | | |\n| Telegraph | 1702 | 1873 |\n| Registration | 664 | 849 |\n| Education | 1239 | 1572 |\n| Police | 5254 | 9073 |\n| Medicine | 1893 | 908 |\n| Jails | 1050 | 4030 |\n| Printing | | 6 |\n| Opium | | 8 |\n| Total | 112,649 | 103,328 |\n\n| Transfer Items. |\n|-----------------|\n| Local Funds | 9482 | 13,168 |\n| Deposits | 8547 | 6170 |\n| Cash Remittances | 97,050 | 114,378 |\n| Transfer Receipts Including Savings Bank | 8508 | 13,008 |\n| Total | 123,588 | 145,714 |\n\n| Transfer Items. |\n|-----------------|\n| Local Funds | 8555 | 11,181 |\n| Deposits | 7332 | 5491 |\n| Cash Remittances | 117,292 | 169,860 |\n| Transfer Receipts | 41,729 | 19,589 |\n| Total | 173,418 | 205,871 |\n\n| GRAND TOTAL | 270,950 | 301,575 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|\n|             | 30,037 |         |\n\n| GRAND TOTAL | 286,060 | 308,190 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|\n|             | 30,037 |         |\nSHOL\u00c1PUR.\n\nREVENUE OTHER THAN IMPERIAL.\n\nDistrict local funds which since 1863 have been collected to promote rural education and supply roads, wells, drains, rest-houses, village offices or ch\u0101wdis and other useful works, amounted in 1881-82 to \u00a312,163 (Rs. 1,21,630) and the expenditure to \u00a311,181 (Rs. 1,11,810). The local fund revenue is derived from three sources, a special cess of one-sixteenth in addition to the land tax, the proceeds of certain subordinate local funds, and certain miscellaneous items. The special land cess, of which two-thirds are set apart as a road fund and the rest as a school fund, in 1881-82 yielded a revenue of \u00a37690 (Rs. 76,900). The subordinate funds, including a toll fund, a ferry fund, a cattle pound fund, and a school fee fund, yielded \u00a32680 (Rs. 26,800). Government and private contributions amounted to \u00a31760 (Rs. 17,600) and miscellaneous receipts, including sand and quarry fees, to \u00a333 (Rs. 330). In 1881-82 this revenue was administered by district and sub-divisional committees partly of official and partly of private members. The district committee consists of the Collector, assistant and deputy collectors, the executive engineer and the educational inspector as official and the proprietor of an alienated village and six landholders as non-official members.

Of these one was a deputy educational inspector with general charge over all the schools of the district drawing a yearly pay of \u00a3180 (Rs. 1800), and the rest were masters and assistant masters with yearly salaries ranging from \u00a34 16s. to \u00a350 8s. (Rs. 48 - 504).\n\nOf 176 the total number of Government schools, in 171 Marathi only was taught, in one Hindustani, and in four English and Marathi. One of the four English schools was a high school teaching English, Marathi, and Sanskrit up to the matriculation standard. Of the 171 Marathi schools 167 were for boys and four were for girls.\n\nExcluding superintendence charges, the total expenditure on account of these schools amounted to \u00a34236 18s. (Rs. 42,369), of which \u00a31387 4s. (Rs. 13,872) were paid by Government, \u00a31407 10s. (Rs. 14,075) from local funds, and \u00a31442 4s. (Rs. 14,422) from other funds.\n\nBesides these Government schools there were four primary schools inspected by the educational department. Of these two were opened by missionaries, and in 1882-83 were attended by fifty-seven scholars with an average attendance of thirty-seven. There is one special school for low-caste boys established by missionaries in Sholapur. In other towns and villages where low-caste boys show willingness to attend, a school accommodation is made for them in the verandas of the school houses. Their presence is not generally objected to if arrangements are made to prevent their coming into personal contact with boys of other castes.\n\nIn 1855-56 there were only eleven Government schools, ten of them vernacular and one anglo-veracular with 804 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 617 pupils. In 1865-66 the\nnumber of schools was increased to forty-five with 2377 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 1799 pupils. Forty of these schools were vernacular and five anglo-veracular. In 1875-76 the number of schools rose to ninety-six, the names on the rolls to 3935, and the average attendance to 2850. In 1882-83 there were 176 schools with 7914 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 5708. Compared with 1855-56 the returns for 1882-83 give an increase in the number of schools from eleven to 176 and in the names on the rolls from 804 to 7914.\n\nIn 1869 the first girls school was opened in B\u00e1rsi. In the next ten years the number of girls schools rose to three with 111 names on the rolls and an average attendance of sixty-nine. In 1882-83 the number of girls schools increased to four with 176 names and an average attendance to 105.\n\nThe 1881 census returns give for the chief races of the district the following proportion of persons able to read and write. Of 537,635 the total Hindu population, 7011 (males 6853, females 158) or 1\u00b730 per cent below fifteen and 1303 (males 1292, females 11) or 0\u00b724 per cent above fifteen were under instruction; 865 (males 849, females 16) or 0\u00b716 per cent below fifteen and 16,978 (males 16,888, females 90) or 3\u00b715 per cent above fifteen were instructed; 191,267 (males 95,260, females 96,007) or 35\u00b757 per cent below fifteen and 320,211 (males 150,903, females 169,308) or 59\u00b755 per cent above fifteen were illiterate.

of Sholapur there were in 1882-83 ten Government schools with 932 names and an average attendance of about 693. Of these one was a high school, six were Marathi schools five for boys and one for girls, one a Hindustani school, one a police school, and one a jail school. The average yearly cost of each pupil in the high school was \u00a34 18s. (Rs. 49); in the other schools the cost varied from 14s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 7-12). Since 1868, sixteen pupils have passed the university entrance examination from the Sholapur high school. In addition to the Government schools there were, in 1882-83, forty private schools in the town of Sholapur with 1391 names and an average attendance of about 1029 pupils where Marathi is taught. The municipality of Sholapur has opened a Sanskrit school. In 1882-83 there were twenty-four pupils. The average yearly cost per pupil was 16s. (Rs. 8).\n\n---\n\n1 The details are: two in 1868; two in 1871; one in 1872; one in 1873; two in 1874; one in 1875; one in 1876; two in 1879; one in 1882; and three in 1883.\nMarathi boys schools in the city of Sholapur is attached a Gujarati class the expenses of which are defrayed by the Sholapur municipality. In 1882-83 there were twelve pupils learning Gujarati. In the town of B\u00e1rsi there were, in 1882-83, four Government schools with 323 names and an average attendance of 256. The average yearly cost to each pupil was 16s. 3d. (Rs. 8\u00bd). In the town of Pandharpur there were five Government schools with 487 names and an average attendance of 343. The average yearly cost to each pupil was 16s. (Rs. 8). In the town of Karkam there was one Government school with eighty-six names and an average attendance of sixty-nine. The average yearly cost to each pupil was 11s. 9d. (Rs. 5\u00bd). In the town of Vair\u00e1g there was one Government school with eighty names and an average attendance of fifty-nine.

The average yearly cost to each pupil was 12s. 9d. (Rs. 6\u00bd).\n\nExclusive of the eight towns of Sholapur, B\u00e1rsi, Pandharpur, Karkam, Vair\u00e1g, Karm\u00e1la, M\u00e1dha, and S\u00e1ngola, the district of Sholapur was in 1882-83 provided with 154 Government schools or an average of one school for every four inhabited villages. The following statement shows the distribution of these schools by sub-divisions:\n\n| Sub-Division | Villages | Population | Schools |\n|--------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| Sholapur     | 151      | 94,946     | 92      |\n| B\u00e1rsi        | 121      | 84,212     | 24      |\n| Karm\u00e1la      | 122      | 61,610     | 25      |\n| M\u00e1dha        | 87       | 62,794     | 27      |\n| Pandharpur   | 83       | 48,103     | 18      |\n| Total        |          |            |         |\n\nBesides the Sholapur library established in 1857, there are libraries at Pandharpur and B\u00e1rsi and reading-rooms at Karm\u00e1la and Vair\u00e1g. The Sholapur library was established by the leading inhabitants of the place. It is maintained by subscriptions and an annual grant of \u00a330 (Rs. 300) by the municipality. There are 1450 books English and vernacular, and ten newspapers and two monthly magazines are subscribed. The yearly subscriptions amount to \u00a315 (Rs. 150). The Pandharpur Library was established in 1874 by the sub-judge R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur L\u00e1shankar Umi\u00e1shankar. It is maintained by monthly subscriptions and a municipal contribution of \u00a320 (Rs. 200). It is provided with a hall by the municipality. There are 1015 books English and vernacular, and nine newspapers are subscribed. The yearly subscriptions amount to \u00a320 (Rs. 200). The B\u00e1rsi library was established in 1863 by the sub-judge R\u00e1o S\u00e1heb Venkatr\u00e1v Jiv\u00e1ji. It is maintained by monthly sub-\nscriptions and an annual municipal contribution of \u00a36 (Rs. 60). There are 205 books in the library, and seven newspapers are subscribed. A fine hall has lately been built for the library from municipal funds at the suggestion of R\u00e1o S\u00e1heb Krishnar\u00e1v Mule, the acting m\u00e1matd\u00e1r of B\u00e1rsi. The yearly subscriptions amount to \u00a36 (Rs. 60). The reading-room at Vair\u00e1g was opened in 1864, and that at Karm\u00e1la in 1881. These reading-rooms each subscribe to about seven newspapers. The number of books is small.\n\nOf the three weekly newspapers two are published at Shol\u00e1pur, the Kalpa-taru or Wish Tree on Sundays and the Bh\u00e1la or Spear on Thursdays; and one, the Pandhari-vritta or the News of Pandharpur, is published on Sundays at Pandharpur. They are all lithographed and in the Mar\u00e1thi language.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nOr endemic diseases the chief is guineaworm, which most frequently attacks the inhabitants of the hilly parts of B\u00e1rsi and Karm\u00e1la. The disease chiefly originates from the use of bad turbid water. Most of the wells especially in the B\u00e1rsi sub-division have steps. Though regular bathing is not allowed in these wells, the people stand on the steps below the surface of the water whilst they bathe their limbs and clean their dirty vessels. In the water which thus becomes constantly more and more contaminated are generated hundreds of guineaworms which attach themselves to the naked limbs of those standing on the steps and burrow under the skin. In most parts of the district at the end of rains from about October intermittent fever prevails for two or three months. The fever is caused chiefly by the sudden changes of temperature and the setting in of the easterly winds. It is not severe and is usually without splenic or other complications. Skin diseases, specially scabies and ringworm, prevail more or less throughout the district. Formerly an epidemic of cholera nearly always broke out at Pandharpur during the annual fairs, especially at the chief fair in July; but of late, owing to better sanitary arrangements, though outbreaks of cholera have not been altogether prevented, the disease generally appears in a mild form. Small-pox, as a rule, does not prevail as an epidemic.\n\nIn 1882, besides the Shol\u00e1pur civil hospital there were four dispensaries one each at Shol\u00e1pur, Pandharpur, B\u00e1rsi, and Karm\u00e1la. The number of patients treated was 50,626, of whom 50,037 were out-patients and 589 in-patients. The cost was \u00a31511 (Rs. 15,110). The following details are taken from the 1882 report:\n\nThe prevailing diseases treated in the Shol\u00e1pur civil hospital were skin and eye diseases, malarious fevers, injuries, ulcers, rheumatic and respiratory affections, intestinal worms, and bowel complaints. In 1882 cholera appeared after the Pandharpur fair in July and continued throughout the district till the end of August and out of sixty cases treated in the civil hospital twenty-five proved fatal. 1764 primary and 158 revaccinations were performed and 6585 out-patients and 347 in-patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3353 (Rs. 3530).\n\n---\n\n1 Of the outbreaks in 1871-72 and 1872-73, in 1871-72 cholera broke twice. The first outbreak lasted from the 27th of July to the 18th of August, during which forty-four persons were attacked and eighteen died; the second outbreak was in March during which three persons were attacked and one died. In 1872-73 cholera prevailed largely and broke four times. The first outbreak lasted from the 1st of April to the 25th of June, during which seventy-one persons were attacked and twenty died; the second lasted from the 17th to the end of July, during which forty-nine persons were attacked and twenty-five died; the third lasted from the 8th to the end of August, during which four persons were attacked and all recovered; and the fourth lasted from the 8th to the 16th of November during which two persons were attacked and one died.\nThe Shol\u00e1pur dispensary was opened in 1863. The prevailing diseases are malarious fever, skin diseases, respiratory affections, and bowel complaints. In 1892 cholera prevailed from July to September and out of eighty-one cases thirty-six proved fatal. 13,371 out-patients and 111 in-patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3327 (Rs. 3270).\n\nThe Pandharpur dispensary was opened in 1863 in a hired building. The prevailing diseases are malarious fever, intestinal worms, and skin and eye diseases. In 1882 cholera prevailed from the 6th of July to the 11th of August and there were fifty-seven deaths out of 101 cases. 10,112 out-patients and fifty in-patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3475 (Rs. 4750).\n\nThe B\u00e1rsi dispensary was opened in 1866. The prevailing diseases are malarious fevers, ophthalmia, skin diseases, respiratory affections, and bowel complaints. In 1882 cholera prevailed from the 16th of July to the 26th of August and out of sixty-five cases twenty proved fatal. 13,406 out-patients and forty in-patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3228 (Rs. 2280).\n\nThe Karm\u00e1la dispensary was opened in 1872 in a hired building. The prevailing diseases are malarious fevers, eye and skin diseases, rheumatism, intestinal worms, and bowel complaints. In 1882 cholera prevailed in July and August in a mild form. 143 persons were vaccinated, and 6563 out-patients and forty-one in-patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3128 (Rs. 1280).\n\nBesides the four dispensaries within British limits, the Akalkot native state dispensary was opened in 1870. The commonest diseases were malarious fevers, conjunctivitis, respiratory affections, bowel complaints, and skin diseases. Cholera although prevalent in the neighbourhood did not visit the town. Nearly 300 primary and 200 revaccinations were performed during the year. 7276 outdoor and fifty-seven in-door patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3186 12s. (Rs. 1866).\n\nAccording to the 1881 census 2116 persons (males 1200, females 916) or 0\u00b736 per cent of the population were infirm. Of the total number 1962 (males 1099, females 863) were Hindus, 153 (males 100, females 53) Musalm\u00e1ns, and one Christian male only. Of 2116, the total number of infirm persons, 79 (males 58, females 21) or 3\u00b773 per cent were of unsound mind, 1282 (males 614, females 668) or 60\u00b758 per cent were blind, 354 (males 210, females 144) or 16\u00b772 per cent were deaf and dumb, and 401 (males 318, females 83) or 18\u00b795 per cent were lepers. The details are:\n\n| Class       | Hindus | Musalm\u00e1ns | Christians | Total |\n|-------------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|\n|             | Males  | Females   | Males      | Females | Males | Females |\n| Insane ...  | 48     | 20        | 10         | 1      | 58    | 21      |\n| Blind ...   | 573    | 630       | 40         | 38     | 614   | 663     |\n| Deaf-Mutes  | 190    | 135       | 20         | 9      | 210   | 144     |\n| Lepers ...  | 288    | 78        | 30         | 5      | 318   | 83      |\n| Total ...   | 1099   | 863       | 100        | 53     | 1200  | 916     |\n\nShol\u00e1pur Infirm People, 1881.\nIn 1883-84 under the supervision of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Deccan Registration District, the work of vaccination was carried on by twelve vaccinators with yearly salaries varying from \u00a316 16s. (Rs. 168) to \u00a328 16s. (Rs. 288). Of these operators nine were distributed over the rural parts of the district, and of the remaining three, one worked at each of the towns of Shol\u00e1pur B\u00e1rsi and Pandharpur and also in some of the villages within a radius of three miles round the town. Besides the vaccinators the medical officer of the Karm\u00e1la dispensary carried on vaccine operations. The total number of persons vaccinated was 26,000 besides 438 revaccinations, compared with 13,435 primary vaccinations in 1869-70. The following statement shows the sex, religion, and age of the persons primarily vaccinated:\n\n| Year | Sex | Religion | Age |\n|------|-----|----------|-----|\n|      |     |          |     |\n|      |     |          |     |\n|      |     |          |     |\n\nIn 1883-84 the total cost of these operations, exclusive of those performed in the Karm\u00e1la dispensary, was \u00a3604 14s. (Rs. 6047) or about 5\u00bdd. (3\u00bd as.) for each successful case. The charges included the following items: supervision and inspection \u00a3243 12s. (Rs. 2436), establishment \u00a3351 8s. (Rs. 3514), and contingencies \u00a39 14s. (Rs. 97). Of these the supervising and inspecting charges were met from Government provincial funds, while \u00a3265 18s. (Rs. 2659) were borne by the local funds of the different sub-divisions and \u00a395 4s. (Rs. 952) by the municipalities of Shol\u00e1pur B\u00e1rsi and Pandharpur towns for the services of a vaccinator in each of these towns.\n\nSeven sorts of cattle disease are known in the district: vary\u00e1cha rog or motha rog or great disease, khurkut or hoof disease, gh\u00e1tsarp rog or putrid sorethroat, dhavar rog or swelling of the throat, ghuri rog or epilepsy, m\u00e1nmodi or neck-breaking disease, and parkida or intestinal worms. Of these vary\u00e1cha rog is most fatal. The symptoms are diarrhoea, running at the mouth, inability to eat, and sinking of the eyes. The body assumes a dark colour. The disease lasts one to three days. In khurkut or hoof-disease the mouth tongue and hoofs of the animal are affected. It lasts about fifteen days and if precautions are not taken in time the hoofs fall off. In gh\u00e1tsarp rog and dhavar rog or the swelling of the throat which are uncommon, the animal refuses food and dies in one or two days. In ghuri rog or epilepsy the animal respires with difficulty, refuses food, and dies after two or three days. In m\u00e1nmodi which lasts for a day only, the animal is unable to remain erect. Parkida is a worm which causes colic and purging. The disease generally ends fatally in three hours.\n\n1 Collector's Letter to the Revenue Commissioner, 2337 of 18th October 1870.\nThe total number of deaths shown in the Sanitary Commissioner's yearly reports, for the eighteen years ending 1883, is 254,877 or an average mortality of 14,159, or, according to the 1881 census, of twenty-four in every thousand of the population. During the famine year of 1877 the total number of deaths was very high, being 35,054 or 147 per cent above the average. Of the average number of deaths 7777 or 54\u00b792 per cent were returned as due to fevers, 1217 or 8\u00b759 per cent to cholera, 881 or 2\u00b769 per cent to small-pox, 1451 or 10\u00b724 per cent to bowel complaints, 212 or 1\u00b749 per cent to violence and injuries, and 3121 or 22\u00b704 per cent to miscellaneous diseases. An examination of the returns shows that fever, which during the eighteen years ending 1883 caused an average yearly mortality of 7777 or 54\u00b792 per cent, was below the average in the first nine years ending 1874 and above the average in the next nine years ending 1883. Of the nine years below the average two years 1866 and 1867 had between 2000 and 3000 deaths; two years 1868 and 1869 between 3000 and 4000; two years 1870 and 1871 between 4000 and 5000; one year 1873 between 5000 and 6000; and two years 1872 and 1874 between 6000 and 7000. Of the other nine years above the average two years 1880 and 1882 had between 7800 and 8000 deaths; two years 1875 and 1881 between 8000 and 9000; two years 1876 and 1883 between 10,000 and 11,000; one 1879 between 12,000 and 13,000; one 1877 between 16,000 and 17,000; and one 1878 between 17,000 and 18,000. Of the deaths from cholera, which amounted to 21,904 and averaged 1217, nine years caused deaths above the average and nine below the average. Of the nine years above the average two years 1875 and 1878 had between 4000 and 3000 deaths; three years 1869, 1876, and 1883 between 3000 and 2000; and four years 1866, 1872, 1877, and 1881 between 2000 and 1300. Of the nine years below the average one year 1868 had between 800 and 700 deaths; three years 1870, 1871, and 1882 between 500 and 200; three years 1867, 1879, and 1880 had less than fifty deaths; and two years 1873 and 1874 were free from cholera. Of the deaths from small-pox which amounted to 6863 and averaged 381, 2343 or 34\u00b714 per cent happened in 1872, 1214 or 17\u00b769 per cent in 1868, and 1080 or 15\u00b773 per cent in 1877. The only other years which were over the average were 1869 with 470 deaths, 1871 with 459 deaths, and 1867 with 448 deaths. Of the twelve years below the average two years 1870 and 1873 had between 300 and 200 deaths; two years 1866 and 1876 between 200 and 100; one 1883 between sixty and fifty; three years 1874, 1875, and 1878 between forty and ten; two years 1879 and 1882 had less than ten deaths; and two years 1880 and 1881 were free from small-pox.

It is bounded on all sides by the Niz\u00e1m's territory. It has an area of 596 square miles, a population in 1881 of 110,046 or 184 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a325,682 (Rs. 2,56,820).\n\nOf the 596 square miles 572 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, forty-two square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 319,488 acres or 90'11 per cent of arable land, 17,971 acres or 5'07 per cent of unarable land, 192 acres or 0'06 per cent of grass, 7999 acres or 2'26 per cent of forests, and 8887 acres or 2'50 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 319,488 acres of arable land, 19,881 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nB\u00e1rsi is separated from other parts of Shol\u00e1pur by a narrow belt of country belonging to the Niz\u00e1m. It lies between the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills in the east and the Sina in the west. Except some outlying villages in the north-east B\u00e1rsi is fairly regular in shape. From the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills in the north it stretches twenty-five to twenty-eight miles south, and from east to west it is about twenty-three miles. From the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills in the north and north-east the country slowly slopes south-west to the Sina. Between each of the streams which cross the sub-division is a succession of dips and rises from east to west, the rising and falling slopes becoming more and more gentle towards the eastern border. Except some parts which are bare, most of the sub-division, especially in the hollows, is well wooded. The villages are small and close, and lie chiefly on river banks. They are well shaded and almost all have walls seldom without gaps. Of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills which run north and north-east, the chief is the Vadshigh\u00e1t, about fourteen miles east of B\u00e1rsi and noted for a cave temple sacred to R\u00e1meshvar.\n\nProbably owing to its nearness to the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills, B\u00e1rsi has a better climate and more plentiful and regular rainfall than other parts of Shol\u00e1pur. At B\u00e1rsi in the north-west of the sub-division, during the eight years ending 1870 the rainfall varied from 43'19 inches in 1870 to 18'62 inches in 1868 and averaged 26'74 inches; and during the ten years ending 1882 it varied from forty-one inches in 1882 to twelve in 1876 and averaged twenty-nine inches.\n\nWater is abundant. The chief river is the Bhog\u00e1vati a feeder of the Sina, which, with its tributaries the Bedki, N\u00e1gzari, and Sira,\nrises in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t hills and runs south-east through the sub-division for about thirty miles. Besides this, the Chandni, a feeder of the Sina, runs in the north for about twelve miles. Most of these feeders keep water throughout the year. Besides by the Koregaon lake, about thirteen miles north-east of B\u00e1rsi, land is watered chiefly from wells and sometimes by fair weather channels or kachcha p\u0101ts from streams. In B\u00e1rsi town drinking water is supplied from a storage reservoir built close to the town.\n\nThe richest soil is found at the bottom of the slopes, which commonly become almost level along the banks of streams and are generally dotted with clumps of magnificent mango trees. It is generally black and fertile. Poor gravelly or barad soils are scarcely found. Even on the most barren parts is earth enough to yield good grass during the monsoon.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 213 riding and 2860 load carts, 748 two-bullock and 2796 four-bullock ploughs, 41,692 bullocks and 23,865 cows, 3619 he-buffaloes and 8526 she-buffaloes, 2166 horses, 36,512 sheep and goats, and 555 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 5818 with an average area of about 54 acres. Of the whole number, 155 were holdings of not more than five acres; 281 were of six to ten acres; 818 of eleven to twenty acres; 2493 of twenty-one to fifty acres; 1468 of fifty-one to 100 acres; 475 of 101 to 200 acres; 90 of 201 to 300 acres; 25 of 301 to 400 acres; and 13 of above 400 acres. The occupants who have holdings of over 100 acres are Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, Gujars, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Dhangars. As a rule the Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, and Gujars sublet their holdings.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 293,809 acres the whole area held for tillage, 47,619 acres or 16\u00b720 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 246,190 acres, 55 were twice cropped. Of the 246,245 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 161,593 acres or 65\u00b762 per cent, of which 134,000 were under Indian millet ju\u00fari Sorghum vulgare, 10,667 under spiked millet bajri Penicillaria spicata, 8042 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 5855 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 16 under maize makka Zea mays, 165 under r\u00e1la or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 580 under s\u00e1va and vari Panicum miliaceum, 153 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 2115 under other grains of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 32,481 acres or 13\u00b719 per cent of which 21,144 were under tur Cajanus indicus, 8188 under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 95 under kulthi or kulith Dolichos biflorus, 1837 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 609 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 3 under masur Ervum lens, 4 under peas v\u00e1t\u00e1na Pisum sativum, and 601 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 32,206 acres or 13\u00b707 per cent of which 2572 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum, 163 under gingelly seed til Sesamum indicum, and 29,471 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 15,689 acres or 6\u00b737 per cent of which 7646 were under cotton k\u00e1pus Gossypium herbaceum, 7978 under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea, and 65 under brown hemp amb\u00e1di Hibiscus\ncannabinus. Miscellaneous crops occupied 4276 acres or 173 per cent of which 742 were under chillies *mirchi* Capsicum frutescens, 973 under sugarcane *vs* Saccharum officinarum, 418 under tobacco *tamb\u00e1kh\u00fa* Nicotiana tabacum, 40 under hemp *g\u00e1nja* Cannabis sativa, and the remaining 2103 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 110,046 people 102,512 or 93\u00b715 per cent were Hindus, 7456 or 6\u00b777 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 67 Christians, and 11 P\u00e1rs\u00eds.

It is bounded on the north by Karjat in Ahmadnagar, on the east by the Sina and beyond the Sina by the Niz\u00e1m's territory, on the south by M\u00e1dha, and on the west by the Bhima and beyond the Bhima by Ind\u00e1pur in Poona. It has an area of 766 square miles, a population in 1881 of 61,548 or eighty to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a311,483 (Rs. 1,14,830).\n\nOf the 766 square miles 721 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 101 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 382,134 acres or 85\u00b757 per cent of arable land, 32,425 acres or 7\u00b726 per cent of unarable land, 105 acres or 0\u00b702 per cent of grass, 3046 acres or 0\u00b769 per cent of forests, and 28,867 acres or 6\u00b746 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 382,134 acres of arable land 23,118 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nKarm\u00e1la, about thirty-eight miles long from north to south and twenty-eight broad from east to west, lies between the Bhima in the\nwest and the Sina in the east. The water-shed divides the subdivision into two parts and runs north-west from Kem in the south to a little west of Karm\u00e1la in the north. The country is a succession of rises and valleys, with a good deal of high lying table-land, which in some places is strewn with stones and boulders, but generally is level and has good though somewhat shallow soil. Except the V\u00e1ghoba and Bodki hills near Kem and the dividing ridge forming the water-shed, the sub-division is flat, though towards the north and north-west the ground is rough and broken and crossed by many large streams. Except near the low-lying villages and valleys trees are rare and not so large as in the more favoured climate of B\u00e1rsi.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate is dry, being somewhat similar to though less favourable than that of M\u00e1dha. In the north-east the rainfall is slightly heavier than in the south about Tembhurni; but the seasons are most uncertain, a really good one, as a rule, not occurring oftener than once in three or four years. In a really good season the harvest is unusually abundant. At Karm\u00e1la in the north-east, during the ten years ending 1882, the rainfall varied from thirty-four inches in 1882 to six inches in 1876 and averaged twenty-four inches.\n\nWater.\n\nOwing to short and uncertain rainfall water is scanty. The two chief rivers are the Bhima and the Sina. The Bhima, separating Karm\u00e1la from Ind\u00e1pur in the west, winds north to south for about seventy miles, and the Sina, separating Karm\u00e1la from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory in the east, runs north to south for about thirty miles. Land is mostly watered from wells, and sometimes by throwing temporary dams across streams. Except in a few villages where it is enough for the growth of wheat and onions and is available till the middle or end of February, the water-supply of these dams does not last beyond the end of December or the beginning of January. In Karm\u00e1la town drinking water is supplied from springs in wells lying about three quarters of a mile south of the town.\n\nSoil.\n\nAbout one-half of the soil is black and one-quarter each red and gravelly or barad. Except along stream banks and in the Sina valley the black soil, as a rule, is somewhat shallow. It is often somewhat stiff and clayey and requires an abundant rainfall to ensure a full crop. In a favourable season the yield is equal or even superior to the best black soils; but in ordinary years the soil yields but an indifferent crop, and in unfavourable seasons scarcely returns the seed. Besides this, a small quantity of alluvial land is found chiefly along the banks of the Bhima. The leading crops are jv\u00e1ri, b\u00e1jri, safflower, and a small quantity of wheat, cotton, and gram.\n\nStock.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 129 riding and 1630 load carts, 620 eight-bullock and 1582 ten-bullock ploughs, 28,855 bullocks and 14,849 cows, 2230 he-buffaloes and 4571 she-buffaloes, 1754 horses, 71,384 sheep and goats, and 742 asses.\n\nHoldings.\n\nIn 1882-83 including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 5537 with an average area of about forty-eight acres. Of the\nwhole number 171 were holdings of not more than five acres, 240 were of six to ten acres, 890 of eleven to twenty acres, 2595 of twenty-one to fifty acres, 1125 of fifty-one to 100 acres, 436 of 101 to 200 acres, sixty-one of 201 to 300 acres, thirteen of 301 to 400 acres, and six of above 400 acres. The occupants who have holdings of over 100 acres are Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, Gujars, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Dhangars. As a rule the Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, and Gujars sublet their holdings.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 229,048 acres the whole area held for tillage, 31,442 acres or 13\u00b772 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 197,606 acres, 790 were twice cropped.

It is bounded on the north by Karm\u00e1l\u00e1, on the east by the Sina and beyond the Sina by the Niz\u00e1m's territory and part of Shol\u00e1pur, on the south by Shol\u00e1pur and Pandharpur, and on the west by Pandharpur. It has an area of 619 square miles, a population in 1881 of 67,961 or 109 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a38455 (Rs. 84,550).\n\nOf the 619 square miles 613 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, twenty-two square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 347,325 acres or 90\u00b797 per cent of arable land, 11,866 acres or 3\u00b710 per cent of unarable land, 2303 acres or 0\u00b760 per cent of forests, and 20,343 acres or 5\u00b733 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 347,326 acres of arable land 16,746 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nM\u00e1dha is irregular in shape, with a greatest length of about forty miles from north-east to south-west and a breadth varying from twenty-five to thirty miles in the north to eighteen or twenty in the south. It is a bare waving plain; the tops of all the higher parts, though often covered with yellow stunted spear grass, are bare of trees and have a barren soil. As in the east, except in five villages the Sina forms its eastern boundary, and towards the west the subdivision does not stretch far enough to include any of the plain of the Bhima, most of the sub-division consists of comparatively high lying land. About four miles north of M\u00e1dha the m\u00e1la or high land of Chinchgaon lies between the villages of Chinchgaon Tadval and Vadshinga. The M\u00e1dha villages are generally one to four miles distant on streams or river banks. Most of the villages are walled, but of many the wall is broken.\n\nThe climate is dry and hot winds prevail in March April and May. At M\u00e1dha in the north-east of the sub-division, during the ten years ending 1882 the rainfall varied from thirty-two inches in 1882 to eight inches in 1876 and averaged twenty-five inches.\n\nThe water-shed crosses the sub-division in the direction of its greatest length from north-west to south-east, and its streams flow eastward into the Sina and southward into the Bhima, which at no point is many miles from the south-western boundary. Owing to the low elevation at which they rise and the short distance they have to flow, none of the streams are good sized; and except the Bhend none run all through the year. The Bhend which rises near Kem in the Karm\u00e1l\u00e1 sub-division, falls into the Sina a little\nnorth of the village of Undergaon. Of the three chief rivers the Bhima runs in the west for about six miles, the Sina in the east for about thirty miles, and the Bhog\u00e1vati in the east for about three miles. Besides by the Ashti lake, about fifteen miles south-west of M\u00e1dha, land is chiefly watered from wells and to a less extent from streams and rivers. During the hot season most of the streams dry.\n\nAlong the banks of the Sina the soil is rich, a good black of great depth; in the high land the soil is shallow black and poor red or gravelly, nearly in equal parts.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 190 riding and 1579 load carts, 477 eight-bullock and 1727 ten-bullock ploughs, 25,807 bullocks and 12,974 cows, 2827 he-buffaloes and 5205 she-buffaloes, 1188 horses, 57,272 sheep and goats, and 425 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 6159 with an average area of about forty-six acres. Of the whole number 312 were holdings of not more than five acres, 335 were of six to ten acres, 1017 of eleven to twenty acres, 2723 of twenty-one to fifty acres, 1247 of fifty-one to 100 acres; 435 of 101 to 200 acres; sixty-six of 201 to 300 acres; seventeen of 301 to 400 acres; and seven of above 400 acres. The occupants who have holdings of over 100 acres are Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Dh\u00e1ngars. As a rule the Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, and Gujars sublet their holdings.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 251,602 acres the whole area held for tillage, 47,929 acres or 19\u00b704 per cent were fallow or under grass.

The chief rivers are the Nira and Bhima and their small feeders. The Nira runs west to east for about thirty\nmiles on the northern border and falls into the Bhima in the extreme north-east of the sub-division. The Bhima runs north to south for about twenty miles on the eastern border. The small feeders of the Bhima and Nira mostly run dry during the hot season.

For a winding length of about twenty miles the Bhima separates Pandharpur from M\u00e1lisiras in the west, and for about forty miles it winds north-west to south-east through the centre of the sub-division. During the rains the water overflows its banks which are earthy and steep. The M\u00e1n runs west to east in the south and falls into the Bhima near Sarkoli about ten miles south-east of Pandharpur. The town of Pandharpur is supplied with drinking water from a pond made in 1874 about a mile south-west of the town. Land is chiefly watered from wells.\nAlong the river and stream banks the soil is mostly deep black, and to the east of the Bhima it is specially fine.

It is bounded on the north by M\u00e1lsiras and Pandharpur; on the east by Pandharpur, Mangalvedha of the Patvardhan state, and the Jath state; on the south by the Jath and Patvardhan states; and on the west by Kh\u00e1n\u00e1p\u00far in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and \u00c1tp\u00e1di of the Pant Pratinidhi. It has an area of 649 square miles, a population in 1881 of 62,849 or ninety-seven to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a315,814 (Rs. 1,58,140).\n\nArea.\n\nOf the 649 square miles 599 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 90 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 342,099 acres or 90-18 per cent of arable land, 23,651 acres or 6-24 per cent of unarable land, 3740 acres or 0-98 per cent of forests, and 9866 acres or 2-60 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 342,099 acres of arable land 36,595 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nAspect.\n\nS\u00e1ngola is a level open plain with a few treeless hillocks fringing its southern border. It is mostly bare of trees. The villages are small, three or four miles apart. More than half the villages lie on stream banks and except S\u00e1ngola and N\u00e1zre almost all are open. The village site is generally bare.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate is hot. At S\u00e1ngola in the centre of the sub-division, during the ten years ending 1882 the rainfall varied from thirty-four inches in 1877 to six inches in 1876 and averaged twenty-two inches.\n\nWater.\n\nThe chief river is the M\u00e1n with its feeders the Belvan, Kurda, Songanga, and V\u00e1nkdi. It drains the sub-division west to northeast for about thirty-five miles. During the rains the streams are all full, but in the hot season most of them run dry. In S\u00e1ngola land is little watered.\n\nSoil.\n\nMost of the soil is stony and barren, and much of it is fit only for grazing.\n\nStock.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included twenty-three riding and 1099 load carts, 786 two-bullock and 3053 four-bullock.\nploughs, 22,269 bullocks and 12,181 cows, 2649 he-buffaloes and 4113 she-buffaloes, 1403 horses, 91,711 sheep and goats, and 457 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 5259 with an average area of about 54 acres.

The occupants who have holdings of over 100 acres are Br\u00e1hmaas, local V\u00e1nis, Gujars, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Dhangars. As a rule the Br\u00e1hmans, local V\u00e1nis, and Gujars sublet their holdings.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 283,695 acres the whole area held for tillage 67,801 acres or 23\u00b789 per cent were fallow or under grass.

It is bounded on the north by the Nizam's territory, on the south by the Bhima and the Akalkot state, on the east by the Akalkot state, and on the west by the Pandharpur and Madha sub-divisions. It has an area of 847 square miles, a population in 1881 of 149,539 or 176 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a319,764 (Rs.1,97,640). Of its 115 villages eleven lie detached in the Nizam's territory.\n\nArea.\n\nOf the 847 square miles 543 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, nine square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 491,065 acres or 91\u00b756 per cent of arable land, 27,153 acres or 5\u00b706 per cent of unarable land, 2968 acres or 0\u00b755 per cent of grass, 3205 acres or 0\u00b760 per cent of forests, and 11,953 acres or 2\u00b723 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 491,065 acres of arable land 57,762 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nAspect.\n\nSholapur is waving and bare of trees, rising in places in small hillocks showing bare rock. On the whole it is less rugged and stony than Mohol on the north-west. The southern part between the Bhima and the Sina is flatter and richer and has groves of trees and gardens. The land between the streams slowly rises to the water-shed. Except in the south and east which have two or three groups of small villages close together, the villages are large and far apart. Almost all are on river or stream banks. The village sites are bare. Formerly the villages were walled, but the walls have fallen and in many cases disappeared.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate is dry. The cold season is clear and bracing and better than that in other parts of the Deccan, and the hot season hotter with much hot dry wind. The rainfall is scanty. The southwest monsoon reaches Sholapur only in fitful gusts and is never to be trusted; the sub-division owes most of its rainfall to the northeast monsoon. At Sholapur in the centre, during the eighteen years ending 1870, the fall varied from 35\u00b778 inches in 1869 to 13\u00b765 inches in 1855 and averaged 26\u00b763 inches, and during the ten years ending 1882 it varied from sixty-six inches in 1878 to eleven inches in 1876 and averaged thirty-one inches. During the cold season the temperature is lower, and during the hot and rainy seasons higher than at most Bombay stations.\n\nWater.\n\nThe two chief rivers are the Bhima and the Sina. The Bhima forms the southern boundary of the sub-division for about thirty-five\nmiles, and the Sina runs south through the sub-division for about forty miles. The rivers run throughout the year, though during the hot season the stream is narrow. Land is little watered by these rivers. Besides from the Ekruk lake the better garden lands are watered from wells. The city of Sholapur is supplied with drinking water from the Ekruk lake, about three miles north of the city.\n\nThe soil is various and irregular. In the dips is much fine alluvial soil. North of the Sina in the east about ten per cent of the soil is black, fifty red or t\u0101mbad, and forty gravelly or barad. The black soil, being about one-tenth of the whole, is found only in small patches and of no great depth, resting on a sandy loam and under it pebbly limestone as in Gujar\u0101t. Especially near Sholapur, B\u0101la, Degaon, and the south-east of Ahirv\u0101di the black soil is very rich, yielding all the richer products. Towards the banks of the Sina and between the Sina and Bhima in the west the black soil is more plentiful and much is deep and excellent. The chief products are all the rabi or late grains, oil-seeds, and pulses, but bajri is not much grown.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 181 riding and 1258 load carts, 1398 two-bullock and 3239 four-bullock ploughs, 34,791 bullocks and 17,419 cows, 6833 he-buffaloes and 3779 she-buffaloes, 1545 horses, 55,543 sheep and goats, and 804 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 9533 with an average area of about fifty-four acres. Of the whole number 374 were holdings of not more than five acres, 631 were of six to ten acres, 1708 of eleven to twenty acres, 4060 of twenty-one to fifty acres; 1908 of fifty-one to 100 acres; 666 of 101 to 200 acres; 128 of 201 to 300 acres; thirty-seven of 301 to 400 acres; and twenty-one of above 400 acres. The occupants who have holdings of over 100 acres are Br\u0101hmans, local V\u0101nis, Gujars, Mar\u0101thas, and Dhangars. As a rule the Br\u0101hmans, local V\u0101nis, and Gujars sublet their holdings.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 382,466 acres the whole area held for tillage, 46,284 acres or 12\u00b710 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 336,182 acres 7532 were twice cropped. Of the 343,714 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 272,200 acres or 79\u00b719 per cent, of which 234,263 were under Indian millet javari Sorghum vulgare, 23,399 under spiked millet bajri Pennicillaria spicata, 7307 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 6049 under rice bh\u0101t Oryza sativa, 132 under maize makka Zea mays, 242 under r\u0101la or k\u0101ng Panicum italicum, 82 under s\u0101va and vari Panicum miliaceum, 100 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 626 under other grains of which details are not given.

The town was formerly very flourishing with a large trade in cotton which has now almost disappeared. About \u00a38500 (Rs. 85,000) worth of goods still change hands in the year. The town has a post office and a ruined fort. The weekly market is held on Monday. In 1689 Aurangzeb (1658-1707), driven north from his camp at Bij\u00e1pur by an outbreak of the plague, came to Akluj where the epidemic subsided.\u00b2 After his arrival at Akluj plundering parties of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were frequently near and detachments were sent to Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s territories. One of these under Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n was sent to Kolhapur. Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n succeeded in capturing Sambh\u00e1ji and twenty-six others at Sangameshvar in Ratn\u00e1giri and marched with the prisoners to the Moghal camp. When the news of Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s capture reached Aurangzeb\u2019s camp at Akluj there were great rejoicings. During the four or five days when Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n was known to be coming with the prisoners, all classes were so overjoyed that they could not sleep and went out four miles to meet the prisoners and give expression to their joy. In every town or village on or near the road, wherever the news reached, there was great delight; and wherever the prisoners passed the doors and roofs were full of men and women who looked on rejoicing.\u00b3 In 1792 Captain Moor, the author of the Hindu Pantheon, described it as Akhloos a large respectable town with a well supplied market and with a fort and several handsome buildings and wells.\u2074 In 1803 on his march from Seringapatam to Poona to reinstate B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, General Wellesley halted at Akluj from the 13th to the 15th of April.\u2075\n\nAshta, fifteen miles south-west of M\u00e1l\u015bha, with in 1881 a population of 2495, is interesting as the scene of the battle of the 20th of February 1818 between General Smith and B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Peshwa\u2019s troops in which the Peshwa was defeated and his general Gokhale killed. The battle was entirely a cavalry action, Gokhale having eight to ten thousand horse and General Smith two regiments of cavalry, a squadron of the 22nd Dragoons, 1200 auxiliary horse, and 2500 infantry. The enemy lost about 200 killed including Gokhale, while\n\n\u00b9 Except the articles on Pandharpur and Shol\u00e1pur this chapter is prepared from materials contributed by Mr. C. E. G. Crawford, C.

Twelve elephants fifty-seven camels and many palanquins fell into the hands of the British. The battle had the important result of freeing the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chief from B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s power and of ending the enterprise of the Peshwa\u2019s horse.\u00b9 Ashta has a large lake which, when full, has an area of about four square miles and a capacity of 1,499,470,085 cubic feet of water. The lake has been formed by throwing across the Ashta stream, a feeder of the Bhima, an earthen dam 12,709 feet long with a greatest height of 57'75 feet. Two canals are led from the dam, a left bank canal 11\u00bd miles long, discharging thirty cubic feet a second and commanding 12,258 arable acres, and a right bank canal ten miles long, discharging ten cubic feet a second and commanding 5624 arable acres. The plans of the work were prepared in 1869 and the lake finished on the 31st of July 1881 at a cost of \u00a333,499 (Rs. 3,34,990). Part of the work was done as famine relief till November 1877, the greatest number of famine labourers employed on any one day being 19,949.\u00b2\n\nB\u00e1rsi, north latitude 18\u00b0 13' and east longitude 75\u00b0 44', forty miles north-west of Shol\u00e1pur, is a municipal town the head-quarters of the B\u00e1rsi sub-division, with in 1881 a population of 16,126. Besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices B\u00e1rsi has a municipality, a dispensary, a sub-judge\u2019s court, four schools and a library, and a station at B\u00e1rsi Road about twenty-two miles to the south-west. At the beginning of the present century B\u00e1rsi had a population of about 3000 which increased to 11,798 in 1866, and 18,560 in 1872, but in 1881 had fallen to 16,126.\u00b3 The 1872 census showed a population of 18,560 of whom 17,357 were Hindus 1175 Musalm\u00e1ns and twenty-eight Christians. The 1881 census showed 14,387 Hindus, 1682 Musalm\u00e1ns, forty-six Christians, and eleven P\u00e1rsis. The municipality which was established in 1865 had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a34149 (Rs. 41,490) and an expenditure of \u00a32744 (Rs. 27,440). The income was chiefly derived from octroi which yielded \u00a33912 (Rs. 39,120) and the expenditure was chiefly incurred in works of conservancy and in roads. For the water-supply of the town the municipality has built a storage reservoir close to the town at a cost of \u00a32825 (Rs. 28,250). It is designed to contain nineteen millions of cubic feet and has a drainage area of 1\u00bd square miles and a surface area of sixty-five acres. The dispensary was established in 1866. In 1883 it treated forty-six in-patients and 13,698 out-patients at a cost of \u00a3202 (Rs. 2020). Of the four government schools one is anglo-vernacular, two vernacular for boys, and the fourth vernacular for girls. The railway returns for 1883 show at B\u00e1rsi Road 121,426 passengers and 71,522 tons of goods.\n\nTrade,\n\nB\u00e1rsi is a noted mart of transit trade and owes its importance to its position, not far from the railway, in a most fertile country on the\n\n\u00b9 Details are given above pp. 294-295. \u00b2 Details are given above pp. 223-225.\n\u00b3 The details are, 11,798 in 1866-67, 15,313 in 1867-68, 16,559 in 1868-69, 14,685 in 1869-70, 15,759 in 1870-71, 18,560 in 1871-72, 15,731 in 1872-73, 16,323 in 1873-74, 15,245 in 1874-75, 15,254 in 1875-76, 15,506 in 1876-77, 15,042 in 1877-78, 14,673 in 1878-79, 15,140 in 1879-80, and 16,126 in the census of February 1881.\nBritish-Niz\u00e1m frontier. Its chief importance lies in its export trade with which it is fed by the Niz\u00e1m's villages from thirty and in the case of cotton from as far as 150 miles off. The chief articles of export are, in order of importance, cotton, linseed, oil, food-grains, groundnuts, gingelly and other oil seeds, sugar and raw sugar, grocery and spices, dye-roots, clarified butter, and hides and horns. Except a little cotton and oil-seed and nearly all of the sugar and raw sugar which come from the surrounding narrow slip of British territory, all articles of export come from the Niz\u00e1m's country whose boundary line lies at a varying distance of five to twenty miles from B\u00e1rsi. The whole of the goods are brought in carts and on pack bullocks. Carts are yearly increasing and would have almost entirely displaced pack bullocks but for the want of roads in many of the Niz\u00e1m's districts.\n\nCotton is the chief export, worth about \u00a3360,000 (Rs. 36,00,000) or three-fourths of the entire export trade. Linseed comes next with a yearly value of \u00a360,000 (Rs. 6,00,000). Before the American civil war (1862-1865) the yearly export of cotton varied from 5000 to 10,000 bales, and between 1860 and 1865 the exports varied from 80,000 to 90,000 bales. In 1868-69 cotton exports fell to 60,000 bales, and since then they have varied from 38,510 bales in 1873 to 87,700 bales in 1878. Almost the whole export trade is in the hands of the agencies of two Bombay European firms Messrs. Ralli Brothers and Messrs. Gaddum Bythell & Company and ten or twelve agents of Bombay native merchants. Before 1860 the trade in the interior was entirely in the hands of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and local moneylenders who farmed the Niz\u00e1m's revenues or were otherwise connected with that government. By degrees and after much opposition wealthy native cotton merchants of Bombay ousted the local capitalists and established agencies in one district after another, chiefly Kandh\u00e1r, Kirkli, Latur, M\u00e1lkhed, and N\u00e1nder in the Niz\u00e1m's territory. Purchases in these distant places are made chiefly during the southwest rains (June-October) when, according to crop prospects, advances are made to the landholders and the produce is bought at low rates. The buyers get delivery of the produce in January or February and send it to B\u00e1rsi for sale.\n\nIn 1870 the extension of the north-east branch of the Peninsula railway to Kh\u00e1mgaon in Ber\u00e1r drew from B\u00e1rsi part of the cotton produce of the Hingoli and B\u00e1sim districts. In 1878 the opening of the Dhond-Manm\u00e1d railway drew to its stations the cotton of Bh\u00edr and other Niz\u00e1m's districts to the north-west of Ahmadnagar. The heavy export duties, especially on cotton, food-grains, and clarified butter, which are levied by the Niz\u00e1m's government on all produce coming to B\u00e1rsi hamper trade and prevent the spread of tillage.\n\nThe chief articles of import are, in order of importance, salt, food-grains, hardware, dried fruits, piece-goods, cocoanuts, twist, sacking, and refined sugar. The import trade is in the hands of local dealers, Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, Br\u00e1hmans, Komtis, and Rajputs. They import these articles from Bombay from native dealers and sell\n\n---\n\n1 A cotton bale weighs 3\u00bd cwt.\nthem to landholders and dealers from the interior, who, as soon as they have disposed of and received the value of their produce, buy imported articles for home use or to re-sell in the Niz\u0101m's territories. A small part of the piece-goods and twist come from the Shol\u00e1pur Mill and some copper and brass vessels are brought from Poona. The average yearly import of salt averages 7500 tons. Almost the whole of this amount goes to the Niz\u0101m's territory. Before the opening of the Peninsula railway (1859-1860) all the salt was brought from Panvel by cotton pack-bullocks on their return journey. Of piece-goods and twist about two-thirds are English produce and one-third are made in Bombay and Shol\u00e1pur. Till about 1860 areca nuts were largely imported from Sirsi in North K\u00e1nara on pack-bullocks. Since then the coasting steamers have drawn the areca trade mostly to Bombay, though a considerable quantity of areca nuts still comes in carts from Sirsi. On all goods crossing the frontier the Niz\u0101m's government levies import duties, especially on salt and iron. The chief industry of B\u00e1rsi is cart-making especially in the fair season. Till 1860 about 200 hand-looms were at work. The weavers have now taken to other occupations. In 1840 Sir George Wingate described B\u00e1rsi as a flourishing town for the Deccan, though eclipsed by the more prosperous mart of Shol\u00e1pur. The town contained 9732 people living in 1787 houses. Up to the British conquest in 1818 B\u00e1rsi carried on a large trade in grain and other articles of raw produce; but they fell off in demand with the overthrow of the Peshwa and the dispersion of his Mar\u00e1tha retainers. This loss of custom would have materially reduced B\u00e1rsi but for the sudden change about 1830 in the export of cotton from Bombay instead of from the Bay of Bengal. As B\u00e1rsi lay on the direct route from some of the Niz\u0101m's cotton districts it became a convenient centre for the trade. At first almost the whole of the cotton brought to B\u00e1rsi was bought on arrival for the Bombay market. Shortly before Captain Wingate wrote (1840) the practice had begun of Bombay houses sending agents to the interior to buy on the spot. In 1840 the cotton yearly brought to B\u00e1rsi was estimated at 5000 bullock-loads worth about \u00a312,500 (Rs. 1,25,000). Another article of trade was turmeric of which about 2000 bullock-loads were brought worth about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). The turmeric came from the Niz\u0101m's districts and was sent to Poona, Junnar, Ahmadnagar, and R\u00e1j\u00e1pur in Ratn\u00e1giri. There was also a large trade in oil, clarified butter, and raw sugar. The grain trade was reviving and wheat and pulse were being largely exported to Poona and other markets. In 1872 B\u00e1rsi was described as a well built town with broad and well kept streets. It had a population of 15,759 lodged in 4314 houses. About 250 carts passed daily through the town and goods amounting to \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) changed hands every week.\n\nBavi, a small village about ten miles south-west of M\u00e1dha has old half-buried temples said to be Hem\u00e1dpanti. The temples are not used.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Government Selections CL.

The place takes its name from one of Aurangzeb's daughters who died while her father was encamped at Brahmapuri on the opposite bank of the river. She was buried at this place and her tomb is a plain solid structure in a courtyard 180 feet square. It overhangs the Bhima from which it is guarded by a strong masonry wall now much out of repair. Round the tomb a market slowly sprang up with the result that the suburb of Begampur outgrew the original village of Ghadeshvar from which it is separated by a water-course. About \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000) worth of thread, cloth, and grain change hands every year at the weekly market on Thursday. The village has a little manufacture of coarse cloth or khadi.\n\nBrahmapuri on the Bhima, about sixteen miles south-east of Pandharpur, has an old temple of Siddheshvar enclosed in a paved court. In 1695 Aurangzeb, annoyed at the continued Maratha raids in the North Deccan, encamped with his large army at Brahmapuri where he established his chief store and built a cantonment where he held a court. From Brahmapuri the operations of his armies and the affairs of his empire were directed for five years. In 1700 the Brahmapuri cantonment was vacated much to the regret of the idle Moghal officers many of whom had built excellent houses in the cantonment. A store was formed under a fort built at the neighbouring village of Machnur which was within the line of the cantonment. Leaving a strong guard for the protection of the store and fort, Aurangzeb marched to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra which surrendered in June 1700.\n\nEkruk, about five miles north-east of Sholapur, has the largest artificial lake in the Bombay Presidency. It comprises a reservoir formed by an earthen dam 7200 feet long and seventy-two feet high and three canals. The lake, when full, is sixty feet deep and holds 3350 millions of cubic feet. The area of water surface is 4640 acres or 7\u00bd square miles. Two waste weirs, together 750 feet long, are provided for the escape of flood water after the lake is full. Of the canals one on each bank is at a high level, designed for four months' watering and the third on the left bank is at a low level designed for a twelve months' discharge. Of the two high level canals the right bank canal is eighteen miles long, discharges sixty cubic feet a second and commands 565 arable acres, and the left bank canal is four miles long, discharges twenty-five cubic feet a second, and commands 856 arable acres. The low level left bank canal is twenty-six miles long, discharges seventy cubic feet a second, and commands about 10,601 arable acres. The plans of the lake were prepared in 1863, sanctioned in 1866, and the whole finished by the end of 1881-82 at a cost of about \u00a3121,262 (Rs. 12,12,620).\n\nHotgi nine miles south-east of Sholapur, with in 1881 a population of 1614, is the junction of the Peninsula and the East Deccan or Hotgi-Gadag railways.

The porch has three pillars on each side and the hall or mandap has five on each side in continuation of the porch pillars. The temple has side shrines of Mah\u00e1dev and Mallik\u00e1rjun.\n\nKARKAMB.\n\nKarkamb, about fourteen miles north of Pandharpur, is a large town, with in 1872 a population of 7671 and in 1881 of 6421. The 1872 census showed 7196 Hindus and 475 Musalm\u00e1ns, and the 1881 census showed 5957 Hindus and 464 Musalm\u00e1ns. The town has a large weaving and thread dyeing industry with about 800 looms chiefly producing cheap cloth for women\u2019s robes. The betel vine is also largely grown. A weekly market is held on Monday when cattle grain and cloth are sold. The town has a post office and a school.\n\nKARM\u00c1LA.\n\nKarm\u00e1la, about twelve miles north of the Jeur station on the Peninsula railway, is a municipal town, the head-quarters of the Karm\u00e1la sub-division, with in 1881 a population of 5071, of whom 4391 were Hindus, 677 Musalm\u00e1ns, and three Others. The 1872 census showed 6101 Hindus 648 Musalm\u00e1ns and ten Christians or a total population of 6759, the fall of 1688 in 1881 being probably due to the famine. The town is connected with Jeur station by a first class local fund road. It was originally the seat of a branch of the Nimb\u00e1lkar family who held the neighbouring country as j\u00e1gir. Its founder Rambl\u00e1j\u00ed B\u00e1v\u00e1ji began and his son J\u00e1nojir\u00e1v finished a fort which still exists and is used for the sub-divisional offices. The fort, one of the largest in the Deccan, extends over a quarter of a square mile and contains about a hundred houses. Under the protection of the fort Karm\u00e1la grew and became a large trade centre, being a crossing station for the traffic lines from the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t through B\u00e1rsi to Poona and between Ahmadnagar and Shol\u00e1pur. Most of this traffic has now passed to the railway, but Karm\u00e1la is still a large mart for cattle, grain, oil, and piece-goods. A weekly market is held on Friday and the town has a small weaving industry with sixty looms. Besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices Karm\u00e1la has a municipality, dispensary, post office, school, reading-room, and a temple of Bhav\u00e1ni. The municipality was established in 1867 and in 1882-83 had an income of \u00a3483 (Rs. 4830) and an expenditure of \u00a3463 (Rs. 4630). The water-supply of the town is from springs in wells lying about three quarters of a mile to the south. The water is carried through an earthenware conduit to dipping wells at proper sites in the town. The works were finished in 1877 at a cost to the municipality of \u00a3235 (Rs. 2350). The dispensary, established in 1872 treated in 1883 forty-two inpatients and 7860 outpatients at a cost of \u00a3136 (Rs. 1360). The temple of Bhav\u00e1ni on a hill to the south-east was built by the Nimb\u00e1lkars at a cost, it is said, of about \u00a3175,000 (Rs. 17,50,000). The temple enjoys a yearly Government allowance of \u00a3170 (Rs. 1700) and a yearly fair lasting four days from the full-moon of K\u00e1rtik or October-November is held in honour of the goddess.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Mr. A.

In 1727 Rambh\u00e1ji Nimb\u00e1lkar, who was in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s service, received Karm\u00e1la in exchange for his estate in Poona.\n\nKa\u2019segaon, eight miles north-east of Shol\u00e1pur, has a Hem\u00e1dpanti temple of K\u00e1seeshvar approached by a flight of steps from the courtyard. To the left of the entrance is some figure-carving. The hall or mandap has eight pillars.\n\nKoregaon village, thirteen miles north-east of B\u00e1rsi, has an old irrigation lake. The lake is formed by two earthen dams across two separate valleys. The larger dam on the west is 995 feet long and seventy-one feet high in the centre and the smaller dam on the south-east is 300 feet long with a greatest height of twelve feet. The drainage area is 4\u00b74 square miles. The lake, which is not in good repair, watered in 1882-83 eighty-four acres. It is proposed to restore the lake at a cost of about \u00a31200 (Rs.12,000) when it will have a depth of fourteen feet from outlet to full supply, an available capacity of 81,298,114 cubic feet, and a full supply area of 8,793,017 square feet or 202 acres.\n\nMachnur, on the Bhima about fifteen miles south-east of Pandharpur has a fort built by Aurangzeb (1658-1707). See above Brahmapuri.\n\nM\u00e1dha, on the Peninsula railway about forty miles north-west of Shol\u00e1pur is a municipal town, the head-quarters of the M\u00e1dha sub-division, with in 1872 a population of 5254 and in 1881 of 4078. The place owes its growth from a small village to Rambh\u00e1ji Nimb\u00e1lkar who lived here and built a fort. Since the building of the fort M\u00e1dha has always been a place of trade especially while the railway was making and during the American war. Besides the revenue and police offices of the M\u00e1dha sub-division, the town has a sub-judge\u2019s court, railway station, post office, fort, temple, and a weekly market on Tuesday. The railway returns show at M\u00e1dha station an increase in passengers from 16,832 in 1880 to 24,391 in 1883 and in goods from 4084 to 10,078 tons. The fort is now used for accommodating the sub-divisional offices. The temple of Devi is a handsome building raised by the Nimb\u00e1lkars on the site of an old shrine. A small yearly fair is held at the temple on the full-moon of Ashvin or September-October.\n\nM\u00e1liras, on the Poona-Shol\u00e1pur road, about twenty-five miles north-west of Pandharpur and about seventy miles north-west of Shol\u00e1pur, is the head-quarters of the M\u00e1liras sub-division, with in 1872 a population of 2802 and in 1881 of 3087. Besides the revenue and police offices of the sub-division M\u00e1liras has a post office a Tuesday weekly market and temples of Someshvar and M\u00e1ruti.

The population is chiefly agricultural with some weavers and dyers speaking mixed Mar\u00e1thi and K\u00e1narese. Mandrup was the head-quarters of a sub-division under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and, till when it merged into the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division, it was the head-quarters of a petty division or mahal. A weekly market is held on Friday.\n\n**Marde**, eight miles south of Shol\u00e1pur, with in 1881 a population of 1556, has a mosque built out of a destroyed Hem\u00e1dpanti temple. Near the mosque are the remains of a Hem\u00e1dpanti well with much good sculpture.\n\n**Mohol**, about twenty miles south-east of M\u00e1dha, is a market town on the Poona-Shol\u00e1pur road with a station on the Peninsula railway and a population in 1872 of 4364 and in 1881 of 2961. The railway returns show an increase in passengers from 30,310 in 1880 to 47,900 in 1883 and in goods from 1305 to 4952 tons. A weekly market is held on Sunday. The town has two temples, a post office, an old fort used under Mar\u00e1tha rule for the offices of the old Mohol sub-division, and two ruined forts outside the town built about 200 years ago by the local deshmukhs. The two temples of Bhaneshvar and Nilkantheshvar or Chandramauli are both said to have been built by Hem\u00e1dpant. A yearly fair is held at the Nilkantheshvar temple for three days beginning with the fourth of the bright half of Vaish\u00e1kh or April-May. According to the local story Mohol is a very old town. It is supposed to have suffered severely in the war between Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns at the close of the thirteenth century and the present deshmukh and deshp\u00e1nde families of the M\u00e1dha sub-division claim descent from officers appointed by the victorious Musalm\u00e1ns. During the great Durga Devi famine (1396-1408) the town is said to have been abandoned and to have taken twenty-five years to recover from the famine. Another local story says that Mohol was the residence of the god N\u00e1gn\u00e1th who afterwards proceeded to Vadval five miles to the south-east. N\u00e1gn\u00e1th\u2019s temples at Mohol and Vadval were built about 1730 by Ghongre a rich merchant of Vair\u00e1g.\n\n**Na\u2019tepute**, on the Poona-Shol\u00e1pur road about five miles west of M\u00e1lsiras, is a market town with in 1872 a population of 2376 and in 1881 of 2261. The town is said to have been founded or raised from a small village to a market place by Malik Sundar a Bahmani (1342-1490) minister. The weekly market is held on Wednesday at which during the year about \u00a319,500 (Rs. 1,95,000) worth of goods are estimated to change hands. About 100 looms prepare blankets valued at \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) a year. The town has a post office two temples and two ponds. The temples of Girj\u00e1shankar or\n\n---\n\n1 Local tradition derives the name Mohol from mauli the latter part of this name.\n2 Dr. Burgess (Lists, 71) notices a temple of Hanum\u00e1n in Mohol with a four-headed image of the monkey god and an deciphered inscription.\nGaurishankar and P\u00e1rvateshvar are both old, and a fair largely attended by pilgrims on their way to the Shambhuling festival at Shingnapur in M\u00e1n in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is held at the Gaurishankar temple on the eighth of the bright half of Chaitra or March-April. Of two built ponds on the east and west of the town, the west called the K\u00e1sam pond is very large and is used to supply the town with water by a channel which is now out of repair.\n\nPandharpur\\(^1\\), or the city of Pandhari Vithoba, \\(17^\\circ 40'\\) north latitude and \\(75^\\circ 23'\\) east longitude, forty miles west of Shol\u00e1pur, with in 1881 a population of 16,910, is one of the most frequented places of pilgrimage in the Bombay Presidency with an average yearly attendance of about 170,000 pilgrims. Besides the revenue and police offices of the Pandharpur sub-division, the town has a municipality, dispensary, subordinate judge\u2019s court, temples, schools, rest-houses, and an orphanage. The town, which is about a mile long by hardly half a mile broad, lies along the right bank of the Bhima on trap overlaid with poor black soil. The level of the town varies, the temple of Vithoba and its surroundings being higher than the south end of the town. Pandharpur is about twenty miles southwest of Mohol station and thirty-one miles south of B\u00e1rsi road station. The twenty miles of road from Mohol is not in good order and is used only during the fair weather. The thirty-one miles of road from B\u00e1rsi Road station which was built from local funds is mostly used by pilgrims from Kh\u00e1ndesh, Ber\u00e1r, and the north. A mail pony cart plies daily along this road and other pony carts and hundreds of bullock carts are on hire at the station. The best view of Pandharpur is from the left bank of the Bhima. When the river is full the broad winding Bhima gay with boats with bright lion horse and unicorn figure heads; the islet temples of Vishnupad and N\u00e1rad; and on the further bank the rows of domed and spired tombs; the crowded cloth-brightened flights of steps leading from the water; the shady banks, and, among the tree tops, the spires and pinnacles of Pundlik\u2019s and other large temples, is a scene of much life and beauty.\n\nThe 1872 census showed a population of 16,275 of whom 15,267 were Br\u00e1hmanic Hindus, 200 Jains, 804 Musalm\u00e1ns, and four Christians. The 1881 census showed a population of 16,910 or an increase of 635, of whom 15,680 were Br\u00e1hmanic Hindus, 371 Jains, and 859 Musalm\u00e1ns. The municipality was established in 1855. In 1882-83 it had an income of \u00a37622 (Rs. 76,220) and an expenditure of \u00a35422 (Rs. 54,220). The chief sources of income are a pilgrim tax yielding \u00a34178 (Rs. 41,780) and octroi yielding \u00a32207 (Rs. 22,070). The expenditure is chiefly on watersupply and conservancy, instruction, road repairs, and medical relief. The watersupply is from a storage reservoir about a mile south-west of the town built by the municipality in 1874 at a cost of \u00a321,614 (Rs. 2,16,140). From this reservoir water is carried to a service reservoir built close to the town by a line of iron piping 3700 feet long and from the service reservoir it is distributed through iron mains six to ten inches in diameter. The dispensary was established in 1863. In 1883 it\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Contributed by Mr. Sh\u00e1nt\u00e1r\u00e1m Vin\u00e1yak Kantak, L.M.Assist. Surgeon,Pandharpur.\ntreated fifty-six in-patients and 10,350 out-patients at a cost of \u00a3472 (Rs. 4720). The chief points of interest in Pandharpur are the river, the temples especially the temple of Vithoba, and the pilgrims averaging about 170,000 a year.\n\nThe river has eleven gh\u00e1ts or landings, three of which are unfinished. Beginning from the north the first is Krishn\u00e1ji\u2019s Gh\u00e1t, close to the north of the municipal office. It is seventy feet long by seventy wide and was built about 1825. The second flight of steps (26\u2019 \u00d7 14\u2019), over which is the municipal office, was built about 1785 by one Krishn\u00e1ji Naik Nargundkar, and is not now in use. A few steps still appear; the rest, if they were ever finished, are hid with earth. The part of the municipal building which stands over the steps the municipality has granted for a library and reading room. The third or Uddhav Gh\u00e1t (72\u2019 \u00d7 31\u2019), about 700 feet to the south of the second, lies a little to the south of the municipal office. It is covered with flagstones overlaid with murum. These steps, which were built about 1780 by one Gop\u00e1l Naik T\u00e1mbekar, are much used as at them pilgrims enter the bed of the river in the holy round or pradakshina of Pandharpur. Close to the north of the Uddhav steps, a stream which drains the northern suburb, falls into the Bhima at a spot known as Govind Har\u00ed\u2019s fall or dhabdhaba. About 180 feet south of the Uddhav steps, and separated from them by a Ling\u00e1yat monastery is the fourth or Harid\u00e1s landing (102\u2019 \u00d7 30\u2019). It was built about 1785 by one Hari J\u00e1nai Appa Harid\u00e1s, and is chiefly used, not by pilgrims, but by the people of the neighbourhood in fetching water. A pipal tree near is held in special veneration by barren women who offer vows to it and daily go round it in the hope that the god who lives in the tree will drive out the spirit of barrenness. About 500 feet south of Harid\u00e1s\u2019 landing and nearly opposite the Pandharpur dispensary is the Kumbh\u00e1r landing (60\u2019 \u00d7 36\u2019) built about 1770 by one R\u00e1mchandra Krishna Limaye. It is guarded by a large gate not now in use and is chiefly used by the people of the neighbourhood in fetching water. A little to the south of the Kumbh\u00e1r landing is the sixth landing (25\u2019 \u00d7 14\u2019) unfinished and unimportant, with only four or five ruined steps. It is said to have been built about 1790. Close to the south of the sixth and about 300 feet south of the Kumbh\u00e1r landing is the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r or Great Gate landing (132\u2019 \u00d7 36\u2019) the most important of all. It is nearly opposite the chief gate of the temple of Vithoba and is used by all who go to the river to bathe, to fetch water, or to visit Pundlik\u2019s temple. Many pilgrims prefer the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r to the Uddhav steps as a starting point for their holy round. After visiting Pundlik\u2019s temple they come direct to these steps, enter the river, and turn south. To the north and south of the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing, almost abutting on it, are the temples of R\u00e1mchandra the work of the famous temple-building princess \u00c1haly\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed Holkar (1735-1795), and of Dv\u00e1rk\u00e1dhish or Murlidh\u00e1r built by B\u00e1yj\u00e1b\u00e1i Sindia. This landing was built in 1785 by Chinto N\u00e1gesh Badya a priest of Vithoba\u2019s temple. About 300 feet to the south of the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing is the Kas\u00e1r landing (111\u2019 \u00d7 35\u2019). It was built about 1798 by one R\u00e1mr\u00e1v Javlekar Kulkarni and is chiefly used by the people of the neighbourhood in drawing water. To the south is a large enclosure with the tomb of an old Pandharpur Pandit known as P\u00e1dhy\u00e1.\nA hall or *sabh\u0101mandap* lately added to the tomb occasionally serves as a meeting place for the townspeople. About 300 feet south of the K\u00e1s\u00e1r landing is the Chandrabh\u00e1ga landing (54' \u00d7 42') built jointly about 1810 by B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Peshwa and a holy man from Chopda in Kh\u00e1ndesh. It is much used being the landing by which pilgrims enter the town from the bed of the river during their holy round. On the south is the temple of Chandrabh\u00e1ga which pilgrims have to keep on their right when they make the holy round. A strong masonry parapet wall leads about 600 feet to the tenth or Datta's landing (145' \u00d7 36') so called from a temple of Datta near it on the north-west. The landing was built about 1820 by Chint\u00e1ma\u1e47r\u00e1v or \u00c1pp\u00e1s\u00e1heb Patvardhan of S\u00e1ngli. It is close to the circuit road, as its landing has to be crossed by pilgrims. A small shrine of Mah\u00e1dev outside Datta's temple at its south-east corner is included in the circuit. To the south of Datta's landing at the extreme south end of the town is the last landing (37' \u00d7 20'). It is unfinished and was built about 1770 by one Gop\u00e1l Naik J\u00e1mbhekar. It is used chiefly by low caste people.\n\nBesides these eleven landings several stone pavements slope to the river. Though not of use to pilgrims as landings they are very useful for carts and carriages entering or leaving the town. A sloping pavement on the line of the B\u00e1rsi road made by the municipality is largely used by pony and bullock carts.\n\n---\n\n1 Vithoba's temple, the chief temple in Pandharpur, is near the centre of the part of the town which is considered holy and is called Pandharikshetra or the Holy Spot of Pandhari. It has a greatest length from east to west of 350 feet, and a greatest breadth from north to south of 170 feet. A paved passage with a greatest breadth of twenty-five feet runs round the temple enclosure. The temple is entered by six gates, two on the north, one on the west, one on the south, and two on the east. The chief entrance is the east or front gate, called the N\u00e1mdev Gate, after N\u00e1mdev the great thirteenth century devotee of Vithoba, who was of the Shimpi or tailor caste. On the river side the N\u00e1mdev gate faces the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r gh\u00e1\u1e6d or flight of steps which gets the name Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r because it faces the chief doorway of the temple. In the middle of the road leading from the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r steps to the temple, at the end of a lane, is a large arched gateway called the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r Gate. The N\u00e1mdev gate is reached by twelve steps. The entire first or lowest step and the front face of the step above it are plated with brass, and on the brass-plated face of the second step are carved fourteen small standing figures of N\u00e1mdev's family. N\u00e1mdev comes first with a tambourine or *tambura* in his hand as if performing a *kirtan* or service of sermon and song, and the women are clapping their hands in accompaniment. An inscription on the first step records that this brass plating is six years old and is the work of a man from Dh\u00e1r in Central India. Close to the right of the first step is a brass bust of N\u00e1mdev in Mar\u00e1tha dress. A ministrant of the Shimpi or tailor caste has charge of the bust but the offerings\n\n---\n\n1 The account of Vithoba's temple is contributed by Dr. Bhagv\u00e1nl\u00e1l Indraji, Hon. M.R.A.S.\ngo to the Badv\u00e1s or hereditary priests of Vithoba. According to the local belief N\u00e1mdev, who was an inhabitant of Pandharpur, has his tomb or sam\u00e1dh on this spot. P\u00e1d\u00fak\u00e1s or footprints of Vithoba are also worshipped in a tailor's house which is said to be N\u00e1mdev's house and which contains a tomb which also claims to be N\u00e1mdev's tomb. Opposite N\u00e1mdev's bust, to the right of the lane in a deep recess, is a stone about 2' 6\" high and 1' 6\" broad. This stone is worshipped as the abode of Chokh\u00e1mela an enthusiastic Mh\u00e1r devotee of Vithoba who is said to have flourished about 1278 (Shak 1200). The stone is dressed in Mar\u00e1tha fashion and is worshipped by Mh\u00e1rs, who, as they are not allowed to enter the temple, pay their respects to Vithoba from near this stone. The offerings made at this place are enjoyed by Mh\u00e1rs. A Shimpi sometimes holds a night-long kirtan or sermon and song service before N\u00e1mdev's stone and a Mh\u00e1r before Chokh\u00e1mela's stone. The steps lead to a porch, in the back wall of which the N\u00e1mdev gate opens on the temple. In the gateway are two pillars and two pilasters guarded by side railings of stone. The workmanship of the railing and of the pillars appears to belong to the time of the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs that is to about the twelfth century. The side walls of the gateway are of the same time and are carved like the wall of a temple of the twelfth century. Part of the south wall is well preserved. The faces of several of the figures in the porch and walls have been wilfully disfigured, probably by Musalm\u00e1ns. The old work of the gate has been restored and an upper storey of brick built over it to form a drum-house or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. Other brick work further hides the original stone masonry. The N\u00e1mdev gate posts are modern. Over the door post a Sanskrit inscription in Devn\u00e1gari characters of eleven lines each of twenty-three letters, bears date Shak 1540 (A.D. 1618) and records the making of the gate by Rukhm\u00e1ji Anant Pingal, who employed Krishna the son of Mur\u00e1ri as his agent. The N\u00e1mdev gate opens on a narrow passage with a roof resting on four arches and with three rooms on each side, the middle room on each side having an inner room. These rooms are occupied by devotees of Vithoba. On the left, between the third and fourth arches, is a recess with an image of Ganpati about four feet from the ground. Four steps lead down from the passage to a large paved quadrangle about 120' \u00d7 60'. The quadrangle is divided into two parts, an east half partly tiled and partly open, and a west half called the sabh\u00e1mandap covered with a tiled roof. The roof over part of the east half is said to have been built for the kirtans or song services of Ganduji B\u00e1va in the time of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the last Peshwa (1796-1817). In this part on the left on an altar is a nim tree and on the right is a lamp-pillar about thirty feet high. Near the lamp-pillar is a large stone jar or r\u00e1njan now filled with water. It is locally called the jar or r\u00e1njan of Bodhlya B\u00e1va, a devotee of Vithoba of Dh\u00e1mangaon village in Poona whose tomb or sam\u00e1dh is in a shrine or closet close to the jar. This r\u00e1njan is so like the toll-jar or r\u00e1njan on the Deccan side of the N\u00e1na pass\u00b9 and other stone Devgiri Y\u00e1dav (1170-1318) toll-jars that it seems likely to have been used to gather a pilgrim-\n\n\u00b9 Compare Bombay Gazetteer, XIV. 290.\ntax or some other levy. In the open part of the quadrangle are two more lamp-pillars about thirty feet high, one in the middle the other to the left. The left lamp-pillar is said to have been built by one of the Holkars. Behind the middle pillar on a quadrangular altar is a vrindavan or basil stand. The open part of the quadrangle leads to the wooden sabh\u0101mandap or hall which fills about half the length of the entire quadrangle and is about forty-five feet high. From the roof hangs a central wooden chandelier with chain and brackets all carved out of one piece of wood. The hall is said to have been built by the B\u0101dv\u0101s. It begins with a four-pillared chhatri or shade over an altar and within the chhatri in the middle a small stone shrine with a figure of Garud. On another altar close to the left was a tree which died and has been removed. Further within the hall, a little to the right of the centre is a small square flat-roofed shrine with an image of M\u0101ruti. The hall is now used for song services and devotional dances. The floors of the quadrangle and of the temple are crowded with the names of pilgrims who have them carved under the belief that the touch of devotee's feet will purify their names. Several round holes in the floor and on the steps are marks of vows to present the god with money. The practice, which still continues, is to hammer the Mar\u0101tha silver coin bearing the elephant goad mark deep enough into the floor to make a hole. This hammering turns the coin into a cup. Some holes remain with cup-shaped coins in them but from most the coins have disappeared.\n\nOn each side of the quadrangle runs a cloister or veranda with an inner and an outer row of arches. The inner arches have been filled and made into doorways, each leading to a small room where a devotee lives. The cloisters seem to be the work of more than one builder. Many of them have no record, but in front of part of the right cloister, between the third and fourth outer arches and on the fourth outer arch, are two inscriptions giving the names of builders. The inscriptions seem to show that the right cloister and probably also the left cloister were built about 1738. The first three of the right cloister rooms were built by two sons of a man named Shiv and the next four were made in the same year by Trimbakr\u0101v Pethe, better known as Trimbakr\u0101v M\u0101ma a distinguished general under the fourth Peshwa M\u0101dhavr\u0101v (1761-1772). Both inscriptions show that the temple was then called P\u0101ndurang Nilo, that is the nilaya (Sk.) or residence of P\u0101ndurang, a name of Vithoba which occurs in several old songs or abhangs. Six porch-covered steps lead from the quadrangle up to a narrow mandap or hall (50' \u00d7 10'). In the quadrangle to the left of the porch a large unused bell hangs from a massive beam of wood. The bell is of Indian make about 2' 6\" in height and about the same in diameter at the base. The hall or mandap rests on two rows each of six pillars and ten pilasters, two in each side wall and six in the back wall. The ceiling is formed of large blocks of dressed stone resting on the pillars and pilasters in the cut-corner style. Over two of the middle pillars is an old block 7' 6\" long 1' 2\" broad and 9\" thick. It is part either of a pilaster or of a door post of the old temple and on its three faces has a Sanskrit inscription in Devn\u0101gari characters dated Shak 1159 (A.D. 1237). The beginning and\nthe end of the inscription are hidden by part of the pillar capital. The letters are very shallow and as the slab forms part of the roof and is in the dark the whole of the inscription can hardly be read without taking out the stone. What can be made out shows that the inscription belongs to a king named Someshvar who calls himself of the Y\u00e1dav dynasty. His attributes are almost the same as those of the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs. He does not appear to be a petty Y\u00e1dav chief as he calls himself the Beloved of the Earth Prithvi-Vallabha, the Great king of kings Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1dhird\u00e1ja, and Sarvar\u00e1ja-chud\u00e1man\u00ed that is the crown jewel of all kings, all attributes worthy of a great king. In the accepted list of the Devgiri Y\u00e1dav kings the date Shak 1159 (A.D. 1237) falls in the reign of Singhana II. (1209-1247). The probable explanation of this apparent disagreement may be that Someshvar is another name of Singhana or of his son Jaitugi II. who reigned in his father\u2019s lifetime. The inscription goes on to state that Someshvar conquered the ruler of the country round and encamped at Pandarige on the bank of the Bhimarathi or Bhima. At that time (1237) Pandharpur was therefore apparently called Pandarige, a name which appears to be of K\u00e1narese origin as many K\u00e1narese place names end in ge. In the inscription Pandarige is called Mah\u00e1gr\u00e1ma or a great village and the god is twice called Viththal, the form of his name which is still current. Vithoba appears to have then also been worshipped, and the story of the boon to Pundlik which is still current, seems to have then also been in vogue with the only difference that Pundarika is here called a sage or muni. This proves that in the thirteenth century Viththal was already a god of long standing. The inscription mentions a gift to the god out of the yearly presents from the people of Hiriyagaranja village probably, as H and P interchange in K\u00e1narese, the modern Pulunj about fifteen miles east of Pandharpur where a well engraved inscription of the Y\u00e1dav king Singhana II. has been found.\n\nIn the back wall of the hall or mandap are three gates, of which the middle gateway and gates have been elaborately and cleverly plated with brass and ornamented. On one post is a figure of Vishnu\u2019s attendant Jaya and on the other post of Vijaya each with a small fly-whisk bearer. On the threshold are carved a fame-face or kirti-mukh and a chakra or discus, and on the outstanding front of the lintel is an image of Ganpati. The door post and two front pilasters are plain but handsome. A brass chhatra or shade carved in leaf pattern projects from the lintel over the pilasters. Above the chhatra is lotus tracery in panels and above the lotus tracery is some carving in the k\u00e1ngra or boss pattern. In the k\u00e1ngra carving two inscriptions record that the carving was the work of two T\u00e1bats who were employed by some one whose name is not given. Probably each of the T\u00e1bats completed one side. In the porch in front of the hall or mandap is a still used bell of European make 1\u2019 4\u201d in diameter at the base and 1\u2019 8\u201d high. It bears the following inscription:\n\nVENTVRAFES 1634\n\nand a little below\n\nLDV A DOSEAOS ANTIS IMD SACRAMENTO\nAccording to a Marathi inscription in the right wall, this hall or mandap was built in the bright half of M\u00e2gh or February-March in Shak 1543 (A.D. 1621) Durmati Samvatsar by M\u00e2nkoji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan and \u00c1pp\u00e1ji, inhabitants of Ped, sons of Bh\u00e1nuri H\u00e1soba N\u00e2yak son of Kukoba N\u00e2yak and H\u00e1soba's wife Gang\u00e1i. To the left of the middle gateway in the back wall of the mandap is a large niche with an image of Ganesh daubed with redlead. To the right of the gateway is a black stone four-armed image of Sarasvati about 2' 6\" high sitting on a lotus. The upper right hand holds a lotus and the lower holding a garland rests on the right knee, the upper left holds an axe and the lower left a long rectangular block apparently a manuscript. The side gateways are plain and have iron grating in the doors. The middle gateway leads to what is called the Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb or sixteen-pillared hall or mandap. This is a large hall (41' 6\" x 45' 6\") apparently later than the last hall and said to have been built about 100 years ago by a Dandkar (inhabitant of Daud) Shenvi. The hall has four rows of four pillars and four pilasters in each wall. The workmanship of the pillars is an imitation of the old Devgiri Y\u00e1day pillars in the N\u00e1mdev gate porch. In a square part in the middle of the pillars is a sculpture with scenes from Krishna's life, the Machchha and Kachchha or fish and tortoise the first and second incarnations of Vishnu, three fish with one face in the Musalm\u00e1n style, and some ducks. Over each group of four pillars is a dome in the cut corner style, eight of which, at the suggestion of the Sanitary Commissioner, have been opened for light and air. In the front wall of the hall are three gates, the middle gate old and the side gates recently opened at the suggestion of the Sanitary Commissioner. The north wall has three more gates and the south wall two. In front of the two south gates a veranda passes from south to west. In the east or back wall of the south part of the veranda are four rooms with images. The part of the veranda which goes towards the west has two rows of pillars five in each row. The whole work, veranda rooms and pillars, is strong and of fine masonry. An inscription on one of the rooms records that the work was done in Shak 1771 (A.D. 1849) by Men\u00e1b\u00e1i the wife of A'nandr\u00e1v Pav\u00e1r of Dh\u00e1r in Central India. Men\u00e1b\u00e1i also built the wooden mandap to the south of Lakshmi's temple and supplied a boat in the Bhima.\n\nFacing the north gates of the Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb mandap is a detached veranda with seven rooms in its back wall. The veranda roof is supported on two rows each of six plain pillars. Going from left to right, the rooms have a ling of K\u00e1shivishvan\u00e1th, images of R\u00e1m and Lakshman, a small K\u00e1lbhairav riding a dog plated with brass, a small ling called R\u00e1meshvar on a high sh\u00e1tunkha, Datt\u00e1traya, and Narsoa. The last room is empty. These rooms are said to be the work of a Badva named K\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ba. Near the east end of the narrow passage between these rooms and the Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb hall, in a recess, is a large inscribed slab 4' 10\" long by 2' 9\" broad. It is locally called chaury\u00e1shi or eighty-four and the Badv\u00e1s tell pilgrims to rub their backs against it to escape the eighty-four millions of births destined for every unrubbed human soul. A modern image of Devi has been fixed on the slab and the recess has been fitted with a\nmodern door. The true origin of the name chaury\u00e1shi is that the slab is dated Shak 1194, and as the third figure looks like 8, the Bady\u00e1s read it eighty-four or chaury\u00e1shi and connected it with the story of the eighty-four million births. In the first line of the inscription a salutation is offered to Viththal or Vithoba and then, after the date Shak 1194 (A.D. 1272), follows a description in parallel columns of numerous gifts offered monthly to the temple by several devotees. The gifts mentioned belong to various times, and give in short the names of the devotee and his gift. As none are written in full they are hard to make out. The first inscription runs Shripati Danna ki data ga. || deya danda o phule 100 van. || which probably means the gift by one Shripati Danna of one gadi\u00e1no (a month) yielding daily 100 flowers to be offered to the god. The same column contains the following in Mar\u00e1thi: Shak 1198 Dh\u00e1ta samvatsaru M\u00e1gh Shudi 2 Buddhe y\u00e1davi K\u00e1la Hem\u00e1di panditi Dh\u00e1mana datta ga. deya danda || recording on Wednesday the bright second of M\u00e1gh (February-March) Shak 1198 (A.D. 1276) Dh\u00e1ta Samvatsar in the Y\u00e1davi period by Pandit Hem\u00e1di, the gift of Dh\u00e1mana gady\u00e1na.\u00b9 This Pandit Hem\u00e1di no doubt is the minister Hem\u00e1dri of the great Devgiri Y\u00e1dav R\u00e1mcandra (A.D. 1271-1310) from whose piety and bounty all the early Hindu temples of the North Bombay Deccan and Kh\u00e1ndesh are locally known as Hem\u00e1dpanti. The next gift, which is dated Shak 1199 (A.D. 1277) Ishvar samvatsar, gives the name of the king as Shri R\u00e1mcandra devr\u00e1y.\n\nOf the sixteen pillars in the Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb hall the base and capital of the second in the second row are plated with gold and its shaft which is plated with silver bears a small figure of Vishnu\u2019s vulture Garud. Pilgrims embrace the pillar and make money offerings to it. It is said to stand in the place of an old Garud pillar which stood in front of Vishnu\u2019s shrine before the Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb hall was built. In the back wall of the mandap a door leads to a smaller hall called the Four-pillared or Chaukh\u00e1mb. This door has lately been widened to make the passage for pilgrims easier. With this Chaukh\u00e1mb begins the original temple. The Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb between this Chaukh\u00e1mb and the mandap is modern. The original temple included the usual hall, antechamber, and shrine or garbh\u00e1g\u00e1r. The Chaukh\u00e1mb had two gates one on the south where are two old stone elephants near the steps and one leading to the Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb. Though, as it is now joined with the Sol\u00e1kh\u00e1mb, no steps remain on the east, the east gate like the south gate must originally have had steps with elephants. The Chaukh\u00e1mb is 22' 2\" broad by 19' 10\" long and has four central pillars which give it its name. In the walls are four pilasters. The roof is in the cut-stone dome style and has lately been pierced in six places for air. The north wall has no gate, and a deep recess faces the south gate. Near the north-east corner of the hall a second recess is used as the god\u2019s bedchamber or shejghar and is furnished with a silver couch \u2018with bed clothes and some of the raiment. In front of the south gate over the steps is a modern roof. From the four-pillared\n\n\u00b9 Gady\u00e1na appears to be the name of a coin. In Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r gadi\u00e1no is still the name of a gold and silver weight equal to about half a tola or rupee weight.\nhall a later arch resting on two later pillars carved in the Moghal style leads into the antechamber which is about nine feet square, and, except some empty niches in the side wall, is plain. A hole and two air shafts have lately been made in the roof to give more air. From the antechamber a small door (3' \u00d7 3') leads down to the shrine or garbhag\u00e1r a small room about eight feet square with nothing of architectural interest except a quarter pilaster at each corner. In the middle is a wooden bar about eight inches thick to prevent overcrowding. Attached to the back wall is a square altar three feet high with a silver shade, and under the shade on a base fixed in the altar a standing unsupported image of Vithoba, variously called P\u00e1ndurang, Pandhari, Viththal, Viththaln\u00e1th, and Vithoba. Vithoba is a short form of Viththalb\u00e1va that is Father or Dear Viththal. The Y\u00e1day inscriptions make it probable that the oldest of these names is Viththal; Viththal does not appear to be a Sanskrit name, nor, though several attempts have been made, can the word be correctly traced to any Sanskrit root. The name is probably K\u00e1marese. P\u00e1ndurang is a Sanskritised form of Pandaraga that is belonging to, or of Pandarge, the old name of Pandharpur. The form Pandhari appears also to come from the old name of the village. The form Viththaln\u00e1th or Lord Viththal is used by the people of Gujar\u00e1t who generally add n\u00e1th to the names of gods as in Shr\u00edn\u00e1th, Vrishabhan\u00e1th, and Dv\u00e1rk\u00e1n\u00e1th. The chhatri or shade was made in 1873, when also the altar was built, somewhat further forward than before to prevent pilgrims embracing the god. Formerly pilgrims both embraced the god and touched his feet. Now the feet are touched and they are polished smooth by the constant rubbing. The saffron-bathing or kesharsn\u00e1n of the god by pilgrims, which before that was usual, has also been stopped since 1873. In 1873, also, a silver back or pithika with a five-hooded cobra in the middle, three peacocks and fancy tigers on each side, and a faceface or kirtimukh at the top, has been removed. The changes in 1873 were due to injuries received by the god. Two Gos\u00e1vi mendicants while embracing the image gave it a push and the image fell and broke its legs between the knees and the ankles. The Bady\u00e1s do not tell what exactly happened. The local belief is that the mendicants broke the image with a stone, because the god did not eat a fruit which they had offered. But this is less likely than the story that the image was thrown over by a shove either wilful or accidental. To avoid inquiry and noise the Bady\u00e1s silently drove out the mendicants and kept the temple closed for two or three days. According to one story during these days a new image was installed, but examination shows that the present image is the old image patched at the break; it is said, by iron or copper rods from within. Besides being mended the image has also been strengthened by a support from behind up to the knee. The image is about three feet nine inches high and together with its base seems to be cut out of one block of trap. Its rough appearance is probably the effect of time. The base is about one foot square and its height cannot be fixed as much of it has been built into the altar, leaving a slice about 1\u00bd inches thick which is locally\nbelieved to be a brick to suit the Pundlik story of Vithoba waiting on a brick.\\footnote{Details are given below p. 433.} The image is standing with its arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips, the left hand holding a conch and the right hand a chakra or discus. On the image are carved, but so slightly as to be hardly noticeable except on close examination, a waistcloth, and round the waist a kambarband or waistband, the end of which hangs on the right thigh. The ornaments consist of a necklace and in the long ears earrings which touch the shoulders. On the head is a long round-topped cap. The general workmanship of the image is earlier than the medieval Rajput style of the Anhilvad Chaulukyas (943-1240), the Devgiri Yadavs (1150-1310), or the Ajmer Chohans (685-1198). The dress and ornament of the image belong to a little later than the Guptas, probably not later than the fifth or sixth century after Christ. As far as is known no other existing Vaishnav temple in India has an image of Vishnu like the Pandharpur image, but there are two similar images of the third century after Christ in the Udayagiri Brahmanical caves near Bhilsa. The images are in two of the four cells to the left of a large image of Vishnu reclining on his serpent couch. Like the Pandharpur image these are both standing figures with arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips and a conch and discus in the hands. This type of image represented Vishnu only in his form of Hari.\n\nOn the outside of the shrine are images of Narsinh, Radhakrishna, and Sheshshayi whose workmanship shows that the present temple is not earlier than the sixteenth century. These images have been wilfully disfigured especially about the face, which shows that this temple also must have suffered probably from Musalmans. The temple spire or shikhar which is about sixty feet high is in the modern Maratha style and was built about 1830 by a chief of Bhor.\n\nBehind Vithoba's temple, in the north-east corner of the enclosure facing east, is a temple of Vithoba's wife Rakhumai, that is Rakhuma-ai or Mother Rakhuma, the same as Rukmini the wife of Krishna. The image is held next in importance to Vithoba. Rakhumai's temple has now a shrine, an antechamber, a hall, and a wooden outer hall or sabhamandap. It originally consisted of a shrine and antechamber, whose work is later than the sixteenth century work in Vithoba's temple. The hall and wooden outer hall or sabhamandap are modern additions, the hall being the work of Chandulal a famous minister of the Nizam. The wooden sabhamandap is about forty feet square and forty feet high, and has a lamp-pillar to the north of it. Four steps covered by a porch lead up from the outer hall to the main hall which rests on six pillars and eight pilasters. A door (6' x 3') in its back wall leads to the antechamber with four pilasters and four quarter pillars in the corners. In its right or north wall is a recess used as the bedchamber of the goddess. In the south wall is a gate which appears to be later than the temple. The gate leads to Radha's and other small modern shrines on the south. A door in the back wall of the antechamber leads to the shrine. This is about eleven feet square, and in its\nback wall, on a four feet high silver-plated altar, has an image of Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed about three feet high with a silver plated back or pithika of the same style and ornaments as that which Vithoba had before he was broken in 1873. The image of Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed which is generally dressed like a Mar\u00e1tha woman, is modern in the Karn\u00e1tak style and much later than Vithoba\u2019s image. In front of the altar is a wooden bar to keep pilgrims from crowding. Close to the south of Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed\u2019s temple are three small rooms with a front veranda resting on two rows each of eight pillars. The first room has an image of Satyabh\u00e1ma and the second of R\u00e1hi or R\u00e1dhika. The images and the rooms are both very modern. In the veranda is a navagraha slab with figures of the nine planets. It is an old stone of the Devgiri Y\u00e1dav period and seems to have been brought from some old temple. Close by are two other rooms in a veranda built about 1850. The second room has two doors and contains images of Surya and Ganesh. Close by, beyond a lane, are two small image rooms built by a Badya named Manba Raghn\u00e1th. Further on are two snake-stones or nd\u00edgob\u00e1s.\n\nA little to the south of the original part of Vithoba\u2019s temple is a temple of Lakshmi in four parts, a shrine, an antechamber, a mandap, and a porch. The shrine, which is about eight feet broad by six deep, has on an altar along its back wall a white marble image of Lakshmi about two feet high with a brass back or pithika in the same style as Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed\u2019s back. The antechamber is 8\u2019 6\u201d broad by 7\u2019 deep and has in front of it a square hall resting on four pillars, and now partitioned into two rooms. The left room has an image of Annapurna and the right room is empty. The porch in front is small and has five steps leading to it. The temple of Lakshmi was built about 1830 by Kavde merchants of Gurs\u00e1la.\n\nTo the south of Lakshmi\u2019s temple is a veranda with six arches in the Moghal style and three rooms. The first left arch has been closed with a wooden lattice to make an image-room. Between the veranda and Lakshmi\u2019s room is a wooden hall or mandap with a tiled roof about forty feet high. This wooden hall and the veranda are said to be the work of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the last Peshwa (1796-1817). About fifteen feet south-east of Lakshmi\u2019s temple is a small modern shrine of Vishnu called Vyankoba. It has a spire like a Musalm\u00e1n dome with four minarets. Near the shrine is Vyankoba\u2019s gate.\n\nThe staff of priests and attendants in the great temple of Vithoba includes Badv\u00e1s, Puj\u00e1ris or ministrants, Ben\u00e1ris or hymnists, Par\u00edch\u00e1raks or bathmen, Har\u00edd\u00e1s or singers, Dingres or barbers, D\u00e1nges or mace-bearers, and Divtes or lightmen. All are Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans, but all do not follow the same Veda. Badv\u00e1s, Puj\u00e1ris, Ben\u00e1ris, Dingres, and Divtes follow the K\u00e1nva section of the Yajurveda; Har\u00edd\u00e1s and D\u00e1nges belong to the M\u00e1dhya\u00f1din branch of the Yajurveda, and Par\u00edch\u00e1raks are Rigvedis. There are eighty families of Badv\u00e1s, eight of Puj\u00e1ris, fifteen of Ben\u00e1ris, eighteen of Par\u00edch\u00e1raks, twenty-five of Har\u00edd\u00e1s, twenty of Dingres, three of D\u00e1nges, and one of Divtes. Except the Badv\u00e1s the rest are called sev\u00e1dh\u00e1ris or the servants of the god and have hereditary rights of personal service. The Puj\u00e1ris or ministrants take the chief\npart in the worship of the god. They remove and put on ornaments, flowers, garlands, and sandal paste, and wave lights in front of the god, and are present at all services and light-wavings. The Ben\u00e1ri or hymnist directs the worship and repeats hymns or mantras at different stages; he is present at the morning and night services but seldom appears at the evening light-waving. The Parich\u00e1rak or bathman brings in a large silver dish the water with which the ministrant washes the god. He also brings the lamp for waving at the evening and night services. The evening lamp called dhup\u00e1rti or incense lamp contains thin cotton wicks in bundles soaked in clarified butter, camphor, frankincense sticks, and holy ashes for the sticks to stand in. The night light or shej\u00e1rti holds only butter-soaked wicks and camphor. The bathman is also expected to hand the lighted torch at the early morning service known as the k\u00e1kudd\u00e1rti or wick-waving. The Harid\u00e1s, or slave of Hari, sings a few verses generally five from which he gets his name of Panchpadi. The verses are generally in honour of the god and are sung at the morning evening and night services. At the morning and evening services the Harid\u00e1s stands outside the antechamber with cymbals and sings, and, after waving the evening light round the god, accompanies the bathman and the maceman round the temple, visiting the smaller deities and singing while the others wave the lights. During the night service he stands in the sixteen-pillared chamber on the slab known as the stage slab or rangshila and sings to the accompaniment of music. The Dingre or barber at the early morning service holds a mirror in front of the god after he has been dressed and before the light has been waved. The Dingre also spreads a strip of cloth or p\u00e1ulghadi on the way to the bedchamber at the time of the night worship. The Divte or torch-bearer holds a lighted torch or mash\u00e1l when the last night ceremony is over. He stands with a lighted brass or silver torch to the left of the antechamber after the Dingre has spread the cloth on the floor up to the bedstead of the god. He goes with the god\u2019s litter when his sandals are carried ni the torchlight procession thrice a year on the full-moon of \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or June-July, and K\u00e1rtik or October-November, and on Dasra Night in September-October. The D\u00e1ng\u00e9 or mace-bearer stands with his silver or gold plated mace outside the antechamber at the morning, evening, and night services. He accompanies the palanquin at the three-yearly torchlight processions. After the evening light-waving before Vithoba and the minor gods the mace-bearer goes out and serves holy ashes to pilgrims outside of the temple in the west part of the town, while the Parich\u00e1rak or bathman goes out and serves ashes and the holy-waved light among pilgrims in the east of the town. The Badv\u00e1s claim to own the temple, and, until within the last few years took no part in the worship of the god. They are the guardians of the temple property and of the god\u2019s jewels. Within the last few years the Badv\u00e1s have begun to wash the god\u2019s feet, wave a light, and sing songs after the sleep-light or shej\u00e1rti has been waved.\n\nThe goddess Rakhum\u00e1i has only one set of priests known as Utp\u00e1ts of whom there are about 100 families. These priests have all the rights of personal service and are of minor importance in point of wealth and influence. They are Rigvedi Deshasth Br\u00e1h-\nmans. They have no connection with the ministrants or puja\u0301ris of the goddess. The Utp\u00e1ts as well as the Badv\u00e1s are divided into four sections Malh\u00e1rs, Sh\u00e1mr\u00e1js, T\u00e1nb\u00e1s, and Timanchis who intermarry but are considered to belong to different family stocks. The object of these divisions in both cases is the same. A death or a birth makes all the members of the family stock impure for ten days and unfit to perform the god\u2019s service. Unless the priests were divided into different stocks the whole service of the god would be at a stand. No women singers, dancers or prostitutes, and no ascetic monks are connected with the temple. Musicians and others paid by the temple committee are stationed in the drum-room or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na on the upper floor of the chief doorway of the temple. Except the shoemaker all the servants live in the loft above the main doorway known as N\u00e1mdev\u2019s gate, and, although serving in the temple, are answerable only to the committee. The temple committee was established under the Peshw\u00e1s. The grant was originally intended for keeping horses in connection with the chariot of the god Vithoba and another object of the grant was the establishment of the musicians and other servants mentioned above. The yearly cash income at the disposal of this committee, exclusive of garden land assessed at \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18), is about \u00a3308 (Rs. 3080). In addition to the maintenance of this establishment the committee has other expenses the chief of which is a charity for feeding Br\u00e1hmans of whom seven outsiders or strangers are fed daily. The committee also provides oil for lamps in the idol chambers of the god and goddess and other parts of the temple inhabited by ascetics, and for the daily and holiday services of the god and goddess. The committee is appointed by the Collector, the members being life members, with no responsibility attached to their actions and no control over them.\n\nThe ordinary service of the god takes place five times every day and night. The service is of two kinds, puja or worship in the early morning and \u00e1rti or light-waving which is performed four times in the twenty-four hours. The temple work is done by the priests in turn. The Badv\u00e1s as the chief priests are the managers and trustees of the temple. As they are the most numerous body, almost equal to the whole of the other priests and ministrants, they get the chief share of the offerings. Except during the three principal fairs when the month\u2019s proceeds are farmed, every night at twelve they put to auction and sell the right to the next day\u2019s offerings. Each of the four sections of the Badv\u00e1s gets a day so that they follow one another in rotation and the sum bid for the right to the offerings goes to the section whose turn it is to officiate. Except in the case of paupers and disreputable persons who have to give security the right to the offerings is generally given to the highest bidder. The offering contractor or day-man called divaskar makes his bid subject to the following conditions. He must provide oil for all the lamps in the temple for that day and night, the expense being about 2s. (Re. 1). He pays 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) to the Br\u00e1hman temple servant, who washes the idol chamber, washes the clothes of the god, and prepares water for the god\u2019s bath. He has a right to all money gifts placed at the feet of the god which are less than 2s.\nEvery offering of money, ornaments, or clothes worth more than a rupee goes to the whole body of Badv\u00e1s. For every feet-worship or p\u0101dyapuja he gets 2s. (Re.1) if ordinary ornaments are put on the god and more if costly ornaments are put on. The amount of the bid is influenced by the number of pilgrims in the town, the occurrence of a holiday, and any unusual inflow of respectable pilgrims anxious to spend money and perhaps to perform a great worship or mah\u0101puja. The farming day-priest or div\u0101shar comes to the temple at about three in the morning, bathed and dressed in a silk waistcloth, carrying the key of the door of the four-pillared chamber. Before he opens the door the Ben\u0101r\u012b or hymnist as well as the Puj\u0101r\u012b or ministrant and the Parich\u0101rak or bath-man are all present bathed and dressed in silk. The day-man and the ministrant stand with folded hands and the day-man humbly begs the deity to awake. The day-man opens the door, and, removing the eatables which were placed over-night in the bed chamber, locks the bed chamber and offers the god butter and sugarcandy. The other priests or sev\u0101dh\u0101ris, who according to their number serve by daily or monthly turns, all come in except the Harid\u0101s or singer who stands in the four-pillared chamber. No unbathed pilgrim is allowed to enter the god-room. Then comes the k\u0101k\u0101d\u0101rti or waving the torch a white muslin roll three or four inches long. It is dipped in clarified butter, and is brought by a Badva and paid for by one of the pilgrims. It is handed to the Parich\u0101rak or bath-man who gives it to the ministrant while all present sing aloud. The ministrant very slowly waves the torch in front of Vithoba from the head to the feet. Numbers come daily to see the god\u2019s face by the light of the torch as this is lucky, especially on the Hindu New Year\u2019s Day in March-April and on Dasra in September-October, when hundreds of people come. When the singing and waving are over, the day-priest hands the ministrant a silver cup with some fresh butter or loni and sugarcandy which the ministrant offers to the god and puts in his mouth. The ministrant again waves lighted wicks and camphor round the god but without singing. The ministrant takes off the last night\u2019s garlands and washes the feet of the god first with milk and then with water. Lighted frankincense sticks are waved in front of the god, fruit or naivedya is offered, and once more lights are waved and songs are sung. The Ben\u0101r\u012b or hymnist recites some V\u0113dik hymns and all the priests throw flowers on the god and shout Jay Jay, Victory Victory. The service proper or puja now begins. The Parich\u0101rak or bath-man brings water in a silver dish and the ministrant unrobes the god, pours milk, then curds, then clarified butter, then honey, and then sugar, one after the other over the god, the hymnist reciting hymns and verses. While the god is naked a cloth is drawn across the door so that no outsider may see. While the clarified butter is being poured over the god a lump of butter and sugarcandy is put in his mouth. After the god has been rubbed with sugar he is washed all over with water. Before he was broken by the Shaiy enthusiast in 1873 the god was washed in warm water. Since the left leg was cemented cold water mixed with saffron has been used instead of hot. Besides the bath a stream of water is poured over Vithoba\u2019s head from a\nconch shell while the hymnists and others recite verses from the Purushasukta a famous Vedik hymn. After his bath Vithoba is wiped dry and dressed in new clothes provided by the Badv\u00e1s, the face is wiped and made to shine with scented oil. A turban is bound round the god's head, sandal paste is rubbed on his brow, and flower garlands are thrown round his neck. The barber or Dingre then holds a mirror in front of the god. The god's feet are washed and rubbed with sandal, burning frankincense sticks are waved, and sweets are offered. Then comes the second light-waving. In this waving called ek\u00e1rti either a metal instrument is used at the upper end of which is a bowl with a lip on one side where thin cotton wicks soaked in clarified butter are laid and lighted and behind it a flat part where camphor is kept and lighted; or another metal incense burner called dhup\u00e1rti, in which holy ashes from an agnihotri or firekeeping Br\u00e1hman support incense sticks. While the priests and pilgrims sing songs the ministrant holds a flat piece of wood on which the second burner is set, waves it, and then takes the first burner and waves it. The incense burner or dhup\u00e1rti is handed to the D\u00e1ng\u00e9 or mace-bearer, and the lighted lamp or ek\u00e1rti to the bath-man who holds a bell in his left hand. Then, along with the songster or Harid\u00e1s, the mace-bearer and the bath-man go round waving the incense and the light round all the smaller deities. This ends the three morning services, the two light-wavings and the worship or puja. The bath-men singers and barber now leave and the Badva and ministrant stay changing their silk waistcloths for linen ones. After the morning services, about three in the afternoon and a little earlier on holidays, comes the dressing or posh\u00e1kh. The ministrant removes the old sandal mark, washes the face, and rubs fresh sandal-paste on the brow of the idol. He takes away the old clothes and puts on new ones applying scented oil to the face with an offering of food. On holidays costly ornaments are put on and the dress, the turban or crown, the waistcloth and the shouldercloth, are all of thin plates of gold. After the god is dressed pilgrims come to take darshan or see him. The visitors keep coming till evening when a fresh dhup\u00e1rti or incense-waving is held. The bath-man brings a ready filled incense burner and waving lamp and the Badva brings a copper dish with flowers, flower garlands, nosegays, sandal powder, rice, and a silver plate with food. The ministrant washes the feet of the idol with water brought by the Badva in a pot, the old sandal paste is removed, and fresh paste with rice and sandal oil is applied. Flower garlands are thrown round the neck and nosegays are stuck in the corners between the hips and hands. Then with songs, generally sung by the ministrants, burning frankincense and camphor lamps are waved, food is offered, hymns are repeated by all the priests present, and flowers are thrown over the god. The incense and light are carried and waved round the minor deities as in the morning. The bath-man takes the wick-lamp or ek\u00e1rti and ashes in a cloth and goes round the east of the town putting ashes on pilgrims' brows and shewing them the lamp. The mace-bearer takes ashes and\n\n1 Compare Muir's Sanskrit Texts, I.7-11.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nPandharpur, Vithoba's Temple. Worship.\n\nserves them in the north and west of the town. The pilgrims give presents and this like other sources of revenue is farmed every year. On ordinary days oil-sellers pour a little oil in the lamp, some give a betelnut, some an almond, while on the eleventh or ek\u0101dashi almost every one to whom the light is shewn gives a copper. The last daily ceremony is the sleep-lightwaving or shej\u0101rti about ten and on holidays at twelve. Almost all the officiating priests attend this waving. The barber or Dingre sprinkles a little water on the floor between the throne and the bedchamber door and sweeps it; the Badya comes, opens the bedchamber door, arranges the bed clothes, lights a lamp, and sets near the bed a cup of boiled sweet milk, some sweets, and a spittoon. He also brings water to wash the god's feet. The barber, after sweeping the path draws figures in white and coloured powders on the floor, and, from the throne to the bedchamber, spreads an eighteen-inch broadcloth covered with a cow's and Krishna's footprints. The mace-bearer, barber, and hymnist stand in the antechamber, the hymnist offers a Sanskrit prayer and the ministrant washes the god's feet. Before the ministrant undresses the god the hymnist from the antechamber waves a wick light or ek\u0101rti brought by the bath-man. The ministrant undresses the god, rubs sandal paste and rice on his brow, puts on freshly washed clothes and folds a fresh turban, throws garlands round his neck and puts a nosegay in his hands, with songs waves the wick lamp and the incense stick, and offers sweets. Hymns and verses are recited and flowers thrown on the god. Except the two Badv\u00e1s all the priests leave the room. The Badv\u00e1s wave five lights one after another round the god singing songs. The day-priest or farmer washes the chamber, locks the door of the four-pillared chamber, and retires. Thus end the day's services and the one-day farm of the day-man. No ornaments are kept in the temple. All are in charge of Badv\u00e1s who are responsible for them.\n\nThe god's special days are Wednesday and Saturday, unless they happen to be no-moon or twelfth days or the ominous conjunctions vyatip\u00e1t or vaidhriti. On these days after the early morning disrobing and before the five-nectar bath, the god is washed with scented oil, sweet scented powder or argaja, and milk. Another special day is the eleventh or ek\u0101dashi on which all Vithoba's devotees fast. On lunar elevenths the daily service is as usual except that the night sweets have been cooked without water and that a wake is kept all night by the god who does not go to his bedroom, and till four in the morning the day farmer and the ministrant watch at the door of the four-pillared room. During the two large June-July and October-November fairs except the proper worship or puja in the mornings all these daily services are stopped and the bedchamber remains closed. The god is supposed to be fatigued, and on the wash-worship or praksh\u00e1l-puja day, which falls about ten days after these great fair days, most elaborate anointing and sugar-rubbing are required to soothe the weary god. The articles of food used by pilgrims on fast days are sweets, milk, groundnuts, and mashed dates. Some eat nothing at all, while others take bread, rice, and vegetables, which are baked before being mixed with water.\n\nThe oldest thing in the temple is the image, which resembles, as has been said, some Udayagiri sculptures near Bhilsa of the fourth\ncentury, while from the dress with the waistband hanging on the thigh the necklace and earrings it seems certainly earlier than the medi\u00e6val Rajput images of about the ninth century. The dome-like headdress in particular resembles that of images in the B\u0101d\u0101mi caves (6th and 7th centuries), but is of a simpler and apparently earlier character. The earliest inscription in the temple which bears date Shak 1159 (A.D. 1237) shows that the image was then held in great reverence, and makes mention of a Y\u0101dav king who had subdued the country round Pandharpur paying reverence to the god as to a god of great and universal renown. The inscription alludes to the famous story of Pundlik,\u00b9 which serves to show that the fame of the image was even then of long standing.\n\nThe earliest architectural work in the temple is the N\u0101ndev gate which appears from its style sculptures and pillars to be contemporary with the above inscription or perhaps a little earlier. It resembles in its style the Hem\u0101dpanti remains of the Devgiri Y\u0101dav period. Under the Devgiri Y\u0101davs a large and splendid temple may have been built here instead of some old small temple or repairs may have been made to an old temple going to decay. This temple seems to have been broken down by the Musalm\u00e1ns as several of the figures in the old sculptures are wilfully disfigured and from the fragments that remain the work appears too strong to have suffered from the effects of time alone. This period of destruction would appear to be just after the capture of Devgiri by Muhammad Tughl\u012bk (1325-1351). The original form of the gate cannot be made out as much new work has been mixed up with the old. It looks much like the gate of the Adhai Dinka Jhumpda mosque at Ajmer which has been made from a Hindu temple.\n\nAccording to local information the image was removed to various places at different times to save it from Musalm\u00e1n sacrilege. One story which is recorded in a famous abhang of Bh\u0101nud\u00e1s a devotee appears to be historical. It is of the time of the great Vijaynagar king R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja (1542-1565) and says that the king took the image to Vijaynagar and built for it a temple and that from Vijaynagar the god was brought by Bh\u0101nud\u00e1s in a miniature form in a casket to Pandharpur. It is possible that in those troubled times when three such mighty powers as Vijaynagar Bij\u00e1pur and Ahmadnagar were fighting for supremacy, R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja may have taken the image to Vijaynagar, while it is equally probable that after the great Vijaynagar defeat at T\u00e1l\u00edkoti in 1565 the devotee Bh\u0101nud\u00e1s may have brought it back to Pandharpur.\u00b2\n\nThe present temple appears to have been built about the beginning of the seventeenth century probably when, under Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s rose to power in the Deccan. But the image does not appear to have remained undisturbed during the next century of Bij\u00e1pur and Moghal supremacy. One Pralh\u0101d B\u00e1va whose date of death is locally given as the dark twelfth of M\u0101gh Shak 1640 (A.D. 1718) is held in great local veneration as having often\n\n\u00b9 See below p. 433.\n\u00b2 At one time to save it from sacrilege the image is said to have been removed to Bh\u0101lavni village twelve miles west by a B\u0101du named B\u00e1p\u016b Trimbak; once again to N\u0101r\u0101yan-Chincholi village four miles to the north-east; and a third time to Chincholi-B\u0101dvani a village one mile north of Pandharpur.\nsaved the image during his lifetime. The exact dates are not preserved but it is probable that, during the five years (1695-1700) his camp was at Brahmapuri sixteen miles south-east of Pandharpur, Aurangzeb must often have tried to injure and desecrate the temple, when Pralhad Bava may have removed the image. The architectural appearance of the present temple and several inscriptions in it show that it was probably built about 1610 the time of Maratha rise. At this time the temple must have consisted of the Namdev gate, a long courtyard, the chaukhamb, antechamber and shrine. In 1621 the mandap was added in front and under the Peshwas to avoid the trouble and confusion of ascent and descent the solakhamb chamber was made and the courtyard joined with the mandap. Since then additions have been made from time to time in the shape of cloisters and rooms.\n\nAbout 500 yards east of Vithoba's temple in the bed of the Bhima is Pundlik's temple one of the most favourite places of worship in Pandharpur. The temple (63' x 65') is built entirely of masonry on a wide plinth 2' high and has a brick and mortar spire covered with cement. The temple has two parts, an audience hall or sabhamandap and a shrine. The hall is of solid masonry with a one foot high plinth. It is twenty-five feet from north to south, seventeen from east to west, and twelve feet high. The flat heavy roof rests on two stone pillars and four pilasters. The two pillars support an arch and form a doorway leading into the audience hall. There are two other doors one in the north, the other in the south wall of the hall, and two niches in the west wall to the north and south of a door leading from the hall to the shrine. The north niche has a smooth quartz ling in a black case or shalunkha. The south niche is empty. The door (4' x 2') in the west wall leads into the shrine whose floor is nearly seven inches lower than the hall floor. The shrine, which is eight feet square and nine feet high, is of solid and heavy masonry eight-sided and without windows. It is surrounded by a brick and mortar spire in five tiers and sixty feet high. The spire is simple and weather-worn. The topmost tier, which is surmounted by a brass pinnacle, supports a number of smaller globes each tipped by a small brass pinnacle. In the second tier are empty niches with lattice work. The three lower tiers are adorned with designs of creepers and flowers.\n\nIn the inside of the shrine are three niches one with a box for the daily temple receipts and another with the god's clothes and other property; the third is empty. In the shrine is a stone ling set in a case or shalunkha (4' x 2' 3\" x 1') without a pedestal. The shalunkha and ling are covered with a close-fitting brass cover and on the ling is set a hollow bust of the god. The bust of the god wears ear ornaments and a crown, and is surrounded by the coils of a five-headed cobra. On either side of the case or shalunkha three feet high brass figures of the door-keepers Jaya and Vijaya stand on brass pedestals. The two figures stand with one leg across the other the cross-foot resting on its toes. In their hands are a mace and a fly-whisk. The daily worship is by a Koli ministrant in the early morning. It includes the usual baths in the five nectars or panchamrit, milk, curds, clarified butter, honey, and sugar, the rubbing with oil and other fragrant\nsubstances, and the offering of *bel* leaves, flowers, and food. The hollow bust or mask and the brass covers of the *sh\u00e1lunkha* and *ling* are removed, the stone image is worshipped, and the mask is drawn over the stone, flowers are thrown on the mask, and it is wrapped in a silk-bordered waistcloth and a coat. In the evening the ministrant waves burning camphor and lights round the mask, throws fresh flowers over it, and closes the temple. He opens it next morning at four, when his first act is to wave a lighted torch round the mask. In the middle of the day a Br\u00e1hman, who is specially engaged for the purpose, brings a plateful of food cooked in his own house and offers it to the god. The only festival in connection with the temple is one held for five days on the *Mah\u00e1sh\u00edvr\u00e1tra* or Great Night of Shiv from the tenth to the fifteenth of the dark half of *M\u00e1gh* or February-March. During these days, in addition to the daily worship, the Koli community feed numbers of beggars, blind, deaf, crippled, and otherwise helpless people but no Br\u00e1hmans. The yearly revenue from this temple amounts to upwards of \u00a340 (Rs. 400) which is taken by the Koli ministrants. This is not a temple of a god. It marks the spot where Pundlik, a great devotee of Vithoba, spent the end of his life and died. Of his tomb no trace remains. Pundlik is said to have been a Pandharpur Br\u00e1hman, an undutiful son who ill treated aged parents. At the urgent request of his parents, he once undertook a pilgrimage to Benares carrying his old parents with him. On the way he halted at a village where lived Rohid\u00e1s a dutiful, upright, and religious cobbler. Pundlik went to the cobbler\u2019s to have his shoes mended, and waited outside while Rohid\u00e1s was attending his parents. While he was waiting Pundlik saw two young and very fair women sweeping the cobbler\u2019s house. After some time Rohid\u00e1s came out, mended Pundlik\u2019s shoes, and as he was a pilgrim charged him nothing only asking him as a favour to offer a copper in his name to the Ganges. Pundlik promised and as he dropped the copper into the Ganges a beautiful hand rose from the water. He laid the copper in the hand, and, in proof, took a gold bracelet from the hand to show to Rohid\u00e1s. On his way Pundlik visited Rohid\u00e1s and said he had offered the copper. Rohid\u00e1s called on Ganga and the same hand came. It had no bracelet and Pundlik handed the bracelet to Rohid\u00e1s to be restored. Next morning Pundlik again saw the two lovely women sweeping the cobbler\u2019s house. He asked them who they were and they looked at him in scorn. He asked again and they told him they were the river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna serving the dutiful Rohid\u00e1s. Pundlik remembered his own rudeness with shame. He was a changed man and grew so holy that Vithoba used to come to see him. One day just as the god came Pundlik\u2019s old parents called to him. He was in a strait between his duty to the god and his duty to his parents. He decided his parents had the first claim and asked the god to wait and gave him a brick to stand on. This, they say, is why in the great temple Vithoba is shown standing on a brick. In time Pundlik\u2019s parents J\u00e1nudev and Mukt\u00e1b\u00e1i died. They were buried in the bed of the river and two monuments which still exist were built over them. The monuments are in the Hem\u00e1dpanti style of heavy masonry with square slightly domed roofs. In each temple a *ling* in\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nPandharpur.\n\nTemples.\n\nPundlik.\n\na sh\u00e1lunkha set in the floor, shows the spot of burial. In like manner when Pundlik died and was buried, a ling was set in the tomb, which is said to be the same ling that is now worshipped. When the Bhima is flooded, the brass mask of the ling and all other movables are taken from the temple and set on the river bank, but the mask is worshipped as usual. Pundlik\u2019s temple is one of the chief shrines included in the pilgrims\u2019 holy round or pradakshina. His great devotion to Vithoba and Vithoba\u2019s regard for him have led to the coupling of the two names in the words Pundlik Var De Hari Viththal, that is Pundlik grant us a boon, Hari Viththal. These words are always shouted by pilgrims before dinner and on other occasions. The temple has no room for Bair\u00e1gis or other beggars. During the five great days in February-March and occasionally at other times the Kolis sing devotional songs or bhajans at night. No discourses or Pur\u00e1n readings are ever held. To the east of the temple is a small masonry pond (10' \u00d7 10' \u00d7 4') called Lohdand Tirth with stone steps all round. The pond has a niche on each of its four sides with images of Vithoba and Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed in one, and of Ganpati, Garud, and M\u00e1ru\u1e6d\u00ed in the other three. The pond is said to mark the spot where the sin-struck Pundlik took up his abode to spend his days in devotion and in the service of his parents, and where in answer to Pundlik\u2019s prayers Vithoba came and settled. So holy is the water of the pool that even stone boats are said to float in it. Pundlik\u2019s temple has been repaired and rebuilt about four times. The original temple is said to have been built by Ch\u00e1ngdev a contemporary of the great Dakshani Br\u00e1hman poet Dny\u00e1neshvar who lived early in the fourteenth century. It fell and is said to have been rebuilt in the Hem\u00e1dpanti style. About 1550 it was again built by one H\u00e1lekar and was restored in its present form about 1850 by Nandr\u00e1m Poona mason. The hall or sabb\u00e1mandap was added in 1878 by Shridhar Krishna Bh\u00e1te a Pandharpur banker.\n\nVishnupad.\n\nIn the river bed about three quarters of a mile to the south of Pundlik\u2019s temple, reached by a low causeway of rough stones, is the temple of Vishnupad, notable for the shr\u00e1ddh or funeral ceremonies performed by pilgrims. The temple is on a rock in the river bed and has a seven feet plinth open on all sides and on all sides faced by flights of steps. It is an open hall or mandap, thirty-one feet square and twelve feet high, built of solid masonry with a flat roof resting on sixteen stone pillars. The level of the river bed near the temple is so low that when Pundlik\u2019s temple is surrounded by water the Vishnupad temple is half under water and for almost three months in the year it is entirely under water. The floor of the temple is paved with stone and the sixteen pillars support twenty-four arches, on which rests the roof. In the middle of the temple a space five feet square is fenced off by a masonry ridge eight inches high. In this central square, which is the shrine of the temple, are three rocks, with the footprints of the god Krishna and of a cow. The god\u2019s footprints are in two positions. In one pair he is standing on both feet, each six inches long. The footmarks are hollows as if the rock had yielded like half-dry mud. In the other pair of footprints the god stands on his left foot, with the right foot crossed and resting on the toes. In front of these marks is a cup-shaped hollow in the rock, which is said to be the cup out of which\nthe god ate. At each corner of the square is a cow\u2019s footprint. A small hollow in front of the second pair of footprints was caused by the point of the god\u2019s staff. Except two pillars to the west of the square on which images are carved in relief, the pillars are plain. Of the two carved pillars that in the north-west corner has an image of Krishna standing with the right leg crossed and playing on a flute. The south-west pillar has a standing Vishnu with four arms holding the conch, the discus, the mace, and the lotus. The sacred square with the footprints is considered as the shrine, and the footprints as the god Krishna. The footprints are worshipped every forenoon by an agent of the B\u0101dv\u0101s, the Br\u0101hman ministrants of the chief temple of Vithoba. Pilgrims perform funeral ceremonies or shr\u0101ddhas in honour of their ancestors on this spot. The balls or pindas, that stand for the ancestors, are set in the holy square especially on the footprints, and are there worshipped. The pilgrim pays the B\u0101dva 6d. (4 as.) for the use of the footprints. After the ceremony the balls are thrown into the river and the rock is washed and worshipped by the pilgrims. In M\u0101rgshirsh or November-December large numbers attend this temple many families coming to eat here, those who can afford it cooking their food here, and the rest bringing cooked food. Some of them feed Br\u0101hmans and most bring their relations and friends, feast, and spend the day at the temple. On the first day of M\u0101rgshirsh Vithoba\u2019s sandals are taken to the temple of Vishnupad, and on the last day of the month, with much pomp and music, the B\u0101dv\u0101s carry Vithoba\u2019s car to this temple. In the evening the sandals are brought back from Vishnupad with a grand torch-light procession and are lodged in the bedchamber of the god Vithoba. During this month Vithoba goes to Vishnupad and like Krishna feasts there with other cowherds. The Vishnupad rocks and the surrounding rocks in the river bed which bear footprints are supposed to be the spot where Krishna and his companions held a festive party in honour of the peace-making between Krishna and his queen Rukmini. The three blocks of rock now in the sacred square were formerly to the east of the Vishnupad temple where stands a temple of M\u0101ruti. The rocks were originally open to the sky. They were set in masonry in the centre of a square masonry platform or ota by one Dh\u0101mangaonkar a saint about 1640. About 1785, Chinto N\u0101gesh a B\u0101dva removed them and built the whole structure as it now stands. The yearly income of this temple which is about \u00a315 (Rs. 150) goes to the B\u0101dv\u0101s. Many rocks round this temple have cow footprints. To the east of the temple a niche shrine built on the rock contains a rough red two-feet high stone image of M\u0101ruti which is worshipped along with the footprints of Vishnu. The M\u0101ruti is said to be as old as the footprints of Vishnu which were originally on the same spot as M\u0101ruti.\n\nTrimbakeshvar\u2019s temple is in a close-peopled part of the town about 200 paces north of the temple of Vithoba at the corner of a lane which leads to Rokdoba\u2019s gate. It is surrounded by private buildings, in one of which is a Sanskrit school maintained by the Pandharpur municipality. A few paces north of the temple is a pool of dirty water called the kundaltirth or earring pool. The temple is in two parts a hall and a shrine. The hall or sabh\u0101mandap (17\u2019 x 11\u2019) is of masonry and has a flat stone roof resting on four stone pillars.\nand eight pilasters. The temple committee have added a wooden hall or sabh\u0101mandap to the east of the masonry hall and a door in the north wall of this new wooden hall now leads to the temple.\\(^1\\) In the west wall of the masonry hall a small door (3' \u00d7 1' 9\") opens on the shrine a paved room six feet square and nearly eight high with a latticed opening in the north wall for light.\n\nIn the middle of the shrine is a rough black stone ling five inches high in a sh\u0101lunkha (2' 4\" \u00d7 1' 7\" \u00d7 6\"). In the masonry hall opposite the door which opens into the shrine is a sitting figure of the bull Nandi 2' high and 1' 6\" long set on a stone pedestal four inches high. The roof of the shrine has no spire.\n\nThe god is worshipped twice a day. The ordinary morning worship includes the five nectar baths and is performed by an agent of the temple committee. In the evening the god is simply washed with water, the morning flowers are removed, and the case is covered with red broadcloth. Over the ling is set a brass mask with a human face, a crown on the head, and surrounded by one or two coils of a great cobra whose hood is spread shading the god. The priest applies sandal paste to the forehead of the god, ties flower garlands round his neck, and waves a light to the accompaniment of songs. A light is kept burning all night. The temple great day is Mah\u0101-shiv\u0101r\u0101tra in February-March which is celebrated in much the same manner as in the Amriteshvar and Mallik\u0101rjun Mah\u0101devs\u2019 temples.\\(^2\\) At night the bust of the god is carried through the town with torch-lights.\n\nThe temple of Trimbakeshvar is believed to be more than 500 years old. The spot where the temple stands is said to be the scene of a fight between Vishnu and a demon. The demon defeated Vishnu, cutting off his arms, and Vishnu only escaped through the help of Mah\u0101dev who smote the demon with his ear ornament or kundal. The pond near which this victory was gained came to be called Kundaltirth and Mah\u0101dev\u2019s presence was commemorated by building the temple. Inside the temple is a small chamber (6' \u00d7 6' \u00d7 8' 6\") in which the sandals of Narsinh the fourth form of Vishnu are kept on a stone pedestal 1' 6\" high. To the east of the shrine is a masonry hall with in its right hand corner a rough stone image of Khandoba riding a horse, with his wife Mhalsa behind him and a dog by his side. The image is worshipped along with Narsinh\u2019s sandals and Trimbakeshvar\u2019s ling inside.\n\nAbout 420 feet south of Datta\u2019s landing is Panchmukhi M\u0101ruti\u2019s temple, a small brick and mortar room (5' \u00d7 4'). The temple is on a plinth two feet high and 7' 6\" square. The top of the temple is domed, but has no pinnacle. It faces west and is entered by one door (5' 6\" \u00d7 3') in the west wall. The image (6' 9\" \u00d7 4') which fills almost the entire breadth of the small room is cut in relief on a large slab and shows the tailed monkey-god with five heads standing with one foot on the prostrate body of the giant Jambu M\u0101li the chief gardener of R\u0101van. The monkey has two hands, the left hand resting on the waist and the right hand held up. He is thickly covered with redlead. The middle face is larger than the other four and has\n\n\\(^1\\) The new wooden hall has an upper storey in which one of the Sanskrit school classes is held.\n\n\\(^2\\) See below p. 440.\ncopper moulds for eyes. To the right of the image is a wooden dumb-bell the weapon of the god also besmeared with redlead. The proprietors and priests of the god are Bair\u00e1gis who live in the temple yard and charge each pilgrim \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{d.} \\) (\u00bc a.) for opening the temple and showing the god. They perhaps make \u00a31 to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 10-12) a year.\n\nThe chief daily worship is in the morning, and in the evening is a light-waving with songs. Both are done by the Bair\u00e1gis. The only holiday is on the full-moon of Chaitra or March-April when the image is rubbed with redlead and oil, and after the usual worship the Bair\u00e1gis sing songs to the tambourine. A feast is given next day to all the Bair\u00e1gis of the town.\n\nIn a private enclosure on the river bank close to the Chandrabh\u00e1ga landing is a temple of Ganpati in two parts, a hall and a shrine. Both are of brick plastered with mud and both have a flat mud roof. The hall is twenty-one feet long by nineteen feet wide, its roof resting on twelve wooden posts and twelve pilasters. In a niche in the west wall of the shrine is a white marble Ganpati facing east and one foot high. The god is represented squat with four arms, the lower two resting on his crossed thighs. The image is a family god, and is worshipped by the owners along with their other house gods. There is the usual morning service and a light-waving in the evening. The only great day is the fourth of the bright half of Bh\u00e1drapad or August-September when a special worship is performed with the five nectar baths. There is no regular reciting or reading, but often during the four rainy months wandering Pur\u00e1n readers are allowed to read the Pur\u00e1ns. This temple was built during the reign of the last Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v (1796-1817).\n\nNear the south end of the town about 250 paces south of Panchmukhi M\u00e1ruti is the temple of Belicha Mah\u00e1dev. The temple is in an enclosure the front of which, now in bad repair, forms a rest house occupied by Bair\u00e1gis and Gos\u00e1vis. The temple, which is built entirely of masonry, faces east and includes a hall and a shrine. The hall is about 23' \u00d7 10' \u00d7 12' and has a flat roof resting on two stone pillars and six pilasters. The floor is paved with bricks and in the middle is a squat stone Nandi 1' 6\" high. To the east of the Nandi is a round slab or rangshila, and between the Nandi and the door of the shrine chamber is a stone tortoise buried almost level with the pavement. A door (4' \u00d7 2') leads to the shrine. To the north of the door a stone represents the Sun riding in a chariot drawn by a seven-headed horse and to the south of the door is a rough stone Ganpati thickly coated with redlead. The shrine (9' \u00d7 9' \u00d7 9') has a flat roof and a cement floor about eight inches lower than the hall. In the shrine are nine niches the middle niche with a small image of Ganpati. In the middle of the shrine are two cases or sh\u00e1lunkh\u00e1s and a ling. The outer case is 4' 6\" long by 3' wide and 8\" high; in the inner case which is smaller and of copper is set a smooth white quartz ling four inches high. The worship is performed once in the forenoon by a Br\u00e1hman who is paid by the owners of the temple. The only great day is Shivr\u00e1tra in February-March when bathing or abh\u00edsh\u00e9k water is poured and one or two Br\u00e1hmans are fed. The temple was built about 1787 by a Mar\u00e1tha noble Jan\u00e1ji B\u00e1ji Gh\u00e1tge who is said to be buried in a tomb or sam\u00e1dh near the south wall of the temple yard.\nAbout 150 feet east of Vithoba's temple in the midst of an enclosure surrounded by private buildings and almost hidden from view is K\u00e1lbhairav's temple entered by a doorway (5' \u00d7 2'6\") in the south of the enclosure which opens into the thoroughfare known as Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r. The temple is built of stone and mortar and has a brick and mortar spire. It is in two parts, an antechamber and a shrine. The antechamber is a square room (8' \u00d7 8' \u00d7 10') built of stone with a paved floor and a masonry roof, resting on four pilasters one in each corner. Two verandas or ot\u00e1s of brick and mortar stretch lengthwise on either end of the shrine leaving in the north wall a middle passage as wide as the door (4'9\" \u00d7 1'9\") which leads to the shrine. The shrine (8' \u00d7 8' \u00d7 10'6\") is built of stone and mortar and has a masonry roof slightly domed and resting on four pilasters, one in each corner of the shrine. The spire is eleven feet high and in the same style as the spire of Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i's temple. Close to the north wall are two stone pedestals one above the other; the lower of dressed stone (3'3\" \u00d7 2' \u00d7 3') and the upper a slab (2' \u00d7 2' \u00d7 6\"). On the pedestals are standing images of K\u00e1lbhairav and his wife Jogeshvari. The image of K\u00e1lbhairav is two feet high of blackstone with two arms, the right holding a trident and the left holding a tabor or damru. The carving of the image shows the tracings of a waistcloth, a crown, earrings, and garlands round the neck. Near its feet on either side of the image and cut out of the same block is a standing male figure with folded hands. These are supposed to be two of the quarter regents or dikp\u00e1ls, the servants of K\u00e1lbhairav. To the left of K\u00e1lbhairav is the black stone image of Jogeshvari one foot high with her arms hanging by her sides. To the right of the god on an earthen platform is a ling six inches high in a sh\u00e1lunkha (3'6\" \u00d7 2' \u00d7 3\").\n\nThe worship of the god is performed once every day in the forenoon by an agent of the Badv\u00e1s who farm the temple revenues every year for \u00a31 (Rs. 10). The worship is of the ordinary kind, the god being served with sandal paste and rice, the goddess with coloured powders, and both with sugar-candy or groundnuts. The only great day is the Bhairav Ashtami the eighth of the bright half of Chaitra or March-April. On this day Br\u00e1hmans are fed in honour of the god from a small subscription raised by the neighbours. Outside the antechamber is a horizontal stone slab 2'6\" long and 1'6\" high. It is engraved with the nine planets or navagrahas and is worshipped along with K\u00e1lbhairav. About 300 years ago the site of this temple is said to have been a sacred pool called Bhairavtirth, whose sides were lined with masonry steps. On the banks were four temples of K\u00e1lbhairav, Mah\u00e1dev, Ganpati, and B\u00e1nshankari otherwise called Sh\u00e1kambhari. On the south side of the pond were corridors for pilgrims and a corridor still forms the southern boundary of the enclosure in which the door leading to the present K\u00e1lbhairav temple is set. Under the Bij\u00e1pur Adil Sh\u00e1his (1489-1687) the stones which formed the boundary of the pond were used in building the fort of Paranda in the Niz\u00e1m's territories forty-five miles north of Pandhar-\n\n---\n\n1 See below p. 442.\n2 The corridors have now been turned into shops occupied by bankers and money-lenders, book, brass, and copper vessel sellers, and oilmen. They are highly prized from their nearness to Vithoba's temple.\nThe temples probably shared the same fate. The whole area of the pond was sold by auction, filled in, and the present temple of K\u00e1lbhairav was built about 1730 by a Br\u00e1hman surnamed Konkane. So badly do the stones fit that they are probably stones left from the old Bhairav pool. In this temple is the image of Mah\u00e1dev which in former days had a temple of its own. Of the four original temples only that of Sh\u00e1kambhari remains. The Mah\u00e1dev is in K\u00e1lbhairav\u2019s temple and the Ganpati is in a private building.\n\nOutside the K\u00e1lbhairav enclosure in the south wall of a private building in the old Bhairavtirth is a niche five feet high four feet wide and 2\u2019 6\u201d deep with an image of Ganpati. The niche is open and faces south. Ganpati\u2019s original temple was destroyed by the Musalm\u00e1ns. Close to this niche, about ten paces across the way, is Vithoba\u2019s temple. To the south a stone marks the grave of Chokh\u00e1mela the celebrated Mh\u00e1r devotee of Vithoba. Ganpati is a rough stone image thickly covered with redlead three feet high and represents the god cross-legged with four arms, the lower pair resting on his thighs the right upper arm bearing an elephant\u2019s goad and the left upper arm carrying a hatchet. To the right of the image a rough block of stone one foot high, 1\u2019 6\u201d broad, and 5\u201d thick, also covered with redlead, represents Ganpati\u2019s wife Sarasvati. To the right of and below the plinth of the Ganpati niche are one or two stones with carvings of gods and other figures. Every forenoon worship is performed by an agent of the Badv\u00e1s. On Ganesh Chaturthi or the fourth of the bright half of Bh\u00e1drapad or August-September the Badv\u00e1s rub the image with redlead mixed with oil. The yearly income is estimated at 6s. (Rs. 3).\n\nWithin a private enclosure, approached by a private passage to the east of the K\u00e1lbhairav temple is Sh\u00e1kambhari\u2019s shrine an old ruined temple said to be one of the Bhairav pool temples. It is a square room seven feet either way and nine feet high with a door in the east wall four feet high and two feet wide. Placed side by side against the west wall and plastered together with cement are two stone pedestals together about five feet long, two feet high, and about two feet wide. On these pedestals are set two images of which the one to the visitor\u2019s right is the original image of the herb-nourishing goddess Sh\u00e1kambhari 2\u20196\u201d high sitting cross-legged with four arms, the right pair holding a tabor or damru and a sword, and the left upper hand holding a trident, and the left lower hand resting on her thigh. The image which is rough and old shows tracings of a robe a crown and some neck ornaments. The other image to the right is exactly alike but six inches smaller. It was set up about 1775 by one Angal when he repaired the temple at a cost of \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000). The temple spire which is twenty-three feet high is in three tiers the lowest tier of stone and the upper two of brick and mortar. At the four corners of the lowest tier are small towers with image niches. The upper tiers are star-shaped and old-looking and have no niches or images. On the uppermost tier is a globe surmounted by a second smaller globe and over the globe a wooden pinnacle.\n\nEvery forenoon an agent of the Badv\u00e1s worships the goddess. The two great weeks are the Navr\u00e1tra and the Mah\u00e1navr\u00e1tra being\n\n---\n\n1 See above p.438.\nthe first nine days of the bright halves of Chaitra or March-April and of A\u015bvin or September-October when lights are burnt before the images and garlands are hung in front of them. On the Chaitra or March-April full-moon people who have this goddess for their family deity prepare a dinner in her honour and bring her a plateful with no less than sixty kinds of cooked vegetables, as Sh\u00e1kambhari is the vegetable-nourishing goddess.\n\nAbout 600 feet east of Vithoba\u2019s temple is Mallik\u0101rjun\u2019s temple more important and more largely visited than any other Pandharpur temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1dev. Its popularity is due partly to its age and partly to the neighbourhood of Vithoba\u2019s temple. The temple is in two parts a hall and a shrine. The hall (29' \u00d7 22') is of solid masonry entered by two doors, a main entrance (7' \u00d7 3'9\") in the south wall and a side entrance (4'9\" \u00d7 2'4\") in the east wall. Outside the side door is a masonry lamp-pillar twenty-two feet high. The hall has a flat roof of heavy stone slabs resting on thirty stone pillars. In the west wall are three doors one at either end leading to the back of the temple and used for the circuit round the god and the third (5' \u00d7 2'6\") in the middle leading to the shrine. To the west of the hall are two chambers with no opening supposed to be partly built in. In the east wall of the left hand side chamber is a niche with a rough stone four-armed figure of Ganpati smeared with redlead. To the right is an open chamber (4'9\" \u00d7 4'9\") with a ling (2'9\" \u00d7 1'8\" \u00d7 10\") of Someshvar Mah\u00e1dev. The chamber has two latticed doors (5'3\" \u00d7 2'3\") one in the south and the other in the east wall. Behind the ling in the west wall is a niche with a stone image of the goddess Bhav\u00e1ni, partly broken and disfigured. Two niches in the north wall of the hall contain rough stone images of Ganpati and Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan. In the Lekshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan niche is a slab with the figures of five cobras. This slab and the image of Ganpati are rubbed with redlead. To the east of the Someshvar chamber is a stone figure of a seated Nandi. Besides these several niches in the east and north walls of the hall are closed with shutters. They are used for keeping the furniture of the temple. Facing the door which leads to the shrine is a seated brass Nandi on a stone pedestal (3' \u00d7 2' \u00d7 11\"). In the centre of the stone floor of the hall is the usual circular slab called rangshila where visitors sit and sing verses. Two steps lead from the hall to the shrine a small room nine feet square and eleven feet high with a stone-paved floor. In the back or west wall of the shrine is a small latticed window, and just below the window is a niche containing a tiger-riding marble image of Amb\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed one foot high with four arms the upper pair holding a sword and the top-lock of a giant, the lower pair holding a tabor and the tail of a tiger. Several niches in the walls hold lamps and the cast-off offerings of the god and in the south wall is a masonry water cistern. In the centre of the room is the ling of Mallik\u0101rjun 2' 4\" high set in a sh\u00e1lunkha 12' 6\" round. The whole is of black stone smooth and well polished. Over the shrine is a fair brick and mortar spire in three tiers about forty-two feet high. The lowest tier has niches with figures representing the ten forms of Vishnu; the middle tier has niches with images of Mah\u00e1dev Ganpati and other gods; the figures in the\ntopmost tier cannot be clearly made out, but they are probably of saints. The pinnacle is of brass mounted on two globes one above the other. The regular service of the god takes place twice a day. The worshipping is an unlettered Jangam or Lingayat priest who is not paid for his services. In the morning the Jangam comes about eight or nine and removes the covering of the god and the last day's flowers. Before the Jangam comes the image is free for private worship and many Brahmins and others thus worship the god especially during the four rainy months (June-September) and on Monday the favourite day of Shiv. The Jangam's worship consists of washing the ling, wiping it dry, applying sandal-paste, throwing flowers and Agle marmelos or bel leaves, waving a light or lighted camphor and frankincense, and offering food. Both before and after the Jangam's worship people come to worship the god and make their offerings of food. The offerings are taken by the Koli in attendance. The evening service takes place at seven and consists of removing the flowers, washing the ling, and repeating the other parts of the morning service except that more flowers are thrown over the god, more lamps are lighted and kept burning throughout the night, and the ling is dressed in a red broadcloth cover; the food offering is richer consisting of milk sugar and raisins, and not of cooked food. The waving of a light or arti is accompanied by more songs than in the morning and more drum-beating and bell-ringing. After the cover is put on the god no more worship is allowed for the night.\n\nThe holidays of this temple are: Shivratra in February-March, Dashahar in June-July, the month of Chaitra or March-April, and the month from Ashvin full-moon to Kartik full-moon that is October-November. The Shivratra holidays, which are the most important, last for nearly a week from the twelfth of the dark half of Magh or February-March to the fifth of the bright half of Phalgun or February-March. All these days there is a continual water-pouring or abhishek over the ling while Brahmins recite hymns. Purans are read by day and kathas are held at night. The temple is well lighted and on the fifth day of Phalgun the last day of the festival the sandals of the god are carried in a palanquin in a torch-light procession with much pomp and music. For five days after the Shivratra numbers of Brahmins are fed; and every evening Brahmins are asked to recite Vedic hymns for two or three hours. The Dashahar festival lasts over the first ten days of Jyesht or June-July. During these days the worship consists of the usual daily water-pourings or abhisheks and Brahman feedings. During the whole month of Chaitra or March-April, during the evening service, the ling is thickly coated with sandal-paste, put on in such a way as to form the outlines of a human face. No cloth is put on during this month. The sandal-paste is said to be intended to cool the god as Chaitra is a hot month. During the month lasting from the full-moon of Ashvin or September-October to the full-moon of Kartik or October-November there is nothing special in the services of the god, but every night the temple inside and out is lighted in honour of the Divali holidays. The gains of the temple go to Kolis who farm them every month. The yearly income, including the food which is offered to the god, amounts to about \u00a310 (Rs. 100). Besides\nthis the temple enjoys a permanent income of \u00a315 (Rs. 150) being the rent of about six shops to the south of the temple. No Bair\u00e1gis or mendicants stop in the temple; but the Kol\u00eds who take the contract stay throughout the year on the temple premises. Pur\u00e1n readings are held throughout the year. The Bh\u00e1gvat Pur\u00e1n is read in the monsoon forenoons, and the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan for eight months on the fair weather afternoons. Sometimes during the fair season the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t is also read in the evenings in front of the temple but none of these Pur\u00e1niks are paid by the temple. They are paid and often handsomely by their audience of whom widows form a large part. The temple was originally limited to the shrine and is supposed to be very old. It is said to have been repaired and improved by one Narhar a Ling\u00e1yat goldsmith and a devotee of Mah\u00e1dev. Additions were made about 1820 and the spire was built in 1854.\n\nAmb\u00e1b\u00e1i.\n\nIn the north of the town, on the right bank of the Bh\u00edma, about 300 yards east of Vy\u00e1s\u2019s temple lies Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i\u2019s temple an isolated building shaded by n\u00edm, pip\u00e1l, n\u00e1ndr\u00fak, and b\u00e1bhul trees. The temple faces east and is divided into an antechamber and a shrine. In front of the temple is a hollow altar or kund of brick and mortar five feet square and 6\u00bd feet deep. The altar is only used once a year on the eighth of the bright half of Ashvin or September-October on which night a large sacrificial fire is lighted, and flesh is offered to it. On either side and to the east of this altar is a lamp-pillar of brick and mortar ten feet high with small projecting steps all round to enable the lighter to go to the top where an iron pan containing cotton seed dipped in oil is lighted on great days. To the east of the lamp-pillar a flat roofed brick and mortar shed opens to the west. The shed (13\u2019 \u00d7 10\u2019 6\u201d \u00d7 7\u2019) has a three-feet plinth and forms the base of an unfinished drum-house or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. The antechamber (10\u2019 \u00d7 11\u2019 6\u201d \u00d7 7\u2019) is of brick and mortar and has a flat roof coated with cement. It has no windows and opens to the east, and in the west wall has a door (4\u2019 \u00d7 2\u2019) leading to the shrine which is on a 3\u2019 6\u201d higher level. The shrine is seven feet square with a slightly domed solid masonry roof seven feet high and surrounded by a star-shaped spire of brick and mortar ten feet high. Over the spire are two globes one above the other, the upper globe smaller and surmounted by a wooden pinnacle. The shrine has no windows, but niches in the north and south walls on a level with its earthen floor. In a third and larger niche (3\u2019 6\u201d \u00d7 2\u2019 3\u201d \u00d7 1\u2019 7\u201d), on a level with which is a pedestal of dressed stone 2\u00be feet long 1\u00bd feet wide and 1\u00bd feet high and partly projecting out of it, is a polished black stone image of a standing Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i 2\u2019 8\u201d high. The image has eight arms, the right arms holding in order from top to bottom a long sword, an arrow, the tail of a buffalo and a spear, the left arms holding in the same order a shield, a tabor, a bow, and the toplock of the giant Mahish\u00e1sur. The giant and the buffalo are shown at the feet of the goddess, the giant being dragged by the topknot out of the severed neck of the buffalo which lies prostrate, his head on one side. The tracery on the image shows a crown on the head, earrings, a few garlands round the neck, and a robe worn round the waist. In front of the goddess are a pair of stone sandals. The ordinary service of the goddess is performed once in the forenoon by\nan agent of the B\u0101dv\u0101s. The worship consists of unclothing the image, washing it, wiping it, applying redpowder to its forehead, sprinkling turmeric powder, strewing flowers, and throwing a garland of flowers round its neck, waving a light, and offering as food some ground-nuts or sugar or molasses, and wrapping a robe round the image. On Tuesdays Fridays and full-moon days in addition to the morning service the yearly lessee of the temple proceeds comes at noon, dresses the image in a holiday robe, decks it with a paper crown coated with tinsel, and puts round its neck one or two strings of glass beads and a string of cowrie shells. On the afternoons of these days low class women of easy virtue called \u0100r\u0101dhinis who have devoted themselves to the goddess, visit the temple, and offer a betelnut or a copper to the image. The chief holidays are the Navr\u0101tra or the first nine days of \u0100\u015bvina or September-October. On the first of these nine days the Br\u0101hmans perform a special service. The clothes are removed, the image is rubbed with scented oil and a mixture of the five nectars milk, curds, clarified butter, sugar, and honey, and washed copiously with water. Then after the usual offerings of turmeric and redpowder, and wearing of flower garlands, strings or cowries, glass beads, and a paper crown, the image is wrapped in a holiday robe, lights are waved with songs and cooked rice and wheat bread are offered. After this day the regular service is stopped and no washing takes place. The face only of the image is wiped with a wet rag, fresh turmeric and redpowders are applied, and the old flowers are replaced by fresh flowers. Cooked food is offered and the usual light-waving takes place. No portion of the clothes or dress is disturbed for the next eight days. Two oil lamps are kept burning day and night. On the first day, on the floor in front and to the left of the image, a small earthen bed or plot is raised and a quantity of garden wheat is sown in it. In the middle of the bed is set an earthen pot filled with water, its mouth is blocked by betel leaves arranged in a cone, and over the cone is set a half-dry cocoa-kernel. On the kernel is placed a small brass plate, and over the plate a betelnut which is worshipped as the goddess with offerings of turmeric and redpowder. Over the wheat-plot a square bamboo frame or mandap is hung from the ceiling, and, from the sides of this frame, garlands of flowers fall to the wheat-bed, one garland being added every day. All this is done by the worshipping priest, the materials except the food being supplied by the lessee. After the first day the betelnut is worshipped only by offerings of powders and of flowers and food, but it is not moved. During the nine days many visitors go to the temple to have a sight or darshan of the goddess. Some tie a string of small fried wheat-flour cakes to the bamboo frame in fulfilment of vows, and some make any or all of the following offerings, oil, salt crystals, flour, rice, and turmeric and redpowder. For each of these offerings a separate dish is placed in the antechamber, and each visitor adds his share to them. In the afternoon the \u0100r\u0101dhi devotees come by dozens and each waves round the goddess her lighted torch or pot which is said to be a special feature of the devotees of the goddess and which is worshipped and respected as much as the goddess herself. While waving the torch they sing songs and return home singing songs in honour of the goddess all the way.\nBr\u0101hmans, whose family deity is Amb\u0101b\u0101i, visit the temple for darshan during these nine days. On the eighth day at about midnight all the people whose family deity is Amb\u0101b\u0101i repair to the temple in thousands. One of the Badv\u0101s worships the goddess, offering turmeric and redpowder and waves a light accompanied by songs. He comes out to the hollow altar or kund. Into this an hour or so before midnight a large quantity of fuel is thrown and a fire is lit. This is consecrated as the sacrificial fire, which, after his return from the temple, the Badva worships by offering turmeric and redpowder and then standing with his face towards the temple again waves a light and all the visitors sing songs in honour of the goddess. After this the Badva throws into the fire either a cocoanut or a pumpkin, and after that the lessee brings a tender kid or young goat worshipped beforehand at home, and throws it alive into the blazing fire. Others who have vows to discharge follow and throw their kids.\n\nAll this while the \u0100r\u0101dhnis with their lighted torches stand round the fire and sing songs in honour of the goddess. On the tenth day the goddess is worshipped as on the first day, anointed, and washed, and the flower garlands hanging from the bamboo frame are thrown on the frame. Next day which is Dasra or the limit-crossing and weapon-worshipping day, the earthen pot is lifted, and in the evening the \u0100r\u0101dhnis with lighted torches, and with them it is believed the goddess, go out of the town to cross the boundary. On their return they go to the temple and wave their torches singing songs. From the eleventh to the full-moon day the goddess is not worshipped or disturbed as she is supposed to be sleeping and resting after her nine days of turmoil. On the full-moon day the ordinary worship of the goddess is resumed. In the evening a bower is raised in front of the goddess, and in this bower are entwined betel-leaves folded like quills. Lamps are lighted all round the temple; and the usual worship takes place in the evening instead of in the morning. For food boiled sweetened milk is offered; and lighted lamps are waved with songs. At night people assemble and spend the night as a wake playing and singing devotional songs or bhajans.\n\nThe temple is said to have been originally built by one Sidu Koli whose date is not known. But as the proceeds of the temple were tempting, the Badv\u0101s took it from the hands of the Kolis, set up the pair of sandals and claimed the temple revenues. Since then about 1854 the temple has been rebuilt by a dancing girl named Limba at a cost of \u00a3160 (Rs. 1600). The temple proceeds are farmed every year for \u00a35 to \u00a37 10s. (Rs. 50 - 75) the estimated yearly income being about \u00a310 (Rs. 100).\n\nR\u0101mchandra's temple lies close to Holkar's mansion on the river bank to the north of the Mah\u0101dv\u0101r landing. It is strongly built of dressed stone and mortar and raised on a plinth six feet high. The temple is held in great veneration both on account of its position and of its builder the famous Ahaly\u0101b\u0101i Holkar (1735-1795). The temple consists of two halls or sabh\u0101mandaps and a shrine. The first or east sabh\u0101mandap is a large hall (60' \u00d7 28') the roof resting on eighteen wooden posts arranged in a double row; the ceiling is boarded and has a flat roof plastered with mortar. The hall is well lighted by eleven windows and four latticed windows. At the east end of the hall is a small temple (6' \u00d7 4') of solid\nmasonry with a blackstone M\u00e1runi 2' 6\" high standing with folded arms and facing the image of R\u00e1m in the shrine. This small temple has whitewashed walls and a stone-paved floor. To the north of M\u00e1runi's temple is a ling on a small platform of dressed stones 2' high, and facing the ling is a stone Nandi. In the back or east wall of M\u00e1runi's temple on the outside is a niche with a foot high image of Ganpati covered with redlead. At the south-east corner of the hall is a small store room. A broad open passage with, at its north and south ends, the two chief gateways leading to the river bed and to the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing road leads by a doorway in the west to a low passage (7' \u00d7 6'). This low passage opens into a small square court (6' \u00d7 6') and the court leads into the second hall or sabh\u00e1mandap usually called the stone hall to distinguish it from the first which is called the wooden hall. Above the low passage is a loft and on the north and south sides of the open square court are low-roofed rooms with lofts. These three lofts have the same roofs and open into one another. They are intended to be used as drum-rooms or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00e1s for the temple musicians. The square court is open to the sky and serves as a shaft to let light and air into the hall. The stone sabh\u00e1mandap is a hall (40' \u00d7 18') entirely built of dressed stone and mortar with an arched stone roof plastered with mortar. The roof is pierced by four openings to admit light. The hall has a latticed window in the south wall and a door in the north wall opening into Holkar's mansion. In the middle of the hall a bell hangs by a strong chain from a cross beam. In the south wall a niche contains a rough standing black stone image of Datt\u00e1traya with six hands and about a foot high. At the west end of the stone hall four steps lead four feet up to the shrine a room sixteen feet square with in front a big arch and latticed doors or shutters. Each door consists of two pieces hinged together, so that, except on special occasions, only a small doorway is kept open, and this small doorway again is guarded by a six feet long brass plated wooden bar fixed horizontally. At the west end of the shrine, on an irregular brass plated black stone throne (7' \u00d7 3' \u00d7 2' 3\"), are standing plain white marble images of R\u00e1m (2' 8\") Lakshman (2' 10\") and Sita (2' 5\"), R\u00e1m in the middle, Lakshman on the right, and Sita on the left. R\u00e1m's right hand which rests on his right hip holds a marble arrow and the left hand grasps a marble bow. Lakshman's image is of a slightly darker hue and like R\u00e1m's holds a bow. Sita stands with folded hands. All the images are dressed, R\u00e1m and Lakshman wearing turbans waist-cloths and coats, and Sita a robe and bodice. On the same throne with the images, on a small projection, to the left, is set a white marble female figure (1' 7\") intended to represent Ahaly\u00e1b\u00e1i Holkar (1735-1795) the famous temple-building princess of \u00cdndor who built this temple.\u00b9 Ahaly\u00e1b\u00e1i is seated and has plain features. She is dressed in a white robe and holds a ling in her left hand on which her right hand drops a bel leaf. These four images are said to have been brought from Upper India. In addition to\n\n\u00b9 Compare Bombay Gazetteer, XVI. 513 and note 1.\nthese and on the same throne are a pair of small brass sandals or *paduk\u00e1s*, brass images of Vithoba, Rakhum\u00e1i, Krishna, Ganpati, and Vyankoba, an arrow, and a *sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m* or bored stone. The throne has a wooden post at each corner and over these on the three sides are wooden arches. The whole frame work as well as the arches is plated with brass. At the south end of the shrine on a square stone are smooth black stone images of Garud (2' 4\") and M\u00e1ru\u021bi (1' 6\"). At the north end is a *ling* whose case or *sh\u00e1lunkha* is placed on the floor. The ceiling of the shrine is boarded. In the shrine behind and on each side of the throne a way is left for the holy circuit or *pradakshina*. Behind the shrine a small room opens into a kitchen, so that the food offering may be brought direct without running the risk of a stranger's touch. Outside, on the north and south of the shrine, two passages open into an alley communicating with the public road; so that people not desirous of entering the shrine may make their obeisance at the door and make their holy circuit or *pradakshina* entering the alley and passing through the northern passage in front of the shrine and back through the south passage out into the alley again. Over the shrine is a weather-beaten spire star-shaped but plain and built of brick and mortar with a wooden pinnacle. It is in two tiers twenty feet high, and, except a M\u00e1ru\u021bi in a niche in the upper tier, has no figures.\n\nThe temple has two daily services. The morning service is between six and seven. It consists of washing the feet of the images, wiping their faces with a wet cloth, applying sandal-paste to the male and redpowder to the female images, putting garlands of flowers round their necks, and laying loose flowers and *tulsi* leaves at their feet. A light is waved with burning incense and camphor; and, with the offering of food, the service closes. While waving the light, the priest and others present sing songs in honour of R\u00e1m. The evening service is shorter than the morning service and is held between seven and eight. The faces of the images are wiped with a wet cloth, fresh sandal-paste or redpowder is applied; a light with burning camphor is waved, and sweetened milk is offered while the priest and the people present sing songs. Once a fortnight on the elevenths or *ek\u00e1dashis* the worship is elaborate. The clothes are removed and the images are rubbed with sugar and pieces of lemon and bathed. The images are then rubbed with a mixture of the five nectars, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter, sugar, and honey, and are again washed with water; new suits of clothes are put on, sandal-paste or redpowder is applied to their foreheads, garlands of flowers are thrown round their necks, and nosegays are fixed in the turbans of the gods. Sweetmeats, milk, plantains, and other fruit are offered. As usual, lights, burning incense, and camphor are waved and songs are sung. The holidays in connection with this temple are the R\u00e1mnavmi which lasts for nine days from the first to the ninth of Chaitra or March-April; and Hanum\u00e1njayanti which falls on the following full-moon. During the nine R\u00e1mnavmi days the images are daily bathed and rubbed with the five nectars, Sanskrit hymns and verses are recited; and the worship is much like that on the elevenths. The special\nfeatures are that the offering consists of ordinary food and not of sweets, the images are clothed in new and costly dresses with ornaments, and R\u00e1m's turban is folded in the shape of a parrot, a sparrow, or a peacock. Every evening during these days story-tellers or kath\u00e9karis discourse for one or two hours on Pur\u00e1nic legends, or kath\u00e1s are held with music and singing. On the ninth day which is kept as a fast in honour of the birthday of R\u00e1m, the discourse takes place about noon which is supposed to be the hour of R\u00e1m's birth. The subject on this day is the legend of R\u00e1m's birth, and, as the hour draws near, while the kath\u00e9kari is telling the story of the birth, a cradle is brought, a cocoanut covered with cloth is laid in it, and the cradle is rocked, the kath\u00e9kari singing songs about the birth of R\u00e1m. A mixture of dry powdered ginger, sugar, and grated cocoa-kernel is distributed among the assembled people. In the evening learned Br\u00e1hmans are called to recite Vedic hymns and are treated with some sweets and a cash gift of 3d. (2 as.). Next day about 200 Br\u00e1hmans are feasted, and the holiday preparation on that day consists of gram cakes. Each Br\u00e1hman receives a copper and a packet of betel leaves. In the evening R\u00e1m's sandals are carried in a palanquin in a torchlight procession round the town. Musicians accompany and fireworks are let off. The procession goes the usual holy round or pradakshina and returns at midnight. The Hanum\u00e1n-jayanti festival takes place four days later on the full-moon of Chaitra on which day at sunrise Hanum\u00e1n or M\u00e1ruti is supposed to have been born. A kath\u00e9kari gives a sermon on the birth in the wooden hall opposite the little temple of M\u00e1ruti. The discourse begins at an early hour and is over by sunrise when the people throw into the air large quantities of redpowder or gul\u00e1l and sweet-scented powder or buka in honour of the birth. Some people keep this day as a fast. Next day a number of Br\u00e1hmans are fed and paid \u00bdd. (\u00bc a.). The temple ministrant is a Br\u00e1hman whose family was originally appointed by Holkar. The family is now divided into four branches each of which takes its turn in yearly rotation. The officiating family gets an annuity of \u00a36 (Rs. 60) from Holkar and the temple receipts which amount to about \u00a310 (Rs. 100) a year. The officiating priest also gets a plateful of food every day and one member of his family is allowed a free dinner. The cost of the festivals which amounts to about \u00a320 (Rs. 300) and the other ordinary expenses are paid by Holkar. In connection with this temple is a charitable feeding house or annachhatra for feeding Br\u00e1hman beggars. Twenty-five Br\u00e1hmans are fed every day of whom twelve are privileged and the rest are strangers. A clerk looks after this charity and the private property of Holkar, which consists of a mansion with several shops. The worshippers live in the mansion next door. No ascetics, musicians, or other attendants live on the temple premises.\n\nB\u00e1bhly\u00e1's Mah\u00e1dev on the river bank to the south of the Uddhav landing, is a small plain temple of rough stone. It is a shrine (7' \u00d7 7') and a porch resting on two rough pillars and two pilasters in the front wall. The temple plinth is three feet and the total height sixteen feet. The porch has a stone image of Nandi facing the shrine door. In the front wall on each side of the door is a small niche, probably\nfor oil lamps. The roof is flat and paved with stone slabs. The door is latticed with iron bars. In the shrine is the ling in its case or sh\u00e1lunkha, the spout of the case facing north. Round the case is a circular ridge of mortar the inside of which can be filled with water so as to cover the ling. The chief rite in worshipping the ling is the abhishek or pouring of water drop by drop or in a thin stream over the god. The belief, that when the god has to be specially pleased the ling should be drowned in water, accounts for the floor of the shrine in most Mah\u00e1dev temples being low enough to allow the ling to be flooded. When as in this temple the floor is not low enough the ling has to be surrounded with a circular ridge or some other arrangement. The ling and sh\u00e1lunkha are rough and made of black stone. Behind them in the west wall is a niche with a rough stone image of Ganpati. In the south wall is a small lamp niche, and in the niche in the north wall the old flowers and bel leaves are kept. An inscription states that the temple was built by a Deshasth Br\u00e1hman named Kshetrap\u00e1l N\u00e1ik Beri in Shak 1694 (A.D. 1772) at a cost of \u00a3162 (Rs. 1620). The ministrants are Koli fishermen who take all offerings made to the god. The daily worship consists of pouring water over the god, rubbing the ling with sandal-paste, throwing flowers, and offering food in the morning. On Mondays in addition Br\u00e1hmans pour water in a thin stream or abhishek while repeating verses. On the great day of the temple, the Mah\u00e1shivr\u00e1tra in M\u00e1gh or February-March, the Kolis paint the temple, Br\u00e1hmans pour water over the ling, and many families make food offerings.\n\nOn the river bank close to the Chandrabh\u00e1ga landing is Chandrabh\u00e1ga\u2019s temple built of rough stone on a plinth five feet high. The temple is reached by two stone steps with, in front of the steps, a raised stone-pavement with a tortoise slab fixed in it. The temple consists of a shrine (9\u2019 \u00d7 6\u2019 \u00d7 7\u201d) and a front porch (12\u2019 \u00d7 6\u2019). The porch is open on three sides with pillars supporting arches on each side. At each end of the front wall is a pilaster. The shrine has four small lamp niches two in the front wall and one each in the north and south walls. The image of the goddess Chandrabh\u00e1ga or Ganga is a smooth black stone figure of a woman about 2\u2019 6\u201d high seated on a plain hourglass shaped stone throne (2\u2019 7\u201d \u00d7 1\u2019 8\u201d \u00d7 1\u2019 6\u201d). The throne is fixed in an arch cut in the west wall and in front of the throne is a stone (1\u2019 \u00d7 1\u2019 \u00d7 1\u2019) on which a pair of sandals are carved. The image is in a squatting position the hands laid on the thighs with open palms. In the right palm is a stone sweet-ball or modak and in the left a lotus flower. The image bears the tracery of female garments; the eyeballs are of brass, and the head wears a paper crown or cap. The spire, which rises in two tiers over the shrine, is of brick and mortar eighteen feet high. It has plain niches with no figures. On the top two globes one above the other are surmounted by a brass pinnacle. On the top of the porch are three figures of a four-headed Brahma, of Mah\u00e1dev, and of Vishnu. At each end are two small spires. The temple was built in 1857 by one Govind B\u00e1va Chopadkar at a cost of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000). The yearly temple receipts amounting to 6s. or 8s. (Rs. 3-4) go to the Badv\u00e1s of Vithoba\u2019s temple. The receipts are every year farmed to some\nBr\u00e1hman and the contractor for that year becomes the officiating priest and ministrant. The daily service is in the morning. It consists of bathing the image, rubbing its brow with redpowder, and offering flowers, burning incense, and waving a light. Ground-nuts are the only offering. Immediately to the south of the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 temple, enclosed in a solid masonry hall with a flat roof, are two small Mah\u00e1dev temples. The temple nearest to Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1\u2019s is 5' 9\" high and the other is 3' 8\" high both with shrines about three feet square. The ling in the larger temple is six inches high and the ling in the smaller five inches high. These temples were built in 1872-73 at a cost of \u00a350 to \u00a360 (Rs.500-600). They have no ministrant. The person who built them worships the lings and the food offerings are given to a Koli. The temple\u2019s great day is Shiv\u00e1tra in M\u00e1gh or February-March when the athishek or water-pouring is performed, hymns are recited, and Br\u00e1hmans fed.\n\nClose to the south of Ahaly\u00e1b\u00e1i\u2019s R\u00e1m and separated from it by the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing is the temple of Murlidhar or Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1dhish. From outside, the temple, which is entirely built of well dressed stone and mortar, looks like a small castle. The temple faces north and to the west has the mansion of Sindia. The site of the temple is five feet above the level of the road and includes the temple and rows of stone corridors on all four sides. On entering the main door an opening in the left wall leads to an underground chamber and another door leads to an upper-storeyed drum-room or nag\u00e1rdh\u00e1na. The west corridors are walled in and have been turned into a series of rooms where the temple movables and other furniture of the clerk in charge are kept. In the back or south corridor is an almshouse or annach\u00e1tra supported by Sindia in connection with the temple. The east and north corridors are open and empty. At the south-west corner is a smaller tower like the tower-like loft used as a drum-room. Between the corridors and the temple all round is an open space, and at the back of the temple in this space are a few flower and some plantain trees. The temple itself is a strong building raised on a plinth three feet high. It is in three parts an audience hall or s\u00e1kh\u00e1mandap, an antechamber, and a shrine. The audience hall is built of stone and has a stone roof resting on twenty-four stone pillars in four rows of six each of which two on the south side are pilasters. From the pillars of the two outer rows arches rise in a colonnade; the inner rows of pillars have no arches. The floor of the hall is not paved but cowdunged. At the south end of the audience hall on a 2' 6\" higher level and reached by two stone steps a short antechamber six feet square opens into the shrine. In this chamber a bell is hung from a crossbeam and near the bell is kept a large brass plate in which worshippers throw their mite, the ministrant ringing the bell and calling \u2018The money paid by . . . . . (donor\u2019s name) has been received in heaven.\u2019 The east and west walls of the antechamber have niches and a door in the south wall leads down into the shrine. On either side of the door is a stone figure of Jaya and Vijaya the two giant door-keepers. These figures which are 2'8\" high are four-armed and stand on stone pedestals.\nThe figure on the east side of the door is standing with the left leg across the right, and resting on the toes; the west figure has the right leg crossed. The east figure holds in its left hand a conch shell and a club and in the right hand a disc and a wheel. The west figure has a conch and a club in the right hand and a disc and a wheel in the left hand. The shrine is 9' 6\" square, and stone-paved like the antechamber. In the east and west walls are two latticed windows. The east wall has another opening on a large niche used as a bed chamber, and furnished with a small bedstead, bedding, and pillows. The ceiling of the shrine is boarded. The throne or *sinh\u00e1san* is 3' 5\" high and divided into two parts a small upper part and a lower part which forms the base and stretches from the east to the west wall. Over the throne are four arched posts, the front plated with silver and richly ornamented, especially the arch work and the front of the throne. The plating extends 4' 8\" from east to west and in height from the bottom of the throne almost to the ceiling. The frame work within the arches is the holy of holies in which the chief deities are placed. Murlidhar or Dw\u00e1rkadhish is in the middle and his beloved R\u00e1dha and Satyabh\u00e1ma on either side. Murlidhar's image is of smooth shining black stone; the two female figures which are exactly alike are of white marble. Murlidhar's which is about 1' 4\" high stands on a pedestal and on either side has, cut out of the same stone as the image and the pedestal, the figures of two standing Gop\u00e1las or shepherds one above the other with folded hands each about six inches high. Murlidhar has four arms, holding in the right upper and lower hands a club and conch and in the left upper and lower hands a disc and wheel. He wears a coat and a shouldercloth; his waistcloth is shown by plated silver; he wears a silver crown, and all his weapons are coated with silver. The two female images stand eleven inches high and wear the ordinary female dress. In front of the images is a pair of brass sandals and a *sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m*. To the right is a squatting marble figure of a woman 1' 10\" high intended to represent Daulatr\u00e1v Sindia's wife B\u00e1yj\u00e1b\u00e1i who built the temple, endowed it, and put her figure in it in imitation of Ahaly\u00e1b\u00e1i's in R\u00e1mchandra's temple. To the left of the central group are white marble images of Ganpati and Garud. Ganpati is a sitting figure four-armed, holding a rosary in one hand and an elephant's goad in another. Of the second pair one has the palm closed and the other is open with nothing in it. The image of Garud is kneeling and holds a cocoanut with both hands.\n\nThe spire is of brick and mortar. It is star-shaped at the base; above a row of elephants runs round the entire spire; above the elephants are small niches in which different deities were painted but are now mostly defaced. At the top are two globes one above the other with a brass pinnacle. The temple was built in 1849 at a cost of \u00a312,500 (Rs. 1,25,000) by B\u00e1yj\u00e1b\u00e1i the wife of Daulatr\u00e1v Sindia (1795-1827) and the adoptive mother of Jankoji Sindia. At the opening ceremony thousands of Br\u00e1hmans were feasted and the whole ceremony is said to have cost about \u00a37500 (Rs. 75,000).\n\nTwo services are held daily. At the morning service just before\nsunrise a lighted muslin torch is waved round Murlidhar\u2019s face and songs are sung. After the light-waving the feet of the images are washed, the faces wiped with a wet cloth, sandal-paste is applied to Murlidhar and redpowder to his wives, and flowers are thrown over their feet. A food offering is made from food brought from the alms-house. In the evening the feet are not washed but fresh sandal-paste is applied and garlands are tied. Burning camphor is waved, songs are sung, and sugared milk is offered. The door of the sleeping chamber is opened and the worship ends. On the bright eleventh of every month the images are washed bathed in the five nectars and dressed in fresh garments. On the dark elevenths fresh garments are used but the images are simply wiped with a wet cloth.\n\nThe three great days of this temple are, the fifth of the dark half of Jyeshth or June-July, Gokulashtami the dark eighth of Shravan or July-August, and Dasra the bright tenth of Ashvin or September-October. The dark fifth of Jyeshth or June-July is kept as a holiday, as the images were installed on that day. The images are bathed and clothed in fresh garments and a few Br\u00e1hmans are fed. During the first eight days of the dark half of Shravan the images are clothed every day in new garments. The service is the same as on ordinary days. Every evening a kathekari discourses on some Pur\u00e1nic legend to the accompaniment of music. The audience hall is well lighted, silk curtains are drawn all round, and the temple wears a holiday appearance. At midnight on the night of Gokulashtami the dark eighth of Shravan or July-August Krishna\u2019s birth is celebrated by a discourse and by throwing red-powder and incense. On the ninth a number of Br\u00e1hmans are fed; and at night the sandals of the god are carried in a palanquin in a torch-light procession round the town. On Dasra Day the images are dressed in new clothes and ornaments; and the morning service includes the bathing of the images. In the afternoon the god\u2019s sandals are carried in a palanquin outside the town, and then back in a procession round the town. The ministrant is a Devrukha Br\u00e1hman who gets an annuity of \u00a36 (Rs. 60) from Sindia; and the receipts which come to about \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 125) are credited to the state. The total cost of the temple including four drummers, messengers, a Pur\u00e1n reader, and a clerk amount to about \u00a322 10s. (Rs. 225) a month. This includes the maintenance of an alms-house at which twelve Br\u00e1hmans are fed five of them outsiders. The temple Pur\u00e1n-reader reads the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan or Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rat during eight months in the year and during the rains in addition reads the Bh\u00e1gvat Pur\u00e1n in the mornings.\n\nOn the holy round or pradakshina road at the corner of the lane which comes out from behind the temple of Vithoba is the Choph\u00e1l\u00e1 temple bounded on the east, west, and south by the public road and on the north by a narrow lane. The temple looks old and faces west. It is in three parts, a front court or sabh\u00e1mandap, a central shrine, and a back court corresponding to the front court. The plinth of\n\n---\n\n1 The service is much like the worship in R\u00e1mchandra\u2019s temple. See above p. 446.\nthe front court is 2' 1\" and is higher than the floor of the shrine and the back court. The front court (30' 9\" x 17' 5\") is built of dressed stone and mortar and has a flat roof of solid masonry resting on eight stone pillars and four pilasters all with arches. At the north and south ends are four arches two on each side and three each in the front and back rows. The roof is not continuous as the space between each set of four pillars has a separate roof. The four pilasters are in the front wall of the shrine. The court floor is stone-paved and in the middle has a round slab called the Stage Slab or rangshila on which pilgrims sing and dance. Between this slab and the shrine door is a stone engraving of a tortoise. A low door (3' 4\" x 1' 8\") leads to the shrine 10' 6\" square and 6' 6\" high at the sides. It is built of solid masonry, has a stone-paved floor and a slightly domed ceiling with the appearance of round tiers narrowing towards the top. There is a small brick latticed opening in the north wall and a back door (4' x 2') opening into the back court. The objects of worship in the shrine are the Vishnu-Panchayatan or images of Vishnu, Amba, Ganpati, Mahadev, and Surya. Vishnu's is a standing black stone image 2' 9\" high, smooth, and polished, the right leg crossing the left and resting on tiptoe and the hands holding a stone flute. On either side of Vishnu, carved out of the same block as the image itself, a standing milkmaid or gopi holds a flywhisk and has a cow lying at her feet. Vishnu wears a waistcloth, a shouldercloth, and a turban with tinsel borders. Behind and to the right of Vishnu a black slab (1' 9\" x 1') stands on a stone, resting against the back wall of the shrine. On this slab is an engraving of Surya, a spirited seven-headed horse dragging a chariot with the Sun seated in it. The Sun wears a crown and has a halo with shooting rays of light round his face. Behind and to the left of Vishnu is the goddess Ambabai a two-feet high black stone standing image of a woman with eight arms four on each side. In her four right hands Amba holds a trident, a sword, a discus, and the tail of a buffalo, and in the left four, a shield, an hourglass-shaped tabor or damru, a club, and the toplock of the buffalo demon Mahishasur. The image shows the goddess in the act of killing the demon who had hid himself in the body of a buffalo on whose back one of the feet of the goddess rests. The severed head of the buffalo lies on one side at her foot. The goddess holds the demon's toplock and appears to pull out his trunk from the body of the buffalo. Behind, and to the right of Vishnu, is a squatting Ganpati two feet high four-armed and empty-handed and seated on a block of stone. In front of Amba is Mahadev represented by a ling two feet high set in a large case or shalunkha. In addition to these are three other images of Maruti, Khandoba, and near Ganpati a sitting Garud 2' 2\" high with folded hands. Maruti's is a rough standing black stone figure three feet high with the right arm raised and the left resting on the waist. Khandoba's is a standing figure 1' 6\" high engraved on a slab. The back court is twenty feet long by fourteen wide. All the side arches are walled in and the whole turned into a room occupied by the temple ministrant with a small door at the back in the middle arch. The spire, which\nis squat and weather-beaten with empty niches, ends in a large globe with a wooden pinnacle at the top.\n\nThe temple ministrant is a Br\u00e1hman kept by the Badva family in charge of the temple. He performs the morning service which consists of washing the images, applying sandal-paste, offering flowers, waving lights, and offering food brought from the Badva's house. This temple is said to have been built about 1770 at a cost of about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) by one N\u00e1r\u00e1yan N\u00e1kbre of Ind\u00e1pur. N\u00e1r\u00e1yan came as a pilgrim, and slept in the temple where Vithoba appeared to him in a dream and told him to go and live with a Badva whom the god named. To assure N\u00e1r\u00e1yan that his dream was true Vithoba tied a quantity of wheat and four coppers in N\u00e1r\u00e1yan's shouldercloth. On awaking N\u00e1r\u00e1yan went to the Badva named by Vithoba who welcomed him under orders from the god who had also visited the Badva. It happened that the offering of food which the Badva carried on behalf of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan could not, on account of the crowds of pilgrims, be laid before the god. N\u00e1r\u00e1yan was unhappy, but Vithoba again appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be distressed saying that he would be well pleased if N\u00e1r\u00e1yan built a temple of Vishnu and the four other deities that make the panch\u00e1yatan.\n\nPadm\u00e1vati's temple is about half a mile outside and to the west of the town in a pond of that name which is dry during the fair weather. The pond and the temple were built by Sakuvarb\u00e1i, wife of Yashvantr\u00e1v Pav\u00e1r, chief of Dh\u00e1r about the year 1778. The pond is about 1200' long by 450' wide and has its four sides built of solid masonry, with steps or landings on the north south and east sides. The wall on the west has a number of sluices and a large opening 360' wide for admitting storm-water. The temple is built on a platform (58' 9\" \u00d7 55' \u00d7 8' 3\") of solid masonry in the bed of the pond. It is reached by a masonry bridge (78' \u00d7 11' \u00d7 8' 3\"), which, supported on four narrow arches, runs from the masonry platform to the nearest landing place on the east corner. At the east or entrance end of the bridge are two masonry pillars with niches for oil lamps. One of these pillars eleven feet high is ruined and the other eighteen feet high is in good repair. To the left, in a niche in the east landing, is a rough stone image of Ganpati smeared with redlead. The bridge leads to the platform on which is the temple with a 2' 6\" plinth and so built as to leave ten to twelve feet of the platform open all round for the holy circuit or pradakshina. The temple consists of an antechamber and a shrine. The antechamber is a solid masonry room fifteen feet square. It has four doors, those in the north, east, and south walls opening on the open platform, and the door in the west wall leading to the shrine. The doors are 4' 9\" high by 2' 4\" wide, and, except that which leads into the shrine and has shutters, all are open. Almost opposite the north and south wall doors the platform is reached by stone stairs from the pond bed. The four corners of the antechamber are turned into niches but their upper parts look like joined arches, wide enough to reach the arches on the doorways, so as to give the inside roof a domed appearance, after turning the square into an octagon.\nThe roof is domed and is made of eight belts narrowing to the top. Outside the roof has a flat surface of solid plastered masonry with short turret walls and figures of saints. The floor of the antechamber is paved with stones and has in the centre a flat round stone with a Marathi inscription which may be translated:\n\nThe pond and temple of Padma-vati built and offered to the goddess by Sakvarba'i wife of Yashvantra'v Pava'r on Sunday the fifth of the bright half of Vaisha'kh (April-May) in Shak 1700, the cycle year being Vilambi.\n\nThe cost of the buildings is estimated at \u00a37000 (Rs. 70,000). The shrine which is built of solid masonry is eleven feet square with a paved floor about a foot lower than the antechamber. The image is a woman's bust two feet high cut out of black trap; the features are regular with copper moulds for eyes and a bare head. The image wears no clothes, and the whole bust is thickly covered with redlead. The bust is set on an ornamental stone pedestal 3' 6\" long, 2' 6\" broad, and 2' high. On either side of the image in the corner is a stone slab on which cobras are carved and covered with redlead. Over the shrine is a quadrangular spire in three tiers with side niches containing figures of gods now much out of repair. Over the spire is a wooden pinnacle.\n\nThe daily worship consists of the usual morning service of bath, redpowder, flowers, and food offering performed by an agent of the Badvas. The Nine Nights or navratri festival in the bright half of Ashvin or September-October is held with great show. A bamboo frame is hung in front of the image, and under this frame, in front of the pedestal, the floor is strewn with a layer of earth two to three inches thick in which wheat is sown and allowed to sprout; from the bamboo frame hang flower garlands and strings of fried wheat-flour cakes or kadaknis reaching to the floor. During the holidays one garland is added every day by the temple priest; and other people add their own strings of wheat-cakes in fulfilment of vows or when the goddess is their family deity. Except that on the tenth or Dasra Day an offering of some sweets and rice is made the rest of the service is the same as on ordinary days. Another great festival is the night of the full-moon of Ashvin or September-October, five days after the Dasra, when numbers of people sing devotional songs or bhajans at the temple to the accompaniment of cymbals. The devotees keep up all night singing and drinking milk, and those who can afford it let off fireworks. The offerings to the goddess are common salt in crystals, oil, jivari or wheat flour, pounded jivari grain, groundnuts, dry dates, and sugarcandy. These offerings are said to be made to please the goddess, that she may avert from her votaries diseases, especially skin affections over which the goddess is said to have control. The revenue of the temple is farmed yearly by the Badva for \u00a31 (Rs. 10) and the receipts vary from \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10 - 15).\n\nAt the north end of the town close to the trenches for male pilgrims and about 300 feet west of Ambabai is the temple of Vyasa the reputed author of the Mahabharat an old building in a mud and stone enclosure (100' x 88'). At the north-east corner of the enclosure is a masonry well, whose water is much used for\ndrinking. On the north is a small temple or shrine with a standing image of M\u0101ruti with folded hands and besmeared with redlead. On the west is a ruined rest-house used by Bair\u0101gis and religious beggars. In the middle of the enclosure is the temple of Vy\u0101s on a plinth three feet higher than the rest of the enclosure and 5\u00bd feet above the level of the road. The temple is in two parts a hall and a shrine. The mandap or hall (19' \u00d7 14' \u00d7 9') is 19\u00bd paces east and has a flat mud roof resting on eight wooden posts. Its floor is not paved and it is partly walled on the north and south sides. A door (3' 6\" \u00d7 2') on the west leads to the shrine 9' square and 10' high with a plastered conical roof but no spire. The shrine has in a niche (3' 4\" \u00d7 2' 5\" \u00d7 1' 2\") an image of Vy\u0101s 2' 4\" high sitting on a stone pedestal (1' 10\" \u00d7 1' 4\" \u00d7 7\") with his right thigh crossing the left. Vy\u0101s's left hand rests on his thigh and shows the tracery of a book; the fingers of the right hand are drawn together as if holding a pen; and the head has the tracery of a skullcap. The B\u0101dv\u0101s of Vithoba's temple are the priests of this temple and send an agent to conduct the worship. The worship consists of a morning service and a light-waving or \u0101rti in the evening. The morning service has nothing peculiar, but, as Vy\u0101s the author of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is regarded as a special patron of the twice-born, many Br\u0101hmans worship the image every day, and many more visit the temple daily. All worship is over by twelve after which the image is dressed in a silk-bordered waistcloth and a skullcap and then visitors can only bow to the god from a distance. In the evening a light is waved and songs are sung. The only great day of this temple is the full-moon of K\u0101rtik or October-November when the five-nectar worship is offered in the early morning. During the first ten days of Jyeshth or June-July the Br\u0101hmans of Vithoba's temple hold large feasts in this temple. The Bh\u0101gvat is read in the mornings. The temple was built by one Jotipant and the rest-houses were built about fifty years ago.\n\nT\u0101kpittha Vithoba's temple is a mud-roofed house in a lane about 225 feet west of the great temple of Vithoba. The temple which is built of stone and mud consists of an anteroom and a shrine. Both the rooms are raised on a plinth 2' 8\" high and have in front a roofless mud and stone platform (14' \u00d7 8'). The anteroom (8' 9\" \u00d7 8' 7\" \u00d7 8') faces west and opens into the shrine by a small side door in its south wall. It contains a black stone image of M\u0101ruti 2' 4\" high standing on a stone. The small low door (4' 5\" \u00d7 2') in the south wall of the anteroom leads to the dark shrine (10' 5\" \u00d7 4' 8\" \u00d7 7' 3\") with at its west end images of Vithoba and Rakhum\u0101i. Vithoba a rough blackstone image 3' 11\" high stands on a plain block of stone with hands akimbo. The right hand holds a wheel and the left a conch, and on the head is a crown. On Vithoba's left stands Rakhum\u0101i, a small black stone image of a woman two feet high standing on a raised mud and brick platform. At the east end of the shrine a raised mud platform or ota 1' 3\" high and 2' 5\" broad stretches along the entire width of the room. On this platform\n\n---\n\n1 See above p. 446.\nwhich is called the *shejghar* or bedchamber of the god a low bedstead is usually kept.\n\nThe temple priest a Badya is its owner. Only one service is held in the morning when the image is bathed, sandal paste is applied, flowers and flower garlands are offered, the *\u00e1rti* light is waved, camphor and incense sticks are burnt, and a food offering is made. The yearly receipts of the temple average about \u00a35 (Rs. 50) chiefly from pilgrims who make vows in the name of this Vithoba, and if their wishes are fulfilled, offer cash, millet flour, and buttermilk. The temple is said to have been built in 1618 (S. 1540) by R\u00e1dh\u00e1b\u00e1i an old Br\u00e1hman widow and a great devotee of Vithoba. She was in the habit of taking a quantity of buttermilk and millet flour or *t\u00e1kpit* as an offering for Vithoba; and, whenever crowded out or otherwise unable to make her offering, she used to fast. Once she was crowded out for fifteen days during the whole of which she ate nothing. Vithoba took pity on her and appearing to her in a dream, told her to open her eyes and make her usual offering. On opening her eyes the old lady saw this Vithoba and installed him in the place where the image now stands.\n\nClose to Datta\u2019s landing and the Datt\u00e1traya temple, at the corner of the *pradakshina* or holy-round road as it passes by the parapet wall between the Chandrabh\u00e1ga and Datta landings, is a modern temple of Batteshvar Mah\u00e1dev built about 1870 by the Komtis of Pandharpur. The temple is of solid masonry with a five feet plinth. It consists of an audience hall or *sabh\u00e1mandap* (16' \u00d7 8') and a shrine (9' \u00d7 8'), both with masonry roofs, the roof of the hall resting on six stone pillars. In the middle of the shrine is a *ling* in a *sh\u00e1lunkha* (2' \u00d7 1' 6\" \u00d7 9\"). The daily worship is performed in the forenoon by a Br\u00e1hman agent of the Pandharpur Komtis. The temple proceeds go to the Kolis. On the Mah\u00e1sh\u00edvr\u00e1tra Day in February-March the Komtis hold a festival at the temple like that performed at Mallik\u00e1rjun\u2019s temple but with less show and noise. Only the *abhishek*, the bath, and the bathing with five nectars are performed.\n\nBeri\u2019s Mah\u00e1dev is a small temple on the holy round road about 500 feet to the south-east of K\u00e1la M\u00e1runi\u2019s. The temple faces east and lies in a small enclosure (50' \u00d7 30'). It is a simple stone-built chamber (9' \u00d7 9' \u00d7 7') with two doors in the front or north and east walls, each 4' high by 2' 3\" wide. The chamber has a masonry roof slightly domed inside and plastered and flat outside. In the middle of the chamber is a *ling* which with its case is about a foot high. The floor is paved and round the *sh\u00e1lunkha* is a ridge of cement about six inches high to lead to the north all water poured over the *ling*. In front of the *ling* is a seated stone bull about a foot high. The daily worship is performed in the morning by a Br\u00e1hman. He bathes the *ling*, rubs it with sandal-paste and rice grains, throws flowers over it and makes it an offering of molasses or groundnuts.\n\n---\n\n1 The temple was called Batteshvar as it was built out of the discount or batta received by Komtis from their constituents.\n2 During four months in the year this hall is used as an octroi station by the Pandharpur municipality.\ntemple proceeds amounting to about 10s. (Rs. 5) a year are taken by Kolis. The only holiday is Shivr\u00e1tra the dark thirteenth of M\u00e1gh or February-March. On this day the Br\u00e1hman holds a somewhat longer service the chief rite in which is a water-pouring or abhishek over the ling while Br\u00e1hmans recite Vedic hymns. Next day the Br\u00e1hman feeds two or three Br\u00e1hmans in honour of the god. The temple was built about 1785 by Kshetrap\u00e1l Beri a native of Pandharpur. Though it is generally called after him the real name of the god is Bhadreshvar Mah\u00e1dev.\n\nOn the pradaksh\u00edna or holy-round road to the south-west of the town about 600 feet north-west of Beri\u2019s Mah\u00e1dev lies K\u00e1la M\u00e1ruti\u2019s temple a ruined building more like a hut than a temple. It faces north-east and is in two parts a tiled room or hall (16\u2019 \u00d7 13\u2019 \u00d7 7\u2019) and behind it a shrine (7\u2019 6\u201d \u00d7 6\u2019 \u00d7 7\u2019). The roof of the hall, which is open on the north and east, rests on seventeen wooden posts. The shrine which is entered by a door (5\u2019 \u00d7 2\u2019) with latticed shutters has a conical plastered roof but no spire. The floor of the hall is paved with stone; that of the shrine is cowdunged and has a raised seat or ota on either side. M\u00e1ruti\u2019s is a black stone standing image about two feet high, the right knee bent a little, the left hand resting on the hip, and the right arm raised. The image is thickly covered with oil large quantities of which are poured over it every Saturday. Near M\u00e1ruti stands a rough stone image with folded hands of Jambu M\u00e1li the gardener of R\u00e1van who was killed by M\u00e1ruti. The shrine was built by a poor Br\u00e1hman R\u00e1mchandra in 1799 and the hall by a Bombay Bh\u00e1tia about 1860. The worship is done once a day by an agent of the Badv\u00e1s, who farm the yearly revenue of the temple for about \u00a32 (Rs.20). The only yearly holiday is the full-moon of Chaitra or March-April which is believed to be the monkey god\u2019s birthday. On this day one of the Badv\u00e1s worships the image, bathes it with milk, curds, honey, clarified butter, and sugar, and dresses it in a new waistcloth. Next day he feeds four or five Br\u00e1hmans in honour of the god. According to one story this M\u00e1ruti is said to have been established here for the success of his mission by the devotee Bh\u00e1nud\u00e1s, before he started for Vijaynagar to bring back Vithoba. Every V\u00e1rkari or time-keeping pilgrim visits the temple, and every gang of pilgrims when making the holy round stands in front of the temple and repeats a few of Tuk\u00e1ram\u2019s verses. This mark of respect shown by V\u00e1rkaris is peculiar to this M\u00e1ruti and is probably due to its legendary connection with the bringing of Vithoba. Unlike other M\u00e1rut\u00eds this image is never covered with redlead.\n\nClose to the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r gate about 400 feet west of R\u00e1mchandra\u2019s temple is T\u00e1mbda M\u00e1ruti\u2019s which is considered the original M\u00e1ruti of Pandharpur and is the most popular. The temple is a single-roomed masonry building outside the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r thoroughfare. In front of the temple is a hall (8\u2019 \u00d7 8\u2019 \u00d7 12\u2019) with a masonry roof, on which, facing the shrine, is a stone bull or Nandi brought from some ruined temple of Mah\u00e1dev with cobras cut in relief on each side resting on two rough\n\n---\n\n1 See above p. 431.\nstone pillars and two pilasters and a paved floor. In the east wall a door (4' \u00d7 2' 3\") opens into the shrine (9' \u00d7 9' \u00d7 10') with a masonry roof consisting of slabs arranged in squares the upper squares smaller than the lower, and gradually ending in a single square keystone. In an arch (7' \u00d7 9') in the shrine is a standing M\u0101ruti six feet high its features hid in a coating of redlead and oil. The image has two hands, the left hand resting on the hip and the right holding the tail. At the foot of the niche is a slab carved into a cobra. In addition to the chief image the temple has eleven other images of M\u0101ruti cut in relief on the sides of each of the front pillars which support the hall roof and one on each pilaster. It is lucky to visit eleven M\u0101rutis every day and for convenience eleven are grouped here in one temple. The ministrant is a Gurav. He does the ordinary morning service at about sunrise. In the evening he waves a light in front of the image to the accompaniment of songs. Other residents of the town including Br\u0101hmans worship the god and many visit the temple every day. The temple has only one yearly holiday or festival, the full-moon of Chaitra or March-April, which is regarded as the god's birthday. The god is supposed to have been born at sunrise. Therefore an hour or so before sunrise many people gather round the temple, a Harid\u0101s preaches a sermon or katha relating the circumstances of the birth, and at sunrise redpowder and the fragrant buka powder are sprinkled in honour of the birth, and powdered ginger and sugar are handed to all present. During the forenoon, after the Gurav's worship, the god is worshipped by Br\u0101hmans engaged for the occasion. The Br\u0101hmans' worship includes the bathing of the image with a continuous stream or abhishek, then with a mixture of the five nectars sugar, honey, clarified butter, curds, and milk, and then the usual offerings of flowers and food. The image is coated with redlead mixed with oil. Next day a number of Br\u0101hmans are fed. The yearly receipts of the temple amounting to about \u00a35 (Rs.50) go to the Gurav. The temple is said to have been built by the celebrated R\u0101md\u0101s Sv\u0101mi, the religious teacher and guide of the great Shiv\u0101ji (1627-1680). The temple was repaired about 1730 by one Pandhre, and again about 1855 by Yashvantr\u0101v a Haidarabad noble. All classes of Hindus visit this temple on wedding occasions. The bridegroom, before going to the bride's for the marriage ceremony, visits this M\u0101ruti, bows low before it, and lays a copper and a set of betel leaves and nuts in front of the image.\n\nNext door to the west of Murlidhar's temple is G\u0101richa or the Quartz Mah\u0101dev's small ruined temple of little importance. It is in a small yard (54' \u00d7 45') and faces east. In the south-east corner of the yard is a pipal tree, and under it a rough redlead M\u0101ruti. At the south-west end are two ruined buildings used by beggars and ascetics. The temple which is of stone and cement includes a hall (33' \u00d7 23') and a shrine. The hall is of masonry its flat plaster roof resting on eleven stone pillars and three pilasters. The floor is paved and in the middle has a small stone bull (2' \u00d7 2') on a pedestal eight inches high. In front of the bull is a small Mah\u0101dev. In the north wall of the hall four windows look on the high road.\nleading to the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing. A door (4' 8\" \u00d7 2' 6\") leads down by one step to the shrine (9' \u00d7 9' \u00d7 12'), in the middle of which is a linga in a case (1' 7\" \u00d7 1' \u00d7 6\") both cut out of one white marble slab from which the god takes his name of G\u00e1richa. The white slab is set in a larger black stone case (4' 6\" \u00d7 2' \u00d7 2'). The spire which is star-shaped and thirty-three feet high rises in four tiers. In the lowest tier are figures of the bull, in the second and third are the different incarnations of Vishnu, and at the top is a globe surmounted by a wooden pinnacle. The whole is ruined and weather-beaten and the figures are broken in many places. The god is worshipped every forenoon by a priest sent by the temple committee. The only festival is on the great Shiv\u00e1tra the dark thirteenth of M\u00e1gh or February-March. On this day a special service is performed including the water-pouring or abhishek\u00e1 and the five-nectar or panch\u00e1mrit bath. Next day a number of Br\u00e1hmans are fed at the expense of the temple committee. The yearly receipts of the temple amount to about 10s. (Rs. 5) which are taken by Kol\u00eds. Some ascetics and beggars generally live in the temple and during the four rainy months or ch\u00e1turm\u00e1s a Pur\u00e1n reading is generally held in the hall. The temple was built by the second Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v (1720-1740).\n\nOn a mound on the river bank in the north of the town, about 200 paces south of the road which leads to the town after crossing the river, is Lakhub\u00e1i's temple. It is a masonry building including a hall and a shrine. The hall (21' \u00d7 17' \u00d7 9') is of stone and cement and has a plinth six feet high reached by four stone steps. The roof is flat and of solid masonry. Three of the sides are arches springing from four stone pillars and the fourth or east face is open. In the west wall a door (4' 6\" \u00d7 2') leads to the shrine. Of several wall niches only two to the north and south of the shrine door have images. The south niche contains a rough image of M\u00e1r\u00fati two feet high thickly coated with redlead. The north niche contains a rough sitting image of Ganpati, two feet high, the features hid under redlead and with the lower pair of hands resting on his thigh. The shrine, which is nearly eight feet square, is on the same level as the hall, and its floor like the hall floor is of masonry. It has a slightly domed masonry roof about twelve feet high in the centre. Two small holes, one in the north and the other in the south wall, admit light and air. In the west wall a niche (7' \u00d7 6' \u00d7 4' 6\") contains a plain black stone sitting image of the goddess Lakhub\u00e1i raised on a stone pedestal (3' \u00d7 2' 6\" \u00d7 2'). The image sits cross-legged and has four arms, the lower two resting on the thighs and each of the upper pair holding two elephants overhead. The hem of a robe and some ornaments round the neck and wrists are roughly shown. To the left of Lakhub\u00e1i outside the large niche, is a rough image of the sun riding in a chariot drawn by a seven-headed horse with a charioteer on the box. In front of the goddess is a large block on which is set a round stone covered with redlead. The round stone, which is still worshipped with Lakhub\u00e1i, is called t\u00e1ndla and is said to have represented the goddess before the present image was made. A wooden bar like the horizontal bar in Vithoba's temple is thrown across the whole length of the chamber in front of the image, and visitors have to pass under it to reach the goddess. The temple spire is squat thirteen feet high with no ornament. It is surrounded by a brick and mortar globe and has a wooden pinnacle. The daily\nworship is performed in the forenoon by a Br\u00e1hman who pays a certain sum and takes the offerings. The rites have nothing special, except that the final offering is of cooked food which the Br\u00e1hman brings from his house. The temple great days are the nine days before Dasra in the bright half of Ashvin or September-October. As in other temples of goddesses a square bamboo frame is hung from the roof and flower garlands twined in the frame hang down to the floor where is an earthen waterpot. Near the waterpot a bed of earth is heaped and wheat grown on it. A light is kept burning night and day during this festival, and, except that low class women do not come and sing and dance and that no blood sacrifice is offered, the rites are the same as in Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i's temple. On the Ashvin or September-October full-moon five days after Dasra, a number of Br\u00e1hmans meet in the temple at night and watch singing playing and drinking boiled milk. During the first ten days of the bright half of Jyeshth or May-June a number of Br\u00e1hmans are fed in the temple. The yearly income of this temple which amounts to about \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15) is taken by the Badv\u00e1s. Some wayfaring ascetics live in the hall and the place has a bad name as a haunt of gamblers and hemp-smokers. The temple legend is that Lakshmi once quarrelled with her husband Vishnu and being offended came to the spot then known as Dindirvan and sat on the bank of a pond. Vishnu followed her and they made friends. Some time later, at the request of Vithoba's devotee Pundlik, she came with her husband, Vishnu being Vithoba and Lakshmi Lakhub\u00e1i. The temple was built by one Dhondbhat Katke about 1780 on the site of a smaller Hem\u00e1dpanti temple at a cost of \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000). To ensure success in their journey to Tulj\u00e1pur in the Niz\u00e1m's dominions, sixty miles north-east of Pandharpur, pilgrim parties generally halt in this temple for a day and live in the hall before starting on their journey.\n\nOn a much-frequented road near the Kumbh\u00e1r landing almost opposite Holkar's mansion and R\u00e1mchandra's temple is Amriteshvar Mah\u00e1dev's which is in great local repute and is almost as popular as Mallik\u00e1rjun's. The whole temple is of masonry and includes a hall and a shrine. In front of the hall a porch has been lately added. On either side of the temple are corridors, the south corridors sometimes used by beggars and the north by a Br\u00e1hman priest. These corridors are of brick and mortar with a flat earthen roof. The front hall or portico is a wooden structure with flat earthen roof resting on wooden posts. The roof is higher than the roof of the original hall of the temple and the space between them is used as a drum-room or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. The masonry hall (33' \u00d7 16' \u00d7 9') has a masonry roof supported on eight pillars and twelve pilasters. In the middle of the paved floor of this hall a round slab called rangshila is slightly raised above the general level. At the west end of the hall, on either side of the door which opens into the shrine, are small rooms. In the north side room (4' 6\" \u00d7 4' 6\" \u00d7 8\") entered by a small latticed door (4' 9\" \u00d7 2' 6\") is a case and a ling of Narmadeshvar Mah\u00e1dev. The south room, which is used for keeping the temple brass lamps masks and clothes, is of the same size. In the passage between the two rooms is the stone image of a sitting bull (1' 5\" \u00d7 1' 6\") on a pedestal (1' 6\" \u00d7 2' 6\" \u00d7 1' 2\"). In the north wall of the hall are two niches, one with a stone image of a seated four-armed Lakshmi-N\u00e1r\u00e1yan with Lakshmi on his left thigh. In the other niche are two\nplain stone cobras. In the passage between the rooms are two other niches, the north wall niche with a rough image of M\u0101ruti and the south wall niche with a rough stone image of Ganpati. A door (4' 4\" \u00d7 2' 4\") in the west wall of the hall leads down by three steps to the shrine (8' 4\" \u00d7 8' 4\" \u00d7 13'). The shrine has two latticed openings in its north and south walls. There are two niches in these walls one to hold the cast-off offerings of the god and the other to hold lights. In the middle of the shrine in a case or sh\u0101lunkha (4' \u00d7 2' 6\" \u00d7 8\") is a flat-topped ling ten inches high. The shrine roof is surmounted by a plain star-shaped spire thirty-two feet high in three tiers. Topping the spire is a globe surmounted by a brass pinnacle.\n\nThe daily service is in the morning. It is preceded by a lamp-waving or k\u0101kadd\u1e5b\u1e6di with songs at about four in the morning. After the lamp-waving the priest removes the covering of the god and the flowers offered overnight and performs the usual worship. After this is over outsiders are allowed to worship the god who is so popular that worshippers throng at all hours of the day. In the evening the priest takes away the flowers, rubs off the sandal-paste marks, and puts on fresh paste, offers fresh flowers, and waves a light and sings to the accompaniment of a drum and bells. The god is bonnetted with a red sackcloth or broadcloth cap as a sign that he retires and no more worship takes place. The festivals are much like those at Mallik\u0101rjun's temple. In addition a bhajan or hymn-singing is performed every night. On the Shivr\u0101tra Day in February-March after a kirtan or katha that is a sermon and song the god's car is dragged round the town. The car is of wood nearly fifteen feet high, and shaped at the top like the wooden frame in which family gods are usually kept. The car is kept next door to the temple. The original image is not taken in the car but a wooden likeness covered by a brass mask. The mask is a human face shaded by an open cobra hood and encircled by one or two snake coils. On the procession day the temple managers make presents of turbans to musicians, a blacksmith, a carpenter, a bricklayer, a woodcutter, a Vadar who brings his caste-fellows to drag the car, a Haridd\u0101s who preaches and sings, a Viththald\u0101s who is a Jain, and a mace-bearer. These men are named by the managers of the temple and are given these presents in return for their services on the car day or to the temple. Cocoanuts are distributed to the Vadars who drag the car, and to musicians who accompany the procession. The yearly income of this temple which amounts to about \u00a310 (Rs. 100) is taken by the Kolis who also take the food offerings of the god. The daily worship is performed by a priest who lives at the temple. He is paid 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2-3) a month and has free lodging. Except the offerings of devotees the only source of income is the rent of the front hall which is let for shops to parched gram and other grain sellers. The yearly income from this source amounts to \u00a35 or \u00a36 (Rs. 50-60) and is spent by the managers on the temple festivals. The temple is said to be as old as the temple of K\u0101lbhairav. It was repaired by one Govind Naik Keskar about 1780 at a cost of about \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000). The front hall was added about 1810 by a Gos\u0101vi merchant who also made the car.\n\nGop\u0101lpur a small modern hamlet lies about a mile south-east of Pandharpur. It contains about twenty-four houses, but its chief object of interest is a temple of Gop\u0101lkrishna the scene of a large\ngathering of pilgrims on the Ashadh or June-July and the Kartik or October-November full-moons. The temple is built on a low hill of trap. A few hundred yards to the north is the Bhima, and to the west separated from it by a road a watercourse called the Pushpavati runs north a few hundred yards to meet the Bhima. North of the temple is an open plain with six nandruk trees with mud and stone platforms built round their trunks; to the north-east is a well not now used, a service pipe, a Ganpati\u2019s temple, and a small masonry pond or ranjan. This pond is said to be the dairy where Yashoda the mother of Krishna used to make buttermilk; the Ganpati, according to this legend, was kept as a sentry. To the east is a short parapet wall built by the Pandharpur municipality. To the south-east is the village of Gopalkpur and to the south are the municipal rest-houses, which were used as a relief house during the 1876 famine. On this side, on the kala days in Ashadh or June-July and Kartik or October-November, pilgrims returning from the kala ceremony make little piles of four or five stones and call them utarandi in the belief that in reward Vithoba will allow them to come again to the next year\u2019s fair.\n\nThe enclosure is an unroofed quadrangle paved with rough stones. It is surrounded on the west south and east by solid masonry walls of dressed stone laid in mortar and about thirty-four feet high. On the quadrangle inside of these walls are rows of cloisters of which the walls form the outer limit. The cloisters are made of solid masonry arches arranged in a single row and topped with a heavy masonry roof. On the north the quadrangle is enclosed by a row of similar cloisters but open outside, and overlooking a municipal rest-house built outside. There are altogether forty-two cloisters but, except during the great fair, few beggars make use of them on account of the distance from Pandharpur. Three doorways lead into the quadrangle, the chief entrance (7' 9\" x 4' 6\") being on the east side facing the shrine of Gopalkrishna\u2019s temple. Another equally important entrance (9' 10\" x 5' 11\") is on the north. On either side of the third doorway (4' 3\" x 2') in the south wall steep stone staircases lead to the top of the cloisters. The north entrance is reached by thirty-six stone steps, with a landing at the fourteenth step, on a level with which, on the right, are three masonry cloisters similar to the inside cloister. On the left is the municipal rest-house built of mud and bricks with a flat roof overlooked by the open cloisters on the north. On either side of the entrance but within the enclosure, a solid lamp-pillar of dressed stone about twenty-one feet high has niches at intervals for oil lamps. By the side of these pillars two steep stone staircases lead to the top of the cloisters.\n\nIn the quadrangle are four temples of Gopalkrishna, Bhimakraj-Mahadev, Lakshmi-Narayan, and Narad, and an underground cell with masonry walls said to have been occupied by Janabai a female devotee of Vithoba. Gopalkrishna\u2019s temple is near the south of the quadrangle and faces east. It is built of masonry with a brick and mortar spire, and is raised on two four-sided unequal plinths one above the other, the lower two feet high of rough stone and the\n\n---\n\n1 Of the kala holidays an account is given below p. 466. Compare Indian Antiquary, XL 154.\nupper three feet high of dressed stone. The temple is in two parts an audience hall and a shrine lying east and west. Eight steps cut into the plinth lead to the hall (25' \u00d7 15' \u00d7 10') which is topped by a flat masonry roof on six stone pillars. The hall all round is ornamented at the cornice especially in the west wall. It is walled in on three sides and is open to the east. The north wall has two niches and three pilasters, the south wall one niche and three pilasters and a window (4' \u00d7 3'), and the west wall has two pilasters and two niches one on either side of a door which leads into the shrine. The left niche has a rough Ganpati. Outside the roof looks continuous, but from inside it is in parts, each part being the area enclosed within four pillars and called a khan. The roof is in the old fashioned Hindu or cut-corner dome which is common in Pandharpur even in modern temples. In the middle of the hall, slightly above the surrounding pavement, a round slab called rangshila bears the following inscription in Marathi:\n\nThe temple was begun on the dark seventh of Ka'tik (October-November) in Shat 1686 (A.D. 1744) in the cycle year Rakta'kshi by Sha'mjipant Na'divkar son of Anant, (his) wife Gopika'ba'i, daughter Bahma'ba'i and his nephews Sada'shiv and Ganga'dhar Viththal. Finished by Gajendra Moreshvar Yashvant.\n\nA small door 4' 4\" high by 2' 4\" wide opens into the shrine. Round the lower half of the masonry door frame are roughly carved figures of R\u00e1dha holding snakes high overhead; figures of two cowherds Krishna's companions holding maces; two representations of a fight between a lion and an elephant in which the elephant is worsted; two figures of the saint Bhringarishi as a man with horns squatting on his knees; and the mythical bird Gandbahiri with two necks and two beaks but one body, each beak holding a garland or string of pearls. The shrine, which is nine feet square and ten feet high, is on a lower level than the hall. Its floor is paved to allow of its being washed, the dirty water passing by a hole in the back wall. The room has to be lighted by an oil lamp even during the day. The image of Gop\u00e1lkrishna is about three feet high and stands on a stone pedestal about three feet from the floor. A wooden bar set across the room, three to three and a half feet from the ground, separates the image from ordinary visitors. The god has two hands which hold a flute as if in the act of playing. He stands on the left foot, the right foot crossing it and resting on the toes. On either side of Gop\u00e1lkrishna is the figure of a fan-holding milkmaid and below are the figures of a cow and calf. All appear carved out of one stone. Behind Gop\u00e1lkrishna are two niches in the west wall, and smaller niches in the north and south walls. Near the south-east corner is the opening of a passage now blocked which by five steps leads down to a pit about six feet deep and plastered all round. At the bottom of the cell is a smaller passage about seven feet deep probably to serve as a place of refuge in troubled times.1\n\n1 The priest's account of the passage is that it leads to an underground path which opens into the wall built by the god's favourite one K\u00e1nup\u00e1tra in Mangalvedha in the S\u00e1ngli state, about twelve miles south-east of Pandharpur. The god used to visit K\u00e1nup\u00e1tra by night after the last bed-waving or shej\u00e1rti and used to return before three in the morning for the dawn wick-waving or k\u00e1kud\u00e1rti.\nmortar and is rather short. It is in three tiers star-shaped at the base. The lowest tier consists of a row of elephants many of which are broken; the middle tier contains globes at the four corners, mostly out of repair; and the top tier has small niches with figures of saints and some forms of Vishnu. All the figures are damaged by weather and apparently by Musalm\u00e1n or other image breakers. At the top is a big globe surmounted by a gilt brass peak. The god is worshipped twice a day. The morning service includes the wick-waving or k\u00e1kad\u00e1rti with songs corresponding to the early morning service in Vithoba\u2019s temple, followed by the morning worship or puja corresponding to the puja in Vithoba\u2019s temple. The morning worship includes the usual washing, dressing, sandal-marking, rice-sticking, incense-burning, camphor-waving, and food-offering. No hymns or verses are recited as the ministrant is a Gurav. The evening worship also consists of two services, the incense-waving or dhup\u00e1rti and the bed-waving or shej\u00e1rti corresponding to similar services in Vithoba\u2019s temple; but, as in the morning, they follow each other in immediate succession. In the incense-waving the priest washes the feet of the image, removes the sandal paste, wipes the face, applies fresh sandal, and, if flowers are available, throws them over the image and then waves a burning incense stick and camphor to the accompaniment of songs. This is at once followed by more light-waving accompanied by further songs.\n\nThe only holiday is the Gokulashtami the birthday of Krishna on the dark eighth of Shr\u00e1van in July-August. On this day new clothes are put on the image, and the priests give a feast, and distribute powder containing pounded ginger, sugar, grated cocoa-kernel, and poppy seed. On this day visitors flock by hundreds and each visitor places a copper at the feet of the image, makes a bow, and retires. On the \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or June-July and K\u00e1rtik or October-November full-moons large numbers attend. These gatherings have nothing to do with the worship of the god, but, after the k\u00e1la ceremony, most people visit this temple. These three days are the only days when the Gurav priests, who are of seven families with thirteen male members, make any income. According to their own account the Guravs have been the worshippers for the last four or five generations. They are Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s by caste; and their joint yearly income is about \u00a310 (Rs. 100). A yearly Government grant of 4s. (Rs. 2) is also paid between the 1st and the 25th of July.\n\nMah\u00e1dev or Bhimakr\u00e1j\u2019s temple lies in the same enclosure to the north of Gop\u00e1lkrishna\u2019s of which except for the spire and the absence of ornament in the hall it is an exact copy. The stone walls are whitewashed. In front of the temple is a small porch (7\u2019 \u00d7 7\u2019) with two sitting stone bulls about 1\u2019 5\u201d high one of them broken. In the hall are two lings, one (2\u2019 3\u201d \u00d7 1\u2019 4\u201d \u00d7 1\u2019 6\u201d) set in a niche in the west wall, and the other (3\u2019 10\u201d \u00d7 2\u2019 6\u201d \u00d7 1\u2019 7\u201d) on the pavement at the north-west corner. The chief ling in the shrine, which is three feet long two feet broad and two feet three inches high, is covered with a hollow brass mask representing Bhimakr\u00e1j the father of Krishna\u2019s wife Rukmini; a cobra coil encircles the mask, and the open cobra hood shades the head. There are two small niches in the back or south wall\nof the shrine, one small niche in the east wall and a large niche in the west wall, the last for the last day's flowers. The temple spire is star-shaped and uniform throughout up to the pinnacle. The spire is in three tiers each with niches and broken figures of saints or rishis. In the topmost tier are nine globes surmounted by a large globe at the top. There is no brass pinnacle. The whole is dark and weather-beaten. The service of the god is performed by the Guravs of Gop\u00e1lkrishna. The daily services are exactly alike, and follow those in Gop\u00e1lkrishna's temple. The yearly income is about \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15). Those who visit the temple of Gop\u00e1lkrishna afterwards come to this temple and lay down their offerings, usually a copper or a handful of rice or jv\u00e1ri.\n\nLakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan's temple to the east of Mah\u00e1dev's temple on a plinth four feet high is a ruined hut about twelve feet square. It has a tiled roof very shaky in parts. In the middle is an old n\u00edm tree by the side of which is a joint stone figure of Lakshmi-N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, including its pedestal 1' 10\" high and carved out of one stone. N\u00e1r\u00e1yan's or the male figure is seated, the right foot hanging low, and on his left thigh sits Lakshmi. The god has four arms the upper pair holding the wheel and conch in the right and left hands; the right lower arm rests on his thigh and the left lower arm is round Lakshmi's neck. In front of the image is a pair of rock-cut sandals. The worship of this temple takes place in the morning and evening along with that of Gop\u00e1lkrishna by the same Guravs.\n\nN\u00e1rad's temple is a small dingy room (10' \u00d7 8') in the east cloisters facing Gop\u00e1lkrishna's temple. N\u00e1rad's image is three feet high and seated cross-legged. The right hand holds a lute and the left a pair of cymbals; the head is bare, showing a toplock and round it a rosary of rudr\u00e1ksh beads. In the north wall in a niche is a mutilated four-armed figure of K\u00e1lbhairav of which only the upper half is left. The right pair holds a sword and a tabor and the left a begging bowl and a trident. In a niche in the south wall is set a stone cobra with open hood. The service of this temple is at the same time as that of Gop\u00e1lkrishna's.\n\nClose to the south-east of Gop\u00e1lkrishna's temple is the cell of Jan\u00e1b\u00e1i a devotee of Vithoba. From outside it looks a square masonry platform with a tulsi plant in the middle. There are really two platforms, a smaller one (5' 8\" \u00d7 5' 8\" \u00d7 7\") above a larger one (9' \u00d7 9' \u00d7 3' 8\") and both surmounted by a tulsi pillar. At the north-east corner of the lower platform an opening 2' 9\" high by 2' wide leads by six steep stone steps to an outer anteroom (9' \u00d7 6') varying in height from eight feet at the entrance to six in the western half. Near the bottom of the staircase on the left a door (2' 6\" \u00d7 2') in the east wall of the cell opens into a small chamber (4' \u00d7 3' \u00d7 5') which is said to have been Jan\u00e1b\u00e1i's cooking room. In the south wall of the anteroom a doorway (2' 8\" \u00d7 1' 10\") leads into an inner chamber (7' \u00d7 5' \u00d7 6'). In this chamber close to the east wall of the cell is a cot said to be (4' 6\" \u00d7 3' \u00d7 7\") the cot of Jan\u00e1b\u00e1i. In the open half of the cot, on a stone pedestal is a black stone image of Vithoba\n\n---\n\n1 This cot is not the original cot belonging to the celebrated devotee Jan\u00e1b\u00e1i. It is made in native fashion and half covered by old tape to make it look old.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nPandharpur.\n\nTemples.\n\n(2' 4\") and a woman's image (2') which is said to be Jan\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed. On the cot lies an old quilt which is said to belong to Jan\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed.\n\nAccording to an inscription the temple of Gop\u00e1lkrishna was built in A.D. 1744 by Anant Sh\u00e1mji D\u00e1bhd\u00e9 of Talegaon. The temple of Mah\u00e1dev and the cloisters and enclosure were built by Parshur\u00e1m Angal the famous S\u00e1t\u00e1ra banker and temple builder. The temple of Lakshmi-N\u00e1r\u00e1yan was built about 1865 by one D\u00e1t\u00e1r at a cost of \u00a36 (Rs. 60). Jan\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed's cell is said to have been built at the same time as Gop\u00e1lkrishna's temple. The rest-houses outside and the temple to the north were built by the municipality in 1865-66. The story of the temple of Gop\u00e1lkrishna is that Gop\u00e1lkrishna or Krishna had 16,000 milkmaids and eight wives, who, out of respect to Rukmini the chief favourite, used to stand whenever she appeared. One day while he was living in Dw\u00e1rka, Krishna sat amusing himself with R\u00e1dha one of the eight favourites, who was sitting on his thigh. Rukmini suddenly came in, but remained standing unheeded; and R\u00e1dha elated with Krishna's attention offended Rukmini by not rising. Taking this to heart, Rukmini left Dw\u00e1rka and came to Dindirvan now known as Pandharpur, and sat near the site of the present temple. When Krishna found that Rukmini had left him, he started in search of her with his cattle and cowherds. The mountain of Govardhan in Dw\u00e1rka learning that Krishna was leaving, not caring to remain without the god, followed and forms the knoll on which the temple is built. The river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna also followed the party and settled in Dindirvan, Ganga as the Bhima now called Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 or Bh\u00e1girathi, and Yamuna as the Pushp\u00e1vati. When Rukmini and Gop\u00e1lkrishna made friends they held a feast on the hillock along with their companions each bringing his own food. This gathering or feasting called k\u00e1l\u00e1 or the mixture is said to have happened twice in Pandharpur; first on the full-moon of \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or June-July the day on which they arrived and again on the full-moon of K\u00e1rtik or October-November on which Krishna is believed to have died. In Pandharpur k\u00e1l\u00e1s are often held especially during the rainy months. The thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of the tenth section of the Bh\u00e1gvat Pur\u00e1n tell how Krishna called this social gathering. When this chapter is read at Pandharpur the people throw in the air quantities of parched maize and then eat it, in imitation of the picnic of Krishna and the milkmen. For the same reason the Bady\u00e1s dine together in Shr\u00e1van or July-August in Vithoba's temple and in Gop\u00e1lpur different bands of pilgrims in different places hold k\u00e1l\u00e1s during the \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or June-July and the K\u00e1rtik or October-November fairs. The headman reads a few verses from the Bh\u00e1gvat Pur\u00e1n suitable to the occasion, and an earthen pot of parched maize mixed with curds hung from the branch of a tree is broken by a stone and the contents are scrambled for and mixed with large quantities of parched maize. A somewhat similar ceremony called Govardhan sometimes takes place during the reading of the Bh\u00e1gvat in which it is described. On this occasion parched maize is mixed with curds heaped into a mound like the Govardhan hill and in the heap branches of wild trees are fixed. Before the mountain are laid the usual offerings, and the people present eat up the hill.\nOn Datta\u2019s steps or landing about 2000 feet south of Chandrabh\u00e1ga\u2019s temple, is Datta\u2019s, Datt\u00e1traya\u2019s, or V\u00edpra\u2019s Math, a temple though called a monastery. Between it and Chandrabh\u00e1ga\u2019s temple the bank has a parapet wall built by the last Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v (1796-1817), and the road along these temples which is used by pilgrims for the circuit is paved with flag stones. The temple is the front or east half of a large building with two quadrangles. The front half is seven feet above the road, and the plinth of the building is 2' 6\" higher. The front of the building has a paved quadrangle (32' x 25') in the middle with rows of open verandas all round. In the west veranda is the temple shrine. These verandas are occasionally used by ascetics and often by pilgrims and the owners, who come for the \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or June-July and the K\u00e1rtik or October-November fairs. The verandas are like cloisters though they are not built for cloister purposes, and in every respect resemble good ordinary dwellings. The quadrangle which is generally used for devotional singing and music is open, and has trellis work on the top which is covered with thick cloth. The shrine is 8' 3\" square and ten feet high, and the door (4' 10\" x 2' 5\") is set in wooden trellis work. The shutters are also of trellis work. In this chamber, close to the west wall, is a standing black stone image of Datt\u00e1traya nearly five feet high exclusive of the pedestal which is two feet high. The image, which is well carved out of a single stone and is highly polished, was made in Pandharpur in A.D. 1808. The features and other parts of the body are better carved than those of any other image in the town. The image has traces of a loincloth and a sacred thread and rosary round the neck. It has six arms, the lowest right hand holding a short rosary and a club, the middle hand a tabor and the upper a wheel, and the lowest left hand a bowl, the middle a trident, and the upper a conch shell. On the head is a crown; and in the ears are fishes. The chamber is built of well dressed stone and the roof is a somewhat squat dome. Besides the entrance door a small door in the south wall leads to a cookroom and is used by the priest in bringing the god\u2019s food. The god is treated with unusual respect, and not even the Br\u00e1hman priest is allowed to enter the shrine unless he has bathed and is dressed in a silk waistcloth. In the north wall is a small masonry pond and a small niche. In the pond water is stored for washing the temple at the end of the \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or June-July and K\u00e1rtik or October-November fairs and on the full-moon of M\u00e1rghshirsh in November-December. Two daily services are held in the morning and in the evening. The morning service takes place at about eight or nine. The image is uncovered washed and dried, sandal-paste is rubbed on the forehead, flower garlands are thrown round the neck, burning camphor and incense sticks are waved, and food is offered. The image is dressed in a waistcloth and shouldercloth with a scarf round the head. The evening service, about eight or nine, consists of wiping away the sandal-paste mark, removing the morning flowers, washing the feet, rubbing fresh sandal paste, throwing garlands of fresh flowers, burning camphor and incense sticks, and waving a light to the accompaniment of songs. On Thursdays the morning worship is as usual and in the evening is another worship like that in the morning. The image is washed twice on that day and twice worshipped followed\nby a light-waving. The great days are the Ash\u00e1dh or June-July and K\u00e1rtik or October-November Elevenths and the full-moon of M\u00e1rgshirsh or November-December. On these days the image is bathed in the five nectars curds, milk, honey, clarified butter, and sugar which are rubbed over it, and, after washing it with water, a stream of water is allowed to fall over the image for two or three hours in the abhishek or bathing fashion while texts or mantras are recited by the attendant priests. The usual offerings are made, Br\u00e1hmans are feasted, each Br\u00e1hman receiving 3d. to 6d. (2-4 as.) in cash. Formerly, on the evening of the M\u00e1rgshirsh or November-December full-moon, a torchlight procession in which the sandals of the god were carried in a palanquin used to take place, but it has stopped since 1880. The god\u2019s every-day dress is a gold-bordered scarf and a couple of silk-bordered waistcloths of which one is tied round his waist and the other wrapped round the shoulder. Once a year on the M\u00e1rgshirsh or November-December full-moon the owner of the temple presents the god with a new suit of clothes, and wraps round his head a shawl instead of the usual scarf. The temple priest, who is engaged by the proprietors, belongs to a S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Deshasth family. In return for his services he takes the offerings which are worth about \u00a312 (Rs. 120) a year. No regular devotional sermons or Pur\u00e1n readings are held. But when the owner comes to Pandharpur for the Ash\u00e1dh or June-July and the K\u00e1rtik or October-November fairs he lodges in the temple and holds sermons or songs daily. The story of the temple is that a Br\u00e1hman named P\u00e1ndurang, an ancestor of the present owner, in a dream saw the god Datt\u00e1traya who told him to build a temple in his honour, telling him that if he went to a certain pipal tree in Jamkhandi he would find ample material to make an image. The man found a slab of stone under a pipal and had it carved into shape. The image was finished, put in a niche, and the niche closed for a year. During this time a peculiar sound came from the niche and the god again appeared to him and warned him not to wait longer. The temple was built and the image set in its present position. Two tombs in a room near the shrine are said to mark the graves of P\u00e1ndurang and his son N\u00e1r\u00e1yan.\n\nThe chief elements in the holiness of Pandharpur are the worship of Vithoba and to a less degree of the Bhima. Round these have gathered a host of rites and observances. Within Pandharpur limits, perhaps from the crescent shape of its course, the Bhima has been given the classical name Chandrabh\u00e1ga. Within Pandharpur limits its water is believed to have sin-purifying powers and numbers of pilgrims carry it away in carefully closed narrow-necked copper vessels. A shr\u00e1ddha or mind-rite has been prescribed for the banks of the river, though, according to the sacred books, no mind-rites should be performed on a river which does not fall directly into the sea. These, the gift of a cow, and visits to the Gop\u00e1lpur, Padm\u00e1vati, and other temples, are the chief duties which engage the pilgrim\u2019s attention during his stay at Pandharpur.\n\nBesides Koli and Gurav ministrants in many of Mah\u00e1dev\u2019s temples Pandharpur has two classes of Br\u00e1hman priests, Badv\u00e1s or the local temple priests and Bhats or adopted aliens chiefly Deshasth\nBr\u00e1hmans. The Badv\u00e1s are the priests of the god Vithoba and the goddess Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed and have a right to all the offerings made in the great temple.\u00b9 The Bhats have no connection with the temple and are all outsiders. Most of them came to Pandharpur during the time of the last Peshwa (1796-1817) when Pandharpur was in high favour and the regular temple priests or Badv\u00e1s were so well off that they left the river-side and other outdoor ceremonies to Deshasth Bhats.\n\nThe following table shows that during the nine years ending 1884 an average of 165,774 pilgrims visited Pandharpur:\n\n| Year | Chaitri Fair in March-April | Ashadhi Fair in June-July | Kartiki Fair in October-November | Total |\n|------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------|\n| 1876 | 17,200                      | 87,000                    | 30,000                           | 134,200 |\n| 1877 | 12,653                      | 50,503                    | 42,000                           | 105,156 |\n| 1878 | 16,460                      | 61,000                    | 34,000                           | 111,460 |\n| 1879 | 14,931                      | 106,293                   | 49,933                           | 133,102 |\n| 1880 | 20,478                      | 114,706                   | 65,000                           | 200,184 |\n| 1881 | 22,359                      | 106,697                   | 62,349                           | 191,405 |\n| 1882 | 24,709                      | 114,638                   | 70,630                           | 219,777 |\n| 1883 | 24,449                      | 107,764                   | 57,555                           | 189,768 |\n| 1884 | 26,115                      | 106,036                   | 77,747                           | 209,597 |\n\nEvery pilgrim must employ a Kshetra-up\u00e1dhy\u00e1 or local priest either a Badva or a Bhat. Unless the priest is himself a Badva he must, at least for Vithoba\u2019s worship, engage a Badva, and for Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed\u2019s worship he must engage an Utp\u00e1t priest of that goddess. Thus, except when a Badva does double duty, every pilgrim has three priests, a Kshetra-up\u00e1dhy\u00e1 for river-side worship and ceremonies, a Badva for Vithoba\u2019s worship, and an Utp\u00e1t for Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed\u2019s worship. These classes of priests number altogether about 600 families, of whom only some of those connected with the temple are well-to-do. They live in old dingy houses, handsome outside but closely packed without much light or air. As at Benares Gaya and N\u00e1sik, to guard against mistakes, and prevent their patrons leaving them in favour of a rival, each family of priests keeps a record of its patrons. This record, which in some cases goes back more than 150 years, is very detailed. It is kept in the form of a ledger, and contains letters signed by each patron giving his name and address, stating that on a certain date he visited Pandharpur as a pilgrim, and enjoining any member of his family and his descendants who may visit Pandharpur to employ the owner of the book as his priest.\u00b2 Several of the well-to-do priestly families have ponderous ledgers with indexes filling two or three large volumes. The indexes are arranged alphabetically\n\n\u00b9 See above p. 425. The Badv\u00e1s are said to have the peculiar custom of shaving the bride\u2019s head before marriage. This seems a trace of the practice of dedicating to the god all the daughters of the priests.\n\n\u00b2 The patron\u2019s letter usually runs: \u2018To the learned and godlike Narsu R\u00e1mchandra of the holy town of Pandharpur. I Govind \u00c1p\u00e1ji son of \u00c1p\u00e1ji Balwant, resident of Ahmadnagar, after most respectful greeting, say that on the 12th (day) of Jyesht of the Samvat year 1872 I came to Pandhari and worshipped the god. My kinsmen and friends, whenever they come hereafter, shall acknowledge and worship you. Be this known to you. (Date and signature).\u2019 In the case of Bh\u00e1tia patrons the record is more detailed and gives the names of all the living relations of the pilgrim on the father\u2019s side.\naccording to the names of the patrons and according to the names of the places where they live.\n\nEither on alighting at the B\u00e1rsi Road station, or about two miles from Pandharpur, where, in sight of the pinnacle of Vithoba\u2019s temple, the god\u2019s feet are carved on a block of stone, or on the outskirts of the town, pilgrims are met by priests or their agents.\\(^1\\) Almost every one of them declares that he has a record of some of the pilgrim\u2019s ancestors or kinsmen, and a record of their visit to Pandharpur acknowledging him as their priest. Pilgrims who do not expect such a greeting are generally bewildered and confused. If the pilgrim is wary he ignores these attentions and declarations, and insists on seeing the record. Many of the priests slink away. But some of them, knowing that most pilgrims are eager for shelter for aged relations or young children, while admitting they cannot produce the records, boldly declare that the pilgrim\u2019s priest is dead and that no member of his family remains. Most of the priests, who well know the value of each other\u2019s aid, support the man\u2019s statements and the pilgrim then accepts as his priest the first man who accosted him. During his patron\u2019s stay the priest takes care that he should not come to know he has been imposed on and with this view many priests keep their patrons in virtual confinements until the ceremonies are performed.\n\nAs soon as the pinnacle of Vithoba\u2019s temple comes in sight, the pilgrim stops, and throws himself on the ground in honour of the god. Some pilgrims, who have taken a vow to that effect, continue to prostrate till they reach the town, or throw themselves at full length on the ground making a mark ahead of them as far as their hands can reach, then rise, walk up to the mark, again prostrate themselves, and so in this way reach the holy city. Some pilgrims roll on the ground all the way from B\u00e1rsi Road (31 miles) or Jeur (45 miles). Cases are said to have occurred of pilgrims rolling from Benares N\u00e1gpur and Haidarabad in fulfilment of vows. On the 6th of August 1813, when on his way from Pandharpur to Poona, Mr. Elphinstone met a servant of Chimn\u00e1ji \u00c1ppa who was rolling from Poona to Pandharpur in performance of a vow which he had made in order to get a child. He had been a month at it and had grown so expert that he went on smoothly and without pausing and kept rolling evenly along the middle of the road over stones and other obstacles. He travelled at the rate of four miles (two kos) a day.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn reaching Pandharpur the pilgrim is generally provided with board and lodging at his priest\u2019s. If the priest has too many patrons, to provide for all, he hires houses, furnishes them with cooking vessels, and, in the case of rich patrons, he keeps one of his men to get them food, to show them the chief sights, and generally to attend on them, the priest visiting his patron on occasions of ceremony or whenever he is required.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) During the pilgrim season (June-November) or when they hear that their patrons are coming, some priests go to receive their rich patrons as far as Poona, Bombay, and Haidarabad.\n\n\\(^2\\) Colebrooke\u2019s Elphinstone, I, 257-258; compare Ind. Ant, XI, 153.\nPilgrims may be divided into two classes, regular visitors and occasional visitors. The regular visitors, who are called V\u00e1rkaris or time-keepers, come under two heads, those who attend every month and those who attend twice every year at the two great fairs in July and in November. The occasional visitors come almost entirely from Kh\u00e1ndesh Ber\u00e1r and the north, from Haidarabad and from Goa. They mostly attend at the two great fairs.\n\nThe V\u00e1rkaris or time-keeping pilgrims form an important sect whose beliefs are strongly opposed to Br\u00e1hman exclusiveness. The faith is simple and appeals to the lower classes to whom most of its followers belong. So catholic is the sect that some of its members are Muhammedans. The V\u00e1rkari sect was founded by the Br\u00e1hman Dny\u00e1neshvar who lived about the end of the thirteenth century. The great devotee contented himself with visiting Pandharpur, and did not try to make converts. For three centuries after Dny\u00e1neshvar\u2019s death no attempt seems to have been made to organize the sect. This was done in the beginning of the seventeenth century by the great V\u00e1ni poet and devotee Tuk\u00e1ram (1608-1649) who popularised the worship of Vithoba. Tuk\u00e1ram is said to have begun to take an active part in the spread of Vithoba\u2019s worship after a dream in which his teacher or guru B\u00e1b\u00e1ji, a descendant of Keshavchaitanya and R\u00e1ghavchaitanya, appeared and enjoined him to repeat the words R\u00e1m Krishna Hari at the beginning of all his devotions. Tuk\u00e1ram took this as a hint that he ought to proselytise. Nothing was done in Tuka\u2019s lifetime, but his followers made many disciples, and the V\u00e1rkari sect was greatly strengthened. For a time Tuka\u2019s disciples worked together. Later on the sect split into two main divisions, Dehukar and V\u00e1skar, which still remain. The Dehukars get their name from Dehu thirty miles north-west of Poona the birthplace of Tuk\u00e1ram and the V\u00e1skars get their name from V\u00e1shi in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s dominions. The most noted V\u00e1skar was Malappa whose tomb is at \u00c1landi in Poona. Both divisions claim to be the direct spiritual descendants of Tuk\u00e1ram, and both claim to possess the identical lute or vina on which Tuka used to play in holding his religious services. Both divisions have numerous followers, and their religious rites are almost the same. Nine observances are binding on all V\u00e1rkaris. Every V\u00e1rkari must come to Pandharpur for the great elevenths of \u00c1sh\u00e1dth or June-July and K\u00e1rtik or October-November and for the other monthly elevenths which are technically called v\u00e1r\u00eds. The V\u00e1rkari must come on the tenth or previous day and bathe in the Bhima. To comply with this rule V\u00e1rkari inhabitants of Pandharpur go a mile or two out of the city on the evening of the ninth and return on the morning of the tenth and bathe in the river. While or after bathing every V\u00e1rkari must dip his banner or pat\u00faka into the river, and, taking water in his right palm, drink it as holy water or tirth. He must then visit the temple of Vithoba and make the round or pradakshina of the town. At night he must attend a meeting of the sect of V\u00e1rkaris to which he belongs. V\u00e1rkaris have no initiation or gur\u00fapadesh. This peculiarity, which is found in almost no other Hind\u00fa sect, sets all the members on an unusually equal footing. Any person anxious to be a V\u00e1rkari goes to the headman of the sect to which he wishes to belong and tells him his\nwish. Except that the eleventh or ek\u00e1dashi are the luckiest days, a man may join the sect on any day or hour. The candidate brings a necklace or rosary of basil or tulsi beads and an ochre-coloured swallowtailed banner. The headman orders the candidate to lay the rosary on Dny\u00e1nesvar\u2019s great book, the Dny\u00e1neshwari, which is kept in a niche in every V\u00e1rkari monastery. He is then told to take up the rosary and put it round his neck. The candidate falls at the feet of the headman who repeats the salutation. The only advice given to the candidate is regularly to visit Pandharpur on the first eleventh, and, if possible, on the second eleventh, of all months.\n\nA rule which is strongly impressed on every V\u00e1rkari candidate is that he cannot serve two masters. He cannot serve Vithoba so long as he serves the Mammon of worldly rivalries and cares. He is also told that to serve Vithoba well he must be poor, as Vithoba dwells with the poor and lowly. For all bodily ailments a V\u00e1rkari must use no medicine but the water of the Bhima and the tulsi leaves of the garland round Vithoba\u2019s neck. No V\u00e1rkari can begin to eat a meal without first drinking holy water or tirth which is of two kinds the washings of Vithoba and the water of the Bhima. Vithoba\u2019s washings are to be had only while the V\u00e1rkari is in Pandharpur. The water of the Bhima he carries in dry hollow gourds and uses very sparingly, though he can rarely run short of it as a few drops of Bhima water make holy a hogshead of other water. If ever his stock runs short, he must borrow from some other V\u00e1rkari. One of the chief V\u00e1rkari tenets is that to take life is sin. Flesh eaters must forego flesh if they become V\u00e1rkaris. Every V\u00e1rkari, however sick he may be, should keep a strict fast on all lunar elevenths. He should watch and sing hymns during the nights of the elevenths. While in Pandharpur the V\u00e1rkari should bathe daily in the Bhima. A V\u00e1rkari is not allowed to read any books but the following ten, Amrit\u00e1nubhav, Bh\u00e1v\u00e1rth R\u00e1m\u00e1yan, Dny\u00e1nesvar\u2019s Abhangs, Dny\u00e1neshwari, Ekn\u00e1th\u2019s Abhangs, Ekn\u00e1th\u2019s Bh\u00e1gvat, Hast\u00e1malak, N\u00e1md\u00e9v\u2019s Abhangs, Rukmini Svayamvar, and Tuk\u00e1ram\u2019s Abhangs.\n\nA strict low caste V\u00e1rkari believes only in Vithoba. He keeps no religious rites, ignores caste distinctions, and leads a poverty-stricken life in which a high disdain for every-day duties blends with an intense yearning for Pandharpur and Vithoba and for the excited night preachings on the great days. Br\u00e1hman and other high caste V\u00e1rkaris do not so completely give up everything for Vithoba. Something of their pride of birth and pride of life remains and also something of their scepticism. They will allow Vithoba to be the chief but not to be the only god. There are also Vaishnav, Sm\u00e1rt, Bh\u00e1gvat, R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj, Kabirpanthi, and Viththalpanthi V\u00e1rkaris. The Vaishnav V\u00e1rkaris may be known by their three upright brow lines, a black between two white gopichandan or white clay and sandal-paste lines. They worship Vishnu and fast on all lunar elevenths. The Sm\u00e1rt V\u00e1rkaris may be known by their two or three level brow lines of ashes and sandal-paste. They hold Shiv to be higher than Vishnu and fast on all dark thirteenth or Shivr\u00e1t\u00e1s. The Bh\u00e1gvat V\u00e1rkaris may be known by their brow marks of gopichandan or white clay in the morning and ashes in the evening. They worship Vishnu but fast like Sm\u00e1rts on the dark thirteenth and dark eleventh. All\nthese V\u00e1rkaris mark their arms cheeks and temples with the conch, lotus, mace, and discus of Vishnu.\n\nThe R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj and Kabirpanthi V\u00e1rkaris are of four sub-divisions, Garuds who apply a yellow mark to their brows, Lakshmis who apply a red mark, Sanak\u00e1diks who apply a white sandal-mark, and Sheshas who apply a black mark. R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj and Kabirpanthi V\u00e1rkaris mark their temples with the discus. Besides being less strict they differ in two main points from ordinary V\u00e1rkaris. They keep the ear initiation or k\u00e1nmantra and they wear a short rosary with a double string of beads close round the neck instead of the long 108-bead rosary of the regular V\u00e1rkaris which falls to the middle of the chest. Viththalpanthis differ from the R\u00e1m\u00e1nujs and Kabirpanthis in having a conch shell mark on their right and a discus mark on the left temple.\n\nV\u00e1rkari doctrines are in practice even stronger caste-levellers than Ling\u00e1yat doctrines. In spite of some traces of pride of birth an ordinary Br\u00e1hman V\u00e1rkari who is not a R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj, Kabirpanthi, or Viththalpanthi, will not hesitate to fall at the feet of a Shudra V\u00e1rkari who has a name in the sect for devotion or for power as a preacher. The Br\u00e1hman V\u00e1rkari sits in a line with Shudra V\u00e1rkaris removed by only a short distance and does not object to be served by the same man who serves the Shudras. The V\u00e1rkari preachings of equality find willing hearers among the Deccan Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s who in peace as in war have always a hankering after equality. During the recent century of Br\u00e1hman rule (1714-1818), apparently the only time during the last 2000 years when Br\u00e1hmans united political and religious power in the Deccan, this enthusiasm for Vithoba and disregard for caste were a valuable counterpoise to Br\u00e1hman domineering.\n\nAmong the lower classes the devotion and love for the darling Vithoba, for whom their yearning seems the yearning of a parent for a beloved child, the strongest and the highest of Hindu affections, shows no sign of growing cold. On reaching Pandharpur the pilgrim\u2019s first care is to visit the temple of Vithoba and gain a sight or darshan of the god. Though it literally means a sight or view, in practice the darshan includes embracing the god, laying the head on the god\u2019s feet, waving money, laying money in front of the god, dressing the god\u2019s neck with a flower garland and tulsi leaves, and offering him a cocoanut or sugar and incense. Till this is done the pilgrim has no rest. To most of them the sight of Vithoba is their dearest hope in life. They beam with joy as they leave the temple, their longing to throw their arms round the beloved knees at last satisfied.\n\n1 Another minor point of difference is that round the neck of Br\u00e1hman candidates the tulsi rosary is tied by their fathers and not by the sect headmen as among the other V\u00e1rkaris.\n\n2 The enthusiasm for Vithoba is one of the most notable feelings among the Hindus of the Bombay Deccan. The intensity of the feeling which moves to tears even cold English-taught agnostics is probably due to the exciting influence of a crowd swayed by one feeling. The ground of the yearning and love for Vithoba is not so easy to find. What has Vithoba done for them that the people should love him so kindly and so purely? The answer seems to be though it apparently is not consciously true.\nThe money waved in front of the god is usually a \u00bc anna (\u00bdd.) Well-to-do pilgrims who mean to go through the full details of the worship content themselves with the usual offerings and lay about 2s. (Re.1) at Vithoba\u2019s feet.\n\nPilgrims arriving by day bathe in the river, and, after performing some ceremonies, or putting them off till the next day, go to the temple to see the god. Pilgrims arriving at night cannot go to bathe. They go straight and catch a dhul darshan or dust-glimpse of the god.\u00b9\n\nThe complete list of ceremonies begins with the Gang\u00e1bhet or meeting the Ganges, as the Bhima is here called. The pilgrim with his family if he has brought them, wearing his every-day clothes, comes to the river with the priest. The men and boys strip to the waistcloth and all stand in a row along the water\u2019s edge. The priest gives each a coconut which they take with both hands and lay in front of them. Sandal-paste, a few grains of rice, and tulsi leaves are laid near the coconut, each pilgrim making a separate offering. Except the words spoken to the river, \u2018I offer sandal-paste, I offer grains of rice, I offer tulsi leaves,\u2019 nothing is said. Then the priest says \u2018I bow, Ganga, to thy lotus feet; I bow to thee Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1.\u2019 The pilgrims enter the water to about the waist and all dip till the water covers them except the face and head. If a Br\u00e1hman man the pilgrim stands in the water after the first dip, thrice sips water from his hollow palm, and repeats the twenty-four names of the god he invokes in his daily devotion. He sprinkles water on the river and prays:\n\nCome Sun, with thy thousand rays, thou mass of glory and ruler of the world, accept this my worship, and the offering of water; I bow to thee.\n\nHe takes a little earth from the bed of the river and rubs it on his chest saying:\n\nEarth, free me from my sins and misdeeds that my sins being destroyed by thee, I may win heaven.\n\nHe makes another dip into the water and again bathes. He once more stands facing west, and taking a little cowdung from the priest he rubs it on his body saying:\n\nCowdung that belongest to the wives of bulls, who roam from forest to forest eating herbs, thou that dost cleanse the body, remove for ever all my ailments and sorrows.\n\nof the present high-class worshippers that Vithoba is the great guardian or spirit-scarer. Vithoba it is true has not so great a name as an exorcist as the Datt\u00e1traya of Narsoha\u2019s V\u00e1di in Kolh\u00e1pur or the \u00c1b\u00e1s\u00e1heb of Phaltan. Still patients suffering from spirit-attacks against whom the local guardians are powerless are sent from places as distant as Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r to Pandharpur (Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r Statistical Account, Appendix B) and the fact that the V\u00e1rkaris\u2019 one medicine is the Bhima water and Vithoba\u2019s tulsi leaves shows that they believe in Pandharpur and Vithoba as great-spirit scarers, since to the low caste Hindu all disease is spirit-caused. The fact that Br\u00e1hmans mix, even eat with men of low caste at Pandharpur, Puri, Jaggannath, and other holy places seems to have its origin (though the origin is forgotten) in the belief in the spirit-scaring power of the god and of the place. The pure Br\u00e1hman avoids the unclean flesh-eater because the Br\u00e1hman believes that his careless life makes the flesh-eater unclean that is a spirit-haunt. When the low caste or the flesh-eater comes to the holy place the power of the place or of the god drives the spirits out of him. He is pure and may be touched, even dined with. Compare Indian Antiquary, XI, 149-151.\n\n\u00b9 From dhul dust and darshan glimpse, that is a glimpse of the god straight from the road with the dust or dhul on the feet.\nHe again dips into the water, rubs ashes on his chest, and recites a Vedic hymn. While still wet the pilgrim takes water in both hands and pours it as an offering into the water, saying:\n\nIn this south-flowing Bhima on the west bank, in the holy Lohadand, in the holy town of Pandhari, near Pundlik near the holy nigal Na'ra'yan, and near the cow and the Brahman, Bhima, by thy favour guard me, who am the image of sin, a sinner among sinners, whose soul is a sinner and born in sin. Shiv, destroy my sins. To put away the miseries and sins whose source is the body, the speech, the mind, the touch of others or the neglecting to touch others, eating or refusing to eat, drinking, or refusing to drink and all small and secondary sins, to put these away I bathe in the Chandrabha'ga on this lucky day.\n\nThe pilgrim asks the priest's leave to bathe saying in Mar\u00e1thi: 'Have I leave to bathe?' the priest replies 'May you bathe well.' The pilgrim dives into the water and bathes. When a Br\u00e1hman pilgrim has his wife with him the hems of their clothes are tied in a knot before they enter the water. The wife does not rub herself with ashes, earth, and cowdung like her husband and repeats no words. She dips when he dips and bathes when he bathes. When the bathing is over, before coming out of the water and untying the knot, the wife must say her husband's name and the husband must say his wife's name. In the knot that ties the clothes the pilgrim usually fastens a pearl, a piece of coral, or a tiny bit of gold which goes to the priest. After leaving the water the pilgrims dress themselves\n\n---\n\n1 The details of this bathing ceremony, the sipping of water and the rubbing with earth, with ashes, and with cowdung, four famous spirit-scarers, and also the details of the ritual misdoings and omissions which cause sin are of great interest as examples of the early idea that sin like disease is a form of spirit possession. That those acts were sinful which, like neglecting or misdoing the spirit-scaring ritual laid the person open to spirit attacks; and that sins, being like diseases spirit-possessions, can be driven away by the great spirit-scarers water, earth, cowdung, and ashes. Though the idea that sin is a refined form of the belief in spirit-possession is more clear and widespread in the Hindu religion than in most forms of religion the idea is not confined to the Hindus. In Herefordshire and Shropshire in England in 1690 (Brand's Popular Antiquities, II. 247) when a man died an old beggar was called out of the village and made to eat a meal in front of the dead body. The old man was called the sin-eater and the object of the rite was admitted to be to keep the spirit of the dead from walking. What the old man did was to take to himself either (which was probably the root idea) the spirit of the dead or (which was probably the ordinary belief) the evil spirits which had haunted the dead man. In this case therefore sin seems to be used in the sense of spirit. The explanation of the English word sin given by Webster from the Encyclopaedia Britannica supports this view. According to this explanation sin was originally Signa or Sinna an evil spirit the wife of the ill disposed Loke. The use of the goddess's name to describe a disease caused by being possessed by the goddess seems closely to agree with the Hindu names Devi for small-pox and Mari for cholera, and with the English name Mama, the mother of the Manes, for madness. In these cases the patient is, or when the name was given was, believed to be possessed by the goddess. Further examples of the root idea of sin as spirit-possession are given below Appendix C.\n\n2 The reason why the husband repeats the wife's name and the wife the husband's name before the knot is untied is hard to give. In ordinary circumstances the wife will not mention the husband's name nor the husband the wife's, because, apparently, though this is not admitted, evil spirits and sorcerers might get to know the name and so have power to work evil on the owner of the name. The reason why before the knot-loosening here, as before the knot-loosening in the wedding ceremony, the names are mentioned is perhaps because while the knot is tied the two are one, and that to divide the parts without reminding the spirit of each to which part it belonged might cause confusion.\n\n3 The object of tying the gold, coral, or pearl into the knot is to increase the spirit-scaring power of the knot. The gold coral or pearl is given to the priest because the evil spirit is believed to have gone into the jewel and the holiness of the Br\u00e1hman,\nin dry clothes on the dry bed or bank. Some pilgrims present the priest with the clothing worn while bathing, some give him new clothes, some give money instead of clothes, and many give nothing. When the pilgrim is poor and not likely to pay, the priest generally cuts short some of the bathing details. Pilgrims who are not Br\u0101hmans do not undergo the rubbings with earth, cowdung, and ashes. In their case the first greeting to the river is the same as the greeting given by the Br\u0101hman and the pilgrim at once enters the water, the priest saying:\n\nIn this holy place on this day I shall bathe in the Chandrabha'ga to remove all sins of body and mind due to touch or caused by speech.\n\nAfter putting on fresh clothes the high-caste pilgrim and his wife sit near the water's edge and throw into the water sandal-paste, rice, flowers, sugar, and fruit. Instead of by bathing some high caste pilgrims purify themselves by eating the five nectars, clarified butter, curds, honey, milk, and cowdung and listening to the Vedic hymn called the Purushasukta. Offerings of money are made to the priest. The winnow gift or supv\u0101yan takes place only if the pilgrim has his wife with him. Any unwidowed woman can make this gift which is presented not to the priest but to the priest's wife who has to attend to receive it. The gift consists of the articles used by a woman in her toilet, robes, and ornaments. A new winnowing fan is brought, and the following articles are laid on it, a robe or a piece of bodice cloth, five to ten glass bangles, a couple of silver toe-rings worn on the fourth toes, two pairs of toe-rings of bellmetal worn on the second toes, a cocoanut, two small wooden boxes with turmeric and redpowder, a comb, a small looking glass, a necklace of black glass beads, a few almonds or plantains, some rice or wheat, and a packet of betel-leaves. Another winnowing fan is put over it upside down as a cover. The two winnowing fans with their contents are set in front of the female pilgrim after she has bathed and put on dry clothes. The pilgrim pours water over his wife's right palm and then sprinkles a little turmeric and redpowder over the winnowing fan. The pilgrim's wife offers the priest's wife a little turmeric and redpowder to rub on her cheeks and brow, and, taking the fan and covering it with the hem of her robe, and with it giving 3\u00bd. to 1s. (2 - 8 as.) in money, hands it to the priest's wife while the priest says, in the name of the pilgrim's wife:\n\nMay the Eternal be pleased to free me (the pilgrim's wife) from the horrors of hell. I give you Ganga wife of Narsu this fan with money and a packet of betel-leaves.\n\nThe pilgrim, who all the while is sitting by the side of his wife adds the words 'Accept' and the priest replies 'I take.' Many pil-\n\nthe fire that burns in his right hand, overcomes the evil spirit. It is because they are spirit-possessed that the accepting of many kinds of offerings by Br\u0101hmans is counted a sin. The belief that the evil spirit goes into the jewel or other spirit-scaring article is confusing. The idea that the spirit goes into the article offered belongs not to the early or scaring but to the later or pleasing stage of worship, when, by the help of guardian worship the idea that offerings are made to please the spirit drove out the earlier and ruder scaring idea. At present the idea that the spirit enters into the article offered seems universal among Hindus. It is the belief even in cases of exorcism, the earliest of rites, even though in exorcism the object clearly is to scare not to please.\ngrims, though willing to make the winnow gift, omit to buy the articles and tell the priest to get the winnow fully or partly filled according to the amount he is ready to pay. The cost varies from 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) to 6d. (4 as.). A poor or a thrifty pilgrim will not allow the priest to put a robe or other costly article on the fan. The priest takes the conduct of the pilgrim in the matter of the fan as a guide for the future. He will be careful not to waste too much ritual and too many prayers on the poor or the miserly.\n\nThe next gift usually made by a poor pilgrim is the god\u00e1n or the cow-gift. The pilgrim seldom gives a cow. The priest tells what merit flows from the gift of a cow. He has generally a cow and a calf at home. They are brought and the pilgrim pays the Br\u00e1hman 1s. to 4s. (Rs. \u00bd - 2), and sometimes as much as \u00a31 (Rs. 10). Before the cow-gift the priest says:\n\nOn this lucky day to gain the benefits described in the Vedas and the Pur\u00e1s and that this pilgrimage to Pandhari may be successful, I make the gift of a cow according to my abilities, either in the shape of money or a cow with a calf.\n\nIf no cow is present the pilgrim pouring water on his right palm at the end of these words proceeds to worship the priest, and continues:\n\n\"I bow to thee! oh Anant or Vishnu, who hast a thousand images, a thousand feet, eyes, heads, chests and shoulders, who hast a thousand names and who art eternal and who hast outlived crores of eras, I bow to thee.\"\n\nThe pilgrim then gives the money to the priest, and while giving it says the same words as were used at the time of making the winnow gift except that the word cow-gift takes the place of the word winnow-gift. Then the pilgrim says 'Accept' and the priest answers 'I take.' If the cow is actually present with the calf, she is worshipped, and four silver hoofs each worth 6d to 2s. (Re. \u00bc - 1) are touched against the cow's hoofs and two small gold horns, each worth 10s. (Rs. 5), against her horns and all are laid before her. A small copper saddle is set on her back and a bell is tied round her neck. Her udder is touched with a brass pot and the pot is laid in front of her. In worshipping the cow the usual articles are laid before her including some jvari which she at once eats. After worship the pilgrim goes thrice round the cow while the priest says:\n\nAll the sins and misdeeds of this and other births are destroyed at every step of the round.\n\nAfter the last turn the pilgrim stands behind the cow and, taking the end of her tail in his right hand and putting some money along with it, pours water over the money and the tail-end into the right palm of the priest, at the same time dropping the money and the tail into the priest's hand. The priest lets go the tail, sprinkles the water on the pilgrim's head, utters a blessing, and pockets the money. While the pilgrim is dropping the water over the money and tail into the priest's right palm the priest says:\n\nThe cow in whom live fourteen worlds, and who therefore is able to do good in this world and the next, this cow, whose god is Rudra, who has golden horns, silver hoofs, a copper back, with a making pot and a bell round her neck, this cow I give to you Narsi Ramchandra who art learned in the Vedas and who hast committed them to memory and who hast a wife, that Achyut or Vishnu may be pleased and I saved from hell.\nThree grants of money are made in connection with this cow-gift; the money laid in front of the cow varying from 3d. to 2s. (Rs. 1/8-1), the money given with the cow\u2019s tail varying from 1s. to 6s. (Rs. 1/2-3) or even more, and the money for the cow varying from 1s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5-10) with 4s. to 10s. (Rs. 2-5) for the silver hoofs, golden horns, copper saddle, and brass milk-pail. Some pilgrims also give a month\u2019s fodder money for the cow.\n\nThe next ceremony is the gift of the sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m or Vishnu\u2019s stone full of holes. The sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m gift is made by Komtis, Telangis, and pilgrims from Goa. The pilgrim generally brings with him or the priest supplies from his own house the sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m a smooth quartz pebble. He also brings a gold tulsi leaf, a small brass box or sampusht, a conch shell, a bell, and a copper plate. The pilgrim after bathing and putting on a dry silk waistcloth sits in front of the sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m which is set in the copper plate and offers it sandal-paste, rice, tulsi leaves and flowers, waving lights before it and offering food betel-leaves and money. Then a few rice grains are sprinkled over the priest\u2019s head, sandal-paste is rubbed on his brow, and a few flowers, a betelnut, and a copper are dropped in his palm. A prayer is repeated and the pilgrim hands the sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m to the priest and with it 8s. to 12s. (Rs. 4-6) in cash. The gold tulsi leaf, the conch, and bell are all used in the worship of the sh\u00e1ligr\u00e1m. The tulsi leaf is put or thrown on it, the conch is used to bathe it, and the bell is rung when the light and incense are waved.\n\nThe next ceremony is a shr\u00e1ddh or funeral rite in memory of the pilgrim\u2019s ancestors. As the Bhima flows into the Krishna and not into the sea, mind-rites at Pandharpur are of less avail than at Gaya or N\u00e1sik. For this reason Br\u00e1hmans seldom perform mind-rites at Pandharpur and when they do the moustache is not shaved. When they do perform them Br\u00e1hmans also like to perform mind-rites near the Vishnu feet or Vishnupad temple, or, if the river is flooded, on the bank opposite the Vishnupad. Other castes than Br\u00e1hmans shave the moustache and perform the rite anywhere. There are other points of difference. In the Br\u00e1hmans\u2019 mind-rites the verses are Vedic; in the mind-rites of other castes the verses are from the Pur\u00e1ns. Also in the Br\u00e1hman mind-rites Br\u00e1hmans are fed on the spot, and in the mind-rites of other castes, as the performer cannot touch Br\u00e1hmans at their food, he serves food on plantain leaves and behind the leaves sets two stalks of durva grass which stand for Br\u00e1hmans and before which he lays water, sesame seed, sandal, and tulsi leaves. In performing a mind-rite or shr\u00e1ddh the Br\u00e1hman pilgrim bathes in the river and putting on a dry silk waistcloth sits to the north of Vishnu\u2019s footprints, thrice sips water, and, after repeating the twenty-four names of his god which he uses in his daily prayers, recites a hymn pouring water on his right palm. These mind-rites are like the usual yearly mind-rites performed by Br\u00e1hmans. The differences are noted in the following translation of a Sanskrit couplet: \u2018Five things should be omitted at a mind-rite performed at a holy place, offerings, invocation, holding of leaf-platters, rice offerings, and questions about satisfaction,\u2019 that is, the pilgrim\n\n---\n\n1 See above p. 434.\ndoes not sprinkle on the priest's head a mixture of sandal-paste, rice, flowers, and water as is ordinarily done at mind-rites, he does not call the spirit, he does not hold the leaf-platters on which the dinner is served, he makes no offerings of rice or vikir in memory of male or female ancestors who have died from burns, accidents, or in childbirth and who are therefore not entitled to the pinds or rice balls, and he does not formally ask the dining Br\u00e1hmans at the end of their meal whether they have had enough. The rice balls or pinds are offered and laid on the stone footprints of Vishnu. The names of all the deceased ancestors are uttered and offerings made. If the pilgrim does not remember them all, he makes a general offering in memory of those he has forgotten. After the ceremony is over, the balls are removed and the footprints washed, and sandal-water and sesame are laid before them. For permission to offer and heap the balls on the footprints, the priest or Badya charges a fee of 6d. (4 as.). After the worship the Badya gives the pilgrim pras\u00e1d or god's favour, chiefly fruit or sugar which has been offered to the god. He pats the pilgrim on his back and says 'Thy ancestors have gone to heaven and want 6d. to 2s. (Re. \u00bc - 1) in cash.' The balls offered by others than Br\u00e1hmans are made either of wheat-flour, molasses, or barley, and sometimes of rice-flour. Their mind-rite is called chatashr\u00e1ddh in which straws of darbh grass are used to represent the ancestors. This ends the ceremonies which are performed outside of the temple.\n\nThe pilgrim who has performed all or any of the above ceremonies seldom fails to worship the god Vithoba and the goddess Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed. The worship is of two kinds the mah\u00e1puja that is the great worship also called panch\u00e1mritpuja or five-nectar worship and the p\u00e1dyapuja or footwash worship. During the last few years owing to disputes between the Badv\u00e1s and the Sev\u00e1dh\u00e1ris or inferior attendants of the god, the great worship has been stopped. In performing the great or five-nectar worship the pilgrim, after bathing and dressing in a silk waistcloth and a shawl, comes to the temple and sits in the four-pillared chamber while the priest brings materials for the preliminary worship. A betelnut Ganpati set in a leaf cup is worshipped. Then the pilgrim touches the floor with his hand and worships the earth and Varuna the god of water. A silver dish with water, a conch shell, and the bell which hangs in this chamber are all worshipped with the usual offerings. The pilgrim goes into the god's chamber and the god's clothes are taken off. The priest shows some marks on the god, especially a hollow on the chest which was caused by a Br\u00e1hman's kick when Vishnu was in his eighth or Krishna incarnation. The priest also points out some marks on the back which were worn by the bundle of cakes which Krishna carried on his back when tending cattle. After undressing the idol the five nectars, clarified butter, honey, curds, milk, and cowdung are poured over the god. If he is a Br\u00e1hman or a respectable and rich Hindu pilgrim, he pays for the privilege of pouring the articles over the god with his own hand and of rubbing the god with sugar. All this while\n\n---\n\n1 This shows that the priests claim Vithoba as the incarnate Vishnu, who appeared in Pandharpur at the close of the career of Krishna in Dw\u00e1rka.\nhymns are sung by a priest called the Ben\u00e1ri or hymner. Then sandal, flowers, incense, and money are laid before the god. If the pilgrim makes presents of clothes or ornaments they are put on the god. Flower garlands are thrown round his neck, lights are waved to the accompaniment of songs, food is offered, and money laid at the feet of the god and taken by the Badva of the day, except what is waved which goes to the puj\u00e1ri or ministrant. The offering of food comes from the pilgrim's house if he is a Br\u00e1hman, or from his priest's if he is not a Br\u00e1hman. Two or three points in this worship require mention. The mah\u00e1puja can be performed at any time between the morning and the afternoon, but never after the god has been dressed in the afternoon and is ready to receive visitors. The local priest or kshetra-up\u00e1dhy\u00e1, unless himself a Badva, cannot perform the worship and has to hire a Badva and contracts with his pilgrim for a sum to pay the Badva. Some local priests, who have many pilgrims and who are not themselves Badv\u00e1s, have regularly engaged Badv\u00e1s whom they pay from time to time at a certain rate for every service, the pilgrim having nothing to do with the amount. The priest or kshetra-up\u00e1dhy\u00e1, therefore, unless he is a Badva, cannot claim any money placed on the god's feet, or any money at all, but can receive anything the pilgrim chooses to pay him outside the god's room over and above the amount agreed between him and the Badva. A pilgrim who takes the trouble to perform the great worship seldom hesitates to deck the idol with ornaments. These ornaments are not presented by the pilgrim. They are the property of the temple and have at one time or another been presented by wealthy pilgrims, but they are kept in the charge of the Badv\u00e1s.\u00b9 The ornaments thus presented are brought from the different custodians by the Badva who is to perform the worship and the custodians charge a fee.\n\nP\u00e1dyapuja or footwash-worship, of late years the only worship performed, is a much simpler service than the great worship. Foot worship may be performed at any time, and, during the chief fairs when great crowds of pilgrims press to get a sight or darshan, the foot worship is performed at night so as not to interfere with the pilgrims. The foot worship consists simply in washing the feet of the idol, wiping them dry, sprinkling them with sandal-paste and rice, throwing garlands of flowers round the god's neck, waving lighted incense sticks and camphor, and laying a cash present or dakshina at the feet of the god. Some sweetmeat is offered as food and Vithoba is decked in his ornaments as in the great worship.\n\nThe next worship is of the goddess Rakhum\u00e1i. It is exactly like that of Vithoba except that turmeric and red powder are served instead of sandal-paste. The great mah\u00e1puja or five-nectar worship continues to be performed to the goddess, because, as her priests the Utp\u00e1ts are all of one class, no differences have arisen to cause any interference on the part of the authorities. The same arrangements with respect to ornaments are made as in the worship of Vithoba.\n\n\u00b9 The Badv\u00e1s though not the only priests in Pandharpur have monopolised all the chief presents. Such minor presents as silver dinner services are found in almost every priest's house, and some Badv\u00e1s have silver services enough for fifteen to twenty guests.\nAfter worshipping Vithoba and Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed the pilgrim generally feeds Br\u00e1hmans in honour of the god. This is called Devbr\u00e1hman. Both Br\u00e1hman men and Br\u00e1hman women are asked to the feast; the men in honour of Vithoba, the women in honour of Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed. The priest prepares the dinner at his own house, the number of Br\u00e1hmans being large or small according to the pilgrim\u2019s means. The pilgrim and his family eat at the priest\u2019s after the Br\u00e1hmans have eaten. The dinner includes the ordinary articles of food used by Br\u00e1hmans, while a special dish of gram-flour cakes and other dishes may be added according to the wish and means of the pilgrim. The lowest number of Br\u00e1hmans fed is two that is one man and one woman, but as many as fifty to a hundred are generally fed, and some Kunbis from Ber\u00e1r and Haidarabad make a point of feeding 500 to 1000 Br\u00e1hmans at their yearly visits. The cost of the dinner varies from 4\u00bdd. to 1s. (3-8 as.) for each guest according to the dainties prepared. The men guests, and the women guests who are generally not so numerous as the men, eat in separate places. When the platters are served and just before the guests begin to eat, the pilgrim, if he is a Br\u00e1hman, is called and water is poured into his joined and hollow hands. In the place where the male guests are seated the priest repeats a prayer in honour of Vithoba and in the place where the women guests are seated in honour of Rakhum\u00e1\u00ed. When the prayer is finished, the pilgrim pours the water on the ground, bows to the guests, and asks them to eat slowly. If the pilgrim is not a Br\u00e1hman he may not come near the diners. On the host\u2019s behalf the priest fills his hands with water and recites a hymn in the presence of the male guests. In the presence of the female guests the priest says another hymn. In each case after the prayer the priest drops the water from his hands on the ground. Not every pilgrim performs all these ceremonies. Pilgrims, both of whose parents are alive, do not perform the shraddhas or mind-rites to their ancestors. Some Madras pilgrims treat Pandharpur in much the same way as they treat Benares or Gaya. The women, though their husbands are alive, make the hair offering or venid\u00e1n, that is they have their heads shaved as Br\u00e1hman women\u2019s heads are shaved at Gaya. The ceremonies may either be spread over three days or crowded into one, according to the time and the money the pilgrim means to spend.\n\nExcept the V\u00e1rkaris or monthly pilgrims, all who come for the first time to Pandharpur, feed Br\u00e1hmans, and do the foot-worship, and, if they have their families with them, they also perform the other ceremonies. When they have leisure, pilgrims do not forget to visit the temple and see all the daily services of the god. They go to the temple at ten at night to see the shej\u00e1rti or night light-waving; they are also present at three in the morning for the wick-waving or k\u00e1kad\u00e1rti the first light ceremony of the next day. After bathing in the river and visiting the god Vithoba pilgrims also visit the other temples in the town, and make the holy round or pradakshina. The circuit is of two kinds the god-circuit or devpradakshina and the town-circuit or nagarpradakshina. The god-circuit, which is the circuit usually made by pilgrims, begins from the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing. From it the pilgrim goes to the river, and passing round Pundlik\u2019s temple in the river bed, crosses the\nriver, and, entering the town at the Chandrabh\u00e1ga landing keeps south till he turns west near Datta\u2019s temple. He then goes by the main road to the temple of K\u00e1la M\u00e1rti and includes this as well as a small temple of Krishn\u00e1jib\u00e1va. From it he passes by the main road to the temple of Choph\u00e1la behind Vithoba\u2019s temple. Thence he faces north, and turning at the post office and passing down the road facing east, enters the bed of the river by the Uddhav landing. From the bed of the river he again enters the town by the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing.\n\nEvery devout pilgrim makes the town-round once in his lifetime. Entering the bed of the river by the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing and visiting Pundlik\u2019s temple the pilgrim goes to the Vishnupad and Narad temples both of which are further down in the river. From N\u00e1rad\u2019s temple he goes about three miles south to Anantpur Mah\u00e1dev\u2019s. From this he comes to the Gop\u00e1lpur temple and from it west to Padm\u00e1vati\u2019s. From Padm\u00e1vati\u2019s he turns back and visits Vy\u00e1s\u2019s temple at the north end of the town. From Vy\u00e1s\u2019s he visits the Lakhub\u00e1i and Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i temples on the bank of the river a little nearer to the town. From Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i\u2019s he again enters the river bed and the town by the Mah\u00e1dv\u00e1r landing. The round is a walk of seven to eight miles.\n\nObjects.\n\nOrphanage.\n\nOf other objects of interest besides the temples, the chief is the Pandharpur orphanage in the north-west of the town opposite the sub-judge\u2019s court, the only institution of its kind in the Presidency. It had its origin in the famine of 1876-78 when numbers of children were left to die by their starving parents. While the famine lasted the children were fed in the Gop\u00e1lpur relief house. When the relief house was closed \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) were subscribed by the charitable rich and an orphanage was started in February 1878. Meanwhile a wealthy Hindu merchant of Bombay undertook to provide quarters for the children at a cost of \u00a31060 (Rs. 10,600) and the foundation stone was laid by Sir Richard Temple then Governor of Bombay on the 10th of October 1878. The institution is maintained from the interest of the funds which have been vested in the Bombay Pr\u00e1thana Sam\u00e1j or Prayer Association. The institution is managed by the committee of the Pr\u00e1thana Sam\u00e1j and a few officials and others form a local sub-committee to look after the work of the orphanage. Orphans are now received from different parts of the Presidency. All are given an elementary Mar\u00e1thi education. The boys are taught some craft and the girls are taught needle-work.\n\nFoundling Home.\n\nBesides the orphanage a foundling home has been established from \u00a31000 (Rs.10,000) subscribed in Bombay. The foundling home is closely connected with the orphanage. Br\u00e1hman and other high caste widows who have gone astray come to the building as a lying-in hospital and the children when born are handed to the authorities. In the same enclosure as the orphanage is the Pandharpur school of industry. When the orphanage was fairly started the founders felt the need for providing some means for teaching the orphans a calling. The Pandharpur municipality was led to help and made a yearly grant of \u00a3300 (Rs.3000). The institution was established on the 27th of February 1878. Afterwards funds were gathered and a school built whose foundation stone was laid by His Excellency\nSir James Fergusson the Governor of Bombay on the 23rd of November 1881. The institution is managed by a committee of native officials and leading townsmen of Pandharpur. It is maintained out of the yearly municipal grant of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000), together with a yearly grant in aid of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) from the Education Department. Besides boys from the orphanage, it takes boys from the town, and, with good management, promises to be a useful institution. In 1876 through the exertions of the same committee who afterwards founded and established the orphanage and school of industry an exhibition of native arts, manufactures, and vegetable products was held at Pandharpur. The remnants of that exhibition are still kept in a municipal building near the library.\n\nPandharpur has a large export trade worth about \u00a336,000 (Rs. 3,60,000) in buka powder, gram-pulse, incense sticks, kardai or safflower oil\\(^1\\), kunku or redpowder, maize, parched rice, and snuff. \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) worth of sweet-smelling buka, a fine powder of almost the same articles as incense sticks, are exported. Gram pulse and parched rice worth \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000)\\(^2\\) go to B\u00e1rsi and Shol\u00e1pur and incense sticks or udbattya worth about \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000) go yearly to Bombay. Kardai or safflower oil is exported to the value of about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). Safflower seed is heated in large pans and pressed in a country oil mill worked by bullocks. Kunku or redpowder worth about \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000) is exported. It is prepared from turmeric, borax or sav\u00e1gi, and alum. The turmeric is wiped clean with a wet towel, cut in thin slices, dried, and steeped for three days in a solution of borax and alum, powdered and mixed in the proportion of three parts of borax to one of alum, and boiled in about twelve shers of fresh lime juice. The turmeric is kept dry and ground to fine powder in a hand mill. Snuff worth about \u00a37000 (Rs. 70,000) a year is made from tobacco brought from Miraj and Mangalvedha. The pounding is done in two ways, generally by a mortar and pestle. After it has gained a certain degree of fineness the powder is laid on a piece of cloth tied across the mouth of a large brass vessel in such a way that the cloth touches the bottom of the pot inside. The workman takes the vessel in front of him, and, with a rounded pestle which has no iron ring at its edge, rubs the powder backwards and forwards on the cloth. Along with the snuff are also made fine chewing tobacco or jarda and a minor variety in the shape of small pills containing a concentrated solution of tobacco.\n\nA noted Pandharpur industry is the making of khadi a composition used in printing cloths. Khadi is prepared by boiling resin in linseed oil in an earthen vase, an unpleasant foul-smelling operation until the mixture becomes as thick as treacle. The composition is mixed with chalk and oxicarbonate of lead, and the preparation when complete is thick and soft.

To give them a glossy look powdered mica is sprinkled over the prints and sometimes gold leaf or varkh is daubed over them to make them look like kinkhab. The prints are said to be fast specially those in which the composition consists only of boiled resin and whitelead. The patterns are generally printed on bodicecloths and other kinds of inferior dyed cloth, and these are made into hooded cloaks or kunchis and coats and caps for children, and are largely sold.\n\nIn September 1659 the Bijapur general Afzulkhan encamped at Pandharpur on his way from Bijapur to Wai in Satar. In 1774 Pandharpur was the scene of an action between Raghu-nathrao Peshwa and Trimbakrao Mama sent by the Poona ministers to oppose him. On the fourth of March on a fine plain between Pandharpur and Kasegaon four miles to the south Raghumathrao made a dashing charge on Trimbakrao, and in less than twenty minutes with a force considerably inferior to that of his opponent gained a complete victory, mortally wounded Trimbakrao, and took him prisoner. This victory gave a momentary life to Raghumathrao's cause and enabled him to raise large sums in the city of Pandharpur partly by contributions and partly by pawning a portion of some prize jewels he had brought from North India. In 1792 Mr. Moor the author of the Hindu Pantheon describes Pandharpur as a city belonging to Parshuram Bhau Patvardhan and containing many buildings and a market supplied not only with grain, cloth, and other local products but with a variety of English articles which filled a whole street of shops of Bombay and Poona traders.\n\nIn 1815 Pandharpur was the scene of the murder of Gangadhar Shastri the Gaikwar's agent at the Poona court by Trimbakji Denglia the favourite of Baji Rao the last Peshwa (1796-1817). Gangadhar Shastri had gone to Poona under British guarantee to settle some money disputes between the Gaikwar and the Peshwa, but finding his efforts fruitless he had determined to return to Baroda and leave the settlement to British arbitration. This disconcerted Baji Rao's plans, whose real object was to arrange an union with the Gaikwar against the English, and he and Trimbakji, after much persuasion induced Gangadhar Shastri to stay. In July (1815) Baji Rao went to Pandharpur on a pilgrimage and took with him Trimbakji and Gangadhar Shastri. On the 14th of July the Shastri dined with the Peshwa, and in the evening Trimbakji asked him to Vithoba's temple where the Peshwa was. Gangadhar who was unwell excused himself, but was pressed by Trimbakji and went to the temple with a few unarmed attendants. After a prayer to Vithoba he talked with Trimbakji and then went to pay his respects to the Peshwa who was seated in the upper veranda of the temple and treated him with marked attention. When the visit was over, Gangadhar started for his lodging in high spirits. He had scarcely gone 300 yards when he was attacked in the street by assassins hired by Trimbakji and was almost cut to pieces. The murder of a Brahman\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Marathas, 76.\n2 Grant Duff's Marathas, 367.\n3 Narrative of Captain Little's Detachment, 339-342.\nin the holy city of Pandharpur and Trimbakji Denglia's share in the deed caused much excitement. The death of a man for whose security the British Government had pledged themselves, the proved guilt of Trimbakji and the wavering and intriguing conduct of the Peshwa led to the war between the English and the Peshwa, the fate of which was decided by the British victory at Kirkee near Poona.\\(^1\\) In 1817 an indecisive action was fought near Pandharpur between the Peshwa's horse and the British troops under General Smith who was accompanied by Mr. Elphinstone.\\(^2\\) In 1847 R\u00e1ghoji Bh\u00e1ngrya the noted Koli dacoit was caught at Pandharpur by Lieutenant, afterwards General, Gell. During the 1857 mutinies the office and treasury of the m\u00e1ml\u00e1t\u00e1r of Pandharpur then in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were attacked by rebels but successfully held by the local police.\n\nIn 1879 V\u00e1sudev Balv\u00e1nt Phadke the notorious Br\u00e1hman leader of dacoits was on his way to Pandharpur from the Niz\u00e1m's territories to raise money to pay his recruits when he was captured at Devar Navadgi in Bij\u00e1pur thirty miles east of Indi.\\(^3\\)\n\nS\u00e1ngola, on the M\u00e1n about fifty miles south-west of Shol\u00e1pur is a municipal town the head-quarters of the S\u00e1ngola sub-division with in 1872 a population of 5111 and in 1881 of 4726. The 1872 census showed 4839 Hindus and 272 Musalm\u00e1ns and the 1881 census 4323 Hindus and 403 Musalm\u00e1ns. A weekly market is held on Sunday. Besides the revenue and police offices of the sub-division S\u00e1ngola has a municipality, a post office, and a fort. The municipality which was established in 1855 had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3122 (Rs. 1220) and an expenditure of \u00a3234 (Rs. 2340). The fort in which the sub-divisional offices are now held is said to have been built by a Bij\u00e1pur king, and so prosperous was the town which grew up round it that until it was sacked by Holkar's Path\u00e1ns in 1802, it was locally called The Golden S\u00e1ngola or Sony\u00e1che S\u00e1ngole. The town has never recovered the ruin of 1802.\n\nIn 1750 B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed Peshwa's usurpation of supreme authority on the death of Sh\u00e1hu in 1749 was resisted by one Yam\u00e1j\u00ed Shivdev who threw himself into S\u00e1ngola fort and raised the standard of rebellion. B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed's cousin Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v marched to S\u00e1ngola, and, that Yam\u00e1j\u00ed might have no excuse for resistance, he took with him R\u00e1mr\u00e1ja the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chief. Yam\u00e1j\u00ed's rising was suppressed. During his stay at S\u00e1ngola, R\u00e1mr\u00e1ja agreed to give to the Peshwa supreme power in return for a small tract round S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. This agreement was never carried out.\\(^4\\)\n\nShol\u00e1pur\\(^5\\) or the Sixteen Villages, north latitude 17\u00b0 40' east longitude 75\u00b0 46', the head-quarters of the Shol\u00e1pur district, with in 1881 a population of 61,281, is a station on the south-east branch of the Peninsula Railway 165 miles south-east of Poona and 283 miles south-east of Bombay.

Maulvi Muhammad K\u00e1sim.\nthe sixth city in the Bombay Presidency and the second in the Bombay Deccan, with a town site, including the cantonment,\\(^1\\) of 852 acres that is a population of seventy to the square acre.\n\nThe town lies 1800 feet above sea level on the water-shed of the Adila, a feeder of the Sina which it joins at N\u00e1ndur about eight miles south-west of the city. The city stands in the centre of a large plain, the nearest hill called D\u00e1vad Molak being eight miles to the east, while on the north at a distance of twelve miles rises S\u00e1vargaon Dongar, and about ten miles further north is Tulj\u00e1pur hill. About four miles to the north-west is the Ekruk, or as it is generally called the Hiparga lake, and to the north, about half a mile on the Tulj\u00e1pur road, is the Shol\u00e1pur water-works engine house, and about 500 yards further north the Shelgi stream runs east to west. To the north-west, close to the city wall and east of the Poona road, is the Thorla or large Mh\u00e1rv\u00e1da. About 1500 to 2000 yards to the west of the city are the Police Lines and the Shol\u00e1pur Spinning and Weaving Mill. To the south-west, close to the city wall, lies the fort of Shol\u00e1pur, and one to two thousand yards further are the officers\u2019 bungalows of the old cavalry lines now mostly occupied by railway servants and the railway station. To the south of the city, with the fort on its west bank, is the Siddheshvar lake with a temple in the centre. On the south-east bank of the lake are the municipal garden and a Musalm\u00e1n dome called Sh\u00e1h Javh\u00e1r\u2019s Ghumat, and about 1000 yards more to the south-east are the Collector\u2019s office and bungalow in the Sadar Baz\u00e1r of the old cantonment. About 100 to 500 yards south-west of the Collector\u2019s office and bungalow stretch the officers\u2019 bungalows of the old cantonment; from fifty to 100 yards west of the officers\u2019 bungalows are the Protestant church, the Roman Catholic chapel, and the post office; further west is the hamlet of Modikh\u00e1na, and about 300 yards west of Modikh\u00e1na is the old commissariat cattle yard. The Motib\u00e1g and Revansiddheshvar\u2019s temple, and a pond on their eastern boundary lie about 500 yards south of the Protestant church. About 1000 yards south-east of the Sadar Baz\u00e1r are the Native Infantry lines, and to the south of the lines are the officers\u2019 bungalows in the present cantonment limits. To the east of the Siddheshvar lake are the Siddheshvar, Begam P\u00e1chha, Shankar, and Shanv\u00e1r wards or peths; and, to the east of the city are the Morgan, Somv\u00e1r, S\u00e1khar, Ganesh, Budhy\u00e1r, Guruv\u00e1r, B\u00e1bu, Dh\u00e1kta or Small Mh\u00e1rv\u00e1da, and Jodbh\u00e1vi wards. The area within the old city wall was about 150 acres, and included only the Kasba and the Shukrav\u00e1r wards. Under the fourth Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v (1761-1772) about seventy-three acres more to the north were gained by pulling down the north of the old city wall, which ran from the south-east corner of the present city wall at the south of the B\u00e1l\u00e1 gate as far as the D\u00e1ri gate. A stone and mud masonry wall was built round the added part, and the Tulj\u00e1pur gate which is said to have originally been to the south and in front of M\u00e1ru\u1e6di\u2019s temple near the fruitsellers\u2019 shops, was built in the new wall. This wall is said to have been built by a levy from the sale of goods. It is known as the Mangalv\u00e1r ward, because the weekly Tuesday market\n\n\\(^1\\) The population of Shol\u00e1pur cantonment is 1391.\nnow held in the Jodbh\u00e1vi ward was originally held there. About 1872 many parts of the city wall were pulled down but it still encloses most of the city. When the bulk of the British troops were moved from Shol\u00e1pur, the part now known as the old cantonment consisting of the Sadar Baz\u00e1r, Modikh\u00e1na, and the bungalows of the Cavalry lines, and, in 1881, the open ground to the west and south of Shol\u00e1pur fort, were included in municipal limits.\n\nThe rock on which the city is built is a hard murum almost approaching trap. Except to the north and east where is some rich cotton soil the rock in places is near the surface barely covered by soil. In the rains the surroundings of the town are green and pleasant, at other times the city looks bare and uninteresting, except patches of land watered from the Ekruk canal to the north and west of the town.\n\nIts great castle is handsome and well placed on the rising western bank of the Siddheshvar lake. Except the castle the town has little of architectural interest, most of the houses being one-storeyed and flat-roofed and most of the streets crooked and narrow. The most notable objects besides the fort at the south-west corner of the city and the Siddheshvar lake and temple to the east of the fort, are the municipal garden on the south bank of the lake and the Kamar or Motib\u00e1g pond about a mile further south beyond the cantonment and railway, with two roads to Bij\u00e1pur one passing over and the other below the dam of the Motib\u00e1g lake.\n\nThe view from the high ground to the east of the Siddheshv\u00e1r pond includes to the north three temples with large domes, the biggest a Jain temple with a gilt top and the usual pyramidal towers, and one to the left known as Tripur\u00e1ntakeshv\u00e1r\u2019s temple divided by parallel lines into storeys rising like one bud growing out of another. In the other two spires the storeys are masked by ornaments. The spires are covered with rich ornaments in pleasant yellow and brown stucco. Especially to the west are many trees pipals, nims, and tamarinds, some of them very large. A few of the poorest houses are black-thatched huts and a few of the richest are large mansions with flat-topped pavilions on their roofs. Most have flat roofs of gray earth.\n\nThe natural drainage of the city is good. The surface water is carried by the Lendki on the east, a feeder of the Shelgi, which, along the north of the town, flows west to the Adila, or, as it is here called, the B\u00e1la. The lowest part of the town is the west.\n\nThe city is enclosed by a wall, two and a half miles round, of which two miles round the Kasba and Shukrav\u00e1r wards are old and half a mile on the north was made about 125 years ago. About 1872, to give room to the growing town, the municipality pulled down the whole of the east wall and parts on the south-west and north. The walls are eight to ten feet high, four to six feet wide at the base, and three to four feet wide at the top. In some parts they are built entirely of stone and mud, in other parts the three or four feet at the foot are built of stone and the five or six feet at the\n\n---\n\n1 The municipal boundaries are on the north the land of Shelgi village and the Shelgi stream, on the west the Shelgi stream and the railway, on the south the railway and the cantonment, and on the east survey numbers 220, 217, 203, 166, 165, 164, 155 and 102 in the revision survey of Shol\u00e1pur and the land of Shelgi.\ntop of sun-dried bricks and mud. The stone work is throughout pointed with mortar.\n\nSholapur had originally eight gates or vesas, Degaon Nava and B\u00e1la on the west, Tuljapur on the north, Kumbh\u00e1ri and D\u00e1ri on the east, Bij\u00e1pur and P\u00e1ni on the south, and Killa or Revni\\(^1\\) on the south-west. The Degaon, Tuljapur, Kumbh\u00e1ri, D\u00e1ri, and Bij\u00e1pur gates have been pulled down and a fine road made from the Kumbh\u00e1ri gate to the Bij\u00e1pur gate. The Nava gate, so called because it leads to the Navi ward opened by Mr. Goldfinch in 1864, about 275 yards of the Degaon gate, was opened by the municipality in 1864.\n\nThe city is divided into the Kasba or old town including the Navi or Goldfinch ward, called after Mr. W. A. Goldfinch, C. S. a former Collector, and fifteen peths or wards, B\u00e1bu, Begam, Budhv\u00e1r, Ganesh, Guruv\u00e1r, Jodbh\u00e1vi, Mangalv\u00e1r, Margompatti, P\u00e1chha, S\u00e1kh\u00e1r, Shankar, Shanv\u00e1r, Shukrav\u00e1r, Siddheshvar, and Somv\u00e1r lying round the town. The Kasba, Mangalv\u00e1r, and Shukrav\u00e1r wards are within the town walls. Of the remaining twelve, Siddheshvar, Begam, Shankar, Shanv\u00e1r, P\u00e1chha, and Margompatti wards on the south and south-east, and S\u00e1kh\u00e1r, Somv\u00e1r, Ganesh, Budhv\u00e1r, Guruv\u00e1r, and Jodbh\u00e1vi wards on the east are outside the town walls. Since the establishment (1877) of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Mill near the Police lines, the mill buildings together with the police lines are called Mill ward. The Sadar Baz\u00e1r or main market and a cluster of buildings to its south-west known as the Modikh\u00e1na form suburbs of the town and are inhabited by a mixed population. The city has four hamlets or v\u00e1dis all to the south three of them purely agricultural and the fourth, Tirhev\u00e1di, near the railway station inhabited by working men employed in the railway and in the Sadar Baz\u00e1r and Cantonment. Within the city limits is an open plot called Hasikal to the west of Khandoba\u2019s pond which is used for drying yarn dyed with indigo.\\(^2\\) The south of the town including the Siddheshvar ward is chiefly occupied by Burud bamboo workers and Ghis\u00e1di tinkers; the south-east and east excluding the Jodbh\u00e1vi ward by S\u00e1li, Koshti, and Momin weavers; the Jodbh\u00e1vi and Mangalv\u00e1r wards by Ling\u00e1yat, Gujar, and M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1nis and well-to-do traders; and the west that is the Kasba and Shukrav\u00e1r wards chiefly by Br\u00e1hmans, Gujar and M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, Pardeshis, Dhangars, and Dhors. The Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs live in Mh\u00e1rv\u00e1da outside the town walls on the east between the Kumbh\u00e1ri and D\u00e1ri gates and on the west near the Degaon gate. Some Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs also live within the town walls in Shukrav\u00e1r ward near the Bij\u00e1pur gate. For municipal and sanitary purposes the town is divided into twelve wards each under a supervisor or muk\u00e1dam. Thirteen municipal messengers look after the sanitation of the outskirts of the town at a monthly cost of \u00a37 16s. (Rs. 78).\n\nThe Sadar Baz\u00e1r or main market lies on rising ground about a mile to the south-east of the town. From the Collector\u2019s bungalow to the post office the road passes under an old b\u00e1bhul-covered embankment which\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Revni seems to be a local pronunciation of the English word ravelin, as the gate leads to the ravelin on the north of the fort ditch.\n\n\\(^2\\) Hasikal in K\u00e1narese means a place for drying dyed yarn,\nis locally said to be the dam of an old pond for the water-supply of the town which was demolished by order of Aurangzeb and turned into a garden called the Nava B\u00e1g. The Sadar Baz\u00e1r contains 1437 houses lodging 4968 people. Most of the houses have tiled roofs. The water-supply is from three wells two of which yield good water. The beef slaughter house with the beef market behind it lies on the east outskirts. The vegetable market is in the middle of the baz\u00e1r and consists of a building with a tiled roof on masonry pillars. A new distillery was built in 1877 about 700 yards south of the railway station outside municipal limits. The old distillery is now used for selling country liquor.\n\nThe suburb of Modikh\u00e1na, with about 228 houses lodging 777 people, lies about 500 yards to the north of the Protestant church or about 1000 yards to the north-west of the present cantonment. The houses have mostly tiled roofs and are occupied by railway servants and husbandmen of mixed castes. Originally it was chiefly inhabited by commissariat servants, as it lies about 300 yards east of the commissariat yard.\n\nThe police lines lie to the west of the city near the old Pandharpur and Miraj road and close to the Ekruk lake canal. The natural drainage on the north of the lines is defective and the water of the canal sometimes overflows and forms an unpleasant marsh. The lines are in two rows each of sixty close rooms on very low plinths with mud walls and tiled roofs. In 1882-83 the municipality built two sets of latrines between the police lines and the city, each with eight seats.\n\nThe city has eight main and cross streets the chief being a south and north street running from the Collector's bungalow in Siddhesvar ward to the Tulj\u00e1pur gate. It is fairly straight and broad and is the chief business quarter of the town. About 200 to 300 yards east of this road is another street, which, running just outside of the city wall from Bij\u00e1pur to Tulj\u00e1pur gate, meets the first street near the Bij\u00e1pur and Tulj\u00e1pur gates. To its right are four west to east cross streets one through Shanv\u00e1r ward and Margom-patti, another through S\u00e1khar ward, the third between Ganesh and Jodbh\u00e1vi and Guruv\u00e1r wards, and the fourth in Jodbh\u00e1vi ward. The first three are fairly straight and lead as far as the north and south or Haidarabad road which passes by the west of the Judge's court. The second cross street to the left of the second main street starts from the Kumbh\u00e1ri gate, passes through the grain market in Mangalv\u00e1r ward, meets the first main street and runs west through the cloth market to the B\u00e1la gate. Near the B\u00e1la gate it turns about 100 feet to the south, and inside and close to the wall, about three-quarters of a mile further near the Degaon gate, it again turns to the south. The Sadar Baz\u00e1r has a main east and west street fairly straight and about half a mile long; and a south and north street which crosses the main street near a police station which is also used as a branch dispensary and camp library. Besides these two main and cross streets the city and cantonment have many lanes.\n\nThe 1851-52 census showed for Shol\u00e1pur city a population of 30,819. The 1872 census showed 54,744 people or an increase in\ntwenty years of 23,925 or about 78 per cent chiefly the result of the opening of the south-east branch of the Peninsula railway with a station at Shol\u00e1pur. The 1872 details were 41,620 or about 77 per cent Hindus, 12,748 or 23\u00b749 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 306 Christians, and seventy Others. The 1881 census showed a population of 61,281 an increase of 6537 or about twelve per cent which would have been greater but for the heavy mortality in Shol\u00e1pur town during the 1876-78 famine. The 1881 details were Hindus 45,772 or 74\u00b764 per cent, Musalm\u00e1ns 14,780 or 24\u00b711 per cent, Christians 511, P\u00e1rsis 127, and ninety-one Others.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census Shol\u00e1pur had 8720 houses lodging 54,744 people or 6\u00b728 in each house. Of these 2037 were good, 3333 middling, and 3350 poor. The 1881 census showed 8751 houses, 8330 of them occupied, lodging 61,281 people or 7\u00b736 in each house. Of the 8330 occupied houses, thirty-six were bungalows most of them with thatched roofs; 941 were one-storeyed, nine two-storeyed, and one a three-storeyed house; 1467 were ground floors with tiled roofs and 4752 with flat roofs; 1119 were huts and five were Police Lines. Of the occupied houses 127 were of the first class worth a yearly rent of \u00a320 to \u00a350 (Rs. 200 - 500); 326 of the second class worth a yearly rent of \u00a310 to \u00a320 (Rs. 100-200); 875 of the third class worth a yearly rent of \u00a35 to \u00a310 (Rs. 50 - 100); 4384 of the fourth class worth a yearly rent of \u00a31 to \u00a35 (Rs.10 - 50); and 2618 of the fifth class worth a yearly rent of \u00a31 (Rs.10) and under. In the total 8751 were 495 shops, sixteen stores, fifty-two temples, forty-six mosques, eight tak\u00edas or inns, nine rest-houses, four churches, and one fire temple. The flat roofed houses have mostly stone and mud built walls while some have burnt brick and mud masonry upper floors and tiled roofs. The plinths are generally one to three feet above the road. The walls of the one-storeyed tiled houses are generally of mud masonry. The timber commonly used is nim, b\u00e1hul, and nimb\u00e1ra. Some of the richer houses are built of stone and burnt brick. As a rule the walls present a blank face to the streets with few openings except the door. Ten to twelve feet of wall on the first or ground floor are of stone, the walls of the upper floors being generally built of burnt brick. Some house walls are enlivened by bright figures of elephants and tigers, painted chiefly by Hindus of the Jingar caste on marriage occasions. Inside the flat-roofed houses are generally one or more courts or chauks about twelve feet square, with a row of four plain figures about eight feet high on each side and with raised verandas all round and rooms opening from and above them. In the first or outer court a place is usually kept for visitors and for business, where a carpet is spread and cushions are set. In the inner court are the eating and cooking rooms generally at right angles to each other. The upper storey has a wooden front and overhangs, leaving in the centre a square of four to eight feet. From some of these houses doorways lead to balconies built on the roof as a place for\n\n---\n\n1 The total includes 1391 the population of the cantonment.\nenjoying the breeze. The roofs of a few of the houses are painted and the rest of the woodwork is stained black. Even among the well-to-do, middle class houses are built with stone and mud walls and the roofs are flat mud terraces with bare walls relieved only by a cut-stone doorway. The inside arrangements do not differ from those of the better sort of houses. The houses of the poor are mud hovels of one room divided by a mud partition and roofed with poor thatch. The floor is often below the level of the road, the only passage for air and smoke is the doorway, which is generally low and narrow, and, as the smoke takes long to find its way out, the inside atmosphere is stifling and almost always unhealthy. Many of the houses are ruinous. Though they form a fairly even line in the main streets they have very irregular frontages, and in places the lanes are very crooked and winding. Of the whole number, 2400 houses have privies inside their walls and about 200 have detached privies.\n\nSince 1818 when it passed under the British, Shol\u00e1pur has grown steadily in importance as a trade centre. When, after some years of British management, it became free from the risk of raids of robbers from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, Shol\u00e1pur became a resort of traders, and the opening of a railway station in 1859 raised it to be one of the chief marts in the Deccan. The staple trade is cotton, though, since 1870, B\u00e1rsi has drawn much cotton trade from Shol\u00e1pur. The chief cotton traders are Bombay Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s and some local Ling\u00e1yats, Komtis, and Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1n\u00eds. The railway returns for the four years ending 1883 show at Shol\u00e1pur station an average of 215,207 passengers and 49,498 tons of goods.\n\nShol\u00e1pur has a cotton mill belonging to the Shol\u00e1pur Spinning and Weaving Company Limited which began work in March 1877. The company has a capital of \u00a367,850 (Rs. 6,78,500) and is managed by Bombay Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s. The machinery which is driven by two engines each of forty horse-power, works 20,888 spindles and 175 looms and employs 850 hands at a monthly wage expenditure of about \u00a3770 (Rs. 7700), the total amount paid in wages in 1883-84 amounting to \u00a38620 (Rs. 86,200). Of the workmen about 150 are Musalm\u00e1ns and the rest Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. About 100 are from M\u00e1lvan in Ratn\u00e1giri, and the rest belong to Shol\u00e1pur and the neighbourhood. The daily outturn of yarn is 5500 to 6000 pounds part of which is worked into cloth. The wholesale price of yarn is about \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 125) for a bale of 300 pounds. Most of the cloth goes to B\u00e1rsi, Bij\u00e1pur and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory.\n\nExcluding 222 in the Sadar Baz\u00e1r, Shol\u00e1pur city has about 1936 shops and eleven warehouses chiefly along the north and south main road from the Siddheshvar ward to the Tulj\u00e1pur gate, and in the cross roads and lanes in Mangalv\u00e1r ward at its north end.\n\n---\n\n1 Details are given above under Trade p. 267.\n2 Details are given above p. 270.\n3 Of the 1936 shops and eleven warehouses, two hundred are of Nir\u00e1la or yarn dyers; one hundred and sixty-two of cloth sellers; one hundred and fifty of Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs or shoemakers; one hundred and five of grain sellers; one hundred and two of flour sellers and grocers; eighty-two of vegetable sellers; eighty of mutton sellers;\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nShol\u00e1pur.\n\nShops.\n\nManagement.\n\nWater Works.\n\nAbout half of the shops are owned by the shopkeepers and half are rented. The shops are usually in the ground floors of houses in two parts, each about twelve feet long by six or eight feet wide, of which the inner part is used as a storeroom and the outer part or veranda is the shop where sales are made. A few of the new shops are faced with wood and have arched windows and overhanging eaves. The usual business hours are six to twelve in the morning and two to eight in the evening. The 222 shops in the Sadar Bazar are chiefly along both sides of the east and west main road.\u00b9\n\nShol\u00e1pur is throughout the year the seat of the Judge and civil surgeon and, during the rains, of the Collector, the assistant and deputy collectors, police superintendent, and district engineer. It is also the head-quarters of the chief revenue and police offices of the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division, and has a municipality, civil hospital, jail, dispensary, high school, post and telegraph offices, railway station, travellers\u2019 bungalow, temples, and fort. The municipality was established in 1853. In 1882-83 it had an income of \u00a312,237 (Rs. 1,22,370) chiefly from octroi (Rs. 92,799), and an expenditure of \u00a310,868 (Rs. 1,08,680) chiefly on public health, conservancy, and water.\n\nThe chief municipal undertaking has been the water-works which form the chief source of the city water-supply. They were built by the municipality between 1879 and 1881 at a cost of \u00a322,593 10s. (Rs. 2,25,935) and give a daily supply of about six gallons a head. Water is drawn from the Ekr\u00fck lower level canal at a site in the fifth mile through a line of ten-inch pipes into a settling tank.\u00b2 From the settling tank the water is pumped by steam power direct\n\nseventy-five of tailors; seventy-two of grocers; fifty-seven each of yarn sellers and betel sellers; forty-eight of moneychangers; forty-five of oil-pressers; forty-three of gold and silver smiths; forty each of Bhois or fishermen and Kumbhars or potters; thirty-seven of metal vessel makers; thirty-six of fruit sellers; thirty-four of moneylenders; thirty each of blacksmiths and flower sellers; twenty-nine of silk sellers and spinners; twenty-five each of Dhors or tanners, of Ghisadis or tinkers, and Lonaris or lime sellers; twenty-two of native doctors; twenty of Buruds or bamboo basket makers and sellers; nineteen of bangle sellers; eighteen of sweetmeat sellers; seventeen of bead and needle sellers; sixteen of Rangaris or dyers; fifteen of Kasirs or brass pot sellers; fourteen of grain parchers; thirteen of Atars or perfumers; twelve of country cigar makers and sellers; eleven of raw cotton sellers; ten of Bohoras or miscellaneous sellers; ten of beef sellers; nine of Pinjaris or cotton cleaners; eight of pulse makers and sellers; seven each of country liquor sellers, hemp sellers, hotel keepers, snuff sellers, timmers, and tin workers; six of Patvekars or gold necklace stringers; six of Saltangars or tanners of sheep and goat skins; five each of stamp vendors and cocoanut sellers; four each of booksellers, cotton seed sellers, and pearl sellers; three each of cloth printers, armourers, lac bangle makers and sellers, toddy sellers, and spiced tobacco or gaddikus sellers; two each of firework makers and sellers, watchmakers, and English liquor sellers; and one each of bh\u00e1ng sellers, opium sellers, bookbinders, and country fiddle makers and sellers.\n\n\u00b9 The shop details are: Twenty-five of oil expressers and sellers; nineteen of Chambhars or country shoemakers and sellers; fifteen each of flour dealers and grocers, potters, and tailors; twelve each of pulse splitters and English shoe and boot makers; eleven of grain sellers; ten each of betel-leaf sellers and mutton sellers; nine of money-lenders; seven each of vegetable sellers and beef sellers; six each of gold and silver smiths and moneychangers; four each of fruit sellers, perfumers, burnt lime sellers, and timmers; three each of sweetmeat sellers, bangle sellers, tanners, and hide sellers, Bohoras or miscellaneous sellers, European liquor sellers, and country liquor sellers; two each of cloth sellers, blacksmiths, and hotel keepers; and one each of a bookbinder, a grain parcher, and a hemp-water hemp-flower and opium seller.\n\n\u00b2 Details of the Ekr\u00fck Lake are given above pp. 225-226, 411.\nthrough a line of main pipes into two service reservoirs at different levels, called the Percival and Spry Reservoirs, from which water is distributed by about eighty standpipes and posts.\\(^1\\) Before the waterworks were made by the municipality the chief source of the city water-supply was the Siddheshvar lake and about twenty wells with and without steps which dried in 1876 when the people had to get water from the Ekruk canal a quarter to half a mile on the north and west of the city. In 1876 the Sanitary Commissioner reported that, but for the Ekruk lake, Sholapur would have been deserted as all the ordinary supply of water had dried and the people were entirely dependent on canal water. As the lake supply though constant and ample was at too great a distance the municipality decided to undertake a scheme for bringing the water into the city. Projects were originally made in 1868 by Captain C. B. T. Penny, R. E., and Mr. J. E. Whiting, C.E., but the question was shelved from time to time until 1876 when the famine brought the subject to the front. In 1878 Mr. C. T. Burke, C.E., proposed three schemes one by gravitation from a special storage reservoir on the Shelgi stream and the other two from the Ekruk lake, one by raising water by a turbine worked by the canal flow and the other by raising water by steam power. The third project was recommended by the Chief Engineer for irrigation and adopted by the municipality, and the money was raised by a loan. The works were begun on the 6th of November 1879 and were formally opened by His Excellency Sir James Fergusson, K.C.M.G., Governor of Bombay, on the 22nd of July 1881, when the two service reservoirs were called after Mr. E. H. Percival, C.S., and Mr. A. H. Spry, C.S., two former Collectors of Sholapur who did much to further schemes for the water-supply of the city. A white marble tablet on the north wall of the engine house bears the following inscription:\n\nSholapur Water Works.\n\nThese works were designed and executed by\n\nC. T. Burke, C.E., Assoc.

The chief rainy months are June to October, the heaviest falls being between July and September. Warmth returns for the twelve years ending 1882 showed highest warmths varying from 112\u00b0 in June 1872 to 79\u00b0 in May 1873, and lowest warmths varying from 52\u00b0 in December 1873 to 61\u00b0 in January 1871 and December 1873.\n\nThe city has no remarkable public buildings. The district and subdivisional revenue offices are just outside the town on the south, and, on the east, between the Haidarabad and Akalkot roads are the courts of the district and subordinate judges. The jail and civil hospitals are both in Pachha ward. Opposite each other in the Navi or Goldfinch ward are the charitable dispensary and the municipal office, and at the other end of the street in the Kasba is an upper-storeyed building which accommodates the high school above and a vernacular school below as well as a library and reading room. The travellers' bungalow is near the railway station. The criminal jail and civil hospital are near each other. The jail has room for 112 prisoners. In 1883 the civil hospital treated in-patients 379 and out-patients 5889 at a cost of \u00a3654 (Rs. 6540); and the dispensary treated in-patients ninety-seven and out-patients 14,087 at a cost of \u00a3205 (Rs. 2050). Except an old temple of Siddheshvar in the Siddheshvar lake, the Hindu temples are modern and uninteresting. The chief are three of Datt\u00e1traya, Mallik\u00e1rjun, and P\u00e1ndurang, three Jain temples, and one monastery or math of Subr\u00e1v B\u00e1va. The mosques are named the J\u00e1ma and the K\u00e1li. Of the three Christian places of worship one is a Protestant church, one a Roman Catholic chapel both within the limits of the old cantonment, and the third is an American mission chapel in the town near the school.\n\nClose to the water in the north-east corner of the island in the Siddheshvar lake is the temple of Siddheshvar, a small stone building with a timber front or entrance hall and in the temple over a tomb the bust of a man. On its north and east sides the island is surrounded by a stone pavement with two steps. The committee of Ling\u00e1yat traders in the city have built a row of flat-roofed arched cloisters round the east and south sides of the island. In the centre of the island on a stone platform are a pair of stone lings and in the north of the island are a few enclosures and small rest-houses. In honour of Siddheshvar a yearly fair is held on the south-east bank of the lake where about 400 booths are set up. The priests of the temple are Ling\u00e1yats who are known as Habus and marry with Panchams\u00e1li Ling\u00e1yats. The women of the priests\u2019 family wear the usual movable ling, but the men instead of a ling wear a heavy necklace of rudr\u00e1ksha beads. The boys, when between seven and ten years old, on the full-moon day of Jyeshth or May-June in a leap year or dhanda s\u00e1l, are initiated as priests by their head teacher or guru who is also a Habu. After a boy has been shaved he and the teacher together climb to the raised stone platform in the centre of the island and sit the teacher to the\n\n---\n\n1 Details are given above pp. 7-8.\nsouth and the novice to the north of the double ling, while the teacher repeats texts and a Jangam or secular priest winds strands of cotton yarn round the teacher and the novice. The teacher chants and prays all the time. The ceremony is completed by an offering to the ling and by giving a dinner to the Habu families. The Habus of Siddheshvar\u2019s temple are also the ministrants of a N\u00e1goba or cobra-god, who, in the form of a pair of twined snakes, has a small shrine on the left of the raised way that joins the island with the bank of the lake.\n\nMallik\u00e1rjun\u2019s temple is in an open court (80\u2019 \u00d7 75\u2019) surrounded by a stone plinth five feet high with arched stone cloisters supported on stone pillars ten on every side and four feet high. The cloisters are twelve feet broad. The temple has a porch with three entrances. The porch has four rows of four pillars, some old and polished and some new. In front is a bull and four old light pillars. Above is a rough frieze of plaster figures of apes, dancing-girls, and bullocks seated on the roof. The tower is covered with small images and polished brass knobs. On the south side of the temple enclosure is a Hanum\u00e1n.\n\nThe chief Jain temple of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th is in the Mangalv\u00e1r ward. It is a copy of a Jain temple at B\u00e1r\u00e1mati in Poona and is said to have been built about 1850 at an estimated cost of \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000). The temple is in an enclosure surrounded by domes. The temple has short clustered pillars and the roof and tower are covered with thick-set mortar figures and ornaments of pleasant shades of brown. There are two images of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th one with and one without clothes, both made of stone brought from Jaipur in Rajput\u00e1na. The worshippers are Gujars, M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, and K\u00e1s\u00e1rs.\n\nThe greater part of the old military cantonment of Shol\u00e1pur, including the Sadar Baz\u00e1r, Modikh\u00e1na, and cavalry lines with the site on the south-west of the camp on which the old artillery lines stood, has been transferred to the civil authorities. The present cantonment covers an area of about 600 acres just enough for a single Native Infantry Regiment. The fort was in charge of the military authorities, but since the removal of the Native Infantry Regiment in 1877, it is in charge of the civil authorities. The line of the present camp limits is most irregular. It starts from the north-east corner where the Kumbh\u00e1ri road crosses it and passes west including part of the catchment area of the Siddheshvar lake. The north face on this side stretches for about half a mile until it approaches the officers\u2019 enclosures in the Sadar Baz\u00e1r whence it again passes irregularly west until it meets the stream carrying the water of the Motib\u00e1g pond to a point nearly opposite the hamlet of Tik\u00e1ji\u2019s V\u00e1di about 400 yards below the south-east corner of the cemetery. The southern boundary of the camp is formed by this stream and by the Motib\u00e1g-Bij\u00e1pur road from which the line is continued to a point opposite the north-east corner. The parade ground of the Native Infantry Regiment forms the eastern face.\n\nThe country on the east is open and higher than the cantonment and forms part of the catchment area of the Siddheshvar lake. The\ncountry on the south is open and uncultivated and forms the water-\nshed of two streams beyond which is the embankment of the Motib\u00e1g pond. On the north is the Sadar Baz\u00e1r, below which on\nthe west the road has been formed below the embankment of the\nold pond which was destroyed by Aurangzeb and made into a garden.\nOn the south-west, beginning from the old race course, is a large\nGovernment meadow or kuran said to cover about 500 acres. The\nstation is very bare, the soil being in places not more than two inches\ndeep. Except the valley of the Motib\u00e1g pond, where lies the garden\nwhich gives its name to the pond and which has many fine tamarind,\nmango and pipal trees, the only trees are along the road-sides.\nImmediately below the embankment, the ground is marshy and\nswampy growing rank sedgy bushes all the year round. The officers\u2019\nbungalows lie on the ridge close above the Motib\u00e1g pond, and\nthe regimental lines occupy the parallelogram towards the north-\neast. The officers\u2019 as well as other bungalows are covered with\nthatch which, if well laid, lasts twenty years.\u00b9 The windows of\nmany of the bungalows are small, the plinths low and the air\nclose. The regimental lines have been built in the highest part\nof the cantonment, with a good fall to the north, south, and west,\nand open country all round. The lines face north and south and\nconsist of thirty-two blocks of hutteries divided into two by a central\nstreet 150 feet broad. Each division has eight rows of two blocks\nof pandals and on either flank of each row is a native officer\u2019s\nhouse. Each block contains forty-eight rooms which are placed\nback to back so that twenty-four rooms have a northerly and\ntwenty-four have a southerly aspect. Including the veranda a\nmarried sepoys\u2019 room is $11'6'' \\times 17'$ and a single man\u2019s room\n$10'6'' \\times 17'$. The walls are built of mud with a few holes in the front\nwalls. The roofs are partly single and partly double tiled. The cubic\nspace for a married sepoys amounts to 2346 cubic feet and for a single\nman to 2160 cubic feet. The lines are remarkably clean and well kept\nand great attention is paid to their conservancy. The water-supply\nis from wells, the best and most ample supply is from a well fifty-\nfive feet deep lately built on the north-east. The officers\u2019 well is to\nthe east close to the Kamar pond in Motib\u00e1g near Revansiddheshvar\u2019s\ntemple. The Motib\u00e1g pond about 100 yards to the east of the\nofficers\u2019 well is formed by damming two small streams. The pond,\nwhich was rebuilt in 1830, has when full a surface area of\nsixty-eight acres. In 1874 the masonry work was repaired and the\nold sluice gate which was found partly open below removed. In\n1876 the cantonment committee spent \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), allowed by\nGovernment as famine relief work, in scraping the exposed surface\nof the pond and in removing dried weeds and the earth below\nabout six inches deep and in clearing the pond of weeds. The\nbottom of the pond is not water-tight. The ground immediately\nto the west of the embankment and between it and the Motib\u00e1g is\n\n\u00b9 Thatch coverings are injurious to health as they do not let air pass through them,\nare liable to catch fire, and are always decaying. On the other hand in a dry climate\nlike Sholapur they are better than tiled roofs being cheaper, lighter, and cooler in\nthe hot season, keeping more heat during the cold weather, and leaking less than tiles.\nmarshy. The earth trenches cut in it are overgrown with rank vegetation and the water gathers in a swamp. Two wells in this marsh used for watering cattle are almost always full to the brim. One more pond the Lily or Kamar pond has been lately cleared. It lies below a much frequented Lingayat temple of Revansiddheshvar. The steps leading to the pond have been closed and the pond fitted with two wheels and iron chains and buckets. Below the pond and fed by its overflow is a swimming bath made for the use of the soldiers of the artillery, and recently handed by Government to the cantonment committee. Running water constantly passes through it, and, with the water from the springs which are found in the watercourse, forms a stream which flows through and past the Motibag and down the valley. While the artillery was at Sholapur the water from the swimming bath was used for growing vegetables. It is now used for field experiments by the agricultural class at the Sholapur high school. The regimental bazar was on the west and contained nine shops. The shopkeepers left when the troops were moved. The station is generally extremely clean and well kept, and, except as regards the site to which the filth and nightsoil are removed and the presence of grass meadows to the south, the sanitary arrangements are good. The conservancy establishment for the removal of sweepings consists of thirty-two road sweepers and twenty-four nightsoil-men. The hospital, an airy thatched building with regimental solitary cells close to it, lies on the west of the lines and has room for twenty sick men. The burial grounds for all castes in the cantonment are badly placed over the bank of the water-course close below the English graveyard.\n\nOn slightly rising ground, on the west bank of the Siddheshvar lake, in the south-west corner of the city, is Sholapur fort, an irregular oblong about 320 yards by 176, enclosed by a double line of lofty battlemented and towered walls of rough stone ten to twenty yards apart, and surrounded, except on the east or lake side, by a wet moat 100 to 150 feet broad and fifteen to thirty feet deep. The whole work is Muhammadan the outer wall dating from the fourteenth, and the inner wall and four great towers from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Except in times of flood two masonry walls at the north-east and south-east ends cut off the waters of the lake from the moat. In many years the moat is dry during the hot months. At other times, except a rocky ridge near the south-west corner, it holds six to ten feet of water. The outer wall, with battlemented curtains and four corner and twenty-three side towers, pierced for musketry and with openings and vaulted chambers for cannon, rises twenty to thirty feet from the edge of the moat. About twenty yards behind, the inner wall, also towered and battlemented, rises five to ten feet above the outer wall, and in the centre and east corner of the north wall and the centre and west corner of the south wall, is crowned by four massive square towers which rise about twenty feet above the rest of the battlements. The east face, whose foundations are sunk about twenty feet below high water level, has in the outer wall eight towers including a large tower that runs out from the south-east corner.\nThe inner wall has seven towers including the great tower at the north-east corner whose name is not known. The south face has, in the outer wall, two corner and four side towers, and six towers in the inner wall, two of which, the Hanum\u00e1n tower in the centre and an unnamed tower at the west corner, rise about twenty-three feet above the rest of the fortifications. In the west face the outer wall has two corner and four side towers, and the inner wall has two corner and seven side towers, the three to the south with plain and the three to the north with embattled parapets. In the north face the outer wall has five towers between the west corner and the gateway, where it stretches out in front with two massive towers joined by a strong two-storeyed curtain pierced both for sloping and downright musketry under which is the gateway. To the left of the gateway the wall sweeps to the north its whole length commanding the approach. The inner wall with five small and two huge square towers runs parallel to the inner wall of the south face. Behind the entrance outwork a strong towered and battlemented work crosses diagonally between the outer and the inner walls.\n\nThe way from the town to the fort lies through the Revni apparently a corruption of Ravelin also called the Killa or Fort gate, a doorless opening about twelve feet high and eight broad in a white-washed stone wall. Past the Revni gate, in a paved enclosure on the left shaded by a giant nim tree, is the tomb of Nabi Shah. Close in front, from the further bank of the broad deep moat, rise the massive double walls of the castle. The moat is crossed by a bridge ninety feet long and fourteen to twenty wide supported on wooden pillars. At the beginning of the bridge are two masonry pillars about eight feet high and four feet round joined by an iron chain which is smeared with redlead and worshipped. About half-way across the bridge is a second pair of stone pillars. In crossing the bridge there is a good view of the moat to the right, and to the left in the bed of the moat, almost hidden when the water is high but useful in the hot weather, is a cross-shaped well with flights of steps leading from three sides into the water. Across the bridge the entrance path turns sharp to the right, and between two massive towers and under a two-storeyed curtain pierced with slanting and guarded downright loopholes, the path passes through a pointed archway sixteen feet high by ten broad. The gate, formerly known as B\u00e1b Kh\u00e1rd\u00e1r and now as Kh\u00e1ti Darv\u00e1ja both meaning the Spike Gate, is slung on stone hinges. It is of wood covered with iron plates about four inches broad and a quarter of an inch thick laid at right angles and kept in their place by strong iron bolts. Between five and six feet from the ground the bolts end in spiked heads. On a small brass plate on the right half of the door is an inscription stating that the Spike Gate was repaired in A.D. 1810 (H. 1225). This gateway opens on an irregular walled enclosure,\n\n---\n\n1 Close to the right hand pillar is a Trigonometrical Survey stone with these words cut in it, '125 feet above datum and 25 feet above Railway Station bench mark.'\n\n2 The writing runs: The iron nails and bands were given for the repair of the gate by \u00c1baji Ball\u00e1l\u00ed, deputy commandant of the fort, during the command of Sad\u00e1shiv Pandit under the orders of Pandit Pr\u00e1dh\u00e1n B\u00e1jir\u00e1v in the reign of Sh\u00e1hu II, of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra 29th Muharram 1225 (that is about A.D. 1810).\nabout thirty-two yards long by thirty-two broad. Behind are the fortifications of the outer gateway, on the two sides short portions of the outer and inner walls, and a cross wall in front with a central arched gateway passing between two strong towers and under a two-storeyed curtain loopholed for musketry. The gateway which was formerly called Shahar Darv\u00e1ja or the City Gate and is now called Madhla Darv\u00e1ja or the Middle Gate, measures twenty feet high by twelve broad and twenty-three long. On each side of the outer mouth are two small neatly-carved Hindu pilasters. In a stone slab over the outer mouth of the gateway is a Persian writing to the effect that the gate was built by Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h II. (1656-1672) of Bij\u00e1pur. Inside of this gate the entrance formerly turned sharp to the right through a gateway called the Shahar Darv\u00e1ja or City Gate whose site is still marked by a bank of ruins. The space between the second gate and the inner wall stretches west in an irregular shape gradually growing narrower. On the right are the rough outer walls. To the left in an old Musalm\u00e1n building is the police guard. Behind are the inner walls about thirty-five feet high the curtain having been added on the top of the original curtain. Between the guard room and the inner wall there runs to the left a bare belt of grass about fifty feet broad. A closer view of the walls shows that a great number of the stones belong to old Hindu buildings. Most of them are plain dressed stones but a large number have mouldings and tracings and groups of animals and human figures, and a few have K\u00e1nares inscriptions. Passing across this second enclosure the path bends to the left to the third gateway formerly known as the Ali and now as the Mah\u00e1ngk\u00e1li gate. On the right is the massive wall of the Mah\u00e1ng or Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li tower. At the foot of the wall is a rough stone image apparently a human figure with the head bent forward. In front of the image is a brass arch or toran, and close by a small red flag. Seven bells of different sizes hang from the roof, some old carved Hindu stones are laid on one side, and on the other are some tridents and little stone oil vessels. Outside is a broken bull. This image is worshipped with oil and red paint and, according to the common story, is Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li, or as they pronounce the name Mah\u00e1ngk\u00e1li, the Great Mother, who tried to keep the British out of the fort but failing bowed her head as the troops passed in. The gateway is supported with massive side towers and overhead is a two-storeyed building with two slender minarets. The gateway has been twice altered, first probably under the Peshwa by raising the wall about five feet by filling with masonry the original battlements and adding a fresh curtain on the top, and lately under the British the chamber above the gateway has been turned into a dwelling and a large window opened outwards. Below the window, between carved griffins, is an engraved stone slab with an Arabic inscription. The gateway is arched in the pointed or Musalm\u00e1n style and is thirty-two feet high, thirteen broad, and twenty-one deep. The plain wooden gate has been taken out and lies on the ground to the right. Passing through the third gateway is the main body of the fort a flat about 250 yards long by 141 yards broad with some fine pipal and tamarind trees and a few scattered buildings surrounded.\nby the castle walls fifteen to twenty-one feet high. The walls have a step or terrace ten to fifteen feet broad and a curtain about five feet high in places flat topped and in other places notched with openings for cannon. The large flat towers, one on the north-east, Hanum\u00e1n in the centre of the south wall, one at the west corner of the north wall, and the Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li tower at the centre of the north wall rise about twenty-eight feet above the rest of the parapet. The walls are in fair repair a long stretch in the south-east having been lately renewed. Except the Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li tower, whose masonry covering was stripped off about twenty-six years ago, the towers are in good order. Of the 300 buildings, which, according to the local story, used to fill the enclosure, there remain in front of the entrance gate on either side two small houses used as a telegraph office, to the left an enclosed building formerly a powder magazine now empty, and in the south-west, along the west and the south wall, a line of small buildings used as stores. About the middle of the east and west faces two low arched passages lead to the belt between the outer and the inner wall.\n\nBesides many old Hindu stones ornamented with mouldings and tracery and a few with old Hindu inscriptions there are four chief objects of interest in the fort,\u00b9 the Jacha and Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li towers, the magazine, and some Hindu pillars under the north wall of the central enclosure. The Jacha or Pregnant Woman\u2019s tower is the second tower from the north-east corner of the east face of the outer wall. At the time of building the fort the foundations of this wall\n\n\u00b9 Three stones have been noticed with old Hindu writing. One with fairly clear letters is in the outer face of the east inner wall about five feet from the ground opposite the small pond in the passage between the outer and inner walls. On the inner face of the west outer wall near the south-west corner about six feet from the ground are two much-worn stones with letters. On the right side of the mouth of an old well in the north-east corner of the fort enclosure is a slab with writing in good preservation. Stones taken from Hindu buildings are found in all parts of the fort. Many of them are plain dressed stones which can easily be known among the rough undressed Musalm\u00e1n masonry. Of carved Hindu stones among the most notable are the prettily carved pilasters on either side of the middle gateway. Passing round the space between the outer and inner walls on the east side in the outer face of the inner wall are many carved stones and pieces of Hindu pillars cut down into square slabs. On the masonry supports of the water-bag on the side of the pond is a snake stone or ndgoba with two upright twined cobras, and opposite on the outer face of the inner wall is one of the inscribed stones and several stones with moulding and tracery. In the outer wall at the southeast corners are several engraved stones and two broken pillars on the top of a tower. In the inner wall is a Jain pillar and a fragment of an elephant frieze. In the south side the outer face of the outer wall has many engraved stones one near the middle of the south face with a double row of figures the top row carrying some one in a palanquin, the lower row of fighters. The Assyrian or honeysuckle pattern is carved on a stone a little to the west. On the outer face of the inner wall are also many engraved Hindu stones and on the west side in the inner face of the outer wall are stones with tracery and two old Hindu inscription stones, and on the outer face of the inner wall is a small undefaced stone with people worshipping the linga. In the inner wall on the south in the floor of the Hanum\u00e1n tower close to the slab with writing is a stone with tracery and an effaced central ornament. In the west parapet of the tower is a stone with some unbroken figures and on the north parapet of the steps leading to the tower are some damaged well carved figures. Further on is a stone with two small elephants and on the face of one of the steps are cut a row of swans. In the south-west tower the lintel of the gate is a Hindu pillar and there are four more Hindu pillars in the centre of the tower. In the west side in the vaulted gun chamber, which has the stone with Arabic letters, are two short very rich pillars with clear cut chain star and other mouldings.\nrepeatedly gave way. At last Br\u00e1hmans were consulted and said that the tower would never stand until a pregnant woman was buried alive under it. A Hindu, a Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1ni by caste, offered his brother's wife as a sacrifice and she was buried at the foot of the tower. In reward the V\u00e1ni was made p\u00e1t\u00edl of Shol\u00e1pur and the office is still held by his descendants. After the woman was buried her ghost haunted the lake, uttered strange noises, and caused much fear and annoyance. To appease her spirit the p\u00e1t\u00edl's family offered sacrifices at her tomb, and once a year, on the first day of Chaitra in March-April, the women of the family or the p\u00e1t\u00edl himself brings coconuts, oil, a robe or s\u00e1di, and a bodice for the woman and a little dhotar and a turban for the child. On that day a fair is held in her honour when people of all castes attend. The Musalm\u00e1ns admit that this sacrifice was offered under Musalm\u00e1n rule. They defend it by saying that it was arranged by the Hindu manager, and that the Musalm\u00e1n minister could not help himself as he had promised his master to finish the fort within a certain time. A similar story is told of the Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li or Mah\u00e1ngk\u00e1li tower in the centre of the north face of the inner wall. It has been noticed that the bowing figure to the right in entering the third or Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li gateway is said to be an image of the goddess Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li. The true story of this tower and image seems to be that like the Jacha tower its foundations gave way, and, according to the Br\u00e1hmans, the tower would never stand until a munja that is a thread-girt and unmarried Br\u00e1hman boy was buried alive under it. A Br\u00e1hman belonging to the Deshmukh family offered his son and was rewarded by a yearly grant of \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15) which is still paid. Once a year on the bright first of Chaitra in March-April the Hindus come with dates, coconuts and betelnuts which are taken by the members of the Deshmukh family. The Br\u00e1hmans say that the bowing figure is an image of the boy and that the name of the tower is Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l or the Great Time or Destroyer and that it has been corrupted into Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li by the common people.\u00b9 The powder magazine, now empty, to the west of the inner entrance gate, is an almost perfect specimen of a Hindu temple turned into a mosque. Except by whitewash the pillars are unchanged and some of them are gracefully and richly carved. At the foot of the north wall between the inner entrance and magazine an opening leads to part of an old Hindu temple richly carved and apparently in place.\n\nThe earliest trace of Shol\u00e1pur would seem to be about the end of the fourteenth century when its fort appears to have been built.\u00b2 In 1436, in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-din Sh\u00e1h Bahmani II. (1435-1457), the king's brother Muhammad, in the hope of making himself independent with the aid of the Vijaynagar king to whom he was sent to demand tribute, took Shol\u00e1pur and other neighbouring places. In 1511 Zain Kh\u00e1n, the brother of Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n of Paranda fort\n\n\u00b9 K\u00e1l the time spirit is one of the most dreaded of fiends. The same idea seems to be the cause of the great similarity in the European figures of time and death. It is to prevent K\u00e1l seizing the bride or bridegroom, that, at the wedding moment, rice is thrown, hands are clasped, music is played, and guns are fired.\n\n\u00b2 The Hem\u00e1dpanti temple remains in the fort are older and appear to belong to the twelfth or thirteenth century.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nSHOL\u00c1PUR.\n\nHistory.\n\nfifty miles to the north-west delivered Shol\u00e1pur to the Bij\u00e1pur regent Kam\u00e1lkh\u00e1n. In 1523 after one of their numerous wars Ismael of Bij\u00e1pur and Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m of Ahmadnagar met in the fort of Shol\u00e1pur and agreed to peace. In 1524 a quarrel led to a war between Bij\u00e1pur and Ahmadnagar. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h secured the aid of Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h king of Ber\u00e1r and of Amir Ber\u00edd regent of Bedar and the confederates marched with forty thousand men to besiege Shol\u00e1pur and to occupy the ceded districts. The attempt failed and the confederate army was completely routed. In 1542 Shol\u00e1pur was taken by Burh\u00e1n but next year restored to Bij\u00e1pur. In 1551 Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m, with the help of the Vijaynagar king R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, took Shol\u00e1pur and strengthened it. Some time after Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm the Bij\u00e1pur king made an attempt to take Shol\u00e1pur but his army was defeated in a battle on the plains of Shol\u00e1pur. In 1562 Shol\u00e1pur was given to Bij\u00e1pur as part of Ch\u00e1nd Bibi\u2019s dowry. In 1594 Burh\u00e1n failed in an attempt on Shol\u00e1pur under the walls of which his force was defeated. In 1623 Malik Ambar collected a large army and bringing grain from Daulatabad laid siege to Shol\u00e1pur and took it by storm. In 1636 under a treaty between Bij\u00e1pur and the Moghals the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi dynasty came to an end and it was settled that the forts of Shol\u00e1pur and Paranda with their dependent districts should be given to the Bij\u00e1pur king M\u00e1hmud Adil Sh\u00e1h (1626-1656). In 1668 in accordance with the terms of a treaty between Aurangzeb and Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur, Shol\u00e1pur fort passed to the Moghals. In 1686 when the final siege of Bij\u00e1pur began Aurangzeb\u2019s camp was at Shol\u00e1pur. In 1694 in one of their numerous raids the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s led by one R\u00e1mchandrapant levied contributions as far as Shol\u00e1pur. In 1723 on his throwing off his allegiance to the Moghal emperor Muhammed Sh\u00e1h (1720-1748) the fort and town of Shol\u00e1pur passed with Karm\u00e1la and other portions of north and west Shol\u00e1pur to the Niz\u00e1m. During the last Mar\u00e1tha war Shol\u00e1pur fort and town surrendered to General Munro on 14th May 1818 after a siege of four days.\n\nSON\u00c1RI.\n\nSon\u00e1ri, in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country about two miles east of the Shol\u00e1pur frontier, and about fifteen miles east of Karm\u00e1la, with in 1881 a population of 651, is an important place of pilgrimage at the temple of Bhairav\u00e1n\u00e1th. A fair attended by about 10,000 people from Shol\u00e1pur, Poon\u00e1, and Ahmadnagar is held in the last week of Chaitra or April-May. The inner part of Bhairav\u00e1n\u00e1th\u2019s temple from the shrine to the spire is old and of unknown date. The stone-hall or sabh\u00e1mandap in front is said to have been built about 1680 by the p\u00e1t\u00eds of Devgaon village about ten miles from Son\u00e1ri. The enclosing wall with rooms on its inner side were added by one of the Nimb\u00e1lkars, and the timber work of the hall was made about 1830 by Khando V\u00edththal T\u00e1kbh\u00e1te a merchant of Kharda in Ahmadnagar.\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 36.\n2 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 216.\n3 Details are given above p. 280.\n4 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 104-105.\n5 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 105-107.\n6 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 125.\n7 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 236.\n8 Elliot and Dowson, VI. 416.\n9 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 52.\n10 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 128-129.\n11 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 220.\n12 Details of the siege are given above pp. 296-300.\nWhile the Nimbaikars held Karmala in jaghir the whole revenue of Sonari was alienated for the use of this temple. At present the temple holds an inam land assessed at \u00a367 18s. (Rs. 679) of which it pays one-fourth as nazrana.\n\nAt Takli about twelve miles south-west of Sholapur a Lingayat was hanged in the village about seven years ago. The villagers afterwards saw visions which they thought were the Lingayat's ghost. The villagers took a stone about two feet long, carried it where the four roads met and buried it, and on full-moons and new-moons give him all food especially what he likes to eat.\u00b9\n\nTembhurni, on the Poona-Sholapur road in the extreme south of the Karmala sub-division, about fifteen miles south-west of Barsi Road station on the Peninsula railway, is a market town of some importance, with in 1881 a population of 2432. The weekly market is held on Friday. The growth of Tembhurni dates from its grant in inam to Sadashiv Manekshvar who built a fort now much out of repair and temples of Vithoba and Ram and a police station. It was held in inam for her life by the widow of Sadashiv's adopted son Lakshmanrao who died in 1879. Tembhurni is noted as the first place where carts were made in Sholapur.\u00b2 In 1827 Tembhurni had 1000 houses with twenty-two shops a watercourse and wells.\u00b3\n\nVairag, on the Barsi-Sholapur road about sixteen miles southeast of Barsi, is an important trade centre, with in 1872 a population of 7282 and in 1881 of 5467. A weekly market is held on Wednesday. In 1827 Vairag had 1200 houses.\u2074 In 1840 Vairag had 1663 houses and 6831 people. The houses increased to 2163 and the population to 9032 in 1849 but fell to 1373 houses and 7282 people in 1872. The 1872 census returns showed 6175 Hindus 1104 Musalmans and three Christians. Vairag was a place of considerable trade at the beginning of British rule. In 1840 Sir George Wingate found a considerable though much reduced transit trade at Vairag chiefly in groceries, betelnut, and pepper, of which about a thousand bullock-loads were yearly imported from Hubli in Dhawar, Harihar in Maisur, and other southern marts. These were exported by Vairag merchants, chiefly Lingayat Vanis, to the large marts of Mominabad, Nander, and Vasant in the Nizam's territories, and to many market towns in the Sholapur and Poona districts. Barsi and Sholapur had drawn away much of the Vairag trade, especially since 1820, and except in oil it had fallen to about one-fourth of the trade of Barsi.\u2075\n\nValsang, on the Sholapur-Akalkot road about fifteen miles southeast of Sholapur, is a market town of some importance, with in 1872 a population of 4179 and in 1881 of 3740. The weekly market is held on Wednesday. The town has a large dyeing and weaving industry, the yearly outturn being estimated at about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). This estimate includes the manufacture of indigo.\n\n\u00b9 Mr. C. J. Kyte.\n\u00b2 Bom. Gov. Sel. New Series, IV. II.\n\u00b3 Clunes' Itinerary, 27.\n\u2074 Clunes' Itinerary, 66.\n\u2075 Bom. Gov.

Women's robes woven of this silk are well known in the Karnatak as Valsang\u0101cha B\u0101nd and are worn by all classes except Br\u0101hmans. The industry is carried on by Koshtis and Bang\u0101rs sometimes weaving and dyeing together and sometimes separate.\n\nVa'phla, about six miles south of M\u0101dha, has a large slab (7' \u00d7 3') with a Devn\u0101gri inscription.\n\nVarkute, about fourteen miles south-east of Karm\u0101la, has an old half-built temple with twenty-one sculptured slabs arranged along the wall. The slabs are in excellent order.\n\nVela'pur, twenty miles north-west of Pandharpur, has a large Hem\u0101dpanti temple of Haranareshvar Mah\u0101dev. The temple has three inscriptions of four to seven lines, two dated 1300 and the third dated 1304 all in the reign of the ninth Devgiri Y\u0101dav king R\u0101mchandra (1271-1310). In his pursuit of the last Peshwa B\u0101jir\u0101v (1796-1817) in 1818 General Smith camped at Vel\u0101pur on the 19th of February the day previous to the final battle of Ashta which was fought about twenty-five miles east of Vel\u0101pur.\n\n---\n\n1 The inscriptions have not been completely deciphered but in all the dates and R\u0101mchandra's name are clear. All the inscriptions show a curious mixture of Sanskrit and Mar\u0101\u1e6dhi and give the name of one Devr\u0101v who appears to have repaired the temple.

Besides Akalkot proper, the State has six villages in the Malsiras sub-division of Sholapur and the village of Kurla in the Khatav sub-division of Satara. It has 106 villages and an estimated area of 498 square miles, a population in 1881 of 58,040 or 116 to the square mile, and in 1882 a gross revenue of \u00a323,500 (Rs. 2,35,000). Of 498 square miles, the total area of the State, 444 lie in Akalkot proper and fifty-four in the seven detached villages.\n\nExcluding the detached seven villages in Malsiras and Khatav, Akalkot is bounded on the north by the Nizam's territory, on the east by the Patvardhan's and Nizam's territory, on the south by the Indi sub-division of Bijapur and the Nizam's territory, and on the west by the Sholapur sub-division.\n\nAkalkot is an open rolling plain about 1200 feet above sea level. Except near villages which have mango groves, it is extremely bare of trees.\n\nBesides the Bhima which separates Akalkot from Indi and the Sina which for a few miles separates it from Sholapur in the north-west, the only river which runs through the State is the Bori, a feeder of the Bhima. The Bori enters the State in the north, and about ten miles lower is joined by the Harni. After a southerly course of about thirty miles it flows into the Bhima two miles west of Akalkot.\n\nThe water-supply is abundant, especially from wells which are numerous and eighteen to twenty feet deep. Except in the town of Akalkot where many wells are slightly brackish, the well water is excellent. Many large streams continue to run throughout the year. Except Akalkot which has a good sized reservoir, ponds are few and small.\n\nAkalkot lies entirely within the limits of the Deccan trap. A line of high ground forming a water-shed crosses the State obliquely from north-west to south-east, and divides it into two nearly equal parts of different character. South-west of the water-shed is a waving plain of mixed soil, watered by the Sina and Bhima which together bound this corner of the territory, and by a large stream which running nearly south falls into the Bhima near the village of Hili. On the river bank the soil is chiefly black, in the rest the soil is mixed, but black predominates. Below the black soil is crumbled trap or murum and below the murum at about forty feet is the trap. North-east of the water-shed the country is watered by the Bori and the Harni flanked by low ranges of flat-topped hills. Though in parts so strong as to prevent cultivation, the hills have generally a surface of shallow black soil, overlying layers of\n\n---\n\n1 From materials supplied by Mr. C. E. G. Crawford, C. S.\nred *murum* with basalt boulders. Some of the high ground is covered with loose black stones which by keeping the moisture in the soil is said to aid tillage instead of checking it. Except good lime nodules or *kankar*, Akalkot is poor in mineral products. Even good clay fit to make baked bricks and tiles is not found.\n\n**Climate.**\n\nThe hot season from mid-March to mid-June is probably the healthiest time of the year. The heat is seldom oppressive; a strong breeze from the west blows throughout a great part of the day, and the nights are generally cool and pleasant. Thunderstorms are not uncommon in April and May and cool the air for two or three days. To the middle of June the temperature ranges from 73\u00b0 to 104\u00b0. The rainy season lasts from the middle of June to the middle of October, with a climate for the most part pleasant and cool, but becoming oppressive towards the middle of September. The close of the monsoon is the most unhealthy time of the year, when fever and ague, diarrhoea, and dysentery prevail. The cold season is very pleasant, the cold never being excessive. The sky is frequently overcast towards the middle of December, and a few showers fall, of the greatest value to *ju\u00e1ri* the staple cold weather crop. The prevailing winds from March to November are from the west and south-west, and from November to the end of February from the east, north-east, and north. Dysentery, diarrhoea, and fevers both remittent and intermittent, are the commonest diseases. Much guineaworm is caused by the lower classes wading to their knees in the wells when filling their water jars. At Akalkot this disease, which was terribly common, has been checked by building a wall round a chief well.\n\n**Rainfall.**\n\nThe rainfall is scanty, uncertain, and variable. In 1855 it was 32\u00bd inches and between 1866 and 1868 the average fell to twenty-three inches; since then the average has risen to between thirty and thirty-five inches.\n\n**Forests.**\n\nAkalkot has little forest land and few plantations. The only timber trees are *b\u0101thuls* Acacia arabica and *nims* Azadirachta indica, which are barely enough to meet local demand. Other timber is imported, chiefly from Shol\u00e1pur. Colonel Baumgartner planted a few teak and jack trees with success. In 1882, in forty-four villages about 20,000 acres have been set apart as forest reserves. The chief\u2019s garden at Akalkot has large groves of cocoa and areca palms and mango and other fruit trees.\n\n**Animals.**\n\nAs the grazing lands or *kurans* are the private property of the chief, there is little hay, and other fodder, especially *kadbi* or millet stalks, is dear. This checks the breeding of cattle and sheep which are inferior both in size and quality. Wild animals, especially of the larger kinds, are almost unknown. There are no tigers and panthers; jackals and foxes are common, and wolves are occasionally found. In the chief\u2019s grazing lands antelopes are preserved, but are not numerous.\n\n**Birds.**\n\nGame birds are few. Bustard are rare; and in the chief\u2019s *kurans* a few florican are found during the rains. The painted or common partridge, quail, and even sandgrouse are rarely found in any quantity.\nAccording to the 1881 census, Akalkot had a population of 58,040, of whom 50,448 (25,547 males and 24,901 females) or 86.92 per cent were Hindus, 7590 (3921 males and 3669 females) or 13.08 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, and two Christians. Among Hindus there are about 3000 Br\u00e1hmans, 2000 V\u00e1nis, 20,000 Ling\u00e1yats, 8000 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 3000 Kolis, 5000 Dhangars, 2000 P\u00e1nch\u00e1ls, and 7000 Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs. The Musalm\u00e1ns are mostly Sunnis. Of craftsmen there are about 9000 weavers and spinners. The weavers are chiefly Kosht\u00eds, Ling\u00e1yats, Panchams, and S\u00e1l\u00eds, and the spinners are Ling\u00e1yats, V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Kolis, Mh\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Of other craftsmen carpenters, smiths, and shoemakers are only of local consequence.\n\nLand is more or less watered, chiefly from wells and sometimes by budk\u00eds or lifts near river banks. It is seldom watered by fair-weather dams and channels. Except when planted with sugar-cane which yields only one crop, watered lands yield two crops, s\u00e1li rice as a khar\u00edf or early crop and jv\u00e1ri or other grain as a rabi or late crop.\n\nOf the early or khar\u00edf crops the chief are baj\u00edri spiked millet Penicillaria spicata, tur Cajanus indicus, amb\u00e1di hemp Hibiscus cannabinus, k\u00e1pis cotton Gossypium herbaceum, and erandi castor-seed Ricinus communis. Of the late or rabi crops the staple is jv\u00e1ri Indian millet Sorghum vulgare. In the north the khar\u00edf and in the south and west and on the banks of the Bori the rabi crops yield the heaviest outturn.\n\nMoneylending is carried on in the same way as in Shol\u00e1pur. The chief moneylenders are Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis and some M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1nis and local Br\u00e1hmans. For a husbandman the rate of interest is heavy, as much as four per cent a month on personal security and two per cent on mortgages. There is no mint in the State, and the Imperial rupee is the current coin.\n\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway runs north-west and south-east for eighteen miles. It has one station at Karabgaon, about seven miles south-west of Akalkot. The station is joined to Akalkot by a metalled road. In an ordinary year Karabgaon station has little traffic as it mostly goes to Shol\u00e1pur by road. During the scarcity of 1871 and the famine of 1876 grain largely came to Karabgaon by rail. Besides the metalled road to Karabgaon station a made road runs north-west to Shol\u00e1pur from Akalkot. The chief exports are jv\u00e1ri and cotton piecegoods. The chief imports are from Shol\u00e1pur and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory wheat and pulse; from Shol\u00e1pur, European cotton twist, salt, cocoanut oil, iron and copper ware, cotton piecegoods and silk, bangles, betelnuts, dates, and black pepper; from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, indigo; from Bij\u00e1pur clarified butter and native twist; and from Kaly\u00e1n tanned hides. The former transit trade which the Vanj\u00e1ris carried through Akalkot from Shol\u00e1pur to Kulbarga, R\u00e1ichur, Kaly\u00e1n, and other towns in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory has now passed by the railway.\n\nOf crafts the chief is the weaving of country cloth, mostly women\u2019s robes, bodicecloths, shouldercloths, waistcloths, turbans, and coarse cloth or kh\u00e1di. Of about 9000 persons connected with the weaving\nindustry, about 2000 are weavers and the rest are spinners. There are about 1200 looms, which in a good year yield an outturn worth about \u00a350,000 (Rs. 5 l\u0101khs).\n\nThe State was surveyed between 1866 and 1871. According to this survey, excluding alienated and leased villages, the State has an area of 295,571 acres, of which about 93,800 acres of the worst land were lying waste in 1882-83. The average acre rate on arable land is about 1s. 6d. (12 as.). Since the introduction of the survey, a considerable area of land has been yearly thrown up, chiefly because under the chief\u2019s management husbandmen were allowed to take b\u00e1gayat or garden land only on the condition of taking a certain amount of jir\u00e1yat or dry-crop land, while under the survey husbandmen are free to take either. Of late the demand of land for tillage has increased.\n\nJustice is now administered in accordance with the principles of British law. The State has one ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish\u2019s, one m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s, and two mah\u00e1lkaris\u2019 courts. The ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish has the powers of a district magistrate and decides civil suits of any value. The m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r has the powers of a second class magistrate and the mah\u00e1lkaris of a third class magistrate. Besides acting as magistrates, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r and mah\u00e1lkaris decide civil suits of not more than \u00a350 (Rs. 500). The Political Agent has the powers of a Judge and Sessions Judge and his assistant in immediate charge of the State, of an Assistant Judge and Sessions Judge. The Governor in Council is the highest appellate court. Besides the shiband\u00ed police of forty-one men who are dressed and armed like the sepoys of a native infantry regiment, the State has the regular police of seventy-one men paid in cash, and a body of 268 village police paid partly in cash and partly by rent-free lands.\n\nOf about \u00a323,500 (Rs. 2,35,000), the gross revenue of the State in 1882-83, the land revenue amounted to \u00a314,880 (Rs. 1,48,800) and the local fund cess to \u00a31130 (Rs. 11,300).\n\nIn 1882-83 the State had nineteen schools with an average attendance of 664 maintained at a yearly cost of about \u00a3490 (Rs. 4900).\n\nIn 1871 a dispensary was started at Akalkot which is in charge of a hospital assistant. In 1882-83 at this dispensary 8940 patients were treated and 2620 persons were vaccinated.\n\nAkalkot is the only town in the State with a population of about 8500. The town lies two miles west of the Bori river in a hollow commanded by a spur of higher ground surrounding the vale. It was once fortified by a wall and a ditch. The wall is much ruined and the ditch is partly filled. It has no large building. Near the town is a fine and well shaded garden belonging to the chief, which has groves of mango, cocoa-palm, betel-palm, and other fruit trees. Besides Akalkot the chief villages are Chapalgaon, Jeur, Karajgi, Mangrul, N\u00e1gansur, Tolnur, and V\u00e1gdari.\n\nThe separate history of Akalkot does not begin until the early part of the eighteenth century. During the sixteenth century it was part of the debateable Shol\u00e1pur district, which so often proved a cause of war between Bij\u00e1pur and Ahmadnagar. In the beginning\nof the seventeenth century it was held by Ahmadnagar as at that time Malik Ambar\u2019s settlement was introduced into its villages. In 1707 after the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb, Sh\u00e1hu Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s grandson, who had been in confinement since his father Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s death in 1689, was set free by Aurangzeb\u2019s successor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h. On his return to the Deccan Sh\u00e1hu encamped at Par\u00e1d, a small village in the Shivri sub-division of Aurangabad. Here he was attacked by Say\u00e1ji, the headman of the village, who appears to have been a partisan of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed the widow of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m who was struggling with Sh\u00e1hu for the Mar\u00e1tha headship. In the fight Say\u00e1ji was defeated and killed. His widow taking her three little boys, threw herself at Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s feet and implored his forgiveness and protection. The kindhearted Sh\u00e1hu, moved with pity, offered to take care of R\u00e1noji the eldest of the children. The mother gladly agreed, and received from Sh\u00e1hu the villages of Par\u00e1d, Shivri, and Th\u00e1na in mok\u00e1s\u00e1 in\u00e1m. R\u00e1noji, who was a good-looking lad of about ten, soon won the favour of Sh\u00e1hu. On the way to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the force was attacked by a band of highwaymen. The nominal command of the detachment employed to disperse this band was given to the boy R\u00e1noji. They promptly dispersed the banditti and in reward for his first success Sh\u00e1hu changed the child\u2019s name to Fattehsing. In 1712 Sh\u00e1hu took Fattehsing into his family, and gave him the family surname of Bhonsle and the Akalkot state in hereditary j\u00e1gir. Among other campaigns Fattehsing went on an expedition to Kolhapur in 1718, to Bandelkhand in 1730, to Bh\u00e1g\u00e1nagar in the Karn\u00e1tak, and to Trichin\u00e1poli in the train of the Pratini\u00e1di and R\u00e1ghoji Bhonsle in 1818. In 1749 on the death of his patron Sh\u00e1hu, Fattehsing retired to Akalkot, where he died in 1760. He had two wives Ahaly\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed and Guj\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed, who both became satis on his death. Fattehsing was succeeded by his nephew Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, son of his brother B\u00e1b\u00e1ji Lokhande, p\u00e1t\u00edl of Par\u00e1d, whom five years before his death with the Peshwa\u2019s sanction he had adopted. In 1760 on his death Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji was succeeded by his son Fattehsing also called Ab\u00e1s\u00e1heb. A dispute between Fattehsing and his brother Tulj\u00e1ji was settled by the cession to Tulj\u00e1ji of the village of Kurla in the Khat\u00e1v sub-division in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\u00b9 On the 3rd of July 1820 the Honourable East India Company entered into an agreement with Fattehsing restoring to him the estates which with the rest of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territories had come into the possession of the British Government. In 1822 Fattehsing died and was succeeded by his son M\u00e1l\u00f3ji. In 1828 M\u00e1l\u00f3ji died and was succeeded by his son Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, who was eight years old. During the minority of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra assumed the management of the State. In 1830, certain changes introduced by the R\u00e1ja in 1829 led to a rising headed by Shankar-r\u00e1v sardeshmukh of Borgaon. To quell this rising a British force was sent from Shol\u00e1pur to Akalkot. It met with severe resistance, and the rebels did not yield till the Resident at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra offered an amnesty. Inquiry showed that the people had received much\n\n\u00b9Kurla has a yearly revenue of about \u00a3423 (Rs. 4230) and is still (1884) held by Tulj\u00e1ji\u2019s grandsons.\nprovocation from the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and a British officer Captain Jameson was appointed regent of the State during Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji's minority. In 1849, on the annexation of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the chief of Akalkot became a feudatory of the British Government. In 1857 Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji died and was succeeded by his son M\u00e1l\u00f3ji. In 1866 M\u00e1l\u00f3ji was deposed for misrule and died in 1870. M\u00e1l\u00f3ji left an infant son Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, the present chief who was born in 1867. The chief of Akalkot, sur-named Bhonsle, is a Mar\u00e1tha by caste and ranks as a first class sard\u00e1r of the Deccan. He is entitled to no salute. He does not pay tribute, but in lieu of the contingent of horse stipulated in the agreement of 1820 pays a commuted yearly allowance to the British Government of \u00a31459 4s. (Rs. 14,592). Since 1866 the State has been under British management. At present (1883) it is in charge of the assistant collector of Shol\u00e1pur under the Collector of Shol\u00e1pur as Political Agent.\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nThe following notes on the birds of the district are contributed by Mr. J. Davidson, C. S.:\n\n2. OTOGYPS CALVUS. (Scop.)\nThis is the only true vulture resident in the district, and is fairly common, a pair being found for nearly every half dozen villages. Their nests are generally on high trees in the neighbourhood of villages and contain eggs from the end of December to the beginning of March.\n\n4. BIS-GYPS PALLESCENS. (Hume.)\n\n5. PSUEDOGYPYS BENGALENSIS. (Gmel.)\nBoth these vultures are seldom seen but they must often cross the district though probably at a great height as one sometimes finds one or two of them in company with the otogyps feeding on any stray carcass that has escaped the Mh\u00e1rs.\n\n6. NEOPHRON GINGINIANUS. (Latham.)\nIs common everywhere, breeding from February to April upon the roofs of temples and also upon trees when the roofs are not available.\n\n11. FALCO JUGGER. (Gray.)\nA permanent resident, fairly common through the dry part of the district, breeding from January to April.\n\n16. FALCO CHIQUERA. (Daud.)\nMuch more common than F. jugger; a very noisy bird, breeding generally on mango trees in gardens from February to April.\n\n17. CERCHNEIS TINNUNGULUS. (Lin.)\nA common cold weather visitant.\n\n18. CERCHNEIS NAUMANNI. (Fleisch.)\nA large flock of a small kestrel, presumably this, was seen by the writer once in January; unfortunately none were shot and it may have been the eastern form C. pekinensis. (Swinh.)\n\n23. ASTUR BADIUS. (Gmel.)\nCommon wherever there are gardens with mango trees, breeding in March and April.\n\n24. ACCIPITER NISUS. (Lin.)\nThe English Sparrow Hawk, is a fairly common cold weather visitant.\n\n27. AQUILA MOGILNIK. (Gm.)\nThe Imperial eagle is very rare; one immature specimen was shot in the rains.\n\n28. AQUILA CLANGA. (Pall.)\nRare.\n\n29. AQUILA VINDHIANA. (Frankl.)\nThe common eagle of the district, being very common everywhere but in the deep black soil part. Its nests generally built on low b\u00e1dhul trees may be found with eggs depending on the season from the middle of September till the end of February.\n\n31. HIER\u00c6TUS PENNATUS. (Gmel.)\nIs rare but may occasionally be found sitting on the banks of the rivers of the district. As it is little larger than a kite it is often passed over.\n\n---\n\n1 The marginal numbers on the left side correspond with those found in Captain Butler's Catalogue of the Birds of the southern portion of the Bombay Presidency (1880).\nAppendix A.\n\nBirds.\n\n33. NISA\u00cbTUS FASCIATUS. (Vieill.)\n   By no means uncommon in the district, breeding in January on high trees; the enormous size of the nest at once distinguishing its habitation from that of the 'Wokhab.'\n\n38. CIRCA\u00cbTUS GALLICUS. (Gmel.)\n   A not uncommon bird in the bare part of the district from September till March. It may easily be recognized from its white breast, huge eyes, and habit of hovering like a kestrel.\n\n39. BIS-SPILORNIS MELANOTIS. (Jerd.)\n   A rare visitant.\n\n45. BUTEO FEROX. (S. G. Gmel.)\n   Very rare; only one specimen having been obtained.\n\n48. BUTASTUR TEESA. (Frankl.)\n   Formerly very common, but since the famine it is decidedly scarcer; it breeds in the end of March and beginning of April.\n\n51. CIRCUS MACRURUS. (S. G. Gmel.)\n   Is very common from September till March and sometimes from the end of August.\n\n54. CIRCUS \u00c4ERUGINOSUS. (Lin.)\n   Also a not uncommon cold weather visitant.\n\n55. HALLASTUR INDUS. (Bodd.)\n   Not common but found along the Bhima; breeds about March.\n\n56. MILVUS GOVINDA. (Sykes.)\n   Common everywhere, breeding from September to March.\n\n57. PERNIS PTILORHYNCHUS. (Tem.)\n   Not common in the district.\n\n59. ELANUS CERULEUS. (Degf.)\n   Was formerly far from common. Since the scarcity is the commonest bird of prey in the district; half a dozen pairs are almost certain to be seen in any morning ride. No bird's nest is easier to find than this, as while building, with eggs or young the old birds are almost always flying round the tree containing the nest chasing away other birds of prey or crows and adding stick after stick to the nest long after the eggs are laid. In spite of all this care the nest, which is generally on a low b\u00e2b\u00e2ul tree near a water-course, is a mere platform of sticks. The birds seem to breed twice a year once in January and February and again in June and July.\n\n60. STRIX JAVANICA. (Gm.)\n   Moderately common, breeding in January and February.\n\n65. SYRNIUM OCCELLATUM. (Less.)\n   Naturally rare as might be expected in such a treeless district as Shol\u00e2pur, but found in several of the B\u00e2rsi villages and also at Akalkot.\n\n68. ASIO ACCIPITRINUS. (Pall.)\n   Very common in the cold weather among long grass, numbers being started in a beat for florican.\n\n69. BUBO BENGALENSIS. (Frankl.)\n   Common along the rivers and water-courses; breeding in November and December in holes in banks.\n\n74. SCOPS PENNATUS. (Hodgs.)\n   A small-eared owl identified as this is found occasionally all through the district.\n\n76. CARINE BRAMA. (Tem.)\n   The \"Punch and Judy Owl\" is very common everywhere, breeding in hollow trees in February March and April.\n\n81. NINOX LUGUBRIS. (Tick.)\n   Rare.\n\nThe small birds are fairly numerous in species but few in actual numbers, and many of the migrants merely pass through the district going and returning. The following have actually been observed:\n\n82. HIRUNDO RUSTICA. (Lin.)\n   Common in the cold weather.\n84. HIRUNDO FILIFERA. (Steph.)\n   Fairly common, breeding in the rains in wells.\n\n85. HIRUNDO ERYTHROPYGIA. (Sykes.)\n   Common, breeding in old buildings everywhere.\n\n86. HIRUNDO FLUVICOLA. (Jerd.)\n   Very local, the only breeding place known is under the railway bridge at the Motibag tank where there are generally some hundred nests, and eggs may almost always be found.\n\n89. COTYLE SINENSIS. (Gray.)\n   Found along the rivers in the cold weather, occasionally breeds both then and in the hot weather.\n\n90. PTYONOPROGNE CONCOLOR. (Sykes.)\n   Common, breeding twice a year frequently in the verandas of bungalows.\n\n98. CYPSELLUS MELBA. (Lin.)\n   Has been noticed singly on one or two occasions in the end of the rains.\n\n100. CYPSELLUS AFFINIS. (Gray.)\n   Abundant everywhere, breeding in the rains and probably at other seasons under almost every village gate.\n\n102. CYPSELLUS BATASSIENSIS. (Gray.)\n   Naturally very rare but a flock of some twenty were continually flying round two toddy-palm trees near Karmala and probably they bred among the leaves but no one could climb the trees.\n\n107. CAPRIMULGUS INDICUS. (Lath.)\n   Rare, but probably breeds.\n\n112. CAPRIMULGUS ASIATICUS. (Lath.)\n   Also tolerably common in the barer parts. Breeds in June.\n\n117. MEROPS VIRIDIS. (Lin.)\n   Very common everywhere, breeding in holes along the roadsides in April.\n\n120. MEROPS FERSICUS. (Pall.)\n   A small flock seen near Pandharpur in October 1877.\n\n123. CORACIAS INDICA. (Lin.)\n   Is very common from about the end of September till the hot weather when it leaves. It does not breed in the district.\n\n129. HALCYON SMYRNIENSIS. (Lin.)\n   Fairly common, breeding in banks and old wells, from April to June.\n\n134. ALCEDO BENGALENSIS. (Gmel.)\n   Is not common in Sholapur. It probably does not breed in the district.\n\n136. CERULEO RUDIS. (Lin.)\n   Is common along all the rivers, breeding through the rains or cold weather.\n\n148. PAL\u00c6ORNIS TORQUATUS. (Bodd.)\n   Swarms everywhere, breeding in holes in trees where they are to be found; when not obtainable, in holes in village walls and temples from November to February.\n\n149.

Mull.)\n   Is common in the gardens during the rains but leaves the district at the beginning of the cold weather and does not return till the rains are well set in.\n\n160. PICUS MAHRATTENSIS. (Lath.)\n   Not common, but among the babul trees along the rivers a few are always to be found at all seasons.\n\n188. YUNX TORQUILLA. (Lin.)\n   The wryneck is common in the cold weather.\n\n197. XANTHOL\u00c6MA H\u00c6MACEPHALA. (Mull.)\n   Is rare in the district but is a permanent resident.\n\n199. CUCULUS CANORUS. (Lin.)\n   Has been noticed in the beginning of the rains.\n\n201. CUCULUS POLIOCEPHALUS. (Lath.)\n   Noticed in the cold weather and end of the rains.\n\n203. CUCULUS MICROPTERUS. (Gould.)\n   Common in the rains.\nAppendix A.\n\n212. COCCYSTES JACOBINUS. (Bodd.)\nCommon during the rains, and seen occasionally at other times.\nThe writer took one of its eggs from a nest of Chatarrh\u00e6a caudata in September 1879.\n\n214. EUDYNAMIS HONORATA. (Lin.)\nThe koei is common wherever there are gardens with mango trees, and the writer has taken its eggs (in one case two from one nest) from the nests of both C. splendens and C. macrorhynchos.\n\n217. CENTROCOCCYX RUFIPEPINIS. (Ill.)\nThis bird is fairly common and nests as a rule during the rains.\nThe writer has however found nests in the cold weather.\n\n232. CINNYRIS ZEYLONICA. (Lin.)\nThis honeyeater is very scarce in the district. It is fairly common in Pandharpur and S\u00e4ngola and the writer has once or twice noticed it in Sholapur and Karmala, but it seems to shun the eastern parts of the district. It nests early in the rains, in the cold weather, and again in the hot.\n\n234. CINNYRIS ASIATICA. (Lath.)\nThis is much commoner than the last and is found all over the district; it breeds as far as can be seen only once a year in May June and July.\n\n254. UPUPA EPOPS. (Lin.)\nIs a winter visitant and probably not uncommon.\n\n255. UPUPA CEYLONENSIS. (Reich.)\nA not uncommon resident, building in holes in village walls and chaidis in April and May.\n\n256. LANIUS LAHTORA. (Sykes.)\nThis is the common shrike in Sholapur, and may be found everywhere. It breeds probably twice a year once in March and again from May to July.\n\n257. LANIUS ERYTHRONOTUS. (Vigors.)\nThis shrike has been only noticed in Sholapur from September to February and even then is far from common. It certainly does not breed unless in B\u00e1rsi.\n\n260. LANIUS VITATUS. (Valence.)\nThis shrike is common enough during the end of the rains and cold weather but the vast majority leave in February. A few however remain all the year and may perhaps breed.\n\n268. VOLVOCIVORA SYKESI. (Strickl.)\nPasses through the district in April and October. A few seen in the winter.\n\n276. PERICROCOTUS PERIGRINUS. (Lin.)\nIs a common bird among the gardens and breeds early in the rains, generally choosing a small b\u00e1bhul or some milk-bush as the situation for its nest.\n\n277. PERICROCOTUS ERYTHROPYGIUS. (Jerd.)\nA small flock of these were seen by the writer once in the S\u00e4ngola sub-division.\n\n278. BUCHANGA ATRA. (Herm.)\nThe king crow is common everywhere, breeding in May and June.\n\n281. BUCHANGA C\u00c6RULESCENS. (Lin.)\nOnce or twice noticed as a straggler in the cold weather.\n\n288. MUSCIPETA PARADISI.

(Vieill.)\n293. LEUCOCERCA LEUCOGASTER. (Cuv.)\nBoth these little fantails are found occasionally during the cold weather, but neither remains permanently.\n\n297. ALSEONAX LATIROSTRIS. (Raff.)\nA cold weather visitant.\n\n301. STOPORALA MELANOPS. (Vigors.)\nAlso a cold weather visitant.\n\n305. CYORNIS TICKELLI. (Blyth.)\nOccasionally found through the district at all seasons.\n307. CYORNIS RUPICAUDUS. (Swains.)\nOne specimen only procured, so evidently a mere straggler.\n\n323. BIS-ERYTHROSTERNA PARVA. (Bechst.)\nCommon in the cold weather; may often be found perched on one's tent ropes.\n\n348. PITTA BRACHYURA. (Lin.)\nThis beautiful bird is not rare in April or October, but the writer has never seen it except in these months.\n\n351. CYANOCINCLUS CYANUS. (Lin.)\nCommon during the cold weather.\n\n353. PETROPHILA CINCLORHYNCHA. (Vigors.)\nIs not uncommon in the end of the rains but does not seem to be found at any other time.\n\n385. PYCTORIS SINENSIS. (Gmel.)\nIs not common in the district and the writer has never found its nest there.\n\n436. ARGYA MALCOLMI. (Sykes.)\nThis is the common large babbler in Sholapur, and is fairly common; breeding all through the rains.\n\n438. CHATARRH\u00c6A CAUDATA. (Dum.)\nIs very common and breeds at all seasons except the actual hot weather.\n\n462. MOLPASTES HEMORRHOUS. (Gmel.)\nThis is the common bulbul at Sholapur and breeds in the rains.\n\n468. IORA TIPHIJA. (Lin.)\nThis bird in the Zeylonica type is common and breeds in the rains generally in a milkbush hedge, but occasionally on small babhul trees and at times in gardens.\n\n470. ORIOLUS KUNDOO. (Sykes.)\nCommon, breeding in June and July.\n\n475. COPSYCHUS SAULARIS. (Lin.)\nIs a rare bird in the district and generally found singly. It does not seem to breed within the limits of the district.\n\n479. THAMNOBIA FULICATA. (Lin.)\nIs very common everywhere; the specimens however are hardly typical \"fulicata,\" there being a brownish tinge on the back. It breeds abundantly about houses from April to July.\n\n481. PRATINCOLA CAPRATA. (Lin.)\nModerately common but most of the birds leave the district in the hot weather. The only nest taken in Sholapur was in July.\n\n483. PRATINCOLA INDICUS. (Blyth.)\nVery common in winter.\n\n497. RUTICILLLA RUFIVENTRIS. (Vieill.)\nAlso common in the cold weather.\n\n507. LARVIVORA SUPERCILIARIS. (Jerd.)\nNot uncommon in the end of the rains and beginning of the cold weather.\n\n530. ORTHOTOMUS SUTORIUS. (F\u00f6rst.)\nThe tailor bird is fairly common, breeding in the early rains.\n\n534. PRINIA SOCIALIS. (Sykes.)\nThis tailor bird which however does not sew its nest into a leaf as an orthodox tailor bird ought to do, is not nearly so common as the last. It also breeds in the rains.\n\n539. CISTICOLA CURSITANS. (Frankl.)\nCommon in the grass kurans and generally on waste lands. It breeds in the rains.\n\n543. DRYMECA INORNATA. (Sykes.)\nThis is the common plainly plumaged warbler, found everywhere in the district. August and September are the two months it breeds in and its nest is generally suspended from some low branch between two fields; its eggs, blue marked with claret patches and lines, are about the prettiest eggs ever known.\n\n553. HYPOLAIS RAMA. (Sykes.)\nNot uncommon.\n\n581. SYLVIA JERDONI. (Blyth.)\nCommon in the cold weather.\nAppendix A.\n\nBirds.\n\n589. MOTACILLA MADERASPATENSIS. (Gm.)\nCommon and a very familiar bird; a pair breeding every year in one of the boats in the boat-house on the Motibag tank. It generally breeds again during the end of the cold weather.\n\n591. MOTACILLA DUKHUNENSIS. (Sykes.)\nA winter visitant but not at all uncommon at that season.\n\n593. BUDYTES CINEREOCAPILLA. (Savi.)\n594. BUDYTES CITREOLA. (Pallas.)\nBoth birds are fairly common during the cold weather and latter end of the rains but are only winter migrants.\n\n596. PIPASTES MACULATUS. (Hodgs.)\nRather rare, but noticed several times during the winter.\n\n600. CORYDALLA RUFULA. (Vieill.)\nVery common in the cold weather. Does not however as far as has been noticed ever remain and breed in this district.\n\n660. CORVUS MACRORHYNCHUS. (Wagler.)\nThe large black crow is common everywhere, breeding generally in the end of the hot weather but sometimes at the very beginning of the rains. It is not generally as familiar as the gray crow but it occasionally builds on small trees in large towns in the same way.\n\n663. CORVUS SPLENDENS. (Vieill.)\nThe gray crow is very common everywhere, breeding from May to July.\n\n684. ACRIDOTHERES TRISTIS. (Lin.)\nThe common maina is plentiful everywhere and breeds in this district only during the end of the hot weather and the rains.\n\n687. STURNIA PAGODARUM. (Gmel.)\nThe blackcrested starling is a rarish bird in the district, and although it has been seen nearly every month it does not seem to breed there.\n\n690. PASTOR ROSEUS. (Lin.)\nThe jvori bird. This bird is very common from the end of the rains till the jvori fields are cut in February. The birds roost and spend the middle of the day in the babhul groves along the water-courses and sally out from them into the jvori to which they do a great deal of damage. They are difficult to drive off if babhuls are near to which they can fly for shelter, and this is one of the reasons why the plantation of such groves by the forest department is so unpopular in the Deccan.\n\n694. PLOCEUS PHILIPPINUS. (Lin.)\nThe weaver bird is very common and its nests may be found hanging from the babhul trees along almost all the water-courses and above old wells; the eggs are laid in July and August.\n\n699. AMADINA PUNCTULATA. (Lin.)\nIs very rare in the district. A pair was only noticed on one occasion and that was during the rains.\n\n703. AMADINA MALABARICA. (Lin.)\nIs excessively common, making its round grass nest at all seasons in the nearest thorny bush. The young cling to the nest long after they are able to fly.\n\n706. PASSER INDICUS. (Jerd. and Selby.)\nThe Indian sparrow is as much a nuisance here as everywhere else.\n\n711. GYMNORIS FLAVICOLLIS. (Frankl.)\nIs decidedly a rare bird in the district. The writer obtained one nest on the banks of the Bhima in April 1877, and the bird has been seen on a few other occasions.\n\n721. EUSPIZA MELANOCEPHALA. (Scop.)\nIs a common winter visitant joining with the weaver birds in plundering the corn fields.\n\n722. EUSPIZA LUTROLA. (Sparrm.)\nNoticed on one or two occasions but it is not nearly as common as the last.\n756 MIRAFRA ERYTHROPTERA. (Jerd.)\nThis lark is very common in the northern and western parts of the district but is found nearly everywhere. It is one of the species that has increased in numbers since the scarcity. It is a permanent resident and breeds. Its nests are found well concealed and very difficult to discover.\n\n758 AMMOMANES PHENICURA. (Frankl.)\nThe redtailed finchlark is the commonest lark in the ploughed fields, and may be seen everywhere. Its nest is more like a robin's than a lark's and is placed on the sides of banks and tufts of grass.\n\n760. PYRHBULAUDA GRISEA. (Scop.)\nThe blackbreasted finchlark called erroneously by many sportsmen the ortolan, abounds everywhere and seems to breed at all seasons.\n\n765. SPIZALAUZA DEVA. (Sykes.)\nThis bird is very numerous but does not breed till the middle of the rains. Its slight crest and reddish plumage at once distinguish it from any of the other Sholapur larks.\n\nThe Sholapur district, though a bare waterless country is fairly rich in waders, and there are a good many game birds, doves, and wild fowl. They include the following species:\n\n773. CROCOPUS CHLORIGASTER. (Blyth.)\nThe green pigeon is a very rare bird and the writer has only twice observed it, once in the Sholapur head-quarter station and again out in the Barsi sub-division.\n\n788. COLUMBA INTERMEDIA. (Strickl.)\nThe ordinary wild pigeon is very common in the district, and simply swarms in the numerous wells in the Madha and Sangola sub-divisions, and any number can be shot or snared for pigeon shooting in some places. The villagers however dislike their being snared or netted and encourage them by building their wells with holes specially constructed for the pigeons to nest in.\n\n794. TURTUR SENEGALENSIS. (Lin.)\nThis is the commonest dove of the district, feeding in the villages and along the roads, and breeding at all seasons. Its favourite nesting place is a prickly pear bush but it is not particular.\n\n795. TURTUR SURATENSIS. (Gmel.)\nThis dove needs a damper climate than Sholapur and is accordingly only found there during the rains. Even at that season it is very local.\n\n796. TURTUR RISORIUS. (Lin.)\nThe large gray ringdove is common all through the district and breeds, probably at all seasons.\n\n797. TURTUR TRANQUEBARICUS. (Herm.)\nThis little dove though local is not uncommon. It appears however only to breed during the rains.\n\n800. PTEROCLES FASCIATUS. (Scop.)\nThe painted sand grouse is common in the Atapadi state on the borders of Sangola and is occasionally found in the Sangola sub-division itself. The writer has also noticed it in Karmala. It is probably found also in the east of Barsi.\n\n802. PTEROCLES EXUSTUS. (Tem.)\nThe common sand grouse is abundant everywhere in the district, breeding during the hot and cold weather as a rule. The young birds give capital sport in the rains, and are very good eating.\n\n803. PAVO CRISTATUS. (Lin.)\nThere are no truly wild peafowl in the district, but there are numbers at Akalkot and at most of the villages in the Karmala sub-division where there is much garden land. They breed in September and October and appear to lay only three or four eggs in this district.\nAppendix A.\n\nBirds.\n\n819. FRANCOLINUS PICTUS. (Jerd. and Selby.)\nThe painted partridge is fairly common in B\u00e1rsi, Karm\u00e1la, and the north and east of Shol\u00e1pur, and the writer has once shot it in S\u00e1ngola but in no other part of the district. It appears to breed only once a year in September.\n\n822. ORTYGORNIS PONDICERIANUS. (Gmel.)\nThe gray partridge is much commoner than the painted and is generally distributed over the whole district. It appears to breed twice a year, once at some time between February and May and again in the rains.\n\n827. PERDICULA \u00c1EGOONDA. (Sykes.)\nThe rock bush quail is very common all through the district and breeds in the rains and sometimes as late as November.\n\n828. MICROPERDIX ERYTHRORHYNCHUS. (Sykes.)\nThe writer has never himself seen this bird but has heard of a specimen being found near Shol\u00e1pur itself.\n\n829. COTURNIX COMMUNIS. (Bonn.)\nThe gray quail though rather local is found in considerable number all through the district from September till April. It does not breed in the district.\n\n830. COTURNIX COROMANDELICA. (Gmel.)\nThe rain quail is much commoner than its larger relative, and is found equally all over the district wherever there is shelter for it. It breeds abundantly among the b\u00e1jri fields in the rains from August to November depending on the season.\n\n832. TURNIX TAIGOOR. (Sykes.)\nThis quail is not common but is widely distributed and breeds also in the rains.\n\n835. TURNIX DUSSUMIERI. (Tem.)\nThe little button quail is much more common and is really plentiful in the large grass kurans. It is very difficult to flush and this makes people think it rare. It also breeds in the rains.\n\n836. EUPODOTIS EDWARDSI. (Gray.)\nThe Indian bustard is fairly common in Karm\u00e1la, and generally scattered through the other parts of the district. It is one of the birds that has appeared in greater numbers since the famine. It is a partial migrant coming to breed in the rains and mostly leaving in the hot weather.\n\n839. SYPEOTIDES AURITA. (Latham.)\nThe florican is found through the grass preserves of the district. Except in the Shol\u00e1pur sub-division and Akalkot it is scarce, and even in these sub-divisions it appears to be diminishing in numbers. It breeds in the end of the rains, the young often not being hatched till the beginning of November. It ought therefore hardly to be shot before the first of December.\n\n840. CURSORIUS COROMANDELICUS. (Gmel.)\nThis bird is common on all the bare waste land and among the ploughed fields. It lays its much streaked eggs on the bare ground in the hot weather.\n\n842. GLAREOLA ORIENTALIS. (Leach.)\n\n843. GLAREOLA LACTEA. (Tem.)\nBoth the swallow plovers are found though sparingly in the cold weather along the Bhima.\n\n845. CHARADRIUS FULVUS. (Gm.)\nThe Indian golden plover is very rare, and the writer has only noticed odd birds on the banks of the Ekruk tank.\n\n850. \u00c6GIALITIS JERDONI. (Legge.)\nThis is the common ringed plover found in pairs along all the water-courses. It breeds at all seasons except the rains but nests are very difficult to find.\n\n852. CHETTUSIA GREGARIA. (Pall.)\nA fairly common winter visitant.\n\n855. LOBIVANELLUS INDICUS. (Bodd.)\nThe redwattled lapwing is common everywhere and breeds in the hot weather.\n856. LOBIPLUVIA MALABARICA. (Bodd.)\nThe yellow-wattled lapwing, essentially a bird shunning cultivation, is less common but is fairly distributed over the district. It breeds on bare ground from May to July.\n\n858. AESACUS RECURVIROSTRIS. (Cuvier.)\nThe big river plover is found among stones on the Bhima and Nira rivers but is very scarce. It probably breeds.\n\n859. AEDICNEMUS SCOLOPAX. (S. G. Gmel.)\nThe stone-plover is fairly common among scrub forest wherever that exists, and breeds in the hot weather in the district.\n\n866. ANTHROPOIDES VIRGO. (Lin.)\nThe kulum of sportsmen is very plentiful in the district but appears more wary here than any place else the writer has been stationed in. Large flocks may be found on the banks of the Ekruk tank and they will there allow a sailing boat to pass within long shot if the sportsmen are concealed.\n\n870. GALLINAGO STHENURA. (Kuhl.)\n871. GALLINAGO CELESTIS. (Frenz.)\nBoth these snipes are found in the district wherever there is suitable ground for them. Rice being hardly cultivated in the district and there being no marsh, the places where they are to be had are few in number. When the Ekruk tank was first made there was capital shooting for a year or two behind the dam. The leakage has however stopped and with it the snipe shooting. Eight or nine brace however are occasionally got in the water-course which runs through the Sholapur camp. A bag of snipe in the district generally contains both kinds in about equal proportion.\n\n872. GALLINAGO GALLINULA. (Lin.)\nThe jack snipe is commoner than either of the others in this district as it is found along all the water-courses with grassy banks, but not in sufficient numbers to be worth pursuing for sport.\n\n873. RHYNCHAEA BENGALENSIS. (Lin.)\nPainted snipes are found here and there through the district; they are nowhere common; they probably breed.\n\n877. NUMENIUS LINEATUS. (Cuv.)\nThe curlew is a rare winter visitant to Sholapur.\n\n880. MACHETES PUGNAX. (Lin.)\nThe ruff is one of the earliest visitants to the district but is very local.\n\n882. TRINGA SUBARQUATA (Guld.) Curlew Stint.\n884. TRINGA MINUTA (Leisl.) Little Stint.\n891. ACTITIS GLAREOLA (Lin.) Spotted Sandpiper.\n892. ACTITIS OCHROPUS (Lin.) Green Sandpiper.\n893. TRINGOIDES HYPOLEUCUS (Lin.) Common Sandpiper.\n894. TOTANUS GLOTTIS (Lin.) Greenshank.\n895. TOTANUS STAGNATILIS (Buhst.) Little Greenshank.\n897. TOTANUS CALIDRIS (Lin.) Redshank.\n\nAll these sandpipers are found in more or less abundance during the cold weather, the commonest being perhaps the green and common sandpipers.\n\n898. HIMANTOPUS CANDIDUS. (Bonn.)\nThe black-winged stilt is fairly common in the cold weather, leaving however early in the season.\n\n901. HYDROPHASIANUS CHIRURGUS. (Scop.)\nIs a scarce bird but a few may generally be seen about the Moti tank. It is believed to breed.\n\n902. PORPHYRIO POLIOCEPHALUS. (Lath.)\nThe purple coot is a rare visitant, but it is seen several times.\n\n903. FULICA ATRA. (Lin.)\nThe common bald coot is plentiful during the cold weather on all the tanks. It does not breed in the district.\n\n905. GALLINULA CHLOROPUS. (Lin.)\nThe water-hen is rare in the district; two or three pair breed every rains behind the dam of the Pandharpur tank.\nAppendix A.\n\nBirds.\n\n907. **ERYTHRA PH\u00c6NICURA.** *(Penn.)*  \nThe white-breasted water-hen is more common, or at all events being much more noisy attracts greater notice. It also breeds in the rains.\n\n909. **PORZANA MARUETTA.** *(Leach.)*  \nThe spotted crake is not uncommon in the end of the rains and the cold weather wherever there is any moist cover for it.\n\n915. **LEPTOPTILUS ARGALUS.** *(Lath.)*  \nThis adjutant is very rare, but the writer has noticed it feeding with vultures on carrion several times.\n\n917. **XENORHYNCHUS ASIATICUS.** *(Lath.)*  \nThe writer has noticed this stork on one or two occasions.\n\n918. **CICONIA NIGRA.** *(Lin.)*  \nThe writer has noticed this stork as moderately common in the early winter along the Man river but in no other part of the district.\n\n920. **DISSURA EPISCOPA.** *(Bodd.)*  \nThis stork is fairly common and is the only permanent resident among the storks. It breeds in December and January.\n\n923. **ARDEA CINerea** *(Lin.)* COMMON HERON.\n\n924. **ARDEA PURPUREA** *(Lin.)* PURPLE HERON.  \nBoth the herons are found in the district but the purple heron is much the rarest. Neither breed in the district, though Ardea cinerea may always be found singly.\n\n925. **HERODIAS TORRA.** *(Buch. Ham.)*\n\n926. **HERODIAS INTERMEDIA.** *(Hass.)*\n\n927. **HERODIAS GARZETTA.** *(Lin.)*  \nAll three white egrets are found in the district in the cold weather. The garzette remains and breeds in March and April.\n\n929. **BUBULCUS COROMANDUS.** *(Bodd.)*  \nIs common in the district and breeds in several places in March April and May.\n\n930. **ARDEOLA GRAYI.** *(Sykes.)*  \nThis pond heron is the commonest of the family but leaves in the end of the hot weather.\n\n931. **BUTORIDES JAVANICA.** *(Horsf.)*  \nThe green bittern is rare in the district and the writer has never noticed it except in the cold weather. It does not appear to breed.\n\n934. **ARDETTA SINENSIS.** *(Gmel.)*  \nA single specimen obtained.\n\n937. **NYCTICORAX GRISSEUS.** *(Lin.)*  \nThis bird is moderately common but leaves the district for two or three months in the beginning of the rains.\n\n938. **TANTALUS LEUCOCEPHALUS.** *(Gmelin.)*  \nModerately common along the rivers and certainly used to breed near the Bhima, the tree however having been blown down, the birds deserted the place.\n\n939. **PLATAEA LEUCORODIA.** *(Lin.)*  \nFairly common; breeding in April and May.\n\n940. **ANASTOMUS OSCITANS.** *(Bodd.)*  \nNot uncommon in the cold weather along a large river.\n\n941. **IBIS MELANOCEPHALA.** *(Lath.)*  \nIt is not at all uncommon all the cold weather but apparently leaves the district in the rains.\n\n942. **INOCOTIS PAPILLOSUS.** *(Tem.)*  \nThe king-curlew is common and breeds twice a year in the hot weather and the end of the rains.\n\n943. **FALCINELLUS IGNEUS.** *(S. G. Gmel.)*  \nThe glossy ibis is very rare and the writer has only seen it on one or two occasions.\n\n944. **PH\u00c6NICOPTERUS ANTIQUORUM.** *(Tem.)*  \nThe flamingo is very rare but small flocks occasionally turn up in the cold weather.\n\n950. **SARCIDORNIS MELANONOTUS.** *(Penn.)*  \nThe 'nukhta' is not common in the district but the writer has seen it once or twice in the cold weather.\n951. NETTOPUS COROMANDELIANUS. (Gmel.)\nCotton teal are also rare. Three or four pairs stayed a week or two on the Moti tank in July 1874 but they were so much persecuted that they did not stay more.\n\n952. DENDROCYGNA JAVANICA. (Horsf.)\nThe whistling teal is a very rare duck, one or two small flocks may be found on the head of the Ekrulk tank in December and January, but as a rule they shun open country.\n\n954. CASARCA RUTILA. (Pall.)\nThe ruddy shielddrake or brahmani duck is common on all the large rivers during the cold weather and frequently stays till April.\n\n957. SPATULA CLYPEATA. (Lin.)\nThe shoveller is probably the earliest migratory duck (not teal) that appears at the end of the rains, and is found in pairs generally; as they cling to the rushy edges of the tanks, they are comparatively easy to shoot.\n\n959. ANAS PECILORHYNCHA. (Trost.)\nIs not a common duck in the district. It occurs occasionally in the rains, so probably is a permanent resident and breeds.\n\n961. CHAULELASMUS STREPERUS. (Lin.)\nThis and the widgeon are the two commonest of the larger ducks. Immense flocks sometimes collect on the Bhima flying up the smaller rivers at night and returning in the morning. Three or more may generally be got by starting at daybreak and walking along the bed of one of these streams as they fly down at only a moderate height.\n\n962. DAFLA ACUTA. (Lin.)\nThe pintail is not a common duck in Sholapur, but a few are always got.\n\n963. MARECA PENELOPE. (Lin.)\nWidgeon are very plentiful, and are often found in company with gadwall.\n\n964. QUERQUEDULA CRECCA. (Lin.)\nThe greenwinged teal is the commonest by far of all the wild fowl. Enormous flocks haunt the Ekrulk tank and smaller flocks are found wherever there is water for them.\n\n965. QUERQUEDULA CIRCIA. (Lin.)\nThe bluewinged teal is less common than the greenwinged, but is generally found in company with it. It stays much later than any other of the migratory duck.

(Guld.)\nThe white-eyed duck is also not at all common.\n\n971. FULIGULA CRISTATA. (Lin.)\nThe tufted duck is common in the winter.\n\n975. PODICEPS MINOR. (Gmel.)\nThe \"dabchick\" is common in the few tanks wherever there are reeds. It breeds in the rains.\n\n983. STERNA ANGLICA. (Mont.)\n984. HYDROCHELIDON HYBRIDA. (Pall.)\nBoth these terns are found occasionally along the rivers.\n\n987. STERNA MELANOGASTRA. (Tem.)\nThis is the common tern in the district and a few pairs breed in the hot weather in the sand along the rivers.\n\n995. RHYNCHOPS ALBICOLLIS. (Swains.)\nA rare winter visitant.\n\n1004. PELECANUS PHILIPPENSIS. (Gmel.)\nA single pelican believed to be of this species was seen by the writer on the Pandharpur tank.\n\n1007. PHALACROCORAX PYGM\u00c6US. (Pall.)\nThe little cormorant swarms in the cold weather in places along the Bhima. It does not appear however to remain and breed.\n\n1008. PLOTUS MELANOGASTER. (Penn.)\nThe Indian snakebird is moderately common. The writer has seen it at all seasons but never seen a nest in the Sholapur district.\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nSPECIAL FUNERAL RITES.\n\nAmong the high class Hindus special funeral rites are performed when a man is drowned, or when a man dies on an unlucky day, or when a Hindu dies an atheist a Christian or a Musalm\u00e1n, or when a woman dies in pregnancy, monthly courses, or childbed. The most important of these special funeral rites is the ceremony called N\u00e1r\u00e1yambali literally offerings to N\u00e1r\u00e1yan. The details are: The chief mourner sprinkles a plot of ground with cowdung and water, sets a low wooden stool on the plot, spreads rice on the stool, and on the rice puts a copper pot. In the pot he puts water, sarvaushadhi or Asparagus racemosus, and pancharatna or five jewels in practice generally an eight-anna piece, and filling a copper plate with rice sets it on the pot. He then takes a gold image of the god Satyesh or N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, washes it with five nectars or panch\u00e1mrita milk, curds, clarified butter, honey, and sugar, and sets it on the rice in the plate. He offers redpowder, turmeric, flowers, and sweet cakes or sugar, bows to the image, and prays to it to remove the sins of the dead. He then takes the image and puts it in a metal plate, and in another plate puts water with sesame, barley, sweet basil leaves, turmeric, and white earth. He takes a conch shell and dips it in the water of the second plate and pours the water on the image of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan from the point of the conch. Next he places a silver image of Brahma in a plate and puts the plate on a pot and the pot on a heap of wheat. In the same way he places a gold image of Vishnu on a heap of gram, a copper image of Rudra on mug Phaseolus mungo, an iron image of Yama the god of death on udid Phaseolus radiatus, and a lead image of preta or the deceased on sesame. He calls on the four deities and the dead to come and live in the images and worships them in the same way as he worshipped the first image of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan. Next the chief mourner performs the pr\u00e1yaschitta hom or atonement sacrifice. He raises a quadrangular mound of earth, sweeps it with sacred grass, sprinkles cowdung and water on it, draws lines on it with a shrava spoon made of mango leaves and umbar Ficus glomerata sticks, picks up with his thumb and ring-finger any small pebbles that may be on the mound, again sprinkles water, and kindles a sacred fire called v\u00e9d in order that the sin attaching to the dead, owing to his or her death having occurred on an unlucky day, or in water, or during her monthly sickness, or in pregnancy, or in childbed, or when he was a convert or an atheist, or on ground which was not sprinkled with cowdung and cow's urine, or which was not strewn with sacred grass sesame and basil leaves, may be removed and that he or she may not wander among the living but may go to heaven easily. He then throws the water on the ground. He puts to the north side of the sacred fire two blades of sacred grass and places over them two sacrificial vessels one called pranit\u00e1 or the conductor the other called prokshani or the sprinkler. He takes the vessel called pranit\u00e1 with his left hand, fills it with water with his right hand, and sets it in its former place. He sets three blades of sacred grass on each side of the altar and the following articles near the two vessels: shrava a spoon made of mango leaves and umbar sticks, upayamanakusha a knotted cluster of seven blades of sacred grass, summarjanakusha a knotted cluster of five\nblades of sacred grass, *pavitr\u00eddve* two rings of sacred grass joined together, *darbh\u00e1stray\u00e1s* a knotted cluster of three blades of sacred grass, *\u00e1jyasth\u00e1li* a vessel for clarified butter, and *charusth\u00e1li* a vessel for cooking rice. Having set these things in their proper places, he takes the *darbh\u00e1stray\u00e1s* or knotted cluster of three blades of sacred grass and encircles it with the *pavitr\u00eddve* or two sacred grass rings, and cutting off the ends of the *darbh\u00e1stray\u00e1s* or cluster of three blades of sacred grass he throws the *darbh\u00e1stray\u00e1s* and *pavitr\u00eddve* to the north and places the bit he has cut off in the vessel called *prokshanip\u00e1tra* or the sprinkler. He then pours the water from the vessel called *pranit\u00e1* into the vessel called *prokshani* and purifies all the sacrificial things by sprinkling the water on them. To the south of the sacred fire he places on the fire the vessel called *\u00e1jyasth\u00e1li* filled with clarified butter and to the north he places the vessel called *charusth\u00e1li* filled with rice and water and gets the rice cooked there. He then takes a brand from the sacred fire and moves it in a circle round the altar, and purifies the *shr\u00fava* spoon made of mango leaves and *umbor* sticks, by heating it on the sacred fire and sprinkling water on it with sacred grass from the vessel called *prokshani*. He then takes down the vessels of rice and clarified butter which were kept on the altar and purifying them sets them in front of the sacred fire. He then holds the *upayamanakusha* or knotted cluster of seven blades of sacred grass in his left hand, and the *samidhashisrus* or bundle of three sacrificial sticks in his right hand, and, touching his chest with the cluster of seven blades of sacred grass, throws the bundle of three sacrificial sticks into the sacred fire. Then he throws one after another one hundred and eighteen spoonfuls of clarified butter, sixteen handfuls of cooked rice, and one hundred and eight handfuls of sesame in the sacred fire. He worships his family priest and gives him a cow and money presents or *dakshin\u00e1*. Next the chief mourner performs the rites called the *Vaishnav\u00e1di* and *Panchadarvata shr\u00e1ddh\u00e1s*. He spreads eleven plantain leaves in a line and places on them eleven knotted blades of sacred grass and on these blades eleven balls of rice for eleven deities Vishnu, Shiv, Yama the god of death, Som the moon, Havvyav\u00e1han the gods\u2019 offering-carrier, Kavyav\u00e1han or the manes\u2019 offering-carrier, Mrityu or death, Rudra, Purusha, Preta or the deceased, and N\u00e1r\u00e1yan. After worshipping these eleven balls with flowers, redpowder, and sweet basil leaves, he repeats eleven hymns or *mantr\u00e1s* in praise of the eleven deities and pours water on the balls from the point of a conch shell and bows to them. He spreads five plantain leaves in a straight line and on them lays five knotted blades of sacred grass and on the blades sets five *pind\u00e1s* or rice balls for Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Yama, and Preta, worships them with redpowder turmeric and flowers, burns frankincense, lights camphor, offers libations of water, and bows before them. He then worships the family priest and other Br\u00e1hmans and gives them cows, gold, silver, iron, umbrellas, and sesame. This ends the N\u00e1r\u00e1yanbali ceremony.\n\nAppendix B.\nSpecial Funeral Rites.\nAPPENDIX C.\n\nHOUSE CONSECRATION.\n\nThe Hindu ceremony for consecrating a new house is called V\u0101stu-sh\u0101nti or V\u0101stu-quieting, V\u0101stu being the Place Spirit or Genius Loci. It is believed that if the ceremony is performed in the month of Bh\u0101drapad or September, a month in which the spirits of the dead are supposed to be specially powerful, a death or some other misfortune will happen in the family of the person who performs it. So also the months Pau\u1e63a or December-January the month of the spirit Sankr\u0101nt, Chaitra or April-May, and \u0100shvin or September-October are unlucky for a V\u0101stu-quieting or house warming. In any other month but these a lucky day is chosen. On that day the house is decked with flowers and mango leaves and friends and relations are asked to the ceremony. The host and his wife bathe, dress in rich clothes, and sit on low wooden stools placed within lines of quartz powder. The family priest sits on a third stool in front of them and near him sit other Br\u0101hmans called to aid in the ceremony. The host, taking water in his right hand, says 'I perform this ceremony called V\u0101stush\u0101nti or V\u0101stu-soothing that no evil may befall my family, and that in future I and my family may live happily in this newly built house.' He then throws the water on the ground. The family priest, in a winnowing fan takes parched rice and grains of mustard seed and scatters them about the house saying 'Let those bh\u016bts or spirits who dwell in this plot of land depart, and let those spirits who trouble or stop our ceremony be destroyed by the command of the god Shiv.'\n\nThe priest then mixes cow's urine, cowdung, milk, curds, clarified butter, and water, and sprinkles the mixture about the house and about the yard. Next he consecrates the spot in which the host is sitting by sprinkling it with the same mixture and raises a quadrangular mound on the spot. At each corner of the mound a two feet long blackwood peg is driven into the ground and a cotton thread is passed round the pegs. The host offers curds, milk, pulse of u\u1e0did Phaseolus radiatus, and parched grain at each peg and says 'Let the n\u0101g\u0101s or serpents go to the bottom of the earth, and let all the lokap\u0101l\u0101s or guardian spirits which prolong life and\n\n---\n\n1 Of the origin of V\u0101stu-quieting the Matsya or fish Pur\u0101\u1e47 gives the following account: A giant named Andhak or Darkness grew so mischievous that Shiv attacked and killed him. In the fatigue of fighting Shiv perspired and from his sweat a terrible spirit sprang. The spirit was no sooner born than, excited by hunger, he began to drink the blood of the dead giant. Still his hunger was not appeased. The spirit prayed to Shiv that he might have the power of devouring anything in the world. Shiv granted the boon and the spirit spread havoc through the world and harassed both men and gods. The gods met, hurled the spirit to the earth, and sat on his body. The spirit begged the gods to make some provision for him promising if they did he would remain quiet and trouble no one. To provide for him, the gods ordained that whenever a new house or a well or a pond was finished offerings should be made to the spirit and that he would be at liberty to trouble those who would not make the proper offerings. From that time the spirit was called V\u0101stu from the Sanskrit vas to dwell because they say the gods dwelt on his body.\n\n2 The Sanskrit text is: Apasarpantu y\u00e9 bhut\u00e1, t\u00e9 bhut\u00e1 blumi-sansthita; y\u00e9 bhut\u00e1 vighn\u0101karta\u015bas, t\u00e9 na\u015byantu \u015aiv\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101.\nstrength live in this dwelling. The host then traces a square of turmeric and water on the ground and in the square lays fire made of cowdung, and sets on the fire a vessel filled with clarified butter. When the butter is hot he takes the vessel in his hand and throws parched rice, mustard seed, *udid* Phaseolus radiatus, and three spoonfuls of the clarified butter at each corner pillar of the house to the north, south, east, and west. He then spreads a white piece of cloth over the altar and dipping a golden or reed pen in a mixture of redpowder and water draws on it ten lines from east to west and ten from north to south, and, placing rice and betelnuts upon it, worships the cloth with redpowder and flowers. Next the host fills two copper pots with water, places them on the cloth, puts bent grass, precious stones, and copper or silver coins in them, encircles them with a cotton thread, and places on them two copper plates filled with rice. On the rice in the copper plate he places two golden images one of the Place Spirit V\u00e1stu and the other of Dhruva or the polar star and lays before them flowers, turmeric, and redpowder. After this he worships the *navagrih\u00e1s* or nine planets and the *dashadikp\u00e1l\u00e1s* or ten quarter guardians and throws into the fire offerings of cooked rice, sesame, clarified butter, bent grass, sacred grass, *bel* or \u00c6gle marmelos fruit, and pieces of blackwood, *pipal* Ficus religiosa, *palas* Butea frondosa, *shami* Prosopis spicigera, and *ruvi* Calotropis gigantea. After this cooked rice, curds, *udid*, and a lighted flour lamp are set on a plantain leaf and the whole is taken away and laid at a place where three roads meet as an offering to the spirits of the place. The host then takes a cocoanut, a plantain, a betelnut and leaves, flowers, and sesame, ties them together with a cotton thread, and he and his wife, standing together, throw the bundle into the fire and bow to it. This is called *purn\u00e1huti* or the complete offering. The family priest then takes ashes from the fire and marks the brows of the host and his wife with them. A long red cotton thread is passed round the house, and ten flags of silk or paper are fixed in different parts of the house roof. At the foundation pillar of the house which is called *muhurtamedha* or the lucky post, a pit about two feet deep is dug and filled with water. A little oil is poured on the water. If the oil on the surface of the water runs or takes the form of a tortoise it is believed that the house will last long and the owner will prosper, otherwise it is feared that some evil will happen to the owner or his family. An earthen box is then brought and filled with bent grass, sesame seed, curds, rice in husk, parched rice, seven kinds of corn, precious stones of five kinds, mustard seeds, lotus, *yakshakardam* or perfumed paste made of camphor agallochum and musk, *v\u00e1la* or Andropogon muricatum, moss, *manush\u00edla* or red sulphurate of arsenic, and *ashtagandha* or the mixture of eight scents. The golden image of V\u00e1stu is then placed in the box with its face down and the articles mentioned above are placed on its\n\n---\n\n1 The Sanskrit text is: Vi\u015bantu bh\u016btal\u00e9 n\u00e1g\u00e1s lokap\u00e1l\u00e1scha sarvatas, asmin grih\u00e9 vasantve \u015bayurbalak\u00e1r\u00e1s sadd.\n2 According to the book rituals the parched rice, mustard seed, *udid*, and clarified butter ought to be placed under the pillars before they are fixed. In practice the grain and butter are generally sprinkled when the house is completed.\n3 The roof is the spirit haunt and the flag the spirit-scarer. So small flags are put on some Hindu graves and used in Hindu mind-rites. So pilgrims, ships, and armies have flags. The spirit of the dead Hindu sits like a bird on the roof for several days and is fed by milk. So the Burmese after a wedding throw stones on the roof to scare fiends. So the Greek saying, 'No roof is without its evil spirit.' The combination of the flag and the roof is shown in many houses in Bombay and Surat on whose roofs an anchor and a flag are painted.\nAppendix C.\n\nHouse Consecration.\n\nThe box is closed and worshipped with flowers and redpowder. Nine earthen or copper pots are filled with water, copper or silver coins and betelnuts are put in them, and the host facing east pours water into the pit from the nine pots. He throws sandal-paste, flowers, and rice into the pit and bows to it. The box is then laid in the pit with the blowing of pipes and the beating of drums and the pit is closed with earth. If the earth is enough to fill the pit or if any earth remains after filling the pit it is a good omen; if the earth fails to fill the pit the omen is bad. After filling the pit the spot is cowdunged, worshipped with redpowder and flowers, and a lighted lamp is set on it. The wife of the host mixes turmeric in water and plunging her hands in the mixture strikes them against the doors of the house. The host does the same with his right hand only. The V\u00e1stu-soothing ends with presents of clothes and money to Br\u00e1hmans and a feast to Br\u00e1hmans and friends and relations.\n\nThis house consecration is interesting for several reasons. Like exorcism, as its object is to drive away a spirit, it is one of the early rites. Two of the most dreaded of early spirits seem to have been the Place Spirit and the Time Spirit. The Time Spirit is K\u00e1l or Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l the Great Destroyer, Time and Death, as in Europe, being the same. It is from the fear that K\u00e1l will carry off the bride or the bridegroom that, at the wedding moment, grain is thrown over the bride and bridegroom, hands are clapped, music is played, and guns are fired. As every moment has its spirit so every plot of ground has its Place Spirit. Whoever builds a house trespasses on the domain of a Place Spirit, who, unless scared or pleased, will punish the trespasser either by shaking down his house or by killing or sickening some member of his family. The belief in the Place Spirit and the need of pleasing him is widespread. The Indian Musalm\u00e1ns are not less careful than the Hindus to scare the Place Spirit. Before a new house is used priests are called and the Kur\u00e1n is read and slips of paper with texts from the Kur\u00e1n written on them are buried. The early Egyptians had a similar practice of placing under a stone papers with passages from the Book of the Dead (Tiele\u2019s Egyptian Religion, 23, 26). In Burma people are buried alive when a palace is finished (Shway Yoes The Burman, II. 207). In the Fiji islands when a chief\u2019s house is finished a slave is buried in each post-hole (Wallace\u2019s Australasia, 487). In Borneo when a chief makes a house it is sprinkled with human blood (Tylor\u2019s Primitive Culture, II. 382). In Madagascar human sacrifices are offered when the chief\u2019s palace is made (Sibree\u2019s Madagascar, 305). In Europe the Place Spirit is regarded with the same fear. The Germans think the first person who enters a new house or crosses a new bridge is doomed to be a victim to the Place Spirit (Grimm\u2019s Teutonic Mythology, III. 1021). The Picts bathed the foundations of towers in blood to please the Place Spirit (Scott\u2019s Border Minstrelsy, 414). According to one account the old Irish missionary St. Columbo buried St. Oran under the walls of St. Kilda church to please the Place Spirit (Ditto). In 1843 the people of Halle wished to have a child killed and buried under a new bridge to strengthen its foundations (Henderson\u2019s Folklore, 274). The feeling lives in the luck which attaches to an English house warming, in\n\n---\n\n1 Burying with the face down is practised by some low tribes in Kh\u00e1ndesh in the case of pregnant women and others who are specially likely to come back and plague the living. Mr. J. A. Baines, C. S.\n\n2 The handmark as on a sati stone or at a Musalm\u00e1n wedding is a sign of luck. Musalm\u00e1ns both Shi\u00e1s and Sunnis worship an open hand.\nthe Scotch practice of drinking a health to the first fire, and in the French invitation Pendre la cr\u00eamaill\u00e8re to hang the cooking pot that is to attend the first cooking. The means taken to scare or to please the Place Spirit in Burmah, Borneo, Madagascar, and Scotland by a human sacrifice seem, till the introduction of British rule, to have been commonly practised in the Bombay Deccan. About 1190 when the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort was built by the Panh\u00e1la kings, two Mh\u00e1rs, a boy and a girl, were buried alive at the west gates as an offering to the place spirit. Under the Bedar kings (1347-1490) a village was granted to a man in reward for providing a man and a woman to be buried under one of the bastions of Purandhar fort in the Poona district which had several times fallen. The Shol\u00e1pur headman owes his position to the grant, about the same time, of a pregnant woman to be buried alive under one of the eastern towers of the fort, and one of the Deshmukh family of Shol\u00e1pur is still paid a yearly cash allowance which was originally made to an ancestor of his, in return for the gift of a youth to be buried under the great north Shol\u00e1pur tower. About 1750 a M\u00e1ng is said to have been buried under the foundations of the Peshwa\u2019s Shanv\u00e1r palace in Poona. About 1790 a newly married pair were buried under the main entrance to Lohogad fort in Poona and the person, a Mar\u00e1tha, who provided the victims was rewarded by the headship of the village on the Lohogad terrace. Several other examples of human sacrifices occur in connection with the making of wells and ponds which, without the cement of human blood, refused to hold water. This worldwide dread of the Place Spirit suggests an explanation for the Freemason\u2019s rites at laying the foundation stone of a building. Like the Hindus Freemasons have a love for the old and preserve old practices by symbolic explanations. Under the foundation stone the Freemason lays grain oil and wine, some newspapers, and some coins. The oil they say is put under the stone because it is an emblem of abundance, the wine because it is an emblem of joy, and the grain because it is an emblem of plenty. The papers are put in to show what the literature of the time was like, and the coin to show who was then the king. That these explanations do not give the origin of the practices appears from the consideration that there is little wisdom or profit in putting health, joy, and plenty under a stone; that if the literature of the time is to be handed down, letters should be cut in stone or in metal, not printed on perishable paper; and that, if the date is to be handed down, it should be preserved by being engraven in some notable part of the building, not in a place which cannot be reached until every stone of the building has been overturned. The historical explanation of the Freemasons\u2019 foundation-laying rites seems to be that the object of all is to scare the Place Spirit. Oil, wine, and grain are among the greatest gladdeners supporters and healers and therefore the greatest scarers of disease hunger and bad spirits. Grain and oil are used in the Hindu Place Spirit-quieting and it is worthy of note that according to the books they should be buried at the foot of the house posts instead of as at present being strewn on the house floor. The early Egyptian and modern Musalm\u00e1n practice of scaring the Place Spirit by burying under the foundation stones slips of paper with holy spirit-scaring texts suggests that the original newspaper was a spirit-scaring slip. The coin again seems put in with the same object as the coin was put into the dead Greek mouth or is tied to the hem of the Hindus\u2019 shroud and is used in the Hindu V\u00e1stu-Sh\u00e1nti and in exorcisms, that is to drive off spirits.\n\nAppendix C.\nHouse Consecration.\nINDEX.\n\nA.\n\nAcquisition (1818-1870) : 301.\nAdil Sh\u00e1his : Musalm\u00e1n kings of Bij\u00e1pur (1489-1686), 278-287.\nAgarv\u00e1ls : traders, 48-50.\nAge Details : 24.\nAkalkot : origin (1708) of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of, 289 ; State, description, boundaries, aspect, rivers, water, geology, climate, rainfall, forests, animals, birds, people, irrigation, crops, moneylending, trade, crafts, land, justice, revenue, schools, dispensary, places, history, 505-510.\nAkluj : town, Aurangzeb at (1689), 288, 407.\nAl\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji : Delhi Emperor (1295-1316), 275 note 3.\nAlienated Villages (1884) : 365-366.\n\u00c1ndhrabhritya : Deccan Hindu dynasty (B.C. 90-A.D. 300), 275.\nArea : 1 ; arable, 218.\nAsadkh\u00e1n : Bij\u00e1pur general and minister (1511-1549), 279-281.\nAshta : lake, 223-225 ; battle of (1818), 294-296 ; village, 407-408.\nAspect : 2.\nAsses : 18.\nAssessed Taxes : 375.\nAt\u00e1rs : Musalm\u00e1n perfumers, 198.\nAudichs : Gujar\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmans, 30.\n\nB.\n\nBadv\u00e1s : Pandharpur priests, 427, 468.\nB\u00e1g\u00e1ns : Musalm\u00e1n gardeners, 204.\nBahamis : Deccan Musalm\u00e1n kings (1347-1489), 276-278.\nB\u00e1jir\u00e1v II. : ninth Peshwa (1796-1817), 292-295.\nBakar Kas\u00e1bs : mutton butchers, 204.\nB\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t : hill range, 2.\nB\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v : third Peshwa (1740-1761), 290-291.\nBalance Sheet : 376.\nB\u00e1lsantoshis : beggars, 181.\nBanking : 239-240.\nB\u00e1pu Gokhale : Mar\u00e1tha general (1817-18), 293-295.\nB\u00e1rgirs : Mar\u00e1tha troopers, 285 note 2.\nB\u00e1rsi : survey, 318-321, 348-352 ; sub-division details, boundaries, area, aspect, climate, water, p 125-67.\n\nsoil, stock, holdings, crops, people, 391-393 ; town details, 408-410.\nBarutgars : Musalm\u00e1n firework makers, 199.\nB\u00e1vi : village, temples, 410.\nBedras : Musalm\u00e1n traders, 199.\nBegampur : village, Aurangzeb's daughter's tomb, 411.\nBeggars : 180-191.\nBeld\u00e1rs : quarrymen, 91-92.\nBerads : unsettled tribes, 163-165.\nBhadhbhunj\u00e1s : grain parchers, 92, 204-205.\nBhagv\u00e1nl\u00e1l Indraji : Dr., 275, 417 note 1.\nBh\u00e1mt\u00e1s : pickpockets, 165.\nBhat : Mr. G.
