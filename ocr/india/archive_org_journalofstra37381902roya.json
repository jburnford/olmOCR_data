Hellier,\nHonorary Treasurer, Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society.\nKelantan and my trip to Gunong Tahan.\n\nBy Mr. John Waterstradt.\n\nGunong Tahan, the supposed highest mountain in the Malay Peninsula had always a great attraction for me, ever since I had ascended the Kina Balu mountain in Borneo, situated in about the same latitude, as I wanted to compare the fauna of the former with that of the latter. However it was not until ten years after my first ascent of Kina Balu, that I found an opportunity of undertaking the journey to Gunong Tahan. My plans for the trip had been laid long beforehand, and I had decided to take the Kelantan route in preference to that of Pahang, as several expeditions which had tried to reach the mountain by the latter route had failed, mostly I believe owing to the difficulty of obtaining food supplies. I decided to abandon everything in the shape of comforts for this trip, taking with me only things that were absolutely necessary, and utilising all the coolies I could get for carrying provisions. Leaving Singapore towards the end of April in a small coasting steamer, I arrived in Kelantan four days later, the steamer calling at most of the ports along the coast, on the way up. The mouth of the Kelantan river is on the map given as farther south than it really is, but that entrance has long ago sanded up, and ships have now to enter by the northern entrance. Lately a fairly good light house has been erected by the Siamese, and a Siamese gunboat is always stationed there. Owing to the shallowness of the river all steamers are obliged to anchor just inside the bar, behind a sand spit that affords good shelter; and passengers and cargo are taken up to Kota Bahru in small native boats.\n\nKota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, is situated about eight miles from the mouth of the river, on the right bank of the same, and contains according to the Rajah's account, about 20,000 inhabitants. The town consists really of two villages;\none of them called Taratchin, is divided from the other by a branch of the river, and is chiefly inhabited by Chinese. Formerly nearly all the business was done in this place, but the ever changing river silted up just there, and now nearly all business is transacted in the native town, a little farther up river, where there is deep water close in to the bank. The Rajah at the instigation of the Siamese is now making fairly good roads in every direction through the town. Just before I arrived, there had been a tremendous fire in the Chinese village, half of which was burned down one night, when most of the inhabitants were attending a f\u00eate given by the Rajah on account of his marriage with the Rajah of Singora\u2019s daughter; and a number of young children who were left alone in the houses were burnt to death. The Rajah used this opportunity to make a broad street right through the whole village, where there formerly had been only narrow crooked paths. During my stay in Kota Bahru, before going up stream, I was the guest of the Siamese Commissioner and was introduced by him to the Rajah, who immediately offered to provide me with boats and men for the trip up the river. The present Rajah is a young man of about thirty-five years, and owes his position to the Siamese, who on the death of the old Rajah installed him as such, in preference to the rightful heir, on the supposition that he would conform to their wishes. So far the Siamese have interfered very little in the internal affairs of Kelantan, keeping only a Commissioner there, who acts as a sort of adviser to the Rajah, and a small garrison; but signs are not wanting that they want to get a more direct control of affairs, and probably before very long Kelantan will be to all purposes, except in name, a Siamese province. The Rajah\u2019s palace is just in the middle of the town, and every forenoon from about 10 to 1 o\u2019clock he holds his court there, afterwards going for a drive out to his villa, that he has built in a garden outside the town. I visited him there one afternoon, and found workmen everywhere building cages for wild animals, and the Rajah told me he intended to start a small Zoological Garden there.\n\nIt was the dry season when I arrived in Kota Bahru and the heat was very intense, the thermometer seldom going below 100\u00b0 in the daytime and 90\u00b0 at night. The Kelantan river,\nwhich in the rainy season often overflows its banks, was now nearly dried up, so we had great difficulty in getting up stream with the three large house boats that the Rajah supplied for me and my men. The river is about 250 yards wide at Kota Bahru, and continues to be about the same width up to Sungie Lebeh, which river falls into the Kelantan river from the right, thirty to forty miles up stream. The banks of the river up to Quala Lebeh are pretty thickly populated, and are lined with coconut groves most of the way. It took us four days to reach Quala Lebeh, as we had only one gang of men to pole the boats, and consequently had to stop at night. I decided to try first to get to Gunang Tahan by the Lebeh river, as that, according to my idea, was the nearest way, and we therefore proceeded up that river for another day, when the rapids were reached, and we had to stop, as it was impossible to get our heavy boats over them.\n\nOn the way up the river we had passed a number of bamboo rafts, with small huts built on them, either moored along the banks, or drifting slowly down stream. They were inhabited by Malays from Kota Bahru, who go up stream to trade or to plant paddy, and prefer living on the river rather than ashore. When therefore a suitable place is found, these people make a raft and build a hut thereon, wherein they live until they have traded away or exchanged all their goods for jungle produce, whereon they drift down stream with their barter or their paddy.\n\nJust below the rapids a number of these rafts were moored, forming a floating village on the river; and as I had to wait there some days before I could get smaller boats to take me up river one of these huts was given up to me, and I discharged the three large boats and sent them back to Kota Bahru, as they were of no further use to me. I had to wait a week at this place before I got smaller boats and other men, to take me further up river, and in the meantime, I and my collectors that I had brought with me from Borneo, did a little collecting; but the species found there were of little interest being the same as are found everywhere in the low land of the Peninsula. At last we got away again in three smaller boats, all heavily loaded; and for the next few days we had a very rough\njob pulling the boats over the rapids, of which the river was full. We had to stop at each village we passed on the way, to get fresh boatmen, as none of these would go any farther with me than to the next village, and this continual stopping and changing men delayed us a good deal. On the third day Quala Aring was reached; and as it was my intention to go up that river, we had again to wait to procure still smaller boats, but we soon managed to get six of these and plenty of men, so were able to proceed the next day. It was at Quala Aring that the Skeat expedition stopped, while Mr. Skeat went across to Pahang and tried to get up the Tahan from that side, but failed, I believe owing to want of provisions, the same as Messrs. Ridley and Davidson before him. The river Aring is of course much smaller than the Lebeh, and is full of rapids, but it was not very difficult to get the boats over them. I counted them several times, and found that on an average we passed over about ten of them an hour the whole way up. There are very few people living on this river, there being only one village of any size, about three days up stream, so I had not to stop on the way to change men, as those from the Quala took me right up to that village. The village is called Buntie, and is the last inhabited place in Kelantan, so I had to halt there to get together coolies and to find out the best way of ascending the mountain, of which I got a good view away to the southward on clear days. The natives there called it Gunong Siam. There is plenty of game to be had round the village, as there are lots of old clearings, where deer and pigs are plentiful, and tigers are also found in numbers. On the very first day I stayed there, while out collecting butterflies close to the house, I heard a noise in the thick low jungle close by, resembling the purring of a cat, only louder, but took no notice of this until a couple of Malays came running after me telling me to come back at once, as there was a tiger quite close by. As I had then about forty Malays with me I wanted them to go into the jungle and drive the tiger out into the open, a distance of not more than twenty or thirty yards, where I could get a shot at him; but though they were all armed with spears and I offered them some of my guns also, they were afraid of doing so, and I did not get a sight of the brute though he stayed in that\nthicket not 150 yards from the house the whole day. On my return from the mountain however I got him, as he had just then killed a buffalo, and came back in the afternoon to have another meal.\n\nAbout a day's journey to the westward of the village at another tributary to the Lebeh river, called Sungei Aring, was situated a small encampment of Sakais and as I wanted these men to show me the way to the mountain, I got the headman of the village to send word to them to join me at once. The whole tribe of Sakais living there are considered to be the property of a Malay living half way up the Aring; and this man brought all the full grown men to me a couple of days later. There is only this one settlement of Sakais in this part of the country, whereas there are said to be thousands of them living up the Ulu Kelantan river. Those that I had with me (ten or eleven men), were all remarkably strong and healthy looking, and were not so much troubled by skin diseases as is usually the case with the Sakais. After getting all the information I could about the Gunong Tahan or Gunong Siam, I decided to follow the Aring as far as it was possible to go with the native boats, and then strike across country straight for it. We therefore loaded the provisions in eight or nine small dug-outs, and went up stream with these, most of the coolies following us along the bank. After going on in this way for a couple of days I found it impossible to get any farther with the boats, as the river was getting too small, and the boats had continually to be hauled over trees that had fallen across the river and barred the passage. We therefore stopped at a small tributary called Sungei Tamu, and while my Malays made everything ready for the march inland, I sent the Sakais in the jungle to cut a path for us along the bank of the Tamu, which I had decided to follow seeing that it seemed to come from the direction that I wanted to take. The Sakais came back in the evening of the same day and reported having found an elephant track, which they had followed up a high ridge, and they were of the opinion that by following this track we should reach the foot of the mountain. They had come up with the elephants about half way up the mountain, there being seven of them, but as there were no tuskers amongst them, they had not fired on them, and the elephants continued\ntheir journey to the top of the ridge and then disappeared down the other side. We halted two days while the different packages were divided amongst the coolies. The rest of the provisions which we could not take with us were hoisted up in a high tree, for fear of the elephants getting at them, and well covered with mats to protect them against rain, and then we started. In the beginning we got on very well, the ground rising gently the whole time, but as we got higher up on the spur, walking became more difficult, and we had to catch hold of roots and branches to help us in getting up, and had it not been for the deep footprints made in the soil by the elephants it would have been nearly impossible for the coolies to get up with their heavy burdens. I reached the top of the ridge, which proved to be about 3500' high, about noon, together with a few of my Borneo men and a couple of Sakais, and wanted to proceed along the comb of the ridge, which was running in the direction I wanted to take, but the Sakais insisted on our going down the slope on the other side, as they said we should find no water near the top; so I had to give in, and we went down about 1000' till we came to a tiny stream, where I decided to camp for the night. I had not taken any tent with me, but my men soon made a shelter with some large palm leaves, some three feet broad and seven feet long, which we found growing in abundance in altitudes from 500' up to 4500'. None of the other coolies reached our camp that night, and next morning we went farther down the slope till we reached a stream, which the Sakais declared to be the Sungei Tahan, and waited there until all the coolies had arrived. From the river bed we got a fine view of a mountain, that I judged to be about 5000' high, standing straight up and looking very formidable and inaccessible with a magnificent waterfall near the top. The natives declared that this mountain, which was not more than 2 miles distant, was part of Gunong Tahan, the higher part of which was shut out from sight by the high ridges running parallel with the river. We followed up the river for some time, but it was very difficult climbing and when we had reached an altitude of 2500' the coolies declared that they would not go any farther, so I had to make my camp there. Most of the coolies then returned to their villages; but I kept the Sakais and my collectors with\nme, and with these I ascended to the top of the mountain that we had seen from the river. The ascent was however so difficult, that it was impossible to carry anything with us, and we had therefore to return to our old camp every night. Especially the last 500' proved to be very difficult to negotiate, as there was a sheer wall of rock about 300' in height, down which the Tahan river came thundering, forming the splendid waterfall that we had seen from the bottom, and which I christened the Lama Falls. After several failures we at last found a way to the top of the falls and were then confronted by two peaks, nearly inaccessible, and the river seemed to wind its way in between them. We tried to follow up the river, but soon had to stop, on account of huge boulders and deep pools, with sheer walls on each side, making it impossible for us to get through; so we had to give it up, and attempted instead to scale the least forbidding looking of the two peaks.\n\nIn this we succeeded at last, only to find however the top involved in thick mist, so that it was impossible to see anything and to ascertain whether we were really on a spur of the Tahan range or not. As it was impossible to stay up there for the night without any food or shelter, we had to return to our camp, my intention being to get up there again early the next day and have a good look at the surrounding country before the clouds commenced to gather round the mountain tops, as they always do in the afternoon. In the night however I got an attack of fever and was unable to walk for some days, so I sent my men up to try and find out the whereabouts of Gunong Tahan, and they returned with the information that the mountain that we were on was in no way connected with the Tahan, which they said they had seen a long way to the westward, but according to them it would be impossible to get up that mountain from that side, as we were separated from it by a deep chasm, which ran along for many miles, with sheer walls of rock on the other side, up which they declared it impossible for anybody to get. The Sakais stated that they had seen another river coming nearly from the top of the mountain, and this they took to be a branch of the Galas river, another tributary of the Kelantan river; and they strongly advised me to go back, and try to get up the mountain by that route. As they absolutely refused to\nfollow me when I wanted to try and get up from where we were, I had to give it up, though I myself believed it to be possible; and, as after events showed me, it proved to have been the easiest and nearest route to the top. However I made up my mind to return to Kota Bahru and get up another expedition up the Galas river; so I returned to the village Buntie with a few of the Sakais, leaving the rest of them together with my Malays and all our provisions on the mountain; as we had found a number of rare birds there, and I was desirous of getting some more of them. I told my men that they must try and find an easier way to Tahan, and if they succeeded in this they were to wait for me near the top of the mountain. I may as well mention here that some time after I left, my men did find a way up Gunong Tahan, and stayed there for some time waiting for me; but I never met them, as it took me a much longer time to get up the mountain by the Galas route than I expected, and so at last they returned down towards the coast by the same way as they got there. The trip back to Kota Bahru occupied ten days, and I had to wait there another month before I got new provisions and material up from Singapore for my next expedition. When these at last arrived a new start was made but this time I got rather a poor lot of boatmen, the Rajah having lent most of his best men to Messrs. Duff and Lathyen who went up stream just before me to prospect for gold. It therefore took me six days to get up to Quala Lebeh, and there I found the above gentlemen busy prospecting the river bed, having with them a great number of coolies. This time I went past Quala Lebeh, following the true Kelantan river, and in four days reached Quala Galas, where we were detained a short time, owing to the river being in flood. We passed several small tributaries on the way, most of them being uninhabited, being the Rajah's rattan preserves. Once in five to six years he farms each of these rivers out to some of the Chinese traders in Kota Bahru, who then collect all the rattans and other jungle produce, and after that nobody is allowed to touch anything for the next five to six years, thus giving the rattans a chance of growing to a fair size before they are again cut down. We then proceeded up the Galas, which a short distance from its Quala is only about 50 yards wide, and gets narrower farther up, and full of rapids. There\nare a number of small villages on its banks, from which I obtained relays of boatmen, those I had with me from Kota Bahru having by this time all got fever, or were at least pretending to have. As we got farther up, the river got very shallow, and I had to leave the big boats behind, and go on in small dug-outs. We passed a few Chinamen on the way, washing gold, and they told me they could make about 75 cents a day, when working hard. At other places where the Chinamen were working farther inland, they had dammed up the river to obtain sufficient water, causing us a lot of trouble, as we had to unload the boats before we could haul them over these obstacles.\n\nAt last the village of Pulai was reached, and there I had to stop, as it was impossible to proceed any farther by boat. The village contains a couple of hundred inhabitants, nearly all Chinese, there being only a few Malay traders there, who occasionally come up from Kota Bahru and stay there a month or two, until they have bartered all their goods away for gold. Formerly all the Chinese living there were gold miners, but now that all the gold-bearing sand in the river bed has been washed over and over again and the returns are getting less, many of them have settled down as agriculturists and have large paddy fields all round the village. Formerly there must have been a much larger Chinese population in these parts, as traces of very large alluvial workings are found up nearly all the small creeks, being now overgrown and covered with dense jungle. At present there are only a couple of Chinese Kongsis working on anything like a large scale, and I believe they are doing fairly well. Lode working has also been tried by the Malays, but though the ore obtained was of very good quality they soon gave it up, the work proving too hard for them. The formation of the country about there is mostly hard blue limestone which crops through everywhere, the hills in some places rising to a considerable height, mostly impossible to ascend owing to their steep or overhanging walls. All these limestone hills are full of caves and passages made by the water in bygone days, and in places some very curious dripstones* are formed, the best specimen of which is found in a cave close to the village, about\n\n*Stalagmites?\n100' up in a hill, and the Chinese, on account of this bearing some resemblance to one of their deities, formerly used it as a temple, and there is still an old rotten table up there with some candlesticks full of burned joss sticks, and remains of half-burned paper. It has however not been used for a long time, and the ladders that led up to it have long since rotted away, so I had to climb the face of the rock to get up; but I should not recommend anybody to try that experiment, unless he is a good climber. My men that were with me looked at it, and decided that it was safer to stop at the bottom; so I let them remain there, while I went up with a young Malay who had been up there once before. The Chinese are rather afraid to go near these limestone hills as they say that the tigers use the caves as sleeping apartments, and this is very likely, though I never found traces of them in any of the many caves that I visited, whereas I found plenty of traces of elephants in the larger caves that were level with the ground, and the Malays told me that these animals often made them their homes for months at a time. The floors of the caves were often strewn with the remains of dead and broken snail-shells, which had fallen down from the roof in the dry season, when most of the snails die. However I also found a number of live shells hidden away in the dark and moist crevices of the rock, among them several new and rare species. Most of the snails have a great liking for limestone rocks, and the collector will find more specimens in one hour on these rocks than in the jungle for one month.\n\nFrom the top of some of these cliffs I got a good view of the surrounding country, but I looked in vain for a mountain that looked anything like 10,000' high. Towards the East were two mountain ranges which I supposed to be about 6,000' high, the natives calling the most northern Gunong Siam, and the other Tulang Rabong. Gunong Siam appeared to be slightly higher than the other, and the Malays stated that this was the same mountain that the Malays of Pahang called Gunong Tahan. I did not believe this possible, but seeing that the people on the Aring river also called Tahan the Gunong Siam, I decided to ascend the mountain to make sure of it. I had great difficulty in obtaining any coolies to go with me owing to the rivalry\nbetween two of the native chiefs, and had at last to be contented with eight Pahang Malays; so we were only able to carry provisions with us for ten days. The first part of the road lay through fairly flat country and we had no difficulty in cutting a path through,\u2014going northeast by the compass, for none of the Malays had been in that part of the country before. At night we camped on the banks of a fairly large river, which proved to be the Kateh, a tributary of the Galas; and next day we followed this up till we got into the hills, passing an old deserted mining camp on the way. We only had one glimpse of the mountain on our journey, though we climbed several hills to obtain a good view, but always found other hills in front of us obstructing the view towards the mountain. That night we also camped on the banks of the river, which here reaches an altitude of 800' above sea level, the men making a rude shelter of palm leaves, under which we slept undisturbed, though we that day had come across several tracks of tigers. Next day we started up a ridge which we thought sprung from the mountain, but when we at last reached the top of it 2500' up, it proved to be separated from the mountain by another branch of the Kateh river, and so we had to climb down again on the other side. The descent proved to be very difficult, especially the last 300' to 400', and I have no idea how the coolies came down, as each man chose his own way over the face of the cliffs, where overhanging boughs and roots afforded the only support for lowering oneself. All got down without any mishap, and we all collected together in the river bed, which was only about 20' wide, and commenced to look for a way out of the ca\u00f1on or gully that we had got into, and this we found to be no easy task. It was impossible to get up on the other side of the stream, the walls of rock there being even more forbidding looking than those we had descended; and to get up by following the stream was equally impossible as there was a waterfall about 100' in height in front of us, from which the water came rushing down with a deafening noise. There was therefore no alternative left us but to go down stream; and this we did for a short distance, scrambling over huge boulders, wading through deep pools of water, and clinging to narrow ledges of rock where the pools were too deep to wade through; but at last we\ngot to a place where it was impossible to pass through, the bed of the stream being only about four feet wide, and through this narrow passage the water came rushing down over boulders and falls, making it impossible for any living thing to get through. Luckily we found a place where the rocks were less precipitous and we managed to get up these, following the direction of the river till we at last got on more even ground; and as we were by this time all thoroughly done up, we decided to camp on a small level piece of ground, that was situated just where another small mountain stream joined the one we had been following. There was no doubt that this stream came right up from the mountain; so next day we followed it until we reached a ridge. This we commenced to ascend, finding it rather difficult at first to cut a path through the jungle, but when we got farther up we found a fairly good track, evidently made by wild beasts, and the ascent was rather easy after that for the next 2000 feet. We passed a number of the argus pheasants' sporting places, on the way up, and heard their shrill cries all round, but never saw any, though I often tried to get near them and have a shot; but they were very shy and cleared away before I could see them. As we got higher and higher up, the path was evidently less used by animals, and got overgrown, until it was completely lost; and we then had to cut our way through low but very dense and thorny jungle, full of a kind of thin rattans, the leaves of which with their hundreds of bent thorns proved a great hindrance to our progress, as they caught hold of our clothes everywhere, and as soon as we had got loose from one of the leaves, we were hooked on to by half a dozen others. About two o'clock in the afternoon we came out on a small plateau at a height of about 4000', and from there we had a good look at the top of the mountain which was not very far off; but as at the rate that we were travelling, it would not be possible to reach it that day, we left the plateau, and followed the slope of the ridge until we reached a dried-up water course; and finding a little water in a hollow, we decided to camp there. There were no large palm leaves to be found thereabout, and so darkness and rain came upon us before we had finished our shelter, and we passed a miserable night, wet and shivering with cold, as the rain had put our fires out. Next morning we had\na hurried breakfast, being anxious to reach the top as early as possible before the clouds commenced to gather round it. The rain had made everything nasty and slippery, and as we had to get up the steep slope, it took us some considerable time before we again got out on the ridge, and both I and the coolies had some bad falls and got a good deal bruised. After getting out on the ridge the ascent was again easier, going up very gradually, but the rattan jungle still gave us lots of trouble, and as I had to go ahead myself and clear the way I got the skin of my face and hands torn a good deal, and smeared all over with blood. At last we reached the top of the mountain, which proved to be only 5500' high, so I was quite certain that it could not be Gunong Tahan.\n\nWe had a splendid view from there toward the north across immense stretches of low and flat land,\u2014Gunong Siam being evidently the last peak to the northward of that range of mountains in the middle of the Peninsula, whereof Gunong Tahan forms a part. The mountains to the south and south-east were hidden from view, being enveloped in the clouds. The top of Gunong Siam is only a long and very narrow ridge, being in some places only four feet wide, and covered with thick brushwood. After the coolies had rested for an hour I sent them down another side of the mountain, which I thought would take us down to the Kateh river sooner, with orders to stop as soon as they found water and suitable camping ground. I remained on the top of the mountain together with one of the Malays, in the hope that the clouds would clear away and enable me to get a view of the other mountains. In this I was not disappointed, as the mist cleared during the afternoon, and I got a good view of the Tulang Rabong range to the south and south-east, from which we seemed to be separated by the river Kateh. This range is about the same height as Gunong Siam, and behind it, far away to the southeast, I now and then got a glimpse of a higher mountain the top of which was continually hidden by the clouds; and I felt certain that this must be Gunong Tahan, there being no other mountain in sight approaching the same height as that. I saw at once that it would be impossible to reach it by going straight from where we were, as we should have to cross ridge after ridge of Pulang Rabong to get there, and\nafter the experience that we had had of the Kateh ridges I thought it most probable that we should never get there that way. We could either go round to the north of Gunong Siam, and then due south till we reached the foot of the mountain (and this would certainly save us a lot of trouble as the country round that way seemed to be fairly flat), or else we could go to the southward of Tulang Rabong and then straight to Gunong Tahan. This route appeared to be the shortest from Pulai, and I selected it though I knew the country to the southwards to be very mountainous, and difficult to get through; but as I wanted to do a little collecting on the Tulang Rabang, this suited me the best. After being fully satisfied that it was really Gunong Tahan that we were looking at, we commenced our descent, a shower of rain hurrying us on, and we soon overtook the coolies, who had not yet found any suitable place for camping. It was already commencing to get dark, and we were threatened with heavy rain so we hurried on as fast as the ground would allow us to travel, and just before it got dark we found a place beside a small stream, with plenty of large palm leaves close by, so all hands were soon busy making a shelter; and just as the rain came pouring down we had got it ready, and could cook our dinner. The camp was at 4000' so it was rather cold up there, and we had to keep a large fire burning the whole night; but still the Malays complained about the cold, and were glad when we started next morning for the valley. We expected to strike our old track from Pulai during that day, but somehow we missed it, and got into country unknown to us; so I decided to follow the Kateh down stream, until we reached the village which I knew existed close to its junction with the Galas. We reached the place late the next afternoon, and slept that night in a small Malay hut. Next day I got a couple of Malay guides, who took us back to Pulai where I arrived shortly after noon; but some of the poor coolies did not arrive till shortly before dark, being thoroughly done up, with their feet full of thorns and bleeding from innumerable leech bites.\n\nWe now remained some days in Pulai to recoup ourselves, during which time I tried hard to get some more coolies; but only succeeded in getting two more from a village down river\nas none of the Chinese from Pulai would go with me into the jungle. It was now the beginning of September, and the rainy season was commencing, so we were likely to have a rather bad time of it during our journey. The night before we started on our second trip it rained very heavily, and in the morning all the jungle paths in the low land were transformed into small streams, and the rivers were all in flood. For half a day we followed a track which ran due south into Pahang, the borders of which are only one day's journey from Pulai; but coming across an old Chinese gold mine, all overgrown with jungle, we completely lost sight of the path, and after wasting some time trying to find it again I decided to cut a path myself, going in a more easterly direction as I was afraid we were getting too far south. After doing this for some time we came across another old disused path evidently leading to some other old workings, and this we followed till evening, when we camped at a small stream. Next day we reached a large limestone cliff, at least 500' high, very long but narrow, being in one place where a narrow passage ran right though it, not more than 20' wide, whereas it must have been several miles long, for I started to go round it, but after marching for one hour and seeing no sign of the end of it, I gave it up and returned. We found a small cave (Goa the Malays call them), and we camped in it for the night, the Malays however preferring to sleep outside, as a cold wind seemed to be coming down through some opening in the roof. I sent a couple of my best men out to try and scale the cliff and obtain a view of Tahan, which we had not yet seen on this journey; but they found it impossible to get up, the sides being everywhere perpendicular or overhanging, and there were no bushes or roots growing on the sides, to hold on by. The following day we struck a branch of the Kateh river, which ran in a southerly direction, and following it up we came to a deep pool full of fish; so I discharged a dynamite cartridge in the midst of them, and that night my Malays had a real feast, fresh fish being very scarce at Pulai, for there are none to be found in the Ulu Galas, where all the deep pools in the river have long since been filled up by the washings from the gold mines, leaving the fishes no place to breed or hide from their enemies. We then ascended a ridge running parallel with the\nTulang Rabong range, and reached a height of 2500', but had to descend again on the other side, as a river had to be crossed which proved to be a branch of the Tenom, which again is a tributary of the large Pahang river. The descent was very steep and very slippery from the rain and just as we reached the river bed I slipped on a large boulder, and fell with great force against a large root, hurting my right side very much, and was unable to move for some time. I was afraid I should be unable to continue the journey, and we had to camp there that night, but next morning I felt much better and so we pushed on for another two days, when we struck another of the Pahang rivers, but whether this was another branch of the Tenom or whether it was the Kechau I was unable to determine. It rose near the top of Tulang Rabong, as I found out later by following it up very nearly to its source, about 5000' up. We camped at the only level place that we could find, about 1500' above sea level, but at night after a heavy rain we were nearly routed out of our camp by the river, which rose with startling suddenness and nearly flooded us out. The roar of the water rushing past us at a tremendous speed dashing against boulders and over falls was something not to be easily forgotten, and made sleep impossible that night. I decided to let most of my men remain at this place, while I went back to Pulai to obtain a fresh supply of provisions, but before doing so I ascended another range of hills that ran parallel with the river on the opposite side, and reached a height of 4500' from where I had a fine view of Gunong Tahan. I thought it would take us 4 to 5 days to reach the foot of it, and told my men to commence cutting a path up to it while I was away, at Pulai. I then went back, taking with me only two coolies, and walking hard for 2\u00bd days we reached Pulai. It proved very difficult to obtain sufficient coolies at once, so I had to send 10 men off first, with provisions for my men, while the headman of Pulai sent for the Malays living farther down stream to come up and go with me. Twelve days were lost in waiting for them, and when they at last arrived there were only 15 of them instead of 25 that I wanted, but finding it useless to wait any longer I started off with these men, taking as much provisions with us as they could carry. These men came from the low land down river and\nwere not used to work in the mountains, so they very soon got\ntired, and I had continually to sit down and wait for them. We\nreached the camp of my Malays in four days, and it was my in-\ntention to push on the next day for the foot of Tahan; but my\nPahang Malays, who had been out cutting part of the path while\nI had been away, had found this such hard work and such diffi-\ncult climbing that they refused to go on. I argued with them\na long time but it was no use, and promises or threats of\npunishment had equally little effect on them, and next morning\nthey had disappeared, leaving behind them their parangs and\nspare clothing, which I had taken from them the previous\nevening, thinking thereby to prevent them from running away.\nWhen the Kelantan Malays saw this they also refused to go any\nfarther, and the whole lot of them went back to Pulai leaving\nme only six men that I had with me from Kota Bahru, and a\ncouple of Pahang men that joined me a few days later. Includ-\ning myself and my Chinese boy we were nine in all, and to\npush on for Gunong Tahan with so few men would have been\nuseless, as we should only have been able to carry enough\nprovisions to take us to the foot of the mountain and back;\nwhereas I wanted to stay some time near the top of the moun-\ntain to collect specimens. Therefore I decided to remain where\nwe were, in the hope that the headman at Pulai would send the\nKelantan Malays back to me, when he heard how I was situated;\nand this proved to be correct, the men returning to me at the\nend of twelve days. In the meantime we had done some collect-\ning, and got a few rare birds and some orchids. My boy who\nhad seen the Chinese at Pulai working gold amused himself by\nprospecting in the river bed; and one day he brought back to\nthe camp a large piece of quartz which proved to be very rich,\nthe gold being visible running right through it. The lode that\nit came from could not have been far off, as the mountain which\nthe river sprang from was quite close, but we had no time to\nlook for it.\n\nIt was my intention to take that piece of quartz back with\nme to Pulai on the return journey; but, as luck would have it, I\nnever came back that way; and so it is still lying there waiting\nfor somebody to come and pick it up. Having got the men\nback we then made another start, having first to climb the ridge\n4500' high in front of us, and this proved such hard work that the men could not walk any farther when we reached the top, and so we camped there, going down the other side next morning. There we again got into Kelantan territory, crossing a branch of the Galas river, and went up a long and high ridge forming the boundary between Pahang and Kelantan. It was right from the foot of Tulong Rabong to Gunong Tahan, and as it did not appear to be known to the Malays, we christened it Bukit Gajah on account of the number of elephants that were to be found there, the top of the ridge seeming to be their regular highway. We saw only female elephants, the males being very scarce in Kelantan, where everybody is allowed to shoot them, and before long these will be quite extinct. We kept along this ridge for four days, reaching a height of 4500' and then commenced to descend, being then opposite to Gunong Tahan, and only separated from it by a river, which proved to be the Relai, a tributary of the Lebeh. None of the branches of the Galas come from the mountain, and it was evidently a great mistake my trying to get up from there, as the way up from the Relai or Aring rivers is much nearer and easier. The descent was difficult and would have been well nigh impossible if the elephants had not been there before us; but by following their tracks, and using the deep indents made by their huge feet, we managed to scramble down and reach the river, which is here 1200' above sea level. Arriving there the Kelantan Malays left me and returned to their homes, and I was not sorry to lose them this time, as these men had enormous appetites and were eating up nearly all my provisions. The rest of us stayed a couple of days at the river, and then, having found a spur that seemed to go in the right direction, we commenced the ascent.\n\nThe first 1000' were very difficult, and took us a long time to negotiate, but after that we got out on another spur and the ascent got much easier, there being a fairly good track made by wild beasts. Reaching a height of 4000' we got into rattan jungle, which seems to grow on all the Kelantan mountains of any height; so we left the comb of the spur and went down the side until we found water, where we then camped; but could not find any level place for our shelter, and had to build it on the side of the hill, and as it came on to rain\nheavily towards evening we had a rather bad time of it that night, as the water came pouring down the hillside on the ground that we slept upon I, myself, was lying on a few raised sticks and was fairly well off; but the Malays had been too lazy to cut enough of these for themselves, and so had to sleep on the ground on a few leaves, with the water running in streams under them. Next morning on starting we soon got into rattan jungle again, and owing to the difficulty of getting through this, we only got up another 1000' that day, camping at night by the side of a small stream. As this seemed to be a likely place for collecting purposes, I decided to make it my headquarters for the time that we stayed on the mountains. It took us two more days to cut a path to the top of the mountain, the jungle being very dense and difficult to cut through. Every afternoon it rained heavily, so that we always got drenched before we could get back to camp; and as the path we had cut was only a very poor affair, we had to go bent double half of the way on account of overhanging branches, and it was very annoying to feel the water running from my cap down my neck, finding its way down my back, and finally coming out of my shoes. In the camp it was very cheerless too, in the evening, there being only very few leaves suitable for making a roof in the neighbourhood and consequently our shelter was very small and badly made. From the top of the mountain, we saw the village on the Aring river where I had stayed on my first trip, and as that appeared to be the only place within measurable distance from which we could obtain any food, I decided to send some of my men there to get a fresh supply of provisions, as we were running short of these. I told the men to follow the Relai river, when they reached the foot of the mountain, until they were clear of the hills, and then strike across country till they reached the Aring, when they were to follow that stream till the village was reached. There they were to buy provisions and get some coolies to carry them back to us. I sent three men, and when they left we had only provisions left us for another ten days; but by giving out short rations I hoped to get them to last until the men could come back from the village. The rest of us stayed up there collecting, and I found the best collecting ground to be between 5000' to 7000', but we also went several times right up\nto the top when the weather was fine, in the hope of finding traces of the men that I left on my first trip; but could find none where we were, which, considering the immense size of the mountain, was not at all strange, as half a dozen different parties might have been on the mountain, without seeing each other. Far away we could see a large black patch that looked as if the low jungle had been burned away; but it was too far for us to attempt to reach it, as we should not have been able to do much collecting on the way, and I wanted to get together as large a collection as possible before our provisions gave out. Later on, I found out that it really was a piece of jungle that my men had burned down to attract our attention, but they had already left the mountain two months before we reached it. The mountain seemed really to consist of three separate ranges running parallel from about east to west, connected with each other at their highest points by a number of peaks, the one in the middle being the highest. In the ravines between the different ranges the following rivers had their sources, as far as I was able to judge with the help of my Pahang Malays:\u2014towards the Kelantan side the river Relai and two branches of the Aring: towards the Pahang side the rivers Kechau, Tahan, and perhaps also another branch of the Tembeling,\u2014as I am not sure that the river which we struck on my first trip was not a branch of that river, and not the Tahan as the Sakais stated. I found that all the branches of these rivers which sprung from anywhere near the top of the mountain, had very discoloured water, something like the water found in stagnant swamps; whereas the streams that came from an altitude of less than 4000' had beautifully clear water; but what might be the reason of this I did not find out. Nearly the whole of the mountain consists of white quartz. From my own experience on the Tahan or Tembeling river, and from what I saw from the top, I should say that it will be very difficult to get up from the Pahang side, as the mountain on that side is very precipitous (probably deriving its name of Tahan on that account) and provisions have to be carried a much greater distance than from the Kelantan side. I only saw one village on the Pahang side, lying beside a huge limestone cliff that somewhat resembled the shape of an elephant; but none of my men could give me any\ninformation as to the name of the river by which it was situated. If anybody wants to try and get up from the Pahang side I would recommend him to start from that village. There was a very grand view from the top, especially very early in the morning, when the mist covered all the low-lying land, making it resemble a lake of snow; and so low did the mist keep to the ground that the top of some of the tall jungle trees could be seen, looking like masts of sunken ships, and the smaller mountains stood out dark and sombre like islands in this beautiful lake. Later on in the day the mist would gradually rise and come rolling up the mountain side, with the dark clouds gathering fast near the top, and in the afternoon and evening the rain would come down in torrents. The trees and rocks were all covered with masses of long moss in which the rain kept hanging, so that it was impossible to move about without getting wet; and we had to go about day after day in wet clothes, with wind and rain blowing in on us at night. Besides which my Malays suffered much from the cold at night, when the temperature often went down to 50\u00b0.\n\nAltogether I stayed eighteen days near the top of the mountain, and I got a very good collection of birds and some orchids; but I was only able to take a small quantity of the latter, as transporting a large number of them to the coast would have been impossible with the few men that I had. Of mammals we only got very few, and the same was the case with insects, of which I had hoped to get a lot; but with the wet and miserable weather that we had, all the insects that we saw flew very high, and even if they had come down, it would have been nearly impossible to chase and catch them in the thick low brushwood that covered the whole of the upper part of the mountain.\n\nFor the last few days that we stayed up there we only got half rations, as I was very loath to go down, hoping that the three men would return from the village in time with the provisions; when it was my intention to remain up there for another fourteen days. But when the last grain of rice and all the tinned provisions were finished, we had to start on the way down, taking with us all my collections except the orchids, which I was forced to leave behind as we could not carry them with us. I expected to find the men with the provisions at the foot of the mountain,\nbut on arriving there we found no sign of them. However I had left there four tins of salmon and two pounds of biscuits when we went up the mountain, and we now made a scanty meal of half of these, reserving the other half for next day. At night we discussed what was to be done, and as all the Malays wanted to make for the nearest village to obtain food there, I gave in; though I would rather have remained at the foot of the mountain and waited for the return of the three men, living on the mountain on such game as we could shoot and snare. Early next morning we started, leaving most of my things behind in the camp, taking with us only a blanket each, and my collection of birds. My Malays wanted me to leave the latter behind to enable us to travel quicker, but I was afraid the skins would be spoiled before we could return for them, and so I made the men carry them along. Following the Relai river we soon came past the mountain, and as the three men who had gone before us had made a track for us we got on rather quickly. A couple of hours walking brought us to a shelter where these men had camped, and beyond this were two tracks, so it was evident the men had gone wrong first, and finding this out, had returned to this place and struck out in another direction. We kept on following the river, but soon got into difficult country, with spurs from the mountains running right down to the river, so that we often had to cross the same, to escape having to climb over these hills, some of which were rather high and steep. Having to cross the river so often delayed us a good deal, as the river was in flood, the water coming tearing down with great force; and great care had to be taken in crossing over. The course of the river was very crooked indeed; but we had to keep to the banks and follow all its bends and windings, as we got into the hills as soon as we attempted to cut off some of the corners; and the Malays declared they were unable to do any climbing, as they had had so little food for the last few days. So on the whole I do not think we got very far that day. After rigging up a shelter for the night we fired a couple of dynamite cartridges in some pools in the rivers, but only got a few small fishes, that would scarcely have satisfied the hunger of one man, so I got the Malays to collect some young palm shoots, and we made a meal of them; but the Malays declared that they were\nno good, saying there was absolutely no strength in them, and on the following days I could not get them to collect any. The next day we kept on following the river, hoping to find some bamboos, of which we then intended to make a raft and drift down stream until we reached the Sakai settlement which I knew existed there; but to our great disappointment there were none to be found in that part of the country, so we kept trudging along, now on this, and now on that side of the river, the Malays complaining very much, and getting more disheartened the farther we went. I tried my best to cheer them up and get them to hurry on, but finding this useless, I left them and went on by myself till some time in the afternoon; when having found a suitable place for camping I sat down and waited for them. When they at last arrived I had great difficulty in getting them to collect leaves for a shelter, as none of the large kind of palm leaves were to be found in the vicinity, and the men preferred to sleep in the open, rather than to take the trouble of making a shelter of the smaller leaves found there. However I insisted on having one built, and lucky it was that I did so, as the rain came pouring down as soon as it was finished, and this lasted half the night, so we should have been in a sorry plight had we had no roof over us. While the men made the shelter I fired another charge of dynamite in a pool, and this time I was more successful, getting a number of good-sized fishes. So we had enough for a fairly good meal that night and for another the next morning before we started, that being the last food we tasted before we reached the village four days later. The river was now in flood to such an extent that it was dangerous to cross over, and as we could not keep continually on one side of it owing to the many hills, we decided to leave it altogether and strike across country until we reached the Aring, where we could make a raft and drift down to the village. Soon after we had left the river bank, we got to some hills, and seeing no chance of getting round by the foot of them, I started climbing up, the Malays of course protesting; but as I did not take any notice of that, they had to follow me, grumbling very much as they went, and sitting down very often to rest. My Chinese boy proved to be the best man of the lot and kept fairly close behind me, whereas the Malays were soon left far behind.\nThe hill proved to be very much higher and steeper than I expected, being in fact a mountain range 3,000' high, dividing the Relai and Aring rivers, and the Malays were terribly done up when they at last reached the top. While I waited for them up there, I found a spur sloping gently down on the other side towards the north-east, and this we now followed right to the foot of the range, where we came across a small stream and camped close by it. We had no dinner that night, but there being still some tea left, we each had a cup of this before going to sleep. Following the stream next day we at last reached the Aring river, of which this was a tributary called Patei. It was about noon when we struck the Aring, and great was our joy on finding an old disused bamboo raft lying half way up on the banks. It had evidently been left there by some gutta hunters, and we soon had it in the water; luckily it was just big enough to hold us and our things, and after having cut some long poles to steer with, we started on our way down river.\n\nOwing to the late heavy rains the river was in flood, and this was rather in our favour, as there would be no shallow places over which we otherwise would have had to haul the raft. We were travelling at a great rate of speed, it being impossible to stop the raft, but we did not anticipate any danger, as the Malays seemed well able to steer us clear of all rocks and snags. The men were all in high glee, now, at the prospect of soon reaching the village, shouting, singing and chaffing each other, and in their own estimation they were evidently great heroes. So we went dashing down one rapid after the other, the men yelling derision at them all, when just as we came round a bend in the river we dashed into the stem of a huge tree that had fallen across the stream and effectually blocked the whole river. The thing happened so suddenly that it was impossible to do anything to prevent it; there was a great cracking of the bamboos and down went the raft, throwing us all out in the river. We all managed to scramble up on the tree, and as all our things were light we fished them up again, with the exception of my only pair of shoes, which I had taken off as a precaution when we started, in case we should have to swim for it. We also managed to haul the raft up over the tree, and\nas the Malays thought that it would still hold together, we decided to go on with it. A great many of the bamboos had been split open by the collision, so the raft was not nearly as buoyant as it had been before, and could scarcely carry us all. Going down over the rapids now became very dangerous, as the water would come rolling in over the raft, pressing now this now that side under water, so that we had difficulty in balancing ourselves on it, and I was afraid the raft would go to pieces at any minute. So after we had had about one hour of this dangerous sport, I thought it better to stop and keep to the jungle. So we landed and made a shelter, but it was a very poor one, the Malays being now again very disheartened, did not work very willingly, and the rain coming on again we passed a really miserable night in our wet clothes, with wet blankets, and the rain dripping on us from above, and running in streams under the few leaves on which we had made our bed, and without a morsel of food. Next day we looked for bamboos with which to repair our raft, but not finding any, we had to abandon it and start on our weary tramp again. I went ahead myself cutting a path for the others, as they all had something to carry, and a pretty bad time I had of it with my bare feet; for as I had to keep looking ahead, I could not always see where I put my feet, and as a consequence I often trod on thorns and sharp sticks; besides which there were thousands of leeches about, which took a great fancy to my bare legs, where they stuck till they had had their fill, as I often felt too weary to stoop down and pick them off. We knew that there was a native path on one side of the river, running from the village into Pahang; and so we went inland away from the river, trying to find it, but coming to a range of hills the Malays declared themselves unable to get over them; so we had to go back to the river and follow its many bends and curves. Often we had to make great detours inland when we came to tributaries of the Aring, which were deep and swollen, so that we had to find fords before we could cross over them. We walked the whole day, camping just before it got dark, and started off again early next morning, having then good hopes of reaching the village that day, as I had found some landmarks that I knew. The Malays were however very slow, so I got\nfar ahead of them all, by myself, thinking they would hurry on when they found that they were being left so far behind. Towards three o'clock in the afternoon, just when I had decided to stop and await my men, I heard a shout down river, and on my answering, a boat appeared, that had been sent up from the village to meet us. Two of the Malays whom I thought were far behind me had lost my track altogether, and in looking for it they had come across the real path to the village, and this cheering them up, they had hurried on to the village, and hearing there that we had not yet arrived, they sent a boat up stream to meet us. I waited till my other men came up, and then we all went down the river to the village, arriving there just as a heavy thunderstorm came on, and very thankful were we to be under a good roof again. The day after, the three men that I had sent for provisions came back to the village with a long tale of woe. They had arrived there four or five days before us, having taken fourteen days to reach it, whereas it took us only seven days. They had then bought some provisions and started on their return journey to the mountain. When two days out, their Sakai coolies ran away and left them; and instead of pushing on by themselves as they ought to have done, they returned to the village to obtain other coolies. So it was well for us that we did not stop at the foot of the mountain and wait for them to come back.\n\nAfter the men had rested for four or five days, I sent them back to the mountain, together with a number of Malays from the village, to fetch the orchids and my other things that we had left behind. The coolies were to bring these back to Buntie, whereas my own men would go from the mountain back to Pulai, where they would fetch those of my things that I had left there; and then going down by the Galas river, join me at Kota Bahru. It was impossible for me to return to the mountain myself, having no shoes, with my feet in a terrible state, swollen and torn, so that I was scarcely able to walk for days after. Had it been otherwise I should certainly have gone back and stayed up on the mountain for another month. Shortly after the men had left I got a bad attack of fever, which luckily did not last very long but left me very weak. I got a tiger while waiting for the return of the men, there seeming to be\nplenty of them in that part of the country, as a report came to hand that two men had been eaten by them at Quala Aring just before. Going down stream we passed eight of them,\u2014two old and a young one,\u2014that were disporting themselves in the jungle close to the bank; but we were then just passing over a rapid, and travelling at a great speed, so that it was impossible to get a shot at them. After waiting ten days the coolies returned, and I started on the return journey to Kota Bahru, the trip down stream taking only eight days, as all the rivers were in flood. The men that I had left on my first trip upon the mountain I picked up on the way down, and they stated that they had succeeded in scaling one of the peaks of the Tahan, to the south of where I got up, and they brought a fairly good collection of skins back with them.\n\nI had to wait about a week in Kota Bahru for my men from the Galas river, and then went back to Singapore, the whole trip taking seven months instead of three as I had reckoned on.\nOn the Hymenoptera collected by Mr. Robert Shelford at Sarawak, and on the Hymenoptera of the Sarawak Museum.\n\nBy P.

It has 3- and 6-jointed palpi as in Zethus, and it has further the head largely developed behind the eyes as in that genus and thereby differs from Eumenes. The petiole is shorter and stouter than it is in the typical Zethus and also the second segment is not contracted at the base into a neck. The form of the cubital cellules is different from what they are in Eumenes and more like what they are in Zethus. It is not a typical Montezumia either, although it has certainly some affinity to that genus, which has five jointed maxillary palpi.

Any vocabularies, grammatical notes, specimens of sentences with literal (verbatim) translations, and even lists of personal names, would be welcome, if accompanied by a clear statement of (1) the name of the tribe to which they refer; (2) its location (district and state, and approximate position on the map) and, if possible, (3) a short description of its physical characteristics.\n\nI venture to appeal to members of the Society, or their friends, who may have collected such information, but have not the leisure or the inclination to work it up themselves, to assist me in this way in the work of collating these dialects. Much valuable material remains unpublished and is ultimately lost because men, who have been at some trouble to collect it, keep it back with a view to completing it with additional matter which they eventually have not time to collect.\n\nI am particularly in want of specimens of the aboriginal dialects of the Negri Sembilan and Pahang, but any information relating to the aborigines of the Peninsula will be most welcome.\n\nWhile on the subject of dialects, may I venture to draw the attention of the members of the Society to the importance of accurately recording the various dialects of Malay which are spoken in the Peninsula. Apart from a few scrappy notes about the pronunciation of certain letters, practically nothing has been done in this department. There are now, however, in most districts of the Peninsula, Europeans well qualified by a more than adequate knowledge of standard Malay, and if each of them were to compile a record of the local peculiarities of\nthe dialect spoken in the particular district where he was stationed, the result would be an invaluable contribution to the scientific study of the Malayan languages. Local dialects, which were formerly neglected under the mistaken idea that they were mere corruptions of the standard or written language, are now recognized to be of great importance from the philological point of view, and in many countries they are being accurately recorded and studied. It is regrettable that in this respect we should lag so far behind the Dutch, who have by this time compiled more or less adequate records (some of them in every way admirable) of almost every language and dialect spoken in their vast section of the Archipelago. To take one instance, of which I have some slight personal knowledge: we possess an excellent Dutch dictionary of Menangkabau Malay and a goodly number of specimens in prose and verse, of that curious and interesting dialect, yet, though this same dialect, with slight variations, is spoken in Naning (Malacca) and the Negri Sembilan, where scores of Englishmen have heard it spoken, we have no adequate English record of it.\n\nWhat is wanted, among other things, is an accurate account of\n\n1. peculiarities of intonation and accent;\n2. peculiarities of pronunciation of particular syllables, especially finals;\n3. grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, if any, e.g., the use of prefixes or suffixes different from those of ordinary Malay; and differences in the construction of sentences;\n4. preference for one of two synonyms where the standard Malay prefers the other;\n5. the use of words with a meaning differing from that which they have in the standard language;\n6. local words, simple and derivative, not found in the standard language;\n7. local phrases, turns of speech and idioms.\n\nAnother subject which needs working up is that of place-names, both those that appear to be Malay and such as have no meaning in Malay and are probably in some cases Aboriginal.\nThese latter may eventually throw considerable light on that dark subject, the condition of the Peninsula prior to the Malay immigration.\n\nI need hardly add that though I have specially dwelt on the Malay Peninsula, as the immediate domain of the Society's scientific interests, yet I do not mean to underrate the importance of contributions relating to other Malayan countries.\n\nC.

Straits Branch.\nMALAY SUPERSTITIONS.\n\nEvery division of the human race has superstitions, but a writer in the Straits Echo is of opinion that Malay superstitions are among the most peculiar. For instance, when there is an eclipse of the moon or sun, the Malays abstain from taking food and perform their ablutions, in order that no contagious disease may attack them. Crows are an ill omen, and whenever a crow caw-caws near a Malay habitation it means death to some one of the inmates. Supposing a Malay walks along a road and suddenly a black cat crosses before him, he will at once turn back and walk along another path. The crossing of the black cat signifies danger involving the loss of life!\n\nYou seldom see Malays bite their nails, because this action is likely to lead the doer into poverty. If a Malay sees a pig or a Chinese funeral before the sun rises, say at 5.30 a.m., he knows that he is lucky and whatever he does on this day he is sure to meet with success. Dreaming of jumping a brooklet assures the dreamer that death will ensue in a short time, and in this case the unhappy man generally distributes alms to the poor so that his life may be prolonged. To see a monkey in the morning is an ill omen and signifies that the see will lose money heavily in trade. If bees make their hive on or near your house, it is a good omen and signifies that the inmates will be prosperous. This superstition seems to have some foundation, owing to the fact that for two consecutive years, 1902 and 1903, two swarms of bees invaded the Free School and stayed on the School buildings for some hours. Soon after the arrival of the good-omened bees, news was received from England to the effect that the Free School boys had gained the Queen's Scholarships; so the bees brought prosperity! Malays always revere the bees and whenever a swarm visits their abode they are always ready to make room for them.\n\nYou can scarcely ever get your money from a Malay on Friday, because they believe that if they pay their creditors on a Friday, they will be overtaken by penury. Malays never shave or cut their nails on Saturday or Tuesday, because these are unlucky days. And if they depart with their hair or nails on these days they believe that they will be always in trouble or will die quickly. The Malay never sleeps in the afternoon, for such an action shortens life! When a rat bites a Malay's clothes, it signifies ill luck, and usually the rat-bitten clothes are given away to the poor. There is a kind of bird called by the Malays Rowk-rowk which does not build a nest, and lives in fields. The Malays say that whoever obtains a Rowk-rowk's nest will become invisible as soon as he puts the nest on his head! Of course, the Malays believe that there is such a nest, despite the fact that the bird never builds one. If a Malay feels that his right hand is itchy, he is glad because he will receive a large sum of money, and if he feels that his right eye moves, he knows that he will see a foreign friend. If tears issue from either eye, he understands that a relation of his will die, and if he too often forgets his promises to his many friends, he is aware that he will die and will shed tears rather profusely.\nA Malayan Element in some of the Languages of Southern Indo-China.\n\nBy C.

Straits Branch.\nas genuine Malayan languages overlaid with foreign accretions, or, on the other hand, as alien tongues containing a large number of old Malayan loan words, is not for the present purpose very material. In order to decide this point and to determine whether these mixed languages partake more of the Malayan or of the Mon-Annam type, a careful study of their structure and grammar would be required, but the materials for such a study are at present very deficient, and in either case these dialects even in their present state presuppose, as I intend to show, the existence of a distinct Malayan continental group established at a very remote period in the south of Indo-China.\n\nThe chief of these languages is Cham, the language of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Champa, which in medieval times occupied the country now called Annam, and in the period just preceding its fall (which occurred in A.D. 1471) had its centre on the East coast of Indo-China about lat. $14^\\circ$ N., though one of its earlier capitals was as far north as lat. $17^\\circ 37'$ N. This language is still spoken in a few inland villages of the Annamese province of Binh Thuan, near lat. $12^\\circ$ N., and by the emigrant Cham community in Camboja; the latter is now Muhammadan in its entirety, but the Chams that remain in Annam are mostly pagans. Each group has its own dialect, but apart from slight variations the language of both is the same. It is written in a complex alphabet of Indian origin: inscriptions, both in Sanskrit and in Cham, abound in Annam, and the former go back to about the 3rd century after our era.*\n\n* The Sanskrit inscriptions were dealt with in a paper \"L'Ancien Royaume de Campa d'apres les inscriptions\" by M. Abel Bergaigne in the Journal Asiatique (Paris) Jan. Feb. 1888.\n\nThe inscriptions in Cham, which have more interest for us, from the Malayan point of view, than the Sanskrit ones, have been dealt with by M. Etienne Aymonier in a paper \"Premi\u00e8re \u00c9tude sur les Inscriptions Tchames,\" in the same journal, Jan. Feb. 1891. The earliest known of these Cham inscriptions dates from about the beginning of the 9th century A.D.\n\nIn an inscription dated a little later, recording the dedication of two fields to pious uses, the expression used is *huma dua nan*, lit. \"fields two those\"; the word for God is *Yang*, the old word which survives in Malay *kayangan* and *sembahyang*. Most of the rest of the inscription is full of Sanskrit words, as indeed the whole series\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nto Ptolemy the metropolis of this region was Balonga. This place can be clearly identified,* on other grounds besides mere similarity of name, with Bal-Angou\u00e9, of which the ruins situated near the coast about lat. 14\u00b0 N are still in existence, and which was therefore apparently the first, or at least the earliest known, as it ultimately became the last, of the Cham capitals. Its fall is narrated, curiously enough, in the S\u00ebjarah Malayu, where it is called Bal, the generic Cham word for \"metropolis\" or \"capital.\"\n\nThe Chams, in fact, are the remnants of what was once a highly civilized nation: they were the furthest outpost of Indian civilization on the Asiatic continent, and their country was a borderland where for over a thousand years Indian culture struggled with and was eventually vanquished by Chinese, the latter being represented by the Annamese, who though non-Chinese in origin had become civilized under Chinese tutelage.\n\nSuch is the history of the Chams in outline: but legends carry it back even further, for the Cambojan traditions, for what they are worth, represent the Chams as having been in occupation of Camboja when the Cambojans first arrived there, some centuries before the Christian era: the immigrant Cambajans are said to have intermingled at first with the Chams but eventually to have got the upper hand and driven out their king.\n\nPhysically the Chams appear to resemble the Malay and Indo-Chinese types, being described as somewhat fairer than the former. Some of them appear to show traces of Indian and Arab blood. Their language, of which a good grammar has been published, is in its present condition a mixed language containing a relatively large number of Mon-Annam elements. Some have regarded it as a Mon-Annam language saturated with Malayan loan words, others maintain that it is a Malayan language modified by Mon-Annam influences. As will appear in the sequel, I am not sure that this may not be something\n\nof Cham inscriptions appear to be, the language in which they were written bearing much the same relation to the spoken Cham, as Kawi probably did to the contemporary spoken Javanese.\n\nThe series extends into the 15th century, to a few years before the fall of the kingdom.\n\n* See J. R. A. S. (1899) 665.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nlike a distinction without a difference; but certain it is, at any rate, that Cham contains a very large percentage (perhaps nearly 50 per cent.) of pure Malayan words; and in this respect it seems to exceed its neighbours, the dialects to be next mentioned.\n\nIt is in the hilly country bounding Annam on the west and separating it from the valley of the Mekong River, about lat. 13\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 N., that these three dialects are found: they are spoken by three savage tribes called respectively Cancho, Rod\u00e9 and Chr\u00e9ai. These tribes appear to be on much the same plane of civilization as the Orang Hutan of the South of the Malay Peninsula; their dialects are unwritten, and we owe such slight knowledge of them as we possess to the investigations of the three or four French explorers and administrators who have interested themselves in them. Practically that merely amounts to vocabularies of about 120 or 150 words of each of these dialects.* Besides these, there are other dialects in this region which are apparently more or less related to the above, and of some of which even less is known: \u2020 most of them however show decidedly more relationship with the Mon-Annam than with the Malayan family, the elements which they have in common with the latter decreasing in relative importance as one proceeds north and west from the old Cham region.\n\nThe only other dialect I propose to deal with here belongs to a different quarter altogether: it is spoken by the Selung (or Silung or Salone, as they are variously called) a sea-faring race who inhabit the numerous islands that fringe the Western Shore of Tenasserim (Lower Burma) from about lat. 13\u00b0 N. to about lat. 10\u00b0 N., and are marked on maps with the rather high-sounding title of the Mergui Archipelago.\n\nThese people may fairly enough be styled a distant branch of the Orang Laut. Their physical type, to judge from photographs, is more or less that of a rude Malayan race, with (possibly) some admixture of other elements, (of which the Indonesian may be one, as the Selungs, or at least some of them, are\n\n* These are given in Moura, \"Le Royaume du Cambodge.\"\n\u2020 Of the Balmar, however, a good dictionary by Dourisboure has been published (Hong Kong, 1889). It is a Mon-Annam dialect, but contains a certain number of Malayan words.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nmesaticephalic, while the true Malays tend to the brachycephalic type). The three wild tribes previously mentioned, I should have said, appear from descriptions and such illustrations as I have seen, to be at least in part of non-Malayan stock: some authorities have insisted much upon their Caucasian type, by which I suppose is meant that they differ considerably from the Mongoloid type of features common to both Indo-Chinese and Malays.\n\nThe Selungs, whatever their race may be, are pagans in a low state of civilization, and their language is an unwritten tongue. It comprises several dialects differing considerably from one another, so that people from two islands barely eighty miles apart have some difficulty in carrying on an intelligible conversation together. Several short vocabularies* of this language have been collected at various times by different persons, and they serve to illustrate these dialectic variations: but as it is not quite clear to which dialects they respectively refer, the Selung must for our purposes be dealt with as one language. It would appear to be really a Malayan language, less mixed with other elements than are the tongues already mentioned, and its claim to be mentioned here at all rests merely on its present geographical position: but being the speech of a sea-roving race of islanders it is obvious that its position does not furnish such cogent evidence for the antiquity of Malayan elements in Indo-China as do the inland dialects previously enumerated; nor is it as closely connected with any of them as they evidently are with one another.\n\nIt may however be said to form a link in the chain between these mainland dialects and languages of the Eastern Archipelago; and that is the reason why mention is made of it here, although its existence does not really affect the main argument of this paper.\n\nIt would be merely wearisome to present a whole series of vocabularies of the five languages I have enumerated: a few words will serve to convey some idea of the nature of the Malayan elements which they contain and will exhibit the\n\n---\n\n* They are given in Anderson, \"The Selungs of the Mergui Archipelago.\"\nR.

In fact, even if these words were all that we knew of the dialects in question, we should be justified in saying that they constituted a distinct subgroup of languages, not directly derived from any existing Malayan group. The forms for *one*, *two*, *four*, *five* and *six* run practically through the whole Malayo-Polynesian family almost unchanged. In *four* the mainland dialects approximate most closely, perhaps, to the Bugis *apak* and Madurese *empak*, unless indeed the -k, which appears to be unpronounced in these two languages, is to be regarded merely as a device of writing, not as the remnant of a real -k; Selung agrees with the Javanese and Dayak *pat*. In *six* they all agree with the Javanese *nem* in the absence of the first syllable of the word (Malay *anam*) but retain the a of the second syllable like the Malay (also the Madurese *nam*); the AChinese and Kayan Dayak form *nam* is identical.\n\nThe forms for *three* agree substantially amongst themselves and (except that some have a guttural for the initial t-) with the great majority of the Malayo-Polynesian family which retains the old form *tolu* or *telu*; but differ from Malay, which has another word, *tiga*. The nearest approximation to the Cham Cancho and Chr\u00e9ai forms appears to be the Bisaya (Philippines), *tl\u00f3*: compare also the Sulu *K\u00e1tlu\u00e1n* (= Ka-tlu-an), \u201cthirty.\u201d For the guttural, compare Sulu *iklog*, Selung *kloen*, with Tagalog *itl\u00f3g*, Malay *t\u00e9lor*, \u201cegg.\u201d The Rode contraction *to* recurs in Sulu.\n\nThe forms for *seven*, on the other hand, differ from the typical Malayo-Polynesian *pitu* and agree substantially with the Malay *tujo*, save only that Selung puts l- for t-.\n\nIn both these cases, it is very noticeable that the dialects now under consideration agree substantially with AChinese (*telhu* or *lhu* pronounced *telh\u00e9e* and *lh\u00e9e*, \u201cthree;\u201d and *tujuh*, \u201cseven\u201d) and with some of the Dayak dialects of Borneo, for which the reader may refer to No. 5 of this Journal, where out of a list of eleven dialects, ten have forms of *tolu* for *three*, and eight of those ten agree with some others not included in the ten in having forms of *tujo* for *seven*.\n\n---\n\n* Between Borneo and the Philippines.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nIn *eight* and *nine* there is some confusion, which may be due either to the collector or to the wild tribes themselves; possibly the latter get a little mixed when they come to the higher numbers. Anyhow, they are said to use for *eight* a form *salapan* which occurs again in Sundanese (Java) and also in Mangkasar (Macassar, of Celebes), in the latter under the form *salapang*, and there means, as it ought to mean, *nine*. Oddly enough, the Minangkabau Malays use it, interchangeably with *dulapan* (*delapan*), and also make it mean *eight*. Vice versa, these wild tribes use variants of the Malay and AChinese form of *eight* for *nine*. Cham, it is to be observed, uses both forms correctly, but has also another form for *nine*, viz., *Samilan*, the Malay *Sambilan* (*Sembilon*), which may perhaps be merely a loan word from Malay itself.\n\nThere has been, in historical times, a Malay immigration from Sumatra (and particularly, it seems, from Minangkabau) into Camboja (where this form *Samilan* is used) and the Cham and Malay communities in that country, though distinct, are in close contact with each other, and being of one religion sometimes intermarry.\n\nIt is noticeable that Selung differs from the other dialects in having preserved, though in rather uncouth shape, the original Malayo-Polynesian forms for *eight* (*walu*) and *nine* (*siwa*).\n\nIn the forms for *ten* these dialects agree substantially with the AChinese *p\u0113luh*, in shortening the first syllable; this does not, apparently, occur in the Bornean dialects, which in other respects show a fairly close resemblance in their numeral systems.\n\nFor *eleven* and upwards the dialects agree amongst themselves and with some of the Bornean dialects, but differ from Malay, AChinese, Javanese, etc., in not using forms compounded with *-balas* (originally *-walas*, the Malay *balas*, \u201cto repay,\u201d with the meaning \u201cto return,\u201d i.e. to the hand on which the counting was first began).\n\nThe Selung for \u201chundred\u201d apparently has the prefix *sa-* \u201cone\u201d reduced to *a*, which occurs also in a Cham subdialect as *ha-*.\n\nFor the *-l-* of Selung *yahloam*, Malay *jarum*, \u201cneedle.\u201d\n\nThus while there are here particular words agreeing, each with some different Malayan language or group of languages,\nthe sum total of the numeral system of these dialects is quite characteristic in its individuality.\n\nA similar state of things prevails in regard to many other common words, as the following specimens will suffice to show:\n\nCham. Cancho. Rod\u00e8. Chr\u00e9ai. Selung.\nDog: ath\u0101u. asou. so. so. oiee, aai.\nMelano-Dayak asau comes nearest but the word, though not found in Malay (except in the expression gigi asu, \"canine teeth\") is very widespread, e.g. Javanese asu.\n\nFowl: menuk. menuc. menuc.

The AChinese form is rimong like the Cham. I think there is no reason to doubt the identity of the word with the Malay rimau. Possibly the form harimau is a sort of Hobson-Jobson word, that is to say, really the old native Malayan word for \"tiger\" but twisted into its present form by a fanciful notion that it ought to mean \"the beast of Hari\" (harimriga, see Maxwell, Manual of Malay, p. 21). I confess that even Sir William's brilliant scholarship cannot convince me that his Tamil \"male lion\" derivation is the right one.\n\nElephant: liman. eman. romon. lomon.\n(Selung has gazah, the Malay gajah, a word of Sanskrit origin). Compare the Bulud Opie (Borneo), Javanese and Lampong (Sumatra) liman: this word, which is not found in Malay or AChinese, is probably derived from lima, the old word for \"hand,\" the application being to the end of the animal's trunk. One of the Sanskrit names for the elephant (hastin) has a similar derivation; and compare also his Latin epithet anguimanus, \"having a serpent for a hand.\"\nCham. Cancho. Rod\u00ea. Ch\u00e9rai.

This word is a good instance of the rule (first formulated by the late Dr. H. N. Van der Tuuk in his \u201cOutlines of a Grammar of the Malagasy Language,\u201d 1865) that \u201cwhen the Malay and Batak equivalent word has r and the Tagal or Bisaya has g, both the Kawi and Javanese have no consonant.\u201d * The Batak form here is boras Tagalog big\u00e1s, Bisaya bogas, Kawi wwas, which last contracts to Javanese wos, while Balinese has baus. It will be noticed that Cham and its neighbours here agree most closely with the Sumatran and South Celebes type and differ entirely from the Javan and Philippine. Selung rather stands alone, as in many other words. But Selung -l- corresponds in some other cases to Malay -r- e.g. mata-aloi (= matahari), \u201csun;\u201d yahloam (= jarium) \u201cneedle.\u201d\n\nRice (in husk) is in Cham palai: Malay padi, AChinese pal\u00e9, Javanese pari, Batak pag\u00e9, Bisaya palai.

Javanese and most of the Bornean dialects replace this d by r; the Philippine languages (and in this word Madurese also) have -l- here; Batak has -g-. The importance of this particular set of consonantal correspondences was also first pointed out by the late Dr. H. N. van der Tuuk. They constitute his second rule:\u2014\"When the Malay and Balinese d of equivalent words is represented by l in Bisaya or Tagal, both the Javanese and Kawi have r.\" Chnu is probably Cambojan.\n\nFire: apr\u0113i. apui. pui. puoi. appoi. apoi. apoe.\n\nMalay api, but AChinese and several Dayak dialects, etc., have apui.\n\nWater: ia, ea. ea. ja. aw\u0113n, awaen.\n\nMalay ay\u0113r, AChinese iy\u0113r, Madurese aeng, etc.\n\nStone: bat\u0101u. p\u0113tou. bato. potou. batoe.\n\nMalay batu, the AChinese equivalent is written in the same way but pronounced bat\u0113e.\n\nThe few words here given suffice to show that these dialects have peculiar points of relationship with several widely separated Malayan groups of languages and could not have been derived from any one of them. Their affinities appear to be most marked with AChinese, as is shown especially by the fact that in common with that language (and quite the opposite to Malay), they tend to throw the accent on the last syllable, which is consequently often strengthened to a diphthong, at the expense of the first, which is weakened and sometimes entirely suppressed: Compare pluh, \"ten\" with the AChinese p\u0113luh and contrast the Malay puloh: similarly compare the forms, in\n\nJour.

The Malayan element is strongest in the substantives, but is also represented in some of the verbs and adjectives, e.g.\n\n| Cham. | Cancho. | Rod\u00e9. | Chr\u00e9ai. |\n|-------|---------|-------|--------|\n| Buy:  | bl\u00ebi.   | bloi. | bloi.  |\n| Malay | b\u00ebli, AChinese, bloi. |\n\nSell: pabl\u00ebi (in Cham: the rest are different): AChinese publoi.\n\nGive: br\u00ebi. brey. broi. proi.\n\nMalay b\u00ebri, AChinese bri.\n\nDescend: trun. trunh. trun.

Suffice it to say that the Malayan element can be traced (at least in Cham and to some extent in Selung, there being no R. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nThe main object of this paper being merely to point out the existence of Malayo-Polynesian words in these languages and not to determine the difficult question of their right to be classified as genuine members of that family, I shall pass somewhat lightly over their grammatical characteristics of which indeed, except as regards Cham, little is as yet known. Cham forms its derivative words, like the Malayan, but unfortunately also like the Southern Mon-Annam languages, with prefixes and infixes: The common ones in Cham are the prefixes: \\(pa\\), \\(moe\\)-, \\(ta\\)- or \\(da\\)- and infixes: \\(-an\\)-, \\(-n\u00e6\\)- and \\(-am\\)- or \\(-ma\\)-. Most of these reappear, in more or less similar forms, with much the same force, in AChinese; but also in Cambojan, where they are very freely used, and to some extent in Peguan.* Suffixes, corresponding to the Malay \\(-kan\\) and \\(-an\\)\n\n| Prefixes. | AChinese. | Cham. | Khmer. | Mon. |\n|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|-----|\n| Verbs of action: causal or merely transitive | ... | p\u00eb-, pu- | pa- | p-, ph- | p-, ph-, b- |\n| Verbs, generally intransitive | ... | m\u00eb-, mu- | moe- | ? | m\u0101- |\n\n| Infixes. |\n|-----------|\n| Verbs of state, intransitive | ... | -\u00ebm- | -moe- | ? | -m- |\n| Substantives | ... | ... | -moe- | -m-, -amn- | -m- |\n| Substantives | ... | ... | -\u00ebn- | -an- | -n-, -an- | [-an-?] |\n\nIn some other cases, where the forms agree, the meanings appear to differ somewhat.\n\ndo not appear to be in use at the present time either in Cham, AChinese, Cambojan or Peguan; but if the derivation given above for liman (liman) from lima is right, they must have existed formerly to some extent in Cham.\n\nThe Selung dialect forms verbs by prefixing \\(me\\)- as in metoyam, \u201cto smell\u201d (Malay chinum), na- as in na-baut, \u201cto make\u201d (Malay buat), naleat, \u201cto look\u201d (Malay lihat), nadok, \u201cto sit\u201d (Malay dudok, AChinese duk, Cham dok); also, apparently, by nasalizing the initial consonant, as in nadone, \u201cto sleep\u201d (Malay tidor) and nakoat \u201cto fear\u201d (Malay takut). But\n\ndata for the other dialects) through most of the parts of speech, but the non-Malayan element is also, apparently, present in them.\n\n* A few instances of this general correspondence must suffice: there are of course many differences in detail.\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nthis last may possibly be due to the phonetic decay of a prefix of the form man- or men- (the Malay me-, meng-, etc.): for a word like mangai, \"to cry\" seems to presuppose an earlier manangai (Malay tangis, menangis) and mawah, \"to laugh\" an earlier manawah (Malay ter-tawa). The loss of a medial -n- seems more probable than that of a -t-: it may be, however, that the Selung in these words as in \"seven\" had replaced the t by l. In that case these forms probably exemplify the prefix me- above.\n\nSelung has the suffix -kan e.g. in the word makk\u0101n (for mabk\u0101n, am-bahkan or membahikan, from bah, to \"bring,\" Malay bawa).\n\nThe ideological order of these languages is unknown to me, except that in Cham (as in the Mon-Annam languages again) it appears to agree substantially with the Malay order: the attributive adjective and the genitive follow the principal noun, the object follows and the subject precedes the verb; but in Selung the object precedes the verb, which is very strange, unless it is due to the sentences having been collected through the medium of a Burmese interpreter, in speaking to whom the Selungs may have cast their words into the Burmese order. It is curious that Andamanese exhibits the same phenomenon: but there is no evidence that the Selungs are in any way connected with the Andaman islanders: both in physique and in language the two races are quite distinct from one another.\n\nI have already indicated the conclusion to which a necessarily rather superficial comparison of these dialects seems to me to point; I regard them, or at least all of them except Selung, as proof positive of the establishment on the mainland of Southern Indo-China of a Malayan sub-family which must date its separate existence from a period so remote as to be coeval with the differentiation and dispersal of the existing insular language groups of at least the Western part of the Malayan Archipelago, and which formed something like a link between the Sumatra, Bornean and Philippine groups.\n\nI think it is worth adding that the southern Mon-Annam languages, which so closely resemble the Malayan in certain of their structural forms, though by far the greater part of their vocabulary is radically different and non-Malayan, owe this\nresemblance, in my opinion, to the fact of their having developed on what I believe was originally a Malayan soil. The true explanation of the peculiarities which they share in common with the Malay-Polynesian family is, I believe, that they have been formed by the synthesis of a language introduced by alien immigrants from the north with the Malayan speech of a people who then already occupied Southern Indo-China. The northern invaders must have absorbed and assimilated these primitive Malay-Polynesians and imposed upon them their alien language, which in its turn has been twisted, in the mouths of their mixed descendants, into something of a Malay-Polynesian form, by a process that has been aptly called \"inverse attraction.\"\n\nThe result of such an introduction of a strange tongue is, as a rule, that it becomes modified or recast into some form that comes natural to the people upon whom it is imposed: this may be illustrated by such well known cases as the Pidgin English, of the China ports, Negro English, or the Malay of many Chinese, Tamils and Europeans.\n\nIn such cases the mere vocabulary, though foreign to the speaker, is learnt readily enough; but he cannot help speaking his new tongue in the manner of his old one. He pronounces the new words in the way that comes easiest to him and utters them in what is to him the natural order, though that may not be the order proper to the language as spoken by those whose original speech it was. If it was natural to him to use prefixes and infixes in his old language, I imagine he would be apt to apply them to his acquired tongue in the same way and for the same purposes. This, to my mind, is the explanation of the curious fact that in Cambodian and Peguan we find these modes of formation, which are so characteristic of the Malay-Polynesian family, while the difference of the material elements of language, i.e. the words themselves, prevents us from admitting an original kinship between the Mon-Annam and the Malayan families of speech.\n\nI am afraid that this idea of the formal elements of language surviving, while the native vocabulary is gradually being superseded by foreign words, may remind some people of the persistence of the grin after the disappearance of the Cheshire\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\ncat. But the real analogy is to be found in those petrifications where every cell and fibre of the original wood or other substance are in course of time accurately reproduced by the stony deposit that replaces them. To drop figures of speech, which, however apt, can never be conclusive, when one considers that the Malayan languages readily adopt foreign words and instinctively fit them up with Malayan prefixes and suffixes, one can almost see the beginnings of such a process as I have indicated: words like ka-raja-an, b\u0113r-akal or even di-r\u0113port-kun (which last can be heard any day when a Malay police officer reads from his Station report book in a Police Court) are instances taken at random, where a Sanskrit, Arabic or English loan word has been subjected to this treatment.\n\nOne has only to carry the idea out to its logical conclusion and imagine a Malayan language gradually allowing its native vocabulary to be superseded, more or less completely, by foreign loan words, and the result would be much the same as what we now find in southern Indo-China. If the process were arrested half-way, a fairly evenly mixed vocabulary would be formed, like that of Cham; a more advanced stage of change would result in something like Cambojan; while a thorough application of the same principle might end in producing a language like Peguan, where only a very small percentage of words is to be found which show any signs of kinship with the Malayan family. Nevertheless the ideological order of these languages, that is to say the order of words in a sentence, is substantially the same as in the Malayan languages* and the same system of prefixes and infixes (though not, apparently, of suffixes) still survives.\n\nOn the other hand a strong tendency is noticeable, of which it has been shown that even Achinese (Malayan language) exhibited the beginnings, to contract disyllabic words into monosyllables or at least into quasi-mono-syllables, in which one of the two syllables is almost suppressed. There are also other\n\n---\n\n* There is reason to believe that in this respect the Mon-Annam languages did not differ originally from the Malayan.\npeculiarities which distinguish the Mon-Annam from the Malay-\nan group, e.g., a preference for hard sounds * (surds) and the\noccurrence of true aspirated consonants: these latter char-\nacteristics may be due to the non-Malayan element in these\nlanguages.\n\nThe hypothesis here put forward would account for the\nremarkable resemblance in structure and formal elements\nbetween the Malayan and the Mon-Annam languages, a re-\nsemblance which, so far as I know, no one has yet satisfactorily\nexplained. \u2020 But of course it must remain a mere hypothesis\nuntil these languages have been thoroughly studied and\ncompared with one another.\n\nThis much, however, is certain: one Mon-Annam language\nwhich cannot be accused of having been developed on Malayan\nsoil, namely the Annamese, which grew up on the borders of\nKwang Si, within the Chinese sphere of influence, does not\nexhibit these phenomena, but follows the Chinese system of\ntones, though it has not adopted the Chinese ideological order.\nI take it that the differences between Peguan and Cambojan on\nthe one side and Annamese on the other are the measure of the\ndifference between a Chinese and a Malayan environment.\n\nWhether, however, this suggested explanation be the true\none or not, there remains the fact that in Peguan, and still\nmore in Cambojan, there are a fair number of words (too many\nto be due to accidental coincidence) which correspond in form\nwith Malayan words of similar meanings. As already stated,\nthey are generally more or less contracted or mutilated, by the\nweakening or entire loss of one syllable, while the Malayan\nlanguages retain them in their fuller disyllabic forms. That\nbeing the case, the presumption is that they are genuine Malay-\nan words; and this presumption is strengthened when any of\n\n* Clearly, however, it is at a relatively modern date that the\nMon-Annam languages have changed some of their sonants into surds:\nfor in many cases (especially in many of the Indian and some of the\nMalayan loan-words) they still appear as sonants in the written\nlanguage. Conversely Cambojan pronounces some surds as sonants.\n\n\u2020 Mr. Himly in his paper referred to below, throws out a hint\nthat some such explanation is possible, but does not enlarge upon\nit.\n\nJour.

It would however be a great mistake to suppose that the bulk of the vocabulary of Peguan or Cambojan can be accounted for in this way: the contrary is the fact, and at first sight any Malay student looking through a dictionary of either of these tongues would be struck with their non-Malayan aspect.

But my present object being to make out merely such a prima facie case as will justify further investigation in this direction, I have thought it superfluous to bring in the corroborative evidence that can be supplied from the other languages.

Straits Branch,\na considerable number of names of plants, animals and the like, which run (more or less) through the whole range of Malayo-Polynesian languages from Madagascar to Hawaii and from Formosa to New Zealand, has shown that the speakers (whoever they were) of the mother tongue from which these innumerable languages were evolved, were a seafaring people, of some moderate degree of civilization, (they were acquainted with the use of iron), who at the stage preceding the differentiation of these languages (but not necessarily originally) inhabited a long coastline of some good-sized country situated within the tropics, somewhere in the western half of the vast region over which these languages now extend. He points to the South-Eastern coast of Indo-China as the country that fits in best with this conclusion; and without going into details, lays some stress on the considerable Malayan element that is to be found in the existing languages of that region, which fact, as he observes, in view of the relative unimportance of the small Malayan communities to be found there in modern times, can only be explained by the hypothesis that they formerly constituted a much more numerous and powerful factor there than they do in our own day.\n\nThis last point it has been my endeavour to illustrate in the present paper.\n\nIt may be convenient if I summarize the conclusions to which the considerations here brought together appear to me to lead:\n\n(1) The Malayan element in Cham and its cognate dialects was not borrowed from any other Malayan language or group of languages. It has been separated from the western insular groups for as many centuries, as they have been from one another, and has become differentiated from them as they have amongst themselves.\n\n(2) The Southern Mon-Annam languages and Cham are at once Malayan and non-Malayan: largely Malayan in structural formation, mixed but predominantly non-Malayan in vocabulary, they are probably the result of an intimate mixture between\n\nbanana, rice (in husk and husked), shark, prawn, sea-turtle, buffalo and crocodile: but there are a good many more besides.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nMalayan and alien tongues. The Malayan element is strongest in the southeast, weakening progressively towards the north and west.\n\n(3) At a remote age, before the introduction of the alien element just referred to, probably the whole coast of southern Indo-China from the Irrawady to the borders of Tongking, and certainly the eastern part of it from Cape St. James to the neighbourhood of Hu\u00e9, was more or less occupied by communities speaking a pure Malayan language, possibly already slightly differentiated into dialects.\n\n(4) It was probably from this region at a time when it was still purely Malayan, that the various emigrations took place, which ultimately carried dialects of that language to the distant islands in which they are now spoken.\n\nI am content to rest this last proposition on the grounds put forward by Professor Kern in the essay already referred to; the other three appear to me to follow, though not all with the same degree of certainty, from the linguistic evidence of which some specimens have here been brought together.\n\nSince writing the above, I have seen in the T'oung Pao for March, 1901 (Series II, Vol. 2, No.1, p.86) a review by M. Gustave Schlegel of a recent Siamese grammar. In noticing this work (which appears to be the best Siamese grammar hitherto published) after pointing out, what has been pointed out before, notably by the late M. Terrien de la Couperie, that Siamese contains a very large percentage* of words common to it and Chinese (especially, the numerals\u2020 which are, up to a certain point, pure Chinese loan words) and also a considerable number of Sanskrit and other Indian words, the eminent Chinese Professor of Leyden hazards the view that the residuum of Siamese will be found to be a Malayan language, and supports this thesis by a few words which no doubt are Malayan but may very well be loan words like the Indian ones; everything that the venerable professor writes is worthy of consideration, but\n\n* De la Couperie puts it as high as 33\u00bd per cent: \"Languages of China before the Chinese\" pp. 59-60.\n\u2020 Not however, \"one\" and \"two.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nwith all deference, I venture to say that this is indeed a bold theory. His chief argument, apparently, apart from the afore-said Malay loan wards, is that Fu-nan (or Pu-nam), the old name for the country now called Siam, is capable of being explained by a Siamese derivation which M. Schlegel invents for it: unfortunately all monosyllabic languages lend themselves only too easily to hypothetical derivations of that kind; and that its people, in the early centuries of the Christian era, are described by Chinese chroniclers as being \"ugly and black\" with \"curled hair,\" resembling, the Professor himself says, the Semangs. On the strength of this he assumes the Siamese to be Malayan. Everyone who has been to the Far East should know, and M. Schlegel can hardly have forgotten, that the Siamese are several shades fairer and the Semangs several shades darker than the average Malay complexion: and that neither Siamese nor Malays have curled or curly hair. His argument compels M. Schlegel to deny the historically certain fact that the Thai, that is the present Siamese, are comparatively recent arrivals from the interior of Northern Indo-China; and he entirely overlooks the essential unity of their language with that of the Laos, Shans, etc., right away to the Khamti on the eastern border of Assam and a string of tribes in southwestern China. If the Siamese spoken to-day at Bangkok is at bottom a Malayan language, so must be the languages of all these northern tribes, for they are substantially the same and cannot be severed from one another. That appears to me to be an exceedingly large conclusion to draw from a few Malay loan words to be found in modern Siamese, and I am convinced that it will be repudiated both by Siamese and Malay Scholars with tolerable unanimity.\n\nOf course the possibility that there is a Malayan element in the blood of the modern Siamese of the South is not thereby excluded: that there should be such an element is an almost necessary consequence if the main argument of the foregoing paper has anything in it. But apart from modern intermixture which the difference of religions keeps at a minimum, it can only have come in at second hand through the Peguan or Cambojan inhabitants who occupied Siam before the Thai conquered it. That, however, is a very different matter from the\nhazardous assertion that Siamese is a Malayan language, an assertion which requires far more cogent evidence to justify it than M. Schlegel has supplied in the article to which I refer.\n\nIt is hardly necessary for me to add that this paper is merely intended to draw the attention of the readers of this Journal to the subject; so far as the greater part of it is concerned, no claim is made for originality, and it is in the main merely a restatement of what has been set forth elsewhere in fuller form by others. My excuse for offering it to the Society is that some of the readers of this Journal may not have had access to the existing literature on the subject. At the risk of appearing egotistical, I desire to put on record that at the time my former paper was published, I had not heard of Professor Kuhn\u2019s admirable essay entitled \u201cBeitr\u00e4ge Zur Sprachen Kunde Hinterindiens.\u201d In it most of my conclusions were anticipated, and, if I had known of its existence, my paper would not have appeared, without at least some reference to it.

D. Machado.\n\nAt the headwaters of the Sembrong, the Bekok and the Simpang Kiri in the interior of Johore, three large streams which, draining one into the other, form lower down the Batu Pahat River, are to be found scattered families of Jakuns. These people live by agriculture, are employed by the Chinese pepper and gambier cultivators in clearing jungle for them, and furnish the Malays through barter, their stock of jungle produce. Years of contact with the Chinaman have robbed them of much of their primitiveness. So great is their assimilation to the Chinaman, that when cadging a bowlful of rice from him, they have been often seen manipulating a pair of chopsticks with a dexterity unequalled by the Chinaman himself. They now profess an abhorrence for monkeys, snakes, lizards and similar delicacies, and it is sometimes amusing to behold their studied look of consternation at any one suggesting the possibility of anything so loathsome forming part of their daily menu. Yet the Malays declare that in the privacy of their own homes, they will devour anything, from a snail to an elephant. They do not regard with disfavour the giving of their daughters in marriage to Chinese planters, such unions usually assuring to them and their relations some measure of certainty of a regular supply of food. They are thus a somewhat mixed people to-day. In general appearance they are not unlike up-country Malays. There is still however that peculiar lustre in their eyes, an appearance of independence and yet of timidity, an indefinable something in fact, which to a practiced observer, at once proclaims them their primitive origin and their probable connexion with the other wild tribes further north in the peninsula. They\ndo not call themselves Jakuns, that word being a term of opprobrium if applied to them within their hearing. Curiously enough, the Sakais also resent the application of the word Sakai to them, and like the Sakais again, they call themselves Orang Ulu, up-country people. The Malays in their dealings with the Jakuns, call them Pa angkat (adopted father) Ma angkat (adopted mother) adik angkat (adopted younger brother) and so on as the case may be. This pleases them hugely, though not to the extent of inducing them to part with their stock any cheaper or in greater quantity. For all that, they are very much harrassed and robbed by the Malays, in particular by those who have some authority over them. In my journeys into the interior of Batu Pahat, I have often had patiently to listen to the complaints of these men against their Malay oppressors, many of undoubted genuineness, without however having the power to render any relief.\n\nIt may not perhaps be generally known that the Jakuns practice the rite of circumcision, but in a way peculiar to themselves. They do not, like the Mohammedans, remove the whole skin, but merely part the upper folds of the prepuce by a longitudinal cut or incision, causing the rest to drop into a bunch below. Asked as to the reason for this peculiar rite, the oldest man present related to me the following legend. Very many years ago, when the whole country belonged to them and they were under the rule of a great Batin (King of their own, as great as the Sultan of Johore,) this great Batin had a wife who for a long time remained childless. At length, a male child was born to them, who after thriving for some time sickened and was on the point of death. On consulting a Pawang (Diviner or Sorcerer) who happened in this case to have been a Mohammedan Malay, he declared that the only means of saving the youth\u2019s life was by circumcision. To this the great Batin demurred but vowed that if his child recovered, he would be circumcised. He got well and the operation was in due time performed but in order that he might not thereby be held to have embraced the Mohammedan faith, this peculiar style was adopted, the fiat having in the meantime gone forth that all male Jakun children were in future to undergo this operation in the manner indicated above, which explains the existence of this peculiar\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\ncustom to-day. This custom is utterly unknown to the northern Sakais who appear to dread the operation, so much so that many Pahang Sakais have told me that but for this one operation, they would have embraced the Mohammedan faith. Another reason why a Sakai will not become a Mohammedan is that he will be obliged to eschew such delicacies as he from time to time picks up in the jungle, in particular the bamboo rat (*Rhizomeys*) which is to him the most toothsome and delicate of foods!\n\nThese Batu Pahat Jakuns told me that in days of old, they possessed a very extensive vocabulary of their own. All that now remains of this once extensive vocabulary are a few words, which they still use interspersed with Malay and which are transcribed below. Even these few remaining words, the rising generation of Jakuns do not appear inclined to use, so that in a short time, their once extensive language will be a thing of the past. I should add that a great number of these words have appeared in one of the earlier issues of the Journal collected by Lieut. Kelsall, R. E., from the Endau Jakuns, while a few seem peculiar to the Batu Pahat people.\n\n**List of Jakun Words at present in use among the Jakuns of Batu Pahat.**\n\nNow, klak.\nDay after to morrow, du\u00e2k'.\nMorning, lom.

HANITSCH, PH. D.,\n\nCURATOR OF THE RAFFLES MUSEUM, SINGAPORE.\n\nAlthough I have already given some account of the breeding of the huge Phasmid insect, since identified as *Eurycnema herculanea*, Charpentier, in the Annual Reports of the Raffles Library and Museum for 1897 and 1898, it seems desirable to put it on record in a more connected form.\n\nAbout January 1897 Mr. L. A. Fernandis, Taxidermist in the Raffles Museum, received a living female of this species, but as it had passed through several hands, its place of origin could not be traced. Possibly it may have come from Java. He kept it alive, feeding it on guava leaves (*Pisidium guyava*, L.), and in February it began to lay eggs. He kindly presented me with a number of those eggs, most of which hatched during April and May of that year, but one not till August, and the last one in the middle of September. As soon as the young ones were hatched, they applied themselves very vigorously to the consumption of guava leaves, and grew so quickly that the first one out was fully developed on August 11th, casting its last skin on that date, i.e., more than a month before its last sister egg was hatched. During growth they cast off their skin several times without any great effort, only rarely losing a leg in the process, until the last cast, when many of them lost several legs, one even as many as five. Naturally these were then helpless in feeding themselves, not being able to cling on to the guava leaves, and they soon died. But the individuals which were successful afforded an interesting sight when the last skin was cast. Up to this they had been stick-like in appearance (Malay name \"Bilalang Ranting,\" Stick Insect), without wings, of dark brown colour in the earlier stages.\nand turning into grey in the later stages. Now they suddenly appeared in a glistening new green skin, with long wings, and the body seemingly almost double its former diameter. All specimens were female, and a few weeks after they had reached the adult stage, they began to swell up and lay eggs, the first of them being laid on September 16th. None of the females had ever come into contact with a male insect, having been carefully kept in a large airy case consisting of glass and perforated zinc, exhibited in the entrance hall of the Raffles Museum. Eggs were continually being laid by the sister insects up to February 1898, the insects dying about two or three weeks after they had deposited the eggs. Of the eggs laid during the last four months of 1897 and the first two months of 1898, a careful account was kept. Every morning I inspected the case, removed the eggs which had been laid during the past twenty-four hours, and placed the eggs laid on different days in separate boxes, duly dated. The first young ones of this generation appeared in March and the last in August, requiring for their development from 165 to more than 240 days of which great divergence in time I cannot give any explanation. Most of them, however, were hatched between the 195th and 212th days, the maximum number being hatched on the 205th day. The accompanying table shows the proportions of eggs hatched on different days. This generation was rather weakly, only a few reached maturity, most of them dying off when shedding their skin two or three stages before maturity. The first of them reached the adult stage on August 10th, 1898, and never having come into contact with any male, began to lay eggs on September 15th. These eggs did not develop, and none of the other individuals of this generation laid any eggs.\n\nThe reason why the eggs of the last generation did not develop was very probably in consequence of their artificial surroundings. If I had been able to keep the insects in more natural conditions and to devote more care to their feeding, I feel sure I would have been able to rear a few more parthenogenetic generations.\n\nThis appears to be the first instance of Parthenogenesis observed amongst Orthoptera, and there are now only three\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\norders of insects left in which this mode of propagation has not yet been described, viz., Coleoptera, Strepsiptera, and Aptera. In Hymenoptera Parthenogenesis occurs amongst the Tenthredinidae or Saw Flies, Cynipidae or Gall Flies, Chalcididae, and certain Bees and Wasps. Amongst Lepidoptera there is perhaps only the one well-established case of Solenobia, and amongst Diptera that of Chironomus, amongst Thysanoptera the case of Thrips, and amongst Neuroptera a doubtful case of one of the Caddis Flies, Apatania. More common again are well-established cases of Parthenogenesis amongst Hemiptera, viz., in the Aphidae or Plant-Lice, and Coccidae or Scale Insects.\n\nDescription of the adult female: The total length of the largest specimen, preserved dry, is 230 mm. (about 9 inches), but all the measurements given below are taken from a very perfect specimen preserved in spirit, measuring 204 mm. (about 8 inches), the total length in both cases being exclusive of the antennae, but inclusive of the ovipositor.\n\nThe head is oval and smooth, 13 mm. long, with three very distinct ocelli, the antennae being 27 mm. in length and consisting of 26 joints. The prothorax is corrugated, without spines, and only 11 mm. in length. The mesothorax is 39 mm. long and spined. On its dorsal surface there are about sixteen spines arranged in two irregular rows of eight each, laterally about eight spines on either side, and ventrally two irregular rows of about six spines each. The metathorax, 16 mm. long, is smooth dorsally, but provided with a few blunt spines laterally and ventrally.\n\nAll the abdominal segments are smooth. The first segment measures 12 mm., the second, third, fourth and fifth 14 mm. each, the sixth 15 mm., the seventh 13 mm., the eighth 10 mm., the ninth and tenth 7 mm. each. The ovipositor is large and boat shaped, measuring 39 mm. and projecting beyond the last segment by 19 mm. The styles are 12 mm. long: they are narrow flat plates with a dorsal vertical ridge, appearing therefore L-shaped in transverse section.\n\nThe first pair of legs measures 112 mm., the second 90 mm., the third 122 mm. The femora of all legs bear spines arranged in three rows, but the tibiae of the first pair of legs are almost smooth, whilst those of the second pair are more\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nspiny and those of the last pair still more so. The animal has the power of reproducing legs lost during the process of casting of the skin, especially in the earlier stages, but in my specimens the new legs never grew up to the size of the normal legs of the opposite side.\n\nThe wing covers measure 39 mm., the wings themselves 77 mm., reaching down to the end of the fifth segment.\n\nThe eggs are oval and smooth, of dark brown colour, measuring 5 by 4 mm., surmounted by an almost spherical capitulum, 1.5 mm. in diameter. These eggs were figured by Dr. D. Sharp, F. R. S., of Cambridge, in his \"Account of the Phasmid\u00e6, with Notes on the Eggs,\" in Willey's \"Zoological Results,\" part IX, fig. 39, under the name of *Cyphocrania hanitschi*, n.n., and the author says that they are remarkable for the large size of the capitulum. Later on, however, he identified the species as *Eurycema herculanea*, Charpentier.\nTable: Genetic eggs of\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|238|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|237|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|236|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|235|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|234|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|233|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|232|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|231|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|230|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|229|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|228|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|227|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|226|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|225|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|224|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|223|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|222|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|221|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|220|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|219|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|218|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|217|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|216|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|215|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|214|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|213|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|212|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|211|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|210|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|209|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|208|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|207|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|206|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|205|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|204|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|203|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|202|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|201|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|200|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|199|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|198|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|197|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|196|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|195|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|194|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|193|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|192|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|191|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|190|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|189|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|188|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|187|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|186|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|185|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|184|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|183|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|182|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|181|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|180|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|179|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|178|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|177|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|176|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|175|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|174|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|173|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|172|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|171|0  |0  |0  |0  |\n|170|0  |0  |0  |0  |\nTable shewing the time required\u2014in days\u2014for the hatching of the parthenogenetic eggs of EURYCNEMA HERCULANEA, Charpentier.\n\nThe circles indicate the number of eggs hatched on the respective days.\n\n| Day | Circles |\n|-----|---------|\n| 288 |         |\n| 237 |         |\n| 236 |         |\n| 235 |         |\n| 234 |         |\n| 233 |         |\n| 232 |         |\n| 231 |         |\n| 230 |         |\n| 229 |         |\n| 228 |         |\n| 227 |         |\n| 226 |         |\n| 225 |         |\n| 224 |         |\n| 223 |         |\n| 222 |         |\n| 221 |         |\n| 220 |         |\n| 219 |         |\n| 218 |         |\n| 217 |         |\n| 216 |         |\n| 215 |         |\n| 214 |         |\n| 213 |         |\n| 212 |         |\n| 211 |         |\n| 210 |         |\n| 209 |         |\n| 208 |         |\n| 207 |         |\n| 206 |         |\n| 205 |         |\n| 204 |         |\n| 203 |         |\n| 202 |         |\n| 201 |         |\n| 200 |         |\n| 199 |         |\n| 198 |         |\n| 197 |         |\n| 196 |         |\n| 195 |         |\n| 194 |         |\n| 193 |         |\n| 192 |         |\n| 191 |         |\n| 190 |         |\n| 189 |         |\n| 188 |         |\n| 187 |         |\n| 186 |         |\n| 185 |         |\n| 184 |         |\n| 183 |         |\n| 182 |         |\n| 181 |         |\n| 180 |         |\n| 179 |         |\n| 178 |         |\n| 177 |         |\n| 176 |         |\n| 175 |         |\n| 174 |         |\n| 173 |         |\n| 172 |         |\n| 171 |         |\n| 170 |         |\nMalay Plant Names.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley and C. Curtis.\n\nIn Journal No. 30 a list was published of Malay names of plants with their equivalents in Latin and English. It has been considered by various persons that it would be useful to have the names in Latin-Malay, and Mr. Curtis has compiled this from the original work. This also gives an opportunity of adding names since obtained, and of making various corrections in identification and spelling. Dr. Clercq, who is much interested in this study of native plant names, has criticised the original list, and added a number of names and suggestions, which are incorporated herewith. One or two words have been added from Clifford and Swettenham's Dictionary, but many of the plant names therein are unidentified with the plants, and so useless for this purpose, and some are not Malay Peninsula words, to which this list has been confined.\n\nScientific Names.

Skeat.\n\nIn Kelantan and Patani the material of which sarongs, kain lepas, etc., are made is now almost invariably silk or cotton thread imported from Singapore, but in out-of-the-way inland districts a few Malays of the older generation still manufacture a coarse but durable thread of native vegetable fibre (homespun). In the latter case the dyes most commonly used were blue (biru) and purple (umu) with occasionally some green (ijau or empoo) and a little yellow (kuning or tula). Red, though much admired, was not commonly used owing to the difficulty of making it fast. When silk is to be dyed, from four or ten kati's weight is now usually bought from peddlers or in the bazaar at from $4 to $4.50 per kati (1\u00bdlbs). The following are the processes by which the required colours are obtained, both silk and cotton thread being similarly treated. I may add that the numbers correspond to a series of standard colours which were shown to my informants when the information was obtained, but which it is unfortunately impossible to reproduce here.\n\nRed:\u2014(1) To dye a kati of silk red from ten to fifteen fruits of the asam gelugor,* with two or three common tamarinds, and as much alum as will cover the nail of the fourth finger, are together put into a pan (blanga), and heated up to boiling-point (s\u0101p\u0101 b\u0113rg\u0113l\u0113g\u0101k).\u2020 The silk is plunged into the liquid, which is kept on the fire till the whole has been well boiled, when the pan is taken off and allowed to stand all night. Next morning the silk is kneaded to clean it (di-kich\u0101h, Selangor kinchah) taken out, and dried in the sun, and put out in the dew\n\n* Garcinia atroviridis,\u2014H. N. R.\n\n\u2020 I have given exact Kelantan and Patani pronunciations in this article as likely to be of most interest to the reader,\u2014W. S.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nfor the night. This method of dyeing silk red is called by Patani and Kelantan Malays \"ch\u0113lu mala\" (or, in standard Malay, \"ch\u0113lup malau.\")\n\nOrange:\u2014(2) To dye silk orange [which is called kuning pin\u0113 mas\u0101k, or \"ripe betel-nut yellow\"], the silk may be dipped into the already used red dye. Only a weak solution is required, so that if the strength of the dye (pati) has been absorbed by the first instalment of silk it does not really matter. Of course if a new solution is brewed, care must be taken to see that it is not too strong, but the former method is generally favoured. The silk is dipped into the liquid and stirred about, and then boiled a little, till it is as red as the pulut-pulut flower,* my informant declared. On being taken out again, the dye is wrung out of it, when it is laid aside for the time being. About a \"chup\u0101k\" of the fruits of the kas\u014dm\u0101 klin (kasumba kling) are then squeezed (ramah) into a dish (pasu), the husks being thrown away. To these are added about ten of the fruits of belimbing masam, which is also called \"Bu\u0101h k\u2019rih\" in Kelantan and Patani from its being used for the express purpose of cleaning K\u2019ris blades (di-bach\u0113 k\u2019rih). These being squeezed into the pasu, a pinch or two of alum is added, (as a mordant), and the mixture is ready. The silk is dipped into this liquid and kneaded in it for a few moments (sa-j\u0113nih), after which it is boiled for a short while on the fire. When taken out, it is hung up upon a line in a shady place to dry (di-sid\u0101 di-t\u0113doh).\u2020 Shade is of importance, as if it is exposed to the sun the colour will fade. It is however exposed to the dew (di-p\u0113r\u0113mbong) every night for three nights consecutively.\n\nDark orange is obtained from chips of the heart of the jackfruit (nangka) tree, with the usual mordant (alum and asam gelugor).\n\nYellow:\u2014(3) and all the colours now to be mentioned are now usually obtained from aniline dye-stuffs imported from Singapore. In the absence of such dyes however they are still obtained as follows.\n\n* Urena lobata whose flower is pink.\u2014H. N. R.\n\u2020 In Selangor Malay = Sindal.\nTo dye silk yellow, turmeric or curcuma is pounded in a small specially-made mortar and wrung or squeezed by hand (di-p'rah) to get the juice out of it. Tamarinds, asam g\u0113lugor, and alum are added in the same proportion as before, and the silk boiled in the mixture and hung up to dry, as in the \"malau\" process. This dye however like all other shades of yellow must be exposed to the action of the sun, as without this the required tint cannot be obtained.\n\nFor yellow green (4) the treatment commences with the same process as for yellow, but a mixture is added which is made from the root and heart of the \"poko' k\u0113dra\u0113.\" About a kati (1\u00bd lbs) of this wood is taken, chopped up small (di-chich\u0113) and heated to boiling point. It is then allowed to stand and cool a little, when the clearer liquor at the top (siring) is spooned off (leaving the thicker stuff, called dodo' at the bottom), and added to the decoction of turmeric before referred to. The rest of the process is the same as before. The same colour is also given by young shoots of the Rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum) tree, alum and asam g\u0113lugor being added.\n\nFor Green (5) a larger proportion of the \"kedrang\" mixture is applied. For Blue Green (6) the process is twice repeated. For Blue (7) a decoction of indigo leaves takes the place of the turmeric. The process is otherwise the same but repeated two or three times till the right tint is obtained.\n\nThe following are the more important kinds of indigo known in Kelantan and Patani.\n\n1. tarung k\u0113ch\u012b' (= tarum kechil)\n2. tarung g\u0113l\u0113ng\u0113 (= t. gelanggang)\n3. tarung Si\u0113 (= t. Siam)\n4. tarung \u0101k\u0101 or tarung utae,* (= t. akar or t. eitan).\n\nFor Indigo (8) the leaves are gathered and thrown into a big earthenware jar called \"t\u0113pay\u0113\" (St. Mal. t\u0113mpayan) together with the bark of the young shoots or young fruit-spikes of the coconut-palm (k\u016bli'p\u016bti'ny\u0101), one fruit-spike on an average going to each tepay\u0113. A lump of lime \"as thick as a man's arm\" (b\u0113s\u0101 leng\u0113) is added, and the silk steeped in the decoction till it becomes of the requisite tint.\n\n* Marsdenia tinctoria (?)\u2014H. N. R.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nFor Violet (9) commence with the light red dye (m\u0101l\u0101), as before, but then steep the silk in fermented cocoanut milk (ayi ny\u0101 \u2019d\u0101h jadi ragi) keeping the silk in it only just long enough to turn it of the requisite tinge, as if not watched, and allowed to remain too long, it will turn a rusty black.\n\nPurple (10) may be obtained either from an infusion of tengar bark or by combination of the \u201cmala\u201d (light red) dyeing process with indigo; Dark purple from the ser\u0101 kayu (Sel. kenundang), a tree with small red edible fruits, with alum and asam g\u0113lugor as usual. White (11) is obtained by steeping the silk in a decoction of (burnt) durian skin. Light black or Black (12) is obtained from an infusion of tengar bark or by repeated steepings in indigo; or by burying in the soil of the gurah tree,* yarn already dyed yellow-green (4) or dark purple (10). Dark black (13) by still further repeated dyeing with indigo or fermented coconut milk; Grey (14, 15) by dipping in indigo; Brown (16, 17) by dyeing with \u201cmundu\u201d\u2020 bark, alum and tamarinds being added as required; Brown (18) by dyeing with \u201cmundu\u201d bark only; and Brown (19) by adding indigo to the above.\n\nI may add that the most generally favourite colour is red after which come yellow and a kind of delicate rose-colour (or madder), which is called k\u0113mbang p\u0113tang in Selangor (k\u0113m\u0113 p\u0113t\u0101e in Kelantan and Patani). Darker and soberer tints are in vogue for the older folks, and the sarong-patterns worn by the women have smaller checks and are more tasteful than those worn by the men.\n\nIn Raman (an inland province of Patani), both Blue and Black dyes are obtained from either the wild or cultivated variety of indigo (tarung ut\u0101e or tarung k\u0101pon) the yarn being steeped in an infusion coloured by the young shoots until the requisite tint is obtained. The black is therefore merely the deepest shade of blue obtainable. Red is obtained from Brazilwood or sepang mixed with an equal proportion of chips of the\n\n* The yarn after dyeing is buried in soil taken from underneath the gurah tree, whose leaves are said to turn the soil underneath it black. The \u201cgurah\u201d tree is probably \u201cExcoecaria agallocha,\u201d (H. N. R.) in which case it is the same as the guring (?).\n\n\u2020 Garcinia dulcis.\u2014H. N. R.\n\"Dyeing.\"\n\n\"kedr\u00e6ng\" tree. The heart of the tree (terah) is taken and steeped in water until the infusion becomes of a sufficiently deep red colour. Green is obtained by taking the old leaves of the Indigo and mixing them with the juice of young cocoanut-fruit pounded small (ayer mumbang* di-tumboh).\n\nYellow\u2020 is obtained from equal proportions of turmeric (kunyit) and lime (kapor) which are mixed and allowed to ferment (di-rapai jadi ragi).\n\nPurple is made by dipping red-dyed yarn in indigo.\n\nBefore concluding I may perhaps here add for the sake of comparison a few general notes on typical dyeing processes on the west coast (Selangor).\n\nIn Selangor mangrove bark (kulit bakau) is used as a black dye, whilst from isi temu kunyit or temu kunchi and temu pauh (especially from the first of these three) yellow dye is obtained. The yellow dye obtained from these latter preparations is darkened by the addition of lime (kapor) and asam gelugor.\n\nRed dye is obtained from Sepang and kesumba k'ling; green from bunga telang (the creeper, not the bamboo); black from the fruit of the kedudok (Melastoma) and from the fruit of the tumu, the latter giving the best results.\n\n* In Raman called gam\u00e6 (=gumbang).\n\u2020 Probably the exact colour obtained would depend upon the length of the immersion. It might be expected that such a mixture as described would produce, when its full strength was brought out, a sort of burnt ochre.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nMalay Tiger-beetles.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nThe tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) are among the most attractive and conspicuous of our smaller beetles on account both of their bright colours, and their rapid movements in the full sun, in the hottest time of the day. They are exclusively carnivorous, chasing their prey consisting of smaller insects and usually flying very briskly, and usually require the use of the net to capture them. The Malay species may be divided into two groups, the jungle-tiger beetles and the road-tiger beetles. The former include species of the genera Tricondyla and Collyris.\n\nTricondyla aptera, Oliv., is the only species of this genus I have seen in the peninsula, and it is by no means common. I obtained a single specimen in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore, and there is also a specimen from Penang in the British Museum. It seems to be abundant in New Guinea and occurs also in Amboina, Aru Islands and Solomon Islands. It is our largest species, about $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long, and is also remarkable for being quite wingless, a narrow, elongate, deep blue beetle with slender antennae, prominent eyes, and long red legs. I found it running about on the ground with the workers of the common large ant known as Semut Rajah, (Camponotus gigas). This ant makes nests in the bases of hollow trees, and the workers are commonly to be seen scampering about on paths, especially in the early morning and late evening, in search of food. The Tricondyla appears to mimick the ant, for though when the two insects are compared the resemblance is less striking, the general form, long legs, and method of running about cause the beetle to so much resemble the ant that I very nearly let it escape mistaking it for the ant.\n\nOf the genus Collyris we have three species here and probably more will be found, as the species very closely resemble one another. They are much smaller than the Tricondyla but of very much the same shape, though they have\nwings, slender long-legged beetles, blue or violet, which are often to be seen flying and scampering over leaves on bushes in the bright sunny spots of the jungle. The commonest species is *C. dolens*, Chand., which I have collected in Singapore, Selangor, Penang and elsewhere. *C. filiformis*, Chand., is a more slender species, bright violet blue with red legs. *C. apicalis*, Chand., is rather larger, very dark in colour, almost black, with red legs and a reddish patch at the apex of the elytra. It is common in the Botanic Gardens.\n\n*Therates humeralis* has broader elytra and more resembles a road tiger-beetle. It is blue with tawny shoulders and red legs. I have collected it in Singapore.\n\nOf the road tiger-beetles with broad elytra, which dart about on sandy roads, taking short flights, then running a little on their long legs and off again, we have two genera, *Cicindela* and *Heptadonta*. The first genus seems to be very widely distributed, abundant in Europe and North America as well as in the tropics. The larvae of the temperate climate species are soft bodied with large heads and powerful jaws. They live in holes in the ground from the entrance of which they look out for passing insects on which to prey. The larvae of our species doubtless resemble those of colder climates, but they have not yet been investigated.\n\nThe commonest species is *Cicindela aurulenta*, Fabr., which is very abundant on sandy roads in Singapore, Perak, Penang, Province Wellesley and elsewhere. It is abundant on the west Hill in Penang at an altitude of 3000 feet. The upper surface is of a dark blue green with six golden spots on the elytra. The abdomen beneath is coppery red. It has very powerful black curved jaws, but cannot bite though the skin. Altogether it is a very beautiful beetle.\n\n*C. fuliginosa*, Dej., is smaller and rather less common, though by no means rare. The elytra have a dark brown key pattern on a cream ground. I have met with it in Singapore, Penang, Province Wellesley and Perak, and it will probably be found all over the peninsula as well.\n\n*Heptadonta analis*, Fabr., has the same form and habits as the two Cicindelas, but is a plain dark blue-green beetle without any spots. It is widely distributed, occurring in Penang,\nSelangor and Perak and is also found in Bombay, Java and Sumatra.\n\nI identified these beetles by the collections in the Natural History Museum. There are probably other species to be found in the peninsula, especially in our hill regions, and as they are conspicuous and easy to catch there ought to be no difficulty in getting a complete set of the species of the peninsula.\nA List of the Reptiles of Borneo\u2014Addenda et Corrigenda.*\n\nP. 47.\u2014Brookeia baileyi, Bartlett.\n\nThis species must now be known as Orlitia borneensis, Gray. *O. borneensis* was most incompletely described in 1873, from a very young mounted specimen, collected by Bleeker at Sintang, Dutch Borneo. Boulenger subsequently relegated the species to the genus *Bellia*, since the very immature specimens showed no characters on which to base a sound generic diagnosis. Adult specimens of this same species were later (1895 and 1897) described by Bartlett and Boulenger as *Brookeia baileyi* and *Liemys inornata* respectively. A skull of this tortoise in the Zoological Institute, Munich, was described by Baur in 1895 as *Adelochelys crassa* and referred to the super-family *Chelydroidea*, chiefly characteristic of the New World, and its habitat guessed at as Costa Rica! Finally Schenkel in 1901 suggested that *Brookeia baileyi* and *Bellia borneensis* were conspecific, and pointing out the differences between this species and a typical *Bellia*, revived Gray\u2019s Genus *Orlitia*. I had already pointed out to Mr. Boulenger the identity of his *Liemys inornata* with *Brookeia baileyi*, and recently was able to obtain, through the kindness of Mr. Bailey, of the Sarawak service, a young specimen of this oft-described tortoise; Mr. Boulenger has compared this with the type of *Orlitia borneensis*, itself a young specimen, and in a letter he informs me that the two are identical. The head and entoplastron alone shew that the species is not a *Bellia*, but must occupy a genus by itself, for which the name *Orlitia* has already been provided.\n\n* See this Journal No. 35, pp. 43-68, 1901.\n\nR.
