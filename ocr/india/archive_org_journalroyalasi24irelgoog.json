I.\u2014Schools of Buddhist Belief. By T. W. Rhys Davids.\n\nI have received several interesting communications on my article, published in our Journal for last July, on the Sects of the Buddhists. The Rev. J. E. Carpenter has given me additional figures in Yuan Thsang which had escaped my notice. These numbers bring up the totals given by the Chinese author of the adherents of the different schools, as summarized on p. 420, to 200,000 instead of 182,000. But they leave the conclusion, which was drawn from those numbers, as it stood.\n\nProfessor B\u00fchler writes, that besides the references given on p. 410 to inscriptions mentioning one or other of the schools, there are a few other references known to him in inscriptions as yet unpublished. On a consequent application from me he has been kind enough to send a second letter in which the details are given, and it is here printed in full.\n\nMr. Bouverie-Pusey, who takes much interest in the question, has pointed out to me a possible explanation of Yuan Thsang\u2019s mistake in assigning the Sthavira school to the Mah\u0101yanists. When his informants, as stated in the \u2018Vie de Hiouen Thsang,\u2019 p. 192, were questioned by him, they may have been willing to leave on his mind the impression that they belonged to the same school as he himself did.\n\nMr. Bouverie-Pusey also suggests that use might be made of Wassilief\u2019s translation of the Tibetan version of the tract assigned to Vasumitra\u2014more especially as he has translated it in full with copious notes. I have accordingly read it through again to see what could be made out of\nit, and am obliged to say that I still think Rockhill's summary of the Tibetan notices of the Buddhist schools is the more intelligible of the two. But the fact is that short tracts like those attributed to Vasumitra and Bhavya and Vinita Deva are really of very little use without a larger knowledge which would supersede them except as guides to the memory. Even the Kath\u0101 Vatthu, which is some centuries older, and nearer, therefore, to the time when these discussions raged: which is also most probably written either in the very language, or at least in a dialect closely allied to the dialects, in which they were conducted; and which besides, being more than twenty times as long, is able to devote more space to making the questions at issue clear,\u2014is hard enough to understand. It is easy therefore to realize why it is that these translations of translations of earlier and shorter treatises should be so much more difficult to use to any profit. What we want is not short summaries of the opinions of all the various schools, but substantial works expounding the views of individual schools at length, and in their own words. When the magnificent edition of the standard book of the Lokuttara-v\u0101dins, which we owe to the self-denying scholarship and industry of M. Senart, shall be completed, all these works, the Kath\u0101 Vatthu itself not excepted, will be superseded on that point. We shall go to the Mah\u0101vastu to find out what the Lokuttara-v\u0101dins thought.\n\nAnd so let us hope that before the P\u0101li Text Society shall have been able to complete its important task of placing in the hands of scholars a complete edition of the Buddhist Pi\u1e6dakas, together with the interpretation put upon them by the oldest and sole surviving school (which has also kept most closely to them)\u2014by that time let us hope we shall be able to compare with that interpretation the divergent ones of other now extinct Hinayana schools in equally complete editions of their works too.\n\nAs I mentioned on p. 413 of the former article, the Mah\u0101vastu is the only work we have available in a critical edition that purports to belong to any special school. It\nis true that a much discussed passage\\(^1\\) of a Chinese author (whose name is restored by Bunyiu Nanjio\\(^2\\) to J\u00f1\u0101na-gupta, and by Beal\\(^3\\) to J\u00f1\u0101na-kuta \\textit{sic}\\), the Lalita Vistara is apparently stated to be a book of the Sabbatthiv\u0101dins. But that book calls itself (see the last page of the Calcutta edition) a Mah\u0101y\u0101na work! How is this to be reconciled? The passage referred to occurs in the colophon to the Fo-pan-hin-tsi-chin, of which work Beal\u2019s book, strangely entitled \u201cThe Romantic Legend of Sakya Buddha,\u201d is a kind of abstract. The Chinese title is restored by Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio (\\textit{loc. cit.}) to Buddha-p\u016brvacary\u0101-sa\u1e45graha-s\u016btra, and he adds below Abhinishkramana-s\u016btra, which is the only restoration used by Beal. The colophon says in Beal\u2019s version, \u201cIt may be asked: \u2018By what title is this book to be called?\u2019\u201d to which we reply the Mah\u0101sanghikas call it Ta-sse (Mah\u0101vastu). The Sarvastavadas (\\textit{sic}) call it Ta-chong-yen (Lalita Vistara). The Kasy\u0101piyas (\\textit{sic}) call it Fo-wong-yin-un (former history of Buddhism). The Dharmaguptas call it, etc., etc.\u201d And Wassilief\u2019s translation (\\textit{loc. cit.}) is practically the same.\n\nFrom this Wassilief draws the conclusion that \u201cunder different names they understood the same book.\u201d If that be so, it is certainly not the Lalita Vistara, for the analysis given by Beal is quite different from that work. But Foucaux draws the conclusion that the passage refers to different books, and regards it as a proof that they all existed towards the second century after the death of the Buddha (!).\n\nNow the Chinese title which Wassilief (and following him also Beal) restores here to Lalita Vistara is entirely different from the Chinese titles so restored by Bunyiu Nanjio in his Catalogues Nos. 159 and 160. It is therefore, to say the least, most doubtful whether it is the Lalita Vistara at all\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Foucaux, \u201cLalita Vistara\u201d (the Guimet edition), pp. vii, viii. Wassilief, \u201cBuddhismus,\u201d p. 123. Beal, \u201cLegend of Sakya Buddha,\u201d p. v; and Senart, \u201cMah\u0101vastu,\u201d vol. i. p. iii. M. Senart refers to \u201cdes autorit\u00e9s chinoises,\u201d but the two passages he gives in the note refer to the same authority.\n\n\\(^2\\) Catalogue of Chinese Books, No. 680.\n\n\\(^3\\) \\textit{loc. cit.} p. 1.\nwhich is here referred to. Even if it were, it would be entirely unwarranted to conclude that because a Chinese writer of 587 A.D. thought it belonged to the Sabbatthiv\u0101dins that it did certainly so belong; much less than because it did, it must have been written, as M. Foucaux thinks this passage proves, at the time when that school first arose (that is to say, in the second century after the Buddha's death). Surely it is better to leave so uncertain, and so late, a statement in its own obscurity, and to trust rather to the published text of the Lalita Vistara itself, and regard it therefore as a Mah\u0101y\u0101na book.\n\nWe cannot, therefore, refer to any work emanating from any school differing from the Sthaviras, save only to the one book of the Lokuttara-v\u0101dins. Meanwhile\u2014until we have such works\u2014the three Tibetan tracts and the P\u0101li treatise are of use for showing us the kind of thing we ought to look for. I have spent some days in trying to piece together the various statements the Tibetans make as to the Sabbatthi-v\u0101dins, hoping that this would serve as a specimen of what might be reaped from them in the way of positive information. But the results are too unsatisfactory\u2014contradictory, as it seems to me, on some points and simply unintelligible, even with the help of the Kath\u0101 Vatthu, on others\u2014to be fit for publication.\n\nBut I have put together a table of their statements as to the names and interdependence of the Hinay\u0101na schools, without attempting to harmonize their divergent and contradictory data. I have simply added in brackets the number of each corresponding name in the Therav\u0101da list given in my last article.\n\nAs the matter seems to be of interest, I have added also a complete synopsis of the questions discussed in the Kath\u0101 Vatthu. This I had prepared for my own use only, as an assistance in writing the introduction to the second volume of my Milinda (in which some of the questions are discussed), and had not intended it for publication, except eventually as part of an edition of the whole text. It is drawn up from a MS. in my own collection, a very faulty\none, I am sorry to say. One or two points may already be noticed. Those questions dealt with in chapters one and two are discussed at so much length that the two chapters make up about one-third of the book. Incidentally to the principal theses a number of other questions, subsidiary to the main issue, are put and settled. Including these, the number of questions put in the Kath\u0101 Vatthu is about a thousand. In one or two cases (II. 2 and XXII. 5) these questions are mentioned in the titles of the main thesis, and are included therefore in my synopsis. For the interpretation of the real meaning of the question put, which is often by no means certain from the words employed, much help has been derived from the commentary, as published by the late Prof. Minayeff for the P\u0101li Text Society.\n\nTABLE I.\nThe H\u012bna-y\u0101na Sects according to Tibetan Translations.\n\nVasumitra.\n\n1.

II.\u2014The Lineage of \"The Proud King.\" By Robert Chalmers, B.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nIt is a far cry from Gotama the Buddha to Mr. William Morris; but it will be the object of these pages to establish the succession, not apostolic but literary, linking together the Victorian poet and the Indian sage of the fifth century B.C. Like the author of \"The Earthly Paradise,\" Gotama had an ear for\n\nThe gentle music of the bygone years,\nLong past to us with all their hopes and fears.\n\nBut, unlike Mr. Morris, it was with a distinctly ethical purpose, and not to fill \"an empty day,\" that Gotama re-told those traditional stories of ancient India which are preserved in the P\u0101li J\u0101takas. One of the stories of the J\u0101taka-book (the story of Illisa\u00b9) has been \"adapted\" by Jewish and by Moslem theologians: it has pointed the moral of the medi\u00e6val monk, and adorned the tale of the troubadour; and in these latter days it has furnished a theme both to an American and to an English poet.\n\nThe argument to Mr. Morris's poem of the \"Proud King\" in \"The Earthly Paradise\" tells how \"A certain king, blinded by pride, thought that he was more than man, if not equal to God; but such a judgment fell on him that none knew him for king, and he suffered many things, till in the end humbling himself he regained his kingdom and honour.\" The incidents of Mr. Morris's poem will be familiar to all; but for the sake of clearness in tracing the story back through the several forms it has assumed in different ages, I may be pardoned for adding that, while the Proud King was bathing, his form had been assumed by an angel,\u2014\"an image of the\n\n\u00b9 No. 78 in Faub\u00f6ll's edition of the P\u0101li text, vol. i. (Tr\u00fcbner, 1877.)\nking, in rich apparel, crown and signet-ring,\"\u2014who was recognized by everybody as their lord, Jovinian. Denied by courtiers, servants, and his queen, the real king is driven with blows from his own palace, and does not regain his kingdom and honour until in his deep humiliation he prays to God\u2014\n\nDown, down, of folly I have had my fill,\nAnd am but now as first Thou madest me,\nWeak yielding clay to take impress of Thee.\n\nThen, with a parting admonition as to the omnipotence of God, the angel vanishes, and the humbled Jovinian is again hailed as king.\n\nThis story of \"The Proud King,\" like the old French Moralit\u00e9 \"L'orgueil et pr\u00e9somption de l'empereur Jovinian,\" is taken direct from a thirteenth-century story-book, the \"Gesta Romanorum.\" This treasury of old stories was compiled by a monk, or monks, in usum predicatorum; and it is important to note that it was in their hands that the story was first made to inculcate the virtue of humility and to serve as a warning against the deadly sin of pride. In the kindred Old English Romance entitled \"Robert of Cysille\" (the original of Longfellow's poem \"Count Robert of Sicily\"), this lesson is even more emphatically taught. For here the proud king's tribulation springs from his sneering (in church!) at the words in the Magnificat, \"He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble and meek.\" Doubtless it was the Gesta that suggested to Chaucer his lines in the Somnoure's Tale:\n\nMethinkith they ben like Jovynian,\nFat as a whal, and walken as a swan.\n\nTracing the story further back, we find in the Qur\u02be\u0101n this verse: \"And we did try Solomon and we threw upon his\n\n---\n\n1 See Herritage's edition for the Early English Text Society (Tr\u00fcbner, 1879).\n2 See Ellis's \"Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances\" (London, 1848).\n3 Palmer's translation in the \"Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. ii, p. 178; Burton's \"Arabian Nights,\" vol. i, p. 42, note 2; Sale's \"Koran,\" p. 344 of the 1844 edition; Lane's \"Selections from the Kur-\u0101n\" (London, 1879), p. 137.\nthrone a form; then he turned repentant.\" According to the interwoven commentary of the Koran and to other Arab commentators, this verse refers to the following legend. A wife of Solomon having practised idolatry in his palace, God punished the king by allowing a demon, \u0160akhr (or \u0160akhar) by name, to steal the signet-ring on which Solomon's kingdom depended. By virtue of this stolen ring \u0160akhr became possessed of the kingdom and sat on the throne in the borrowed form of Solomon. The dethroned king meantime, being unrecognized by any of his subjects, wandered about begging his bread, until after forty days\u2014which was the period during which the idolatry had been practised in his palace\u2014the demon \u0160akhr flew away, throwing the ring into the sea. The ring being miraculously found by Solomon inside a fish, he recovered his kingdom, and threw \u0160akhr with a great stone tied round his neck into the Lake of Tiberias. In later times \u0160akhr has emerged from the Lake as the bottle-imp, caught by the fisherman at the beginning of the Arabian Nights, and has attained more modern fame in the hands of Le Sage as \"Le Diable Boiteux.\" In this latter form the demon is known as Asmodeus, a name which carries us back\u2014unlike the \u0160akhr of the Moslems\u2014to the Jewish Talmud. In the Babylonian recension of this work, which was completed about 500 A.D., Solomon,\u00b9 unrecognized even in Jerusalem after the loss of his ring, is mocked by his own porter and driven with blows from his own door, like the proud king Jovinian. After many bitter experiences the outcast and despairing king throws himself to earth, and in a passion of tears implores the mercy of God whom he has so long forgotten. Soon after he finds his ring inside a fish, and is recognized again by the Sanhedrin (a body, by the way, which probably did not exist in Solomon's days), who advise him to beard the usurper in his hall, advice which the Sanhedrin have the less hesitation in giving when they reflect that the pseudo-king always kept his feet concealed in his robes,\n\n\u00b9 See Levi's \"Parabeln aus Thalmud,\" p. 82 et seqq., 2nd edit. Leipzig, 1877.\nand so was probably a demon. At the sight of the mystic ring Asmodeus shrieks aloud and vanishes, while Solomon again sits upon his magic throne.\n\nOf this \"Talmudic-Koranic fiction\" the Gesta Romanorum story (and therefore Mr. Morris's poem of the \"Proud King\") is \"the manifest descendant,\" in the words of the late Sir Richard Burton. With greater caution, and perhaps more certainty, it may be maintained that the traditions are akin, springing from one stock. The interesting fact to the student of comparative folk-lore is the evidence which the Jewish, Moslem, and Christian versions together afford of the evolution of stories. As in biology, so in folk-lore, heredity is tempered by variation adapted to new environment. The Jewish Rabbis, who edited the Talmudic version (which the monotheist Moslems borrowed directly or indirectly), had ever before their eyes the sin of idolatry,\u2014the historic weakness of the Chosen People. So the sin which the Jewish story punishes is idolatry,\u2014whereas with the followers of the lowly Nazarene the deadly sin is pride:\u2014\"deposit potentes de sede et exaltavit humiles.\"\n\nSo far as can be determined by comparing the two versions, the Koranic story does not appear to be directly borrowed from the existing Talmudic legend. Both agree, it is true, in their main features, including the identification of Solomon as the king punished for idolatry; but much greater probability attaches to the view that the two are merely parallel or sister versions. And though names are not in themselves strong evidence, this view is supported by the difference in name of the demon who assumes the form of Solomon. As has been\n\n1 Sale refers to En Jacob, part 2 (haggadic Tales from the Talmud), and to Yalkut in lib. Reg. p. 182, which merely refers to the Talmud. Another Talmudic version, given in the (earlier) Gemara of the Jerusalem Talmud, runs as follows: God said unto Solomon, 'Why should my crown be on thy head? Come down from off my throne!' And therewithal, as Rabbi Jose ben Chanina relates, there came down an Angel in the form of Solomon, who bade the king come down from the throne and seated himself thereon. Solomon wandered about through synagogues and schools repeating the words (Eccl. i. 1), 'I Koheleth was king over Israel in Jerusalem,' 'A king,' they answered him, 'lives in his palace, and dost thou say I Koheleth am king?' They beat him with a cane, and set a plate of beans before him. Then said he (Eccl. ii. 10), 'This is my portion and reward for all my pains.' This Jerusalem version omits all account of the restoration of Solomon to his throne.\nseen, the demon is called *Asmodeus* in the Talmud and *Sakhr* in Koranic legend. Leaving out of consideration the interesting question of the origin of \"Asmodeus,\" it is to be observed that the name \"Sakhr\" is in itself indicative of Indian origin. Sakhr is simply the god \u00c7akra of the older Indian theology, the archangel Sakka of P\u0101li. And in the P\u0101li J\u0101takas occurs the story of Ill\u012bsa, who is punished for sin and brought to repentance by the archangel Sakka assuming his form. Ill\u012bsa's sin, in accordance with the view of folk-lore evolution above laid down, is the sin most deadly in the eyes of a Buddhist. It is not pride as in the Christian versions, nor idolatry as in the Talmud; it is the refusal to give alms,\u2014a disposition necessarily abhorrent to the hearts of mendicant Buddhist friars, with whom almsgiving is ranked as the chief of virtues.\n\nStripped of non-essentials, the Ill\u012bsa-j\u0101taka may be summarized as follows:\u2014Ill\u012bsa, the Lord High Treasurer of Benares, though a millionaire, was a miser; he had pulled down the family almonry, driven the poor from his gates, and hoarded his wealth so that it was \"as a pool haunted by ogres.\" A niggardly act of his attracts the notice of his father, who at death had been reborn for his charity, etc., as the archangel Sakka. Sakka comes down from heaven, assumes the form of his miserly son, and proceeds to distribute the latter's darling riches. Denied by his friends, servants, children, and wife, and cudgelled in his endeavours to assert his identity, Ill\u012bsa is only restored to his former estate by the archangel, who says that it was as a punishment for miserliness that Ill\u012bsa's form had been usurped, and that unless he repents after this warning he will incur the final punishment of death.\n\nThe chain of sequence from the J\u0101taka to Mr. Morris is still far from complete, and it may be hoped that scholars with a larger knowledge than I can lay claim to, of the several literatures in which the story appears, may be willing to amplify and extend this sketch. Of peculiar interest is the appearance in Arabic writings of the archangel Sakka as Sakhr al Jinni. Reduced by Buddhism from his former\ndominion as the god \u00c7akra (or Indra) to be simply an archangel having sovereignty over the T\u0101vatimsa Heaven, Sakka has been further degraded by monotheism to the rank of a devil!\n\nThe following, in chronological order, are the several forms of the Ill\u012bsa-j\u0101taka:\n\nI. Ill\u012bsa-j\u0101taka.\n\nOnly the G\u0101th\u0101s or verses of the J\u0101takas form part of the Buddhist Canon as settled about 400 B.C.; but tradition says that the Atthakath\u0101, or commentary, on the J\u0101taka verses was brought by Mahinda to Ceylon in its present state in 250 B.C., there handed down in Sinhalese till 450 A.D., when it was re-translated into P\u0101li. The story of Ill\u012bsa is therefore part of the commentary only; but the original Canon contains the G\u0101th\u0101 (translated infra) reciting the physical characteristics of Ill\u012bsa, and stating the impossibility of deciding which of two claimants was the real Ill\u012bsa. The confusion as to identity is therefore as old as the Buddhist Pit\u0101kas, and had reference to an individual named Ill\u012bsa. There is no reason to suppose that the story, of which this G\u0101th\u0101 was the catchword, was not substantially the same in the year 400 B.C. as the J\u0101taka story in Prof. Faub\u00f6ll\u2019s text (cf. e.g. the Mah\u0101-Sudassana-J\u0101taka with the earlier Mah\u0101-Sudassana-Sutta and the Mah\u0101-Parinibb\u0101na Sutta, as showing the tendency of later Buddhist writers merely to amplify, not to alter the substance of, earlier compositions). I will, however, hazard the speculations (1) that the earliest Buddhist form was not so elaborate as that of the present J\u0101taka book, and (2) that Buddhism borrowed the tale, with Sakka, from pre-Buddhist folk-lore, now lost. (See Rhys Davids\u2019 \u201cBuddhist Birth-Stories\u201d (Tr\u00fcbner, 1881) for an elaborate discussion of the age, history, and place in literature, of the J\u0101taka book.)\n\nII. The Talmud.\n\n(i) The Gemara of the Jerusalem Talmud, begun by Rabbi Jochanan in 260 A.D. and finished some 50 years later at\nTiberias, contains an account of the usurpation of Solomon\u2019s throne by an Angel, with a meagre reference to his wandering unrecognized among his people, and to his being beaten and fed on humble fare. This Jerusalem story is rather an incidental reference to, than a complete version of, the Jewish legend of Solomon\u2019s dethronement.\n\n(ii) The Babylonian recension of the Gemara was finished by Rabbi Asha\u2019s sons in the year 498 A.D., according to Etheridge\u2019s \u201cHebrew Literature\u201d (1856). The story is related of King Solomon\u2014the centre round which crystalized many legends and tales\u2014and of the devil named Asmodeus. I am informed by the learned Talmudic scholars, Dr. Friedl\u00e4nder and Dr. Gaster, that, contrary to what might be inferred from the specific references in the note of Sale to the 38th chapter of the Koran, no such \u201cdevil\u201d as \u201c\u015eakhr\u201d is to be found in the Talmud.\n\nIII. The Qur\u2019an.\n\nIn the 38th chapter of this book, which was edited shortly after Mahomet\u2019s death in 632 A.D., there is an allusion to the Talmudic legend.\n\nIV. Commentators on the Qur\u2019an.\n\nThe interest attaching to the commentators\u2019 story is that here the Sakka of the J\u0101taka re-appears, in what is practically the Babylonian Talmudic version. I am indebted to Mr. Kay for the information that the Commentary of Zamakhshari, after telling the story about Solomon and \u015eakhr, goes on to say that the most learned commentators regard the story as altogether unworthy of credit, and that in fact it is only an old wife\u2019s tale invented by the Jews.\n\nBearing in mind the survival of Sakka in the Moslem version, I venture to think that it was only orthodox Judaism which had substituted Asmodeus in the adapted Indian story, and that the unorthodox Jews of Arabia (to whom Mahomet was indebted for no inconsiderable part of his knowledge of Judaism) had preserved in a more original form the old Indian story of which the Ill\u012bsa-j\u0101taka is the earliest known version.\nV. The Gesta Romanorum.\n\nAccording to Herrtage's Introduction to his edition of the Early English version of this well-known book, the date of its compilation is about 1300. Thence onward the story has suffered little or no change down to the present day. We are practically in the dark as to the sources from which this book was compiled. But it may well be that the Gesta story of King Jovinian was derived from the Talmud legend of Solomon through the mediation of converted Jews, such as John of Capua, the translator of the Directorium vitae human\u00e6.\n\nAs the Illisa-j\u0101taka (so far as I am aware) has not yet been translated into English, I append a version of it, in the hope that it may be of interest not only in the historical connection in which I have adduced it, but also for its own quaint humour and the graphic incidents with which the central idea had been embroidered in India more than two thousand years ago.\n\nIllisa-j\u0101taka.\n\nOnce on a time when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, he had a Lord High Treasurer who was a millionaire. Now this man was a churlish fellow, who hated his fellow-men; he was lame and crookbacked, and had a cast in his eye. Moreover, he was an unconverted infidel, and a miser. He never gave of his store to others nor had any joy of it himself, so that his house was like a pool haunted by ogres, whereat none may drink or slake their thirst. Yet for seven generations back his ancestors had been bountiful, giving freely of their best to the needy; but when this man succeeded to the office of Lord High Treasurer, he broke through the traditions of his house. He burned the almonry to the ground, and driving away the poor with blows from his door, hoarded his wealth.\n\nNow the Lord High Treasurer's father, who for his charity and other good works had been reborn as the archangel Sakka, chanced to be meditating on the blessings his charitableness\nhad brought him, and was bending over from heaven to look down on earth, when he saw his son behaving with great meanness. For the Lord High Treasurer, being thirsty, but not wanting to have to share his liquor with any one, had sent a slave with a few halfpence to the tavern to buy a whole jar of spirits for him. This the miser made the slave carry on ahead to the river side, where there was a dense thicket. Here he had the jar set down, ordering the slave to wait at a distance. Then he filled his cup and fell to drinking in solitary happiness. Indignant at this sight, Sakka cried, \"I will go to my son and teach him that all deeds bear their fruits; I will work my son's conversion and make him worthy of rebirth hereafter in the world of angels.\" So he came down to earth and once more trod the ways of men, putting on the semblance of his son, the Lord High Treasurer Illisa, with his son's lameness and humpback and squint. In this guise Sakka entered the city and made his way to the king's palace, where he bade his coming be announced to the king. Ordering him to be admitted, the king asked the object of so unexpected a visit. \"Sire,\" said the pretended Treasurer, \"I have a whole million of money stored away in my house. Deign to have it transferred to the royal exchequer.\"\n\n\"But, we are richer even than your lordship, and have no need to take your riches from you.\"\n\n\"If your majesty declines, I will give it away as likes me best.\"\n\n\"Do so by all means, if you wish,\" said the king.\n\n\"Very good, sire; I will,\" said the pretended Illisa, and with due obeisance departed from the royal presence to the Treasurer's house. All the servants thought it was their real master; and he gave orders to the porter that if any other person looking like himself should appear and claim to be the master of the house, the porter should cudgel such a one and throw him out. Then he seated himself in state in an inner chamber of the house, and, sending for the Lord High Treasurer's wife, announced his intention to be bountiful and to lavish his wealth in charity. Thought\nwife, children, and servants with one accord: \"This is indeed a novel mood for him to be in. It must be the spirits he has been drinking which have made him so good-natured and generous today.\" So he sent for the crier and bade him proclaim through the city that everyone who wanted gold and silver or jewels was to come up to Illisa's house. Accordingly a large crowd speedily besieged the gate, all carrying baskets and sacks. Then said Sakka, \"Fling open the doors of my treasure-chambers, and let each one here take what he will and go his way; it is my free gift to you.\" Without a moment's delay the crowd seized on the treasure, and piled up heaps of riches and filled sacks and vessels with the rich booty; and away they went, laden with their spoils. Now among them was a certain countryman who, thoughtfully yoking Illisa's oxen to Illisa's cart, loaded it with valuables. As the fellow travelled along the high road on his way from the city, he drew near the very thicket where the real Lord Treasurer was lying perdu, and sang his praises in these words: \"Heaven grant you may live to be a hundred, my good lord Illisa! What you've done for me will keep me without doing another stroke of work all my life long. Whose were these oxen?\u2014yours. Whose was this cart?\u2014yours. Whose the valuables in the cart?\u2014yours too. Never was father or mother so generous as you have been.\" These words filled the Lord High Treasurer with fear and trembling. \"Why, the fellow is mentioning my name,\" said he to himself. \"Can the king have been distributing my wealth to the people?\" At the bare thought he bounded from the bush, and, recognizing his own oxen and cart, seized the oxen by the cord, crying, \"Stop, fellow; these oxen and this cart belong to me.\" Down leaped the man from the cart, angrily exclaiming, \"You rascal! Illisa, the Lord High Treasurer, is giving away his wealth. Who, pray, are you?\" And he sprang at the Treasurer and struck him on the back like a falling thunderbolt, and went off with the cart. Illisa picked himself up, trembling in every limb, wiped off the mud, and hurrying after his\ncart, seized hold of the rein again. Again the countryman got down, and seizing Illisa by the hair, beat him about the head for some time; then taking him by the throat, he flung him heavily upon his face on the road, and drove off. Sobered by this rough usage, and filled with the direst forebodings, Illisa hurried off home. There, seeing folk making off with his darling treasures, he fell to laying hands on here a man and there a man, shrieking, \"Hi! what's this? Is the king despoiling me?\" And every man he laid hands on knocked him down. Bruised and smarting, he sought to take refuge in his own house, when the porters stopped him with, \"Hollos, you rascal! Where might you be going?\" And first thrashing him soundly with bamboos, they took their master by the throat and threw him out of doors. \"There is none but the king left to see me righted,\" groaned Illisa, and betook himself to the palace. \"Why, oh why, sire,\" he cried, \"have you plundered me like this?\"\n\n\"Nay, it was not I, my Lord Treasurer,\" said the king. \"Did you not yourself come and declare your intention of giving your wealth away, if I would not accept it? And did you not then send the crier round and carry out your threat?\"\n\n\"Oh sire, indeed it was not I that came to you on such an errand. Your majesty knows how near and close I am, and how I never in my life gave away, if I could help it, so much as a drop of oil or a blade of grass. May it please your majesty to send for him who has given my substance away, and to question him on the matter.\"\n\nThen the king sent for Sakka. And so exactly alike were the two that neither the king nor his court could tell which was the real Lord High Treasurer. Said the miser Illisa, \"Who, and what, sire, is this person? I am your majesty's Treasurer.\"\n\n\"Well, really I can't say which is the real Illisa,\" said the king. \"Is there anybody who can distinguish them for certain?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, my wife.\"\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nSo the wife was sent for and asked which of the two was her husband. And she said Sakka was her husband and went to his side. Then in turn Illisa's children and servants were brought in and asked the same question; and all with one accord declared Sakka was the real Lord High Treasurer. Here it flashed across Illisa's mind that he had a wart on his head, the existence of which was known only to himself and to his barber. So, as a last resource, he asked that his barber might be sent for. Accordingly, the barber was sent for and asked if he had any private means of knowing the real from the false Illisa. \"I could tell, sire,\" said he, \"if I might examine their heads.\"\n\n\"Then look at both their heads,\" said the king.\n\nOn the instant Sakka caused a wart to rise on his head, so that, after examining the two, the barber reported that, as both alike had got warts on their heads, he couldn't for the life of him say which was the real man. Hearing his last hope thus fail him, the Lord High Treasurer fell into a tremble; and such was his anguish at the now inevitable loss of his beloved riches, that down he fell in a swoon. Thereupon Sakka put forth his supernatural powers, and, rising in the air, addressed the king thence in these words: \"Not Illisa am I, O king, but the great Sakka.\" Then those around dashed water on the temples of the prostrate Illisa, who, recovering, rose to his feet and bowed to the ground before Sakka the Archangel. Then said Sakka, \"Illisa, mine was the wealth, not thine. I am thy father; and in my lifetime I was bountiful toward the poor and rejoiced in doing good; wherefore, I am advanced to this high estate and am Sakka, the Archangel. But thou, walking not in my footsteps, art a niggard and a miser; thou hast burned my almonry to the ground, driven the poor from the gate, and hoarded the riches thou didst inherit from me. Thou hast no enjoyment thereof thyself, nor has any other human being; but thy store is become like a pool haunted by ogres whereat no man may slake his thirst. Albeit, if thou wilt rebuild mine almonry and show bounty to the poor, it shall be accounted to thee for righteousness. But, if thou wilt not rebuild mine\nalmonry and show bounty, then will I strip thee of even that which remains to thee, and cleave thy head with the thunderbolt of Indra, and thou shalt die.\"\n\nAt this threat Illisa, fearing for his life, cried out, \"Henceforth I vow to excel in good works, and chiefly in charity to the poor.\" And Sakka accepted his promise, and after establishing his son in the Commandments and preaching the Truth to him from mid-air, departed to his own abode. And Illisa proved diligent in almsgiving and other good works, and so assured his rebirth hereafter in heaven.\nART. III.\u2014A Collection of Kammavac\u0101s. By Herbert Baynes, M.R.A.S.\n\nHaving recently received from Mandalay through the kindness of an uncle, several interesting and important Buddhist MSS. in P\u0101li, Burmese and Shan, I venture to lay before the Society a Collection of Kammavac\u0101s, some of which, though known to European scholars, have hitherto remained inedited.\n\nThe first Manuscript is a very handsome copy of the Kammavac\u0101m in Burmese Ritual, or 'tamarind-seed' letters painted with a thick black resinous gum on 16 leaves of royal discarded pasohs, each leaf containing 6 lines each side.\n\nIt begins with the Upasampad\u0101 or Buddhist Ordination Service, which is perhaps the best known of all the Kammavac\u0101s, having been edited by Spiegel in 1841, by Dickson in 1881, and by Frankfurter in 1883. Then follow eight others, namely:\n\n2. Ka\u1e6dhinadussam uppannam, 'the Bestowment of the Ka\u1e6dhina Robe.'\n3. Ticivarena avippav\u0101sa, 'the Investiture of a Bhikkhu with the three Robes.'\n4. S\u012bma-sammannit\u0101 sam\u0101na-samv\u0101sa ekuposath\u0101, 'the fixing of a Boundary for the Performance of the Uposath\u0101.'\n5. Thera-Sammuti, 'the Election of an Elder.'\n6. N\u0101ma-Sammuti, 'naming a Bhikkhu.'\n7. Vih\u0101ra-kappiyabh\u016bmi-Sammuti, 'the Dedication of a Vih\u0101ra.'\n8. Ku\u1e6divatthu-Sammuti, 'fixing a Site for a Bhikkhu's Residence.'\n9. Nissaya-mutta-Sammuti, 'Consent to a Release from Nissaya.'\nThe first seven are given by Dr. Frankfurter in his Handbook of P\u0101li, but whilst in his MS. the Bestowment of the K\u0101\u1e6dhina Robe comes fourth in the series, in mine it occupies the second place. So far as I know, the eighth and ninth Kammav\u0101c\u0101s have never been published. They are as follows:\u2014\n\nVIII.\n\nSu\u1e47\u0101tu me bhante Sa\u1e45gho.

A certain Bhikkhu, at his own instance, is about to build a house, not by the direction of others, for himself to live in. So he asks the Sa\u1e45gha to inspect the site. If it seem meet to the Sa\u1e45gha, let it appoint such and such Bhikkhus to inspect the site of the house with the said Bhikkhu. This is the motion.\n\nVenerable Sirs, let the Brotherhood hear me! A certain Bhikkhu, at his own instance, and not by the direction of others, is about to build a house to live in. So he asks the Sa\u1e45gha to inspect the site. The Sa\u1e45gha appoints such and such Bhikkhus to inspect the site for the house with the said Bhikkhu.\nWhosoever is in favour of appointing such and such of the Bhikkhus to inspect the site with the said Bhikkhu, let him be silent; whosoever does not approve, let him speak.\n\nSuch and such Bhikkhus have been elected by the Samgha to inspect the site of the house with the said Bhikkhu. By its silence the Samgha approves; thus I understand it.\n\nIn connexion with this Act of the Buddhist Chapter it is well to remember the following instructions given in the P\u0101timokkha (iv. 6):\n\nSamy\u0101cik\u0101ya pana bhikkhun\u0101 ku\u1e6d\u012bm k\u0101rayam\u0101nena ass\u0101mikam attuddesam pam\u0101\u1e47ik\u0101 k\u0101retabb\u0101. Tatr\u2019 idam pam\u0101nam, dighaso dv\u0101dasa vidatthiyo sugatavidatthiya, tiriya\u1e41 sattantara\u1e41, bhikkh\u016b abhinetabb\u0101 vatthudesan\u0101ya, tehi bhikkh\u016bhi vatthum desetabbam an\u0101rambham saparikkamanam. S\u0101rambhe ce bhikkhu vatthusmi\u1e41 sparikkamane samy\u0101cik\u0101ya ku\u1e6d\u012bm kareyya, bhikkh\u016b v\u0101 anabhineyya vatthudesan\u0101ya, pam\u0101nam v\u0101 atikkameyya, samgh\u0101diseso.\n\nIf any Bhikkhu, at his own instance, and not by the direction of others, should get a house built for himself to live in, he must have it built of the following dimensions. The length twelve spans of the span of Buddha, the breadth inside seven such spans. He must assemble the priests to lay out the site. The site must be laid out by them so as to do no damage [i.e. so as not to destroy white ants\u2019 nests or the abodes of other living things], and so as to have a clear space round it sufficient for a cart drawn by a yoke of oxen to pass. If any Bhikkhu, at his own instance, gets a house built on a site where life will be destroyed, and which has not sufficient space around, or if he fails to assemble the Bhikkhus to lay out the site, or if he exceed the limits (named above), he is guilty of an offence involving temporary separation from the Brotherhood.\n\nIX.\n\nAham bhante nissayamutta-sammutim icch\u0101mi. So \u2019ham bhante samgham nissayamutta-sammutim y\u0101c\u0101mi. [Dutiyam pi, tatiyam pi y\u0101citabbo.]\nSunatu me bhante sa\u1e45gho.

Khamati sa\u1e45ghassa tasma tu\u1e47\u1e0dhi, evam etam dh\u0101ray\u0101m\u012bti.\n\nBeing desirous, Venerable Sirs, of your consent to a release from Nissaya, I hereby ask the Sa\u1e45gha, formally, for such release. [This should be asked a second and a third time.]\n\nVenerable Sirs, may the Brotherhood hear me! If it seem meet to the Sa\u1e45gha, let it consent to the said Bhikkhu\u2019s being released from Nissaya. This is the motion.\n\nLet the Venerable Assembly hear me! The Sa\u1e45gha consents to the said Bhikkhu\u2019s release from Nissaya. Whosoever is in favour of the motion, let him be silent; whosoever does not approve, let him speak.\n\nRelease has been granted to the said Bhikkhu by the Sa\u1e45gha. By its silence the Sa\u1e45gha approves; thus I understand.\n\nThe second MS. consists of 58 Talipat leaves of 5 lines in characters which are midway between Burmese and Cambodian. Like the first it begins with the Upasampada. Then comes what may be called the Act of the Chapter with regard to Bhikkhus who have committed offences involving temporary separation from the Fraternity. We have, in fact, to deal with those questions of Probation, Penance and Rehabilitation which are discussed in the first three Khandhakas of the Cullavagga.\nSuddhantapariv\u0101sa.\n\nAham bhante sambahul\u0101 samgh\u0101dises\u0101 \u0101pattiyo \u0101pajjim. \u0100pattipariyantam na j\u0101n\u0101mi, rattipariyantam na j\u0101n\u0101mi. \u0100pattipariyantam na sar\u0101mi, rattipariyantam na sar\u0101mi. \u0100pattipariyante vematiko, rattipariyante vematiko.

I do not remember the degree of the offences, nor do I remember the duration of the times. I am uncertain as to the degree of the offences and as to the duration of the times. So I ask the Venerable Assembly for a probation of complete purification on account of these offences.\n\nLet the Venerable Fraternity hear me! A certain Bhikkhu has committed numerous offences involving temporary separation from the Brotherhood, but he is not aware of the degree of the offences and is unaware of the duration of the times. He does not remember either the one or\nthe other, and is, in fact, uncertain as to both. So he asks the Samgha for a probation of Complete Purification on account of these offences. If it seem meet to the Samgha, let it impose upon the said Bhikkhu a probation of Complete Purification on account of these offences.\n\nThis is the motion.\n\nVenerable Sirs, may the Samgha hear me! A certain Bhikkhu has committed numerous Samgh\u0101disesa offences, but he knows neither the degrees of the offences nor the duration of the times. He neither remembers the degree nor the duration of the times of such offences, and is, in fact, uncertain as to both. So he asks the Samgha to impose upon him a probation of Complete Purification in respect of these offences. The Samgha accordingly imposes upon this Bhikkhu such probation. Whosoever is in favour of the motion, let him be silent. I say the same thing twice, nay, thrice.\n\nLet the venerable Assembly hear me! A certain Bhikkhu has been guilty of many Samgh\u0101disesa offences, but he knows neither the degree of the offences nor the duration of the times. Of such offences he cannot call to mind either the degree or the duration of the times, and is, in fact, uncertain as to both. So he asks the Samgha for a probation of Complete Purification on account of such offences. Accordingly the Samgha imposes upon him such probation. Whosoever is in favour of the motion, let him be silent; whoso does not approve, let him speak! I say the same thing thrice.\n\nVenerable Sirs, let the Brotherhood hear me! A certain Bhikkhu has been guilty of several offences involving temporary separation from the Samgha, but he is ignorant alike of the degree of the offences and of the duration of the times. He does not recollect either, and is, indeed, uncertain as to both. So he asks the Samgha for a probation of Complete Purification on account of these offences. And the Samgha accordingly imposes such probation upon this Bhikkhu. Whosoever is in favour of granting to this Bhikkhu a probation of complete purification on account\nof these offences, let him be silent; whoever does not approve, let him speak! A probation of Complete Purification has been imposed by the Samgha upon this Bhikkhu on account of these offences. By its silence the Samgha approves; thus I understand it. I appreciate the probation, yea, I appreciate it in its fulness!\n\nVenerable Sirs, I have committed numerous Samgh\u0101disesa offences, but I am ignorant alike of the degree of the offences and of the duration of the times. I recollect neither, and am, indeed, uncertain as to both. So I asked the Samgha for a probation of Complete Purification on account of these offences, and the venerable Assembly granted me such probation.

I can recollect neither, and am, indeed, uncertain as to both. On account of these offences I asked the Sa\u1e45gha for a probation of Complete Purification, and the Sa\u1e45gha gave it me. After completing this probation I committed numerous unconcealed Sa\u1e45gh\u0101dises\u0101 offences, so I ask the Sa\u1e45gha, on account of these many offences, to impose upon me the M\u0101natta penalty.\n\nLet the venerable assembly hear me!

The Samgha accordingly imposed upon him such probation. Since completing this probation this Bhikkhu has been guilty of many Samgh\u0101dises\u0101 offences which he has not hidden. So he asks the Samgha, on account of the many offences, both hidden and unhidden, to impose upon him the M\u0101natta penalty.

Since completing this probation he has committed numerous like offences which he has not concealed, so he asks the Samgha, in respect of such numerous offences, to impose upon him the M\u0101natta penalty. The Brotherhood accordingly gives him such penalty. Whoever is in favour of the motion, let him be silent; whosoever does not approve, let him speak.

Since completing this probation the said Bhikkhu has been guilty of many open offences, involving temporary separation from the Brotherhood. On account of these many open and hidden offences he asked the Samgha for the M\u0101natta penalty. The Samgha accordingly gives the said Bhikkhu the said penalty.

After undergoing this probation, Venerable Sirs, I committed many open Sa\u1e45gh\u0101dises\u0101 offences; so I asked the Sa\u1e45gha to impose upon me, on account of these numerous open and hidden offences, the M\u0101natta penalty, and my request was granted. Having been subjected to that discipline, I now ask for rehabilitation.\nLet the venerable assembly hear me! A certain Bhikkhu having been guilty of numerous Samgh\u0101disesa offences, and having been ignorant, unmindful, and uncertain alike as to the degree of the offences and as to the duration of the times, asked the Samgha for a probation of complete purification, and his request was granted. After undergoing such probation the said Bhikkhu committed many open Samgh\u0101disesa offences, so he asked the Samgha on account of the numerous open and hidden offences to put him under the M\u0101natta discipline. His request was granted, and now, having accomplished that penance, he asks the Samgha for rehabilitation. If it seem meet to the Samgha, let it rehabilitate the said Bhikkhu.\n\nThis is the proposal.\n\nVenerable Sirs, let the Brotherhood hear me! A certain Bhikkhu having been guilty of many Samgh\u0101disesa offences, and having been ignorant, unmindful, and uncertain alike as to the degree of the offences and as to the duration of the times, asked the Samgha for a probation of complete purification, and his request was granted. Since undergoing that probation the said Bhikkhu has been guilty of many Samgh\u0101disesa offences, some of which he has hidden, others he has not hidden. For this cause he asked the Samgha for the M\u0101natta discipline, and his request was granted. Having now accomplished that discipline, he asks the Samgha for rehabilitation. The Samgha accordingly rehabilitates the said Bhikkhu. Whosoever approves of the proposal, let him be silent; whoso is not in favour of it, let him speak. I say the same thing twice.\n\n(Repeated) . . . . . . I say the same thing for the third time.\n\n(Repeated down to \"speak\"). The said Bhikkhu is rehabilitated by the Samgha. By its silence the Samgha approves; thus I understand it.\n\nVenerable Sirs, I am pure. Let the Samgha believe me to be pure and my character purified!\n\nThe complete purificatory Act of Rehabilitation is ended.\nTen lacquered Talipat leaves, five lines each side, in Burmese characters, constitute the third MS.

After undergoing that probation the said Bhikkhu committed numerous Samgh\u0101disesa offences which he did not hide; so he asked the Samgha, on account of the many offences hidden and unhidden, for the M\u0101natta discipline, and his request was granted.

IV.\u2014Bh\u016bridatta J\u0101taka Vatthu. By R. F. St. Andrew St. John, M.A.\n\nPrefatory Remarks.\n\nThis translation has been made from a Burmese copy printed at the Hanthawati Press, Rangoon, but there is nothing to show whence the text was taken. I have also made use of a manuscript taken from the Mandalay Library, and now at the India Office. The g\u0101th\u0101, which in many places seem to be imperfect, are not given in the shape of g\u0101th\u0101 in the Mandalay copy. In some cases the Burmese translation was redundant, and in others defective, so in translating them, though not a P\u0101li scholar, I have done my best to stick to the P\u0101li text, receiving some valuable assistance from Prof. Rhys Davids. The J\u0101taka is No. 547 in the Ceylon List, and what is called one of the Greater J\u0101taka, probably composed at a late date, as it refers to the Pandara J\u0101taka, No. 521 [vol. v. p. 75, of Fausb\u00f6ll], which I have translated in a note from another Burmese source.\n\nThe object of this very remarkable J\u0101taka is to set forth the general wickedness of Brahmans and the arguments in their favour given by K\u0101\u00f1\u0101rittha, who in a former birth had been a sacrificial Brahman, which arguments are refuted at length by the Bodhisat Bh\u016bridatta. There are two points to which I would draw special attention, which may throw light on the date or period at which it was composed.\n\n1st. In the twenty-first stanza of the first discourse (F. 157) there is a reference to certain practices in the country of Kamboja, which apparently has no connexion with what goes before.\n\n2nd. The appellation of the snake-charmer\u2014Alampayano. A derivative of this word, viz. Alampay, is now used in Burmese to denote a person who is skilled in catching snakes (vide Judson's Dictionary), and it may be argued\nthat this word was taken from the name of this snake-charmer celebrated in J\u0101taka-lore. I think, however, that there is evidence to show that it was not the man's proper name, but the name of the trade, for I find that the words used by the snake-charmer himself in relating the story of the Garu\u1e37a are, Alamp\u0101yanamantan\u0101ma \"the charms of a snake-charmer.\"\n\nThe word, therefore, I take it, has its derivation from Alam implying full, sufficient, and p\u0101ya drinking or having drunk. It may also be noted that the same word occurs in the Sudhammacari Stories, which I have given in Folk Lore Journal, vol. vii. part iv. p. 311, and that the Princess Sudhamma-cari is said to have been the daughter of Madda, a R\u0101j\u0101 of Kamboja.\n\nIt is much to be regretted that books which appear to be published by the \"Text-book Committee of Rangoon\" are not more carefully edited. They are full of errors.\n\nP.S.\u2014Since the above was written Professor Fausb\u00f6ll has had the very great kindness to favour me with a copy of his transcript of the P\u0101li verses of this J\u0101taka. It would have been impossible without his aid, so graciously given, to restore the right reading of many of them.\n\nBH\u016aRIDATTA J\u0100TAKA.\n\n(From the Burmese.)\n\nCHAPTER I. (Nagara.)\n\nOne day, when the most excellent Buddha was residing in the J\u0113tavana Monastery, he came into the hall, and, sitting down, looked round at the Rahans assembled there. Seeing amongst them some laymen who were keeping the fast-day, he took them as the subject of his discourse, and said, \"O devout laymen, ye do well in keeping the fast; but, inasmuch as ye have me to give you instruction, you must not think overmuch of your devoutness, for in past times there have been others who, though they had no teacher, relinquished great wealth in order to keep the fast.\"\nAt their request he then related the following birth-story:\n\nIn times long past, when Brahmadatta reigned in B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b, he appointed his eldest son to be Upar\u0101j\u0101; but, seeing that he had accumulated much wealth and many adherents, he feared that he might become a source of danger to the throne, and said, \"Dear son, I pray you depart into some other country, until I shall have passed away, when you can return and assume the royal estate, which is your inheritance.\" The Prince, obedient to his father's commands, left his country as a solitary wanderer, and took up his abode in a hut in a valley near the river Yamun\u0101, where he assumed the garb of an ascetic, living on the fruits which he found in the forest. At that time a certain N\u0101ga lady, who had lost her husband, came up from N\u0101ga land, and, seeing the Prince's footprints on the river shore, followed them till she came to the hut. The Prince being absent, in search of fruit, she entered, and, seeing his couch of dead leaves and other utensils, reasoned thus with herself: \"This hut belongs to a hermit: I will try him in order to find out whether he be a real ascetic, or only some person who is pretending to be one. If he be a real ascetic he will have no carnal desires and refuse to sleep on a couch that is adorned. If, however, he does recline on it, he will not be a real hermit, and will be willing to become my husband and dwell with me in this forest.\" She then went down to N\u0101ga land, and, bringing thence some fairy flowers, spread them on the couch and withdrew.\n\nIn the cool of the evening the Prince came back to his hut, and, seeing the flowers, exclaimed, \"Who on earth can have done this?\" He then made his supper and fell asleep upon the bed with sensations of delight. In the morning he got up, and, having swept out his cell, went again in search of fruits. When he was gone, the Nagini came again, and, seeing that the flowers were faded and crushed, said, \"Evidently this is no hermit, but a man of ordinary passions.\" She then removed the old flowers and strewed the\n\n1 The P\u0101li is matapatik\u0101 n\u0101gam\u0101\u1e47avik\u0101.\nthat with fresh ones. The second night the Prince was again very much astonished, but slept on the couch. In the morning he went out and concealed himself in the bushes near his hut to watch, and, on seeing the lovely Nagini, came out full of love for her, and asked her who she was. The lady replied, \"My lord, I am a Nagini, and my husband is dead. Whence come you, my lord?\" The Prince told her that he was the son of the R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, and proposed that they should dwell together. The Nagini at once agreed, and caused a splendid fairy palace to spring up, in which they dwelt with all manner of delights. In due course the Nagini bore a son, whom they named S\u0101gara, because he was born near the sea; and when he was able to run, she had a daughter, whom they called Samuddaja for the same reason.\n\nNot many years after this a hunter of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi came that way, and, recognizing the Prince, told him all that was going on. He told the Prince he would tell the R\u0101j\u0101 all about him, but, on reaching B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, found that the R\u0101j\u0101 was dead. On the seventh day after his decease the funeral took place, and then the nobles consulted, saying, \"Sirs, a country that is kingless cannot ward off the thorns of strife, and as we know not where our Prince is, we are powerless. We had better make ready the consecrated car\u00b9 and send it forth in search of a king.\" Whilst they were thus deliberating, the hunter returned and reported his discovery. As soon as the nobles heard the news, they rewarded the hunter, and proceeded with a great retinue as the hunter directed them. On reaching the Prince's dwelling, they told the Prince that he must return with them and take up the reins of government. Upon this the Prince went to his wife and said, \"Lady, my father has departed this life for that of the Devas, and the nobles have come to ask me to assume the royal estate: let us both go and reign in B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, which is twelve yojana in extent; you, my queen, will be the chief of 16,000 ladies.\"\n\n\u00b9 Consecrated chariot (phussarattho), in which have been placed the four great elements (mah\u0101bh\u016bt\u0101), viz. earth, air, fire, water.\nshe answered, \"My lord R\u0101j\u0101, I cannot, for I am endowed with a poison (or flame) which shows itself on the slightest feeling of irritation, and though I feel strongly that I ought to live with my husband, yet if I were to accompany him and anything were to arouse my anger, those who were the cause would be reduced to fine ashes: for this reason I cannot go with you.\" Next morning she entreated him as follows: \"My dear lord, since I cannot accompany you, and these children of ours, though N\u0101gas, are still to a certain extent human, be kind to them, if you really love me. Being of a race that lives in the waters, they are very tender, and cannot bear the rays of the sun; cause therefore, I pray you, that they make vessels to hold water, in which they may be conveyed, and when they arrive at B\u0101r\u0101nasi have a tank made for them to sport in.\" Having thus spoken, she passed round him by the right hand and, after saluting him and embracing both the children, departed weeping to serpent-land.\n\nSo the R\u0101j\u0101, heavy at heart and with brimming eyes, went forth from their palace to where the nobles were waiting for him, and when they had poured over him the water of consecration, he directed them to prepare the vessels in which to carry his children. When the vessels had been prepared, he directed that they should be placed on wheels and filled with water. In course of time they got to B\u0101r\u0101nasi, which was decorated for the occasion, and remained for seven days in a great pavilion surrounded by singers and dancers, whilst the nobles drank sweet liquors.\u00b9 The R\u0101j\u0101 then ordered a lotus tank\u00b2 to be made for the children to play in.\n\nOne day, when they were letting the water into the tank, a tortoise got in by accident, and being unable to get out concealed himself there. When the Prince and Princess were swimming about, one day, it put its head above the water and looked at them. The children, seeing the tortoise, fled in terror to their father, and told him there was a\n\n\u00b9 M\u0101h\u0101panam, great enjoyment, or big drink.\n\u00b2 Pokkhara\u1e47i.\n\nJ.B.A.S. 1892.\ndemon in the tank. The King summoned his attendants, and ordered that the tortoise should be caught. When it was found and brought, and the children declared that it was the demon that had frightened them, he ordered that it should be punished.\n\nOne nobleman suggested that it ought to be pounded in a mortar, another said that it ought to be boiled and eaten, another that it should be roasted; but one noble who was afraid of water, suggested that it should be thrown into a whirlpool in the river Yamun\u0101. On hearing this, the tortoise put out its head and said, \"O R\u0101j\u0101, what have I done? It would be a terrible punishment to throw me into a whirlpool, and I am ready to undergo any punishment rather than that.\"\n\nThe King, being very angry, at once ordered that the tortoise should be thrown into the whirlpool, and when the sentence had been executed, the tortoise was sucked down by the current to serpent-land.\n\nJust then a son of Dhatarattha, the N\u0101ga king, was sporting in the whirlpool, and seeing the tortoise, ordered it to be seized; whereupon the tortoise, who saw himself in a worse plight, cried out, \"Friends, why do you, who are the servants of Dhatarattha, treat me so roughly? I am an ambassador\\(^1\\) from the R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, named Cittac\u016bla, and he has sent me to inform your lord Dhatarattha that he wishes to give him his daughter in marriage. Take me before your R\u0101j\u0101.\" When the N\u0101ga youths heard this, they took him before the R\u0101j\u0101. But the R\u0101j\u0101 was displeased and said, \"The R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi ought not to have sent such an ugly fellow as this as his ambassador.\"\n\nThe tortoise called out, \"O R\u0101j\u0101 of the N\u0101gas, why do you say this? Ought an ambassador to be as tall as a palm tree?\\(^2\\) Ambassadors, whether they be tall or short, are estimated after the manner in which they perform their duties. O R\u0101j\u0101, my master the King of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi has many ambassadors: on land he employs men, and in the air\n\n\\(^1\\) D\u016bto, an emissary.\n\\(^2\\) T\u0101lo, Corypha.\nbirds; I am Cittac\u016bla the tortoise, no common tortoise, but a nobleman and bosom friend of the R\u0101j\u0101; do not revile me.\u201d\n\nThen the King of the N\u0101gas inquired on what business he had been sent, and the tortoise answered, \u201cMy lord, our master has made friends with all the kings who are on the face of the earth, but has not yet made an alliance with Dhatarat\u1e6dha, the King of the N\u0101gas; he is, however, willing to give you his daughter Samuddaj\u0101 in marriage, and ordered me to come to your majesty and inform you. Do not delay, O R\u0101j\u0101, but send some messengers with me to arrange the day for the wedding.\u201d\n\nDhatarat\u1e6dha, being pleased at this speech, summoned some of the N\u0101ga youths, and directed them to go to B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi and arrange the wedding. So they went with the tortoise; but just before they got to B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, the tortoise, seeing a pool of water handy, slipped into it and hid himself under pretence of gathering lilies as a present. After waiting some time for the tortoise, they went on, and taking human form went into the presence of the R\u0101j\u0101.\n\nThe King asked them why they had come and they answered, \u201cYour Majesty, we have been sent by Dhatarat\u1e6dha, the King of the N\u0101gas, and we trust that your Majesty is in good health.\u201d The R\u0101j\u0101 then asked them what special business they had been sent on, and they said:\n\n1. Yam ka\u00f1ci ratanam atthi Dhatarat\u1e6dha-nivesane,\n   Sabbani te up\u0101yantu; Dhitaram dehi R\u0101jino.\n   \n   \u201cWhatever treasure there is in Dhatarat\u1e6dha\u2019s palace,\n   Let all by thee be acquired; thy daughter give to the\n   R\u0101j\u0101.\u201d\n\nOn the King hearing this, he was enraged, and answered:\n\n2. Na no viv\u0101ho n\u0101gehi katapubbo kud\u0101canam\n   Tam viv\u0101ham asamyuttam,\\(^1\\) katham amhe karomase.\n\n\\(^1\\) Asamyuttam, according to B.M.S., means a bestial union.\n\"Not we a wedding with serpents contracted ever aforetime,\nThat wedding, that improper union, how can we (human) perform it?\"\n\nHearing this, the N\u0101ga youths thought, \"Of a truth this R\u0101j\u0101 belongs not to a race that is suitable to match with our King Dhatarat\u1e6dha, and yet he sent his ambassador Cittac\u016b\u1e37a to say he would give his daughter: we must display our power, and frighten this King of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, who has insulted our R\u0101j\u0101.\" So they said:\n\n3.

Yo tvam deva manussohi iddhimantam\u00b2 aniddhim\u0101\nVaru\u1e47assa niyam puttam Yamunam atima\u00f1\u00f1asi.\n\"Thou, who art of men a ruler, him almighty, thou so puny,\nVaru\u1e47a's own son, Yamun\u0101,\u00b3 do'st thou purposely insult then?\"\n\nThe R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi exclaimed:\n\n5.

Ahi mah\u0101nubh\u0101vo pi na me dhitaram arah\u014d\n   Khattiy\u0101 ca Videh\u0101nam abhijat\u0101 Samuddaj\u0101.\n   \n   \"A serpent, though he be mighty, is not of my daughter worthy;\n   A princess she of Videhas, high-born lady Samuddaj\u0101.\"\n\nOn hearing this, the young N\u0101gas were very wroth and said, \"Though we could now slay the King of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, with the breath of our nostrils, since we are under our master's order to arrange a marriage and not commit destruction, it will not be right for us to do so; so we will go and report the matter to our Lord.\" They therefore returned to serpent-land, and on arrival there the Serpent King questioned them, saying, \"Dear sirs, how is it? Have you brought the Princess Samuddaj\u0101?\" The enraged messengers answered, \"O R\u0101j\u0101, you sent us to the King of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi without knowing the truth of the matter; if you are angry and desire to slay us, do it here in serpent-land. The R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi was puffed up with pride and reviled thee.\" Thereupon the Serpent King cried:\n\n7.

Dhatara\u1e6d\u1e6dha the N\u0101ga King, too, overshadowed the whole city. Those who woke up in the night and stretched out their hands or feet felt nothing but hissing serpents, and shrieked out \"Alas! the serpents, the serpents.\" Some struck lights, and looking out saw the serpents writhing and twining themselves all over the gates and battlements and with one voice shrieked and wailed. So the whole city was in confusion, and when the day dawned, all the people, from the King downwards, were in a state of terror and cried out, \"O great Lord of the N\u0101gas, why do you thus torment us?\" The serpents answered, \"Your king sent an ambassador to our king promising his daughter in marriage, and afterwards treated our ambassadors with contumely, acting deceitfully and treating our king as though he were nought but a brute beast; verily if your king gives not his daughter to our king, we will destroy this city and all its inhabitants.\"\n\nOn hearing this, the people answered, \"O great N\u0101gas, be not afraid, but open a road for us to go to the palace and we will entreat our king.\" So the N\u0101gas allowed them to pass, and the people assembled at the door of the palace and wept with a great lamentation. The Queen, too, with all the ladies of the palace, cried out, \"O R\u0101j\u0101, give your daughter Samuddaj\u0101 to the King of the N\u0101gas.\" The four young N\u0101gas round the King's couch cried out, \"Give, give!\"\u00b9\n\nSo the King of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi was stricken with terror and shrieked out thrice, \"I will give my daughter Samuddaj\u0101 to Dhatara\u1e6d\u1e6dha the king of the N\u0101gas.\"\n\nWhen he had uttered these words, all the N\u0101gas retired\n\n\u00b9 This is the rough translation of verses 10 to 13.\nto a distance of three leagues from B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi and dwelt in a city which they had built for the purpose; they also sent suitable presents for the Princess. The R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi received the presents and informed the messengers that he would send his daughter in due state. He then sent for Samuddaj\u0101 and taking her to an upper chamber in a turret of the palace, opened the window, and said, \"My darling daughter, look at that beautiful city. I am going to give you in marriage to the R\u0101j\u0101 of that city, where you will be a queen. It is not far from here, and when you call to mind your parents, it will be easy to return and see them.\" Having thus spoken persuasively, he caused her to wash her head, and when she had been decked in jewels and rich garments, he sent her in a carriage\\(^1\\) with a retinue of nobles. The nobles of the N\u0101gas also came out to meet her with great honour. They then entered the N\u0101ga city and presented her to the King, who sent them back to B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi with rich presents. The King of the N\u0101gas placed the Princess in a splendid palace on a magnificent couch surrounded by N\u0101ga damsels in human form, where she soon fell into a deep sleep.\n\nThen Dhatarat\u1e6dha, accompanied by all his hosts, departed thence to serpent-land, and when the Princess woke up and saw all the N\u0101ga palaces and gardens, which were like those in the land of the Devas, she inquired of her attendants, saying, \"This country is very splendid and not like my own native land, whose country is it?\" and they answered \"Lady, it is the city of your lord and husband, Dhatarat\u1e6dha, the King of the N\u0101gas; it is not suitable for those who have not acquired merit. Since you have acquired merit, you have obtained this fairy dwelling-place and wealth.\" King Dhatarat\u1e6dha issued a proclamation to be made by beat of drum throughout all serpent-land, saying, \"Let no one dare show himself to Queen Samuddaj\u0101 in serpent form.\" So the Princess dwelt happily with R\u0101j\u0101 Dhatarat\u1e6dha, unaware that she was not in the country of men.\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Paticchannajoggam, covered conveyance.\nCHAPTER II. (Uposatha.)\n\nNow in due course Queen Samuddaj\u0101 bore a son to Dhatarattha, and as he was very beautiful, he was called Sudassana. Again, she bore another, who was named Datta. He was the Bodhisat. After this she bore Subhoga, and then a fourth, who was called Arittha. Up to that time Queen Samuddaj\u0101 did not know that she was in serpent-land; but one day some one said to the little Arittha, \"Your mother is not a N\u0101ga, but a human being;\" so he determined to put her to the test, and one day when at her breast he changed himself into serpent form and coiled his tail round his mother's instep. When the Queen saw this, she was terrified, and, shrieking, struck him to the earth with her hand, and one of her finger nails happening to injure his eye, he became blind in that eye, and the blood ran out. Dhatarattha, hearing the Queen cry out, asked what was the matter, and hearing what Prince Arittha had done, threatened to have him slain. But Queen Samuddaj\u0101 said, \"O R\u0101j\u0101, one of his eyes is put out, do not punish him further, be merciful I pray you.\" So the R\u0101j\u0101, out of love for his Queen, pardoned him. From that day Queen Samuddaj\u0101 knew that she was in serpent-land, and her son Arittha was called K\u0101\u1e47\u0101rittha.\n\nNow when the Prince was grown up, their father divided his country into five parts, and gave them each a division with a proper retinue. He kept one division for himself. Sudassana, Subhoga and K\u0101\u1e47\u0101rittha used to come once a month to see their father, but Datta came every fortnight, and if there was any difficult question, he would solve it. When he went with his father to Vir\u016bpakkha, he also solved any difficult questions that were asked. One day Vir\u016bpakkha went with all the N\u0101ga hosts to T\u0101v\u0101timsa to do homage to Sakko, and a difficult question was mooted. When no one was able to solve it, the Bodhisat Datta\n\n1 K\u0101no, one-eyed.\n2 The Burmese always use the Sanskrit form prasna for the Pali word pa\u00f1\u00f1a.\n3 Vir\u016bpakkho, the King of all N\u0101gas and Regent of the West.\nexplained it, at which Sakko was delighted, and said, \"Dear son, Datta, you are as full of wisdom as the earth is thick, from henceforth you shall be called Bh\u016bri-datta.\"\u00b9\n\nFrom that day he remained in attendance on Sakko.\u00b2 Seeing Sakko in his palace, called Vejayanta, surrounded by beautiful fairies dressed in goodly apparel and covered with jewels, he was desirous of becoming a Deva, and thought, \"What advantage is there in being a raw-flesh\u00b3 eating N\u0101ga? I will return to serpent-land and keep the fast-days.\" So he returned to serpent-land, and said, \"Dear father and mother, I intend to keep the fast-days.\" They answered, \"Dear son, do as you wish, but, if you keep them outside serpent-land, on the surface of the earth, there will be danger.\" The Bodhisat answered, \"Good, I will keep them in a quiet garden in serpent-land.\"\n\nHowever, whilst thus engaged, the young N\u0101ga girls surrounded him, playing on various instruments, and disturbed him; so he said, \"I cannot keep the fast properly here, I will go to the country of men;\" but, fearing that his parents might prevent him, he called his wives and said, \"Ladies, I intend to go to the country of men and coiling myself round an ant hill at the foot of a banyan tree on the banks of the Yamun\u0101, keep a fourfold fast: on the morning of the following day come with all your retinue and musicians, and conduct me back to serpent-land.\" Having thus instructed them, he went and coiled himself on the top of an ant hill and reflected thus, \"If any one desires to take my skin, my sinews, my bone or my blood, let him do so.\" Then, making himself rigid like the log of a harrow, he kept the fast. When \u0100ru\u1e47a sent forth his rays, the N\u0101ga women came as directed and conducted him back to N\u0101ga-land, and in this manner he fasted many times.\n\n\u00b9 Bh\u016bri in Pali means both earth and wisdom.\n\u00b2 The Burmese form of Sakko is Sikr\u0101. The Sanskrit form Sakra, adapted to Burmese by changing a to i, which makes it thi-ky\u0101, i.e. \"He who knows and hears.\"\n\u00b3 I find the P\u0101li word is manduka bhakkhena frog-eating. The mistake has occurred through the similarity of the Burmese words ph\u0101 a frog, and th\u0101 flesh. So, green and raw being the same word, green-frog became raw-flesh.\nChapter III. (Nagarapavesana.)\n\nNow at that time there dwelt in a village near the gate of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi a Brahman (named Nes\u0101da), who, with his son Somadatta, used to get his living by killing deer. One day this Brahman, not being able to find even a lizard, said, \"Dear son Somadatta, if we go home empty-handed, your mother will scold.\" Just then they came close to the place where the Bodhisat was fasting and went down to the Yamun\u0101 to drink. On coming up they saw the track of a deer, so the Brahman said to his son, \"Somadatta, I see the footprints of a deer, stand still for a little and I will shoot it.\" Then taking his bow and arrows, he remained on the watch at the foot of a tree. The deer came down to drink and the Brahman shot at it, but it made off, leaving traces of its blood. The two hunters followed it up, and when they found it, the sun was just setting, and they arrived at the banyan tree where the Bodhisat was fasting. They agreed that they would go no further that night, and, having hid away the carcase of the deer, climbed into the tree. In the morning the Brahman woke up, and just then the N\u0101ga ladies had come to escort Bh\u016bridatta back to serpent-land. Hearing the sound of their music, he tried to waken his son Somadatta, but being unable, he let him sleep and went alone, and going up to the Bodhisat said:\n\n14. Pupph\u0101bhih\u0101rassa vanassa majjhe\n   Ko lohitakkho vihalantaranso\n   K\u0101 kambuk\u0101y\u016bradhar\u0101 suvatth\u0101\n   Ti\u1e6d\u1e6dhanti nariyo dasa vandam\u0101n\u0101.\n\n\"In the midst of a forest full of flowers fit for offerings,\nWho is this red-eyed, mighty, broad-chested one?\nWho these gold-bedeckt, well-adorned ones,\nThese women, thy slaves, who stand in obeisance?\"\n\n1 The P\u0101li stanzas, if any, are wanting in the Rangoon edition, but are given split up in the Burmese M.S.; as under by Professor Faub\u00f6ll.\n15.

N\u0101go ham asmi iddhim\u0101 tejas\u012b durabhikkamo\nDasseyyum tejas\u012b kuddho phit\u0101m janapadam api.\n\n\u201cA N\u0101ga I am, of great power, in glory surpassing,\nShould I bite with my poison in wrath, e\u2019en prosperous townships (would be destroyed).\u201d\u00b2\n\n17. Samuddaj\u0101 ti me m\u0101t\u0101 Dhatarattho ca me pit\u0101\nSuddassana kanittho \u2019smi Bh\u016bridatt\u0101ti mam vidu.\n\n\u201cSamuddaj\u0101 is my mother, Dhatarattha too my father,\nSuddassana my younger brother, Bh\u016bridatta \u2019tis they call me.\u201d\n\nAfter he had said this, he reflected, \u201cThis Brahman is a cruel old fellow; if he were to point me out to a snake-charmer, I should incur great danger. I will therefore carry him off to serpent-land and endow him with great wealth, and so be able to continue my fasts in security.\u201d He therefore said to the Brahman, \u201cCome with me to serpent-land and see all its delights. I will give you great wealth.\u201d The Brahman answered, \u201cMy lord, I am not alone, but my son is up in the tree: if he may come too, I will go.\u201d After saying, \u201cCall your son,\u201d the Bodhisat said:\n\n\u00b9 Yakkho, a superhuman being.\n\u00b2 The Burmese M.S. supplies bhasm\u0101 bh\u0101veyya would become ashes. Tejo flame, power, is also translated poison.\n18. Yam gambhiram sad\u0101vat\u1e6dam rahadam bhasmam avekkhasi\nEsa dibbo m\u0101m\u0101v\u0101so aneka-sata-poriso.\\(^1\\)\n\n\"This profound and ever-boiling pool, so dread, behold (I pray you),\n'Tis my supernatural dwelling, deeper than a hundred fathoms.\"\n\n19.

The Bodhisat gave them much riches and five hundred fairy wives. So the two Brahmans enjoyed great wealth and the Bodhisat was able to keep his fasts. Every half-moon he came to see his father and mother and preach the law; then he went to the Brahmans and inquired after their health and wishes.\n\nOne day the old Brahman, after about a year had passed, felt unhappy, and wishing to return to the country of men, began to feel as if serpent-land were hell, and all the beautiful ornamented palaces like prisons, and the lovely N\u0101ga girls like devils; so he determined to go and talk to Somadatta. On getting there he said, \"Dear son, are you happy here?\" Somadatta replied, \"Dear father, why should I not be happy? are you not happy too?\" His father answered, \"Dear son, it is long since I have seen your mother, brothers, and sisters, I am unhappy, let us go away.\" At first Somadatta refused; but as his father besought him, he at last consented. The old Brahman thought, \"If I tell Bh\u016bridatta that I am unhappy, he will\n\n\\(^1\\) Poriso, lit. a man, whose height represents a fathom.\nonly heap more wealth on me. I must pretend to praise his wealth and splendour, and ask him why he relinquishes them to go and fast on earth. If he says that he fasts in order to go to Deva-land, I will say that we too must go back in order to get permission from our relatives to become ascetics; if I put it in this way, he will not be able to refuse, but will give me permission to return to earth.\u201d Shortly after this Bh\u016bridatta came, and the old Brahman said:\n\n\u201cBh\u016bridatta, in thy kingdom, this land complete in every way.\u201d\n\n21.

We are but servants of Sakko, and ought not to be\nput in comparison with him.\"\n\n27.

Eso vata me chando yam va seei mam antike\nNa hi et\u0101dis\u0101 k\u0101m\u0101 sulabh\u0101 honti m\u0101nuse.\n\n\"Yea, 'tis indeed my desire that you should dwell in my\npresence;\nFor not forsooth are such pleasures with ease obtained\nby all mortals.\"\n\n31.

Dh\u0101ray' imam manim dibbam pasu putte ca vindati\nArego sukhiho hoti gacchev\u0101d\u0101ya br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101.\n\n\"He who bears this fairy ruby flocks and herds and sons\npossesses,\nFree from sickness, happy is he; taking it, depart, O\nBr\u0101hma\u1e47a.\"\n\nThe Brahman replied:\n\n33. Kusalam patinand\u0101mi Bh\u016bridatta vaco tava\nPabbajiss\u0101mi jinno 'smi na k\u0101me abhipatthaye.\n\"Health and thanks to thee I offer, Bh\u016bridatta, for thy kindness;\nI intend to be a hermit, old I am and nought desire I.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat then said: \"O Brahman, since you are determined to be an ascetic, so be it; but if at any time through inability to carry out your vows, you relinquish that life, come to me, without fear, and I will give you great wealth.\"\n\n\"Bh\u016bridatta, Prince of N\u0101gas,\" said the Brahman, \"your words are very pleasant: in the hour of need I will certainly come to you for help.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat then summoned some N\u0101ga youths and directed them to conduct the Brahman and his son back to the country of men; so they took them close to the city of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b and left them. The Brahman then said to his son, \"Dear Somadat, this is the spot where I killed the deer, and here I slew a wild boar;\" and thus conversing about the old familiar haunts, they came to a pool of water, in which they proceeded to bathe; and as soon as they went into the water, their fairy garments disappeared, and their old garments came in place of them, and their bows and arrows. Then Somadatta wept and said, \"Father, to what misery we have returned after so much magnificence!\" But the old Brahman replied, \"Son, be not afraid, deer are not scarce in the forest, and we can still get our livelihood by killing them.\" Thus conversing they arrived at their home.\n\nWhen Somadatta's mother heard that her husband and son had arrived, she ran out to meet them, and, bringing them into the house, set food and drink before them. When he had eaten and drunk, he fell asleep, and then she said to her son, \"Dear Somadat, you and your father have been absent for a long time, what city have you been residing in?\" He said, \"Dearest mother, Bh\u016bridatta, the King of the Serpents, carried us both off to his country, but, though\n\n1 34, 35, 36, and 37, are not given as g\u0101th\u0101 in the Burmese version.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nwe enjoyed great wealth and pleasure there, we were unhappy and have come back.\" \"If that is true,\" said the Brahmaness, \"have you brought any precious stones with you?\" \"No,\" said Somadat, \"we have brought none.\" \"Didn't the Serpent King give you a single thing?\" asked the mother. \"He offered my father a ruby ring, mother, but he would not take it; and I heard him tell the Serpent King that as soon as he got back to earth, he would turn hermit.\" \"Ah!\" said the Brahmaness, \"he has forsaken his wife and family all these long years, and I have had all the trouble of feeding the household, whilst he has been enjoying himself, and now he wants to become a hermit!\" So in a furious passion she began to belabour her husband with the stirring stick, saying, \"Heh! Brahman, what do you mean by coming back from Bh\u016bridatta's country after refusing the wishing ring? You are going to be a hermit, are you? Very well, get out of my house sharp, will you!\"\n\nThe Brahman cried out, \"Madam, do not get into such a passion; deer are not scarce in the forest. I will practise my calling as a hunter, and support you and your family.\" He then went off with his son into the forest.\n\nNow at that time a Garu\u1e37a was perched on the top of a silk cotton tree in a forest on the shore of the southern ocean, flapping its wings, by which means it divided the waters and seized a N\u0101ga that was below. In those days the Garu\u1e37as did not know the proper way of seizing a N\u0101ga, and used to seize them by the head; but afterwards, through the advice of a hermit, which is related in the Pa\u1e47\u1e0dara J\u0101taka,\u00b9 they learnt to seize\n\n\u00b9 The Pa\u1e47\u1e0dara J\u0101taka is to be found in J\u0101taka, vol. v. p. 75, and the Burmese version from the Maniratanapon is attached to this as a note.\n\nIn the country of B\u0101r\u0101pasa, when Brahmadat was king, 500 sailors were wrecked in the sea, and, by the force of the wind, one of them was carried to Karampira harbour. On account of his emaciated body, people said, \"This ascetic is a person of small requirements,\" so they kept him. Thinking that he was now well off, and to keep up his character, when they offered him garments he declined them. The people, thinking it was impossible to find a more abstemious man, had a great regard for him and built him a cell, and he was known far and wide as the \"Naked one of Karampira\" (Karampira acelaka). A prince of the N\u0101gas and a prince of the Garu\u1e37as used to come and worship him, and one\nthem by the tail. This Garu\u1e37a, however, not knowing the right way, seized this N\u0101ga by the head, and carried it off wriggling to the Himavanta forest. There was also at that time in the country of K\u0101si an ascetic Brahman, who dwelt occasionally in a cell in the Himavanta, near which there was a great banyan tree, and as this hermit was sitting at the foot of the tree, the Garu\u1e37a flew past with the N\u0101ga. The N\u0101ga twisted its tail round the branches of the banyan tree, but the strength of the Garu\u1e37a was such that it carried off the tree with the N\u0101ga, without being aware that it had done so. The Garu\u1e37a, perched in a tree, devoured the N\u0101ga's entrails, and threw the body into the sea, whereupon the banyan tree fell with a crash. The Garu\u1e37a looked round to see what it was, and thought, \"Why, this must have been the banyan tree, that grew by the hermit's cell. I must go and find out whether he is angry with me for what has been done.\" So he flew down to the hermit's cell, and, having taken up a reverent attitude, said, \"O hermit, what is this level spot!\" The hermit answered, \"O Garu\u1e37a, my supporter, a Garu\u1e37a came flying by here with a N\u0101ga, and as he passed the N\u0101ga twisted its tail in the banyan tree and it was carried away.\" \"Is the Garu\u1e37a to be blamed, O hermit?\" \"No, Garu\u1e37a, the N\u0101ga did it in self-defence, and is not to be blamed.\" \"Reverend Sir, I am that Garu\u1e37a, and I am much gratified at the manner in which you have replied to my questions; I know a charm that will keep\n\nday, when so engaged, the Garu\u1e37a said, \"We Garu\u1e37as when catching N\u0101gas are often destroyed by drowning, there must be some secret cause for this; when the N\u0101ga comes, ask him the reason and let me know.\" The ascetic agreed, and when the N\u0101ga came, he questioned him; and the N\u0101ga said, \"If I were to tell this, all the future generations of N\u0101gas would be destroyed; but if you will promise not to reveal it, I will tell you.\" The ascetic promised, saying, \"If I do, may my head be split in seven!\" The N\u0101ga then said, \"When the Garu\u1e37as are going to swoop, we make ourselves a thousand cubits long and swallow a great rock and then show fight with our heads, so when the Garu\u1e37as seize our heads they cannot lift us and get drowned; but if the Garu\u1e37as seized us by the tail and held us upside down, we should vomit the rock.\" The hermit, however, did not keep his promise, but told the Garu\u1e37a. The Garu\u1e37a, therefore, went and seized the N\u0101ga, and whilst he was being carried off, he told the Garu\u1e37a how he had been deceived. The Garu\u1e37a took pity on him, and telling him that it is always best to keep secrets, let him go. The N\u0101ga then wished that the punishment of oath-breaking should befall the hermit, and immediately his head split into seven pieces and he went to Avici.\noff all serpents, and will impart it to you for your kindness.\" The hermit answered, \"I have no need for snake-charms, go in peace.\" But the Garu\u1e37a insisted and taught him the charm.\n\nThere was also at this time a poor Brahman in B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b who was sore pressed by his creditors, so he went out into the forest, saying, \"It is better that I should die there than continuing to live in this wretched manner.\" In due course he came to this hermit's cell, and served the hermit in many ways, and in return the hermit imparted to him the snake-charm, which had been taught him by the Garu\u1e37a, and also gave him some of the medicine which had been given him. The poor Brahman, having now got a means of livelihood, stayed a day or two longer, and then saying he had got the rheumatism, and wanted to get medicine for it, took his departure. After a short time he arrived at the banks of the Yamun\u0101, and went along the road repeating his charm. Just then a thousand of Bh\u016bridatta's female attendants came, bringing with them the great wishing ruby, and, whilst they disperted in the water, placed it on a sand-bank, to give forth its light during the watches of the night. At dawn they put on their ornaments, and, surrounding the great ruby, displayed their splendour. As the Brahman came up, the N\u0101gas heard him reciting his charm, and, thinking he was a Garu\u1e37a, fled, leaving the ruby, on seeing which the Brahman was delighted and carried it off.\n\nJust then the Brahman, Nes\u0101da, and his son, Somadatta, came out of the forest, and, seeing the Brahman carrying the ruby, he said, \"Dear Somadat, is not this the ruby that the Prince Bh\u016bridat offered us?\" \"Yes, father, it is the very same.\" \"Then (said Nes\u0101da) we will get it by stratagem, for he does not know its value.\" Somadatta answered, \"Father, when Prince Bh\u016bridatta offered it to you, you refused it; why do you want it now? Perhaps the Brahman will be too sharp for you. Do not speak to to him, but keep still.\" But Nes\u0101da answered, \"That may be, but just see how we shall both try to get round one another.\"\nHe then said to the snake-charmer:\n\n38. Ma\u1e47im paggayha mangalam s\u0101dhu vittam manoramam\nSelam bya\u00f1jana-sampannam ko imam ma\u1e47im ajjhag\u0101ti.\n\n\"Thou who bearest this blest jewel, this good, heart-\ndelighting treasure,\nStone so perfect in appearance, tell me where you found\nthis jewel.\"\n\nTo which the snake-charmer replied:\n\n39.

You are not the sort of person to\ncarry about a ruby, sell it me for a hundred pieces of gold.\nI know how to treat it.\" (Nes\u0101da had not a hundred pieces\nof gold, but he thought that if he once got it into his\npossession, he would soon get the hundred pieces.)\n\n40.

I took both him and his son to N\u0101galand, and when they wished to depart, I offered them precious stones, but he would not take them, and now he has come with this snake-charmer. If I were to show my wrath to this Brahman, who is so treacherous to his friends, my\n\n1 The Mandalay MS. has eso k\u0101yo paddissati his body is to be seen; Faub\u00f6ll, eso kayassa dissati.\nfasting would be of no avail. It is better to pursue this course of religious duties than to be irritated. If this serpent-charmer wishes to cut me in twain, let him do so: if he desires to cook me, he may do so; or toast me on a spit, he may do so: I will not be angry. If I were to look at those two, in my wrath, they would melt like cakes of honey; but I will not, and if they smite me, yet will I not be enraged.\u201d Then, closing his eyes in fixed determination, he withdrew his head into his coils and lay motionless.\n\nThen said Nesa\u0101da again, \u201cSnake-charmer, seize this serpent and give me the ruby.\u201d Whereupon the snake-charmer in delight threw him the ruby, saying, \u201cTake it, brother.\u201d But the ruby slipped through his fingers and falling to the earth, disappeared, going back to serpent-land. When Nesa\u0101da saw that the ruby was gone and his son too, and that he had also lost his friend Bh\u016bridatta, he said, \u201cAlas! I have greatly erred in not listening to the advice of my son,\u201d and he wept bitterly.\n\n64. Ath' osadhehi dibbehi japam manta-pad\u0101ni ca\nEvam tam asakhi sattham katv\u0101 parittam attano.\u00b9\n\nThe snake-charmer then, having smeared himself all over with ointment to protect him, and having recited his charm, approached the Bodhisat, and seizing him by the tail, grasped him firmly by the head. He then opened his mouth, and having put drugs into it, spat into it.\n\nThe Bodhisat, however, for fear that he might lose the merit of his religious duties, remained unangered and with closed eyes.\n\nThen the snake-charmer held him by the tail, and shaking his head downwards, caused him to vomit, and then laying him at full length, kneaded him like a piece of leather.\n\n\u00b9 The Mandalay MS. does not give S. 64, but reads:\ndibboseadhehi attano sariram makkhetva\nhtokamp kh\u0101ditva attano k\u0101y\u0101m paribbhositv\u0101\ndibba mautam jappanto bodhisattam upass\u0101kamitv\u0101\nna\u1e45gu\u1e6da gahetva ka\u1e0d\u1e0dhyitva sisam dalun\nganhanto assa mukham vivaritv\u0101 oeadham\nkh\u0101ditv\u0101 mukhe khej\u0101m pakkhipi.\nThen again taking him by the tail he banged him up and down, like one who washes clothes. Still, though the Bodhisat underwent all this misery, he showed no anger. The snake-charmer having thus taken all the strength out of him, and woven a basket of canes, put him into it. As the body of the N\u0101ga Prince was larger than the basket, the snake-charmer pressed him into it with his heel, and having thus forced him into it, carried him off to the neighbouring village, where he summoned the people to see a performance. When the people were assembled, he cried out, \"Come forth, prince of serpents.\" The Bodhisat, thinking that it would be better to come out and dance, so that the Brahman might get a considerable amount of money, and then release him, came forth and did all that the snake-charmer ordered him to do. When the people saw him go through this performance, there was not a dry eye amongst them, and they threw their gold and silver ornaments to the Brahman: and in that village alone he got property worth a thousand pieces.\n\nNow it happened that when the snake-charmer caught Bh\u016bridatta, he had determined to let him go again, after he had accumulated a thousand pieces of silver; but being a covetous man, he broke this good intention, and having made a handsome decorated cage and purchased a comfortable carriage, he went from town to town, surrounded by many followers, and at last arrived at the city of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi. He fed Bh\u016bridatta on parched corn and honey, and caught frogs for him, but the Bodhisat refused to eat, seeing that he would not be released; however, the snake-charmer made him dance in all the quarters of the city. On the 15th day of the month, which was a holiday, he obtained permission to give a performance before the R\u0101j\u0101, and tiers of seats were erected on the plain before the palace.\n\nNow on the day that Bh\u016bridatta was caught, his mother, Samuddaj\u0101, dreamt that \"A man, with red eyes, cut off her right arm with a sword and carried it away streaming with blood.\" She sprang up in terror, feeling for her arm,\nbut finding it was there, knew that it was only a dream. Then she thought this evil dream must portend some great calamity to her or her husband, and said, \"Verily, I am in great fear for my son Bh\u016bridatta, for all the others are in N\u0101ga-land, but he has gone to fast in the country of men: I fear that he has been seized by a snake-charmer, or a Garu\u1e37a.\" On the 15th day after this dream she thought, \"It is more than half a month since Bh\u016bridatta came here; I feel certain some evil has befallen him.\" So she began to weep, and her heart dried up with grief. She was always gazing on the road expecting to see him come. After a month had expired her eldest son, Sudassana, came to see her, but on account of her grief she said nothing to him. So Sudassana, seeing how different his reception was, said:\n\n65. Mamam disv\u0101na \u0101yantam sabbe k\u0101ma-samiddhinam\n   Indriy\u0101ni abha\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101ni s\u0101vam j\u0101tam mukham tava.\n   \"Me though thou seest approaching, and though thou hast other delights,\n   Thy senses are not overjoyed; overcast and dark is thy face.\"\n\n66.

When they found this\nwas not the case, they fell at her feet weeping. His mother\njoining in their lamentations, went with them up into his\npalace, saying:\n\n75.

Dear Sudassana, if I see not\nmy son Bh\u016bridatta, I shall die this very night,\"\n\nThe Princes answered, \"Dear mother, be not afraid, we\nwill go into the forest, the mountains, the caves, the villages,\ntowns, cities, and everywhere in search of Bh\u016bridatta. You\nshall see him within seven days.\"\n\nSudassana said, \"If we search together, the search will\nbe long; we will separate and search in different directions.\nOne of us will go to the Deva-land, one to Himavanta, and\none to the country of men.\" As K\u0101n\u0101ri\u1e6d\u1e6dha was fierce, he\nthought it best not to send him amongst men, for he might\nreduce everything to ashes; so he said, \"Brother Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha,\ndo you go to Deva-land, and as the Devas are desirous of\nhearing the law, without fail bring him thence.\"\n\n\u00b9 Stanzas 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86 of Faumb\u00f6ll are omitted in the Burmese.\nHe then directed Subhoga to go to Himavanta, saying that he himself would go to the land of men. Then he thought, \"If I go as a youth, men will think nought of me; but if I go as a hermit, they will respect me, for the children of men love hermits.\" Thereupon he took the form of a hermit and took leave of his mother.\n\nNow Bh\u016bridatta had a cousin who was very fond of him, named Ajamukhi. She loved him better than all her other cousins, and seeing Sudassana about to depart, she said, \"Cousin, I am very sad, let me accompany you in your search for Bh\u016bridatta!\" He answered, \"Child, I am going disguised as a hermit, and it will not do for a woman to go with me.\" Then she said, \"I will take the form of a frog and go in your hair-knot.\" On his agreeing to this Ajamukhi took the form of a frog, and stowed herself away in Sudassana's top-knot.\n\nSudassana then caused Bh\u016bridatta's wives to show him the ant hill, and when he saw traces of blood, and the spot where the snake-charmer had woven the cage of cane and bamboo, he said, \"Without doubt my brother has been taken by a snake-charmer, who is ill-treating him.\" So in great sorrow he tracked the bloodstains and footprints until he came to the village where the first performance was held. On questioning the villagers, as to whether any snake-charmer had been there, he was told that one had been there about a month previously. On asking if he had taken any money, they said, \"O yes, he is quite a rich man, for he got about a thousand pieces of silver here.\" So they went on making inquiries until they came to the King's palace. Just at this moment the snake-charmer, who had bathed and dressed himself, had taken up his cage and gone to the gate of the palace, and the people of the city were assembled to see the performance. The snake-charmer spread out a magnificent carpet, placed his cage open upon it, and playing on his drum, cried out, \"Come forth, great\n\n1 Mother's sister's daughter.\n2 The Burmese MSS. have ajjamuhkhi, but the name should be accimukkhi sunbeam face.\nN\u0101ga.\u201d Sudassana, standing in the crowd, saw the serpent-prince raise his head and gaze at the crowd. Now there are two occasions on which N\u0101gas are wont to gaze; first, when they are in fear of Garu\u1e0das: second, when they see a friend.\n\nThe Bodhisat, seeing his brother in the crowd disguised as a hermit, came out of the cage with his eyes streaming with tears, and went straight towards his brother. The people stood aside with fear, but Sudassana kept his place. The serpent, laying his head on Sudassana\u2019s instep, wept. Sudassana also wept. Then Bh\u016bridatta returned to his cage.\u00b9\n\nThe snake-charmer, fearing that the snake had bitten the hermit, came towards him, saying in verse:\n\nAlamp\u0101yano.\n\n87.

Then Sudassana shouted with a loud voice and said, \"Now shall the kingdom of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi be destroyed.\" His shout went through the whole kingdom of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi, even to the distance of twelve yujana.\n\nWhen the King heard it he said, \"O hermit, why wilt thou destroy the kingdom of B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi?\"\n\n\"O King,\" answered Sudassana, \"I see nowhere that this poison may be poured.\"\n\nKing. \"The earth is very wide, Hermit, throw it elsewhere.\"\n\n108.

Then he cast the three drops of poison into the first hole, and instantly flame and smoke burst forth, which caught the cow dung in the middle pit, and then passing to the third pit was extinguished there.\n\nThe snake-charmer was standing near the holes, and the flames taking hold of him, his skin peeled off, so that he became a white leper, on which, in his terror, he cried out thrice, \"I release the N\u0101ga King.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Bh\u016bridatta came forth from his basket, showing his jewelled body, resplendent, like Sakka himself. Sudassana and Ajamukhi also showed themselves in their true forms.\n\nThen said Sudassana, \"R\u0101j\u0101, do you not know us? Know you not whose children we are? Have you forgotten that Samuddaj\u0101, the daughter of the R\u0101j\u0101 of K\u0101si, was given in marriage to Dhattara\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the King of N\u0101gas?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the R\u0101j\u0101, \"she was my sister.\" \"O R\u0101j\u0101, we are her children and you are our uncle.\"\n\nThe King then embraced Sudassana and Bh\u016bridatta, and,\n\n1 pel\u0101.\nhaving taken them into the palace, made them presents, and said, \"Dear Bh\u016bridatta, since you are so powerful, how came you to get into the clutches of this snake-charmer?\"\n\nBh\u016bridatta then told him the whole story.\n\nThen Sudassana said, \"Dear uncle, our mother is in great distress at not hearing any tidings of Bh\u016bridatta; we cannot stay, but must depart.\"\n\nThe King replied, \"Very good, go quickly, but I, too, should like to see my sister. How can it be managed?\"\n\nThen Sudassana asked after his grandfather, and the R\u0101j\u0101 told him that he was so terrified that the day after he had given Samuddaj\u0101 in marriage, he had relinquished his kingdom and become a hermit. Sudassana then told the R\u0101j\u0101 that if he would appoint a day, they would bring their mother to meet him at their grandfather's hermitage. The R\u0101j\u0101 then conducted them on their journey, and they returned to serpent-land.\n\nChapter IV. (Micch\u0101ditthikath\u0101)\u00b9\n\nWhen Bh\u016bridatta returned, the whole country was convulsed with weeping, and he, being much distressed by a month's confinement in the snake-charmer's basket, retired to sleep in his palace. Innumerable numbers of N\u0101gas came to see him, but he was unable to converse with them on account of his weakness. K\u0101n\u0101rit\u1e6dha, who went to Deva-land, and returned home before him, placed a guard at the palace door to prevent the people going to see Bh\u016bridatta.\n\nSubhoga, having searched the whole of the Himavanta, was returning by the Yamun\u0101. Now the Brahman Nes\u0101da, when he saw the snake-charmer become a leper, thought that, as he had coveted the ruby and taken part in the affair, some terrible calamity would overtake him; so he determined to go to the Yamun\u0101 and bathe himself. He therefore went down to the bathing-place\u00b2 and entered the\n\n\u00b9 Micch\u0101ditthi Kath\u0101, heretical discourse.\n\u00b2 Pay\u0101ga tit\u1e6dhe, now Allahabad.\nwater. Just at that moment Subhoga arrived there too, and, hearing Nes\u0101da make his confession, said, \"This is the wretch who, through covetousness for my brother's ruby, not content with the great wealth that he had offered him, pointed him out to the snake-charmer. I will slay the villain.\" So coiling his tail round the Brahman, he dragged him under the water. Being tired, he allowed the Brahman's head to come up, and then dragged him down again. At last the Brahman got his head up, and was able to say:\n\n111. Lokyam si\u00f1cantam udakam payat\u0101smim pati\u1e6d\u1e6dhitam Ko mam ajjhohari bh\u016bto ogalham Yamunam nadim.\n\n\"What demon is this who swallows up me, who have descended into the river Yamun\u0101 and am standing at the bathing-place washing away with water my earthliness?\"\n\nSubhoga answered:\n\n112.

I will try and soften his heart by praising the well-known splendour and tenderness of his parents.\" Then he said,\n\n113.

Then Bh\u016bridatta caused them to turn the Brahman Nes\u0101da out of serpent-land. R\u0101j\u0101 S\u0101gara Brahmadatta, on the appointed day, surrounded by his whole army, went to the place where his father was residing.\n\nBh\u016bridatta caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum throughout the whole of N\u0101ga-land, that he proposed visiting his grandfather and uncle: and going forth from the river Yamun\u0101 with a great retinue and splendour, in due course, he arrived at his grandfather's hermitage. His parents and brethren followed after him.\n\nWhen S\u0101gara Bh\u016bridatta saw the Bodhisat coming with his attendants, he did not recognize him, but said to his father in the following stanzas (185 to 198):\n\n\"O hermit, my father, who, I pray, is this who comes with drums and other musical instruments playing before him? Whose face and crown is it that flashes like lightning? He is young indeed, but his glory flashes forth like gold flowing from the furnace? Who is he? His white umbrella delighteth the heart like Jamb\u016braj gold. Those waving c\u0101m\u0101ris,\u00b9 whose are they? and whose the splendidly jewelled peacock fans?\"\n\nThen his father answered (199), \"Dear son, this is no other than your nephew, the son of Dhatarattha, King of the N\u0101gas: those others are also his men; their power is very great and their hosts are many. They are also the sons of my daughter Samuddaj\u0101.\"\n\n\u00b9 Yak tails.\nWhilst they were thus talking, the company of the N\u0101gas arrived and sat down in a suitable place. Samuddaj\u0101, after doing reverence to her father, returned weeping to N\u0101ga-land. Brahmadatta remained two or three days and then returned to B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi. Samuddaj\u0101 died in N\u0101ga-land, and Bh\u016bridatta continued his fasts for the rest of his life, and when he died he went to Deva-land with all his followers.\n\nThe Teacher then summed up the J\u0101taka as follows:\n\nBh\u016bridatta\u2019s parents were reborn of royal race; the hunter Ne\u015b\u0101da became Devadatta; his son Somadatta became \u0100nanda; Ajamukhi is now Upalavamsa; Sudassena is Sariputtar\u0101; Subhoga is Moggal\u0101na; K\u0101n\u0101rittha became Sunakkhat (Sunakkhatto, a Prince of the Licchavi) and Bh\u016bridatta is myself, the incomparable and omniscient Buddha.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. A REMNANT (?) OF BUDDHISM IN INDIA.\n\nSir,\u2014A somewhat curious addition to the printed literature of Pali has recently come under my notice. This is a tract of 31 pages printed at Chittagong in 1889, consisting of extracts from Pali scriptures with Bengali explanations. The book, entitled \"Buddha-bhajan\u0101,\" is stated in the Bengali preface to be compiled for the \"assistance of our Buddhist community\" (\u0101m\u0101der Bauddha sam\u0101jera upak\u0101r) in those parts. The name of the compiler, Duryodhana Bhikshu, and of others who assisted in the publication of \"the Mah\u0101thero,\" L\u0101lamohana Dh\u0101mm\u0101ch\u0101ri (sic), and Doctor Bhagirathachandra Vaduy\u0101 (\"Borooh\"), have quite a Bengali-Assamese appearance, and do not at all suggest a mere colony of Burmese Buddhists. Still less has the tract the appearance of an emanation of the Neo-Buddhism of Col. Olcott and his friends. It would be interesting, therefore, to know the origin of this \"Bauddha sam\u0101j.\"\n\nThe Pali is of the most extraordinary description. Is it the result of faulty oral tradition or merely of imperfect knowledge on the compiler's part of the character of the alphabet from which he was transcribing into the Bengali character?\n\nThe work begins:\n\nBuddha vandan\u0101.\n\nBuddhap\u0101ttati buddh\u0101tam, buddh\u0101nam\u0101m t\u0101bh\u0101ntisa, bujjh\u0101ti dh\u0101mm\u0101 ul\u0101ram, buddhordi\u00e7am n\u0101m\u0101m\u0101bam.\nA note or rubric follows in Bengali, explaining that this confused jargon of Pali is to be used in making flower-offerings.\n\nThe work consists of headings, written in Bengali, expressing the main topics of Buddhist devotion and meditation, each followed by a passage of curiously corrupted Pali, which is further explained where necessary in Bengali. Special features of this supposed Pali are (1) the prevalent use of \u0101 for \u1e5b\u2014perhaps, as Prof. Rhys Davids has suggested to me, in order to guard against Bengali-speaking Buddhists using the corrupt Bengali pronunciation (=\u014d) of the Sanskrit-Pali \u1e5b; (2) the use of the palatal sibilant (\u015b, \u00e7) not preserved in Pali; (3) the ungrammatical use of n for \u1e5b.\n\nIt will be interesting if any of our readers in Bengal can tell us more of this Buddhist community, and of the literary and manuscript material (if any) on which this curious contribution to Pali literature is founded.\n\nCecil Bendall.\n\nBritish Museum, November, 1891.\n\n2. TSONKHAPA.\n\n8, Upper Woburn Place, London,\nJuly 2nd, 1891.\n\nDear Professor,\u2014In reference to the 'Aphorisms of Tsongkhapa,' about which you enquired, it seems that by this the work called Snags rim (\u0f66\u0fa3\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f72\u0f58\u0f0b) might be intended, which is mentioned in the German translation of T\u0101ran\u0101tha, p. 325, l. 4, and which must have been (and is probably) at the command of Wasilief. Neither it nor any other of the works of this author is in the Tanjur. The title means 'Method of Dh\u0101ra\u1e47i.' Besides the above there are mentioned in Schmidt and B\u00f6htlingk's 'Verzeichniss, etc.' (Bulletin iv.),\nas extant in the Asiatic Museum of the Imperial Academy, also\n\nSub. 435 f. the *Byan chub lam rim* (\u0f56\u0fb1\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f72\u0f58\u0f0b) 'Guide to Bodhi,' which work Wasilief quotes in his 'Buddhismus,' p. 142 (154 Germ.) note.\n\nSub. 433, *A Biography of Tsonkhapa.*\n\nSub. 419, *Ritual for sacrifices to Tsonkhapa.*\n\nWasilief also mentions, Buddh. p. 88 (95), a hymn by Tsonkhapa called Dmigs brtse ma ('Play of fancy'), and an 'Exposition of the Teaching of the Tantras' (p. 190 [208]). Both these would probably be found at St. Petersburg.\n\nThis is all I can find now about Tsonkhapa and his writings. None of the latter are accessible here.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nH.

Obituary Notices.\n\nBishop Caldwell.\u2014The name of Bishop Caldwell, of Tinnevelly, in South India, has been removed by death from the list of our Honorary Members. He was 78 years of age; he went out to India as the member of a Non-conformist body, but he passed into the Church of England, and was for many years Bishop of the Mission of the Society for Propagation of the Gospel. He died at Edyen-goody, the headquarters of his District. He was highly esteemed and beloved by his flock, and some influential Mahometans laid flowers on his coffin as a tribute of respect. He was well known in England, and the compiler of this notice had the pleasure of his friendship.\n\nIt is, however, as the investigator of the South Indian Family of languages that Bishop Caldwell was most widely known. His \u201cComparative Grammar\u201d of the Dravidian Family, originally published in 1856, was a revelation to Western philologers; and it remains, in the form of a second edition (1875), the standard authority on the subject, without a rival or a successor. Dr. Caldwell\u2019s intimate personal acquaintance with the people and their dialects, his patient study of their past, as proved by his \u201cHistory of Tinnevelly\u201d and \u201cThe Tinnevelly Shanars,\u201d and the strong religious convictions, which made pursuits that to another man would have been the relaxations of a busy\n\nJ.H.A.S. 1892.\nlife, with him a serious and unremitting duty, enabled him to accumulate a mass of carefully verified and original materials such as no other European scholar has ever amassed in India. There are points, for example, with reference to the proportion of aboriginal words in the modern Indian vernaculars, in regard to which his conclusions have been modified by subsequent research. But his \"Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South Indian Family of Languages\" will ever stand forth as one of the monumental works of the age. Scarcely less interesting, although on a different scale, were his contributions during many years to the *Indian Antiquary*, and the series of Sanskrit manuscripts which he brought to light in Southern India and rendered available to Western scholarship. But in this, as in every other branch of his untiring labours, he was inspired with the belief, that he was doing true missionary service. The literary work to which he himself looked back with greatest satisfaction was the part which he took during eleven years in the revision of the Tamil Bible, and, when that long labour was ended, in the revision of the Tamil Book of Common Prayer.\n\n*Nov. 16th, 1891.*\n\nR. N. C.\n\n*Raja Rajendra Lala Mitra.*\u2014This distinguished scholar was descended from an ancient stock, the Kulin Kayastha, who rank in Bengal next after the Brahmins. For upwards of forty years he had contributed to the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society papers of much interest\u2014in all 114. The following may be mentioned:\u2014\"On Some Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian Relics from Rawul Pindi\" (1862); \"On Greek Art in India,\" and \"On Leprosy in Ancient India\" (1875); \"On the Representation of Foreigners in the Ajanta Frescoes\" (1878); and various papers on human sacrifices, the use of spirituous drinks, the consumption of beef, and other customs among the ancient people of India. Another branch of antiquarian research to which Dr. Mitra devoted much attention was the elucidation of inscriptions (whether on stone or copper) and of ancient coins, and his numerous\nnotes and treatises on these possess great historical value. His more important works were:\u2014\"Buddha Gaya, the Hermitage of Sakya Muni,\" a handsome monograph on that great temple; \"The Antiquities of Orissa,\" in two volumes, a work which was the outcome of an arch\u00e6ological mission to Bhuvanesvara, whither Dr. Mitra was despatched by Government in 1868-69; \"The Indo-Aryans,\" produced in 1881; and \"The Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal,\" in 1882. Dr. Mitra was often consulted by the Government in regard to antiquarian and literary matters, and he was created a Companion of the Indian Empire in 1878. He was also a Fellow of Calcutta University, and he was an Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society. He rendered an essential service to Indian learning by striking out new paths and new methods of research, based upon the examination of ancient local remains. The wisdom of the orthodox Brahmins was in a large measure a wisdom of words. Dr. Mitra practically proved to his countrymen that scholarship deals also with things. His erudition in Sanskrit literature and philosophy would have sufficed to win for him a high place as a pandit of the old order, and it secured for him, in spite of his new departures, the respect of that order. But his main work was the investigation of the actual and material relics of the past, rather than of its science and metaphysics. Educated half a century ago in one of the then few private seminaries in Calcutta conducted by Hindus on Western lines, yet independent of missionary influences, Rajendra Lala Mitra entered life as a young Hindu of the clever worldly type, with an abundant stock of knowledge, and quite willing to push his fortunes by means of it. Having distinguished himself in the Medical College, he was selected as one of the four students who were to be sent to Europe. But his family, from caste-reasons, objected, and he was diverted from the medical profession. He then began a scholar's career, and was appointed Assistant Secretary and Librarian of the Bengal Asiatic Society. Before he had reached middle life he had mastered, in addition to English and the Vernaculars of\nIn Sanskrit, Persian, and Latin, with a working facility in French, German, and Greek.\n\nWhen the Bengal Government determined to provide more seriously for the education of State wards, or orphan landholders and nobles placed by law under its care, Rajendra Lala Mitra was appointed director of the Court of Wards' College in Calcutta. In this congenial position he passed many years, branching out into various forms of public activity, as a municipal commissioner of Calcutta, active in temper and caustic of speech, as an active member of the governing body of the University, and as a wise and honoured leader of the Native Landholders' Association in Bengal.\n\nThe labours by which he will be remembered, however, were of a different class. In the maturity of his knowledge he formed the design of bringing the mass of writings about ancient and medi\u00e6val India to the touchstone of the existing material remains. He explored step by step the sacred sites of the Hindus in Bengal and Orissa, gaining admission as a pandit to their innermost recesses, and producing, with the aid of the skilled draughtsmen and photography of the Surveyor General's Office in Calcutta, a useful record of their now fading inscriptions and crumbling temples and gods. His \"History of the Antiquities of Orissa\" would alone have raised him to a very high rank among native scholars, second only to those who, like Bhagvan Lal Indraj\u00ee, had acquired the methods of historical criticism. But that work forms only one of fifty-five separate publications which issued from his unwearied pen in English, Sanskrit, or Bengali. As will be seen from the list of those of his works in our Library, he edited an important Buddhist text, the Lalita Vistara, and translated a few pages of it, and began to edit the Praj\u00f1\u0101 P\u0101ramit\u0101, another of the standard books of the Nepalese Buddhists. These works, though by no means perfect, were the fruit of much labour; they have made the general contents of these books accessible to scholars, and will have prepared the way for the future\neditor of critical editions. Scarcely less important was the search for ancient Sanskrit manuscripts, which he conducted under the auspices of the Government throughout Bengal, from the Himalayas to the sea, a task undertaken just in time to rescue many invaluable documents, and to secure a vast treasure-trove from antiquity.\n\nNov. 16th, 1891. R. N. C.\n\nProfessor Paul Hunfalvy.\u2014Dr. Paul Hunfalvy was born at Nagy Szalok in the county of Szepes in Upper Hungary, on the 12th of March, 1810. His father, a simple agriculturist, could afford to give his son no better education than that obtainable at the village school. The family name was Hunsdorfer, which being Magyarized, was also adopted by the younger brother John, the famous Hungarian geographer. Whilst at the village school young Paul\u2019s intelligence and industry attracted the attention of the Pastor, who lent him books to read, and when the Pastor found with what diligence and earnestness the young lad continued his studies, he endeavoured to procure means of assisting him to higher schools; a boon which was not in the power of the poor father to give. Admitted to the Lyceum of K\u00e9smark, Paul\u2019s exemplary conduct gave great satisfaction to his masters. The holidays he spent at home and employed his time in reading the Bible and books on Geography; the deep religious feelings which characterized the man in after-life took root at this early age in the parental home.\n\nFour years were spent at the Lyceum, during which his progress in classics was conspicuous. Whilst there he was a most assiduous visitor at the large library, where he endeavoured to learn more than the powers of his age would allow. From K\u00e9smark he went for two years to the Lutheran School at Miskolcz, where he studied especially Hungarian and ancient classics.\n\nMoreover, he learnt as much logic, history, and other sciences as was required by the curriculum. \u201cAs I was journeying homewards from Miskolcz,\u201d says Hunfalvy in\nhis \"Reminiscences,\" \"and caught sight of the landscape of my native country with its snow-clad Carpathian peaks, my eyes filled with tears of joy. The world I thought was beautiful indeed, but one's home is the most beautiful of all.\" He returned to the Lyceum and studied the higher branches of Philosophy and Law, which, together with philology, fully occupied his time. He now began seriously to meditate on the fact that the road to real knowledge was long and arduous, poverty was staring him in the face, which made success very dubious. He refers probably to this period of his life when he writes, \"I hardly know what good fortune means. As far as I can form any judgment on the subject by other people's thoughts, I cannot consider myself fortunate. The world looks up to family connection, splendour, wealth and competence as such\u2014none of these advantages fell to my lot. Yet I was happy, I passed my early years in contentment, I enjoyed the splendid rays of the sun as they spread their warmth, no melancholy thought ever entered my mind, I never suffered hunger and the nights passed in refreshing sleep; later on I found comfort in the school, it seemed at first as if poverty had conspired to deny me that blessing. I began to contemplate the problems of human destiny, and my happiness would have been complete if doubts regarding the value of human knowledge had not disturbed my contemplations.\"\n\nThis seems to have given young Hunfalvy the first impulse towards individual research leading to the solid results of scientific attainments which he left behind him.\n\nWhen he had finished all his studies at the Lyceum he supported himself by teaching, and after some years of hard struggle was offered the tutorship to the sons of Baron Podmaniczky at Budapest. This gave him the opportunity of being enrolled as a law student at the High Court of Judicature, and after passing examinations Hunfalvy was admitted an Advocate. Yet he never practised as a lawyer, but rather devoted himself to literature, and in company with such distinguished literary men as Toldy, Bajza,\nand V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, he contributed to the volumes of the Hungarian Athen\u00e6um. In this publication appeared his first works, namely: the \"Drezdai levelek,\" Letters from Dresden; \"Eml\u00e9kez\u00e9s K\u00e9sm\u00e1rkra,\" Reminiscences of K\u00e9smark; \"Rhapsodi\u00e1k,\" and \"Thukydides,\" which, together with three other Essays, were subsequently published in a separate volume under the title of \"Tanulm\u00e1nyok,\" L\u0151cse, 1873. These essays do not possess any special elegance of style or beauty of composition, but their contents bear witness to the work of a thoughtful mind, extensive reading, critical acumen and sound judgment.\n\nIn 1871 Hunfalvy was elected corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and a year later a similar distinction was offered him by the Literary Society the \"Kisfaludy T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g.\" At this period his tastes had not as yet shown a definite tendency. He wrote articles in political and scientific publications, he translated the fables of Lokm\u00e1n from the Arabic, and was conversant with Hebrew. He took his seat at the Academy by a Dissertation on \"Thukydides,\" and at the Kisfaludy T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g on the \"Poetry of Aristotle.\" It was surmised at the time that classics were the field which he had marked out for his future labours, although just then French romance and national lyric poetry commenced to attract public attention in Hungary.\n\nIn 1842 Hunfalvy obtained the offer of the Professorship of Law at his old Lyceum, which he accepted with great satisfaction, and published his work on \"Commercial Legislation.\" For six years he occupied the chair, during which his fame spread far and wide; students from distant parts of the kingdom came to attend his lectures, who admired not merely his clear and attractive teaching, but they loved him as a man. The poet Pet\u0151fi paid Hunfalvy a visit in 1845, and speaks of his great popularity with his numerous pupils.\n\nIn 1847 he visited several countries on the continent, and published a work on matters concerning education\u2014the \"Tanodai Sz\u00f3zat.\" Hunfalvy's name now became known.\nIn 1848 he was elected to Parliament to fill one of the seats for his native county. At the beginning of 1849, when the Austrian Field-Marshal, Windischgr\u00e4tz, was nearing the capital, Hunfalvy, with the rest of the Parliament, followed Kossuth to Debreczin, and remained at his post till its final dissolution in August, 1849, at Szegedin. He belonged to the Peace party, and frequently spoke out in the public press on that side. He opposed the deposition of the Habsburg dynasty, and consequently the Declaration of 14th of April, which he characterized as a grave mistake. Yet, notwithstanding his moderate views, he suffered persecution and imprisonment from the Austrians. On being released, he took up his quarters permanently at Budapest, and resumed his literary pursuits; he was appointed Librarian to the Academy, which post he held till his death. Works and essays on various literary and scientific subjects issued from his pen. In 1857 he edited a \"Library of Hellenic Classics,\" and published one volume of \"Translations from Plato.\"\n\nFrom this time forward he devoted himself, however, more thoroughly to philology, having entered on a path of research which afterwards he made his own. He was the first who, since R\u00e9vai, resumed the study of comparative Magyar philology, and thus became the founder of a school whose merits were soon universally acknowledged.\n\nOn the 18th January, 1851, he pointed out to the Academy of Sciences the direction in which Hungarian philology should go, if it desired to attain results worthy of philological science. In the study of Altaic languages, he thought Hungary should take the lead, and thus become an acknowledged factor in the scientific world.\n\nWith full conviction, and with all the resources of knowledge he possessed, Hunfalvy fought against the errors of his adversaries, and proclaimed the principles which should guide comparative philology, enumerating the problems which have to be solved. Concerning the Altaic languages, he endeavoured to establish the link which unites the Turk, Finn, and Magyar languages, and after studying the philo-\n\n---\n\n1 See Journal Royal Asiatic Society, July, 1889, p. 647.\nlogical treasures which Anton Reguly\\(^1\\) brought home from his travels in the Ural region, he brought the Finn dialects and the Mordvin and the Cheremiss languages within the sphere of his researches, leading him to the conviction that the Magyar tongue occupies a mid place between the Finn and the Turk, and stands in near relationship to the Mordvin and Vogul-ostjak languages. In these studies Hunfalvy found a faithful co-worker in Joseph Budenz, with whose aid he subsequently laid down those solid foundations of the comparative philology of the Ugor languages, which he and others should build upon. This was done in the publication called \"Magyar Nyelv\u00e9szeti\" (Magyar philology), and in the \"Nyelvtudom\u00e1nyi K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek\" Philological transactions, the latter of which he edited till 1878.\n\nThe publications issued by Hunfalvy contained, not only papers on Ugor comparative philology, but also communications on the Altaic, Indo-Germanic, and Semitic languages, and there are also found essays on ethnographic and mythological subjects, because he was convinced that comparative philology cannot show satisfactory results in any other way than by paying attention to the ethnographic and mythological peculiarities of different nations. When Reguly returned home from his northern travels, with philological and ethnographic treasures, his health was broken by the hardships and long privations he had endured, and from which he never recovered. On his death, at the early age of 39 years, the task of working up his literary remains devolved, at the special request of the Academy, on Hunfalvy. Bearing on this subject he published several treatises, the most important of which were the following:\n\n\"The Vogul Story of the Creation of the World,\" in original, with translation and a dictionary, in 1859; this was the first work ever published in Europe on the Vogul people.\n\n\"Chrestomathia Finnica,\" Finn Olvasm\u00e1nyok, in 1861.\n\n\"A Vogul F\u00f6ld \u00e9s n\u00e9pe,\" the land of the Vogul and its people, in 1864, containing, in a well-digested form, all the results of Reguly's travels.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Journal Royal Asiatic Society, July, 1889, p. 614.\nHunfalvy determined to study the life and languages of the peoples related to the Magyar race, and to base upon such data the principles of Magyar philology, which determination he pursued with unflagging industry and enthusiasm, ready to give battle to those who ventured to attack the result of his researches. Up till quite lately Hunfalvy had to fight hard in support of his theory that the Magyar tongue was cognate to the Finn-Ugor group of languages, and not to the Turco-Tatar, as was maintained by Vamb\u00e9ry. But just because he was ever ready for the fight, and continued it without intermission, he was able gradually to secure pupils and associates to his school.\n\nIn furtherance of his researches Hunfalvy travelled in the Baltic provinces and in Finland in 1869, the result of which was a work in two volumes, published in 1871, under the title of \"Utaza's a Balti vid\u00e9ken,\" a journey in the Baltic Provinces. When at Dorpat, he discovered the Gospel of Matthew translated into South Vogul dialect. Based on this, he wrote a treatise on the Konda Vogul Language in 1872, which was soon followed by another on North Ostjak Language, \"az \u00e9jszaki osztj\u00e1k nyelv,\" based on Reguly's literary remains. These works established Hunfalvy's reputation as a philological authority.\n\nIn his later years, he paid particular attention to Ethnography. In 1876 was published his \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g Ethnographi\u00e1ja,\" Ethnography of Hungary, an important work relating to history, language and racial differences of the various nationalities inhabiting Hungary, with regard to whom he advanced several striking and new propositions, supported by clearly defined arguments. Two of his conclusions especially raised heated discussion and originated a copious literature. The first of these was the question whether the \"Sz\u00e9kler\" of Transylvania were the descendants of Attila's warriors or not? The long and bitter controversy which followed, produced a work in 1870, \"A Sz\u00e9kelyek,\" the Sz\u00e9kler and several articles on the same subject in the periodical called \"Sz\u00e1zadok\" from Hunfalvy's pen.\n\nThe second obscure problem of Ethnography was connected\nwith the origin of the Rumun (Roumanian, Wallach) nation. In endeavouring to throw light upon this subject, Hunfalvy gave great offence to the national pride of the Roumanians, because he ventured positively to question the theory that the Wallachs, as the Roumanians of to-day were till quite recently called, could claim the Roman Legions stationed in Dacia as their ancestors. The first and probably most important Monograph on the subject was published in Vienna, 1883, under the title \"Die Rum\u00e4nen und ihre Anspr\u00fcche,\" The Roumanians and their Pretensions (1883), followed by \"Neuere Erscheinungen der rum\u00e4nischen Geschichtsforschung,\" New Phases of Roumanian Historical Researches (Vienna, 1886); \"Der Nationale Kampf gegen das Ungarische Staatsrecht,\" The Struggle of the Roumanians against the Hungarian Public Law (1880); \"Hogyan cain\u00e1l\u00f3dik n\u00e9mely historia? Pillant\u00e1sok a rumun t\u00f6rt\u00e9netir\u00e1sba,\" How some History is being fabricated. Glimpses into the rumun History (1885); \"A rumun nyelv,\" The Rumun Tongue (Budapest, 1878) and numerous articles in the periodicals \"Literarische Berichte aus Ungarn\" and \"Ungarische Revue.\" The crown of Hunfalvy's researches on this subject was expected to be a great historical work on the Rumun people which Hunfalvy brought down as far as the middle of the fourteenth century, and on which he worked on the day preceding his death. Another ethnographic work of great merit was published in Vienna and Teschen in 1881, \"Die Ungern oder Magyaren,\" and the Transactions of the Hungarian Ethnographic Society bear the impress of his scientific interest. In the Transactions of the Hungarian Academy, and in the Proceedings of various scientific Congresses, he attended, of which that of the Orientalists at Stockholm, in 1889, was the last, there appeared many articles and essays from him. Five years ago he was nominated a life member to the House of Magnates, and when the bill for making the study of Greek optional in the colleges instead of being compulsory as in the past, was brought in, Hunfalvy spoke out with the fervour of youth against the innovation. He was Doctor of Philosophy, Professor at the University\nof Budapest, an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences and corresponding member of many foreign scientific societies.\n\nHunfalvy\u2019s death came unexpectedly, although he was in his 82nd year, and complained of late that his strength and power of work were not the same as of old; the last two summers he spent in his native county of Szepes, at T\u00e1traf\u00fcred on the southern slopes of the Carpathians. When the academical season re-opened this year, it being the fiftieth anniversary of his connexion with the Academy, congratulations poured upon him from private friends and public bodies, not the least amongst whom was a deputation from the Academy itself, with the President, Baron E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, at its head. On the 24th of November he presided over his section at the Academy, and on the 28th received the congratulations of the Ethnographic Society, of which he was the President. In returning his thanks for the honour done to him, he spoke of the first Hungarian philologist R\u00e9vai, and pointed out, as if with a presentiment of his approaching end, that should he close his eyes there would be those who could continue the work he was engaged in. \u201cIf I may,\u201d he says, \u201cbe permitted to compare my humbleness to a thing really grand, I might venture to predict that, as after John the Baptist, so after me will come much mightier men than I, who will follow in the direction I have pointed out.\u201d He was the President of the Luther Society, one of the revisors of the Hungarian Bible, and a prominent supporter of the Evangelical church.\n\nReturning home from the meeting of ethnographers, he begged to be excused attending the public dinner which was to follow, as he felt fatigued. The next day, Sunday, the 29th November, he rose in his usual health, took his customary walk, and spent the afternoon over his work on the Roumanians; he went early to bed without the slightest complaint. About four o\u2019clock in the morning, his wife awoke and heard a gentle snore; she lit the candle and saw after a few deep gasps, her husband peacefully pass away. It was Monday, the 30th of November.\nHunfalvy's body lay in state in the Palace of the Academy of Sciences, from whence it was conveyed to its last resting-place in the afternoon of the 2nd of December, amidst every manifestation of public sympathy and regret, an honour he so well deserved.\n\n15th December, 1891.\n\nTHEODORE DUKA.\n\nMr. Rehatsek.\u2014The Bombay Gazette of Dec. 19th says:\u2014A most unusual event took place at Worli on Friday, when a European was, by a desire expressed in his will, cremated in Hindu fashion. The man was Mr. Edward Rehatsek, well known in Bombay as being possessed of extraordinary learning, a first-rate Arabic and Persian scholar, a great linguist, and of remarkable literary ability, though, since he retired from the Latin and Mathematics Professor's chair at Wilson College twenty years ago, he has led a strange life, living all alone, and welcoming no Europeans to his place of abode. Edward Rehatsek was an Austro-Hungarian by birth, and was born on July 3, 1819, at Illack. He was educated at Buda-Pesth, at which University he studied and took the degree of M.C.E. in the year 1843. After that he made a tour through Europe, spending a few months in Paris, then four years in the United States of America, and afterwards came to Bombay in 1847, when he settled down as Professor of Latin and Mathematics at Wilson College. He was also a Fellow of the Bombay University, and for twelve years was examiner in Arabic, Persian, Latin, and French. Even then he led a quiet life, seeking more the society of natives, among whom he laboured, than his European brethren; but when he retired from his professorship in 1871, his what might be termed almost hermit life began. He dwelt in a small bungalow at Khetwadi, kept no servants, went every morning to bazaar and purchased his provisions, which he cooked by his own hand. His meals were of the most frugal description, and his dress was most threadbare. He always went out for a short time morning and evening, and lately he took to cycling. It was a strange sight to see this old man, over seventy years\nof age, moving slowly along the Queen's Road night and morning on his tricycle; but, though old, he enjoyed the best of health till within a few months of his death, when he was seized with an internal inflammation, from which he died yesterday morning at half-past six o'clock.\n\nThough he had retired from his regular pursuit, it must not be imagined he was an idle man by any means. He laboured continually at his desk, chiefly translating foreign works into English, and many interesting and valuable contributions came from his pen. Most of his works were published at his own expense, for living so frugally as he did since he came to Bombay, he amassed a considerable sum of money, which he did not grudge spending on any hobby, or in giving the fruits of his study to the world with which he cared so little to mingle. Among his more prominent works were \"Historical Sketch of Portuguese-India, with a List of its Officers till 1881,\" \"The Alexander Myth of the Persians,\" \"Gastronomical Anecdotes of the Earlier Kaliphs,\" \"Life of Jesus according to the Mohammedans,\" \"The Relations of Islam to Christianity, and of Christianity to Civilization,\" \"Bombay 115 Years Ago,\" in five volumes, \"The Diamond Fields of India,\" in two volumes. There are many other valuable works of the late Mr. Rehatsek now published, but the list is too long to give in detail. The above, however, will suffice to show how great a student of literature he was, and how deeply he must have dipped into research to write so many books on such a variety of subjects.\n\nHis last work was a heavy task, namely, the translating into English of Mirkhond's \"History of the World\" from Persian into English. It is being printed and published by the Royal Asiatic Society, and the last volume, completed a short time before his death, is now in the press, and will soon be issued.\n\nOccasionally he would leave his recluse life and come before the public, to lay before them personally the fruits of his research, and many will remember when, before the Bombay Anthropological Society, he lectured on \"Veneration\nfor the Dead in China,\" and \"Hindu Civilization in the Far East,\" and again recently when he read an interesting and instructive paper on \"Statistics of Suicides in Bombay since 1886.\" To the Anglo-Vernacular journal, Native Opinion, he was for many years a constant contributor, never missing a week without sending in an article in English. Even when laid up with the malady that proved fatal to him, he would not lay aside his pen, and only five days ago, when Mr. Hari Madhay Paranjpe, the editor of Native Opinion, who was one of Mr. Rehatsek's closest friends, called upon him, the poor old man, too feeble to speak, signed to his desk where lay, just completed, the last contribution that came from his pen. Mr. Rehatsek also took a great interest in Theosophy, and was in constant correspondence with Theosophical Societies in Europe. Much as he kept himself to himself, he did not want for attention from friends after he was seized with his last illness, and three doctors\u2014namely, Dr. Deshmuck, Dr. Kunte, and Dr. John De Cunha, all former pupils of his, ministered to him. By his death-bed yesterday morning were Mr. Hari Paranjpe and two other friends, and also two servants who had been left there by Dr. De Cunha to attend to the dying man. When a professor he was much beloved by his students, and they remained his friends to the last. What money he had remaining to him was not much, but he made a will leaving it all to local charities and to be spent in prizes for primary education schools in Bombay. In his will there was also a clause which was the cause of yesterday's strange proceedings, instructing his executor, Mr. Narayen V. Mandlik, to cremate his body in Hindu fashion, and that was carried out yesterday, at the Municipal burning-ground at Worli.\n\nAt four o'clock the deceased, Mr. Rehatsek's friends, all Hindus, with the exception of Dr. De Cunha, and nearly all former pupils of the late professor, assembled at his bungalow at Khetwadi, where the corpse had, native fashion, been laid out, face exposed, on a bier, profusely decorated with flowers. A procession was formed, the corpse-bearers\ngoing in front and the carriages with the mourners following. Worli was reached about 5.15, and the body was immediately carried to that part set aside for deceased persons having no relatives. The still smouldering embers whereon a body had been burned that afternoon were swept aside; fresh wood was piled up, and the body was placed thereon; lights were applied, and in about two hours, the remains of Mr. Edward Rehateek, the first European ever cremated in Bombay in native-fashion, were reduced to ashes.\n\nSir James Redhouse.\u2014It is our painful duty to record the death of Sir James Redhouse, K.C.M.G. He joined this Society in 1854. He succeeded Mr. Norris as Secretary in 1861, and resigned that post in 1864, being succeeded by Dr. Reinhold Rost. He was elected Honorary Member in 1886. He contributed to our Journal no less than twelve interesting papers\u2014a complete list of which will be found in the Index to the Society\u2019s publications published in our Journal for the year 1888.\n\nSir James Redhouse was born in 1811; was educated at Christ\u2019s Hospital, and went to Constantinople in 1826, where he was employed by the Ottoman Government in the preparation of various military, naval, and literary works. In 1830 he visited Russia. Having begun soon afterwards the preparation of a Turkish, English, and French dictionary, he returned to London in 1834 to take steps for its publication, which was rendered useless, however, by the appearance of Bianchi\u2019s Turkish-French work. In 1838 he was appointed a member of the Translations Office of the Porte, and in 1840 was transferred to the Turkish Admiralty; from 1839 until 1853 he acted as confidential medium of communication between the Porte and the British Ambassador. In 1840 he went on a mission to the coast of Syria, then blockaded by the allied squadrons of England, Turkey, and Austria, where he was engaged in communications between the admirals and the Turkish Commander-in-Chief on shore. After other services he assisted to conclude in 1847 a treaty of peace between Persia and Turkey; and in 1854 he was appointed\nOriental Translator to the Foreign Office. In 1857 Mr. Redhouse was sent to Paris to assist in the wording of the text of the treaty of peace with Persia, which set the British troops free to aid in the suppression of the Indian mutiny. Sir James Redhouse, who was knighted in 1888, was a member of several Turkish, Persian, and other Orders. In 1884 Cambridge granted him the honorary degree of LL.D. Among his works may be mentioned an English-Turkish and Turkish-English dictionary, a manual of colloquial Turkish for use in the Crimean war, a *grammaire raisonn\u00e9e de la langue Ottomane* published in Paris, and an incomplete manuscript dictionary of Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Eastern Turkish, and English in ten large folio volumes.\n\nHe was in many respects the leading authority on the Osmanli-Turki language: to the other members of the great Turki linguistic family he had not paid much attention. He very naturally regarded the world from the Constantinople point of view, and did not hesitate to claim for the Tartar Sovereigns of that country the Kaliphat of Islam, a claim which the great Mahometan Emperors of India, whose ancestor, Tamerlane, had carried about Bajazet, the ancestor of the Sultans of Turkey, in an iron cage, laughed to scorn, and in no Mosque of India was prayer ever offered for him as the Kaliph of the Faithful.\n\nIt was a pleasure to visit year by year Sir James in his retreat at Kilburn, and converse with the great scholar: the sight of the great volumes of the great Dictionary of the Osmanli-Turki on the desks round his writing table impressed one more with the grandeur than the prudence of the undertaking. Every word of the Arabic, Persian, and pure Turki languages had been incorporated alphabetically, but, when it came to publication, at the request of the American Board of Foreign Missions, who have extensive Educational Agencies in Turkey, a selection had to be made of a much more moderate size. The National Library of the British Museum has secured these folios, which will ever remain as monuments of his industry and knowledge.\n\nJan. 7, 1892. R. N. C.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nIII.

Each of the hundred moral verses of which it consists is followed by a pada-gata-sannaya, or word for word commentary, in the Sinhalese language. There is another copy in Europe, at Copenhagen, wrongly described by Westergaard (Cat. p. 21) as Vy\u0101sa-\u015bataka. An English translation of forty-four out of the hundred verses is published by Philalethes in his \"History of Ceylon,\" pp. 308 to 314. There is no copy of this work among the sixty-three Sanskrit MSS. in the Kandy Library (none of which are noticed in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum), though a list of them was printed in the Pali Text Society's Journal, 1882, p. 45. It would seem also to be wanting in Colombo (see ibid. p. 58). The date and author of the little work are entirely unknown.\n\nThe Burmese Government has started a series of open competitive examinations in Pali.

It bears on it an inscription in Valabhi Gupta characters, *Si Bhatakadatti* (possibly the name of the owner), and an engraving of a *V\u0113\u1e47id\u0101vana*, or raised enclosed bed of the *Tulasi* or Basil plant. The latter sign, and the existence of the *\u015aankha*, may indicate Vishnu worship in old Amreli, as both the \u015aankha and Tulasi are now sacred to that deity. An old Phallus of Siva had previously been found near the same spot. An inscription in the temple of N\u0101ga N\u0101tha Mah\u0101deva at Amreli mentions the find of that Phallus. We know of Siva worship there in the Valabhi period from the published Valabhi grants. There are remains near by of what is probably a Buddhist st\u016bpa, and the name Amaravalli (Amreli) would recall Buddhist associations, as its other name Gr\u012bv\u0101\u1e47a-valli would recall Brahminic associations. Popular tradition gives a third name to it, viz. Kanak\u0101vati. Not far from it are the ruins of another old town T\u0101mr\u0101-vat\u012b. Old Kshattrapa, Gupta, and Indo-Sassanian coins are found in large numbers about these parts.\u2014H. H. D.\nPr\u0101china K\u0101vy\u0101 M\u0101l\u0101.\u2014H. H. the Gaikv\u0101d of Baroda, a member of this Society, has sanctioned Rs. 12,000 for the publication of poems of some of the Gujarati poets that flourished in his domains. Some eighteen numbers of the series are out up to date, containing poems of great merit of Kavi Prem\u0101nanda, his son Vallabha, Kavi Bh\u0101la\u1e47a, Kavi Day\u0101r\u0101m (the Byem of Gujarat), and Ratne\u015bvara among others. The researches of the zealous editors of the series, among them R. B. Hargovinddas Dvarkadas, Director of Vernacular Instruction, point to the arrangement made by Kavi Prem\u0101nanda with his son and disciples who formed a large band to enrich the language of Gujarat by dividing the work among them. Some were to write verses on the model of Sanskrit, others on that of the old Prakrits, some on that of Hindustani, and others of the Urdu tales and traditions. This was so in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. H. H. is also said to have sanctioned a large sum, Rs. 50,000, for Marathi and Gujarati popular school series. A large illustrated Gujarati Dictionary is said to be under contemplation. The works of Narsimha Mehta, said to be the Chaucer of Gujarat, are intended to be similarly published by the Junaghad Durbar. A young poet is moving among other Kattyaw\u0101\u1e0di States for getting the works of other Kattyaw\u0101\u1e0di poets collected and published. The energetic editor of an Aryo-Gujarati bi-weekly, of Bombay, has issued over four large volumes of old Gujarati Poets, Br\u012bhatk\u0101vy\u0101 Lokana.\u2014H. H. D.\n\nConstable\u2019s \u201cOriental Miscellany.\u201d\u2014We beg to call the special attention of our readers to this new venture under an old and honoured name, the details of which will be found in our advertisement pages. It is a good sign of the times that publishers, whose estimate of things monetary is not often over-sanguine, should find it pay to publish books on Oriental subjects, and we trust that Mr. Constable will receive sufficient support to encourage him in producing works of real and permanent historical value.\n\nHarvard Oriental Series.\u2014This series is to be devoted to texts, translations, and other works concerning India, its\nhistory, religions, languages, literature, and antiquities. The aim is to supply what has been urgently needed, well-selected, and well-edited texts, easy in style, of interesting contents, and not too long, suitable, in a word, for the acquisition of facility in reading, and which can be sold at a low price. The series is to include not only works of use to advanced scholars, but also books suited to the needs of younger students. Volume I., which is already out, is the text of \"The J\u0101taka-m\u0101l\u0101,\" by Arya\u00e7\u016bra, edited by Professor Kern (royal 8vo. cloth, pp. xii. and 254, price 6s.). Volume II. will be the text of \"Kapila's Aphorisms of the S\u0101\u1e45khya Philosophy,\" with the Commentary of Vij\u00f1\u0101na-bhik\u1e63u; edited, in the original Sanskrit, by Richard Garbe, Professor in the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia. This text and commentary were published about thirty-five years ago by Fitzedward Hall, but are now out of print. The new edition is in handsome English letters. A translation into German by Professor Garbe was published by the German Oriental Society in 1889. Volume III., in preparation, is on \"Buddha and Buddhism,\" as illustrated by English translations from the Buddhist Scriptures in P\u0101li, by Henry Clarke Warren, Esq., of Cambridge, Mass. This will be a series of selections made in such a way as to give a systematic exposition of the subject according to the views of the native authorities and the canonical books of Buddhism. The whole is, we are glad to see, under the editorship of Prof. Lanman, whose name is a sufficient guarantee for the scholarly character of any work that may be chosen for publication.\n\nBuddha Gaya.\u2014A few days ago there arrived at Colombo a Japanese monk sent from Tokio to Ceylon on a special mission to inquire into the \"Buddha-Gaya Mission\" founded in Colombo to acquire some lands on the site, at Buddha-Gaya in India, where Gotama Buddha preached his doctrines, and to consecrate them to the service of all Buddhists. Mr. Dharmapala, the Secretary of the Mission, who is away in India now, has already purchased the lands; and he is now making arrangements to build a monastery there. Japanese and Siamese Buddhists have been appealed to for help, and\nthe arrival of the \"Jap\" to make inquiries on the subject is the result of the appeal. The Buddha-Gaya mission has succeeded in securing the site of the Bo-tree at Gaya, where Gotama Buddha attained Buddhahood. The Sinhalese monks who have gone there to take charge of the place are making rapid progress in learning the vernaculars of Bengal, and they will shortly commence the work of the propaganda. A deputation of Sinhalese, Japanese, Siamese, and Burmese Buddhists will wait on H. E. the Governor-General on his visit to Gaya about the middle of October.\n\nSince the above was written we learn from the \"Calcutta Englishman\" that there has been a meeting of the Committees arranging this matter at Buddha Gay\u0101 itself. There were present the following delegates:\u2014Japan, Ato Tokuzawa; Ceylon, Dharmapala; the Secretary of the Budgya Society, Gunaratana Bhikshu; China, Tochiya Lama; Chittagong, Girish Chandra Dewan and Krishna Chandra Chowdri. Letters promising support were received from Prince Chandradat on behalf of the Siamese Buddhists, and Moung Shoung on behalf of the Burmese Buddhists. Letters were also read from Sir Edwin Arnold, Baron Harden Hickey, and the Australian Buddhists. Resolutions were passed calling for subscriptions from Buddhist countries for erecting a monastery and founding a Buddhist college. The meeting closed by thanking the Government of India for repairing the temple and the Indian press for the sympathy shown.\n\nDr. Bezold.\u2014The Trustees of the British Museum will shortly issue the second instalment of Dr. Bezold's \"Catalogue of the Cuneiform Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection.\" This volume will contain the descriptions of nearly six thousand tablets and fragments which formed part of the famous clay library preserved by the Kings of Assyria at Nineveh. This library was founded by Assurbanipal B.C. 668\u2013626, and contained official documents which had been sent to Sargon and Sennacherib by the generals of the army and others; as well as a series of works relating to every branch of science known to the Assyrians, and copies of\nancient classical books and legends from Babylonia. In this volume will be found a classification of omen and astrological texts, a work which has never before been attempted; and a considerable number of important extracts are printed in the Cuneiform characters.\u2014Athen\u00e6um, 30th Nov. 1891.\n\nEtruscan.\u2014Prof. Krall, of Vienna, in examining the bands of a mummy, probably of the age of the Ptolemies, which for the last forty years has been preserved in a museum, has found a strip of linen with several hundred lines of Etruscan writing. In this text, which is the longest we possess in that language, some words occur that are to be found in Etruscan inscriptions known to us, but the whole cannot in the actual state of Etruscan studies be deciphered. The cloth was, no doubt, written on for some purpose before being carried by ship to Egypt and there used for the wrappings of a mummy. The publication of the text by the learned discoverer is awaited with the keenest interest.\n\nEgyptian Antiquities.\u2014Messrs. Newberry and Fraser have already left England for their second season in Egypt, and will be followed somewhat later by Mr. Blackden. Their work for this winter will be to survey, copy, and photograph the remaining historic antiquities from Beni-Hasan tombs, the tombs of el-Bersheh (XIIth Dynasty), the Speos Artemidos, and the tombs at Isbeleh. It should be added that this archaeological survey is supported by special subscription.\n\nThe Egyptian Government has asked the Caisse de la Dette for \u00a350,000 from the general reserve fund on behalf of the Antiquities' Department, but, before granting so large a sum, the Caisse will probably require the appointment of a commission to study the purposes of its employment. It is hoped that this opportunity will be availed of to make a searching investigation into the management of the department generally, which has for a long time excited dissatisfaction amongst all nationalities, and is discreditable to the country. The Ghizeh Museum especially is without a catalogue, its exhibits are unlabelled, and its immense\nquantities of valuable objects are stored away from public view to the utter disappointment of visitors who desire to do more than merely pass an idle hour in the building. The monuments scattered throughout the country are inefficiently protected, and much irreparable mischief has been and still is caused by theft and wantonness.\u2014Academy, 5 Dec., 1891.\n\nProf. Maurice Bloomfield, of Johns Hopkins, has published in the fifteenth volume of the \"Journal of the American Oriental Society\" a third series of \"Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda,\" continuing his former method of interpreting the early mantras by help of the later literature\u2014Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, S\u016btras, commentaries, and classical legenda. He first deals at considerable length with the story of Indra and Namuci, which he makes intelligible by piecing together many scattered allusions. Perhaps the most novel feature in this re-constructed story is the scene where Namuci (the \u0101sura) makes Indra (the deva) drunk with sur\u0101 (brandy) instead of his own favourite soma. Secondly, he takes up the two dogs of Yama, and shows how identification with the sun and the moon in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as explains many of the conflicting attributes assigned to them in the Vedic mantras. Lastly, he discusses the much-disputed passage (Rig-veda, x. 17, 1, 2), which describes the conjugal exploits of Saranyu, his explanation being that it is a Brahm\u0101dya (riddle or charade), not, as has hitherto been held, either a fragment or a story in a form so condensed as to be foreign to Indian habits of narration. As the basis of the riddle he finds a cosmogonic conception with which a number of mythological inventions have been combined to make up a story of a composite character.\n\nDr. de Cara has published a paper under the title \"Della Identita degli Hethei e dei Pelasgi dimostrata per la Ceramica pre-fenica e pre-ellenica\" (Rome: Befani). The work shows an acquaintance with the most recent results of Oriental and archaeological research, and the views expressed in it are novel and suggestive. The author seeks\nto show that the Pelasgians of Greek tradition represent the Hittites of Asia Minor and Syria, and that the culture of Mykan\u00e6 had its ultimate origin in the Hittite empire.\n\nThe Oriental School at Berlin.\u2014The official catalogue (Verzeichniss) of the teachers and students of the Berlin Seminar f\u00fcr Orientalische Sprachen, for the term October 15th, 1891, to March 15th, 1892, has appeared. The teaching body seems to have undergone some changes. In the first place, the Lector in South Chinese is An Fung Tsch\u00fc, whose name does not occur in the Verzeichniss for 1890. Next, Dr. Moritz is entered, not only as librarian, but as teacher of Arabic, while the dialect of Morocco is taught by Muhammad Bin Selham, a name also new. Another new teacher is the Lector in Suaheli, Amir bin Nasir Lomeri. The number of hearers is 118, against 132 in the early part of the year. The non-official courses are attended by 33 hearers.\n\nThe B\u0101bis.\u2014A Russian artillery lieutenant, Alexander Toumansky, having gone to Ashkabad with the object of visiting the B\u0101bi colony there, has returned to St. Petersburg with many notes, photographs, and manuscripts. Several of the latter are described in the last issue of the 'Collections scientifiques de l\u2019institut des langues orientales' at St. Petersburg (Part 2 for 1891). The same volume contains the complete text of some other B\u0101bi works which form part of a volume of B\u0101bi tracts lately presented to the library of the Institute. The description of these new treasures commences with a warm eulogium of Mr. Browne\u2019s articles in our \u2018Journal\u2019 for 1890.\n\nThe Rig-Veda.\u2014The first volume of Prof. Max M\u00fcller\u2019s translation of the Rig-Veda, which has been so long looked forward to by scholars, has at last appeared just as we are going to press. It contains the translation into English, with a very elaborate commentary, of the forty-nine hymns to the Maruts, including nine not addressed specially to them, but dealing with allied subjects.\n\nLahore Museum.\u2014The new buildings for this important local museum are nearly completed, and will be shortly\nopened, to the great benefit of those who visit the collections there arranged under the able superintendence of Mr. Kipling, senior.\n\nIV. Notices of Books.\n\nThe Dinkard, Vol VI. By Peshotan Dastur Behramjee Sanjana. (Published under the patronage of the Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhai Translation Fund, Bombay, 1891.)\n\nWith this sixth volume of the Text and Translations of the Dinkard the learned high-priest of the Bombay Parsis completes seven-tenths of the third book, or nearly one-third of the whole work so far as it is still extant. The first two books appear to have become separated from the other seven more than 870 years ago, when the latter were copied from a manuscript found in Baghdad; and no trace of the former two books has yet been discovered.\n\nThe Dinkard is an extensive summary of information regarding the Mazda-worshipping religion, its legendary history, and its sacred books, compiled chiefly from writings no longer extant, and written in the Pahlavi language. This compilation was commenced by \u0100t\u016br-farnbag, son of Farukhzad, who was supreme high-priest in Ir\u0101n early in the ninth century; and it was revised and completed, more than half a century later, by \u0100t\u016brp\u0101d, son of H\u0113m\u0113d, one of his successors. Nearly the whole of its third book is quoted from the Nik\u0113s\u014d-i V\u0113h-d\u012bn\u014d, or Exposition of the Good Religion, which was probably the name of some important treatise on religious matters; but it also contains some answers to sceptical inquiries, and several series of admonitions issued by celebrated religious men and their opponents, which may be derived from other sources.\n\nIn preparing his edition of this Pahlavi work Dast\u016br Dr. Peshotan has had to provide not only for European scholars, but also for his own countrymen. He publishes the original Pahlavi text required by both parties, with an English\ntranslation for Europeans, and a P\u0101zand transliteration, a Gujarati translation, and a Glossary of a few of the Pahlavi words for his own countrymen. His last two volumes contain a marked improvement, as compared with the preceding four, owing to the English translation being no longer a mere translation of the Gujarati, but being made direct from the Pahlavi, though still following the general course of interpretation adopted by the editor in his Gujarati version. This improvement has been carried out by the editor's son with great success, considering the difficulty of the task.\n\nThere is always much uncertainty in the reading of unusual Pahlavi names, and the best translators will often be led astray in such cases by the ambiguity of the Pahlavi characters. It has already been shown by Darmesteter (in *Textes Pehlvis relatifs au Judaisme*, p. 3) that the name of the high-priest which is read D\u0101y\u016bn by Peshotan, in his chaps. 197, 198, ought to be read Sh\u0113n\u014d, he being the Sa\u0113na of Yt. xiii. 97, in the Avesta. And another correction of a similar character may now be suggested with regard to the name Asrit\u0113 which is coupled with that of H\u014dshang in chap. 209, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 11, and should doubtless be read V\u0101\u0113ger\u0113d\u014d (the first letter being supplied, in two cases out of three, from the preceding word m\u016bn, which ought to be min), as it appears from Sachau's Albir\u016bn\u012b's *Chronology of Ancient Nations*, pp. 206, 212, that Vaikard was the twin brother of H\u014dshang and superintended the agriculture of the realm.\u00b9 His name occurs again in the fifth, seventh, and eighth books of the Dinkard, but has not been preserved in the extant Avesta.\n\nIn chap. 229, \u00a7 5, h\u016b\u0101frit is not a name, but merely a title of the S\u0101s\u0101nians, which is also used in Book VIII. chap. xiii. 17. The passage in chap. 229 would be better translated as follows: \"The good government by sagacity as an administrator (?) among those of the race of Yim, after Fr\u0113d\u016bn, was first through the descendants of M\u0101n\u016bshch\u012bhar,\n\n\u00b9 I am indebted to Prof. Darmesteter for calling my attention to this statement, in correction of my translation of Dinkard VIII. xiii. 6, in *The Sacred Books of the East*, vol. 37.\nsecondly through the Kay\u0101nians, and thirdly through the well-created (or the fully-blessed) that are descended from the same Kay\u0101nians, who are the S\u0101s\u0101nians that are also so called.\"\n\nSimilarly, in chap. 274, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, br\u0101tr\u016bt is not a name, but should be read br\u0101dgareat \"brotherly, fraternal, akin;\" and the passage can be translated as follows: \"Virtuous action is that which is due to the diligence that is free from the avarice which is akin to diligence. And honest comfort is that due to contentment preserved from the indolence akin to discontent.\" It has been suggested that br\u0101dgareat generally means \"brotherly\" in an Oriental sense which would be better expressed in English by \"inimical\"; but this passage does not support that view.\n\nIt must certainly be admitted that the third book of the Dinkard is the most difficult part of the whole work, and probably the portion least interesting to scholars who are not Parsi theologians. The next three books contain some passages that may be more entertaining. But the last three books, which comprise much legendary history and a summary account of the Nasks as they existed in S\u0101s\u0101nian times, are likely to be far more generally interesting, especially the seventh book. If the Trustees of the Sir J. J. Translation Fund could manage to expedite the publication of the Pahlavi text, by postponing that of the translations and other accompaniments, they would be conferring a favour upon European Pahlavi scholars generally, who look forward to their next fifteen years of waiting for the completion of the publication, at its present rate of progress, with some degree of impatience.\n\nE. W. West.\n\nThe Dwarfs of Mount Atlas.\n\nMr. Haliburton, Q.C., has published a brochure (David Nutt) giving a detailed statement of the evidence in his possession as to the existence of a race of dwarfs (with an average height of less than 4\u00bd feet) in the district subjoined\nto Morocco immediately south of the Atlas range. It is made perfectly clear that a number of natives of Morocco believe in the existence of such a race, and that Europeans in North Morocco have seen dwarfs there who are believed to belong to such a tribe, and not to be isolated cases of arrested development or of atavism. The strongest evidence is that of a donkey-man in Tangier, 4\u00bd feet high, the son by a Moorish woman of one of the Akka dwarfs. He told Mr. Haliburton that his father, brothers and sisters were smaller than himself, and entirely confirmed the hearsay evidence (of those who had told the author or his informants about the dwarfs) as to the existence in Akka of a pigmy race. We understand from the brochure that Mr. Haliburton's conclusions have been controverted; but he does not state where; and it is difficult to see what negative evidence, except that of a trained observer who had been at the places indicated and found no pigmies, could be of much value against the carefully authenticated inquiries set out in this little book. Mr. Haliburton deserves the thanks of historical students for the trouble he has taken in the matter.\n\nThe statement of evidence as to the existence of this particular pigmy race is followed by seven pages of rather desultory remarks on dwarfs and dwarf-worship. It is suggested that nearly all the earliest myths of Greece came from the Atlas pygmies,\u2014either direct, or through Crete, to which island they had emigrated, and it is confidently stated that \"Probably on both sides of the Atlantic the ancient dwellings cut in cliffs were made by dwarfs.\" These propositions would be sufficient to overthrow the beliefs at present held among scholars as to the Greek myths on the one hand, and the cave-dwellers on the other. If the author would produce in support of them evidence as substantial as that set out in the earlier part of the pamphlet, he would find that serious scholars would not be prevented by the revolutionary air of his theses from giving to them a respectful attention.\nLectures on the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages. From the papers of the late William Wright, LL.D., Professor of Arabic in the University of Cambridge. (Cambridge, at the University Press, 1890, pp. 288.)\n\nIf we overcome the feeling of sadness that the author of the above-mentioned work is no more, nothing but pleasure is in store for the reader of these lectures which he has bequeathed to the students of Semitic philology. It is particularly lamentable that he was not spared to take into consideration the two latest works in this province which claim to do away with so many views hitherto sustained, and the ingenuity of which has opened up quite a new field of investigation. Like the foregoing works Wright's book extends over the whole realm of the Semitic dialects, but it omits entirely any theory concerning the formation of the nouns as well as the usual classification of their forms. The author has probably deemed it to be beyond his task, and declined consequently to give his young hearers a system, the deficiency of which was evidently too manifest to him. But on the other hand he does not give the slightest reason for this omission, nor does he intimate the existence of any other theory, with the exception of some remarks at the beginning of the chapter on the verb. The lectures thus extend over the Phonology and all the rest of the Morphology. It is surely an unsurpassable masterpiece to treat of so vast a subject in less than 300 pages. Yet the diction is transparent and clear, nay almost popular\u2014as the lectures were meant for undergraduates\u2014even though every word is written with the utmost care. The unhappy circumstance that the author was prevented by death from putting the finishing touch to his book was fully made up by its being edited, prefaced and annotated by Professor W. Robertson Smith, whilst Professor Th. N\u00f6ldeke read the proofs and added notes and corrections.\n\nThe introductory chapters are devoted to a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the latest investigations concerning the cradle of the Semitic\npeoples, which the author, in common with Sayce, Schrader, and de Goeje, considers to have been in the South, and also to a survey of the single Semitic dialects.\n\nTo these general remarks I should like to attach a few details which include one or two unimportant suggestions. Referring to the chapter of the pronouns the author agrees with all other grammarians, that the demonstrative pronouns \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 and \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d0 are a combination of \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 resp. \u05e0\u05d0 with the article. It seems peculiar that no other Semitic language has this combination, whilst some place the demonstrative element \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 before the pronoun \u05e0\u05d0. On the other hand no Semitic language, nor even the Ph\u0153nician, puts the article before the pron. demonstr. and \u05de\u05b5\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4 1. 3, neither. The treatment of \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 and \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d0 as adjectives is after all only owing to external formation and is frequently omitted also in Hebrew (see the instances given in Gesenius-Kautzsch. Hebr. Gramm. 24th ed. p. 289, to which are to be added Deut. xxi. 20, Jos. ii. 14, 20.) We should thus expect that the \u05e0\u05d0 before \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d0 and \u05e0\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d0 (with Dagesh following) should properly be not the article as such, but also a demonstrative prefix which was originally \u05e0\u05d0, but was gradually treated as analogous to the article by sharpening the syllable and Dagesh following. The Ph\u0153nician form \u05e0\u05d0 which Wright disunites from \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d0, may yet perhaps have corresponded to it, and have been pronounced 'adda with the \u05e0\u05d0 dropped, just as the Vulgar-Arabic adda; as to \u05e0\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d0 and \u05e0\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d0 cp. the Vulg. Arab. ah\u00f3 and ah\u00f3m [Wr. p. 107, Spitta, G.A.V. p. 76]. Whether cases as \u05e0\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d0, Gen. xviii. 32, \u05e0\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d0 in the signification to-day, Jer. xxviii. 16, had originally the same \u05e0\u05d0 or the real article is more difficult to decide. But with respect to the last instance we may quote the Bedouin \u0647\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0647 which N\u00f6ldeke [Wright, p. 115, note 1] dissolves in \u0647\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0647.\n\n1 Cp. Gesen.-K. ibid. p. 102.\nAs to the relative pronoun \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4 Wright, mentioning the view which connects it with Aram. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4, inclines to acknowledge the other theory of Ewald-B\u00f6ttcher that it is compounded rather of \u05dc\u05b6\u05d0 + a prosthetic, but with the modification that its origin is to be sought for in the region of the demonstrative pronoun. The fundamental element seems to be the demonstr. \u05d0 (Hommel, Z.D.M.G. 32, 708) which in Ph\u0153nician, with the prosthetic or rather likewise demonstrative \u05d0, was pronounced \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4 a\u0161 or a\u0161e (Wr. p. 119, cp. Ges.-K. p. 102). Such a word, however, being impossible in Hebrew, the second syllable was closed by a liquid or guttural r which originally did not belong to the root, the addition of which may yet have been supported by the tendency to triliterality (see the examples with \u05d0 added at the end in Olshausen\u2019s Gramm. \u00a7 216c.). The liquid character of this \u05d0 is particularly visible in the forms \u05d0 [with Dagesh following] and \u05dc which represent the archaic form and are used preferentially in poetic passages, but were supplanted gradually by the fuller form \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4.\n\nWith reference to \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9\u05d4\u05b6\u05dd [p. 85, cp. Olshausen, \u00a7 202b.] the author mentions the Syriac \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4. Also Levy in his Dictionary to the Targums gives to the \u2018Ayn a Patah. In two rather old Yemen MSS. belonging to the Montefiore College Library, cod. Montef. 501 [Haft\u0101r\u014dth] and 506 [part of the Pent.] both with Targum and written with the Babylonian system of vowels, I find always \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4 with Qamez.\n\nAs to the chapter of the nouns, the author confines his\n\n---\n\n1 The use of \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4 as relative pronoun in poetic speech shows the close relationship between it and \u05d0resp. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4, cp. Aethiop. za, Aram. \u05d0cp. Gesen.-K. ibid. p. 308.\n\n2 Probably on account of an erroneous derivation from \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4. Buxtorf\u2019s Concordantiae have the word under this root.\nremarks to the gender and the attaching of the suffixes. Only\u2014as said above\u2014at the introduction to the chapter of the verb he accentuates the close relationship which prevails between this and the noun. With Stade he confesses to have long believed that the verbal forms of the Semitic languages are really nominal forms, mostly in combination with pronouns. The question concerning the precedence of *nomen* or *verbum* has been lately raised with much vigour through Lagarde and Barth. Wright's view coincides in so far with that of Barth, as the latter, although he does not seem inclined to give a decided answer, for the nouns derived from the *Perfect-stem*, ascribes the precedence to the noun, but not for the nouns derived from the *Imperfect-stem*. This view is most likely influenced by the circumstance that the *imperfect* includes principally future actions which cannot be conceived and expressed otherwise than through a verbal idea [Wr. p. 179], whilst completed actions can easily be comprehended as something existing, or a nominal idea. This, however, is by no means sufficient to help us in dealing with the above question, which will perhaps hardly be satisfactorily answered, owing to our most scant knowledge of the development of the elements of human culture.\n\nIn treating of the verb Wright starts from the three fundamental forms *qatal*, *qatil*, *qatul*, which by doubling one of the consonants or lengthening a vowel developed into the other forms. By lengthening the first vowel, he says, arose the form *q\u0101tal*, which by changing the vowel of the second syllable into *i* became indistinguishable from the hightening of *qatil* into *q\u0101til*. Apparently Wright does not share fully the view hitherto generally held that the participle active was developed from an older form *g\u0101tal*, but says expressly [p. 197] that the form *q\u0101til* may be explained in one of two ways, the second of which is the hightening of the first syllable of *qatil* into *q\u0101til*, thus corroborating the view so strongly advocated by Barth [*Nominalbildung*, p. 200, and Z.D.M.G. 44, 685]. Yet Wright, on the other hand, admits\u2014what Barth emphatically denies\u2014the existence of\nforms *fa'al*, viz. \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc, Arab. \u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644, and \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc = \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc: As to \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc we may quote the longer form \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc [Gen. xxxviii. 25], which may fairly be subjected to the rule expounded by Barth, Z.D.M.G. ibid. 606. Perhaps \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc had originally also an *i*-sound in the second syllable, and is only a transformation of \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc.\n\nAccording to the theory of deriving the verbal forms from an original noun Wright regards the 3rd pers. pl. perf. to be *qataluna*, in opposition to N\u00f6ldeke [Z.D.M.G. 38, 411], who declares it to be only ending in *u*, the *n* being affixed later on. Wright seems to have thought that the *n* belonged to the ending of the plural in primitive Semitic, which however does not entirely agree with his own opinion concerning the formation of the plural of the noun by lengthening the vowel-ending of the singular, viz. into *u*. The addition of the *n* is here hardly sufficiently explained; on the other hand, examples quoted by him from Assyrian [p. 147] *malki*, *umi*, *pagri*, etc., seem to strengthen the idea of the plural as having been formed without *n*. With this N\u00f6ldeke's ending of the plural *u* coincides very well. The same is to be said concerning the ending 3rd pers. pl. f. which Wright traces as *qatalana* against N\u00f6ldeke-Hoffman *qatala*. Wright himself takes at this place notice of his disagreement with the opinions of these scholars.\n\nThe same is again repeated where Wright denotes the oldest form of the 3rd p. imp. to be *una*. To this much the same may be applicable as to the perfect. The ending of the 2nd pers. sing. m. perf. is regarded by N\u00f6ldeke as being *ta*, by Wright however *ta*, whilst the lengthening, according to his view, was brought forward by the weight of the accent.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\nCATALOGUS CATALOGORUM. BY THEODOR AUFRECHT.\n(Leipzig, Brockhaus.)\n\nThis is an alphabetical list of all Sanskrit books and their authors mentioned in accessible printed catalogues of MSS. of the Brahmin literature. It does not mention editions; nor such works as have been edited, but do not appear in the lists of MSS.; nor any Indian works, whether Sanskrit or not, which are not written from the Brahman standpoint. But it does include the names of books and authors quoted in the Catalogues under other books or authors. The Catalogues of MSS. thus inedited, fifty-six in number, are set out in the preface, and include all that the author could procure. The result is a stately volume of nearly 800 pages 4to., which will be a standard work of reference for all interested in the history of thought in India, and which reflects the greatest credit on the careful industry and exact scholarship of its distinguished author. No one will be surprised to learn that this colossal work has been thirty years in preparation. But the labour and scholarship involved could scarcely have been better employed. For we have here the first step, and a most substantial one, towards that 'Dictionary of Indian Literature,' which shall do for Indianists what Murray's series of dictionaries has done for the classical student. It has been necessary, of course, in order to bring the index within any reasonable limits, to omit all detailed descriptions either of books or authors. The plan adopted is exceedingly simple and clear. Each book is mentioned in its alphabetical place with a reference to the name of the author (whenever known) and to the names and authors of commentaries upon it, and usually with a single word, or a word or two, descriptive of the subject treated. Each author is given, also in the same alphabetical order, with a complete list of the titles of his works, and the names of his teachers or pupils, his father or sons, and his date, whenever such details are known. The work is published by the German Asiatic Society, and has received a substantial subvention from the Indian Government.\nARABIC LITERATURE.\n\nHistoria virorum doctorum Andalusiae ab Aben Alfaradhi scripta, ad fidem codicis Tunicensis ed. Francisco Codera. T. i. Matriti, Typ. Guirnalda. This publication forms the 7th volume of the Bibliotheca Arabico-hispana.\n\nA volume of notes and indices by D. H. M\u00fcller has now appeared; it forms the second part of his edition of Ab-Hamd\u0101ni's Geography of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAmong the recent publications of Croux, Paris, we may mention a Chrestomathie magr\u00e9bine, Recueil de textes arabes in\u00e9dits, avec vocabulaires, by O.

Father Torrend, S.J., of the Jesuit Mission on the Zambesi. This is a large and important volume, compiled\non the model of the great Comparative Grammar of the Arian languages, but comprising a very much larger number of languages, the knowledge of which has been revealed to us during the last twenty years by the Grammars, Dictionaries and Texts prepared by Missionaries in South Africa. No doubt there are many points, which will require consideration, as our knowledge extends, but under any circumstances this is an epoch-making book. (Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, & Co.)\n\nII. Grammar of the Nyanja language on Lake Nyassa, by the Rev. George Henry, Medical Missionary of the Free Church of Scotland. This is a most satisfactory book. (Frazer, Aberdeen.)\n\nIII. Hymns by the same author in the same language.\n\nIV. Angola Proverbs in the Mbundu or Banda language of the West Coast of Africa within the Portuguese Colony: the translations are in the Portuguese language, and the book is interesting as compiled by an educated Native. (Lisbon.)\n\nV. Notes on the Tamb\u00faka language spoken on the West Coast of Lake Nyassa, by Dr. Elmslie, Medical Missionary of the Free Church of Scotland. This is a most useful book. (Frazer, Aberdeen.)\n\nVI. Table of Concords, and Paradigm of Verb in the same language, by the same author. (Frazer, Aberdeen.)\n\nVII. A few linguistic notes and Table of Concords and Paradigm of Verb in the Ngoni form of speech, a dialect of the Zulu language, spoken on the West Coast of Lake Nyassa: for this also we are indebted to Dr. Elmslie. (Frazer, Aberdeen.)\n\nVIII. Afrikanische Petrefakten, a Study of the Grammatical Features, and Mutual Relation of African languages, in the German language, by Professor A. W. Schleicher (Berlin). We particularly welcome this book, as indicating that the attention of German linguistic scholars is beginning to be turned to the wonderful new material brought to light by honest, though untrained, British labourers in a virgin field.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\nI have heard in the Shitswa language spoken in the\nvicinity of Mombasa in East Africa, near Lorenzo Marquez.\nIt is stated annually in this Journal a list of the translations\nmade by the British Bible Society; but we are indebted\nfor this translation to the American Bible Society. It may\ntherefore be understood how exceedingly important are\nthese texts, made by capable men in the Field, to be\nbrought into immediate use, and severe criticism by the\npeople who speak that language, when used in the schools\nand chapels.\n\nDecember 31st, 1891.

V.\u2014The Book of the Apple, ascribed to Aristotle. Edited in Persian and English by D. S. Margoliouth.\n\nA pseudo-Aristotelian treatise called *de pomo et morte incliti principis philosophorum Aristotelis* has been printed several times in Europe, the earliest editions being without place or date.\\(^1\\) This work is a Latin translation of a Hebrew tract bearing the name \"The Book of the Apple,\" the translator being Manfred, King of Sicily (ob. 1266), or, as Steinschneider suggests,\\(^2\\) a Jew employed by him. The Hebrew text professes to be a translation from the Arabic made by R. Abraham B. Hisdai, an author who flourished at the end of the thirteenth century. There are MSS. of B. Hisdai's work in the Vatican and at Oxford, and it has been repeatedly printed, first at Venice, 1519.\\(^3\\) It was republished with a new Latin translation and a copious but irrelevant commentary by J. J. Losius, at Giessen, in 1706.\\(^4\\) A German translation was issued by J. Musen at Lemberg, 1873, and an English translation by Kalischer at New York, 1885. An edition with a brief Hebrew commentary is said to have been produced by J. Lichtstein (Grodno, 1799).\n\n\\(^1\\) Hoffmann, *Bibliographisches Lexicon*, i. 347. Fabricius, *Bibl.

It would have been as reasonable to argue from it that the author was a Muhammadan, for the Qor'an is quoted there, although the quotation is concealed in Losius' edition by a gross mistranslation.\\(^3\\) The original work as represented by the Persian bears no trace of a Jewish origin.\n\nIt is not probable that the book ever existed in Greek: not only is there no vestige of any mistranslation of a Greek text, but also many of the phrases which cannot be banished from the argument show the influence of the Qor'an; such are \u062b\u0648\u0627\u0628 and \u0639\u0642\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0649, \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0631\u0629. The expression \"to mortify oneself before death\" seems borrowed from a tradition of the Prophet. On the other hand, the author must have possessed some acquaintance with Greek works. The passage in which Kriton warns Aristotle against making himself warm by talking is borrowed from the Phaedo of Plato (p. 63 d, e). From the same dialogue comes the discussion upon suicide (p. 62). The saying attributed to \"Hermes,\" and quoted from Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" (?), is not unlike the opinion of Empedocles explained in that work. The names Simmias and Kriton are borrowed from the Phaedo; Zeno and Diogenes from some history of philosophy; the source of Pindar and Lysias is less obvious. A Greek writer, choosing names for the interlocutors in a dialogue, would probably have chosen those of real disciples of Aristotle. In this respect Musen's text, which gives Aristoxenus as an interlocutor, is an improvement.\n\n\\(^1\\) So especially Losius, *l.c.*; Carmoly, *Revue Orientale*, iii. 49 (Brussels, 1843).\n\n\\(^2\\) Fabricius, *l.c.*\n\n\\(^3\\) \\(\\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9}\\) what is called 'Uz\u0101 in the Qor'an is rendered by him excellentior bovium. Musen's text is corrupt.\nThe author's purpose is philosophical, not religious. The last stage in the argument proves that philosophy is revealed through a chain of prophets, of whom the first was Hermes, who obtained his knowledge from the angels. Since the pseudo-Sabaeans of Harran regarded Hermes as the founder of their religion,\u00b9 and adopted the neo-Platonic idea of angel-mediators,\u00b2 and since some of the most distinguished of the Arabic philosophers and translators of Greek philosophy emanated from this sect,\u00b3 it may be suggested that one of these Sabaeans was the author of our treatise.\n\nMany philosophical problems are discussed in the dialogue, but the various conclusions are ingeniously dovetailed into the leading argument, which may be briefly analyzed as follows:\n\nThe world of things is to be divided into knowledge and ignorance, and that to which they lead. Knowledge embraces both subject and object; the relation of the intelligent soul to philosophy being illustrated by that of the eye to the sunlight; while the relation of knowledge to virtue\u2014all virtues being reducible to one\u2014is similar to that of ice to water. Ignorance embraces all that is opposed to knowledge: this is, in the first place, the body and its passions; in the second place, the whole material world. If it be argued that the passions belong to the soul and not the body, since they disappear with the soul from the body, we answer, that they are an accidental result of the union. That they are not a necessary property of the soul is shown by the fact that the souls of the true philosophers are free from them. The existence of a result\u2014i.e. a future world in which knowledge and ignorance are requited\u2014is proved mainly by an argumentum ad hominem. Knowledge is incompatible with the enjoyment of the pleasures of this world, which are a hindrance to it. Yet the philosopher must pursue knowledge with some object\u2014he who doubts this is asked why he doubts, if not for some object; and\n\n\u00b9 Chwolsohn, die Sabier, passim.\n\u00b2 Zeller, die Philosophie der Griechen, iii. 2. 420, etc.\n\u00b3 Chwolsohn, l.c. bk. i. c. xii.\nsince that object is not to be realized in this world, it must be realized in another. That the future world will be like this in respect of the division into knowledge and ignorance may be argued from the analogy of the present. That knowledge and ignorance there will be respectively assigned to knowledge and ignorance is proved by reductio ad absurdum.\n\nIf, therefore, the future world is like this in respect of the division, since knowledge constitutes the happiness of the soul, and the power of acquiring knowledge increases as the bodily humours diminish, when finally freed from those humours the soul will have an unlimited power of acquiring knowledge and become perfectly happy. To the question why in that case suicide should not be committed, the answer of Socrates in the Phaedo must be given.\n\nAlthough the dialogue is not free from obvious fallacy and self-contradiction, its ingenuity is no less apparent than the elegance of the Persian translator's style.\n\nOf this argument the Hebrew translator has misunderstood or omitted almost every step, substituting for it much foreign matter, chiefly consisting in commonplaces of medi\u00e6val scholasticism about the three souls, the four principles, etc., and some legends embodied in the Qor\u2019au. On the other hand, his answer to the question why suicide is not commendable is more original: any one who had reached the eminence of Abraham would be justified in perpetrating that act; but the ordinary philosopher needs time in which to perfect himself. The same reason is assigned by the commentators on the Qor\u2019an for the precept \"slay not yourselves.\"\u00b9\n\nThe title, \"Book of the Apple,\" has been adopted from the quotations in Ikhw\u0101n ul-\u1e62af\u0101 and the Uri MS.; I have not ventured to translate it into Persian. The Hebrew translator evidently thought the Apple was not given sufficient prominence in the dialogue, and endeavoured to\n\n\u00b9 A characteristic interpolation is that in which the contents of the Book of the Soul are described in accordance with the Hebrew \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd \u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dc, edited by L\u00f6wenthal.\nsupply this defect. Vague conjectures about this \"Apple\" are made by Losius in his notes; Fabricius in his Bibliotheca gives some more useful information.\n\nThe Persian text has been re-collated with the MS. (which is almost entirely without diacritic points, and in a difficult hand) and the translation revised by Mr. J. T. Platts, teacher of Persian in the University of Oxford, who, however, is not responsible for any errors that may remain. The editor begs to tender him sincerest thanks for his kindness, and also to the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society for allowing this work to appear in their Journal.\n\nRemarks on the Arabic version of the Metaphysics of Theophrastus.\n\nThe MS. from which this text has been copied (Ouseley 95) bearing the title \"Translations from Greek Philosophers,\" among others, contains a variety of interesting matter, which has been catalogued by Dr. Eth\u00e9 with his ordinary thoroughness.1 Perhaps the only tract in the Miscellany which can properly be called a translation of a Greek philosophical work is No. xvi., consisting of four torn leaves which originally contained an Arabic translation of the fragment of Theophrastus ordinarily known as his Metaphysics. We learn from Wenrich's authorities that Yahya ibn Adi (ob. 363 A.H.=973 A.D.) rendered this treatise into Arabic from Syriac; the present translation is probably by him, though it might seem to have come directly from the Greek. Although the MS. is perfect at the commencement\u2014for the obverse page is blank\u2014the copy from which it was made must have contained more; for the present MS. commences in the middle of a sentence, viz. at the word \u1f10\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1, p. 410, l. 15, ed.

For in these things the statement as it were sways to two sides, when they are stated absolutely, and when they are stated individually. I mean by the absolute statement, that nature in everything desires the better, and that she, wherever possible, bestows order and persistence. The same is the case with . . . and animals. For where it is possible . . . she does not fail in any single place. An example of that is how the throat is placed in front of the \u0153sophagus . . and likewise there is placed . . . The desire follows the same course; only it appears that what does not obey it nor accept the better matter is abundant, nay, it is far more abundant than what does accept it. For that which is possessed of soul is of small number, whereas what has no soul is innumerable and comes quicker into existence than what has a soul, and is better in existence. And in general the good is little and in few things; and the bad large in number. And the fact that this only exceeds limit is like what is in the nature of the extremity of folly. For those who talked of substance as a whole like Speusippus made the honourable in the middle place small and rare, whereas the extremes on either side of the middle are according to them as they should be. Plato and the Pythagoreans however carried the matter very far in what they held.\u201d\n\nIt is to be regretted that the passage breaks off here.\nThe following readings would seem to be of some interest (cf.

\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0626\u06cc\nThis is the translation of a discourse which Aristotle delivered at the time of his death. It is said that when the life of the sage Aristotle approached its end, some of his disciples came to see him. When they saw the emaciation of his frame, and his weakness, and perceived about him the signs of death, they despaired of his life; only the joy, alacrity, and clearness of intellect that they perceived in him showed them that he took a different view of his condition from that which was taken by others. Then one of the disciples said to him: Our grief over you is greater than your grief over yourself, and we are more vexed than you concerning your departure; if it be that you feel otherwise than we feel about you, tell us also of this.\u2014Aristotle said: The joy that you perceive in me does not arise from my cherishing any desire for life, but from my confidence about my condition after death.\u2014A disciple named Simmias said: If you have this confidence, it were better that you should explain the ground of it to us also, that we may be as certain as you.\u2014Aristotle said: Although it is difficult for me to talk, still for your sake I will endure some trouble: but first let me hear Kriton, for I can see that he wishes to say something.\u2014Kriton said: Although I should much like to hear your conversation, and acquire knowledge thereby, O teacher of mankind, the physician whom you employ commanded me not to induce you to talk, on the ground that talking would make you warm, and should the heat get the better of you the cure would be delayed, and the effect of the drugs impeded.\u2014Aristotle said: I will disobey\nthe advice of the physician, and will employ no drug but\nthe scent of an apple; which will keep me alive till I have\ngiven you the lecture to which you have a right. Why\nshould I not speak, when the best thing I hope to obtain\nfrom the drugs is the power to speak? Come now, tell\nme, Do you grant the excellence of wisdom or not? They\nanswered: Our only reason for honouring wisdom is the\nfact that we know it to excel other things.\u2014Aristotle\nsaid: Is its excellence in this world or in the next?\u2014They\nsaid: We do not deny the excellence of wisdom, and\nnecessity forces us to place its excellence and value in the\nnext world. Aristotle: Then why do you abhor death\nand adhere to the notion that some detriment will accrue\nto you therefrom, when you ought to perceive that death,\nhorrible as it is to the vulgar, is nevertheless nothing but\nthe freeing of the soul from its bodily case?\u2014Disc.: How\nso? Let us know more.\u2014Aristotle: Does the knowledge\nwhich you have acquired make you glad or not? And\ndoes the knowledge which has escaped you make you sorry\nor not?\u2014Disc.: The former is true in both cases.\u2014\nAristotle: Through which then do you acquire knowledge\n\u2014through the body, which is a blind, deaf, impotent, and\nuseless mass when the spirit departs from it, or by the spirit\nwhereby a man is continually rendered capable of learning,\nseeing, knowing and speaking, so long as it is with him?\u2014\nDisc.: Doubtless through the vitality and goodness of the\nspirit knowledge is acquired, and by the dullness of the body\nit is kept out of it.\u2014Aristotle: Since then it is clear that\nknowledge is a product of the spirit, and that the dullness\nof the body keeps it out, and that by the acquisition of\nknowledge you become glad, whereas by being precluded\nfrom it you become sorry, evidently you must prefer the\nseparation of the spirit from the body to the persistence of\nthe spirit in the body; and separation from the body must\nbe better for the spirit than abiding in the body. Do you not\nsee that the desires and delights of the body such as women\nand children and wealth and eating and drinking still more\nimpede the search after wisdom? and that when you abandon\nthose lusts you do so in order to protect the intellect and to devote yourselves to knowledge?\u2014Disc.: Certainly.\u2014Aristotle.\u2014Then, since you confess that lusts have the power to damage the intellect, surely the body which enjoys those lusts must be more detrimental to the intellect?\u2014Disc.: Our judgment forces us to agree with what your discourse has proved thus far; but what shall we do and how shall we act, in order to become as brave about death as you are, and as regardless of life as you are?\u2014Aristotle: The best means for a seeker of knowledge to attain his end is an effort on the part of the speaker to speak only what is true, and of the hearer to hear correctly. I will now endeavour to speak truly; do you endeavour on your part to hear and receive correctly and truly. Do you not know that the meaning of the word 'philosophy' is 'fondness for wisdom'? and that the mind in its substance and origin is philosophy, and only delights in it, and only obtains peace therefrom?\u2014Disc.: Certainly.\u2014Aristotle: Do you not know that wisdom is the joy of the mind, and that wisdom can be obtained by goodness of soul and mind: now goodness of soul consists in its adjustment, and the adjustment of the mind consists in diminution of phlegm, rheum and blood?\u2014Disc.: Aye.\u2014Aristotle: If the goodness of the mind lie in its adjustment, and its adjustment in the diminution of those humours, when those humours altogether depart, it will become sounder and better?\u2014Disc.: We cannot fail to admit the truth of what you say, but nevertheless we do not find in ourselves the same pleasure in death that we perceive in you.\u2014Aristotle: Since sight guides the seer to his gain and preserves him from harm, try to let me increase your sight as to the advantage of death. O friends of wisdom! do you not see that the seeker after wisdom whose soul has become free from sin has mortified himself before death in respect of friends, and wealth, and empire, for the sake of which men desire the life of this world, and undertaken much sorrow and a heavy burden in seeking wisdom\u2014sorrow so great that it can only be relieved by death? What desire has he for life who enjoys none of the pleasures\nof life: and why need he flee from death who can only rest in death? Nay! He does wrong, whosoever seeks the name of philosophy without being worthy of its meaning: and he is ignorant who fancies that in the comforts, pleasures and delights of this world the road to philosophy can be found. Can you desire that the name of knowledge should be bestowed on you whilst you are enjoying the pleasures of this world, of eating, drinking, and so on?\u2014Disc.: We have no such desire, nor do we seek any such thing. How could we aspire to be philosophers while caring for this world, when we have seen that whenever there has been any excess in food or drink, or there manifests itself in the heart any motion of something contrary to the intellect, such as lust, or anger, or covetousness, or envy, the intellect remains inactive all that time; whereas, if that motion come not into play, then the blood only is at work, and there is nothing which serves better to protect it, and from which protection is more sought than the intellect.\u2014Aristotle: The branch of a thing does not come but of the root, and the part is not but of the whole. If ye abstain in this world from lusts, but are attached to this world in your heart, your abstinence is not perfect. Now the root of attachment to the world lies in love of self-preservation. Hence every one who abstains from its lusts, but desires to remain in the world has caught the branch and neglected the root; whereas he is perfect and has reached the goal who has both root and branch.\u2014Simmius: I have been abstemious in regard to the pleasures of this world; but now from what I have heard you say, I am anxious to remain in it no longer. Should that not be granted me, at least I shall endeavour to walk in your footsteps, and adopt your way of life, O teacher of mankind!\u2014Kriron: My mind's eye now shows me that there is no one to whom death is not detrimental except the philosopher. Whosoever has attained thereunto and become perfect, let him seek death and desire it; but whoso has failed to attain thereto, let him flee from death his farthest, and avoid it his hardest. For nothing but\nwisdom withstands death and gives peace from its pain.\n\n\u2014Zeno said: Aristotle's discourse leaves us no right to participate in pleasure or to endeavour to remain in the world, and the fact that he is more courageous about death than I\u2014though I do not fear it very much\u2014comes from his having been at greater pains than I to set his affairs right; had I looked after myself as he has looked after himself, and banished from myself avarice, desire, and anger, as he has banished them from himself, as great courage would be perceptible in me as we perceive in him.\n\nAnother said: Until this day I used to dread the approach of death; now what I fear is the protraction of life.\n\n\u2014Zeno: You are better able to attain death than to protract life.\n\nHe answered: My weariness of life does not induce me to summon death myself, before it comes to me.\n\n\u2014Zeno: We have known friends do much to see the friend who has not seen them; if you love death, what prevents your seeking it before it seek you?\n\n\u2014He answered: Death is not a friend, but a bridge which men must pass before they can arrive at that which they desire and love.\n\n\u2014Zeno: Then why do you remain, although you know for certain that death will make you nobler?\n\n\u2014He answered: I am like a guardian of the frontier-pass who, if he abide, abides with regret, and if he advance and conquer, will attain to honour.\n\n\u2014Zeno: What is the meaning of your parable?\n\n\u2014He said: The soul of the philosopher is stationed at the pass, its pass being the body; on the other side are wants, lusts, and passions. Every soul has sore trouble in dealing with these enemies, and in keeping them away. The glory consists in the joy and pleasure whereto the soul attains at parting.\n\n\u2014When their discussion had reached this point, another named Stephanus (?) said: If the name of 'philosopher' have no other use than to preserve its owner from the name of 'ignorant,' why should I make any effort to obtain it?\n\n\u2014Another said: Merely for the sake of honour I would not seek this name.\n\n\u2014Zeno said: Did I desire this name for nothing else, I should desire it for the sake of obtaining security from the fear and horror of death.\n\n\u2014Kriton said:\nThe greatest of the benefits of that science is that it makes for us many cares into one.\u2014Kramas (?) said: Since in this world one thing alone, sorrow, is permanent, the most profitable thing for us to sympathize with is the high aim of one who is concerned about a thing that is everlasting.\u2014Pindar said: All men are at war, and the fittest enemy for the warrior to attack is the enemy nearest home; and that enemy is the trouble of his own breast.\u2014Eletus (Theaetetus?) said: Who are the philosopher's enemies?\u2014Pindar said: His most particular enemies are the pleasures of his breast, which hinder his search after wisdom.\u2014When the discourse of these people had reached this point, Simmias, turning to Aristotle, said: Enlighten our hearts with the rays of thy lamp ere its light be quenched, good father!\u2014Aristotle: The most acquisitive of scholars is he who acquires no knowledge until he has disciplined himself and corrected himself; the most accurate of speakers is he who attempts not to speak save after meditation, and the soundest of workers is he who acts only after deliberation. And no one more needs deliberation and caution in carrying out a plan, than the philosopher in undertaking matters of which the trouble is present and the reward prospective. First let him meditate; then, when meditation brings sight, let him make sight his guide to action; and if sight show that the action will be remunerative, then let him endure the trouble of doing before he reaps the fruit. And when after seeing he resolves to undertake the work, at the time when he should reap the fruit he ought not to be vexed at the trouble he has endured. For he who weans his soul from pleasures and undertakes the labour of searching for wisdom for the sake of God, and to gain the reward therefor after death, if at the hour of death he exhibits melancholy, makes himself an object of laughter and derision. So too does he become an object of laughter and derision who makes a feast and lays the foundation of a palace, and when about to attain the purpose of his feast and of the building of his palace becomes sad and gloomy. I have known\nmen who have undertaken this task while in doubt concerning the reward\u2014nor is there any wonder that one who is in doubt concerning the recompense after death should be grieved and sorrowful about dying\u2014but I do wonder at any one who is grieved at death while professing to believe in a recompense after death.\u2014When Aristotle had brought this discourse to a conclusion, KRITON said: If you desire us to be contented after your departure, O worthy teacher! the eloquent speech which you have made must increase our sorrow at your departure; and if death be profitable to you, to us it is most detrimental, on account of the unsolved difficulties remaining among us for which you were our refuge.\u2014DIOTENES said: The same thing cannot be profitable to one thing and detrimental to another unless there be some contrariety between the two latter; if Aristotle's departure be profitable to himself and detrimental to us, this must be because of some difference between us.\u2014KRITON: There is both agreement and diversity between us and him; we agree in our wish and desire, and differ about our remaining and his departure.\u2014DIOTENES: Your grief comes not of his being about to enter the house of honour, but rather of your remaining in the abode of disgrace.\u2014LYSIAS said: You both speak well. You were the pillars of a hall wherein were lamps; the greatest pillar has fallen, and the weight has come upon the other pillars; the most brilliant lamp is extinguished, the light in the hall is diminished, and the darkness increased. Nor is it the falling of the pillar nor the extinction of the lamp that troubles you; but rather the darkness of the hall and the weight of the roof.\u2014SIMMIAS, glancing at Aristotle, said: O guide to wisdom! tell us what is the first thing which it behoves the seeker after wisdom to acquire?\u2014ARISTOTLE: Seeing that the soul is the source of wisdom, the first knowledge which is profitable for him is knowledge of the soul.\u2014SIMMIAS: How should he seek it?\u2014ARISTOTLE: By his own virtue.\u2014SIMMIAS: What is his own virtue?\u2014ARISTOTLE: That virtue whereby you asked me about yourself.\u2014SIMMIAS: How is it possible for any one\nto ask any one else about himself?\u2014Aristotle: Even as the sick man asks the physician about himself, and even as the blind man might ask those about him of his own colour.\u2014Simmias: How can the self be blind about the self, when the self is the source of all sight?\u2014Aristotle: When wisdom is secreted and concealed in the self, that is the soul, it is blind to itself, and to others alike: even as the eye without the light of a lamp is blind both to itself and others.\u2014Simmias: Then the learner can only learn through wisdom, and the seer can only see with a lamp.\u2014Aristotle: The soul becomes capable of receiving wisdom only by its natural correctness, and the sight of the seer becomes penetrating only through a lamp. When the two come together, it can penetrate.\u2014Simmias: If the soul and the eyes cannot attain brightness in their functions by their own virtue, unaided by wisdom and the lamplight, then nothing is nearer akin to the soul than wisdom.\u2014Aristotle: How can anything be nearer akin to that which it takes in than its own source? Do you not see that the teacher has a better right to the name of knowledge than the taught? and that the possessor of force has a better title to the name of force than one who is acquiring it? For the teacher is the source of knowledge, seeing that knowledge flows from him, and the strong is the source of strength.\u2014When the discourse reached this point, Lysias said: This subject is finished, and I will now begin afresh. Tell me how it is that knowledge of the soul is the worthiest thing for the acquirer to acquire first?\u2014Aristotle: Because knowledge is an essential property of teacher and taught.\u2014Lysias: How am I to know that knowledge is a property of the soul?\u2014Aristotle said: Because knowledge is in the body only so long as the soul is in it; and when the soul is separated from the body, knowledge disappears from it.\u2014Lysias: It may come from the body rather than the soul.\u2014Aristotle: If it were of the body, it would appear in the dead body as much as in the living body.\u2014Lysias: We are as ignorant of the knowledge of the dead, as we are of their ignorance. May it be that the ignorance of it which we do not know may come from\nthe fact that the soul is departed from it?\u2014Aristotle: If ignorance be blindness to one's own concerns, then the ignorance and blindness of the body before death are even more evident than its ignorance after death.\u2014Lysias: Though the ignorance of blindness may be in the body after death, the ignorance of folly is not there assuredly.\u2014Aristotle: What is the difference between the ignorance of blindness and the ignorance of folly?\u2014Lysias: Wherein is the identity?\u2014Aristotle: The two are identical in that they both afflict people of understanding. As for the ignorance of folly, it is like badness and evil-doing and evil-speaking; and as for the ignorance of blindness, it is like an evil smell and the fetid matter whence it proceeds.\n\nLysias: I only know of the existence of foulness and sensuality while the soul is in the body: can it be that this foulness proceeds from the soul and not from the body?\u2014Aristotle: If foul habits were of the original essence of the soul, while the soul was abstracted from accidental states, this foulness would appear in every soul, and no soul would be without it; how then could we have learned that the philosopher's soul is free from foulness, and uncleanness? Whereas we have learned and know well that the purity of their souls has gained the upper hand over lust and overcome desire and passion. They have subdued these inclinations and harmonized lust with reason.\u2014Lysias: If then between lust and the soul there be so great a difference, how comes it that passion and the soul part together from the body?\u2014Aristotle: The soul is a flame, and when some one of the humours of the body prevails, it kindles the body as fire kindles fuel, and causes the light of the soul to issue from the body even as a fire brings brightness and heat out of wood. And passion is as a fire that brings the brightness of the soul out of the body.\u2014Lysias: Can it be that brightness itself comes from warmth?\u2014Aristotle: If brightness varied with heat, a summer night should be brighter than a winter day, even as a summer night is warmer than a winter day.\u2014When the dialogue had reached this point, Lysias said: You have enlivened my mind,\nO teacher! this discourse is worthy of deep consideration. Most assuredly I must endeavour to distinguish between soul and passion, the heat of the latter and the brightness of the former. You have made clear to me each of the two, passion and the body, and the distinction of the soul from both, according to their attributes. Now, I would have you show the distinction between the conduct of the soul and of the passion, even as you have shown the distinction between themselves.\u2014Aristotle: Do you know of any distinction between their functions?\u2014Lysias: I know not of any distinction between their substance, but only between their functions: but I would fain have you show me the difference between the conduct of the one and that of the other by signs clear enough to distinguish the work of the one from that of the other.\u2014Aristotle: All that is bad is the work of the passion and all that is good is the work of the soul.\u2014Lysias: I know the difference between the good conduct of the one and the foul action of the other no better than the difference between their substances.\u2014Aristotle: Good action or goodness is that which, when it comes to you, puts you right; and badness is that which, when it comes to you, does you harm.\u2014Lysias: Nothing has ever come to me which has done good to a part of me but has damaged some other part. How can I call it \u201cgood\u201d when I never have found it free from harm?\u2014Aristotle: When the thing that is beneficial benefits that part of you which you are more bound to love than to hate, be not vexed if it harm some part of you which you are more bound to hate than to love.\u2014Lysias: What part of me is it which I am bound to hate, and what, that I am bound to love?\u2014Aristotle: You should love your intellect and hate your unintelligent part.\u2014Lysias: What comes of this?\u2014Aristotle: Why, nothing increases your intellect but that which lessens your non-intelligence. Love therefore that which improves your intellect, even though it lessen your non-intelligence. For the advantage done you by it in decreasing your non-intelligence is not inferior to that done you by the improve-\nLysias: You distinguished between illustration of heat and light; and inference of their functions by showing origin. I then asked you to make each do by some sign which should one from the work of the other; that well-doing was the work of the work of the passion. I asked you good and bad actions. You answered the intellect is a good action even intelligence is increased by it, and what- of intellect is bad, even though it non-intelligence. Neither intelligence nor is diminished except by its opposite, nor by what agrees with it. Now, I still explanation of what it is that increases the and what it is that lessens it.\u2014Aristotle said: whatever adds brightness to your vision of things your intelligence, and whatsoever makes things you lessens it.\u2014Lysias said: What is it that them brightness, and what is it that veils them?\u2014 Truth-speaking and whatever resembles it is illuminator, doubt and whatever resembles it a cloke.\u2014 Lysias said: I understand how true-speaking illuminates and how doubt darkens; but what are the things resemble them?\u2014Aristotle: Right-doing or justice resembles true-speaking, and injustice or iniquity resembles falsehood and doubt.\u2014Lysias: In what respect do justice and voracity resemble each other?\u2014Aristotle: Each of them consists in leaving things in their own places.\u2014 Lysias: And in what respect do falsehood and injustice resemble each other?\u2014Aristotle: Each consists in removing things from their own places.\u2014Lysias: Justice and injustice are the work of administrators and judges only; whereas I am asking you concerning things in general.\u2014 Aristotle: All men are judges, only some private, others public. He whose judgment errs, and whose tongue speaks false, and whosoever appropriates what is not his,\nsuch a man is unjust and a liar: whereas he who sees things aright, and whose tongue speaks the truth, and who is satisfied with what is his, is righteous, just, and veracious. Nor is any human action outside the two patterns which we have described.\u2014Lysias: How am I to know that nothing falls out of these two kinds?\u2014Aristotle: Enquire among the events which are passing and have passed over you, whether any of them lies outside these patterns. If none such be found, include those events which have not yet passed over you among those which have passed over you.\u2014Lysias: How am I to include what has not yet happened to me with what has happened, and pass the same judgment upon it?\u2014Aristotle: If the few be part of the many things, and the parts of a thing resemble the whole, then the few things which you see belong to the many things which you do not see, and it is probable that the many things which you do not see are like what you do see. If this reasoning be correct, then you may well pass the same judgment upon the good and evil which have not yet happened to you as upon the good and evil which have happened to you.\u2014Lysias: What should make me judge of the absent as of the present?\u2014Aristotle: That which is present must necessarily make you pass a judgment on what is absent; or the thing which makes you know the absence of the absent from knowing the presence of the present.\u2014Lysias: What prevents my knowing the present without knowing the absent? Or how is my knowledge of the absent increased by my knowledge of the present? That portion of the earth which I see does not show me the portion which is beyond; neither does my not seeing the portion to which my eye cannot reach hinder my seeing the portion which I can see.\u2014Aristotle: But do not you pass judgment that beyond the earth which we see there is the earth which we do not see? Similarly must you not necessarily pass judgment that beyond those events which have happened to you are those which have not happened, even as you passed judgment that beyond the portion of the earth which you saw there was the earth\nwhich you did not see?\u2014Lysias: I am constrained to admit that I must judge by the absent of the present. Only tell me this: If I pass no judgment from the present on the absent, does my knowledge of the present suffer any detriment? By knowing which I may derive benefit in judging of the absent from the present.\u2014Aristotle: No one knows a thing who is unable to distinguish it from what differs from it.\u2014Lysias: How so?\u2014Aristotle: If the saying of the wise Darius be true, that no one knows the truth who cannot discriminate it from the false, and no one knows what is right who cannot sever it from what is wrong, then so long as you are not acquainted with the absent, you have no means of knowing the present.\u2014Lysias: This subject is over. Now, O guide to philosophy! I would ask you this: Is it possible to embrace in one notion all those things concerning the baseness of which mankind are agreed, fornication, theft, drunkenness, deceit, injustice, treachery, fraud, malice, envy, ignorance, pride, self-complacency, so as to exclude nothing, whereby I might know that the events which have not yet passed over me are like to those which have passed over me?\u2014Aristotle: The possessors of these qualities and characteristics are unjust, false, and self-blinding, insomuch as they strive after what is not theirs.\u2014Lysias: How so?\u2014Aristotle: Do you not see that no one sets about any of these iniquities before avarice, desire, or anger bestir itself in him, after which he sets about them. Now with avarice, desire, and passion reason cannot remain at peace. And the reason being out of order, it cannot take the right path, and whoso does not take the right path goes astray; he that goes astray is a wrong-doer, and the wrong-doer and the liar are in torment.\u2014Lysias: You have collected under one notion all the vices; could you do the same for the virtues?\u2014Aristotle: To abandon injustice is to adhere to justice and right; and to avoid the false is to strain after the true. If the foulness of the vices has been made clear to you, it must inevitably have been made clear that virtue consists in abandoning\nvice.\u2014Lysias: Is there any mean between vice and virtue? so that having got rid of vice I might not attain to virtue, but remain at the mean; like one who, abandoning falsehood, stops short at silence and speaks neither truth nor falsehood; or one who avoids iniquity and does neither injustice nor justice?\u2014Aristotle: He who is silent elects to be so either with ignorance or with knowledge; if he be silent with knowledge, he is a speaker of truth; if with ignorance he is a liar. So, too, whoso pauses does so either for fraud or for right; if for right, he is just and righteous; if for fraud, he is iniquitous and a doer of injustice.\u2014Lysias: You have made clear to me the difference between all the good and the bad that may happen to me by a clear distinction, and have proved to me that whatever has not happened to me must resemble what has happened. God, who gave thee wisdom, and who protects thee, give thee therefor a meet reward! Never has father in his lifetime tended his child better, or after death left him a more honourable inheritance!\u2014Aristotle: If you are satisfied with the answer to your questions, let Kriton speak, for I can see that he wishes to do so.\u2014Kriton: It is painful to impose on you the burden of speaking, whereas it is sad to be quiet and leave the subject to be finished on some later day.\u2014Aristotle: Withhold nothing, so long as you see a spark of life in me on which I can sustain myself.\u2014Kriton: I heard and understood all the answers you gave Lysias; and I agreed as he did that the absent is to be known from the present. But I am not quite satisfied without knowing what are the qualities and unknown operations of that \"absent\" to which I confessed and agreed.\u2014Aristotle: I know of nothing in the present or the absent, save knowledge and ignorance, and the reward of the two.\u2014Kriton: How could I acknowledge this of the \"absent and the present,\" when I have not yet acknowledged it of the present? And though you should force me to acknowledge it of the present, I will not acknowledge it of the absent, save by definition and evidence.\u2014Aristotle: The evidence which tells you it of the present\nwill also tell it of the absent.\u2014Kriton: What evidence?\u2014Aristotle: Do you not agree that the right way in seeking the truth is what Sokrates said?\u2014Kriton: And what did he say?\u2014Aristotle: I am told that he said, Whenever you are in difficulty about a question, give it two alternatives, one of which must necessarily be true; then proceed till one of the two is refuted, for with the refutation of the one alternative will come the establishment of the other.\u2014Kriton: Yes, I have observed that he acted thus in difficult investigations. Now what evidence have you about the nature of the present and absent?\u2014Aristotle: Do you not grant that there is nothing outside knowledge and its contrary?\u2014Kriton: I must do so.\u2014Aristotle: Do you grant that things are bettered only by their like, and damaged only by what is unlike them?\u2014Kriton: Undoubtedly.\u2014Aristotle: Then do you not see that if the recompense of knowledge be not like it, it must be the contrary of it? And, if it be the contrary of knowledge, then the recompense of the wise will be ignorance, and the recompense of the seeing blindness, and the recompense of well-doing ill-doing? Now such as this would not be a recompense but a punishment. Then whoever bears the burden of knowledge must allow that he will gain no recompense for it. This judgment being false, the opposite of it is true. The recompense for seeing will be sight; for well-doing, good; for seeking wisdom, finding wisdom\u2014Kriton: You have forced me to agree that knowledge will be rewarded and ignorance punished.\u2014Aristotle: If you are satisfied that the recompense of the ignorant is the reverse of the recompense of the wise\u2014otherwise the reward of blindness would be sight and that of goodness badness, and that of hating wisdom obtaining wisdom. Now such a view or doctrine must be false in the eyes of him who has borne the labour of pursuing knowledge in the hope of the reward thereof, and in order to avoid the penalty of ignorance. This opinion being proved false makes the opposite necessarily true.\u2014Kriton: This argument applies as forcibly to me, since I have borne the burden of the searcher\nafter knowledge with a view to the reward thereof, and have avoided ignorance fearing its penalty. But what will you say if I withdraw this concession, and deny that knowledge is rewarded and ignorance punished?\u2014Aristotle: Then what induces you to discuss and to argue with me? The desire for the benefit of knowledge and the endeavour to avoid the harm of ignorance or something else?\u2014Kriton: Nay, desire for the benefit of knowledge and the endeavour to avoid the harm of ignorance induce me to do this.\u2014Aristotle: Then you have acknowledged that knowledge is beneficial and ignorance detrimental. Now a reward is not other than beneficial, and a penalty is not other than detrimental.\u2014Kriton: I acknowledge that wisdom is beneficial during life, not after death.\u2014Aristotle: What is the advantage of knowledge during life? A pleasant life or increase of knowledge?\u2014Kriton: I granted the value of knowledge, and I have seen that knowledge is detrimental to the pleasures of life; it necessarily follows that the advantage of knowledge must be in the next world.\u2014Aristotle: If you doubt the benefits accruing to the wise in the next world, while knowledge precludes the enjoyment of this world, it is impossible for you to assert that knowledge is of value in either world.\u2014Kriton: I see that if I grant that knowledge is beneficial, I must acknowledge that it is so in the next world. I will now deny that it possesses any advantage, in order to be able to deny that it is of advantage in the next world.\u2014Aristotle: Do you not then prefer hearing, seeing, and understanding to blindness, deafness, and folly?\u2014Kriton: Yes.\u2014Aristotle: Do you prefer them for the sake of some advantage or not?\u2014Kriton: For the sake of some advantage.\u2014Aristotle: Once again then you have acknowledged that there is some advantage; and you have the same conclusion forced on you as before.\u2014Kriton: I have ever acknowledged the value of knowledge, so long as I live, in respect of the comfort and peace that I gain from it, and the pain of ignorance that I am freed from; but I know of no other benefit therefrom.\u2014Aristotle: Then is there anything else beyond this which is otherwise\nthan it?\u2014Kriton: What evidence is there that there is anything else beyond this, which exists after death and is as it was in life?\u2014Aristotle: Now death is nothing else but the soul surviving the body?\u2014Kriton: It is nothing else.\n\n\u2014Aristotle: Then is anything \"absent\" which is benefited in absence except by that whereby it is also benefited in presence?\u2014Kriton: It must be so.\u2014Aristotle: Then why do you ask what it is from which the soul derives benefit in the state of absence from the body other than that from which it derives benefit in the state of presence? Or, what can harm it in the state of absence that does not harm it likewise in the state of presence?\u2014Kriton: You have left me no loophole to deny the value of knowledge in this world and the next, and the harm of ignorance in both; these I must acknowledge, and I allow that you are right in stating that in the present and the absent I know of nothing save knowledge, ignorance, and the recompense of the two.\n\nIt may be, however, there is something besides these which others have learned, though I have not.\u2014Aristotle: Can an answer be given but after a question?\u2014Kriton: No.\n\n\u2014Aristotle: Can a question ever be asked before that which is asked about comes into the mind?\u2014Kriton: No.\n\n\u2014Aristotle: If you have a clear notion of that about which you have asked, you have obtained the answer thereto in the answer which you received to your question about knowledge, ignorance, and their recompense. But if you have no notion in your own mind of that about which you would ask, I am not bound to reply.\u2014Kriton: True, my question was not justified, and no answer is due from you. I have obtained the answer to my question.\u2014Aristotle: Then give Simmias leave to speak in his turn.\u2014Simmias said: I heard all that Lysias asked concerning your statements, and the replies you gave Kriton: and all is clear to me except one word that Kriton accepted from you, but which is not clear to me as yet.\u2014Aristotle: Which?\u2014Simmias: I heard you say that there is nothing either in \"absence\" or \"presence\" except knowledge, its opposite, and the recompense of the two. Now how can it be clear\nto me that there is nothing save this?\u2014Aristotle: Do you know of anything else?\u2014Simmias: I know of the heavens and the earth, the mountains and the plains, the animals, and all else that is on the dry and the moist, which I cannot call knowledge, nor ignorance, nor the recompense of either without proof.\u2014Aristotle: Do you agree with the saying of Hermes, quoted by me in the book of physics?\u2014Simmias: What is that saying?\u2014Aristotle: Hermes states that no object acquires strength except by union with its like; and that none acquires weakness except by union with what is unlike it.\u2014Simmias: Yes, it is so; there is nothing in which experience does not show the truth of Hermes' saying.\u2014Aristotle: Then you have acknowledged that nothing exists except knowledge, ignorance, and the recompense of the two.\u2014Simmias: How so?\u2014Aristotle: Of the things which you have enumerated there is none that does not belong to this world.\u2014Simmias: Certainly.\u2014Aristotle: Know you what it is that induces philosophers to abandon this world?\u2014Simmias: Their knowledge, by seeing that these things are detrimental to the intellect, induces them to take this course.\u2014Aristotle: Then have you not learned that whatever harms the intellect is the opposite of the intellect, and the opposite of the intellect is non-intelligence?\u2014Simmias: If what you say, that these things harm the intellect, be true of the earth, it is not true of the heaven.\u2014Aristotle: Nay, the heaven differs not from the earth in this matter.\u2014Simmias: In what respect are the heavens as detrimental to the intellect as the earth?\u2014Aristotle: The least detriment occasioned to knowledge by the heaven is this, that it prevents the sight from penetrating and passing through; now that which is inimical to sight is inimical to intelligence.\u2014Simmias: This theory is true of the present; what of the absent?\u2014Aristotle: The absent must either be like or unlike the present, must it not?\u2014Simmias: Yes.\u2014Aristotle: If it be like it, must it not help its like? if it be unlike, must it not oppose it and thwart it?\u2014Simmias: Now, indeed, I must certainly agree to all that\nKriton accepted from you. Now tell me the explanation of a single saying that I have met with in the works of the great Plato: that everything that does good averts ill; but not everything that averts ill does good; and that the philosopher should amass a great quantity of those things which both avert ill and do good, and be content with a small number of those things which avert ill but do no good.\u2014Aristotle: Plato tells you that only those things suit the philosopher which bring him good and avert ill from him; and thereby he means knowledge which brings illumination to the mind and averts the darkness of ignorance; and he bids him acquire much of it. And of that which averts ill but is unprofitable, which is food, clothing and lodging, he bids him be content with as much as is absolutely necessary, because to exceed the limit in these things does harm to the intellect, whereas to seek the mean averts ill, but does no positive good, since none of the pleasures of knowledge proceeds therefrom to the mind. Hence it behoves the philosopher to be easily satisfied with obtaining the means of subsistence and very eager to acquire knowledge.\u2014Simmius: What is it that prevents that which averts ill from doing positive good when both agree in averting ill?\u2014Aristotle: That which does positive good differs from that which averts ill in this, that whatever averts ill only, if it be pursued to excess, ceases even to avert ill, and becomes detrimental; whereas that which does positive good, i.e. knowledge, the more there is of it the more beneficial it is; whereas that which averts ill only does so, so long as it in moderation. Do you not see that if you are satisfied with a modicum of food, it averts the mischief of hunger? similarly drink and clothing; whereas all, if there be more of them than is necessary, become detrimental, and their power of averting ill even is annulled, like heavy armour which wounds or kills its bearer. Whereas that which both does good and averts ill (that is, wisdom), however much there be of it, does not, like heavy armour, weigh down its possessor. Thus did Plato distinguish between that which\ndoes good and that which averts ill, according to what you heard of his sayings.\u2014Simmias: Is there any other term besides these two or not?\u2014Aristotle: One other term remains; if it be added to these others, nothing is left out.\u2014Simmias: What is that?\u2014Aristotle: Things are of three sorts: the thing which both does good and averts ill; that which averts ill, but induces no good; and that which does harm.\u2014Simmias: What is it that does harm?\u2014Aristotle: A thing which averts ill, when carried to excess, so as to become detrimental.\u2014Simmias: This subject is concluded. My mind is as much brightened by your instruction as the eye of the seer by the light of day. Now tell me: Is there any affinity between that which gives brightness to the mind and that which gives brightness to the eye? Or, is there any resemblance between the mind and the eye?\u2014Aristotle: They are things which do not resemble each other so much in substance as in function. If you have received the answer to your question, let Diogenes speak.\u2014Simmias became silent.\u2014Diogenes then said: I have observed that those philosophers whose mental vision has been most acute have been the most temperate. Now tell me: Do goodness and temperance spring from brightness of mental vision or not?\u2014Aristotle: There are different sorts of passions and divers sorts of intellects. Over against each passion there is an intellect best capable of opposing that passion. Lust in its nature is not the essence of folly, but each is a separate essence, though both are at one in harming the philosopher and keeping him from his recompense. Nor again is that faculty and quality which recommends self-restraint identical with the faculty and quality which overcomes folly and brings knowledge; neither are they opposed to each other; rather is there resemblance and also diversity between the two, like the resemblance and diversity between running water and ice; the one being fine and rare, the other hard and coarse; just so is fine ignorance opposed to fine knowledge, and strong piety to strong lust. And if a man\u2019s habit of temperance is weak and his property of knowledge strong,\nhis judgment sees aright, while his conduct, so far as continence goes, is weak; while the intellectual vision and the conduct of him whose case is the opposite are opposite.\u2014Diogenes: How can this be right, when you have said before that nothing exists except knowledge, ignorance, and the recompense of each? Now you have acknowledged the existence of knowledge, ignorance, continence, lust, and other things.\n\n\u2014Aristotle: Do you not see that running water and ice resemble each other? Similar to this is the resemblance of lust to ignorance, and the rest are like this too. Being similar in operation they become one in name.\u2014Diogenes: How do I know that ignorance is to lust as running water to ice?\u2014Aristotle: Do you not see that both hurt the intellect, just as running water and ice neither tolerate heat?\u2014Diogenes: This subject is over. Now tell me: Which science is the most proper for me to pursue?\n\n\u2014Aristotle: Since the pursuit of philosophy is the best of the pursuits of this world, and the recompense therefor is the greatest of the recompenses of the next world, philosophy is the best science that you can pursue.\u2014Diogenes: Is there any other knowledge besides philosophy or not?\u2014Aristotle: The vulgar herd have a sort of knowledge and science and truth and honesty and generosity and other wasted virtues, which are as different from wisdom as the form of an animal is from a picture or sketch on a wall.\u2014Diogenes: Why do you call those virtues of the vulgar herd wasted?\u2014Aristotle: On account of the ignorance of the vulgar with regard to them.\u2014Diogenes: How so?\u2014Aristotle: Because the vulgar wise man brings his knowledge into play there where it will not increase his gain, and their merciful man spares him who is worthy of exemplary punishment, and their veracious man brings his veracity into play when it pleases him, though the truth be obscene, and their liberal man is liberal to the unworthy, and their faithful man keeps his promises to people\u2019s ruin, and their hearer hears to no purpose. Beyond a doubt these good qualities are wasted in them, and no more resemble the virtues of the wise than a painting on\na wall resembles a living animal.\u2014Diogenes: How does your illustration correspond with the virtues of the few and of the many?\u2014Aristotle: Have you not learned that knowledge is life and ignorance death?\u2014Diogenes: Yes.\u2014Aristotle: The knowledge of the wise man vivifies his actions, whereas the folly of the ignorant mortifies his.\u2014Diogenes: Then are their good actions any better than their bad ones or not?\u2014Aristotle: They are not.\u2014Diogenes: How so?\u2014Aristotle: The well-doer of the vulgar intends to do good, and takes a wrong path. The evil-doer among them intends evil and carries it out in the wrong way. They are just alike and neither has the advantage.\u2014Diogenes: I know now in what way their virtues are wasted. Now show the superiority of wisdom without which no actions are profitable.\u2014Aristotle: Whosoever has seen good, abandoned evil, and entered into goodness has acted in accordance with wisdom; and whosoever has intended good and erred, or intended evil and carried it out, has departed from wisdom.\u2014Diogenes: This whole subject is clear. Now tell me: To whom was this thing, I mean wisdom, first made clear?\u2014Aristotle: The minds of men are far from being able to attain to anything so grand without teaching; just as their eyes are far from seeing without the light of a lamp.\u2014Diogenes: From whom did the philosophers learn it?\u2014Aristotle: The heralds and ambassadors of the different ages in the different regions of the globe were constantly summoning mankind thereunto; and the first person on earth to whom that knowledge came by revelation was Hermes.\u2014Diogenes: Whence came it to Hermes?\u2014Aristotle: His mind was taken up to heaven and it came to him from the Archangels, who had got it from the record of God. From him it came to the earth, and was received by the sages.\u2014Diogenes: How am I to know that Hermes obtained that knowledge from the inhabitants of heaven?\u2014Aristotle: If that knowledge be the truth, it can come from above.\u2014Diogenes: Why?\u2014Aristotle: Do you not see that the upper part of each thing is better than the lower?\nupper part of water and its surface are purer than the lower; the higher parts of the earth are pleasanter and fairer than the lower parts; the best member of a man is his head, the purest thing in a tree is its fruit; and so on with everything. The fittest thing, therefore, to come from on high is wisdom. Another proof is this: the substance and nature of wisdom have overcome and outtopped everything else.\u2014Diogenes: O guide to wisdom! Our minds vary not the least from thine. Make a compact between us which will guard us from differing with one another!\u2014Aristotle: If you would follow my ways, imitate my books.\u2014Diogenes: There are so many. Which will settle differences between us best if any such arise?\u2014Aristotle: Questions concerning the \"first science\" and the science of theology you should seek from the book of Hermes; for difficulties in the way of politics [you should go to the Politics, and for] difficulties in natural science, to the Physics; for difficulties about good and bad actions, to the Ethics; whereas if any difference arise among you about the definitions of speech, you should refer to the four books of Logic, the first the Categories, the second \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, the third \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, the fourth \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, or book of Demonstration, which tells you how to distinguish between true and false. There you will obtain light on dark matters.\n\nWhen Aristotle had spoken thus far, his soul became powerless; his hand shook, and the apple fell out of his hand. The philosophers all rose and came near to him, and kissed his hand and eyes and eulogized him. He grasped Kriton's hand and laid it on his face, saying, \"I commit my spirit to the Receiver of the spirits of the wise.\" Then he ceased and his spirit passed away. His friends lamented over him, saying, \"The day of knowledge is over.\"\nART. VI.\u2014Maricari Weather Proverbs.

VII.\u2014Some Remarks on the B\u00e1b\u00ed Texts edited by Baron Victor Rosen in Vols. I and VI of the Collections Scientifiques de l'Institut des Langues Orientales de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg.\u00b9 By Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nThe Institut des Langues Orientales of St. Petersburg has an admirable custom, which it were well if other similar institutions would imitate. From time to time it publishes, under the title of Collections Scientifiques, not mere catalogues of recent acquisitions, but full accounts of the more interesting manuscripts which have been added to its library, with copious extracts, tables of contents, and critical notes. The sixth volume of these Collections has lately appeared in two parts, of which the second is almost entirely filled with a description, from the pen of Baron Rosen, of certain B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. acquired by the Institut. It is this second part of vol. vi that I propose specially to discuss here, but of the B\u00e1b\u00ed texts contained in vol. i (published in 1877) I shall also have something to say.\n\nBefore proceeding further, I wish to enumerate briefly the publications to which in the course of this article I shall have occasion to refer, and to specify the abbreviations by which they will be hereinafter denoted. They are as follows:\n\n(1) Collections Scientifiques, etc., vol. i, Manuscrits Arabes, by Baron V. Rosen (St. Pet. 1877), denoted as Coll. Sc. i.\n\n\u00b9 I omit in this article all but incidental reference to vol. iii of the Collections Scientifiques (Manuscrits Persans), published in 1886, which contains descriptions of the Persian Bey\u00e1n and the Ik\u00e1\u0144. Of the former I am now engaged in the preparation of a complete text, and I gladly take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the Academy and the Institut of St. Petersburg for their liberality in permitting me to borrow the MSS. of this work contained in their collections.\n(2) Collections Scientifiques, etc., vol. vi, Manuscrits Arabes, (non compris dans le No. 1) . . . et B\u00e1bys, by Baron V. Rosen (St. Pet. 1891), denoted as Coll. Sc. vi.\n\n(3) My first paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds (The B\u00e1b\u00eds of Persia. I. Sketch of their History and Personal Experiences amongst them) in the July number of the J.R.A.S. for 1889 (pp. 485\u2013526), denoted as B. i.\n\n(4) My second paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds (The B\u00e1b\u00eds of Persia. II. Their Literature and Doctrines) in the October number of the J.R.A.S. for 1889 (pp. 881\u20131009), denoted as B. ii.\n\n(5) My recently published Traveller\u2019s Narrative, written to illustrate the Episode of the B\u00e1b (Cambridge, 1891), of which the first volume, containing the Persian text, is denoted as T.N. i, and the second volume, containing the English translation, introduction, and notes as T.N. ii.\n\nWere it possible, I would fain consider Baron Rosen\u2019s work by itself, without reference to my own. But it is not possible to avoid such reference; for, just as I, in my second paper in the J.R.A.S. for 1889, which dealt with the literature of the B\u00e1b\u00eds, as well as in the Traveller\u2019s Narrative, had Baron Rosen\u2019s researches continually in view, so he, in his later writings, constantly alludes to my work, often correcting, supplementing, or criticizing most kindly and most pertinently the statements and conjectures which I have advanced. To withdraw or modify such of these conjectures as are no longer tenable, to harmonize, as far as possible, the results of our independent researches, to epitomize, for the benefit of those not specially engaged in this branch of Oriental studies, the results of Baron Rosen\u2019s valuable discoveries, and to add some few new facts which have come to my own knowledge, is the object of this article. With these preliminary remarks, I proceed to the detailed examination of the texts published by Baron Rosen.\nI. The B\u00e1b's Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf,\notherwise called the \u1e32ayy\u00famu'l-Asm\u00e1.\n\nColl. Sc. i (MSS. Arabes) contains descriptions of two B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. The first of these (pp. 179\u2013191) is conjectured by Baron Rosen to be the Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf (Kur'\u00e1n, xii), composed by the B\u00e1b at the beginning of his mission. In B. ii, pp. 904\u2013909, I gave some account of this book, based on Baron Rosen's notice of the St. Petersburg MS., and remarked that there existed in the British Museum Library a MS., marked Or. 3539, which appeared to be a copy of the same work. Quite recently I obtained from a learned Ezel\u00ed, resident at Constantinople, a MS. which is professedly a transcript of the B\u00e1b's Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf. This I have compared with the British Museum MS. as well as with Baron Rosen's description of the St. Petersburg Codex, and I have satisfied myself that all three MSS. are copies of the same work, and that this work is none other than the B\u00e1b's celebrated Commentary. A Commentary in the strict sense of the word it is not, but rather a mystical and often unintelligible rhapsody, containing as many chapters as the original S\u00fara in the Kur'\u00e1n does verses, viz. one hundred and eleven. Five of these chapters (Nos. i, ii, iii, iv, and lxi) are described in the British Museum MS. as containing forty-two verses each. The number of verses is inserted, as in the Kur'\u00e1n, after the name of the s\u00fara. Thus the second chapter or s\u00fara is headed \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621\u060c \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0627\u062b\u0646\u062a\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0622\u064a\u0629 \u0634\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u0629, \"The Chapter of the Doctors, consisting of 42 verses. Revealed at Shir\u00e1z,\" and so with the others. In my MS. the number of verses is prefixed only to chapter xlii, which is described as containing forty verses, but in the letter which accompanied the MS. the sender wrote as follows:\n\n\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0642\u06cc\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u062e\u0648\u0634 \u062e\u0637 \u0648 \u0645\u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u062e\u0637 \u0622\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0634\u06cc\u0648\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0634 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0634\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u062d\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f. \u062a\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u0642\u0635\u06cc \u06a9\u0647\n\u201cThis book, the Kayy\u00famu\u2019l-Asm\u00e1, has been well and correctly transcribed. Its writing is in the style of the Bey\u00e1n, which is [called] shikast\u00e9-i-hayar\u00e1n. The only defect which it has, is that the names of the s\u00faras have not been inserted, and we had not another copy from which to transcribe them. You must get these names from Kirm\u00e1n, Isfah\u00e1n, or Teher\u00e1n. Each s\u00fara contains 40 verses, which is the number [equivalent] to \u0644\u0649 \u2018to me\u2019 [\u0644=30, \u064a=10], in allusion to the blessed verse [of the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, ch. xii, v. 4], \u2018I saw them performing obeisance to me.\u2019 But it is impossible to understand the book Kayy\u00famu\u2019l-Asm\u00e1 without the book Mustaykidh [see T.N. ii, p. 341], which is its commentary and explanation; and there is no copy of it either in the Island [i.e. Cyprus] or Constantinople. Write for it to Kirm\u00e1n, or Isfah\u00e1n, or Teher\u00e1n, that they may send it for you.\u201d It appears, therefore, that each chapter properly contains 40 verses.

A list of the latter, from ch. ii to ch. xx inclusive, is given by Baron Rosen, and this agrees with my MS. with the following exceptions:\u2014Ch. x in my MS. has \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0639 for \u0622\u0644\u0645\u063a; ch. xii has \u0643\u0646\u0633 for \u0643\u0646; ch. xvii has \u0623\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631 for \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631; chap. xviii has \u0643\u0628\u0639\u0633 for \u0643\u0628\u0639\u0634; and ch. xix has \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0631 for \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631. The first chapter forms a sort of preface or introduction to the work; the second is a \u201ccommentary\u201d on v. 1 of the S\u016bra-i-Y\u016bsuf; the third a \u201ccommentary\u201d on v. 2, and so on, up to ch. lxxxii, which is a \u201ccommentary\u201d on verses 80 and 81. From this point onwards each chapter corresponds to the verse in the S\u016bra-i-Y\u016bsuf which bears the same number, ch. lxxxii being a \u201ccommentary\u201d on v. 82, ch. lxxxiii on v. 83, and so on. But, as in Baron Rosen\u2019s description, only the first half of v. 103 is prefixed to ch. ciii, while the second half of this verse, together with v. 104, is prefixed to ch. civ. The irregularities in the arrangement of the verses prefixed to chapters liii and liv, noticed by Baron Rosen, are absent in my MS. The British Museum MS., like the St. Petersburg Codex, is without title, but to my MS. is prefixed a full title, as follows:\n\n\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0642\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0635\n\u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0642\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0645\u0639 \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641\n\n\"The Book of the Kayyumu'l-Asm\u00e1, the Commentary on \u2018The Best of Stories,\u2019 which is the S\u016bra-i-Y\u016bsuf; for the number of Kayyum (\u0664\u0660+\u0666+\u0661\u0660+\u0661\u0660\u0660=\u0661\u0665\u0666) agrees with the number of Y\u016bsuf (\u0668\u0660+\u0666\u0660+\u0666+\u0661\u0660=\u0661\u0665\u0666).\u201d\n\nAmongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds, therefore, this work is indifferently known as Sharh or Tafs\u012br-i-S\u016bra-i-Y\u016bsuf (\u201cCommentary\nthe S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf\u201d), Ahz\u00e1nu\u2019l-K\u00edsa\u015f (\u201cThe Best of Stories,\u201d a title given, in Kur\u2019\u00e1n xii, 2, to the history of Joseph), and Kayy\u00famu\u2019l-Asm\u00e1 (the word Kayy\u00fam being numerically equivalent to Y\u00fasuf).

(Or. 3539) I have two remarks to make. Firstly, owing to the same catch-word occurring at the foot of two closely adjacent pages, the leaves between f. 105 and f. 112 are improperly arranged. Their proper order, as I have ascertained by comparison with my own MS., is as follows:\u2014105, 110, 111, 108, 109, 106, 107, 112; in other words the leaves at present numbered 110, 111, 106, and 107 should be transposed and numbered respectively 106, 107, 110, and 111. Secondly, the first page is smudged and blurred, as though with water, to such a degree as to be illegible. Now when I was in Cyprus in March, 1890, \u015eubh-i-Ezel incidentally mentioned, in the course of one of our conversations, that at one time\nthe B\u00e1b, for some reason or other, issued a general order that such of his followers as had in their possession copies of his Commentary on the S\u016bra-i-Y\u00fasuf should \"wash them out\" or obliterate them. Between their love for their Master, and their love for his book, the B\u00e1bis found themselves in a dilemma, from which the majority of them sought escape by expunging a single page of the Commentary. It seems to me very probable that this accounts for the state of the first page of Or. 3539, the remainder of which is in perfect preservation.\n\nI cannot here speak at greater length on the Commentary on the S\u016bra-i-Y\u00fasuf, but before passing on I would remark that, sooner or later, it will have to be fully and carefully examined, and copious extracts, if not the whole work, published. It was the first, and, for a long while, the chief sacred book of the B\u00e1bis, and in it the earliest form of the B\u00e1bi doctrine must be sought. Apart from this it appears to me almost certain that some passages, at least, will be found in it to throw new light on the B\u00e1b's life and character.\n\nII. The S\u016bratu'l-Mul\u00fck, or 'Chapter of the Kings,' by M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn 'Al\u00ed of N\u016br, commonly called Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\n\nThe second B\u00e1bi MS. described in Coll. Sc. i (pp. 191\u2013212) consists of \"a collection of 30 pieces, mostly very short, which, judging by the tone and style, all belong to the same author.\" The twentieth of these pieces is, however, of considerable length, and is addressed collectively \"to the Kings.\" Its contents are fully described by Baron Rosen, and copious extracts from it are given. Before proceeding to discuss it, I will in a few words dismiss the other 29 letters, of which, with one exception (No. 29), only the opening words are given. There can be practically no doubt that they are all by the same author, and that he is none other than Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the chief of the Beh\u00e1'\u00ed B\u00e1bis, now resident at Acre, where I visited him in April,\n1890 (see T.N. xxxix\u2013xli). A similar collection of fifty-five letters is contained in the British Museum MS. Or. 3114, which was purchased on Jan. 9th, 1886, from Baron von Kremer, for whom, according to a rather illegible pencil-note in German on the first page, it appears to have been bought in Acre by one Y\u00fasuf Kh\u00e1lid\u00ed from \u201cthe spiritual chief of the B\u00e1bis there living in exile\u201d (evidently Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h). This MS. I have examined, but with negative results, for it contains none of the letters described by Baron Rosen. This, however, is not surprising, since the number of these *alw\u00e1h* or epistles addressed by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h to his followers (who regard them all as equally inspired) is practically illimitable.\n\nI now pass to a consideration of the far more important *S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fck*, the twentieth piece contained in the MS. (No. 438), described at pp. 191\u2013212 of *Coll. Sc. i*. This MS. contains, as Baron Rosen informs us, ff. 72, of which the *S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fck* occupies ff. 36b\u201357a, or rather more than a quarter. The description of it here given was written in 1877, and, since the history of the B\u00e1bis, subsequently to the year 1852 (when most of the still surviving chiefs of the sect, including M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u1e24useyn, \u2018Al\u00ed Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 *Sub\u1e25-i-Ezel*, emigrated from Persia and took up their abode at Baghdad), was then unknown in Europe, its authorship and many of the allusions contained in it could not at that time be determined by Baron Rosen. In the elucidation of this later history it was my good fortune to render some service to science\u2014service to which, in *Coll. Sc. ii*. (pp. 141\u20133, etc.), Baron Rosen awards a more than ample tribute of praise. Now when, in the summer of 1889, I came to write my second paper (*B. ii*) on the literature and doctrines of the B\u00e1bis, this *S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fck* greatly puzzled me. So much did it seem to me to differ both in style and tone from the *Epistles of the Kings* (*Alw\u00e1h-i-Sal\u00e1tin*), of which Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h was confessedly the author, that I finally came to the conclusion that \u201cthe letter described by Baron Rosen was not by Beh\u00e1, but by one of the other B\u00e1bi chiefs, possibly Ezel\u201d (*B. ii*, p. 958).\nBut Baron Rosen's recent researches have proved conclusively that I was wrong, and that Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h is the author of the S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fak, as well as of the \u00c1hw\u00e1h-i-Sal\u00e1tin. His ingenious arguments, the substance of which I shall state immediately, will be found at pp. 145-8 of Coll. Sc. vi. Disregarding, for the present, an important postscript of twelve pages, dated Oct. 15th, 1890, of which I shall have to speak subsequently, this volume (that is to say the second part of it) contains descriptions of four B\u00e1b\u00ed books recently presented by M. Gamazof to the library of the Institut. The first three of these, which are dismissed very briefly, are: (1) A MS. of the I\u1e33\u00e1n, dated A.H. 1299; (2) A copy of the Bombay lithographed edition of the same; and (3) A MS. of the \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0633, which I originally misnamed \u0644\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0633 (see Coll. Sc. vi, p. 243, n. 1; B. ii, pp. 972-981 and 1007-1008; and T.N. ii, p. 211). Two and a half pages suffice to describe these, since their contents, nature, and authorship have already been determined and made known. Far otherwise is it with the fourth MS. (No. 48/465), the description of which fills nearly 100 pages, and the contents of which, briefly stated, are as follows:\n\n(1) The S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fak, already described from another MS. (No. 438) in Coll. Sc. i, pp. 191-207 (Ff. 1b-39b).\n\n(2a) The S\u00fara-i-Heykal, of which the Epistles to the Kings (\u00c1hw\u00e1h-i-Sal\u00e1tin), described by me at pp. 953-972 of B. ii, form a portion (Ff. 40a-109a).\n\n(2b) The Letter to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia (La\u1e25ch-i-Sult\u00e1n), together with the instructions to the bearer written on the outside of the packet. The latter are of singular interest. By the kind permission of Baron Rosen I was enabled to include them (both text and translation) in vol. ii of my Traveller's Narrative (pp. 390-392). It is not certain whether this Epistle should be regarded as part of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal or not. Baron Rosen (Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 216-217) expresses his opinion in the negative, as follows: \"Nous avons vu plus haut, p. 195, que\ndans le titre de la lettre se trouvaient les mots, \n\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0632\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0647\u064a\u0643\u0644 \u0644\u062d\u0636\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \n[\u2018This is what was revealed in the Heykal to His Majesty the King\u2019] \u201cOn en pourrait peut-\u00eatre conclure que la lettre fait partie de la sourat-heykal dont M. Browne nous a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l\u2019existence et qui est probablement identique avec le texte imprim\u00e9 plus haut, pp. 149\u2013192. Pour ma part je croirais plut\u00f4t que cette lettre n\u2019en fait pas partie et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 compos\u00e9e un peu plus tard que la sourat-al-heykal.1 Dans ce cas les mots \u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0632\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0647\u064a\u0643\u0644 doivent naturellement avoir un autre sens, que je n\u2019ose point pr\u00e9ciser pour le moment\u201d (Ff. 109b\u2013143a).\n\n(3) \u201cA piece without title, which contains, in comparatively simple language, some definite information as to the transference of the sectaries from Adrianople to Acre. In the margin one reads \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0645. It is possible, therefore, that this document may have been intended for the Sultan\u201d [sc. of Turkey]. I myself am inclined to identify this epistle with the \u201cletter to Sult\u00e1n \u2018Abdu\u2019l-\u2018Az\u00edz\u201d to which I referred at p. 520 of B. i (Ff. 143a\u2013154a).\n\n(4) \u201cA piece without title, which is the \u0644\u0648\u062d \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 of Mr. Browne (II. pp. 960\u201363). In the margin one again reads \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0645\u201d (ff. 154a\u2013166a).\n\n(5) \u201cWithout title. A sort of hymn of triumph on the occasion of the death of one of the most violent enemies of the new religion, who, as would appear, had gone to Paris for medical advice.\u201d Fu\u2019\u00e1d P\u00e1sh\u00e1 and \u2018Al\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1 were the two Turkish statesmen who were chiefly concerned in the removal of the B\u00e1bis from Adrianople in 1868, and against whom the B\u00e1bis therefore cherish a deep resentment. Amongst the notes which I took of my conversations with \u0160uh-i-Ezel in March, 1890, I find the following:\n\n1 I find some difficulty in accepting this view. See pp. 281\u20132 and 313 infra.\n\u2014\"Fu\u2019\u00e1d P\u00e1sh\u00e1 was first \u0648\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0647 (Minister of Finance) and then \u0648\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u06cc\u0647 (Minister for Foreign Affairs). He and \u2018\u00c1l\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1 (then Prime Minister) combined to expel the B\u00e1bis [sc. from Adrianople]. The former died abroad, it is said a renegade from Isl\u00e1m. The latter was not so bad. \u015euhh-i-Ezel wrote him a petition asking not to be sent to Acre, and he laughed and sent a verbal message offering the choice of three places, Bosnia, Philippopolis, and Tekir-d\u00e1gh\u00ed. \u2018\u00c1l\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1 died a few months after \u015euhh-i-Ezel came to Cyprus.\u201d It appears, then, that I was mistaken in alluding (B. i, 492) to \u201cthe death of \u2018\u00c1l\u00ed P\u00e1sh\u00e1 away from his native country\u201d as one of the events foreshadowed by Beh\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, and that the name of Fu\u2019\u00e1d P\u00e1sh\u00e1 should be substituted. Mehmed (Muhammad) Fu\u2019\u00e1d P\u00e1sh\u00e1, son of the celebrated \u2018Izzet Mull\u00e1, was born in 1814. He received a medical training, but later abandoned this profession for diplomacy. He became Minister for Foreign Affairs for the second time in 1855. In 1867 he accompanied the Sultan to England and France. He died at Nice, whither he had gone for the benefit of his health, February 12, 1869. These particulars are taken from the last edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, vol. ix, p. 805, article Fuad Pasha, and on the whole they agree well with the supposition that his death was the occasion of this letter. Just as the Persians, for the most part, know no England but London, so would they naturally enough regard Nice as practically the same as Paris. This letter I shall therefore provisionally call \u2018the Epistle of Fu\u2019\u00e1d P\u00e1sh\u00e1\u2019 (ff. 166a\u2013168b).\n\n(6) Another epistle, without title, in Persian (Ff. 168b\u2013170b).\n(7) Beh\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s answer to a question concerning the nature of the \u201cFirst Point\u201d (i.e. the B\u00e1b) addressed to him by one of the \u201cLetters of the Living,\u201d or members of the original \u201cUnity\u201d (\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f) (Ff. 171a\u2013182i).\nIt is the discussion of this most interesting MS., which contains so much that is new and important, that has led Baron Rosen to reopen the question of the authorship of the *S\u016bratu'l-Mul\u016bk*. The conclusion to which he comes is that it was written by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, and that it was written at an earlier date than the *Alic\u0101h-i-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn*, or \"Epistles to the Kings.\" The arguments whereby he justifies this conclusion (and, as I have said, they appear to me irrefragable) are as follows:\n\n(a) The MS. containing this copy of the *S\u016bratu'l-Mul\u016bk* contains also a number of other documents, of which Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h is undoubtedly the author. Considering the hatred which subsists between the Beh\u00e1'\u00eds and the Ezelis, it is extremely unlikely that writings of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and \u1e62ub\u1e25-i-Ezel should be included in the same volume.\n\n(b) The cyphers \u1e0dr, prefixed to most of the letters contained in this volume, as well as to MSS. of the *Kit\u00e1b-i-A\u1e33das* and *\u012ak\u016bn* (both of which are known to have been written by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h), stand also at the head of this copy, and at the end of the other previously described copy of the *S\u016bratu'l-Mul\u016bk*. Now these cyphers, as Baron Rosen points out, can hardly stand for anything else than the corresponding letters \u1e0dr, \u1e0dr, \u1e0dr, \u1e0dr, Beh\u00e1, who in this case must be regarded as the author.\n\n(c) The difference of tone which I remarked between that portion of the *S\u016bratu'l-Mul\u016bk* addressed to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia and the separate *Epistle to the Sh\u00e1h* carried to Teher\u00e1n in July, 1869, by B\u00e1b\u00ed (see *Coll. Sc.* ii, pp. 193\u20135, and *B.* ii, pp. 956\u20137) is admitted by Baron Rosen, \"but,\" he adds, \"it would be rash to conclude from it that the two documents emanate from different authors, since we are still but imperfectly acquainted with the character of Beh\u00e1 and the circumstances of his life.\" Baron Rosen also\nconsiders (and I now agree with him) that the difference of style between the documents is not sufficiently great to justify my thesis.\n\n(d) Baron Rosen points out a passage, occurring in the letter to the Queen of England, wherein kings and rulers in general are exhorted to live in peace with one another, and to spend less on the maintenance of vast armies, so that the money thus saved may be spent for the benefit of their subjects. In this passage occurs the following expression:\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064d \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652\n\n\"This did we counsel you in the Epistle which we sent before this on another occasion\" (cf. B. ii, pp. 971-2). Well, a precisely similar injunction actually occurs in the S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fak, and there can, as Baron Rosen says, be little doubt that it is to this that Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h alludes. Baron Rosen gives the text of the two parallel passages side by side (Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 147-8), and of these parallel texts I here subjoin a translation, that the closeness of their similarity may be made apparent to all.\n\nFrom the S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fak.\n\n\"Fear God, O Kings, and transgress not the ordinances of God, and conform to that whereunto ye are commanded in the Book, and be not of the transgressors. Beware that ye oppress not anyone [even] to the extent of a single mustard-seed, but [rather] pursue the path of justice, for verily it is a straight path.\"\n\nFrom the Epistle to the Queen of England.\n\n\"O concourse of Kings! Verily we see you increasing your expenditure each year, and laying the burden thereof on your subjects; this is naught else than a great injustice! Fear the sighs of the oppressed and his tears, and lay not burdens upon the people beyond their endurance, neither ruin them to build up your palaces.\"\nFrom the S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fak.\n\n\"Next, be at peace one with another, and reduce your armies that your expenses may be diminished, and that ye may be of those who are in easy circumstances. And [even] if ye should raise up differences between yourselves, ye will not need great military forces, but only so much as will suffice for you to guard your domains and realms. Fear God, and act not extravagantly in anything, and be not of those who are prodigal! We know how ye increase your expenses daily, laying the burden thereof on your subjects; this is beyond what they can bear, and verily it is a great injustice. Act justly, O ye Kings, amongst mankind, and be ye mirrors of justice in the earth; this is incumbent on you and befitteth your dignity, were ye of those who judge equitably.\"\n\nThe parallelism between these two passages, pointed out by Baron Rosen, is so evident that no one, I think, will be inclined to doubt that both emanate from the same pen, or that the first is alluded to in the closing sentence of the second. We may therefore take it as proved that the S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fak was written by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, and that\n\nFrom the Epistle to the Queen of England.\n\n\"Be at peace one with another; then will ye not need large armies or stores for their equipment, but only such a force as will suffice for you to protect your realms and domains. Beware that ye forsake not the counsel given you on the part of One Wise and Trusty! Agree together, O concourse of Kings; thereby shall the blasts of discord be lulled amongst you, and your subjects shall live in peace and those who are about you, did ye but know. If one amongst you arise against another, rise up against him: this is naught but evident justice. Thus did we exhort you in the Epistle which we sent before this on another occasion.\"\nit was written before the \"Epistles to the Kings\" (Alwah-i-Salatin) which form a portion of the Sura-i-Heykal.\n\nBaron Rosen is now publishing the whole text of the S\u016bratu'l-Mul\u016bk (together with the other 29 letters contained in the MS. described in Coll. Sc. i, pp. 191-212) in the Zapiski of the Oriental Section of the Russian Imperial Society of Archaeology, and until this appears it would be premature to enter into a full discussion of the document or the date of its composition. Still it may not be amiss to notice such indications of the period to which it must be referred as occur in the extracts given in Coll. Sc. i. Now, there are certain passages which, taken by themselves, would tempt us to detect a reference to Acre, and the fact that other passages negative this hypothesis shews us how cautious we should be in attaching too definite a meaning to the vague and mystical expressions in which these B\u00e1b\u00ed texts for the most part abound. The first of these passages occurs on pp. 192-3 of the aforementioned volume, and is as follows:\n\n\u0625\u0646 \u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0621\u064b \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0646\u0628\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0631\u060c \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0648\u062a\u063a\u0646\u0649 \u0628\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062a\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u064a\u0645 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0628\u0642\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0645\u0639 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0621\u064b \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0631\u0641\u064a\u0639 *\n\n\u201cO Kings of the earth! Hearken to the Voice of God from this fruitful, lofty Tree, which grows in the Land of the Red Sandhill, in the Desert of Jerusalem, and is vocal with the melody of \u2018Verily there is no God save Him,\n\n1 Cf. Kur'\u00e1n, xxviii. 30.\n2 The B\u00e1b continually calls himself \u0634\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u201cThe Tree of Truth\u201d (cf. T.N., pp. 219, n. 12; 224, 225, 230, 294), and Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h here (and I think elsewhere) applies the same term to himself. The allusion is to the \u201cTree on Sinai\u201d (the Burning Bush) from which Moses heard the words \u0625\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u201cVerily I am God.\u201d See Kur'\u00e1n, xxviii. 30.\n3 It is probable, however, that the word al-kuds (\u201cthe Holy\u201d) may here have a less definite meaning.\nthe Mighty, the Potent, the Wise.' This is the place which God hath blessed to those who approach it, and wherein is heard the Voice of God from a lote-tree holy and high.\"\n\nThis passage certainly appears to refer to Acre, which might fairly be described as \"in the Desert of Jerusalem\"; which is actually called by the followers of Beh\u00e1 \"The Red Place\" (in reference, as I was informed by Beh\u00e1's sons, to a little hill hard by Beh\u00e1's dwelling, which is covered in the spring with red flowers); and which is situated amongst sand hills.\n\nHere is another passage (apparently addressed to the Sultan of Turkey) in which allusion would seem to be made to Acre (Coll. Sc. i, pp. 197-8):\n\n\"Hast thou heard, O King, what hath befallen us at the hands of thy ministers, and what they have done unto us, or art thou of the heedless? If thou hast heard and known, why didst thou not withhold them from their action, and why didst thou sanction against one who responded to\nthy command and obeyed thee [proceedings] which no [other] king would sanction against the people of his country? And if thou didst not know, then this is more grievous than the first [case], if thou art of those who fear God. Then will I tell Your Majesty of what befell us at the hands of these oppressors. Know then that we came at thy command and entered into thy city with conspicuous honour, but were expelled from it with dishonour, wherewith no dishonour in the world can be compared, if thou art of those who are informed. And they made us go until they caused us to enter in unto a city which none entereth save such as have disobeyed thy command and have been of the [number of the] transgressors; and this though we disobeyed thee not for so much as a moment! For when we heard thy command we obeyed it, and were of the obedient.\u201d\n\nTwo passages in the above extract I have italicized, because it is to them especially that I wish to refer. In the Traveller\u2019s Narrative, just edited and translated by myself, which was inspired, if not written, by Beh\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, we find it stated (text, p. 118; translation, p. 90) that \u201cthroughout this journey\u201d (from Baghdad to Constantinople) \u201cthe governors and officials observed the utmost consideration and respectfulness, while march and halt were alike dignified and honourable.\u201d It seems probable, then, that by \u201cthe city\u201d into which Beh\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and his companions \u201centered,\u201d in his own words \u201cwith conspicuous honour,\u201d Constantinople is meant.\n\nAs to the second passage italicized, it certainly seems to describe Acre better than Adrianople; at least I am not aware that the latter is specially used by the Turks as a place of banishment for criminals or political offenders, while the former certainly is. Hence Beh\u00e1 continually calls Acre \u0633\u062c\u0646 \u0639\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636 \u201cthe prison of Acre\u201d (T.N. vol. ii, p. 146); \u201ca place of exile for murderers and robbers\u201d (ibid. p. 73), and the like; while Adrianople is generally entitled \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0633\u0631 \u201cthe Land of the Mystery,\u201d and, moreover, according to\nthe Traveller's Narrative (vol. i, pp. 121\u20132; vol. ii, pp. 92\u20133), the B\u00e1b\u00eds were there treated not only with indulgence but \"respect and deference,\" so that one is disposed to doubt whether Beh\u00e1 could consistently describe it in the words here used.\n\nA few lines lower, however (Coll. Sc. i, p. 198), we find a passage, of which the translation is as follows: \"And they brought us until we reached [what is] in their fancy the Land of Transgressors (\u0628\u0644\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0627\u0629), and when we reached it we found therein no house wherein we might dwell, wherefore we alighted in a place whereunto none entereth save every miserable stranger. Therein we abode for some few days; but the thing waxed grievous unto us by reason of the straitness of the place; wherefore we hired houses, abandoned by their tenants, because of their extreme coldness . . . . , which none inhabiteth save in the summer; but it was in winter-time that we took up our lodging there, neither had my family, nor those who were with me, clothing to shield them from the cold of that bitter weather.\"\n\nNow the first part of this passage is still quite consistent with the supposition that Acre is referred to; and the complaint uttered by Beh\u00e1 of the absence of proper accommodation for the exiles on their arrival finds a parallel in one of the other epistles published in Coll. Sc. vi (p. 218, ll. 13\u201318), which describes the hardships endured by the B\u00e1b\u00eds on their arrival at Acre, where they were first imprisoned in the barracks. But the concluding words of this same passage supply a very strong argument against this theory, for it is evident from them that the B\u00e1b\u00ed exiles arrived at this \"Land of Transgressors\" in the dead of winter. Now there is no doubt that they were removed from Adrianople to Acre in August, 1868 (B. i, p. 526; B. ii, pp. 984 and 988, stanza 11 of Nab\u00edl's chronological poem; Coll. Sc. vi, p. 218, n. 1; T.N. ii, pp. 378, n. 2, 380), so that they could hardly have suffered from cold on their arrival there! On the other hand, if Nab\u00edl's poem is to be trusted, they reached Adrianople in Rajab, A.H.\n1280, corresponding to December, A.D. 1863; and even though Nabil be mistaken in the year, as Baron Rosen is disposed to think (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 218, n. 1), it is still not unlikely that he may have given the month correctly.\n\nThis argument appears to me quite to overweigh the evidence of isolated expressions which, taken alone, would seem to point to Acre; for severe suffering from cold is not a thing about which there can be any mistake or forgetfulness, and it is impossible that any one could feel cold at Acre in August. And in one passage in the Epistle to the Emperor of the French (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 181, ll. 17-18) Beh\u00e1 does describe Adrianople as his \"prison\":\u2014\"Matters waxed more grievous to us daily, nay, hourly; until they brought us forth from the Prison\" [Adrianople] \"and caused us to enter into the Most Grievous Prison\" [Acre] \"with manifest injustice.\" And a few lines lower down on the same page (ll. 24-25) he actually alludes to the previous letters which he designed to send to the Kings (i.e. as it would appear, this same S\u00faratu'l-Muluk, which we are now considering) in these words:\u2014\"Verily when we reached the Prison we designed to convey to the Kings the letters of their Lord, the Mighty, the Laudable.\" If we could only be sure that here also \"the Prison\" (without an epithet) denoted Adrianople, and that Beh\u00e1 was consistent in his terminology, the matter would be proved beyond doubt!\n\nThere is, however another passage in the S\u00faratu'l-Muluk which gives us surer ground to go upon. It occurs on p. 195 of Coll. Sc. i, ll. 5-7, and runs thus:\n\n\u0625\u0646 \u064a\u0627 \u0623\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0642\u062f \u0645\u0636\u062a \u0639\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0644\n\n1 Not A.H. 1281 as stated at p. 525 of B. i. See p. 308 infra.\n2 See p. 307 infra.\n3 Instances of this are pretty common, but one example will suffice. The B\u00e1b appears to have been born on Muharram 1st, A.H. 1236 (cf. B. ii, p. 993, and T.N. ii, pp. 218-222), but in the text of the Traveller's Narrative (vol. i, p. 2; vol. ii, p. 2) the date of his birth is given as Muharram 1st, A.H. 1235 (cf. also Coll. Sc. vi, p. 252). It is easy to see that an anniversary is more likely to be correctly remembered than a date.\n\u201cO Kings! Twenty years have passed in each one of which we have been visited with some new affliction, and wherein there hath befallen us what hath not befallen any one before us, if ye will be of those who hearken.\u201d\n\nNow since the B\u00e1b first proclaimed his doctrine in A.H. 1260 (A.D. 1844), this passage would seem to have been written about A.H. 1280 (A.D. 1863\u201364). It may, indeed, have been written somewhat later, since the \u201cafflictions\u201d of the B\u00e1b\u00eds did not begin till A.H. 1261, when the B\u00e1b\u2019s missionaries at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z were subjected to very cruel treatment by \u1e24useyn Kh\u00e1n, the Governor of F\u00e1rs (B. i, 521; T.N. ii, pp. 5\u20136), but it can hardly have been written earlier. The removal of the B\u00e1b\u00eds to Adrianople took place, according to Nabil, in Rajab A.H. 1280 (December, A.D. 1863),\u00b9 according to Baron Rosen (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 218, n. 1) in A.D. 1862 (A.H. 1278\u20139). The S\u00faratu\u2019l-Mul\u00fak would therefore seem to have been written about the beginning of the Adrianople period. It is, at any rate, difficult to suppose that it was written so late as A.H. 1285 (A.D. 1868), which was the beginning of the Acre period; while the allusions which it contains to the action of the Persian Minister at Constantinople and the support accorded to him by the French Ambassador (Coll. Sc. i, p. 194, l. 6 from the bottom et seq., and Coll. Sc. vi, p. 146, top), forbid us to suppose that it was written before the removal of the B\u00e1b\u00eds from Constantinople to Adrianople.\n\nThere is still another reason for referring the composition of the S\u00faratu\u2019l-Mul\u00fak to the Adrianople period. Stated briefly this reason is as follows: (1) The Epistle to the King of Persia appears, from internal evidence, to have been composed, or at any rate begun, before Beh\u00e1 left Adrianople. (2) Beh\u00e1 describes the S\u00faratu\u2019l-Mul\u00fak as having been\n\n\u00b9 See pp. 307\u20138 infra.\nwritten at a time when the B\u00e1b\u00eds had endured twenty years of persecution (pp. 280\u20131 supra), while in the Epistle to the King of Persia he speaks of the persecution having lasted more than twenty years. The natural assumption is that the former document was written at an earlier date than the latter, and consequently some time before the end of the Adrianople period.\n\nThe passage in the Epistle to the King of Persia, which implies that it was written before Beh\u00e1 left Adrianople, occurs in Coll.

When Beh\u00e1 speaks thus, we may doubt whether he reckons from the date of\n\n\u00b9 See Traveller\u2019s Narrative, i, p. 146, where the passage stands somewhat differently, though the general sense is the same.\nthe B\u00e1b's 'Manifestation' (A.H. 1260), or the beginning of the minor persecutions (A.H. 1261), or the period of the great massacres and persecutions (A.H. 1265\u20138), but at any rate we may fairly assume that he is consistent in his method.\n\nFor the reasons above stated it appears to me probable that the *S\u00faratu'l-Mul\u00fak* was written some time\u2014possibly a considerable time\u2014before the end of the Adrianople period. It is worth noting in this connection the statement of the Ezeli author of the *Hasht-Bihisht* (see *T.N.* ii, pp. 358\u20139), that Beh\u00e1 began his propaganda by letters from Adrianople.\n\n### III. BEH\u00c1'U'L\u00c1H'S S\u00daRA-I-HEYKAL, OR 'CHAPTER OF THE FORM,' AND THE ALW\u00c1H-I-SAL\u00c1T\u00cdN, OR 'EPISTLES TO THE KINGS' WHICH IN PART COMPOSE IT.\n\nIn my first paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds (*B.* i, p. 520) I mentioned and enumerated certain Epistles addressed by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h to various potentates, to wit:\n\n1. The Sh\u00e1h of Persia.\n2. Sult\u00e1n 'Abdu'l-'Az\u00edz.\n3. Napoleon III.\n4. The late Emperor of Russia.\n5. The Pope.\n6. The President of the United States.\n7. The Queen of England.\n\nIn a footnote on the same page I remarked: \"Of the second and sixth of these I do not possess a copy, and of the existence of the latter I am doubtful.\" I may now add that I believe the sixth to be altogether mythical, and that, as has been above shewn, the first Epistle at any rate, and possibly some of the others, were written not at Acre but at Adrianople.\n\nIn my second paper (*B.* ii, pp. 953\u2013971) I gave a fuller account of these letters, and translated certain illustrative\npassages from each. \"Taken collectively,\" I wrote (loc. cit p. 954), \"these letters constitute what is known among the B\u00e1b\u00eds as the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, which I think include also some shorter letters addressed to sundry other people.\"\n\nThe whole text of this S\u00fara-i-Heykal (for there can be practically no doubt that it is this document) has now been published by Baron Rosen in Coll. Sci. vi, pp. 14 et seq. It forms the second piece in the Institut MS marked No. 48/465, and contains, besides other matter several of the afore-mentioned Alw\u00e1h-i-Sal\u00e1tin or \"Epistle to the Kings,\" namely, (1) The Epistle to the Pope (Coll. Sci. vi, pp. 172\u20138); (2) The Epistle to Napoleon III. (Coll. Sci. vi, pp. 178\u2013186); (3) The Epistle to the late Emperor of Russia (Coll. Sci. vi, pp. 186\u2013188), of which in my MS only a portion was given; and (4) The Epistle to the Queen of England (Coll. Sci. vi, pp. 188\u2013192). Whether the Epistle to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia, and the other letter which follow it (pp. 270\u20132 supra), should be regarded as forming part of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal or not is doubtful.\n\nBefore proceeding to discuss Baron Rosen's text of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, it seems desirable to give a short description of the MS. used by me in preparing my description of the Alw\u00e1h, in which the arrangement is somewhat different.\n\n**Description of the Kirm\u00e1n MS. which formed the basis of my account of the Alw\u00e1h-i-Sal\u00e1tin (B. ii, p. 954).**\n\nContains ff. 40, each leaf measuring 17\u00b75 \u00d7 10\u00b75 centimetres.

While I was at Kirm\u00e1n in July, 1888, some of my B\u00e1b\u00ed friends informed me that a poor \u00e1kh\u00fand, or teacher of their acquaintance, who was not a B\u00e1b\u00ed, had copied out for himself certain B\u00e1b\u00ed documents, but that, inasmuch as the possession of such was in itself somewhat of a risk, he would be glad to sell them for a small sum of money. Accordingly, on the evening of July 29th, this \u00e1kh\u00fand, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ahmad by name, was brought by two of the B\u00e1b\u00eds to my lodging. Soon after his arrival he produced the MS. in question, and agreed to let me buy it of him. I observed, while turning over the leaves, that he had (as a safeguard to himself, in case the book should be found in his possession by Musulm\u00e1ns) written at the end of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Akhd\u00e1s, that it was the Book of \u201cthe accursed, misguided, misleading sect\u201d of the B\u00e1b\u00eds. Fearing, lest he should get into trouble with my B\u00e1b\u00ed friends, if they should chance to see these words, I closed the book and laid it aside. Shortly afterwards I was led outside into the garden by one of the two B\u00e1b\u00eds, who wished to speak to me in private. On my return I found my anticipations verified. The other B\u00e1b\u00ed had, in my absence, taken up the MS. and seen the objectionable words, and was now pouring out the vials of his wrath on poor M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ahmad, who, shivering with fear and shame, was on the verge of tears. I did my best to make\npeace, but with small success, until M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u00c1hmad washed out the abusive paragraph, and, under the previous colophon\u2014\n\n\u0648\u0642\u062f \u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062a\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u062b\u0627\u0645\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0634\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u0629\n\nwrote in their place as follows:\n\n\u0628\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0642\u0647 \u0648\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0635\u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0621 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u064a \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0646\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0646\u0642\u06cc \u0627\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0643\u0627\u0645 \u0648 \u062a\u06a9\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0641 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u062f\u0639\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0646 \u0647\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\n\n\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0630\u06cc\u0642\u0639\u062f\u0647 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f0\u06f5\n\n\u201cBy the praise of God and His favour and grace. This is the precious Most Holy Book (*Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00c1khd\u00e1s*), which is [one] of the works of His Most Excellent Holiness *Beh\u00e1* (may my life and the life of the worlds be a sacrifice to him), and was revealed by the Sun of the Horizon of Illumination, and sets forth laws and regulations for [God\u2019s] servants and for all mankind. Request is made for the prayers of the reader. *Vale*. The month of *Zi\u2019l-Ka\u2019d\u00e1*, A.H. 1305\u201d [July, 1888].\n\nNow it is very seldom that we come across a B\u00e1b\u00ed MS. transcribed by one who is not himself a B\u00e1b\u00ed, and this perhaps accounts for the fact that in point of accuracy this MS. leaves much to be desired. Indeed, so inaccurate is it in places, that the sons of Beh\u00e1, to whom I shewed it, would have destroyed it if I had not begged that it might be spared.\n\nFrom this digression I now return to a consideration of the text of the *S\u00fara-i-Heykal*, published by Baron Rosen (*Coll. Sc. vi*, pp. 149\u2013192), in which, for the present, I do not include the Epistle to the King of Persia, the *L\u00e1q\u00e1h-i-R\u00e1\u2019\u00eds*, and the other documents enumerated at pp. 270\u20132 supra.\nThe S\u00fara-i-Heykal is divisible, as Baron Rosen points out (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 149), into two parts, of which the second part (p. 172, l. 15\u2014p. 192, l. 2) contains in uninterrupted succession, (1) the Epistle to the Pope, (2) the Epistle to the \"King of Paris,\" (3) the Epistle to the Emperor of Russia, and (4) the Epistle to the Queen of England. Inasmuch as these were described in my second paper on the B\u00e1bis in the J.R.A.S. for 1889, I shall have but little to say of them here. The first part of the S\u00fara, on the other hand, now first made available to Orientalists, deserves a fuller notice. It contains Beh\u00e1's formulation of his claims, and declaration of his divine nature and mission, coupled with reproaches addressed to such of the B\u00e1bis as refuse to acknowledge them, and angry denunciations of his rival and half-brother M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 \u0160uhb-i-Ezel. Speaking broadly, then, we may say that the first part of the Heykal is addressed to the B\u00e1bi community, the second part to the rulers of Christian lands. Of this first part I can, perhaps, best convey some idea by translating from it certain selected passages, prefixing to each, the number of the page in Coll. Sc. vi, on which the original text occurs.\n\nSelected passages from the First Part of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal.\n\n(P. 150, l. 5) \"Blessed be He who hath caused to descend upon his servant the burden of the heavens and the earth; herein we do verily praise Him, and none knoweth it save the wise. Glory be to Him Who hath cast His Beauty under the claws of hatred amongst the wicked; verily we acquiesce in this, and none understandeth it save them who have understanding. Glory be to Him, Who hath entrusted \u1e24useyn,\\(^1\\) amidst the hosts of the enemy\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. Though he is generally spoken of, when mentioned by name, as [M\u00edrz\u00e1] \u1e24useyn 'Ali, it would appear from this and other passages, especially the opening words of the S\u00faratu'-i-Muluk, and a passage in another\nwhile the spears of violence and hatred reach his body every moment; verily, we thank Him for what He hath decreed against His afflicted servant who turns to Him and stands for Him.\n\n\"And when I saw myself at the culminating point of affliction, I heard a voice of the most wonderful and sweetest over my head; and when I turned my face I beheld the H\u00far\u00ed\u00b9 of celebration of my Lord's Name floating in the air on a level with the head, and I saw her to be rejoicing in herself, as though the fashion of Paradise were apparent in her face, and the splendour of the Most Merciful were displayed in her cheek. And she was speaking between the heavens and the earth with a voice wherewith hearts and intelligences were attracted. And all the wounds within me and without me were made glad with glad tidings wherewith my soul was rejoiced, and the honourable amongst [God's] servants were filled with joy. And she pointed with her finger towards my head and [thus] addressed all who are in the heavens and the earth:\u2014'By God, this is, indeed, the Beloved of the worlds, but ye understand not. This is, indeed, the Beauty of God in your midst, and His authority amongst you, did ye but know. And this is, indeed, the Mystery of God and His Treasure, and the Command of God and His Glory unto whomsoever is in the kingdom of command and creation, if ye will understand. Verily this is, indeed, he whom all who inhabit the realms of Eternity desire to meet, and beside them those who rest within the pavilions of splendour; but ye turn away from his beauty.'\n\n\u00b9 This celestial H\u00far\u00ed or angel occupies a prominent position throughout the first half of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, and seems to play a part analogous to that taken by the angel Gabriel in the revelations of Mu\u1e25ammad.\n\u201cO people of the Bey\u00e1n! If ye will not help him, God will help him with the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and beside them the hosts of the Unseen, by His command, \u2018Be,\u2019 and it shall be! And He will raise up by His will a creation, whereof none knoweth save Himself, the Protecting, the Self-subsistent. These will He purify from the stain of vain conjecture and passion, and will raise up to the station of sanctity, and by them He will make manifest the signs of glory of His rule on earth: thus hath it been devised on the part of God, the Mighty [p. 151], the Loving.\n\n\u201cO people of the Bey\u00e1n! Do ye deny him whom ye were created to meet, and do ye then rejoice in your seats? And do ye take objection to him, of whom one single hair is more precious in God\u2019s sight than whomsoever is in the heavens and the earth? Do ye then mock at us?\n\n\u201cO people of the Bey\u00e1n! Produce what ye have that I may know by what proof ye formerly believed in the Manifestations of the [Divine] Command, and by what argument ye are to-day puffed up with pride. By Him, who created me from the Light of His Beauty, I have not found any more heedless than you, nor any blinder than you: verily, ye seek to justify your faith in God by the Epistles which are in your hands, [but] when verses are revealed and the lamp shines brightly, ye reject him by whose pen matters are determined in a Preserved Tablet. Ye read the verses and deny their Source and their Revealer: thus hath God taken away your sight, as a recompense for your actions, did ye but know it. Ye write the verses in the evening and at dawn, and then ye are veiled from him who reveals them! . . .\n\n1 The expression \u201c\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0646\u201d \u201cpeople,\u201d or \u201cchurch of the Bey\u00e1n,\u201d is ordinarily used to denote the adherents of the old dispensation of the B\u00e1bi religion, or, in other words, B\u00e1bis pure and simple, as contrasted with Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds.\n\u201cO Supreme Pen! Hear the voice of thy Lord from the Lote-tree beyond which there is no passing, in the bright abode of [the Divine] Unity, that thou may\u2019st find thyself refreshed and fragrant by the strains of thy Merciful Lord, and that thou may\u2019st be sanctified from sorrow by these gales, which breathe from the region of My Name, \u2018the Forgiving.\u2019 Then raise up in this Form [Heykal] forms of the [Divine] Unity, that they may tell in the kingdom of creation of their Lord, the Supreme, the Most Splendid, and may be of those who are illuminated by the lights of their Lord. Verily, we have appointed this Form [Heykal] the Source of Being amidst the new creation, that all may be assured that I am able to do what I will by My Word \u2018Be, and it is.\u2019 And under the shadow of each Letter of the Letters of this Form [Heykal] we will raise up a creation whose number none knoweth, save God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsistent.\u201d\n\nHere begins that portion of the S\u00fara from which it derives its name of \u201cHeykal.\u201d This word means \u201cbody,\u201d \u201cform,\u201d \u201ctemple,\u201d \u201caltar,\u201d and it appears to be used in somewhat different senses in different passages. In some cases, as in the above paragraph, Beh\u00e1 seems to apply it to himself, as being the corporeal \u201ctemple\u201d which the Deity inhabits. In other places (e.g. p. 158, ll. 9\u201313) it would appear to denote this particular revelation\u2014the S\u00fara-i-Heykal. In different parts of the S\u00fara the Eye, the Hearing, and the Tongue of the Heykal are addressed; and elsewhere, the four letters H. Y. K. L. composing the word, are severally and successively apostrophized in like fashion. Altogether, however vague may be the sense in which the term is employed, its occurrence is so constant, and the importance attached to it evidently so great, that the name of the S\u00fara\n\n---\n\n1 By this expression Beh\u00e1 appears to denote himself, as the instrument whereby God\u2019s pleasure is made known to men.\n2 Kur\u2019\u00e1n, liii, 14.\nis amply accounted for. Interesting as this is, it is so long and so obscure that I cannot here do more than notice a few of the most important and characteristic passages. Chief amongst these is one in which M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 \u0160uhh-i-Ezel is accused of having tried to poison Beh\u00e1\u2019. This passage I have translated in full at pp. 368-9 of vol. ii of my Traveller\u2019s Narrative. As a comment on it I will therefore here give the Ezeli account of the same transaction, translated from a MS. which I recently obtained of a very rare and interesting work entitled Hasht Bihisht, composed, as I was informed, by the late H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid Jaw\u00e1d of Kirm\u00e1n, an ardent partizan of \u0160uhh-i-Ezel\u2019s. It will be seen that not only the charge of attempted fratricide, but also the charge of bringing a false accusation of the same against the victim of the attempt, is brought by both factions of the B\u00e1bis against the chief of the rival faction. Which version, if either, may be true, it is impossible to decide, but at least the fierce animosity which subsists between the Ezel\u00eds and the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds will be sufficiently apparent from a perusal of either.\n\n[Translation from the Hasht Bihisht]: \u201cThe first juggle and trick of sorcery which he [i.e. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn \u2018Al\u00ed Beh\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h] outlined was this, that he brought to \u1e24uzrat-i-Ezel a dish of plain food, with one side of which he had mixed some poison, intending to poison His Holiness. For hitherto the apportioned breakfast and supper of His Holiness the Fruit [\u1e24azvat-i-Thamara, one of the titles given to \u0160uhh-i-Ezel by his followers] had been from the house of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn \u2018Al\u00ed. When that poisoned dish was placed before His Holiness, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn \u2018Al\u00ed pressed him to partake of it. By a fortunate chance the smell of onions was perceptible in the food, and His Holiness, being averse to onions, refused to taste it. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn \u2018Al\u00ed continued to press him urgently to eat. He replied, \u2018Since it smells of onions, I will not eat it; if it is [so] good, eat it\nyourself.' From this answer M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u1e24useyn \u2018Al\u00ed supposed that His Holiness had divined his evil design, and, simply with the view of disguising [the truth] and putting a better appearance on the matter, ate a little from the other side\\(^1\\) of the dish, in order that the suspicions of His Holiness might perhaps be dispelled and he might eat of the poisoned side. But His Holiness, because of the smell of onions, would not eat. Now, inasmuch as the poison had to some extent diffused itself to the other side,\\(^1\\) it produced some slight effect on the aforesaid M\u00edrz\u00e1 [\u1e24useyn \u2018Al\u00ed], causing in him sickness and vomiting. Then he summoned the physicians, gathered his own people round him, and privately informed them of his state, declaring that Hazrat-i-Ezel had poisoned him. Next day, when His Holiness the Fruit went to the bath, Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u00ed the barber of Isfah\u00e1n (whose ears had been cut off for theft and other crimes by the governor of Isfah\u00e1n, and who, having fled thence to Baghdad, had become one of Mirz\u00e1 \u1e24useyn \u2018Al\u00ed\u2019s chosen associates, and the source of manifold evils and mischiefs) came forward in the bath [as though] to shave with his barber\u2019s razor the sides of the head and the lower part of the throat of His Holiness. His Holiness, however, divining with great acumen his evil design, refused to be shaved; and, as soon as he came out from the bath, chose another lodging in Adrianople, and withdrew himself from these persons.\"\\(^2\\) This narrative may be most instructively compared with Beh\u00e1\u2019s version contained in the S\u00fara-i-Heykal (Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 154\u20135; T.N. ii, pp. 368\u20139). I now proceed to give translations of a few more passages from the S\u00fara-i-Heykal.\n\n(P. 155, l. 20) \"O Pen of Eternity! Grieve not at what hath befallen thee, for God will raise up a people who shall see with their eyes and shall remember\n\n\\(^{1}\\) i.e. the unpoisoned side.\nwhat hath befallen thee. Withdraw the pen from the mention of these; then wield it in commemoration of the King of Pre-existence. Leave the things of the contingent world; then drink of the pure sealed wine of My celebration. Beware that thou busy not thyself with the mention of those from whom thou shalt obtain naught but the savours of hatred; those of whom love of supremacy hath so taken possession that they destroy their souls to increase their celebrity and to perpetuate their name. These hath God inscribed as the slaves of names in a Preserved Tablet . . . . . . .\n\n(P. 156, l. 3) \u201cO Form [Heykal]! Stretch forth thy hand over all that is in the heavens and in the earth, and take the reins of command in the grasp of thy will: verily We have set on thy right hand the dominion of all things: do what thou wishest, and fear not those who know not\u201d . . . . . . .\n\n(P. 158, l. 3) \u201cBeware that ye shed not blood! Draw the sword of the tongue from the sheath of utterance, for therewith thou shalt subdue the cities of [men\u2019s] hearts. Verily, We have taken away the command to slay from your midst: verily My mercy hath preceded all contingent beings, if ye would know it\u201d . . . . .\n\n(P. 159, l. 12) \u201cO Form of the [Divine] Command! If thou findest none advancing towards thy gifts, grieve not! Thou wert created for Myself: occupy thyself with celebrating me amongst my servants: this is what hath been apportioned to thee in a Preserved Tablet.\u201d\n\n(P. 160, l. 15) \u201cAnd amongst the infidels is he who disbelieved within his soul and arose in war, saying, \u2018These verses are spurious:\u2019 thus in bygone time said men who have passed away, and Lo! in hell-fire do they [now] cry for help.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 i.e. the Jihdd, or religious warfare, is abolished in this dispensation.\nIn the last word of this sentence\u2014yastaghith\u00fan, \u201cthey cry for help\u201d\u2014allusion is probably made to the Mustagh\u00e1th (He from whom help is sought) of the Bey\u00e1n (see B. i, p. 515). The sum of the letters composing this word is \\(2001 = 40 + 60 + 400 + 1000 + 1 = 500\\), and it is implied in certain passages of the Persian Bey\u00e1n that \u2018He whom God shall manifest\u2019 will or may delay his advent till this number of years have elapsed since the beginning of the B\u00e1b\u2019s mission. To these texts the Ezel\u00eds specially appeal in justification of their rejection of Beh\u00e1 \u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s claim to be the Promised Deliverer, while they are reproached by the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds for suffering themselves to be \u201cveiled\u201d by this word from the truth.

T. N. ii, p. xxxviii. This alludes to a vulgar belief prevalent amongst Persian Muhammadans that the B\u00e1b\u00eds bewitch their guests by means of some enchanted substance mixed with their food or tea, so that whoever eats or drinks with them becomes a B\u00e1b\u00ed. This superstition is referred to in the T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd.\nspeak before us saith what none of those of yore said, and hath stooped to do what none of those who have disbelieved in [God] the Merciful have done throughout all the ages: to this their words and deeds bear witness, if ye will judge aright. Verily he who refers God\u2019s signs to sorcery hath not believed in any one of God\u2019s apostles: his efforts have gone astray in futile life, and he hath become of those who say what they know not. Say: \u2018O servant, fear God who created thee and fashioned thee, and seek not to emulate God: be just in thy soul, and be of those who act equitably.\u2019 Verily, such as are given knowledge from God, these will find in their [i.e. the Ezelis\u2019] very objections strong arguments wherewith to confute them and to establish [the truth of] this Apparent Light. Say: \u2018Do ye say what the infidels said when there came unto them the Reminder\u00b9 from their Lord?\u2019 Woe unto you, O concourse of fools! Evil is that which ye acquire!\u201d\n\nThe whole of this most interesting passage is directed against Ezel and his followers, and it contains the gist of the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00ed argument. The B\u00e1b laid down the doctrine that the production of \u2018verses\u2019 (\u0101y\u00e1t), or inspired words, was the one and only proof of a divine mission. To this proof alone did Mu\u1e25ammad appeal: to this proof alone did the B\u00e1b appeal: and of \u2018Him whom God shall manifest\u2019 this proof alone was to be expected or required. On this ground the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds assert that no unprejudiced B\u00e1b\u00ed can remain (like the Ezel\u00eds do) in the old dispensation. They believed in the B\u00e1b because of his \u2018verses\u2019; Beh\u00e1 has produced similar \u2018verses\u2019; therefore they cannot fairly refuse\n\n\u00b9 By the \u2018Reminder of God\u2019 (\u0627\u0644\u0630\u06a9\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647\u06cc) the B\u00e1b seems to be meant. This is clearer in another passage of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal (p. 167, ll. 3\u20135), of which this is the translation:\u2014\u201cDo ye ask the Jews whether the Spirit [i.e. Christ] was of a truth from God? Or [do ye ask] idols whether Mu\u1e25ammad was a prophet? Or [do ye ask] the church of the Furk\u00e1n [i.e. the Muhammadans] concerning the Reminder of God (\u0627\u0644\u0630\u06a9\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647\u06cc), the Mighty, the High?\u201d\nto believe in him. Hence the Beh\u00e1'\u00eds are of no people more impatient than of the Ezel\u00eds, who, accepting their premiss, that such 'verses' are the sign of a divine mission, deny their conclusion that Beh\u00e1 is divinely inspired. Two passages addressed to \u1e62ub\u1e25-i-Ezel in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Akdas and the Lauch-i-Na\u1e63ir serve admirably to illustrate and elucidate this portion of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal. The text and translation of these I have given in the footnotes on pp. 93-4 and 96-7 of vol. ii of my Traveller's Narrative, and I will not therefore repeat them here.\n\nHaving now devoted nearly as much space as I can spare to the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, I must content myself with noticing a few of the most important passages in what remains of the first part.\n\nOn p. 161, ll. 21-22, Beh\u00e1 says, speaking of his own 'Manifestation,' \"When the Light of the horizons shone forth from the horizon of Ir\u00e1k.\" By Ir\u00e1k Beh\u00e1 in his writings always means Baghdad, so that we are led to infer from this passage that his 'Manifestation' took place there. In the Traveller's Narrative we are told that it did take place there (vol. ii, p. 63, vol. i, p. 80-81), and further (loc. cit. and vol. ii, p. 55) that it took place in the month of Mu\u1e25arram in the year A.H. 1269 (Oct. 15-Nov. 13, A.D. 1852), which statement appears impossible, inasmuch as Beh\u00e1 was arrested in August, 1852, and imprisoned for four months at Teher\u00e1n ere he was suffered to depart to Baghdad. Nabil, on the contrary, in the chronological poem published in my second paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds, in the J.R.A.S. for 1889 (pp. 983-990), says that Beh\u00e1's manifestation took place at Adrianople when he was 50 years old. As Beh\u00e1 was born on the second of Mu\u1e25arram A.H. 1233 (Nov. 12th, A.D. 1817), he would attain his fiftieth year in Mu\u1e25arram A.H. 1283 (May-June A.D. 1866). Amongst the Beh\u00e1'\u00eds themselves, then, there is as much as fourteen years difference as to the date of so important an event as the 'Manifestation' or annunciation of the divine mission of Beh\u00e1! How can we account for this discrepancy, and which date must we accept as the more probable?\nThe facts, so far as they are yet known, are these. The *S\u016bratu\u2019l-Mul\u016bk*, the *S\u016bra-i-Heykal*, the *Kit\u00e1b-i-Akdas*, and, in short, all the writings wherein Beh\u00e1 clearly advances a claim to supremacy, contain internal evidence to prove that they were not written before the Adrianople period. The *\u012a\u2019k\u0101n*, which is the only one of Beh\u00e1\u2019s works certainly known to have been written at Baghdad, contains no declaration of such a claim. On the contrary, it is entirely filled with praises of the B\u00e1b, and arguments in favour of his religion; the Bey\u00e1n is throughout spoken of as the last revelation; and there is no hint of any idea in Beh\u00e1\u2019s mind of claiming the supremacy, save the expression of a hope that the \u201cpeople of the Bey\u00e1n\u201d will not in their turn become as obdurate against new Truth as were the Muhammadans. Immediately after the expression of this hope, Beh\u00e1 complains of the envy and aversion wherewith certain persons (presumably B\u00e1bis) regard him, which secret envy and aversion on the part of pretended friends are, he says, far harder to bear than the open persecution of declared enemies. He adds that he never sought precedence over any one in any matter; that soon after his arrival in Baghdad he voluntarily retired alone into the solitude of the deserts to avert discord and strife; that he remained in this seclusion for two years, and only abandoned it at the command of his chief [evidently *Subh-i-Ezel*]; and that since his return, which took place two years previously, he had experienced such unkind treatment that nothing would induce him to remain at Baghdad save the reflection that he too might be called upon to lay down his life for the B\u00e1b. Now, according to Nabil\u2019s poem (stanza 6), Beh\u00e1 returned to Baghdad from his two years\u2019 retirement at the age of forty, i.e. in A.H. 1272\u20133 (A.D. 1856), so that the *\u012a\u2019k\u0101n* must have been concluded (for the passages referred to above occur at the end of the book) in A.D. 1858. We have, therefore, the best of reasons for believing that, during the first half of the Baghdad period at any rate, Beh\u00e1 still fully acknowledged, in appearance at least, the supremacy of\n\u015eubh-i-Ezel; and consequently we must regard the early date given for his 'Manifestation' in the Traveller's Narrative as fictitious. The evidence, in short, as far as it goes, entirely accords with the assertion of the Ezeli historian (in the Hasht Bihisht) that Beh\u00e1's claim was first publicly advanced in Adrianople. Now the author of the Traveller's Narrative, who may very probably have been one of Beh\u00e1's own sons, and who, at any rate, wrote under his immediate sanction, and had every means of ascertaining the facts, must have known this, and must therefore have deliberately and purposely antedated the 'Manifestation.' His reason for so doing is, I think, not far to seek. He desires to curtail as far as possible both the extent and the duration of \u015eubh-i-Ezel's authority, and to give colour to his assertion that Beh\u00e1 was from the first recognized by the B\u00e1b as that Greater Deliverer whose advent he announced.\n\nHaving accounted for the (according to him) temporary and nominal supremacy of \u015eubh-i-Ezel by describing it (T.N. ii, pp. 62\u20133) as a precautional measure designed to divert attention and danger from Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h during his continuance in Persian territory, he is compelled, in order that his theory may appear consistent with facts, to represent this supremacy as ceasing on the arrival of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h at Baghdad.\n\nI have had occasion to refer several times to the little chronological poem of Nabil's, which I published with a translation in the J.R.A.S. for 1889 (pp. 983\u2013990). Baron Rosen has found reason to doubt the accuracy of the date therein given for the arrival of the B\u00e1bi exiles at Adrianople. Commenting on a passage in Beh\u00e1's Persian letter to the Sult\u00e1n of Turkey (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 218), in which the sojourn of the B\u00e1bis at Adrianople is described as having lasted six years, he says: \"Ce renseignement est important. B\u00e9h\u00e1 dit positivement que le s\u00e9jour des secretaires \u00e0 Andrinople a dur\u00e9 six ann\u00e9es. Leur d\u00e9part forc\u00e9 de cette ville ayant eu lieu, d'apr\u00e8s le po\u00e8me chronologique publi\u00e9 par M. Browne, II. 984; cf. I. 525, en Ao\u00fbt, 1868, ils ont d\u00fb \u00eatre intern\u00e9s \u00e0 Andrinople en 1862, et non en 1864, comme\nle veut le po\u00e8me cit\u00e9. La date du d\u00e9part est confirm\u00e9e par une d\u00e9p\u00eache du g\u00e9rant du consulat de Russie \u00e0 Andrinople dat\u00e9e du 26 Ao\u00fbt, 1868. Elle confirme en m\u00eame temps la date de l\u2019arriv\u00e9e, car il y est dit que le gouvernement turc en 1862 fut contraint d\u2019interner les \u00e9migr\u00e9s b\u00e2bys, et qu\u2019Andrinople fut choisi \u00e0 cet effet. La diff\u00e9rence n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s-consid\u00e9rable, mais elle prouve que la chronologie du petit po\u00e8me de Nabil n\u2019est pas rigoureuse.\u201d\n\nBaron Rosen\u2019s discovery of this official document is an important one, and, as regards the date of departure, it is confirmed by the State papers of the Cyprus government (see T.N. ii, Note w, especially p. 378, n. 2). According to one of these, the ferm\u00e1n of banishment was dated July 26th, 1868; while in another, the date of \u015euh-i-Ezel\u2019s arrival in the Island is given as September 5th, 1868. According to Nabil\u2019s poem, Beh\u00e1 reached Acre on August 31st of the same year, so that the approximate date of departure from Adrianople may be regarded as absolutely certain. The date of arrival at Adrianople is much more difficult to determine. It is true that, in the passage noted by Baron Rosen, Beh\u00e1 describes the period of his sojourn there as six years, but then in the chronological table, prepared for M. Toumansky, by the B\u00e1b\u00eds of Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 252), the duration of that period is stated as \u201cabout 5 years.\u201d Now the dates and figures given by Beh\u00e1 can only be regarded as approximate; thus, for instance, in the Epistle to the King of Persia (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 199, last line), he says that he remained twelve years at Baghdad, while in a passage in the S\u00faratu\u2019ll-Mul\u00fck (Coll. Sc. i, p. 202, l. 18) he says eleven years. Now, taking even the lower of these figures as correct, Beh\u00e1 cannot have reached Adrianople much before the date which Nabil gives, since he only reached Baghdad some four months after the attempt on the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s life, i.e. early in A.H. 1269 (beginning of A.D. 1853). If, therefore, the date of his arrival at Adrianople was (as stated in the Russian consular deepatch) 1862, he cannot have been more than nine years at the most in Baghdad, seeing that the journey thence to Constantinople\ntook four months, and that he was detained four months more in Constantinople. Without having seen the text of the Russian consular despatch it is impossible to speak with confidence, but the easiest hypothesis seems to me to be that the Turkish government decided in 1862 to remove the B\u00e1b\u00eds from Baghdad to Adrianople, but that the actual transfer was not effected till Rajab A.H. 1280 (Dec. 1863). The data given by N\u00e1b\u00edl will admit of this construction, since it is not stated that Beh\u00e1 had attained his forty-eighth year (which he did on Mu\u1e25arram 2nd, A.H. 1281), but that he was in his forty-eighth year. This seems to me, provisionally, the best solution of the difficulty, though, perhaps, I am partly influenced by a desire to vindicate N\u00e1b\u00edl's accuracy.\n\nLack of space forbids me from noticing several other interesting passages and allusions in the first part of the S\u016bra-i-Heykal, but, before passing on, I have a few words to say about the second part, consisting of the Epistles to the Pope, Napoleon III., the late Emperor of Russia, and the Queen of England. I have collated the text of these given by Baron Rosen (Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 172\u2013192) with the text of my Kirm\u00e1n MS. (containing the whole of the first two and part of the third Epistles) and with the separate transcript which I received from Sh\u00edr\u00e1z of the Epistle to the Queen of England. Baron Rosen's text is, on the whole, much the best; though, apart from mere careless omissions and mistakes occurring in my MS., the agreement is very close, and the only variant afforded by my text which seems to me worth mentioning is \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0644\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u0649 on p. 177 at the beginning of line 21. Baron Rosen has seen that his text requires emendation here, but conjectures \u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0649.\n\nTwo more points remain to be discussed, and I pass on from the S\u016bra-i-Heykal. They are these:\u2014(1) Were the four Epistles which constitute the second part of it written at the same time as the first part, or are they to be regarded as a later appendage? (2) What chronological relation subsists between the S\u016bra-i-Heykal and the three long\nEpistles (to the Sh\u00e1h of Persia, the late Sultan of Turkey, and the \"Ra'\u00eds,\" which follow it in the MS. described by Baron Rosen? These questions I propose to discuss together as briefly as possible.\n\nWe have seen (p. 282 supra) that the Epistle to the King of Persia purports to have been written before Beh\u00e1 left Adrianople, but after he knew that he was to be transferred to Acre. This fixes the date of its composition pretty closely, since on the one hand the ferm\u00e1n of banishment bore as its date July 26, 1868 (and Beh\u00e1 can hardly have been made acquainted with the intentions of the Turkish government before this), and on the other hand Beh\u00e1 was at Acre ere September of that year had yet begun. Though the Epistle may very likely have been finished at Acre, it must have been begun, therefore, in August, 1868.\n\nOf the four Epistles comprised in the second portion of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal it is only in the Letter to the Queen of England that I can find any internal evidence of the date of composition. This begins:\u2014\"O Queen in London! Hear the voice of thy Lord, the King of creation, from the Divine Lote-tree: 'There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise.' Lay aside [all] that is on the earth, and adorn the head of dominion with the diadem of celebration of thy Glorious Lord: verily He hath entered into the world in His most great Glory, and what was recorded in the Gospel hath been fulfilled. The land of Syria hath been honoured by the approach of its Lord, the King of men... etc.\" These concluding words seem too definite to allow us to suppose that they were written elsewhere than at Acre.\n\nThe Persian Epistle addressed apparently to Sult\u00e1n 'Abdu'l-'Aziz must also have been written at Acre, inasmuch as it contains a detailed description of the arrival of the B\u00e1bis and their inhospitable reception at that place.\n\nThe La\u00fah-i-Ra'\u00eds contains certain expressions and allusions which seem to indicate that it too was written at Acre. These are as follows:\n(P. 226, ll. 6\u201313). \u201cO Dove! Hear the most glorious Voice [nidda\u2019al-abh\u00e1] in this night wherein the captains of war\u00b9 assembled over us, and let us rejoice greatly. O would that our blood might be shed on the surface of the earth in God\u2019s way, and that we might be cast upon the dust, for this is my desire and the desire of him who had me in view and who hath ascended into my most wondrous and marvellous kingdom.\u00b2 Know that one morning we found the friends of God in the hands of the malignants: the troops had occupied all the gates, and forbade men from entering or going forth, and were of the oppressors. And the friends of God and His family were left during the first night without food: thus was it ordained unto those for whom was created the world and what is therein.\u201d\n\nThe words italicized in the above passage appear to refer to the arrival of Beh\u00e9 and his followers at Acre, which is described in very similar words in the Persian Epistle to Sult\u00e1n \u2018Abdu\u2019l-\u2018Az\u00edz as follows:\n\n(P. 218, ll. 13\u201318.) \u201cAnd after [our] arrival [at Acre] the captains of war [or zaptiehs, as above] encompassed all [the B\u00e1b\u00eds], men and women, small and great, and lodged all in the soldiers\u2019 barracks. On the first night they kept them all without food or drink, for the zaptiehs had occupied the gate of the barracks and prevented all from going out, while none bethought himself of these poor people, so that they even craved water and none responded. Some while has [now] passed, and all are [still] imprisoned in the barracks.\u201d\n\nAgain in the Lawh-i-Ra\u2019\u00eds we have the following passage, apparently referring to an incident of the voyage from Gallipoli to Acre:\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps we should rather translate \u201czaptiehs\u201d or \u201cmilitary police.\u201d\n\u00b2 The B\u00e1b appears to be meant.\n(P. 229, l. 7 et seq.) \"Thank God for that He hath helped thee [to attain] to His knowledge, and caused thee to be beside Him on the day whereon the infidels encompassed the people of God and His saints and drove them forth from their houses with evident injustice, and desired to effect a separation between us on the shore of the sea . . .\" Unless I am much mistaken the incident referred to is that described at B. i, p. 516 and T.N. i, pp. 126\u20137, and ii, pp. 100\u2013101 and footnotes.\n\nWe may therefore fairly conclude that the La'uh-i-Ra'is also was written at Acre soon after Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's arrival there. It contains several interesting allusions, some of which are at present not clear to me. One of these (p. 226, ll. 20\u201321), which I formerly (B. i, pp. 962\u20133 and n. 1 on the latter) regarded, without due reflection, as an allusion to the death of the 'Martyrs of Isfah\u00e1n,' must refer to some other event, since this took place several years subsequently to the date to which the Epistle must be referred. The allusion (p. 226, l. 18) to \"one of the friends who sacrificed himself to myself, and, for love of God, cut his throat with his own hand,\" seems to be to H\u00e1j\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad Ja'far of Tabr\u00edz (T.N. ii, pp. 100\u2013101, and n. 1 on former, and B. i, p. 516); and it is probably the same person who is addressed (p. 227, l. 15) as \u0627\u0650\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0630\u064e\u0628\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc. This conjecture (which I regard as almost a certainty) suggests another, which I offer as a mere hypothesis. The latter part of the La'uh-i-Ra'is (p. 226 seq.) is addressed, not to the infidel \"Ra'is,\" but to some believer, concerning whom we gather (1) that he had come to visit Beh\u00e1 at Adrianople \"on the day whereon the fire of injustice was kindled and the raven of separation croaked\"\u00b9 (p. 227, ll. 9\u201310) and had been with him as a \"partner\" in his \"afflictions on the night wherein the hearts of the believers were troubled\"; (2) that he had \"entered in\" [to Adrianople] \"in love for\" Beh\u00e1, and\n\n\u00b9 i.e. as I suppose, when the final breach occurred between Beh\u00e1 and Ezel. (See pp. 296\u20137 supra).\nhad \"gone out\" at his \"command\" (p. 227, ll. 11-12); (3) that his heart was \"melted with separation from God\" (sc. Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h), in which, however, he is enjoined to be patient, for he shall again stand in Beh\u00e1's presence and converse with him (p. 227, ll. 20-22); that he had borne grievous affliction for Beh\u00e1's sake \"the like of which few men have borne\" (p. 228, l. 8); and that he had written to Beh\u00e1 a letter to which this is an answer (p. 228, ll. 18-19, and p. 229, l. 12). I think that no one who, bearing these points in mind, reads (at pp. 493-5 of B. i.) the account given to me by H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u1e24\u2014\u2014, the B\u00e1b\u00ed missionary whom I met at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, of the circumstances which led to his banishment and that of his colleague H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u1e24\u2014\u2014 'Al\u00ed to Khart\u00fam, will fail to see that these circumstances accord singularly well with the hypothesis that the latter part of this Epistle is addressed to one of these two missionaries. Thus (1) they went to Adrianople to visit Beh\u00e1 \"about 1866 . . . before he was sent to Acre\"; (2) on leaving \"they were instructed (by Beh\u00e1) to proceed to Cairo to . . . avert a threatened schism\" (i.e. in all probability, to persuade the B\u00e1bis there to reject \u0160uhb-i-Ezel and accept Beh\u00e1). They travelled thither with H\u00e1j\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad Ja'far of Tabr\u00edz, who cut his throat \"for love of God\" (cf. T. N. ii, p. 100, n. 1). On their arrival there, they were arrested and exiled to Khart\u00fam, where for some time they could neither ascertain whither Beh\u00e1 had been removed from Adrianople, nor find means of communicating with him. At length, however, they succeeded in sending a letter to Beh\u00e1, from whom after some time they received an answer \"telling them that they would shortly be released and rejoin him at Acre\" (B. i, p. 494), which actually occurred some time later.\n\nHaving thus examined such passages in the Epistles included in and connected with the S\u00fara-i-Heykal as throw\n\n---\n\n1 I mention this point because if, as I have conjectured above, H\u00e1j\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad Ja'far be addressed in the words \u064c\u064d\u064c\u064d\u060c it is natural enough that he should be associated in Beh\u00e1's mind with the missionaries who were his fellow-travellers.\nlight on the date of their composition, I may, I think, conclude\u2014\n\n(1) That the Epistle to the King of Persia was at any rate begun at Adrianople about August, 1868, when Beh\u00e1 first learned that the Turkish Government had decided to send him to Acre.\n\n(2) That the Persian Epistle to Sultan \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Az\u00edz and the La\u00fah-i-Ra\u2019\u00eds were written at Acre.\n\n(3) That the Epistle to the Queen of England was also written at Acre.\n\nIf I am correct in these conclusions, either the different portions of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, in the more limited sense of the term were not written at the same time but were subsequently put together in this form,\u00b9 or the whole S\u00fara-i-Heykal was composed at a later date than the Epistle to the King of Persia, and this would therefore properly stand first in order, as it does in my Kirm\u00e1n MS. It seems to me not unlikely that the Epistles to the Pope, the Emperor of the French, and the Czar of Russia were written at Acre about the same time as the Epistle to the Queen of England; and that the first half of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, addressed to the B\u00e1b\u00ed church, was composed at Adrianople soon after the schism took place. Beh\u00e1, after formally advancing his claim and rejecting \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel\u2019s supremacy, almost must have addressed to the B\u00e1bis in Persia and elsewhere whom he desired to win over to his cause a circular letter of some sort. What more likely from its general drift and nature than that the first half of the S\u00fara-i-Heykal should be this circular letter?\n\nHaving already devoted so much space to the S\u00fara-i-Heykal, I must necessarily forego, for the present, the pleasure of giving as full an account of the remaining\n\n\u00b9 The possibility of such recension or re-arrangement must always be borne in mind. That the sanctity of the sacred texts is now considered to be violated by the publication of a \u201crevised version\u201d is clearly shown by the very considerable alterations and suppressions made in the text of the Epistle to the King of Persia by the author of the Traveller\u2019s Narrative.\nletters included in the MS. described by Baron Rosen as their great interest merits. A brief notice of each must suffice for the present.\n\nIV. The Persian Epistle to the Sultan of Turkey.\n\n(Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 217-224).\n\nOf all the documents published by Baron Rosen this is, perhaps, the most interesting, since it contains a pretty circumstantial account of several incidents connected with the transference of Beh\u00e1 and his followers from Adrianople to Acre, and the treatment they underwent during the early days of their sojourn at the latter place. Many of the details which Beh\u00e1 here gives are fully confirmed by the information which I was able to obtain in Cyprus from official documents and other sources. Thus Beh\u00e1 says (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 219, ll. 1-2), that he and his followers thrice changed ship between Gallipoli and Acre, and Subh-i-Ezel informed me that he and the other B\u00e1bis were brought from Adrianople to Gallipoli, put on board ships, conveyed to Alexandria, and there transhipped into vessels bound for their respective places of exile (see T.N. i, p. 101, n. 1). Beh\u00e1 also mentions that four of his followers were separated from him and taken elsewhere, and that one of them, named \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Ghaff\u00e1r, threw himself into the sea. Confirmation of this statement is afforded by the Cyprus official records, which show that four of Beh\u00e1\u2019s followers, to wit, the above-mentioned \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Ghaff\u00e1r, together with Mushk\u00edn Kalam, Sheykh \u2018Al\u00ed Sayy\u00e1h, and Mu\u1e25ammad B\u00e1k\u00edr, were sent to Famagusta with Subh-i-Ezel (cf. B. i, p. 516, and T.N. ii, pp. 376-389). The independent corroboration of Beh\u00e1\u2019s statements thus afforded gives us confidence in the other details which he mentions\u2014the imprisonment of himself and his followers in the barracks at Acre, the hardships to which they were subjected, the badness of the bread supplied to them, the message to the Sultan given by Beh\u00e1 at Gallipoli to the Turkish colonel \u2018Omar, to whose custody\nhe was entrusted, etc. Beh\u00e1 mentions, amongst other things, that most of his followers were ill from the confinement to which they were subjected; that two had died soon after their arrival; and that the Turks would not suffer their bodies to be buried until a certain sum of money was paid. Is it not possible that the deaths here alluded to are those of the Khayy\u00e1t-b\u00e1shi and H\u00e1j\u00ed Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, who, as the Ezel\u00eds declare (T.N. ii, p. 362), were assassinated by the Beh\u00e1\u00eds in the caravansary of the corn-sellers and buried in quicklime under the platform? If so, we may hope that the version contained in this Epistle is the true one, and that the suspicions of the Ezel\u00eds are unfounded.\n\nThe Epistle also contains (pp. 220\u2013221) a rather fine description of a puppet-show which Beh\u00e1 saw as a child in Teher\u00e1n. In simple and graphic language he describes the sense of wonder and admiration produced in his young mind by the mimic pageant. Then he continues (p. 221, ll. 4\u201310): \"The audience [of the mimic Sultan] came to an end, and they drew the curtain of the tent. Twenty minutes later a man emerged from the tent carrying a box under his arm. I asked him what the box contained, and what the pageant was. He told me that all these things, exhibited together with their accessories, which I had seen, and the nobles, the ministers, the splendour, the pomp, power, and majesty which I had beheld were now in the box. And by my Lord who created all things by a word on His part, from that day forth all the things of the world have appeared and do appear in my eyes even as that [mimic] pageant, neither have they had, nor will they have, so much consideration as a grain of mustard-seed.\" Allusion is made to a \"great fire, which burnt most of the city\" [probably Constantinople], and a fierce plague which broke out\u2014these events being regarded by Beh\u00e1 as Divine chastisements for the Sultan's unbelief and hard-heartedness. We, for our part, may regard them as points which may help to determine more closely the date when the Epistle was written.\nV. THE EPISTLE OF F\u00da\u2019\u00c1D P\u00c1SH\u00c1.\n\n(Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 231\u20133.)\n\nI have already (p. supra) given my reasons for believing that the person whose death Beh\u00e1 exultingly celebrates in this document was F\u00fa\u2019\u00e1d P\u00e1sh\u00e1. An additional reason for this belief I find in the following passage (p. 232, ll. 16\u201320), which, as it seems to me, contains a punning allusion to the P\u00e1sh\u00e1\u2019s name:\n\n\u0643\u0630\u0627\u0643 \u0627\u062e\u0630\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0642\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0643\u0628 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0639\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0634 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629 \u0634\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0647\u0644 \u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u063a\u0631 \u062a\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0647\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u063a\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0624\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u0647 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0630\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0646\u062e\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0648\u0639\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u0643\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0646\u0643\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0645 *\n\n\u201cThus did we overtake him with vengeance on Our part: verily thy Lord is stern in chastisement. An angel called to him from the right hand of the Throne: \u2018These are ruthless angels: hast thou whither thou may\u2019st flee?\u2019 It was answered: \u2018[No,] save Hell, wherewith the heart [F\u00fa\u2019\u00e1d] boils.\u2019 To meet his soul came forth the tormenting angels. It was said: \u2018This is Hell, wherewith thou wert threatened in the Book, and which thou wert wont to deny in the nights and in the days.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe whole Epistle affords a fine specimen of Beh\u00e1\u2019s comminatory style, but this one extract must for the present suffice.\n\nOf the two other Epistles contained in this precious MS. the first (Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 233\u20135) is in Persian, and presents no remarkable features of interest. The second (pp. 235\u2013243) is of great interest, but also, as Baron Rosen points out, of singular obscurity and difficulty. It contains Beh\u00e1\u2019s answer to one of the B\u00e1b\u2019s original apostles, or \u201cLetters of the Living,\u201d who had asked certain questions touching\nthe nature of the \"First Point\" (i.e. the B\u00e1b). I cannot better describe the letter than by quoting Baron Rosen's own words:\u2014\"Cette pi\u00e8ce est la derni\u00e8re du recueil et donne des explications qui seraient tr\u00e8s satisfaisantes si elles \u00e9taient plus claires. Telles qu'elles sont donn\u00e9es par B\u00e9h\u00e2, elles ont grandement besoin d'un commentaire. Ce qu'on voit bien, c'est que B\u00e9h\u00e2 r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la question un peu malgr\u00e9 lui. Mais il ne pouvait l'\u00e9viter, car le curieux, cette fois, \u00e9tait un membre de 'la premi\u00e8re Unit\u00e9,' une des 'Lettres du Vivant': 'Si tu n'\u00e9tais pas de la premi\u00e8re Unit\u00e9,' lisons-nous, 'je te punirais, car tu as pos\u00e9 une question concernment Dieu, qui t'a cr\u00e9\u00e9, qui t'a nourri, qui t'a tu\u00e9 et qui t'a ressuscit\u00e9 dans ton corps ici pr\u00e9sent par le Point de l'Exposition pendant cette manifestation unique dans son essence.' B\u00e9h\u00e2, il faut bien le dire, s'est tir\u00e9 d'affaire avec une adresse admirable. La r\u00e9ponse est un v\u00e9ritable chef-d'\u0153uvre de phrases bien sonnantes, tr\u00e8s \u00e9difiantes, tr\u00e8s respectueuses envers le B\u00e1b, mais en m\u00eame temps tr\u00e8s peu pr\u00e9cises.\"\n\nI have only one remark to make on this piece, or rather on a note appended to it by Baron Rosen. He says (p. 242, n. 1), alluding to a passage in the text:\u2014\"Cette date est singuli\u00e8re. L'an 1270 correspond \u00e0 1853/4. Le texte para\u00eet faire allusion \u00e0 la manifestation du B\u00e1b, mais la date s'y oppose.\" The solution of the difficulty is that the B\u00e1b, as I pointed out in B. i, p. 507, generally dates the commencement of his mission, not from the flight of the Prophet (hijra), but from the time when he was first commissioned to preach the doctrine of Isl\u00e1m, which time he places ten years earlier. Many passages in proof of this might be adduced from the Persian Bey\u00e1n, but one (the same which I previously quoted) will suffice.

Toumansky, a young artillery officer, who had spent some months at \u2018Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d during the summer of 1890, with the intention of entering into relations with the B\u00e1bi community there (which, as it appears, is pretty numerous), and learning more of the history, condition, doctrines, and literature of the sect. His plans were crowned with the fullest measure of success; he was welcomed effusively by the B\u00e1bis of \u2018Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d, and received from them a rich store of information, books, and photographs. The MSS. which he obtained were as follows:\n\n(1) The T\u00e1rikh-i-Jadid, described by me in B. i, p. 496, B. ii, pp. 1002\u20133, and, more fully, at pp. 192-7 of vol. ii. of the Traveller\u2019s Narrative. Baron Rosen remarks (Coll. Sc. vi, p. 244) that according to the B\u00e1bis of \u2018Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d this work was composed by M\u00e1nakj\u00ed, who, till lately, acted as representative of the Zoroastrians of Bombay at Teher\u00e1n, and watched over the interests of their down-trodden brethren of Persia. As he died about a year ago, I may now say,\nwithout indiscretion, that I too heard from many B\u00e1b\u00eds that he was the author of the work in question, though by some it was asserted that his mirz\u00e1, or secretary, had a considerable share in its production. I have lately had occasion to go through the whole work again (having already transcribed and collated it throughout) and to make a translation of it, which I hope soon to publish, and my estimate of its value is increased, inasmuch as many of the events which it chronicles appear either to have been copied from a work composed by H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n (who suffered martyrdom at Teher\u00e1n in A.D. 1852), or to have been supplied by eye-witnesses.\n\n(2) An Epistle called \u0645\u0642\u0635\u0648\u062f \u0648\u062c\u0648\u0647, with commentary, dealing mainly with ethical questions.\n\n(3) Two most interesting Epistles from Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the first addressed to the B\u00e1b\u00eds of 'Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d in particular, the second to the B\u00e1b\u00ed church generally. Both of these Epistles (of which the text is given in full by Baron Rosen) refer to and were called forth by the following strange episode, which, as Baron Rosen affirms, created a certain sensation even at St. Petersburg.\n\n\"On September 8th, 1889, at 7 a.m., two Persians, Mash-had\u00ed 'Al\u00ed Akbar and Mash-had\u00ed Huseyn, both fanatical Shi'ites, hurled themselves, dagger in hand, on a certain H\u00e1j\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad R\u00edz\u00e1, of Isfah\u00e1n, who was peaceably traversing one of the most frequented streets of 'Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d, and inflicted on him 72 wounds, to which he succumbed. H\u00e1j\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad R\u00edz\u00e1 was one of the most respected of the B\u00e1b\u00eds of 'Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d. The crime was perpetrated with such audacity, that neither the numerous witnesses of the tragedy, nor the constable who was present, were able to save the victim of this abominable attack. They yielded themselves up to the police without offering any resistance. They were placed in a cab for conveyance to the prison; during the journey they fell to licking up the blood which dripped from their daggers. The trial, conducted with much energy by the military tribunal, gave as its result that Mu\u1e25ammad R\u00edz\u00e1 had fallen a victim to the religious\nfanaticism of the Shi'ites, who feared his influence; those of 'Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d, acting on the orders of Mull\u00e1s who had come for this purpose from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, resolved to put a stop to the B\u00e1b\u00ed propaganda by killing H\u00e1j\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u00e1. But, knowing very well that the crime would not remain unpunished, they drew lots to determine who should sacrifice themselves for the Shi'ite cause. Thus it was that the persons above mentioned became the assassins of Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u00e1, who had done them no harm. The sentence of the tribunal was severe\u2014'Al\u00ed Akbar and \u1e24useyn, together with two of their accomplices, were condemned to be hanged, but the death-penalty was commuted, by His Imperial Majesty, to hard labour for life.\n\n\"This sentence was hailed by the B\u00e1bis with an enthusiasm easy to understand. It was the first time since the existence of the sect, i.e. for nearly fifty years, that a crime committed on the person of an adherent of the new religion had been punished with the utmost rigour of the law. The impression produced on the chief of the sect, Beh\u00e1, appears to have been equally profound. The two \"revelations\" which we shall submit to the reader sufficiently prove this. They are also interesting from another point of view: they are almost the only B\u00e1b\u00ed documents of which we can understand all the meanings, all the allusions.\"\n\nThe documents in question are indeed full of interest, but I must necessarily limit myself to translating one extract from the first of them, which is addressed to the B\u00e1bis of Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d in general, and to one of them named 'Abdu'l-Kar\u00edm of Ardabil in particular.\n\n(P. 249, l. 2). . . \"Your deeds have rejoiced me, and your patience in affliction. Ye were slain and did not slay. . . Ye have done that whereby the breaths of patient suffering are diffused through creation. In truth the Glorious State [of Russia] (may God strengthen it!) hath displayed justice, and justice is the cause of the supremacy, majesty, and power of Kings. Well is it with him who is\nadorned therewith, and hath drunk of its cup, and hath been illuminated with its effulgences! This society [i.e. the B\u00e1b\u00eds] must unceasingly regard this condition. God (glorious is His Glory!) hath ever loved and doth love constancy, and in diverse epistles hath enjoined it on all. This succour on the part of the Glorious State [of Russia] and this manifestation of justice and equity will, please God, obliterate the injustice and violence of the world. We enjoin it on this society not to forget this [act of] justice, and to pray God from the bottom of their hearts to perpetuate and render permanent the works of him who holds the standard of justice by the maintenance of [his] dominion and power...\u201d\n\n(4) Five loose leaves, containing:\u2014(a) A poem of 72 verses, praising the Emperor of Russia for his justice in punishing the assassins of Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u00e1; (b) Two religious poems by a B\u00e1b\u00ed poet named R\u016b\u1e25\u00e1n\u00ed, whom M. Toumansky thinks may be identical with the poet mentioned by me in B. ii, p. 1008. (c) Another religious poem beginning:\u2014\u0637\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0633\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a \u0643\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062c\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064c \u062d\u064e\u0642\u064c\u0651 \u0634\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064c \u064a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0648\u0652. This poem is included in a small MS. of B\u00e1b\u00ed miscellanies copied for me at Kirm\u00e1n, and since Baron Rosen only gives the first beyt, and even this offers no less than three variants from my text, I shall publish the whole in the Appendix to this article. If I remember aright I was told that Nabil was the author of it, but it is evidently modelled on the two poems, written in the same rhyme and metre (K\u00e1mil-i-muthamman-i-s\u00e1lim), which tradition ordinarily ascribes to Kurratu\u2019l-\u2018Ayn. Of these two poems I have published the text and translation (the first in B. ii, pp. 936\u20137 and 991; the second in vol. ii. of the Traveller\u2019s Narrative, pp. 314\u20136), and I cannot deny myself the pleasure of adding to them this further specimen of the B\u00e1b\u00ed poetic genius. (d) An account of the B\u00e1b\u00ed law of heritage, the division of the year, and the names of the months, drawn up for M. Toumansky by the B\u00e1b\u00eds of\nIshk\u00e1b\u00e1d. (e) A short chronological notice of the principal events in the lives of the B\u00e1b and Beh\u00e1, also prepared for M. Toumansky. To this I have already had occasion to allude (p. supra).\n\n(5) A copy of the Bombay lithographed edition of the B\u00e1b\u00ed work mentioned by me in B. ii, p. 944, as Muduniyyat (\"Civilization\"). Its full title is given by Baron Rosen as \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0636\u0629 \u0644\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629. At the end of this is given the text of an Epistle in pure Persian, free from all admixture of Arabic, written by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h to a follower of the Zoroastrian faith. Of this epistle, and of another similar one, I obtained copies at Acre which are now amongst my MSS. One of them, if not both, was addressed, as I was informed, to the late M\u00e1nakj\u00ed (already mentioned as the author of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd), whose full name appears to have been M\u00e1nakj\u00ed Limj\u00ed Hadarja, and who came from India to Persia in the summer of 1854.\n\nI have now completed my notice of Baron Rosen's most valuable contribution to our knowledge of B\u00e1biism. Lengthy as this notice is, I have had to omit much of which I should like to have spoken; yet, I trust, I have sufficiently made clear the extreme value of the materials which he has made accessible to scholars, and the exceptional claim which he has on the gratitude of all Orientalists.\n\n1 See Z.D.M.G. for 1881, vol. xxxv, p. 328.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nI.

VIII.\u2014Four Cuneiform Texts. By S. Arthur Strong, M.A.\n\nI.\n\n(a.)\n\nOf A\u0161\u0161urb\u0113lkala, son and successor of the first Tiglath-pileser, we know little. The so-called synchronous history devotes a few lines to his reign, from which, however, we learn nothing more than that in his time the peoples of Assyria and Babylon were united in the bonds of friendship and alliance, and that he took to wife a Babylonian lady, daughter of the upstart Ramm\u0101napluiddinna, King of Babylon (W. A. I., ii. 65, 25). Two only of A\u0161\u0161urb\u0113lkala\u2019s inscriptions seem to have come down to us. Of these the more important runs in seven partly defaced lines across the back of a nude female torso carved in stone a little under life-size. This monument\u2014of the highest interest from an archaeological point of view\u2014was found at Kouyunjik, and is now preserved (No. 849) in the British Museum.\n\nThe first three lines of the inscription present the remains of the genealogy of the king. Then follow two mutilated and extremely obscure lines, and the closing words invoke the vengeance of the gods of Martu upon whosoever shall alter the name and writing.\n\nThat an Assyrian king should thus make a public appeal to the gods of the Amorites\u00b9 is in itself remarkable; but it is not more so than the style of the figure considered as a work of art. The type, it is true, will not appear very select to those accustomed to Greek models; but the forms of the female nude have evidently been carefully studied,\n\n\u00b9 See below.\nand are reproduced with an emphasis which in parts approaches exaggeration.\n\nNow it is in the representation of the draped human form that the Assyrian artists may be said to have excelled. Their freedom of treatment, however, was confined within the limits of a convention that had become fixed at a comparatively early date, and was followed for centuries without material modification. For instance, the bas-reliefs of Assurbanipal present, roughly speaking, the same characteristics as those of Assurnasirpal. In both we admire the picturesque composition of a variety of incidents, and the vigour and naturalness of the representation of motion; but the later artists have not advanced far beyond their predecessors in the direction of freedom and realism; there is nothing to suggest that an interval of two centuries lies between them. Moreover, the nude never appears prominently in Assyrian sculpture. Occasionally, as on the bronze gates of Balawat, we see a row of impaled captives garnishing the wall of a conquered town; but the fancy of a naked goddess occurred but rarely to the formal Assyrians. In fact, the attenuated and closely-draped Istar, who appears on cylinder-seals and, more rarely, on bas-reliefs, would hardly be recognized as a goddess at all, if it were not for her accompanying symbols.\u00b9\n\nThese considerations suggest\u2014though they do not involve\u2014the conclusion that we have here to deal with the product of an art foreign in sentiment and method to that of Assyria. The fact that the name of the god whose vengeance is invoked has been obliterated must make it for ever impossible to determine with certainty the meaning and purpose of the statue; but we know that Assyrian kings\u2014Sargon, for example, and Tiglathpileser III.\u2014followed Syrian fashions\n\n\u00b9 Messrs. Perrot and Chipiez (Histoire de l'Art, ii. 505) reproduce two cylinder-seals, on which Istar is seen standing naked and emaciated in the presence of worshippers; but, in the first place, such a device is very unusual, and, in the second, the figure of the goddess bears no resemblance whatever to the statue under discussion. However, there are two little undraped figures from Nimrud (reproduced on pp. 507 and 508 of the same work), which are more in the style of the statue; but it is by no means certain either to what period they belong, or what they represent. Perrot and Chipiez take them and the statue as well for figures of Istar.\nin architecture, and it may be that influences\u2014religious as well as artistic\u2014from the same quarter have been at work here. In that case the statue may either have been made for A\u0161\u0161urb\u0113lkala on some occasion or for some purpose unknown to us, or it may have been carried away with the booty of some victorious expedition to the West to find a new shrine and new votaries in Assyria.\n\nThe inscription has been published\u2014but from a very imperfect and incorrect copy\u2014in the first volume of The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, plate 6, No. vi. I have given an amended edition based upon an independent study of the stone.\n\nTranslations have been attempted both by Oppert (Exp\u00e9dition, i. 288), and by Menant (Annales, 54); but their renderings, made from the hopelessly corrupt text of W. A. I., contain little that is certain except the king\u2019s name.\n\n**Text.**\n\n1. \u00ea-kal A\u0161\u0161ur-b\u0113l-ka-[la] . . . . . . . \u0161ar ki\u0161-[\u0161a-ti]\n2. apil Tukul-ti-apil-\u00c8-\u0161ar-ra . . . . . . .

I propose this reading with great hesitation; but for alam with the meaning \u2018image\u2019 see W.A.I. iii. 70, 52, where \u1e63a-al-mu is rendered by \u1e63a-al-mu, and cf. Arab. \u1e63a-al-mu. With regard to g\u00e2t\u0113 for k\u00e2t\u0113, the substitution of g for k (a common feature of Babylonian phonetics) is not unknown in Assyrian texts even of the first period. For example, in the great inscription of Tiglathpileser I. the forms gurunat\u0113, gurunt\u0113 (from the root \u1e63a-al-mu) occur in three places, viz. II. 21, III. 58 and IV. 19.\n\nMr. Pinches suggests the restoration of \u1e63a-al-mu before \u1e63a-al-mu.\n5. arrute I take to be the plural of arru(m) in the sense of 'curse' or 'cursing.' Cf. W.A.I. ii. 27, 30, with W.A.I. v. 30, 65\n\nmu\u1e25hi\u0161i appears to be a noun of the type from the root ma\u1e2ba\u1e63u. Both mu\u1e25hu\u0161u and mu\u1e25hu\u0161u are quoted by Strassmaier (A.V. p. 674); but in the former case he seems to have mistaken what is evidently the 3, pl. permansive ii. 1, (ina lib-bi-\u0161u-nu mu-uh-hu-\u0161u-u, 'in their midst they are smitten,' K. 680, 10) for a verbal noun of the type.\n\nWith mu\u1e25hi\u0161i ahi 'the crushing of the side (of the body)' cf. murus ahi 'the disease of the side,' with which among other plagues Istar is smitten in Hades, W.A.I. iv. 31, obv. l. 71.\n\nIt is possible that the partially defaced character after should be read.\n\n6. The name of the god Za . . . . . . , if we suppose it to have been that of an Assyrian deity, might perhaps be restored as ZA-GA-GA, which we find explained by NIN-IB, W.A.I. ii. 57, 53 and 70; but, on the whole, it seems more probable that some god of the Phoenicians (or Amorites) was referred to.\n\n7. is equivalent to the characters which have usually been read A-bhar-ri-i, and explained to mean the 'West-country,' that is Phoenicia. Both the reading and the explanation appear to be founded upon a statement made by Norris, which, however, as it stands, is far from being conclusive, viz. \"I have also a note that is 'west,' but I have mislaid the reference\" (Dict. I. 28). On the other hand, the occurrence on one of the tablets from El Amarna of the\nunequivocal form \\( \\text{A-mu-ur-ra} \\) side by side with \\( \\text{A-har-ri} \\) seems to show that at least in this case \\( \\text{A-mur-ri} \\) must be read mur (Sayce, *Records of the Past*, v. p. 98). And if this be so, suggests the further possibility that the \\( \\text{A-mur-ri} \\) (= \\( \\text{A-har-ri} \\)) of our own text should be read not \\( \\text{A-har-ri} \\), 'the land of the West,' but \\( \\text{A-mur-ri} \\), 'the land of the Amorites.'\n\nWith \\( \\text{mihi\u0161 stri} \\) 'the crushing of the back (?)' cf. the phrase \\( \\text{mah\u0161i mu\u1e2b\u1e2bi Zi} \\), which occurs in a mutilated passage of a hymn to Marduk (K. 8717 obv. l. 15), and which Br\u00fcnnow renders doubtfully by 'crushing the head of the Storm-god' (*Zeitschr.* 1890, p. 61).\n\n(b.)\n\nThe other inscription is only a fragment, and therefore, though it contains A\u0161\u0161urb\u0113lkala's name, cannot with full certainty be ascribed to him. It seems to be an address or dedication to Ramm\u0101n, and closely resembles in point of style the opening address to Ninib of the great inscription of A\u0161\u0161urnasirpal. It is published by Layard on page 73 of his volume of *Inscriptions in the Cuneiform Character* (where it is described as coming from Kalah Sherghat); but not a few of the signs have evidently been misunderstood, and, in consequence, erroneously transcribed. I have endeavoured to correct and\u2014here and there\u2014to restore the text, as follows:\n\n**Text.**\n\n1. \\( \\text{A-mu-ur-ra} \\)\n2. \\( \\text{A-har-ri} \\)\n3. \\( \\text{A-mur-ri} \\)\nTransliteration.\n\n1. a-na Ramm\u00e2ni a\u0161arid \u0161am-\u00ea ir\u0161i-t\u00ee .......\n2. \u016bm\u00ea ez-zu-t\u00ea \u0161a a-na ri-gim ......\n3. i-ru-bu ra-a\u0161 pu-ul-hi \u0161ad-lu .......\n4. nam-ri-ri ilu \u0161a ina ba-li-\u0161u puruss\u00ee \u0161am-\u00ea ir\u0161i-tim\n5. ul i\u0161-sa-ka-nu n\u00fb-ri la na-mar gab-bu ......\n6. t\u00ea-ni-s\u00ea-t\u00ea a-na mu-rim mar-ka-as \u0161am-\u00ea ir\u0161i-tim ......\n7. b\u00eali-\u0161u A\u0161\u0161ur-b\u00eal-ka-la \u0161a ilu ina puhur A\u0161\u0161ur za-kar \u0161umi-\u0161u\n8. iz-kur ma\u0161-\u0161u-u \u0161akkanak il\u00e2ni ..........\n\nTranslation.\n\n1.

Cf. the annals of A\u0161\u0161urnasirpal, W.A.I. i. 17, 3, *ilu \u0161a ina balu\u0161u purus\u0161i \u0161ami\u0113 ir\u0161itim la ipparsu*.\n\n5. *nuri la namar.* This amendment I propose with great hesitation. The form of the phrase *nuri la namar* \u2018the lights (are) without shining,\u2019 that is \u2018shine not\u2019 would be parallel to that of such familiar expressions as *rubu la \u0161anan* \u2018a prince without an equal,\u2019 *a\u0161ar la amaru* \u2018a place that is not seen.\u2019\n\n6. *ana murim,* etc. This phrase also occurs in the annals of A\u0161\u0161urnasirpal, l.c. 2. My rendering is conjectural; but that the root idea of *murim* is that of \u2018shutting\u2019 or \u2018making fast\u2019 is evident from the following glosses:\n\nW.A.I. ii. 23, 19, *mu-rim ba-a-bi=da-al-tum* (a door), l.c. 33, *mu-rim dalti=nu-ku-\u0161u-u* (the hinge?). Cf. Arab. \u0645\u0644\u0650 \u2018to twist a rope tight, mend.\u2019\n\n7. With *ina pu\u1e2bur A\u0161\u0161ur,* cf. W.A.I. i. 14, 102, *ina nap\u1e2bar mat A\u0161\u0161ur gabb\u012b.*\n\n8. *ma\u0161\u0161\u016b.* It is difficult to determine whether the *ductus literarum* points to *mass\u016b* or to *niass\u016b* as the true reading. The difference, however, appears to be only one of form. For the meaning cf. W.A.I. iv. 27, 63a, *b\u00e9lum napi\u0161ti m\u0101ti mass\u016b \u0161ami\u0113 u ir\u0161itim,* \u2018O Lord, the life of the land, the hero of heaven and earth\u2019 (Sayce, *Hibbert Lectures,* p. 498), and W.A.I. ii. 47, 15a, where *ma\u0161\u0161\u016b a\u0161aridu* is explained by *ma\u0161\u0161\u016b a\u0161aridu.*\nII.\n\nAt the end of the monolith-inscription of \u0160am\u0161i-Ramm\u0101n III., King of Assyria, there is mention made of a Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, upon whom the king, in the course of his campaign in Chald\u00e6a and Babylonia, inflicted a signal defeat. This Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, who may be inferred\u2014though he is not expressly stated\u2014to have been King of Babylon, has been generally identified with the king of the same name mentioned in the inscription before us, and\u2014in the absence of any more precise indications from other quarters\u2014we have thus a fixed point from which to determine its date more or less closely, for it was in the year 812 B.C. that \u0160am\u0161i-Ramm\u0101n made the expedition against Babylon, which ended, as it seems, with the overthrow of Marduk-balatsu-ikbi.\n\nThe inscription covers the face of a small oval black stone, evidently a land-mark. At the top are three divine emblems of the kind usually found on these monuments, while the middle of the face is adorned with a rudely executed bas-relief representing the \"dagger-bearer\" and\u2014presumably\u2014his royal patron. The lines are separated by division-marks, and the characters, with few exceptions, are as clumsily formed and executed as the figures. The text, though it runs in the conventional style, is difficult, owing to the occurrence here and there of unusual terms and expressions.\n\nThe stone was found by Mr. Rassam at Abu Habba, and is now preserved in the British Museum.\n\nText.\n\n1. \n2. \n3.\nTransliteration.\n\n1. \u0161al-mu Ramm\u00e2nu-\u00ea\u1e6dir na\u0161 pa\u1e6dri Marduk\n2. um-mat Sin \u0160am\u0161i u Nergal\n3. pa-li\u1e2b Nab\u00fb u Marduk ka-rib\n4. \u0161arri b\u00eali-\u0161u Marduk-balat-su-ik-bi\n5. apil-\u0161u rabu-u \u00eapu\u0161-ma\n6. a-na sa-at \u00fb-m\u00ea\n7. a-na zir-\u0161u u pir\u2019i-\u0161u\n8. u-kin\n9. man-nu arku-u\n10. \u0161a \u0161al-mu\n11. u nar\u00fb\n12. an-na-a\n13. ub-ba-tu\n14. lu-u ina\n15. \u0161i-pir ni-kil-tu u-\u1e25al-la-ku\n16.

Besides the ecclesiastical there was also a military order of *na\u0161 patr\u016btu*. See Jeremias in Delitzsch's *Beitr\u00e4ge*, I. p. 289, and Tallqvist, *Babylonische Schenkungsbriebe*, p. 23.\n\n2. *ummat*. The reading here is not certain, for the character which I have taken for *um* is somewhat defaced. Moreover there seems to be no other instance in Babylonian or Assyrian of *ummat, ummatu* with the meaning which from its position in the sentence it ought to have here, viz. that of 'priest' or 'worshipper.' Nevertheless, if the reading be correct, I venture to regard it as the Babylonian equivalent of the Arabic *\u0101l*, which, among other meanings, is said to have that of *sectator* and *summus sacerdos*.\n\n3. *karib* I take to be an epithet of Marduk 'the god of sacrifice,' or 'the god who blesses the sacrifice.' The word occurs several times as a divine name or epithet in the Babylonian contracts published by Peiser, and always in connection with Marduk or his temple: e.g. *i\u0161ku (ilu) karib b\u0101bi pap\u0101\u1e2bu Marduk* (*Babylonische Vertr\u00e4ge*, xxviii. 5), *p\u0101n (ilu) karibi ina Esaggil bit Marduk* (*ib. lxiii. 2). In all such cases Peiser renders it by 'Opfergott.'\n\n19. My rendering of this difficult line is only conjectural. The character which has the form of *m\u00e9* on the stone seems in reality to be the plural-sign. The reading of the character printed as *\u0161\u0101* is not quite certain, for just above it\u2014and underneath the *\u0161ar* of the preceding line\u2014there is a seemingly superfluous wedge, which, although other characters have taken unusual forms on this monument, makes it a matter of some difficulty\nto understand the intention of the scribe. However, if KIL-ME\u0160 be the true reading, it looks as if it should form a parallel to the BU-ME\u0160 which immediately precedes, and, as a matter of fact, KIL itself is quoted with the meaning of ar\u0101ku (W.A.I. iii. 61, 2, 30). For KIL as representing kab\u0101ru, kabru, see Br\u00fcnnow, List, p. 413.\n\n[The above two articles were sent in December, 1891, but their publication was unavoidably delayed.\u2014Rh. D.]\nIII.\n\nThe following inscription is on a fragment of a cylinder of clay, brought by Mr. Rassam from Babylon, and now (Rm. III. 105) in the British Museum.\n\nIt is unfortunately too mutilated to enable us to gain more than a general idea of its meaning, and the style, even of the parts which remain, is often obscure and difficult. It was written by or for a certain Nab\u00fb-\u0161umu-imbi, who, in addition to various ecclesiastical titles, calls himself \u0161akku, or governor of Borsippa.\n\nThe first column opens with an invocation, in which, in the present state of the text, it is difficult to find and follow the main thread; or to distinguish the gods directly addressed from those incidentally mentioned. We then learn that an important work (probably a dam or embankment), which the negligence of certain officers had allowed to fall into decay, was taken in hand and restored by Nab\u00fb-\u0161umu-imbi.\n\nThe narrative now passes abruptly to the main incident. In the reign of Nab\u00fb-\u0161umu-i\u0161kun, the king, son of Dakuri, the men of Babylon, in alliance, as it seems, with Chald\u00e6ans, Arameans, and the men of Dilbat, attacked the men of Borsippa, and a riot ensued, the disturbance lasting for many days. Borsippa was captured, and the house of Nab\u00fb-\u0161umu-imbi surrounded by the hostile party. Prominent in the ranks of the insurgents was the \u0161atam or judge of Ezida, Nab\u00fb-\u0161umu-iddina. In fact, it seems certain from what remains of the end of Col. I. that he must have taken advantage of the state of confusion to seize the governorship of Borsippa. Though there is not enough of the record to enable us to tell precisely how the matter ended, still the accent of gratitude and confidence that marks the final address to the gods leaves no doubt that the situation was eventually solved to the satisfaction of Nab\u00fb-\u0161umu-imbi.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The end, like the beginning, of the inscription is sadly mutilated, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the subject is a male or a female divinity.\nIn order to fix the date of these interesting events, there is one point of fact from which we can start, and that is the mention of the king Nab\u00fb-sumu-i\u0161kun. Now the only king of Babylon of that name otherwise known to us was a contemporary of Ramm\u00e2n-nir\u00e2ri II., king of Assyria, that is, he must have lived about 890 B.C., and there is nothing either in the style or in the matter of the document before us to disturb the conclusion that this is the king referred to. The fact that he is called apil Dakuri probably means simply that he came from Bit Dakuri, or the northern part of Chaldaea.\n\nIn the same way the phrase apil A\u0161\u0161ur seems to suggest that, in spite of the genuinely Babylonian ring of his name, Nab\u00fb-sumu-imbi was of Assyrian extraction. For we know that the overthrow of Nab\u00fb-sumu-i\u0161kun by Ramm\u00e2n-nir\u00e2ri was followed by a period of close intimacy and alliance between the peoples of Babylon and Assyria; and it may be that Nab\u00fb-sumu-imbi had profited by his Assyrian extraction or his Assyrian leanings, and that some such cause as this provoked the outbreak of the men of Babylon.\n\nThe inscription is now published for the first time.\n\nText.\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4.\nTransliteration.\n\nCOL.

The inscription of the dam of the wall of Ezida.\n\nNotes.\n\nCOL. I.\n\n1. For this form of Nab\u00fb see, e.g. W.A.I. iv. 20, 3, 7.\n\n2. \u0161agapurti. Cf. W.A.I. ii. 31, 62, \u1e6d-til-lum | \u0161a-ga-pi-ru.\n\n3. \u1e2ba\u0161\u0161u\u0161\u0161u is the god of the South or midday sun, according to W.A.I. ii. 57, 51c, a form of NIN-IB.\n\n7. The group \u1e2ba\u0161\u0161u\u0161\u0161u I take to be equivalent to \u1e2ba\u0161\u0161u\u0161\u0161u, which (W.A.I. iii. 67, 66c) is explained by NIN-IB \u0161a m\u0113-i\u1e2b-ri. For Zarpanit as equivalent to Er\u00fba (or Er\u00fba) see, e.g. W.A.I. ii. 54, 59e.\n\n9. With the phrase Asari aplu ri\u0161t\u00fb, W.A.I. ii. 55, 68c, where Asari is explained by \u1e2ba\u0161\u0161u\u0161\u0161u.\n\n14. \u1e2ba\u0161\u0161u\u0161\u0161u. See Delitzsch, W\u00e6terbuch, p. 191.\n\nContinuation of col. I.\n\n4. a\u0161rukkati I have translated doubtfully by dam. The text is unfortunately in too mutilated a condition to enable us to determine inferentially the nature of the work referred to. In point of form a\u0161rukkati looks like a feminine plural of a\u0161rukku, of which, however, I am acquainted with no other instance. In W.A.I. ii. 29, 69 the similar form a\u0161urrakku appears as the explanation of \u1e2ba\u0161\u0161u\u0161\u0161u and in connection with the words mul\u00fb \u2018mound,\u2019 mu\u0161palu \u2018depression,\u2019 and \u0161uplu \u2018hole.\u2019\n\n5. That ura\u0161 means some kind of garment, perhaps a head-dress or crown, is clear from the following glosses:\u2014\nW.A.I. v. 28, 60 \u1d48 mud-ru-u | u-ra-\u0161u compared with W.A.I. ii. 7, 42e \u1d48 \u1d48 (\u1d48 \u1d48 \u1d48) \u1d48- | \u0161u-bat a-ri\u0161-ti; and W.A.I. v. 28, 59 \u1d48 mud-ru-u | kar-ru compared with l.c. 10 kar-ru | \u0161u-bat a-dir-tu.\n\n7. i\u1e33up\u016bmi. The verbal forms in mi are a peculiar feature of this text. The suffix mi seems to correspond to the ni which, as a sort of modal sign, is not uncommon in verbal forms, especially in the language of the letters; but the exact meaning of which is difficult to determine or to express. Cf. e.g. K 613 rev. 23\u201328 (W.A.I. v. 54, 2), a-bu-tu \u0161a u-du-u-ni | a-na \u0161arri b\u0113li-ia | as-sa-pa-ra | \u0161arru b\u0113li | ki-i \u0161a i-la-u-ni | li-pu-u\u0161, \u2018the intelligence which I know to the king my lord I send, may the king my lord according as he wills do.\u2019 On the other hand in uk\u0101nnimi (line 13) we seem to have a combination of the elements ni and mi.\n\n10. The tu-bitu was some kind of temple official. Of the character of his functions nothing is known, though it is clear from contracts that have come down to us that certain dues were claimed by the tu-bitu as by the na\u0161-patri. See e.g. Peiser, Babylonische Vertr\u00e4ge, xci. I suggest that the characters should be read \u00e9rib bitu as the title of the priest who in the discharge of his functions introit ad altare dei.

Strassmaier, A.V. 1114, where (s.v. tumalulu) mention is quoted of (am\u0113lu) \u00e9rib bit\u016btu p\u0101n B\u0113li, etc.\n\ndu\u0161m\u016b, if that be the true reading, I propose to connect with Arab. \u062f\u0645 \u2018fat.\u2019 Cf. Heb. \u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05de\u05d5\u05b9 \u2018the opulent of the earth.\u2019\n\n12. tukku might be explained formally as the permansive II. 1 from a root tik\u00fb, whence we have the verbal noun seen in the phrases tik ri\u1e2b\u0161i (Tiglathpileser I., Col. I., 42), tik \u0161ami\u0113 (Sargon, Nimrud, 15). In each of these places, however, tik must mean\nsomething like 'stroke, impetus,' which does not throw much light on the present passage. In point of meaning the conditions of the problem would be satisfied, if we could assume a connection with the Arab. \u062a\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652 'fear of god,' \u062a\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652 'pious.' For santak in the sense of 'regular, regularly,' see J.R.A.S. (July, 1891).\n\n14. u\u0161arrimi, perhaps for u\u0161ar'i 'I laid the foundation of,' as in the phrase i\u0161isu aps\u0101 u\u0161ar'imma, Nebuchadnezzar, Col. II. 23 (Abel and Winckler, Keilschrifttexte). Cf. also A\u0161\u0161urna\u1e63irpal, II. 87, \u0113kal ina Til\u016bli u\u0161arri, which Peiser (Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek, I. p. 86) translates by 'in den Palast in Til\u016bli zog ich ein.'\n\n15 and 16. These lines are extremely difficult owing, in the first place, to the redundance of \u0161\u0101ti, and, in the second, to the obscurity of the words rip\u0101ti and \u1e63\u0101\u1e6di rih\u0101ti. I connect with the rt. rih\u0101 'to destroy.' See Zimmern, Busspsalmen, pp. 83, 93. Perhaps it should be taken closely with sihi so that the phrase would mean 'the destruction (or suppression) of the revolt.' Of \u1e63\u0101\u1e6di rih\u0101ti the reading is quite uncertain. I can only suggest that in view of Col. II. l. 7 it may be connected with lam\u016b according to the type \u0645\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644.\n\n17. ma\u1e25as gupt\u0113ti. The following gloss (W.A.I. ii. 39, 49 and 50) may throw some light on this difficult passage: gup-pu-tu (l. 50) compared with l. 49, pu-u\u1e2b-ri | pu-u\u1e2b-hu-rum. If these comparisons are valid, gupt\u0113ti would seem to be a feminine abstract with the meaning of pu\u1e2bru i.e. 'bringing together, uniting.'\n\n20. \u0161ul\u0101ti, from a root \u0161ul\u0101 (?), whence come \u0161altu, \u0161\u00e9l\u016btu \u0161iltu, to which last our form is perhaps related as \u0161ub\u0101tu to \u0161ibtu.\n6. \u0161umi seems to stand for \u0161unu. See note on Col. I. (cont.), l. 7.\n\n8. tanuk\u0101ti. Perhaps connected with tukumtu, pl. tukm\u0101t\u0113.\n\n10. The characters which I have read doubtfully as ki\u0161u\u0161\u016ba are almost obliterated. Mr. Pinches thinks that the true reading is ha\u0161u\u0161\u016ba. In either case I am unable to suggest a satisfactory explanation.\n\nCONTINUATION OF COL. II.\n\n5. lihi\u0161u. If this be the true reading, cf. the root \u1e2bl seen in the phrase ina la\u1e2b \u0113ni\u0161u, W.A.I. v. 9, 107.\n\n11. \u1e2bl \u1e2bl \u1e2bl I have read doubtfully as akurr\u012bt, regarding it as the construct of the fem. of akr\u016b, which we find explained by itlu (W.A.I. II. 1, 172\u20133) and asaridu (W.A.I. iv. 70, 17).\n\n14. I restore littaskar ab\u016btu as a phrase equivalent in meaning to the more usual li\u0161bat ab\u016btu.\n\n15. \u1e2bl is plainly to be restored after \u1e2bl.\n\n26. lu\u0161aknasi for lu\u0161akna\u0161i.\n\n28.

THE NEW BILINGUAL HITTITE INSCRIPTION.\n   Dahabiyeh Istar, Cairo,\n   Dec. 28, 1891.\n\nThe Hittite cylinder, of which the Ashmolean Museum has become the fortunate possessor, is, next to the lost boss of Tarkondemos, the most important monument of the kind yet discovered. It was found in Kilikia, and is of haematite. The figures and characters upon it are exquisitely engraved; indeed, from a merely artistic point of view, it is one of the finest cylinders with which I am acquainted. For me, however, the interest of the cylinder chiefly lies in the fact that the four Hittite hieroglyphs inscribed upon it are accompanied by three lines of cuneiform, and that this new \"bilingual\" confirms in a very gratifying way my system of Hittite decipherment.\n\nThe cuneiform characters, which resemble those found on certain of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, read \"Indisilim the son of Serdamu, the worshipper of the goddess Ikhara.\" After the cuneiform inscription come the figures of the owner of the cylinder and of a deity. The owner stands with an offering in his hand; behind the deity, who is also standing with outstretched arms, are the four Hittite hieroglyphs of which I have spoken.\n\nThe last two of them occur on another haematite seal found in Kilikia, and now in the Ashmolean Museum, upon\nwhich a paper of mine was published two years ago. I there showed that, if my system of Hittite decipherment is correct, they must represent the name of a goddess whose figure appears upon the seal. The cylinder of Indisilim proves that the name is that which was pronounced Iskhara in Assyrian.\n\nBefore the name of the goddess come two hieroglyphs, the second of which I cannot identify in spite of repeated examinations. It may be intended for the arm with a dagger in the hand, in which case it would signify \"great.\" But it has more resemblance to the character which in Old Egyptian represented a \"district.\" The first hieroglyph is the goat's head (tarku), which I have shown elsewhere must mean \"prince,\" as it interchanges with the ideograph of \"king.\" Now, in the Recueil de Travaux relatifs \u00e0 la Philologie et \u00e0 l'Arch\u00e9ologie \u00e9gyptiennes et assyriennes (xiii. 3, 4, p. 160), M. Bouriant has published a corrected copy of the treaty between Ramses II. and the Hittites, which was engraved on the walls of Karnak. We learn from this that the Hittite goddess, invoked by the side of the god Suteteh, was \"Shashkhir, the regent of the mountains.\" A very slight change in the form of the first character of the name would give us Ashkhir instead of Shashkhir; and it must, therefore, remain doubtful whether the name of the Hittite deity was actually Iskhara, which is given in the cuneiform tablets as the equivalent of the Babylonian Istar, or whether Iskhara is a Babylonian name, which has been assimilated to the Hittite Shashkhir on account of the likeness of sound. In any case, in the goddess of the Kilikian seal we must see the Hittite goddess of the treaty; and since she is there called \"the regent of the mountains,\" we may conjecture that the unidentified second hieroglyph on the cylinder denotes a \"mountain,\" the whole inscription reading \"the regent of the mountain-land, Iskhara.\"\n\nFrom the Academy,\n\nA. H. Sayce.\n\nJan. 9, 1892.\n2. A Burmese Anecdote.\n\nEaling, Feb. 5, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014Herewith an anecdote from Burmese literature. I have an idea that the same kind of story has been told of some one else, but cannot recollect where. Perhaps some of your readers may know.\n\n\"When Pingala (afterwards Devadatta) reigned in B\u0101r\u0101-nasi, the most excellent lord (Gotama Buddha) was his son. As R\u0101j\u0101 Pingala was very gruff in his mode of addressing people, his subjects did not love him, and prayed for his speedy removal.\n\n\"When Pingala died, and the future Buddha had ascended the throne, he observed one of the doorkeepers weeping. On asking why he wept, the man replied: 'Dear son, I do not weep because I loved your late father; but he used such bad language in this life, that I feel sure that if he does the same in hell King Yama will not be able to keep him, but let him go, and he will come back to this world. That is why I weep.'\" (From the \"Maniratanap\u014d\u1e47.\")\n\nR. F. St. Andrew St. John.\n\n3. A Burmese Anecdote.\n\nDedham School, Essex,\nFeb. 16, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014\"A Burmese Anecdote\" quoted by Mr. R. F. St. A. St. John in the Academy of February 13, forms part of the Mah\u0101pingala-j\u0101taka (Fausb\u00f6ll i, vol. ii. pp. 240-242), and was translated into English in the Folk Lore Journal by the writer of this note.\n\nIt was not Pingala's rough language, but his cruel deeds, that made his subjects rejoice at the accession of a new king. The porter, whose head had now some rest from his late master's blacksmith-like fist, wept, because he feared that Hell's warders and even Yama himself would get a taste of the departed king's mighty blows upon their pates, and unable to endure them, would release him, and bring him\nback to this life. Buddha comforts the porter by telling him that those who had gone to another world will not return in \"the body\" to this world.\n\nR. Morris.\n\n4. The Beginnings of Persian History.\n\nAthen\u00e6um Club, S.W.,\nFeb. 15, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014The publication of another volume of the \"Records of the Past\" is a welcome incident for those students who like to unravel the intricacies of early history, and have not the advantage of being able to read the Egyptian and Assyrian records in the original. Perhaps you will allow me to comment on some problems which have suggested themselves in reading the inscriptions referring to Cyrus published in Prof. Sayce's new volume.\n\nCyrus calls himself in his own inscriptions King of Ansan or Anzan, and the same title is given to him in the inscription of Nabonidus from Sippara. The name Ansan has given rise to a sharp polemic\u2014Oppert, Winckler, and N\u00f6ldeke denying, and Rawlinson, Sayce, Hal\u00e9vy, and others affirming, that it means simply Elam, which itself means The Highlands. It seems to me that the latter view is established beyond all doubt, and Prof. Sayce's arguments are conclusive. Among them is a quotation from a lexical tablet, published in the second volume of The Inscriptions of Western Asia (xlvii. 18), in which Ansan is distinctly given as the equivalent of Elam.\n\nThat Cyrus should style himself King of Elam was a startling revelation to some people, and yet it was not so strange after all. The Elamites\u00b9 or \"mountaineers\" styled themselves, as we learn from the second column in the Achaemenian inscriptions, Hapirdi. This was converted by the Greeks into \u1f08\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9 or \u039c\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9, just as they converted the Persian Bardhiya and the Babylonian Burziya into\n\n\u00b9 The Semites so called them, whence their Greek name of Elymeans.\n\u03a3\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 or \u039c\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, both names meaning simply the Mard or Bard. The native name of the Elamites, therefore, was the Bards or Mards (see Hal\u00e9vy, Babylonian Record, iv. 76).\n\nNow, Ctesias, among his many blundering statements, distinctly calls Cyrus the son of a Mardian robber; and Herodotus and others had already told us that he called his eldest son \u039c\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 or the Mard, while he repeatedly tells us that Susa was the capital of the Achaemenian kings. There were ample reasons, therefore, for suspecting a close connexion between Cyrus and Elam.\n\nThe fact that he should call himself King of Ansan was, nevertheless, remarkable. That he and his people were Persians there can be no doubt whatever; and Darius, who claims to descend from the same stock, styles himself distinctly an Aryan and a Persian. On the other hand, the Elamites or Mards were neither Persians nor Aryans. Their language and their race were not even Indo-European. It follows that Elam must at some date have been conquered by the Persians, whose king then took the name of King of Ansan or Elam. This seems clear. When, then, did this conquest take place? Cyrus in his cylinder inscription calls himself the son of Cambyses the great king, the king of the city of Ansan; the grandson of Cyrus the great king, king of the city of Ansan; and grandson of Tsaispis the great king, king of the city of Ansan (see his Cylinder Inscriptions, l. 21).\n\nThis inscription seems to establish two facts: first, the trustworthiness of the descent of Cyrus and Darius as given by Herodotus, with which it completely agrees; and the worthlessness of the statements of Ctesias on the same subject, when he calls Cyrus the son of Athadates, a Mardian brigand, and Argosti, a goat-herd. In the second place, it points to the fact that the Persian conquest of Ansan or Elam took place at least as early as the time of Tsaispis, or Teispes, as Herodotus calls him; and it seems very probable that Tsaispis was the first Persian leader who occupied it. This was suggested by E. Meyer in his Geschichte des Alterthums, and supported by an ingenious argument which does not\nseem to have been noticed by English writers, although it throws an interesting light on the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel.\n\nJeremiah, prophesying at the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, i.e. about 604 B.C., still recognizes kings of Elam (c. xxv., v. 25). Prophesying again, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, i.e. about 596, he writes:\n\n\"The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come; and I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the Lord; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them; and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the Lord. But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the Lord\" (Jeremiah xlix. 34-39).\n\nA few years later, namely, in the twelfth year after Jehoiakim had been carried away, i.e. in 586 B.C., we find Ezekiel writing:\n\n\"The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him, they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. Asshur is there. . .;. There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about him, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their\nshame with them that go down to the pit; he is put in the midst of them that be slain\u201d (Jeremiah xxxii. 24, 25).\n\nThese passages have been understood to refer to the campaigns of Assurbanipal against Elam; but this is impossible. Assurbanipal had then been dead some time. His reign extended from 668 to 626; nor did he destroy the kingdom as is implied in the prophecies. They evidently, as Meyer urges, contemplated the annihilation of the nation, which only followed on its conquest by the Persians; and this probably took place about 596 B.C.\n\nHaving approximately fixed the date of the conquest of Elam, the next point that suggests itself for inquiry is, whence did the invading Persians come? This question involves difficulties, and is perhaps fruitful of some suggestions which I will reserve for another letter.\n\nH. H. Howorth.\n\n5. The Hundred and Tenth Psalm.\n\nOriental MSS. Department, British Museum,\n\nFeb. 14, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014While reflecting on the date of Psalm cx. with the Hebrew text before me, it struck me that the psalm contains an acrostic, and that the name embodied in it is no other than that of Simon, Hebrew \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05df. The \u05d0 is the first letter in the word \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0, which begins the oracle in v. 1; and the headings of the next three verses\u2014viz. \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9, \u05e0\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05d1\u05b8\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b6\u05d4\u2014complete the name \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05df.\n\nIf this be so, the theory (lately advocated with so much force by Prof. Cheyne in his Bampton Lectures) that Simon the Maccabee was the person originally addressed in Psalm cx. would appear to receive a striking confirmation from an entirely unexpected quarter. After the introductory phrase, \u201cThe oracle of Yahweh to my lord,\u201d the psalmist, bearing the name of his lord vividly in mind, proceeds to weave that name, by means of an acrostic, into the divine oracle itself; and one almost\nhears the psalmist say, \"The oracle of Yahweh to my lord, even to Simon: Sit thou on my right hand. . . . . . .\"\n\nIt would not be very difficult to make more or less plausible guesses as to the acrostic nature of the first letters of the remaining three verses, viz. the letters \u05d3\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9; but, considering that competent critics look upon this part of the psalm as manifestly incomplete, the difficulty of finding a perfectly satisfactory solution for the \u05d3\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 is at once explained. In fact, the break in the acrostic appears to confirm the theory that the latter half of the psalm is incomplete, and the theory of incompleteness may in its turn be held to confirm the acrostic theory. For, if the second part of the psalm wants a verse or two (more likely one than two), the acrostic must be imperfect also; and, as the theory of incompleteness and the acrostic theory have been proposed in perfect independence of one another, the fact of their mutual confirmation should appear to be of considerable importance.\n\nWith regard to the theological question involved in this subject, it is perhaps best to quote the well-weighed words of Prof. Driver in his \"Introduction\" to the Literature of the Old Testament, in a note on p. 363, where he says that the cogency of our Lord's well-known argument based on this psalm \"is unimpaired, so long as it is recognized that the psalm is a Messianic one, and that the august language used in it of the Messiah is not compatible with the position of one who was a mere human son of David.\"\n\nA very eminent Biblical critic, to whom I made a private communication on the acrostic, before making it public, has drawn my attention to the fact that the idea of acrostic psalms in general had occurred to Bickell (see his Conspectus rei Syrorum Literariae, p. 20), and also to the late much lamented Lagarde (see Academy, January 1, 1872). It will probably be worth while, on a future occasion, to review the observations made by these great scholars, and to make further investigations into the subject.\n\nG. Margoliouth.\n6\u2014Y\u00fcan Chwang or Hiouen Thsang?\n\nThe name of the celebrated Chinese pilgrim and translator is spelt in English in the following ways (among others):\n\n1. M. Stanislas Julien. . . . . . Hiouen Thsang.\n2. Mr. Mayers.\u00b9 . . . . . . . Huan Chwang.\n3. Mr. Wylie. . . . . . . . Yu\u00e9n Chwang.\n4. Mr. Beal. . . . . . . . Hiuen Tsiang.\n5. Prof. Legge.\u00b2 . . . . . . . Hs\u00fcan Chwang.\n6. Prof. Bunyiu Nanjio.\u00b3 . . . . Hh\u00fcen Kw\u00e4n.\n\nSir Thomas Wade has been kind enough to explain this diversity in the following note:\n\n\"The pilgrim's family name was \u9806, now pronounced ch'\u00e9n, but more anciently ch'in. His 'style' (official or honorary title) appears to have been both written \u7384 and \u5143. In modern Pekinese these would read in my transliteration (which is that here adopted by Dr. Legge)\u2014\n1 hs\u00fcan chuang.\n2 y\u00fcan chuang.\n\nThe French still write for these two characters\u2014\n\n1 hiouen thsang,\n2 youan thsang,\n\nfollowing the orthography of the Romish Missionaries, Premare and others, which was the one adapted to English usage by Dr. Morrison. I doubt, pace Dr. Edkins, that we are quite sure of the contemporary pronunciation, and should prefer, therefore, myself, to adhere to the French Hiouen, seeing that this has received the sanctification of Julien's well-known translation of the pilgrim's travels.\"\n\n\u00b9 Reader's Manual, p. 290.\n\u00b2 Fa Hien, p. 83, etc.\n\u00b3 Catalogue, p. 435.\nIt is quite clear from the above that in the Chinese pronunciation of the first part of the name there is now nothing approaching to an English H. And of course Julien never intended to represent that sound by his transliteration. Initial H being practically silent in French, his Hiouen is really equal to Iouen, that is, to what would be expressed by Yuan in the scientific system of transliteration now being adopted for all Oriental languages. But the vowel following the initial letter is like the German \u00fc, or the French u, so that Yuan would, for Indianists, express the right pronunciation of this form of the word. It is particularly encouraging to the important cause of a generally intelligible system of transliteration to find that this is precisely the spelling adopted by Sir Thomas Wade.\n\nThis is, however, only one of two apparently equally correct Chinese forms of writing the first half of the name. The initial sound in the other form of the word is unknown in India and England. Sir Thomas Wade was kind enough to pronounce it for me; and it seems to be nearly the German ch (the palatal, not the guttural,\u2014as in M\u00e4dchen) or the Spanish x, only more sibilant. It is really first cousin to the Y sound of the other form, being pronounced by a very similar position of the mouth and tongue. If it were represented by the symbol HS (though there is neither a simple h sound nor a simple s sound in it), then a lazy, careless, easy-going HS would tend to fade away into a Y.\n\nThe latter half of the name is quite simple for Indianists. Using c for our English ch and y for our English ng (\u1e45 or \u1e41 or \u1e43), it would be simply cw\u0101y.\n\nPart of the confusion has arisen from the fact that some authors have taken one, and some the other, of the two Chinese forms of the name. The first four of the transliterations given above are based on Sir Thomas Wade\u2019s No. 2, the other two on his No. 1. All, except only that of Mr. Beal, appear to be in harmony with different complete systems of representing Chinese characters in English letters, each of which is capable of defence. The French, not having the sound of our English CH, for instance, have endeavoured\nto reproduce it by TS. This may no longer be used even by French scholars; but in Julien's time reasons could be adduced in support of it.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the apparently quite contradictory, and in some part unpronounceable, transliterations of this name, so interesting to students of Indian history, are capable of a complete and satisfactory explanation, and that the name, or rather title, is now in Pekinese\u2014whatever it may have been elsewhere and in the pilgrim's time\u2014\n\nY\u00dcAN CHWANG.\n\nT. W. RHYS DAVIDS.\n\n7. The Pummelo.\n\n37, Harrington Road, South Kensington,\nMarch 22, 1892.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Can any member of your Society throw any light on the origin of the word 'Pummelo'? Its immediate parent is 'Pompelmoes,' by corruption into Pummelnoes or nose! and then making it singular\u2014pummelo. But what of Pompelmoes? It is some Malay or Dutch name given to the large variety of 'Citrus decumana.' I understand that in the Mauritius, or some adjacent island, there is a cape called 'Pompelmoes' point\u2014where the Pumelo is largely grown; but whether the fruit received its name from the cape, or the cape from this kind of fruit grown there, is not clear.\n\nThen there are the Indian 'S\u016bngt\u0101r\u0101' and K\u0101m\u0101\u1e37\u0101 oranges. Rumphius, 200 years ago, said there were oranges in China called S\u0113ng Kam and Bit Kam. These words appear to have something to do with Sung and Kam of the former. Perhaps some member of your Society may be able to throw some light on these points.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nG. BONAVIA.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\n8. The Kammav\u0101c\u0101s.\n\nHampstead, March 21, 1892.\n\nDear Professor,\u2014In the last number of the \"Journal\" I had occasion to notice the fact of the sudden introduction of Burmese into the P\u0101li text of the Kammav\u0101c\u0101s. Since writing that article I have had the opportunity of studying a MS. in which whole sentences in Burmese follow the P\u0101li (not, of course, in the way of Nissaya, that is common enough).\n\nBeing on paper made from the bark of the mulberry and opening both ways, this MS. has, at first sight, all the appearance of an ordinary Shan book, but in reality it consists of a Collection of Kammav\u0101c\u0101s in P\u0101li and of Instructions to the Shin (S\u0101ma\u00f1era) and Pyin Shin (Upasampanno) in Burmese, together with a few final directions in Shan.\n\nThe order of the Kammav\u0101c\u0101s differing from that of the other MSS., it may be well to mention it:\u2014\n\n1. Upasampad\u0101.\n2. Saingh\u0101dises\u0101 (Suddhantapariv\u0101sa, ch\u0101ratta, abbh\u0101na) beginning:\n   Aham puttarakkhito bhikkhu . . .\n4. Ka\u1e6dhinaduss\u0101m.\n4. Ticivarena avippavasa.\n5. Uposatha.\n\nMr. St. John has kindly pointed out to me that, the Burmese which I transliterated sunkrimvrat (p. 73) is th\u014dn gyane y\u016bt, i.e. tikkhattum vattabbo.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nHerbert Baynes.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER\n\n(January, February, March, 1892.)\n\nI. General Meetings of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n15th March, 1892.\u2014Sir Frederick Goldsmid, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nThe election since the last general meeting of the following gentlemen as members of the Society was announced:\n\nMembers elected since May, 1891.\n\n1 Mr. W. H. D. Rouse.\n2 Mr. Hira Lal.\n3 Mr. Edward T. Sturdy.\n4 The Hon. P. R\u00e2ma N\u00e2than.\n5 Dr. Hirschfeld.\n6 Mr. Hugh Nevill.\n7 Dr. Grigsby.\n8 Dr. Mann.\n9 Mr. Frederick Jameson.\n10 Mr. C. E. Biddulph.\n11 Mr. B. A. Evetts.\n12 Rev. J. N. Cushing.\n13 Mr. A. Constable.\n14 Mr. F. Sessions.\n15 Mr. N\u00fbrallah Sh\u00e2h.\n16 Mr. A. A. Bevan.\n17 Mr. Consul Devey.\n18 Mr. Ralph Slazenger.\n19 Rev. B. Mitford Morton.\n20 Mr. St. Andrew St. John.\n21 Dr. J. Diaz de Leon.\nThe gift to the Society of a set of Oriental carpets for the three rooms of its Library from the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Bhaunagar was announced by the Secretary. He pointed out how thoroughly in accord with the best traditions of the Indian courts was such a gift from an enlightened prince to a Society of scholars, and how interesting a proof it was of the fact that the educated natives of India were beginning to realize the value to themselves and to their country of the work done by European scholars to interpret the East to the West, and more especially to make the English people acquainted with the great merits and real importance of Indian literature and thought. The Society passed a unanimous vote of thanks for this generous and beautiful gift, and elected the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja a life non-resident member of the Society.\n\nSurgeon-General H. W. Bellew read a paper 'On the Survival of Greek Words in Pukhto or the Language of the Afghans.' The lecturer, referring to his 'Inquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan,' published last year, and to the identification of certain Afghan tribes therein described as being of Greek descent, proceeded to illustrate the presence of Greek words in the Pukhto language by a number of examples in which the Pukhto word varied but very slightly from its Greek original. These examples were followed by others in which the departure of the Pukhto word from the original Greek form was more or less considerable, but still not so great as to prevent easy recognition. Besides the Greek words in Pukhto several instances were mentioned in illustration of grammatical forms peculiar to Pukhto, and referable only to the Greek as the source of their origin. The lecturer, after describing the way in which he came to discover these Greek elements in Pukhto, expressed his opinion that a more thorough investigation of the subject would prove conclusively that the language spoken by the Pukht\u016bn, Path\u0101n, or Afgh\u0101n people\u2014and more especially in the country of the Suleiman range, which, as Arrian asserts, was settled by Alexander the Great with people\nof his own in place of the Indians he had conquered in it\u2014was no other than a degraded dialect of the Greek formerly spoken during several centuries as the colloquial tongue of that region by the Greek conquerors and their successors, who colonized and hellenized the country by a wholesale transplantation of tribes\u2014such as the Syrian, Lydian, Kilikian, Bithynian, Mysian, Pamphilian, Ionian, and others\u2014from Asia Minor to this eastern frontier of the Greek Empire in Asia founded by Alexander the Great. This view is supported by the fact that the descendants or posterity of these several tribes are now found in Afghanistan by the identical names of S\u016bri, L\u016bdi, Ghilji or Khilichi, Batani, M\u016bs\u0101zi, Farmuli or Parmuli, Y\u016bnus, Y\u0101ni, or Y\u0101 respectively, and others from the same western region. Taking this view of the Pukhto language, the lecturer said that it threw a new light upon the past history of this part of Asia, and cleared up many obscure points relating to the rise and progress of the Parthian sovereignty, and to the history of the long succession of dynasties that had flourished in this part of Asia subsequent to the commencement of the Mohammedan era.\n\nA discussion followed, in which Dr. Thornton, General Maclagan, Prof. Bendall, and Mr. Lyon took part.\n\nII.

A. De Lagarde.\u2014The sudden death of this eminent\nscholar, which the Athen\u00e6um announced on Jan. 2, makes\na great gap in many branches of learning. Lagarde, like\nEwald, his predecessor in the Semitic Chair at G\u00f6ttingen,\nwas a most active worker in a variety of subjects and\nlanguages. He studied theology, Oriental languages, and\nphilosophy at the universities of Berlin and Halle; became\nprivatim docens in the latter university in 1851, and later\nprofessor in various gymnasiaums, until he succeeded Ewald in 1869. He edited in 1854 the Syriac \"Didascalia Apostolorum,\" and followed this up with other Syriac texts collected in the British Museum and at Paris. In 1877 he engaged in Armenian investigations; in 1883 he took in hand Persian studies, in which year he also published \"Aegyptiaca,\" relating to Coptic studies. Most of his publications are connected with the Bible, such as the edition of the Aramaic translation (the so-called Targum) of the Prophets according to Codex Reuchlinus, preserved in the library of Carlsruhe; the Hagiographa Chaldaica; the Arabic translation of the Gospels; the Syriac translation of the Apocrypha of the Old Testament; the Coptic translation of the Pentateuch; and a part of the Lucian text of the Septuagint, which he was fortunate enough to reconstruct from MSS. for nearly half of the Old Testament.\n\nMinor articles, mostly on Semitic philology, are to be found in his books entitled \"Symmicta\" and \"Mittheilungen,\" as well as in contributions to the volumes issued by the University of G\u00f6ttingen. How far the Lucian text is ready we shall soon know; thanks to his minute method of working there can be no doubt that some one will be able to carry his notes through the press. One of the deceased's last works was the collation of the \"Evangelium Hierosolimitanum,\" edited by Count Miniscalchi Erizzo from the unique Vatican MS., but not to the satisfaction of the deceased. Lagarde, like Ewald, meddled with politics, which he expressed in his \"Deutsche Schriften\" and other monographs. He belonged to the Prussian Conservative party. In anti-Semitic prejudice Lagarde far exceeded Ewald; and he unfortunately displayed a lack of generosity towards fellow workers who had the misfortune to be of another opinion than himself. Indeed, he did not recognize any one as his equal, far less as his superior. He attacked even those who had been long dead\u2014for instance, the late Dr. Zunz, who was certainly a superior Rabbinical scholar to Lagarde; strangely enough, he laughs at him for having in a translation of one of Judah Halevi's liturgies the\nfollowing sentence, \"The plowers plowed upon my back,\" not observing, although a professor of Hebrew, that Judah Halevi was using the words of Psalm cxxix. 3. He was agreeable and jovial in society, but he showed himself bitter and irritable towards most of his fellow workers.\n\nFrom the *Athen\u00e6um*, A. Neubauer.\n\nJan. 9, 1892.\n\nSir George Campbell, K.C.S.I., D.C.L.\u2014This is the last duty I could have wished to discharge, viz. to record the death of my dear life-long friend, Sir George Campbell, M.P. for Kircaldy Burghs, N.B. He was a member of this Society since 1875, but never took an active part in its meetings, though on many subjects connected with Asia generally, and with India specially, he was a competent authority. Born a Scotchman in 1824, he received his early education at St. Andrews and in Edinburgh. On receiving a nomination to the Bengal Presidency of the Indian Civil Service he passed two years at Haileybury College, where he was distinguished for his mathematical and legal attainments rather than for Oriental scholarship. In fact he never claimed to be a scholar in the broad sense of that word, but he was an able administrator of Asiatic Provinces, and a close observer of Asiatic habits and customs. He filled successively the posts of Judicial Commissioner of the Province of Oudh, Member of the High Court of Judicature of Calcutta, and Lieut.-Governor of the Province of Bengal. Throughout his whole career he evidenced talents of the highest order, and an unrivalled grasp of difficult administrative problems. As far back as 1852 he published his two volumes \"Modern India,\" and \"India as it should be,\" which left their mark on the administration of the next twenty years.\n\nOn his return to England in 1875 he received the honour of Knight Commander of the Star of India, and of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford. He was returned in the same year to Parliament as member for the Kircaldy Burghs, and occupied that seat to the day of his death with every\nprospect of re-election, and he was indefatigable in the discharge of his duties in the House of Commons.\n\nHe visited the United States, and published a volume \"White and Black in the U.S.\" He visited the Danubian Provinces and published a volume \"Handy Book of the Eastern Question.\" He visited Egypt repeatedly, and he also published a book, the \"British Empire,\" with special reference to India and the Colonies. All his writings evidence careful inquiry and a far-seeing intelligence.\n\nHe was a Liberal in politics, and followed Mr. Gladstone, but his views with regard to Ireland were formed from a careful local investigation on the spot, and were placed before the public in his volume on \"Ireland\" several years before Mr. Gladstone developed any portion of his Irish Policy.\n\nIn India as in Ireland he was a champion of the interests of the hereditary occupying tenant of the soil as against the alien absentee landlord.\n\nA student of anthropology he made one lasting contribution to the science. In considering the ethnical relations of the Non-Aryan race of Southern India, he came to the conviction, no doubt indicated previously by earlier authors, that in the Vindya range there existed certain races, who were neither Aryan nor Dravidian: he struck out the name of \"Kolarian\" in 1866, and that term is now accepted.\n\nHe was esteemed and loved by all who knew him. A friendship of fifty years enables the writer of this notice to testify to this fact. If he attained every post and honour which were attainable, it is because he was most worthy of them; and the opinion is deliberately expressed that of all the members of the Indian Civil Service since 1840 up the date of the change of system in 1856 he and Sir Richard Temple, Bart., occupy the highest rank for administrative ability and knowledge of India.\n\nFeb. 24, 1892.\n\nR. N. C.\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nHarsha Carita.\u2014Mr. Thomas, of Trinity College, Cambridge, is preparing, in collaboration with Prof. Cowell, a translation of this work, which will be published, when completed, by the Royal Asiatic Society's Oriental Translation Fund.\n\nMr. W. W. Rockhill, one of the results of whose last journey to Tibet was the excellent series of articles in our \"Journal\" of last year, has again started on a tour of exploration in that country, beginning with the Kokonor district.\n\nChinese Caricatures.\u2014Dr. Griffith John's researches into the causes at the bottom of the recent anti-Foreign riots in the valley of the Yangtsze have resulted, writes the Mercury, in the publication of one of the most remarkable books ever printed in China. We refer to the volume just issued at Hankow, entitled \"The cause of the Riots in the Yangtsze Valley: a complete Picture Gallery,\" which has been sent to us for review. The book is printed upon Chinese paper and bound in native style; it consists of thirty-two coloured facsimiles of the most revolting pictorial products of the anti-Foreign party in Hunan. No attempt is made by the printers to gloss over the shocking grossness of these abominable cartoons, either in the illustrations themselves or in the letterpress which explains the Chinese text around the border of each. A more abominable collection it has never been the lot of any printer to publish; but, undoubtedly, Dr. John and his colleagues have done well to bring before the foreign world a knowledge, such as these pictures inculcate, of the foul weapons which the reactionary party in China, headed by the gentry and literati of Hunan, use to stir up the evil passions of the ignorant masses to stem back the tide from the West which threatens to sweep them away. This class of literature, as Dr. John has already demonstrated, is chiefly produced in Hunan, and nowhere in such variety or quantity as Changsha, the capital of the province.\nThe New Asoka Inscription.\u2014Mr. Lewis Rice, M.R.A.S., Director of Archaeology in Mysore, who recently undertook a survey of the Chitaldroog District, reports a most important discovery of edicts of Asoka inscribed on immense boulders in the same ancient characters, and the same Pali language, as have been already met with in the case of similar records discovered in Northern India. None of these edicts have hitherto been found south of Guzerat and Ganjam, and hence the importance of the present discovery. It is known that after the third Buddhist Council held in the eighteenth year of Asoka\u2019s reign, missionaries were sent to Banavasi and Mahisa-mandala, which latter, from its connexion and name, may be identified with Mysore. The principal inscription now found consists of thirteen lines, covering a space of $15\\frac{1}{2}$ feet by $11\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. The words dev\u0101nam and piye can be read at the end of the first and eighth lines, and Jambu-dipa towards the end of the third line. No further particulars have yet been received.\n\nJava.\u2014The Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences has brought out an elaborate work on the antiquities of Java by Mr. Yzerman, chief engineer, with an atlas of plates. The Society has done good work in the past in preserving these antiquities from European business enterprise and from native love of destruction.\n\nThe Straits Settlements.\u2014General Sir Charles Warren, K.C.B., has been elected president of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe Van District.\u2014About eighteen months ago two French gentlemen, Messrs. G. Pisson and A. Develay, made a journey \u201cen Asie Ant\u00e9rieure\u201d on behalf of the Ministries of Education, Commerce, and Agriculture of the Republican Government. An account of this journey has recently appeared in French, of which the following is a short abstract.\n\nFrom the Black Sea coast they followed the usual high road between Trebizond and Erzeroum, along which passes so much merchandize, camel-borne, for Tabreez and Teheran, and even farther East; a detailed description of this stage\nmay be found in Mrs. Bishop's most recent book of travel. At Erzeroum they branched southwards, and, after crossing the steep and lofty Palandoken mountain, passed into the regions inhabited by Armenians and Kurds; the former are mostly agricultural, and live in the open plain, whilst the villages of their neighbours generally skirt the surrounding mountains, which afford rich pasturage for their numerous flocks and herds. After calling in at Khanous, a little Mussulman town picturesquely situated in the bosom of a deep sheer basalt cutting, the bed of a mountain brook, they visited the world-old Armenian Monastery, Sourp Garabed (St. John's), or Changeli-Kilisseh (Church of Chimes), built in the days of St. Gregory the Illuminator. M. Pisson, having sustained an injury on the road near here, had to remain several weeks in the Monastery, whilst his friend, anxious to make the best use of his time, rounded the north coast of Lake Van, and, having visited the chief place of the district, crossed into Persia to Tabreez, passing the border in two places in mid-winter by little-known mountain bridle-paths. Having rejoined his companion at Bitlis, they then proceeded by the track presenting fewest obstacles among the mountain valleys, viz. through Sert and Jezireh to Mosul. During a few days' sojourn in what was probably once an environs of Nineveh, they viewed the Koyunjik mound and the remains of Assyria's capital; their road now led through Arbela, scene of Alexander's victory over Darius; here all the villages are built on artificial mounds, testifying to the ancient populousness of the country, and two broad rivers have to be crossed by the kellek, or inflated sheepskin raft. The Lesser Zab was also crossed a little later at Altun Keupri (Golden-Bridge), a small borough on an islet of conglomerate in mid-river; and next the not inconsiderable town of Kerkuk pleased our travellers by its bright and well-to-do aspect and wide gardens of tropical produce.\n\nHere the road forward was certainly considered unsafe, as an escort of thirty gendarmes was furnished for safe conduct to Sule\u00efmanieh; and fanaticism is the order of the\nday in this region. A sheikh of the Hamavend Arab tribe, however, gave the protection of his company for a space, and Sule\u00efmanieh, the last considerable town in Turkey, was duly reached; it contains 5000 houses, all of one storey only, and there are but twenty families of Christians.\n\nJust before the Persian frontier, the French party passed the village Tavileh, and hereafter serious difficulties of more kinds than one had to be overcome; a horse perished, the tracks were very bad and difficult to follow, and the Kurds proved overreaching and untrustworthy.\n\nThe Avroman Mountain here is of quite a different character from the mountains of Armenia, where large plateaux occur frequently. The hills are much rockier and wilder, and an ascent of 4500 feet has to be made in one place. Thus, with much scrambling up and down, Hajish, a village shut in by peaked mountains and huge masses of grey rock, was reached. And after ascending the valley of the Gaveh-Rud some way, and passing the villages Ruar and Tefen, and having had to put up with short rations, Sihna, or Senneh, a Kurdish town of 35,000 inhabitants, afforded a short rest to the exhausted Frenchmen.\n\nThere is little to chronicle respecting Sihna, except that it has grown from the condition of a big village to its present dimensions within the last fifteen years. The horses are reckoned fine animals, and the best quality of Kurdish rugs are woven here. There are also two mosques which contain \"chambers of refuge\" for criminals flying from justice.\n\nUpon leaving Sihna, a visit was made to the districts of Guerrous and Karaghan, following or touching the bed of some tributaries of the Rivers Kizil-Uzun (lower the Sefid Rud) and Abhar-Chi, which empties into the salt marsh to the south of Teheran. M. Develay also \"rode Chappar\" from Sihna to Teheran in seven days by the highway through Hamadan.\n\nAfter some months in the Persian metropolis, the homeward route of the \"Mission Scientifique\" lay through Resht and Baku and across the Caucasus.\nthe shadow of which the Buddha is related to have passed\nthe great mental struggle which ended in his Buddhahood.\nThey represent the twenty lo-hans, that is, Arhats, or\nmasters of the true doctrine: such miniatures, painted on\nleaves of the Bo-tree, are not infrequent in China, but good\nspecimens are rare in Europe, and there are none in our\nLibrary.\n\nKarakorum Inscription.\u2014Dr. George Huth, privat-docent\nat the Berlin University, has published a short monograph\non this interesting inscription. He proves quite clearly\nthat it must be the record of a language that contained\nsuffixes, prefixes, and changes in the middle of roots. He\ndraws the conclusion that the language cannot be Uraltaic,\nand is most probably the ancestor of the various Yenissei\nlanguages treated of by Klaproth and Castr\u00e9n. As, how-\never, the Chinese inscription on the same stone dates from\nabout 732 A.D., and we have no specimens of these languages\ntill many centuries after that time, this is only a first step\ntowards decipherment, and the author does not in fact\npropose as yet a translation of any word, or an identification\nof any letter.\n\nEpigraphia Indica.\u2014We have just received, in February,\n1892, the new part of this valuable serial. It has printed\non the title page \"Issued October, 1891,\" so the mode of\ntransmission must be singularly slow. It contains some\nshort Jain inscriptions by Prof. B\u00fchler, two short papers\nby Dr. Hultzsch, and an elaborate and important article by\nProfessor Jacobi on the computation of dates in Hindu\ninscriptions, with supplementary astronomical tables.\n\nEtruscan.\u2014With reference to the announcement in our\nlast number, p. 167, we have now to add that Prof. Krall\nhas now communicated to the Academy of Vienna the\nresults of his examination of the inscribed band on the\nmummy of a woman in the museum of Agram, which\nwas brought from Egypt by Michael Baric in 1849. H.\nBragach in the winter of 1848-49 had already found on\nthe mummy the end of a band (which afterwards proved\nto be 14 metres long) almost entirely covered with characters\nto him completely unintelligible. The director of the museum having apprised Prof. Krall of the event, the band was brought to Vienna, and at length, after eleven months study, discovered by him to be the longest Etruscan inscription known to us, the longest hitherto known to exist being the Perugian cippus containing 125 words. The Etruscan mummy band contains 1200 words divided into some 200 lines, distributed in at least 12 columns after the fashion of writing on papyri. The material is undoubtedly of ancient Egyptian manufacture, and the ink shows the same colour as that of the ordinary writing on mummies. According to the Etruscan scholars B\u00fccheler, Deecke, and Pauli, there can be no doubt whatever about the authenticity of the text, so if this real relic of antiquity comes to be read, our knowledge of Etruscan will be assured. So far, Prof. Krall has presented to the academy an unpublished tentative reading, restoring the text and adding a list of all the words occurring in it with additions and explanations by W. Deecke. Messrs. Edler have succeeded with great difficulty in making photographs of the text.\n\nThe Present State of the Nestorian Tablet at Sigan.\u2014This tablet, as is well known, stands outside the west gate of Si-gan, Shen-si, and enunciates the leading doctrines of Christianity. It was erected A.D. 780-781, and is the only relic hitherto discovered in China of the Nestorian Christian Church. The stone is white, is of an ordinary grey colour and sonorous, responding with a bell-like sound on being struck sharply. It is supported on the back of a half-buried tortoise. The dimensions are: total height, 103 in.; breadth, 37 in.; thickness, 11\u00bd in. It stands facing an old, half-ruined Buddhist temple on the south of the road, a mile and a half from the west gate, and half a mile from the suburb. Its surroundings are not interesting; the country is flat, well cultivated, and very fertile. The remains of a mud wall enclose it and hide it from the road, though, even were it visible, there is nothing by which a passer-by could distinguish it from the hundreds of other stones that are to be found in this district.\nthe shadow of which the Buddha is related to have passed\nthe great mental struggle which ended in his Buddhahood.\nThey represent the twenty lo-hans, that is, Arhats, or\nmasters of the true doctrine: such miniatures, painted on\nleaves of the Bo-tree, are not infrequent in China, but good\nspecimens are rare in Europe, and there are none in our\nLibrary.\n\nKarakorum Inscription.\u2014Dr. George Huth, privat-docent\nat the Berlin University, has published a short monograph\non this interesting inscription.

Member R.A.S.) has completed the fifth volume of his great editio princeps of the J\u0101takas, bringing it down to No. 537 (out of the total of 550). The volume is dedicated to Professor Rhys Davids and Dr. Morris. The remaining 13 stories, the longest in the collection, will probably occupy three more volumes. One of them is the Bh\u016bridatta, translated in our last issue by Mr. St. John.\n\nNew Oriental Department, British Museum.\u2014On the retirement, in January last, of Dr. Rieu, the well-known Persian scholar, from the Keepership of Oriental MSS. at the British Museum, it was decided by the Trustees to create a new Oriental Department to consist of Oriental printed books and MSS., in both of which collections the Museum is very rich. This has now been done, and Professor Douglas (one of the members of our Council) has been appointed Keeper of the new department.\n\nSanskrit name for Australia.\u2014Mr. E. Delmar Morgan, M.R.A.S., has published in brochure form a very interesting paper he read at the Geographical Congress of Berne on the 'Early Discovery of Australia.' He there proves that the coast line of Australia appears with full details on several early maps, much older than any literary record of the actual discovery having taken place. The first authenticated voyage to Australia is that of the yacht Duyfken or Dore in 1606. But already in a map of the year 1521 (by La Salle) the 'Terra Australis' is given under the curious name of Patalie regio, derived, according to the Vicomte de Santareus, from the Sanskrit (or P\u0101li) P\u0101t\u0101la, meaning 'the nether regions.' This is the oldest and least perfect of these early maps of Australia, several of which Mr. Morgan gives in facsimile. Perhaps the name has some connection with P\u0101tali-putta, the old name for Ceylon. Where did these old map-makers get their information from?\nV. Notices of Books.\n\nA Memoir on the Coefficients of Numbers. Being a Chapter in the Theory of Numbers. By Brajendranath Seal, M.A., Principal Berhampore College, Bengal. (Calcutta, Hare Press, 1891.)\n\nIt is said that the German mathematician Kronecker, at a scientific gathering in Berlin, proposed the health of The Theory of Numbers, the only branch of mathematics, perhaps of human learning, as yet unsullied by a practical application. And from this point of view we may congratulate Mr. Brajendranath Seal, whose memoir deals with speculations remote indeed from every-day life. A perfect number is one which is equal to the sum of its division (e.g. $6 = 3 + 2 + 1$). The coefficient of a number is defined to be the ratio which any number bears to the sum of its division. Perfect numbers have been studied by Euclid, by Bachet, Fermat, and Euler. The mention of these names shows that the class of problems with which Mr. Brajendranath Seal deals has attracted the acutest of mathematical speculators. Mr. Seal\u2019s memoir is concerned with the properties of these perfect numbers and attempts to find all numbers for which the coefficient (as above defined) is given. Many interesting theorems are proved by the way; for example, that no perfect number is divisible by only four prime numbers, and the paper abounds with examples worked out in detail.\n\nIn the history of science it has always been the strong fastnesses, from which we are afterwards to survey the country, that have offered the stoutest resistance, until the walls which have defied force vanish before the wand of the magician. We cannot doubt that the spirit of Mr. Seal\u2019s work is that by which we shall at last be able to understand the secrets of number pure and simple\u2014secrets guessed at by the great Masters, such as Euclid, Fermat, and Gauss, but, save for such guesses, almost entirely unknown to us now.\nEUG\u00c8NE BURNOUF\u2014Ses travaux et sa correspondance. Par J. BARTHELEMY ST. HILAIRE (Paris, 1891, privately printed).\n\nNo more suitable author of an 'appreciation' of the great scholar Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf could be found than the veteran savant so long his personal friend, and a co-worker with him on several fields, M. Barthelemy St. Hilaire. It is pleasant to find that M. St. Hilaire, who first made the acquaintance of Burnouf on leaving the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand seventy years ago, should still have health and energy to publish these graceful and touching memorials. Not that they are new. They are a reprint from articles in the Journal des Savants published from time to time between 1852 (when Burnouf died) down to 1891, and have not been altered to fit the altered circumstances of the times. There being also neither index nor table of contents, the usefulness of the book as a work of reference is seriously hampered. But they are very interesting and inspiring reading, and give a very clear and pleasant picture of the devoted labours of the genial scholar in whose honour they have been composed; and they contain those personal facts of his history which must form the basis of a critical judgment of the great Burnouf.\n\nAs to his greatness there can never be any question, but when M. St. Hilaire puts in the forefront of his panegyric an eulogium of the method that he followed, we feel compelled to distinguish. The result of his twenty years labours for instance in Buddhism lies before us in the two magnificent volumes, the 'Introduction' and the 'Lotus.' It is agreed on all hands that these works introduced Buddhism to the West and remained for a quarter of a century the authorities on the whole subject. It is agreed on all hands that they give proofs not only of the rarest industry, but of the ripest and most balanced judgment, and also of a faculty that cannot be described as less than genius in feeling the way to a right conclusion out of insufficient and often contradictory data. But a\nfurther question remains. There can be no doubt that had Burnouf devoted those years to editing and translating the Digha and Majjhima Nik\u0101yas he would have accomplished the task, and accomplished it in a masterly way, within the time. Would not that method, rather than the one which he followed, have led sooner and more surely to the desired goal? Is it well to waste such priceless tools as the enthusiastic industry and critical insight of a Burnouf on weighing one against the other the statements of writers who lived many centuries after the events of which they speak, when materials contemporaneous or nearly so are, all the while, at hand? Is it the better method to read works in MS. and publish the results of such reading to the world (which has not the authority before it), or to publish the works themselves first, and then draw the conclusions which every scholar can test for himself? These are the kind of questions which would have to be settled in discussing the question of the best method to be followed by a pioneer in opening a new field of historical inquiry, of the best way (in the interests of science) in which a great scholar can use the abilities and the time at his command.\n\nIt only remains to add that in a list of the unpublished works there is much that would seem, from our author's description, to be still of the greatest value. Cannot especially the 'Examen de la langue du Lotus' and the 'Comparaison des textes Palis et Sanskrits,' and the translation of the Khudda-sikkh\u0101 Dipani be published at once either in the 'Journal Asiatique' or elsewhere? It is perfectly true that it is a kind of sacrilege to publish matter which a great author has deliberately put aside as not to be published. But there is no evidence whatever that these finished studies were withheld by their author for any other reason than want of opportunity or want of space. Those on the spot can judge. To those at a distance it seems cruel to keep concealed what is of value now, but will certainly in another generation have lost its worth.\nA Catalogue of Sanskrit and other Works in the Oriental Section of the Adyar Library, compiled to December, 1891. (Adyar, Madras, 1891.)\n\nThis catalogue of the collection at Adyar begun in 1886, and yearly increasing in value, has been put together under the supervision of H. S. Olcott, the President of the Theosophical Society. It shows seventy-eight printed works (some of several volumes) and sixty-two MSS. of Vedic literature. Among the latter may be especially mentioned a palm leaf MS. of M\u0101dhava's commentary on the Yajur Veda (described 'as a very old MS., about 400 years old')\u2014a collection also on palm leaf and in the Telugu character, of fifteen treatises on phonetics many of which are unknown in Europe\u2014a palm leaf MS. containing five works by the father of R\u0101m\u0101nuja\u2014and the Vaidika Jyotisha of Lagadha. The Itih\u0101sa and Pur\u0101\u1e47a books are twenty-three printed ones and sixty-eight MSS., among which we may notice an old copy on palm leaf in Telugu characters of the Uttara-kha\u1e47\u1e0da of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a\u2014a palm leaf MS. in Devan\u0101gar\u012b characters of the Bh\u0101rgava Pur\u0101\u1e47a, treating of the lives of Vaish\u1e47ava leaders among others of R\u0101m\u0101nuja\u2014and a similar MS. of the Badari Mah\u0101tmya. The law books are eighty-two printed and fifty-two MSS., the philosophical books 135 printed and 131 MSS., of which the Ny\u0101yat\u0101tparyapari\u1e63uddhi of Udayana and the Ny\u0101ya Kaustubha of Mah\u0101deva are described as rare works. Some thirty works on medicine, the like number on astronomy or astrology, and a few on music, precious stones, etc., complete this part of the catalogue. There then follow lists of 229 Buddhist, Jain, and Vaish\u1e47avite books (of which about forty are Grantha or Telugu MSS.), of twenty Tantra MSS., and of 220 miscellaneous works (stories, poems, dramas, etc.), of which about thirty are in MS., and 121 Sanskrit grammars or lexicons, of which about seventy-five are manuscripts.\n\nThe printing is not good, and the transliteration of Indian words is very inaccurate, and the column headed remarks\ngives some curious details. 'The original Kathasarit Sagara (sic) was a poetical compilation by Soma Deva, and published in Holland.' And it is disappointing to find that of Buddhist works, in which the library was supposed to be rich, there are so few, among which are only two MSS. described respectively as 'A Buddhist work' (p. 139) and 'A Buddhist religious book, name unknown' (p. 163). The Pali books seem to be kept in Ceylon, and the Chinese and Japanese, some 500 in number, are not yet catalogued. But we should not look a gift horse in the mouth, and will only express our hope that the library may rapidly increase and flourish.\n\nAn English-Sinhalese Dictionary, by Charles Carter.\n(Colombo, Skeen.)\n\nThis dictionary is a very great advance on previous works of the kind, from the well-known dictionary of Clough published sixty-eight years ago to the little pocket dictionary issued by the Wesleyan missionaries. It is in six parts, making a total of nearly 1100 octavo pages, and is very well and clearly printed\u2014the English words in Clarendon, and the Sinhalese words in a bold and readable type. It is printed at the Government Press and at Government expense. We congratulate the ruling powers of the island on so enlightened a use of the public funds, and the veteran missionary on the successful accomplishment of his tedious but most useful labours. What still remains an urgent want is a good Sinhalese-English Dictionary, that of Clough being altogether out of date. Such a work giving full quotations and references, and the history and derivation of each word,\u2014precisely because it would be beyond the power of any single man to produce,\u2014would be a noble gift from the English rulers of Ceylon to the loyal and intelligent people of that ancient home of learning and culture.\nDie gottesherrlichen Vortraege der Juden historisch entwickelt. Second edition, under the auspices of the \"Zunz Stiftung,\" by Dr. N. Br\u00fcll. pp. 516. (T. Kauffmann, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1892.)\n\nIt is exactly sixty years since the first edition of the above mentioned work appeared and marked the creation of a study out of elements till then generally considered as unworthy of serious attention. How much the book has been appreciated by all interested in these researches is best inferred by the circumstance that it has been out of print for many years and only obtainable at a high price.\n\nThe single branches of Rabbinical literature have, of course, been largely expanded by able students since Zunz's work was first published, and it would have been most deplorable if it had been otherwise. Yet this does not in the least diminish the value of the book, and the idea of a second edition is surely a most happy one, especially as this was done by so profound a scholar as Dr. N. Br\u00fcll of Frankfort-on-the-Main. It is lamentable that the second editor died before his task was finished, and thus the scientific world was deprived of the supplement which he had commenced, and which was to contain a critical selection of the literature concerning the subject and a bibliography of the writings reviewed. It is to be hoped that the publisher will succeed in finding another scholar who, equipped with the material left by the deceased, will prove able to complete the supplement.\n\nIt is also desirable that he should pay closer attention to the Jewish Arabic literature referring to the subject. The Jews in Arabian countries possessed not only Arabic translations of the Bible, but used this language also for liturgical readings. There exist Arabic versions of the Haggadah for Passover, of the story of Matathias, which latter is to be found in most MSS. of the Yemen prayer book, several poetic versions of the story of Hamah and her sons, translations of the Aramaic Targums, the Canticles, and others of the smaller Hagiographa, adaptations of portions of the\nMidrash and entire Midrashic treatises, as the N\u016br al Zulun, of which MSS. are in London, Oxford, and Berlin.\n\nThe finishing touch of the book was added after the death of Dr. Br\u00fcll by Steinschneider, who also wrote the preface. It is regrettable to hear from such a competent authority that the number of writers interested in the subject is rather on the decline than on the increase, and this was one of the reasons why the new edition was undertaken. Let us hope that it will help to revive the enthusiasm for this branch of enquiry.\n\nAs to the arrangement of the new edition, which considerably surpasses the first in size, it only contains alterations and corrections added by Zunz himself in his copy, and which are made recognizable both in text and footnotes by square breckets. Entirely new are the indices, which were worked out by a young scholar, Dr. A. Loewenthal, in Berlin, and a concordance of the pages of the two editions. The book is beautifully got up, and the price so low that every one interested in the subject can procure it for himself.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\n\nTHINGS JAPANESE by BASIL HALL CHAMBERLAIN. (Tokyo, the Hakabunsha.)\n\nThis second edition of a most useful work contains some twenty new articles, and is provided with an excellent map of the country. The book is rather intended for the use of the globe-trotter, and that valuable customer of the book-maker, the 'general reader,' than for the scholar, and calls for no extended criticism in the pages of this journal. That it is, in the main, the work of a scholar is, however, evident enough, but this fact rather irritates than satisfies the reader, who feels that the author, too often, deals out but a niggard share of the knowledge he possesses. Among the new articles much the most important is Messrs. Aston and Gowland's contribution on Archaeology, while the most amusing one is that entitled \"English as she is Japped.\" The articles on 'History\nand Mythology,' 'The People,' 'Demoniacal Possession,' 'Tokyo,' 'Ten Ceremonies,' 'Lacquer,' 'Poetry,' and 'Printing' are interesting, and those dealing with the aspects of modern Japan are full of shrewd observations, while quite devoid of the somewhat silly gush which characterizes so much of the more recent literature dealing with Japanese subjects.\n\n**Manual of the Siyin Dialect spoken in the Northern Chin Hills by Captain F. M. Rundall, D.S.O., Gurkha Rifles. (Rangoon, Government Press, 1891.) Price, Two Rupees.**\n\nThis is a most praiseworthy contribution to our knowledge is an entirely unknown region in the province of Burma, and the author deserves our hearty thanks. We are glad to find that a manual of the Baungshe Dialect spoken in the Southern Chin Hills has been published by Lieut. Macnabb (it is in fact a different language). It appears that the Siyin is one Dialect of a form of speech, which has no leading Dialect, but consists of several, of equal importance (1) Siyun, (2) Nwengal, and (3) Kanhaw. Two other forms of speech are mentioned, (1) Haka, and (2) Tashen, and are pronounced to differ so materially as to be quite different languages. Here then we have revealed to us a group of four languages previously totally unknown, but in which communication is held by British officers with subject races.\n\nThe geographical position of these tribes is as follows:\n\nA line drawn from Mandalay to Chittagong passes almost through the Chin Hills. In the North they are bounded by the Manipur Valley, on the East by the Kubo Kal\u0113, Myillha, and Yan valleys, on the South by the Arakan Hill tracts, on the West by the Lushai Hills. The District occupied by the Siyin is roughly between N. Lat. 23\u00b010 and 23\u00b025, and E. Long. 93\u00b045 and 94\u00b05. The highest elevation is about 8800 feet above sea-level, but the average height of the range is about 5000 feet.\nThe language is monosyllabic. Genders are distinguished by the addition of the word \"pa\" and \"nu\" to indicate male and female, and one or two other suffixes in the case of animals. The plural is expressed by the suffix \"te,\" but it is frequently omitted.\n\nMarch 24, 1892.  \nR. N. C.\n\nVI.

Gooneratne, Esq., Atapattu Mudaliyar, Galle.\n\nThis Society has been started in order to render accessible to students the rich stores of the earliest Buddhist literature now lying unedited and practically unused in the various MSS. scattered throughout the University and other Public Libraries of Europe.\n\nThe historical importance of these Texts can scarcely be exaggerated, either in respect of their value for the history of folk-lore, or of religion, or of language. It is already certain that they were all put into their present form within a very limited period, probably extending to less than a century and a half (about B.C. 400\u2013250). For that period they have preserved for us a record, quite uncontaminated by filtration through any European mind, of the every-day beliefs and customs of a people nearly related to ourselves, just as they were passing through the first stages of civilization. They are our best authorities for the early history of that interesting system of religion so nearly allied to some of the latest speculations among ourselves, and which has influenced so powerfully, and for so long a time, so great a portion of the human race\u2014the system of religion which we now call Buddhism. The sacred books of the early Buddhists have preserved to us the sole record of the only religious\nmovement in the world's history which bears any close resemblance to early Christianity. In the history of speech they contain unimpeachable evidence of a stage in language midway between the Vedic Sanskrit and the various modern forms of speech in India. In the history of Indian literature there is nothing older than these works, excepting only the Vedic writings; and all the later classical Sanskrit literature has been profoundly influenced by the intellectual struggle of which they afford the only direct evidence. It is not, therefore, too much to say that the publication of this unique literature will be no less important for the study of history\u2014whether anthropological, philological, literary, or religious\u2014than the publication of the Vedas has already been.\n\nThe whole will occupy about nine or ten thousand pages 8vo. Of these 6000 pages have already appeared. The accession of about fifty new members would make it possible to issue 1000 pages every year.\n\nThe Subscription to the Society is only One Guinea a year, or Five Guineas for six years, payable in advance. Each subscriber receives, post free, the publications of the Society, which cost a good deal more than a guinea to produce.\n\nIt is hoped that persons who are desirous to aid the publication of these important historical texts, but who do not themselves read P\u0101li, will give Donations to be spread if necessary over a term of years. Nearly \u00a3400 has already been thus given to the Society by public-spirited friends of historical research.\n\n* * * Subscriptions for 1891 are now due, and it is earnestly requested that subscribers will send in their payments without putting the Chairman to the expense and trouble of personally asking for them. All who can conveniently do so should send the Five Guineas for six years, to their own benefit and that of the Society also.\n\nThe Society keeps no books, and its publications cannot in any case be sent to subscribers who have not already paid their subscriptions for the year.\n\nCheques and Post Office Orders should be made payable to the \"P\u0101li Text Society.\" (Address: 22, Albemarle Street, London, W.)\nJOURNAL\n\nOF\n\nTHE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n(April, May, June, 1892.)\n\nI.

While the Council in its last report had to state that the number of resident members had steadily declined, we have now to point out that the number has again gone up, so that the total of the resident members stands this year between the numbers of four and five years ago, while that of the non-resident members is at 186, the highest figure yet reached in the history of the Society; and that of the subscribing libraries is 27, also the highest figure yet reached.\n## ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1891.\n\n### RECEIPTS.\n\n| Description                                                                 | \u00a3   | s. | d. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|----|----|\n| Balance at Bankers', January 1, 1891                                        | 26  | 19 | 8  |\n| do.

ASHBURNER.\nOne consequence of these figures is the increase of a little over one hundred pounds in the total receipts of the Society for the year 1891, as compared with the figures presented to you at our last meeting. The advertisements, which figure this year in our accounts for the first time, show a receipt of \u00a318 5s. 8d., and the increase in the amount received for subscriptions from members is only a few shillings less than \u00a370. One of the reasons for this improvement in our income is the increase in receipts from advertisements, and from the sale of the Journal. Now that the Society is its own publisher, the whole benefit of any such increase accrues to the Society without any abatement for discount or agency charges. Under both of these latter heads also, as in the number of members and of subscribing libraries, the Council expresses its full confidence that the Society may expect each year an increase, steady, if provokingly slow, in its receipts.\n\nOn the expenditure side there is an increase of \u00a320 owing to the higher rent the Society has to pay under its new lease, an increase of \u00a330 in the expenditure on the Society's Journal (most of this being in illustrations), and an increase of \u00a330 under the head of lectures. The general result of the whole account is a balance, in spite of these increased expenditures, of rather more that \u00a350 on the year's working.\n\nAs you are aware from the last report, the signs of revival in the Society, continued now through successive years, have encouraged the Council to undertake the publication of a printed catalogue of the Society's valuable library\u2014a work which has, for more than a generation, been a crying want. The preparation of this catalogue, which has entailed considerable labour on all concerned, is now complete; more than 200 pages are actually struck off, several sheets more are in type, and the whole is expected to be published by the end of this year. It will be no less than a landmark in the history of the Society to have carried to a successful completion so long-delayed and so useful, even necessary, a work.\n\nThe Council has reason to congratulate the Society on the quality of the papers which are now being offered to them in increasing numbers. They have selected for publication Mr.\nRockhill's standard articles on the present geography and ethnography of Tibet, a detailed account drawn from the Chinese, giving entirely new information which may any day prove to have a political, in addition to its scientific, value. There have appeared also translations of four new Oriental texts (in two cases accompanied by the texts themselves), and the Society has returned to its old love, Assyriology, by publishing five cuneiform texts with translation and notes. The Council considers this side of Oriental enquiry of so much importance that it has decided to issue, as a separate book for students, a selection of reprints from the cuneiform articles to appear in this year's Journal. It is impossible to over-estimate the historical importance of these very early records of mankind, and the Council trusts that the course it has adopted will meet with your approval, more especially as such reprints are comparatively inexpensive.\n\nDuring the year a systematic re-arrangement and re-numbering of the very valuable MSS. in the possession of the Society has been undertaken. It would be very desirable to have full catalogues of all these MSS. (such as the catalogue of the Hodgson Buddhist MSS. prepared by Professors Cowell and Eggeling) printed in the Society's Journal. It would, however, be too costly a proceeding, in the present state of the Society's finances, to have such catalogues prepared by competent scholars. To make these MSS., many of which have lain for years unused on the Society's shelves, better known to scholars, rough lists of the titles only have therefore been prepared, and these will appear from time to time in the Journal. The special thanks of the Society are due in this respect to its hon. librarian, Dr. Codrington, to Dr. Wenzel and to General Ardagh, who have prepared such lists of the Malay, Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, and Burmese MSS. A rough list of the Sanskrit MS. (not Buddhist) has already appeared, and lists of the Pali and Sinhalese MSS. have been also prepared during the year under review.\n\nThe year 1891 was further memorable by the fact that the Society's lease expired in that year. The Council spent\na great deal of time and anxious thought in the endeavour to make the best decision in the Society's interest on this important and difficult question of what course to adopt. Other premises were viewed, and other offers considered, but it was finally decided best on the whole to retain our present premises, though that could only be done at the cost of an increased yearly rental. By the terms of the old lease the Council was compelled to spend a sum of over \u00a3200 on the repair of the roof, and on the internal decoration of its rooms. The Society may regret that so large a sum, which it would have preferred to spend on the purchase of books, or in the publication of translations of Oriental texts, has been absorbed by this claim upon it. But the expenditure was absolutely necessary, and indeed legally incumbent on the Society; and it will not recur for many years to come.\n\nThe Council has to express its regret that no item appears in the accounts for 1891 for expenditure on books. The margin of available funds was so very narrow that the Council felt it could not recommend any expenditure on this head. But there are a considerable number of books, in various branches of Oriental literature (over and above those the Society receives as presents from the authors or from public or semi-public bodies) which the Society ought to possess. An amount of \u00a3100 a year at least would be required to supply the gaps on the Society's shelves where books of first class importance and interest ought to stand. And at least \u00a350 a year will have to be spent for several years to come on bookbinding and repairs in order to put even the existing library in a satisfactory state in this respect. The Council would venture urgently to press home upon the members and on all friends of Oriental and historical research the desirability of donations either of books or of money to meet these crying defects. In this respect the Council has much pleasure in announcing the gift of a handsome selection of books on Siamese history and allied subjects from Mr. Satow, late Her Majesty's Consul at Bangkok.\nThe Council regrets that the same want of funds has prevented it pushing forward, as it would have wished, the revived Oriental Translation Fund. But as the Society is aware, the generosity of one of their number has already rendered possible the publication of two volumes, and others are to follow under the same auspices. The Council has very much pleasure in announcing that the President of the Society, the Right Honourable the Earl of Northbrook, has most generously undertaken to defray the cost up to the amount of one hundred guineas of the publication of some standard work, if possible Sanskrit, dealing with Indian history. The Council has accordingly selected the Harsha Carita, a work, perhaps, more urgently required than any other, and is glad to inform you that Professor Cowell, of Cambridge, has undertaken, with the assistance of Mr. Thomas, of Trinity College, to make the translation into English.\n\nAs announced in the lists read at the commencement of the Report, the Society has lost during the year 1891 no less than five of its Honorary Members. Under the rules of the Society vacancies in the list of such members can be filled up only at the Annual General Meeting; and the total number of Honorary Members is not to exceed thirty. The thirty names should be, as far as possible, those of the thirty most distinguished Orientalists in the world, and due regard being had to the representation of as many countries, and also of as many sides of Oriental activity as possible. With these objects in view the Council recommends for election on this occasion\n\nProf. Schrader,\nBrugsch Pasha,\nM. Emile Senart,\nSumangala Mah\u0101 N\u0101yaka Unn\u0101ns\u0113, and\nProf. Vasilief.\n\nBy the rules of the Society Professor Robertson Smith and Professor Sayce, who were elected Vice-Presidents of the Society three years ago, retire from office at this meeting.\nThe Council begs to recommend that they be elected Vice-Presidents for another three years, and that the Rev. James Legge, D.D., Professor of Chinese at the University of Oxford, be also elected a Vice-President of the Society.\n\nBy the rules of the Society the following five members, of whom two are re-eligible, retire this year from the Council.\n\nMr. E. Delmar Morgan,\nMr. Arbuthnot,\nMr. Dickins,\nSir M. E. Grant-Duff, and\nProf. Macdonell.\n\nThe Council proposes for election to fill these vacant places:\n\nMr. E. Delmar Morgan,\nMr. F. F. Arbuthnot,\nThe Rev. J. C. Ball,\nMr. E. W. Gibb, and\nDr. Rost.\n\nCopies of the yearly Balance Sheet, as certified by the Honorary Auditors, lie on the table.\n\nMr. Delmar Morgan moved, and General Pearse seconded the adoption of the Report. This motion, on being put to the meeting, was carried unanimously.\n\n21st June, 1892.\u2014The Earl of Northbrook, President, in the Chair.\n\nThe election of the following new members was announced.\n\n1.

OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nGeneral Sir Lewis Pelly, K.C.B., K.C.S., M.P.\u2014The news of the sudden death of this amiable and distinguished officer, at the age of 67, fell heavily on the ears of his numerous friends and admirers. He joined this Society in 1858, and had served on the Council, and contributed papers to this Journal. He went out to Bombay in the Native Infantry\nin 1841, but at a very early date he was employed in the Political Department under Sir James Outram and General John Jacob, and he accompanied the former in the Persian expedition in 1856. In 1859 he was Secretary of Legation at Teher\u00e1n, and became Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires on the retirement of Sir Henry Rawlinson. In 1861\u20132 he acted as Consul on the East Coast of Africa; in 1862 he became Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and in 1872 he accompanied Sir Bartle Frere on his mission to Zanzibar. In 1873 he was Agent to the Governor-General in Rajput\u00e1na, and in 1874 he was Special Commissioner at Bar\u00f3da. In 1876 he was appointed Plenipotentiary for the frontier discussion of Afghan affairs, at the special desire of the Viceroy, Lord Lytton, and soon after he returned to England, having received repeatedly the thanks of the Government of India, and the Orders attached to his name. His public career in India and Persia was most remarkable.\n\nBut there was a literary side of his career also: he was an admirable Persian scholar, and he contributed to the Proceedings of Scientific Societies, published separate pamphlets, was a constant writer in periodicals and newspapers, and under his direction was collected and published the Miracle Play of Hasan and Hasain, a set of thirty-seven dramatic scenes, concerning which the Times, in a long review under date August 19th, 1879, remarked that it was full of matter of the highest value to the student of comparative theology; in fact it was a work unique of its kind, and which no one could have put forth who had not the peculiar experiences and knowledge of Sir Lewis Pelly.\n\nIn 1885 he stood successfully in the Conservative interest for the Northern Division of Hackney, and sat for that borough up to the date of his death. He knew certain subjects well, and wisely confined himself to those subjects, and when he spoke, his words had due weight. He was a Director of the Imperial British East African Company, and his last utterance in the House of Commons was in connection with the affairs of East Africa, with which his official experience had made him very familiar.\nHe was extremely courteous in his manner, and agreeable and instructive in his conversation, and he was one of the best type of the Anglo-Indian officials.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nJune 9th, 1892.\n\nMr. Stephen Austin, of Hertford.\u2014The death, at the age of 87, occurred at Hertford on Saturday, the 21st of May, of one who in years was perhaps the oldest member of the Royal Asiatic Society. Mr. Austin was printer to the East India College at Haileybury until it was closed in 1858. Supported by the authorities of that institution, he started the printing and publishing of works in Oriental languages, and for many years he was one of the very few Oriental printers in England. As an Oriental printer he acquired a worldwide reputation, and many of the finest specimens of Oriental typography have borne his name. In 1834 he started the newspaper since known as the Hertfordshire Mercury, and for upwards of fifty years he actively superintended its publication. After the extinction of the East India Company the college buildings at Haileybury were purchased by the British Land Company as a speculation; and it was largely owing to the unwearying exertions and persevering energy of Mr. Stephen Austin that the old college was preserved as a place of education, and the present successful public school founded on its site. For the last 25 years the Journal of the Society has been printed at Hertford, and a great variety of Oriental types have been introduced into its pages in beautiful style and with great accuracy: books were produced from his press in the following languages, Sanskrit, Bang\u0101l\u012b, Arabic, Persian, Pashtu, Hindustani, Hind\u012b, and Hebrew, all these with different or varying alphabets: there were also considerable issues in the more familiar languages and alphabets of Europe, Greek, Latin, French, and English.\n\nMr. Austin received gold medals from Her Majesty the Queen and the Empress Eugenie of France, in acknowledgment of the taste and skill displayed in his productions, and medals of the first class at the International Exhibitions of\nParis and London, and in 1883 the Congress International des Orientalistes presented him with a diploma for services rendered to Oriental literature.\n\nFull of enterprize in early life, and of sympathetic intelligence in his declining years, he secured to himself firm and lasting friendships: he was highly appreciated for his services by his fellow citizens, and his death has left a gap which will not easily be filled.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nJune 8, 1892.\n\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nThe Game of Wei Chi.\u2014At a recent meeting at Shanghai of the China branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, M. Volpicelli read a paper on \"The Game of Wei-chi,\" which, he said, was the great game of China. It is considered by the Chinese to be far superior to chess, and to be the special game of the literary class. Wei-chi possesses interesting features and requires great skill in playing. It has for us the merit of absolute novelty, because it differs essentially from all Western games. Unlike chess or draughts, the men are never taken, but remain where they are played. The game is not a series of skilful evolutions, but a successive occupation of points which, joined together, give a final winning position. Though the game is on a very extensive scale, the board containing 361 places and the men employed being nearly 200 aside, still it is very simple in principle, all the men having the same value and the same powers. To achieve the object of the game on such an extensive board requires great foresight and profound calculation. This object is to occupy as much space on the board as possible. He who at the end of the game commands most places has won. This can be carried out in two ways\u2014by enclosing empty spaces on the board with a certain number of one's men, and by surrounding and capturing the enemy's men. The name wei-chi comes from wei, meaning \"to surround.\" Though it is so easy to state\nin general terms the object the player has in view, it requires great skill to effect it if the player is matched with a good adversary. While he is trying to surround the enemy's men his are being surrounded by the adversary's, and this often occurs in the same part of the board, so that the men get interlocked and the position of one additional man may turn the scale. As there is no piece of vital importance, like the King at chess, and as the object of the game is of a general arithmetical character\u2014to secure most places\u2014the places lost in one part of the board may be compensated by surrounding the enemy in another quarter; so that wei-chi, instead of concentrating the attention of the player in one spot, as in chess, on the King, diffuses it all over the board. Very nice calculation is always necessary, so that one may balance the losses here with the gains there.\n\nThe game was first mentioned in Chinese writings about B.C. 625. It was probably derived from the Babylonian astronomers, who were at that time the teachers of the East. Chinese Emperors have been very fond of the game, though it subjects them to the necessity of forgetting their rank, and those who play with the Emperor sit in his presence. It is recorded of an Emperor of the fourth century that on one occasion he made a move irregularly. The courtier who was playing with him held the Monarch's finger, and the Emperor was not offended. This was thought important enough to be mentioned in history.\n\nKhalsa College.\u2014The Sikh community at Lahore has been celebrating the opening of the new College for the education of the Sikhs there.\n\nMr. Fleet.\u2014We are glad to see that the University of G\u00f6ttingen has granted to Mr. Fleet the Honorary Degree of Philosophiae Doctor for his distinguished services to Indian epigraphy and other branches of historical study in India.\n\nCaptain Boucer's Expedition.\u2014This traveller, together with Dr. Thorold and the rest of the party, arrived safely in Shanghai on Tuesday, the 12th of March, having traversed Ladak and a portion of Tibet.\nThe Mythical Bird (Syena, Saena, Rok Garu\u1e0da).\u2014Mr. Casartelli, M.R.A.S., has sent to the library a copy of his brochure on the Vedic, Persian, Arabic, and later Indian forms of this legend. The little pamphlet is a very excellent guide to the literature of the subject, and contains a very ingenious and probably true explanation of the mysterious name Rukh, or Rokh, given to this gigantic bird in the Arabian Nights.\n\nJ\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvara.\u2014At Alundi, about ten miles from Poona, an annual festival is held in honour of an old Mahratta scholar of this name, who is supposed to have lived at the end of the twelfth century, and to have completed his Dny\u0101nesvari (a commentary in old M\u0101r\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b on the Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101) in the Saka year 1212. He is also the author of the J\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvaras\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6daka mentioned in Burnell\u2019s Catalogue.\n\nCremation of D. A. De Silva Batuwantudava Pandit.\u2014A correspondent, Mr. Capper, of the Ceylon Times, has sent us the following interesting particulars as supplied to that paper:\n\n\"Last Saturday morning there was a copious supply of white sand strewn from one corner to the other in Dam Street, which, according to Eastern custom, indicated an occurrence of a most dismal nature. It was the cremation day of Pandit Batuwantudava, an oriental scholar, whose equal can hardly be found in Ceylon. As the day wore on groups of sympathizers and friends were wending their way to his residence; and by 3 p.m., the appointed time for the removal of his remains, there was a large concourse of people assembled, not deterred by the inclemency of the weather which continued throughout the day. Precise to time, the hearse moved on in the following order of procession: First, there was a cart containing pori (roasted paddy), which was sprinkled all along the way as a mark of respect for the departed. Next followed a number of boys with banners and flags, succeeded by a dozen tomtom beaters, who played a sort of dead march. Then came the hearse with the pall-bearers, followed closely by the principal mourners, sons, and near relations of the\ndeceased, the numerous sympathizers and friends closing the procession.\n\n\"At the crematorium over 200 Buddhist priests of different sects awaited the approach of the hearse. There were the high priest Sumangala and his followers, Dharmarama and his followers, Suriyagoda priest representing the Malwatta Vihara, Mulleriyawa priest representing the Cotta sect, and also the priests of the Amarapura sect.\n\n\"After the coffin was removed and laid on the pyre by the relatives of the deceased, the usual offering of cloths (pansakula) was made by them to the priests. The time having come for the oration over the deceased, the high priest by right of office had to discharge this duty. He was, however, overpowered with grief at the sad bereavement he had sustained in the loss of one who was dear to him as a fellow student in early days, and as a fellow labourer in the literary field later in life. He could only speak a few words, deputing the work to priest Nanissara, his ablest pupil, who delivered a short and comprehensive speech, first dwelling on the unselfish, pure, and modest life led by the deceased, combined with abilities in the department of oriental languages rarely to be met with; next, the duty of relations and friends to honour such a man; and, lastly, what benefits they will derive therefrom. The discourse being over, the pyre was set fire to by the nephew (sister's son, Mr. F. S. Abeyratna) of the deceased, in accordance with ancient rites.\n\n\"Thus closes the last scene in the life of Pandit Batuwantudaya. That he has rendered eminent service for his country's good goes without question. A better knowledge of medicine has been disseminated among the native vedaralas by Sanskrit works being translated into the vernacular by the pandit; and his efforts in the direction of religious and metaphysical works have given an impetus to oriental studies among Buddhist priests and laymen, and have also opened the way to those interested in the study of Buddhism. His work in connection with the Mah\u0101wansa, required by the Ceylon Government, should receive marked\nrecognition. A few pages of the T\u012bk\u0101 (commentaries) was being revised by the pandit when he was cut off. One of his sons is treading in his footsteps, and with oriental studies he combines a knowledge of modern languages which was wanting in the pandit, and which placed him at a very great disadvantage with oriental scholars in Europe.\u2014Ceylon Times.\n\nMohammedan Coins.\u2014Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole has just finished his \"Catalogue of the Coins of the Mogul Emperors of Hindustan in the British Museum,\" from the invasion of Baber in 1525 to the establishment of a British currency by the East India Company in 1835. It contains descriptions of over 1400 coins, chiefly gold and silver, 500 of which will be represented in the autotype plates illustrating the work. As the Museum possesses incomparably the finest collection in the world of this splendid coinage the volume will offer a special interest to Indian students and collectors. In his introduction, Mr. Lane-Poole deals with the various historical, geographical, and other problems suggested by the coinage, and with the difficulties of classification presented by the early imitative issues of the East India Company and the French Compagnie des Indes. This volume, the fourteenth, will complete the description of the entire collection of Mohammedan coins in the Museum, which has been in course of publication since 1835 and with which may be grouped the same author's analogous \"Catalogue of the Arabic Glass Weights,\" 1891, and Mr. R. S. Poole's \"Catalogue of Persian Coins.\"\n\nIndian Numismatics.\u2014Mr. Rodgers, Honorary Numismatist to the Government of India, has finished his \"Catalogue of the Coins with Persian or Arabic Inscriptions in the Lahore Museum,\" and practically finished his \"Catalogue of the Coins in the Calcutta Museum.\" His own immense collection has now been purchased by the P\u0101\u00f1j\u0101b Government, and he has nearly completed his catalogue of that. These catalogues will be of very great importance alike for the numismatics, and for the modern history of India, and we congratulate the distinguished author on the completion of his laborious task.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nIndian Scholars.\u2014We have been requested to publish the following correspondence:\n\n63, Elm Park Gardens, S.W.,\n27th May, 1892.\n\nMy Lord,\u2014I am one of the oldest students of the Languages of British India, and venture to address your Lordship on the subject of the necessity of extending some additional encouragement to the study of these languages, and of Indian Archaeology.\n\nThe abolition of the Indian Army, and of a Covenanted Civil Service trained in a special college, has cut away the sources of the former supply of Oriental scholars. No civilian of the past generation would have had any scientific knowledge of languages if he had not been trained at the East India College of Haileybury.\n\nThe Civil and Military services do not now produce scholars; no doubt for their special duties they are equally, or even more, efficient, but the steady flow of Oriental scholars has ceased. The Educational Department does not supply the void, and language is but a small fraction of that Department. Nor does the native community, with some rare and splendid exceptions, supply scholars who can hold their own in European circles.\n\nThis failure is becoming yearly more manifest at the triennial Congresses of Oriental Scholars held at the different capital cities of Europe, nearly all of which I have attended.\n\nIf any post falls vacant, requiring scholarship, in Great Britain, or the Colonies, or even in British India, a Continental scholar has to be sent for, which wounds the amour propre of the subjects of Her Majesty.\n\nIt occurs to the undersigned, who at the close of a long career dedicated to the best interests of British India, has no personal object to serve, to suggest that your lordship might, with advantage, extend to young scholars in Oriental Languages and Indian Archaeology, the same encouragement of Imperial favour, as is properly extended to the great Engineer, or Soldier, or Judge, or Administrator; some members of the very distinguished Civil and Military\nServices might then be induced to strive to maintain the glories of the epoch which produced Sir W. Jones, Mr. Colebrook, and Dr. H. H. Wilson, and others of a later date. At present this branch of study is nearly entirely neglected.\n\nThe undersigned takes the liberty of illustrating his argument by two instances: Mr. Brian Hodgson, still living at the age of ninety, and the late Sir Henry Yule; the names of both these scholars is mentioned with respect and admiration in Continental circles. In their own country their services to literature have, in the first case been entirely unacknowledged, and in the latter, so tardily, that death accompanied the honour. It is true that they, and others of the older generation, have laboured for the work's sake, not for the chance of honour, and in that they have their full, and to them sufficient, reward; but the object of the State should be to encourage others, and it seems as if the younger generation is compelled now to enquire, what will pay best in the long run, and, as certainly Oriental study does not in that sense pay, it suffers, and the high repute of the British name suffers with it. It is an object of desire to secure to the British name an all round reputation in arts and arms, and in every branch of human science, especially in a branch so closely connected with the religion, customs, and culture, and welfare of the great Indian nation confided to our charge.\n\nIt is therefore, with the profoundest respect, that I suggest to your lordship, that year by year a certain number of honorary decorations be reserved to those who have distinguished themselves in the advance of Indian Languages, Literature, Archaeology, and Culture, whether Europeans or Natives of Asia. Some men return to their home, illustrious as Soldiers, or Statesmen, or Judges, or Engineers; let it be possible that to some it should be permitted to be honoured as Scholars, and possibly the fruit of their labours will survive into the next generation, when the achievements of the other illustrious public servants will be forgotten. It may perhaps be argued that in this respect, viz., in the enduring of their reputation to future ages, they have their\nreward, and that the Father of Buddhist research and the Author of the Life of Marco Paolo would gain no additional lustre from anything that the Secretary of State for India had it in his power to give, but perhaps the Secretary of State himself might derive honour from the fact that he honoured those who were deserving of honour; at any rate younger scholars would be encouraged. There are some who have not attained such honours, though worthy of them; there are others who would not care for them, if offered for their acceptance; but there are others who in youth or middle life, with still unexhausted powers, might be encouraged to labour on the prospect of the fruits of their labour being recognized, and in behalf of the young scholars now in India I venture to intrude on your lordship's patience.\u2014I am, your lordship's obedient servant,\n\nR. N. Cust.\n\nTo the Right Honble.,\nThe Secretary of State for India,\nIndia Office.\n\nCopy of Reply.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by Lord Cross to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, and to thank you for the suggestions contained in it as to the encouragement of Oriental Scholarship.\n\nHis Lordship desires me to say that your remarks will be borne in mind, and that a copy of your letter will be sent to the Viceroy for his information.\u2014I am, Sir, yours faithfully,\n\nA. W. William Wynn.\n\nIndia Office, June 10th, 1892.\nV.\u2014NOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nZUR GESCHICHTE UND KRITIK DES MAH\u0100BH\u0100RATA. VON DR. ADOLF HOLTZMANN. (Kiel, 1892.).\n\nIn this work the Epic is traced by Dr. Holtzmann (who incidentally complains of the almost exclusive attention bestowed on Vedic and dramatic literature) from its primeval Indo-Germanic home, to its development in India. There he asserts, \"Epos und Veda sind gleich alt,\" the Epic flourishing alongside of, but quite independent of, the religious and philosophic poetry of the Br\u0101hmans, being specially the property of the warrior caste, composed by bards at the courts of kings, and handed down by oral tradition. It had in its oldest forms as its gods Brahm\u0101, Indra, and Agni, and in its later developments Vishnu and Siva, and it was only gradually united into a chronological sequence, arranged so as to please the king at whose court the bard resided.\n\nThe instances of Polyandry, the rules of family right and caste customs, as well as the great freedom of women, are examined to show the age of the underlying portion of the poem. The construction of the poem, in its collected form, is believed by Dr. Holtzmann, after a careful and critical study of the chief personages, to be the work of one individual poet, whom he believes to have been a Buddhist, at the court of Asoka, or one of his immediate successors. The invasion of Alexander the Great is said to have roused a national spirit, and the Hindu monarch, who ruled at the time, is supposed to be depicted in the character of Suyodhana, or, as he appears afterwards in the Br\u0101hmanical revision, Duryodhana.\n\nReferences to Buddhism are suggested in C\u0101rv\u0101ka, the mendicant monk, in the connection between the name of Asvatth\u0101man and the ficus religiosa (asvattha): in the passing of the amulet in the forehead of Asvatth\u0101man (the personification of decaying Buddhism), to Yudhishthira, the believer in Vishnuism, and in the red cloth, Kash\u0101ya (Pali\nKas\u0101va) of the Buddhist (?) mendicant. The absence of any clear signs of Buddhism in the poem is accounted for by the suggestion that the Buddhism in its earliest form differed but slightly from Brahmanism, and that all signs of Buddhism were carefully expunged by the Br\u0101hmanical revisers. The first Br\u0101hmanical revision is ascribed by the author to the revolt from Buddhism caused by its leanings towards Sivaism adopted from the Demonology of the Dravidian aborigines. This revision was a wholesale falsification of the old Epic, Yudhishthira being in the new version extolled as a king after the hearts of the Br\u0101hmans, and Krishna exalted into an incarnation of Vishnu, a type of the pantheistic deity. The Br\u0101hmanical tendency is shown in the introduction of the Br\u0101hman Vy\u0101sa as the author of the poem substituted for Bh\u012bshma as the father of Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, and Vidura. A second Puranic revision was undertaken by the Br\u0101hmans between the years 900\u20131100, who found it necessary, as soon as all fear of opposition from Buddhism had passed away, to retain their supremacy and strengthen their position by incorporating the old Sivaitic superstitions into the poem, where they may be traced, according to Dr. Holtzmann, as mere mechanical mixtures, the old Vishnavite portions being on the other hand chemically combined. The enlargement of the poem, the metre and grammatical forms of which were then definitely fixed, the introduction of didactic sections, and even the addition of entirely new books were the result of this Puranic revision. The whole argument is in the highest degree interesting and suggestive. It will be followed by two further volumes. The first of these will give a critical survey of the additions, etc., of the whole poem, and also of the meaning and history of the various parts of it; and the second will deal with the relations of the poem to the rest of Sanskrit literature.\n\nC. H.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nGRAMMAR OF THE GUJARATI LANGUAGE. By Rev. Wm. Sr. Clair Tisdall, Missionary of C.M.S. (Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner and Co. London, 1892.)\n\nThis is one of the important series of Tr\u00fcbner's Collection of Simplified Grammars of the principal Asiatic and European Language, and the twenty-second of that series. The author is a missionary of the Church Missionary Society, and his knowledge has been obtained on the spot from intercourse with people who speak the language. The language is one of the important Arian languages of Northern India, which make up what may be called the Neo-Sanskritic family, as they occupy to the Sanskrit the same relation that the Neo-Latin Languages of Europe occupy to Latin. The population which speaks this language exceeds seven millions.\n\nOur author is by no means the first, or the only, grammarian in the field. The literature of this language in the strict sense is poor, but there is great activity in the Native presses, and a great many newspapers are published in Gujarati: there is one distinct and well-defined dialect, the Parsi, and the whole Bible is translated into the language. There is a form of written character peculiar to the language.\n\nThe author tells us in his preface that when he arrived in Bombay not a single copy of the earlier grammars could be obtained; he alluded to two Vernacular Grammars of later date, one by the Rev. J. Taylor, and the other by Sir T. C. Hope, Educational Inspector. He mentions also a Handbook of Gujarati Grammar by P. M. Bhatt.\n\nThe Grammar is accompanied by a set of Reading Lessons and a Vocabulary, and is very creditably turned out, and no doubt will be very useful.\n\nMarch 25th, 1892.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nGRAMMAR OF THE TELUGU LANGUAGE. By Henry Morris, Esq., late of H. M. Indian Civil Service. (Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner and Co. 1890.)\n\nThe Telinga or Telugu langage is one of the four great Dravidian forms of speech of South India, which have been\nenriched and strengthened by an infusion of Arian words. It is spoken by a population of nearly twelve millions, according to the Census of 1881, in a ring fence, and occupying the northern portion of the Province of Madras. It has a written character of its own; the symbols differ in form from the N\u00e1gar\u00ed alphabet of North India, but the group of the symbols in both alphabets is homogeneous indicating a common origin.\n\nIt is a language with a considerable literature, and well supplied with grammars and dictionaries, and the whole Bible has been translated into it; it is a vigorous and important vernacular. Mr. Morris' Grammar is carefully prepared, beautifully printed, and will be of great use to future students. A short text is given with a careful analysis.\n\nMarch 25th, 1892. R. N. C.\n\nA Comprehensive Grammar of the Sinhalese Language.\nBy Abraham Mendis Gunasekara, M.R.A.S., Ceylon Branch. (Colombo, Skeen.)\n\nThis substantial volume of 516 pages, royal 8vo., is by far the best and most complete grammar of the Sinhalese language which has yet appeared. Adapted primarily for the use of students and writers in the Ceylon Civil Service, it will also be found the most reliable work of reference on the subject by philological students here in Europe. It is a pity, however, that the book has not been constructed on historical principles. The forms given, not only in the paradigms of nouns, verbs, etc., but also in the examples on the rules of syntax, are not always in current use, and obsolete forms of different periods are given indiscriminately side by side. Sinhalese literature having lasted through so many centuries, during which the language was constantly changing, it is not possible to give any grammar that will apply equally to all the books it contains. It would have been better therefore either to omit the Elu forms not now in use or to trace the history of the various grammatical forms now obsolete, the insertion of which has so much increased the bulk of the work.\nART. IX.\u2014Catalogue and Description of 27 B\u00e1b\u00ed Manuscripts.\n\nBy E. G. Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\u00b9\n\nTo my second paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds in the J.R.A.S. for 1889 I added an Appendix (App. IV, pp. 1000\u20131008), wherein I briefly described some of the chief B\u00e1b\u00ed works of which I had obtained MSS. in Persia, arranging these according to their authorship and the date of their composition, where these could be determined. Of the MSS. themselves (some of which were of composite character) I gave no description. This I now regard as an error of judgement, since, for many reasons (and chiefly that in the future, when they shall pass into other hands, there may be no difficulty in identifying them), it is desirable that their contents should be clearly and succinctly stated. This defect in my previous work I now propose to remedy; but I should not perhaps have done so were it not that since the year 1889 I have acquired a considerable number of new MSS. from authentic sources, a description of which may facilitate the identification of B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. in other collections. To each of these MSS. I shall now give a distinctive press-mark, which shall be inscribed on the title-page, and which shall serve for its future identification. The whole class I denote by the letters BB (the first B indicating that they are B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS., the second that they form part of my collection).\n\n\u00b9 Throughout this article I employ, in referring to my previous writings on the B\u00e1b\u00eds, and to those of Baron Rosen, the abbreviations already explained at the beginning of my last article (J.R.A.S. for April, 1892, pp. 259\u2013260), which is itself denoted by the abbreviation B. iii, just as this article will in future be referred to as B. iv.\nI further subdivide them according to the source whence they were obtained as follows:\n\n(I.) MSS. obtained in Persia between the dates February 28th, 1888 (when I first succeeded in establishing communications with the B\u00e1b\u00eds at Isfah\u00e1n), and August 22, 1888, when I acquired my last Persian MS. (the Persian Bey\u00e1n) in Rafsinj\u00e1n near Kirm\u00e1n. MSS. of this class I denote by the letters BBP (the P standing for Persia).\n\n(II.) MSS. obtained from Cyprus as a result of the correspondence which, through the kindness of Captain Young, the Commissioner of Famagusta, I have been enabled to carry on since July, 1889, with \u015euh-i-Ezel (see T.N. ii, pp. xviii.-xx.) All these MSS., with the exception of three or four which were brought to \u015euh-i-Ezel from Persia in the summer of 1890, were transcribed by himself. I feel that it is only due to him to state that he undertook this laborious task solely from a desire to render the writings of his beloved Master accessible to the western world and out of sheer kindness to myself. I was unable to make him any return, save sundry little services utterly incommensurable with the value of his gifts, and quite undeserving of mention. All these MSS. (including one or two which he placed in my hands while I was in Cyprus in March-April, 1890) are denoted by the letters BBF (the F standing for Famagusta).\n\n(III.) MSS. obtained at Acre in April, 1888, or from Acre since that date. These were in all cases given or sent to me by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's eldest son, 'Abb\u00e1s Efendi, his second son, Badi'u'll\u00e1h, or his third son, Ziy\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\u00b9 When sent, they were accompanied by letters in which the title or nature of\n\n\u00b9 I believe that Beh\u00e1 has or had more than three sons, but these are all that I have seen or corresponded with.\nthe book was stated. These MSS. are denoted by the letters BBA (the A standing for Acre).\n\n(IV.) MSS. obtained from Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, a learned Ezeli resident in Constantinople, who is in constant communication with \u015eubh-i-Ezel, and is implicitly trusted by him, and of whose learning and integrity alike I have had good proof. These MSS. are denoted by the letters BBC (the C standing for Constantinople).\n\nThe MSS. in each class are further specified by a number appended to the class-letters, which number denotes simply the order in which they came into my hands. Thus the first MS. obtained from Famagusta is denoted as BBF. 1, the second as BBF. 2, and so on. With this preliminary explanation of the plan of classification adopted (which, it will be observed, is empirical rather than rational, but which nevertheless appeared to me for several reasons the most satisfactory), I proceed to the detailed enumeration of the MSS., some of which, having been elsewhere sufficiently noticed, can be dismissed very shortly, while others will need a fuller description.\n\nClass I. MSS. obtained in Persia.\n\nBBP. 1.\n\n\u0627\u06cc\u0642\u0627\u0646\n\nFf. 82 (ff. 1a, 81b, 82a, and 82b blank), 22\u00b725 x 11\u00b725 centimetres, 22 lines to the page. Bought at Isfah\u00e1n on March 1st, 1888, for 26 kr\u00e1ns (rather less than sixteen shillings). Unfortunately it has twice suffered serious damage, firstly by the bursting open of a portable ink-bottle with which it was packed, whereby the margins of the leaves were much stained; and, secondly, by the adhesion of a good many opposite leaves (either from undue pressure or unusual stickiness of the ink) in the process of\nbinding. In many parts it is consequently now almost illegible, though when I described it in 1888 it was in good condition.\n\nFor a general account of the work see Baron Rosen's description in *Coll. Sc.* iii, pp. 32\u201351; *B.* ii, pp. 944\u20139; and *Coll. Sc.* vi, pp. 143\u20134.\n\nThe work was composed, as I have already shown (p. 305 supra), two years after Beh\u00e1's return to Baghdad from the mountains of Kurdist\u00e1n, i.e. in A.H. 1274 (A.D. 1858\u20139), while he still owned allegiance to Subh-i-Ezel. The passage which proves this has been already alluded to (*cf.* also *B.* ii, p. 946), but it is so important that, as it is not included in the extracts given by Baron Rosen, I here give it in full. It occurs on ff. 78b\u201379b of the present MS., and ff. 123a\u2013125a of the Acre MS. which will be described presently. I follow the latter, which offers a better as well as a more legible text.\n\n\u0628\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0647\u0644

Given to me by the B\u00e1b\u00eds of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z in April, 1888. Concerning this important work see pp. 318\u20139 supra; B. i, p. 496; B. ii, pp. 1002\u20133; Coll. Sc. vi, p. 244; and T.N. ii, pp. 192\u20137 and passim.\n\nRecent researches have thrown no small light on the origin and authorship of this history. As the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press have consented to publish an abridged translation of it which I have prepared, I prefer to reserve a full discussion of these points for the Introduction to that work, and will here confine myself to a brief statement of the more important facts.\n\nI have previously had occasion to observe (p. 319 supra) that the T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd was in great measure based on a contemporary history of the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement written by H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, who suffered martyrdom at Teher\u00e1n in 1852. Till quite recently all my attempts to discover some trace of the earlier work proved ineffectual. Last Easter, however, I at length found opportunity to examine the five B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. belonging to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris which were brought back from Persia by Count Gobineau. Of these five MSS. two were in Persian and three in Arabic. Of the former, one (Suppl. Pers. 1,070) contained part, and the other (Suppl. Pers. 1,071) the whole of a partly doctrinal, partly historical work which at once rivetted my attention, and which, as I hope to prove conclusively in the Introduction to my translation of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd, appears to be nothing less than the hitherto lost work of H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed. I was not able to subject this MS. to an exhaustive examination, the period of my stay in Paris not sufficing for this, but I found in it, reproduced almost word for word, the bulk of the more important narratives quoted from H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed\u2019s work in the T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd, these being told either as the writer\u2019s own experiences, or as accounts heard at first-hand from those concerned. If this Parisian MS. be indeed (as I for my part feel assured is the case) the history of H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed, its value can scarcely be over-estimated.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nNot less important are the results of inquiries instituted amongst the B\u00e1b\u00eds of \u2018Ishk\u00e1bad by Lieutenant Toumansky (of whose previous researches some account will be found at pp. 318-322 supra). Of these results, for the communication of which I am indebted to the unfailing kindness of Baron Rosen, Lieutenant Toumansky has most courteously permitted me to make use for this article. As I cannot possibly express them more clearly or more concisely than Baron Rosen has done, I prefer to quote his words. He writes:\u2014\u201cM.

Toumansky m\u2019a autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 vous \u00e9crire ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de. Tout cela repose naturellement sur l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Abou\u2019l-Fazl.

Moreover, as will be set forth at the end of this article,\nwhen I come to describe the MSS. bearing the press-marks BBC. 1 and BBC. 2, Seyyid Jiw\u00e1d actually composed two large volumes (the *Hasht Bih\u0161t*, vols. i and ii) on the Theory and Practice of the B\u00e1bi religion, which are strongly Ez\u00e9li in their proclivities. (See also *T.N. ii*, pp. 351\u2013371, and pp. 296\u20137 *supra*.) It is not unlikely, however, that the two or three passages in the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd* which refer to Beh\u00e1 may be interpolations of the copyist, and that, on the other hand, passages bearing reference to \u0160uhb-i-Ezel may have been excised. In any case the information obtained by M. Toumansky is invaluable, as affording a definite basis for further investigation.\n\n**BBP. 6.**\n\n*\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0633. \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646. \u0627\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d \u0645\u062a\u0641\u0631\u0642\u0629.*\n\nFf. 40 (ff. 1a and 40b blank), 17\u00b75 \u00d7 10\u00b75 centimetres.

Hereafter I will send you copies of such books as are accessible. Were it now the time when this recluse dwelt in \u2018Ir\u00e1k-i-\u2018Arab [i.e. Baghdad], many books could have been sent; but what avails it [now]? Most of them have passed into the hands of ignorant men, and these have pillaged them. [Only] a few remain in this land, and even these were conveyed [hither] with difficulty, because of the fewness of [my] friends. For this reason most of those books, whereof the worth was great, are no longer in my hands, save only a small fraction.\"\n\nIn answering this letter I enquired further as to the name and nature of this book, and in \u015euhb-i-Ezel\u2019s second letter, despatched from Famagusta on Oct. 1st, 1889, received reply as follows:\n\n\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u0632\u062f \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0639 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u062d\u06cc\u0631\u062a \u0646\u0642\u0637\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0631 \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u062d\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0631\u0622 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0639 \u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0622\u0646\u0686\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0645\u0630\u06a9\u0648\u0631 \u0644\u06cc\u06a9 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u06a9 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0648 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u0632\u062f\u0647 \u062c\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0686\u0647 \u0634\u0631\u062d \u0622\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0645\u0634\u0647\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u06a9\u062a\u0628 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0633\u0628\u06cc\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u062f\u0639\u0648\u0627\u062a \u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b \u0634\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0637\u0628 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0646\u0635\u0627\u062d\u062a \u0648 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a\u062a \u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0634\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u06cc\u0647 \u0648 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0627\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644\u06cc\u0646 \u0648 \u062e\u0627\u0645\u0633 \u0628\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0634\u0646\u0648\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0630\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0633\u062a *\n\"The book which was sent to you is [part] of the writings of the Bey\u00e1n and belongs to His Holiness the Point [i.e. the B\u00e1b]. It consists for the most part of prayers to the Fulfiller of needs. Who [else] is able to produce such words? What was revealed at first was called each book by a different name, but during the later period [of the B\u00e1b's life] all received one title and was called 'Bey\u00e1n.' And much [of this] he [i.e. the B\u00e1b] directed to be arranged in nineteen volumes, as is fully explained in the Persian Bey\u00e1n.1 But2 in the Bey\u00e1n different grades [or styles] are apparent. The first grade resembles previous [revealed] books;3 the second is of the nature of supplications and prayers; the third is [in] the style of exhortations, wherein he [i.e. the B\u00e1b] had regard to clearness and eloquence; the fourth [consists of] scientific treatises, commentaries, and answers to enquirers; and the fifth, which is [substantially] identical with the preceding styles, is in the Persian language.\" I have already pointed out in another place (T.N. ii, p. 346) how fully Sub\u1e25-i-Ezel's account of the B\u00e1b's writings and the meaning of the term 'Bey\u00e1n' accords with Gobineau's (Rel. et Phil., p. 311).\n\nThis present work, then, contains a collection of Prayers belonging to the \"second grade\" of the Bey\u00e1n, using this term in its wider signification as connoting all the B\u00e1b's later writings. Owing to the number of these prayers, and the limited space at my disposal, I can only give the opening words of each.\n\n(No. 1, on f. 2b)\n\n\u0645\u062c\u062f \u06a9\u0627\u0641\u0631

This book is by His Holiness the Point [i.e. the\nB\u00e1b]. There has been no tampering with it on the part of certain persons, save in so far as may have resulted from slips of the pen. For though I myself copied out the previous manuscript and this one, still it may be that there has chanced some defect in the manner of its arrangement, the original copy not being available. But [at least] it has not been tampered with by outsiders, as certain persons have tampered with some passages, whereby textual corruptions have arisen. Please God there has been no interpolation in what this humble servant [of God] has written.\u201d To the first piece (on f. 2b) is prefixed the title \u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646.\n\nThe contents of the MS., stated as briefly as possible, are as follows:\n\n(No. 1, on f. 2b)\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0644\u0647\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\n\n(No. 2, on f. 7b)\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u064a\n\u0644\u0627\u0634\u0647\u062f\u062a\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\n\u0642\u062f \u0634\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0639\u0638\u0645\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0644\u0644\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0645\u0644\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\n\n(No. 3, on f. 12b)\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f\n\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0642\u062f \u062a\u062c\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\n\u0627\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0632\u0644\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0639 \u0641\u0648\u0642 \u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627\u062a\n\u0628\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0638\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\n\n(No. 4, on f. 17b)\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0638\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062b\u0645 \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0629 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\n\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0632\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0632\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0644 \u0648\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0641\u0627\u0634\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0645\n\u064a\u0632\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u063a\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0639\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0639\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\n\n1 MS. \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0628\u0639\u060c which is doubtless a mere slip.\n(What follows the exordium is mostly in Persian.)\n\nBismillah al-wahid al-awhad (No. 6, on f. 27b)\nBismillah al-muwa\u1e25id al-muwa\u1e25id (No. 7, on f. 32b)\nBismillah al-wahid al-awhad al-hamd li-Allah al-mashriq qadse (No. 8, on f. 36b)\nBismillah al-wahid al-awhad al-hamd li-Allah al-mashriq qadse (No. 9, on f. 40b)\nBismillah al-wahid al-awhad tafriq wa-tamniq basat (No. 10, on f. 44b)\n\n(The last four and a half lines on f. 46a and the whole of f. 46b are blank, but there appears to be no interruption in the continuity of the text.)\n(Part of this piece will be found on pp. 318-319 of T.N. ii.

appendix or peroration to the rest, it will be observed that the remaining forty fall into groups of five, each group beginning with the same formula. Thus the first five begin with the formula \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645, the second with \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645, etc. We may fairly assume that within each group the first piece represents what the B\u00e1b calls the \u201cfirst grade\u201d or \u201cstyle\u201d of his writings, the second piece the second grade, and so on. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the last piece in each group of five is in Persian, and therefore corresponds to the B\u00e1b\u2019s \u201cfifth grade\u201d (see p. 453 supra). Of the majority of these pieces it must be frankly confessed that they are not only untranslateable, but almost unreadable, consisting merely of endless permutations (often etymologically and grammatically impossible) of the different \u201cNames\u201d of God.\n\nBBF. 3.\n\nFf. 200 (ff. 1a\u20132a, 199b\u2013200b blank), 20\u00b75 x 13 centimetres, 14 lines to the page.

Alluding to the visit which, as I informed him, I had paid to Sheykh \u1e6cabars\u012b, he said:\n\n\u062f\u0631 \u0637\u0628\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0634\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u062c\u0627 \u0631\u0633\u0645\u06cc\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f\n\u0632\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u062a\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0647\u062a \u0622\u0645\u0627\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0628\u062a\n\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0633\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a \u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638\u0647 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062f.\n\n\"If you have visited \u1e6cabars\u012b it is as though you had been at all [the holy] places. The form of visitation specially [appointed] for that place is contained in the book which will reach [you] this time: read it.\" In reply to further enquiries, \u1e62ub\u1e25-i-Ezel said that this form of visitation was composed by the B\u00e1b himself. To this MS., as to the last, is prefixed the title \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646, evidently in that wide sense to which I have already adverted (p. 453 supra). As it contains a great number of pieces, I must, for the sake of brevity, confine myself to the briefest enumeration of all save the most interesting.\n\nThe first five pieces (extending from f. 2b to f. 27b) begin with the formula \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0642\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0642\u0649, and appear to represent each of the \"five grades\" above described, the fifth of the group being, as usual, in Persian, and beginning in the same way as the Persian pieces already described. The first of these, containing endless permutations of the root \u0642\u062f\u0645, is much the longest, extending to f. 23b.\n\nNext follows another similarly arranged group of five pieces (ff. 23b\u201355a), each beginning with the formula \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0642\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0642\u0649. Of these again the first contains permutations of the root \u0642\u0631\u0628, and the last is in Persian.\n\nNext follows a third group of five pieces (ff. 55a\u201376a) beginning with the formula \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u06cc\u06cc, and arranged like the preceding.\n\nThe 16th piece (ff. 76a\u201378b) is preceded by the formula \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0645, and begins:\nThe 17th piece (ff. 78b\u201382a) begins with the formula\n\nBismillah al-mumtajib al-munif,\n\nand proceeds:\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0639\u0650\u0646\u062f\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0639\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0632\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0645\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u062c\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0630\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0627\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0630\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0639\u0650\u0646\u062f\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0644\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0623\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064f\u0646\u062a\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064b\u0627.\n\nSince Nabil is, as I have shewn (B. ii, p. 997), equivalent to Muhammad, it is clear that we have here an epistle addressed to a B\u00e1b\u00ed named Muhammad \u2018Al\u00ed, presumably either to Mull\u00e1 Muhammad \u2018Al\u00ed of B\u00e1rfur\u00fash (Jen\u00e1l-i-Kudd\u00fas) or Mull\u00e1 Muhammad \u2018Al\u00ed of Zanj\u00e1n, and probably to the latter.

The 27th is long (ff. 127a\u2013130a), is written partly in Persian, and contains answers to sundry questions addressed in writing to the B\u00e1b.\n\nNos. 28\u201345 (ff. 130a\u2013141a) are all short epistles addressed to believers who had written to the B\u00e1b. The names of these correspondents are mentioned in several cases, but their identification cannot be satisfactorily effected in a brief notice like this, and I therefore reserve them for future consideration.\n\nThe 46th piece is the document which I published and translated at pp. 996\u20137 of B. ii, wherein \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel is designated the B\u00e1b\u2019s successor.\n\nThe 52nd piece is the same as the first in BBF. 1, already described at p. 453 supra.\n\nThe 53rd piece (ff. 150a\u2013153a) is the 57th chapter of the Commentary on the S\u016bra-i-Yusuf (see pp. 261\u20138 supra), containing the explanation or expansion of v. 56 of the S\u016bra.\nThe 58th piece is an extract from the *Book of the names* (\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621; see *T.N.* ii, pp. 202, 318, 338), to which are prefixed ordinances bearing on the arrangement of the B\u00e1b\u00ed calendar. The year is here explicitly described as consisting of 361 days (19 \u00d7 19), and no mention is made of the intercalary days used by the Beh\u00e1'\u00eds, so that these would seem to have been introduced by Beh\u00e1 (cf. *T.N.* ii, pp. 419, 422\u20135). This preface concludes with a command that all letters shall be fully dated, according to the B\u00e1b\u00ed method, and, as a specimen, a date (seemingly that whereon this document was written) is given in full, as follows:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0648 \u062a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0648 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0636\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u062b\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u062b\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0627\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u0646\u0626\u0630 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0643\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0636\u0648\u0627\u0646\n\nThe date thus given is \u201cthe day of Istikl\u00e1l [Friday], the day of \u2018Ilm [the 12th day] of the month \u2018Ilm [the 12th month] of the year J\u00e1b\u201d [\u062c+\u0628+\u0661=\u0666], so that the document must have been written during the last year of the B\u00e1b\u2019s life (October, 1849). For this reason, if for no other, it is interesting.\n\nThe 59th piece is a letter of instructions to \u015euhb-i-Ezel, who therefore prefixes to it, as to some of the letters previously described, the words\u2014\n\n\u201cSome of the behests given to this servant.\u201d It begins as follows:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0644\n\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u064a\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0648\u0628\n\u0634\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u064a\u062d\u064a\u064a \u0648\u064a\u062d\u064a\u064a \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u064a\u062a \u0648\u064a\u062d\u064a\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0648 \u062d\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0648\u062a\nThe following passage (on f. 175a) is important, as implying not only that the B\u00e1b regarded \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel as his sole vicegerent, but that he did not contemplate such a contingency as the appearance of \u201cHim whom God shall manifest\u201d in \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel\u2019s life-time:\n\n\u201cExhort to virtue those who believe in me and in my words, that they disagree not touching the Religion of God, [for then] shall they stray away from the Path. And if God cause one like unto thee to appear in thy days, then he it is to whom shall be bequeathed the authority on the part of God the Single, the One.\\(^1\\) But if [such an one] appears not, know for a surety that God hath not willed to make Himself known, and render up the authority to God, your Lord, and the Lord of the words, all.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately after this comes another passage, which is of considerable importance, as shewing that the B\u00e1b intentionally left the [Persian] B\u00e9yan incomplete, only publishing 11 of the 19 V\u00e1hid\u00eds,\\(^2\\) and, as stated by the Ezel\u00ed author of the Hasht Bihisht (see T.N. ii,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Here, as elsewhere (B. ii, p. 997), Wah\u00edd probably stands as equivalent to Yah\u00fad (i.e. \u0160ub\u1e25-i-Ezel).\n\n\\(^2\\) This affords another instance of Count Gobineau\u2019s extraordinary accuracy in all that he states concerning the B\u00e1bi literature and doctrines. See Religions et Philosophies, p. 332.\np. 353), conferring on \u015eubh-i-Ezel the right of completing it if the time should be propitious.

Of these he is instructed to keep one himself, and to distribute the other six to the \u201cLands of F\u00e1, \u2018Ayn, Kh\u00e1, Alif, M\u00edm, and K\u00e1f\u201d (i.e. F\u00e1rs, \u2018Ir\u00e1k, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, \u00c1zarbaj\u00e1n, M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n, and (?) Kirm\u00e1n). The particular believer in each of these provinces to whom the v\u00e1hid intended for that province is to be sent, is designated, but in a somewhat enigmatical manner, as follows:\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0622\u0621 \u064a\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a .... \u0648\u064e \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0642\u062f \u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0634\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645\u0627 .... \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062d\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0635\u062f\u0627\u0642 \u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0639\u0632 \u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0641 \u064a\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0631\u0628\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0644 \u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0627 \u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0628\u0647 \u064a\u0641\u0631\u062d\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u064a\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d \u0641\u0627\u062d\u0641\u0638\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0647\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0628\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0644\u0635\u064a\u0646\n\nIn a letter written by \u015eubh-i-Ezel on March 13th, 1892, in answer to questions addressed to him by myself as to the identity of the persons to whom allusion is here made, the\nfollowing explanations (some of which refer to other documents described in this article) were given. By *Ismu'l-Anis* (\"the Name of the Intimate\") H\u00e1j\u00ed Suleym\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, who accompanied the B\u00e1b on his pilgrimage-journey, and suffered martyrdom at Teher\u00e1n in 1852, is meant. *Ismu'l-Jaw\u00e1d* (\"the Name of the Generous\") denotes Ak\u00e1 Seyyid Jaw\u00e1d of Kerbel\u00e1, who died some eight years ago at Kirm\u00e1n. (See *T.N.* ii, p. 342, n. 2, and pp. 443\u20134 *supra.*)\n\nThe *Letter Sin* sometimes means \"*Jen\u00e1b-i-B\u00e1b*\" (*i.e.* Mull\u00e1 Huseyn of Bushraweyh, who inherited this title when his master declared himself to be the \"Point\"), and sometimes *Hazrat-i-Kudd\u00fas* (Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u00ed of B\u00e1rfur\u00fash). *Ism-i-Mu\u1e63avvir* (\"the Name of the Limner\") means the B\u00e1b himself. *Ism-i-Hujj\u00e1t* (\"the Name of the Proof\") means Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u00ed of Zanj\u00e1n. (*Cf.* p. 472 *supra.*)\n\n*Ism-i-\u1e62\u00e1di\u1e33* (\"the Name of the Faithful\") means Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e62\u00e1di\u1e33, called *Mukaddas-i-Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n*, \"the Saint of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n.\" *Ism-i-Rah\u00edm* (\"the Name of the Merciful\") was a Tabr\u00edz\u00ed, reports of whose death had been circulated. *Ism-i-Nabil* (\"the Name of the Noble\") denotes a certain H\u00e1j\u00ed Sheykh Mu\u1e25ammad of Kazv\u00edn, who died at L\u00e1hij\u00e1n in Gil\u00e1n during the Baghdad period. (The name *Nabil* always stands for *Mu\u1e25ammad*, with which it is numerically equivalent. *Cf.* *B.* ii, p. 997). By *Ismu'l-'Ali* (\"the Name of the High\") in the Land of F\u00e1rs, H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid \u2018Al\u00ed, the B\u00e1b\u2019s maternal uncle and guardian, and one of the \"Seven Martyrs,\" is no doubt meant.\n\nThe 60th piece (ff. 176b\u2013177a) contains more \"instructions\" addressed to \"the Name of the Merciful\", who is very probably the same *Rah\u00edm* mentioned in the last piece. \u1e62ub\u1e25-i-Ezel\u2019s authority is again asserted and confirmed in the following words:\nThe 61st piece, containing the B\u00e1b\u2019s testamentary dispositions as to his burial, is translated in part in n. 1 on p. 46 of the second volume of my Traveller\u2019s Narrative.

This form, interesting as illustrating the revival of Zoroastrian ideas by the B\u00e1b, begins as follows:\n\nThen I turned to the Sun and said: \"O Lord, the Sun is the branch of the Sun, and the Sun is the branch of the Sun.\"\n\nThe 65th and last piece (again described by \u015euh-i-Ezel as \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u062d\u0643\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0648\u0635\u0627\u064a\u0629 contains the B\u00e1b's instructions to those of his followers who shall visit the place of his martyrdom (\"the place where this Tree shall be struck down\"), together with the form of prayer to be used by them.

of the *Nagham\u00e1tu'r-R\u00fah* are repeated at the end of the *La'\u00e1li \u00fa Maj\u00e1l\u00ed* (f. 203a), and at the end of another MS. containing some of \u0160ubh-i-Ezel's Persian writings which will be described presently. They indicate, as \u0160ubh-i-Ezel informed me by word of mouth, that the writings to which they are appended are by him. Their significance, however, he was not willing to divulge to me. Probably they refer in some way to the *alj\u00e1d* notation.\n\n*La'\u00e1li \u00fa Maj\u00e1l\u00ed.*\n\nOf this piece also I shall give first of all the opening words of the exordium, then the short introductory preface, then a few specimens of the aphorisms or \"Sententiae,\" which, arranged in groups according to the position of the initial (or sometimes the final) letter in the alphabet, make up the remainder of the work.\nand so on for 23 similar sentences, the section ending with the words \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0629.\n\nThe second section (f. 107b) contains thirty-one short aphorisms beginning with the word \u0627\u062e\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0627, as, for example:\n\n\u0627\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0647\u062f \u062a\u062c\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0627\u062e\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0639\u064a\u062f \u062a\u062c\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0627\u062e\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0627\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u062c\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062e\n\nThe third section (ff. 107b\u2013109a) consists, for the most part, of aphorisms beginning with the definite article, further arranged according to the letter in which they end, e.g.:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0644 \u063a\u0633\u0642 \u0633\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0648\u0647\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u064a\u0644 \u062f\u0627\u062c\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u0642\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u062c\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u0631\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0631 \u0638\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u062f\u064a\u062c\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\nThe whole work, excluding the preface, consists of 179 such sections, arranged in groups alphabetically according to the initial letter of the aphorisms. The number of sections belonging to each letter varies. Sections i\u2013xix begin with \u0627; xx\u2013xxvii with \u0628; xxviii\u2013xxxiii with \u062a; xxxiv\u2013xxxvii with \u062b; xxxviii\u2013xli with \u062c; xlii\u2013xlvi with \u062d; xlvi\u2013lvi with \u062e; lii\u2013lv with \u062f; lvi\u2013lvii with \u0630; lix\u2013lxv with \u0631; lxvi\u2013lxx with \u062c; lxxi\u2013lxxv with \u0633; lxxvi\u2013lxxxii with \u0634; lxxxiii\u2013lxxxvi with \u0635; lxxxvii\u2013lxxxviii with \u0636; lxxix\u2013xcii with \u0637; xciii\u2013xcv with \u0638; xcv\u2013cv with \u0639; cvi\u2013cviii with \u063a; cix\u2013cxiii with \u0641; cxiv\u2013cxvi with \u0642; cxvii\u2013cxxxix with \u0643; cxxx\u2013clxii and again clxviii\u2013clxxi with \u0644; clxiii\u2013cl with \u0645; cli\u2013clvii with \u0646; clviii\u2013clxii with \u0648; clxiii\u2013clxvii with \u0647; clxxii\u2013clxxix with \u064a. The work thus consists entirely of short, disconnected aphorisms, and the specimens which I have given, though few, will, I think, sufficiently indicate its general character.\n\nThe last piece contained in the MS. is separated by three blank pages (ff. 204a\u2013205a) from the preceding one, is written in naskh, occupies only six pages, and begins abruptly as follows:\n\n\u0642\u062f \u0636\u0644\u0644\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0626\u0630 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0648\u0631\u062c\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0641\u0623\u0646\u0627\u062b\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u062a\u0645 \u0628\u064a\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u062a\u0623\u0647\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0626\u0630 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u062b\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0631\u0628\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u062a\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649\n\nEnds (on f. 208a):\n\n\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0643\u0630\u0628\u0627 \u0641\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0639\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649 \u0642\u062f \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0639 \u0639\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0622 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0647\u064a \u062d\u0633\u0628\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u062a\u0636\u0631\u064a\u0646 *\nBBF. 5.\n\n\u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0647 \u0628\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n\nFf. 274 (1a and 274b blank), 17\u00b775 x 10\u00b775 centimetres, 11 lines to the page.\n\nA collection of \u0160ubh-i-Ezel's Persian writings, transcribed by himself in a clear, graceful, and somewhat peculiar ta'lik hand, and containing a number of sections or chapters of various lengths, to each of which is prefixed a doxology, but no title. The full examination and description of such a collection being necessarily a work of time, I confine myself here to giving the beginning and ending. Near the end of the MS. is a rather long and very important piece wherein \u0160ubh-i-Ezel defines and defends his position, and enters a protest against the schism of the Beh\u0101'\u00eds. This piece I hope to publish with a translation in a subsequent number of the Journal.\n\nBegins:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0644\u064a\u0629\n\u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631\n\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0646\n\n\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0630\u06a9\u0631 \u0645\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0639\u062a \u0645\u0627 \u06cc\u06a9\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0631\n\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u062a\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u06cc\u0648\u062d\u062a \u0645\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0633\u0632\u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0644\u0645 \u06cc\u0632\u0644 \u0628\u062d\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a\n\u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u06cc\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0632 \u0648 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u062a \u0627\u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0636\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0631 \u0644\u062d\u0638\u0647 \u062f\u0631\n\u0634\u06a9\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0631 \u0646\u06af\u0645\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u063a\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0639 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0648\n\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u062f\u0627\u062f \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u0626\u06cc \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0635\u0641\u0647 \u0645\u0627\n\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0646\u0634\u0646\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u0686\u06cc\u0632 \u0648 \u0635\u0641\u062a \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u062e\u0644\u0642\u062a \u0632\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u06a9\u0647\n\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0645\u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062d \u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0644\u0642\n\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0644\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648 \u0628\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0648 \u0646\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0648\u0635\u0641\nThis and the three following MSS. (all containing works of the B\u00e1b) were not transcribed by \u015euhb-i-Ezel, but were transmitted to me through him from Persia. The circumstances under which they were conveyed from Teher\u00e1n to Cyprus and thence to me were somewhat peculiar. On July 9th, 1890, I received from Teher\u00e1n a letter from an unknown correspondent belonging to the Ezeli sect of the B\u00e1bis which bore as its date \u201cTuesday, Shaww\u00e1l 14th, A.H. 1307\u201d (June 3rd, 1890). After a preliminary doxology, the writer proceeded to explain that, being at Famagusta\nin Cyprus in the month of Zi'l-Ka'da, A.H. 1306 (July, 1889), he had been present when my first letter, asking for books and information, was handed to \u015eubh-i-Ezel, and had perused its contents; and that he had also been present when the \"Governor\" (i.e. the Commissioner of the district, Captain Young), called to see \u015eubh-i-Ezel and to converse with him through his interpreter. On leaving Cyprus to return to Persia he had been commanded by \u015eubh-i-Ezel to collect together such of the B\u00e1b's writings as he could (especially those concerning which I had more particularly enquired). On arriving at Teher\u00e1n he had accordingly set to work on this task, and had succeeded in obtaining copies of (1) The Commentary on the S\u00fara-i-Y\u00fasuf, or Ahsanu'l-K\u00edsas; (2) The Names of All Things (\u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0644\u0634\u064a); (3) The Commentary on the S\u00faratu'l-Bakar\u00e1; (4) The Commentary on the S\u00faratu'l-'A\u1e63r; (5) The Doxology of our Lady F\u00e1tima (\u062a\u0633\u0628\u064a\u062d \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0641\u0627\u0637\u0645\u0629). These books were to have been forwarded through a certain Ezeli, whose position would have enabled him to secure their safe conveyance, but his sudden death had rendered this impossible. My correspondent therefore desired me to suggest some means of transmission, adding that desire to see Western lands and to learn their languages and arts, as well as anxiety to escape from the continual persecutions of the Mull\u00e1s (who had lately, without cause or pretext, slain six of his co-religionists at Isfah\u00e1n and burned their bodies), rendered him very willing to bring the MSS. to England himself, if I approved of this plan, and if he could obtain money for the journey.\n\nTo this letter I replied in the manner directed. After thanking my correspondent for all the trouble he had taken, I explained to him the great expense and difficulty of the scheme he proposed, and suggested that the books\n\n---\n\n1 My correspondent did not mention the name of this person, but I have no doubt in my own mind as to who is meant.\n2 The persecution of Si-dih is alluded to. See my Traveller's Narrative, vol. ii., pp. 406-410.\nshould, when opportunity offered, be conveyed to Cyprus and placed in the hands of \u015eubh-i-Ezel, who could afterwards, if he pleased, transmit the originals or copies of the originals to me through Captain Young. In any case it appeared to me right and proper that they should first be placed in his hands.\n\nOn September 19th, 1890, I received another letter in the same hand, bearing the Constantinople post-mark, but written, apparently, from Famagusta, whither my mysterious correspondent had again journeyed. In this letter he stated that he had, according to my advice, abandoned the idea of coming to England, and had safely brought the following six volumes with him to Cyprus and handed them over to \u015eubh-i-Ezel: (1) The Names of All Things, 2 vols.; (2) The Commentary on the S\u016bratu'l-Ba\u1e33ara, 1 vol.; (3) The Commentary on the S\u016bratu'l-Kawthar, 1 vol.; (4) The Commentary on the S\u016bratu'l-'A\u1e63r, 1 vol.; (5) The Commentary on the S\u016bra-i-Y\u016bsuf or A\u1e25sanu'l-Ki\u1e63\u0101\u1e63, 1 vol.\n\nHaving thus explained how this and the following volumes were conveyed to Cyprus, whence most of them have since been sent to me, I return to the present MS., the Commentary on the S\u016bratu'l-Ba\u1e33ara. That it was one of the B\u00e1b's earlier works appears from a passage in the T\u0101rikh-i-Jad\u012bd, of which the substance will be found at pp. 902\u2013903 of my second paper on the B\u00e1b\u00eds in the J.R.A.S. for 1889. This passage contains the account given by Mull\u00e1 \u1e24useyn of Bushraweyh of his conversion to M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Abdu'l-Wahh\u00e1b of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, who narrated it to H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, from whose book it is copied by the author of the T\u0101rikh-i-Jad\u012bd. It is too long to quote or translate in extenso, and I must therefore confine myself to citing that portion of it which bears directly on the Commentary in question.\n\n\u0628\u0650\u0633\u0652 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u062a\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0637\u0627\u0642\u200c\u0647\u0647 \u0686\u0646\u062f \u062c\u0644\u062f \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0646\u0638\u0631\u0645 \u0631\u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0645\n\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0645 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0631\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0642\u0631\u0647. \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0645\nAfter a while\u201d [says Mull\u00e1 \u1e24useyn of Bushraweyh]\n\n\u201cI observed several volumes lying in a recess. I picked up one of them, and found it to be a Commentary on the S\u016bratu\u2019l-Ba\u1e33ara. After reading a little I perceived it to be a commentary of singular merit, and demanded in astonishment who the author might be. \u201cA mere youthful beginner,\u201d answered he, \u201cwho nevertheless lays claim to a high degree of knowledge and greatness.\u201d I again asked who and where the writer was. \u201cThou seest him,\u201d he replied; but I did not at the time apprehend his meaning, and continued to read on till I came to a passage where it was written, \u201cthe explanation of the inmost of the inmost.\u201d This appeared to me to be an error, and I remarked, \u201cHere it should be \u2018the inmost,\u2019 and they have written \u2018the inmost of the inmost.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat can I say?\u201d he answered, \u201cthe author of the Commentary lays claim to even more than this of greatness, glory, and knowledge. Consider the passage attentively.\u201d I did so, and said, \u201cIt is quite correct. But I am wearied. Do you read and I will listen.\u201d He\nread for a time, and then, as men are wont, I said, \"It is enough. Do not trouble yourself further.\"\n\nIt is this work, then, hitherto unknown in the West, that the present MS. represents. The MS. reached me, together with another (the Commentary on the S\u016bratu'l-'\u0100\u1e63r) to be described immediately, on December 8th, 1890. With them came a letter from \u015euhb-i-Ezel, dated November 25th, wherein he wrote as follows:\n\n\"The pilgrim of whom you wot also arrived about the same time\" [as Captain Young, whose absence on leave from Cyprus had prevented \u015euhb-i-Ezel from writing for a considerable period]. \"The letter which you wrote being conveyed to him, he abandoned his idea [of proceeding to England in person], and returned to his own place. The books which have been signified, six volumes, are ready, but owing to lack of opportunity they have not yet been completely copied. Now, by means of His Excellency the Governor [i.e. Captain Young] (may God Almighty guard him!), two volumes of them, one of which is the Commentary on the verses of the S\u016bra-i-Ba\u1e33ara, and the other the Commentary on 'Wa'l '\u0100\u1e63r,' are forwarded to you. The remainder, namely three other volumes, the Commentary on the Ka'athar and two volumes of the Names of All Things, will, if it please God, be forwarded by\ndegrees. The Commentary on the S\u016bra-i-Yusuf is also ready, whenever the time to send it may come.\u201d\n\nThe description of this MS. is as follows: Ff. 110 (ff. 1a\u20132a, and 110b\u2013110b blank), 19 \u00d7 11\u00b75 centimetres, 19 lines to the page.

X.\u2014Catalogue of the Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, and Turkish MSS. in the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThis Catalogue has been compiled chiefly from the following ones which are still in the Library:\n\n(1) A Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Hindustani Languages, preserved in the Libraries of the Royal Asiatic Society, and the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland. MS. By William H. Morley, 1838.\n\n(2) A Descriptive Catalogue of the Historical Manuscripts in the Arabic and Persian Languages, preserved in the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. By W. H. Morley, Printed by order of the Council, 1854.\n\n(3) A Rough Additional Catalogue of the Oriental Manuscripts belonging to the R.A.S. (such as are not entered in Morley's work). By Guy Le Strange, 1881.\n\nA fuller description of many of the MSS. will be found in some one of these Catalogues which are here indicated as (1) M. Ms. Cat. (2) M. P. Cat. and (3) Le S. Cat. respectively.\n\nThe order of arrangement, transliteration, titles of works and names, are in accordance with those used in the British Museum Catalogues. Arabic MSS. not included in the above mentioned Catalogues have been referred for description when necessary to Mr. H. C. Kay, and the Persian and Hindustani to Mr. E. G. Browne. Mr. E. J. W. Gibb has examined and described all the Turkish, and the Catalogue of them is made from his notes.\n\nOliver Codrington,\n18th January, 1892. Hon.

Arbuthnot, M.R.A.S.\n\nA short notice of this most industrious and intelligent Orientalist has already appeared in the obituary notices of the Journal of January, 1892. But as my deceased friend had devoted the whole of his life to the cultivation and propagation of Oriental knowledge and Oriental literature, it was considered desirable to place on record a more detailed account of his varied labours in this particular field of thought and culture.\n\nOf Mr. Rehatsek's early life very little is known. It is said that his father was a Forest Inspector on the estate of Princess Odescalchi, in Hungary, and that he was born on one of the estates at Illack on the 3rd July, 1819. He was educated at Buda-Pesth, studied at the University there, and took the degree of Master of Civil Engineering. Leaving Hungary at the end of 1842, he spent a few months in Paris, then four years in the United States of America, and in 1847 sailed to India from New Orleans via Liverpool and the Cape of Good Hope. Arriving in Bombay on the 5th of December, 1847, he settled down in India, and remained in that country for the rest of his life, dying in Bombay on Friday, the 11th of December, 1891, aged 72.\n\nI have some idea that on Mr. Rehatsek's first arrival he was employed in the Public Works Department, in which, however, he did not remain long. He then continued his studies of Oriental languages and literature, and sometimes accompanied Dr. Bhau Daji, the well-known Bombay scholar and antiquary, in his travels of research over various parts of India. Later on, being a competent mathematician and a distinguished Latin scholar, he was\nemployed as Professor of Mathematics and of Latin in the Wilson College, Bombay, which office he held till 1871.\n\nBeing acquainted with some twelve languages, he also taught private pupils, and gave lessons in Latin, Persian, Arabic, and French. He further translated a number of Persian and Arabic works, read many papers before learned Societies, and wrote many articles for Indian Reviews and Journals generally, the details of which will be given presently.\n\nFor twelve years up to 1881 Mr. Rehatsek was Examiner at the Bombay University in Latin, Persian, and Arabic, and for one year in French also, but such was his independence that he gave up these duties as soon as the application system was introduced. In 1873 he was made a Fellow of the said University and was twice the Wilson Philological Lecturer there on the Hebrew and Semitic languages. In 1874 he was elected an honorary member of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in recognition of his Oriental learning, and also became an honorary member of some learned European and American Societies interested in Oriental research. All these honours were unsought for, and as a general rule, it may be said, that he never asked for anything during his whole career.\n\nMr. Rehatsek was unmarried, and a man of regular habits, living the life of an ascetic and recluse. He was his own master and his own servant, for servant he kept none, thereby showing the truth of the Sanskrit saying, \"Ascetics are their own servants.\" He abstained from wine and spirits altogether, and tried also to do without animal food, but he found, as he told me himself, that this weakened him so much that he was obliged to revert to it, though he took it very sparingly. His usual food consisted of bread, milk, tea, coffee, rice, and plantains. At the door of his house there was a box into which the baker put a loaf of bread every morning, and the milkman filled with milk a jug that was placed there. His other necessities he purchased himself in the bazaar, and he prepared all his own food, using a spirit lamp to boil the water for\nhis tea and coffee, as he told me that it was more economical than a fire. Doing without servants, he said, was a great source of peace, comfort, and repose, and he certainly adopted Schopenhauer's ideas that the two great principles in life were to live, if possible, without pain and without ennui.\n\nThe only real property that Mr. Rehatsek possessed was a small house situated in Khetwady, Bombay, and which he had purchased. His furniture was of the poorest kind, and so very scanty that one wondered how it was sufficient for his wants. His library consisted of Arabic, Persian, English, German, Latin, and French works, and with these he worked all day, going out every morning and evening for a walk, and latterly I believe on a tricycle, to the sea-side. His manuscripts and translations were all written in a very small, but very legible, hand, and he had several cases full of them.\n\nMost of the above has been taken from an obituary notice of Mr. Rehatsek which appeared [13th December, 1891] in \"Native Opinion,\" an anglo-vernacular bi-weekly journal published in Bombay, and to which the deceased had been a constant contributor since 1871. So devoted was he to his work that on Wednesday, the 9th of December, while on his death-bed, he had prepared his usual article. When the editor of the paper called upon him, the poor old man, too feeble to speak, pointed to his desk, where lay, just completed, the last contribution that came from his pen.\n\nFrom his latest letters to me it was evident that his health was failing, and that he had not been well for some time. In his last illness he was attended by Dr. Kunte, Dr. Deshmookh, and Dr. John de Cunha. It culminated in cystitis, and he died on Friday morning, the 11th of December, 1891, at about 6.30 a.m. attended upon by his friends, all of whom were either natives of India or Portuguese. Having expressed an earnest desire to be cremated according to the Hindu fashion, the ceremony was performed the same evening. His body, covered with\ngarlands of flowers, and accompanied by his friends, was carried to the sea-shore, and placed there on the usual pile of wood, was soon converted into ashes. It is said that this was the first European ever cremated in Bombay, or perhaps, indeed, in India.\n\nThough Mr. Rehatsek had reduced the necessaries of life to a minimum, it was from his habits and tastes that he did so, and not from actual necessity. The Duke of Wellington used to say that habit was not only second nature, but ten times nature; well, Mr. Rehatsek was so accustomed to his style of living that he preferred it to any other, and it grew upon him, like every so-called virtue, or so-called vice, grows upon other people. Anyhow he seems to have saved some thirty thousand rupees, which he left for the education of the poor boys in the primary schools of Bombay, without any distinction of caste, colour, or creed. The interest of this sum [the principal being invested in Government securities] is to be awarded in money prizes to the most deserving pupils of these schools. His house is either to be sold and the proceeds added to the above fund, or to be lent for scholastic purposes free of charge, as his executors may decide. His books, manuscripts, and translations he bequeathed to the Native General Library, Bombay.\n\nIt now remains to place on record the literary work of Mr. Rehatsek during the many years he spent in India. As this is somewhat scattered, I have collected, as far as I have been able to do so, the names of the works that he translated, and of the articles that he wrote, and the subjoined list, though long, is not devoid of interest.\n\n(1) His contributions to the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society between 1874 and 1882 are as follows, twenty-six in all:\n\nVol. X.\n\nTwelve Sab\u00e6an Inscriptions.\nExplanations and Facsimiles of eight Arabic Talismanic Medicine cups.\nFacsimiles of Muhammadan coins.\nThe Evil Eye, Amulets, Recipes, Exorcisation, etc.\n\nVol. XI.\nThe subjugation of Persia by the Moslems and the extinction of the Sasanian dynasty.\nThe labours of the Arab astronomers and their instruments, with the description of an astrolabe in the Mulla Firuz Library, Bombay.\n\nVol. XII.\nSome beliefs and usages among the Pre-islamitic Arabs, with notes on their Polytheism, Judaism, and Christianity, and the Mythic period of their history.\nContact of the Jews with the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians, from the division of the Hebrew Monarchy into two kingdoms till the entrance of Alexander the Great into Jerusalem, and a view of Jewish Civilization.\nThe B\u00e1w and Gaobarah Sephabuds along the Southern Caspian Shores.\n\nVol. XIII.\nChristianity in the Persian dominions from its beginning till the fall of the Sasanian dynasty.\nChristianity among the Mongols till their expulsion from China in 1368, comprising the Eastern Grand Kh\u0101ns or Emperors with the Western or Persian Kh\u0101ns.\nBrief notice of two Arabic MSS. on the history of Yemen.\n\nVol. XIV.\nA Punja of yellow brass in the Museum of the B.B.R.A.S. drawn and described.\nEarly Moslem accounts of the Hindu religions.\nA few analogies in the Thousand and One Nights and in Latin authors.\nSome parallel proverbs in English, Arabic, and Persian.\nThe use of wine among the ancient Arabs.\nOn the Arabic alphabet and early writings [with a table of alphabets].\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nMagic.\nNotes on some old arms and instruments of war chiefly among the Arabs.\nThe history of the Wahhabis in Arabia and in India.\nThe doctrines of Metempsychosis and Incarnation among nine heretic Muhammadan sects.\n\nVol. XV.\nPicture and description of Borak.\nThe Alexander myth of the Persians.\nSpecimens of Pre-Islamitic Arabic poetry selected and translated from the Hamasah.\nEmporia, chiefly ports of Arab and Indian international commerce before the Christian era.\n\n(2) His contributions to The Calcutta Review between 1879 and 1891 consisted of twenty-one articles as follows:\n\nVol. 68.\nOriental humour illustrated by Anecdotes.\n\nVol. 70.\nGastronomical anecdotes of the earlier Khalifs.\nOriental Folk Lore.

This account of Bombay and of Surat in 1764, by the father of the historian Niebuhr, was translated and printed in the above Journal of 1880 in five parts.\n\nThe Begums of Bhop\u0101l, also in five parts, in the Journal of 1881.\n\nThe Diamond Fields of India, embracing five groups, viz., Cuddapah, Nandial, Ellore, Sambhulpur, and Pama, translated from Ritter's Erdkunde von Asien, and published in the Journal of 1882.\n\n(6) An article by Mr. Rehatsek on the subject of Oriental Armour, with a plate illustrating it; his original design, having been very faithfully reproduced in chromo-lithography, was published in The Journal of the German Oriental Society in 1882.\n(7) Mr. Rehatsek's translations from the Arabic of the Book of the King's Son and the Ascetic, with a short preface by Professor T. W. Rhys Davids, was published in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in January, 1890. About this translation Mr. Rehatsek wrote to me on the 4th June, 1889, as follows:\n\n\"The text which I have translated from the Arabic is unique, there being [as far as is known] no other MS. of it in existence, except the one given by Dr. Blau to the German Oriental Society, and printed by Dr. Hommel. The original source being undoubtedly Sanskrit or P\u0101li, I thought I was doing a service to those who might, by their knowledge of these two languages and their literature, be able to trace the true source and determine the real age of the composition of the Book of the King's Son and the Ascetic.\n\n\"It requires an extensive knowledge of Sanskrit and P\u0101li literature to enter into this subject properly, and I, not possessing it, have been able to make only very small foot-notes, although even these may be of some use. By making a full translation of this precious Arabic text, which it would be a great pity to mutilate or abridge in any way [as cutting off the opportunity of comparison with Sanskrit or P\u0101li works], I have drawn the attention of, and given the best text to, Sanskrit and P\u0101li scholars for investigating this subject here in India, and for pointing out many more relations between Buddhism and Christianity than I was able to do myself.\"\n\n(8) Mr. Rehatsek sent the following papers to His Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway, at the time of the eighth Oriental Congress held at Stockholm in 1889.\n\n1. Indian Fables in Moslem Literature.\n2. The Women of the Shahnamah.\n3. Seven interesting episodes from the conquest of Syria, the events narrated beginning A.D. 634\u201335. Translated from the Arabic of the Futuh-ush-sh\u016bm by Al-Wakidi.\n4. The Indian Mahdi and his successors. Translated from a unique but reliable and faultless Persian MS.\n\n5. Processional cross taken at Magdala from the cathedral by the British Troops in 1868; this is a drawing with translations of the inscriptions.\n\n6. A photograph taken from a large silver dish representing the adventures of the whole life of the God Rama [a deified hero] in compartments in concentric circles.\n\n(9) On the 28th of August, 1891, Mr. Rehateek wrote \"Having been asked for a paper to be read in Dr. Leitner's Congress of Orientalists in the beginning of September, I sent a MS., 'The Pre-Islamic History of Yemen and Hirah till the time of Muhammad.' It does not appear to have been read at the Congress.\n\n(10) For the Kama Shastra Society Mr. Rehateek prepared unexpurgated translations of J\u0101mi\u2019s Beh\u0101rist\u0101n or Abode of Spring, and of Sa\u2019di\u2019s Gulist\u0101n or Rose Garden. These were printed for private subscribers only in 1887 and 1888 respectively.\n\n(11) For the Oriental Translation Fund New Series he translated the following works:\n\n- The Negarist\u0101n or Picture Gallery by Muin-uddin Jawini, A.D. 1334.\n- Biography of our Lord Muhammad, the Apostle of Allah, according to the tradition of Ibn Hish\u0101m, obtained from Ibn Isr\u0101k.\n- The whole of the first two Parts of Mirkhond\u2019s \u201cRauzat-us-safa.\u201d\n\nOf these the first Part of Mirkhond\u2019s General History has been printed and published in two volumes in 1891 and 1892. The second part will fill three volumes, which will, it is hoped, be brought out in 1893 and 1894.\n\n(12) For the use of the Hakluyt Society Mr. Rehateek translated from the Italian from the voyages of Pietro\ndella Valle his letters from India, the first of which is dated Surat, 23rd March, 1623. These are, I believe, still with the above Society, and will probably form part of a volume containing the whole of the journeys of that versatile and talented traveller.\n\n(13) The following translations were also made by Mr. Rehatsek at various times. Those marked by an asterisk have been printed.\n\n*From the Persian.*\n\n*Amusing Stories.*\n*Fortune and Misfortune.*\nBoth of these are extracts from the Shamsah-va-Quhquhah, a Persian story book of 557 large quarto pages, written by Mirza Berkhord\u0101r Turkm\u0101n. They were printed in Bombay in 1870 and 1871.\n\nHospitality, or Etiquette of Eating and Drinking.\nA Tract on the Observances of Women and the Harem.\nA short Manuscript on \"Physiognomies,\" described in the Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the Mulla Firuz Library, p. 199, No. 48.\nThe Tutin\u0101mah, or Parrot Book, by Kadiri.\n\n*From the Arabic.*\n\nTwenty-four Anecdotes, Stories, and Fables picked out and translated from the Naphut ul Yaman [breeze or breath of Yemen].\nThirty-five Stories from the Merzuban-namah.\nSix Stories from the celebrated Arabic work Al-Mustatraf, or the Gleaner or Collector.\nSome Stories from the Sihr-ul-ooyoon, or Magic of the Eyes.\nSome Extracts from the Siraj-ul-mul\u00fck, or Lamp of Kings, a well-known work composed A.D. 1126.\nA Translation of a portion of the Arabic work \"Tuhfat-ikhvan ussafa,\" under the title of \"The discussion between Man and Animal before the King of the Jinna.\" This\ncelebrated work, written in the eighth century of our era by the society called \"The Brethren of Purity\" of Bosrah, is well known, and a curious notice of it was given in Vol. XVII. of the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society by A.

Possibly the term Mah\u0101vanasa\u015biya, which occurs repeatedly in the Amr\u0101vat\u012b inscr. as an epithet of teachers, may refer to a Buddhist school. There are also Buddhist schools mentioned on the Vardak vase (see Dowson's article) and on Dr. Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l's Lion-Pillar, at least, according to my readings, but you will have perhaps Bh.'s article on the latter. In the inscrs. of the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C., i.e. in those at Sanchi and Barhut, about 400 Nos., no schools are mentioned, whence I infer that the schools had no great importance. I send you my article on the Sanchi inscrs., which will appear in the\n\n\u00b9 These are either the same as, or closely allied to, the Kassapik\u0101.\u2014Rh. D.\nEp. Indica, vol. ii.

B\u00fcHLER.\n\nKIMBUM (LUSAR),\n1st March, 1892.\n\nMy Dear Rhys Davids,\u2014Having been detained in this part of Kan-mu for a few weeks, waiting to complete my preparations for my journey westward, I availed myself of the opportunity to visit the Salar, a Turkish people living on the Yellow River, S.E. of here some eighty miles.\n\nRobert Shaw published some years ago in the J.R.A.S. some interesting notes about this people (he had met a couple of Salar in Kashgar, if I remember rightly). Prjevalsky mentions them, but confounds them with the Tibetans. Potanin passed through their villages, but I do not know what he learnt, as nothing of his work has been published (as far as I am aware).\n\nThe Salar traditions (their Ahars say they have no written records) state that in the third year Ming Hung-wu, three or four men, driven from Samarkand, (sic) arrived at the Yellow River, and founded the present Salar head village of K\u00e4tzu-kun. They had been driven from their country by internal discords. They were rapidly followed by others of their countrymen, and soon the eight kun (or thousands, for the Chinese chin has that meaning) were founded, and these Turkish settlements were henceforth known in this part of China as Salar pa-kun. The villages the people now occupy are probably 75 to 100 in number, and the population is estimated at 8,000 families at the lowest.\n\nIn the forty-sixth year Ch\u2018ien-lung they rebelled under a Ahar called Ma Ming-ching. A narrative of this rebellion is found in Wei Yuan\u2019s Sheng wu chi.\nFor the last month I have been in daily intercourse with Salars, as a number of them had come to this place. I send you a short vocabulary, and have a much longer one, but have not now time to copy it. I have read it over to any number of the people, men, women, and children, and believe the phonetic transcription represents fairly well their pronunciation.\n\nThe Salar have in their language a number of words borrowed from Chinese, Mangol, and Tibetan. Some of these borrowed words are worth noting. It seems strange that they have no name for a mare, a stallion, or a gelding, but use the Chinese terms. The word for \"language\" they have borrowed from Tibetan; thus they say Mohul K\u00e4-ch\u00e1, \"the Chinese language.\" So likewise their term for \"flint and steel,\" ch\u00e1k-mah is Tibetan. From the Mongols they have borrowed the word aih\u00e1, \"wooden bowl,\" shinaha, \"spoon,\" and from the Chinese a large number of terms of various classes.\n\nI have taken a number of photographs of the Salar, both men and women, but as I have not developed them, I cannot send them to you now.\n\nIn my transcription of Salar words the accents only mark the emphasized syllables, those on which stress was laid.\n\nI was rather surprised to find among the Tibetans (Fan-Tz\u00fc) living in the mountains along the Yellow River a large number of B\u00f6nbo. They have on the very summit of a mountain some forty miles west of Hs\u00fcn hua T'ing, a lamasery (Sachung gamba), with some 100 or 200 lamas, and many more live with their wives and families in the little mountain villages. I stopped over-night in the house of one at Sst\u00fc-k\u00e9. He was very communicative, showed me his books, etc., but could tell me little about his creed. The B\u00f6nbo wear red gowns, and all their hair, but plait into it a huge tress of yek hair which is afterwards wound round the head. At the Shachung gamba they print books, and it would be well if some one visited the place, as they might have books of interest, although the two I have read of\ntheir were a jumble of lamaist works and of undoubtedly recent date.\n\nTrusting that I may be able to see you when I get out of this part of the world (probably sometime in the autumn of this year).\u2014I remain, ever sincerely yours,\n\nW.

Rockhill.\n\n| Salar. | Salar. |\n|--------|--------|\n| One    | Pir    |\n| Two    | Isk\u00e9   |\n| Three  | Usk    |\n| Four   | T\u00fce    |\n| Five   | Pesh   |\n| Six    | Alch\u00e9  |\n| Seven  | Y\u00e9t\u00e9   |\n| Eight  | Sek\u00e9se |\n| Nine   | Tokos  |\n| Ten    | Un     |\n| Eleven | Un-pir |\n| Twelve | Un-isk\u00e9|\n| Thirteen | Un-ush |\n| Twenty | Ig\u00e9rmi |\n| Thirty | Clush  |\n| Forty  | K\u00e9ren  |\n| Fifty  | Ell\u00e9   |\n| Sixty  | Hamish |\n| Seventy| Y\u00e9mush |\n| Eighty | Siks\u00e4n |\n| Ninety | Toksan |\n| Hundred| Pirens |\n| Thousand| Pir-ming |\n| Myriad | Pir-sanza |\n| Ten myriad | Un sanza |\n| Year   | Il     |\n| This year | Pil\u00e9 |\n| Next year | Ech\u00e9 sagon |\n\n1st month | Pir-indye |\n2nd month | Ik-indy\u00e9 |\n3rd month | Ush-indy\u00e9 |\n4th month | T\u00fc\u00e9tindy\u00e9 |\nTo-day    | Pugun    |\nTo-morrow | \u00c9tt      |\nDay after tomorrow | Pasagon |\nSpring    | Loy\u00e9     |\nSummer    | Y\u00e9       |\nAutumn    | Nobody knew a name for this season.

BIMBOHANA.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Childers offers no etymology for P\u0101li bimbohana 'pillow' or 'bolster.' Hemacandra (De\u00e7t. vi. 98), cites bimbavanaya\u2014uochir\u00e7aka. The Jaina-pr\u0101krit equivalent is bibboyana 'ganduka' (Spec der N\u0101y\u0101dharmmakha, f. 22.)\n\nThe former part of the compound 'bimb' = Skt. bimba, offers no difficulty; but it is not, at first sight, easy to see what is the corresponding Sanskrit term to ohana. Bearing in mind such Pr\u0101krit forms as parih\u0101na = Skt. parish\u0101na (see H. D. vi. 4), we can have no objection to identify ohana with *odh\u0101na=Skt. upadh\u0101na (Cf. Skt. upasakta with Pkt. osatta for change of upa to o through uva, ua).\n\nSo P\u0101li bimbohana =*bimbodhana = bimbopadh\u0101na; while Pr\u0101krit bibboyana=bimbovana=*bimbovahana=*bimbovadhana =bimbopadh\u0101na.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nRichard Morris.\n\n4. A NEW VARIETY OF THE SOUTHERN MAURYA ALPHABET.\n\nVienna, May 1, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014Prof. B\u00fchler addressed the following letter to the Academy of the 28th May, 1892:\u2014\n\nDuring some excavations which Mr. Rea, Archaeological Surveyor to the Madras Government, lately undertook in the already despoiled St\u016bpa of Bhattiprolu in the Kistna District, he has had the good fortune to discover some relic\ncaskets,\\(^1\\) which bear nine votive inscriptions. Impressions of the latter were sent to me by Dr. Burgess; and, after a prolonged study, I have succeeded in making out their contents, and have arrived at the conclusion that these documents are written in a new variety of the Southern Maurya or L\u0101\u1e6d alphabet, the characteristics of which may be briefly stated as follows.\n\n(1) Twenty-three letters of the Bh\u0101ttiprolu inscriptions\u2014viz., the initial vowels, \\(a\\), \\(\u0101\\), \\(u\\), \\(o\\), and the consonants \\(k\\), \\(kh\\), \\(chh\\), \\(\u00f1\\), \\(t\\), \\(th\\), \\(n\\), \\(t\\), \\(dh\\), \\(n\\), \\(p\\), \\(ph\\), \\(b\\), \\(y\\), \\(r\\), \\(v\\), \\(s\\) and \\(h\\)\u2014agree exactly with those ordinarily used in the Edicts of A\u015boka. The letter \\(g\\) has both the ordinary angular Maurya and the rare one with the rounded top, which occurs a few times in A\u015boka inscriptions\u2014e.g. in magesu (Pillar Edict vii. 2, 2)\u2014but is used invariably in the later inscriptions. The unaspirated palatal tenuis \\(ch\\) has a tail, the vertical stroke being continued beneath the semicircle. The unaspirated lingual media, \\(d\\), shows strokes slanting somewhat more strongly than in the abnormal \\(da\\) in amb\u0101vadik\u0101 (Queen\u2019s Edict, Allah\u0101b\u0101d, i. 3). The corresponding dental \\(d\\) exactly resembles the Maurya letter, but is turned round; the opening of the curve facing towards the right, as in the Devan\u0101gar\u012b \\(da\\).\n\n(2) Five letters are entirely abnormal: \\((a)\\) \\(Gh\\) is expressed by the sign for \\(g\\), with a small curve attached to the right side, which denotes the aspiration, the letter being formed according to the same principle as the Maurya \\(chha\\) from \\(cha\\), \\(dha\\) from \\(da\\), and \\(pha\\) from \\(pa\\). It occurs only in personal names\u2014e.g. Satugho, i.e. Satrughna, Vaghar\u0101, i.e. Vy\u0101ghrap\u0101d. \\((b)\\) \\(J\\) has the angular form, which occasionally\u2014e.g. Girn\u0101r Rock Edicts ix. 1, in the word r\u0101j\u0101\u2014is used by A\u015boka\u2019s scribes, and regularly in all later inscriptions, without the central horizontal bar. It therefore consists of a vertical stroke, with horizontal bars at the upper and lower ends. It occurs repeatedly in the words majusa or majusam, in Sanskrit ma\u00f1jush\u0101, a box or casket. \\((c)\\) \\(M\\) is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Described by Dr. J. Burgess in the Academy of last week (p. 497).\nturned topsy-turvy, the circle standing above, and the two strokes, forming an open angle, below. It occurs in the last-mentioned word, and in well-known names like M\u0101ha, i.e. Magha, Samano, i.e. Sramana. (d) L differs from the Maurya sign by the omission of the small horizontal bar to the left of the curve, and by the addition of a long slanting line, attached at an acute angle to the right of the vertical stroke. It thus somewhat resembles the Greek Lambda of the ancient Papyri. It occurs only in names\u2014e.g. Odalo, Kelo, i.e. Kaila, Pigalo, i.e. Pingala. (e) The lingual sibilant sh is a development of the form in the K\u0101lei version of A\u015boka's Rock Edicts. The whole letter has been turned round, and the upper curve has been converted into a cross-bar. It thus looks exactly like the k\u1e63 of the later inscriptions. It occurs in tekh\u0101m, the Pali genitive of the pronoun tad, in the termination of the genitive singular of vowel-stems\u2014e.g. in Kurasha, from Kuro, Sivasha from Sivo\u2014in the word shamugo, i.e. samudga, a small box, and in names like Samanaddaho, i.e. Sramanaddha.\n\n3. There is further the lingual l, which does not occur in A\u015boka's inscriptions. Its form resembles a Maurya pa, with a horizontal bar attached in the middle to the right of the vertical stroke; and it may be compared to the sha of the later inscriptions. It occurs in the word ph\u0101l\u012bgashamugam, i.e. sph\u0101tikasamudga, a casket made of crystal. The initial vowels, i, \u012b, u, e, and the consonants jh, dh, and \u015b do not occur. Bh may occur in two doubtful names, where I have noticed a sign resembling the Maurya bha, but turned the other way.\n\n4. The notation of the medial and final vowels presents two remarkable peculiarities: (a) The short a is invariably marked by the horizontal stroke, which denotes long \u0101 in the Maurya alphabet, except when an Anusv\u0101ra follows; and the position of this stroke is much the same as that of the \u0101 stroke in the Maurya alphabet, i.e., it is usually attached to the top of the consonant, but to the middle of the vertical n and of j. Hence the ja of the Bhattiprolu alphabet is exactly like the angular form of the letter in\nA\u015boka's Edicts. The omission of the stroke before an Anusv\u0101ra is probably due to the fact that the native lists of m\u0101trik\u0101s, or radical letters, invariably note the Anusv\u0101ra by am. Hence the Anusv\u0101ra came to be considered as equivalent to this syllable. (b) The long \u0101 is marked by a horizontal stroke and a short vertical one hanging down from its end. In other respects, the notation of the medial and final vowels agrees mainly with that used in A\u015boka's inscriptions. The o is, however, more commonly expressed by a bar, projecting to the right and to the left of the top of the consonants than by two separate strokes. The former notation occurs in A\u015boka's inscriptions, sometimes, e.g. in nigoh\u0101ni (Pillar Edict vii. 2. 2), but rarely. In the syllables ni and n\u012b, the vowel is attached to the middle of the vertical stroke, e.g. in K\u0101nttho.\n\nTo judge from the general appearance of the letters, the Bhattiprolu inscriptions are probably only a few decades later than A\u015boka's Edicts. If one places the Edicts on one side, and the N\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101\u1e6d, Hathigumpha, and Bharhut Torana inscriptions, which all belong to the middle of the second century B.C., on the other side of the Bhattiprolu inscriptions, one can only come to the conclusion that the latter hold an intermediate position between the two sets, but are much more closely allied to the documents of the third century B.C. than to those of the second. On this evidence, which, as every epigraphist knows, may mislead under certain conditions, but which, though not absolutely safe, is for the present alone available, the Bhattiprolu inscriptions cannot be placed later than 200 B.C., and may even be a little older. If this estimate is correct, their characters prove (what, indeed, is also made probable by facts connected with A\u015boka's Edicts) that during the third century B.C. several well-marked varieties of the Southern Maurya alphabet existed. For they contain a perfectly worked out system, which cannot have sprung up in a short time, but must have had a long history.\n\nThe importance of this result lies herein, that it removes one of the favourite arguments of those scholars who believe\nthe introduction of writing into India to have taken place during the rule of the Maurya dynasty, or shortly before its beginning. It has been stated repeatedly that one of the facts, proving the A\u015boka Edicts to belong to the first attempts of the Hindus in the art of writing, is the absence of local varieties among the letters of versions incised at places between which lie distances of more than a thousand miles. This argument is based, as I have pointed out more than once, on imperfect observation; and it may be met also by the obvious objection, that A\u015boka's Edicts were all issued from the same office, and that the importance naturally attributed to the writing of the royal clerks at P\u0101\u1e6daliputra might be expected to influence the copyists in the provinces, and to induce them to imitate as closely as possible the shape of the letters used at headquarters. Nevertheless, if the Bhattiprolu inscriptions now show a system of writing which in some respects is radically different, and which may be reasonably supposed to be coeval with that in A\u015boka's Edicts, they furnish a very great help to those who, like myself, believe the art of writing to have been practised in India for centuries before the accession of Chandragupta to the throne of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra.\n\nThis is, so far as I can judge at present, the chief value of the new alphabet. I do not think that it teaches us much regarding the early history of the Southern Maurya characters, and the manner in which they were derived from their Semitic prototypes. There is only one form among the anomalous letters which, it seems to me, is in all probability more ancient than the corresponding Maurya character. This is the m, whose shape comes so close to the full form of the Kharoshth\u012b (vulgo Bactrian Pali) ma\u2014which consists of a semi-circle with two short strokes, forming a right angle, attached to its lower left side\u2014that I am inclined to assume the evidently allied Southern ma to have consisted originally of a semicircle or circle with two strokes below. Hence the Maurya form would be the later one, obtained by turning the older one topsy-turvy. The case of gh, as stated above, which has been formed by the extension of the\nprinciple underlying the formation of chha, dha and pha, is more doubtful. For, the Southern Maurya gha looks, prima facie, like an independent character. Still, there is just a possibility that it may have been derived from an inverted ga with a round top, to which a curve was attached in order to denote the aspirations. And in favour of this view it may be urged that the Kharoshtri gha has been derived by a similar contrivance from ga. Regarding the new l, I do not dare to offer any opinion.\n\nBut the remaining anomalies appear to be developments of the corresponding Maurya forms. The j with two horizontal bars is to all appearance the offspring of the angular form with three bars; and the central bar has only been removed in the syllables ju, j\u00fc, je, and so forth, in order to obtain a convenient means of marking the short a of ja. For, the Southern Maurya jha, which has been derived from an imperfectly formed or perhaps a very ancient ja, by the addition of a short upward stroke denoting the aspiration, shows that the central bar is an essential part of the letter. Again, the lingual sibilant sh is in all probability a cursive form, derived from the clumsy character which is used in the K\u00e2lsi version of the Rock Edicts. Finally, the most curious feature of this alphabet, the marking of the short a, seems to me, because it complicates matters, less ancient than the omission of this vowel. The Semitic original, from which the Southern Maurya alphabet was derived, had in all probability no signs for medial and final vowels. Hence, if we find in India one system of notation with five or, including the diphthongs e and o, with seven vowel signs and another with eight, the natural conclusion is that the second is the later one. This is all that I can offer at present in explanation of the origin of the very remarkable anomalies of the Bhattiprolu alphabet. I must, however, call attention to one other curious point: the fact that, so far as I know, not one of these anomalies has left any trace in the later Indian alphabets, the signs of which are all derived from the Southern Maurya characters.\n\nThe language of the Bhattiprolu inscriptions is a Prakrit\ndialect, closely allied to the literary Pali. As regards their contents, the two longest, Nos. 3 and 8, which are incised on the circular lids or topstones of two relic caskets (Mr. Rea's second and third caskets), consists of strings of names. No. 3 enumerates the members of a gothi, i.e., gothi, probably a committee or Pa\u00f1ch, and No. 8 certain nayam\u0101, i.e., nayam\u0101, members of a guild.

XII.\u2014The Sabiri and the Saroguri. By Sir Henry H. Howorth, Esq., K.C.I.E., M.P., M.R.A.S.\n\nSome time ago I ventured to print a monograph on the Avars in the Journal of the Asiatic Society. I should now like to continue the story by analyzing the difficult ethnological and historical problems involved in discriminating the races which occupied the Steppes of South-eastern Europe before the arrival of the Avars. The question has exercised many inquirers, nor does it seem to me that a final and definite answer can be reached, but we can at all events secure a tentative solution of the problem.\n\nPriscus, in a famous passage, has preserved for us an account of the immediate effect of the Avar domination, which I think deserves our close attention. He tells us how about the time when the Vandal Genseric was devastating Italy, i.e. about 456, the Avars fell upon the Sabiri, who expelled the Saroguri, the Urogi, and the Onoguri from their country, who thereupon sent envoys to the Roman Emperor (Priscus, Excerpta, Bonn edition, p. 158). Inasmuch as the Sabiri are next found in the Steppes east of the Don and about the Kuban, the meaning of this seems to be that the Sabiri were then driven across the Volga and pushed the other tribes before them, so that\nthey came in contact with the frontiers of the Empire on the lower Danube.\n\nI first propose to limit myself to the Sabiri, and to collect what is known about them. From the statement of Priscus it would seem to follow that the Sabiri were the neighbours of the Avars in Asia. They are called \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 or \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 by Priscus and Saviri by Jornandes.\n\nThe name has a singular resemblance to Sibir, which gave its name to Siberia, and it is at all events curious to find that the early Arab geographers speak of Siberia as Ibir-Sibir or Abir-Sibir, and of the town of Sibir which gave its name to a small Khanate first conquered by the Cossack Jermak and afterwards to the Russian province of Siberia, which was situated not far from Tobolsk. When they were driven forward, the Sabiri apparently, as I have said, settled in the Kuban Steppes north of the Caspian, where we afterwards find them, and, as Vivien St.-Martin says, they probably then became the dominant tribe in the country afterwards occupied by the Nognis, giving their name to a league of the various Hunnic races of Sarmatia (V. St.-Martin, Geog An. vol. ii. 23). Procopius describes these wide plains as specially suited for the breeding of horses. There, he tells us, dwell nearly all the tribes called Huns. Their settlements extending to the Maeotis, whence they were wont to break through the Caspian gates and to invade the Persian and Roman borders. About the year 508 we are told that the fortress commanding the pass, i.e. probably the pass of Dariel, was in the hands of a Hun named Ambazuk, who was doubtless a Sabirian Hun. He was on friendly terms with the Emperor Anastasius, and having grown very old, offered to surrender it to him for a consideration. The offer was not accepted by the Emperor, who was a prudent person, and realized the difficulty of maintaining a Roman garrison there, and he accordingly thanked him and promised to consider the matter. Ambazuk shortly afterwards died, whereupon his sons were driven away and the place was occupied by the Persian ruler Kavad.\nAnastasius was praised for his prudence on this occasion; but, as Lebeau says, a different opinion prevailed when, a few years later, the Huns broke through the pass and carried ravage into the empire. This famous raid was made in the year 516. Unfortunately I can only refer at second-hand to the Armenian authors who refer to it, namely, as quoted by St.-Martin and by Avdall. Vahan, the Mamikonian, who had ruled over Armenia as deputy of the Persian sovereign and as independent prince for thirty years, died in the year 510. His brother Vard, who had been constable, was appointed in his place with the approval of Kavad, the Persian King, but he only ruled for three years when he was removed in consequence of the complaints made against him, and a Persian named Burzan or Burghan was appointed marzban of Armenia. It was at this time that the Sabiri forcing the Caspian gates invaded Armenia. Burzan fled, abandoning the country to their fury, and the Prince of the Grusinians named Mijej alone opposed them. He attacked a body of them who had invaded the mountains of the district of Sasun (Sasun is situated in the Kurdish mountains east of the Tigris, and formed part of the Armenian province of Aghdsnik). He completely routed and drove them away, and marching his forces with those of some other Armenian chiefs, pursued the invaders and drove them out of Armenia. When this was reported to Kavad, he deposed Burzan and nominated Mijej in his place, and we are told how inter alia he restored the towns and villages which the invaders had destroyed (Lebeau, vol. vii. pp. 435-436; Avdall, pp. 329-330). The invaders are called simply Huns by the Armenian historians, but we know from the Byzantine writers that they were Sabiri. On leaving Armenia, we gather from the latter that they invaded Cappadocia, Galatia, and Pontus, which they laid waste. They penetrated as far as Euchaites and the frontiers of Lycaonia (Anastasius passim). It was on this occasion that Euphemius, patriarch of Constantinople, who had been deposed and exiled to Euchaites, fled from this place.\nand took refuge at Ancyra. His successor, who had also been exiled to the same town, retired for similar reasons to Gangra, where he soon after died (Lebeau, vol. vii. p. 433). Anastasius, in the MS. followed by Stritter, calls these Huns Samen, but in the corresponding passage of Cedrenus they are called Sabiri.\n\nThe next time we read of the Sabiri is in the year 522. They are not called Sabiri in the notice, but only Huns; but inasmuch as they were apparently living in the Kuban, it can hardly have been any other tribe. We read that war having broken out again between the Persians and Romans, the Emperor Justin sent envoys and gifts to Ziligdes (otherwise called Zilgbior or Ziagbiris and Zilgibio), who engaged by an oath to help the Romans; but Justin speedily discovered that he had made the same offer to the Persian ruler Kavad, whom he had furnished with a contingent of 20,000 men. Justin now informed Kavad of the double treachery of the Hunnic chief, adding, \"Brothers as we are, had we not better remain at peace than become the toys of these dogs?\" Having summoned the Hunnic leader, and discovered that Justin's account was true, Kavad put him to death, and afterwards slaughtered his men, who, unaware of their leader's death, were sleeping comfortably in their tents (Theophanes, etc.; Stritter, vol. i. pp. 602-3; Lebeau, vol. viii. pp. 28 and 29).\n\nSeven years later, namely, in 528, we read that Justinian, being at war with the Persians, won over by presents and royal ornaments Boarex, called Boa by Malala, and Boazer in the Historia Miscella of Paul the Deacon. She was the widow of Balakh, or Malakh, chief of the Hunnic Sabiri. She marched with 100,000 of her men against two Hunnic chiefs who \"lived in the interior parts,\" i.e. doubtless further north, and who were probably the leaders of the Utigurs and the Kotrigurs. Their names are given as Styrax and Gloues by some authors, while by Malala they are named Turagx and Glom. They had it seems been invited to his assistance by the Persian king Kavad, and were marching 20,000 strong. She fought with them, captured one of their kings,\nnamely, Styrax, who was sent in chains to Constantinople; the other king was killed (Stritter, op. cit. vol. i. pp. 577 and 578; Lebeau, vol. viii. pp. 104\u20135).\n\nThe struggle between the Romans and Persians still continued, and in 530 there was fought a memorable battle near the town of Dara. The Romans were commanded by Belisarius and the Persians by Peroses, or Firoz: on the Roman side was a body of 600 Huns commanded by Sunika and Augan. Procopius calls these Huns, Massagetae. In another place Procopius speaks of two other Hunnic chiefs also commanding 600 horsemen, namely Simas and Askhan (see Procopius De Bell Pers. lib. i. ch. 13). These Huns fought very bravely, and, in fact, restored the battle after it had been lost; Sunika, as we read, fighting his way right up to and cutting down the Persian standard bearer. Meanwhile Kavad, the Persian ruler, had sent another army into Armenia, consisting chiefly of Perso-Armenians and Sunites, i.e. Suans, to whom we are told were joined 3000 Sabiri (Procopius, i. 15). This army was twice badly defeated. Thus did the two great empires, by their strife, afford their barbarous allies ample room for the display of their treachery and disinterestedness in allying themselves with either side. Well might the Persian king complain of the continued aggressiveness of the Romans\u2014their violation of treaties, and their building a threatening fortress at Dara, and attempting to erect another at Murdoneh. He complained further that he had continuously to employ two armies, one to oppose the Romans, and the other to oppose the northern barbarians, and declared that if the Romans wanted peace, they must contribute towards guarding the Caspian gates or they must demolish Dara (Procopius, i. 16). The struggle between the two empires consequently continued, and the ill success of his arms seems to have brought on an attack of paralysis, from which Kavad, the Persian ruler, died in the year 531. His death led to the raising of the siege of Martyropolis by the Persians and to fresh negotiations for peace. Meanwhile the Sabiri, who had promised to send aid to the Persians in their attack\nupon Malatiya, or Martyropolis, arrived there and, not finding their Persian friends, they proceeded to invade and lay waste the second Cilicia and Comagene (Malala, part ii. p. 213). According to the Syriac chronicle of Edessa, published by Assemani, they ravaged the environs of Aleppo (see Ass. vol. i. p. 415). They advanced as far as four leagues from Antioch, and as they retired, laden with spoils, Dorotheus met them in the Armenian mountains, surprised them in several ambuscades, and recovered a large part of their booty (Malala, loc. cit. Lebeau, viii. 175).\n\nPeace was made between the Romans and Persians in the year 531, which was finally ratified in the year 533, and thus did the long strife which had lasted for thirty years come to an end. We are told that Dagaris, who had been captured in Armenia, was now exchanged. He defeated the Huns in several encounters and drove them out of the provinces which they had laid waste (Procopius, i. ch. 22). The peace between the two empires offered no opportunities for the Sabiri to renew their incursions for some years, and it is not till the year 550 that we again read of them, and again read of them also as taking part in the struggles between the Romans and the Persians. Gabazcs, king of Lazica, having been threatened by the Persians, sought succour from Justinian, who sent him a body of 8000 men, with whom he proceeded to lay siege to Petra, with him were also a body of Alans and Sabirs who for the sum of 300 golden marks had undertaken not only to defend Lazica, but to lay waste Iberia (Procopius, de Bell Pers. l. ii. ch. 29). The Huns named by Procopius as fighting on the side of Chosroes in this campaign were probably White Huns. Jornandes, who wrote his history of the Goths as Mommsen argues in the year 551 and before the invasion of the Avars, has the following not very definite notice of the Sabiri:\u2014\"Hunni quasi fortissimorum gentium fecundissimus cespes bifariam populorum rabiem pullularunt. Nam alii Altziagiri alii Saviri nuncupantur, qui tamen sedes habent divisas,\" (Geticia, ch. v. ed. Mommsen, page 63).\nIn the same year when this is supposed to have been written, viz. in 551, the Sabiri are again named as taking part in the struggle between the Romans and the Persians. We read that the Romans then had in their service many Sabiri who were a Hunnic race, and were ruled by several chieftains, some of whom were in alliance with the Romans, and others with the Persians, and were kept in a good humour by continual largess. Justinian having need of their services at this time sent them some money, but the person who took it was not able to convey it to the Caucasus since the Persians intercepted the route. When he reached the camp of the Romans, who were besieging Petra, he sent word to the Sabiri to go and meet him. They accordingly sent three of their chiefs with some soldiers, who, seeing that the Romans were despairing of breaking down the walls of the place, invented or constructed a new battering engine of a kind hitherto unknown both to Romans and Persians. This was not built of upright longitudinal and transverse beams, but of wicker work covered with hides, and in the midst they suspended a beam with an iron head and it was so light that it did not need to be dragged along, but the forty men who were underneath could carry it about with them. Several of these machines were built by the Sabiri. Petra was duly taken (Procopius de Bell. Goth. iv. 11). Meanwhile the Roman commander failed to follow up his victory, and we read how the Persians, under Mermeroes, marched to attack them and laid siege to Archeopolis. In this war we are told that a body of 12,000 Sabirians were among the auxiliary troops in the service of the Persians (id. 13). Having heard of the new machines which the Sabiri had made for the Romans, Mermeroes in turn had similar ones made by the Sabiri in his service (id. 14). The Persians were foiled however in their attack, and the result was a truce of five years coupled with the payment of a considerable sum by the Romans. Chosroes, the Persian king, was not very punctilious, however, in his observance of treaties. He employed the money he received from the\nRomans to pay a considerable contingent of Sabiri, whom he sent with some Huns, doubtless White Huns are meant, and elephants to the help of Mermeroee. The result of the treachery was not, however, successful. Many of his men were cut in pieces, and inter alios, the chief of the Sabiri was killed. A struggle took place for the body of the Barbarian (id. 17).\n\nThe next we read of the Sabiri is in the year 554, when two thousand of them commanded by Balmakh, Kutilzis, and Ildiger are named as in the service of the Romans. They were posted near Arch\u00e6opolis when Nakoragan, the successor of Mermeroee as commander of the Persians, ordered 3000 Dilemites, or people of Dilem, to attack them. They set out intending to surprise the Sabiri at night, but were misled by a Colchian, who had offered to guide them, and who meanwhile escaped and gave warning to the Sabiri. They accordingly arose and planted themselves in ambush. While the Dilemites entered their camp and used their lances and swords to probe the beds where their enemies were supposed to be, the latter broke out of their ambush and put 800 to the sword, and captured many of them. The commander of Arch\u00e6opolis, at daybreak, having heard a noise and learnt its cause, joined his forces to those of the Sabiri and continued the slaughter so that barely 1000 of the Dilemites escaped (Agathias, iii. 8). The Romans having rewarded the Sabiri for their services, we are told that they now joined the Persians. Agathias says of the Sabiri that they were numerous and powerful, accustomed to war and pillage, and were pleased to enter the service of foreigners when there was hope of pillage, and they thus changed sides frequently, fighting now for the Romans and now for the Persians. In the war of the year 555, 500 of them were encamped some distance from the main army and kept guard badly and lived with but lax discipline. Maxentius and Theodore despatched 300 cavalry, who, we are told, easily jumped the low wall enclosing the Sabirian camp and speedily killed all the Sabiri save forty, who escaped to a wood. We are\ntold they were under the impression that the force opposed to them was much larger than it proved to be (id. iv. 3).\n\nWe have now reached the time when the domination of the Sabiri, north of the Caucasus, gave place to that of the Avars or Psued-Avars whose invasion occurred in the year 558.\n\nThe Sabiri, among other tribes, succumbed to this invasion. A portion of them, doubtless, marched westwards as we shall presently see under the banners of the Avars, while another portion were apparently driven into Albania, i.e. Arran, and we, in fact, read in the pages of Menander how in the year 575, when the Romans and the Persians were again at war, the Roman frontier commanders made incursions into Albania and took hostages from the Sabiri and other tribes of the Caucasus, whom they sent to Constantinople. The Albanians (or perhaps Alans as Menander's text here has it) and the Sabiri seeing their children in the hands of the Romans determined to submit to the empire. These envoys were well received by Justin. Abeir, the chief of these tribes, whose name is apparently a form of Avar, was absent from home at this time, and on his return, without regard to the hostages, he persuaded the greater part of the Sabiri and the Albanians to again submit to the Persian King (Menander, loc. cit. 119; Lebeau, x. 131, etc.). When the Roman commanders learnt of this defection, they made a fresh invasion of Albania, and to make use of them in future they transported them with their families beyond the Kur, and therefore within the Roman frontier. Justin was dissatisfied with the conduct of his generals on this occasion, and insisted that the Sabiri and Albanians should be put to the sword (id. 158 and 159). In the year 579 Menander speaks of a body of Persian troops being placed on guard against the Saracens, the Sabiri, etc. (id. Bonn, ed. 408). This is the last notice I can find of the Sabiri in the Caucasus.\n\nIt is not impossible that their blood is still present among the so-called Avars and the Khuasak of these mountains.\n\nFrom the notices already given, it will be seen that the\nSabiri dominated the steppes north of the Caucasus for about a century, from the year 456 to 556. They did not, apparently, occupy the country to the north of the Maeotis, or on the lower Don, but were, so far as the notices can be followed and trusted, limited to the Kuban steppes and the country to the north. A town Suvar in the later district of Great Bulgaria is probably an evidence of them.\n\nLet us now revert again to the famous passage which was quoted at the beginning of the paper from Priscus. As we have seen, he tells us that the Sabiri pushed forward the Saroguri, the Urogi, and the Onoguri. Who then were these tribes? *Eo nomine* they then occur for the first time.\n\nUrogi is probably a corruption of Uguri, and we have in these three names the particle Ugor present, which suggests some commentary. With other inquirers I was once disposed to treat the word as a form of Uhry or Ughri, by which the Ugrian or Hunnic tribes of the Urals, especially the Voguls, are known, but this view I no longer hold; the whole history of these tribes points to their having been a nomadic race of horsemen, and not mere fisherfolk and hunters, and I now believe they were of Turkish and not Ugrian blood. The name Ugor I believe now is to be correlated rather with the Turkish name Uighur than with Uhry, and in Saroguri this name is qualified with the particles Sar, meaning Yellow or White; Saroguri thus means White Uighurs. Onoguri apparently means the Nine Uighurs.\n\nIn regard to the Urogi, or Uguri, I do not propose to say anything more. The name occurs nowhere else in this isolated and unqualified form, and its mention on this occasion is probably due to some misapprehension, since it is apparently merely the generic name, of which the other two are specific forms. In regard to the Onoguri, I propose to deal with them on another occasion, when we may possibly try and elucidate the beginnings of Bulgarian history. At present we will limit ourselves to the Saroguri. As I have said, I take their name to be simply Sar Uighurs,\nor White Uighurs, and it is a curious fact that the Kalmuks still call the Turks, who nomadize in the steppes of Northern Tibet, Sar Uighurs.\n\nWe find the Saroguri mentioned more than once with the Akatziri; thus Priscus tells us that all who could not resist the Avars fled, thus the Saroguri, in search of new homes, came to the Hunnic Akatziri, and, having fought many battles with them, sent an embassy to the Romans.\n\nIn 469 we find the Saroguri making an invasion of Persia in conjunction with the Akatziri.\n\nIn my view the Saroguri and Akatziri were merely sections of one race which had got separated. Akatziri means White Katziri or White Khazars. In a paper which I read before the St. Petersburg Congress of Orientalists I collected the evidence which makes it almost certain that the Khazars were Turks, and as I believe Uighurian Turks. Akatziri and Saroguri are therefore virtually synonyms. The Akatziri had occupied the district of the lower Volga for some time before the incursion of the Avars, and are numbered among the subjects of Attila. The Saroguri were in my view another section of the same race who lived beyond the Volga and dominated the so-called Kirghiz Steppes. When the Avars began their aggressions the Saroguri were displaced. One section came westwards across the Volga, and the other in my view invaded Persia and its borders, and are otherwise known as White Huns. White Uighurs, White Khazars, and White Huns being really synonyms. I hope to devote another paper to the White Huns.\n\nAs we have seen, the Saroguri, on being driven from their homes, came westwards, and sent envoys to the Romans. They settled, as I believe, in the Steppes of Southern Russia, displacing or incorporating their previous inhabitants, and from this time we find these steppes occupied by two tribes, whose names prove them to have been Uighurs by race, and who I take to have been merely two sections into which the Saroguri divided themselves. They were known as Kutrigure and Utigura.\nI will first say a few words about the forms in which these names occur. Procopius, who first mentions them, speaks of the Kuturgurs, Agathias calls them Kotriguroi, and Menander Koutriguroi (ed. Paris, 310) and Kutriguroi (id. 344, 385\u20136). Theophylactus calls them Kotzageroi, Theophanes Kotragi, and Anastasius Koutrages. Jornandes has the form Cutziagiri.\n\nZeuss argues that the \\( t \\) in the form used by Theophylactus and Jornandes is the aspirate of the lingual as \\( ds=dh \\) in German names; thus Scandza for Scandia. Under any circumstances the Kuturgur of Procopius has a redundant \\( r \\), and whether the first particle of the name be Kotri or Kutzi it seems clear that the second part of it is \\( igur \\), or \\( ogor \\), corresponding to the second part in the form Utigur.\n\nTurning to the latter tribe, Procopius, as we have seen, calls them Uturgurs, Agathias calls them Utiguroi, Menander Utiguroi, with variants in different MSS. of Uiguri (op. cit. 284), and Uittiguroi (id. 399).\n\nAgathias professes to complete the work of Procopius, whom he quotes in his preface. In regard to the Huns he tells us they were distinguished by the names Kotrigurs and Utigurs, Ultizurs and Burgundi, etc., derived, he says probably, from the places where they lived (loc. cit. v. ch. 3). In regard to the two latter tribes he says he knew nothing of them, whether they still existed or lived in some distant country. He tells us they were famous by their military exploits until the time of Leo. His remark would make it appear that he drew his information about them from some other source, and I am disposed to think that Burgundi is a mistake for Bulgar, caused by some confusion in his mind between the two tribes respectively so named, the Burgundians having been of course a Teutonic tribe. The Ultizuri or Ultirizuri, as he elsewhere writes it, seem to me to be an alteration of the Altziageri of Jornandes, whom we have already discussed. As named by Agathias, the Burgundi and Ultizuri, I therefore take to be of absolutely no value; they are mere book-names more or less corrupted, and, like Procopius,\nhe knows only the Utigurs and Kutrigurs in the Russian steppes.\n\nProcopius is the first writer who mentions these tribes. He says the Zekkhi (probably Circassians are meant) occupied the coast of the Euxine. Beyond them was the district of the Sagid\u00e6 (probably an Alanic tribe). Beyond them were various Hunnic peoples. The district beyond was called Eulysia. The people dwelling there and about the M\u00e6otis and as far as the Tanais (i.e. the Don) were those who were anciently called Cimmerii, but were then called Uturguri. Further north dwelt the very numerous race of the Antae (Procopius, Bell. Goth. iv. 1, 2 and 3). In another place he tells us how the Huns in this district once obeyed a King who had two sons, Uturgur and Kuturgur, who, on their father's death divided the kingdom, and their people took their names from them, some calling themselves Uturgurs and others Kuturgurs. They dwelt in the Steppes and had no intercourse with other peoples, nor did they cross the marshes, nor indeed did they think they could be crossed. It so happened, to follow the legend, that some youths who were hunting a stag followed it into the water, and as it went across they also reached the other side. On their return they reported they had found a ford. Their countrymen thereupon crossed over in force and attacked the Goths who lived there; killed many of them and dispersed the rest (id. v. 1 and 2). These Goths were the so-called Gothi Tetraxit\u00e6, who afterwards formed a small community in the mountainous parts of the south of the Crimea. It would seem that Procopius refers to the time when they occupied the whole of the peninsula and were dispossessed of a portion of it by the Huns.\n\nTheir country now became the prey of the Huns, and we are told the Kuturgurs settled with their wives and children, and says Procopius there they live now, and although they have at various times received presents from the Emperor they nevertheless do not desist from crossing the Ister and attacking his provinces, being\nthus at the same time allies and enemies of the Romans (id. v. 3).\n\nAt this time we must understand that the lower Don or the Sea of Azof roughly separated the two tribes we are describing, the Kuturgurs or Kutrigurs lived in the Steppes to west, including the northern part of Krim and the Nogai Steppes, while the Uturgurs or Utigurs lived east and south-east of the Don and along the eastern borders of the Sea of Azof as far as the Kuban, being bounded on the south by the Sabiri. It would seem that both tribes united in the invasion of the Crimea, but that only the Kutrigurs settled there, the Utigurs returning home again. As they were returning, a large number of Goths fully armed, who apparently occupied the peninsula of Phanagoria, prepared to resist, but thinking better of it the two tribes made peace and afterwards lived at amity. The Utigurs continued, says Procopius, to live in their ancestral home without molesting the Romans, since they were too far off to have the power of fighting them even if they had the will. Their neighbours were the Abasgoi (the modern Abkhazians) (id. iv. 3). They were probably the Huns with whom Opsites, the King of the Abasgians, took refuge when defeated by the Romans (id. ix. 3).\n\nThe Huns, says Procopius, possessed all the country from the Bosphorus as far as the town of Cherson. At the latter place were two towns, Cepi and Phanaguris, both of which had been captured recently and destroyed by the barbarians. All the country from Cherson to the mouth of the Danube, a distance of ten days' journey, was occupied by the barbarians. The barbarians of these notices perhaps were the Gepidae.\n\nAbout the year 550, when there was a truce between the Lombards and the Gepidae, who occupied Pannonia, the latter having determined to recommence hostilities, and being persuaded that the Romans would side with their enemies, sent an embassy to the Kutrigurs, who lived on this side of the Macotis (i.e. north-west of the Macotis and west of\nthe Don), to ask them to attack the Lombards. They accordingly sent a body of 12,000 men, commanded, according to Procopius, by Khinialkh, a leader of great repute in war. He is also called Zabergan (?\u2014Sabir Khan). Khinialkh was probably his name. He is described as a leader of great repute, and his army arrived while the truce was still in force and had twelve months to run, and the Gepid\u00e6, wanting to find their allies some work to occupy their time, persuaded them to cross the Danube and attack the Roman territory, which they ravaged far and wide (Procopius, Hist. Goth. ch. xviii.). What followed is described in greater detail by Agathias, who tells us the Danube was then frozen fast, and they passing it on the ice, and, crossing a wide stretch of country which was unpopulated, traversed Moesia and Scythia (i.e. the Dobruja) and entered Thrace. There Khinialkh or Zabergan divided his army into two bodies, one of which he sent to forage in Greece, where there were no garrisons, and sent the other into the Thracian Chersonese, which was well known for its fertility. The Chersonese was joined to the mainland by an isthmus, protected by a wall, and Zabergan fancied, if he could capture this, he would be master of the sea, and could secure ships with which to cross over into Asia (the transit being short), and that he could ruin Abydos. He accordingly despatched as many troops as he could spare towards the Isthmus, while he himself advanced with 7000 horses towards Constantinople, pillaged the towns and stripped the country of forage, ravaging far and wide, professing that his reason for the invasion was that his people, the Kutrigurs, had been treated differently to the Utigurs, whose chief had received many presents and honours from the Emperor (Agathias, book v. ch. 5). He presently withdrew, charged with an immense booty and an immense number of slaves, among whom were distinguished ladies, who were dragged along with great brutality. There were virgins who had devoted their life to piety, and whose chastity was sacrificed to the incontinence of the invaders, while several women who were enceinte, were similarly\ndragged along, without any means of covering their children from the weather.\n\nThe Huns passed the great walls and approached the forts, some of which had fallen into decay from neglect, and knocked down others with the same care that masons destroy old buildings. There were no guards, no war engines, not even, says Agathias, dogs to guard the flocks. The invaders encamped near the town of Melantiades, which was only 150 stadia distant from the capital. The citizens were panic-stricken with fright, and from the Emperor downwards people were seized with pusillanimous terror, which is described in graphic phrases by Agathias (id. ch. 6). Belisarius, the old hero, who had retired from active service, was recalled to lead the army\u2014an army of undisciplined weaklings. He addressed it in language of confidence, and a report of what he is supposed to have said is duly given by Agathias (id. ch. 7); and he seems to have inspired his men with some of his own spirit. Having heard from his spies that the enemy had detached 2000 men from their main body to attack the Romans, he accordingly posted 200 of his men, armed with shields and javelins, in ambush in a forest on two sides of a path along which the Huns had to advance, and planting his main body in front, he bade the peasants, etc., from the surrounding country follow the enemy, and make as great a noise as they could. His plans were well carried out. The Huns were thrown into confusion and pressed so much on each other that they could neither throw their lances nor extend the wings of their cavalry, and the small number of their opponents was disguised by the dust. The Huns, seeing themselves foiled, withdrew at a gallop. Four hundred of them were left on the ground. No Roman was killed; some only were wounded. Zabergan himself only escaped by the speed of his horse, and by the fact that the Roman cavalry was not strong enough to pursue. The Huns reached their camp in confusion, and, according to their custom, gashed their checks to show their grief. They abandoned their attack on Melantiades and withdrew some distance off (id. ch. 8).\nBelisarius, instead of pursuing, returned to Constantinople, apparently recalled by the jealousy of the Court. The Huns withdrew beyond the great walls, but finding they were not pursued, marched slowly. Meanwhile their other division attacked the Chersonese, and tried several times to storm the walls, but were vigorously met by the Romans, who were commanded by Germanus, the son of Dorotheus, who was young, vigorous, and a skilful soldier. The Huns, who had tried in vain to storm the defences of the Chersonese, now adopted other tactics. Agathias tells us how they collected large quantities of reeds with which they made hurdles, and from four of these they made boats to hold four men. The prows were pointed, so that they might be the more easily steered, and down each side were seats for the rowers. Of these they made 150, and launched them on the sea near the town of Enus. On these boats were altogether about 600 well-armed men. They stuffed straw into the holes when the reeds let water in, and began to row as well as they could in their fragile boats, and endeavoured to reach the turn of the wall, fancying their troubles would then be ended, since the rest of the Chersonese was only protected by the Hellespont. Germanus, when he heard of the very hazardous manoeuvre of the enemy, was highly delighted. He mounted a number of well-armed soldiers and sailors on some twenty galleys, and told them to lie in wait behind a promontory, where they would not be observed. When the Huns had rowed past the wall, and began to draw near the other side, the Roman soldiers, in their boats, came out from their hiding-place and attacked them, upset some of their frail rafts of reeds, and cut the fastenings of others, and they were all either drowned or put to the sword (id. ch. 9). The Romans having landed again determined to press home their advantage at once, and proceeded to attack the enemy. In this struggle Germanus was wounded, and, the Romans being outnumbered, withdrew again, but the Huns had had enough. The loss of their improvised fleet, and perhaps the firm front shown by the Romans,\ndispirited them, and they withdrew and went to rejoin Zabergan, who had also been defeated. The division which went towards Greece did nothing remarkable, and did not get beyond Thermopylae, which was protected by a Roman garrison, whence they also retired. Zabergan declared, however, that he would not withdraw from the country until he had received a large sum of money such as the Romans formerly paid the Utigurs, and he threatened to put all the prisoners to death unless it was paid. The Emperor thereupon sent a considerable sum with which to ransom the prisoners. The Huns sent them back again, among them was Sergius, son of Bacchus, who had been treated with great indignity. The Huns now withdrew homewards, plundering on the way. The blackmail they levied was naturally very distasteful to the Romans, who were angry that instead of being cut in pieces they should have secured so much plunder. Justinian, according to Agathias, had a deep plot however in all this, and what subsequently happened cleared him in his subjects' eyes from much blame in having thus bought off the invaders (id. ch. 10).\n\nHe wrote a letter to Sandelkh, Sandikh, or Sandel, the chief of the Utigurs, inciting them to attack the homes of the then absent rival tribe. Agathias gives us what he professes to be the letter which Justinian wrote to this chief on this occasion. In it he said that if he (Sandilk) had heard of what the Kutrigurs had been doing, he could but express astonishment at his perfidy, and at the imprudence which had tied him to such an ally. The only way in which he could escape from his ambiguous position was to prove his former ignorance by now exacting vengeance. It was not purely to plunder that the Kutrigurs had invaded the Roman borders, but also to show the world how worthless were their allies, and to prove how superior their forces were to those of the Utigurs. This is why they had overrun all Thrace and carried off the money which was promised to and in-\ntended for the Utigurs themselves, and the reason they had not been driven away and chastised was because the Romans wished to put their friendship to the test and also to test whether they were going to submit to being robbed of what was their own, namely, the presents they, the Romans, intended sending them. They had a special reason of their own, therefore, for vengeance, and ought to recover from the hands of the Kutrigurs the gift which was their due. If they were going to remain content with things as they were, they, the Romans, would in future pay the Kutrigurs what they had hitherto paid them, and abandon their alliance with the Utigurs, for their braver rivals. It would be more profitable and honourable to side with those who were victorious than with those who had been beaten. What followed is differently reported by the Byzantine writers.\n\nMenander says Justinian sent Sandilkh several embassies, and tried by every means to induce him to fight Zabergan. He promised him, *inter alia*, that if he would attack the Kutrigurs, he would pay him the annual pension which Zabergan had hitherto received. Sandilkh replied that it would neither be right nor decent that he should exterminate his compatriots. For, he said, not only do they speak the same tongue and have the same customs as ourselves, but they are our relatives, although they obey other leaders. Nevertheless, as it is Justinian who orders this, we will carry off their horses, so that they shall no longer be able to ride, and no longer therefore able to do the Romans any harm. (Menander, ed. Bonn, 345).\n\nAccording to Procopius the Roman envoy pointed out that these Kutrigurs (of whom he, Sandilkh, was so careful), although they annually received large sums from Byzantium, did not desist from attacking the Roman frontiers. Nor did they let the Utigurs share in this bounty, nor did they share in the booty which they made when assailing the Roman borders. Sandilkh was at length moved by the Roman entreaties and presents, and agreed that he would attack the Kutrigurs. Agathias\nsays that the biting message of the Romans stirred Sandilkh\u2019s pride, and he at once proceeded to attack the enemy (id. lib. v. ch. 6). Having been joined by 2000 Goths (i.e. Gothi Tetraxtae, who, we have seen, were their allies), they crossed the Don, and had a very serious struggle with the Kutrigurs (that is with those who had remained at home), and eventually defeated them, and caused a great massacre, and returned home with their wives and children as prisoners (Procopius, Bell. Goth. ch. xviii.). This internecine feud among the enemies of the Empire is made a subject of congratulation by Procopius, and he tells us that many Roman captives, whom the Kutrigurs had formerly made, who numbered many thousands, managed to escape and returned home again (id. xix.).\n\nMeanwhile Zabergan, as we have seen, with a body of 12,000 Kutrigurs, had crossed the Danube and was ravaging the country to the south. Justinian now sent Aratius to acquaint them of what had taken place in their own country, and to tempt them by a liberal largess to withdraw. They accordingly retired without doing any more harm, and without carrying off any captives, treating the inhabitants in fact, as the no doubt astonished historian tells us, as if they had been their friends, and it was agreed that if on their return they found it possible to remain, they were to do so; but if they found it impossible to settle down in their own country they were to return to Thrace, where the Emperor promised to find them quarters, and where they should undertake to keep out other barbarians (id. xix. 1 and 2).\n\nAgathias says the Kutrigurs were attacked by the Utigurs while returning from Thrace, and deprived of the plunder which they had made. Those who escaped went home to collect their forces, and thus the two tribes began a long struggle, during which the empire was more or less free from their attacks. The Kutrigurs, it would seem from his account, were seriously punished in the war, and those who remained lost their liberty and took the name of the conquerors. When the news reached Constantinople of these events,\nthe Emperor was highly praised for his prudent conduct (Agathias, lib. v. ch. 6).\n\nProcopius says that 2000 of the Kutrigurs who had been defeated by the Utigurs fled with their wives and children to Roman territory. They had among them a valiant chief named Simeon who had formerly served under Belisarius against the Vandals. These fugitives offered to serve in the Roman armies, and Justinian sent them into Thrace. This caused Sandilkh, the ruler of the Utigurs, to get into a great rage. He deemed it indecent that having driven the Kutrigurs from their lands to please the Romans, the latter should have given the latter settlements, and he sent his complaints by his envoys, to whom, says Procopius, he entrusted no letters, for the Huns had not the art of writing, and neither taught their children to read or write. These envoys reported his message to Justinian, and according to Procopius, it was in these words: \"I heard a parable, when a child, which I will report to you. The wolf can change its fur, but not its disposition. Nature will not let it do so. This is what I, Sandilkh, have learnt from old men who discriminate the ways of men by those of beasts. I also know the lessons which I have learnt from my country life. The shepherds take young dogs and bring them up carefully, and when grown up, the dogs are gentle to the shepherds who have cared for them. The intention of the shepherds is that these dogs shall guard their sheep and protect them from the wolves. This is a universal law, I take it, for nowhere do dogs eat sheep and wolves guard them. It is equally a law, I take it, in your kingdom where some things occur strange and contrary to the ways of other men. If I am mistaken in my remarks, point it out to my envoys, so that I may learn something in my old age. If my story is true, is it not shameful that you should give shelter to the Kutrigurs in your midst when you could not tolerate them quietly when living so far from their frontiers? They will soon prove if they have affection and zeal for your service. You will always have\nenemies since you treat them so kindly after they have been beaten, and you will have no friends to defend your territories and to protect them from pillage since they may expect to be worse treated than your foes. While we have to live in a sterile desert, the Kutrigurs enjoy superfluity. They have the luxury of baths, while their garments are embroidered with gold and silver. They have carried off to their country a vast quantity of Romans upon whom they practised all the cruelty which a barbarous and pitiless disposition could invent. While we have run dangers in order to rescue their victims from slavery, you have repaid us ill. We suffer all the inconveniences to which nature has condemned our land, while the Kutrigurs divide among them the lands of those whom we have delivered by our courage from the yoke they had imposed on them.\" Such was the message of the envoys whom Justinian endeavoured to appease with words and presents, and sent home again (id. xix.).\n\nA little later, the Lombard Ildigist, who had sought asylum at Constantinople, taking offence at not being treated with sufficient dignity, fled to Apros, in Thrace, where, being joined by some of his countrymen, he revolted. The Emperor ordered the different governors of Thrace and Illyria to oppose him. The first troops whom he encountered consisted of those Kutrigurs, to whom the Emperor had given a settlement in Thrace, but they were defeated and dispersed, and the rebels advanced upon Illyria (Procopius, De Bell Goth. xxvii. 2). In the fight between Narses and the Goth Totila, we are told that a contingent of Huns fought in the Roman ranks (id. xxxi.). These were probably Kutrigurs, and it is the last notice of them known to me. We now lose the guidance of Procopius, who died about this time.\n\nIn the year 557 a new horde of nomades, whose history I have elsewhere related, crossed the Volga, driven forward by the Turks, and we are told that on their approach the Sarselt, Onoguri (i.e. the Bulgarians), Sabiri, and other Hunnic tribes, were greatly disturbed, and gave them presents.\nI take it that the larger part of these Hunnic tribes were incorporated in the Avar armies, and marched westwards with them. Not only so, but it would seem that, like the Onogurs or Bulgars, some of the other Huns became the dominant caste among certain Slavic peoples.\n\nIn common with other writers, I cannot avoid identifying the Sabiri with the race or caste which gave its name to the Serbians. I have elsewhere in a monograph on the Croats shown how probable it is that they also were led by a Hunnic caste, and it is an interesting fact that one of the early Croat chiefs was called Kotrag, which brings him into close relationship with the Kutriguri.\n\nI hold the Sabiri, the Kutrigurs, and the Utigurs to have been very nearly related to one another, all of them having been Turks of the Uighur branch. Jornandes clearly treats the Sabiri and Kutrigurs as closely related. His words are: \"Hinc jam Hunni ... in bifariam populorum rabiem pullularunt. Nam alii Cutziagiri, alii Saviri nuncupantur,\" etc. One of the famous chiefs of the Kutrigurs who invaded the empire was named as we have seen Zabergan, which seems a corruption of Sabir Khan. In my view these tribes, before the Avar movement, occupied the old Khanate of Siberia, and the steppes East of the Volga, now the home of the small horde of the Kirghiz Kazaks, and this movement largely displaced and thrust them forward. When they crossed the Volga, they thrust a wedge in among the previous occupants of the Russian steppes, who consisted of the remains of the army of Attila. It is curious to note how potent a factor they became in the eyes of the Romans. As a proof of the considerable role played by the Huns at this time in Eastern eyes it may be mentioned that when the Byzantine faction of the Blues changed their dress, etc., they cut off all their hair in front, and allowed that behind to grow long, probably in tresses. \"They call this,\" says Procopius, \"the mode of the Huns.\" They began to wear much richer robes than their condition justified, the sleeves of\nwhich were wide above and narrow below, so that when they raised their arms at the theatre the people might fancy their height corresponded to the bulk of their garments. Their jackets, their buskins, and their socks were also in the fashion of the Huns (Procopius, Secret History, vii. 1).\nART. XIII.\u2014Catalogue and Description of 27 B\u00e1b\u00ed Manuscripts.

Many persons, gentle and simple, enjoyed the honour of meeting him, and propounded to him hard questions, to which they received full and satisfactory answers easy to understand, so that many accepted his doctrine. His Excellency [Min\u00fa\u010dihri Kh\u00e1n] the Mu\u2019tamadu\u2019d-Dawla also came to see him, and His Holiness [the B\u00e1b] returned the visit. The Im\u00e1m-Jum\u2018a had demanded of him, \u2018By what sign do you establish the truth of your claim?\u2019 \u2018By verses,\u2019 answered he, \u2018for without pause of the pen I can, in the space of three hours, write a thousand sentences on any subject that I please.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 objected the Im\u00e1m-Jum\u2018a, \u2018you may have considered the matter previously.\u2019 \u2018I will write,\u2019 replied he, \u2018on any subject you please.\u2019 \u2018Then,\u2019 said the Im\u00e1m-Jum\u2018a, \u2018write for me a Commentary on the S\u00fara beginning wa\u2019l-\u2018a\u1e63r,\u00b9 even as you wrote for \u00c1k\u00e1 Seyyid Yahy\u00e1 of D\u00e1r\u00e1b a Commentary on the S\u00faratu\u2019l-Kawthar.\u00b2 So His Holiness [the B\u00e1b] began to write, and in every three hours wrote a thousand sentences. Then the Im\u00e1m-Jum\u2018a was convinced that such power was from God, being beyond the capacity of man.\u201d\n\nAllusion is made to this request of the Im\u00e1m-Jum\u2018a\n\n\u00b9

Kurratu'l-'Ayn, who was originally of the Sheykh\u00ed sect (see T.N. vol. ii, p. 310, and p. 342, n. 1).\n2 Haji Seyyid Kazim of Recht and his predecessor Sheikh Ahmad of Ahs\u00e1 are of course alluded to.\n3 Here also seems to mean the B\u00e1b himself. Cf. p. 308 supra.\nThis MS. came into my hands under the same circumstances and at the same time as the last. The passage in the accompanying letter wherein reference is made to it has been already quoted (p. 643 supra). The letter itself is pasted into this MS. after the last leaf (f. 264), forming ff. \u03b1-\u03b2 additional.\n\nThe description of the MS. is as follows: Ff. 264 (ff. 1a-2a, 5b-6b, 192b, 219a, 225b-226b, 230a-232b, 240a-240b, 253b, 264a-264b, \u03b11 and \u03b22 blank), 20\u00b775 x 13 centimetres, 21 lines to the page. Written in a clear and compact naskh. Headings of chapters and marginal annotations in red.\n\n1 This passage is especially noteworthy. Cf. Traveller's Narratives, vol. i, pp. 3-4; vol. ii, pp. 3-4.\nBegins (on f. 2b):\n\nThis, like all the B\u00e1b\u2019s other later works, is divided into V\u00e1hid containing nineteen chapters apiece. Each chapter is devoted to one of the \u201cNames\u201d of God, these names being permuted and varied in the usual way (cf. T.N. ii, pp. 317\u2013319). Each name is further considered under four different aspects, so that in each chapter we find four subordinate sections, and only the latter half of the work (from V\u00e1hid viii, ch. 1 to V\u00e1hid xix, ch. 18) is contained in this volume, and of this several complete V\u00e1hids, including the twelfth, and many chapters are missing. This is so far to be regretted, in that it prevents me from definitely establishing the identity of this MS. with the MS. described by Dorn under the name of \u201cKorander Baby,\u201d at pp. 247\u20138 and 284\u2013292 of vol. viii of the Bulletin de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale de Sciences de St. P\u00e9tersbourg (1865). For Dorn gives only the first chapter of the twelfth V\u00e1hid, which, as I have already said, is not contained in this volume. I think, however, that anyone who will compare the specimen which he gives with the fragment I have given will agree that the two MSS. almost certainly represent the same work, especially as the \u201cName\u201d or \u0633\u06a9\u0627\u0646 is given in the index of the missing chapters as\n\n1 Ch. 19 appears to be missing, though included in the table of contents at the end.

\u015euhb-i-Ezel in July or August, 1891, appears to be the companion volume of the MS. last described, with which it corresponds in size, writing, and arrangement, though its name is given somewhat differently. It contains in an incomplete form V\u0101hid\u012bs ii\u2013vii inclusive, just as BBF. 9 contains V\u0101hid\u012bs viii\u2013xix. V\u0101hid i is missing, but a statement of its contents is prefixed to the index on f. 2a. The description of the MS. is as follows:\n\nFf. 338 (ff. 1a\u20131b, 81b, 88a\u201388b, 120a\u2013120b, 336a\u2013338b blank), 20\u00b775 \u00d7 13 centimetres, 21 lines to the page. Written in the same clear and compact naskh as the MS. last described.

Written in a good naskh. Title (as above), written in red, occupies l. 1 on f. 1b. An irregular system of punctuation with red dots prevails throughout the MS. In all other respects the facsimile forming vol. i. of my Traveller's Narrative, published by the Cambridge University Press in February of this year, accurately represents the original.\n\nTo what I have said concerning this work, its peculiarities, value, and importance, in the Introduction to vol. ii of my edition (which contains, besides the aforesaid Introduction, the translation and notes) I have to make one or two important additions. From the perusal of certain letters written by Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's son 'Abb\u00e1s Efend\u00ed, I was led to surmise that he might perhaps be the author of this history, the peculiar style of which appeared very similar to his. This conjecture, however, till recently lacked positive confirmatory evidence. But some few weeks ago I received a letter from a Persian B\u00e1bi of Jewish extraction\u2014a descendent of those Jews of Mash-had who, about half a century ago, were forcibly converted to Isl\u00e1m\u2014accompanied by a parcel containing (besides a small controversial treatise in manuscript, composed by M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ab\u00fa'l-Fa\u017cl of Gulp\u00e1yag\u00e1n, of which I shall have to speak presently) a lithographed text of this same Traveller's Narrative, published, as it would appear, in Bombay (for no printer's or publisher's name appears either on the\ntitle-page or at the end of the volume), on Rab\u00ed\u2018-uth-th\u00e1n\u00ed 26th, A.H. 1308 (Dec. 9th, A.D. 1890), that is to say more than a year previously to my edition. My correspondent, who at that time knew no more of my edition of the work than I knew of the Bombay edition, wrote concerning it as follows:\n\n\"\u067e\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u0627 \u06cc\u0632\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0627\u06a9 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0634\u062a\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u06a9 \u06af\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u0637\u0644\u0639 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0648 \u0647\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f \u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f \u06f2 \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0634\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0630\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0641\u062f\u0627\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u062d\u06cc \u0646\u06af\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0645\u062b\u06cc \u0637\u0628\u0639 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u062e\u0637\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u0637 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0628 \u0632\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0646\u0632\u062f \u062d\u06a9\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644 \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062f\u0644\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u062a\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u06af\u0644 \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u062c\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u062d\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0648 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0645\u0646\u0634\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0686\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u062f\u0631 \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0626\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u06cc \u0648 \u0637\u0644\u0648\u0639 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0631\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0633\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u0645\u0644 \u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0634\u0644\u0645 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0631 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0637\u0631\u0632 \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0644\u0641\u0627\u0641\u0647 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u0648\u062a \u0633\u0641\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0647\u0631 \u0648 \u0644\u0627\u06a9 \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0627 \u067e\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0645\u0645\u062b\u06cc \u0648 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0634\u06cc \u0631\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0633\u062f.\n\n\"After giving thanks to the One Pure God, who, from a handful of dust, caused the human essence to appear, and made it the source of knowledge and reason, representation is made as follows: I have forwarded as a consignment to your address, by registered post, by way of Bushire and Bombay, two volumes, wrapped in a covering of white cloth, and sealed with wax, which, please God, will arrive safely.

When I was engaged on the translation of the *Traveller's Narrative*, in which the greater part of this *Epistle* is cited, I was forced to consider what the work thus referred to might be. Not being able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, I wrote to Acre asking for information on this and several other subjects. In reply I received on Sept. 1st, 1890, a letter, dated August 20th, 1890, from Beh\u00e9's son M\u00edrz\u00e1 Badi'u'll\u00e1h, containing answers to my question. What refers to the *Hidden Book of Fatima* I translated in vol. ii of the *Traveller's Narrative*, p. 123, n. 1. I shall not repeat the translation here, but will give the original text of this portion of the letter.\nA passage in a subsequent letter (received on Oct. 26th, 1890) wherein apology is made for delay in sending the promised Book of Fatima has been already quoted at p. 666 supra.

(Cf. B. ii, p. 981; Coll. Sc. ii, p. 245, l. 4 from the bottom.)\n(4) All Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds followers are bound loyally to serve and support any King who extends his protection to their faith.\n(5) The followers of Beh\u00e1\u2019, in whatever land they dwell, must cheerfully and ungrudgingly submit to the laws and conform to the customs of that country.\n(6) Promise of the \u201cMost great Peace\u201d (Cf. Traveller\u2019s Narrative, vol. ii, p. xl.).\n(7) All are permitted, subject to the dictates of decency and good taste, to follow their own inclinations as to dress and the wearing of the hair.\n(8) The good works and devotions of Christian priests are recognised and will be accepted, but they must henceforth abandon their seclusion and \u201cengage in that which shall advantage them and whereby mankind shall be benefited.\u201d They are also permitted to marry.\n(9) Confession of sins to one's fellow-men and seeking absolution from them is not permitted. To God only should confession be made, and from him only should pardon be sought. A form of prayer suitable for such confession is given. (Cf. B. ii, p. 975, first paragraph.)\n\n(10) The B\u00e1b's command to destroy certain classes of books (e.g. books of logic, philosophy, and other sciences conducing, in his opinion, only to self-conceit and disputatiousness) and to \"renew\" all books after a certain period, is abrogated. (Cf. B. ii, p. 979, l. 21; p. 928, l. 10 et seq.)\n\n(11) The study of sciences and arts is commended and encouraged, but they should be such as conduce to the welfare of mankind.\n\n(12) All men must learn and practise some craft, trade, or profession. The diligent and conscientious practice of such craft, trade, or profession is in itself an act of worship. Mendicity and idleness are hateful to God. (Cf. B. ii, p. 975, first paragraph.)\n\n(13) The settlement of differences, the apportionment of alms, and the ordering of the affairs of the commonwealth generally, are entrusted to the \"House of Justice.\" (Cf. B. ii, p. 974.)\n\n(14) Visitations of the tombs of martyrs and pilgrimages to the shrines of saints are no longer to be regarded as obligatory. Nevertheless it is a pious work for rich men to leave money to the \"House of Justice\" to enable their poorer brethren to perform these pilgrimages.\n\n(15) Though a republic conduces most to the general welfare, it is not desired that Kings, who are the \"signs of God's Power,\" should cease to exist. \"If statesmen can combine these two things in this cycle, their reward with God shall be great.\"\nClass IV. MSS. obtained from Constantinople.\n\nBefore proceeding to describe these MSS. I must explain in what manner I became acquainted with Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, the learned Ezeli from whom I received them. On October 13th, 1890, I received from Constantinople a long letter in Persian, occupying two sheets of writing-paper, and dated Safar 22nd, A.H. 1308 (Oct. 7th, 1890), which letter proved to be from the aforesaid Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, with whom I had had no previous communication, and of whose very existence I had till that day been unaware. After apologising for writing to me without previous introduction or acquaintance, the writer explained how he had heard of me from Persia and Cyprus, and how he had learned that I had interested myself especially in the B\u00e1b\u00ed religion. In consequence of this, he said, he had written to me to warn me against certain pretenders to spiritual truth (by whom he meant the Beh\u00e1'\u00eds) who had brought discord and dissensions into the bosom of the new faith.

Until one has read this book he knows not what the philosophers wished to say, what was and is the object of all these sacred books [which have been revealed] since the beginning which hath no beginning, or what was the design and\npurpose of the Celestial Tongue in all its past utterances.\" The writer added that there was only one other copy of the book besides his own, and that it was in Persia, and was accessible to no one but the owner; that he would put the work in hand immediately; that I was, at my convenience, to remit him \u00a34, wherewith to pay the scribe; and that the MS. would be finished in two months and a half.\n\nOn Feb. 2nd, 1891, I received fifteen folios of the promised MS., together with a letter, explaining that the rest of the transcript had fallen into the hands of enemies from whom it had not been possible to recover it. The missing portion, Sheykh A\u2014\u2014 added, would be sent as soon as another copy could be made.\n\nIn a fourth letter, received on Feb. 27th, 1891, Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, after giving further particulars of the loss of the twelve confiscated folios, wrote concerning the *Hasht Bihisht* in somewhat greater detail as follows:\n\n\"Moreover this book (the *Hasht Bihisht*) is really two books. In the first volume [the author] has treated of the theoretical aspects of the philosophy of the Bey\u00e1n, its scientific proofs and rationale; while in the second [he discusses] the ordinances of the Law of the Bey\u00e1n, the circumstances of the Resurrection and the promised corporeal Paradise, and, in a summary manner, the events of the Day of Resurrection.\u00b9 Now the book copied for you is the second volume.\" If I like, continues Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, he will\n\n\u00b9 i.e. the circumstances of the B\u00e1b's 'manifestation' and the internecine strife which subsequently arose within the sect.\nhave a copy of the first volume also made for me, which, though it deals less directly and ostensibly with the B\u00e1b's doctrine, and, indeed, would not be recognized by the uninitiated reader as inspired thereby, will nevertheless help to render clear the true character of the new religion.\n\nNot to pursue further a long correspondence, I may state briefly that I subsequently received the whole of vol. i of the *Hasht Bihisht* (\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0647\u0654 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646) and the greater portion of vol. ii. The latter, however, is defective in the middle, and consists of portions of two different copies, the first twenty-two folios (consisting of four sheets, or sixteen pages, each) being written on yellow paper, and the last eight on white paper. How great may be the central hiatus I have no means of judging, but I hope soon to receive the missing portion.\n\nConcerning the real authorship of the work I addressed a direct enquiry to Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, to which he replies as follows:\n\n---\n\n\u0627\u0645\u0651\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0645\u0635\u0646\u0641 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u06af\u0631\u0686\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0632\u0626\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062d\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u06cc \u0622\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0633\u06cc\u0645\u200c\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u062a \u0648 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0645 \u0627\u0645\u0651\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0645\u06cc\u0646\u0645\u0627\u064a\u0645 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0633\u062a \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0632\u0631\u06af\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u062c\u06cc \u0633\u06cc\u062f \u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u062d\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0648 \u0627\u0635\u062d\u0627\u0628 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u06cc\u0646 \u0648 \u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0632\u0631\u06af\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0645 \u0634\u06cc\u062e \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u062a\u0627 \u0647\u0641\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u067e\u064a\u0634 \u0627\u0632\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0628\u0639\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0622\u0646 \u06a9\u0633\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0646\u0642\u0637\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0644 \u0633\u0628\u0639\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0622\u0648\u0631\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0644\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u062e\u0637\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u06a9\u0645 \u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0632\u0631\u06af\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0636\u0639\u064a\u0641 \u0648 \u0631\u0639\u0634\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0633\u062a \u067e\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0645\u0642\u062a\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0630\u0647 \u0622\u0646 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\nYou wished to know the name of the author of this book. Although particulars and personalities are abolished in the Bey\u00e1n (\u2014'They are naught but names which ye and your fathers have named'\u2014), still, since you have asked, I will tell you. The ideas contained in these two books [i.e. the two volumes of the Hasht Bihisht] represent the teachings and sayings of the illustrious H\u00e1j\u00ed Seyyid Jaw\u00e1d of Kerbel\u00e1, who was of the 'First Letters of the Living,' the earliest believers, and the 'Letters of the Bismill\u00e1h.' That illustrious personage, now departed, was a pilgrim after truth in these degrees from the time of the late Sheykh Ahmad of Ahs\u00e1 until seven years ago. And he is one whose words are adduced as proof in the Dala'il-i-Sab'a by His Holiness the Point of Revelation [i.e. the B\u00e1b], who, in the first Epistle which he addressed to him, wrote, \"Peace be upon you, O scion of the prophetic household!\" But, inasmuch as during his latter days the strength of that illustrious personage was much impaired and his hands trembled, he was unable to write, wherefore he dictated these words, and one of his disciples wrote them down, but in an illegible hand and on scattered leaves. In these days, having some leisure time in Constantinople, I and this person exerted ourselves to set in order these disordered leaves.

The transcriber of this MS., probably unfamiliar with the name, read the initial letter as \u067e instead of \u067e. This mistake is repeated elsewhere.\nEach chapter is further divided into a number of sections, the enumeration of which I am forced to omit in this place. The explanation of the Bey\u00e1n\u00edc terminology (ff. 237b-243a) is one of the most valuable portions of the book, for the meanings of many obscure expressions which occur constantly in the B\u00e1b\u00ed writings are here clearly and concisely defined.

portion, at least, of\nthe work was not composed by him.\n\n2 One sees from this that the office of one who seeks to reconcile the con-\nflicting claims of the two rival factions is a thankless one!\n\n3 The scribe has omitted to insert the name Mull\u00e1 Sheykhu 'Ali.\nThe above definitions and explanations are but a selection from the letter *alif*, which is followed by the other letters in their alphabetical order. I will only give one more, which confirms the opinion expressed by Baron Rosen (Coll. Sc. 1, MSS. Arabes, p. 187, n. 1), that the term *Kurratu'l-'Ayn* does not in the B\u00e1b's Commentary on the *Sitra-i-Yud\u00edf* denote the celebrated B\u00e1b\u00ed heroine who afterwards bore this title.\n\n*Kurratu'l-'Ayn* was a name of His Holiness the Point [i.e. the B\u00e1b] at the beginning of the 'Manifestation,' but subsequently Her Holiness the Pure [Jandb-i-T\u00e1hir\u00ed] of Kasv\u00edn became the manifestation of this name.\"\n\nIt is impossible here to do more than indicate, as I have striven to do, the extreme value and importance of this work.\n\n**BBC. 2.**\n\n*Hasht Bihisht. Vol. ii. Practical Philosophy of the Bey\u00e1n, etc.*\n\nThis MS. is, as I have already stated, imperfect, consisting of twenty-two folios (of ff. 8 each), written on yellow paper, separated by a hiatus of unknown extent from the concluding eight folios, which are written on white paper. It is therefore impossible for me to describe it fully, partly because the proper numeration of the leaves following the hiatus cannot be determined; partly because, when the supplementary folios of either the white or the yellow part are sent, I am to return or otherwise surrender up the other part, which, therefore, I cannot disfigure with numbers or other marks. The portion now in my possession consists of ff. 240 (thirty folios of ff. 8 each), ff. 1*-2* being blank.

This narrative, written partly in Persian and partly in Arabic, occupies five pages and one third, and contains the most violent and bitter denunciations of Beh\u00e1 and his followers. \"Praise be to God,\" he begins, \"who hath caused me to travel in all lands, and hath shewn me the firmly-buttressed palaces, and Iram of the columns, and the couches of Pharoah and Shaddad, and the tombs of Thamud and 'Ad, who rebelled in the land, and oppressed [God's] servants, and whose home shall be hell\u2014an ill resting-place!\u2014And blessing and peace be upon Muhammad and his glorious household. But after this. I was for a while in the regions of Syria, and in the city of Damascus\n\n\u00b9 Probably Sheykh A\u2014\u2014 himself, who in one of his letters mentioned incidentally that he had visited Acre\u2014a rare thing for an Ezeli to do.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\n'the spacious' [al-Fayhd], and Aleppo 'the grey' [ash-Shahbd], and the parts round about Mount Lebanon, and Tyre, and Sidon. And the misleadings of the Black Darkness brought me into the City of Blood, the town of Acre, which they call 'the City of Vision' [Madinat-al-shuhbd]; and, by my life! it is, indeed, the City of Vision, and a minaret for the consuming fire, and on it are poured forth darknesses, and lightnings, and thunders. There I plainly saw the manifestation of plurality, to wit, the combination of thunder, lightning, darkness, and the thunder-bolt; and I called to mind the Chapter of the Unbelievers of the Eternal Word. For these are they who have hidden the light of their original potentiality with the darkness of the attributes of wicked souls and the effects of a corrupt nature, and have been veiled from the Truth by Untruth.\" The first of these \"unbelieving souls and manifestations of infidelity,\" whom he met on the sea-shore, was none other than Beh\u00e1's eldest son 'Abb\u00e1s Efend\u00ed, whom he calls \"al-Wasw\u00e1s,\" which is an attribute of the devil meaning \"the whisperer\" or \"suggester\" [of wicked thoughts], and is numerically equivalent to the name 'Abb\u00e1s. After that,\" he continues, \"I saw the rest of the Wicked One's followers, and heard the words of each. Their sayings and arguments consist of a farrago of names, baseless stories, calumnies, falsehoods, and lies, and not one of them has any knowledge of even the first principles of the religion of the Bey\u00e1n or of any other religion. They are all devoid of knowledge, ignorant, short-sighted, of common capacity, hoodwinked, people of darkness, spurned of nature, hypocrites, corrupters of texts, blind imitators; God hath taken away from them his light and hath left them in the darkness of the Wicked One, and hath destroyed them in the abysses of vain imaginings, and hath put chains around their necks...\" After one or two pages of denunciation\n\n1 Kur'\u00e1n, cix.\n2 Kur'\u00e1n, cxiv, 4.\n3 Both words = 133.\nfilled with quotations from the Kur\u2019\u00e1n, which are interpreted in a sense far from flattering to Beh\u00e1 and his followers, the narrator describes how, after some days spent in the society of \u201csouls suggesting thoughts of evil,\u201d he was admitted to Beh\u00e1\u2019s audience-chamber. \u201cWhen I was come there,\u201d he continues, \u201cand looked upon that Archidol, that Greatest Talisman, that personified Revolt [T\u00e1gh\u00fat-i-mumaththal], that rebellious Lucifer [\u2018Az\u00e1zil-i-m\u00e1rid], that envious Ibl\u00eds, I saw a form on a throne, and heard the \u2018lowing of the calf.\u2019\u201d Then did I see how the light of the Most Great Name had shone on Ahriman the accursed, and how the finger of the demon wore the ring. For they had written the Name Beh\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll-Abh\u00e1 in divers writings, and called it \u2018the Most Great Name.\u2019 Thereat there came to my mind this verse of [H\u00e1d\u00edz] the Tongue of the Unseen\u2014\n\n\u2018Efficient is the Name Divine; be of good cheer, O heart! The d\u00edv becomes not Solomon by guile and cunning\u2019s art.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe narrator then describes his heartfelt joy on finding himself once more outside Acre, concluding in the following words, with which also the MS. ends:\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631 \u0646\u062c\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0649 \u0648\u062a\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0645\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062c\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0627 \u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062d \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u062b\u0631 \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0642\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0649 \u0633\u0643\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0643\u062a \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0630\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u0643 \u0639\u062a\u0648 \u0641\u0648\u0646\u0642\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u062f \u0648\u0631\u0622\u064a\u062a \u0637\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0635\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0627\u0635\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0625\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0643\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649\u060c \u0648\u0646\u0627\u062f\u062a \u064a\u062e\u0641\u0649 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u062c\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643\u064a \u0648\u064a\u0627 \u063a\u064a\u0627\u062b \u0645\u0646\n\n1 The Ez\u00e9lis compare Beh\u00e1 to the Golden Calf, to the worship of which S\u00e1miri seduced the Children of Israel. See Kur\u2019\u00e1n vii, 146; xx, 90; and Traveller\u2019s Narrative, vol. ii, p. 355 and n. 2.\n\n2 Allusion is made to the well-known story of the theft of Solomon\u2019s magic ring by one of the demons, who, by its aid, exercised for some time the supreme power.\n\n3 This is regarded throughout the B\u00e9g\u00e1n and by all the B\u00e1bs as the \u201cMost Great Name\u201d of God, but according to the Ez\u00e9lis it belongs properly to Subh-i-Ezel. Cf. Traveller\u2019s Narrative, vol. ii, p. 363, l. 11.\n\n4 The translation of this verse I have taken from Herman Bicknell\u2019s beautiful and noble rendering of H\u00e1d\u00edz (London, Tr\u00fcbner and Co., 1875), p. 131.\nI must now state the contents of this volume as briefly as possible, leaving a fuller account of its most interesting and valuable contents for some future occasion. Not being able to number the pages in the customary fashion, I avail myself of the scribe's Arabic numeration, according to which the first page of writing (f. 2r) is numbered p. 1, after which the pages (not the leaves) are numbered regularly (the even numbers only being written in) as far as p. 126 and p. 127, not numbered). At this point the numeration changes from the pages to the leaves (as though f. 2 had been numbered 1, f. 3a 2, etc.), and what, according to the system hitherto followed, should be (p.) 128 is actually marked (f.) 64. The numeration by leaves then proceeds regularly up to (f.) 175, where the portion of the MS. written on yellow paper (22 folios of 8 leaves each) ends. Then, separated by the hiatus already mentioned, come the 8 folios written on white paper. Here the numeration is again by pages, not leaves, the first page of the white being numbered 330. It proceeds regularly up to p. 438 (and p. 439, not numbered) except that pp. 416 and 417 are both numbered 416, thus making all the subsequent numbers up to 438 wrong by two. In the last folio the numeration again changes in the most erratic manner, the leaves of this folio being numbered from 201 to 208.\n\nThe Introduction extends from p. 1 to 37, and, after some preliminary remarks, enumerates and discusses fifteen \"virtues\" (\u062e\u0635\u0627\u0626\u0635) which the religion of the Bey\u00e1n has over all other religions, and seven \"claims\" (\u062f\u0639\u0627\u06cc\u06cc) which its adherents make for it.\n\nThe body of the work consists of eight chapters (for which reason, probably, the book is entitled Ha\u0161t Bih\u0161ht or \"the Eight Paradises\") and a conclusion. The index of these occupies the last thirteen lines of p. 37 and the first two lines of p. 38.

Written in a small, clear ta'lik. Headings and titles in red. Copied for me at Constantinople under the supervision of Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, the Ezeli, in the autumn of 1891.\n\nThe general characteristics of this book, and the special peculiarities of this particular MS. I have already discussed in a previous article (*J.R.A.S.* for April, 1892, pp. 261-8). To what I there said concerning the nomenclature of the chapters or *suras* which compose the Commentary on the Sura-i-Yusuf, I have now to add some further particulars with which Baron Rosen has most obligingly supplied me as to their nomenclature in a MS. of the same work in his own collection. (See *Coll. Sc. iii, Manuscrits Persans*, p. 50.) The nomenclature adopted in Baron Rosen's MS., in so far as it differs from that previously given by me at p. 263 supra, is as follows:\n\n| Chapter xiv. | \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0631 |\n|-------------|------------|\n| ,, xv.      | \" \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0634\u064a\u0629\" |\n| ,, xvi.     | \" \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0634\"   |\n| ,, xxi.     | \" \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\"   |\n| ,, xxvii.   | \" \u0647\u0648\"      |\n\n| Chapter xxxiii. | \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0646 |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| ,, xxxix.       | \" \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0643\u0631\"    |\n| ,, xlii.        | \" \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062f\u0627\"    |\n| ,, xliii.       | \" \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f\"    |\n| ,, xlvi.        | \" \u0647\u0648\"       |\nAs will be observed, one chapter (the last) is missing from the above list. Baron Rosen writes: \"Je ne sais pas comment il se trouve que le nombre des sourates est\nde 110 seulement au lieu de 111.

confirmation of Nabil\u2019s chronology (B. i, p. 526; B. ii, 984, 988, stanza 10), and further evidence against the impossibly early date (A.H. 1269) given by the Traveller\u2019s Narrative. See pp. 304-6 supra. It is curious that in two works composed by the Beh\u00e1\u2019\u00eds within so short a time of one another, and both intended for more or less general circulation, so glaring a discrepancy should have been allowed to appear, more especially as both dates are used evidently.\n\n2 This passage is also important, as affording further evidence that Kit\u00e1b-i-Akhd\u00e1s, not Lawh-i-Akhd\u00e1s,

book, in short, is an attempt to interpret the prophesies of the Old Testament, more especially of the book of Daniel, in favour of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\n\nEnds:\n\nI have now described, as fully as the space at my disposal would admit, all the B\u00e1b\u00ed MSS. in my possession, with the exception of a number of letters of greater or less importance, and certain scattered leaves containing transcripts, made by myself or others, of sundry poems, short epistles, etc., of which I have already published some, and hope, in due course, to publish such others as appear of sufficient interest. Of some of the MSS. described above (such as the various \"Books of the Names,\" and many of the Prayers, Exhortations, Visitations, and Rhapsodies) it is most improbable that complete editions could ever be required or contemplated; a few judiciously selected extracts would answer every practical purpose. Of others, such as the T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd, and both volumes of the Hasht\nBih\u0161kt, complete editions would certainly be desirable, could anyone be induced to incur the necessarily heavy expenses of publication. Failing this, however, abridged English translations might sufficiently answer the purpose; and of the T\u016br\u012bkh-i-Jad\u012bd, at all events, such a translation is now in the press, and will, I hope, appear in a few months. Of the more important sacred books of the B\u00e1b, Shuhb-i-Kasol, and Beh\u00e1, nothing will serve but complete texts prepared from the best available MSS. I have no doubt in my own mind that the Persian Bey\u00e1n should come first; and, with a view to publishing it in extenso, I have been for some time engaged on the collation of several MSS. Besides the two MSS. in my own possession (see p. 8, and no. 3), and the British Museum Codex (Or. 2619), the liberality of the Academy and the Institut des Langues Orientales of St. Petersburg has placed at my disposal, for periods of six months each, the two manuscripts of the work contained in their rich collections. Much work remains to be done ere we can venture to generalize with perfect safety on the relations, affinities, and tendencies of the B\u00e1bi movement, but that that work is well worth the doing I, for my part, do not for a moment doubt.\n\nDeath of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\n\nWithin the last few weeks news of the death of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h has reached me. I have not been able to ascertain the date of his decease, but of the fact itself there is no doubt, for it is confirmed by a letter written from Acre by his son, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Bad\u00ed'u'll\u00e1h, and dated Zi'l-Ka'da 29th, A.H. 1309 (June 25th, A.D. 1892).

my heart, and delight of my soul! In these days the showers of affliction do so descend from the clouds of the firmament of fate, and the thunderbolts of griefs and sorrows do so succeed one another, that neither hath the tongue strength to describe, nor the pen power to utter them. For the horizon of the Phenomenal World is bereft of the effulgences of the Sun of Wisdom and Revelation, and the throne of the Universe is deprived of the radiance of the Most Mighty Luminary. The ears of the friends are, to outward appearance, debarred from hearkening to the cry of the Supreme Pen, and the eyes of the longing are veiled from the contemplation of the Most Glorious Horizon. Great God! how dire a catastrophe is this which has arisen in the World, and how grievous a calamity is this which hath appeared in the Universe! The Sun of Truth hath bidden farewell to this earthly sphere, and now shines with a brightness which waneth not in the regions of Might and Glory. Albeit this supreme affliction transcends endurance, and this most dire disaster lays in ruins the edifice of resignation and patience, yet, having regard to the authoritative command and binding behest revealed from the Holy Angel-World in the Kit\u00e1b-i \u00c1kdas,\u00b9 we and you alike must adorn ourselves with the ornament of patience and resignation, lay hold of the firm rope of submission and acquiescence, apply ourselves with strong hearts and tranquil souls to what will conduce to the progress of mankind, the peace and prosperity of the world, the amelioration of characters, and the appearance of charity and concord, and attach ourselves with our whole being to the counsels of the Lord of the Visible and the Invisible, so that the Phenomenal World may, by the Grace of that Beneficent Being, be beheld an envy to the Garden of Paradise. Nor is this thing difficult with God. The blessed text revealed in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Akdas shall here be cited. He says (great is His Glory and universal His Bounty!):\n\n\u00b9 Cf. n. 2 at the foot of p. 708 supra.\n'O people of the earth! When the Sun of my Beauty sets, and the firmament of my Form is hidden, be not troubled; arise for the helping of my work and the advancement of my Word throughout the worlds. Verily We are with you under all conditions, and will help you with the Truth; verily We can do this.' Whosoever knoweth Me will rise up to serve me with such uprising that the hosts of heaven and earth shall not put him down.' And in another place he says: 'Say, \"O people, let not trouble take possession of you when the Kingdom of my Epiphany becomes concealed, and the Waves of the Ocean of my Utterance are hushed. Verily there is in my Epiphany a reason, and in my Occultation another reason, which none knoweth save God, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. And We shall see you from the Most Glorious Horizon, and will help whomsoever riseth up for the helping of our Work with hosts from the Supreme Concourse, and a cohort of the Cherubim.\"'\n\nThe same news reached me on the same day from my Ezel\u00ed correspondent in Constantinople, but in how different a form of words was his laconic announcement of Beh\u00e1's death couched! He added (I know not on what authority) that disputes had already arisen between two of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's sons, 'Abb\u00e1s Efend\u00ed and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad 'Al\u00ed, as to the succession; and that \u00c1k\u00e1 M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u00c1k\u00e1 J\u00e1n called Kh\u00e1dimu'll\u00e1h, Beh\u00e1's amanuensis and special attendant, had given his support to the latter, because he hoped to find him more pliable and more amenable to his own views and wishes. This statement I only give for what it is worth.\n\n1 A translation of part of this passage will be found quoted at p. 975 of B. ii. It occurs on f. 7b of B.B.P. 3, and f. 31b of B.B.P. 4.\n2 This passage occurs on f. 10b of B.B.P. 3, and ff. 38a\u201338b of B.B.P. 4.\n3 The latter I did not see at Acre, neither did I know where he was, though I heard mention of him. He it was, I believe, who invented the different forms of the Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d-i-B\u0101di', or \"New Writing.\" (See B. i, p. 498.) Of this writing I was unable to obtain a specimen, but I learn from Baron Rosen that M. Toumansky was more fortunate, and that amongst the treasures which he brought back from 'Istik\u00e1b\u00e1d were the words written in new character.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nWhat effect Beh\u00e1's death may have on the further development of B\u00e1b\u00edsm it is impossible to conjecture. Will the movement of which he has for so long a time been the guiding spirit, languish or lose ground? Will dissensions arise amidst his followers to produce further disruptions and schisms in the B\u00e1b\u00ed church? Will the Ked\u00edas (who, as it appears, keep themselves well informed of all that takes place at Acre) seize the opportunity to set on foot propaganda in favour of \u1e62ub\u1e25-i-\u012as\u0101? Or will the fabric, reared with such infinite pains by the departed Seer, prove able to withstand the disintegrating forces which, no longer kept in check by his master-hand, must almost inevitably come into play? Time alone will show.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 I learn from Baron Rosen that a short paragraph announcing the death of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h appeared in the Russian newspaper called Le Gouverneur, published at Tiflis; and that the news was also conveyed to him by Lieutenant Toumanski in a private letter, in which were enclosed copies of Beh\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's testamentary dispositions (\u0645\u06cc\u062b\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0635\u06cc\u062a) and an elegy on his death by the B\u00e1b\u00ed poet 'A\u1e63adull\u00e1h (M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Ashraf of L\u00e1hiy\u00e1n). Baron Rosen adds that Beh\u00e1 died on May 16th of this year (1892), but that the news of his decease did not reach 'Ishk\u00e1b\u00e1d till July 5th. The interesting documents forwarded by Lieutenant Toumanski are to appear in the Zapisski.\nART. XIV.\u2014Dusratta's Hittite Letter. By Major C. R. Conder, D.C.L., LL.D., R.E.\n\nThe subject of the present paper is the translation of one of the most interesting and important tablets that have been discovered within the last twenty years\u2014interesting not only from a linguistic point of view, but also as casting new light on the history of Western Asia, about 1500 years before our era, and as showing the manners of the age and the political relations of Egypt with Asiatic countries. It also informs us of the language spoken in Armenia and in Syria, and of the extent of the Hittite dominions before the fall of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty.\n\nThe tablet in question is the longest, and perhaps the most important, of all in the great collection of cuneiform letters to the kings of Egypt, which was discovered by the peasantry at Tell Amarna in Middle Egypt (between Minieh and Assiut on the east bank of the Nile) in 1887. These number some 300 in all, and those as yet translated are in an Aramean language resembling Assyrian. But there are two letters in the collection in another language, clearly not Semitic; and Dr. Hugo Winckler, who has published a transcription of these, with others, now in the Royal Museum at Berlin, came to the conclusion in 1888 that they were in the Hittite language, the main reason for such belief being, that the shorter of the two is written by a certain prince of Reseph (not far from Palmyra), who was named Tarkondara, and who calls himself in his letter the \"Prince of the Hittites.\" His epistle to Amenophis III. consists of thirty lines of ideographic writing, not easily interpreted; but it seems clear, from the pronouns and from other words, that the language is the same as that of the longer letter now under\nconsideration, which, as we shall see, is also written by a personage who calls himself the Hittite Suzerain. For these reasons it appears reasonable to suppose that we are dealing with the native language of the Hittite tribes, though the script is not that peculiar to their monuments, but that known as Cuneiform, and used by the Akkadians, their neighbours.\n\nThe introduction to the letter, as Dr. Winckler points out, consists of eight lines of Assyrian or Aramean. The bulk of the letter consists of 512 lines of native language. The writer is Dusratta, a well-known chief of Mitani or Southern Armenia, a region which was the later Melitene. He addresses Amenophis III. of Egypt, and speaks of his father Suttarna, and of his daughter Tadukhepa. There are in the same collection other letters, in Aramean, from the same Dusratta, which have been translated, and which refer to the same personages\u2014Gilius, the Armenian, and Menes, the Egyptian envoy\u2014who are so often mentioned in the letter now to be considered. From these letters we know that Dusratta was one of the most important political personages of his time. His sister Thi was married to Amenophis III.; and Amenophis IV. married his cousin\u2014Dusratta\u2019s daughter. The Tell Amarna collection includes a letter from a Suttarna, and many others from kings of Babylon and Assyria, and from princes of Elishah and Syria, to the two Egyptian kings mentioned; but Dusratta speaks as a personal friend and relative, and his letters are of higher interest than those of other correspondents, while his character comes out, in some of his utterances, in a manner which shows that he must have been personally a very remarkable man.\n\nTo understand aright the relations of the Asiatics with the Egyptians in this age it is only necessary to turn to Dr. Brugsch\u2019s History of Egypt. It is well known that, in the Hyksos period, various Asiatic tribes invaded and ruled over the Delta: that their expulsion was first attempted by Ahmes I. of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty about 1700 B.C.: that Thothmes III. conquered all Syria\nand part of the regions beyond the Euphrates; and that a century after his conquest, about 1500 B.C., Amenophis III. was still master of the conquered regions, and in communication with the princes of neighbouring states, in Assyria, Babylonia, and Asia Minor. But these conquests were lost by his indolent son Amenophis IV., who lived at Tell Amarna, where his desecrated sarcophagus has just been found. The later letters speak of the revolt of Hittites and Hebrews; and it is certain that the marriage of Tadukhepa did not fulfil her father's hopes, and that a revolution in Egypt put an end to her husband's life and dynasty. It was then\u2014according to the ordinary chronology\u2014that the Hebrews invaded Palestine, while the Hittites became independent in the north, and so remained till reconquered by Rameses I. and Rameses II. of the nineteenth dynasty. But, at the time when our letter was written, Egyptian power was paramount to the Euphrates, and Amenophis III. had gone beyond the river on a hunting excursion, to kill lions, during which time he perhaps first made Dusratta's acquaintance. About 1450 B.C. the old Armenian monarch\u2014writing to his son-in-law\u2014speaks with affection of the great Amenophis, and relates his sorrow when he heard of his death. He recalls the fact that Amenophis III. sent a \"message asking for his daughter\"; and he adds, \"may I die but may he who loved me live with God.\" Our present letter appears to be the answer sent to this original message.\n\nAs far as I am aware no attempt has yet been made to determine the character of the language, or to translate the contents of Dusratta's Hittite letter. Dr. Sayce kindly sent me a short printed paper, which contains his preliminary remarks on the text, which are very valuable; and in this paper (where published is not stated) he has pointed out the words which are clearly indicated by determinatives, such as the names of countries, cities, personages, and deities; and in addition has proposed ten words as having certain meanings, including father, tablet, scribe, God, friend, wife, envoy, brother, interpreter, and\nimage; and in each case he seems to be right, though in two other cases I think an emendation possible. Dr. Sayce, however, does not indicate whether he regards the language as Aryan or Mongolic: from certain remarks on syntax I conclude that he favours the former view; but it should be noted that there are 400 different words in the inscription, many of the commonest of which are so often repeated (owing to the great length of the text) that it becomes easy to determine approximately what they mean. Dr. Sayce renders *Am\u0101tippi* \"grandfather\": it certainly applies to a personage, but occurs with the personal name Artatan; whereas from a letter published last year we know that the name of Dusratta's grandfather was Sitatama. I think the word more probably means \"friend.\" The second word which I at first regarded as fixed by Dr. Sayce is *gipanu* \"a papyrus,\" but on further study it appears more probably to mean \"a decree\"; and the word for papyrus which occurs in the text is *a allali pa* or \"leaf of the water reed.\"\n\nAfter reading Dr. Sayce's paper I was struck by the resemblance of some of the words which he determined to words of the Turkic languages of Central Asia\u2014especially *atta* \"father,\" *talami* \"interpreter,\" and *eena* \"gods.\" On careful examination of the text, as given in the original characters by Dr. Winckler in his great publication of 1891, I also observed that the cases of the noun, in words which could clearly be shown to be nouns, were the same as those of the Turkic dialects. Subsequently I found that the verb substantive was also Turkic, and that all Dr. Sayce's words could be so compared. A great many words were also very clearly the same as in Akkadian\u2014the old language of Chaldea which scholars now regarded as closely related to Turkic speech\u2014and as in the cognate dialect, called Medic or the \"third language\" of the Behistun texts, which Dr. Oppert also regards as closely connected with Turkic speech.\n\nIt also became clear that the language was agglutinative, and presented the grammar, not of Aryan but of Mongolic\nspeech, and these indications therefore all pointed clearly in one direction, independently of the vocabulary of some 400 different words.\n\nIn speaking of Akkadian I am aware that some scholars deny the existence of any such language; but on the other hand it has been upheld by equally distinguished writers; and I think that the former school can hardly have studied the grammar of the Akkadian, and the bilinguals in Akkadian and Assyrian, since it is quite impossible to reconcile Akkadian with any Semitic syntax, whereas the Mongolic languages present exactly the required structure, to say nothing of the comparison of some 400 known Akkadian words with those of living Mongolic languages. It has also quite recently become known that, as early as 2500 B.C. or earlier, the Akkadian King Gudea ruled from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, and had conquered part of Syria. It is therefore not unnatural to find that the Akkadian language closely resembled that of tribes of Hittites, in Syria and in Southern Armenia. As regards the Medic language, spoken about 500 B.C. in the countries ruled by the Persians, near the Tigris, the Mongolic character of that language is generally admitted. It appears to me to bear to that of Dusratta's letter exactly the relation we should expect, considering the lapse of a thousand years: that is to say that the Medic words are decayed representatives of those used by Dusratta, just as a modern English word compares with the Anglo-Saxon; but the Mongolic languages change so slowly that in the speech of the Yakuts, or Turko-Mongols of Siberia, in our own times, many Akkadian and Medic words still remain unchanged, although, in structure and vocabulary, the language as a whole has undergone considerable modifications.\n\nThese comparisons will be found worked out in detail in the grammatical treatise and index attached to the present paper. I do not claim for these attempts more than a provisional character. It is evident that in dealing\nwith what is called an \"unknown\" language I must have made many mistakes, which will be pointed out, especially as to words occurring only once or twice; but in such study the difficulty diminishes as the inscription becomes longer, since all common words of the language will then be found often recurring. It is sufficient for the moment to note that these common words are all of Mongolic character; and that the pronouns, the cases, the forms of the verb, and the syntax, all agree in rendering the comparison with Akkadian, Medio, and Turkic speech, very complete and evident. While emendations are to be expected, and indeed have occurred to me in several passages, since I first sent a paper on the subject to the Times last December, there can still, I think, be no doubt as to the general gist of the inscription, or as to the character of the language.\n\nDusratta speaks of his Kingdom as that of the Minii, who are presumably the Minyans, well known in later times to the Assyrians as living west of Lake Van, and mentioned in the Bible (Jer. li, 27) in the same region. They are probably the same people called Men in Egyptian inscriptions (Brugsch Egypt, vol. i, p. 234), who in the Hyksos period were ruling in Zoan, and whose portraits are regarded as showing a Mongol type. They had been expelled for more than a century when Dusratta wrote, but were still powerful in the north. The tablet of Edfou speaks of them as inhabitants of Assyria, and from the decree of Canopus it appears that they dwelt east of Syria. In later times an Aryan race invaded the country round Lake Van, where they left inscriptions (about 800 B.C.) in a language which, as I pointed out to the Royal Asiatic Society last year, is clearly comparable with Persian and Sanskrit. But in Dusratta's time\u2014some 700 years earlier\u2014these invaders had as yet not come down from the Caucasus; and his subjects were of the same sturdy Mongol race to which the Hittites and the Akkadians also belonged.\n\nThe letter generally refers to a message received by\nDusratta from Menes, the envoy of Amenophis III.: to the marriage of his daughter Tadukhepa; and to the affairs of his kingdom, his boundaries, his gifts of money, and of a throne sent to Egypt; and, if I understand aright, to the fact that the message was only verbal, and not well understood or regarded as well authorized, so that he is anxious to receive a confirmation of the good news, in a decree written on papyrus, which he has been told is about to follow. Tadukhepa is then to be sent to Zoan, and to Egypt, to marry the heir of the reigning Pharaoh, which was eventually accomplished. There are references to the translation of his letter into Egyptian, and he sends Gilias, who was a relation of his, in order to receive a full report from his own people.\n\nTaking the paragraphs in order, it is to be observed that difficulties arise, since the tablet is broken in two, and much damaged, and because the words are not always clearly divided by spaces; but as a whole it is very clearly expressed and business-like, forming a political document which was of high importance, of which remained undisturbed in the palace of the Egyptian king for nearly 2400 years, till the peasantry dug it up with the rest of this curious library in 1887.\n\nThe first paragraph is in Assyrian, as Dr. Winckler points out. It is much injured, but the names of Dusratta and Amenophis are distinguishable, and the words \"I am at peace... to thy ladies, to thy princes, to thy horses... to thy land, and to all that is thine (may there be) exceeding peace.\" The first paragraph in native language is also much injured, but appears to refer to the offer detailed later, that Dusratta's conquests in Phoenicia should be recognized by Egypt as part of the marriage compact, and included within the borders of the Minyan kingdom. In the next paragraph there is a reference to former relations with Suttarna, the father of the writer who was favoured by Egypt, and to the message received from Menes; to the honour thereby conveyed; and to gold, which was to be sent, with the message conveyed by a\nMinyan embassy. In the third section the writing is uninjured as a rule, and here we obtain the following:\n\n\"May the god Tessub (a name of Rimmon), the god Sansbe, with thy god Amanu\\(^1\\) and the god Simigiz, and the god Ea the lord of all, cause this to be fulfilled, the gods speeding the (business) speedily. So may they will to give thee thy desire, for if they are benignant it will be despatched very speedily; may they grant me that it be done. Messages also shall make clear speedily (as I desire) that a great honour has been done.\"\n\n\"Gilias the envoy, taking the message, is ordered to speak, his duty being to go forth, because Amenophis, the Egyptian friend, rules in a far off land, and I rule in the city of Ikhibin (perhaps Kaban Maden in the country west of Lake Van), which is the city of the god Simigiz, who is adored as the paternal deity. Having received the reply to be spoken\u2014for words of reply are very speedily to be despatched\u2014him I instructed in the presence of the Minyans. He is doing this important duty, whom I ordered because I see that he is speedy in what is to be done, and because Gilias knows how to speak, in completion of what is not written fully. Thus the god Simigiz is besought, to speed my man quickly; so he shall show, by word of mouth, what is sent back\u2014my brother\u2014bearing the desire of the Minyan land. May it avail that he should journey so to do. Why this is done brother, let messages fully explain, and what I desire. The servant of the god Simigiz, of Amanu, and of the holy Ea\u2014the Minyan, brother\u2014receiving, this must be done: he by your favour receiving a favourable reply to show. Because of my brother having so done let messages explain, being made to be accomplished by the paternal god Simigiz: the god Simigiz adored brother by me. Let me be gladdened hearing thy messages, and favoured by thee, receiving intelligible messages after this has been received.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) From another letter of Dusratta's, written in Assyrian, it is clear that the god Amanu was the Egyptian god Amen.\nFrom this and other passages that follow we gather that Ea, the Akkadian god, was adored by Dusratta; and his name indeed appears to be the same with the word *Ee*, used in this letter as meaning \"god,\" which is the Turkic *eye* for a \"deity\" or \"spirit.\" The old explanation \"house of water,\" is not only unlikely, but is contrary to the rules of Mongol grammar. The rest of the tablet is here injured.\n\nThe second columns of the front of the tablet now follow with the passage:\n\n\"As besides, information is to be sent... brother, as to what my brother desires to make me possess. Gillias and Menes being empowered by me to go together, and being decided that they shall go to the far off land, being desirous to write I do so quickly: brother, thy province being ruled by me jointly\u2014the whole race of which as you know you named me Suzerain.\" After an obscure sentence it continues:\n\n\"An embassy to show that I am placed in possession; a record to be kept by me; my brother himself at the same time ordering a decree, to make me take possession. Menes (having asked), my Minyan is made ready, to assist him in speaking. With all judgment may he serve, explaining the letter. Menes having been sent, travelling to thee, and being received, let a decree be ordered to be despatched; the things in this tablet being first received: brother, let a decree be ordered to be borne, rolled up (or sealed up): it being ordered that the letter to be delivered be received sealed.\" The tablet is much injured after this passage and twenty-seven lines have been lost. The next passage in the lower part refers to the gift or tribute sent by Dusratta.\n\n\"My gift was to be delivered very quickly... brother I am sending it in fulfilment... the gods earnestly beseeching to hear what I say, that like as I have received I have given. The gold brother I myself decreed that the whole land should again give, and I send it to be delivered very speedily. The people having understood\nthat the King (demands) a double tribute, it goes, I despatching it.\"\n\n\"To proceed: as Menes my brother's envoy says, it is understood that my brother is extremely desirous that it should be completed, it being decreed how all the region alike anew is made to give, let gold be taken from all the region: an additional tax being proclaimed... it was (therefore) proclaimed, and written, and explained, to give thee double very quickly. My brother having decreed after this wise, to be made ready. I am desirous to give it quickly.\"\n\nDusratta then assures the King of his willingness to fulfil these obligations, and proceeds in an injured passage to refer to the affairs of Northern Syria\u2014a subject which recurs in a better preserved part of the letter later on.\n\n\"As Menes says that my brother much desires that an explanatory letter be written, his embassy being gladly received in the Minyan Kingdom\u2014being at once and gladly received in the Minyan Kingdom\u2014this letter of mine was written. A papyrus having been sent me I shall be informed, if I have not rightly understood what has been said by Menes. But if it be so I shall gladly be commanded: this brother confirm thou thus, the proclamation being received by me, clear and intelligible altogether.\"\n\n\"As Menes says that an embassy will come quickly, therefore his news will be favourably received in the Minyan Kingdom.\" The passage which follows is somewhat broken, but repeats the desire for a confirmation of the verbal message, or pour parler which preceded the final treaty; but which the diplomatic Dusratta is cautious not to accept too readily: a very important passage is here probably lost referring to the relations to be established.\n\nTurning to the back of the tablet we find the question of translation to be next treated very fully.\n\n\"My brother (beholds) the continuation of the message. Brother, I not knowing whether the servant rendered well or badly the message in thy language, the interpreter having heard what was said, the servant explained with explanation\nthe message sent in thy language. Brother, my speech-maker being bound to make clear, by spoken word bound to make clear, and also by speaking together, my brother shall be informed of everything by the message. What my brother does not understand, when interpreted, this, being further spoken, shall be said at length. I also preferring to cause this to be written carefully . . . . . . making every effort, and also speaking at length, to explain what is clearly written. Brother, thy language is not used here, is it? I am telling them to take care as regards the explanation of what is put before you: by the mouth of the subject taking the message it shall be made clear brother, by his word, what the Minyan Kingdom has said, which, being interpreted, understand thou perfectly. I, not being sure as to all that was said, my brother's servant having spoken in thy language the message which he gave. The servant being a foreigner, the Minyan told me what the word was in thy speech. Brother, I am glad, preparing to speak, that Menes is about to come again with Gilias as a comrade. Menes and Gilias knowing all. The Minyan telling me what is done, making to agree as to what remains in dispute, my brother having received all that they are made to say\u2014my speech being foreign\u2014this done, brother, the speech being made for me by the Minyan, received as a comrade. Gilias having come again with Menes. Gilias and Menes having come, brother, for me the speech being made in Minyan, a mutual agreement will be made, as to what remains in dispute.\u201d\n\nThis passage I have carefully revised, and the rendering seems to give a probable sense, though the language of the original is very cramped.\n\n\u201cTo proceed: they having travelled and messages being received, let my brother order, and let me hear, that it is to be done: word thereof is besought\u2014information that you favour the arrangement. Your settlement thereof is earnestly urged. What my brother desires of me thereunto an order receiving, if thou art favourable. In addition\nalso to Menes, my brother's envoy: in addition to Gilias and Artessupas, Asalis is an envoy\u2014the interpreter of Gilias. Asalis my scribe, him also, as understanding how to make clear quickly in thy language this my writing, him, my chieftain, brother, I am glad to have sent.\"\n\n\"Brother, very gladly I send by the envoy a gold throne, in exchange for the brilliant gift with the envoy, my brother's gift of a crown; I send back this throne to thy abode, to please a concubine of thine when seeing it. Let it be given; being speedily despatched, my brother giving sanction by his order.\"\n\n\"Brother, pardon my having done so, the envoy having thought the gift (acceptable); and being hindered in saying what I much wished to have written, as to having sent my gift to be borne to my brother, my brother will understand what I wish to write. It is enough briefly to tell my brother that it was given.\"\n\n\"Brother, I gladly give power to the envoy to lead in return, this woman whom Menes says my brother gave power to bring, when he was ordered as an envoy: my brother, as Menes says, having preferred the bringing by an envoy, and my brother having ordered her bringing by Menes\u2014he shall bring her. What I say being understood to be considered timely, my brother having ordered Menes, as he says, to bring her.\"\n\n\"Understanding that my brother desires now to take her home\u2014is it not\u2014brother understanding this decision to be preferred, is it not obligatory? As twenty-three months have gone by, is not her being taken home to be hastened: my court also having decided to accept, and resolved to sanction the (agreement?) and being satisfied together with my wife, and the girl being pleased to the depth of her heart when told\u2014how happy words cannot tell\u2014with the gods is the decision, with the strong gods, brother, is the decision for me, the girl being . . . . Whether also I do not desire that she should be so brilliantly exalted, the girl being . . . . advantageously, surely you know it is so . . . . surely you know that I shall be happy.\"\nThe broken part that follows is in the same strain, after which six lines are lost; and below these a broken fragment contains Tadukhepa's name, and speaks of her being highly favoured, and going a long journey from the Minyan Kingdom to the land of Zoan, and afterwards dwelling in Egypt, with another invocation of Rimmon and Amanu, to cause the fulfilment of the agreement, and with a further reference to his expected recognition as the ruler of the Phoenicians. In this passage Dusratta introduces his own name, to make the expected concession more binding and clearer.\n\nThe right hand columns are well preserved and continue this important subject.\n\n\"Brother, thy border in the land over against Egypt is... and to proceed, I being ordered to extend myself thereto, command thou the people to take me as master and King, their duty... being made known, interpreted by interpreter, is not the possession thus to be made clear? Proclaim thou for me that, whatever of the peoples of the land of Chalcis, the Phoenicians west of the Minyan Kingdom, of the people of the land of Chalcis, I have conquered, is made subject. Brother thy word is enough, no one henceforth disputing my right, as master of the peoples. Is not this clearly thus? As to the expedition (or Lordship) is it not that it will be thus?\"\n\n\"To proceed. Let my brother send his order giving possession to me alone, of that which I am desirous to have extended. The order received, I go forth. Brother, to me as an order\u2014if my brother so favours me, having ordered all to be clearly written, thereby this region being ruled jointly by me. I being Suzerain of the power of the Hittite land; taking to me, brother, all the people conquered. Let it extend to the city of Harran, the region which no king enjoys being taxed. Brother, I go forth, my brother confirming it fully by this proclamation.\"\n\n\"To proceed, enough not being said as to my desire of being put in possession of these possessions by my brother. I and my Court being told that it is as was sent, my Court\nwill go forth, my brother having made them Minyan by Royal command. Your aid the Minyan land joyfully will accept, messages of authorization being received, by a tablet with my brother's Royal command in writing. Brother, I tell them that no grant has been received from you, as to giving possession; brother having told them that no grant is given, they have stopped fighting at the word spoken. Brother, authorization being received, received by Embassies, being gladly received when they come back to the Minyan Kingdom, let me hear what is (wished?). Brother, order thou to be written thy full grant of these things.\"\n\nThe next passage depends mainly on the meaning of the word *Ammatippi*, and I think that my original understanding of it must be abandoned, in favour of one which appears to fit in better with the general subject.\n\n\"To proceed. The sanction will favour me (is it not so?) as being the father. The tablet will be engraved with writing (is it not so?) the tablet giving sanction for me the father, as a favoured friend. This former tablet being engraved with writing (is it not so?) all this tablet having been ordered to be written, let my brother order a tablet to be written anew, when what is written in the words of this same tablet is understood, having ordered it to be written, answer it when you speak my brother; the things written answer thou; the things to be written answer thou\" . . . . . .\n\n\"If so be that sanction is granted to me by return, it shall be so written: thus must letter for letter be made, brother: it being given a clear signature; being thus made recognizable by signature; and my brother having made the letter binding, again we shall be bound by word of sworn friendship.\"\n\n\"Brother, the completion of the letter being hastened, my brother will understand when it is said that the answer must be hastened. It is to be considered, that my child having resolved, it must be considered as to the road to be followed, my child being hastened on her journey. My\nfriend Artatan having been sent to the father, let messages explain as to her being ordered to go: the agreement for the maiden being sanctioned; the messenger speaking as to my child's appearing; let messages explain that the agreement is sanctioned: the father doing what is due. Order thou the envoy to speak as to my child's appearing; my friend the father saying\u2014is it not so\u2014what is due to the father. Let him bear a letter of decree, this giving confidence to my people, when safely received, if also it is said 'what he is doing ought not to be done' Moreover, let the decree say that my brother is pleased. Brother, as my authority, brother, a decree being to me as authority, first having been caused to come, being an authority as to what my brother decides, this assurance being first given.\"\n\n\"This, then, is my brother's answer. I also am not urging her to be married: if the decree orders me your friend to keep the paternal gold: the decree returning to me the father to keep what belongs to me, I am not urging that father's child to be sent from home. The decree thus ordering me, which my brother sends, I shall be glad, taking kindly the return to me of the enjoying of friendship. She the Minyan will go to be married, setting forth to be given. My brother's decree will be understood as a message settling what my brother authorizes. As the king desires . . . I the father as my brother desiring.\"\n\nAfter a broken passage the same subject continues: \"My brother being seen to be in earnest, my daughter will be ready, to be married for me by my brother in presence of the deity, my brother having this business done very quickly in the strange land. So charging my brother with the business, that she be wedded by thy son, having been taken away from the Minyan land. Having sent again . . . and perceiving the king in earnest, this region which I rule hearing the announcement, my brother at once (sending) an order to this region which I rule\" (the sense is then obscured by breaks in the text), but the next words are clear:\n\"in the presence of the Royal city of Thebes, before the god Sausbe whom I adore, my son-in-law being married\"; and, again, \"The marriage of Tadukhepa, is it not thus that Dusratta, the favoured friend from the land of Mitani, consenting to the wish of Amenophis the Egyptian friend, that the son of Amenophis be so married to her in the presence of the image of the deity, Dusratta who dwells afar off arranges.\"\n\n\"All that prince and people are able to do, assuring to be done very quickly, it is hoped that the Minyan will be commanded to the utmost. Brother, my subject acting for me, as thought best, having written fully, the subject having received what is graciously to be conveyed to me in the Minyan land: the princes ruling the whole race of the Minyans having agreed: this people which my brother made subject to me seeing what I do to be beneficial to their land, ready to trust as subjects what I do: a decree being made; my brother of Egypt and the ruling Minyan princes having agreed, and the people made submissive; all being written which I had to speak about . . . . increasing renewal of friendship (is produced). The Minyan land being increased; I also if the subject race are not obedient levying war if obliged . . . . therefore also make thou the people to be (ruled) by a Prince.\"\n\nIn conclusion of this account of Dusratta's letter, it is to be acknowledged that the translation is no doubt rough, and may be improved. The language has two great defects: the first being that there is no distinction of gender; and the second that (as in Akkadian and Medic) there is only a very imperfect distinction of tense. Thus while the language at first appears simple, practically it proves to be much more obscure than any inflected speech. Turkish is the admiration of grammarians for its regularity, but agglutinative languages do not possess the power of Aryan\nspeech. There can however, I think, be little doubt as to the general meaning; and we have thus suddenly become possessed of some 400 Hittite words, which will be of the greatest value in the future, in finally settling the translation of Hittite texts. The Hittites who dwelt in Northern Syria were of the same stock with Akkadians, and early inhabitants of Armenia and Asia Minor, and Dusratta ruled them as Suzerain from the Upper Euphrates. In Syria they were mingled with Semitic Phoenicians, but even as late as 720 B.C. they were still the dominant race. As an inscription of seventy lines has now been brought home by Mr. D. G. Hogarth, which is in the Hittite character, I have some hope that I may in the future be able to place before the Royal Asiatic Society a translation worthy of criticism, of a text in their own characters; since the language is shown to be clearly of the Turkic class, by the evidence of the present text in a known character. It can I think in future hardly be denied that the Hittites\u2014whose features on the Karnak monuments and on their own (to say nothing of their pigtails) are so decidedly Mongolian\u2014belonged, not to the later Aryan race which settled near Lake Van, but to the older Mongol stock, of which the Akkadians also were a very important branch.\n\nSKETCH OF THE GRAMMAR.\n\nThe inscription is written in syllables, in the character used in Cuneiform texts about 1500 B.C., and with comparatively few determinatives or ideograms, but probably a good many phonetic complements. The characters given in the index are those corresponding in later Assyrian\u2014used for facility in printing.\n\nThe syntax is similar to that of the Akkadian and Medic rather than of the modern Mongolic languages. The object\nis followed by the subject, and the verb stands always at the end of the clause, as in all Turanian speech, in which it never precedes, as is commonly the case in Aryan languages. The adjective (of which there are few) follows its substantive. The defining word (or genitive) may precede the defined (or nominative) without any mark of case, as in Aryan and Mongol speech\u2014an arrangement which shows that the language cannot be Semitic: since in Semitic languages the case is reversed. The genitive may also follow the nominative with a case suffix\u2014as in Akkadian and Medic.\n\nOther marks of the Mongolic character of the language are found in the absence of gender to the nouns, and of prepositions, which are replaced by postpositions: also by the non-existence of the relative pronoun, and the construction which is used to express it indirectly. The regularity of the cases; and the formation of forms of the verb by auxiliaries prefixed (as in Akkadian): the postponed position of the possessive pronoun, and the preposing of the personal pronoun, also show the grammatical connection with Medic and Akkadian. The adjective and adverb are indistinguishable, as in modern Turkish. The great length of the words (as in Mongolic languages generally) is due to the incorporation of various particles. The vowel harmony, according to which the particle agrees with the vowel of the root, is also a peculiarity of Mongolic speech, which is traceable also in Medic and Akkadian.\n\nThe Noun.\n\nThe ordinary cases of the noun, formed by suffixes which are the same for all words (without distinction of gender), are the same as in Turkic languages, and for the most part as in Akkadian. The nominative ends in -s for the indefinite and in -pi for the definite case (Medic pi), and the plural is na, as in Mongolian (Akkadian -ene), which\nis prefixed to the case suffix, as in all Mongolic speech. The other cases commonly found are:\n\n| HITTITE | TURKISH | AKKADIAN |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Genitive | -na     | -n       | na \"of.\" |\n| Dative   | -a      | -a       | ... \"to.\" |\n| Locative | -ta     | -da      | -ta \"at.\" |\n| Accusative | -e    | -i       | ... Acc. |\n| Ablative | -dan    | -den     | -ta \"by.\" |\n| Instrumental | -li  | -li      | ... \"with.\" |\n| Causative | -kku    | -ichun   | -ku \"for.\" |\n| Comitative | -allan | -ailan   | ... \"together with.\" |\n\nIn addition to these usual cases there are other suffixes found occasionally, which are the same as in Akkadian, e.g. -si \"in presence of\" -ra \"towards\" or \"going to\" -ku \"in\" -sa \"inside\" -ta \"from.\"\n\nThe noun is formed from the root in many cases by adding -ma -da -k or -t, and the adjective by -ra, as in other Mongol languages. The object often ends in -an; and the adverbs have in most instances the same termination. These endings are also found in Turkic speech, with -i which is the nomen actionis. The case -pi or -ippi is that which is called the definite nominative in some Mongolic languages; and this suffix takes the place of the definite article. Collective nouns appear to be indicated by the prefix man, and the prefix nam (or anam) \"in the condition of\" occurs, as in Akkadian.\n\n**The Verb.**\n\nThe terminations of the verb seem to resemble those of the Medic language. The time is not very well distinguished, but it would seem that -sa is the 3rd person singular for present and future, and -ta for the perfect. The precative is formed by -sena, which is the Medic -suc, and the 2nd person singular imperative ends in -s, as in Medic. As a rule the participial forms are much used, the\nactive would appear to be -lan and -an, and the passive -ku or khu, -kha or -ka. The infinitive active is formed by prefixing ni- or an-, as in Medic and Akkadian. The passive is formed by adding -il or -al to the root, before the mood or tense ending, and this answers exactly to the Turkish passive -il-: the particles na and ma, meaning \"to go\" and \"to make,\" are inserted in the same way, to form the causative (as na is also used in Medic), and the same is expressed in other ways, by reduplication of the root, and by prefixed auxiliaries. The termination -man or -van also occurs for the participle as in Medic, and -manlu (\"jointly\") may be recognized, which Dr. Oppert calls the reciprocal in Medic.\n\nThe verb substantive ai, like the Turkish ai or \u0101, also follows the verb, and is found in the past tense (aidan), as well as the present (ain), and participle (ailan): it also seems, in one or two cases, that the verb ol \"to become\" is represented by ulli. The prefixed auxiliaries are the same as in Akkadian, which in modern languages are usually suffixed. They include be \"to make,\" ip \"to create,\" ma \"to make,\" eti \"to do\" or \"make,\" and khil \"to make\" or \"do.\" Dan \"must\" is also prefixed as in Akkadian, and in one case we have gan \"let,\" forming the subjunctive, a prefix as in Akkadian. This simple structure appears to apply to all the verbs.\n\nPronouns.\n\nThe personal pronouns are \u016b \"I,\" with its cases \u016be \"me,\" \u016ba \"to me,\" \u016bna \"of me,\" for the first: Ti \"thou\" \"thee,\" ta \"to thee,\" for the second; and as usual there is strictly speaking no 3rd person, though sa and na are so used. \u016b \u016b appears to mean \"I myself,\" and the pronoun nippi \"self\" may be added to either of the preceding. As in other Mongolic languages the possessive pronoun is formed usually by placing the personal one after the noun, and the case ending follows; but, as in Medic, an emphatic possessive is formed by prefixing the personal pronoun, in the nomi-\nnative case, to the noun\u2014as \u016b ukki \u201cmy own people.\u201d In this instance the case suffix is attached directly to the noun. There appears to be great care taken in the writing to distinguish the pronoun cases. Ir \u201chim,\u201d as an incorporated pronoun, is used as in Medic. The great fault of the language is that the gender is in no way indicated as a rule; and this renders it difficult, in many cases, to explain the numerous incorporations with certainty. The common demonstratives are a \u201cthis,\u201d atinin \u201cthat\u201d (in accusative), a\u016b, bu, and sunpi, \u201cthis same\u201d \u201cthe same,\u201d Imma \u201cthis same,\u201d Api \u201cwhat,\u201d Khu Kha Khai \u201cthat\u201d \u201cwhich,\u201d bi \u201cthey\u201d \u201cthem,\u201d na, ni \u201che\u201d \u201cshe\u201d \u201cit,\u201d na \u201cthey,\u201d enin \u201cthem,\u201d Pi \u201cthe\u201d \u201cwhich,\u201d ubbi and abbe \u201cwho\u201d \u201cwhom,\u201d sa \u201cthis man,\u201d as \u201cwhatever.\u201d\n\nNumerals.\n\nOne only occurs, viz. xxiii, expressed in numeral form (viii. 60); it precedes the noun ie \u201cmonth\u201d (Akkadian ai, Turkic ai or eie \u201cmonth\u201d): but bizuus may mean \u201cdouble\u201d and id \u201csingle.\u201d Maanna appears to mean \u201cfirst of all\u201d or \u201cpreviously.\u201d The sounds of the numerals are, however, not to be discovered in other cases. Ari seems to mean \u201cfirst,\u201d \u201cat once.\u201d\n\nConjunctions.\n\nThe common conjunction is pasa \u201calso\u201d or \u201cagain,\u201d but u \u201cand\u201d seems to be recognizable, as in Turkic speech. As a rule conjunctions are avoided, and seem to be omitted, which is also the case in other Mongolic languages.\n\nAdverbs and Particles.\n\nA good many of these appear to be fairly certain, and are very similar to those commonly used in Turkic speech, as well as in Akkadian and Medic. Among these may be noted Aini \u201cwell,\u201d ala- \u201cback,\u201d Beemi \u201cfully,\u201d Dukhu \u201ccompletely,\u201d en \u201cas,\u201d enna \u201cthus\u201d (\u201cas this\u201d), guru\n\"wholly,\" guka \"greatly,\" Isi \"how,\" iummi \"altogether,\" Kii \"together with,\" Ki \"as,\" Iskhin \"briefly,\" Khasa \"how much,\" Khasien \"when,\" Lik \"as to,\" Me \"when,\" Mu \"as to,\" Padan \"plainly,\" Paan \"highly,\" Pati \"surely,\" Pasani \"again,\" Pidra \"either,\" Satti \"all that,\" Sini \"anew,\" Siin \"alike,\" Suka \"at the same time,\" Taa \"so,\" Tase \"because,\" Timme \"as,\" Tissan \"quickly,\" Tissi \"at length,\" Zaru \"afterwards.\" The particles and adverbs, as a rule, precede and follow the verb respectively.\n\nNegatives.\n\nNu \"not\" occurs as in Akkadian (Turkic ne \"nor\"), and anni \"not\" is also found, with Ma \"it is not,\" used in its proper place after the noun as in Turkic speech: annae may perhaps mean \"none.\"\n\nPhonetics.\n\nAs regards the sounds of the language it is to be noted that the distinction of long and short vowels, which forms so important a feature of inflected languages (Aryan or Semitic), has less importance in agglutinative languages, like that under consideration. It is clear that several words are spelt in more than one way, so that one would seem to suggest a short vowel, and the other spelling a long one: e.g. Pal-da and Pa-alda, or Khal-lan and Kha-allan, but as a rule the same word is always spelt the same way, and distinguished thereby from a different word of similar sound. Great care seems to have been taken, in the whole of this text, to ensure distinctness of meaning.\n\nThe vowels are a e i u, and perhaps au as a diphthong. The gutturals are k g and kh, with \u016b, which may have been pronounced hu. There is nothing to show if the eu sound of the Turkic languages was in use (closely resembling the French u); the words beginning with ya or ye, such as yal and yem, are peculiarly Turkic. The palatals l and r very rarely begin any words. In Turkic speech they hardly ever do, and in this respect the language is nearer\nto Mongolian and Akkadian than to Turkish. The dentals are little distinguished: \\(d\\) and \\(t\\) are often denoted by the same sign, and the sibilants are \\(s\\) and \\(z\\), without any of the distinctions of sound found in Aryan and Semitic speech. The labials are \\(m\\), \\(b\\) and \\(p\\). There is nothing to show if the nasal \\(ng\\) of the Turkic languages was in use, as the characters were not capable of expressing the sound, except perhaps in such words as *danga*. As a rule \\(m\\) stands when this nasal might be expected. The whole character of the phonology of the language appears to be Mongolic, and especially as regards the vowels and the vowel harmony.\n\nThe grammar of the language thus becomes an even stronger argument than the vocabulary in favour of the Mongolic theory of explanation.

Bertin, M.R.A.S., and kindly\ncriticised by Mr. T. G. Pinches, M.R.A.S., of the British\nMuseum. The disputes which have arisen as to Akkadian\nrender the Medio and the archaic dialects of Central Asia\nand Mongolia more valuable for comparison, but the in-\nvestigation of some 400 Akkadian words has led me to\nthe belief that Dr. Hommel is right in regarding Turkic\nspeech as the nearest living representative, although in\nFinnic, Hungarian, and Ugric dialects Akkadian words\nsurvive unchanged to the present day. The Medio, accord-\ning to Dr. Oppert, is also nearest to the Turkic, though\npresenting some resemblance in vocabulary to the Finnic-\nUgric dialects.\n\nINDEX OF WORDS.\n\n\\[ \\text{A} \\] \"it\" \"he,\" as in Akkadian (see ii. 80), \\( \\text{aa} \\) dative vii.\n8 (iii. 123 \"hand\"?).\n\n\\[ \\text{A} \\] \"this here,\" Turkic \\( \\text{au} \\).\n\n\\[ \\text{Ab} \\] \"house\" (iii. 93, vii. 42), Akkadian \\( \\text{ab} \\), Turkic \\( \\text{oba} \\)\n\"house\" \"home.\"\n\n\\[ \\text{Abbe} \\] (iii. 97) \"whom\" (accusat.), Medio \\( \\text{appo} \\) \"who.\"\n\n\\[ \\text{Ab zu} \\] (viii. 63) \"deep\" \"abyss,\" as in Akkadian.\n\n\\[ \\text{allali paa} \\] \"papyrus leaf,\" as in\nAkkadian (vi. 100).\n\n\\[ \\text{Aini} \\] \"well\" (viii. 2), Turkic \\( \\text{ai} \\) \"good.\"\n\n\\[ \\text{Aidan} \\] \"was\" (v. 59, vi. 100), Turkic \\( \\text{aidi} \\) \"he\nwas.\"\n\n\\[ \\text{ailan} \\] \"being\" (v. 68, 85; vi. 20, 26), Turkic\n\\( \\text{ai} \\) or \\( \\text{a} \\) \"to be.\"\n\n\\[ \\text{aiin} \\] \"it is\" (v. 63, vii. 67, xi. 44), as above.\n\n\\[ \\text{aiee} \\] (viii. 50, x. 28, 29) \"telling,\" Turkic \\( \\text{ayi} \\)\n\"to say.\"\n\n\\[ \\text{aiita} \\] (vii. 8, vii. 15) \"said\" \"told,\" as above.\nAimaniin (vii. 9; viii. 54, 59; xii. 111) \"made good\" \"thought well\" or \"preferred,\" Turkic ai \"good.\"\n\nAddu \"to name\" (vii. 12, vii. 8), Adduga \"you named\" (iv. 11); Turkic at \"name\" \"word\" and du \"to fix,\" as in Akkadian.\n\nAggus (iii. 89, v. 71, ix. 123) \"power\" or \"honor,\" Akkadian akku \"high,\" Agga \"strong\"; Turkic ak \"high\" \"mighty.\"\n\nAggudan \"by word of mouth\" (vi. 71), Turkic and Akkadian ag \"open\" \"mouth,\" gu \"word,\" dan \"by.\"\n\nAkkilan \"thought\" (viii. 70), passive part, Turkic and Akkadian ak \"intelligence.\" See Nakki.\n\nAkuusa (iii. 95) \"is adored\" or \"exalted,\" Akkadian Aka \"exalt.\"\n\nAlateas \"restore thou\" (x. 42, 43) or \"answer thou,\" Akkadian al \"back\" and te \"to deliver.\"\n\nAllan (iii. 117, x. 17), Turkic al \"take\" \"hold,\" participle.\n\nAllaman \"taken\" or \"made take,\" frequently found.\n\nAllai \"holding\" (ii. 70).\n\nAllaillian \"being held\" or \"received\" (vii. 26).

XV.\u2014The Mines of the Northern Etbai or of Northern \u00c6thiopia. With a Map, Water-colour Drawings and Photographs by the Scientific Expedition to the Northern Etbai. By Ernest A. Floyer, M.R.A.S.\n\nBy the Scientific Expedition to the Northern Etbai, despatched by his Highness the Khedive in the beginning of the year, that part of the eastern desert of Egypt which lies south of a line between Kina and Kosair and reaches rather below the twenty-fourth parallel of latitude, was rapidly examined and surveyed. The map is in the hands of the engraver of the Royal Geographical Society; the geology exhibited in a map and sections is before the Geological Society; and a map of the antiquities is attached to the present memoir. The country embraces an area of 23,000 square miles of mountain and desert, and is called by the inhabitants the Northern Etbai.\n\nIt was sought at first to trace a connection between Etbai and Etmur, the name for the broad plain of Nubian sandstone to the south. It seemed probable that Etmur might be the flat, and Etbai the mountainous country, but, while the pronunciation of the modern Abbadi inhabitant is difficult to catch, the weight of evidence shows that Etmur should be spelt \u0627\u0637\u0645\u0648\u0631, and Etbai \u0627\u064a\u062a\u0628\u0627\u064a. There is little difficulty in accepting Etbai as the derivation of \u00c6thiopia. The inhabitants of the country are strangers, who by their own account came from the south. They were met in latitude 24 N. by an immigration of the Maaza tribe, who came from Arabia probably round the head of the Suez Gulf, and with whom after many fights a boundary was agreed upon, running from\nthe Jiddama hills to Guai, a fishing village on the coast. The Maaza, an uniformly light-coloured race, speak a pure Arabic with distinct elocution. Not so the Ababdi, who are varied in form and colour, and who, to a capacity for all the Semitic gutturals, add a Nubian carelessness about the final syllable. The name Abbadi, plural Ababdi, belongs to the country and not to the people. It is probably derived from \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062f\u0652, root \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e, with a general meaning of desert and desert dwellers, and means to lie open, as a panorama.\n\nThe Abbadi loves to climb a hill and name the peaks all round the horizon. The phrases are in constant use, \"beyond that range the country is all Abbadi,\" and \"such an hill Yabdi,\" i.e. is visible, \"from that point.\" The Ababdi are not one, but many races. A straight-nosed, handsome type, with curly hair and a dashing manner, suggest that the offspring between a soldier of the Turkish garrison of Assuan and a negress or Nubian woman may have been among their ancestors. The most conspicuous type is one with straight hair and very large aquiline features. This type is a light yellow ochre in colour, and their young\u2014they are much like antelopes\u2014have beautiful skins and large brilliant eyes. A third type has a short round head and an insignificant nose. All are Ababdi, and most of them live in the Nile valley. Some fifty families live at Legeita; the same number form a suburb of Kosair; and scattered among the mountains are again some fifty families. When settled they build villages of stone or mud. But in the mountains a scanty mat over three crooked sticks suffices them, and excites the contempt of the Maaza Arabs, who dwell in Arab style in goat's-hair tents. The expression used by the village Ababdi with regard to their mountain brethren is that they are \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0652; they are hermits from the Rif. The Rif is the term for the Nile valley, just as it is for the coast of North Africa. It has curiously enough been thought of as the origin of the English word ruffian.\n\nThe mountaineers are, to a great extent, merely the herdsmen of those in the valley. In the sale of their sheep, donkeys, and camels, they are much at the mercy of the Nile dwellers.\nOn the other hand, their solitary and independent life gives them freedom and dignity of manner; while their etiquette is elaborate and their courtesy profuse but barren. They are fed by grain from the valley, and the sheep are not their own. The sub-tribe of this region are called Ash'abab \u0627\u0634\u0639\u064a\u0627\u0628, or ravine dwellers, from \u0634\u0639\u0627\u0628, a ravine; and the \"wasm,\" or mark on their camels, is the junction of two ravines\u2014Y. It appears that these Ash'abab are approaching extinction. The intermixture of blood has spoiled them for the desert solitudes; the removal of oppression and the establishment of good government in the Nile valley tempts them thither more and more. All will join in the scramble for pence from steamers, and the proudest sheikh will fleece a tourist. On the other hand, means of livelihood for the flocks are gradually being destroyed. This may be traced to the introduction of the camel, still imported in large numbers every year from Arabia. There is more truth than appears in the Arab saying that the camel drove the lion out of Palestine. He consumed the food which sustained the antelopes on which the lion preyed. An antelope, when he has nibbled what is within reach, goes elsewhere. But the camel's owner chops off the branches. And when the tree has no branches he burns it for charcoal. It is difficult to fix the date at which the camel was introduced, but it is probable that their numbers were not large, and that they did not breed in the country until the Muslim conquest.\n\nThe Beja, who inhabited the country then, had in A.D. 850 some camels of their own, that is, brought from the south, and some Arabian camels. It seems clear that the camel, aided by his owner, will drive out all plain-grazing animals except the antelope, and that the camel has thus expelled the horse, the wild ass, the cow, and the ostrich from this country, and the elephant from the country to the south. He in his turn will be expelled by the charcoal industry, although a tree which will support two sheep for a year brings as charcoal but a trifling sum.\n\nThe tracing of an Arab people by its tribal name is a futile task. A new tribe arises whenever one woman\nhas, in addition to some wealth in camels, a numerous family of vigorous healthy sons. A prodigious pride in genealogy is the surest sign that there is no foundation for it. The facts are now what they were candidly admitted to be by the Beja, that the only sure descendant is the descendant of a daughter. The women own the camels and take them with them when they marry. And families provide against oppression by hastening to send a daughter in marriage to any one near who appears to surpass in vigour and wealth, and to be likely in the future to oppress them. Thus the Mahdi received hundreds of wives.\n\nIt is, however, some contribution to the ancient history of this country which will be here attempted. It is traversed in every direction by Roman roads\u2014waggon roads, for the Ptolemies employed not camels, but rode in carts drawn by oxen. And these roads are often cleared of stones for many miles together. Some such waggon was employed as that in which Strabo journeyed from Assuan to Philae. At frequent intervals are old stations, large caravanserais for the supply of convoys, and small post houses for the fast-travelling royal scribes and mine inspectors. These latter were on the royal roads to which Euclid referred, when he told the Egyptian king \"there is no royal road to learning,\" and they may appropriately be referred to by the Persian names of Caravanserai and Chapar Khanah, for the station of Abu Gernia might change places with the Caravanserai of Chal-i-Siah without annoyance to the travellers or the architects of either country, and the scenes which were enacted at the post house of Feisoli seventeen hundred years ago may be studied to-day at the Chapar Khana of Nou Gombaz.\n\nIt is not, however, proposed to speak now of the ancient roads across this country established by Psammetichus and other vigorous ancient Egyptians\u2014roads which were post-housed by the Ptolemies and measured by the Antonines\u2014nor is it proposed to describe the quarries whither the gentle Diocletian, who reversed the r\u00f4le of Cincinnatus, sent unnumbered crowds of faithful Christians there to labour with\nan ankle seared with hot iron to prevent escape. The sparkling *lapis psaronius* of Mons Claudianus is surpassed by stone nearer home, and the still unique imperial porphyry can be bought from Mr. Brindley in London. Some account will be attempted of large mining stations not previously visited, and which are specially interesting as showing two distinct periods of mining industry. To the south of the quarries, where the country broadens out, the ridge of up-thrust which connects the peaks of Mons Porphyrites (Jebel Dukhan) with the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (Jebel Ferayeg) ploughs up the earth's crust over a length of 250 miles, and exposes to man its mineral treasures in great variety. The broken surface is honey-combed by tentative shafts and dotted by mines, and by the towns in which dwelt the men who directed their working. Here alongside of the European barracks of the Ptolemies are the hut-clusters of a vanished race, a race whom Alexander was too late to see and whom Herodotus misnamed. An interesting description of mining in *\u00c6thiopia* was written by Agatharchides about B.C. 113. This writer deplores the miseries of the miners, and wrote for a people susceptible of compassion. He drew a contrast between the wretched half-naked women who produced, and the royal voluptuaries who wore, the gold. Parallel contrasts have been drawn by those who have watched the weaving by squalid children of costly Cashmir shawls, the toil of diamond mining, or the slave-caravans of ivory. After describing the working this writer adds in free translation: \"This method is of the greatest antiquity, for the earliest kings of the place had discovered the nature of this metal. It ceased to be worked when the *\u00c6thiopians* invaded Egypt, and for many years held Egypt's towns, at which time the Memnonia were built, and again when the Medes and Persians possessed the land. Even in our time are found cutting hammers of brass, for in their time the use of iron had not become general, and human bones in incredible numbers, crushed possibly in those wide, thinly-supported galleries, so vast and deep that they reach to the very sea.\"\n\nIn this mention of human remains in the mines may\nperhaps be found a clue to the name Troglodytes, given by the ancients to the people of this land.\n\nIt is difficult to explain cave-dwellers in this country otherwise than as mine-dwellers.\n\nThe old geographers were often strikingly exact in summing up in one word the characteristics of a race. The name Ithyophagi, given by Alexander's generals, bold travellers and accurate describers, to the men of Mekran, is an instance. Any one who has voyaged along that coast during the mat\u016bt season will recognize this. For miles along the sandy shore are spread to dry millions of little fish like whitebait, called mat\u016bt. They are dried like hay, and made into stacks like hay. Poultry and donkeys are fed upon them; camels will break away at scent of them. It is a veritable harvest scene. The air is thick with gulls, which are caught in simple traps by the urchins who act as bird-scarers, and let fly to die of starvation with a quill feather twisted round their beak. Inland, the first eager question to a traveller is, \"Have you fish for sale?\" The date harvest is for the rich, and precarious, for they must often fight to reap it. The fish harvest is for all, and sure.\n\nThe name Icthyophagi sums up this people in one word, and it was probably given by the Greeks.\n\nThe derivation of Mekran from Mahi Khuran, fish eaters, is not convincing. No Mekrani or Baluch would slur over the ah of Mahi, nor would he change the kh \u0121 into \u0121. Nor does a race describe itself by its principal food, though, like the Baggara of the Sudan, it derives it from its principal occupation. Thus it may be concluded that the name Troglodytes had application. But throughout the country there are no caves, except at Kosair, where the exception is emphasized by the name \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd, descriptive of the white limestone; the metamorphic or granite rocks approach close to the sea. There are no caves of any sort, except such as have been made in search of gold and precious stones.\n\nIt would seem that Troglodytes may best be translated by miners.\nLinant de Bellefonds, who examined the country south of Assouan and Berenice as far as Korosko, describes the geological formation as similar to that of the Northern Etbai. Herodotus was probably the first to use the term Troglodytes, and it is interesting to note that he wrote before the Ptolemies re-opened the mines. Thus he was writing of a people known only by tradition, or at most by hearsay.\n\nThe Ptolemaic miners employed methods of great antiquity, and this may indicate that there was never any long total interruption of mining. The trade secrets how to fuse the ore were never lost. It is known that in one year the mines brought Thothmes 2400 lbs. of gold, or \u00a3137,000 in the value of to-day. Later again, in the time of Ramses the Great, 1200 B.C., work at the mines was very briskly pushed forward, though the great well recorded in the inscriptions was dug for the mines of Allaki, then called Akita, and attention was principally directed to the country south of that now under description. And it is possible that the miners of Ramses also used methods of great antiquity, for there are distinct and very interesting traces of Phoenician occupation of this land, whence they may have diverged, some to the Mediterranean and some to Zimbaye, where Mr. Theodore Bent is discovering traces of their presence. In the country limited, as described in the opening of this paper, there are four main drainage systems from the mountains to the Nile. Below Assuan is the Wadi Allaki, described by Agatharchides as containing gold mines, a long valley having its source in the lofty mountains of Elba, stored with myth and legend, and close to the Red Sea. North of this is the Khareit, springing from the mountains of Berenice. North again is the Wadi Abbad, in which stands a rock temple bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions to the effect that Sethos, father of Ramses the Great, had built a cistern and had discovered gold mines with the eye of a hawk. Golenischeff considers that the actual temple was built by the Ptolemies. North of the Wadi Abbad is the Wadi Zeidun, which springs from the Sabai mountains, and enters the Nile between Kos and Luxor. A great interest centres round this Wadi Zeidun.\nIt does not stand alone as a Phoenician name. The valley which springs from the emerald mines is the Wadi Ghadira, Ghadira being the Ph\u0153nician word for enclosure, and the same as Cadiz.\n\nThere was probably a fort or settlement at the mouth of the Wadi Ghadira. And there was probably a fort or settlement called Zeidun between Kos and Thebes, perhaps on the site of the modern Koft, which means Ph\u0153nician, perhaps at the Arab village of Legaita. What vigour to his pen this fact would have afforded Strabo when writing his earnest vindication of Homer's geographical knowledge.\n\n\u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f08\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2, \u1f08\u03b9\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b8' \u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f18\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u039b\u03b9\u03b2\u03cd\u03b7\u03bd\u2014Having wandered to Cyprus Ph\u0153nice and the Egyptians, I came to the \u00c6thiopians and Sidonians, and Erembi and Libya.\u2014Odyssey, Lib. iv. 83.\n\nThese are the lines which formed Strabo's great stumbling-block. Modern scholars have thought that the reference was to an \u00c6thiopian colony in Palestine in order to explain the juxtaposition with the Sidonians. But it is not fanciful to suppose that the Tyre and Sidon of the Mediterranean were repetitions of Tor on the Red Sea and Sidon on the Nile, and that Homer referred to the Sidonians near \u00c6thiopia, south of Egypt. There is much evidence to show that no European had entered Egypt until long after Homer's death. Yet Homer's mention of Thebes instead of Memphis is curious. There is no difficulty in identifying Erembi with Blemmye, when it is remembered that Sulpicius of Aquitaine wrote the latter \"Blembi,\" and both probably used Sabaia spears made from the iron of the Sabai mountains, whence the Wadi Zeidun takes its rise. It is hoped that this matter will interest men more learned than the writer, and that some small addition may be made to our knowledge of the Ph\u0153nicians. That the Ptolemaic miners used mining methods of great antiquity is known from their historians. Nor is there anything known incompatible with the supposition that the miners of Ramses employed mining methods handed down to them by an older race.\nIt is to be regretted that while the quarries in the north and at or near Assuan (their position was of course dictated by the geological formation) are all dated by inscriptions, only two of the mines tell any part of their story in writing.\n\nQuarrying and stonemasonry were the employment of noblemen, who used the best tools obtainable and rejoiced in their task.\n\nGold-mining was done by miserable slaves driven by cruel taskmasters, and the gold was only esteemed when it adorned a king. At the mines of Sighdit is an hieroglyphic inscription recording without date the visit of a royal scribe and a mine inspector, and at the emerald mines of Sikait, called by the Arabic historians Kharbe, or Gharbe, are Greek dedications over the rock-cut temples. Thus, in support of the statements that the mines are of two epochs, there is only the appearance of the buildings. It seems very clear that the Ptolemies, after studying all the existing mines, established workmen at selected spots. Here they built temples, caravanserais, houses for the overseers, and barracks for the workmen. Not far from these stations are found the remains of hundreds of stone huts of irregular outline. These stone huts are distinguished from the modern Abbadi huts, first by a uniform irregularity of outline, and secondly by their better construction. Not always, but generally, there is this difference. The walls of an old hut are built of two lines of large stone; the space between is closely filled by splinters. \"Great without small makes a bad wall\" observed the Greeks, and the Ptolemaic walls are constructed with the same precaution as the older huts. An Abbadi uses mud, mat, or rags to stop the crevices in a wall of a single line of stones.\n\nThe reasons for attributing these modern towns to the Ptolemies are not conclusive, in fact not much has been done hitherto beyond finding the mines, fixing them with some accuracy on the map, and copying all inscriptions that could be found. But the buildings are of distinctly European construction.\n\nThe quarries of Mons Porphyrites are dated by the in-\nscription on a temple partly erected in Trajan's time. At Mons Claudianus, on the architrave of the temple, is read \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6, the comma indicating \u1f00\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 broken off. In the Wadi Abbad the temple bears inscriptions dating from the father of Rameses the Great. But Golenischeff ascribes its construction to the Ptolemies. The quarries in Hammamat bear dates from 2500 B.C. down to Ptolemaic times. The figures copied by Schweinfurth in the Wadi Jasus date from Psammetichus, but, excepting at Hammamat, at none of these places are there mines. Hitherto indications of date have been found at none of the mines. The mines of Sighdit, in lat. N. 25\u00b0-28\u00b0 and long. E. 34\u00b05', are best approached from the Nile by following the Wadi Abbad, past the rock temple and into the Wadi Miah, and thence up the Wadi Sighdit. High up on the face of a steep rock, overhanging a copious well of sweet water, is scratched faintly the following inscription, copied several times in varying sunlights:\n\nThis is the inscription referred to above, which appears to record the visit of a royal scribe and a superintendent of the mines. More cannot be said until one learned in hieroglyphics goes and reads it in situ. The country round is what is called by the Abbadi a \"ginna.\" The Abbadi are intelligent geographers, and indeed geologists so far as naming seven different rocks. Unlike the Greeks, who used \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\nGENERAL PLAN OF THE MINES OF UM ELEAGHA.\n\nY. Zekehian, Artist Scien. Exp. Northern Etbal.\nMINES OF UM ELEAGHA. TYPE OF HOUSE AND PLAN.\n\nY. Zehehian, Artist Scien. Exp. Northern Etbal.\nfor both, they employ different words for quartz and limestone. What they call a \"ginna\" is an area of cushion-shaped or mammillated hills of metamorphic rock. It is in such places that, near the Wadi Khashab, topazes are searched for. Near the well, clustered along each side of the valley, and climbing up each ravine, are some five or six hundred small stone huts. About three miles to the west is the \"robat,\" or square enclosure of a caravanserai, the raised platform of a temple, and numerous square European-looking houses. All are in absolute ruin. The vein worked is above the caravanserai. Here it seems probable that the western station was built long after that on the wells. The former looks comparatively modern against the latter. And the supposition that the masters lived in the west, while the workmen lived on the well, is met by showing the danger the masters would run of being cut off from water.\n\nGoing south are found, in the broad Wadi Hamesh which forms part of the drainage system of the Khareit, the Hamesh mines in lat. N. 24\u00b040' and long. E. 34\u00b010'. Here the remains are purely European. There are no small huts, and yet the excavation made represents many thousands of tons of rock removed. The work is scientific compared with the burrows at Um Roos. Pillars of ore are left to support the roof, and the quartz, which lies in heaps about the mouth of the mines, has a burnt appearance, and is very brittle to the hammer. Though every house was examined and potsherds innumerable were scrutinized, no vestige of inscription was discovered.\n\nThe large mining district in lat. N. 25\u00b027' and long. E. 34\u00b035', near the mouth of the Wadi Imbarek, is clearly either \\(\\nu\\chi\\epsilon\\sigma\\alpha\\) or what led to the construction of the Port of \\(\\nu\\chi\\epsilon\\sigma\\alpha\\), placed by Ptolemy in lat. 25\u00b030'. The town is distant only five miles from the sea. On the coast no ruins were observed. But after the difficulty experienced in finding the ruins of Berenice, great caution must be used in stating that no ruins exist on the sandy sea coast where every erection invites the burying sand-drifts. Here at a place now called Um Roos, over a space of some five square miles the surface quartz veins have been burrowed away by a people who lived\nin hundreds of stone huts, of which the plan is almost uniformly that given below.\n\nCommandingly placed in the valley is the modern Greek town, of which some 300 ruined houses remain. One of the shafts here is remarkable. A thick vein has been cut away, making a broad low cave, sloping steeply to a depth of about 100 feet, where is a large pool of crystal water... This has the reputation of causing those who drink it to swell up. But it supplies a fishing village, and the number of huge shells used for filling waterskins which strew the edges of the pool may form a topic for the geologist of the future.\n\nThe name of this place, Um Roos, has probably given rise to the name Jebel Russa, mountain of lead, which has long appeared on the map, but of which I could hear nothing. In the general Arabicising of the old Hamitic names, I think the Hamitic \"yam,\" \"water,\" has often been changed to the Arabic \"um,\" \"mother of.\" Though I do not yet know the meaning of Roos, I think the name Hamitic, and that it makes reference to the very singular water supply.\n\nIt was while studying the extensive but crude mining near the stone huts of Um Roos that the following theory suggested itself. It would seem probable that the Etbai was formerly peopled by a tribe of natural miners\u2014a negroid tribe, perhaps the ancestors of those who now inhabit the mountains in the south of Kordofan, who work the copper mines Hofrat an Nahas; who forged the spears with which the Mahdi's followers were armed, and who, untouched by fanaticism, were the last to defend the Austrian missionaries, and the first to stem the flood of the Muslim revival. All the mountain summits of Durfur are peopled by a race of metal workers, who do not intermarry with the Arabs, who wander\nin the valleys hunting ostriches and collecting gum. But the wanderers and the miners are necessary to each other. For the latter is, from the nature of his occupation, stationary, and, where agriculture is impossible, is dependent on the nomad Arabs both for his supplies and for the realization of his mining products. This dual occupation may explain why the so-called Troglodytes and the pastoral Blemmyes are described as inhabiting the same country.\n\nTo these negroid miners came the Phoenicians seeking trade. Something drove them south; perhaps oppression by the Egyptians. Sennaar was peopled by Egyptians, or by Ethiopians, if the derivation Essi-n-arti, river island, be accepted, who left Egypt in the reign of Psammetichus. Or perhaps the mines became exhausted. Or perhaps, again, the greater profit in the transport on the Nile\u2014Red Sea trade routes called away the nomad Blemmyes.\n\nThe adventurous spirit of the naval Phoenicians when once they reached the Nile would carry them on to the west. Trade and not mining seems to have been their characteristic. It was at the mines of Um Roos that I first observed a kind of mining apparatus which has not been described. There lay near the town a large heap of long, heavy, hollow stones, each one a section of a massive granite cylinder. And it seems that here we have the original of a word which has hitherto had a doubtful meaning.\n\nA somewhat detailed account of the gold-mining process employed in these mines is given by Agatharchides, from whom, as quoted by Photius, Diodorus Siculus, and probably all other ancient writers on Ethiopia, have copied more or less exactly. The following passages are freely translated from M\u00fcller's text. Near the Red Sea are places where are found plentifully metal-bearing rocks, which are called gold-bearing. They are intensely black, but among them is produced a quartz than which nothing can be whiter. Such as are ruined in fortune are led by kings into the most bitter slavery of the gold-diggings, some with their wives and children. Some without these bear their labours, which the author (Agatharchides) describes as the greatest calamity,\nand he thus sets forth the way in which gold is found. Of these mountains those which are rugged and have an altogether hard nature they burn with wood. And when they are softened by fire they experiment on them and cut the loosened stones into small pieces with an iron chisel. But the principal work is that of the artificer who is skilled in stones. This man shows to the diggers the track of the metal, and apportions the whole work to the needs of the wretched men in the following manner. Those whole in strength and age break the places where shines the quartz with iron cutting hammers. They use not skill, but brute force, and thus they drive in the rock many galleries, not straight, but branching in all directions like the roots of a tree wherever the stone pregnant with gold may diverge. These men thus with candles bound on their foreheads cut the rock, the white stone shewing the direction for their labours. Placing their bodies in every conceivable position, they throw the fragments on the ground, not each one according to his strength, but under the eye of the overseer, who never ceases from blows. Then boys, creeping into the galleries dug by these men, collect with great labour the stones that have been broken off, and carry them out to the mouth of the mine. Next from these a crowd of old and sickly men take the stone and lay it before the pounders. These are strong men of some thirty years of age, and they strenuously pound the rock with an iron pestle in mortars cut out of stone, and reduce it until the largest piece is no bigger than a pea. Then they measure out to others the pounded stone in the same quantity as they have received it. The next task is performed by women, who alone or with their husbands or relations are placed in enclosures. Several mills are placed together in a line, and standing three together at one handle, filthy and almost naked, the women lay to at the mills until the measure handed to them is completely reduced, and to every one of these who bear this lot death is better than life. Others called Selangeus take from the women the powder thus produced. These are the artificers, in whom lies the power of carrying to the end this work of royal utility.\nThe method is as follows. They pour the quartz already milled on a table rather broad and polished, with a smooth surface, which however does not lie flat but has a slight inclination. On this table they rub with their hands the dust mixed with water, first lightly, and then with greater pressure. By this I imagine the earthy particles are dissolved and flow down the slope of the table, but that which is heavy and worth anything remains on the wood. And when the Selangeus has frequently rinsed the matter out with water, he handles the quartz dust lightly with soft thick sponges, and pressing lightly from time to time he absorbs from the table and throws away that which is soft and light entangled in the web of the sponge. There remains to him separated on the table that which is heavy and shines, and which on account of its weight is not easily movable. In this way the Selangeus, after he has cleansed the grains of gold, transmits it to the cooks, who, immediately they receive it by weight, put it into a clay pot, and in proportion to its quantity they add a lump of lead, grains of salt, a little alloy of silver and lead, and barley bran. The pot's mouth being carefully covered and luted round, they cook it five days and five nights consecutively. On the following day, when the burnt materials are cooled, they pour them into another vase. They find none of the things which were put in together, but only a mass of molten gold, but little less than the original matter.\n\nThis passage has been carefully examined, to see if it was written by an eye witness or not. The words \"I imagine,\" if they are in the original of Agatharchides, indicate that it was written from hearsay; though this evidence is inconclusive, still the probability is great that the writer had no personal knowledge of the matter under description. The word for table in the original Greek of Photius is \u03c3\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03be; thus, when the Selangeus is using the sponges, \"\u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9,\" and the Selangeus is \"\u1f41 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2.\" M\u00fcller suggests that the Selangeus was he who worked at the Serangx, and there is no difficulty in accepting the connection between the two words.\nThe table, so far as it is described, is referred to as follows: \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03be\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f10\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u1fc7 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u1fb3 \u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03c5\u1fd6\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u1f70\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.\" And again, after the washing, \"\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6.\" The word \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c2 appears to have meant invariably something wooden, while \u03c3\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03be means a hollowed stone. In an old Greek lexicon penes Mr. Butler, of Brasenose, the word is given \"a word of doubtful import, a hollow stone.\"\n\nIt is necessary to choose between a wooden and a stone table. With only the text in hand \u03c3\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03be takes preference over \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c2. Admitting the connection with \u03c3\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, the workman implies the tool. While \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c2 is a general word of wide application, \u03c3\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03be is a special name for a special implement. One hearing of a \u03c3\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03be would ask for a description, and receive the general term \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1. Against a wooden table may be urged that the country could not produce a broad slab, that if one were imported it would split and warp.\n\nLying about the mines are three kinds of stone implements. First there are mortars made of granite; a common stone for these is the lapis psaronius, or \"starling granite,\" identified by Brindley as coming from the Mons Claudianus. Second, a flattish rounded irregular stone some eighteen inches broad by ten thick, smoothed on all sides by attrition. There are some hundreds of these in large heaps at the mines in the Wadi Imbarik at Um Roos. Their use cannot be satisfactorily explained. Third, a stone of which a sketch is given.\n\nA hollow stone, part section of a cylinder, scored across the hollow surface by light chiselled lines.\nThis is probably the \u03c3\u1fc6\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03be referred to by Agatharchides. It is a hollowed stone, the first meaning of \u03c3\u1fc6\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03be, and it would well serve the purpose of the table for gold-washing. It would be interesting to trace the word back to some language older than the Greek.\n\nIt was most disappointing that beyond an occasional scratch on a broken water-vessel, no writing of any sort could be found at Um Roos.\n\nThe mines of Um Elaigher, name derived from the shrub Vigna Nilotica, extend over a wide undulating plain at the foot of the great ridge Abu Dhaher.\n\nHere are evidences of two periods of working. The surface quartz has been burrowed out, and in the middle of some two hundred perpendicular shafts are the remains of a well-built settlement, very like the settlement at the quarries of Mons Claudianus. Roughly square in outline, it contains some 300 rooms, with a space in the centre where formerly stood a temple or place of assembly. It is not clear what was sought for in the pits. One shaft is driven a considerable distance in a hard, green granite. A plastered building was reported to exist here, but was not found, and remains to exhibit to some future explorer perhaps an inscription which will throw a flood of light upon this very curious mining district.\n\nThe quartz was worked for gold. But the mineral sought when sinking the small vertical shafts could not be guessed at. The drawings give almost all that could be learned about these mines.\n\nOf the topaz diggings near Wadi Khashab in lat. N. 24\u00b018' and long. E. 31\u00b028' but little need be said. All the \"ginna\" hills of a soft, close-grained metamorphic rock look as if they have been ploughed. Every boulder has been turned over, and exposes an unweathered surface. This has a curious effect, for it is a feature of these rocks that they all weather a rich brown colour, though they are inside of a rich green matrix containing angular yellow blocks.\n\nThe old method of searching for topazes as described by Photius is curious as indicating the scarcity of metal tools,\nwhich were owned only by the great men. The people searched at night, for the stone was lustrous only in the dark, and on finding a stone they placed over it a \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03c2 (conf. the skep of Lincolnshire) proportioned in size to the lustre. In the day workmen came and, cutting round the rim of the \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03c2, removed the stone. To-day the Ababdi hunt for the topazes by turning over the stones.\n\nThe most interesting mines in the whole district are the emerald mines, which supplied the Cleopatras with jewels. One is mentioned as presented to Lathyrus, engraved with Cleopatra's portrait.\n\nIdrisi, the geographer, after referring to the gold mines of Allaki, writes as follows: \"Not far from the town of Assuan on the east bank of the Nile is another mountain, in the roots of which is a mine of emeralds. Nor is there found in the whole world a mine other than this one, which is indeed crowded with miners. And from hence the emeralds are distributed over the whole world.\"\n\nSir John Chardin writes of Egypt as \"a country of fair emeralds,\" and it is probable that until the conquest of Peru in 1524 these were the only mines known, though occasional emeralds were brought from India.\n\nThe Jebel Zabara, as the emerald mines are now called, are a mass of green talcose schist, with veins of talc and quartz. They are some 1200 feet high, and spread over an area of some forty square miles. Both north and south sides have been attacked, and the mass is honey-combed with holes, from each of which streams a shining talus of mica particles. The hills have much the appearance of a great rabbit-warren. There are two main centres of activity; that on the south flank, whence springs the Wadi Sikait to join the Wadi Jemal, and that on the north, whence springs the Wadi Ghadir already referred to as possibly a Phoenician name. Here no pre-Ptolemaic remains were found, though in the rugged mountainous area they may easily have existed unobserved. The Wadi Sikait seems to have been longest occupied. Here are three rock temples hewn in the soft rock in very ruinous condition. Of one the three portals bear an inscription.\npublished in the *Atheneum* of the 8th of August, 1891, and, though long studied by Canon Wright, of Coningsby, indecipherable save for the dedication of the temple to Apollo and all the gods, and a mention of Berenice, which may refer either to a queen or the port 50 miles off. Later apparently than these and more costly in erection is a fine building of dry stone, of good proportion and imposingly placed on a rock jutting from the valley side. To this led up a handsome flight of steps. The stones are naturally squared. There is no roof to the body of the building, but the apsis is roofed with long shining slabs of schist, which look like beams of wood petrified. The body is filled with tumbled slabs. From the platform before the door a view is obtained of the watch towers perched on the hills where are the principal shafts. I have used the word apsis, for I believe the building to have been a church. The side window, the absence of portico, the niches in the wall, and the apse all suggest a church. Yet on this point I am not able to say more than that during the long periods of Christianity in the third and fourth centuries the mines were steadily worked, and that it would be as natural to look for a church here as for a temple built during the Pagan Greek occupation. Until 1358 the mines were worked by the Egyptians, who had here a staff of clerks and overseers. No remains however of their occupation were found. The houses of the Wadi Sikait are of European construction, and the non-discovery of modern Egyptian remains makes it impossible to say that pre-Ptolemaic remains might not be found on further search. The area of mountain and valley to be searched is immense, and no one central water supply was found round which all miners would be compelled to congregate.\n\nSome ten miles to the north, where the many small affluents of the Wadi Ghadira spring from the foot of the mountain, are the broad deep shafts of the Albanian miners who worked under Cailliaud in Muhammad Ali\u2019s time. Here, however, nothing was found older than the nineteenth century. Yet it is probable that by following the Wadi Ghadira to the sea some interesting discoveries might be made. One, if not two, of\nthe watch towers on the hills seemed placed especially to look out over the sea, which is only some 25 miles distant. Some port would probably be found. For except Berenice, which is sheltered by a natural promontory, the ports of the Red Sea are opposite valleys which at once form a road into the interior, afford water, pasture, and firewood, and at the same time make a gap in the coral reef which lines the coast. For the coral insect dies under or avoids the fresh water which the valley from time to time carries into the sea.\n\nThe country examined by the late Expedition extends south only so far as lat. 23\u00b030'. The map thus overlaps that of Bellefonds, engraved by the French War Office in 1852 from observations made in 1831\u20132.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the portion contained in both maps shows very wide differences. Accuracy must be adjudged to the newer map, constructed on many astronomical observations and plane-table bearings. Example may be taken of the \u03c0\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f44\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, which Bellefonds places in lat. 23. The new map and the Admiralty chart place these hills in 23\u00b030'. As a piece of geography this country must be done over again. But the map has a value as indicating the names of some twenty mines. Here are the mines of Allaki, described by Diodorus, and here are the mines for which that astonishing character Abderrahman el Omary fought and intrigued with the Christian kings to the south for thirty years of bloodshed and treachery.\n\nIn the history of gold-mining there can be no more astonishing episode than this of the ninth century, ending in the assassination by his own slaves of the bloody-handed adventurer. Towards the end of his career, when he had made a solitude and called it peace, 60,000 camels carried to his workmen provisions from Assuan. And this supply was exclusive of supplies of wheat received by way of Aidab in such quantities that Tulun, the ruler of Egypt, sought to stop the export from Suez, and only removed the prohibition from fear of El Omary\u2019s 100,000 men.\n\nIt was thought that this ancient port of Aidab had at last been definitely placed on the map.\nGreat interest attaches to the port of Aidab, which has been placed by Arab geographers both in Abyssinia and Egypt. Jeddah, now for 400 years, has been the pilgrims' door to Mecca. The corresponding route from Egypt was from Kos to Aidab, and from 1060 to 1260 these towns throve. Aidab was thought to be one-and-a-half day's sail from Jeddah. Yet with such ample indications it has never been found. Purday in 1878 approaching from the north marked a native town in ruins. But it was near Berenice, and he regarded it as a village in some way connected with that town.\n\nIn 1891 in the same neighbourhood I marked a Jebel Aidab, and thought the ruins must be those of Aidab town. But a further examination shows that the coast from here to Massowa has many mountains Aidab, which indeed may well be a word meaning \"mountain\" and connected with the \"ida\" of Morocco. The town of Aidab cannot therefore yet be placed with certainty.\n\nIn summing up the above notes there seems nothing known in contradiction of the following.\n\nMinerals seem to have been always sought after by the early rulers of Egypt. The first mines worked were those of the Wadi Mughara in the Sinai peninsular by Senoferu, towards the end of the third or beginning of the fourth dynasty.\n\nThe earliest inscriptions in the mines and quarries of Hammamat date from the fifth dynasty. It may be presumed that as the third dynasty inscriptions have been preserved at Wadi Maghara, they would have also been preserved at Hammamat had the latter mines then been known. It is curious that the more distant mines should have been the earlier worked. Possibly those of Sinai were on a trade route older than that of Koptos. Possibly the Egyptians had known them on their march from Asia. Possibly the desert which was called the land of the gods was regarded with fear and distrust.\n\nHammamat bears inscriptions of the 5th, 6th, and onwards up to Ptolemaic times. The earliest paintings represent the first Egyptians as brown men and yellow women. This was remembered when we interviewed an old and very striking\nAbbadi whose harim were yellow and whose lofty stature and massive features were reproduced in small in a family of most handsome yellow children. The children were noteworthy for the beauty of their skin and the brilliancy of their eyes.\n\nLater the Egyptians become of a darker colour. It seems probable that they found the Nile valley inhabited when they arrived, and that they intermarried with the aboriginals, who were of a dark brown.\n\nSuch seem to have been the \u00c6thiopians. It is not placing on etymology more than it will bear to say that the resemblance of the \u00c6thiopian kings' names to modern Berber words indicates that the \u00c6thiopians were the Berbers of to-day. The \u00c6thiopians must be then regarded as a strictly riparian race. And it must be remembered that between the cultivated Nile border and the mountain pasture valleys and metal mountains is a belt of waterless desert with an average width of two days' journey. Life in the Nile valley is no preparation for crossing such a belt.\n\nA third distinct race were the men of Kush. These were immigrants who entered Africa near Massowa and Suakin. Of their descendants are the Beja, and of the Beja are the Bishari of to-day. They have an instinctive horror of a mine or of entering a cave.\n\nAs a question of probability, we may dismiss as the pre-Ptolemaic miners the \u00c6thiopians and the Kushites. The ancient Egyptians would have left inscriptions, as at Wadi Maghara and at Hamamat.\n\nBut only at Sighdit is found an hieroglyphic inscription. This one might judge to be Ptolemaic, and to belong to the more recent buildings. It is merely scratched on the rock, and is by no means the permanent and pompous record of an ancient Egyptian monarch. The mines of the country of the Wawat seem to be identical with those of Allaki, in the country now called the country of the Babs. This country had in the ninth century of our era a king to whom the Christian kings of Dongola and Suria (Khartum) sometimes fled for refuge, and this king became the Sheikh el Jebel,\nwhich seems to give the origin of the \"old man of the mountain.\" But the people of the Wawa were Kushites, Blemmyes, Beja.\n\nThere is much that points to an aboriginal mining race preceding or contemporaneous with, but unknown to, the ancient Egyptians. The clusters of little stone cottages were not inhabited by overseers, nor were they built for or by slaves and captives, with whose misery the language of 2000 years ago excites our sympathy. Herodotus heard that the country was inhabited by Blemmyes and Troglodytes. And the analogy with the dual occupation of Darfur seems the most probable explanation of the ancient mining towns and ancient mining methods which have been referred to.\nART. XVI.\u2014On Hiuen-Tsang instead of Yuan Chwang, and the necessity of avoiding the Pekinese sounds in the quotations of ancient proper names in Chinese.

The reasons which induce me to preserve the spelling Hiuen-Tsang instead of adopting the newly-proposed Yuan Chwang\u00b9 are that the latter is erroneous and without any standing whatever, while the other, besides its long acceptance by European scholars, is more true to history.\n\n\u00b9 Yuan chwang or Hiouen Thsang? By T. W. Rhys Davids, above pp. 377-379. [The learned writer has not quite understood the point I intended to raise in my letter. No two of the six European writers (all of them well-known writers on Chinese subjects) quoted in the letter agree in their method of representing in English letters the pronunciation of a name that has to be constantly used by Indianists. How then are they to pronounce it? As a first step I ascertained by the method set out in the letter, that the modern pronunciation of any ordinary person in Pekin of the second of the two sets of characters used in China for the pilgrim's name would be represented (in the transliteration used by Indianists) by Yuan Chwang. I expressed no opinion as to whether that pronunciation was erroneous or not, and distinctly reserved the further (and very important) questions as to what the pronunciation 'may have been elsewhere and in the pilgrim's time.' The sole object of the letter was to elicit the opinion of others competent to speak on those points.\u2014Rh. D.]\nWe are told in the notice on the subject in the *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society* of last April, that the name of the illustrious pilgrim to India appears to have been written \u7384\u5958 (Hiuen Tsang\\(^1\\)) and \u5143\u5958 (Yuen Tsang), but the cause of this difference is not explained. As it is important in the discussion, let us see briefly in what it consists.\n\n2. It has long been customary in China to consider as tabu-ed the personal names of the sovereigns of the reigning dynasty.\\(^2\\) \u201cSo soon as a dynastic change has been effected, the Tabu, which has previously been in force, is removed, and thus at the present time only the personal names of the reigning Mandshu house are unwritable.\u201d\\(^3\\) Other characters near in sound but not fully homophonous were often employed instead of those temporarily disused. The practice is gradually becoming quaint and before long will be obsolete; for instance, when Tsung Hien, whose reign was styled Yung Tcheng, came to the throne (A.D. 1723\u20131735), his personal name was \u9806\u8208 Yn-tchen, \u2018Inherited blessings,\u2019 and to express the same ideas, his subjects were directed to write \u5141\u798e Yun-tching, \u2018Permitted felicity.\u2019 But when the reigning emperor, whose nien hao is Kwang-si\u00fc, began his reign, the symbols of his personal name, \u8521\u6cbb\u6d3b Tsai Tien, remained in use, with the sole exception that the bottom line of the second character was dropped \u6d3b.\n\n3. Now during the present dynasty a large part of the ancient literature has been re-edited and printed with due observance of this superstition, until recent years. For the unaware readers this might produce the most ludicrous effects and confusions. Let us take as an example a learned work\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hiuen Tsang or Hiouen Tsang in French. Sir Thomas Wade himself is quoted in the above paper as preferring Hiouen to hiouan or yuan. Morrison wrote Heuen Tsang (with the first e for i); Edkins writes Hiuen Tsang.\n\n\\(^2\\) The following works contain interesting information on the subject:\u2014Lin-hia, *Sin lun*, kiv. 6 (a special paper written by a Chinese author of the Vith cent.). Hilderic Friend, *Euphemism and Tabu in China*, Folklore Record, 1881, vol. i, pp. 71\u201391. R. K. Douglas, *On Tabu-ed Characters*, Chinese Manual, 1889, pp. 372\u2013376. T. de L., *Babylonian and Oriental Record*, 1889, vol. iii, p. 219; *Catalogue of Chinese Coins from the VIth Cent. B.C. to A.D 621, Including the Series in the British Museum*, 1892, p. xxxvi.\n\n\\(^3\\) R. K. Douglas, *I.e.*\non numismatics, the *Tsuen she* \u6cc9 \u621f, in sixteen books, published in 1833, which I happen to have on my table. The author claims to reproduce in *fac-simile* the coins he describes. We remark that *Shun \u6df3* (personal name of the last emperor and altered into \u6df3), is reproduced without alteration; it shows that the author wrote before 1862. But the legends, \u6e05 \u5b81 \u901a \u5bf6 *Tsing ning tung pao*, issued in 1055\u20131065, \u5f18 \u6cbb \u901a \u5bf6 *Hung tche tung pao*, issued in 1503, are reproduced as \u6e05 \u5b81 \u901a \u5bf6 and \u5f18 \u6cbb \u901a \u5bf6, because *Ning* \u5b81 and *Hung* \u5f18 were the personal names of Siuan Tsung (*Tao Kwang*) and Kao Tsung (*Kien lung*) of the present dynasty, contemporarily and before the author's time.\n\n4. Applied to the reproduction of proper names of ancient times, in the new editions of olden texts, the results are disastrous. Let us come nearer the object of the present note. When Sheng Tsu (*K'anghi*) ascended the throne in 1662, one of his personal names was \u7384 *Hiuen*; henceforth the symbol was altered into \u5143, but more commonly substituted altogether by \u5143 *Yuen*.\n\n*Tcheng* \u912d \u5143, a famous commentator of the Han period, was henceforth quoted as *Tcheng Yuen* \u912d \u5143, and became liable to confusion with a writer of the latter name of the Yuen dynasty.\n\nIn reprinting the Buddhist Records, wherever a *Hiuen* \u7384 occurred, an *Yuen* \u5143 was reprinted in its place. *Hiuen tchiu*, *Hiuen T'ai*, *Hiuen Hao*, etc., all Buddhist pilgrims, who went from or through China to India in the seventh century, were reprinted *Yuen Tchiu*, *Yuen T'ai*, *Yuen Hao*, etc.\n\nThe name of the great pilgrim Hiuen Tsang \u7384\u5958 did not escape the fate of the others. Previously to the K'ang-hi\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. *Tsuen She*, kiv. 9, f. 23; 10, f. 3; 12, f. 8.\n2 I always write *tch* for English *ch*, because of the confusion otherwise possible with the French *ch* (=sh) and the German *ch* (=x).\nreign, it had never been written with an \u5143 Yuen, as shown by the ancient editions of the Buddhist records, the ancient dictionaries, and the K'ang hi tze tien itself.\n\n5. Therefore spelling Yuan or Yuen the name Hiuen of the pilgrim would be unscholarly and give way to a temporary superstition, which as far as we know may have disappeared within a few years hence. Not a few modern scholars have ceased to pay attention to it with reference to ancient proper names.\n\nShould any of my readers select to write the name of Hiuen Tsang in modern Pekinese according to the convenient Wade transliteration, it is not Yuan Chwang which he must write, but Hs\u00fcan Chwang.\n\n6. The sounds of modern Pekinese are much debased and entirely unfit for the quotation of ancient Chinese names without the characters in European literature. The number of distinct syllables, once available for the transliteration of foreign proper names, has dwindled down considerably, and the effect of this shrinking of material is also troublesome for the native names in history. Let those who favour the use of Pekinese, in quotations of ancient literature, attempt to read thus an ancient transliteration of Buddhist words. We have already enough difficulties to overcome in Chinese researches without increasing them with the Pekinese corruptions.\n\n7. For instance, the name of A\u00e7oka was transcribed \u963f\u80b2 A-y\u00fc, which would have been rather wide of the mark, and without raison d'\u00eatre. In the ancient Mandarin represented by our dictionaries, instead of y\u00fc, we find y\u00fch (cf. Basile, Medhurst, Wells Williams, etc.). The final -h shows that a consonant at the end was fading away; we recover it in the dialectal pronunciation yok, of Canton, Amoy, Shanghai, etc. With A-yok we are already one step nearer of the original pattern. Now, if we refer to the most archaic of the Chinese dialectical sounds, those of the Sinico-Annamite,\n\n1 Cf. K'ang hi tze tien, s. v. \u8208.\n2 On some doubts about chwang, cf. infr\u00e0 note.\nwhich branched off 200 B.C., we see that the ancient sound of y\u016bh was dzuk. Therefore the name of A\u00e7oka was transcribed A-dzuk, and should we not know the antecedent of the Chinese transcription, we might have easily recognized it in A-dzuk, but not in the Pekinese A-y\u016b.\n\nOf course I will admit that this is an exceptional case, and that giving up Pekinese would not have led us farther than A-y\u016bh, but there the survival of a final was suggestive of a further enquiry. We cannot expect to be able to drive home Chinese transcriptions in every case, but we may ask not to be compelled to accept as usual renderings sounds which are emaciated, and take us far away of any possible identification.\n\n8. For instance, the modern Pekinese chi (tchi) conceals the ancient Mandarin kih, ki, tsih, tsi, tchih, and tchi, which themselves recover the former kik, kip, kit, tsik, tsip, tsit, tchik, tchip, tchit, preserved in the Archaic dialects; and the modern Pekinese hsi conceals the ancient Mandarin hi, hih, si, sih, which themselves recover the hik, hip, hit, sik, sip, sit, preserved in the dialects.\n\nThus, the two modern Pekinese syllables chi and hsi are the present decay of twenty-five syllables all formerly distinct, and still represented by ten distinct syllables in the ancient Mandarin. Albeit all the vocabulary is not so bad as that, I think that the instances quoted, which throw disorder in more than one-sixth of the whole, are sufficient to show that the adoption of Pekinese in European sinology for historical researches is far from being desirable.\n\n9. There are several names of Chinese dynasties which are easily confused in Pekinese; such as Ts'in \u79e6, Tsin \u6649, and\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. The chronological table of Chinese dialects in my work on The Languages of China before the Chinese, 1867, \u00a7 205.\n2 Cf. P. Legrand de la Liraye, Prononciation figur\u00e9e des caract\u00e8res Chinois en Mandarin Annamite, Saigon, 1875, p. 297.\n3 Stanislas Julien, who was not aware of the archaic sounds preserved in the dialects, could only state that \u00c7 represented \u00e7 in A\u00e7oka (while it represented really \u00e7ok). Cf. his M\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9chiffrer et transcrire les noms Sanscrits qui se rencontrent dans les livres Chinois, 1861, No. 2265.\n4 In Wells Williams, Syllabic Dictionary, 217 out of 1150 pages; in G. Stent, Pekinese Vocabulary, 110 out of 643 pages.\nKin \u91d1, which are transcribed Ch'in and Chin (Tch'in and Tchin), and in the Sacred Books of the East, Khin and Kin, where, unfortunately for the non-specialist scholars, the peculiar system of transcription adopted in the collection happens, in the Chinese series, to be complicated with the Pekinese sound. Perusing some days ago a recent work by a well-known scholar, not a sinologist, I met therein a vague quotation from this learned collection, where a curtailed reference was made to a K'in dynasty. I have not yet found which of the three dynasties, mentioned previously, is there referred to. So much for the advantages of the Pekinese sounds.\n\n10. In the name of Hiuen Tsang, the second symbol is pronounced chwang (tchwang) in Pekinese. I do not see any advantage in adopting it except that of a useless complication. The Imperial dictionary of K'ang hi quotes four previous dictionaries which give the pronunciation by the well-known fan tsieh method. They are:\n\n1\u00b0. The Kwang yun of A.D. 1008.\n2\u00b0. The Tsih yun of A.D. 1039.\n3\u00b0. The Yun hwei of A.D. 1300.\n4\u00b0. The Tcheng yun of A.D. 1375.\n\nThe initial is marked by \u982d ts(u in the first; by \u5728 ts(ai in the fourth, and again by \u624d ts(ai in the second, third, and fourth; this spelling is given with special reference to the name of \u7384\u5958. Moreover in the first case, \u6212 tsang, and in the second case, \u83e9 tsang, are given as being homonymous of \u822c, whose pronunciation is therefore settled to be tsang.\n\n11. Such are the reasons which justify the spelling of Hiuen-Tsang for the name of the great Chinese Buddhist, pilgrim of the seventh century, and the avoidance of Pekinese sounds for the historical names.\n\n1 Cf. K'ang-hi tze tien, s. v. \u822c.\n2 In Pekinese, these two words tsang are still at present pronounced tsang, and it may be asked if the diverged sound chwang ought to be applied to \u822c in a proper name.\nART. XVII.\u2014A Babylonian Ritual Text. By C. J. Ball,\nM.R.A.S.\n\n(4 R 23. No. 1.)\n\nThe original of the document here translated (K 4806) is unfortunately much injured, and the text presents great\u2014Dr. Jensen has said insuperable\u2014difficulties to the translator. Dr. Sayce has attempted a version of Col. I. in his Hibbert Lectures, p. 495. Dr. Jensen has made some good remarks on the piece, and given a version of Col. I. 8\u201315 in his Kosmologie (pp. 91 sqq.). A closer study of the entire text reveals important points of contact between this document and others, published in the same volume of inscriptions, from which I have attempted to extract a connected sense elsewhere (Glimpses of Babylonian Religion, P.S.B.A., Feb. 1892). These will be noticed in due course. In general, it may be said that, in spite of a few still enigmatical expressions, it is clear that we have in this interesting relic of Babylonian religion an Office or Liturgy, in which rubrics or ritual directions are interspersed with prayers and invocations of gods. The purpose of the whole appears to be the consecration of a graven image; not as Dr. Jensen thinks, of a new city. It is true that \\( \\text{\u0161i\u0161ir} \\) may be read du gal e\u0161\u0161i, \"sons of the new city.\" But it is also true that \\( \\text{\u0161i\u0161ir} \\) might be read \u0161i\u0161ir, as elsewhere; while \\( \\text{\u0161i\u0161ir} \\) may be Sin innamar \"the moon is visible,\" or the like (cp. 3 R 51, No. 8, 1; 58, No. 12, 1. 2). This is the more probable, as the purport of the opening lines seems to have been to fix the time astronomically for the rites which follow.\nTransliteration.\n\nCol. I.

The Assyrian rendering is \"Nuzku, a son of thirty, is withdrawn.\" With bab\u0101lu, bubbulu, op. \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9, \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9, Isa. lx. 20; Joel ii. 10.\n\nb Emmesharra (\"Lord of Plenty\") was a Chthonian deity and god of vegetation. Adar (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8, \u0161eggar, grain+put?) was the month of reaping and sowing; and \"the Seven, the great gods\" presided over this month (4 R 33, 47a). JENSEN thinks that they may be the Pleiades: see his *Kosm.* p. 92. The Chinese formerly believed that the seven stars of the Corn Measure (*Teu*), i.e. Ursa Major, marked the courses of the seasons. On the other hand, they call the sun, moon, and the five planets the \"Seven Directors,\" or rulers of the times and seasons.\n\nc The Accadian liliz, lilis, appears in Assyrian as lilisu, Sb 260. The general sense of our text requires that it should mean some kind of vessel or receiver. The form of the word suggests that it is a reduplication of li\u0161; li\u0161-li\u0161=lilli\u0161=lili\u0161. Now \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc\u05b0\u05e9\u05c1 li\u0161 (=lu\u0161), dil, idgurtu (cp. adaguru), seems to denote a vessel in (gi\u0161) \u05dc\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1-\nBIZ \u201coil flask (P),\u201d (gi\u0161) LI\u0160-NI-\u0160E\u0160, nap\u0161a\u0161tu, do.; Br\u00fcnnow, 7753 sq. We may also compare \u1e63\u1e63\u1e63 dug, lud, the determinative of goblets, tankards, cups, etc. The Chinese lik, li is \u201ca tripod or incense caldron,\u201d holding six or ten pecks (the 193rd key or radical). Perhaps the lili\u0161 was a \u201cbrazen laver.\u201d\n\nTekil=tekkil, fut. qal of \u1e2b\u016bn; whence eklitu \u201cdarkness.\u201d The text certainly seems to say that the twelve \u201cgods,\u201d that is bronze idols, were to be put into the lili\u0161 and shut in; probably a lustral rite.\n\n\u1e62\u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2b\u016bn \u1e2b\u016bn may be a single group, denoting \u201cto trample down grass,\u201d like the Chinese p\u2019ut, p\u2019o, Chalmers, No. 94. Otherwise, the order of words in the Accadian indicates the rendering given above. Cp. line 15, where \u0161u mu laglagga is taken in the Assyrian as equivalent to \u0161u-laglagga-mu \u201cmy pure hands,\u201d though it would rather mean \u201cmy hands are pure.\u201d\n\nKirbitu: cp. \u1e2b\u016bn. (I had identified this term independently of Jensen.)\n\nThis recalls the American planting of the maize-god \u201cthe friend of man, Mondamin,\u201d in Longfellow\u2019s Hiawatha. With \u0161al\u0101lu cp. \u1e2b\u016bn embryo, Deut. xiv. 7, Jon., and perhaps \u1e2b\u016bn, semen genitale. The Acc. gili is kuzbu, ul\u0161u \u201cjoy,\u201d \u201cpleasure.\u201d\n\nI suppose that the lili\u0161, or brazen caldron, was flanked by two brazen bulls (cp. 1 Kings vii. 23 sqq). Between the ears of each bull was an orifice, with a pipe to carry off the holy water poured into it, either down into the earth, whence it was called a \u201cmouth of the Deep\u201d (which is underground), or else perhaps into the lili\u0161.\nThe thrice repeated \\( \\Psi \\) is clearly the relative particle, and not a verb as Sayce takes it. The gin sag-kud is, I think, a truncated reed, used as a bucket. The gin dugga are \"sweet canes,\" or edible reeds. Various kinds of reeds were used in lustral ceremonies and for offerings: see 4 R 25, 34b. Sayce renders the two lines: \"The mouth of the deep ('the sea') which is between the ears of the bull is made; on the right is it made; a rim of copper I found. On a reed whose head is cut thou shalt press a good reed.\" He evidently transcribed tulahhas, instead of turahhas, \"thou shalt steep, or plunge, or soak.\"\n\n1 The Accadian of this second prayer or hymn is unfortunately not given. The line ana pars\u0131 kidud\u0113 na\u0161uka may perhaps mean \"They have brought thee, in accordance with, to satisfy, the sacred Law\"; or even \"to have the sacred laws graven upon thee.\" For the expression pars\u0131 kidud\u0113, see Lehmann, \u0160ama\u0161-\u0161um-ukin, Bil. 12. (In Bil. 23 Lehmann leaves the name of the castle of Sippar unexplained. Bad BAR . UL . RU . SA . A, or rather bada Utu ulu ru s\u0101, is \"the castle called 'the Sun, the Maker of Joy'\" = \u0160amsu ban or epi\u0161 ul\u0161i. Cp. Gudea E. col. 9, 1 sqq., which may be transcribed thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{nin mu ba ziggi} \\\\\n\\text{nam-ti ba} \\\\\n\\text{ud sag da\u011f ni-ru} \\\\\n\\text{mu-ku mu-na-s\u0101}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\"'My lady, the righteous giver,  \nThe giver of life,  \nMaketh double the sum of days,'  \nFor a name he called it.\")\n\nNingi\u0161zidda was a \"throne-bearer (guzal\u016b) of Earth,\" 4 R 1, 44b; Gudea B. iii. 4.\nI have taken \u1e2bri as aor. of \u1e63\u1e63b (cp. Ezek. xxi. 19, \u1e63\u1e63b). Might it rather be ibtal=itbal? Cp. 4 R 25,\n\nIt seems gis-gar, because of the Chinese k'ak (=k'ar), \"to carve, sculpture, engrave.\"\n\nGa-lum-gu, or ga-lum \"monster fish,\" is a title of Ea, viz. of Ea \u0161a mulu U\u0161-KU (see col. 4, 26); 2 R 58, 61b. The sign had also the sound ba-lag (ba-lang), Sb 156, and this seems akin to ga-lum. We see lum \"huge\" in da-lum also. May not balaena, \u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1, possibly be related to balang, galum?\n\nThe Chinese have certain festal rites which they call \"waking the gods,\" celebrated in the spring of the year.\n\nm KI . \u0160U . BI . IM. That this is a complete expression appears from its recurrence in cols. 3, 4. Cp. Chinese k'it \"to pray,\" pin, ping \"to supplicate\" the gods. We might also transcribe KI \u0161ubim (=\u0161upi) \"the splendid place\" or \"seat\"; but it would not suit the context of cols. 3, 4.\n\nThe \"great garden\" or \"plantation\" (meri\u0161tu) reminds us of 4 R 25, 24b.\n\nn The \"utterance of the brazen tripod,\" or caldron, is the prayer which is uttered beside or before it.\n\no See 4 R 25, 25b.\n\np See 4 R 25, 28b: kalumma qim a\u0161nan \u0161ani dea, \"dates wheaten grain twice (or again) pour out.\" Perhaps ka-lumma should be supplied here also.\n\nq uzu zag, uzu me-gan: cp. the Chinese sacrificial terms chik, tsdk \"broiled,\" and fan, huan (=kwan, kan) \"roast.\" (Like the Accadian gan, this old Ch. kan, pan, is also used with the ordinal numbers.)\n\nThe next line is restored from 5 R 25, 12b.\nkun = arkat, Br. 2041. nisiddu and siddu, l. 24, are doubtful. I have thought of the Talmudic \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b6\u05d4, a box-shaped litter or palanquin. The following invocation calls upon the new god to prepare for the banquet, as in 4 R 13, No. 2 (see P.S.B.A., Feb. 1892) gunni siddu\u2014tent of the ark.\n\nMy restoration of the Accadian of col. 4, 19/20 agrees with the indications of 4 R\u00b2. The Accadian nigab=pit\u016b \u201cto open,\u201d and =\u05e0\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05e2 = \u05e0\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05e2, pit\u016b; so that ni-gab mara-b is a compound like gal-kida, meaning \u201cto open,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d \u201cset free,\u201d or something of the kind: cp. the Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9 \u05d9\u05b5\u05d3\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9 \u05dc\u05b0\u05da\u05b8 Gen. xxvi. 22; also Ps. iv. 2. But we may perhaps understand a reference to opening the mouth of the idol; cp. 4 R 25, 47\u201350a. The \u201cking\u201d is then the new god.\n\nWith a final prayer the idol is now to be left, seated on his ark-like throne.\n\nThe Chinese dedication of a god consists in giving by blood the appearance of life to the eye and countenance of the idol, and placing it on its seat. This they call kai kwang shing tso \u201cgiving light, and raising to the throne\u201d (Morrison).\n\nThe line \u201cwhen thou bringest a bull into the House of Mummu\u201d is perhaps only the catchword of the next tablet in the series. The expression nip\u0161i nam-u\u0161-ku-ge may probably be rendered \u201cFunction of the Hieroduli.\u201d See 2 R 21, 39, 40, and 43, where U\u0160-KU is made a synonym of mulu \u201cman,\u201d and la-bar \u201cservant.\u201d Nam-u\u0161-ku, therefore, is like servitus or servitium for servi. The pronunciation of U\u0160-KU was possibly (u\u0161) tug: cp. 5 R 12, le tugga, zikaru.\nTHE NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ORIENTALISTS.\n\nLONDON, 1892.\n\nAbout 100 members assembled for the preliminary meeting on Sunday night, the 4th September, in the Whitehall Rooms of the H\u00f4tel Metropole, where refreshments were served. The Chairman and some other members of the Organizing Committee received the guests.\n\nThe first, or opening meeting, was held on the following morning at eleven o'clock in the Theatre of the University of London, Burlington Gardens. About 200 were present, including delegates from the Governments of Austro-Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the N.W. Provinces of India, the Punjab, Burmah, Egypt, and elsewhere. H.H. the Gaikwar of Baroda was represented by his brother.\n\nDelegates attended from the Universities and learned societies and institutions.\n\nIn the absence of H.R.H. the Duke of York, the Chairman of the Committee of Organization (Sir Thomas Wade) invited the Earl of Northbrook, President of the Royal Asiatic Society, to take the chair.\n\nLetters of regret were read by the General Secretary (Prof. Rhys Davids) from H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, Sir Francis Knollys, the Belgian Minister, the Marquis de Casa Laiglesia, from the Ministers of China, Japan and Chile; also from Sir Henry Rawlinson, and a telegram from H.H. the Gaikwar of Baroda.\nThe General Secretary then read his report\u2014\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY'S REPORT.\n\nMy Lord,\u2014The Eighth International Congress of Orientalists, held at Stockholm and Christiana in 1889, left the selection of the next place of meeting to a Committee of former Presidents.\n\nThe Committee approved of London as the place of meeting, and were so fortunate as to secure for the office of President the illustrious scholar, Professor Max M\u00fcller, K.M.\n\nThe choice has been amply justified. In spite of adverse circumstances, the response to our invitations has been most cordial. The list of members includes many of the most distinguished Orientalists of Europe, and papers of unusual interest will be presented.\n\nEleven Governments, twenty-six learned Societies, and thirteen Universities have sent delegates; two invitations for future Congresses have been received, and the undermentioned Princes of India have most generously contributed towards the expenses of the present meeting:\u2014\n\nH.H. The Gaikwar of Baroda, G.C.S.I.\nH.H. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Vizian\u0101gram.\nH.H. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Maisur.\nH.H. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Travancore.\nH.H. The Rao of Kutch, G.C.I.E.\nH.H. The Thakur Sahib of Gondal, K.C.I.E.\nH.H. Rangit Singh, R\u0101ja of Rutl\u0101m, K.C.I.E.\nH.H. The R\u0101ja of Kap\u016brthala.\nH.H. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Kush Beh\u00e1r, G.C.I.E.\n\nThe announcement was made that H.M. the King of Sweden had presented to the Congress the drinking horn used at Stockholm to be the property of each succeeding President. His Majesty had further expressed his wish to give a gold medal for the best essay on some point (to be afterwards more definitely announced) of Aryan philology.\n\nThe President of the Congress, Professor Max M\u00fcller,\nthen read his inaugural address, in the course of which he said: \"What we are assembled here for is to bring the East which seems so far from us as near as possible, near to our thoughts, near to our hearts.\" . . . \"One of the greatest achievements of Oriental scholarship is to have proved that the complete break between the East and the West did not exist from the beginning.\" . . . \"We must be satisfied with the general statement that the Consolidation of the Aryan speakers took place somewhere in Asia.\" . . . \"The same holds good as regards the original home of the Semites.\" . . . \"No history of the world can in future be written without its introductory chapter on the great consolidations of the ancient Aryan and Semitic speakers; that chapter may be called pre-historic but the (linguistic) facts with which it deals are thoroughly historical.\" . . . \"At the present moment, when the whole world is preparing for the celebration of the discovery of America, let us not forget that the discoverers of that old pre-historic world deserve our gratitude as much as Columbus and his companions. The discoveries of Sir William Jones, Schlegel, Humboldt, and of my own masters and fellow workers, Bopp, Pott, Renouf, Benfey, Kuhn, and Curtius, will ever remain a landmark in the studies devoted to the history of our race.\" . . . \"It is equally due to the industry and genius of Oriental scholars, such as De Sacy, Gesenius, Ewald, and Wright, if we can no longer doubt that the ancestors of the speakers of the Babylonian and Assyrian, Syriac, Hebrew, Phoenician and Arabic formed once one consolidated brotherhood of Semitic speech.\" . . . \"The name of our letter Alpha in the Greek alphabet is a more irresistible proof of Phoenician influence than all the legends about Kadmos and Thebes.\" . . .\n\nIn connection with the last quotation Prof. Max M\u00fcller showed that although positive proofs (like those found in the Tel-el-Amarna tablets) of the inter-relation of the different peoples of the East were scarce, we have every reason to suppose that it really existed.\nOn the conclusion of this address a vote of thanks to the lecturer was proposed by Hofrath Professor Dr. B\u00fchler and seconded by the Conte de Gubernatis.\n\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\nAfternoon meeting.\u2014At three p.m. the list of books presented to the Congress was read. For these thanks were returned, and the following resolution, moved by Dr. Ginsburg and seconded by Mr. Delmar Morgan, was passed:\n\n\"That the Congress expresses its grateful thanks to the several donors of the works presented to the Congress at this session, and that the Committee of Organization be authorized to hand these works to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland as additions to its library, and with power to dispose of surplus copies in such way as it shall think best adapted to further the purposes of this Congress.\"\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Sir Thomas Wade and seconded by Dr. T. H. Thornton:\n\n\"(1) That a Committee be appointed to consider the time and place of the next meeting of the Congress and the selection of a President, and for the further purpose of drawing up regulations for the organization and conduct of the same, based upon the practice of past sessions of the Congress.\n\n(2) That the Committee be selected by the President of the Congress in concert with the Chairman of the Committee of Organization (Sir Thomas Wade), the General Secretary (Professor Rhys Davids), the Treasurer (Mr. Delmar Morgan), and the Delegates of Governments and Societies.\n\n(3) That the proposals of the Committee appointed as aforesaid be submitted to the Congress for ratification.\"\n\nIn accordance with the above resolution, the following were appointed to be members of the Representative Committee:\nItaly . . . . . . . Count de Gubernatis.\nAustria . . . . . . Professor B\u00fchler.\nUnited States of America Professor Lanman.\nGermany . . . . . . Professor Kielhorn.\nSweden . . . . . . Professor Piehl.\nEngland . . . . . . Dr. Peile, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.\nArmenia . . . . . . Professor Minasse Tch\u00e9raz.\n\nTo these were added the President of the Congress, the Chairman of the Organizing Committee (Sir Thomas Wade), the General Secretary (Prof. Rhys Davids), the Hon. Treasurer (Mr. E. Delmar Morgan), and Dr. T. H. Thornton. Power was reserved to add other members to this Committee.\n\nThe following resolution for regulating proceedings of the present Congress was proposed by Sir R. West, seconded by Mr. Percy Newberry, and carried unanimously:\n\n\"That the proceedings of the present Congress be regulated, so far as possible, according to the practice observed at previous meetings. In the event of questions arising, the President of the Congress or Section, as the case may be, shall determine them, with power, should he think fit, to report questions of difficulty to the representative Committee appointed as provided in the preceding resolution.\"\n\nThe meeting then terminated, and the various Sections met in their several Sectional Rooms.\n\nThe numbers attending the different Sections were about the same as in former Congresses, except that the Semitic section was smaller and the Indian (held in the Library of the University) more numerous.

Sir M. E. Grant Duff delivered his address on Additions to our Knowledge of Asiatic Geography since 1869. (Tuesday morning).\n\nX. In the absence of Mr. Gladstone his address was read by Prof. Max M\u00fcller in the Theatre of the University of London on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSingle Papers.\n\nI. Tuesday morning (I. and II. combined). Prof. Kielhorn made a communication with respect to a Collection of Notes by Colebrooke in the University Library of G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nThe discussion of Sir Raymond West's address was resumed by Profs. B\u00fchler and Cowell, Messrs. Chintamon, Bhatt, Neil, and Taw Sein Ko.\n\nProf. Leumann contributed a short paper on a communication by Prof. Pull\u00e9 concerning 350 Jain MSS. in the Biblioteca Nazionale, Florence.\n\nMr. Taw Sein Ko read a paper on Burmese Beliefs about Spirits.\n\nWednesday morning.\u2014The Rev. Murray Mitchell treated of the Mahrathi Poets.\n\nMr. J. A. Baynes gave an abstract of his paper on the Language Census in India. This was followed by a discussion, in which Mr. W. E. Crooke and Prof. B\u00fchler took part.\n\nProf. Rhys Davids delivered a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the paper by Miss Foley, dealing with the Life and History of the Women members of the Buddhist Order, and read a portion of Mrs. Bode's translation of Buddhaghosha's commentary on the Anguttara Nik\u0101ya.\n\nWednesday afternoon (I. and II. combined).\u2014Prof. B\u00fchler produced Photographs of Jaina Sculptures from Mathura,\nand explained the various curious details, especially a figure of *Negamesa* and representations of *Centaur*.\n\nProf. Cowell read an excellent paper on the *Mah\u0101k\u0101vya* called Buddhacarita. He showed that it had been imitated by K\u0101lid\u0101sa in the Raghuvansa and by the author of the extant R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. Prof. Cowell had published an edition of the work and distributed fifty copies to members of the Aryan Section.\n\nProf. B\u00fchler gave an account of Mr. Pathak\u2019s paper on Kum\u0101rila in Jain Literature, and Prof. Rhys Davids read Surgeon-Major Waddell\u2019s Report on Excavations in Patna.\n\n*Thursday morning (I. and II. combined).*\u2014Prof. B\u00fchler gave a brief abstract of Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar\u2019s paper on the S\u016btras of \u0100\u00e7val\u0101yana and C\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana. The object of the paper, which is an exceedingly scholarly and valuable one, is to give an account of a lately discovered MS. entitled Anukramanidhundh\u016b, and to show with its help that the two S\u016btras are intended for the adherents of both the B\u0101\u015bhkala and the C\u0101kala Samhita.\n\nMr. Vincent A. Smith then read his paper, entitled: \u201cObservations on the Gupta Coinage,\u201d an abstract of which has already been printed and distributed.

Warren\u2019s paper on \u201cBuddhaghosha\u2019s \u2018Path to Purity.\u2019\u201d Dr. Morris and Prof. Lanman expressed the thanks of the Section to the author of the paper; Prof. Lanman adding that Mr. Warren had been engaged for some time on a complete edition of the Pali Text of the work in question, which will certainly be published, either in the Harvard series, or by the Pali Text Society, during next year.\n\nMr. C. B. Clarke, F.R.S., read an abstract of a paper by Mr. W. Brennand on \u201cIndian Astronomy.\u201d Dr. Burgess added some remarks.\n\nThe thanks of the Section were passed to Mr. Malabari, to Mr. H. H. Dhruva, and to Prof. Wilhelm for the papers submitted by them; and to Mr. G. B. Tilak, B.A.,\nfor printed copies of the summary of his work called \"Orion,\" which were distributed among the members of the Section.\n\nMr. Kashinath Trimbak Telang's paper on \"Gleanings from Maratha Chronicles,\" was read by Dr. Burgess, who remarked that the paper was one of great value.\n\nFriday morning (I. and II. combined).\u2014Prof. Deussen read his paper on the Philosophy of the Vedas, distributing at the same time a prospectus of a new general history of philosophy to be published by him later on.\n\nMr. E. J. Rapson read Major-Gen. Sir A. Cunningham's paper on \"The Coins of the H\u016bna Kings.\"\n\nMr. Stuart Glennie treated of \"The Origin and Cradle-land of the Aryan Race.\"\n\nProf. Ascoli read his paper, \"Ueber die verwandschafts-verh\u00e4ltnisse der indogermanischen Sprachen.\" A discussion followed in which Prof. von Bradke and Prof. Rhys Davids took part.\n\nAfternoon.\u2014Prof. Max M\u00fcller submitted to the Congress the new edition of his Rig Veda, and moved a vote of thanks to the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Vizian\u0101gram.\n\nHofrath Dr. B\u00fchler seconded the vote of thanks to H.H. the R\u0101ja, and handed in, in support of his contention, the following document:\n\n\"The undersigned, while giving expression to their high sense of the obligation to H.H. the R\u0101ja of Vizian\u0101gram for the generous help given for the republication of Prof. Max M\u00fcller's edition of the Rig Veda with Sayana's commentary, venture to hope that an additional volume may be published containing a verbal index to the hymns.\"\n\nThe document was signed by the Sanskrit scholars attending the Congress.\n\nDr. Pavolini read a paper on the M\u0101dhav\u0101nala Kath\u0101.\n\nProf. Rhys Davids read an abstract of the Rev. Dr. Richard Morris's paper on \"Jain and Sanscrit Etymology in the light of P\u0101li.\"\n\nProf. B\u00fchler and Prof. Cowell discussed some of the points raised by Dr. Morris.\nM. de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin read two papers by M. Sylvain L\u00e9vi (1) on the early Cartography of India with facsimiles; (2) On two Chinese Versions of the Milinda-pa\u00f1ho, this paper being the joint production of MM. Specht and L\u00e9vi.\n\nMr. St. John spoke of \"Some old Towns in Pegu.\"\n\nII. Tuesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, and Friday this Section was combined with I.\n\nWednesday morning.\u2014Prof. von Bradke spoke on the pre-historic separation of the Aryan nations.\n\nProf. Kielhorn discussed the exact commencement of the Kalachuri era.\n\nProf. Colinet revealed the primitive nature of the goddess Aditi.\n\nDr. Schrumpf lectured on the Progress of Armenian Studies.\n\nIII. (a) No report of this Sub-Section has been received up to the time of going to press.\n\n(b) General Semitic Section.\n\nTuesday morning.\u2014Dr. I. Goldziher read a paper, in German, entitled \"S\u0101li\u1e25 b. Abd al Kudd\u016bs und das Zindik-thum w\u00e4hrend der Regierung des Chalifen Al-Mahdi.\" He discussed the doctrines of the Zindi\u1e33s (i.e. \"heretics\"), a religious sect which exercised much influence under the earlier Abbasid Caliphs. It was shown that in some of their writings there appear distinct traces of Buddhist ideas.\n\nProf. J. P. N. Land made some remarks on the earliest development of Arabic music. He distinguished between the native Arabic music of pre-Islamic times, and the later systems which were developed under Greek and Persian influence. Drawings were exhibited representing various kinds of lute or guitar in use among Arabs and Persians.\n\nTuesday afternoon.\u2014Dr. H. Hirschfeld gave some account of his forthcoming edition of the Diw\u0101n of \u1e24ass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit, at the same time discussing the poet's history, and the genuineness of the pieces attributed to him.\nWednesday.\u2014Prof. D. H. M\u00fcller presented his work, \"Die Recensionen und Versionen des Eldad had-D\u0101ni,\" adding some explanations. \"The Book of Eldad the Danite,\" is a medi\u00e6val Jewish composition, describing an imaginary Israelite kingdom in the centre of Africa. By a comparison of the variants in certain passages, Prof. M\u00fcller has succeeded in establishing a genealogy of the various manuscripts.\n\nDr. M. Gaster described his forthcoming edition of the Aramaic Chronicle of the Hasmon\u00e6ans, sometimes called \"Megillath Antiochos.\" This work, according to Dr. Gaster, was composed in the first century of our era. The Western manuscripts of it are less correct than those from South Arabia. The latter have the superlinear vocalization.\n\nThe Rev. G. Margoliouth read a paper on the superlinear vocalization, of which there are two varieties, the \"simple\" and the \"composite.\" The author rejected the notion that this vocalization is of Karaite origin, and also disputed its right to be called Babylonian. He argued that it was based upon a combination of the two systems of Syriac vocalization and was originally applied to Aramaic documents only, not to the Hebrew text of Scripture.\n\nThe President of the Section communicated two papers by Prof. E. Nestle, of T\u00fcbingen, the first dealing with some points of Semitic pal\u00e6ography, the second with the new Cambridge edition of the Septuagint.\n\nAn abstract was also read of a paper by the Very Rev. A. J. Maclean, describing his work on the living Aramaic dialects of Kurdistan and the neighbouring districts. These dialects are numerous and divergent; previous to Archdeacon Maclean's researches only one or two types had been fully examined.\n\nThursday.\u2014Dr. K. Vollers read a paper on \"Arabic Phonetics.\" There are two phonetic systems which, from about the end of the eighth century of our era, have been known to the native Arabic philologists. Both may perhaps be ultimately based upon Indian systems. Dr. Vollers pointed out the great importance of phonetic researches as\nthrowing light upon the relation between the different dialects.\n\nProf. J. Karabacek spoke, in German, on Arabic Proto-colla, i.e. first leaves of official rolls of papyrus, pointing out how the study of these furnishes a solid basis for the knowledge of Arabic diplomatic documents. The author exhibited photographs illustrating the various types and styles used in the early centuries of Isl\u0101m.\n\nAhmed Effendi Zeki, Delegate of the Egyptian Government, gave an account of several works composed or copied by himself.\n\nSheikh Mohammad R\u0101shid spoke, in Arabic, on the history and characteristics of the Cairene dialect, and presented his new Commentary on \u1e24ar\u012br\u012b.\n\nColonel G. T. Plunkett read a paper on \"The Study of Arabic by Europeans,\" suggesting the establishment of a Normal School in Egypt, to train natives in the art of teaching Arabic to Europeans. On the motion of Colonel Plunkett, seconded by Sir Francis Grenfell, the Section unanimously resolved to ask the Congress at its general meeting to take steps for impressing on the Government the importance of subsidizing the study of modern Arabic.\n\nFriday.\u2014Prof. D. H. M\u00fcller spoke, in German, on the proto-Arabic inscriptions, brought from Northern Arabia by Prof. J. Euting. These inscriptions are numerous, but mostly very short. They are written in a character nearly akin to the Sab\u00e6an, presenting, however, numerous pal\u00e6ographical difficulties. As regards their dialect, one very important feature is the use of the prefix \u1e24N as a definite article.\n\nProf. Ascoli communicated a paper by Prof. I. Guidi on the Hebrew text of Gen. ii. 19.\n\nSir H. H. Howorth read a paper in which he argued that at the end of the first chapter of Haggai there is a lacuna which may be supplied from Ezra iii.\n\nMrs. Lewis submitted photographs of some very ancient Arabic MSS. of the Gospels (tenth century) and Epistles (ninth century) from the monastery of Mount Sinai. The text differs considerably from any hitherto published.\nAt the suggestion of the President, supported by Profs. Karabacek, D. H. M\u00fcller, Dr. Goldziher, and Sir H. H. Howorth, it was determined that a meeting should be held on Monday at 10:45 to form a provisional Committee with a view to the organization of a group of scholars to undertake the compilation of an Oriental Encyclop\u00e6dia.\n\nMonday.\u2014A list of 12 scholars, representing the principal countries of Europe, was drawn up to form the provisional Committee above-mentioned.\n\nWednesday morning.\u2014A letter from Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, upon Excavations in Assyria and Babylonia, and the destruction of antiquities discovered there, was read by the Secretary, and in the discussion which ensued Dr. Hayes Ward moved the following resolutions:\n\n\u201c(1) That this meeting deplores the destruction of ancient monuments which takes place in the provinces of the Turkish Empire, and expresses the hope that the Turkish government will find means for checking it.\n\n\u201c(2) That it is desirable that the learned societies and scholars of Europe and America combine to solicit the assistance of their respective governments to use their influence with the Sublime Porte to allow proper researches to be made by experienced explorers, either on their own account or on that of foreign museums, leaving the distribution of what would be discovered for future arrangement.\u201d\n\nMr. Cope Whitehouse, Colonel Plunkett, and Mr. Delmar Morgan also spoke, and the motions were duly carried.\n\nMr. St. C. Boscawen then read his paper upon \u201cSome Mythological Inscriptions from Tel-el-Amarna,\u201d and Prof. Sayce made some remarks on the same.\n\nIV. PERSIAN AND TURKISH.\n\nWednesday morning.\u2014Mr. Ahmad Beg Akaeff read a paper on \u201cThe Origins of the Shiite Sect,\u201d which he believed to be a rehabilitation of Zoroastrianism, and Dr.\nMills one on \"The Zend MSS. recently acquired by the Bodleian Library.\" Facsimile pages of the reproduction of the Yasna MS. shortly to be published by the Clarendon Press were distributed to the members of the Section.\n\nThursday.\u2014The Rev. L. Casartelli gave an account of the literary activity of the Parsees during the last ten years; and Miss Sorabji read a paper on the public and domestic life of this people, with special reference to the educational and social position of Parsee women.\n\nFriday.\u2014Mr. H. Weld Blundell gave an account of his recent explorations in Persepolis, illustrating his description by photographs and diagrams shown by lime-light.\n\nMr. William Simpson spoke on \"Indian Architecture,\" tracing the origin of Muhammadan architecture back to the Sassanian, and showing the influence of primitive huts of bamboo on the later buildings of the Buddhists.\n\nV. China, Central Asia, and the Far East.\n\nTuesday morning.\u2014The Section met in the rooms of the Society of Antiquaries, under the presidency of Prof. Sir Thomas Wade. Dr. Legge, of Oxford, opened the business of the day with an account of \"The Comparative Merits of the Three Doctrines accepted in China,\" as represented in a work by Liu Mei, a Chinese Buddhist author, who flourished some five or six centuries ago. Liu Mei naturally ranks Buddhism above the systems of Confucius and Taoism; but Dr. Legge avowed a decided preference for the doctrine of Confucius and his followers.\n\nSir Thomas Wade spoke upon the same subject.\n\nAfternoon.\u2014The Rev. Dr. Edkins argued that Chinese is of an older type than any other known language. His view depends mainly on the theory that certain letters are more recent than others, and that Chinese is poorest in the latter and richest in the former sounds. Egyptian, Tibetan, and Tartar were placed next in the scale to Chinese; then the Semitic group, and lastly the Aryan, as the youngest of the great linguistic families.\nSir H. Howorth, who followed with some interesting remarks, suggested that the Semitic words, which Dr. Edkins had collected from Tibetan, might have been introduced into that language by such agencies as that of the Nestorians.\n\nWednesday morning.\u2014Dr. T. de Lacouperie read an abstract of a luminous paper by Prof. de Harlez on \"The Age and Composition of the Li ki.\" After a few comments by the President, the Rev. J. C. Ball, M.R.A.S., treated of \"The Accadian affinities of the Chinese writing and language.\" By way of illustration, the characters for \"parent\" (house+star), and those for \"reed,\" \"gold,\" \"sheep,\" \"righteousness\" were shown on the black board to be ultimately identical in the two languages. A discussion followed, in which Prof. Legge, Dr. Edkins, Sir T. Wade, and Sir H. Howorth took part.\n\nAn essay on the ku wen, entitled \"China's \u00e4ltester Culturzustand auf Grund seiner Schriftzeichen,\" by Dr. Rudolf Dvorak, was laid before the Section.\n\nWednesday afternoon.\u2014Some fine old Daimio swords were exhibited by Sir Henry Howorth.\n\nDr. T. de Lacouperie discoursed of \"The shifting of the Names and Symbols of the Points of Space from Babylonia to China, as Evidence of the South-west Asiatic Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization.\" It was alleged that the Sumero-Akkadian symbols for north and south have been interchanged by the \"Bak families\" who were the civilizers of China, while those for east and west have been retained in their original application.\n\nThursday morning.\u2014Mr. C. J. W. Pfoundes read part of an exhaustive account of \"Buddhism in Japan.\" Incidentally it was pointed out that the designation \"Esoteric Buddhism\" was an absurd misnomer of so-called Theosophy. Dr. Georg Huth, of Berlin, presented a new work in Tibetan, and read a paper in German on \"Hor chos byung, eine Geschichte des Buddhismus in der Mongolei und Tibetischer Sprache.\" Dr. Ginsburg interpreted. Prof. Max M\u00fcller remarked on the superior value of Tibetan versions of Sanskrit texts. A letter from Miss C. F. Gordon Cumming,\nabout Mr. Murray's adaptation to Chinese of Braile's system of teaching the blind to read, was laid before the Section by Prof. Legge.\n\nThursday afternoon.\u2014Mr. Walter Denning's review of \"Modern Japanese Literature\" was read by Prof. R. K. Douglas. The writer criticized Mr. Satow's article, \"Japanese Literature,\" in the American Encyclop\u00e6dia, and argued against discarding the native script in favour of the Roman character.\n\nMr. Dickins, who had sent Mr. Denning's paper, added also some remarks of his own in favour of Romanisation.\n\nDr. T. de Lacouperie presented a catalogue of the Chinese Coins of the British Museum.\n\nA letter was received from Gen. Alexander on the peculiar structure of the Mongolian eye.\n\nFriday morning.\u2014Mr. E. Delmar Morgan addressed the Section on the subject of the recent discoveries in Mongolia. His paper was entitled \"Reports on the results of the Russian Archaeological Expedition to the valley of the Orkhon (Mongolia).\" These Reports are written by Dr. W. Radlof and other members of the expedition. They are accompanied by a fine Atlas with Photographs, a set of which, received from St. Petersburg, was laid on the table.\n\nProf. O. Donner followed with \"Die Inschriften am Orchon und die finnische Expedition dorthin 1890.\" Prof. Donner presented to the Congress a publication by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Finno-Ougrienne of Helsingfors, containing inscriptions from the valley of the Orkhon, brought home by the Finnish Expedition in 1890.\n\nThere are three large monuments, the first erected 732 A.D. by order of the Chinese Emperor, in honour of Kiue-Teghin, younger brother of the Kh\u0101n of the Tukiu (Turks). The second was also erected by order of the Emperor, in honour of Mekilikor (Moguilen), Kh\u0101n of the Tukiu, who died 733 A.D. Both monuments are covered with Chinese and \"runic\" inscriptions. The third is trilingual, the inscriptions being written in Chinese, Uigur, and \"runic\" or\nYenissei characters. The importance of these memorials, for the problem of the oldest forms of the Turkic dialects, is evident.\n\nThe Rev. H. Hanlon's paper on \"The Folk Songs of Ladak\" was read by Mr. Casartelli.\n\nThe Section did not meet on Saturday.\n\nVI. Egypt and Africa.\n\nTuesday.\u2014Papers were read by Professor Hechler on a newly discovered MS. on papyrus of a portion of the Septuagint, and by Dr. Flinders Petrie on recent excavations at Tel-el-Amarna. The Hon. Sec., Mr. Newberry, also read a paper by Mr. Ll. Griffith on \"Fragments of Ancient Egyptian Stories.\"\n\nWednesday.\u2014Papers were read by Dr. Karl Piehl on personal pronouns in Egyptian, by Dr. Ed. Mahler on the decree of Kanopus, and by Prof. V.

A letter and telegram were read from H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and congratulatory telegrams from H.M. the King of Sweden, H.I.H. the Archduke Rainer, and H.R.H. Duke Philip of Saxe Coburg. A number of resolutions from the various Sections were then read and carried by the meeting. It was decided to hold the Tenth International Congress at Geneva in 1894, and a set of regulations for the conduct and organization of future Congresses were agreed to. Votes of thanks to the Universities of London and learned Societies which had lent their rooms to the Congress, to the Indian Princes who had contributed to its funds, to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and to the public bodies and private persons who\nhad entertained the members of the Congress, were passed. The Sheikh Mahomed Rashid recited an Arabic poem, the substance of which was interpreted in French by Mahomed Zaki Efendi. Professor Ascoli, Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, moved, and Professor Drouin seconded, a vote of thanks to the President, who, in response, declared the Ninth Congress of Orientalists closed.\n\nThus ended one of the most successful Congresses that has been held. The greatest efforts will be made to bring out the complete transactions as soon as possible. Meanwhile we may look forward to the Tenth Congress at Geneva in 1894, and wish to it also every success.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\nNOTE ON ANCIENT REMAINS OF TEMPLES ON THE BANNU FRONTIER. Communicated by Lala Hira Lal.\n\nSir,\u2014Lala Hira Lal, a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, has communicated to me the following details of some old Temples in an unfrequented part of the Panjab frontier. In Edwardesabad, or Bannu, a little below Attock, is the small town of K\u00e2l\u00e2b\u00e2gh, on the very bank of the Indus. The river is here not more than 400 feet broad, as it is confined between high banks on both sides. Just opposite to K\u00e2l\u00e2b\u00e2gh is the small village of M\u00e2ri, the path from the river bank leading to which winds round the base of a hillock about 200 feet high. The hillock is called by the villagers Arjan N\u00e2ng\u00e2, and upon mounting this the remains of two Temples are reached. The villagers state that, after the Kerw\u00e2s had defeated the P\u00e2ndw\u00e2s, the latter retired to this hill in order to spend their twelve years of banishment in seclusion. Their exile is supposed to have been passed on the spot marked by these Temples. A little higher up there are the remains of a third utterly ruined Temple, built of bricks of light porous clay, about one foot long, nine inches wide, and three inches thick. The villagers informed Hira Lal that the bricks of this ruin were made of leaves; and this statement induced him to break a few of the bricks. To his astonishment he found them all distinctly marked inside with the impressions of the leaves of trees. Several specimens of these broken bricks have been forwarded to me, and the veining of the laurel-like leaves is certainly very distinct upon them.\nThe presence of a petrifying spring at no great distance renders it probable that these bricks are made of clayey soil mixed with leaves, which has been under the influence of this spring of water. It seems, however, that no use is now made of this material in building. A large number of quartzose crystals are scattered over the hill and imbedded in the stones. These, it is asserted, are due to the curse of a Faqir, who turned into useless crystals all the precious gems of which the hill was originally composed.\n\nThe two Temples first spoken of are believed by the villagers to be five thousand years old; and they are undoubtedly of great antiquity. Their fronts appear to have been repaired in modern times. Lala Hira Lal is, unfortunately, not an artist; but he has supplied rough sketches which show that these are remains of Buddhist Temples of the tall, or conical, kind; but whether of the straight or bulged species it is impossible to say. The Buddhistic character of these remains is made certain by the eight-leafed lotus ornaments, which Hira Lal represents as the characteristic carving of the Temples. It is worth notice that the villagers of the neighbourhood of this hill use small stone bottles for ink, etc., which closely resemble small st\u016bpas. They are eight-sided, just like ordinary Buddhistic pillars; and the zig-zag markings on each face also consist of eight points; while the edges of the faces are notched into eight divisions. Round the dome-like tops of these little st\u016bpas are sets of eight-pointed zig-zags, and there are also notches arranged in sets of eight. It is, at least, remarkable that obscure villagers should be traditionally manufacturing these little stone objects so suggestive of a Buddhistic origin, marked all over with the mystic number eight, in contiguity to the remains of old Buddhistic Temples.\n\nFrederic Pincott.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(July, August, September, 1892.)\n\nI.

Problematic Passages in the Rig-Veda.\n\nII. OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nSurgeon-General Henry Walter Bellew, M.D., C.S.I., was the son of the late Major H. W. Bellew, of the Bengal Army, born at Nusserabad in India, on the 30th of August, 1834, and died at Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, on the 26th of July, 1892. His father was Assistant Quarter-Master General attached to the ill-fated army of Kabul, of which only one survivor, Dr. Bryden returned, to tell the tale of the disaster. He entered in 1852 as a medical student at St. George's Hospital, where he was soon distinguished as an intelligent and painstaking scholar, and was a favourite pupil of the late Mr. Caesar Hawkins, Sergeant-Surgeon to the Queen.\n\nAfter finishing his professional studies, and being in possession of his diplomas, Dr. Bellew went to the Crimea in 1854; he returned from the seat of war in 1855, and obtained his commission as Assistant-Surgeon in the Bengal Medical Service.\n\nHis first appointment in India was to do duty with the Guides, but he did not stay there long, having been ordered to join Major H. B. Lumsden on the famous Mission to Kandahar, of which he published his first important work under the title, \"Journal of a Mission to Kandahar in 1857 and 1858,\" full of information, not merely from a scientific, but also from a political point of view, and as a study of the character of the warlike hill-tribes. During the two years of the Sepoy Mutiny Dr. Bellew was doing duty beyond the frontiers of India, and whilst his corps was winning laurels in the campaign, and particularly before\nDelhi, he was unfortunately absent on quasi-political duty, a circumstance he always regretted, as it cut him off from all chances of actively distinguishing himself, and thus losing the honour and glory more or less attaching itself to those who had been through the mutiny. Dr. Bellew and his companions, the two Lumsdens, were during that critical time in the country of the Afghans, and entirely at their mercy; when the news of the perilous condition of the English Raj in Hindostan reached Kandahar, the son of Dost Mahomed Gholam Hyder, the governor, actually asked his father, as to whether the three Englishmen should be put to death? That such an event luckily did not take place, was greatly due to the young Doctor Sahib's fame as a kind and skilful practitioner, who, as such, had done good service to the Afghans themselves whilst in their midst.\n\nThe experience which Dr. Bellew gained in dealing with the frontier tribes, enabled him to render important services to Government during the Ambeyla campaign, for which he received a medal; subsequently, when Civil Surgeon of Peshawar, a wide field of usefulness opened out to him, and his name became a household word among the frontier tribes whose language he spoke, and with whose manners and feelings he thoroughly sympathized. Bellew's \"General Report on the Yusufzais in 1864,\" a work of great interest on the topography, history, antiquities, tribal subdivisions, government, customs, climate, and productions of that country, and the publication of a \"Grammar and Dictionary of the Pukhto Language\" supply ample proofs, if any were needed, of his untiring activity and political insight as well as of his linguistic zeal.\n\nIn 1869, during the Durbar at Amb\u00e1la, Lord Mayo employed Dr. Bellew as interpreter with the Ameer Shere Ali; this potentate never ceased to speak of him with expressions of respect and warm friendship. Nine years later, when Sir Lewis Pelly met the Afghan envoy in conference at Peshawar, the envoy is reported to have said to Dr. Bellew, \"I reckon you as our friend, and I know the Ameer esteems you as such.\"\nIn 1871 Dr. Bellew accompanied Sir Richard Pollock on a political mission to Sistan, where they were joined by Sir Frederick Goldsmid's mission from Bombay, and proceeded together to the Persian Capital; his valuable volume \"From the Indus to the Tigris,\" is the result of observations on that interesting journey. It contains also a sketch of a Grammar of the Brahui language, and other scientific matter.\n\nIn 1873 and 1874 he was selected to accompany Sir Douglas Forsyth's embassy to Kashghar and Yarkand, whose report on the same was largely written by Bellew. The graphic description of the people they visited, and an account of the neighbouring countries, includes several references to the \"Kunjut\" country as well, which, under the name of \"Hunza\" is now under the British influence; this specially valuable information is comprised in Dr. Bellew's work entitled \"Kashmir and Kashghar.\" The account of this expedition is worthy of the study of all who desire to obtain an insight into the history and position of Chinese Turkestan.\n\nWhen fresh warlike clouds were again gathering around Afghanistan, Dr. Bellew's well-known friendship with Shere Ali and his thorough knowledge of the frontier affairs, pointed him out to Lord Lytton as the most competent person for the post of chief political officer at Kabul in 1879. Illness unfortunately prevented Dr. Bellew from long holding the appointment; he was present at Shutur Gardan and all through the siege of Sherpur; he succumbed to the severe cold and hardships which brought on fever and dysentery, and was obliged to leave his post. Sir Lepel Griffen took up the appointment, and the success and rewards which followed, would in all likelihood have fallen to Bellew's share, had his physical strength been able to hold out longer. Bellew's stay in Kabul, however, furnished him with material for another book, \"The Races of Afghanistan,\" published in 1880.\n\nDr. Bellew retired from the service in November, 1886, with the highest rank attainable by a medical officer; still\nfull of energy and love for work, although with a broken down constitution, he loved to be busy with his favourite pursuit; during his retirement he read several Papers before the Royal Asiatic Society, of which he was an old member. To the last he was occupied with questions of comparative philology in connection with his theory of the relationship of the Greek and Pukhto languages.\n\nDr. Bellew was passionately fond of Oriental studies, for which he had so many opportunities, and acquired languages with great facility. His views on the history of those languages were, it is true, condemned by critical scholars. But the numerous works he wrote and the services he rendered to ethnography, grammar, and lexicography, deserve grateful acknowledgment. On medical subjects several treatises appeared from his pen; his work on cholera contains over 1000 pages; as Civil Surgeon of Peshawar he did good work in the direction of sanitary supervision and arrangements not only in his station but in his Province, the Panjab, generally, where he was best known. During his long cold-weather tours he visited, as Sanitary Commissioner, the small remote villages also; his usual custom being, when in larger towns, to assemble the members of the Municipalities, and to explain to them in a familiar style, the advantages of vaccination, the necessity for using pure water and practising general cleanliness. He published in the Panjabi a small treatise on vaccination, and notes on cholera, which could easily be understood by the people.\n\nThe medical establishment of India may well be proud of Surgeon-General Bellew, as one of those illustrious brother officers whose names will not be forgotten as long as that service lasts. His was a simple, kind, straightforward, and unostentatious character, a firm friend, beloved and esteemed by all who knew him. He spent his life in devotion to the public service, though it was hardly requited as it deserved to be. The gallant and famous frontier officer, Sir Charles MacGregor, was his intimate friend and companion of many years; his sister became Mrs. Bellew, who, with\ntwo daughters and a son, a Lieutenant in the 16th Lancers, are left behind.\n\nThe following is a list of his works:\u2014\n\n1. Journal of a Mission to Kandahar.\n2. Afghanistan and the Afghans.\n3. From Indus to the Tigris.\n4. Ethnography of Afghanistan.\n5. History of Cholera.\n6. Supplement to the History of Cholera.\n7. Yusufzai.\n8. Kashmir and Kashghar.\n9. Grammar and Dictionary of Pukhto Language.\n\nIn addition numerous pamphlets on political and medical subjects.\n\nT. D.\n\nIII. Notes and News.\n\nIndian Ethnography.\u2014The following Resolution has been published by the Government of India:\n\nNaini Tal, the 28th June, 1892.\n\nRead\u2014\n\nLetter from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, No. 2771688, dated 20th October, 1891.\n\nOpinions of the officers consulted\u2014Messrs. W. Crooke, J. C. Nesfield, E. J. Kitts, V. A. Smith.\n\nObservations.\u2014In the letter from the Government of India, above quoted, the opinion of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor was asked regarding the desirability of extending to these Provinces the scheme of ethnographical research which has for some time been prosecuted in Bengal under the supervision of Mr. H. H. Risley. The scheme, as described by Mr. Risley, contemplates the appointment of a \"Provincial Director of Ethnographic Inquiries,\" who should be unpaid, but who should be provided with a clerk to carry on correspondence and\nwith an allowance for stationery and other contingent charges. The Director by circulating lists of ethnographic questions under the authority of Government to District Officers and other correspondents, and by means of monographs to be drawn up by him or selected correspondents, would collect information regarding castes, customs and folk-lore, which information after collation and verification would be printed by Government in a convenient form and distributed to learned societies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\n2. The Government of India observes that the present is an opportune time for such inquiries, as the material procured at the recent census regarding caste, race and tribe would form a basis for the proposed investigation. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees in the desirability of prosecuting the inquiry at the present time; and has consulted several officers in these Provinces who have, by independent research, acquired special knowledge on the various subjects connected with ethnography. Mr. W. Crooke, at present Magistrate and Collector of Mirzapur, has already published several works of recognized value, and has for many years been engaged in collecting materials for a work similar in scope and arrangement to that compiled by Mr. Risley for Bengal. Mr. E. J. Kitts, now Judge at Moradabad, has devoted much attention to the collection of anthropometric data. Mr. J. C. Nesfield, at present Director of Public Instruction, has, during his long service in these Provinces, collected valuable notes on tribes, customs and folk-lore; and has published in part the results of his inquiries. Mr. V. A. Smith by his historical inquiries is also in a position to render valuable aid in the investigation which it is now proposed to undertake.\n\n3. Mr. W. Crooke has offered his services to Government as Honorary Director of Ethnographic Inquiries, and the Lieutenant-Governor accepts with thanks the offer of his services. There are in these Provinces no societies formed for scientific investigation of this kind, but there are societies which can, as correspondents, contribute very\nvaluable information, and which doubtless will assist. A special branch of inquiry is the measurement of living subjects with a view to ascertaining the physical characteristics of different tribes. Mr. E. J. Kitts will be asked to undertake the direction of this branch, and in consultation with the Director to make proposals for the systematic record of measurements and the utilisation of the data already in existence. Mr. Nesfield and Mr. Smith will be asked to give the Director the benefit of their advice, to aid him in drawing up lists of questions, and to cooperate in other ways pointed out by their knowledge and experience.\n\n4. Mr. Crooke has asked for an allotment of Rs. 1,000 for establishment and contingencies, including any preliminary printing that may be necessary. It is understood that a further grant will be required if Mr. Kitts undertakes anthropometric inquiries. The Provincial Superintendent of Census will be able to provide copies of tables of castes and sub-castes in September, 1892; the figures for any special caste could be supplied at an earlier date. The results of the inquiries of the Census Department in connection with classification of castes and civil condition will be placed at the Director's disposal. District Officers will be asked to render such aid as lies in their power, and to place the Director in communication with gentlemen who take an interest in the subject, and who from their own observation and inquiry can supply answers to his questions.\n\n5. The Lieutenant-Governor fully recognizes how vast is the field to be explored and how inadequate are the arrangements sketched above for its complete exploration. The officers on whose assistance Government relies have their ordinary duties to perform, which at no time are light. His Honor is, however, of opinion that the experiment should be tried, that an effort should be made to gather up the scattered information now in existence, and to encourage those possessed of special knowledge to communicate it.\n6. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner, having ascertained that all the officers above named who are now in India are willing to aid Government in the manner indicated, is pleased to appoint Mr. W. Crooke to be \"Provincial Director of Ethnographical Inquiries\" and to place at his disposal a sum of Rs. 1,000.\n\nThe Semitic Inscriptions at Sinjerli.\u2014M. Joseph Hal\u00e9vy, the well-known French Orientalist, was deputed by his colleagues of the Paris Institute to go to Berlin and report upon the Semitic inscriptions which have been recently placed in the museum of that city, having, as already stated, been discovered by the German Oriental Committee which has been prosecuting its excavations in the comparatively unexplored region forming the boundary between Asia Minor and Syria. This region is formed by the two chains of the Amanus Mountains, the valley between them being traversed by the river Pyramus, which flows into the sea to the north of Antioch. It was upon the slopes of the southern range of the Amanus, at a place called Sinjerli, that the Berlin committee discovered an ancient city, buried beneath a number of mounds, with a number of statues bearing cuneiform inscriptions, Hittite inscriptions, and two long Aramean inscriptions, dating from the eighth or ninth century B.C., and engraved in raised characters upon the robes of two Royal statues. M. Hal\u00e9vy, who has been able to copy the inscriptions, states that the two Kings upon whose statues they are engraved were rulers of the land of Yadi, and reigned at an interval of about a century from each other. The first statue is that of Pan\u00e9mou, the founder of the dynasty, and the inscription relates his being placed upon the throne, the chief events of his reign, and the protection of the gods, this inscription being forty lines in length. The second inscription, a photograph of which has been published in M. Philippe Berger's new edition of the \"Histoire de l'Ecriture dans l'Antiquit\u00e9,\" is, in the opinion of M. Hal\u00e9vy, that of a King who was a vassal of Tiglath-Pilezer, King of Assyria, and who relates in some detail the wars of his father with\nthe neighbouring tribes, his relations with the Assyrians, his defeats, and his victories, in which, as in those related upon the inscriptions of Mesa and of Byblos, the divinity plays the principal part. He then goes on to describe the history of his own reign, and terminates by invoking the protection of the gods. M. Hal\u00e9vy says that the language of these inscriptions is not Aramean, as was at first supposed, but a Ph\u0153nician dialect, very analogous to Hebrew, which was spoken by the people whom the Assyrians named Hatte\u2014that is to say, Hittites or Hetheens. He adds that the current opinion as to their not being of Semitic race is quite erroneous, and that the hieroglyphics discovered in various parts of Asia Minor are of Anatolian and not of Syrian origin, the few texts of this kind found at Hamath and Aleppo being due to Anatolian conquerors, whose domination, however, was very temporary in character.\n\nMarriage Customs in Ancient India.\u2014Dr. Winternitz, now working in Oxford, has published an elaborate monograph in German on this important topic (Altindische Hochzeitsrituell, Vienna, Tempsky). He sets out more fully than has hitherto been done the regulations on the matter preserved in the ancient sects, with especial reference throughout to the \u0100pastamb\u012bya Gr\u012bhya S\u016btra. And he adds a number of very striking analogies he has discovered between the ritual of ancient India and that in use in other Aryan countries. The whole work is conceived and carried out in a thorough and scholarly way, and we congratulate him on the success of the special study he has made.\n\nIndian Fairy Tales.\u2014Under this title Mr. Joseph Jacobs has published a collection of some five-and-twenty Indian stories drawn from all kinds of sources. They are beautifully printed and illustrated, and would be an ideal gift book for Anglo-Indian children. In an introduction and appendix, which the children would skip, there is a clear r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the history of Indian story telling in its influence on the West; and older readers will find the interest of the stories much enhanced by the insight they may here obtain into\nwhat is perhaps the most entrancing story in the book, the \"Story of the Indian Stories.\"\n\nIndian Scholars.\u2014The following letter closes the correspondence printed on pp. 426-428 of this volume:\n\nIndia Office, Whitehall, 5th August, 1892.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Mr. Wynn's letter of the 10th June will have informed you that a copy of your letter of the 27th May last would be referred to the Viceroy.\n\nA reply to this reference has now been received, and I am desired by Lord Cross to communicate to you the views of His Excellency as expressed therein.\n\nIn regard to natives of India who may have distinguished themselves by proficiency in Oriental languages, it will be remembered that the honorary titles of Mah\u00e1mahop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya and Shams-ul-Ulama have been conferred since 1887; whilst the Order of the Indian Empire contains the names of a number of gentlemen who were appointed to it in recognition of their distinction in the same field; the policy of the State being to encourage Oriental scholars in their labours by the grant of honorary decorations.\u2014I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully,\n\nRobert Cust, Esq., Theoph.

(Bombay, 1891: Education Society's Press.)\n\nIf we measured the advance of study by the increasing bulk of grammars, we should have to conclude that the study of the Avesta had been making gigantic strides\nduring the last thirty years. In 1862, when Haug published an outline of Avesta grammar in the first edition of his Essays, seventy octavo pages were considered sufficient for the purpose, and were certainly not more than an ordinary memory could retain. While Justi's grammar of forty-six quarto pages (about 115 octavo), published in 1864, though more comprehensive and methodical, at once passed the limits of memory and became merely a book of reference. Other grammars have followed, such as that of Spiegel in 1867, of de Harlez in 1878, of Geiger in 1879; and the latest Avesta grammars, now introduced to the reader, are already more than four times the extent of Haug's outline sketched thirty years ago, although the quantity of Avesta text, from which they are derived, is precisely the same as formerly.\n\nThe first part of Jackson's grammar treats of the phonology, inflection, and word-formation of the Avesta language, and is preceded by an introductory essay on the Avesta. The second part, which is already in the press, will treat of the syntax and metre. Throughout the work the correspondences and contrasts with Sanskrit are constantly pointed out, and the author endeavours to obviate some of the intricacies, arising from the completeness of the work, by printing such details as are either unimportant, or rarely wanted, in smaller type. He has also supplied excellent indexes, in addition to a detailed table of contents, by aid of which a careful student can readily find any detail he may require; and the more desultory reader will find some most useful \"suggestions\" on p. xxxix. Excepting single letters (when treating of the alphabet) and three short specimens of Avesta text, the whole of the Avesta words are given only in italic transliteration according to a system adopted by the author, and the Sanskrit words according to the usual system, as employed by Whitney, with two or three variations. That transliteration conduces to great saving of space is obvious to every one, and the system adopted by Jackson has been well considered and is not open to\ngreater objections than any older system. But he must expect to find it a vexation to printers to have to supply some eighteen varieties of rare or new type; and old scholars may perhaps find some difficulty in distinguishing between a few of the new letters, when they have to trust to their eyesight rather than their experience in reading. It is to be feared that every new system of transliteration is a fresh hindrance to the settlement of any universal system, as no system can become universal until it displaces all other systems, new as well as old; and this it can do only through previous acceptance by all parties, publishers as well as scholars. Regarding the main body of the work it is sufficient to say that it is practically exhaustive and thoroughly systematic, the declensions and conjugations are given in complete detail, and both the orthography and formation of words are fully considered.\n\nKavasji Edalji's grammar, completed seven months earlier, clearly shows the great progress made, during the last few years, by studious Parsis in the scientific examination of their sacred books. It is written in English, and the Avesta words are given in their original characters. The general order of the contents is much the same as in Jackson's grammar, and the book, which includes a chapter on syntax, is provided with a detailed table of contents, but no index. The author has evidently spent much labour on the collection and arrangement of his materials, and has fully succeeded in producing a thoroughly practical grammar, and one sufficiently scientific for Parsi students. It would, perhaps, be well if grammarians and students did not place too much reliance upon the minute details of Avesta orthography. Those who are aware how much and how often the MSS. vary, not only from each other, but also from themselves, in the spelling of words, will not lay much stress upon small variations, knowing, as they do, that much of the uniformity in our editions of the texts may depend upon the oldest MSS. being mostly of the same family.\n\nE. W. West.\nIt is a pleasant task to call attention to a further instalment of the publications of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the shape of Dr. E. Hultzsch's volume of Tanjore Temple inscriptions, being Vol. II. Part I of his \"South Indian Inscriptions.\"\n\nThe Tanjore Temple has always been a subject of exceeding interest to students of South Indian history and Tamil palaeography, owing to the presence thereon, on almost every outer wall, of the well-known band of deeply-incised inscriptions in eleventh- and twelfth-century characters, which fills the space between the upper and lower sculptures of the plinth. Several palaeographers have essayed to publish portions of the text, and the late Dr. Burnell gave a substantially accurate account of its contents in more than one of his works, but it has remained for Dr. Hultzsch to publish the whole in extenso, in a form admirable in itself, and for the accuracy of which his own name is sufficient guarantee.\n\nWhile it was well known that the inscriptions embodied a record of grants made to the temple by the powerful Chola Sovereigns, R\u0101ja R\u0101ja, R\u0101jendra, and others, Dr. Hultzsch's research has brought to light a considerable number of new historical facts, has explained many doubtful points, and has in no inconsiderable measure enlarged our knowledge\u2014hitherto very scanty\u2014of the general system of revenue and taxation among the old Hindu Sovereigns.\n\nThis knowledge cannot fail to be of importance. Such is the state of ignorance regarding the Government of India in ancient times, even among the most educated persons, that it has hitherto been impossible for an Englishman, save by mere conjectures and inference, to reply satisfactorily to the utterances of irresponsible agitators at so-called National Congresses, or the relentless and lying slanders of the Native Press. Every sensible man felt certain that he was not exaggerating the case when he claimed for the British Government that it was the mildest and kindest that had ever existed in India, but there was no certain proof available, nothing that could be paraded before educated Hindus\nas conclusively establishing the fact. Part of the necessary proof is now being presented to us by Dr. Hultzsch.\n\nMost of these Congress gentlemen are filled with false ideas. They dream fond dreams of the country, having been formerly united under magnificent monarchs of stupendous power and dignity, the like of whom the world has never seen, who held the whole of India from the Hindu K\u016bsh to Ceylon in their imperial sway, and under whose benignant and enlightened government flourished all the arts and all the sciences in unparalleled splendour; and few are found to tell them that all this is a mere fabric of the imagination. When the truth becomes known to them it is certain that a great deal of the discontent undoubtedly at present existing will vanish from the land. It is built on false beliefs, but at present they are not known to be false\u2014they are, on the contrary, passionately believed in, and therein lies the danger. For this state of things the Government is mainly to blame in that they did not, in bygone years, give more solid encouragement to the study of archaeology and history. If the native student is kept in ignorance, the fault does not lie with him, but with his instructors; and by their parsimony in former days, by the convenient theory that all such studies are subjects for private persons, dilettanti, to work at and not for the State to encourage, by the fatuous argument sometimes raised that \"we govern the living and not the dead,\" the Government is responsible for the curious state of things actually existing, namely, that after 100 years of sound British rule, the leaders of native thought positively believe that the condition of the people under the Hindu Sovereignties was more satisfactory than it is at the present day. It is well, therefore, that publications like the present should be encouraged by the State, in the best interests both of the country and itself.\n\nThe inscription on p. 115, for instance, shows us that there was an excessively intricate and minute system of Revenue Settlement and Survey, while no less than four-and-twenty various taxes sucked the life-blood out of the ryot and the trader. Not only had a trader to pay a general tax on his\ntrade, but he had to pay a separate tax for the luxury of possessing a set of scales and weights; not only had the owners of all animals to pay taxes on them, but owners of elephants and horses were in addition compelled to pay dues to the State for stalls for sheltering them. The whole of this is abolished under the present Government. The system lasted into our own time under the name of \"moturpha.\" A ryot who dug a tank or well for irrigation had to pay a tax on it. Our Government has not only freed him from this, but rewards him for his energy by refraining from making any charge for the use of the water, and leaving him in the full enjoyment of his improvements.\n\nIt may be noted that another inscription, the last in the volume, mentions, besides all these, another harassing tax, the \"Prime Minister's Cess,\" which it may be believed was not small.\n\nIt has long been known that the great sovereigns, R\u0101ja R\u0101ja and R\u0101jendra, raised the Chola kingdom to its highest pinnacle of grandeur. From being a petty kingdom, dividing with the realms of the Ch\u016blukyas, the Pallavas, the P\u0101ndyans, the Cheras, and others, the Southern Peninsula of India, the dominion of the Cholas at this period of its greatness extended over the whole of the territories of these states, now become tributary.\n\nThe inscriptions now published record, for the most part, gifts made to the Tanjore Temple by these powerful chiefs. The first was engraved by order of R\u0101ja R\u0101ja about the year A.D. 1049, the twenty-sixth of his reign, to commemorate gifts made by himself, his elder sister, his wives, and others. A later record was in his twenty-ninth year (A.D. 1052). Part of the gifts made between the twenty-third and twenty-ninth year were taken from the treasures seized from the conquered Ch\u0113ras and P\u0101ndyas on the western side of the Peninsula. Other details of grants follow, proving that at one time the Temple must have possessed enormous wealth.\n\nInscriptions Nos. 4 and 5 give details of grants of village lands for the maintenance of the Temple made after R\u0101ja\nR\u0101ja's twenty-ninth year, and Dr. Hultzsch has very cleverly worked out the profoundly confusing system of land-measurement, and embodied it on page 66 into a table. A glance at this will enable any unprejudiced reader to comprehend how vastly superior and more simple our present system is to that of the days of R\u0101ja R\u0101ja.\n\nIn inscription No. 6 we have gifts made by R\u0101ja R\u0101ja's eldest sister Kundavaiy\u0101r, the daughter of Par\u0101nt\u0101ka II.; while Nos. 7 and 8 contain a list of her charities down to the third year of the King R\u0101jendra (A.D. 1067). These consist mostly of a large number of precious stones, many apparently not of great intrinsic value if we may note the description given of them. In one place 109 rubies and other stones are mentioned together, \"including such as had cavities, cuts, holes, white specks, flaws, and such as still adhered to the one.\" The priests who drew up the inscription clearly looked their gift-horse well in the face!\n\nNo. 9 is dated in the sixth year of R\u0101jendra Chola (A.D. 1070), while the next ten were all inscribed about the year A.D. 1074. From them much is learned regarding the system of village assemblies, or Panchayats. In A.D. 1083, the nineteenth year of his reign, R\u0101jendra Chola caused the twentieth inscription to be engraved, and in that he mentions a number of names of places conquered by him during the previous seven years. One victory was secured by an attack by sea. Dr. Hultzsch considers it certain that no fresh conquests were made after R\u0101jendra's nineteenth year.\n\nThe twenty-first and twenty-second inscriptions belong to the reign of K\u014dn\u0113rin-mai-Kond\u0101n, as his name must now be spelt; but it is very doubtful to what sovereign this title applies. He reigned for at least thirty-five years, and flourished subsequently to R\u0101jendra.\n\nThe last in the book, No. 23, belongs to the reign of Tirumalai d\u0113va, and is dated in the year A.D. 1455. The author considers it not improbable that Tirumalai d\u0113va is identical with Timma\u2014the founder of the second Vijayanagar dynasty, in proof of which he points to some of the fiscal terms being of Canarese origin.\nThe addition in this volume of facsimile plates is very welcome, and altogether the publication is worthy of its accomplished and scholarly compiler. We can suggest only one improvement, but it is one which would greatly enhance the value and difficulty of publication. This is that the text should be transliterated into English characters, as well as given in the vernacular. At present the work is only bibliographically useful to those acquainted with the Tamil and Grantha characters. It would be rendered of far greater interest to scholars all over the world if they were enabled to determine the reading of the alphabet.\n\nR. D.\n\nV.
