Flower, 5th Fusiliers.\n\n1. Introductory Remarks.\n\nThe animals which this paper is about, from their strange shapes, curious habits and the power of inflicting dangerous wounds which some possess, are of interest to most people, but especially to those who, having been brought up in England, where none but very small and harmless species exist, come to live in the East Indies, where a wonderful variety of these creatures flourish. However little one may care for natural history, one must come in contact with them, millipedes, centipedes, scorpions and spiders all entering houses and often turning up where least wanted, even in one's bath-sponge and bedding. When I arrived in the Straits Settlements, in March 1895, I knew practically nothing of these animals, how they were classified, how to distinguish between them, or which were poisonous and which harmless, and in no book or paper could I find the information wanted, so I set to work to collect and examine specimens, and compare them with such literature on the subject as was available. Mr. R.J. Pocock, of the British Museum of Natural History, most kindly gave me invaluable assistance in identifying specimens, and answering questions of all sorts about these animals, and finally has been so good as to look through my notes made in the Peninsula and Siam from 1895 to 1898. These notes, then, I venture to lay before the Society, hoping they may be of use to residents in the Straits, Native States and Siam, who are interested in these strange animals, and also hoping that they may help some more competent writer to compose a full catalogue.\n\nThe specimens I collected were distributed between the British Museum, and the Royal Siamese Museum, Bangkok; except some now in the Raffles Museum.\nII. Position in the Animal Kingdom.\n\nMillipedes, centipedes, scorpions and spiders all belong to the great collection of invertebrate animals with jointed legs which is for convenience grouped together and called the Sub-kingdom ARTHROPODA (or GNATHOPODA). Various opinions are held by naturalists as to the divisions into which this Sub-kingdom should be divided. Valuable papers on the subject appeared in \"Natural Science\" in 1897, by Mr. R. J. Pocock in the February number (p. 114), and by Prof. Ray Lankester in the April number (p. 267); from these the following provisional classification is adopted.\n\nSub-kingdom Arthropoda.\n\nSECTION I. Prototracheata (or Malacopoda).\n\nClass (i). Prototracheata (or Peripatoidea).\n\nContaining the single family Peripatidae, now divided into about four genera. A single specimen is on record from Sumatra, and Mr. H. N. Ridley informs me that the Skeat expedition recently obtained it in the Malay Peninsula. This very interesting animal has somewhat the general external appearance of a caterpillar, it has a pair of antennae, and in the Sumatran specimen 24 pairs of legs (t. Sedgwick, Cambridge Nat. Hist., vol. v, 1895, p. 26).\n\nSECTION II. Tracheata (or Lipobranchia).\n\nSubdivision A.\u2014Progoneata (or Prosthogonea).\n\nClass (ii). Diplopoda. \"Millipedes\" (vide post).\n\nClass (iii). Pauropoda. Containing the single family Pauropide.\n\nMinute creatures with twelve body segments and branched antenn\u00e6; which I believe have not so far been found in Malaya.\n\nClass (iv). Symphyta. Containing the single family Scolopendrellidae (vide post).\n\nSubdivision B.\u2014Opisthogoneata (or Opisthogonea).\n\nClass (v). Chilopoda. \"Centipedes\" (vide post).\nClass (vi). Hexapoda (or Insecta). The true insects, such as wasps, flies, butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers, etc., etc., divided into several orders.\n\nSection III. Branchiata (or Acerata, or Sozo-branchia).\n\nClass (vii). Crustacea. Crabs, lobsters, shrimps, woodlice, barnacles, etc., etc., divided into several orders.\n\nClass (viii). Cephalostraca, divided into 3 orders:\n1st Order Xiphosura, Containing the single family Limulidae (vide post).\n2nd order Merostomata (or Eurypterida), extinct.\n3rd order Trilobita, extinct. [It is probable that the Trilobita should form a distinct class].\n\nClass (ix). Arachnida. Scorpions, spiders, etc., (vide post).\n\nClass (x). Pantopoda (or Pycnogonida) \"Sea-spiders.\"\n\nII. Diplopoda.\n\nThe Millipedes, Class Diplopoda, are invertebrate animals found in all temperate and tropical regions, herbivorous, slow-moving and incapable of biting a human being, some are nearly 10 inches (254 mm.) in length. Head. The head is distinct and has a pair of short antennae (composed of seven or eight segments) in front and two pairs of jaws on its lower surface.\n\nBody. The body is more or less elongated and consists of from 3 to over 100 segments, all much alike in structure. The majority of species are nearly cylindrical in cross section (but some are flattened), each segment being eased in a horny ring.\n\nLegs. The bases of the legs are almost in contact in the middle of the lower surface of the body, there are two pairs to most of the segments, the last pair of legs are never elongated.\n\nNative Names for Millipedes:\n\nMalay, Giangok, Ulat-butan.\nSiamese, King len. (1894, p. 56).\nJavan, Gajjok (Lake + Kelsall, J. S. B. R. A. S., No. 26).\n\nOccasionally Millipedes are met with in very large numbers. The late Mr. Whitehead in his book \"Kinabalu,\" p. 17, describing his visit to Malacca, writes, \"On the way down from Mount Ophir I saw a wonderful gathering of pale yellow Millipedes.\"\nabout six inches long: they were in a mass, one on the top of the other, which must have numbered several hundreds, and reminded me of a huge dish of macaroni.\" And I myself saw enormous numbers on the island of Ko Sichang, in the Gulf of Siam, when visiting it on the 27th and 28th of August 1897; the following extract from my diary may be of interest:\n\n\"The chief living feature of the island was the Millipedes. From sea-level to the top of the hill, all about the ground under the shade of the trees and in the hot midday sunshine they were crawling about in hundreds and hundreds: the big red-brown ones (*Theropagus*) were particularly conspicuous, 5, 6 or 7 often to be seen crossing the path within a few yards\u2014some of these were uniform in colour, others banded alternately lighter and darker; then there were smaller Millipedes of a beautiful grey colour, and flattened ones (*Orthomorpha*); when we turned over dead leaves in the wood we found in the soil many small white-legged Millipedes, which when disturbed sprang about, very lively, hopping an inch or two off the ground, and were quite difficult to catch; a contrast to the numberless \"Tikal\" Millipedes (*Zephyronia*), which were exceedingly numerous on the artificial stone work, and which when picked up always rolled into a ball and remained quite quiet.\" At the end of February 1898, I was again at Ko Sichang; not one single Millipede was to be seen abroad, but we found a few by searching in damp spots, underneath timber, old tins, etc. This shows how the different seasons affect these animals; and how a locality where in the dry season there seem to be none, in the wet season literally swarms with Millipedes.\n\nAn anonymous writer in a Singapore paper of (23rd) October 1897, gives the following Malay account of the evolution of Millipedes, etc.:\u2014\"There is a belief that if the vertebral bone of a fish is kept under a mattress for some time it becomes a centipede, and that the strands which are found between the pulp and the rind of a plantain, commonly known as pisang klat, when securely bottled up and kept in a dark corner become Millipedes. There is also a belief that a fresh water fish, not unlike the European sly, and known to the natives as 'ekan klee,' is generated from a tadpole.\"\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nKey to Classification of Millipedes.\n\nI. Body furnished with tufts of scale-like hairs. Antennae eight jointed. Scent-glands absent. Sub-class PSELAPHO-GNATHA; contains the single family Polyxenidae, minute millipedes, \"only about one tenth of an inch long\" (Pocock, R. N. H. vol. vi, p. 209), so far not known from the Malay Peninsula.\n\nII. Body not furnished with tufts of scale-like hairs. Antennae seven jointed. Scent-glands usually present. Sub-class CHILOGNATHA; divided into three orders.\n\nA. Body short and broad, 12 or 13 segments, second and last segments enormously enlarged, capable of being rolled into a ball, no scent-glands. Order ONISCOMORPHA.\n\nB. Body elongate, 19 or more segments, none of them very much larger than the rest, capable of being spirally coiled (except Sphaeridesmus).\n\nA. Last back plate forms a hood over the last pair of legs, 19 or 20 segments, no scent-glands, no known species exceeds a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) in length. Order LIMACOMORPHA, contains the single family Glomeridesmidae; a species occurs in Sumatra.\n\nB. Last back plate forms a complete ring, enclosing the anal valves, 19 to over 100 segments, some species exceed 9\u00bd inches (say 250 mm. in length). Order HELMINTHOMORPHA.\n\na' Mandibles degenerate, from about 30 to over 100 segments, species seldom exceed 1\u00bd inch (38 mm.) in length. Sub-order Colobognatha.\n\nb' Mandibles normal.\n\na''. Pedal laminae free, 30 to 32 segments, Sub-order Chordeumoidae. Small Millipedes known from Sumatra, Burmah, etc., but so far not from the Malay Peninsula.\n\nb''. Pedal laminae united to the terga.\n\na'''. From about 30 to over 70 segments, Sub-order Iuloidea.\n\nb'''. 19 or 20 segments, Suborder Polydesmoidea.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nSub-class Chelognatha.\n\nOrder Oniscoomorpha.\n\nShort, robust Millipedes, convex above and flat below, capable of rolling themselves into a ball, hence popularly called \"Pill Millipedes.\" The body consists of 12 or 13 segments, of which the first is very small, the second is enormously expanded at the sides, and the last expended laterally and posteriorly, so as to entirely cover the anal region. Each typical body segment consists of 7 pieces: a large vaulted semi-circular horny plate forming the upper surface, and concealing the legs, beneath this on each side a small pleural plate, and between this and the two legs two still smaller tracheal plates bearing the stigmata, one corresponding to each leg. The legs are in contact in the middle line of the body, and those of the last pair, or last two pairs, are enlarged in the male and transformed into a pair of clasping organs. The back plates are not furnished with scent-pores. Pill-millipedes are found in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australasia; some species attain a length of over 2\u00bd inches (or 60 mm.); they are divided into two families:\n\nA. 12 segments, antennae close together. Glomeridae.\nB. 13 segments, antennae farther apart. Zephronidae.\n\nPill-millipedes may possibly be confounded at first sight with Woodlice, belonging to the Crustacea, and with certain wingless Cockroaches, belonging to the Hexapoda, which both occur in similar localities and surroundings; the cockroach can be at once detected by having only 3 pairs of legs, and the woodlouse by its having only one pair of legs to each segment, instead of two pairs to most segments as in the Millipedes. Moreover, the hinder end of the body in the crustacean is composed of a number of small segments more or less closely crowded together, but in the Pill-millipede the last segment is much enlarged, and acts as a kind of protective cover to the lower side of the body when it is spherically rolled. Of course there are other differential characteristics between the two not less striking than that already mentioned; but it is needless to enter into them here.\" Pocock, J. B. N. H. S. vol. xii, p. 269 (1899).\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nFamily Glomeridae.\n\nPill-millipedes with the antennae relatively close together on the front of the head, eyes with a single (lateral vertical) row of ocelli, a conspicuous horse-shoe shaped \"sensory\" organ between the eyes and the antennae, and the body consisting of twelve segments; they are usually of small size, under 8 of an inch (15 mm.) in length, and are found in England, Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. Though species of Glomeris are known from Tenasserim, Sumatra and Borneo, they have not yet, to my knowledge, been recorded from the Malay Peninsula.\n\nFamily Zephoniidae.\n\nPill-Millipedes with the antennae widely separated, situated completely at the sides of the head, eyes composed of a spherical cluster of ocelli, no \"sensory\" organ on the face between the eyes and the antennae, and the body consisting of thirteen segments; they attain a length of over 2\u00bd inches (say 60 mm.), and are found in Africa, Madagascar, India, Ceylon, Sikkim, Burma, Siam, Cochin China, the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago, Australia and New Zealand. Over sixty species are known, divided into about seven genera. \"A Monograph of the Zephoniidae inhabiting India, Ceylon and Burmah\" by Pocock, will be found in the Journal of the Bombay Nat. His. Society, vol. xii, (1899), pp. 269-285 and 463-474.\n\nGenus Spheropoeus, Brandt.\n\nApex of the legs broad and truncate, the upper angle bearing a long spine above the claw, there being a considerable space between the claw and the spine.\n\n1. *Spheropoeus conatus*, Pocock, A. + M.N.H. Ser. 6, vol. xvi, 1895, p. 412. Recorded from Malacca.\n\n2. *Spheropoeus bimaculatus*, Pocock, A.+M. N. H. Ser. 6, vol. xvi, 1895, p. 412. Recorded from Singapore.\n\nGenus Zephonia, Grny.\n\nApex of the legs narrowed and pointed, the spine and the claw nearly contiguous.\n3. *Zephronia anthracina*, Pocock. A.+M. N. H. Ser. 6, vol. xvi, 1895, p. 413. Entirely black, shining; reaches a length of 52 mm. recorded from Perak.\n\n4. *Zephronia impunctata*, Pocock. A.+M. N. H. Ser. 6, vol. xvi, 1895, p. 413. Pitchy black hinder borders of terga obscurely ferruginous, legs olivaceous; length 36 mm. I found a single specimen (the type) in the jungle near the big waterfall in the Botanical Gardens, Penang, in March 1895.\n\nI got specimens of *Zephronia* also from Singapore, Selangor and Kosichang, of so far undetermined species.\n\nOrder *Helminthomorpha*,\n\nSub-order *Colobognatha*.\n\nSmall Millepedes, largest about 1\u00bd inches (or 40 mm.) in length, with elongate bodies composed of from about 30 to over 100 segments; head often tucked under the first segment; mouth more or less adapted for sucking, the jaws being degenerate; known from England and also from most warm parts of the world; divided into several families.\n\nFamily *Pseudodesmid\u00e6*.\n\n5. *Pseudodesmus verrucosus*, Pocock. A.+M. N. II. Sept.'87, p. 222. Originally described from a Perak specimen, 34 mm. in length. In Sept. '97 I found one specimen of a beautiful pale cream colour at Dumdruan Estate, 700 feet elevation, Gunong Pulai, Johore.\n\n6. *Pseudodesmus* sp. Yellow millipedes, 23 mm. in length. Ten specimens found under logs, etc., in the jungle near Hinlap, 700 feet elevation, and Muok Tek, 900 feet, in the Dong Phya Phai, Siam; November 1897.\n\nSub-order *Iuloidea*.\n\nThis sub-order includes the most typical millipedes, and also the largest, some being nearly 10 inches (254 mm.) in length; it is cosmopolitan. The mandibles are normal, the pedal lamina united to the terga, and there are from about 30 to over 70 segments.\nFamilies Spirostreptidae and Sperobolidae.\n\nThe Millipedes of these two families are numerous in the East Indies both in species and individuals; they may be thus distinguished:\u2014 Spirostreptidae, first three segments with a pair of legs each, fourth legless. Sperobolidae, first four segments with a pair of legs each. The collector will soon get to know the form of eye characteristic of each family, a useful way of distinguishing them, but not infallible, some species having eyes of intermediate shape.\n\nFamily Spirostreptidae.\n\nGenus Spirostreptus.\n\nVentral grooves short; distance between eyes about equal to half the long diameter of an eye.\n\n7. Spirostreptus rutilans, Newport.\n\nPocock has given a coloured figure and description of this species:\u2014\n\nMax Weber, Zool. Ergebnisse III, p. 387, plate xvi, fig. 8 (1894).\n\nThis is a very handsome creature when alive, coloured in alternate bands of black and red-brown. When walking it carries the head low, and the antennae are constantly employed feeling everything the animal approaches. Each leg seems to move independently, thus crossing each other in walking, and apparently impeding any rapid motion. They are usually found in jungle, crawling on tree trunks or on the ground, in the middle of the day, quite fearless of any enemy, and as far as my experience goes, submit quietly to be picked up by a collector. I have found them on Penang Hill from 1100 to 2500 feet elevation (March and Nov. '96), near Chumar, Perak (Dec. '96), and on the Kuala Kangsa Pass, Perak (May '98); this last was the largest specimen I have seen measuring in total length 9\u00bd inches (= 248 mm.).\n\nI also obtained a Spirostreptus of this, or an allied species, at Kulim, Kedah, in 1895; and two specimens near Muok Lek, 900 feet elevation, in the Dong Phya Phai, Siam, in Nov. 1897.\nGenus *Thyropygus*.\n\nVentral grooves long and deep, distance between eyes about equal to or greater than the long diameter of an eye.\n\n8. *Thyropygus perakensis*, Pocock.\n\n*Spirostreptus perakensis*, Pocock, Linn. S. J. Zool. xxiv, p. 322 (head figured). [1892].\n\nThe type specimen, from Perak, was presented to the British Museum by Mr. J. H. Leech; it is described as a male, 210 mm. in length, with 69 segments, and in colour polished black, with antennae and legs reddish yellow.\n\n9. *Thyropygus bowringii*, Pocock.\n\n*Spirostreptus bowringi*, Pocock, Linn. S. J. Zool. xxiv, p. 321 (head fig. p. 322) [1892].\n\nDuring the rainy season this species is very plentiful in Siam, coming out usually towards evening and wandering about gardens and paths, and also occasionally entering houses; during the rest of the year it seems to quite disappear, presumably it hides away in holes. I have met it in the following localities:\n\n- Bangkok (May, June, July and August).\n- Ayuthia (June).\n- Pachim (April).\n- Kosichang (August).\n\nAdults, of both sexes, have from 60 to 72 segments. The longest male I measured was about $5\\frac{3}{4}$ inches (148 mm.), the longest female about $8\\frac{1}{2}$ inches (or 220 mm.).\n\nColour (from life), drawn up from a large series of Bangkok specimens.\n\nThe whole animal is of a very rich warm yellow ochre, with these exceptions:\u2014the front surface of the head is a rich red-yellowish brown, sometimes darker between the eyes, it also gets darker towards the mouth shading into black on the upper lip. The antennae are rich red-yellowish brown. The eyes black. The first segment behind the head is rich red-yellowish brown, getting darker towards its posterior edge. The remaining segments have each on their posterior part a very dark brown band, in some individuals pure glistering black, this band gets narrower and lighter in colour underneath as it approaches\nthe bases of the legs, and is broadest on the centre of the back, where it is about twice the width of the intervening yellow spaces. The tail (last segment) is yellow, on its broader portion obscurely banded once with reddish-brown, and the hinder portion (as for instance the sides of the anal valves) are picked out with reddish brown, the sharp tip of the tail is, in some specimens, black. The legs are more or less shaded with light-reddish brown, differing in individuals. The position of the foramen-repugnatorum is marked on the sides of the somites by a dark grey half-moon shaped line.\n\nThese big Thyropagi when caught in the hand do not passively submit as most millipedes do, but twist about, rear up their heads, and bite one's fingers with their jaws, but of course without breaking the skin or hurting in the least; but their show of resistance is so vigorous that anyone unaware of their harmless character would naturally not attempt to touch them twice.\n\nI have kept many individuals of this species in captivity; they feed readily on bananas, etc., but never seem to stop eating as long as food is available. One I noted (as far as I was able to attend to it) eat without stopping for fifteen hours on end. The difficulty of keeping them alive is to strike the medium between starving them and allowing them to overeat themselves, which results in a week or so in diarrhoea, and then death soon supervenes. While eating the lower jaws work away steadily with a lateral in and out motion, and all the time the antennae keep moving, examining every bit of food just before it enters the mouth. The females seem always ready to eat, but the males (in the early summer in Bangkok) suffer much from sexual excitement, refuse to feed and become very pugnacious.\n\nIn the jungle near Hlalap, 700 feet elevation, in the Dong Phya Phai, Siam, I obtained three specimens of a Thyropagus, T. boerriana of an allied form, in November 1897. A male was 195 mm. in length, a female 180. The female rolled up quietly when picked up, the male struggled hard, rearing its head up off the ground and trying to bite.\n\n10. Thyropagus sp.\n\nAt about 300 feet elevation on Bukit Timah, Singapore, on the 12th Jan. 1896, I found one crawling among dead leaves in\nthe jungle at midday. It was about 9 inches in length (230 mm.) I have also found large Thyropygi in Johore, from near sea-level near Johore Bahru, to 1000 feet elevation on Gunong Pulai.\n\n11. *Thyropygus* sp.\n\nAnother species of this genus I have found very numerous on Penang Hill from 2200 to 2500 feet elevation; it reaches 4\u00bd inches in length (114 mm.). Its colour, when alive, is as follows: upper parts dark olive brown, with transverse bands of lighter and darker brown, there is a pale yellowish-brown vertebral line, which interrupts the narrow dark brown bands but not the wider paler bands. The lower parts and legs are pale reddish yellow.\n\nFamily *Spirobolidae*.\n\nGenus *Trigoniulus*.\n\nLabral peres 2+2. First dorsal plate acutely angled.\n\n12. *Trigoniulus go\u00ebsii* (Porat).\n\nThis small round red Millipede is extensively distributed in the East and West Indies, and has got introduced into conservatories in England. I found it numerous in:\n\nSingapore; Spring of 1896, October 1897.\nPenang; Botanical Gardens, March 1898.\nPenang; the Crag, 2260 feet elev., March and Nov. 1899, March 1898.\nPerak; Taipeng, May 1898; Kuala Kangsa Pass and Batu Gajah, Dec. 1896.\nKedah; Alor Star, June 1898; and I found an allied species near Kulim, Kedah, in May 1895.\n\n13. *Trigoniulus* sp. The red-legged Trigoniulus.\n\nThis species was very numerous in Bangkok during the rainy season from April to August, and was also numerous on Kosichang. In Bangkok in June specimens were observed copulating.\n\nThe number of segments of adults varies from 55 to 60. Males reach 74 mm. in length, females 80 mm.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nColour (from life), drawn up from many Bangkok specimens. Head red, except forehead between the eyes which is brown. First segment (behind head), brown, anterior border red, posterior border pale reddish brown. Remaining segments brown, posterior border very pale brown, reddish on the back, yellowish at the sides, underneath (about bases of legs) pale yellow. Tail (i.e., last segment) red, shading to brown at the sides. Antennae, mouth and legs, red. The red of the head, legs, etc., is a rich brick red. The brown of the body is a dark brown, dull in some lights, in others more grey than brown with distinct purple shades in it. In spirits the whole colouring becomes darker and less conspicuous. At any rate, in some cases the males are more purplish-grey in colour, and the females (who are also larger) are more reddish-brown.\n\nII. Trigonulus sp. The blue-green and red Trigonulus.\n\nOf this very beautiful species, apparently undescribed but allied to T. candolleanus of Karsch, I got three specimens in the jungle south of Talakaman, Siam, on the 19th March 1897. The number of segments varied from 48 to 52, and the largest individual was 6.1 mm. in length.\n\nColour (from life). Upper surfaces and sides pale bluish bottle green, each segment with a broad, distinct, black transverse band; along each side is a very narrow black line enlarged into a black spot on each segment; from the eighth segment to the penultimate one the back is bright brick-red; this red line is narrow anteriorly and gets broadest about the middle of the back. The head between the eyes is darkish French grey; the remainder of the head, anterior border of the segment next behind the head, the whole of the legs, and the last segment and tail are bright brick red, the lower surface of the body (between the legs) is yellowish red.\n\nGenus Sparobolellus.\n\nLabral pores 1 + 1. First dorsal plate very large, expanded laterally.\n\nIII. Sparobolellus sp. The white-legged Millipede.\n\nThis elegant, elongated Millipede, with its conspicuous little white legs, is one of the most active members of the Class.\nWe found it fairly common at Pachim in March and April 1897, and in Bangkok in May, June and July. This species is particularly addicted to walking up the vertical walls of houses at night.\n\nI also obtained a species of Spiroboletus in Singapore in 1896.\n\nSub-order Polydesmoidca.\n\nThe Flat-Millipedes are distributed all over the habitable world. They attain to a length of 3\u00bd inches (134 mm.), the number of segments is always 19 or 20. They have no eyes. The pedal laminae are united to the terga. The large platelike processes springing from the sides of the segments easily distinguish these Millipedes from those of the other sub-orders.\n\nFamily Platychauchidae.\n\nMillipedes of large or medium size, in which the body is composed of 20 segments, each segment except the first and last being furnished on each side with a large, more or less square and horizontal plate, which bears the scent-pore; they occur in tropical America and Asia, and attain a length of 134 mm.\n\n16. Acanthodesmus pinangensis, Pocock. A. + M. N. II. Ser. vi 1897, vol. 20, p. 433, Fig. 6 + 6a, p. 431.\n\nThe type specimen, a male, was obtained by Mr. H. N. Ridley; subsequently in March 1898, I also caught a specimen at 1300 feet elevation on Penang Hill.\n\n17. Acanthodesmus perakensis, Pocock l.c.s. p. 434, Fig. 7, p. 431. Obtained in Perak by Mr. J. H. Leech.\n\n18. Acanthodesmus petersii, Pocock, l.c.s. p. 434, Fig. 8, p. 431. The type species, a male, is from the Malay Peninsula.\n\n19. Acanthodesmus lineatus, Pocock, l.c.s. p. 434, Fig. 9, p. 431. This specimen was discovered by Mr. H. N. Ridley in Singapore.\n\nWhen in the Larut Hills in April 1898 I collected a large series of Millipedes of this family, representing two hitherto undescribed species of Acanthodesmus, and two species of a new\ngenus allied to Acanthodermus; all the specimens being now in the British Museum I am unable to describe them here. Every individual (thirteen were collected) of one species of Acanthodermus had a faint but distinct and pleasant smell, like \"vanilla\" or \"bitter almonds.\" These Millipedes are all very slow in their movements and easily caught.\n\n20. Phractodermus ridleyi, Pocock, l.c.s. p. 438.\n\nThe type specimen, a female, was obtained by Mr. H. X. Ridley in Singapore. Another species of Phractodermus, P. subtritatus (Peters) has been recorded from the island of Singa.\n\n21. Anoplodermus sp.\n\nI found one specimen of this genus on rotten wood in the Botanical Gardens, Penang, 21st Nov., 1896. Colour: upper parts shiny black, prominences at sides bright yellow. Lower surface and legs, reddish brown.\n\nFamily Stauroplosomatidae.\n\nMillipedes of small size, reaching 35 mm. in length, occurring in tropical America, Africa and Asia, and also in Europe (England).\n\n22. Orthomorpha coarctata (Saussure).\n\nA widely distributed species in the East Indies, I have met with it in Singapore, Kedah and Bangkok. In the latter place during the month of May, June and July I had opportunities of watching the development of individuals. The smallest I got were 2 mm. in length, cylindrical in section, had 19 segments, were covered with fine bristles of hair and were pure white in colour, except for a pair of reddish-brown spots above the base of the antennae. As the animal grows the hind portions become dark first, and upper greyish brown, then the head and forepart become a reddish-brown, the centre portion gradually following suit: these changes of colour will be observed in animals of from 8 to 12 mm. in length. In individuals of 10 mm. long the body is still cylindrical but the lateral processes are becoming pronounced, and the general colour is now pale yellow, the dorsal plates being pale reddish brown; there is also a reddish-brown patch on the head at the\nbase of the antennae. The whole Millipede is still sparsely clad with hair, but the hairs are less numerous and much shorter in proportion to the bulk of the animal than in the 2 mm. stage. When the Millipede is about 18 mm. in length all the upper surface is a rich dark-reddish brown, the sides are a paler reddish brown, and the underneath, legs, antennae, tail and lateral processes are bright yellow. The whole animal looks neat and glossy, there are scarcely any hairs on the body except a few large ones under the tail, and many very short, fine hairs on the head, antennae and legs; and it is at this period that the body becomes slightly depressed.\n\nI observed this species in copula in Bangkok in May 1897, the males seem rather smaller than the females when they clasp by the forepart of the body, and suffer themselves to be dragged along.\n\n23. Orthomorpha Vicaria, Karsch.\n\nI found large numbers of this species on the walls of the Government Rest House, Kuala Kangsa, Perak, 10th Dec. 1896.\n\n24. Orthomorpha crucifera, Pocock.\n\nThis species known from the Mergui Archipelago probably also occurs in Penang; I have collected Millipedes, apparently referable to it, on rocks near \"the Crag,\" 2263 feet elevation above sea, in March and November 1896. Specimens reached a length of 33 mm. (1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches); and their colour in life was, upper parts reddish brown, with dark brown centre line, and narrow transverse dark brown lines, three on each somite, one being central and two marginal. The lateral processes are rich very dark brown, their backward projecting spines being yellow. Sides of body very dark brown, underneath of body buff. Legs yellow.\n\n25. Orthomorpha gracilis.\n\nI got one specimen at Ayuthia: February 1888.\n\nOther specimens, some probably representing other species of Orthomorpha, I have collected at Chantaboon, Tahkamen and in the Larut Hills of Perak up to 4000 feet elevation, but the most noticeable was a black and scarlet form I found in the jungle near Muok Lek, Dong Phya Phai, Siam, in November 1897.\nIV. Class Symphyla.\n\nFamily Scolependrellidae.\n\nScolependrella sp. novet.\n\nIn May, June and July 1897, I found Scolependrella very numerous in the Wang Na garden at Bangkok; they could usually be found under flower-pots. They were most elegant little creatures, about 5 mm. in length (not including the antennae), very active, and required careful catching to get them alive and undamaged. We found the best way was to drive them into a test-tube by means of a camel-hair paint brush.\n\nThey were pure dead white in colour when alive.\n\nThe antennae are long, slender and conspicuous; they usually resemble a row of beads threaded on a string, but in one specimen I examined the left antenna was normal and consisted of 23 bead-like joints, but the right antenna was less than half as long, apparently unjointed, enlarged and rounded at the tip and covered with distally directed hairs (unlike the hairs on normal antennae which radiate from the centre of each \"bead\"). These little animals can suspend themselves in the air by a silk line, after the manner of spiders.\n\nOn the 22nd November 1897, I found a Scolependrella under a log in the jungle near Muok Lek, in the Dang Phya Phai.\n\nV. Chilopoda.\n\nThe Centipedes, Class Chilopoda, are invertebrate animals found in all temperate and tropical regions, carnivorous, active and capable of giving a poisonous bite. Some are nearly one foot (305 mm.) in length.\n\nHead. The head is distinct and has a pair of elongate antennae in front and four pairs of jaws on its lower surface. The 4th pair are large and powerful and project forward below the other pairs of jaws, so as to more or less conceal them from view. The last segment of this 4th pair forms a long fang with a minute hole in the tip, through which the poison is exuded.\n\nBody. The body is elongated, very flattened in section and consists of from 15 to over 121 segments all much alike in structure.\nLegs. The legs start from the sides of the lower surface of the body, there is only one pair to each segment, the last pair of legs is generally longer than the rest. The number of pairs of legs is invariably odd.\n\nNative Names for Centipedes.\n\nMalay, \"Halipan\" or \"Lipan.\"\nSiamese, \"Takhap.\"\n\nCentipedes are divided into two sub-classes:\n\n1st. ANARTIOSTIGMA.\n\n1. eyes, large, compound, faceted.\n2. antennae, widely separated at base, very long, thread-like.\n3. body, composed of 15 segments, but only 8 dorsal plates, all of which, except the last, are furnished in the middle of the hinder border with a single large respiratory stigma.\n4. legs, very long, their tarsi composed of a large number of minute segments.\n5. basal-segments of poison-jaws not united.\n\nLength of head and body (exclusive of antennae and legs) reaches over 2 inches (or 55 mm.) contains only one genus Scutigera.\n\n2nd. ARTIOSTIGMA.\n\n1. eyes, simple ocelli, or entirely absent.\n2. antennae, shorter, stouter and not thread-like.\n3. body, composed of from 15 to over 121 segments, each having its own dorsal plate; the stigmata are arranged in pairs and open on the sides of the body.\n4. legs, of moderate length, usually tipped with a claw.\n5. basal-segments of poison-jaws united to form a coxal plate. Length of head and body (exclusive of antennae and legs) reaches over 11 inches (or 281 mm.) divided into three orders, with many families and genera.\n\n* These dimensions only refer to the largest specimens I have myself measured; they may grow larger.\n\n\u2020 In the family Cermatobiidae (Order Lithobiomorpha), known from a single species from Halmahera, the tarsi of the legs are many jointed. Vide Pocock, Royal Nat. Hist. vi., p. 205.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nSub-class Anastomostigma.\nOrder Scutigeromorpha.\nFamily Scutigeridae.\n\n1. *Scutigera longicornis*, Fabr. The long-horned Shield-bearer.\n\n*Localities.* I have met this fine species in three localities, in each case under quite different circumstances. One was inside a rotten, fallen tree-trunk near the foot of Gunong Pulai, Johore, 13th September, 1897. One I found at night on the outside wall of my house in Bangkok, on the 27th February 1897. And on the 28th June 1898, I saw large numbers of the Centipedes, perhaps 30 or 40 individuals in less than two hours, in deep caverns (where no daylight ever penetrates) of the Batu Caves, near Kuala Lumpur, Selangor; these were easily caught in forceps, if one picked them up as soon as the torch-light showed them, but once disturbed they did not give a second chance of being captured but ran along the wall at immense speed. This species occurs in Java, as well as in Siam and the Malay Peninsula.\n\n*Colour* (of Bangkok specimen mentioned above).\n\nUpper surface of body moderately dark brown, at the posterior end of each dorsal plate is a double spot of light yellow (very distinct in life). Head yellowish brown with dark brown markings. Antennae uniform yellowish brown. Legs yellow with narrow bands of dark bluish-grey. Lower surface of body pale yellow. In life the whole animal is slightly iridescent.\n\n| Size          | Bangkok specimen | Batu Caves specimen |\n|---------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Length, head and body | 32 mm. or 1.28 inch.* | 55 mm. or 2.16 in. |\n| antennae      | 64               | 88                  |\n| hind-legs     | 70               | 187                 |\n| from tip of antennae to end of hind-legs | 16+               | 325                 |\n\n2. *Scutigera burmana*, Poe. The Burmese Shield-Bearer.\n\n*Localities.* On the 16th March 1896 I caught two specimens at the \"Crag,\" Penang Hill, elevation 2260 feet; and subse-\n\n*End of body projects 2 mm. beyond base of hind legs.*\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nquietly in March 1898 obtained a third specimen at the same place. They are exceedingly active, running so fast that unless you know them by sight it is hard to tell what sort of animals they are; if found at rest they may be picked up with a pair of forceps or else made to walk into a wide-necked cyanide-of-potassium bottle, but if first frightened all you will probably see of them is a glimpse of (apparently) a spider with an improper number of very attenuated legs disappearing round the corner. It is very difficult to secure a perfect specimen, as when caught they seem to shed their legs voluntarily, almost as if to spite the collector.\n\nDistrict. Burma and Penang.\n\n3. *Scutigera marmorea*, Poc. The Marbled Shield-Bearer.\n\nLocalities. On the 14th March 1896 I caught one specimen under the bark of a tree at \"Richmond,\" Penang Hill, elevation about 2300 feet; its general colour was reddish-brown. In March 1898 I got another specimen also on Penang Hill at nearly the same height above sea-level.\n\nDistrict. Burma and Penang.\n\nSub-class *Artiostigma*.\n\n1st Order, *Lithobiomorpha*. 15 pairs of legs.\n\nContains only the Family *Lithobiidae*. Species of *Lithobius* are known to occur in Java, Sumatra, Burmah and possibly the Nicobar Islands, so will probably be eventually found in the Malay Peninsula; the largest of the known S. E. Asian forms is only $12\\frac{1}{2}$ mm. long.\n\n2nd Order, *Scolopendromorpha*. 21 or 23 pairs of legs.\n\nEyes, either absent or consist of 4 ocelli on each side of the head.\n\nAntennae, 17 to 29 segments.\n\nDivided into several families.\n\nThe usual centipedes met with in Malaya and Siam all come into the family *Scolopendridae*, which have 21 pairs of legs, 4 eyes on each side of head, and reach nearly a foot (305 mm.) in length.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\n3rd Order. GEOPHILOMORPHA. 39 to 161 (or possibly more) pairs of legs.\nEyes, absent.\nAntennae, 14 segments.\n\nThis order consists of long, thin, worm-like centipedes; some species are at times luminous; they are divided into several families, and individuals reach 130 mm. in length.\n\nOrder Scutopendromorpha.\nFamily Scutopenidae.\n\n1. Scutopendra subspinosus, Leach. Common Centipede of S. E. Asia.\n\nLocalities. Of this species I got several specimens in Penang both from near sea-level (Sepoy Lines) and from the hill (\"Crag\"), one in Singapore, one in Johore Bahru, one in Bangkok, and one received from Sourabaya, Java; it also occurs in Sumatra and Flores, and is found (possibly introduced) in tropical Africa and in the West Indies.\n\nColour. Most individuals I have seen were bright reddish brown, but the Johore specimen (mentioned above) and one from Penang Hill were purplish-black above, pale reddish-brown below and had reddish antennae and legs.\n\nSize. The red and the black individuals seem to attain equal dimensions, the largest I have measured was in length (exclusive of antennae and hind-legs) 160 mm. or 6\u00bd in.\n\n2. Scutopendra de haani, Brandt. De Haan's Centipede.\n\nThis may be only a variety of S. subspinosus from which it differs in the absence of spines from the under surface of the anal femora.\n\nLocalities. I got several specimens from the hills of Penang, at about 2300 feet elevation; one from Batu Gajah, Perak; four from Kulim, Kedah; and about thirty from the following places in Siam\u2014Bangkok, Ko-si-chang, Chantaboon, Kahin and Muok Sek, in the Dong Phay Phai; it also occurs in the Mentawi Archipelago, Java and Sumatra.\n\nColour (from life.) Above rich reddish-brown, antennae paler reddish-brown; legs pale yellow, distally dark reddish-\nbrown, claws black; hind-legs reddish brown, getting darker distally, last segments nearly black; underneath of head reddish brown, last joint of poison-fangs black; lower surface of body brownish yellow.\n\nA young specimen from Kabin was black with orange-red legs and a broad orange-red band behind the head.\n\nA centipede 53 mm. (say 2 inches) in length (excluding antennae or hindlegs), which Pocock considers to be probably the young of this species, had the upper parts reddish-brown, but the posterior part of each segment very dark, nearly black; the antennae, head and first two segments of body olive green; legs on remaining segments pale red; and the under surface pale reddish-brown.\n\nSize. The finest De Haan's Centipede I have measured was caught in our compound in Bangkok, 19th December, 1897.\n\nIts dimensions were:\u2014\n\n| Total length, from tip of antennae to claw of hind foot | 281 mm. |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Length, without antennae or hind legs                  | ...     |\n| \" antennae                                            | ...     |\n| \" hind-leg                                             | ...     |\n| Width, 2nd segment                                     | ...     |\n| \" 15th                                                 | ...     |\n| \" 21st                                                 | ...     |\n| \" 22nd (last)                                          | ...     |\n\nThese two species, supposing them to be distinct, seem similar in habits; they are for the most part nocturnal, but I have met them roaming abroad in the daytime; they are to be found in houses and gardens as well as in the jungle, and even on board ship. They run very swiftly, and try to bite fiercely when interfered with; what the effect of their bite on a man could be I do not know, I only once saw one bitten\u2014Surgeon-Captain Smith at Penang in 1895. He felt no ill effects from the bite, but the centipede had previously been biting at some cord, in a loop of which we were trying to secure it, so had probably exhausted its supply of poison. It is said that their claws are poisonous, and I have even been told in Singapore that a centipede ran over a man's face and left a line of bad sores where its feet touched his skin. I cannot believe this\u2014for I have seen Malays allowing a big centipede (with poison fangs extracted) to run about their\nbare shoulders and neck without receiving any harm, and I have myself had them crawling over my hands as an experiment but without being able to see, or feel, the smallest wound. Nothing seems to be known about their breeding habits. In Penang I have seen a dead centipede hung from the front axle-tree of a gharry\u2014why this is done I have no idea; perhaps other members of the Society have noticed this?\n\n6. *Scolopendra Morsitans* (Lin.) The Biting Centipede.\n\nI caught specimens of this species at Gunung Pulai in Johore, and at Kabin in Siam, received one from near Raheng, Siam. The Kabin specimen was purplish-green in colour, and measured in length (without hind legs) 71 mm. (with hind legs) 82\u00bd mm. Dr. Max Weber obtained this species in Celebes, Saleyer and Flores. It is also found in central Africa and other tropical countries.\n\n7. *Onstigmus sceler*, Porat. The Rough Centipede.\n\n\" Takhip-fai\" (fine-centipede) of the Siamese.\n\n*Localities.* I found this species numerous in Bangkok under flower pots in the garden of the Wang Na, and also got specimens on Gunong Pulai, Johore.\n\n*Colour* (Bangkok specimens). Above reddish-brown, redder on the margins, browner in the vertebral line; the anterior portion of the head sometimes black; lower surface of body pale reddish-yellow; eyes black; antennae light-red or else basal portion reddish-brown, turning darker distally till the tips are almost black; legs, basal segment and greater portion of next segment buff, remainder rich dark blue, or in some specimens the legs are grey, basally bright blue, distally buff, the hindmost pair of legs are blue banded with pale buff or white at the joints.\n\n*Size* (Bangkok specimens). The largest I noted measured 48 mm. in length, without including the hind-legs.\n\nAnother was:\n\n- Length, without antennae or hind legs, 31\u00bd mm.\n- Antennae 9 \"\n- Hindlegs 12\u00bd \"\nI also collected specimens of *Otostigmus* on Penang Hill, in the Larut Hills of Perak, in Johore, at Chantaboon (purplish-blue in colour) and at Paknam-Menam, which are difficult to determine specifically, as there are many species of this genus described from Ceylon, Japan, China, Mergui Archipelago, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, Flores, etc.\n\n8. *Rhysida longipes* (Newport).\n\nI got two specimens at Tanglin, Singapore, one found under a flower-pot, one running about in my bathroom at night, and several from Siam, from near Raheng and from the island of Ko-si-chang. This centipede usually has its back coloured dark reddish or purplish-brown, the legs may be lighter; it is of small size reaching a length of 68 mm. (2.68 inches). It is distributed in many parts of tropical Asia and America.\n\n9. *Rhysida immarginata* (Porat).\n\nOf this small species I got six specimens near Alor Star, Kedah; one in Taipeng, Perak; a friend found it climbing up his leg inside his trousers; and two in Singapore, one in the Officers' Mess, Tanglin, and one in a bathroom of Raffles Hotel. In these centipedes the antennae, when not in use, are carried curled up very elegantly. Dr. Max Weber obtained this species in Sumatra, Java and Saleyer.\n\n10. *Rhysida carinulata* (Haase.)\n\nIn January 1896 Mr. Ridley and I found one of these rare centipedes on Bukit Timah, Singapore; it was a female lying curled up round its eggs, hidden under a rock in the jungle. The species was previously known from Celebes.\n\n11. *Rhysida rugulosa*, Pocock.\n\nThis species is described and figured (nat-size) by Pocock in Max Weber's Zool. Ergebnisse III, p. 314, Pl. xix, Fig. 6. The type specimen is from Sumatra. In November 1896 I caught one in the garden of \"the Crag,\" Penang Hill, 2200 feet elevation; its colours were:\u2014back purplish black; antennae\nand legs bottle green; underneath pale olive green. Length (excluding antennae and hind feet) 85 mm. (3.33 inches.)\n\nI also got specimens of *Rhysodes* from Blakan Mati, Singapore, and from Chantaboon, that apparently do not fall into any of the above species.\n\nOrder *Gonophoromorpho*.\nFamily *Gonophoridae*.\n\n12. *Orphnus brevithorax* (Newport). The Luminous Centipede-Malay Klomayer.\n\nI have caught this long, thin red centipede at Tahkansen, Siam, in March 1897, in Government House, Singapore, October 1897, and in Bakar Rata House, Kedah, in May 1898; always in roofs or upper stories of houses. On more than one occasion, I have seen them at night on my mosquito curtains. Each time I tested their luminosity; when disturbed they give out a bright but lurid green \"phosphorescent\" light, and as the centipede moves it leaves a trail of light behind it on the surface it is crawling over; this trail glimmers for a moment or so, and then goes out.\n\nBesides Siam and the Malay Peninsula this species occurs in other parts of the Oriental Region (Mergui Archipelago, Java, Celebes, Flores, etc.) and also in tropical America.\n\nFamily *Direthophilidae*.\n\n13. *Maistercephalus punctatus*, Newport.\n\nOf this long, thin centipede I got four specimens in the earth at Chantaboon in January 1898 (no luminosity observed), and also found a single individual under a piece of wood on the top of Western Hill, Penang, elevation 2725 feet. This latter measured:\u2014\n\nlength (excluding antennae and hind legs) 52 mm.\n(including antennae and legs) 63 mm.\n\nThis species is also recorded from the Mergui Archipelago, Sumatra, Java, Flores and Mauritius.\n\nFamily *Euratonychidae*.\n\nSpecies of *Euratonyx* may eventually be found in Malaya as they occur in Burmese territory on the one side, and in islands at the Eastern end of the Malay Archipelago on the other.\nVI. Class Gigantostraca.\n\nOrder Xiphosura.\nFamily Limulidae.\n\nThe King Crabs, or Horse-shoe Crabs.\n\"Mengdahn-nam\" of the Sianese.\n\"Belangkas\" of the Malays.\n\n1. *Limulus moluccanus*.\n\nI have got live specimens in the Singapore Market on the 5th April, in the Bangkok Market 18th June, and in Brunei, Borneo, on the 2nd October.\n\nI was told in Siam that the King-Crabs usually frequent deep water, but in June, July and August resort to the shallows at the head of the Gulf for breeding purposes; they are then caught in large numbers for the markets. They will live for a few days in a tub of fresh water.\n\nIn life the carapace is a beautiful, rich, dark, shining, olive colour.\n\nThe largest specimen I measured (at Bangkok) was:\n\n- Total length, 19.7 inches = 500 mm.\n- Length of carapace, 10.2 \" = 259 \"\n- \" tail, 9.5 \" = 241 \"\n- Width, \" carapace, 10.2 \" = 259 \"\n\n2. *Limulus rotundicauda*.\n\nEasily distinguished from *L. moluccanus* by the round shaped tail.\n\nTo be seen for sale in the Bangkok Market with the above.\n\nThe largest specimen I measured (at Bangkok) was:\n\n- Total length, 15.25 inches = 387 mm.\n- Length of carapace, 8 \" = 203 \"\n- \" tail, 7.25 \" = 184 \"\n- Width, \" carapace, 7.75 \" = 197 \"\n\n3. *Limulus tridentatus*, Leach.\n\nAlso known as *Limulus longispinis*. Mr. A. C. Cluneis Ross gave me a large pair caught at Kudat, Brit. North Borneo: the female was the largest and measured:\u2014total length 35.25 inches = 894 mm., width of carapace 15 inches = 381 mm.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nVII. Class Arachnida.\n\nIn this class are included the Spiders, Scorpions, Mites, Ticks and their relatives.\n\nThese animals have no distinct head, the head and thorax being fused together, and the result of this union (called the \"cephalothorax\") and the abdomen may or may not be segmented.\n\nBreathing is carried on by air-tubes, lungs, books or both.\n\nThe sexes are distinct individuals.\n\nThere are no antennae, such as exist in the insects, centipedes and myriapods.\n\nThe cephalothorax bears six pairs of limbs.\u2014\n\n1st pair (the mandibles) composed of 2 or 3 segments, acting as seizing or biting organs.\n\n2nd pair (the chelae, or palpi) composed of 5 or 6 segments; of which the basal segments (the maxillae) are used for crushing food, and the remainder variously modified as seizing, feeling or sexual organs.\n\n3rd pair, composed of 6 or more segments, used for feeling (as in the Pedipalps), or for walking.\n\n4th, 5th, and 6th, composed of 6 to 9 segments, used for walking.\n\nThe abdomen bears no true limbs.\n\nThe class may be divided into 8 orders, one of these contains the Mites, Ticks and a varied host of small forms, some very degenerate, in some various limbs are lost, in some there are apparently no organs of respiration, and in the \"Water Bears,\" or \"Hydropsyche,\" the sexes are not distinct but are united in each individual.\n\nThe following table may be of use to the collector in determining to which Order an Arachnid beast he may happen to have caught, belongs.\n\nA. 2nd pair of limbs modified into great seizing organs (chelae).\n\n1. no \"waist\" between cephalothorax and abdomen.\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th pairs of limbs of similar construction and used for walking.\n\na. posterior segments of abdomen narrowed, forming a distinct jointed tail, ending in a poison-spring.\nbreathing by means of 4 pairs of lung books.\nabdominal combs present.\nno silk-secreting glands.\nsome species attain a length of 8 inches.\n\n(Scorpions).

S. B. R. A. S., No. 26, 1894, p. 41.)\n\nThe true Scorpions have four pairs of legs of similar con-\nstruction, each composed of seven segments, and used for loco-\nmotion, and two modified anterior pairs of limbs, one (the chelae) forming great pincers and composed of six segments, and one (the mandibles) forming small pincers and composed of only three segments.\n\nThe abdomen is distinctly segmented, and the last six segments are narrower than the rest, forming a distinct tail; the last segment of all (the telson) ends in a sharply pointed poison-sting.\n\nOn the lower surface of the second segment of the abdomen are a pair of comb-like organs (the pectines); the exact use of which does not seem to be known, but I have noticed scorpions are continually moving them about as if they were organs of touch.\n\nScorpions are divided into several families; two of which occur in our region and may be thus distinguished:\n\n1st. *Buthidae*. Sternum of the cephalothorax small and triangularly pointed in front.\n\nTwo spurs on the articular membrane of the tarsus.\n\n2nd. *Scorpionidae*.

The Sharp Scorpion.\n\n\"Menypon takkepp\" of the Siamese.\n\nThis small yellowish scorpion is widely distributed in the East, being recorded from Burma, Siam, Cambodia, Cochin China, China, Japan, Philippines, Sumatra, Java, Flores, Saleyer, and it is said from New Zealand and Madagascar. Pocock has given an excellent coloured figure of this species, natural size in Max Weber's Zool. Ergebnisse III, Pl. vi, fig. 1, (published at Leyden, 1893.)\n\nScorpions of this species are to be found inside and outside houses, both downstairs and upstairs, as well as in gardens and in the jungle; they spend the day hidden in crevices, or under stones, rocks, etc., and at night roam about for food; they run about the walls of houses with ease, but I doubt their being able to cross ceilings, as the house-lizards of the family *Geckonidae* do.\nIn Bangkok I found this species very common, and also caught specimens at Ayutthaya, in the Dong Phya Phi at Kalim, at Chanthaburi, and on the island of Ko-Sichang.\n\nWhen suddenly found under a stone they seem to seek safety rather than remaining persistently motionless than in taking instant flight.\n\nI have witnessed them eating crickets and moths; possibly they will eat any insects they can catch and overpower, but I have watched them, one after another, leave unmolested, though hungry, a host of crickets and a small green bag. On several occasions I have placed these scorpions with whip-scorpions (Heteropoda venatoria) and with large spiders (Heteropoda venatoria) to see if they would try to tackle other Arachnida, but I found the three sorts all left one another alone. I have not observed them even attempt to feed on insects they have not killed themselves, nor to pay any attention to trout. \"I do not know if they ever drink. I find an entry in my diary for the 26th December, 1897.\u2014\"A. macromelus caught on the 15th of this month is still alive and well. It has had no water all the time.\" Unfortunately I find no note as to the further career of this scorpion, or how long it lived in captivity. When walking this species often has the combs extended and pointed forward. It seems quite blind (at any rate in a full light), it runs swiftly with both chela extended, but if an upright thing, such as a stick which the chela pass on each side of without touching, is met with, the scorpion runs right into it and is pulled up short, just as a man feeling for the door in the dark with outstretched arms may, if the door be standing open, suddenly find himself hit in the face by it, but on the other hand I have seen a scorpion pursue a fluttering insect, but this may have been by sound (or smell).\n\nThe following extract from my diary of the 15th December 1897 will give some idea of how these animals feed.\n\n\"A. macromelus: in the evening I watched it sitting quite still, body very flat on the ground, chela extended, tail curved over back with the point of the stung carefully protected in the usual manner; a small moth settled near it, the scorpion immediately seized the moth in both chela and quick as lightning brought its tail over its head, stung the moth and recovered...\"\nits tail to the 'rest' position, it then placed the moth's head to its jaws and ate it off, holding the moth in its chelae and tugging off pieces with its mandibles; after a few bites the scorpion ran off holding the moth in one chelae; on the way another small moth came just by it, the scorpion promptly seized it in the disengaged chelae, and again quick as a thought its tail was thrown forward and again withdrawn; it then ran on with a moth in either hand, when it met a third moth the scorpion transferred the first moth to its mandibles and with the chelae thus disengaged it attempted to seize the live moth but it fluttered on; the scorpion, pursuing with one moth in its jaws, one moth in one hand and the other hand grabbing at the third moth, was decidedly comical, it failed to catch the third moth, and after running a little way settled down to eat its captives; the first moth was eaten wings and all, only one lower wing and four legs being left, which may have been dropped accidentally, it then began eating the second moth but after a time (whether anything frightened it or not I do not know) the scorpion dropped the moth and ran off; after some minutes another live moth came in its way which it seized and commenced eating; while doing so it caught another, and again ran off carrying one moth in its jaws and one in its hand.\"\n\nEffect of Sting.\n\nTwo cases of scorpion sting have come under my notice: each time the scorpion was caught and identified as *Archisomus murronatus*.\n\n1st. 27th Nov. 1897. Basdeooh, a native of India, accidentally put his hand on a scorpion which stung him in the finger; he said he had very great pain all up the hand and arm as far as the shoulder; he applied a small native poultice which somewhat relieved the pain. This happened at 6 a.m. At 7.30 a.m. the finger was very swollen, but not appreciably discoloured, he said there was then no pain above the elbow but it was very bad in the forearm and hand; we got him to put the injured finger in a strong solution of permanganate of potash and keep it there for half an hour, first opening the wound by squeezing it; by 8.30 a.m. he was all right again.\n\n2nd. 26th December 1897. Maa Deng, Siamese woman, stung in her foot in the evening; the effect was at once a rather\nswollen foot and much pain; we were able to bathe the foot almost immediately in a very strong solution of permanganate of potash and the pain subsided in a quarter of an hour.\n\n**Colour.**\n\nYellow mottled with brown, the four pairs of breathing orifices on the abdomen being very conspicuous as lemon yellow spots. A small specimen (36 mm. in length) was coloured pinkish underneath.\n\n**Young.**\n\nI have not been able to make out at what times of year these scorpions breed. On the 9th May in Bangkok I caught a young one (14 mm. in length) by itself, and on the 3rd August also in Bangkok found one (11 mm. in length) being carried about on its mother's back.\n\n**Size.**\n\nMr. R. J. Pocock, in answer to enquiries, writes to me: \"In *A. minaximus* the male has the tail stouter and the claws longer with sinuate fingers, as compared with the female.\"\n\n**Size.**\n\nLength from front of mandibles to tip of sting of 38 adult Siamese specimens which I have examined:\n\n- average 14\u00bd mm.\n- smallest, 36 mm.\n- largest, 55 mm. (roughly 2\u00bc inch.)\n\n**Pectinate Teeth.**\n\nUsually about 21 on each comb, occasionally there is one more tooth on one side than on the other, and once I found a specimen with two more teeth on one side than the other i.e. 19 and 21.\n\nThe fewest I have counted were in a Bangkok specimen, i.e. 18 and 18; the most I have counted were in a Dong Phya Phai specimen, i.e. 24 and 24.\n\n2. *Arthrosomurus scutatus*, C. K.\n\nThis is a small yellowish-brown scorpion with very long attenuated claws and tail; I caught one specimen under the back of a fallen tree in the Experimental Gardens, Penang Hill, about 1900 feet elevation, and one in the verandah of \"the Crag,\" Penang Hill, 2260 feet elevation, both in March 1898. This species is also recorded from Tenasserim, Selangor, Singapore, Sumatra and Java.\n3. *Isometrus maculatus* (De Geer).\n\nThis is another small yellowish brown scorpion; it has been found in Spain, Africa, India, Ceylon, Malay Peninsula, Siam, Hongkong, Java, Timor, Mauritius, Madagascar, Sandwich Islands, West Indies and South America. I caught two specimens in the Officer's Mess, Sepoy Lines, Penang; one in the Officer's Mess, Tanglin, Singapore; one in Raffles Hotel, Singapore; and two in Bakar Bata House, Kedah. I was given two specimens in Bangkok said to have been caught there, but I never myself came across it alive in that city. This species, when suddenly found, will often lie still as if feigning to be dead, till touched, when it tries to run away.\n\n*Notes.*\n\n\"In *I. maculatus* the tail and pincers of the male are very long and thin as compared with the female.\" Pocock.\n\nFamily *Scorpionidae*.\n\n4. *Chorilus agilis*, Pocock. The Agile Scorpion.\n\nThis species was discovered by Mr. H. N. Ridley at the Batu Caves, Selangor, and described by Mr. R. J. Pocock (Annals + Mag. Nat. Hist. Series vii, vol. iii, No. 17, May 1899, p. 416). The general colour is dark reddish brown, not distinctly variegated. Pectinal teeth 4. Length 56 mm.\n\n5. *Chorilus rectimanus*, Pocock. The Straight-handed Scorpion.\n\nMr. H. N. Ridley discovered this species in Singapore, and it has been described by Pocock (loc. cit. supra, p. 418).\n\nThe general colour is ferruginous, variegated with black. Pectinal teeth 3 (?). Length 24 mm.\n\nOther species of this genus will probably be eventually found in the Malay Peninsula.\n\n6. *Palamnaeus oatesii*, Pocock. Oates' Scorpion.\n\nThis large species, known as \"Kala\" by the Kedah Malays, is often identified as *Palamnaeus spinifer* (Hempr. + Ehrenberg). L. Wray, jun., J. S. B. R. A. S. No. 21, 1890, p. 148, mentions \"a large dark metallic green scorpion (*Buthus spiniger*)\" in Batang Padang, Perak; he probably refers to this species.\n\nI obtained one specimen from near Jenan, Kedah; four from Kulim, Kedah; two from Penang Hill (one at 2500 feet\nelevation given me by Mr. La Brown; three from Johore Bahru, and two from the foothills of Gunung Pulai, Johore.\n\n*Colour (in life):* very rich dark olive green. The poison-vesicles in the Gunung Pulai specimens were white.\n\n*Size:*  \n\u2642, from front of mandibles to tip of sting, 102 mm.  \nPectinal teeth, 16+17.\n\n\u2640, from front of mandibles to end of penultimate segment, 107 mm. Pectinal teeth, 17+17.\n\n*Distrib.*  \nBurma, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra (?).\n\n7. *Palamnaeus silenus,* Simon.\n\n*Siamese:* \"Yaoopon chang.\" \u2014 Elephant Scorpion.\n\nOf this fine species I obtained four specimens from Bangkok, three from Takianen, one from near Kabin, one from near Rahong, and thirty-one from Chantaboon. It seems to be strictly nocturnal; at night roaming about for food, and lying hid by day: at Chantaboon I found most by digging in the soil 1 or 6 inches deep, under fallen logs, to find their burrows, which the scorpions often tried to escape along, but we followed them (digging up the soil) and eventually secured them. In one spot (in Jan. 1898) we found about ten individuals, all of about the same size, huddled up close together in a hole in the ground.\n\n*Colour (in life):* shining rich dark green.\n\n*Size.* A good specimen had the following dimensions:\u2014\n\nLength, from front of mandible to point of sting\u2014135 mm. (about 5\u00bd inches).\n\nLength, of cephalothorax (in median line)\u201418 mm.\n\nWidth of cephalothorax  \n\u2642  \n\u2640\n\nLength of tail  \n\u2642  \n\u2640\n\nLength of humerus  \n\u2642  \n\u2640\n\nLength of brachium  \n\u2642  \n\u2640\n\nLength of pincer (to end of fixed digit)  \n\u2642  \n\u2640\n\nLength of moveable digit  \n\u2642  \n\u2640\n\nWidth of hand  \n\u2642  \n\u2640\n\n*Pectinal Teeth* vary in number from about 15 to about 18 on each side.\nThe usual numbers seem to be $16+16$, or $16+17$.\n\nSexes. \"In *Palamurus silenus* and *Hormurus* the male has the two halves of the genital operculum separated so that this can be pulled apart, while in the female, though the suture remains, the two are inseparable. The combs are also larger in the male.\" Pocock.\n\nDistrict. Siam, and Cochin China.\n\n8. *Hormurus australasiae* (Fabr.)\n\nSiamese \"*Mengpom-ton*\" = Tree Scorpion.\n\nThis is a small dark brown scorpion with large pincers, a comparatively short, slender tail and a very small sting, commonly to be found under the bark of trees, but I have also obtained it among a pile of logs, and under dead leaves on the ground. Pocock says \"this species is found in S. East Asia and all over the Islands of the Indo-Malayan, Austro-Malayan and Australian Region,\" and mentions it being recorded from the Himalayas, Corea, Sumatra, Java, Flores, Saleyer, New Britain, Solomon, Loyalty and Fiji Islands.\n\nPersonally I have caught seven specimens on Penang Hill, at elevations of 1800 to 2300 feet; three in Bangkok; one at Chantaboon; and two on the island of Kosichang. I also received one from near Raheng, Siam.\n\nA *Hormurus*, probably of this species, is found on Maxwell's Hill, Perak; I found the remains of one inside a frog (*Rana macrodon*) caught at 3,300 feet elevation in April 1898.\n\nThe largest specimen I have measured was from the front of the mandibles to the tip of the sting, 43 mm.\n\nThe pectinal teeth in four Siamese specimens examined were:\u2014$6+7$, $6+7$, $7+7$ and $7+7$.\n\nOrder *Pseudoscorpiones*.\n\nThe False Scorpions.\n\nThese are the minute and harmless animals sometimes called \"Book Scorpions.\" At Chantaboon I found a species of the genus *Chelifer*; and also in Bangkok under the bark of trees, under flag-stones and in packing cases.\nOrder Pedipalpa.\n\n(see Pocock, Royal Natural History, Vol. vi, p. 217).\n\nSub-order Croppa (Tailed Pedipalps).\n\nSection Croppa.\n\nFamily Thelyphonidae. (Whip Scorpions).\n\n1. *Thelyphonus skunkovitcha*, Tantoni.\n\nSiamese \"Mengpoom-maan,\" i.e., Stinking Scorpion.\n\nLocalities. I met this species in Bangkok, Chantaboon and Kosichang. Pocock records it from \"Lacan, via Raheng, in Siam\" (A.-+ M. N. H. Ser. 7, Vol. v, March 1900, p. 208).\n\nDescription of body from a Bangkok specimen:\n\nCephalothorax slightly convex, considerably narrowed anteriorly. The anterior eyes are black, they are separated by a prominent elongated smooth tubercle which extends to the anterior edge of the cephalothorax, which consists of a sharp ridge which curves back on each side as far as the lateral eye where it disappears; the three lateral eyes are pale yellow, the dorsal pair being very conspicuous in the live animal. The whole surface of the cephalothorax is roughly granulated, on the whole more coarsely anteriorly; the cephalic and thoracic grooves are well marked. Abdomen moderately depressed, elongately oval, at its widest part 1.7 wider than the widest part of the cephalothorax; upper surface granular, with the posterior edge of each segment \"crenulated\"; \"the muscular points\" are round and well marked on the second to eighth segments.\n\nColour (in life): drawn up from several dozen Bangkok specimens.\n\nAdults:\u2014Upper surfaces of chelae, cephalothorax, abdomen, two joints of legs nearest body and lower surface of abdomen very dark brown, almost black, but sometimes the greater part of the lower surface of the abdomen is reddish-brown. Along either side of the abdomen there is a broad pale yellow longitudinal line. The tail, limbs (where not dark brown), lower surface of cephalothorax, and the first two segments on the underneath of the abdomen are a rich red-brown.\nYoung:\u2014Specimens of about 8 mm. in length have the cephalothorax and abdomen of the usual dark brown colour, but have pale yellowish red chelae.\n\nSize, of three typical Bangkok specimens, in millimetres:\u2014\n\n| Total length of cephalothorax and abdomen | 28 | 29 | 28 |\n|------------------------------------------|----|----|----|\n| Length of cephalothorax                  | 11 | 11\u00bd| 11 |\n| \" abdomen, including terminal joints     | 17 | 17\u00bd| 17 |\n| \" narrow tail                            | 20 | 23 | 26 |\n| \" five terminal joints of chelae, in articulation | 13 |    |    |\n| \" first leg, excluding the coxal joint   | 35 | 37 | 33 |\n| \" second leg                             | 19\u00bd| 18 |    |\n| Width of cephalothorax                   | 6\u00bd | 6  |    |\n\nHabits. Strictly nocturnal; hiding by day under logs, stones, etc., and at night roaming about for food. They are chiefly to be seen during the rainy season from April to August. In January and December I have sometimes noticed a very faint and peculiar smell given off by these creatures, but have not been able to detect it at other times of year.\n\nTo collect\u2014when found they can easily be picked up by a pair of forceps, the points placed on either side of the hard cephalothorax, and they quickly die in a cyanide of potassium \"insect killing bottle.\" When placed on their back on a sheet of glass or other flat surface these *Thelyphoni* seem very helpless and unable to right themselves.\n\nFood. In captivity they feed readily on dead insects: they first carefully and slowly examine the object, then take it up in their chelae, and in the case of a moth almost completely devour it, or if a dragon fly eat all but the wings: very rarely I have seen a *Thelyphonus* catch a live insect in its chelae and eat it: they do not attempt to interfere with beetles or grasshoppers larger than themselves. Besides insects they will eat very small bits of over-ripe bananas.\n\nOne that I caught with a broken tail lived 24 days, during this time there was no sign of a reproduced tail growing.\n\nEffects of Sting. These animals are usually supposed to be harmless to man, but in Bangkok on the 30th April 1897 I had a curious experience with one. Seeing a *Thelyphonus*, of this species, running on the ground I picked it up by the cephalothorax between the first finger and thumb of my left hand; it\nat once bent its thread-shaped tail over its back (as a scorpion does) and also scratched about my fingers with its legs, but the pincers did not touch me; I thought nothing of its tail, etc., till I felt a sharp pain and found the animal had somehow stung me. I went straight into my house, and already the first joint of my finger was very swollen and inflamed, there being a rapidly growing white lump, and the rest was red: at one spot was a fresh puncture as if a needle had been driven in, in a horizontal direction, and gone some little way under the skin. After cutting and squeezing the wound, I put my finger into a strong solution of permanganate of potash, which at once relieved the pain and stopped the swelling, but the little wound continued to smart for some hours. Since then I have been careful never to let a *Thelyphonus* touch me.\n\n*Notes.* \"You can tell the male of this species at once by the presence of a shallow circular pit upon the fourth ventral plate of the abdomen, by the different shape and size of the first plate, and by the simple structure of the small segments of the tarsus of the first pair of legs, that is to say of the antenniform legs; the tarsal segments of the adult female being peculiarly modified.\" (R. L. Pocock).\n\n2. *Thelyphonus Johorensis*, Oates.\n\n\"Toong-gree\" of the Malays of Johore.\n\nI have caught this species in Johore Bahru, and up to about 500 feet elevation on Gunung Pulai. One specimen, out of three caught Sept. '97, smelt slightly. Two *Thelyphon*, probably of this species, caught in the Botanical Gardens in March '98 also smelt slightly but perceptibly. A specimen obtained at about 3,100 feet elevation in the Larut Hills, Perak, in April '98, is referred doubtfully to this species.\n\n3. *Thelyphonus wegei*, Pocock (A. J. M. N. II. Ser. 7, Vol. V., March 1900, p. 295).\n\nFound by Mr. Herbert W. L. Way in Battambang, Siam.\n\n4. *Typhottia dolgi*, Pocock. (loc. cit. supra, p. 297),\n\nFound by Mr. Mahon Daly at \"Lacan, Vin Raheng, Siam.\"\n5. *Hypoconus formosus* (Butler)\n\nThis species found in Burma and on Owen's Island, Mergui, (Pocock, Linn. Soc. Jour. Zoology, Vol. xxxvi, p. 316); is probably the same as that recorded from Penang as *Thelyphonus angustus*, Lucas by Stoliczka, *J. A. S. B.* Vol. xlii, Part 2, 1873, p. 134.\n\nSub-order *Amblypygi* (Tailless Pedipalps).\n\nFamily *Tarantulidae*.\n\n6. *Tarantula phipsoni* (Pocock) Phipson's Tarantula.\n\nThis species is named after the able Honorary Secretary of the Bombay Natural History Society. The genus *Tarantula* has also been called *Phrynus* and *Phrynichus*.\n\nAt Chantaboon in January 1898 I found fifteen individuals of this species on one small hill, by turning over some piles of logs; they can run very swiftly, and rapidly efface themselves from view by going into crevices; but usually, like scorpions, they seem to seek concealment by squatting quite still among their natural surroundings. Daylight seems to confuse them, and when caught they move their pincers wildly about in a most aimless manner.\n\nDimensions of a Chantaboon specimen:\n\n| Dimension                          | Measurement |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Length, from front of mandible     | 40 mm       |\n| Width of cephalothorax              | 19 mm       |\n| \" abdomen                           | 17\u00bd mm      |\n| Total length of chela limb          | 110 mm      |\n| \" antenniform limb                  | 128 mm      |\n| \" 1st walking leg                   | 55 mm       |\n| \" 2nd                              | 60 mm       |\n| \" 3rd                              | 58 mm       |\n\nSpan from tip to tip of outstretched chela, 220 mm.\n\nAn animal allied to Phipson's Tarantula inhabits the Batu Caves, Selangor; I saw one specimen far into the caves in June 1898 but failed to catch it.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\n(Order Aranea.)\n\nThe True or Web-Spiders.\n\nMalay \"Laha-laha\"\nSiamese \"Mrag-mong\"\n\nJakun \"T'awonok\" (Lake + Kelsall, J.S.B.R.A.S.\nNo. 26, 1894, p. 56.)\n\nThe true Spiders have four pairs of legs, of similar construction, each composed of seven segments, and used for locomotion, and two modified anterior pairs of limbs, one (the palpi) leg-like and composed of six segments, including the basal segment or maxilla, and one (the mandibles) composed of only two segments and containing a poison-gland which opens at the tip of the second segment which forms the poison-fang. The spinning mamillae, upon which open the silk glands, are situated on the lower surface of the abdomen, and are a characteristic feature of the true Spiders.\n\nThe sexes of spiders may be distinguished by the last segment of the palp which is modified into an intromittent organ in the male, while the female, in most families, has a horny plate (vulva) on the forepart of the lower surface of the abdomen.\n\nThe true Spiders are divided into two Sub-orders:\n\n1. Sub-order Mesothelida. Abdomen segmented, its upper surface covered with eleven dorsal plates. Eight spinning mamillae placed in the middle of the lower surface of the abdomen. This sub-order contains only one family Liphistiidae, and one genus Liphistius, known from Burma, Sumatra, Penang and Selangor, where it has been recently discovered by Mr. H. N. Ridley.\n\n2. Sub-order Opisthothelida. Abdomen not segmented. Six, or fewer, spinning mamillae placed near the hinder extremity of the lower surface of the abdomen. This Sub-order contains a host of forms, divided into two sections of many families; only a few of the more noticeable can be mentioned in the limits of this paper.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nSection *Mygalomorphae*.\nFamily *Theraphosidae*.\n\nThese are the very large hairy spiders commonly called by the English in the Straits Settlements \"Tarantulas,\" and called by the Siamese \"Boum,\" what the effect of their bite on a man would be I cannot say; it is commonly supposed that the consequences would be very serious, if not fatal.\n\n1. *Coremiocnemis cunicularius*, Simon.\n\nThese large dark brown and very hairy spiders are numerous on Penang Hill; most of my specimens were obtained near \"the Crag\" at an elevation of about 2200 feet. They make burrows, sometimes a couple of feet deep, in the steep banks at the side of the hill paths; the round entrance hole of these burrows is easily seen, and then the spider, if at home, may be carefully dug out. The Kling coolies I employed to help me digging were extremely afraid of these spiders, which they called (in Malay) \"Laba-laba gigi sakit\" (= the spider with the poisonous teeth). These spiders are fierce, very strong and difficult to kill without damaging them; I have found a specimen after three or four hours immersion in spirits of wine still to be so lively that it had to be handled with caution. The length of the cephalothorax and abdomen of one I measured was 46 mm. (1.8 inches), its hind-leg measuring 68 mm. (2.7 inches).\n\n2. *Melopaeus albostriatus*, Simon.\n\nThis species occurs in Siam; I was given a specimen said to have been caught at Ayuthia, but never came across it alive myself.\n\nFamily *Burycelidae*.\n\n3. *Encyocrypta* sp. incert.\n\nI got this spider near the foot of Gunong Pulai, Johore, in September, 1897, but did not observe whether it had a \"trap-door\" home or not.\n\nSection *Arachnomorphae*.\nFamily *Pholcidae*.\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\n1. *Arctosa atlanta*, Walck.\n\nThis elegant spider, better known as *Pholcus holmbergi*, with exceedingly long and slender legs is common in disused buildings in Bangkok. It is pale reddish brown in colour, except the abdomen which is grey. They apparently make no webs; they can run very fast, but, as long as there is no crevice to dart away into, are easily caught in the hand. They may be from the tip of one extended fore-leg to the other as much as 140 mm. (or 5\u00bd inches); though the length of the cephalothorax and abdomen is only 10 mm. (or .4 of an inch).\n\nFamily *Arctopidae*.\n\n2. *Arctosa annulata*, Walck.\n\nThis species, which is widely distributed throughout the Oriental region, I obtained in Bangkok.\n\n3. *Araneus de hauari*, Dol.\n\nCollected in a house in Bangkok in July 1895.\n\n4. *Herennia multipuncta*, Dol.\n\nObtained on Penang Hill in March 1896.\n\n5. *Nephila maculata*, Fabr.\n\nThis is the most striking in appearance of the Malay spiders I have come across, and is by no means rare. It lives on trees both in gardens and in the jungle, but occasionally wanders into buildings, as I got a specimen in the Officer's Mess at Tanglin in April 1896. Its large web, constructed of beautiful yellow silk, is usually spread between two trees, and the great black and yellow spider sitting motionless, with legs spread out in the middle of it, in bright sunshine makes a fine picture. If taken in the hand, the collector will find this spider can bite hard with its powerful nippers. Besides Singapore I have noted this species in Taiping, Perak, in Bangkok and at Muok Lek in the Dong Phya Phai, Siam; it also occurs in Borneo, Celebes, Halmahera, Ternate, Batavian, New Britain, Solomon Islands, etc.\n\nA Bangkok specimen was coloured as follows:\u2014\ncephalothorax, shining intense black.\nabdomen, various shades of brown, with black marks\nand two conspicuous yellow spots.\nlimbs, red brown, black at the joints.\n\nThis species attains a great size; in an individual I measured the length of the cephalothorax and abdomen was 36 mm. (1.4 inches).\n\n9. *Nephila malabarensis*, Walck.\n\nThis prettily marked spider is very common, especially about houses, making large webs under the eaves of roofs, in verandahs, etc.; when houses are not at hand it seems equally content with rocks. I have noticed this species in Penang (especially near \"the Crag\"), in Singapore, in Alor Star, Kedah, in Bangkok and in Chantaboon: it also occurs in Java, Halmahera and other places in the East Indies. Quite small spiders will nearly always be found living in the webs of this species. I have not been able to make out so far if they belong to a different species, or if they are the males of the big females which construct the webs.\n\n*Colour* (in life.) Upper surface of cephalothorax dark brown or dark red; upper surface of abdomen mottled olive brown, or whitey buff with brown marks. The specimens with the brown cephalothorax usually have red or rich orange markings underneath the cephalothorax and abdomen, those with red above have bright yellow markings underneath. The legs are pale yellow, black about the joints, and the last segment in each leg is brown.\n\n10. *Gasteracantha sp. incert.*\n\nThis curious looking spider, with hard transversely dilated six-spined abdomen, is not uncommon in the jungle on Penang Hill. I have found it at elevation of from 2000 to 2400 feet during March 1898. It makes a very large, strong, geometrically arranged web of white silk between the stems or branches of trees; this web it keeps very tidy. One web, which I particularly noted, was situated between branches of trees over 15 feet apart, and was about 9 feet from the ground. The transverse width of its abdomen from point to point may exceed one inch (one fine specimen measured 28\u00bd mm.)\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\nFamily Psechridae.\n\n11. *Psechrus singapurensis*, Thor.\n\nIn the Batu Caves, Selangor, in June 1898, in caverns remote from daylight, Mr. A. L. Butler and myself found certain spiders numerous, which make strong, untidy webs in crevices of the rocks. Specimens of the spiders were sent to Mr. Poecock who considers they probably belong to this species.\n\nFamily Ctenidae.\n\n12. *Ctenus jungfer*, Thor.\n\nKnown from Penang. (F.O.P. Cambridge.

The Hunting Spider.\n\nNearly every resident in the East Indies must know this fine spider which runs about houses, in the evening, catching its insect prey; it makes no web, but the female spins a whitish silk cocoon in which she carries about her eggs, which she looks after with great care and vigorously defends from enemies. What the effect of the bite of this spider on a human being would be I do not know, but it is certainly not prone to bite and I have never heard of its doing so, while as it is known to be very useful to mankind in destroying superabundant insects, it certainly ought to be encouraged and native servants should not be allowed to carelessly or wantonly kill them. It feeds on moths, crickets, etc., especially the big red cockroaches, which are such a nuisance in some places in the Straits Settlements. In a house individual spiders will often take up particular beats, which they occupy regularly night after night; in Bangkok one lived for many months behind my dressing table. Every evening when I placed a lamp on the table the spider came out from its retreat and took up his position by the light; at first we rather mistrusted each other\u2014I being afraid the spider might some day bite me, and he carefully avoiding my coming too close to him, but as the\nweeks went by such mutual confidence sprung up that even when I touched him the spider would hardly shift his position.\n\nI have noted this species in Singapore, Johore, Georgetown (Penang), Kedah, Bangkok, Ayuthia, Taklamen, Chantaboon and also on board local coasting steamers.\n\nIt is also recorded from Java, Borneo, Celebes, Malmahera, Ternate, Batchian, New Britain, Solomon Islands, tropical Africa, etc., etc.\n\nA specimen I kept for a time in captivity in a large glass jar together with a small scorpion *Archisomus mucronatus*, and a *Thelyphonus* did not interfere with them in any way or they with it. Whenever the spider rested on the glass sides of the vessel it put its spinnerets in rapid motion and formed a small anchor of white silk and then let down one fine silk thread as if to help support itself; in a few days it had to some extent obscured the whole surface of the glass by the number of these anchors it had made and abandoned.\n\n15. *Heteropoda thoracica* (C. Koch).\n\nI caught specimens of this very handsome spider in the inner, deepest caves, far from daylight, over an hour's walk from the entrance in the hill side, Gunong Gajah, Kedah, in June 1898. They ran with great agility over the rough walls of rock, and also when we tried to catch them sprang away from the rocks into the air; the Malays were very frightened of them. Although living in darkness the spiders did not seem at all confused by the light of the lamp and torches. On the two occasions I have collected in these caves, in April 1895 and June 1898, we only met these spiders in one part of the caves, the deepest part.\n\n*Colour*, yellow ochre, marked with rich dark brown.\n\n*Size*, Cephalothorax, length, 16 mm.\n\" width 12.5 \"\nAbdomen, length 17 \"\n\" width 8 \"\nPalp, length 27 \"\n1st leg: \" 33 \"\n2nd \" 91 \"\nNOTES ON MILLIPEDES.\n\n3rd leg length 73 mm.\n4th \" \" 82 \"\nTotal span (across 2nd pair of legs from tip to tip) 194 mm.

In the true spiders the breathing apparatus consists sometimes of four pairs of lung-sacs, but generally the hinder pair are replaced by tracheal tubes. In the harvest spiders the breathing apparatus consists of tracheal tubes, opening by one pair of orifices situated on the sternal plate of the abdomen.\n\nThere are no spinning glands.\n\nFamily *Oonopidae*.\n\n1. *Gonodius rostratus*, Thorell. (*Ann. Mus. Genov.* xxx, p. 378, [1890]): found in Penang.\n\n2. *Oonopus fari*, Thorell. (*Ann. Mus. Genov.* xxx, p. 375, [1890]): found in Penang.\n\n3. *Oonopus humatus*, Thorell. (*Ann. Mus.

W. S. Kyddesley.\n\nHaving assumed charge of the Consulate in April this year and wishing to become acquainted with some of the Western Siamese States which have not been visited since 1894, I left Penang in the colonial launch Sobad at 10 p.m. on Tuesday 11th December, taking with me Mr. Pelli, District Officer, Bukit Mertajam. I elected to go in December as the weather at this season is settled with a N.E. wind blowing from the land. It was a fine moonlight night and we reached the mouth of the Kedah river before daybreak.\n\nWednesday 12th December.\u2014The Sultan's Secretary came on board at the entrance to the river and we reached the landing place at Horston about 6.0 v.m. Here I was received by some of the leading officers and a guard of honour and we drove in a carriage and pair to the Sultan's country house at Anak Buloh. H.H. the Raja Muda accompanied us. I arranged to be at the Consulate at 9.0, previous notice having been given of my intended visit some time before. After breakfast we drove to the Consulate which has been lately repaired. Every assistance was given to me by the Kedah Officials. I enquired into several cases of minor importance and a considerable number of British subjects presented themselves for registration. Having despatched the business in hand and arranged to attend the next day, we drove back to Anak Buloh where I discussed various questions with the Raja Muda. At 3.0 p.m. I paid an official visit to H.H. the Sultan who is in very feeble health and at times hardly equal to transact public business. Having taken leave of the Sultan we proceeded with the Raja Muda to inspect the Public Offices. The buildings are excellently adapted for the purpose and present quite an imposing appearance, though\nthe style of architecture may not be of the highest order. They were completed about four years ago and reflect great credit on the designer who carried out the work\u2014Mahomed Lebby Tambi, formerly employed under me in the Police Court, Penang. He is now building a fine new house for the Raja Muda.\n\nThe offices are admirably arranged\u2014Treasury, Land and Survey, Courts of Law, and lastly an office for the Auditor General. The various officials, including the Judge, were introduced. We were shewn a survey map of the town with all the various lots marked on it. The offices are open from 10.0 to 4.0, Malays being exclusively employed, and in outward appearance at all events our colonial system is followed. So far as we could ascertain the office of Auditor-General is somewhat of a sinecure. He is said to query and examine accounts but there were no papers or books in his office. A census has lately been taken and we were shewn the figures which, however, are still incomplete for some of the up-country Mukims. I have on former occasions inspected the gaol, but did not do so on this visit. I noticed that the outside wall was beautifully white but the interior arrangements are I fancy what they have always been and are hardly up to date. Prisoners in chains are employed on outside labour in the town. A Kling dobi prisoner sent me a petition complaining that he was kept in gaol beyond the term of his sentence, but his warrant of commitment, which was produced, proved that his statement was incorrect. The Raja Muda, his younger brother, a son of Tungku Dia Udin, the Auditor-General and two others dined at Anak bukit. We were the guests of the Raja Muda.\n\nThursday 13th December.\u2014The Raja Muda came at 7.30 A.M. and we went down the river to the Consulate in a house boat, the Raja Muda pointing out the place where Lieut. Thurburn, R.N., of H.M.S. Hyacinth, was drowned when crossing the river at night after snipe shooting in October, 1891. The current here is strong and the boat must have struck a snag and capsized. The body was recovered opposite the Consulate 1\u00bd miles down the river. The grave in the consular grounds, which has a stone cross over it, is kept in good order. Enquired into a number of cases including a complaint by a Penang China-\nman as to the decision of the Kedah Government with regard to a grant of land at Kulim. Tran Bullat, Collector of Land Revenue, produced the plans and the documents and after a full explanation of the case I came to the conclusion that the Kedah authorities were justified in their action. A certificate had been granted to a Malay man in Penang who claimed to have been born in Province Wellesley, alleging that his father moved to Kedah when he was 6 years old. Good evidence being produced that he was born in Kedah territory I cancelled the certificate. A large number of British subjects were registered. The consular business being concluded we drove back to Amul bulu. At 4.0 we went by invitation to tea at the Raja Muda's and found a garden party assembled, all the leading officials having been invited. Having partaken of coffee, ices, etc., in the garden we adjourned to the billiard room. Returning to Amul bulu for dinner we left at 10.0, going on board the Seabird. The Raja Muda and others saw us off and we dropped down stream slowly, anchoring about midnight inside the bar. I have visited Kedah at intervals since 1873 when I spent some weeks there learning Malay and I have always met with the utmost hospitality and kindness on the part of the reigning family and officials.\n\nFriday, 14th December.\u2014Having crossed the bar at high tide about 4.0 A.M. we had a calm voyage with a light cool breeze from the shore. We passed numerous limestone islets and rocks of quaint shapes. At times it came on to blow fresh from the N. E. and the spray from the white waves broke over our bows. Passing Cone Island near which the S.S. Prize recently struck an uncharted rock and went down, \"Cut Islands\" and the twin rocks called in the chart \"Darby and Joan\" we made for the entrance of the Trang River which for half an hour was hidden from us by a heavy rain squall which came on from the N. E. The Trang River is like the majority of those along this coast, broad and fringed with mangroves, with many channels. Having taken a pilot from Penang we were successful in reaching our destination without grounding on the mud banks. The seat of Government is by no means imposing. There is no town. At the landing place we were met by Mr. Khaw Ju Keat\u2014the Governor's nephew\u2014two pony-traps being sent\ndown to convey us to the Governor's house which is situated about a quarter of a mile from the jetty. There is a Custom House and a few Chinese shops. We were not expected so early. Mr. Khaw Sim Bee, whose Siamese title is Phya Rasdanupradit, etc., the Governor, received us most cordially and after giving us tea drove us along a new road which he has made round a wooded hill on which his house stands. On the way he pointed out the new Government Offices consisting of Treasury, Court and Land Office which have been commenced opposite the gaol. The prisoners, Chinese and Siamese, are employed in making bricks and on road work. Mr. Khaw Sim Bee belongs to a wealthy Penang family and is an admirable administrator. Being intimately connected with Penang he can do much in the way of extending the trade of that Settlement with Trang and the neighbouring Siamese States. He owns a Steamer which runs regularly between Trang, Pung-a, Penang and Deli.\n\nThe old town and mines, where some hundreds of Cantonese and Khehs are employed, are situated some miles up the river and the tin is brought down to the river on elephants four miles by a bad road. We had not time to visit them. Mr. Khaw Sim Bee described how he had effectually suppressed the Secret Societies some years ago, since when there have been no signs of their revival. He also informed me that the Siamese Government had decided to abolish the Gambling Farms and this was gradually being done. There is only one Sikh in the place, who is employed as a detective to see that no Government employ\u00e9e attends the Gambling Farm.\n\nPepper thrives well in Trang, 25,000 pikuls being produced in a year valued at $28 a pikul. The soil is said to be excellent. Mr. Khaw Sim Bee pointed out a new elephant-road to Nakon on the East coast 70 miles distant. It is dignified by the name of a road but at present hardly deserves the title. About 15 years ago orders were given from Bangkok to connect these Western States by telegraph. Poles were prepared for the connection between Trang and Ghirbi and the wire has been lying at Trang ever since. Many reforms are being introduced by the Siamese Government in these States. The officials of the old school have been removed and are replaced by young men from Bangkok who have had some training in their duties. The\nlatest innovation is the introduction of the Burma village system of headmen under which police and paid officials are dispensed with up country. Ten houses elect a headman. A group of ten villages has a representative headman. All occurrences such as births, deaths, fires, disturbances, crimes, etc., are reported and no one can move from one village to another without the fact being reported and some one found responsible for him. Mr. Khaw Sim Bee says that since the introduction of this system crime has practically disappeared. The Siamese he says as a rule are well behaved but when they are bad they are desperately bad. The Treasury accounts are kept in the English fashion. The law is framed on European models and everything is up to date. The Opium Farm is run on the same lines as in Penang, the retail prices being the same. Living is apparently very cheap and prices are very much lower than in the Colony. Fowls are 25 cents, buffaloes $30 to $35. A certain amount of timber is exported besides tin and pepper. Giam (used for boat building and other purposes) is exported to Penang and Calcutta. Peacocks and teal are plentiful within easy reach of the Governor's place, also green pigeon, and pergam. The revenue is paid as in the other Western States through the Siamese Consul-General in Penang, 60% going to Bangkok. This is a considerable drain on the resources of the States and may help to explain why so many useful public works, which are projected, are not carried out.\n\nThere are few British subjects in the place and their interests may safely be entrusted to Mr. Khaw Sim Bee who is himself a British subject.\n\nThe Governors of Tongkah and Ghirbi, who were leaving for Bangkok to take part in cremation ceremonies, dined with Mr. Khaw Sim Bee that night as well as two other officials. The Governor of Ghirbi speaks English. I explained to him that I had intended to visit Ghirbi on my return journey but would postpone my visit as he would be absent. Ghirbi produces an inferior quality of coal or rather lignite of no commercial value though it is used with other fuel by small steamers.\n\nMr. Khaw Sim Bee entertained us most hospitably and we slept at his house that night.\nSaturday, 15th December.\u2014Mr. Khaw Sim Bee when in Penang had kindly placed at my disposal the small steamer Dumong Rat, so I left orders for the Seabird to meet us off Telibon Island on our return from Tongkah. Mr. Khaw Sim Bee also very kindly sent his nephew Mr. Khaw Ji Kiat, who speaks English and Siamese, with us and he proved of the greatest assistance. A Marine Police Guard (Siamese) was drawn up at the jetty when we drove down and we took leave of the governor about 7.0 a.m., the Dumong Rat flying the consular flag. Outside the mouth of the Trang River we found the S.S. Arundel, the small steamer that runs between Penang and Pung-a, owned by Mr. Khaw Sim Bee, high and dry on a sand bank. She had left Trang for Pung-a at night and not being able to make out the narrow channel marked by stakes had got on the bank about 2.0 a.m. on the 14th. After passing round Telibon Island the sea got rougher with a strong breeze from the land. The long island of Pulau Loutar sheltered us part of the way. After passing Pulau Loutar the sea got rougher as we got further from the land. Then after rounding a small island we altered our course for Tongkah with a following sea. The anchorage at Phuket resembles that of Malacca during the S.W. monsoon. The harbour is very shallow and is exposed to the N.E. The Siamese gunboat Run Red and S.S. Petrel were lying a mile or so from the shore. Captain Ring of the Run Red kindly sent a boat off at once, and owing to the heavy sea running we had some difficulty in getting off. However we got ashore in safety about 6.0 p.m. Captain Ring met us at the jetty, took us to his house, which is near, and introduced us to his wife, the daughter of Captain Weiler of Tongkah. The Chief Commissioner of the Western Siamese States had sent his carriage for us and we were met by the Acting Superintendent of Police (Siamese) who talks English well, having been formerly employed in the Penang Land Office. We were received by the Chief Commissioner who introduced us to his wife in a large reception room furnished in European style. He hospitably placed rooms at our disposal and asked us to make ourselves at home. His Excellency did not understand English but with the help of the Superintendent of Police and Mr. Ji Keat we got on very well.\nduring dinner. His wife knew a few words of English learnt in Penang where their son is being educated at the Brothers' School. The Commissioner is a person of great importance being over the local governors and corresponding with Bangkok frequently.\n\nSunday, 16th December.\u2014We had arranged to go early with Mr. Ross C. M.S., Superintendent of Mines, to see a new road, but we found carriages ready and the Commissioner prepared to show us round himself. We were driven about a mile along a grass covered road till we were brought to a stop by an unbridged stream. This afforded a good example of what we found very common in these Siamese places. Roads, bridges, and improvements generally are talked of but not made. Everything bad is attributed to the late Governor. All sorts of wonderful schemes are going to be carried out by the present man. The old Governor for instance allowed Chinese to bury where they liked. The hills were allowed to be cleared of jungle for hill paths. Anyone could dig for tin anywhere, etc. The old Governor is said to be responsible for the tumble down building which serves as the Post Office and so on.\n\nThe explanation for allowing this stream to be unbridged was that all the timber obtained from Penang and Singapore which was lying ready was burnt one night owing to a lamp falling. We were told there was no stone available though I saw plenty within a quarter of a mile. We passed the house of the Superintendent of Police, Mr. Hartshill, lent from the Burma Police, who is at present on leave in England. Mr. Clunies was also to have a house there and we climbed a small hill chosen as the site for a house for the King of Siam. It is nice open grass country interspersed with scrub. The plans are said to be all ready but it is very doubtful if the house will be built or the road ever completed as there is a newer scheme for moving the town about two miles further away to the bay near the Light-house island which is sheltered and is said to have deep water. If this scheme is ever carried out the site of the present town will be given up to mining as it is known to be rich in tin. We then drove to the Central Police Station which was prepared for me to hold a Consular Court and I arranged to be there at 11.30. From there we drove to\nthe mines. These are interesting from the fact that they are in the former bed of the sea, an embankment being carried a quarter of a mile or so out to sea so as to enclose the mine. Two or three thousand Chinese miners, all Hokkiens, are employed here and there must be quite as many pigs as Chinese. These pigs are exported to Penang. Within the embankment which keeps the sea out the sand and clay have been excavated to a depth of some 50 or 60 feet below sea level. It is an enormous work which may or may not be rewarded by success. I was told that there was a loss of $50,000 during the present year but this may not be true. We saw some tin sand being washed in the usual way. At present the average yield is 12 pikuls a day but it is hoped soon to reach a richer stratum. The particles of tin are very small whereas in the mines near the hills large biji are said to be found. After inspecting the mines we drove to the Government Offices and were introduced to the Treasurer and a youthful looking Chief Justice aged between 30 and 35. I wanted to post a letter but we were not taken to see the Post Office, which being a relic of the old Governor's r\u00e9gime is not one of the show places. The Chief Commissioner has a good Office. Here we saw several typewriters in Siamese character at work. On the walls were some recent Siamese maps. During the day we received typewritten formal invitations to dine with our host. After breakfast at 10.0 we drove to the Central Police Station where I was presented with two petitions from Kling. One was about the division of some property of a deceased Kling man. It appeared that he traded in cattle and several persons were indebted to him. Before his death he called his friends and told them to bury him decently and have a feast, collect what was due to him and keep the money for his widow in India. They appear to have carried out part of the trust and the recollection of the goats and fowls slaughtered in honour of deceased was still in their minds. So far as I could ascertain there remained a sum of about $2.50 for the relatives, deposited with a Siamese official. The other petition related to a matter which is still sub judice. Two Kling British subjects had a difference about some accounts and one was alleged to have assaulted the other. The case came before the judge and one was mulcted\nin damages and ordered to pay $30 or some such amount. Against this decision he had appealed to the Council-General at Bangkok and an answer was expected in a few weeks. Klings cannot exist without litigation and I should think that the Siamese judicial system is well calculated to satisfy them. It must be a great luxury to be able to appeal to Bangkok in any trivial matter even if there are no results. While waiting I noticed a Sikh orderly being measured against the wall for his descriptive roll as a British subject. He was wearing a specially high turban and I asked what his height for the Register was. I was told 5 feet 8 inches, but having removed his turban and boots he only reached 5 feet 4 inches. A large number of Sikhs were formerly employed at Tongkah but they were found troublesome and have been replaced by Siamese, only a few orderlies being retained. When the consular business was finished we inspected the Club where we saw some new Penang papers brought by the Petrel. We then paid a surreptitious visit to the office of \"the Royal Siamese Posts and Telegraphs.\" I asked for stamps but was informed that they were not kept and letters must be forwarded on board. We did not ask to telegraph anywhere as we had been told that the telegraph posts and wires which run along the new road lead nowhere.\n\nIn the afternoon Mr. Clunies came and fetched us with a buggy and dogcart. He drove me while Mr. Peel followed in his pony cart. We drove through the principal streets of the town. We passed over one new plank bridge but all the rest were rotten and there were great pits in the road. Bridges are said to be repaired only on the occasion of a wedding. We drove some distance along the projected new road to the town of the future on raised turf land through brushwood. Everywhere were excavations for tin. Chinese graves, some newly dug\u2014in spite of the new r\u00e9gime\u2014were also plentiful in the brushwood. We then walked half a mile till we came to a mangrove swamp\u2014then back along a cart track with the deepest ruts I ever saw till we struck the main road to the up-country mines. This road might easily be put in good order but nothing is done to it and there are deep holes in it. Up the valley is a wonderful aqueduct built of scaffold poles by Chinese some years ago which is said to be seven miles long and 100 feet high. We were\nshewn a photograph of this and I should have liked to have seen it. Having driven through the town we called on Captain Rine and found a gale blowing. The weather looked very bad and it was suggested that we had better delay our departure till next morning. There was a dinner party in our honour that night. Captain Rine and two Danish officers of the Ram Rat, the Chief Justice, Treasurer, Mr. Clunies and others, about 14 in all. A Siamese band played during dinner, Siamese and Chinese tunes, flutes and fiddles. I took the Commissioner's wife down and she was the only lady. The Commissioner after \"the King\" proposed our health and I replied. We left about 9.30 and went on board the Luarong Rat in Captain Rine's boat. Happily the wind had gone down. It was pretty rough outside with a head wind and the boat pitched and rolled, the sea coming over the bows. We got into smooth water under Pulau Panjang about 3.0 or 4.0 A.M. and anchored in the Pung-a River.\n\nMonday, 17th November.\u2014A lovely cool morning and the view beautiful beyond description with numberless limestone islets and rocks some rising to the height of four or five hundred feet with precipitous sides clothed with verdure. Mr. Ju Keat had started at 5.30 up the river to convey a letter from the Commissioner to the Governor. We were told that he could not be back for an hour or so and we therefore went in a boat\u2014a very leaky one\u2014to explore the river, taking the camera and Mr. Curtin's orchid and plant collector. The Pung-a River forms part of a network of broad channels among mangroves out of which rise at intervals great isolated limestone crags and precipitous rocks, some rising to 800 or 1,000 feet in height. Our men climbing up the steep rocks got a miscellaneous collection of plants and orchids which half filled our small boat. We also took several photographs of picturesque rocks and caves. Then we returned to breakfast on the launch. Mr. Ju Keat having returned we went in a boat about two miles up the river, taking a rifle in case there were any crocodiles on the mud banks. We did not see one though the tide was low. The stream or rather mangrove creek got very narrow and at length we reached the landing stage where a Police guard was drawn up, and we were met by\nthe Governor's Secretary with a pony carriage. The Secretary did not speak English but we learnt through Mr. Ji' Keat that this was a new road to take the place of the former (Governor's road, which (of course) was bad. Like all the other roads we saw except that at Trang it was in an unfinished state completely grassed over with big holes in it, but further on it was much better. The scenery was very pretty. The road runs through an avenue of ansenas which at this season up north shed all their leaves. The road being covered with dead leaves reminded one of an English lane in autumn. There was nothing tropical about it but an occasional palm in the distance. On either side were broad stretches of fine turf with clumps of brushwood. Through the valley which is about two miles wide meanders the Pung-a River in a sandy bed. The valley is entirely hemmed in by precipitous limestone cliffs some 1,500 feet high. On the left going to Pung-a is a huge block shaped like an elephant. After passing several houses and the gaol enclosed by a palisade, we reached the Governor's place. The Governor received us most warmly and offered us tea and cigarettes in his verandah. He is a most genial man but unfortunately he upset our gravity by his first remark which was translated to us by Mr. Ji' Keat with a smile: \"This is a poor house to receive you in. It was built by the late Governor. I have plans all ready for a new house\". The cigarettes made in Siamese fashion were excellent and the Governor told me they were made of Pung-a tobacco. The soil he says is very rich and will grow anything\u2014100 pikuls of tobacco a year are produced, value $5,000. I asked him to send some tobacco, cigarettes, etc., to the Agricultural Show. He is very anxious to make known the resources of his district and said he was preparing a report which he promised to send to me. He said there was great difficulty in procuring labour for planting. The Chinese all go to the mines. 5,000 pikuls of tin are got\u2014brought in by elephants which only carry 4 or 5 slabs. He is very anxious to get some natives of India for planting. In one island he said there were 500 deer which he hunts with a pack of dogs. Peacocks he said were very plentiful. It is certainly a lovely place\u2014very cool at this time of year and, I should say, extremely healthy. The lunch was so excellent that I asked if\nhe had a French cook. He said his cook was a Chinaman whom he brought from Bangkok. The Governor has a daughter being educated in the Penang Convent. He had been to Perak where Mr. Rungier had been very good to him he said. Just as we finished lunch three elephants arrived and the Governor asked if we would ride round and see the town, Rest House, etc. I mounted the leading one with the Governor and Mr. Prei and Mr. Ji Keat followed. My elephant was valued at $1,200. A good number are sold to Burma. We first went along the road, the Governor who knows a few words of English pointing out the present very unpretending Government Offices and saying \"no good house\u2014next year estimate.\" The elephants, as is their wont, left the road wherever a bridge appeared and made a detour. There is only one narrow street in the \"town.\" I noticed a pillar box close to the Post and Telegraph Office. The people are half Siamese and half Chinese and a good many of the houses are dilapidated. After passing through the \"town\" we struck the river bed and went down some distance. It has a broad sandy bed. In the rainy season it becomes a swollen torrent which at times floods the town. Passing round by the Governor's house we went some distance above the road leading to the river and came to a hill on which a Rest House has been built\u2014a lovely site commanding a view of the valley. The Rest House is commodious but unfurnished. The Governor said that even at that season there were frequent showers which keep the place cool. There was a shower while we were there. The high cliffs clad with jungle no doubt attract the clouds. We were quite sorry to leave and I expressed my regret that as there were no British subjects I could not repeat my visit as Consul. The Governor saw us off at the landing place and as we passed I noticed two men mending some of the worst holes on the road. We found the Dauong Rat had left her anchorage and gone to the mouth of the river to take in firewood. This entailed an extra two miles pull for the men. We lay that night off the Custom House and slept on the deck peacefully.\n\nTuesday, 18th December.\u2014A pilot came off early and we left at 6.0 to visit the Kesum cave. This is some miles up a river similar to the Pung-a River with limestone rocks rising out of\nthe mangrove. Following one branch the river narrows and passes through a great limestone rock\u2014forming a natural arch fringed with stalactites. It was so beautiful with the sun shining on the water seen through the arch that we took several photographs. Having passed under the rock and admired the scene we returned to the mouth of the river leaving for Trang about 9.0 A.M. It was blowing fresh and the sea was pretty rough\u2014a glorious morning with a cool breeze from the land. Passing numberless limestone rocky islands we got under the lee of Pulau Lontar and before dark sighted Telibon Island. Off the Custom House we found the Seabird lying together with the Actaeon which had only just floated off the bank on which we found her when we first arrived at Trang. We slept on deck and had a cool peaceful night.\n\nWednesday, 18th December.\u2014At daylight we started in a house boat to see some caves up a river which were said by Mr. Kiew Sim Bing to surpass those of Kedah. The caves are very disappointing and as we had no torches we could not explore them except by match light. It took us three hours to go and return and we regretted the delay as we could not reach the Langkawis before dark. Having taken leave of Mr. Ju Keat who had proved most invaluable to us we made for Pulu Terukau and anchored about 5.0 P.M. under the shelter of a small rocky island separated from the shore where there were a few native huts, by a narrow channel. We were glad to get into smooth water for the night. We landed and searched for orchids till it got dark but the rock proved barren and unclimbable. Nothing after dinner that we were dragging our anchor and drifting into rough water I got the Captain to let out two fathoms more of cable.\n\nThursday, 20th December.\u2014Made an early start for Kuah where we had arranged to meet His Highness the Raja Muda. It was still blowing fresh from the land. We reached Kuah about 9.0 and found the Raja Muda who had expected us the night before had gone on to Dayang Bunting so we followed. His small steamer was at anchor. He came on board and we went through an inland sea of wooded islands till we came to a small bay where we anchored and went ashore in boats to a long temporary jetty put up years ago for the King of Siam. We\nthen followed a good jungle path through a plantation of durian and other fruit trees planted by the late Wan Mat. Having mounted to the top of a low ridge we descended to the shore of the lake Dayang Bunting where a long Malay house has been built on piles on the edge of the lake. Here elaborate preparations were made for a feast, tables, chairs and everything being brought by the numerous Malays who accompanied us. Mr. Peel ventured on the lake in a small canoe. We then sent a man out to take soundings with the Seadog's lead. In the two places selected it was found to be 9 fathoms deep.\n\nThe lake is surrounded by jungle clad limestone cliffs some 500 to 1,000 feet high which enclose the lake except at the lower end where a low rocky ridge separates it from the sea. The lake (fresh water) is about 500 yards long. We took a sample of the water which I brought to Penang for analysis. After an excellent meal we went round by boat to what once must have formed the inlet to the present lake from the sea. Masses of limestone rock have blocked the entrance so that there is now no connection between lake and sea. After climbing some rocks about 10 feet high we looked right down on the lake the surface of which, so far as we could judge, appeared to be some 10 feet above the sea level. This is a mere conjecture. From Dayang Banting we should have gone to Tralga Injak but the Raja Muda wanted to show us the Goa Cherita (Legend Cave) which they said could be reached in an hour. As a matter of fact it took us 2\u00bd hours to get there. The scenery of this Archipelago is lovely as you wind about among the wooded hills. The highest hill is Gunong Raya which is over 3,000 feet high. A striking feature in the distance is the serrated range known as Gunong Chuchang. Once more we were destined to be disappointed in the matter of caves. The cave is a very ordinary limestone cave and the only interest that attaches to it is an inscription in Arabic character high on the limestone cliff at the entrance. Certain Arabic words and names can be made out but whether it is ancient as the Malays like to believe or only some hundred years old it is impossible to say. Below Malays and English visitors have inscribed their initials with charcoal and we were told to do the same. It was nearly dark when we started to return to Kuah. Fortunately we had a pilot who was\nable to direct our course through the winding channels sometimes very narrow and between high rocks. It was intricate navigation in the dark but we got safely back to Kuah about 8.0. We then landed and had dinner in a house built by WAN MAT after which we left with a Kedah pilot kindly lent by the RAJA MUDA.\n\nFriday, 21st December.\u2014Reached Penang about 7.0 A.M.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nThe best season to visit these States is undoubtedly December-January when delightful weather may be counted on. It is the dry season and a cool breeze blows continuously off the land. The Seabird is not fit for such a trip. The Damarang Rat though not much bigger is a better sea boat. When I describe the sea as \"rough\" I mean for a launch. In the Sea Belle the trip at this time of year would be a delightful one, Pung-a especially being worth a visit for its lovely scenery.\n\nOne thing that struck us was that during all the while we were at sea\u2014always in sight of land\u2014we hardly saw a junk, boat or sign of population. In Trang and to the Northward the Malays or Samsams resemble the Siamese. They do not speak Malay but are said to be Mohamedans. Mr. MAXWELL's remark in 1889 that the Siamese Government neither makes nor maintains roads is true now. Neither has the telegraph made any progress since that time. Mr. MAXWELL remarks further that these States all suffer from being regarded in Bangkok not as provinces to be developed but as mere sources of revenue to be spent at the capital. Sixty per cent. of the revenue still goes to Bangkok. There is evidently now a desire on the part of the Government at Bangkok to improve the local administration of these Western provinces and no doubt many reforms have been carried out in the last few years. At Trang there were many signs of progress visible. This I attribute to Mr. KHAW SIM BEE's energy and good administration.\n\nTongkah is a land of promise. A large number of schemes are going to be carried out but these promises evoke a smile from those who have been used to the administration of the palace. The country is evidently full of tin but the Government does nothing to improve the roads or open up the place. The\nharbour has silted up and a vessel of any size has to anchor a long way out. I cannot say whether the new harbour will be adopted and the town moved as is talked of.\n\nPulau, by the way, is the name of the town. Tongkah being the name of the island or what is really a peninsula as the narrow strait (Pa Prak) is only half a mile across and fordable by elephants at low tide.\n\nThe Strait is between Satang and Tubatung on the mainland hence the Malay name for Tongkah (Tong Satang corrupted to Junk Ceylon). No one can visit these places without seeing how dependent they are on Penang. Under a Government such as that of the Federated Malay States they could soon be changed into rich provinces and trade would expand in a wonderful manner. With mineral wealth and a fertile soil the population would increase and Chinese would be attracted to invest capital there. Under the present r\u00e9gime in spite of many reforms in the selection of officers, the administration of justice, etc., it may be doubted whether any substantial progress will be made toward opening up the country, at all events unless the revenue is spent on public works and improvements. Formerly when the mines were more prosperous 60 Sikhs were employed under Captain Weir but these have been dispensed with and the only British subjects beyond a few Penang-born Chinese appear to be Klings who trade in cattle with Penang. Capital punishment is not inflicted in these States\u2014those convicted of capital offences being sent to Bangkok.\n\nFrom the islands in this archipelago which are scarcely inhabited are procured edible birds' nests and guano.\n\nCaptain Rine of the Royal Siamese Navy showed us a collection of small clay figures of Buddha said to have been found by the collectors of guano buried in caves. Whether these are ancient as supposed or modern I am unable to say. Mr. Khaw Jit Kiat promised to send me some which I will forward to the Curator of the Raffles Museum.\n\nThe long wooded island of Pulau Lontar (said to be coveted by the Germans) lying to the North Trang fringed on the west by a sandy shore appears to be scarcely inhabited except by a few fishermen. The Langkawi group of islands are sparsely inhabited by Malays and there are said to be about 100 Chinese. A Chinese\nare planting pepper in one place. Pulau Adang, one of the Butong group lying to the North of the Langkawis and further out to sea, is visible on a clear day from Penang Hill. This lies near the track of the British India boats on the way to Rangoon and would be worth a visit.\n\nI enquired into the health of the place we touched at. In Kedah there is an Eurasian doctor (Boyer) who told me that there was little sickness. The drinking water is derived from the Kedah river which passes the Consulate and Anak bukit. The water is somewhat brackish and must be much polluted. Trang was said to be very healthy. In the early part of the year a few cases of plague occurred among the miners in Tongkah but this appears to have died out soon and the health of the place is now said to be good. The Siamese Government on the representation of our Government decided to appoint a Medical Officer to reside there. No one has yet been appointed and the Commissioner consulted me as to whether a Dr. Amner who has been residing there for some time was fitted for the place. I could only say that I believed he had the necessary qualifications but could not be sure. The Governor of Pung-a assured me that his place was extremely healthy and that there was no sickness.\n\nI had not visited Kedah, with which I was formerly well acquainted, for many years. It is a fine country\u2014a vast tract of padi land interspersed with low hills. The revenue has increased very considerably of late. The Sultan spends the revenue as he likes, sending the \"Bunga mas\" to the King of Siam as Suzerain. A Penang Chinaman advances money to the Malay cultivators and mills the rice purchased from them. Another Chinaman has opened up a sugar estate on the banks of the river below Alor star. The Sinkep Tin Mining Company are working with success near the base of Kedah Peak while there are large tapioca plantations near the Muda. Kulim at the back of Bukit Mertajam is a thriving place with Chinese tin mines and plantations. It would be an advantage if the railway were extended from Bukit Mertajam to Kulim as has long been proposed but the Sultan of Kedah is at present in such a feeble state of health that he hesitates to take any action in the matter though he says he will not object to the railway.\nIt is interesting to see how a purely Malay Government without European interference or guidance has endeavoured to model the administration on our colonial lines even to the appointment of an Auditor General. Only Malays are employed in the public offices most of them being men of good position. Here there is a real Post and Telegraph Office, the Telegraph Department being superintended by a son of the Government Munshi at Singapore.\n\nI cannot conclude without referring to the hospitable and kind way in which we were everywhere received, the authorities doing everything that could be done to make our visit agreeable and assisting me in my consular work.\nThe Relations between Southern India and the Straits Settlements.\n\nBY W. A. O'SULLIVAN.\n\nA few years ago, a very able paper was read by Mr. C. O. Blagden before the Straits Philosophical Society, on the subject of \"Arabian Influences in the Far East,\" and evoked a warm discussion. I thought with others at the time that Mr. Blagden claimed too great an influence for the Arabs, both as a converting and civilizing agency in the Far East. I have since so far modified that opinion, from wider reading, that I am now fully convinced that it was the Arab traders, or rather the Arab bandits whom they brought in their train, who effected the conversion to Islam of the vast majority of the people inhabiting the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian Archipelago. To this belief I have been induced, not so much by the discovery of any additional historical data beyond what the essayist put forward, as by the living testimony afforded by language, a proof more to be relied on than a thousand traditions. Almost every word in Malay connected with religious worship is pure Arabic, only modified by the difficulty the converts experienced in pronouncing the language of their teachers. The same is the case with the Chinese, Sundanese, Javanese\u2014in a word, with all the languages of the Archipelago whose speakers have embraced Islam; the Malays, it may be added, have also adopted the Arabic character.\n\nIt is not, then, to India that we have to look as having imparted to Malaya the present religion of its inhabitants, or such elements of its civilization as are bound up with their creed. But civilization and social development, much as they may owe to religion, are not coincident with it, and I think still that Mr. Blagden went too far in claiming for the Arabs the lion's share of influence on the social life of the Malays. Right throughout the Indian Archipelago (which I take for convenience sake to include this Peninsula) there co-exists with hukum, or religious law, a great unwritten code of native custom, known as adat. This\nnot only flourishes side by side with the hukum, but often overrides it when the two come into conflict. Of this adat, part is immemorial usage, with its roots so deep in the past that they may not be uncovered. Part, however, is of more modern growth, and under this I should class all that these peoples have derived from foreign influence. We have no historical data full enough to enable us to separate these with accuracy; yet to presume that the present civilization of Malays, over and above what is included in their religion, was wholly indigenous and pristine, is to reject such data as we do possess, to scorn the testimony of language, and to assume that the Malayan races possessed an ancient civilization of their own, of which there is not a particle of evidence.\n\nThe Arabs came to the Far East purely as traders accompanied, no doubt, by a few pandits or religious teachers, to whose proselytizing agency was due the establishment of the Mohammedan religion in the Archipelago. Some few would seem to have settled down, but, beyond the teaching which found such ready listeners, they appear to have had little influence on native social life, and especially on the adat. Indeed as good Moslems, they would feel bound to uphold the hukum in opposition to the latter. Whence, then, did the Malays get the balance of their civilization, from the simpler arts which separate them from the rudest of savages to the code of native custom which, just as much as the Arab creed, gives them a right to be regarded as a civilized race? I unhesitatingly reply, from India, and probably, by virtue of its proximity, from Southern India.\n\nThere are abundant traces, both in Sumatra and Java, but especially in the latter, of the existence, long anterior to Mohammedanism, of a very complete Hindu civilization. How this came about, whether by conquest or pacific conversion, it is now impossible to say. Nor have we any historical records to show us what Hindu nation it was that exercised the first civilizing influence. In Java, indeed, a great Hindu empire continued right down to the year 1475 A.D., when the conversion to Mohammedanism took place, and numerous ruined shrines testify how widespread was the earlier faith. But the conquering or proselytizing Hindu stranger has entirely disappeared, for al-\nthough the kings of Manjapahit claimed to be descended from princes of Hindustan, the purely Javan appearance of their descendants somewhat belies this tradition. The visible traces of such a civilization in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula are much more feeble than in Java; they are, indeed, confined to a few ruins and inscriptions on stones and rocks, the former of doubtful import and the latter practically undecipherable, though the character is either Sanskrit or Pali.\n\nIn the absence of such visible tokens, we turn again to that infallible guide, the language of the people. As I have said above, the influence of the Arabs on the Malay language is almost confined to religion and religious law, but does not otherwise enter into the social life of the people. Far otherwise is it with the influence of the Hindus. Marsden (Asiatic Researches, vol. iv, pp. 223-7) writes as follows:\u2014\"The language (i.e. Malay), it is true, abounds at present with Arabic words, which their writers affect to introduce, because this display of literary skill is at the same time a proof of their religious knowledge; but they are generally legal or metaphysical terms borrowed from the Koran or its commentaries, are never expressive of simple ideas, have not been incorporated into the language (a few excepted), and are rarely made use of in conversation. The Hindu words, on the contrary, are such as the progress of civilization must soon have rendered necessary, being frequently expressive of the feelings of the mind, or denoting those ordinary modes of thought which result from the social habits of mankind, or from the wills that tend to interrupt them.\"\n\nOf a truth Malay abounds in Sanskrit words, the significance of which is ably traced in the preface to Maxwell's Malay Manual. To go no further, the fact that the common Malay words for \"religion\" (agama), \"a plough\" (tenggala), \"time\" (kali, masa), with many others of the same kind, are derived from Sanskrit, points to Hindu influence as having first raised the Malay from barbarism, taught him some of the very crudest arts of civilization, and supplied him with a religion. Now, the Sanskrit element in Malay can only have come from India, and it fully justifies us, taking also into consideration the existence of a complete Hindu civilization proved by historical data to have subsisted in Java, in concluding that there must have been in\nearlier ages a domination of intellect, if not of conquest, by some Hindu power of Hindustan over the whole of Malaya.\n\nThe defect of the language-test is that it does not aid us, except inferentially, in fixing the date of the commencement of this domination or in determining the length of its existence; but it may help us to decide from what part of Hindustan the civilizing influence proceeded. As to the former, all we know for certain is that the Hindu influence was antecedent to that of Islam; while as to the latter, in addition to the very slender evidence of history and tradition, and comparison with the relations of India with neighbouring countries, we can take as our guide the various Indian elements which have found their way into the Malayan tongue.\n\nSanskrit\u2014that is, the pure Sanskrit of the Vedas\u2014ceased to exist as a living language about 300 B.C. Various dialects, however, more or less debased from Sanskrit, but having a vocabulary largely identical with the parent tongue, continued to subsist as spoken languages. It is not inconceivable that the Hindu influence on Malaya may have begun when Sanskrit was yet a living language. As regards Java however, the Dutch scholars have fixed the introduction of Hinduism at the beginning of the 6th century A.D., and it would seem probable that its extension to Malaya took place about the same epoch or even later. Be this as it may, it is most unlikely that this early civilization of the Malays, which coloured their language so strongly with Sanskrit words, proceeded from any other than a genuine Aryan race, of Hindustan, speaking Sanskrit or a dialect closely akin to it. But within historic times the South of India has been inhabited by Tamulic or Dravidian races; and had their first civilization been imparted to the Malaya by Hindus of this stock, the Sanskrit words would have been filtered through a Dravidian medium, and appeared in Malay in a quite different form from that which they have actually assumed. It must be taken for granted, than, that this earliest influence proceeded from a genuine Hindu race inhabiting central or northern India, and perhaps commanding a part of its seaboard in the South by virtue of conquest or commerce, and who made this the starting-point for their pioneering work in the Far East.\nI think we may entirely reject Crawfurd's theory that these first civilizers were Telegus. Had it been so, they must have left traces of their own vernacular on the Malayan speech, for it is inconceivable that the priests, as Crawfurd thinks, could have introduced into Malay elements of a dead language, used only for sacred purposes, as part of the common speech, while not a word of their own colloquial crept in to testify to the identity of the dominating race. For I think I am right in saying that there are few or no Telugu words in Malay, or, at all events, not one which might not equally well have come from Tamil.\n\nNone the less is it true a Dravidian race has had a very important influence on the language and social life of the Malays, and this in spite of Marsden's statement that \"from the Telinga or the Tamool the Malayan has not received any portion of its improvement.\" This influence was probably brought to bear on Malaya a good deal later than the Sanskrit, and was, without doubt, the direct result of trade. Commercial intercourse was maintained from a very early date between the South of India and the trading towns which formed the emporia of the spice islands, notably Johor, Singapore, and Malacca. When the Portuguese, at the commencement of the 16th century, first visited these places, they were amazed at the concourse of foreign vessels assembled there. When this intercourse began it is impossible to say, but it was probably much earlier than the above. Snouck-Hurgronje, writing of Aceh, says that the settlement of Klings from Southern India in that country is of great antiquity; and that the Tamils were the leaders in this commercial enterprise in Malaya is clearly shown by the pure Tamil words\u2014chiefly connected with commerce, though not altogether so\u2014which have found their way into Malay.\n\nThese words are not numerous, but they are names of familiar objects, and we must remember that, as a test of the social influence of one race on another, the presence of one common word for some necessary thing is of more significance than a thousand technical or scientific terms, which are really only a part of the language of books, and do not enter into daily life. The Malay for \"ship,\" Kapal, is pure Tamil, so are Kedei, \"a shop,\" and gedong, \"a storehouse.\" Peti, \"a box.\"\nthough it has a Sanskrit equivalent has also probably come through Tamil for in Sanskrit it means \"bag\" or \"basket,\" while in Tamil it has exactly the same meaning as in Malay. What can be clearer evidence of commercial intercourse\u2014may, of the Tamils having actually introduced the Malays to trade in bulk? They also imported and brought into use certain articles of commerce and animals with which the Malays were previously unacquainted, as is shown by the words cheratu, \"a cigar;\" badam, \"an almond;\" kuda, \"an ass;\" the fruit belumbang; beluda \"velvet;\" bedu, \"a gun\" (from the Tamil word \"vedli,\" an explosion or report). All the above are pure Tamil. The derivation of kuda, \"a horse,\" from kuthuru is not certain; but the pure Tamil padaga, \"boat,\" may reasonably be taken to be the parent of the Malay prahu. If this be so, it would seem as if the Tamils first introduced the Malays to even the most elementary navigation, and, as they also gave them lapot, taught them to \"go down to the sea in ships.\" A large number of words derived from the Sanskrit are common to both Tamil and Malay, the greater number of which were acquired independently by the two languages. The following are examples.\u2014Mal. Kali, Tam. kalai; Mal. dendu, Tam. thiralam; Mal. bahaya, Tam. hayam; Mal. maha, Tam. magam, &c. In nearly all these the terminal \"m\" is characteristic of Tamil; and where we find words derived from the Sanskrit which have this termination in Malay as well as in Tamil, we may fairly conclude that they come through the latter language and not direct from Sanskrit; e.g., talam, \"a pond\" Tam. talam, Sans. kola; and maniyam, \"a ruby,\" Tam. malaikam and Sanskrit manikya. Mampelem, \"a mango,\" is said by Maxwell to be derived from the Sanskrit pala\u2014great fruit,\" through Telugu; but the Tamil for mango is also mampelem, and I can see no reason for assuming it to be derived from the Telugu. Some other words derived from various languages, such as Persian, Hindustani, and Arabic, would seem to have also come through the Tamil, whose influence on Malay was undoubtedly antecedent to that of Arabic. As examples I may quote meja, \"a table\" (Pers.), Tam. mesai or meso; balu, \"balance\" or \"remainder\" (Ar.), Tamil bakku; kapu (Beng.), \"a pulley,\" Tamil kappi; topi (Beng.), \"a hat,\" Tamil toppi; apam, \"a cake\" (given by Marsden as\nfrom Hindustani), Tam., appam. To the above list may be added the curious Malay word for \"a bridegroom,\" menpelai, which is derived from the pure Tamil mepetar, \"a bridegroom.\" This, again, is indicative of a very early Dravidian influence on the Malays. Their previous Hindu civilization had given them the ceremony of marriage, but it was left for the Tamils to superadd a special title for the man on the eve of marriage, to whose position as such the Dravidians attach an unusual amount of dignity and importance.\n\nI think I have said enough to show the fallacy into which Marsden fell in refusing to ascribe to the Dravidians of Southern India any influence on the language of the Malays, and to make it plain that the influence of the former people over the speech and social life of the latter began at a very early date, though not so early as that of the unknown race of Hindus who reclaimed Malaya from its pristine barbarism. The Southern Indians came as traders\u2014pure and simple, bartering for the wealth of the rich tropic forests the products of civilization. They do not seem to have settled down or intermarried with the Malays to any great extent\u2014not, certainly, so much as in Aceh, where considerable colonies of Tamils took up their permanent abode. Their object being merely commerce, they went as they came, returning year by year as the monsoon favoured. In the earlier stages of this intercourse the Malays were probably Hindus like themselves, and would thus have admitted their visitors to a greater degree of familiarity and fellowship than is now the case. Then came the Arab conversion, favoured, no doubt, by such Tamils as had already embraced Islam; but from that time forth the Hindus became aliens to the Malays, and the closeness of their intercourse declined. The commerce, however, continued as before, and the relations which the Portuguese found existing in the beginning of the 16th century were practically those which subsisted until the influx of European trade imported a new factor into the question, and the establishment of British settlements on the shores of Malaya crystallized the connection between Southern India and the Straits into what it is at the present day.\n\nHad it not been for the successful introduction of Islam into the Far East by the proselytizing Arabs, we may suppose that\nthe Tamil influence would have grown in strength, and perhaps eventually have led to a considerable fusion of the races, especially along the coasts. Some such fusion has in later times produced the mixed race known as Jawi Pekan; but in this the Bengali element is quite as strong as the Tamil, owing to the large number of north Indians who came to the Straits, either as voluntary immigrants or against their will as convicts, in the days when the Straits Settlements still formed an appanage of the East India Company.\nThe Evolution of Malay Spelling.\n\nBy Rev. W. G. Shellabear.\n\nMuch has been written in the last hundred years on the theory of Malay spelling. Europeans, both Dutch and English, have worked out elaborate systems of orthography, and have laid down what they considered the proper rules to be followed, but the Malays have continued to spell as they please in spite of the efforts of the foreign scholars.\n\nThere is, however, at the present time so much diversity and inconsistency among the Malays themselves in regard to the spelling of even the commonest words, that it is very widely felt that a recognized system of orthography is most desirable; but Europeans have hitherto made the mistake of trying to bend the Malays to an elaborate, scientific system of foreign manufacture, the beauties of which the Malays are unable to appreciate.\n\nA more practicable plan would seem to be to make a thorough historical investigation of the evolution of the art of spelling among the Malays, with a view to determining what is the natural trend of the changes which have taken place in the past. It seems not unreasonable to expect that such an investigation may provide a clue to the possibilities of such spelling reform as will not be distasteful to the Malays themselves, and may therefore eventually commend itself to them for universal adoption.\n\nThe materials available in Singapore are not by any means adequate for a complete and exhaustive investigation of the history of Malay spelling, but it is hoped that the following contribution to the study of this subject will at least establish some important principles of spelling reform, and will if necessary stimulate others to further search.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the Arabs gained their religious ascendancy over the Malays during the 13th century, and that it was from them that the Malays received their present written character. The earliest Malay manuscripts now extant, however, do not date back more than half of that period. In No. 31 of this\nJournal I have already described some of the most interesting of these MSS., and particular care was taken to reproduce as exactly as possible the spelling of the originals. On page 107 of the paper above referred to, will be found a reference to certain MSS. belonging to the Cambridge University Library and described by Dr. van Ronkel in Part 2 of Series 6 of *Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb*. This paper by Dr. van Ronkel provides valuable material for the present investigation, the spelling of his extracts having also been reproduced with considerable accuracy. The Cambridge MSS. were taken to Europe from the East in the first decade of the 17th century, and one of them bears the date 1604. The earliest of the Oxford MSS. bears a Mohammedan date (A.H. 1011) equivalent to the year 1602 of our era, another is almost certainly of the same date, a third is dated 1612, and a copy of the *Hikayat Sri Rama* was probably also obtained at that time, as it belonged to the same collection, and came into the Bodleian library in 1633. For information in regard to the two Leiden MSS. and the Harleian MS., which I have also made use of though they are of a somewhat later date, the reader is referred to my paper in Journal No. 31. I have also in my possession careful copies of four other manuscript letters belonging to the Leiden University, but for the purposes of this paper I will confine myself to the manuscripts mentioned above, which have already been fully described by Dr. van Ronkel and myself and are available to the reader in the Journals referred to.\n\nAs compared with the changes which have taken place in the spelling of the English language since the days of Queen Elizabeth (to whom the oldest of the Oxford MSS. was addressed) it must be said that the differences between the Malay spelling of to-day and that of three hundred years ago are very few and very insignificant indeed\u2014an exemplification of the well-known fact that the Oriental is slow to change. Manuscripts and even printed documents of the date of Queen Elizabeth are so entirely different from modern English writings and books that they can only be read by those who have made them a special study. Our oldest Malay manuscripts, however, could be read to-day by any school boy with the greatest ease, with the exception of perhaps an unusual word or an obsolete spelling here and there.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\nIt is remarkable that these Malay MSS., written in many different places and as far apart as Aceh and Celebes, exhibit far less divergence from one another in regard to spelling than can now be found in native letters and even in printed works from different parts of the Archipelago. In those days, no doubt, the art of writing was practised by comparatively few persons, and they may have been scribes specially instructed in the art, whereas today thousands of comparatively uneducated natives write letters in Malay, and even print commercial and other documents in any kind of spelling. Moreover, the old manuscripts which have survived to tell us how the Malays wrote their language in those days are mostly official documents or religious and literary productions, all of which would naturally be written by the best educated natives of the time. These considerations will in a great measure account for the greater diversity of Malay spelling which now exists, but the remarkable uniformity in the spelling of the MSS. of the 17th century can only be adequately explained by the existence of some fixed standard of spelling to which the scribes felt it necessary to conform. That fixed standard, we may presume, was the Arabic system of orthography. It was undoubtedly directly from the Arabs that the Malays received their present written character, and it is quite probable that for many years, perhaps for centuries, the art of writing may have been almost entirely confined to those Arabs who had learned the Malay language.\n\nIt should moreover be remembered that at the time of the advent of the Arabs the Malays were already scattered all over the Archipelago, from the north of Sumatra to the extreme east of Java, and even as far as Celebes and the Moluccas, and must be regarded as having been at that time merely a number of independent units divided up under the rule of a great number of petty chiefs or rajas, who were often at war with one another, and none of whom were sufficiently powerful to exercise any commanding influence over the remainder. This makes it even more remarkable that there should be such striking uniformity in the spelling of the Malay language throughout the Archipelago at the period with which we are dealing. If the Arabs had attempted to make an adaptation of their own system of spelling to suit the peculiarities of the Malay language, the result would\nundoubtedly have been that in different parts of the Archipelago there would have been different modifications of the Arabic spelling, and a variety of Malay spellings would have been unavoidable. The uniformity in the spelling of the earliest manuscripts would therefore lead us to expect that the system of orthography according to which the Arabs originally began to write the Malay language and which they subsequently taught to the Malays, was precisely the same as they themselves used in writing their own language. Whether this was so or not is the first point which we will examine.\n\nIt should first be stated, that Arabic can be written either with or without vowel points, and books are printed at the present time in both styles. The plain or unvowelled style is the more common, but as the entire omission of vowel points would frequently cause ambiguity, the Arabs find it necessary in certain words to use one or more vowel points. This description of the way in which modern Arabic is printed applies exactly to the way in which Malay was written 300 years ago. Several vowelled Malay MSS. are extant. One of the old Cambridge MSS. contains twelve pages of Malay fully vowelled, and in the other MSS. mentioned above, vowels are used in isolated words. In committing an unknown language to writing, it is pretty certain that the Arabs would at first use all the vowel points, if only for the purpose of recording for their own use the sounds of the new language, and in all probability Malay would continue to be written with vowels for many years, until the scribes had become thoroughly familiar with the forms of all the common words, after which they would begin to drop the vowels from such words, retaining them only in the case of unusual words or peculiar derivatives. This is precisely the way in which we find that Malay was actually written at the beginning of the 17th century.\n\nWe will now proceed to show (I) that at the time when our MSS. were written the spelling as a general rule conformed exactly to the rules of Arabic orthography; after which it will be shown (II) that words which at that time were sometimes written otherwise than in strict accordance with Arabic orthography were being gradually introduced with the deliberate intention of doing away with the necessity for the use of vowel points and orthographical signs, and for the purpose of making\nsuch words more legible; and lastly we will consider (III) what alterations could be made to modern Malay spelling which would produce uniformity without destroying the Malay ideal of obtaining legibility without the use of vowels, that is to say without a retrograde movement in the direction of Arabic orthography such as has hitherto been advocated by European scholars.\n\nI With few exceptions the spelling of manuscripts 300 years old conforms exactly to the rules of Arabic orthography.\n\n(1) One of the first peculiarities which would be noticed by a person only acquainted with modern Malay spelling is that final *wa* and *ga* are only used in these MSS. for the purpose of forming the diphthongs *au* and *ar*. Thus we find the following words, which I have taken from all the different MSS., spelt without final *wa* or *ga* as the case may be:\n\n*al-hayya bata* *berhauti bata* *bersuka* *bap* *baca* *bong* *chok* *ha*\n\n*\u0686\u0648\u0686 \u0644\u0648\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0645 \u0628\u0631 \u0628\u062c \u0631\u0633\u0648\u062c \u0631\u0645 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0645\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0643 \u0627\u06a9*\n\n*dalu* *dara* *dara* *deguna* *de-taum* *alt* *hori* *hori* *wa* *wa*\n\n*\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u062a \u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a \u062f\u062a\u0648\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u0645 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0647\u0648\u0644*\n\n*an* *pala* *kula* *kama* *kama* *kaya* *keji* *kendalu* *tapi* *toki* *kulu*\n\n*\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0644\u0627\u06a9 \u0644\u0627\u06a9 \u06a9\u0627\u0644 \u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0628\u062a*\n\n*mata* *mata* *mata* *mampi* *mampi* *merhabali* *sama* *menapap*\n\n*\u0645\u0639\u0641 \u0645\u0645 \u062a\u062c\u0628\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0628\u0646\u0641 \u0645\u0644\u0648 \u0645\u0627\u062a \u0645\u062f*\n\n*monapale* *mangri* *olekane* *poge* *poge* *poge* *poge* *maka* *sepati* *seri*\n\n*\u0633\u0631 \u0633\u06cc\u0631\u062a: \u0633\u06a9\u0627\u0644 \u0631\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0648\u062c \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0641\u0631\u06af\u06a9 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0645 \u0646\u06af\u0631 \u0639\u0641\u0627\u062f*\n\n*sa-caba* *sama* *suka* *suka* *taha* *tekalu* *Teraati* *tung* *telap*\n\n*\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0641 \u062a\u0641\u06a9 \u062a\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0633\u06a9 \u0633\u0648\u062c \u0633\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0631\u0628*\nBut the following words ending in a diphthong are spelt with final *wau* and *ya* in every case in which they occur in these MSS:\n\n*aykau atau bagai berchrai birau hai harau hijau jikalan kalan*\n\u06a9\u0627\u0644\u0648 \u062c\u06a9\u0644\u0648 \u0647\u06cc\u0628\u0648 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0648 \u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0631\u062c\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u0648 \u0627\u06af\u06a9\u0648!\n*kerbau limau prsai rambai rantai rantau sayai tajau*\n\u0646\u0627\u062c\u0648 \u0633\u0648\u06af\u06cc \u0631\u0646\u0646\u0648 \u0631\u0646\u06cc \u0631\u0645\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u0644\u06cc\u0645\u0648 \u06a9\u0631\u0628\u0648\n\nWe find however that the scribe who wrote MS. G. had a strong prejudice in favour of final *wau* and *ya*, even in words which do not end in a diphthong, for he writes:\n\n*bri brani budi chuchu hari kasturi lembu mentri madeli majiri*\n\u0646\u0641\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0644\u0628\u0648 \u06a9\u0646\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0686\u062d\u0648 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u06cc\n*negri pri putri sakti sendiri sri bahru*\n\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0648 \u0633\u0631\u06cc \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0631\u06cc \u0633\u0642\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u06cc \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc\n\nBut he also spells *hari* without the *ya*, and all other words of this kind are spelt without the *ya* as *aku*, *hati*, *lalu*, *kembali*, *mengampu*, *tetapi*, etc.\n\nThe Leiden MSS. E. and D., which were written at the end of the 17th century, contain five of such words written with final *wau* or *ya*, and F., which is also of a later date, contains three. In all the other MSS. the only instances are *kati*, which is found once, and *negri*, which is sometimes spelt with the *ya* and sometimes without, and a few names of places in MS. C. which being unwovelled would hardly be recognized without the final weak letters.\n\nIt should be remarked that some of the words given above are spelt in a way which would be quite inexplicable on any other supposition than that they were originally vowelled, and these peculiar spellings are just the ones which never vary in any of the MSS. and are still in use at the present day, as for instance:\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\nBut though their spelling appears at first sight so peculiar, it must be remembered that according to the rules of Arabic orthography these words could not be spelt in any other way, except that perhaps might be spelt but it will be noticed later on that only one weak letter appears to have been used in any word, and that therefore, the was being required to form the final dipthong au, the which would otherwise be inserted to mark the stress has been omitted.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Dutchman van Elbingen, who with his own hand copied portions of the Cambridge Ms., adhered rigidly to the Arabic orthography of the originals from which he was copying, but when left to his own unaided genius in writing out a list of Malay words with their meanings in Dutch, he followed the more natural method of spelling to which the Malays have now attained, as will be seen from the following examples taken from his vocabulary, dated 1st June, 1604:\n\nAt the present time the use of final and has become almost universal, and many Malays would be quite unable to read the words given above if they were spelt thus.\n\n2. In modern Malay, for the sake of legibility, a final is usually written in such words as , etc. In the Arabic system of orthography, the sound of the short final a as it is pronounced in most Malay words is represented merely by the vowel placed over the preceding consonant; the addition of would indicate a lengthening of the vowel. The number of Malay words, however, which have the long a sound in the last syllable is very small, the following being a few of them:\n\nbla tea sala lea depa\nThese and a few Arabic words such as\n\ndunia ulama hukama\n\nare the only ones which by the rules of Arabic orthography will allow a final *alif*. In modern Malay, however, the following forms are common:\n\nara antara bawa bichura bila buta bahwa dua jala\n\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062a\u0627 \u0628\u0686\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u0627\njawa jua kula kota kuda lada mulia pala perkara pinta roda\n\u0631\u0648\u062f\u0627 \u0641\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u0643\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627 \u0644\u0627\u062f\u0627 \u0643\u0648\u062f\u0627 \u0643\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u062c\u0648\u0627 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0627\nsabda sahya sedia sigra setia tara tanda tua\n\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0633\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0633\u0643\u0631\u0627 \u0633\u062f\u064a\u0627 \u0633\u0647\u064a\u0627 \u0633\u0628\u062f\u0627\n\nThis spelling will not be found in these ancient MSS. It is therefore very evident that in this respect the Malay has a tendency to depart from the strict Arabic spelling of former times. Such words as the following, on the other hand, continue to be spelt without the final *alif*:\n\noda anyaya apa apabila bapa biasa binasa daya dia hamba ia\n\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0628 \u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u067e\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0641\u06cc\u0644 \u0627\u0641 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u062f\njika kucha kata kaya kerja kuasa lama mata masa manusia mula\n\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0633\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0648\u0633 \u06a9\u0631\u062c \u06a9\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0627\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u062c \u062c\u06a9\nnama pada puasa pula raja rasa rupa serta suara suka sagalu tanya\n\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u06a9\u0644 \u0633\u0648\u0643 \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0631\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0641 \u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0641\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u0648\u0627\u0633 \u0641\u062f \u0646\u0627\u0645\n\n(3) In the old Malay MSS, the weak letters *alif*, *wau* and *ya* are not used in the middle of a closed syllable to lengthen the vowel sound, except in words of Arabic origin, such as:\u2014\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\nThese words are pronounced by the Arabs with the stress on the last syllable, but the Malays, though retaining this spelling, put the stress on the penultimate, where it is found in the great majority of Malay roots. There are quite a number of words in the Malay language which have the stress upon the final syllable, and in many cases this final syllable which bears the stress is a closed syllable, but the long vowel sound which the Arab gives to the words quoted above is never heard in a Malay word, it is therefore not to be expected that the Arabs would teach the Malays to write the quiescent weak letter in such words as *sebot*, *renong*, *prang*, *dras*, *kring*, etc. As a matter of fact we never find the weak letter in such words in the old MSS.* though in modern Malay these words are frequently written\n\nand we now even find such forms as the following, where the stress is distinctly on the penultimate:\n\nThe nearest approach to the long vowel sound in a closed syllable in Malay, is to be found in the two mono-syllables *pun* and *dan*, and it is a remarkable thing that these two words are invariably written with the weak letters *wau* and *alif* respectively in all of our old MSS. and are so written up to the present time. Robinson in his \"Malayan Orthography\" rejects this method of spelling *pun* and *dan*, which he considers ought to be spelt *\u0641\u064f\u0646\u0652* and *\u062f\u064e\u0646\u0652*: the evidence of the old MSS. is,\n\n* The spelling \u062a\u0631\u0633\u0628\u064a\u0629 on p. 116, line 12, R. A. S. Journal Str. Br. No. 31 will be found on reference to the photographic reproduction of MS. A. to be a misprint.\nhowever, strongly in favour of the received method of spelling these words.\n\n(4) Another remarkable difference between the spelling of our MSS. and modern Malay spelling is in the use of the orthographical sign *tashdid*, which means \"strengthening,\" and indicates that the letter over which it is placed is to be doubled or sounded twice. This sign is now hardly ever used by Malays, except in Arabic proper names, such as Allah \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 and Muhammad \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f but in our MSS. it is used with great frequency.\n\n(a) It is used over the weak letters *wa* \u0648 and *ya* \u064a whenever the preceding consonant bears the corresponding vowel sound, thereby showing that the said weak letter answers the double purpose of vowel and consonant. Thus the word *dia* \u062f\u06cc\u0627 is considered as consisting of the two syllables *di-ya*, and is written not \u062f\u06cc\u0627 but \u062f\u06cc\u0627 \u0648 \u0628\u0648\u062a and *buat* \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a is considered as consisting of the two syllables *bu-wat* \u0628\u0648\u062a and is written not \u0628\u0648\u062a but \u0628\u0648\u062a. This use of *tashdid* appears to be precisely the same as is found in the Arabic words *iyak* \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0642 and *niyat* \u0646\u06cc\u0627\u062a and in the termination \u0646\u06cc\u0627\u062a.\n\nThis appears to be sufficient to account for this method of spelling, which is found in the following words in the old MSS.,\n\n*buat dia diam dua ia jua luar nuat*\n\nThis double use of the weak letter, first as vowel and then as consonant, finds its counterpart in the Dutch language, where one meets such words as *hunen*, *vrouwen*, etc., and it is therefore not unnatural that the Dutch have adopted this peculiar spelling of Malay, even in the roman character, thus:\u2014*diya*, *buwat*, *diyam*, *duwa*, *iya*, *juna*, *luvar*, *nuwat*, etc., though one or two of the Dutch scholars have protested against the use of the *w* and *y* as being redundant. For instance Dr. Gerth v. Wijk writes in his grammar, p. 21: \"Although in the Javanese, for instance,\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\nowing to the nature of its spelling, in such words as \"boerang, tyau,\" the e and j are written, and must be used in transliterating them in our character, if one wishes to reproduce the original spelling exactly. These letters are quite superfluous in Malay transliteration. The union of e and i with the following u, r, or s takes place of itself in the pronunciation; we do not write huan, kuiren, but simply hua, kuire; and even less is it necessary in boerang, tyau, etc. If the Malay wrote the tashdid, it would be reasonable to represent it in the transliteration. Being opposed to superfluous letters, I write ia, iap, locar, etc., which seem to me quite sufficient, as this method of spelling represents the pronunciation as clearly as one can desire.\n\nThe Malays appear to prefer to divide the syllables as follows:\u2014hout, dua, di-an, pa-a, mu-at, etc., for the modern Malay spelling of such words is\n\nbeat dua hout pa muat lou sa-sa\n\n(4) Another frequent use of tashdid in the old MSS. is for the purpose of doubling the consonant which follows the short vowel, called by the Javanese peper, the sound of which may be described as equivalent to the short a in the English words \"balloon,\" \"machine,\" etc.\n\nAmong our old MSS. we find that II. 6, 45 of the Cambridge MSS. is the most consistent in this use of the tashdid, the following words which contain short vowels being thus spelt in the brief extract given by v. Bonkell,\n\nbahwa besar bema dengen kelat kras loeh telah tanah\n\nA portion of another Cambridge MSS., Gg. 6, 10, in the handwriting of the Dutchman v. Elbinck, has the following words\n\nbahwa besar belah gomater kelat siu smoh telah tetap\nand Dd. 5. 37 of the Cambridge collection, which is in the same hand-writing, has sa-blas tebus\n\nbut also bahwa dengan lebih telah without the tashdid.\n\nThe only other Cambridge MS. in which I have found the tashdid used in this way is Ll. 6. 5, which has once, and\n\nIn the Oxford MSS. marked A. B. and C. in my paper in No. 31 of this Journal, we find the following words:\n\nbri blum Chelay Deli dergar dergan glar kapal kapitan\n\nkati kekang keji megat memegang memeli meli negri netiasu\n\npesan petrana Rekan suka suka-chita Samudara sudah seni telok\n\nBut these MSS. have also some of these very words, and several others of the same kind, spelt without the tashdid. Denyan has the tashdid only once, in B. Bahwa, which almost always has tashdid in the Cambridge MSS., never has it in the Oxford MSS. Demar is spelt without tashdid in A.\n\nThe Oxford M.S. of \"Hikayat Sri Rama\" has the following\n\nblas besar betul genap kecil selang sa-telah sudah\nbut one or two of these are also found without the tashdid, as well as some which have it in the other MSS., as:\n\nbedura bri dengan menengar tenjah\n\n\u0646\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u062f\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0652\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that the early Dutch translators of the Bible made a wide use of the tashdid, and even when spelling such words in the roman character they were in the habit of placing a stroke over a letter in place of the tashdid. Thus we find: \"suddah, kenna,\" etc., and even the following words, which are not found in our MSS., viz.,\n\n\"makka, padda, derri, sagalla, adda, appa, bagyi.\"\n\nCuriously enough the use of tashdid with the short vowel, after having completely gone out of use, was introduced once more in the middle of last century by the lexicographer van de Wall. This writer, however, does not use the tashdid indiscriminately with all words containing the short vowel, as appears to have been done in the old MSS., but confines its use to those words which have the accent on the short vowel. Such words for instance, as,\n\nkrau kekal betul blum peguy bli keji glar blah\n\n\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0643\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0639\u0652 \u0628\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0633\u0652\n\nwhich carry the tashdid in the old MSS., are written by van de Wall without it, and we find him using this sign only in such words as:\u2014\n\n\"dengngan redda kemna petjijah\"\n\n\u0628\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0646\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0646\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0631\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u067e\u0650\u062a\u0652\u062c\u0650\u062c\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\n\nIn regard to this use of tashdid he himself says in his introduction to the first volume of his uncompleted dictionary, p. xvi.: \"As in the case of the vowel points and other signs, the Malays in their ordinary writing disregard the tashdid, 'sign of strengthening,' which when placed over a letter shows that that letter must be doubled; but that is no indication of its non-exis-\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\n\"tence or of its being unnecessary. The Malay who has learnt\n\"to read the Koran, not only knows what the tashdid is, but also\n\"feels the advantage of it in Malay, for if one gets him into a cor-\n\"ner he will at last say: buboh-lah tashdid, 'just put a tashdid\n\"over it.'\n\n\"The non-use of the tashdid leads the Malay sometimes to\n\"the most peculiar spelling. For instance he is conscious that in the\n\"word r\u00eblda, 'to abate' (as a storm or sickness) the accent lies\n\"on the first syllable and ought to be expressed, which it is not by\n\"writes \u0631\u0627\u062f, without troubling himself about the fact that it is\n\"absurd to lengthen the \u0113. Some words, which are written with\n\"the same letters and vowel points, could not be distinguished\n\"from each other without the tashdid, as \u0644\u062a\u0646\u0642 l\u00ebttak (accent on the\n\"2nd syllable) interj. for a certain clinking sound, and \u0644\u062a\u0646\u0642 l\u00ebttak\n\"to place. I therefore use the tashdid everywhere in my diction-\n\"ary, where the pronunciation demands it, and write \u0631\u0627\u062f r\u00eblda,\n\"\u062f\u06a0\u0646 d\u00ebngyan, \u0645\u0637\u062a\u0627 m\u00e9ttta 'raging.' And do we not ourselves\n\"write for instance kud-de, ku-ne, indifferent as to the reason\n\"for doing so. It should be noted that in Malay words the\n\"double consonants only appear after the \u0113.\"\n\nFrom this it is evident that the Malay writers of the begin-\nning of the 17th century used the tashdid in a different way to\nthat advocated by Werndly, Robinson and van der Wall, and\nmoreover none of these methods of using this sign can be regard-\ned as being directly based upon the Arabic system of ortho-\ngraphy. The methods invented and used by Werndly, Robinson\nand van der Wall were purely arbitrary, and soon fell into disuse,\nand there seems to be every reason to believe that the use of tash-\ndid as found in our MSS. was also purely local and arbitrary.\nfor it is a remarkable fact that all the MSS. in which this use\nof tashdid is found almost certainly came from Acheen, and I\nhave not been able to find the tashdid used with the short vowel\nin any of the MSS. which we know to have been written elsewhere. The Oxford MSS. A. B. C. have already been proved to have come from Acheen; of the Cambridge MSS. Gg. 6. 40 contains a vocabulary written by Pieter Willenssz. van Elbinck, and dated Acheen, 1st June, 1604: Dd. 5. 37, and the 2nd part of Gg. 6. 40, which contains the writing in question, are both written by the same hand as the vocabulary, and the former closes thus (in Dutch) \"end of the Story of Joseph, written the 1st October, 1604, by Pieter Willems.\" The only MS. therefore about which there remains any uncertainty as to whether or not it was written at Acheen, is Ll. 6. 5. of the Cambridge MSS. but there seems, from what Dr. v. Ronkel says, to be no reasonable doubt that this MS. came into the hands of Erpenius with those bearing the name of the same Pieter Willems, whom he believes to have brought all these MSS. from the East, with the exception of Dd. 9. 55., which never belonged to Erpenius.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that, at the time when these MSS. were written, Acheen was one of the most powerful Malay States. In his letter to King James (Oxford MS. C.) the King of Acheen claims sovereignty over all the rajas in Sumatra as well as Perak and Pahang on the Peninsula, and from the accounts of Lancaster's voyages he seems to have been able to enforce his authority at least as far south as Priaman (near Padang). In this connection I was interested to find the statement made by van de Wall, in his introduction mentioned above, that the original Malay spelling is known as \"Achinese spelling.\" Where van der Wall obtained his information in regard to the name heja Acheh I have not been able to discover, but if it is a fact that this method of spelling, found in all its purity in our Acheen MSS. of 300 years ago, is still known by tradition among the Malays as \"Achinese spelling,\" this would seem to point to Acheen as having been the chief centre of learning and literature at that time, and perhaps even earlier. This would entirely agree with the accounts of Lancaster's first voyages, which state that the educated Malays at Acheen spoke Arabic fluently, and Lancaster himself held intercourse with the Malays at that place in the Arabic language, having as his interpreter a Jew who spoke Arabic.\nMy contention therefore is, that the use of *tashdid* to indicate the short vowel sound was merely a local custom at Acheen, which the influence of even such a comparatively powerful State did not avail to bring into general use in the Archipelago. If this usage had been in accord with the Arabic orthography, it would undoubtedly have been universally adopted in the same way as the *tashdid* over *wa* and *ya* mentioned in the last paragraph (4. a.).\n\n(5) We next come to the use of the weak letters *alif*, *wa*, and *ya* in open syllables. Their use at the end of a word has already been considered in (1) and (2). We will now inquire when and for what purpose these weak letters were used in the old MSS. in the middle of (a) root words, (b) derivatives.\n\n(a) In root words, the weak letters are found in the open syllable upon which the accent falls, except in the case of the short vowel. The accent being usually on the penultimate, that is the syllable in which the weak letter is usually found.\n\nIn accordance with the rules of Arabic orthography, a weak letter when thus placed in an open syllable after a corresponding vowel is \"quiescent and then serves only to lengthen the vowel which precedes it.\" * Thus in the word \u0641\u0627\u062f \"sufficient,\" the vowel of the penultimate is lengthened by the *alif*. The preposition \u0642\u062f is, however, never spelt with an *alif*: not that there is any very appreciable difference in the pronunciation of these two words, but rather perhaps on account of the fact that in conversation less stress will naturally fall upon a preposition than upon a noun, adjective or verb. This seems to be the only possible way to account for the absence of the *alif*, *wa* and *ya* in such words as\n\n* sudah maka pada deri sayala*\n\nwhich in our MSS., as far as I have noticed, are the only words which do not have the lengthening weak letters in the accented syllable, with the exception of the foreign word *sandagur* which\n\n* Faris' Arabic Grammar.*\nis spelt \u0633\u0648\u062f\u0643\u0631 in every case, the afft being perhaps omitted in\nthe penultimate on account of there being already a weak letter\nin the first syllable to form the diphthong au.\n\nThe following are words of two or more syllables having\nthe weak letter in the penultimate,\n\nbemira chitaka gana hanga etc. phina kling phibna suthu\n\n\u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u063a \u062c\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648 \u0686\u0644\u0627\u06a9 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u06a9\n\nKerma is invariably spelt \u06a9\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 which would indicate that this\nword was at that time a three syllable word with the accent\nupon the first syllable; now it is sometimes pronounced as if it\nwere a two syllable word.\n\n(b) In derivative words formed by the juxtaposition of two\nroots, the lengthening weak letter is almost invariably found\nonly in the penultimate, being entirely omitted in the first of\nthe two words forming the compound, as:\n\napabila balabalang sala-chita\n\n\u0633\u0628\u06cc\u062a \u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0644\n\nThe same is the case in reduplications wherever the agla dua\nis not used, as,\n\ndaging-daging, mudah-mudahan, ragasaya\n\n\u0648\u062c\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0645\u062f\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u062f\u06af\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0647\n\nThe omission of the weak letter in the first word in such\ncases is undoubtedly phonetic, the stress being strong on the\npenultimate of the compound.\n\nWhen, however, we come to the case of derivative words\nformed by the addition of suffixes, we immediately meet with a\ndifficulty which, as far as my reading has gone, has never yet been\nexplained by any European writer, namely that when the suffix,\npronoun or other particle is added to the root, the position of\nthe lengthening weak letter is changed, and is found in the\npenultimate of the derivative word thus formed. For instance\nby the addition of the preposition \u0646 becomes in the old MSS. \u0643\u0646\u0627\u0646 although the pronunciation is not kud\u00e1-nya, but k\u00fada-nya; and \u062c\u0627\u062f becomes \u062c\u0627\u062f although the word is pronounced jadikan and not jadikan.\n\nThe first of the Dutch scholars to point out this discrepancy between the spelling of derived Malay words and their actual pronunciation appears to have been van de Wall, who in the year 1859 wrote as follows in the Tydschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde:\u2014\"But the change of position of the lengthening letter to, or its appearance in the penultimate of root words, has in most words no influence upon the accent, or at least very little; that is to say, the accent is in such cases not inherent in the long vowel. In general, the Malay retains in such cases the original accent, and says: b\u00e1ntu, b\u00e1ntu, perb\u00e1ntuan, b\u00e1ntu-nya, etc., s\u00e8wa, s\u00e8wakan, s\u00e8wai, pers\u00e8waiin, s\u00e8wa-nya, etc. But as the literary Malay always has an inclination to modify the pronunciation of the people according to the way a word is written, he also lays a stress to some extent on the syllable which has the long vowel, so that there come to be, as it were, two accents\u2014a strong or commanding one, the natural accent of the root, and a weak one, the grammatical accent on the long vowel. The variations between strong and weak are very numerous, in different words and with different individuals, and there exists no fixed rule; there are even words, though very few, in which owing to the change in the position of the long vowel the natural accent of the root is entirely lost and only the grammatical accent remains; e.g. kat\u00e1-nya, from katu; tambangan from tambay; though one also hears tambangun.\"\n\nThree years later, in Vol. XII of the same Journal, A. B. Cohen Stuart raises a somewhat half-hearted protest against van de Wall's statement in regard to the pronunciation of such words. He says (page 68): \"It is not without hesitation that I venture some objections to this proposition. I feel how unfavourably I am situated as compared with Mr. van de Wall\nin regard to a subject about which he is in such an infinitely better position to form a correct opinion. I was therefore at first inclined silently to accept as information his observations as to accent; after further consideration, however, I found it preferable to come forward fearlessly with my doubts, and to expose myself if need be to a crushing repudiation if this should be able to bring me, and perhaps others also, to a better view on the subject.\n\nI confess then that I have hitherto been under the conviction that in Malay the accent is derived as well as in most words fell as a rule upon the penultimate: that on the addition of a suffix the position of the accent changed as a rule from that which was originally the penultimate to that which was originally the last syllable: and that the pronunciation which according to Mr. van de Wall is the true and natural one, was quite peculiar to Europeans. It is so, I believe, in Javanese. It is true that there the accent does not come out so clearly as in Dutch, and in the Javanese grammar of T. Boorda (\u00a787) the very existence of any accent in Javanese is denied: but what is there called \"a slower or more sleepy pronunciation of the two last syllables of every polysyllabic word\" is more correctly interpreted, as it seems to me, as being a real accent on the penultimate, and a drawing out or longer holding on to the last syllable. Indeed, if one pronounces tulis, for instance, in the pure Dutch style with a clear accent on the penultimate, though this may not give the exact Javanese pronunciation, it is certainly much nearer to it than if one should say tulis with an equally plain accent on the last syllable: and similarly the pronunciation of the same word with the affix an, would, I believe, be better represented by tulisan or tulisan than by tulisan or tulisan. If the word is again increased by the addition of another suffix, so that the original accented syllable is separated from the new suffix by one or more syllables, then besides the principal accent, which goes over to the last, the original accent again makes its appearance to some extent, as in tulisanan, ngitirwaten. In a word, without digressing further, my proposition in the main is this: that in Javanese at any rate there actually is in the pronunciation of every word of two or more syllables a sort of stress, which can properly be\ncalled an accent, and is usually situated in the penultimate,\nand with the addition of an affix changes its position to the\nnew penultimate. The fact that Europeans pronounce both\nJavanese and Malay words so frequently, I might say almost\nalways, with the accent on the ante-penultimate, even when\nthis is merely a grammatical prefix, and say for instance\ntulisun, Pangeran, K\u00e1litan, P\u00e1chitan, would surely be the\nstrongest argument against that assertion, if that pronunciation\nmust be considered as having its origin in an unprejudiced con-\nception of the native pronunciation. But the Javanese and\nMalay words which are most used by Europeans are generally\nlearned not so much by conversation with the natives as from\nwritings, in which owing to faulty transliteration the exact\npronunciation and particularly the accent are left quite uncer-\ntain. For one European who first learns to pronounce say the\nword Pangeran from the Javanese, there are perhaps twenty\nwho became acquainted with it only or in the first place\nthrough European conversation or writings; and even if one\nafterwards had the opportunity of hearing it pronounced by\nnatives, then one would have to pay a good deal of attention\nand must have some interest in the subject in order to re-\ncognize and to abandon a wrong pronunciation which one has\nonce appropriated; especially when it is so generally accepted\namong our fellow countrymen that it would appear to be\npedantic or eccentric to deviate therefrom. If one considers\nthat in Dutch and kindred languages the accent, far from\nhaving any preference for the penultimate, usually falls fur-\nther back, one will not be surprised to see this tendency in the\nEuropean pronunciation of native words. This phenomenon\ntherefore has in my opinion no more value in deciding the true\nnative pronunciation, than one would be justified in doubting\nthat the name Palembang should properly be pronounced\nPal\u00e9mbang (Javanese pa-l\u00e9m-bang) because the majority of\nEuropeans, even if they have lived there for years, called it\nPalembang; or that the place where I am writing this is called\nS\u00e1l\u00e1, because Europeans, although they know better, never\ncall it anything but Solo among themselves.\n\nAs regards Malay, no one is less able than myself, especi-\nally in opposition to Mr. v. d. Wall, to refer to my own\nobservations on the native pronunciation. So let us rather consider what others have said on the subject. In Marsden (Kloot's translation p. 202) I only find the general statement, that the accent usually coincides with the long vowel, and falls by preference upon the penultimate, but without further elucidation of peculiarities. De Hooglander (Handboek tot de beoordeeling der Mal. taal- en letterkunde, 2nd ed., Breda, 1836) says on the accent in words having only one suffix (page 23, \u00a7 7), that they are pronounced both ways, either with the accent on the syllable which had the accent in the root (mendagatkan, karadipera) or on the penultimate of the derived word (mendagatkan, karapau), and nothing further. By Wernsdy (Mal. Spraakwet, Amst. 1736) the subject is treated more fully (p. 15 et seq.), and in the following manner, namely that the suffixes kan, i, an, lu, nu, nu always cause the accent to change its position to the syllable immediately preceding them, whether that syllable be open or closed; that the same thing takes place before teh, teh, teh, if a vowel, dipthong or h precede them; while on the other hand, if another consonant precedes one of these three suffixes, the accent shifts to the preceding syllable or remains unchanged at will (sambat-loh or sambat-tah); and that the change of accent results in the change from long to short vowel and vice versa, except when the final consonant meets the initial consonant of the suffix, as jahada. In the new edition of Wernsdy's grammar by Angelbeek (Batavia 1823, p. 38) it is only stated in general that in words of two or more syllables, whether they be roots, or compound or derived words, the accent falls usually upon the penultimate, and that 'the syllable on which the accent falls must naturally be pronounced longer than the others.' I do not know how much reliance can be placed upon the testimony of these writers on such a point as this; certainly under the most favourable circumstances they can hardly outweigh the dictum of Mr. van de Wall; but their rule, as regards the cardinal point, seems to me to find such strong support on the one hand in the analogy of the Javanese language, and on the other in the indications given by the spelling of Malay in the Arabic character, that even the dictum of Mr. van de Wall,\nwhile it shakes my belief in their accuracy, has not been able to destroy it; and so much the less because Mr. van de Wall's presentation of the subject is itself not quite clear. He says (73, 399) 'the first result of the suffixes kan, i, an, nya, ku, lah, tak, kah, on roots which end in an open syllable is, that they lengthen the vowel of that syllable and cause the original long vowel of the root to drop out; . . . . . . the suffixes an and i, since they begin with a vowel, cause the same result in words which end in a closed syllable, and in that case the final consonant of the root becomes the initial letter of the suffix with the corresponding vowel . . . . . . while the other suffixes leave such words unchanged . . . . . . ; but the change of position of the lengthening letter to or its appearance in the penultimate of root words (read, of derived words? or in the last syllable of root words) has in most words no influence upon the accent, or at least very little; that is to say, the accent is in such cases not inherent in the long vowel.'\n\nHere first of all the question arises: is the change of position of the lengthening letter a mere graphic phenomenon, does it only exist in the Malayo-Arabic character and the transliterations thereof, or does the same change in the length of the vowels take place in the pronunciation? If this is maintained, I must then further ask how such a rule can have arisen in the written character, a character which so to speak does not belong to the language, and if such were the case might be expected to have preserved in this respect the traces of a long obsolete condition of the language or perhaps of some kindred dialect, but which, borrowed from an entirely foreign language and probably first applied to the Malay in comparatively recent times, must be reckoned as rendering the native pronunciation in common use as accurately as the foreign characters will allow?\n\nI could understand that the retention of the original spelling of a root ending in a consonant when followed by a suffix beginning with a consonant, might arise from an idea of producing legitimacy, so as not to entirely deprive the word of vowel signs, and that one might therefore write for instance \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0643\u0646 although perhaps (according to Werndly) \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0643\u0646 might better\nrepresent the pronunciation; but how could anyone think of\nwriting \u0641\u062f\u0641\u0627\u0646 if in this derivative, as in the root, the first a is\nto be pronounced long and the second short, or above all things\nhow could this spelling come into general use? If, however, in\nthis respect the pronunciation agrees with the spelling,\nthen though allowing that the length of the vowel is some-\nthing quite different from the accent, it would be difficult for me\nto imagine such a change in the first syllable and in the division\nof the syllables otherwise than in connection with and a result\nof a corresponding change in the position of the accent. Even\nif it be admitted that the first change could be imagined with-\nout the last, and that it actually exists in Malay, how can one\nconceive that the inclination to modify the pronunciation of\nthe people according to the way a word is written, could lead\nto the alleged tendency of literary Malays to place, in addition\nto the natural accent, a second, grammatical accent on a syl-\nlable which properly had no claim whatever to any accent at\nall? Indeed in that case the written word is already, without\nthat misplaced accent, in entire agreement with the true pro-\nnunciation; but then the Malay himself must comprehend too\nwell the difference between length and accent to confuse the\none with the other and thus to let himself be misled into such\nan unnatural pronunciation.\n\nMoreover, that the Arabic character, by its imperfect re-\npresentation of the pronunciation and especially owing to the\nhabit of omitting the vowel points, has really exercised some\ninfluence upon the pronunciation, can, I believe, be properly im-\nferred from some corruptions which find therein a complete ex-\nplanation. I find a strong example of this in the word \u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632\u0648\nwhich is pronounced marga-satwa, instead of marga-satwa, as it\nshould be sounded according to the Sanskrit spelling. There\nwould certainly be nothing astonishing about this corruption\nin itself; but it is difficult to ascribe to mere chance the fact\nthat the corruption is just of such a kind, as is favoured by the\nillegible manner of writing without vowels; to which the fact\nthat it is probably not an everyday word may also have con-\ntributed. The same thing, though with less foundation, may\nbe supposed in regard to \u0633\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u06cc pronounced satia, manusia,\nwith three and four syllables, in place of satya, manusya, with two\nand three syllables. Perhaps in the same way the spelling\nmight have caused the change in the pronunciation\nfrom mendaparkan to mendaparkan; but in grammatical forms it\nis more difficult to admit that much an influence upon the\npronunciation of the people could have come from a compara-\ntively recent written character. And for the influence which\nMr. van de Wall ascribes to it, I can not even find a reason-\nable cause.\n\nThese extracts have been translated from the Dutch, and\nare given here at such great length for the benefit of those to\nwhom the Dutch Journals are not available. Before stating\nmy own views on this question of the spelling and pronunciation\nof derived words, it seemed only fair to give the reader the\nfacts and arguments which have already been used on both\nsides.\n\nThere can be no question but that, as stated by Cohen Stuart,\nthe Dutch scholars up to the time of van de Wall universally held\nthat the Malays actually pronounce such words as they are\nwritten. How they can have been led to this conclusion can\nperhaps be understood when it is considered that their study of\nthe Malay language was prosecuted for the most part in Java or\nin places which are under strong Javanese influence. Robinson\nformed this opinion because he learnt the language in Batavia\nand Bencoolen. Marsden also studied at Bencoolen, and wrote\nhis grammar and dictionary in England, where of course he had\nnot the advantage of native help.*\n\n*The Dutch scholar H. N. van der Tuuk seems to have had no personal\nknowledge of the way in which the Malays of the Peninsula pronounce\nderived words, for he wrote in 1866 in his notes to Abdullah's Pancha\nTundaran:\u2014 The writer always spells thus, and not\nand so also he spells \u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u0648 \u064a\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0647 and not\nand not \u0633\u064a\u0641\u0627\u0643\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0643\u064a\u0627\u0643\u0627\u0647. In the Menangkabau dialect the accent\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\nWhether the Dutch scholars of the present generation have universally accepted van de Wall's dictum in regard to the change of accent in derived words, I am unfortunately not in a position to know, the Library here not being very well supplied with the latest Dutch works on the Malay language, but as far as I am able to discover, the grammar of Gerth v. Wijk, published in 1893, is now considered the best Dutch work on the Malay language. This author is in entire agreement with van de Wall, for on page 46, para. 96, he writes: \"The original, 'natural accent (of the root word) is usually retained when the word takes a suffix, e.g., banding, bandingan; kumpol, kumpolan; dipat, mendipati; lempar, melemparkan. And the phenomenon here presents itself, that if the accent is not very easily distinguishable in the root word, it sometimes comes out clearer in the derived word, e.g., bergis, kabergisan.\"\n\nAfter quoting from van de Wall part of the passage which we have given above, Gerth v. Wijk adds: \"The tendency to change the position of the accent more or less is chiefly noticeable, as it seems to me, in words which have the a sound in the last syllable; such a pronunciation, however, as kudanya from kuda, pada-nya from pada, whereby the first syllable of the root entirely loses its accent, which falls wholly upon the second, as is the case with kata-nya,\u2020 can only be attributed to European-Javanese influence; one never hears it from the Malay.\"\n\nWe shall see later on that van Wijk is probably correct in attributing to Javanese influence this mistaken idea about the change of the accent to the penultimate in all derived words. It seems necessary, however, before going into that question, to inquire first of all which are the words in the Malay language that actually do undergo a change of accent. In order to make an independent investigation of this subject I have written out a list of derived words and have caused them to\n\n\"of a word does not change its position on the addition of the particles lah, kah and teh. From the spelling of Abdullah it would appear that this is also the case in the Malay of Malacca.\"\n\n\u2020 Where van de Wall and van Wijk came across this pronunciation of kata-nya I cannot imagine. The Malacca and Johor pronunciation certainly gives an accent identical with kuda-nya.\nbe read in my hearing by a number of Malays, with the result that I have only been able to detect an entire change of accent in the following classes of words:\n\n(A) In some words derived from roots ending in ang by the addition of the prefix an, as timbang, timbdngan; ldraag, larang; bilang, bldngan; dagang, dagangan; pandang, pemandangan.\n\n(B) In some derived words formed by the addition of the suffix i, as: buka, bukai; sertai; mula, mulai; turun, turuni; tdhan, tahani; kdsehan, menasehdni.*\n\n(C) In some polysyllabic derived words formed with the suffix i, the accent is carried forward to the suffix i on the addition of the possessive pronoun nya, as, jdlani, di-jalani-nya; mengobati, di-obati-nya-lah. This should probably be attributed to the difficulty of pronouncing the consonant nya following the vowel i, which necessitates a pause.\n\nIn the majority of words the root most distinctly retains the original accent, as for instance jidi, jidikan; makan, mdkanan; dggar, dggaran; obat, mengobati; salah, kesalahan; surat, di-surat-nya-lah. It would be ridiculous to pronounce these words, jadikan, mdkanan, kedepavan, mengobati, kesalahan.\n\nThere are, however, a large number of derived words, chiefly words of four or more syllables, in which the original accent almost or perhaps entirely disappears, without, however, any particular accentuation of any other syllable, the word being pronounced with an equal stress on all the syllables. Such words are: perkata'an, kekaya'an, menjalani.\n\nTaking the pronunciation of the above-mentioned words into consideration, it would be easy in the case of the words in (A) and (B) to account for the position of the strengthening letters, alif, wau and ya; and even in the case of the words given above where the stress is equal on all the syllables, one could understand the omission of the strengthening letter from its proper place in the root, though its transference to the penultimate would be difficult to explain; but when we come to such a spelling as,\n\n* It should be noted that in such roots as turun and tahani the stress is nearly equal on the two syllables, the change of stress in turuni, tahani is therefore very slight.\nit becomes simply impossible to account for it in any theory of phonetics, unless indeed one is prepared to admit the possibility of a complete change of pronunciation in the short space of 300 years, which appears to me to be out of the question.\n\nThere is, however, it seems to me, a much more feasible explanation of this peculiar discrepancy between the spelling and the pronunciation of these words, and that is to be found in the existence of a cognate language, the Javanese, in which it is admitted that the accent in derivatives actually does change its position and fall upon the penultimate. Moreover the probability that Javanese was the pattern from which this peculiar Malay spelling was copied becomes still stronger when it is pointed out that Javanese words of this kind are written in the Javanese character in a way which has quite a strong analogy to this peculiar use of the strengthening letters in the penultimate. As the Javanese characters are not obtainable in Singapore it has been necessary to revert to the arrangement given below, which represents as nearly as it is possible in Roman characters the way in which such words are spelt in the Javanese character.\nIt will be seen from the above that in Javanese the addition of the suffix \\(an\\), \\(a\\), \\(\u00ea\\) or \\(i\\) doubles the preceding letter. Thus, the addition of \\(\u00ea\\) to \\(anak\\) produces not \\(anak\u00ea\\), but \\(anakk\u00ea\\), the accent being shown in this way to be on the penultimate. When Javanese is written with Arabic characters, the weak letter \\(alif\\), \\(wa\\) or \\(ya\\) is substituted for one of the double letters used in the Javanese character.\n\nThe resemblance between these Javanese forms* and the spelling of Malay derivatives is so close that it amounts almost to a demonstration that the Javanese or some similar character was the medium through which the use of the strengthening letter in the penultimate came into Malay spelling, regardless of the pronunciation. The question has been raised before whether the Malays had a written character of their own, before they adopted the Arabic character. If that were so, analogy would naturally lead us to suppose that such a character would, like the Javanese, be based upon the Sanskrit, and that would make the step from the Javanese to the Malay spelling of derivatives which has been outlined above still easier. \u2020\n\n* These Javanese double-letter forms can still be traced in Malay in the double \\(k\\), which has no doubt survived owing to the existence of the two letters \\(ku\\) and \\(ku\\). Thus we find that the Malays invariably use this method of spelling the words given below:\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u06a9\u0627\u0628\u0646\u06a9 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0628\u06a9\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u06a9 \u06a9\u0627\u0628\u0633\u06a9\u0646}\n\\]\n\nalthough the Dutch scholars have endeavoured for more than a century to introduce what they consider more correct forms of spelling, namely:\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u06a9\u0627\u0628\u06a9 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0628\u06a9\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0627\u06a9\u06a9 \u06a9\u0627\u0628\u0633\u0648\u06a9\u0646}\n\\]\n\nThe fact that the Malays refuse to adopt these European spellings and retain the double-letter forms, is to my mind at once a strong argument in favour of their retention and an additional evidence in favour of the theory that the spelling of Malay derivatives can only be explained as being based upon the Javanese system of spelling.\n\n\u2020 Wernly, in the introduction to his grammar, written 170 years ago, says on page 50: \"The first language from which the Malay language has borrowed some words is her neighbouring and kindred friend and sister the Javanese language, with which many persons conjecture that she for-\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\nWe will now proceed to inquire:\n\nII. What changes have the Malays introduced in their spelling during the last 300 years with a view to greater legibility.\n\nIt has already been pointed out in I. (1) that it is now the almost invariable custom of the Malays to write final *wa* and *ya* in words which end in the vowels *e* and *i*, *o* and *u*, as well as in those which end in *ai* and *au*.

Thus:\n\nbimbang banting hintong kambing kumbang tanggong tuggang\n\n(d) If the vowel sound in one syllable corresponds to wau, and in the other to ya, then both should be written, as:\n\nIt will, of course, be understood that it is quite impossible in this way to represent all the possible permutations of vowel sounds that may be formed with the same consonants. This could only be done with vowel points. The great majority of words in ordinary use will however be covered by the above rules, and something must be left to the imagination of the reader.\n\n(e) In such common words as tinggal and paggil, it is doubtful whether the insertion of the ya would be of any use. The Malays are so accustomed to the spelling for these words that careless readers invariably pronounce these forms tinggal and paggil even when they stand for tunggal and peggal, and would certainly continue to do so even if tinggal and paggil were spelt and as most Malays strongly object to the insertion of the ya in these words, I would advocate\nits omission, for the present at any rate. Similarly a few other very common words might be spelt without the weak letters, as:\n\nmintu pinta piatu jumpa chinta habis patch timbul boleh olch\n\n\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0628\u0644 \u0641\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u0628\u0633 \u062c\u0646\u062a\u0627 \u062c\u0646\u0641\u0627 \u0641\u0646\u062a\u0648 \u0641\u0646\u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0627\n\nratus nutia himpon \u00e9rok lebeh\n\n\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0633\u0642 \u0647\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633\n\n(4) The alif should be used, as explained above, in all words where in the old MSS. a tashdid is found over wa, as in\n\nbuah buat dua jua prempan tuan bau\n\n\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0627 \u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u0627\u0647\n\nThis use of alif does not appear to be necessary where tashdid is found over ya in the old MSS., for the Malays never spell otherwise than\n\n\u0633\u0643\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u062b\u0642\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0646\n\n(5) (a) In root words, the use of the weak letters to lengthen the vowel sound in open syllables requires but few remarks. In words of two syllables, these lengthening letters are almost invariably found in the first syllable, the exceptions being those words in which the accent falls on the last syllable, the first syllable having the short vowel sound, as:\n\nbla kra sela tra\n\n\u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0633\u0644\u0627 \u0643\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0644\u0627\n\nIn three-syllable roots, the lengthening letter is placed in the penultimate; but in one or two words which have final alif the lengthening letter is omitted from the penultimate, as\n\n\u064a\u0627 \u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0633\u0647\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0648\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0647\u064a\u0627 \u0643\u062b\u0644\u0627\n\n(b) In derived words the aim should undoubtedly be to bring the spelling into agreement with the pronunciation as far as possible without making an entire revolution in the present\nsystem of spelling. As a general rule, the spelling of the root should remain the same as it was before the addition of the prefixes and suffixes. No change of spelling is necessary when the vowel sound of the last syllable of the root is e, i, o, or u. This will be made plain by the following three sets of examples:\n\nb1. The final syllable open:\n\nganti gantikan gantian laku laku-nya lakukan\n\n\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064f\u0648\u06a9\u0650\u0646 \u0644\u064e\u0627\u06a9\u064f\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u064e\u0627\u06a9\u064f\u0648 \u06a9\u064e\u0646\u062a\u0650\u06a9\u0650\u0646 \u06a9\u064e\u0646\u062a\u0650\u06a9\u06cc\n\nb2. Final syllable closed and containing a weak letter:\n\nkasih kasih-nya kasahi unjok unjokkan unjoki*\n\n\u0627\u0650\u0646\u062c\u0648\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0650\u0646\u062c\u0648\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u0650\u0646\u062c\u0648\u06a9 \u0627\u0650\u0646\u062c\u0648\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u0647\n\nb3. Final syllable closed but without a weak letter:\n\nfikir fikirkan fikiran bunoh bunohkan pembunohan\n\n\u0641\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u06a9\u0646 \u0641\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u06a9\u0646 \u0641\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u06a9\u0646 \u0641\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u06a9\u0646 \u0641\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u06a9\u0646 \u0641\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u06a9\u0646\n\n(c) If the last syllable of the root has the open a sound, the alif must always be written when a suffix is added, even if the root does not require final alif, as,\n\nada ada-kah rasa rasa-nya raja rajakan\n\n\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0627\u06a9\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u062f\n\n(d) If the last syllable of the root is closed and has the a sound, the addition of a suffix commencing with a consonant produces no change in the spelling of the root, as,\n\ndapat dapatkan susah susahkan susah-nya\n\n\u0633\u0648\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0648\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0648\u0633\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0646\u06a9\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0641\u0647\n\nbut if the suffix commence with a vowel sound, the alif is usually written in the last syllable of the root:\n\n* Unjoki may also be spelt \u0627\u0650\u0646\u062c\u0648\u06a9\u06cc. See page 102, footnote.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\ndapat dapati kras mengrasai senang kesenangan susah kesukahan\n\n(\u03b5) When both syllables of the root have the *a* sound, and the addition of a suffix requires in the last syllable an extra *alif*, the Malays invariably omit the *alif* of the first syllable of the root, unless it follows one of the letters \u0648 or \u062f\u0631; thus,\n\nbucha bachakan di-bucha-nya bapa bapa-nya kata katakan\n\nperkataan karang karangan makan makanan nama namakan\n\nnama'i salah kesalahan tanam tanaman\n\nBut with words commencing with \u0648 or \u062f\u0631 the spelling is,\n\ndula-nya dagangan dalam-nya perdagangan rasa-nya wayangan\n\nWith roots in which *ya* is a consonant, the omission of *alif* would cause ambiguity; it should therefore be retained, as.\n\n(\u03b7) The suffix *an* requires *alif* when the root ends with the letters \u0648 or \u062f\u0631\n\nfikiran kedudukan kelakuan petulatoran\n\nIn such words, the *alif* which would otherwise be required by rule (5) (d) in the last syllable of the root must be omitted, as.\n(g) The further addition of suffixes or particles to derived words should cause no change in spelling. Some persons write *alif* after the possessive pronoun *nya* when it is followed by the particles *lah*, *kah*, etc., but this appears to be unnecessary. Examples:\n\n*bapa-nya bapa-nya-kah kaschi di-kaschi-nya-lah*\n\n*\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0652\u0647\u0650\u064a \u062f\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0652\u0647\u0650\u064a \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650*\n\n*nama'i ac-nama'i-nya-lah*\n\n*\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652 \u0646\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650*\n\n(6) The orthographical sign *hamza* *, which was very seldom written in the manuscripts of the 17th century, is now in common use among the Malays, chiefly for the purpose of introducing a syllable which commences with a vowel; they never employ it however for this purpose at the beginning of a word. The *hamza* is placed over *alif*, *wa* or *ya* according to the vowel sound of the syllable in which it is used.\n\n(a) Root words commencing with the vowels corresponding to *wa* and *ya* are written with an initial *alif*, but this *alif* drops out on the addition of the prefix *sa*, its place being taken by the *hamza*; with the prefix *ke* the *alif* is retained and *hamza* written over it.\n\n*sa'orang sa'oluh-olah sa'isi sa'ekor sa'umpana ke'inginan*\n\n*\u0633\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u062c \u0633\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u064e\u062d \u0633\u064e\u0623\u0652\u064a\u0650\u0633\u0650\u064a \u0633\u064e\u0623\u0652\u064a\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0631 \u0633\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0625\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e*\n\nIn the following words the *alif* is the lengthening letter of the preceding syllable,\n\n*ia'itu kail ra'eh da'irah*\n\n*\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u062a\u064f\u0648 \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644 \u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u062f\u064e\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0650*\n\n(b) In similar derivatives formed from words commencing with the *a* sound, the *alif* is retained and the *hamza* written over it, as,\n\n*ke'ada'an ke'ampat ka'atus sa'akan-akan*\n\n*\u0643\u064e\u0625\u0650\u062f\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0645\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064e \u0633\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e*\nHamza is used in the same way with the suffix an following an alif, as,\n\nkenyata'an perkata'an\n\n(c) Hamza is also used with the suffix i when it follows an alif, but not when it follows wau, as,\n\nmula'i nam'i serta'i bharui ketahui lalui tugguni\n\n(d) Hamza is sometimes placed at the end of a word instead of final q to indicate a shortening of the final syllable, as\n\nbengko' dato' inche' ma' pok'o' teggo'\n\n(e) It also appears in a few Arabic words:\n\nmalaiikat ajaiib nu'min\n\nIV. For the sake of brevity and clearness the proposed rules for Malay spelling are now recapitulated, without the explanations which were necessary above.\n\nPROPOSED RULES FOR MALAY SPELLING.\n\n(1) Final wau and ya must be used in all words ending in the sounds u, o, au, and i, e, ai, respectively, except\n\n(2) Final alif must be used in all words ending in the a sound, except (a) when the final consonant is preceded by alif, or (c) one of the following exceptions:\n(3) (a) In two-syllable roots having one syllable open and the other closed, the weak letters \\( wau \\) and \\( ya \\) are to be inserted in the closed syllable having the \\( e \\), \\( i \\), or \\( o \\), \\( u \\) sound respectively, except when the sounds of the two syllables are of the same class (\\( o \\) and \\( u \\), \\( o \\) and \\( u \\); or \\( i \\) and \\( e \\), \\( e \\) and \\( i \\)). (b) When both syllables are closed and have similar sounds, the weak letter must only be used in the second syllable; but (c) if the sounds are dissimilar, one being the \\( a \\) sound and the other \\( wau \\) or \\( ya \\), the \\( wau \\) or \\( ya \\) must be written in whichever syllable it occurs; and (d) if the sound in one syllable is \\( wau \\) and the other \\( ya \\), both must be written. (e) The following common words are exceptions to this rule, being written without the weak letters.\n\nThree-syllable roots must be treated similarly.\n\n(4) Where a syllable commencing with the \\( a \\) sound follows a syllable ending in the letter \\( \u062f \\) or \\( \u0631 \\), the \\( alif \\) must always be written. Examples:\n\n(5) (a) In root words, lengthening letters are used in those open syllables on which the accent falls. Several words of Arabic origin, however, are exceptions to this rule, and a few other words, such as,\n\n(b) In derived words, when the vowel sound of the last syllable of the root is \\( e \\), \\( i \\), \\( o \\) or \\( u \\), the spelling of the root remains unchanged. (c) If the root ends with the open \\( a \\) sound, an \\( alif \\) must be written in the last syllable of the root when a suffix is added. (d) If the last syllable of the root is closed and has the \\( a \\) sound, an \\( alif \\) is usually written in the last syllable of the root on the addition of a suffix commencing with a vowel sound, but if the suffix commence with a consonant the \\( alif \\) is not required, and the spelling of the root remains unchanged.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\n(e) When both syllables of the root have the \\(a\\) sound, and the addition of a suffix requires an extra alif in the last syllable, then if there is an alif in the first syllable of the root it should be omitted, unless it follows one of the letters \\(\\text{\u0648}\\), \\(\\text{\u062f}\\), or \\(\\text{\u064a}\\).\n\n(f) When the root ends with one of the letters \\(\\text{\u0648}\\), \\(\\text{\u062f}\\), an alif must be written before the suffix \\(an\\), the alif required by rule (5d) is then omitted. (g) The further addition of suffixes or particles to derived words causes no change in the spelling.\n\n(6) (a) When sa is prefixed to a root commencing with a vowel sound corresponding to \\(wau\\) or \\(ya\\), the alif drops out, and hamza takes its place; with the prefix ke the alif is retained and hamza is written over it. (b) When the root commences with the \\(a\\) sound, the alif is retained and the hamza written over it. Hamza is also employed in the same way with the suffix \\(an\\) following an alif. (c) It is used with the suffix \\(i\\) following an alif, but not when it follows \\(wau\\). (d) At the end of a word, hamza sometimes takes the place of final \\(\\text{\u0642}\\). (e) It also appears in a few Arabic words.\n\nIn order to show the application of the principles of Malay spelling reform suggested in this paper, the first chapter of Hikayat Abdullah, spelt according to the above rules, is here appended, with a few notes on words which are spelt in an unusual way. A glossary of the words used in this paper as examples is also appended. The root words are arranged in the order of the Malay alphabet, and, wherever necessary, the spelling of one or more derivatives is given after the root. In order to make this list more complete, several words have been inserted in the glossary which will not be found among the examples; these include a number of words in the spelling of which the Malays are very inconsistent, so that it seemed desirable to suggest a fixed standard of spelling in such cases.\n\nIt will be seen that this method of spelling is essentially the same as is at present in use among educated Malays throughout the Malay Peninsula, which is admitted, even by the Dutch scholars, to be the home of the purest form of the Malay language.\nIn this paper but little more has been done than to explain the rationale of this modern Malay spelling, and to reduce it to a system which would enable those who are prepared to adopt it to spell uniformly and consistently with themselves. It has been sought to adhere as closely as possible to the spelling employed by the best educated Malays at the present time in writing their own language, in the firm belief that it is very much more feasible for the few Europeans who use the Malay character to accommodate themselves to the native way of spelling, than for them to attempt to coerce a whole nation of intelligent and self-reliant men into a return to the antiquated Arabian system of orthography illustrated in the manuscripts of the 17th century, which the Malays have been doing their best to improve for hundreds of years past.\n\nAPPENDIX A.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF MALAY SPELLING.\n\n1. The spelling of this word *jucatan* is somewhat ambiguous, and the word is sometimes pronounced *jutan* by ignorant persons, but this spelling agrees with Rule (5) (e).\n\n2. Many Malays spell the affirmative monosyllable *ya* in the same way as the two-syllable pronoun *ia*. But this spelling seems better.\n\n3. To distinguish *buloh* from *boloh*, it is better to insert the *wa* in the last syllable of this word, through contrary to Rule (3) (e).\n\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641

S. Miller, in Perak.\n\nIn the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, vol. xiii, April 21, 1900, Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, of the U. S. National Museum, describes no less than seven new species of Rats collected in 1899 by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the mountains of Trong, a small Siamese State on the west side of the Peninsula, about 500 miles north of Singapore.\n\nThis paper should not be overlooked by students of the smaller Malayan mammals, and Mr. Miller would probably kindly supply any one interested in the subject with a copy on application. The new rats described are *Mus vociferans*, *M. ferrocanus*, *M. validus*, *M. cremoriventer*, *M. asper*, *M. pellae*, and *M. surifer*. I am able to record the last of these new species from the Larut Hills, Perak, and it is probable that at least some of the others follow the main range down the Peninsula. *Mus surifer* was obtained by Dr. Abbott in February 1899. I first met with it in February 1898, catching a single example in a steel trap near the Hut, Maxwell's Hill. Unfortunately the hinder portion of the specimen had been eaten by some small carnivorous creature, and, after noting its appearance I threw it away. Last year on revisiting the hills I remembered this rat and succeeded in trapping a specimen alive. It was a charmingly pretty and fearless little creature, quite tame from the time of capture, and I was overruled by feminine influence into keeping it alive, with the result that it escaped eventually in Kwala Lumpur! At the same time I got a very damaged specimen from same coolies, and sent it in spirit to Mr. Oldfield Thomas, who identified it as the newly described *M. surifer*.\n\nMr. Miller's paper above referred to is a good example of the exceedingly thorough and careful work of the new school of American mammalogists.\n\nA. L. Butler, F. Z. S.\nKhartoum, Soudan.\n\n4th July, 1901\nRambong Beetle.\n\nFrom two localities in Selangor specimens of a common longicorn beetle *Butocera octomaculata* and its grub have been sent, as serious pests destroying the India-rubber tree, Rambong, *Ficus elastica*. The grub over two inches long bores up the stem of the tree, while the beetle itself gnaws the bark, bites off the buds and then proceeds to demolish the leaves, eating them quite voraciously. The grub is when full grown about two inches and a half long and a quarter of an inch wide, flattened soft and white except for its hard brown chitinous head and the upper surface of the first two segments. Like all longicorn grubs it has no feet. It makes the usual tunnels elliptic in section through the length of the larger boughs and trunk of the tree, and also attacks in the same way *Ficus indica* and the Waringin, *F. Benjaminia*, and probably others of our wild figs. It pupates in the tube it has made, and eventually hatches out into a handsome large beetle, one and a half to two inches long, without the antennae. The head is brown, with large eyes and powerful jaws. The antennae, fairly stout, longer than the body, dark brown, and rough with short processes in the lower surface. The thorax, short and broad with a conic thorn on each side, is dark brown with two red crescents in the centre. The elytra three quarters to an inch and a quarter long, oblong, blunt, broadest at the shoulder, dark brown with black shining raised dots in the upper part near the shoulder, smooth below. There are four pair of white spots on the elytra, the uppermost pair small and round, the next larger and more or less oblong sometimes with an extra white spot near the upper edge, the next pair nearly as large, the lowest pair much smaller. The form and size of the spots vary, but appear to be always eight. The scutellum is also white. The under surface of the body is light brown and a broad white stripe runs on each side, from behind the eye to the tail. The legs are powerful, over an inch long, and brown. The beetle feeds during the day, and also moves about at night. It is attracted by light and often flies into the house after dark. Like most longicorn beetles it squeaks loudly when caught and it can also bite severely. The amount of injury a beetle of this kind could\ndo in a plantation of large sized trees would be very great. Fortunately it is easily caught and very conspicuous, and by abolishing all unnecessary fig trees from the neighbourhood of a plantation and carefully attending to the young plants, the pest out to be easily kept in check.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nALLAN MACLEAN SKINNER, C. M. G.\n\nThe death of Mr. Skinner will be deeply regretted by all who knew him, and as one of the original members of the Society it is fitting that some special notice of the loss the Society has sustained by his death should appear in the Journal. At the preliminary meeting held on 4th November 1877, it was Mr. Skinner who proposed that the gentlemen present should form themselves into a Society to promote the collection and record of information relating to the Straits Settlements and neighbouring countries. Of those present at the first meeting the majority have died and the Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak, the first President, is the only one still resident in the East.\n\nAt a meeting held in February 1878, was exhibited a skeleton map of the Malay Peninsula showing how little was then known of the Native States. Under the personal direction of Mr. Skinner the blank spaces were partially filled in and the first map of the Peninsula was published by the Society.\n\nIn the first number of the Journal is a valuable paper by Mr. Skinner on the Geography of the Peninsula, with maps.\n\nIn 1883 Mr. Skinner was Vice President and in the Journal published in December 1882, appeared his 'Outline History of the British Connection with Malaya,' a most useful compilation which is reproduced in the Singapore and Straits Directory.\n\nAmong his other contributions may be mentioned papers on 'The Java System' and 'Straits Meteorology'. In 1885 Mr. Skinner was elected President. He received the cordial thanks\nof the Government for the valuable results of the action of the Society with regard to the publication of 'Eastern Geography,' which he edited.\n\nIn 1888 he was again elected President, but from the time of his transfer to Penang in the following year as Resident Councillor, he ceased to take an active part in the work of the Society. Since his retirement in 1897 Mr. Skinner was engaged in writing a History of the Straits Settlements.\n\nC. W. S.

HELIER,\nHonorary Treasurer, Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society.\nKelantan and my trip to Gunong Tahan.\n\nBy Mr. John Waterstradt.\n\nGunong Tahan, the supposed highest mountain in the Malay Peninsula had always a great attraction for me, ever since I had ascended the Kina Balu mountain in Borneo, situated in about the same latitude, as I wanted to compare the fauna of the former with that of the latter. However it was not until ten years after my first ascent of Kina Balu, that I found an opportunity of undertaking the journey to Gunong Tahan. My plans for the trip had been laid long beforehand, and I had decided to take the Kelantan route in preference to that of Pahang, as several expeditions which had tried to reach the mountain by the latter route had failed, mostly I believe owing to the difficulty of obtaining food supplies. I decided to abandon everything in the shape of comforts for this trip, taking with me only things that were absolutely necessary, and utilising all the coolies I could get for carrying provisions. Leaving Singapore towards the end of April in a small coasting steamer, I arrived in Kelantan four days later, the steamer calling at most of the ports along the coast, on the way up. The mouth of the Kelantan river is on the map given as farther south than it really is, but that entrance has long ago sanded up, and ships have now to enter by the northern entrance. Lately a fairly good light house has been erected by the Siamese, and a Siamese gunboat is always stationed there. Owing to the shallowness of the river all steamers are obliged to anchor just inside the bar, behind a sand spit that affords good shelter; and passengers and cargo are taken up to Kota Bahru in small native boats.\n\nKota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, is situated about eight miles from the mouth of the river, on the right bank of the same, and contains according to the Rajah's account, about 20,000 inhabitants. The town consists really of two villages:\none of them called Taratchin, is divided from the other by a branch of the river, and is chiefly inhabited by Chinese. Formerly nearly all the business was done in this place, but the ever changing river silted up just there, and now nearly all business is transacted in the native town, a little farther up river, where there is deep water close into the bank. The Rajah at the instigation of the Siamese is now making fairly good roads in every direction through the town. Just before I arrived, there had been a tremendous fire in the Chinese village, half of which was burned down one night, when most of the inhabitants were attending a f\u00eate given by the Rajah on account of his marriage with the Rajah of Singora's daughter; and a number of young children who were left alone in the houses were burnt to death. The Rajah used this opportunity to make a broad street right through the whole village, where there formerly had been only narrow crooked paths. During my stay in Kota Bahru, before going up stream, I was the guest of the Siamese Commissioner and was introduced by him to the Rajah, who immediately offered to provide me with boats and men for the trip up the river. The present Rajah is a young man of about thirty-five years, and owes his position to the Siamese, who on the death of the old Rajah installed him as such, in preference to the rightful heir, on the supposition that he would conform to their wishes. So far the Siamese have interfered very little in the internal affairs of Kelantan, keeping only a Commissioner there, who acts as a sort of adviser to the Rajah, and a small garrison; but signs are not wanting that they want to get a more direct control of affairs, and probably before very long Kelantan will be to all purposes, except in name, a Siamese province. The Rajah's palace is just in the middle of the town, and every forenoon from about 10 to 1 o'clock he holds his court there, afterwards going for a drive out to his villa, that he has built in a garden outside the town. I visited him there one afternoon, and found workmen everywhere building cages for wild animals, and the Rajah told me he intended to start a small Zoological Garden there.\n\nIt was the dry season when I arrived in Kota Bahru and the heat was very intense, the thermometer seldom going below 100\u00b0 in the daytime and 90\u00b0 at night. The Kelantan river,\nwhich in the rainy season often overflows its banks, was now nearly dried up, so we had great difficulty in getting up stream with the three large house boats that the Rajah supplied for me and my men. The river is about 250 yards wide at Kota Bahru, and continues to be about the same width up to Sungai Lebeh, which river falls into the Kelantan river from the right, thirty to forty miles up stream. The banks of the river up to Kuala Lebeh are pretty thickly populated, and are lined with coconut groves most of the way. It took us four days to reach Kuala Lebeh, as we had only one gang of men to pole the boats, and consequently had to stop at night. I decided to try first to get to Gunung Tahan by the Lebeh river, as that, according to my idea, was the nearest way, and we therefore proceeded up that river for another day, when the rapids were reached, and we had to stop, as it was impossible to get our heavy boats over them.\n\nOn the way up the river we had passed a number of bamboo rafts, with small huts built on them, either moored along the banks, or drifting slowly down stream. They were inhabited by Malays from Kota Bahru, who go up stream to trade or to plant paddy, and prefer living on the river rather than ashore. When therefore a suitable place is found, these people make a raft and build a hut thereon, wherein they live until they have traded away or exchanged all their goods for jungle produce, whereon they drift down stream with their barter or their paddy.\n\nJust below the rapids a number of these rafts were moored, forming a floating village on the river; and as I had to wait there some days before I could get smaller boats to take me up river one of these huts was given up to me, and I discharged the three large boats and sent them back to Kota Bahru, as they were of no further use to me. I had to wait a week at this place before I got smaller boats and other men, to take me further up river, and in the meantime, I and my collectors that I had brought with me from Borneo, did a little collecting; but the species found there were of little interest being the same as are found everywhere in the low land of the Peninsula. At last we got away again in three smaller boats, all heavily loaded; and for the next few days we had a very rough\njob pulling the boats over the rapids, of which the river was full. We had to stop at each village we passed on the way, to get fresh boatmen, as none of these would go any farther with me than to the next village, and this continual stopping and changing men delayed us a good deal. On the third day Kuala Aring was reached; and as it was my intention to go up that river, we had again to wait to procure still smaller boats, but we soon managed to get six of these and plenty of men, so we were able to proceed the next day. It was at Kuala Aring that the Skeat expedition stopped, while Mr. Skeat went across to Pahang and tried to get up the Tahan from that side, but failed, I believe owing to want of provisions, the same as Messrs. Ridley and Davidson before him. The river Aring is of course much smaller than the Lebeh, and is full of rapids, but it was not very difficult to get the boats over them. I counted them several times, and found that on an average we passed over about ten of them an hour the whole way up. There are very few people living on this river, there being only one village of any size, about three days up stream, so I had not to stop on the way to change men, as those from the Kuala took me right up to that village. The village is called Buntie, and is the last inhabited place in Kelantan, so I had to halt there to get together coolies and to find out the best way of ascending the mountain, of which I got a good view away to the southward on clear days. The natives there called it Gunong Siam. There is plenty of game to be had round the village, as there are lots of old clearings, where deer and pigs are plentiful, and tigers are also found in numbers. On the very first day I stayed there, while out collecting butterflies close to the house, I heard a noise in the thick low jungle close by, resembling the purring of a cat, only louder, but took no notice of this until a couple of Malays came running after me telling me to come back at once, as there was a tiger quite close by. As I had then about forty Malays with me I wanted them to go into the jungle and drive the tiger out into the open, a distance of not more than twenty or thirty yards, where I could get a shot at him; but though they were all armed with spears and I offered them some of my guns also, they were afraid of doing so, and I did not get a sight of the brute though he stayed in that\nthicket not 150 yards from the house the whole day. On my return from the mountain however I got him, as he had just then killed a buffalo, and came back in the afternoon to have another meal.\n\nAbout a day's journey to the westward of the village at another tributary to the Lebeh river, called Sungei Aring, was situated a small encampment of Sakais and as I wanted these men to show me the way to the mountain, I got the headman of the village to send word to them to join me at once. The whole tribe of Sakais living there are considered to be the property of a Malay living half way up the Aring; and this man brought all the full grown men to me a couple of days later. There is only this one settlement of Sakais in this part of the country, whereas there are said to be thousands of them living up the Ulu Kelantan river. Those that I had with me (ten or eleven men), were all remarkably strong and healthy looking, and were not so much troubled by skin diseases as is usually the case with the Sakais. After getting all the information I could about the Gunong Tahan or Gunong Siam, I decided to follow the Aring as far as it was possible to go with the native boats, and then strike across country straight for it. We therefore loaded the provisions in eight or nine small dug-outs, and went up stream with these, most of the coolies following us along the bank. After going on in this way for a couple of days I found it impossible to get any farther with the boats, as the river was getting too small, and the boats had continually to be hauled over trees that had fallen across the river and barred the passage. We therefore stopped at a small tributary called Sungei Tamu, and while my Malays made everything ready for the march inland, I sent the Sakais in the jungle to cut a path for us along the bank of the Tamu, which I had decided to follow seeing that it seemed to come from the direction that I wanted to take. The Sakais came back in the evening of the same day and reported having found an elephant track, which they had followed up a high ridge, and they were of the opinion that by following this track we should reach the foot of the mountain. They had come up with the elephants about half way up the mountain, there being seven of them, but as there were no tuskers amongst them, they had not fired on them, and the elephants continued\ntheir journey to the top of the ridge and then disappeared down the other side. We halted two days while the different packages were divided amongst the coolies. The rest of the provisions which we could not take with us were hoisted up in a high tree, for fear of the elephants getting at them, and well covered with mats to protect them against rain, and then we started. In the beginning we got on very well, the ground rising gently the whole time, but as we got higher up on the spur, walking became more difficult, and we had to catch hold of roots and branches to help us in getting up, and had it not been for the deep footprints made in the soil by the elephants it would have been nearly impossible for the coolies to get up with their heavy burdens. I reached the top of the ridge, which proved to be about 3500' high, about noon, together with a few of my Borneo men and a couple of Sakais, and wanted to proceed along the comb of the ridge, which was running in the direction I wanted to take, but the Sakais insisted on our going down the slope on the other side, as they said we should find no water near the top; so I had to give in, and we went down about 1000' till we came to a tiny stream, where I decided to camp for the night. I had not taken any tent with me, but my men soon made a shelter with some large palm leaves, some three feet broad and seven feet long, which we found growing in abundance in altitudes from 500' up to 4500'. None of the other coolies reached our camp that night, and next morning we went farther down the slope till we reached a stream, which the Sakais declared to be the Sungai Tahan, and waited there until all the coolies had arrived. From the river bed we got a fine view of a mountain, that I judged to be about 5000' high, standing straight up and looking very formidable and inaccessible with a magnificent waterfall near the top. The natives declared that this mountain, which was not more than 2 miles distant, was part of Gunong Tahan, the higher part of which was shut out from sight by the high ridges running parallel with the river. We followed up the river for some time, but it was very difficult climbing and when we had reached an altitude of 2500' the coolies declared that they would not go any farther, so I had to make my camp there. Most of the coolies then returned to their villages; but I kept the Sakais and my collectors with\nme, and with these I ascended to the top of the mountain that we had seen from the river. The ascent was however so difficult, that it was impossible to carry anything with us, and we had therefore to return to our old camp every night. Especially the last 500' proved to be very difficult to negotiate, as there was a sheer wall of rock about 300' in height, down which the Tahan river came thundering, forming the splendid waterfall that we had seen from the bottom, and which I christened the Lama Falls. After several failures we at last found a way to the top of the falls and were then confronted by two peaks, nearly inaccessible, and the river seemed to wind its way in between them. We tried to follow up the river, but soon had to stop, on account of huge boulders and deep pools, with sheer walls on each side, making it impossible for us to get through; so we had to give it up, and attempted instead to scale the least forbidding looking of the two peaks.\n\nIn this we succeeded at last, only to find however the top involved in thick mist, so that it was impossible to see anything and to ascertain whether we were really on a spur of the Tahan range or not. As it was impossible to stay up there for the night without any food or shelter, we had to return to our camp, my intention being to get up there again early the next day and have a good look at the surrounding country before the clouds commenced to gather round the mountain tops, as they always do in the afternoon. In the night however I got an attack of fever and was unable to walk for some days, so I sent my men up to try and find out the whereabouts of Gunong Tahan, and they returned with the information that the mountain that we were on was in no way connected with the Tahan, which they said they had seen a long way to the westward, but according to them it would be impossible to get up that mountain from that side, as we were separated from it by a deep chasm, which ran along for many miles, with sheer walls of rock on the other side, up which they declared it impossible for anybody to get. The Sakais stated that they had seen another river coming nearly from the top of the mountain, and this they took to be a branch of the Gahas river, another tributary of the Kelantan river; and they strongly advised me to go back, and try to get up the mountain by that route. As they absolutely refused to\nfollow me when I wanted to try and get up from where we were, I had to give it up, though I myself believed it to be possible; and, as after events showed me, it proved to have been the easiest and nearest route to the top. However, I made up my mind to return to Kota Bahru and get up another expedition up the Galas river; so I returned to the village Bantie with a few of the Sakans, leaving the rest of them together with my Malays and all our provisions on the mountain; as we had found a number of rare birds there, and I was desirous of getting some more of them. I told my men that they must try and find an easier way to Tahan, and if they succeeded in this they were to wait for me near the top of the mountain. I may as well mention here that some time after I left, my men did find a way up Gunong Tahan, and stayed there for some time waiting for me; but I never met them, as it took me a much longer time to get up the mountain by the Galas route than I expected, and so at last they returned down towards the coast by the same way as they got there. The trip back to Kota Bahru occupied ten days, and I had to wait there another month before I got new provisions and material up from Singapore for my next expedition. When these at last arrived a new start was made but this time I got rather a poor lot of boatmen, the Rajah having lent most of his best men to Messrs. Duff and Lathven who went up stream just before me to prospect for gold. It therefore took me six days to get up to Kuala Lebeh, and there I found the above gentlemen busy prospecting the river bed, having with them a great number of coolies. This time I went past Kuala Lebeh, following the true Kelantan river, and in four days reached Kuala Galas, where we were detained a short time, owing to the river being in flood. We passed several small tributaries on the way, most of them being uninhabited, being the Rajah's rattan preserves. Once in five to six years he farms each of these rivers out to some of the Chinese traders in Kota Bahru, who then collect all the rattans and other jungle produce, and after that nobody is allowed to touch anything for the next five to six years, thus giving the rattans a chance of growing to a fair size before they are again cut down. We then proceeded up the Galas, which a short distance from its Kuala is only about 50 yards wide, and gets narrower farther up, and full of rapids. There\nare a number of small villages on its banks, from which I obtained relays of boatmen, those I had with me from Kota Bahru having by this time all got fever, or were at least pretending to have. As we got farther up, the river got very shallow, and I had to leave the big boats behind, and go on in small dug-outs. We passed a few Chinamen on the way, washing gold, and they told me they could make about 75 cents a day, when working hard. At other places where the Chinamen were working farther inland, they had dammed up the river to obtain sufficient water, causing us a lot of trouble, as we had to unload the boats before we could haul them over these obstacles.\n\nAt last the village of Pulai was reached, and there I had to stop, as it was impossible to proceed any farther by boat. The village contains a couple of hundred inhabitants, nearly all Chinese, there being only a few Malay traders there, who occasionally come up from Kota Bahru and stay there a month or two, until they have bartered all their goods away for gold. Formerly all the Chinese living there were gold miners, but now that all the gold-bearing sand in the river bed has been washed over and over again and the returns are getting less, many of them have settled down as agriculturists and have large paddy fields all round the village. Formerly there must have been a much larger Chinese population in these parts, as traces of very large alluvial workings are found up nearly all the small creeks, being now overgrown and covered with dense jungle. At present there are only a couple of Chinese Kongsis working on anything like a large scale, and I believe they are doing fairly well. Lode working has also been tried by the Malays, but though the ore obtained was of very good quality they soon gave it up, the work proving too hard for them. The formation of the country about there is mostly hard blue limestone which crops through everywhere, the hills in some places rising to a considerable height, mostly impossible to ascend owing to their steep or overhanging walls. All these limestone hills are full of caves and passages made by the water in bygone days, and in places some very curious dripstones* are formed, the best specimen of which is found in a cave close to the village, about\n\n*stalagmites?\n100' up in a hill, and the Chinese, on account of this bearing some resemblance to one of their deities, formerly used it as a temple, and there is still an old rotten table up there with some candlesticks full of burned joss sticks, and remains of half-burned paper. It has however not been used for a long time, and the ladders that led up to it have long since rotted away, so I had to climb the face of the rock to get up; but I should not recommend anybody to try that experiment, unless he is a good climber. My men that were with me looked at it, and decided that it was safer to stop at the bottom; so I let them remain there, while I went up with a young Malay who had been up there once before. The Chinese are rather afraid to go near these limestone hills as they say that the tigers use the caves as sleeping apartments, and this is very likely, though I never found traces of them in any of the many caves that I visited, whereas I found plenty of traces of elephants in the larger caves that were level with the ground, and the Malays told me that these animals often made them their homes for months at a time. The floors of the caves were often strewn with the remains of dead and broken snail-shells, which had fallen down from the roof in the dry season, when most of the snails die. However I also found a number of live shells hidden away in the dark and moist crevices of the rock, among them several new and rare species. Most of the snails have a great liking for limestone rocks, and the collector will find more specimens in one hour on these rocks than in the jungle for one month.\n\nFrom the top of some of these cliffs I got a good view of the surrounding country, but I looked in vain for a mountain that looked anything like 10,000' high. Towards the East were two mountain ranges which I supposed to be about 6,000' high, the natives calling the most northern Gunong Siam, and the other Talang Rabong. Gunong Siam appeared to be slightly higher than the other, and the Malays stated that this was the same mountain that the Malays of Pahang called Gunong Tahan. I did not believe this possible, but seeing that the people on the Aring river also called Tahan the Gunong Siam, I decided to ascend the mountain to make sure of it. I had great difficulty in obtaining any coolies to go with me owing to the rivalry\nbetween two of the native chiefs, and had at last to be contented with eight Pahang Malays; so we were only able to carry provisions with us for ten days. The first part of the road lay through fairly flat country and we had no difficulty in cutting a path through,\u2014going northeast by the compass, for none of the Malays had been in that part of the country before. At night we camped on the banks of a fairly large river, which proved to be the Katoh, a tributary of the Galas; and next day we followed this up till we got into the hills, passing an old deserted mining camp on the way. We only had one glimpse of the mountain on our journey, though we climbed several hills to obtain a good view, but always found other hills in front of us obstructing the view towards the mountain. That night we also camped on the banks of the river, which here reaches an altitude of 800' above sea level, the men making a rude shelter of palm leaves, under which we slept undisturbed, though we that day had come across several tracks of tigers. Next day we started up a ridge which we thought sprung from the mountain, but when we at last reached the top of it 2500' up, it proved to be separated from the mountain by another branch of the Katoh river, and so we had to climb down again on the other side. The descent proved to be very difficult, especially the last 300' to 400', and I have no idea how the coolies came down, as each man chose his own way over the face of the cliffs, where overhanging boughs and roots afforded the only support for lowering oneself. All got down without any mishap, and we all collected together in the river bed, which was only about 20' wide, and commenced to look for a way out of the canon or gully that we had got into, and this we found to be no easy task. It was impossible to get up on the other side of the stream, the walls of rock there being even more forbidding looking than those we had descended; and to get up by following the stream was equally impossible as there was a waterfall about 100' in height in front of us, from which the water came rushing down with a deafening noise. There was therefore no alternative left us but to go down stream; and this we did for a short distance, scrambling over huge boulders, wading through deep pools of water, and clinging to narrow ledges of rock where the pools were too deep to wade through; but at last we\ngot to a place where it was impossible to pass through, the bed of the stream being only about four feet wide, and through this narrow passage the water came rushing down over boulders and falls, making it impossible for any living thing to get through. Luckily we found a place where the rocks were less precipitous and we managed to get up these, following the direction of the river till we at last got on more even ground; and as we were by this time all thoroughly done up, we decided to camp on a small level piece of ground, that was situated just where another small mountain stream joined the one we had been following. There was no doubt that this stream came right up from the mountain; so next day we followed it until we reached a ridge. This we commenced to ascend, finding it rather difficult at first to cut a path through the jungle, but when we got farther up we found a fairly good track, evidently made by wild beasts, and the ascent was rather easy after that for the next 2000 feet. We passed a number of the argus pheasants' sporting places, on the way up, and heard their shrill cries all round, but never saw any, though I often tried to get near them and have a shot; but they were very shy and cleared away before I could see them. As we got higher and higher up, the path was evidently less used by animals, and got overgrown, until it was completely lost; and we then had to cut our way through low but very dense and thorny jungle, full of a kind of thin rattans, the leaves of which with their hundreds of bent thorns proved a great hindrance to our progress, as they caught hold of our clothes everywhere, and as soon as we had got loose from one of the leaves, we were hooked on to by half a dozen others. About two o'clock in the afternoon we came out on a small plateau at a height of about 4000', and from there we had a good look at the top of the mountain which was not very far off; but as at the rate that we were travelling, it would not be possible to reach it that day, we left the plateau, and followed the slope of the ridge until we reached a dried-up water course; and finding a little water in a hollow, we decided to camp there. There were no large palm leaves to be found therewith, and so darkness and rain came upon us before we had finished our shelter, and we passed a miserable night, wet and shivering with cold, as the rain had put our fires out. Next morning we had\na hurried breakfast, being anxious to reach the top as early as possible before the clouds commenced to gather round it. The rain had made everything nasty and slippery, and as we had to get up the steep slope, it took us some considerable time before we again got out on the ridge, and both I and the coolies had some bad falls and got a good deal bruised. After getting out on the ridge the ascent was again easier, going up very gradually, but the rattan jungle still gave us lots of trouble, and as I had to go ahead myself and clear the way I got the skin of my face and hands torn a good deal, and smeared all over with blood. At last we reached the top of the mountain, which proved to be only 5,300' high, so I was quite certain that it could not be Gunong Tahan.\n\nWe had a splendid view from there toward the north across immense stretches of low and flat land, Gunong Siam being evidently the last peak to the northward of that range of mountains in the middle of the Peninsula whereof Gunong Tahan forms a part. The mountains to the south and south-east were hidden from view, being enveloped in the clouds. The top of Gunong Siam is only a long and very narrow ridge, being in some places only four feet wide, and covered with thick brushwood. After the coolies had rested for an hour I sent them down another side of the mountain, which I thought would take us down to the Kateli river sooner, with orders to stop as soon as they found water and suitable camping ground. I remained on the top of the mountain together with one of the Malays, in the hope that the clouds would clear away and enable me to get a view of the other mountains. In this I was not disappointed, as the mist cleared during the afternoon, and I got a good view of the Pulang Rabong range to the south and south-east, from which we seemed to be separated by the river Kateli. This range is about the same height as Gunong Siam, and behind it, far away to the southeast, I now and then got a glimpse of a higher mountain the top of which was continually hidden by the clouds; and I felt certain that this must be Gunong Tahan, there being no other mountain in sight approaching the same height as that. I saw at once that it would be impossible to reach it by going straight from where we were, as we should have to cross ridge after ridge of Pulang Rabong to get there, and\nafter the experience that we had had of the Kateh ridges I thought it most probable that we should never get there that way. We could either go round to the north of Gunong Siam, and then due south till we reached the foot of the mountain (and this would certainly save us a lot of trouble as the country round that way seemed to be fairly flat), or else we could go to the southward of Tulang Rabang and then straight to Gunong Tahan. This route appeared to be the shortest from Pulai, and I selected it though I knew the country to the southwards to be very mountainous, and difficult to get through; but as I wanted to do a little collecting on the Tulang Rabang, this suited me the best. After being fully satisfied that it was really Gunong Tahan that we were looking at, we commenced our descent, a shower of rain hurrying us on, and we soon overtook the coolies, who had not yet found any suitable place for camping. It was already commencing to get dark, and we were threatened with heavy rain so we hurried on as fast as the ground would allow us to travel, and just before it got dark we found a place beside a small stream, with plenty of large palm leaves close by, so all hands were soon busy making a shelter; and just as the rain came pouring down we had got it ready, and could cook our dinner. The camp was at 4000' so it was rather cold up there, and we had to keep a large fire burning the whole night; but still the Malays complained about the cold, and were glad when we started next morning for the valley. We expected to strike our old track from Pulai during that day, but somehow we missed it, and got into country unknown to us; so I decided to follow the Kateh downstream, until we reached the village which I knew existed close to its junction with the Gatas. We reached the place late the next afternoon, and slept that night in a small Malay hut. Next day I got a couple of Malay guides, who took us back to Pulai where I arrived shortly after noon; but some of the poor coolies did not arrive till shortly before dark, being thoroughly done up, with their feet full of thorns and bleeding from innumerable leech bites.\n\nWe now remained some days in Pulai to recoup ourselves, during which time I tried hard to get some more coolies; but only succeeded in getting two more from a village down river\nas none of the Chinese from Pulai would go with me into the jungle. It was now the beginning of September, and the rainy season was commencing, so we were likely to have a rather bad time of it during our journey. The night before we started on our second trip it rained very heavily, and in the morning all the jungle paths in the low land were transformed into small streams, and the rivers were all in flood. For half a day we followed a track which ran due south into Pahang, the borders of which are only one day's journey from Pulai, but coming across an old Chinese gold mine, all overgrown with jungle, we completely lost sight of the path, and after wasting some time trying to find it again I decided to cut a path myself, going in a more easterly direction as I was afraid we were getting too far south. After doing this for some time we came across another old disused path evidently leading to some other old workings, and this we followed till evening, when we camped at a small stream. Next day we reached a large limestone cliff, at least 500' high, very long but narrow, being in one place where a narrow passage ran right through it, not more than 20' wide, whereas it must have been several miles long, for I started to go round it, but after marching for one hour and seeing no sign of the end of it, I gave it up and returned. We found a small cave (Gou the Malays call them), and we camped in it for the night, the Malays however preferring to sleep outside, as a cold wind seemed to be coming down through some opening in the roof. I sent a couple of my best men out to try and scale the cliff and obtain a view of Taban, which we had not yet seen on this journey; but they found it impossible to get up, the sides being everywhere perpendicular or overhanging, and there were no bushes or roots growing on the sides, to hold on by. The following day we struck a branch of the Kateh river, which ran in a southerly direction, and following it up we came to a deep pool full of fish; so I discharged a dynamite cartridge in the midst of them, and that night my Malays had a real feast, fresh fish being very scarce at Pulai, for there are none to be found in the Ulu Galas, where all the deep pools in the river have long since been filled up by the washings from the gold mines, leaving the fishes no place to breed or hide from their enemies. We then ascended a ridge running parallel with the\nTulang Rabong range, and reached a height of 2500', but had to descend again on the other side, as a river had to be crossed which proved to be a branch of the Temom, which again is a tributary of the large Pahang river. The descent was very steep and very slippery from the rain and just as we reached the river bed I slipped on a large boulder, and fell with great force against a large root, hurting my right side very much, and was unable to move for some time. I was afraid I should be unable to continue the journey, and we had to camp there that night, but next morning I felt much better and so we pushed on for another two days, when we struck another of the Pahang rivers, but whether this was another branch of the Temom or whether it was the Keehau I was unable to determine. It rose near the top of Tulang Rabong, as I found out later by following it up very nearly to its source, about 5000' up. We camped at the only level place that we could find, about 1500' above sea level, but at night after a heavy rain we were nearly routed out of our camp by the river, which rose with startling suddenness and nearly flooded us out. The roar of the water rushing past us at a tremendous speed dashing against boulders and over falls was something not to be easily forgotten, and made sleep impossible that night. I decided to let most of my men remain at this place, while I went back to Pulai to obtain a fresh supply of provisions, but before doing so I ascended another range of hills that ran parallel with the river on the opposite side, and reached a height of 4500' from where I had a fine view of Gunong Tahan. I thought it would take us 4 to 5 days to reach the foot of it, and told my men to commence cutting a path up to it while I was away, at Pulai. I then went back, taking with me only two coolies, and walking hard for 24 days we reached Pulai. It proved very difficult to obtain sufficient coolies at once, so I had to send 10 men off first, with provisions for my men, while the headman of Pulai sent for the Malays living farther down stream to come up and go with me. Twelve days were lost in waiting for them, and when they at last arrived there were only 15 of them instead of 25 that I wanted, but finding it useless to wait any longer I started off with these men, taking as much provisions with us as they could carry. These men came from the low land down river and\nwere not used to work in the mountains, so they very soon got tired, and I had continually to sit down and wait for them. We reached the camp of my Malays in four days, and it was my intention to push on the next day for the foot of Tahan; but my Patang Malays, who had been out cutting part of the path while I had been away, had found this such hard work and such difficult climbing that they refused to go on. I argued with them a long time but it was no use, and promises or threats of punishment had equally little effect on them, and next morning they had disappeared, leaving behind them their parangs and spare clothing, which I had taken from them the previous evening, thinking thereby to prevent them from running away. When the Kelantan Malays saw this they also refused to go any farther, and the whole lot of them went back to Pulai leaving me only six men that I had with me from Kota Bharu, and a couple of Pahang men that joined me a few days later. Including myself and my Chinese boy we were nine in all, and to push on for Gunong Tahan with so few men would have been useless, as we should only have been able to carry enough provisions to take us to the foot of the mountain and back; whereas I wanted to stay some time near the top of the mountain to collect specimens. Therefore I decided to remain where we were, in the hope that the headman at Pulai would send the Kelantan Malays back to me, when he heard how I was situated; and this proved to be correct, the men returning to me at the end of twelve days. In the meantime we had done some collecting, and got a few rare birds and some orchids. My boy who had seen the Chinese at Pulai working gold amused himself by prospecting in the river bed; and one day he brought back to the camp a large piece of quartz which proved to be very rich, the gold being visible running right through it. The lode that it came from could not have been far off, as the mountain which the river sprang from was quite close, but we had no time to look for it.\n\nIt was my intention to take that piece of quartz back with me to Pulai on the return journey; but, as luck would have it, I never came back that way; and so it is still lying there waiting for somebody to come and pick it up. Having got the men back we then made another start, having first to climb the ridge\n1500' high in front of us, and this proved such hard work that\nthe men could not walk any farther when we reached the top,\nand so we camped there, going down the other side next morn-\ning. There we again got into Kelantan territory, crossing a\nbranch of the Gatas river, and went up a long and high ridge\nforming the boundary between Pahang and Kelantan. It was\nright from the foot of Tulong Rabong to Gunong Tahan, and as\nit did not appear to be known to the Malays, we christened it\nBukit Gajah on account of the number of elephants that were to\nbe found there, the top of the ridge seeming to be their regular\nhighway. We saw only female elephants, the males being very\nscarce in Kelantan, where everybody is allowed to shoot them,\nand before long these will be quite extinct. We kept along this\nridge for four days, reaching a height of 4500' and then com-\nmenced to descend, being then opposite to Gunong Tahan, and\nonly separated from it by a river, which proved to be the Relai,\na tributary of the Lebuh. None of the branches of the Gatas\ncome from the mountain, and it was evidently a great mistake\nmy trying to get up from there, as the way up from the Relai\nor Aring rivers is much nearer and easier. The descent was\ndifficult and would have been well nigh impossible if the ele-\nphants had not been there before us; but by following their\ntracks, and using the deep indents made by their huge feet, we\nmanaged to scramble down and reach the river, which is here\n1200' above sea level. Arriving there the Kelantan Malays left\nme and returned to their homes, and I was not sorry to lose\nthem this time, as these men had enormous appetites and\nwere eating up nearly all my provisions. The rest of us stayed\na couple of days at the river, and then, having found a spur that\nseemed to go in the right direction, we commenced the ascent.\n\nThe first 1000' were very difficult, and took us a long\ntime to negotiate, but after that we got out on another spur\nand the ascent got much easier, there being a fairly good track\nmade by wild beasts. Reaching a height of 1000' we got into\nrattan jungle, which seems to grow on all the Kelantan\nmountains of any height: so we left the comb of the spur and\nwent down the side until we found water, where we then\ncamped; but could not find any level place for our shelter, and\nhad to build it on the side of the hill, and as it came on to rain\nheavily towards evening we had a rather bad time of it that night, as the water came pouring down the hillside on the ground that we slept upon. I myself was lying on a few raised sticks and was fairly well off; but the Malays had been too lazy to cut enough of these for themselves, and so had to sleep on the ground on a few leaves, with the water running in streams under them. Next morning on starting we soon got into rattan jungle again, and owing to the difficulty of getting through this, we only got up another 1000' that day, camping at night by the side of a small stream. As this seemed to be a likely place for collecting purposes, I decided to make it my headquarters for the time that we stayed on the mountains. It took us two more days to cut a path to the top of the mountain, the jungle being very dense and difficult to cut through. Every afternoon it rained heavily, so that we always got drenched before we could get back to camp; and as the path we had cut was only a very poor affair, we had to go bent double half of the way on account of overhanging branches, and it was very annoying to feel the water running from my cap down my neck, finding its way down my back, and finally coming out of my shoes. In the camp it was very cheerless too, in the evening, there being only very few leaves suitable for making a roof in the neighbourhood and consequently our shelter was very small and badly made. From the top of the mountain, we saw the village on the Aring river where I had stayed on my first trip, and as that appeared to be the only place within measurable distance from which we could obtain any food, I decided to send some of my men there to get a fresh supply of provisions, as we were running short of these. I told the men to follow the Relai river, when they reached the foot of the mountain, until they were clear of the hills, and then strike across country till they reached the Aring, when they were to follow that stream till the village was reached. There they were to buy provisions and get some coolies to carry them back to us. I sent three men, and when they left we had only provisions left us for another ten days; but by giving out short rations I hoped to get them to last until the men could come back from the village. The rest of us stayed up there collecting, and I found the best collecting ground to be between 5000' to 7000', but we also went several times right up\nto the top when the weather was fine, in the hope of finding traces of the men that I left on my first trip; but could find none where we were, which, considering the immense size of the mountain, was not at all strange, as half a dozen different parties might have been on the mountain, without seeing each other. Far away we could see a large black patch that looked as if the low jungle had been burned away; but it was too far for us to attempt to reach it, as we should not have been able to do much collecting on the way, and I wanted to get together as large a collection as possible before our provisions gave out. Later on, I found out that it really was a piece of jungle that my men had burned down to attract our attention, but they had already left the mountain two months before we reached it. The mountain seemed really to consist of three separate ranges running parallel from about east to west, connected with each other at their highest points by a number of peaks, the one in the middle being the highest. In the ravines between the different ranges the following rivers had their sources, as far as I was able to judge with the help of my Pahang Malays:\u2014towards the Kelantan side the river Relai and two branches of the Aring; towards the Pahang side the rivers Kechau, Tahan, and perhaps also another branch of the Tembeling,\u2014as I am not sure that the river which we struck on my first trip was not a branch of that river, and not the Tahan as the Sakais stated. I found that all the branches of these rivers which sprung from anywhere near the top of the mountain, had very discoloured water, something like the water found in stagnant swamps; whereas the streams that came from an altitude of less than 4000' had beautifully clear water; but what might be the reason of this I did not find out. Nearly the whole of the mountain consists of white quartz. From my own experience on the Tahan or Tembeling river, and from what I saw from the top, I should say that it will be very difficult to get up from the Pahang side, as the mountain on that side is very precipitous (probably deriving its name of Tahan on that account) and provisions have to be carried a much greater distance than from the Kelantan side. I only saw one village on the Pahang side, lying beside a huge limestone cliff that somewhat resembled the shape of an elephant; but none of my men could give me any\ninformation as to the name of the river by which it was situated. If anybody wants to try and get up from the Palang side I would recommend him to start from that village. There was a very grand view from the top, especially very early in the morning, when the mist covered all the low-lying land, making it resemble a lake of snow; and so low did the mist keep to the ground that the top of some of the tall jungle trees could be seen, looking like masts of sunken ships, and the smaller mountains stood out dark and sombre like islands in this beautiful lake. Later on in the day the mist would gradually rise and come rolling up the mountain side, with the dark clouds gathering fast near the top, and in the afternoon and evening the rain would come down in torrents. The trees and rocks were all covered with masses of long moss in which the rain kept hanging, so that it was impossible to move about without getting wet; and we had to go about day after day in wet clothes, with wind and rain blowing in on us at night. Besides which my Malays suffered much from the cold at night, when the temperature often went down to 5\u00b0.\n\nAltogether I stayed eighteen days near the top of the mountain, and I got a very good collection of birds and some orchids; but I was only able to take a small quantity of the latter, as transporting a large number of them to the coast would have been impossible with the few men that I had. Of mammals we only got very few, and the same was the case with insects, of which I had hoped to get a lot; but with the wet and miserable weather that we had, all the insects that we saw flew very high, and even if they had come down, it would have been nearly impossible to chase and catch them in the thick low brushwood that covered the whole of the upper part of the mountain.\n\nFor the last few days that we stayed up there we only got half rations, as I was very loath to go down, hoping that the three men would return from the village in time with the provisions; when it was my intention to remain up there for another fourteen days. But when the last grain of rice and all the tinned provisions were finished, we had to start on the way down, taking with us all my collections except the orchids, which I was forced to leave behind as we could not carry them with us. I expected to find the men with the provisions at the foot of the mountain,\nbut on arriving there we found no sign of them. However I had left there four tins of salmon and two pounds of biscuits when we went up the mountain, and we now made a scanty meal of half of these, reserving the other half for next day. At night we discussed what was to be done, and as all the Malays wanted to make for the nearest village to obtain food there, I gave in; though I would rather have remained at the foot of the mountain and waited for the return of the three men, living on the mountain on such game as we could shoot and snare. Early next morning we started, leaving most of my things behind in the camp, taking with us only a blanket each, and my collection of birds. My Malays wanted me to leave the latter behind to enable us to travel quicker, but I was afraid the skins would be spoiled before we could return for them, and so I made the men carry them along. Following the Relai river we soon came past the mountain, and as the three men who had gone before us had made a track for us we got on rather quickly. A couple of hours walking brought us to a shelter where these men had camped, and beyond this were two tracks, so it was evident the men had gone wrong first, and finding this out, had returned to this place and struck out in another direction. We kept on following the river, but soon got into difficult country, with spurs from the mountains running right down to the river, so that we often had to cross the same, to escape having to climb over these hills, some of which were rather high and steep. Having to cross the river so often delayed us a good deal, as the river was in flood, the water coming tearing down with great force; and great care had to be taken in crossing over. The course of the river was very crooked indeed; but we had to keep to the banks and follow all its bends and windings, as we got into the hulls as soon as we attempted to cut off some of the corners; and the Malays declared they were unable to do any climbing, as they had had so little food for the last few days. So on the whole I do not think we got very far that day. After rigging up a shelter for the night we fired a couple of dynamite cartridges in some pools in the rivers, but only got a few small fishes, that would scarcely have satisfied the hunger of one man. So I got the Malays to collect some young palm shoots, and we made a meal of them; but the Malays declared that they were\nno good, saying there was absolutely no strength in them, and on the following days I could not get them to collect any. The next day we kept on following the river, hoping to find some bamboos, of which we then intended to make a raft and drift down stream until we reached the Sakai settlement which I knew existed there; but to our great disappointment there were none to be found in that part of the country, so we kept trudging along, now on this, and now on that side of the river, the Malays complaining very much, and getting more disheartened the farther we went. I tried my best to cheer them up and get them to hurry on, but finding this useless, I left them and went on by myself till some time in the afternoon; when having found a suitable place for camping I sat down and waited for them. When they at last arrived I had great difficulty in getting them to collect leaves for a shelter, as none of the large kind of palm leaves were to be found in the vicinity, and the men preferred to sleep in the open rather than to take the trouble of making a shelter of the smaller leaves found there. However I insisted on having one built, and lucky it was that I did so, as the rain came pouring down as soon as it was finished, and this lasted half the night, so we should have been in a sorry plight had we had no roof over us. While the men made the shelter I fired another charge of dynamite in a pool, and this time I was more successful, getting a number of good-sized fishes. So we had enough for a fairly good meal that night and for another the next morning before we started, that being the last food we tasted before we reached the village four days later. The river was now in flood to such an extent that it was dangerous to cross over, and as we could not keep continually on one side of it owing to the many hills, we decided to leave it altogether and strike across country until we reached the Aring, where we could make a raft and drift down to the village. Soon after we had left the river bank, we got to some hills, and seeing no chance of getting round by the foot of them, I started climbing up, the Malays of course protesting; but as I did not take any notice of that, they had to follow me, grumbling very much as they went, and sitting down very often to rest. My Chinese boy proved to be the best man of the lot and kept fairly close behind me, whereas the Malays were soon left far behind.\nThe hill proved to be very much higher and steeper than I expected, being in fact a mountain range 3,000' high, dividing the Relai and Aring rivers, and the Malays were terribly done up when they at last reached the top. While I waited for them up there, I found a spur sloping gently down on the other side towards the north-east, and this we now followed right to the foot of the range, where we came across a small stream and camped close by it. We had no dinner that night, but there being still some tea left, we each had a cup of this before going to sleep. Following the stream next day we at last reached the Aring river, of which this was a tributary called Patei. It was about noon when we struck the Aring, and great was our joy on finding an old disused bamboo raft lying half way up on the banks. It had evidently been left there by some gutta hunters, and we soon had it in the water; luckily it was just big enough to hold us and our things, and after having cut some long poles to steer with, we started on our way down river.\n\nOwing to the late heavy rains the river was in flood, and this was rather in our favour, as there would be no shallow places over which we otherwise would have had to haul the raft. We were travelling at a great rate of speed, it being impossible to stop the raft, but we did not anticipate any danger, as the Malays seemeed well able to steer us clear of all rocks and snags. The men were all in high glee, now, at the prospect of soon reaching the village, shouting, singing and chaffing each other, and in their own estimation they were evidently great heroes. So we went dashing down one rapid after the other, the men yelling derision at them all, when just as we came round a bend in the river we dashed into the stem of a huge tree that had fallen across the stream and effectually blocked the whole river. The thing happened so suddenly that it was impossible to do anything to prevent it; there was a great cracking of the bamboos and down went the raft, throwing us all out in the river. We all managed to scramble up on the tree, and as all our things were light we fished them up again, with the exception of my only pair of shoes, which I had taken off as a precaution when we started, in case we should have to swim for it. We also managed to haul the raft up over the tree, and\nas the Malays thought that it would still hold together, we decided to go on with it. A great many of the bamboos had been split open by the collision, so the raft was not nearly as buoyant as it had been before, and could scarcely carry us all. Going down over the rapids now became very dangerous, as the water would come rolling in over the raft, pressing now this now that side under water, so that we had difficulty in balancing ourselves on it, and I was afraid the raft would go to pieces at any minute. So after we had had about one hour of this dangerous sport, I thought it better to stop and keep to the jungle. So we landed and made a shelter, but it was a very poor one, the Malays being now again very disheartened, did not work very willingly, and the rain coming on again we passed a really miserable night in our wet clothes, with wet blankets, and the rain dripping on us from above, and running in streams under the few leaves on which we had made our bed, and without a morsel of food. Next day we looked for bamboos with which to repair our raft, but not finding any, we had to abandon it and start on our weary tramp again. I went ahead myself cutting a path for the others, as they all had something to carry, and a pretty bad time I had of it with my bare feet: for as I had to keep looking ahead, I could not always see where I put my feet, and as a consequence I often trod on thorns and sharp sticks; besides which there were thousands of leeches about, which took a great fancy to my bare legs, where they stuck till they had had their fill, as I often felt too weary to stoop down and pick them off. We knew that there was a native path on one side of the river, running from the village into Pahang; and so we went inland away from the river, trying to find it, but coming to a range of hills the Malays declared themselves unable to get over them; so we had to go back to the river and follow its many bends and curves. Often we had to make great detours inland when we came to tributaries of the Aring, which were deep and swollen, so that we had to find fords before we could cross over them. We walked the whole day, camping just before it got dark, and started off again early next morning, having then good hopes of reaching the village that day, as I had found some landmarks that I knew. The Malays were however very slow, so I got\nfar ahead of them all, by myself, thinking they would hurry on when they found that they were being left so far behind. Towards three o'clock in the afternoon, just when I had decided to stop and await my men, I heard a shout down river, and on my answering, a boat appeared, that had been sent up from the village to meet us. Two of the Malays whom I thought were far behind me had lost my track altogether, and in looking for it they had come across the real path to the village, and this cheering them up, they had hurried on to the village, and hearing there that we had not yet arrived, they sent a boat up stream to meet us. I waited till my other men came up, and then we all went down the river to the village, arriving there just as a heavy thunderstorm came on, and very thankful were we to be under a good roof again. The day after, the three men that I had sent for provisions came back to the village with a long tale of woe. They had arrived there four or five days before us, having taken fourteen days to reach it, whereas it took us only seven days. They had then bought some provisions and started on their return journey to the mountain. When two days out, their Sakai coolies ran away and left them; and instead of pushing on by themselves as they ought to have done, they returned to the village to obtain other coolies. So it was well for us that we did not stop at the foot of the mountain and wait for them to come back.\n\nAfter the men had rested for four or five days, I sent them back to the mountain, together with a number of Malays from the village, to fetch the orchids and my other things that we had left behind. The coolies were to bring these back to Buntie, whereas my own men would go from the mountain back to Pulai, where they would fetch those of my things that I had left there; and then going down by the Galas river, join me at Kota Bahru. It was impossible for me to return to the mountain myself, having no shoes, with my feet in a terrible state, swollen and torn, so that I was scarcely able to walk for days after. Had it been otherwise I should certainly have gone back and stayed up on the mountain for another month. Shortly after the men had left I got a bad attack of fever, which luckily did not last very long but left me very weak. I got a tiger while waiting for the return of the men, there seeming to be\nplenty of them in that part of the country, as a report came to hand that two men had been eaten by them at Quala Aring just before. Going down stream we passed eight of them,\u2014two old and a young one,\u2014that were disporting themselves in the jungle close to the bank; but we were then just passing over a rapid, and travelling at a great speed, so that it was impossible to get a shot at them. After waiting ten days the coolies returned, and I started on the return journey to Kota Bahru, the trip down stream taking only eight days, as all the rivers were in flood. The men that I had left on my first trip upon the mountain I picked up on the way down, and they stated that they had succeeded in scaling one of the peaks of the Tahan, to the south of where I got up, and they brought a fairly good collection of skins back with them.\n\nI had to wait about a week in Kota Bahru for my men from the Galas river, and then went back to Singapore, the whole trip taking seven months instead of three as I had reckoned on.\nOn the Hymenoptera collected by Mr. Robert Shelford at Sarawak, and on the Hymenoptera of the Sarawak Museum.\n\nBy P. Cameron, of New Mills, Derbyshire.\n\nThis paper is based on material collected at Sarawak, by Mr. Robert Shelford of Cambridge University and on the species in the Sarawak Museum brought home by Mr. Shelford for the purpose of being named. In addition to many known species the two collections contain many noteworthy undescribed genera and species. Since the publication of the paper by the late Mr. F. Smith (Jour. Linn. Soc, 1857) on the Hymenoptera collected by A. R.

It has 3- and 6-jointed palpi as in Zethus, and it has further the head largely developed behind the eyes as in that genus and thereby differs from Eumenes. The petiole is shorter and stouter than it is in the typical Zethus and also the second segment is not contracted at the base into a neck. The form of the cubital cellules is different from what they are in Eumenes and more like what they are in Zethus. It is not a typical Montezumia either, although it has certainly some affinity to that genus, which has five jointed maxillary palpi. I leave it, in the meantime, in Montezumia, which is, strictly speaking, an American genus.\n\nZethus varipunctatus, sp. nov.\n\nBlack; the upper side of the mandibles and a large mark on the apex of the clypeus, yellow; the scape of the antennae, the tegulae and the legs rufous; the hinder tibiae and tarsi blackish; wings fuscous-violaceous towards the apex; the apex of the clypeus broadly rounded, not dentate.\n\nLong: 17 mm.\nHab.

Any vocabularies, grammatical notes, specimens of sentences with literal (verbatim) translations, and even lists of personal names, would be welcome, if accompanied by a clear statement of (1) the name of the tribe to which they refer; (2) its location (district and state, and approximate position on the map) and, if possible, (3) a short description of its physical characteristics.\n\nI venture to appeal to members of the Society, or their friends, who may have collected such information, but have not the leisure or the inclination to work it up themselves, to assist me in this way in the work of collating these dialects. Much valuable material remains unpublished and is ultimately lost because men, who have been at some trouble to collect it, keep it back with a view to completing it with additional matter which they eventually have not time to collect.\n\nI am particularly in want of specimens of the aboriginal dialects of the Negri Sembilan and Pahang, but any information relating to the aborigines of the Peninsula will be most welcome.\n\nWhile on the subject of dialects, may I venture to draw the attention of the members of the Society to the importance of accurately recording the various dialects of Malay which are spoken in the Peninsula. Apart from a few scrappy notes about the pronunciation of certain letters, practically nothing has been done in this department. There are now, however, in most districts of the Peninsula, Europeans well qualified by a more than adequate knowledge of standard Malay, and if each of them were to compile a record of the local peculiarities of\nthe dialect spoken in the particular district where he was stationed, the result would be an invaluable contribution to the scientific study of the Malayan languages. Local dialects, which were formerly neglected under the mistaken idea that they were mere corruptions of the standard or written language, are now recognized to be of great importance from the philological point of view, and in many countries they are being accurately recorded and studied. It is regrettable that in this respect we should lag so far behind the Dutch, who have by this time compiled more or less adequate records (some of them in every way admirable) of almost every language and dialect spoken in their vast section of the Archipelago. To take one instance, of which I have some slight personal knowledge: we possess an excellent Dutch dictionary of Menangkabau Malay and a goodly number of specimens in prose and verse, of that curious and interesting dialect, yet, though this same dialect, with slight variations, is spoken in Naning (Malacca) and the Negri Sembilan, where scores of Englishmen have heard it spoken, we have no adequate English record of it.\n\nWhat is wanted, among other things, is an accurate account of\n\n1. peculiarities of intonation and accent;\n2. peculiarities of pronunciation of particular syllables, especially finals;\n3. grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, if any, e.g. the use of prefixes or suffixes different from those of ordinary Malay; and differences in the construction of sentences;\n4. preference for one of two synonyms where the standard Malay prefers the other;\n5. the use of words with a meaning differing from that which they have in the standard language;\n6. local words, simple and derivative, not found in the standard language;\n7. local phrases, turns of speech and idioms.\n\nAnother subject which needs working up is that of place-names, both those that appear to be Malay and such as have no meaning in Malay and are probably in some cases Aboriginal.\nThese latter may eventually throw considerable light on that dark subject, the condition of the Peninsula prior to the Malay immigration.\n\nI need hardly add that though I have specially dwelt on the Malay Peninsula, as the immediate domain of the Society's scientific interests, yet I do not mean to underrate the importance of contributions relating to other Malayan countries.\n\nC.

O. Blagden.\n\nIn a former paper I endeavoured to point out that the aboriginal dialects of the Malay Peninsula show distinct traces of an Indo-Chinese element, impressed upon them, probably at a fairly early date, by the intrusion from Southern Indo-China of a race of Mon-Annam stock speaking a language which was closely allied to that of the Peguans and Cambodians.* The object of the present paper is to introduce the readers of this Journal to what may perhaps be appropriately described as the converse phenomenon, namely, the persistence (from a still remoter era) in some parts of Southern Indo-China, of distinct relics of an independent group of Malayan dialects, underlying the now dominant Indo-Chinese languages of that region.\n\nAs might be expected, the modern representatives of this group are far from being pure Malayan tongues: they exhibit obvious traces of the Mon-Annam and other influences to which they have for many centuries been subjected, and it is by no means certain that, in their present mixed condition, they can all claim to be classified in the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages. But whether that claim, which is sometimes made for them by French scholars more familiar with the Indo-Chinese than the Malayan languages, could be substantiated or not; whether, that is to say, these mixed dialects are to be regarded\n\n* This subject has been learnedly and (so far as the materials at his disposal permitted) exhaustively handled by the Rev. Father W. Schmidt in a recent paper \"Die Sprachen der Sakei und Semang auf Malacca und ihr Verh\u00e4ltnis zu den Mon-Khmet-Sprachen\", which appeared in Bijdragen tot de Taal-hand-en Volken-Kunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb Vol. LII (Series 6, part 8) Fasc. 3-4 (The Hague, 1901).\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the author's conclusions will stand the test of the further evidence that can be adduced; but at any rate he has marshalled the evidence that was before him with admirable skill and scientific acumen.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nas genuine Malayan languages overlaid with foreign accretions, or, on the other hand, as alien tongues containing a large number of old Malayan loan words, is not for the present purpose very material. In order to decide this point and to determine whether these mixed languages partake more of the Malayan or of the Mon-Annam type, a careful study of their structure and grammar would be required, but the materials for such a study are at present very deficient, and in either case these dialects even in their present state presuppose, as I intend to show, the existence of a distinct Malayan continental group established at a very remote period in the south of Indo-China.\n\nThe chief of these languages is Cham, the language of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Champa, which in medieval times occupied the country now called Annam, and in the period just preceding its fall (which occurred in A.D. 1471) had its centre on the East coast of Indo-China about lat. 14\u00b0 N., though one of its earlier capitals was as far north as lat. 17\u00b0 37' N. This language is still spoken in a few inland villages of the Annamese province of Binh Thuan, near lat. 12\u00b0 N., and by the immigrant Cham community in Cambodia; the latter is now Muhammadan in its entirety, but the Chams that remain in Annam are mostly pagans. Each group has its own dialect, but apart from slight variations the language of both is the same. It is written in a complex alphabet of Indian origin: inscriptions, both in Sanskrit and in Cham, abound in Annam, and the former go back to about the 3rd century after our era.*\n\n* The Sanskrit inscriptions were dealt with in a paper \"L'Ancien Royaume de Champa d'apres les inscriptions\" by M. Abel Bergaigne in the Journal Asiatique (Paris) Jan. Feb. 1888.\n\nThe inscriptions in Cham, which have more interest for us, from the Malayan point of view, than the Sanskrit ones, have been dealt with by M. Etienne Aymonier in a paper \"Premi\u00e8re \u00c9tude sur les Inscriptions Tchames,\" in the same journal, Jan. Feb. 1891. The earliest known of these Cham inscriptions dates from about the beginning of the 9th century A.D.\n\nIn an inscription dated a little later, recording the dedication of two fields to pious uses, the expression used is huma dua nan, lit. \"fields two those\"; the word for God is Yang, the old word which survives in Malay kayangan and sembahyang. Most of the rest of the inscription is full of Sanskrit words, as indeed the whole series\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nto Ptolemy the metropolis of this region was Balonga. This place can be clearly identified,* on other grounds besides mere similarity of name, with Bal-Angou\u00e9, of which the ruins situated near the coast about lat. 14\u00b0 N are still in existence, and which was therefore apparently the first, or at least the earliest known, as it ultimately became the last, of the Cham capitals. Its fall is narrated, curiously enough, in the S\u00ebjarah Malayu, where it is called Bal, the generic Cham word for \"metropolis\" or \"capital.\"\n\nThe Chams, in fact, are the remnants of what was once a highly civilized nation: they were the furthest outpost of Indian civilization on the Asiatic continent, and their country was a borderland where for over a thousand years Indian culture struggled with and was eventually vanquished by Chinese, the latter being represented by the Annamese, who though non-Chinese in origin had become civilized under Chinese tutelage.\n\nSuch is the history of the Chams in outline: but legends carry it back even further, for the Cambojan traditions, for what they are worth, represent the Chams as having been in occupation of Camboja when the Cambodians first arrived there, some centuries before the Christian era: the immigrant Cambodians are said to have intermingled at first with the Chams but eventually to have got the upper hand and driven out their king.\n\nPhysically the Chams appear to resemble the Malay and Indo-Chinese types, being described as somewhat fairer than the former. Some of them appear to show traces of Indian and Arab blood. Their language, of which a good grammar has been published, is in its present condition a mixed language containing a relatively large number of Mon-Annam elements. Some have regarded it as a Mon-Annam language saturated with Malayan loan words, others maintain that it is a Malayan language modified by Mon-Annam influences. As will appear in the sequel, I am not sure that this may not be something\n\nof Cham inscriptions appear to be, the language in which they were written bearing much the same relation to the spoken Cham, as Kawi probably did to the contemporary spoken Javanese.\n\nThe series extends into the 15th century, to a few years before the fall of the kingdom.\n\n* See J. R. A. S. (1899) 665.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nlike a distinction without a difference; but certain it is, at any rate, that Cham contains a very large percentage (perhaps nearly 50 per cent.) of pure Malayan words; and in this respect it seems to exceed its neighbours, the dialects to be next mentioned.\n\nIt is in the hilly country bounding Annam on the west and separating it from the valley of the Mekong River, about lat. 13\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 N., that these three dialects are found: they are spoken by three savage tribes called respectively Canche, Rode and Chreai. These tribes appear to be on much the same plane of civilization as the Orang Lautan of the South of the Malay Peninsula; their dialects are unwritten, and we owe such slight knowledge of them as we possess to the investigations of the three or four French explorers and administrators who have interested themselves in them. Practically that merely amounts to vocabularies of about 120 or 150 words of each of these dialects.* Besides these, there are other dialects in this region which are apparently more or less related to the above, and of some of which even less is known: \u2020 most of them however show decidedly more relationship with the Mon-Annam than with the Malayan family, the elements which they have in common with the latter decreasing in relative importance as one proceeds north and west from the old Cham region.\n\nThe only other dialect I propose to deal with here belongs to a different quarter altogether: it is spoken by the Selung (or Silung or Salone, as they are variously called) a sea-faring race who inhabit the numerous islands that fringe the Western shore of Tenasserim (Lower Burma) from about lat. 13\u00b0 N. to about lat. 10\u00b0 N., and are marked on maps with the rather high-sounding title of the Mergui Archipelago.\n\nThese people may fairly enough be styled a distant branch of the Orang Laut. Their physical type, to judge from photographs, is more or less that of a rude Malayan race, with (possibly) some admixture of other elements, (of which the Indonesian may be one, as the Selungs, or at least some of them, are\n\n* These are given in Moula, \"Le Royaume du Cambodge.\"\n\n\u2020 Of the Baluan, however, a good dictionary by Doughty has been published (Hong Kong, 1890). It is a Mon Annam dialect but contains a certain number of Malayan words.\n\nJour Straits Branch\nmesaticephalic, while the true Malays tend to the brachycephalic type). The three wild tribes previously mentioned, I should have said, appear from descriptions and such illustrations as I have seen, to be at least in part of non-Malayan stock: some authorities have insisted much upon their Caucasian type, by which I suppose is meant that they differ considerably from the Mongoloid type of features common to both Indo-Chinese and Malays.\n\nThe Selungs, whatever their race may be, are pagans in a low state of civilization, and their language is an unwritten tongue. It comprises several dialects differing considerably from one another, so that people from two islands barely eighty miles apart have some difficulty in carrying on an intelligible conversation together. Several short vocabularies* of this language have been collected at various times by different persons, and they serve to illustrate these dialectic variations: but as it is not quite clear to which dialects they respectively refer, the Selung must for our purposes be dealt with as one language. It would appear to be really a Malayan language, less mixed with other elements than are the tongues already mentioned, and its claim to be mentioned here at all rests merely on its present geographical position: but being the speech of a sea-roving race of islanders it is obvious that its position does not furnish such cogent evidence for the antiquity of Malayan elements in Indo-China as do the inland dialects previously enumerated; nor is it as closely connected with any of them as they evidently are with one another.\n\nIt may however be said to form a link in the chain between these mainland dialects and languages of the Eastern Archipelago; and that is the reason why mention is made of it here, although its existence does not really affect the main argument of this paper.\n\nIt would be merely wearisome to present a whole series of vocabularies of the five languages I have enumerated: a few words will serve to convey some idea of the nature of the Malayan elements which they contain and will exhibit the\n\n* They are given in Anderson. \"The Selungs of the Mergui Archipelago.\"\n\nR.

In fact, even if these words were all that we knew of the dialects in question, we should be justified in saying that they constituted a distinct subgroup of languages, not directly derived from any existing Malayan group. The forms for *one*, *two*, *four*, *five* and *six* run practically through the whole Malayo-Polynesian family almost unchanged. In *four* the mainland dialects approximate most closely, perhaps, to the Bugis *apak* and Madurese *empat*, unless indeed the -k, which appears to be unpronounced in these two languages, is to be regarded merely as a device of writing, not as the remnant of a real -k; Selung agrees with the Javanese and Dayak *pat*. In *six* they all agree with the Javanese *nem* in the absence of the first syllable of the word (Malay *anam*) but retain the a of the second syllable like the Malay (also the Madurese *anam*); the Achinese and Kayan Dayak form *num* is identical.\n\nThe forms for *three* agree substantially amongst themselves and (except that some have a guttural for the initial t-) with the great majority of the Malayo-Polynesian family which retains the old form *tolu* or *telu*; but differ from Malay, which has another word, *tiga*. The nearest approximation to the Cham Cancho and Chr\u00e9ai forms appears to be the Bisaya (Philippines), *tl\u00f3*: compare also the Sulu *K\u00e1ltu\u00e1n* (= Ka-tlu-an), \u201cthirty.\u201d For the guttural, compare Sulu *iklog*, Selung *kloen*, with Tagalog *itlog*, Malay *telor*, \u201cegg.\u201d The Rod\u00e9 contraction *to* recurs in Sulu.\n\nThe forms for *seven*, on the other hand, differ from the typical Malayo-Polynesian *pitu* and agree substantially with the Malay *tujoh*, save only that Selung puts l- for t-.\n\nIn both these cases, it is very noticeable that the dialects now under consideration agree substantially with Achinese (*t\u00e9lhu* or *lhu* pronounced *t\u00e9lh\u00e9e* and *l\u00e9\u00e9e*, \u201cthree;\u201d and *tujuh*, \u201cseven\u201d) and with some of the Dayak dialects of Borneo, for which the reader may refer to No. 5 of this Journal, where out of a list of eleven dialects, ten have forms of *tolu* for *three*, and eight of those ten agree with some others not included in the ten in having forms of *tujoh* for *seven*.\n\n---\n\n* Between Borneo and the Philippines.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nIn *eight* and *nine* there is some confusion, which may be due either to the collector or to the wild tribes themselves; possibly the latter get a little mixed when they come to the higher numbers. Anyhow, they are said to use for *eight* a form *salupan* which occurs again in Sundanese (Java) and also in Mangkasar (Macassar, of Celebes), in the latter under the form *salupang*, and there means, as it ought to mean, *nine*. Oddly enough, the Minangkabau Malays use it, interchangeably with *dulapan* (*delapan*), and also make it mean *eight*. Vice versa, these wild tribes use variants of the Malay and AChinese form of *eight* for *nine*. Cham, it is to be observed, uses both forms correctly, but has also another form for *nine*, viz., *Sumilan*, the Malay *Sambilan* (*Sembilon*), which may perhaps be merely a loan word from Malay itself.\n\nThere has been, in historical times, a Malay immigration from Sumatra (and particularly, it seems, from Minangkabau) into Camboja (where this form *Sumilan* is used) and the Cham and Malay communities in that country, though distinct, are in close contact with each other, and being of one religion sometimes intermarry.\n\nIt is noticeable that Selung differs from the other dialects in having preserved, though in rather uncouth shape, the original Malayo-Polynesian forms for *eight* (*walu*) and *nine* (*siwa*).\n\nIn the forms for *ten* these dialects agree substantially with the AChinese *peluh*, in shortening the first syllable; this does not, apparently, occur in the Bornean dialects, which in other respects show a fairly close resemblance in their numeral systems.\n\nFor *eleven* and upwards the dialects agree amongst themselves and with some of the Bornean dialects, but differ from Malay, AChinese, Javanese, etc., in not using forms compounded with *-balas* (originally *-walas*, the Malay *balas*, \"to repay,\" with the meaning \"to return,\" i.e. to the hand on which the counting was first began).\n\nThe Selung for \"hundred\" apparently has the prefix *sa-* \"one\" reduced to *a*, which occurs also in a Cham subdialect as *ha-*.\n\nThus while there are here particular words agreeing, each with some different Malayan language or group of languages,\nthe sum total of the numeral system of these dialects is quite characteristic in its individuality.\n\nA similar state of things prevails in regard to many other common words, as the following specimens will suffice to show:\n\n**Dog:**  \nCham.: ath\u0101u.  \nCancho.: ason.  \nRod\u0113.: so.  \nChr\u0113ai.: so.  \nSelung.: oiee, aai.\n\nMelano-Dayak asan comes nearest but the word, though not found in Malay (except in the expression gigi asu, \"canine teeth\") is very widespread, e.g. Javanese asu.\n\n**Fowl:**  \nmenuk.  \nmenuc.  \nmenuc.  \n[tus].  \n{manok.  \n{malnauk.\n\nCompare the Javanese (and almost universal Malayo-Polynesian) manuk.\n\n**Tiger:**  \nrimong.  \nremong.  \nimong.  \nlemong.\n\n(The Selung word is different, viz.: punnoo, punk, which finds its analogues in aboriginal dialects of the Malay Peninsula, e.g., T\u0113mbe\u2019 ma\u2019nu (for which see No. 24 of this Journal, p. 17). The AChinese form is rimong like the Cham. I think there is no reason to doubt the identity of the word with the Malay rimau. Possibly the form hariman is a sort of Hobson-Jobson word, that is to say, really the old native Malayan word for \u201ctiger\u201d but twisted into its present form by a fanciful notion that it ought to mean \u201cthe beast of Ilari\u201d (harimriya, see Maxwell, Manual of Malay, p. 21).

This word is a good instance of the rule (first formulated by the late Dr. H. N. Van der Tuuk in his \"Outlines of a Grammar of the Malagasy Language,\" 1865) that \"when the Malay and Batak equivalent word has r and the Tagal or Bisaya has g, both the Kawi and Javanese have no consonant.\" * The Batak form here is boras Tagalog bigas, Bisaya boyas, Kawi uwas, which last contracts to Javanese wos, while Balinese has baus. It will be noticed that Cham and its neighbours here agree most closely with the Sumatran and South Celebes type and differ entirely from the Javan and Philippine. Selung rather stands alone, as in many other words. But Selung -l- corresponds in some other cases to Malay -r- e.g. mata-aloi (= matahari), \"sun;\" yahloam (= jarum) \"needle.\"\n\nRice (in husk) is in Cham pudai; Malay padi, Achinese pad\u00e9, Javanese pari, Batak pay\u00e9, Bisaya palai.

The importance of this particular set of consonantal correspondences was also first pointed out by the late Dr. H. N. van der Tuuk.

Their affinities appear to be most marked with AChinese, as is shown especially by the fact that in common with that language (and quite the opposite to Malay), they tend to throw the accent on the last syllable, which is consequently often strengthened to a diphthong, at the expense of the first, which is weakened and sometimes entirely suppressed: Compare pluh, \"ten\" with the AChinese p\u00ebl\u00fch and contrast the Malay puloh: similarly compare the forms, in\n\nJour.

The Malayan element is strongest in the substantives, but is also represented in some of the verbs and adjectives, e.g.\n\n| Cham. | C'ancho. | Rod\u00ea. | Chr\u00eaai. |\n|-------|----------|------|--------|\n| Buy:  | bl\u00ebi.    | bloi.| btoi.  |\n|       | Malay b\u00ebli, AChinese, bloi. |\n| Sell: | pabl\u00ebi (in Cham: the rest are different): AChinese publoi. |\n| Give: | br\u00ebi.    | brei.| broi.  |\n|       | Malay b\u00ebri, AChinese bri. |\n| Descend: | trun. | trunh. | trun. | [tumau.] |\n|       | Malay turun, AChinese trun. |\n| White: | patih (Cham): potayak, patuk (Selung): Malay puteh. |\n| Drunk: | meubuk (Cham): Malay mebok. |\n| New:  | baruc (Cham): Malay baharu. |\n| Unripe: | mutah (Cham): Malay mentah.\u2021 |\n\n* This is a different th- from the other: this th- and dh- are true aspirates.\n\n\u2020 I take these examples from C. den Hamer's Proeve van eener Verglikende Woordenlijst van zes in de Z.

Soc., No. 38. 1902.\nThe main object of this paper being merely to point out the existence of Malayo-Polynesian words in these languages and not to determine the difficult question of their right to be classified as genuine members of that family, I shall pass somewhat lightly over their grammatical characteristics of which indeed, except as regards Cham, little is as yet known. Cham forms its derivative words, like the Malayan, but unfortunately also like the Southern Mon-Annam languages, with prefixes and infixes: The common ones in Cham are the prefixes: pa, me-, ta- or da- and infixes: -an-, -na- and -am- or -ma-. Most of these reappear, in more or less similar forms, with much the same force, in AChinese; but also in Cambodian, where they are very freely used, and to some extent in Peguan.* Suffixes, corresponding to the Malay -kan and -an\n\n| Prefixes. | AChinese. | Cham. | Khmer. | Mon. |\n|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|------|\n| Verbs of action: causal or merely transitive | ... | p\u00e8-, pu- | pa- | p-, ph- | p-, ph-, b- |\n| Verbs, generally intransitive | ... | m\u00e8-, mu- | mie- | ? | m\u0101- |\n\n| Infixes. |\n|----------|\n| Verbs of state, intransitive | ... | \u00e9m- | m\u0153- | ? | -m- |\n| Substantives | ... | ... | ? | mo- | -m-, -ann- | -m- |\n| Substantives | ... | ... | \u00e9n- | an- | -n-, -an- | [an-?] |\n\nIn some other cases, where the forms agree, the meanings appear to differ somewhat.\n\ndo not appear to be in use at the present time either in Cham, AChinese, Cambodian or Peguan; but if the derivation given above for liman (liman) from lima is right, they must have existed formerly to some extent in Cham.\n\nThe Selung dialect forms verbs by prefixing me- as in metoyam, \u201cto smell\u201d (Malay chium), na- as in na-baut, \u201cto make\u201d (Malay buat), naleat, \u201cto look\u201d (Malay lihat), nadok, \u201cto sit\u201d (Malay dudok, AChinese duk, Cham dok); also, apparently, by nasalizing the initial consonant, as in nadone, \u201cto sleep\u201d (Malay tidor) and nakout \u201cto fear\u201d (Malay takut). But data for the other dialects) through most of the parts of speech, but the non-Malayan element is also, apparently, present in them.\n\n* A few instances of this general correspondence must suffice: there are of course many differences in detail.\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nthis last may possibly be due to the phonetic decay of a prefix of the form man- or m\u0101n- (the Malay m\u0113-, m\u0113ng-, etc.); for a word like mangan, \"to cry\" seems to presuppose an earlier manangan (Malay tanqa, m\u0113ngans) and manach, \"to laugh,\" an earlier mananah (Malay t\u0113r-tawa). The loss of a medial -a- seems more probable than that of a -t-; it may be, however, that the Selung in these words as in \"seven\" had replaced the t by l. In that case these forms probably exemplify the prefix me above.\n\nSelung has the suffix -kan e.g., in the word makkan (for ma-bahkan, am-bahkan or mambahkan, from bah, to \"bring,\" Malay bawa).\n\nThe ideological order of these languages is unknown to me, except that in Chana (as in the Mon-Annam languages again) it appears to agree substantially with the Malay order: the attributive adjective and the genitive follow the principal noun, the object follows and the subject precedes the verb; but in Selung the object precedes the verb, which is very strange, unless it is due to the sentences having been collected through the medium of a Burmese interpreter, in speaking to whom the Selungs may have cast their words into the Burmese order. It is curious that Andamanese exhibits the same phenomenon; but there is no evidence that the Selungs are in any way connected with the Andaman islanders; both in physique and in language the two races are quite distinct from one another.\n\nI have already indicated the conclusion to which a necessarily rather superficial comparison of these dialects seems to me to point: I regard them, or at least all of them except Selung, as proof positive of the establishment on the mainland of Southern Indo-China of a Malayan sub-family which must date its separate existence from a period so remote as to be coeval with the differentiation and dispersal of the existing insular language groups of at least the Western part of the Malayan Archipelago, and which formed something like a link between the Sumatra, Bornean and Philippine groups.\n\nI think it is worth adding that the southern Mon-Annam languages, which so closely resemble the Malayan in certain of their structural forms, though by far the greater part of their vocabulary is radically different and non-Malayan, owe this\nresemblance, in my opinion, to the fact of their having developed on what I believe was originally a Malayan soil. The true explanation of the peculiarities which they share in common with the Malayo-Polynesian family is, I believe, that they have been formed by the synthesis of a language introduced by alien immigrants from the north with the Malayan speech of a people who then already occupied Southern Indo-China. The northern invaders must have absorbed and assimilated these primitive Malayo-Polynesians and imposed upon them their alien language, which in its turn has been twisted, in the mouths of their mixed descendants, into something of a Malayo-Polynesian form, by a process that has been aptly called \"inverse attraction.\"\n\nThe result of such an introduction of a strange tongue is, as a rule, that it becomes modified or recast into some form that comes natural to the people upon whom it is imposed: this may be illustrated by such well known cases as the Pidgin English, of the China ports, Negro English, or the Malay of many Chinese, Tamils and Europeans.\n\nIn such cases the mere vocabulary, though foreign to the speaker, is learnt readily enough; but he cannot help speaking his new tongue in the manner of his old one. He pronounces the new words in the way that comes easiest to him and utters them in what is to him the natural order, though that may not be the order proper to the language as spoken by those whose original speech it was. If it was natural to him to use prefixes and infixes in his old language, I imagine he would be apt to apply them to his acquired tongue in the same way and for the same purposes. This, to my mind, is the explanation of the curious fact that in Cambojan and Peguan we find these modes of formation, which are so characteristic of the Malayo-Polynesian family, while the difference of the material elements of language, i.e. the words themselves, prevents us from admitting an original kinship between the Mon-Annam and the Malayan families of speech.\n\nI am afraid that this idea of the formal elements of language surviving, while the native vocabulary is gradually being superseded by foreign words, may remind some people of the persistence of the grin after the disappearance of the Cheshire\ncat. But the real analogy is to be found in those petrifactions where every cell and fibre of the original wood or other substance are in course of time accurately reproduced by the stony deposit that replaces them. To drop figures of speech, which, however apt, can never be conclusive, when one considers that the Malayan languages readily adopt foreign words and instinctively fit them up with Malayan prefixes and suffixes, one can almost see the beginnings of such a process as I have indicated: words like *ka-raja-an*, *ber-akul* or even *di-report-kun* (which last can be heard any day when a Malay police officer reads from his Station report book in a Police Court) are instances taken at random, where a Sanskrit, Arabic or English loan word has been subjected to this treatment.\n\nOne has only to carry the idea out to its logical conclusion and imagine a Malayan language gradually allowing its native vocabulary to be superseded, more or less completely, by foreign loan words, and the result would be much the same as what we now find in southern Indo-China. If the process were arrested half-way, a fairly evenly mixed vocabulary would be formed, like that of Cham; a more advanced stage of change would result in something like Cambodian; while a thorough application of the same principle might end in producing a language like Peguan, where only a very small percentage of words is to be found which show any signs of kinship with the Malayan family. Nevertheless the ideological order of these languages, that is to say the order of words in a sentence, is substantially the same as in the Malayan languages* and the same system of prefixes and infixes (though not, apparently, of suffixes) still survives.\n\nOn the other hand a strong tendency is noticeable, of which it has been shown that even Achinese (Malayan language) exhibited the beginnings, to contract disyllabic words into monosyllables or at least into quasi-monosyllables, in which one of the two syllables is almost suppressed. There are also other\n\n---\n\n* There is reason to believe that in this respect the Mon-Annam languages did not differ originally from the Malayan.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38. 1902.\npeculiarities which distinguish the Mon-Annam from the Malayan group, e.g., a preference for hard sounds* (surd) and the occurrence of true aspirated consonants: these latter characteristics may be due to the non-Malayan element in these languages.\n\nThe hypothesis here put forward would account for the remarkable resemblance in structure and formal elements between the Malayan and the Mon-Annam languages, a resemblance which, so far as I know, no one has yet satisfactorily explained.\u2020 But of course it must remain a mere hypothesis until these languages have been thoroughly studied and compared with one another.\n\nThis much, however, is certain: one Mon-Annam language which cannot be accused of having been developed on Malayan soil, namely the Annamese, which grew up on the borders of Kwang Si, within the Chinese sphere of influence, does not exhibit these phenomena, but follows the Chinese system of tones, though it has not adopted the Chinese ideological order. I take it that the differences between Peguan and Cambojan on the one side and Annamese on the other are the measure of the difference between a Chinese and a Malayan environment.\n\nWhether, however, this suggested explanation be the true one or not, there remains the fact that in Peguan, and still more in Cambojan, there are a fair number of words (too many to be due to accidental coincidence) which correspond in form with Malayan words of similar meanings. As already stated, they are generally more or less contracted or mutilated, by the weakening or entire loss of one syllable, while the Malayan languages retain them in their fuller disyllabic forms. That being the case, the presumption is that they are genuine Malayan words; and this presumption is strengthened when any of\n\n---\n\n* Clearly, however, it is at a relatively modern date that the Mon-Annam languages have changed some of their sonants into surds: for in many cases (especially in many of the Indian and some of the Malayan loan-words) they still appear as sonants in the written language. Conversely Cambojan pronounces some surds as sonants.\n\n\u2020 Mr. Himly in his paper referred to below, throws out a hint that some such explanation is possible, but does not enlarge upon it.\n\nJour.

It would however be a great mistake to suppose that the bulk of the vocabulary of Peguan or Cambojan can be accounted for in this way: the contrary is the fact, and at first sight any Malay student looking through a dictionary of either of these tongues would be struck with their non-Malayan aspect.

But my present object being to make out merely such a prima facie case as will justify further investigation in this direction, I have thought it superfluous to bring in the corroborative evidence that can be supplied from the other languages.

It is to be feared, for instance, that the late Mr. J. R. Logan's achievements in this direction are not a safe basis for further enquiries to start from.

How it is that the totally distinct stocks known as Papuan, Polynesian, Micronesian, etc., come to speak languages that cannot be severed from the Malayan family, is another problem, also at present awaiting solution. There seems, however, no doubt that it is the case, in spite of the difficulty of finding an explanation for it.\n\n\u2020 Journal of the Anthropological Institute, 1880.\n\n\u2021 In the paper to which a reference will be found below, the most conclusive, perhaps, of these words are the names for sugar-cane,\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\na considerable number of names of plants, animals and the like, which run (more or less) through the whole range of Malayo-Polynesian languages from Madagascar to Hawaii and from Formosa to New Zealand, has shown that the speakers (whoever they were) of the mother tongue from which these innumerable languages were evolved, were a seafaring people, of some moderate degree of civilization, (they were acquainted with the use of iron), who at the stage preceding the differentiation of these languages (but not necessarily originally) inhabited a long coastline of some good-sized country situated within the tropics, somewhere in the western half of the vast region over which these languages now extend. He points to the South-Eastern coast of Indo-China as the country that fits in best with this conclusion; and without going into details, lays some stress on the considerable Malayan element that is to be found in the existing languages of that region, which fact, as he observes, in view of the relative unimportance of the small Malayan communities to be found there in modern times, can only be explained by the hypothesis that they formerly constituted a much more numerous and powerful factor there than they do in our own day.\n\nThis last point it has been my endeavour to illustrate in the present paper.\n\nIt may be convenient if I summarize the conclusions to which the considerations here brought together appear to me to lead:\n\n(1) The Malayan element in Cham and its cognate dialects was not borrowed from any other Malayan language or group of languages. It has been separated from the western insular groups for as many centuries, as they have been from one another, and has become differentiated from them as they have amongst themselves.\n\n(2) The Southern Mon-Annam languages and Cham are at once Malayan and non-Malayan: largely Malayan in structural formation, mixed but predominantly non-Malayan in vocabulary, they are probably the result of an intimate mixture between\n\nbanana, rice (in husk and husked), shark, prawn, sea-turtle, buffalo and crocodile: but there are a good many more besides.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nMalayan and alien tongues. The Malayan element is strongest in the southeast, weakening progressively towards the north and west.\n\n(3) At a remote age, before the introduction of the alien element just referred to, probably the whole coast of southern Indo-China from the Irrawady to the borders of Tongking, and certainly the eastern part of it from Cape St. James to the neighbourhood of Hu\u00e9, was more or less occupied by communities speaking a pure Malayan language, possibly already slightly differentiated into dialects.\n\n(4) It was probably from this region at a time when it was still purely Malayan, that the various emigrations took place, which ultimately carried dialects of that language to the distant islands in which they are now spoken.\n\nI am content to rest this last proposition on the grounds put forward by Professor Kern in the essay already referred to; the other three appear to me to follow, though not all with the same degree of certainty, from the linguistic evidence of which some specimens have here been brought together.\n\nSince writing the above, I have seen in the T'oung Pao for March, 1901 (Series II, Vol. 2, No.1, p.86) a review by M. Gustave Schlegel of a recent Siamese grammar. In noticing this work (which appears to be the best Siamese grammar hitherto published) after pointing out, what has been pointed out before, notably by the late M.Terrien de la Couperie, that Siamese contains a very large percentage* of words common to it and Chinese (especially, the numerals\u2020 which are, up to a certain point, pure Chinese loan words) and also a considerable number of Sanskrit and other Indian words, the eminent Chinese Professor of Leyden hazards the view that the residuum of Siamese will be found to be a Malayan language, and supports this thesis by a few words which no doubt are Malayan but may very well be loan words like the Indian ones; everything that the venerable professor writes is worthy of consideration, but\n\n* De la Couperie puts it as high as 33\u00bd per cent: \"Languages of China before the Chinese\" pp. 59-60.\n\u2020 Not however, \"one\" and \"two.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nwith all deference, I venture to say that this is indeed a bold theory. His chief argument, apparently, apart from the afore-said Malay loan words, is that Fu-nan (or Pu-nam), the old name for the country now called Siam, is capable of being explained by a Siamese derivation which M. Schlegel invents for it: unfortunately all monosyllabic languages lend themselves only too easily to hypothetical derivations of that kind; and that its people, in the early centuries of the Christian era, are described by Chinese chroniclers as being \"ugly and black\" with \"curled hair,\" resembling, the Professor himself says, the Semangs. On the strength of this he assumes the Siamese to be Malayan. Everyone who has been to the Far East should know, and M. Schlegel can hardly have forgotten, that the Siamese are several shades fairer and the Semangs several shades darker than the average Malay complexion: and that neither Siamese nor Malays have curled or curly hair. His argument compels M. Schlegel to deny the historically certain fact that the Thai, that is the present Siamese, are comparatively recent arrivals from the interior of Northern Indo-China; and he entirely overlooks the essential unity of their language with that of the Laos, Shans, etc., right away to the Khamti on the eastern border of Assam and a string of tribes in southwestern China. If the Siamese spoken to-day at Bangkok is at bottom a Malayan language, so must be the languages of all these northern tribes, for they are substantially the same and cannot be severed from one another. That appears to me to be an exceedingly large conclusion to draw from a few Malay loan words to be found in modern Siamese, and I am convinced that it will be repudiated both by Siamese and Malay Scholars with tolerable unanimity.\n\nOf course the possibility that there is a Malayan element in the blood of the modern Siamese of the South is not thereby excluded: that there should be such an element is an almost necessary consequence if the main argument of the foregoing paper has anything in it. But apart from modern intermixture which the difference of religions keeps at a minimum, it can only have come in at second hand through the Peguan or Cambodian inhabitants who occupied Siam before the Thai conquered it. That, however, is a very different matter from the\nhazardous assertion that Siamese is a Malayan language, an assertion which requires far more cogent evidence to justify it than M. Schlegel has supplied in the article to which I refer.\n\nIt is hardly necessary for me to add that this paper is merely intended to draw the attention of the readers of this Journal to the subject; so far as the greater part of it is concerned, no claim is made for originality, and it is in the main merely a restatement of what has been set forth elsewhere in fuller form by others. My excuse for offering it to the Society is that some of the readers of this Journal may not have had access to the existing literature on the subject. At the risk of appearing egotistical, I desire to put on record that at the time my former paper was published, I had not heard of Professor Kuhn's admirable essay entitled \"Beitr\u00e4ge Zur Sprachen Kunde Hinterindiens.\" In it most of my conclusions were anticipated, and, if I had known of its existence, my paper would not have appeared, without at least some reference to it.

D. Machado.\n\nAt the headwaters of the Sembrong, the Bekok and the Simpang Kiri in the interior of Johore, three large streams which, draining one into the other, form lower down the Batu Pahat River, are to be found scattered families of Jakuns. These people live by agriculture, are employed by the Chinese pepper and gambier cultivators in clearing jungle for them, and furnish the Malays through barter, their stock of jungle produce. Years of contact with the Chinaman have robbed them of much of their primitiveness. So great is their assimilation to the Chinaman, that when cadging a bowlful of rice from him, they have been often seen manipulating a pair of chopsticks with a dexterity unequalled by the Chinaman himself. They now profess an abhorrence for monkeys, snakes, lizards and similar delicacies, and it is sometimes amusing to behold their studied look of consternation at any one suggesting the possibility of anything so loathsome forming part of their daily menu. Yet the Malays declare that in the privacy of their own homes, they will devour anything, from a snail to an elephant. They do not regard with disfavour the giving of their daughters in marriage to Chinese planters, such unions usually assuring to them and their relations some measure of certainty of a regular supply of food. They are thus a somewhat mixed people to-day. In general appearance they are not unlike up-country Malays. There is still however that peculiar lustre in their eyes, an appearance of independence and yet of timidity, an indefinable something in fact, which to a practiced observer, at once proclaims them their primitive origin and their probable connexion with the other wild tribes further north in the peninsula. They\ndo not call themselves Jakuns, that word being a term of opprobrium if applied to them within their hearing. Curiously enough, the Sakais also resent the application of the word Sakai to them, and like the Sakais again, they call themselves Orang Ulu, up-country people. The Malays in their dealings with the Jakuns, call them Pa angkat (adopted father) Ma angkat (adopted mother) adik angkat (adopted younger brother) and so on as the case may be. This pleases them hugely, though not to the extent of inducing them to part with their stock any cheaper or in greater quantity. For all that, they are very much harrassed and robbed by the Malays, in particular by those who have some authority over them. In my journeys into the interior of Batu Pahat, I have often had patiently to listen to the complaints of these men against their Malay oppressors, many of undoubted genuineness, without however having the power to render any relief.\n\nIt may not perhaps be generally known that the Jakuns practice the rite of circumcision, but in a way peculiar to themselves. They do not, like the Mohammedans, remove the whole skin, but merely part the upper folds of the prepuce by a longitudinal cut or incision, causing the rest to drop into a bunch below. Asked as to the reason for this peculiar rite, the oldest man present related to me the following legend. Very many years ago, when the whole country belonged to them and they were under the rule of a great Batin (King of their own, as great as the Sultan of Johore,) this great Batin had a wife who for a long time remained childless. At length, a male child was born to them, who after thriving for some time sickened and was on the point of death. On consulting a Pawang (Diviner or Sorcerer) who happened in this case to have been a Mohammedan Malay, he declared that the only means of saving the youth's life was by circumcision. To this the great Batin demurred but vowed that if his child recovered, he would be circumcised. He got well and the operation was in due time performed but in order that he might not thereby be held to have embraced the Mohammedan faith, this peculiar style was adopted, the fiat having in the meantime gone forth that all male Jakun children were in future to undergo this operation in the manner indicated above, which explains the existence of this peculiar\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\ncustom to-day. This custom is utterly unknown to the northern Sakais who appear to dread the operation, so much so that many Pahang Sakais have told me that but for this one operation, they would have embraced the Mohammedan faith. Another reason why a Sakai will not become a Mohammedan is that he will be obliged to eschew such delicacies as he from time to time picks up in the jungle, in particular the bamboo rat (*Rhizomyys*) which is to him the most toothsome and delicate of foods!\n\nThese Batu Pahat Jakuns told me that in days of old, they possessed a very extensive vocabulary of their own. All that now remains of this once extensive vocabulary are a few words, which they still use interspersed with Malay and which are transcribed below. Even these few remaining words, the rising generation of Jakuns do not appear inclined to use, so that in a short time, their once extensive language will be a thing of the past. I should add that a great number of these words have appeared in one of the earlier issues of the Journal collected by Lieut. Kelsall, R.E., from the Endau Jakuns, while a few seem peculiar to the Batu Pahat people.\n\n**List of Jakun Words at present in use among the Jakuns of Batu Pahat.**\n\nNow, klak.\nDay after to morrow, du\u00e1k'.\nMorning, lom.

D.,\n\nCURATOR OF THE RAFFLES MUSEUM, SINGAPORE.\n\nAlthough I have already given some account of the breeding of the huge Phasmid insect, since identified as *Eurycnema herculanea*, Charpentier, in the Annual Reports of the Raffles Library and Museum for 1897 and 1898, it seems desirable to put it on record in a more connected form.\n\nAbout January 1897 Mr. L. A. Fernandis, Taxidermist in the Raffles Museum, received a living female of this species, but as it had passed through several hands, its place of origin could not be traced. Possibly it may have come from Java. He kept it alive, feeding it on guava leaves (*Pisidium guyara*, L.), and in February it began to lay eggs. He kindly presented me with a number of those eggs, most of which hatched during April and May of that year, but one not till August, and the last one in the middle of September. As soon as the young ones were hatched, they applied themselves very vigorously to the consumption of guava leaves, and grew so quickly that the first one out was fully developed on August 11th, casting its last skin on that date, i.e., more than a month before its last sister egg was hatched. During growth they cast off their skin several times without any great effort, only rarely losing a leg in the process, until the last cast, when many of them lost several legs, one even as many as five. Naturally these were then helpless in feeding themselves, not being able to cling on to the guava leaves, and they soon died. But the individuals which were successful afforded an interesting sight when the last skin was cast. Up to this they had been stick-like in appearance (Malay name \"Bilalang Ranting,\" Stick Insect), without wings, of dark brown colour in the earlier stages.\nand turning into grey in the later stages. Now they suddenly appeared in a glistening new green skin, with long wings, and the body seemingly almost double its former diameter. All specimens were female, and a few weeks after they had reached the adult stage, they began to swell up and lay eggs, the first of them being laid on September 16th. None of the females had ever come into contact with a male insect, having been carefully kept in a large airy case consisting of glass and perforated zinc, exhibited in the entrance hall of the Raffles Museum. Eggs were continually being laid by the sister insects up to February 1898, the insects dying about two or three weeks after they had deposited the eggs. Of the eggs laid during the last four months of 1897 and the first two months of 1898, a careful account was kept. Every morning I inspected the case, removed the eggs which had been laid during the past twenty-four hours, and placed the eggs laid on different days in separate boxes, duly dated. The first young ones of this generation appeared in March and the last in August, requiring for their development from 165 to more than 240 days of which great divergence in time I cannot give any explanation. Most of them, however, were hatched between the 193rd and 212th days, the maximum number being hatched on the 205th day. The accompanying table shows the proportions of eggs hatched on different days. This generation was rather weakly, only a few reached maturity, most of them dying off when shedding their skin two or three stages before maturity. The first of them reached the adult stage on August 10th, 1898, and never having come into contact with any male, began to lay eggs on September 15th. These eggs did not develop, and none of the other individuals of this generation laid any eggs.\n\nThe reason why the eggs of the last generation did not develop was very probably in consequence of their artificial surroundings. If I had been able to keep the insects in more natural conditions and to devote more care to their feeding, I feel sure I would have been able to rear a few more parthenogenetic generations.\n\nThis appears to be the first instance of Parthenogenesis observed amongst Orthoptera, and there are now only three Jour. straits branch\norders of insects left in which this mode of propagation has not yet been described, viz., Coleoptera, Strepsiptera, and Aptera. In Hymenoptera Parthenogenesis occurs amongst the Tenthredinidae or Saw Flies, Cynipidiae or Gall Flies, Chalcididae, and certain Bees and Wasps. Amongst Lepidoptera there is perhaps only the one well-established case of Solenobia, and amongst Diptera that of Chironomus, amongst Thysanoptera the case of Thrips, and amongst Neuroptera a doubtful case of one of the Caddis Flies, Apatacia. More common again are well-established cases of Parthenogenesis amongst Hemiptera, viz., in the Aphidae or Plant-Lice, and Coccidae or Scale Insects.\n\nDescription of the adult female: The total length of the largest specimen, preserved dry, is 230 mm (about 9 inches), but all the measurements given below are taken from a very perfect specimen preserved in spirit, measuring 204 mm. (about 8 inches), the total length in both cases being exclusive of the antennae, but inclusive of the ovipositor.\n\nThe head is oval and smooth, 13 mm long, with three very distinct ocelli, the antennae being 27 mm. in length and consisting of 26 joints. The prothorax is corrugated, without spines, and only 11 mm. in length. The mesothorax is 39 mm. long and spined. On its dorsal surface there are about sixteen spines arranged in two irregular rows of eight each, laterally about eight spines on either side, and ventrally two irregular rows of about six spines each. The metathorax, 10 mm. long, is smooth dorsally, but provided with a few blunt spines laterally and ventrally.\n\nAll the abdominal segments are smooth. The first segment measures 12 mm., the second, third, fourth and fifth 14 mm. each, the sixth 15 mm., the seventh 13 mm., the eighth 10 mm., the ninth and tenth 7 mm. each. The ovipositor is large and boat-shaped, measuring 39 mm. and projecting beyond the last segment by 19 mm. The styles are 12 mm. long; they are narrow flat plates with a dorsal vertical ridge, appearing therefore L shaped in transverse section.\n\nThe first pair of legs measures 112 mm., the second 90 mm., the third 122 mm. The femora of all legs bear spines arranged in three rows, but the tibiae of the first pair of legs are almost smooth, whilst those of the second pair are more\nspiny and those of the last pair still more so. The animal has the power of reproducing legs lost during the process of casting of the skin, especially in the earlier stages, but in my specimens the new legs never grew up to the size of the normal legs of the opposite side.\n\nThe wing covers measure 39 mm., the wings themselves 77 mm., reaching down to the end of the fifth segment.\n\nThe eggs are oval and smooth, of dark brown colour, measuring 5 by 4 mm., surmounted by an almost spherical capitulum, 1.5 mm. in diameter. These eggs were figured by Dr. D. Sharp, F. R. S., of Cambridge, in his \"Account of the Phasmidae, with Notes on the Eggs,\" in Willey's \"Zoological Results,\" part IX, fig. 39, under the name of Cyphocrania hamitschi, n.n., and the author says that they are remarkable for the large size of the capitulum. Later on, however, he identified the species as Eurycema herculanea, Charpentier.\nMalay Plant Names.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley and C. Curtis.\n\nIn Journal No. 30 a list was published of Malay names of plants with their equivalents in Latin and English. It has been considered by various persons that it would be useful to have the names in Latin-Malay, and Mr. Curtis has compiled this from the original work. This also gives an opportunity of adding names since obtained, and of making various corrections in identification and spelling. Dr. Clercq, who is much interested in this study of native plant names, has criticised the original list, and added a number of names and suggestions, which are incorporated herewith. One or two words have been added from Clifford and Swettenham's Dictionary, but many of the plant names therein are unidentified with the plants, and so useless for this purpose, and some are not Malay Peninsula words, to which this list has been confined.\n\nScientific Names.

SKEAT.\n\nIn Kelantan and Patani the material of which sarongs, kain lepas, etc., are made is now almost invariably silk or cotton thread imported from Singapore, but in out-of-the-way inland districts a few Malays of the older generation still manufacture a coarse but durable thread of native vegetable fibre (homespun). In the latter case the dyes most commonly used were blue (biru) and purple (umu) with occasionally some green (ijau or empo) and a little yellow (kuning or tula). Red, though much admired, was not commonly used owing to the difficulty of making it fast. When silk is to be dyed, from four or ten kati's weight is now usually bought from peddlers or in the bazaar at from $4 to $4.50 per kati (1\u00bdlbs). The following are the processes by which the required colours are obtained, both silk and cotton thread being similarly treated. I may add that the numbers correspond to a series of standard colours which were shown to my informants when the information was obtained, but which it is unfortunately impossible to reproduce here.\n\nRed:\u2014(1) To dye a kati of silk red from ten to fifteen fruits of the asam gelugor,* with two or three common tamarinds, and as much alum as will cover the nail of the fourth finger, are together put into a pan (blanga), and heated up to boiling-point (sap\u0101 bergelg\u0101k).\u2020 The silk is plunged into the liquid, which is kept on the fire till the whole has been well boiled, when the pan is taken off and allowed to stand all night. Next morning the silk is kneaded to clean it (di-kich\u0101h, Selangor kinchah) taken out, and dried in the sun, and put out in the dew.\n\n* Garcinia atroviridis.\u2014H. N. R.\n\n\u2020 I have given exact Kelantan and Patani pronunciations in this article as likely to be of most interest to the reader.\u2014W. S.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1902.\nfor the night. This method of dyeing silk red is called by Patani and Kelantan Malays \"chelu mala\" (or, in standard Malay, \"chilup malau.\")\n\nOrange:\u2014(2) To dye silk orange [which is called kuning pinat masak, or \"ripe betel-nut yellow\"], the silk may be dipped into the already used red dye. Only a weak solution is required, so that if the strength of the dye (pati) has been absorbed by the first instalment of silk it does not really matter. Of course if a new solution is brewed, care must be taken to see that it is not too strong, but the former method is generally favoured. The silk is dipped into the liquid and stirred about, and then boiled a little, till it is as red as the pulut-pulut flower,* my informant declared. On being taken out again, the dye is wrung out of it, when it is laid aside for the time being. About a \"chupak\" of the fruits of the kasoma klin (kasumba kling) are then squeezed (ranuh) into a dish (pasu), the husks being thrown away. To these are added about ten of the fruits of belumbing mayam, which is also called \"Budh k'rih\" in Kelantan and Patani from its being used for the express purpose of cleaning K'ris blades (di-bach\u00e8 k'rih). These being squeezed into the pasu, a pinch or two of alum is added, (as a mordant), and the mixture is ready. The silk is dipped into this liquid and kneaded in it for a few moments (sa-j\u00e9nilh), after which it is boiled for a short while on the fire. When taken out, it is hung up upon a line in a shady place to dry (di-sid\u00e0 di-tedoh).\u2020 Shade is of importance, as if it is exposed to the sun the colour will fade. It is however exposed to the dew (di-perembong) every night for three nights consecutively.\n\nDark orange is obtained from chips of the heart of the jackfruit (nangku) tree, with the usual mordant (alum and usam geltingor).\n\nYellow:\u2014(3) and all the colours now to be mentioned are now usually obtained from aniline dye-stuffs imported from Singapore. In the absence of such dyes however they are still obtained as follows.\n\n* From lobata whose flower is pink.\u2014H. N. R\n\u2020 In Selangor Malay \u2014 Sindal\n\nJeur. Straits Branch.\nTo dye silk yellow, turmeric or curcuma is pounded in a small specially-made mortar and wrung or squeezed by hand (di-p'rah) to get the juice out of it. Tamarinds, asam gelugor, and alum are added in the same proportion as before, and the silk boiled in the mixture and hung up to dry, as in the \"malau\" process. This dye however like all other shades of yellow must be exposed to the action of the sun, as without this the required tint cannot be obtained.\n\nFor yellow green (4) the treatment commences with the same process as for yellow, but a mixture is added which is made from the root and heart of the \"poko' kedre.\" About a kati (1\u00bd lbs) of this wood is taken, chopped up small (di-chich\u00e9) and heated to boiling point. It is then allowed to stand and cool a little, when the clearer liquor at the top (siring) is spooned off (leaving the thicker stuff, called dodo' at the bottom), and added to the decoction of turmeric before referred to. The rest of the process is the same as before. The same colour is also given by young shoots of the lambutan (Nephelium lappaceum) tree, alum and asam gelugor being added.\n\nFor Green (5) a larger proportion of the \"kedrang\" mixture is applied. For Blue (Green) (6) the process is twice repeated. For Blue (7) a decoction of indigo leaves takes the place of the turmeric. The process is otherwise the same but repeated two or three times till the right tint is obtained.\n\nThe following are the more important kinds of indigo known in Kelantan and Patani.\n\n1. tarung kechi' (= tarum kechil)\n2. tarung gelengge (= t. gelanggang)\n3. tarung Siu (= t. Siam)\n4. tarung aku or tarung utre.* (= t. akar or t. eitan).\n\nFor Indigo (8) the leaves are gathered and thrown into a big earthenware jar called \"tepaye\" (St. Mal. tempayan) together with the bark of the young shoots or young fruit-spikes of the coconut-palm (kuli'pati'nya), one fruit-spike on an average going to each tepay\u00e9. A lump of lime \"as thick as a man's arm\" (besa leng\u00e9) is added, and the silk steeped in the decoction till it becomes of the requisite tint.\n\n* Marsdenia tinctoria (?)\u2014H. N. R.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 33, 1902.\nFor Violet (9) commence with the light red dye (mala), as before, but then steep the silk in fermented coconut milk (ayi ny\u00e0 'dah judi ragi) keeping the silk in it only just long enough to turn it of the requisite tinge, as if not watched, and allowed to remain too long, it will turn a rusty black.\n\nPurple (10) may be obtained either from an infusion of tengar bark or by combination of the \"mala\" (light red) dyeing process with indigo; Dark purple from the serai kayu (Sel. kemundang), a tree with small red edible fruits, with alum and asam gelugor as usual. White (11) is obtained by steeping the silk in a decoction of (burnt) durian skin. Light black or Black (12) is obtained from an infusion of tengar bark or by repeated steepings in indigo, or by burying in the soil of the quarah tree,* yarn already dyed yellow-green (4) or dark purple (10). Dark black (13) by still further repeated dyeing with indigo or fermented coconut milk; Grey (14, 15) by dipping in indigo; Brown (16, 17) by dyeing with \"mundu\"\u2020 bark, alum and tamarinds being added as required; Brown (18) by dyeing with \"mundu\" bark only; and Brown (19) by adding indigo to the above.\n\nI may add that the most generally favourite colour is red after which come yellow and a kind of delicate rose-colour (or madder), which is called kembang petang in Selangor (kembang peti in Kelantan and Patani). Darker and soberer tints are in vogue for the older folks, and the sarong-patterns worn by the women have smaller checks and are more tasteful than those worn by the men.\n\nIn Raman (an inland province of Patani), both Blue and Black dyes are obtained from either the wild or cultivated variety of indigo (tarung utar or tarung kapon) the yarn being steeped in an infusion coloured by the young shoots until the requisite tint is obtained. The black is therefore merely the deepest shade of blue obtainable. Red is obtained from Brazilwood or sepang mixed with an equal proportion of chips of the\n\n* The yarn after dyeing is buried in soil taken from underneath the quarah tree, whose leaves are said to turn the soil underneath it black.

Ridley.\n\nThe tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) are among the most attractive and conspicuous of our smaller beetles on account both of their bright colours, and their rapid movements in the full sun, in the hottest time of the day. They are exclusively carnivorous, chasing their prey consisting of smaller insects and usually flying very briskly, and usually require the use of the net to capture them. The Malay species may be divided into two groups, the jungle-tiger beetles and the road-tiger beetles. The former include species of the genera Tricondyla and Collyris.\n\nTricondyla aptera, Oliv., is the only species of this genus I have seen in the peninsula, and it is by no means common. I obtained a single specimen in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore, and there is also a specimen from Penang in the British Museum. It seems to be abundant in New Guinea and occurs also in Amboina, Aru Islands and Solomon Islands. It is our largest species, about \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch long, and is also remarkable for being quite wingless, a narrow, elongate, deep blue beetle with slender antennae, prominent eyes, and long red legs. I found it running about on the ground with the workers of the common large ant known as Semut Rajah, (Camponotus gigas). This ant makes nests in the bases of hollow trees, and the workers are commonly to be seen scampering about on paths, especially in the early morning and late evening, in search of food. The Tricondyla appears to mimic the ant, for though when the two insects are compared the resemblance is less striking, the general form, long legs, and method of running about cause the beetle to so much resemble the ant that I very nearly let it escape mistaking it for the ant.\n\nOf the genus Collyris we have three species here and probably more will be found, as the species very closely resemble one another. They are much smaller than the Tricondyla but of very much the same shape, though they have\nwings, slender long-legged beetles, blue or violet, which are often to be seen flying and scampering over leaves on bushes in the bright sunny spots of the jungle. The commonest species is *C. dolens*, Chand., which I have collected in Singapore, Selangor, Penang and elsewhere. *C. filiformis*, Chand., is a more slender species, bright violet blue with red legs. *C. apicalis*, Chand., is rather larger, very dark in colour, almost black, with red legs and a reddish patch at the apex of the elytra. It is common in the Botanic Gardens.\n\n*Therates humeralis* has broader elytra and more resembles a road tiger-beetle. It is blue with tawny shoulders and red legs. I have collected it in Singapore.\n\nOf the road tiger-beetles with broad elytra, which dart about on sandy roads, taking short flights, then running a little on their long legs and off again, we have two genera, *Cicindela* and *Heptadonta*. The first genus seems to be very widely distributed, abundant in Europe and North America as well as in the tropics. The larvae of the temperate climate species are soft bodied with large heads and powerful jaws. They live in holes in the ground from the entrance of which they look out for passing insects on which to prey. The larvae of our species doubtless resemble those of colder climates, but they have not yet been investigated.\n\nThe commonest species is *Cicindela aurulenta*, Fabr., which is very abundant on sandy roads in Singapore, Perak, Penang, Province Wellesley and elsewhere. It is abundant on the west Hill in Penang at an altitude of 3000 feet. The upper surface is of a dark blue green with six golden spots on the elytra. The abdomen beneath is coppery red. It has very powerful black curved jaws, but cannot bite though the skin. Altogether it is a very beautiful beetle.\n\n*C. fuliginosa*, Dej., is smaller and rather less common, though by no means rare. The elytra have a dark brown key pattern on a cream ground. I have met with it in Singapore, Penang, Province Wellesley and Perak, and it will probably be found all over the peninsula as well.\n\n*Heptadonta unota*, Fabr., has the same form and habits as the two Cicindelas, but is a plain dark blue-green beetle without any spots. It is widely distributed, occurring in Penang,\n\nJohn Watts Brinch\nMALAY TIGER BEETLES.\n\nSelangor and Perak and is also found in Bombay, Java and Sumatra.\n\nI identified these beetles by the collections in the Natural History Museum. There are probably other species to be found in the peninsula, especially in our hill regions, and as they are conspicuous and easy to catch there ought to be no difficulty in getting a complete set of the species of the peninsula.\nA List of the Reptiles of Borneo\u2014Addenda et Corrigenda.*\n\nP. 47.\u2014Brookeia baileyi, Bartlett.\n\nThis species must now be known as Orlitia borneensis, Gray. *O. borneensis* was most incompletely described in 1873, from a very young mounted specimen, collected by Bleeker at Sintang, Dutch Borneo. Boulenger subsequently relegated the species to the genus *Bellia*, since the very immature specimens showed no characters on which to base a sound generic diagnosis. Adult specimens of this same species were later (1895 and 1897) described by Bartlett and Boulenger as *Brookeia baileyi* and *Liemys inornata* respectively. A skull of this tortoise in the Zoological Institute, Munich, was described by Baur in 1895 as *Adelochelys crassa* and referred to the super-family *Chelydroidea*, chiefly characteristic of the New World, and its habitat guessed at as Costa Rica! Finally Schenkel in 1901 suggested that *Brookeia baileyi* and *Bellia borneensis* were conspecific, and pointing out the differences between this species and a typical *Bellia*, revived Gray\u2019s Genus *Orlitia*. I had already pointed out to Mr. Boulenger the identity of his *Liemys inornata* with *Brookeia baileyi*, and recently was able to obtain, through the kindness of Mr. Bailey, of the Sarawak service, a young specimen of this oft-described tortoise; Mr. Boulenger has compared this with the type of *Orlitia borneensis*, itself a young specimen, and in a letter he informs me that the two are identical. The head and entoplastron alone shew that the species is not a *Bellia*, but must occupy a genus by itself, for which the name *Orlitia* has already been provided.\n\n* See this Journal No. 35, pp. 43-68, 1901.\n\nR.

Barnes.\n\nGunong Benom is the name usually given to the \"massif\" which lies in Ulu Pahang in the centre of the triangle the western side of which is formed by the Pahang Trunk Road running from Tranum through Tras and Raub to Kuala Lipis, the Eastern by the Jelai and Pahang rivers running from Kwala Lipis to Kwala Semantan, and the southern by the Tranum-Bentong road and the Bentong and Semantan rivers which latter river joins the Pahang at Kwala Semantan. The name Benom is used by the Malays on the Pahang river but seems unknown at Raub. The mountain is a very conspicuous object from the Raub Rest House. Its height has been fixed trigonometrically by observations from the Perak and Selangor borders at about 6800 feet.\n\nIn July 1900 an experienced mandore Che Musa was sent from Perak by Mr. Young, the present head of the F. M. S. Trigonometrical Survey to erect trigonometrical beacons at this and other points in Pahang. Difficulties having arisen I, in the middle of August undertook the work on Benom. Che Musa was then in Raub having reached what he took to be the top of the mountain and done some clearing there. He had returned for supplies but was unable to get any men to go back with him. With the assistance of Mr. Mason the Asst. District Officer at Raub I managed to collect 17 men on a promise of wages at 70 cents a day and food. The food I had the least hesitation in promising as I knew by experience that a Malay who goes into the jungle on board-wages invariably runs out of stores and has to return for more at the precise moment when work is most pressing and disagreeable. With these men Che Musa went back. On the 29th of August he met me again at Raub and reported that he had built a camp two days\nmarch towards the Mountain and had carried to it half of the trigonometrical beacon and eight tins of rice. I had had all the rice soldered down in clean kerosene tins. The plan answered admirably. Each rice-coohe made a frame work like that of a knapsack on which to lash the tins and fitted it with straps of bark through which to pass his arms and carried in this way five and a half gantangs of rice (roughly the contents of a tin) rode comfortably, no time was wasted in packing and opening bundles, and most important of all\u2014the rice kept perfectly without any of the usual trouble in preserving it from wet.\n\nI was now ready to start and on arranging for my party found that the beacon (it was made of iron) needed a total of 22 men to carry it; more men were of course needed to carry rice for the beacon-carriers; I was very anxious to take sufficient food to last the whole party until the station had been cleared and the beacon fixed. I engaged therefore 32 coolies, all were Malays and but one or two were foreign Malays\u2014Kelantan and Terengganu men. As they assured me that the mountain was infested with peculiarly vicious 'hantu' I engaged a 'pawang' one Wan Putih. He was recommended to me as a powerful exorcist who feared no 'hantu' whatever. In fact he was I was told perhaps a little too rough in the way he dealt with them. The 'pawang' whom Che Musa had taken with him had proved a hopeless failure. My five boatmen also went with me as well as a Malay boy and a Chinese cook. Che Musa completed a party of 42.\n\nWe left Raub on the 31st and stopped the night at Wan Putih's house in Ulu Gali. This though only two or three hours' walk from Raub was the last kampung on the way to the Gunong and to it the other half of the beacon had previously been brought. The afternoon was spent in getting packs, etc., all ready for an early start the next morning. I passed the night under a waterproof sheet; most of the men were accommodated by Wan Putih whose house was, if anything, even filthier than the usual Malay house.\n\nNext morning one man was sick with fever and had to be left behind. Two others were engaged in his place and the whole party with half a trigonometrical beacon, a theodolite,\n\nJour Straits Branch\nA TRIP TO GUNONG BENOM\n\na load of botanical drying paper, my kit and bedding, rice and salt fish for the men and flour and fowls for me started off in good time. The first half of the day's march was easy, the rest up Bukit Numbin and down the other side was hard work for men carrying very inconveniently shaped pieces of angle iron. We camped on a tributary of the Klui which is a tributary of the Dong. The camp was at an elevation of about 1800 feet. Next day Che Musa with one man went back to Ramb for more rice and food stores with instructions to hire men to bring them to Wan Putih's. The rest of us went on to the camp which Che Musa had previously made. Here we found a good 'pondok' and the 8 tins of rice and half the bacon. This camp was on another tributary of the Klui and also about 1800 feet high. The march was a short one. The day after I sent back 19 men to Wan Putih's to bring on the additional stores for which Che Musa had gone together with the balance of the beacon tools and with the rest of the men I went on to the foot of the Gunong, crossing Bukit Palas on the way. We stopped for the night at a point a little over 3100 feet high and as this was (so Che Musa had told me) the last place on the way up where water could be got and as the weather was distinctly unsettled (it had rained every day since we started) I set the men to work to build a good shelter.\n\nOn the third day ten men went back to the previous camp to bring on rice, whilst I went to Che Musa's clearing at the presumed top of the Gunong. To my surprise I found it to be only about 5000 feet high instead of 6800 as it should have been. As however the clearing was small and faced Ramb it was impossible to make out the exact position. Next day I went up again with all the coolies left and started clearing and building a camp, and on the 7th it became obvious that the hill which Che Musa had thought to be the Gunong itself was really a subordinate one three miles away and separated from it by at least five deep valleys. After some consideration I decided to fix the beacon where I was. Looking for the true Gunong with a party of 40 men to feed was obviously out of the question and as the hill on which I was commanded a view of a large number of the main range trigonometrical stations and also much of the Gali and Dong Valleys invisible from the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 38, 1903.\nhighest point I decided that a beacon on it would at all events give some return for the expense incurred.\n\nOn the 8th Che Musa reached the top and by the 11th nearly all the beacon had arrived enabling me to send ten of my party back to Raub there to be paid off. Nearly all of them were sick with fever or otherwise useless for clearing and filling and I was very glad to have fewer men to feed. On the 14th the beacon was erected and on the 15th finally placed in position. By this time food was running short for all hands, and the coolies had got very tired of their job. Three had left without permission thereby forfeiting the greater part of their pay and on the afternoon of the 16th all the rest struck work. The average foreign Malay who comes to Raub to look for work is not a pleasant person with whom to deal, and if he hail from Tringgau as did most of my men did, his respect for a contract is very precisely measured by the ability of the other party to improve it. Luckily I was a Government officer and although my powers were not perhaps quite so extensive as I represented them to be, I succeeded in sufficiently impressing the men to induce them to go to work again late the next morning. I must own that I to some extent sympathised with them. Their work was pretty hard and their food had come down to rice and salt only. Fish sufficient for twice their number they had finished entirely. (My sympathies were sharpened by the fact that my own diet had fallen to bread and condensed milk.) When on the 18th the salt also gave out I found that I ran a risk of being left alone with my boatmen and a good deal more kit than they could carry. On the 20th therefore I started down although two very large trees up which a ladder had been contrived still stood on the side towards the Gunong. These are only noticeable from the Raub Rest House, whither late on the afternoon of the 21st I arrived, the return journey being done in two days.\n\nDuring the whole time between the 7th and the 20th the coolies were felling I was taking a round of theodolite angles and sketching the outlines of the hills in sight. The seeing was rarely good especially towards the north-west and south and trigonometrical stations more than 25 miles away could not have been pitched up without the aid of the powerful telescope which\n\nJour Straits Branch\nI had fortunately borrowed from the Selangor Survey Office. In clear weather the view was very fine. The hill sloped steeply on all sides except towards the Gunong and seemed to rise out of a level plain. On the north in the dim distance above the spurs of the 'massif' were Gunong Tahan and another noticeable peak since identified at Sintung. On the west the main range ran from Perak down to Jelebu with foot hills below it, and a narrow plain leading from Raub southward to the Bentong and Semantau cut up with long ridges of hills separating the various streams. At the foot of the Gunong were the white limestone cliffs of Gunong Serdam with the Gali plain beyond and Raub with the iron-roofed mine buildings sharply picked out and the cable-track showing like a long angled trench. I managed twice to get bearings of Tahan and to sketch the range of which it forms part. The beacon which I erected stands on the highest of these small peaks of about equal height and the clearing round it measures quite five acres.\n\nThe weather was fair only. There was a good deal of rain and on more than one day I never got a single sight. The sun when it shone was very hot and I found that working the theodolite under it meant considerable loss of cuticle from the nose and face. At 8 p.m. the temperature was about 69\u00b0 and at 6 a.m. 62\u00b0. The Malays complained a good deal of the cold although I had provided every man with a blanket. Many of them suffered from chapped lips. My Chinese cook in a blue serge Norfolk suit worn over all his other clothes looked a quaint sight. He never complained however and baked most excellent bread in an empty kerosine tin. A great difficulty was water supply. Every day a water party of five men had to be sent to the last camp nearly 2000 feet down and as the climb was steep and the men out of sight that water party did very little or no other work. Bathing was of course out of the question and washing had frequently to be foregone.\n\nThe 'pawang' was a great nuisance. Naturally he did no work himself and I suppose equally naturally he was of no use at all when the men went on strike. He was one of the most self-righteous natives whom I ever met and though quite illiterate fully equalled many a Koran-quoting haji in conceit. As a 'pawang' he did little except to 'Jampi' a man who was bitten\non the foot by a snake on the hill-top. This poor fellow's leg swelled up badly and as he was an oldish man and got high fever I began to be nervous about him. However either the charms or my remedies brought him round and in a few days he could walk again. Occasionally the 'pawang' thought fit to give us a taste of his quality and usually at inconvenient times.\n\nAt the camp at the foot of the Gunong we heard every night a continuous shrill yelping as of baskets of puppies deserted by their mothers. It was, I think, made by birds though the Malays could give me no name for them. When I asked the 'pawang' he looked mysterious and suggested that the subject should be changed. One night this yelping was very persistent several 'riang-riang' were screeching in the trees, a wind having sprung up the jungle seemed full of noises. I fell asleep but was awakened near midnight by a loud barangue from the 'pawang' to the \"hantu\" of the Gunong. He began mildly by asking why they made such a disturbance, had they forgotten the propitiatory service he had paid before the first tree was felled? Was it fair to go back on him like this? For a while the noise died down and I heard the men expressing their sense of the 'pawang's' power over the spirits. Soon after however it began again and the pawang after more unavailing discourse lost his temper and scolded the hantu in very unrestrained language indeed. This frightened the men and they kept up a chorus of \"Biar-leh,\" \"Jangan-leh,\" \"Nanti dia marah\" until finally the pawang was reluctantly pacified and left the hantu alone.\n\nThen they all began to tell ghost stories. One I remember about Bukit Hitam which is full of getah-taban but on which no getah hantu dare collect owing to the tigers which guard the mountain. One man said that his uncle (a particularly brave man) started once with a large party and as a protection kept a ring of fire round the camp at night. Before morning however a tiger sprang through the flames and carried off the leader. This superstition about Bukit Hitam seems only general. I have heard it both sides of the main ridge. The commonest story about high mountains seems to be that they are inhabited by 'beleh' (maeaus nemestrinus) who increase in size and ferocity the higher the adventurous traveller mounts until at last\n\nJohn Stuart Brown\nthey become as lazy as buffaloes. At this point the traveller always returns believing that they would be as large as elephants further on. On Gunong Raja by-the-by there are chili plants sufficiently gigantic to allow these big 'brok' to perch on their branches.\n\nThe Malay belief in 'hantu' is of course universal but is noticeable that it is always possible to find someone whether a pawang or otherwise who will have them for a consideration. A charming old Chinese tauke at Belat in Kuantan tells a story of how he offered $5 to some Malays to fell a large chingah tree which overhung his kongsi. They refused and said that it was a \"datoh.\" Subsequently they offered to fell it for $10. The tauke's indignant reply was that he would have nothing to do with men who would cut down their grandfather for ten dollars. Why for fifteen you would cut down your father and mother as well! He got over the difficulty by the aid of a large auger half a tin of kerosine and a lighted match. After describing how in a day or two the tree fell its heart completely burnt out, he always ends by saying very scornfully \"Mana hantu?\" As a rule however a Chinaman believes in propitiating the local unseen powers and even this sceptical tauke was seriously considering whether he could not change his luck by engaging a pawang to pay the belated sacrifice of a buffalo to the genius loci of his mine. A Chinaman is perhaps somewhat of a fatalist but he believes in insurance all the same.\n\nAnother superstition which I overheard concerned a cure for skin disease. The pawang was complaining that it was difficult to arrange the marriage of a girl who lived near his house as the poor thing was covered with \"kurap.\" My head-boatman who had noticed the girl, displayed great interest (he was I think contemplating matrimony \u00e0 bonne march\u00e9) and stated that he knew an infallible cure for \"kurap.\" It consisted in an ointment of sulphur and kerosine oil applied in some mysterious manner and it was an essential part of the cure that no living soul should see the patient for seven days after the unction.\n\nAs regards the fauna of the hill, over the very top of the ridge, i.e., 3000 feet high ran a beast-track and on almost the highest point was a quantity of rhinoceros' dung. One night whilst\nwe were on the top an elephant came along this track but was turned back by the fallen trees. It is easy to understand that aborigines walk for choice along the ridges and hills in order to avoid the dense undergrowth in the valleys but why beasts whose weight is calculated in tons should voluntarily carry that weight up hills of really considerable steepness is not so obvious. Do they go along the ridge in order to avoid the sidelong ground of the slopes much of which would give an insecure foothold? In the present case the track seemed to run towards the Gunong itself nearly 2000 feet higher. On the lower ground we saw many tracks of sliding and elephant and heard elephants more than once. Animal life seemed scarce on the hill top. A snake\u2014mutilated beyond recognition before I saw it\u2014was found, also a wood louse and a scorpion. Small bees (lebah) however abounded as on all hill clearings and crawled persistently over one's face and hands. Flies too appeared very quickly and in large numbers. They were in colour a dark metallic blue and in size between a housefly and a blue-bottle. They laid masses of longish white eggs on blankets not actually exposed to bright sunlight. There were also a few white woolly-looking flies of about the same size. None of these insects lived apparently on the spot. They all seemed to appear after the clearing was begun. Whence they came I cannot say. I also saw a few butterflies.\n\nWith the aid of a supply of botanical drying paper lent by Mr. Ridley, the Director of the Botanical Gardens, Singapore, I made a large and, I think, fairly complete collection of all trees, shrubs and plants which were at the time in fruit or flower. Mr. Ridley informs me that the collection reached him in good order and he has made out the appended catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of it. It is in fact as an introduction to this catalogue that these notes have been written. From the nature of the moss upon the hill I should imagine that Benom is much drier than the hill tops on the main range. The commonest trees were \"pagar anak\" bintangor, kelat, rengas manak, mempasi, membungit and palawan, at least those were the names of them given to me by the coolies. The \"rengas manak\" was not I was told poisonous. My Chinese cook however broke out with a bad eruption on his nose and face probably caused by \"rengas\" sap and on the night\n\nJour Straits Branch\nbefore we started down one of the coolies was very badly stung on the body\u2014so badly indeed that he got high fever and could carry nothing and almost had to be carried himself. I saw him about a week later and the eruption was still visible on his chest. Either therefore rengas proper existed on the hill or else \"rengas manak\" is not harmless.\n\nThe palawan trees were a great nuisance. The wood was so hard that the bilong's in the hands of the less expert coolies were badly gapped and I was obliged to order that one exceptionally good man should tackle them all. The tree seemed to me exactly like the palawan so common on river banks.\n\nOn the very top of the hill there was a good deal of \"chandan\" which Mr. Ridley has identified in a paper recently published in the Journal.\n\nThroughout the whole trip I saw no getah, taban, chinga, merbau, petang, or other valuable timber. On the lowest slopes of the hill there were however many fine \"serain\" trees. The whole of the specimens identified by Mr. Ridley were collected on the top of the hill at a height of almost exactly 5000 feet.\n\nThe Benom \"massif\" consists of granite and I noticed that the sedimentary rocks were left behind very soon after leaving the low ground along the foot of the main range; they are found much higher up and in some places places higher than 1000 feet above sea-level. Benom is an isolated granite intrusion without visible igneous connection with the main-range. In the long plain running southward from Raub the ridges which divide the Klan Hilut and Bentong are from their appearance of sedimentary rock. One of them Gunong Raca which overlooks Bentong township is of course conglomerate. This conglomerate is seen also at Jeram Kapur below Bentong. The pebbles in it are as far as I could see, not of igneous rocks but of quartzite and silicified slate. Its strike is a few points West of North and East of South and its dip (apparently) very steep. Similar conglomerates occur in the Tun Jelai. The metamorphic limestone cliffs off Serdam at the foot of Benom seem identical in composition with those at Bukit Chintamanui on the Bentong river and indeed with all the other limestones scattered, mostly in isolated cliffs throughout the Peninsula. In the Jelai river\nthis limestone has recently been shown to reach to a depth of over 300 feet below the present surface. The height at which the old sedimentary rocks remain on the east side of the main range as compared with the west is very noticeable when crossing the range by the Pahang Trunk Road. Further I have walked along the foot of the range the whole way from Tramun southward to the Triang (a tributary of the Pahang which rises in Jelebu) and have not only seen no granite but have found the pebbles in the streams to be mostly of sedimentary rarely of igneous rocks. The rocks over which I passed were all sediments. The bed rock of the Bentong alluvial flat where the mines are worked is uniformly not a bed of china clay as is usual on the western side of the Peninsula but a denuded surface of slates on edge.\n\nI was unable to ascertain the name of the hill on which the beacon is placed. It is certainly not Bukit Palas as I passed over Bukit Palas on my way to it. It may possibly be Kluang Terbang. At places however like Raub where no native seems to go into the more inaccessible jungle, local names are very uncertain.\n\nIf another attempt is made to fix a station on Benom I would strongly advise that another route be chosen. At Raub labour is very expensive and natives with any idea of local topography are nonexistent. Sakai there are none. Personally if I were to try again I should begin by making enquiries as to routes up the Dong or by the Krau, a tributary of the Jelai on the other side of the 'massif.'\n\nList of Plants Collected.\n\n*Illicium verum*, King. Also occurs in Malacca, Selangor and Perak.\n\n*Polygala venenosa*, Juss. var. This is the same plant as that collected by Wray on Gunong Bubu (No. 3813) and distributed under this name by King and is probably the *var. grisea* of Miquel. It is very unlike the ordinary form of the Penang and Perak hills, having a long terminal spike of flowers and not short axillary ones.\n\nJoint Straits Branch\nA TRIP TO GUNONG BENOM.\n\n*Garcinia*, sp. In young fruit, branches grey corky, leaves lanceolate acuminate coriaceous 2 inches long and one and a half broad, petiole half an inch long axillary or supra-axillary few-flowered petals small, stigma discoid grooved. I have never seen this plant from elsewhere.\n\n*Calophyllum* sp. Of this genus there are two species represented; one is perhaps a form of *C. retusum* the other has oblong blunt leaves. None of the specimens have flowers or fruits, but all have the curious bud-galls common to other species of the genus.\n\n*Anneslea crassipes*, Hook. A big tree; specimens with very large fruit; occurs on Mt. Ophir.\n\n*Adinandra maculosa*, Anders. A variety with smaller leaves than usual and glabrous fruit quite ripe.\n\n*Ternstroemia Scortechinii*, King. Also occurs in Perak.\n\n*Gordonia imbricata*, King. A rare plant once collected by Scortechini, in Perak.\n\n*Ternstroemiacea*, a very striking plant apparently belonging to the same order but in fruit only was obtained by Mr. Barnes. It is a tree or shrub with dark colored branches, and coriaceous ovate lanceolate leaves with blunt points 1 inch to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ long $2\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch wide with numerous close nerves and reticulations on the under surface. The upper surface is smooth dark green the under surface yellow when dry and the young leaves are red. The racemes are axillary about one inch long with about ten flowers. The fruit is a capsule on a very short pedicel. With a small rounded bract. The sepals are orbicular imbricate 4 in number, coriaceous with a scarious margin fringed with white hairs, and with three elevated ribs in the centre about $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long. The capule $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long splitting into 4 acute lobes on one of which persists the fairly stout style with an obscurely lobed stigma. There is a persistent column in the centre. The seeds are linear curved not winged two in each cell.\n\nThe flowers have not been obtained, and consequently it is difficult to refer this with any certainty to\nany genus. If as it appears it belongs to the order Ternstroemiaceae, it seems most nearly allied to *Pentaphyllum* of China.\n\n*Pachynoecarpus Stepianus*, King. Leaves elliptic shortly acuminate blunt base slightly acuminate 6 inches long 3 wide smooth with 6 pairs of nerves depressed above dark brown above, beneath grey with prominent nerves and reticulations, petiole stout \u00bd inch long rugose. Panicles crowded compact short red scurfy. Bracts lanceolate scurfy \u00bd inch long. Flowers crowded less than \u00bd inch long red scurfy, calyx and lobes lanceolate obtuse. Petals linear oblong scurfy. Stamens short ovate apiculate. Fruit solitary globose on a stout thickened pedicel, a little over \u00bd inch long, brown rugose, calyx lobes shorter than the whole fruit projecting as short triangular processes.\n\nThis tree was only known from a specimen collected by Scortechini, in fruit. It is very satisfactory to have also the flowers.\n\n*Elaeocarpus rodatus*, Roxb.\n\n*Bauhinia cornifolia*, Bak. Flowers red.\n\n*Backlandia populnea*, R. Br. In flower. The leaves in the specimens are not tricuspid but ovate with three prominent nerves and coriaceous. The petioles and nerves on the back hairy or glabrescent, buds ferruginous hairy, the bracts are narrow as in Miquel's figure, in the Flora of Sumatra.\n\n*Weinmannia Blumei*, Planch. In flower and fruit occurs on all the higher hills. Mt. Ophir, Perak.\n\n*Polyosma loete-virens*, Griff.\n\n*Carallia multiflora*, Miq. From description I take this plant to be Miquel's species collected once in Java by Harfield, the exact locality unknown.\n\n*Rhodamnia trinervia* Bl.\n\n*Tristania meruensis*, Griff. Very characteristic of our higher\n\nJohn Straits Branch\nhills. The wood according to Mr. Barnes is exceedingly hard and broke the edges of the axes in felling.\n\n*Eugenia* sp. Leaves very narrow lanceolate with a very long narrow point blunt, coriaceous dotted above, pale beneath one inch long, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide fruit in short axillary and terminal racemes \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, small tessellate \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long.\n\n*E. subdecussata*, Wall.\n\n*Anerincleistus macranthus*, King.\n\n*Medinilla Clarkei*, King.\n\n*Begonia Herveiana*, King. Rhizome stout often rather long creeping. Leaves when young pink adult dark green, petiole over a foot long, blade ovate acute hardly in equilateral base rounded 6 inches long and 5 wide glabrous. Scape six inches long, lengthening in fruit, male flowers numerous about half an inch across, white outer sepals ovate rounded, inner ones narrower, stamens numerous anthers elliptic blunt not apiculate. Fruit fleshy 3-winged, one wing much larger than the other curved obtuse thick \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, the others much shorter, deluscing along the base of the wing.\n\nBesides this locality, it has been met with in Pulau Tinggi (Feilding) in Jeram Nyalas (Malacca) by Derry (No.1130) and in Bukit Sulu (Negri Sembilan). It is called *assam suzu* by the Malays.\n\n*Argostemma purijolium*, Bemi.\n\n*A. hirtum*, Ridl. also occurs on Mt. Ophir.\n\n*Lucen\u00e6a* sp. Evidently near *L. pentacme* of Stapf from Kinabalu, resembling it in the white bark of the stem and almost nerveless leaves but the peduncle of the head is longer and the bracts at the base are not connate in a cupule as in that species. The only species recorded from the peninsula is *L. Morinda*, Jack. which is common in Singapore. This species is evidently undes-\nscribed but as Sir George King is at present at work on the Rubiaceae and probably has already seen it, I do not give it a name.\n\nTimonius Tambosella, Tha.\n\nCephaelis cuneata var. debilis. A more slender plant than the usual form with smaller narrow lanceolate acuminate leaves 3 to 4 inches long and one inch wide or less, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 1 inch long. In fruit this seems to be a weak form of this species of which the common form often occurs high upon our hills.\n\nLasianthus sp. With lanceolate acuminate leaves strongly reticulate beneath nerves, petioles, and twigs hairy.\n\nArdisia villosa, Roxb.\n\nA. oxyphylla, Wall. A variety with smaller oblong to oblanceolate leaves.\n\nLinociera lancifolia, nsp.

Panicles small an inch long with a pair of broad oblong bracts \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long at the base. Flowers \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long umbellate on the ends of the branches, pedicels \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long, calyx lobes short ovate puberulous, corolla tube very short lobes linear obtuse from a broad base keeled glabrous. Stamens 2 short broad. Style thick shorter than stamens. Drupe cylindric acute.\n\nAlyxia pumila, Hook fil. A form with larger leaves and fruits than usual. Calyx lobes puberulous.\n\nDischidia coccinea, Griff.\n\nHoya sp. near H. parasitica, but with much smaller thinner flowers. I have it also from Gunong Hijau in Perak.\n\nVaccinium bancanum, Miq. A variety with small leaves and fruits.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nA TRIP TO GUNONG BENOM.\n\nV. Teymannii, Miq. var. with branches and petioles and base in midrib beneath covered with black hairs. According to the description the typical form is glabrous. I have obtained it also on Maxwell's Hill, Perak, where it was epiphytic and had pink flowers.\n\nRhododendron Malayanum, Jack.\n\nDiplycoida urceolata, Stapf, var. This differs only from the plant described from Kinabalu in the leaves being ovate lanceolate and rather larger as much as 4 inches long by two wide, instead of obovate. The form of the leaves however seems rather variable. I have also met with it on Bukit Kuta and Bukit Hitam in Selangor. D. macrophylla of Beccari a native of Borneo is as far as description goes similar except in the leaves which more resemble those of the Peninsula plant.\n\nD. lancifolium, nsp. Shrub with rather slender branches with whitish bark upper part setulose, leaves coriaceous lanceolate to ovate lanceolate acuminate, base narrowed to the petiole shining green above. Midrib and two side nerves depressed visible, beneath paler dotted midrib only visible raised. 1\u00bd inch long \u00bc to \u00bd inch wide. Flowers solitary axillary on slender pedicels nearly half an inch long with red setulose bristles. Bracts 2 short ovate pubescent. Calyx campanulate narrowed at the base lobes ovate acute with red hairs, \u00bc inch long. Corolla longer glabrous. Stamens with long points opening by two pores yellow. Style rather long slender.\n\nD. consobrina, Becc. A specimen collected by Mr. Barnes resembles the description of this Bornean plant.\n\nGentiana Koepigii, Wight.\n\nAeschynanthus Hildebrandtii, Hook fil. Also occurs in Perak.\n\nAe sp., possibly a variety of this but with ovate acute leaves, and a bigger plant than I have seen of the species.

A narrow leaved species near *lanigera* but glabrous; in fruit.\n\n*Micropora Curtisi*, Hook fil.\n\n*Wikstroemia candolleana*, Meisn. The Chandan of Pahang. This species is not recorded for our flora in the Flora of British India, but occurs on Gunong Hijau, Kedah Peak, and also at Kampusa in Kelantan. It is a shrub or small tree about 6 to 10 feet tall with smaller flowers than those of *W. indica*.\n\n*Loranthus evenius*, Bl. This beautiful red flowered mistletoe occurs also in Singapore and in Perak.\n\n*L. tetragonus*, Bl. New to the Peninsula.\n\n*Henslowia burifolia*, Bl. Not rare on our hills.\n\n*H. sp.*, near *Lobbiana*. Leaves ovate orbicular 2 inches long by one wide tapering into the petiole which is $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long, nerves five faintly visible on the under surface. Fruits two or three together axillary on pedicels half an inch long, oblong light brown $\\frac{1}{4}$ an inch long, crowned by five short connivent calyx teeth; obscurely five grooved. This is remarkable for the large size and shape of the fruit. I have not seen it elsewhere.\n\n*Balanophora multibrachiata*, Jungh. Also occurs on Mount Ophir.\n\n*Ficus diversifolia*, Bl.

N. Ridley.\nNotes on the Formation of Words in Malay and Cognate Languages.\n\nH. L. E. Luering, Ph. D. (Strassburg).\n\nUnlike the great majority of the better known Oriental languages the vernaculars of the Malayan family have not yet revealed the history of their growth and development. The Semitic, Persian, Indian and Chinese languages have not only preserved very early monuments of literature, which serve as infallible guides to the student, but we can follow their growth from step to step, from antiquity to the present day, without missing, as it were, a single foot-print in all the long journey. In this search for light on the origin and the roots of the language numerous sister-tongues have liberally added their testimony. Arabic literature and living speech step in where Hebrew tradition leaves a breach, and both supplement, and are supplemented by, each other and the Semitic varieties of cuneiform and other inscriptions. So it is also with Sanskrit, ancient Persian and the language of the Zendavesta. I remember very well the time, when owing to the lack of a Persian or Zend Dictionary I had to prepare my lessons in the Avesta and in the inscriptions of Besutan with the help of a Sanskrit Dictionary. This will, at least, show the great benefit philosophically derived from a comparison of cognate languages, even where the modes of writing and the alphabets are radically different.\n\nIn Chinese philology we have not only a literature going back\u2014indirectly if not directly\u2014to great antiquity, but we have also a record of the ancient sounds and signs used at an early date. These together with the comparison of numerous idioms and dialects, enable us to assign what at first appears as a motley of heterogeneous languages to their legitimate mother.\n\nIn the Malayan family of languages we have no ancient monuments of literature, but we have a large variety of tongues, which may all be pressed into service to shed their scant light upon the history of the language. I call their contribut-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1908.\nion scant because the historic element is almost entirely wanting. We have as yet no data as to the time of division of the various branches of this family, though some writers have settled this question to their satisfaction by intuition, without, however, convincing the careful enquirer. Nevertheless the comparison of Malayan languages will lead us a considerable distance towards the solution of the problem of the proto-malayan language. Nor will this task be a very difficult one after the necessary materials for such a work have once been collected.\n\nIn the present paper we will attempt to study, in some of its phases, a more difficult subject, not the original form of words but the formation of words (Wortbildung). We will find not a little agreement in the manner of these formations in widely differentiated languages of this family, and this agreement must necessarily point back to a common source. Such a study, to be on a strictly scientific basis, should start from one of the more unchanged and original languages of the branch, preferably from the Batak (Batta) or one or the other of the Filipino vernaculars, and not from the highly disintegrated and corrupted Malay of the present day.* I have, however, willingly incurred the difficulty and undergone the inconvenience of making Malay the foundation of my remarks, because Malay is a language better known to my readers and consequently of greater interest to them.\n\nThe simplest formation of words of a new meaning in Malay is by\n\nI. REDUPLICATION.\n\nHerein and in the use of \"classifiers\" or numeral co-efficients the Malay family of languages is related both to the Chinese (Mongolian) and the Papuan languages. Let us en-\n\n*This must not be understood as in any sense disparaging to the usefulness and importance of the language. Malay has bought its popularity as a medium of speech over so vast a territory at the same price at which English has acquired its world wide sway; Grammatical finesse and linguistically interesting forms have been lost in equal proportion as the language has affected larger circles of population.\n\nJour Straits Branch\nTHE FORMATION OF WORDS.\n\ndeavour to classify the varieties of the meanings designated by simple reduplications.\n\n1. Specialization and differentiation.\n\nI believe that I place myself in opposition to every grammarian, who has written on Malay, by denying that reduplication is one of the modes of expressing the plural. I will not make any superfluous quotations, but in half a dozen grammars which lie before me, I find it stated that this is one of the plural formations, though in almost every case, the said grammarians find it impossible to state why the word should be reduplicated, as already the single word implies the plural, and why even the reduplication should be joined together with the adjective segala which is universally accepted as indicating the plural. A few careful grammarians have noted the fact that only few words can form plurals by means of a reduplication. This observation should have led them to a correct understanding of the meaning of such alleged plurals. The universal paradigma of this \"plural\" in grammars is raja-raja. It is well known that raja alone can mean \"kings;\" now if raja-raja should be used to avoid ambiguity, or to distinguish it from a possible singular \"king,\" why should in almost every case segala be added: segala raja-raja, where the translation \"all the kings\" or \"all kings\" is quite out of the question?\n\nIn accordance with other Malayan languages, including the Malagasy, I explain the reduplication as intended to specialize the sense of the word. A careful study of Malay literature, aside of any other language, might have led to a correct understanding of the expression. Take for example the ever-recurring phrase in Malay court novels:\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1908.\ndi-badap oleh segala raja-raja dan mentri, hulubalang serta bidu-\nandu sekutun (Isma Yatin, passim). Not once in this frequent phrase another of the nouns occurring in it, which are all plurals, is found in reduplication, such as mentri-mentri, hulubalang-hulubalang, biduanda-biduanda, while raja is always reduplicated. The heading of this paragraph will supply the explanation of the difference. While the other nouns denote certain offices or ranks, the members of which are equals among themselves, all being ministers or officers of the body-guard, or pages, the title \"raja\" includes all princes of royal blood (usually below the rank of tengku and engku), inclusive of that large class of attendants at court, who by some however distant blood relation with the ruling prince are thereby differentiated from outsiders. It cannot be denied that there is the greatest variation in rank included under this title, and this the Malay writer and speaker expresses by the reduplication. We may translate the phrase therefore: \"(The prince) waited upon by the various classes of Rajas, and the ministers, officers of the body-guard and the pages together.\"\n\nIf there should be yet a reluctance in giving up the long accepted view of seeing in these reduplications proper plurals in our sense of the word, I would refer the reader to those of the Malay classics, which, like the Bustanu's salatin*, the Tajju's salatin, and of more modern works, the Taman Pernata, are largely made up of Arabic quotations with their Malay translations. It is a very easy task to compare these translations with the Arabic originals, and it will be seen, that in every case where the Arabic plural is at all expressed in Malay, it is done by segala. Passages like these are of great interest to the student of the language, because they are the only\n\n*The Bustanu's salatin is one of the most interesting of all Malay works, especially as it is dated. It was written in Aceh, Sumatra, in 1641 (1050 of the Muhammedan era) by Nuruddin ibn Ali ibn Hasanji ibn Muhammad al Hamidi (the author is very careful in giving so much of his pedigree) under the patronage of Sultan Iskandar II. Of the seven volumes the first two have been published by R J Wilkinson in 1899 and 1900. I possess a MS copy of the seventh volume. The work deserves the careful study of all somewhat advanced students of the language.\n\nJen Straits Branch\nauthentic commentaries, giving us the exact meaning of the idiom of the writer, supposing however that he fully understood the Arabic of his quotation, which is highly probable in the majority of cases.\n\nThe \"specialization\" expressed by reduplication leads us to another closely connected meaning, which I do not hesitate to place under the same heading. To start from the same expression \u0631\u0627\u062c\u060c raja-raja, we have found that it cannot be translated \"kings,\" but that the meaning of raja has been specialized as meaning something not exactly a king, but only similar to one. This is a kind of specialization very frequent in Malayan languages. Of the large number of examples I can only quote a small portion, which will, however, fully suffice to explain the rule.\n\n\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0628\u0629\u064c lanjut-lanjut, a sky yet not a sky: a baldachin;\n\n\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0629\u064c buat-buat, to do, yet not to do: to pretend:\n\n\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0631\u064c ular-ular, a snake, yet not a snake: a streamer, pennon:\n\n\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0645\u064c ayam-ayam, a hen, yet not hen: a waterfowl:\n\n\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064c jarum-jarum, a needle, yet not a needle, the needle of a balance.\n\nIn the same way \u0641\u0648\u062a\u064a\u0647\u064c putih-putih means whitish, not white, \u0628\u064a\u0631\u064c biru-biru bluish, not blue, \u0645\u0627\u0633\u0643\u064c masak-masak to play at cooking, not to cook, \u0627\u0646\u0642\u064c anak-anak a doll, not a child. \u0627\u0628\u064a\u064c api-api, the mistletoe, which causes trees infested by it to have the appearance as if burnt by fire (api). Here it is also worthy of note that in order to express \"flaming\" anger or wrath the reduplication \u0628\u0631\u0641\u064a\u064c berapi-api is used,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nwhile the proper word when speaking of natural flames would be \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a berapi.\n\nTo this class belong expressions such as\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u063a parang, long knife, \u0641\u0627\u0631\u063a parang-parang, a fish resembling it. \u0641\u0627\u0631\u064a pari, rayfish, \u0641\u0627\u0631\u064a pari-puri, a ring of rotan resembling in shape that of the ray.\n\nMany words are now found in reduplications only, which may possibly belong to the same class, though we have no means at hand to prove it. Such words are kanak-kanak, sida-sida and many others, while in many cases references to other languages help us to place the words under this group. Such a word is laki-laki, manhood, courage, male, brave, which comes from laki, strong, great (so in Tagalog, in Malagasy: lehy). In Malay the single word signifies the \"stronger,\" but not the \"better\" half, the husband.\n\nI now append a short list of reduplications from cognate languages, which will show that in this respect the greatest similarity exists.\n\nReduplications expressing similarity not identity are in\n\nMalagasy:\n\nlahy, husband, lehilahy, man, male;\nvahy, wife, vehivahy, woman, female;\nsala, wrong, salasala, doubtful;\nfotsy, white, fotsyfotsy, whitish;\n\nBatak:\n\nlahi, husband, lahilahi, male, man;\nboru, daughter, boruboru, female, woman;\nTHE FORMATION OF WORDS.\n\nTagalog:\n\nputi, white, puti-puti, semen, sperma;\n\nI refrain from further illustrating the use of these reduplications by examples, as this would encroach too much upon the space at my disposal.\n\n2. Emphasis and repetition. The second meaning expressed by reduplication is emphasis and repetition. This is so common in almost all languages that it is not necessary to go into many details, especially as no radical change of meaning is effected by such reduplication. I select the following examples:\n\nhabis-habis, completely finished;\nharap-harap, to hope fervently;\nbulat-bulat (also in Tagalog) all, most sincere;\nlama-lama, for ever so long;\nlain-lain, (also in Tagalog) altogether different;\nendah-endah, very beautiful;\ntambah-tambah, to add repeatedly;\ndua-dua, by two and twos, etc., etc.\n\nIt may suffice to say here that this sort of reduplication is found in Tagalog, Batak, Malagasy and every other Malayan language.\n\nReduplications, which are combined with secondary changes of form do not interest us here, where we are treating merely of the reduplication of primitive words.\n\nWith regard to partial reduplication, such as\n\nlaki-laki; beside laki-laki,\nparu-paru; beside paru-paru,\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nTHE FORMATION OF WORDS.\n\ntetampan beside tampan-tampan,\njejamban beside jamban-jamban,\njejenang beside jenang-jenang\nbebram beside bram-bram,\n\nno special mention need be made, but that they are found in various Malay languages, (cf. Tagalog lalaki, male) and that they all belong to the first group of reduplications, those that express specialization and differentiation.\n\nII. ANCIENT VOCATIVE FORMS.\n\nIt may sound very much out of place to speak, in a language like Malay, which has neither declension nor conjugation, of a vocative case. Nor do I wish to imply, by the use of the expression, that the language has ever had a declension. Such a supposition appears to me altogether at variance with the genius of the Malay language. But there is no doubt, that in several of the languages of this family we find a peculiar change of form in words used in the address of persons, which may well be designated as vocatives, and this has been repeatedly done by careful grammarians. It cannot be denied that a considerable number of these expressions, to be presently mentioned, have already lost their distinctly vocative character in Malay, while some forms are losing their character more and more. It may be said that, with one or two exceptions, the forms mentioned here, having yet a distinctive vocative meaning, belong to the language of the past and are preserved almost exclusively in court language or in the poetic style.\n\nHere is a list of the commoner of these expressions:\n\nanang, oh child! from anak;\nading, oh younger brother! from adek;\nbapang, oh father! from bapa;\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nTHE FORMATION OF WORDS.\n\nembong, eldest child! from embok;\nindong, mother! from indok;\nachang, boy! messenger!\n\nI add to these vocative forms words like the following:\nabang, elder brother; inang, nurse (see examples from Batak below); dayang, maid; ang, hang, as pronouns of the second person; sulong, eldest son; and with some diffidence I add the ancient names of divinities: yang and sang. All these words have distinct vocative forms, though they may have lost the vocative meaning, for it is easily seen, how these words, constantly used in the vocative, finally had to do duty for other cases also.\n\nWe have forms corresponding exactly to these in Batak, and here in fullest every day use. I mention only the following:\namang, from ama, father!\nindang, from ina, mother! (see inang in Malay):\nomping, from ompu, grandfather!\nkahang, from kaha, elder brother or sister! (see Malay kakak);\nitong, from ito, elder brother! etc.\n\nThe only expression denoting close relationship in Batak, which has no vocative form in use is anygi, younger brother, though even this word becomes anyging, when used in intercourse with younger friends, not brothers, just as itong (from ito) and ibotong is used as an address to elder friends.\n\nIn Malagasy all forms ending in ng have been changed, and this is the reason, I believe, why we have no formal vocatives. The case of address is expressed as in modern Malay, by particles of exclamation.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1883.\nIn Tagalog, and this opinion is strengthened by the same tendency mentioned above of Malay, the vocative has gradually gained ascendancy over the other cases, so that all nouns and adjectives and pronouns add to their vocalic ending (also to final n) the ending of the old vocative. So we have throughout the language.\n\ninang, mother, from ina;\namang, father, from ama;\npanginoong, master, lord, from panginoon. In order, therefore to distinguish the proper vocative it is necessary to add the particle of exclamation oy or ay, which corresponds to the Malay hei or hai.\n\nIII. ANCIENT ADJECTIVE FORMS.\n\nLexicographers, rather than grammarians, have noted the existence in Malay of some hitherto unexplained parallel forms, such as:\n\nmalang beside alang;\nmasing beside asing;\nmasam beside asam;\nmasin beside asin (cf. Tagalog ma-asin),\nmalap beside alap\n\nAn opinion regarding these forms, that they may be introductions from the Javanese, is disproved on closer investigation.\n\nBy comparison with other Malayan languages, however, we learn beyond doubt, that we possess in these and a few other expressions highly interesting adjective forms. The need, in Malay, of a special form for adjectives must have certainly been felt, especially as the common forms used by us in that sense are indistinguishable from nouns. Though custom has given, to mention but one example, to besar the meaning of the adjective \"great, large,\" it must not be forgotten that in very many uses of the word it is a distinct noun. Take the following sentences:\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIn these sentences we have besar (size), lebar (breadth), panjang (length), and tinggi (height) absolutely parallel with the Arabic noun 'omor (age). The substantive use of these \"adjectives\" is certainly the more original, and even now the more idiomatic.\n\nThe ancient adjectives were formed from these \"roots\" by prefixing the syllable ma-. Such forms are in constant use in Tagalog, the languages of Borneo, Batak and Malagasy, as we will show by numerous examples, which might be increased almost ad libitum. They must have been used to a much larger extent even in historical Malay, and we should expect to find some remnants of this use in geographical names, where antiquities are much more likely to remain unchanged. It would be worth the labour of a student to make careful lists of Malay geographical names, laying stress upon peculiar expressions, and seeing that modern corruptions (in the mouth of Tamils, Chinese and foreign Malays) be eliminated. I will mention but one name belonging to this group. In the Province Wellesley we find the name of a hill and an adjacent town, usually spelled Bukit Mentajam. The latter word is a corruption of matujum, which means \"sharp, pointed,\" Batak ma-tajum, and the name \"pointed hill\" is quite in accordance with the character of the elevation.*\n\nIn Batak a careful distinction is maintained in the use of the simple root and that of the adjectival form with the prefix.\n\nThe latter is only used as a predicate, never as a qualifying adjective. The sentence \"Ma-timbo hagu on\" means: this tree is high, while the expression \"this high tree\" is rendered by \"hagu na timbo on,\" i.e., this tree which possesses height, which is high, this high tree. Other words belonging to this class are:\n\n*It is possible that the very word Malaya comes under this rubric. No previous explanation of the term has found general acceptation. The Tagalog \"malayo\" means \"far, distant, strange, stranger,\" certainly a very suitable appellation for the roving strangers that settled in the archipelago.\n\nE.A.Soc., No. 39, 1883\nTHE FORMATION OF WORDS.\n\nmavara, from rara, red (Malay \u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062d\u064e merah);\nmalemba, from lembea, faint, (Malay \u0644\u0650\u0645\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e lembeh);\nmamora, from mora, rich (Malay \u0645\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064e murah);\nmapitung, from pitung, blind.\n\nIn Malagasy we have forms like:\nmaludy, quick, manitra, fragrant, malaza, clever, renowned,\nmalama, slippery, smooth, malemy, soft, tender (Malay \u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064e lemah), maloto, filthy, dirty, marina, just, righteous,\nmahitay, straight, masina, holy, mainty, black (Malay hitam, Dusun meitam, Tag. maitim).\n\nIn Tagalog we find:\nma-itim, from itim, black, Malay \u0647\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e hitam;\nma-lalim, from lalim, deep, Malay \u062f\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e dalam;\nma-lambot, from lambot, soft, kind, Malay \u0644\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062a\u064e lembot;\nma-lapar(d), from lapar(d), hungry, Malay \u0644\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064e lapar;\nma-laki, from laki, strong, great, Malay \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e\u064a\u064e laki;\nma-hina, from hina, weak, mean, Malay \u0647\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 hina;\nma-lakas, from lakas, swift, strong, Malay \u0644\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0633\u064e lekas;\nma-sakit, from sakit, sick, painful, Malay \u0633\u064e\u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064e sakit;\nma-puti, from puti, white, Malay \u067e\u064f\u0648\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0651\u0647\u064e putih.\n\nThe Dusun language of Borneo presents among others these examples: See Journal R.

ANCIENT VERBAL FORMS.\n\nIn the formation of verbs, where the modern Malay has effected the greatest change and simplification, we find nevertheless numerous traces of antiquity, of which the Malay has almost or altogether forgotten the original connection.\n\n1. Let me first refer the reader to pairs of words like the following.\n\n\u06af\u0631\u06af\u0631 getar, to tremble. \u06af\u0645\u06af\u0645 gemetar, to tremble vehemently:\n\u06af\u0631\u062a\u06af\u0631\u062a gertak, to spur on. \u06af\u0645\u0631\u06af\u0645\u0631 gemertak, to frighten with weapons;\n\n\u06af\u0648\u0644\u06af\u0648\u0644 gulong, to roll up. \u06af\u0645\u0648\u0644\u06af\u0645 gemuloug, rolled up and twisted;\n\u06af\u06cc\u0644\u06af\u06cc\u0644 gilang, to glisten. \u06af\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06af\u0645 gemilang, very glistening;\n\u06af\u06cc\u0644\u06af\u06cc\u0644 gilap, to glisten. \u06af\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06af\u0645 gemilap, very glistening;\n\u06af\u0644\u06af\u0644 gelatok, to tremble. \u06af\u0645\u0626\u0644\u06af\u0645 gemelutok, to tremble violently;\n\u06af\u0644\u06af\u0644\u06af\u0644 geleget, to tremble. \u06af\u0645\u0626\u0644\u06af\u0645 gemelegut, to tremble violently;\n\u06af\u0648\u0631\u06af\u0648\u0631 turun, to descend. \u06af\u0645\u0626\u0631\u06af\u0645 temurun, farther descent;\n\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06af trang, light. \u06af\u0645\u0626\u0631\u06af\u0645 temarang, half-light, glooming;\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1902.\ntabor, to scatter, temabor, to scatter everywhere;\nchuram, steep, chemuram, declivity;\nlukut and lemukut, to pound parched grain;\ncherlang and chemerlang, to glitter, glisten;\nguroh and gemuroh, thunder, rolling noise;\ntandang and temandang, outfit, get-up;\ntali and temali, twisted cordage;\nand perhaps the following:\ntebok and tembok, perforated;\ntebat, and tambat, tied up;\ntanggong, to bear temenggong, dignitary.\n\nIn many cases the similar sense of the two words will invite an association between them, but this does not provide us with a grammatical explanation of the second form.\n\nWe have here forms of a conjugation, which in Batak Grammar has been designated as the Fourth, in Tagalog as the First Conjugation. It is formed by infixing into the verbal stem, after the initial consonant the syllable -um- (or, which does not concern us here, if the root commences with a vowel or labial letter, by prefixing the syllable um-). In the first case, -um- is called an infix, in the latter a prefix. Here are a few of the many examples which might be adduced:\n\nMalay: surat,\nBatak: sulat, sumulat, to write\nTagalog: Jour. Straits Branch\nsurut, surut, sumurut, to withdraw, to bend back.\n\nubah, uba, umuba, ubo, umubo, to change.\n\nIt will be seen that but for the fact that in Malay the vowel sign of the conjugation has weakened, being depressed from u to \u016b or \u0113, the above mentioned Malay forms fully correspond to the Batak and Tagalog forms. Such a slight change is nothing improbable, yet we need not indulge in conjectures in the face of even so slight a change, for we find most of the original forms preserved in Malay dialects, e.g. gilaug-gumilang, gilap-gumilap, gelatok-gumelatok, turon-tumuron, churum-chumuram, lukut-lumukut, yuroh-gumuroh, etc.\n\nEven in the classes of verbs, which are conjugated according to this paradigma, the closest agreement exists. They are mostly verbs denoting visible motion, trembling, (See Malay: gemetar, gemelatok, gemelegut, etc.), and verbs, to whom this conjugation gives the power of \"intensiva\" (compare Malay gemetar, gemertak, gemilang, gemilap, gemelatok, gemelegut, temabor, etc.)\n\n2. We will now notice another class of verbal formations which also appear to be a remnant of a now obsolete conjugation. The examples given below do not exhaust the large stock preserved in the language, but are merely chosen to illustrate the existence of the conjugation, while many other words doubtlessly belong to this class, though their radicals have been lost to the Malay vocabulary.\n\ntekan, to press with the hand; telekan, to lean on the outstretched and stiffened arm;\n\ntekap, to press softly with the hand; telekap, to brush away with the hand;\n\ntingkah, character; telingkah, to be of different character, to collide;\ntapak, and telapak, foot-print;\ntepok, to pat, telepok, to tap softly, as in applying specks of gold and silver flocks upon paper or cloth;\ntempop, and telemop, to lay the hand flatly on, to measure by hand's breadths;\nchupar, and chelupar, to babble incessantly;\nsaput, to cover with clouds, selaput, to cover densely etc., or closely;\nsempang, to go off side-wards, selempang, to jump sideways;\nsampai, to hang clothes, selampai, to wear over both shoulders, like a shawl;\nsandang, to tie sideways, selendang, to wear sideways over one shoulder;\nsudang, and seludang; to decorate with flowers in a peculiar manner;\nsidik, and selidik to examine closely;\nsisih, and selish, to quarrel, dispute;\ngosok, and gelosok, to rub;\n\nJour.

It is a conjugation which corresponds to the Tenth conjugation of Batak Grammar, and is formed by the infix -al- and another verbal infix or prefix. While there exist in Batak four different classes of these verbs, according to the difference of the infix or prefix combined with the characteristic of the conjugation -al-, the Malay seems to have preserved none but forms which combine the commonest of all verbal prefixes, me-, men-, meng-, mem- or meny- with the infix -al-. I know of no similar formations in Malagasy and Tagalog, though they might possibly be found after a more careful search, perhaps in a slightly varied form, in one or the other of the Philippine languages. I will, however, for comparison, subjoin one or two examples from Batak:\n\nmangk-at-aputi, to do hastily (from haput);\nmand-at-ate, to be open (as country without jungle);\nmand-at-ute, man-at-ute, to glide swiftly along (as a boat under sail).\n\n3. Before closing my remarks on the ancient forms of conjugation in Malay, it is necessary at least to mention the most common of all verbal changes, the one which in Malay has superseded all the rest. I refer to the one marked by the prefix: me-, men-, meng-, mem- or meny-, all of which are really the same, modified slightly by combination with the initial consonants or vowels of the verbs. This conjugation is\nfound in all Malayan languages, as the following examples will show. By selecting Tagalog, Batak, and Malagasy verbs, which are also found in Malay, it becomes unnecessary to select a separate list of Malay examples.\n\n**Tagalog:**\n\n- *mang-aral (arul)* to teach, preach, Malay *mengajur*;\n- *man-ubus (tubus)* to redeem, Malay *menebus*;\n- *man-uti (puti)* to whiten, Malay *memutih*;\n- *man-ulat (sulat)* to write, Malay *menyurat*.\n\n**Batak:**\n\n- *mang-handang (handang)*, to fence, Malay *mengandang (kandang)*;\n- *mang-embang (hembang)*, to spread out, Malay *mengembang (kembang)*;\n- *man-urat (surat)*, to write, Malay *menyurat (surat)*;\n- *man-unu (bunu)*, to kill, Malay *membunuh (bunuh)*;\n- *man-obus (tobus)*, to redeem, Malay *menebus (tebus)*.\n\n**Malagasy:**\n\n- *man-enona (tenona)*, to weave, Malay *menenun (tenun)*;\n- *man-ampana (sampana)*, to separate, Malay *menyempang (sempang)*;\n- *man-dalo (lulo)*, to pass by, Malay *melalu (lalu)*;\n- *man-doa (loa)*, to spit, Malay *meludah (ludah)*;\n- *man-eno (feno)*, to fill, Malay *memenoh (penoh)*;\n- *man-otsy (fotsy)*, to whiten, Malay *memutih (putih)*;\n- *man-ono (rono)*, to kill, Malay *membunuh (bunuh)*;\n- *man-irakira (ki akira)*, to finger, to count, Malay *mengira-ira, (kira-kira)*.\n\nThe writer of these fragmentary notes on Malay Grammar trusts that his readers will excuse the many imperfections of this article. Though the subject treated in these pages has occupied the interest of the writer for a considerable time, the actual writing was done under great inconveniences, in the spare moments of a very busy period, and without the advantage of a large library close at hand. He should, however, feel well repaid for having undertaken the task, if by his attempt others would be encouraged in taking up this inviting subject.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nThe Sakai and Semang Languages in the Malay Peninsula and their relation to the Mon-Khmer Languages.\n\nBy P. W. Schmidt, S. V. D.\n\nReviewed by W. D. Barnes.\n\nIn the third and fourth numbers of the eighth part of the sixth series of the Bijdragen tot Taal-Land-en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsche-Indi\u00eb, published in 1901, is a paper by P. W. Schmidt, S.V.D., written in German with the title \"Die Sprachen der Sakai und Semang auf Malacca und ihr Verh\u00e4ltniss zu den Mon-Khmer-Sprachen.\" The following abstract of it will I think, have great interest for readers of the Journal.\n\nThe author begins his introduction as follows:\n\n\"More important than these connections with the Anamite language are the undeniable relations of our monosyllabic Khasi-Mon-Khmer root-stock with the Kohl language with that of Nancowry and with the dialects of the aborigines of the Malay Peninsula. We should not however be justified in deducing therefrom an ancestral connection with these partly polysyllabic languages.\" So wrote E. Kuhn towards the end of his 'Articles on the languages of Further India' Beitr\u00e4ge zur Sprachentunde Hinterindiens. Sitzung d. k. bayer. ac. d. w. phil.-hist. LL 1899 l. p. 219 f.f.) Thus he leaves open the question whether there exists between the Khasi-Mon-Khmer group and the Kohl languages, that of Nancowry and the dialects of the aborigines of the Malay Peninsula, an intimate actual relationship, or whether the evident identities are due merely to external influences.\n\nSome years later\u20141834\u2014E. (sic.) Otto Blagden in the Journal of the Straits Branch 27 pages 21-56, without apparently knowing anything of Kuhn's work put forward a more\ncomplete comparison of the Vocabulary of the dialects\nof the Peninsula aborigines with that of the Mon-Khmer\n(Anam) languages. But as his title \"Early Indo-Chinese in-\nfluences in the Malay Peninsula, as illustrated by some of\nthe Dialects of the Aboriginal Tribes\" shows, Blagden also\ndid not go so far as to conclude that the identities to which\nhe drew attention arose from any intimate connection between\nthe two groups of languages. He says, 'But even to assume\nthat the aboriginal dialects are cognate languages which should\nbe classified in the Mon-Annam family would be going further\nthan our evidence justifies us in doing.' Neither Blagden nor\nKuhn had examined the whole material which is available on\nthe subject of these aboriginal dialects. It is my purpose to\ncollate this full material and to endeavour by its aid to remove\nthe present uncertainty concerning these dialects and to settle\ntheir genealogical relation beyond doubt. For this purpose\nit is first necessary to settle the relationships of these dialects\nto one another, a task which in itself demands much labour\nsince no comprehensive work has been done on the subject.\nThe first half of my paper will comprise this comparison, and\nthe comparison of the aboriginal dialects with the Mon-\nKhmer languages will occupy the second half.\n\nHis first part the author begins with a list of publications in\nwhich words, vocabularies, etc., from the aboriginal dialects have\nbeen given.

The author explains that it is possible that in some cases further enquiry or rather fuller material for enquiry may show that some of his roots may require correction, but contends that for his purpose the arrangement adopted is the most useful one. All hypothetical root-forms are enclosed in brackets. All Malay loan-words are omitted.\n\nNext follow the only available texts viz.\u2014those given by Skeat in Berisi by Clifford in Sen-oi and by de Morgan in Sakai of S. Kerbon and S. Raya, and in 'Somang.' The translations are given in each case.\n\nThe next thirty pages contain a discussion of the 'Grammatik.'\n\nThe fourth subsection of the first part is headed 'The relation of the dialects to one another.' The author begins as follows:\u2014 \"The questions as to the relation of these languages to one another and to their correct grouping are the more important since the races who speak them have no ethnological unity. The Sakai although sharply distinguished from Mongolian races have a more Mongoloid character than have the Semang. The Semang on the other hand belong as even B. H. Meyer's very critical examination shows, to the Negrito. Our examination has therefore a further meaning in that it aids in answering the question whether these Semang-Negritos have a language of their own.\" In the next nine pages the author examines in detail the similarities and differences in the vocabularies of the various dialects and concludes that, as far as the present state of our knowledge allows us to judge, the Sakai and Semang languages are one. He then points out the two marked groups into which this one language falls. In the one group come the words, etc., collected from 'Quedah-Semang' Semang of Tjoh. Steven's Semang, Semang of Ulu Selama, Mukonbo-Machay's Ulu Kelantan and Ulu Petani, Tomlin's Semang 'Jooroo-Semang,' in the other words, etc., collected from Bersisi, Palou, Ulu Indau, Sakai of Sungai Raya, Clifford's Sen-oi, Sakai of J. Kerbon, Somang of de Morgan, Clifford's Tembe, Perak Semang and Chanderiang Sakai.\n\nThe author now points out that it is not safe to believe that collectors of vocabularies who have called certain races\nSakais or Semangs have in all cases correctly described them. He therefore tests these statements by the locality, physical peculiarities, etc., of the tribes in question. He points out that Semangs do not exist in the southern part of the peninsula and quotes R. Martin who gives as their country northern Perak, Kedah, Rahman, Rangan, and Kelantan, a description with which Stevens agrees. He further notes that the Semang use or have used the bow, and that there is no record of the Sakais having done so. He concludes that the Semangs in his first group are correctly described but that de Morgan's 'Somai' and the 'Perak Semangs,' and 'Kenning Semangs' mentioned in fifth volume of the J. S. B. R. A. S. may very possibly have been Sakais or at all events mixed races. The Sakai who form his second group fall linguistically into two sub-classes the divisions between which seem to be confirmed geographically by Clifford's line from Biania on the Perak River to the Bidor Mountains and thence to Kuala Angin in Kelantan to the north of which line Clifford found his Tem-be to the south his Sen-oi. He concludes therefore that the Semang and Sakai form two different branches of one language and that the Sakai branch shows two sub-branches.\n\nThe second part is headed 'comparison of the Sakai and Semang languages' and opens with a list of books consulted by the author in his study of the latter. Then follows a list of those Mon-Khmer words and roots which are found to be similar to words and roots in Sakai and Semang. The author's comments on this are as follows:\u2014\"The above agreements seems to me to be amply sufficient both in number and kind to negative the suggestion of 'A mere external borrowing.' As to the their number out of the 1249 forms contained in the vocabulary there are about 240 such agreements. That is in itself a notable result but it gains in meaning when two things are borne in mind.\u2014First that most undoubtedly a part at least of the materials for the Sakai and Semang languages are recorded with a wrong or uncertain meaning thus rendering it difficult or even impossible to find their correct equivalents in Mon-Khmer, and secondly that another part,\u2014more specially that collected by de Morgan and Stevens, is of such a nature (names of implements and individual parts of them, of individ-\n\"The Sakai and Semang Dialects.\"\n\n\"ual plants, etc.,) that in any case corresponding expressions\nfor them could hardly be expected. Finally it must be pointed\nout that in these prefix-languages it is most difficult to find\ncorresponding words in dictionaries which are arranged al-\nphabetically according to the initial letters of the words, and\nthat our vocabularies of a part at least of the Mon-Khmer\nlanguages are by no means complete.\"\n\nThe words showing similarity are next arranged in groups as\nfollows: Nouns: 18 such as God, Thunder, Night, Rain, Stone,\nFire, etc.; 8 such as Tree, Flower, Rice; 21 such as Louse, Fly,\nEgr., Dog, Elephant, Rhinoceros, etc.; 18 such as Man, Stranger,\nWife, Aunt, Nephew, etc.; 33 such as Blood, Hair, Mouth, Neck,\nBelly, Elbow, etc.; and 13 such as Clothing, Arrow, Knife, Stick,\netc.: Verbs: 61 including to go, give, sleep, fasten, see, sit, turn back,\ncry, call, speak, drink, etc.; and 33 Adjectives and Adverbs such as\nmany, white, with, bad, sweet, cold, etc. The author continues:\n\n\"The comprehensive manner in which all kinds of correspondences\nare represented and more especially in which the names for\nalmost all parts of the human body show agreement and finally\nthe large number of indentities in verbs and adjectives leave,\nin so far as an examination of the grammatical relations of the\ntwo groups of languages offers no obstacle, one conclusion\nonly, viz.\u2014that there exists an inward and intimate condition\nbetween the Sakai and Semang languages and those of the Mon-\nKhmer.\"\n\nThe author next points out that there is a small number of\nwords occurring in many Sakai and Semang dialects for which no\ncorresponding words can be found in Mon-Khmer, but he asserts\nthat the existence of these can not disturb the conclusion drawn\nfrom the total result more especially as further search in the\nmore out-of-the way dialects of Mon-Khmer may yet reveal them.\n\nHe then continues:\u2014\"As against these however great stress must\nbe laid on the part that for those particular words which con-\nstitute the difference between Semang and Sakai no parallels\ncan be found. If therefore we can rely upon our knowledge\nof the Mon-Khmer vocabulary it is very remarkable that it is\nthese words and these (so to speak) alone which fail us.\nWhen further we bear in mind that the words in question are\nsuch as are in constant use in every day life it seems most im-\n\nA Soc., No. 39, 1909\nprobable that their parallels will be found in these Mon-Khmer languages of which we have at present any knowledge and it may be regarded as very doubtful indeed if any entirely new branch of these languages will be discovered which will supply the deficiencies. It seems therefore very probable that we have in these words a remnant of the former Semang-Negrito-language. If that is really the case then further and more exhaustive research will certainly reveal still more material of the same kind. May this be a keen incentive to those who are in a position to make such researches to commence them without delay before the rapidly advancing disappearance of these races render further proof ever impossible! Perhaps we may be able to oppose some positive facts to that wave of theories which has burst over these poor Negritoess.\n\nThe next eighteen pages are occupied with a close comparison of the \"Grammatik\" of the two groups. The following conclusions are drawn:\n\n(i) The sounds are in essentials the same.\n(ii) The word-formation follows the same laws.\n(iii) The personal pronoun shows as much identity as can be expected.\n(iv) Pronouns and adverbs are in essentials demonstratively the same.\n(v) The syntactical relations of nouns, adjectives and verbs are the same.\n(vi) The numeral is the same in form and construction.\n\nThe author continues\u2014\"Against these resemblances and identities no important divergencies are as yet opposed. When we consider them in conjunction with the widespread identities in the vocabulary we are justified in concluding that the Sakai and Semang languages are intimately related with the Mon-Khmer languages and must be regarded as a member of that family. In the case of the Sakai languages this conclusion can be pushed further. When we consider the physical resemblances between the Sakai and the Mon-Khmer peoples we are justified in saying that the language now spoken by the Sakai was the original Sakai language.\"\n\nThe author then gives the following four physical characteristics of the Mon-Khmer people:\u2014\nTHE SAKAI AND SEMANG DIALECTS.\n\n(i) Dolicho-cephalic skulls.\n(ii) Darkish skins.\n(iii) Eyes horizontal not oblique.\n(iv) Hair wavy not straight and not woolly; and he quotes R. Martin and Logan as proving that the Sakai have the same peculiarities.\n\nHe continues:\u2014\"It is otherwise with the Semang. Their \"darker colour, and woolly hair separate them anthropologically \"both from the Sakai and from the Mon-Khmer people. The \"fact that they speak what is essentially the same language can \"only be explained on the assumption that they have abandoned \"their own and adopted a foreign one. As is the case with the \"Negritoes of the Philippines the original Negriti language seems \"to have been lost although indeed in the case of the Semang a \"number of words appear to exist as a new want of it.\n\nThe paper here ends. It covers 180 octavo pages and is obviously the outcome of most careful and labourious work. It is much too important not to be noticed in the Society's Journal and in default of a review by a competent hand my abstract may, I trust, suffice to direct the attention of members to it.\nThe Comparative Philology of the Sakai and Semang Dialects of the Malay Peninsula\u2014A Review.\n\nBY C. O. BLAGDEN.\n\nThere has recently appeared in the *Bijdragen tot de Taal-Land-en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb* a monograph of some length on the Sakai and Semang dialects, which may fairly claim to be the most comprehensive piece of work yet done in this connection and is therefore deserving of the attention of the readers of this Journal. It is the more interesting as being the first occasion for many years that a scholar of some standing in Europe has been attracted to the study of these dialects, and it will serve as a landmark for future collection and research in relation to his rather neglected subject.\n\nNever before have these dialects been submitted to the systematic comparison to which Professor Schmidt subjects them in his paper. It has been his purpose to collate all the existing published materials and to see whether any sound inferences could be drawn from such a comparison. He has actually omitted very little, and that little is not of the first importance. The sources from which he draws are carefully enumerated: they include, besides the previous numbers of this Journal the works of Newbold, Roberts, De Morgan and Vaughan Stevens as well as the vocabularies published by Klaproth, Tomlin, Low, Borie and Maclay, so that they comprise practically everything of permanent value that had\n\n---\n\na.

Here it might have been worth while to go even more deeply into the bibliography of the subject, and to show, for instance, that Klaproth's list is an unacknowledged copy from the one that appears in Crawfurd's History of the Indian Archipelago, eked out however with some additions from elsewhere, and to mention that Roberts merely copies, as he himself admits, from Anderson. In dealing with Newbold's somewhat irritating \"Benua\" list, the author rightly points out that it is a heterogeneous mixture of Besisi with words from some Semang dialect cognate to the one given by Tomlin (and Begbie); but his want of first-hand acquaintance with the spoken dialects of Malacca has prevented him from recognizing in it a third element, viz: Jakun, which is represented by a good many words collected for Newbold by Munshi 'Abdullah, as related by the latter in his well-known Autobiography. It is worth noticing too, though the author does not mention it, that the older sources (i.e., prior to 1875) practically all deal either with the Semang dialects of the North of the Peninsula (collected from Penang) or the dialects of the south (collected from Malacca). The latter barely take in the Southern fringe of the Sakai group, the purer forms of which, situated as they are in the centre of the Peninsula, remained quite unknown (except for the short notice by Colonel Low) until the introduction of the Residential system opened the Native States to European enquirers.\n\nq. I may, perhaps, be permitted, in this connection, to confirm the author's inference, drawn purely from internal evidence, that I did not copy the Besisi words I gave in a former paper from my friend Mr. W. W. Skeat, or vice versa. Mine were collected in Malacca, his in Selangor. I venture to think it is rather a tribute to our accuracy that they exhibit so few serious discrepancies.\n\nr. Bearing these limitations in view and allowing for their occasional errors, the old lists are still very valuable and well worth studying, especially for the Semang dialects.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 30, 1903.\nAfter discussing the sources, Professor Schmidt gives a comparative vocabulary of words of all the aboriginal dialects represented in them, reduced as far as possible to a uniform system of spelling and arranged according to the apparent relationships of the individual words. This has been very well done and must have been a difficult and troublesome task, but it is needless to say that such an arrangement (the only one possible for comparative study) is necessarily, in the present imperfect state of our knowledge of the subject, to some extent tentative and provisional. In many cases the author's assumption of an underlying affinity seems somewhat unconvincing. It is difficult, for instance, to believe that log is the same word as j\u0113hu: true they both mean \"tree\" or \"wood\" (though I believe log = \"tree,\" Mal. pohon and j\u0113hu = \"wood\" Mal. kayu), and there are, it must be admitted, forms in existence which seem to be almost intermediate between them, e.g., delotn, jelop, j\u0113hup and the like, but the evidence of identity does not seem to be quite conclusive, the more so as, apparently, the two variant forms appear on occasions together in one dialect.*\n\nSometimes, too, in his natural desire to arrive at identifications, the author is inclined to take liberties with his authorities: e.g., he will have it that ge, \"to eat\" (in S\u0113mang) is to be pronounced je, so as to bring it into line with the other and more common word for \"to eat,\" viz: cha (Sakai), chi (S\u0113man). But the g in ge is hard, and the word appears to be quite distinct from cha and chi.\n\nIn compiling his comparative vocabulary, the author has designedly omitted words of Malayan origin.* This is somewhat regrettable as the forms assumed by these words in the aboriginal dialects throw an interesting light on their phonology. Moreover the omission seems to involve the assumption that all such words are of comparatively modern importation from Malay, whereas in fact there are in these dialects words of undoubted Malayan affinity which cannot possibly have come into them in that way. Certainly such words as to'ot \"knee\", amu \"dog\" awe\n\n* See Dr. Luering's Ulu Kampar Sakai in No. 35 of this Journal.\n\n\u2020 The process has not been quite completely carried out, some 50 words being left in, besides those noticed by the author.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"rattan,\" *siah* \"salt,\" *manuk* \"fowl,\" *kebus* \"dead,\" *hirum* \"black,\" point back to a Malayan dialect other than Malay, and the presence of such words, relatively few though they are, inevitably throws some doubt on the origin of others whose source, by reason of their being common to Malay and other Malayan languages, is necessarily a subject of uncertainty.\n\nThe omission of these words obscures one important element in the constitution of the aboriginal dialects which must not be left out of sight in any speculation as to their origin and affinities.\n\nIt is difficult to account for their presence in the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula except on the assumption that they represent relics of Malayan dialects locally evolved there and distinct from Malay itself, which is a Sumatran language not originally native to the Peninsula; and in that case their introduction must, it would seem, be of very ancient date, going back to the days when Malay had not yet become the language of the Peninsula; or to put the same thing in another way, some of these aboriginal dialects are, at any rate in part, derived from an independent Malayan origin going back to a remote antiquity. While, therefore, there can be no doubt as to the importance of the well-known Mon-Annam element in the aboriginal dialects, this very archaic Malayan element is equally deserving of recognition.\n\nThese points are not without importance, for the author's argument for the Mon-Annam origin of these dialects depends to some extent upon the percentage of Mon-Annam words which can be discovered in them: if therefore the aggregate number of words examined is unduly reduced, either by arbitrary exclusion or by doubtful identifications, it is plain that this percentage will be overstated. As the figures stand, the author reduces his words to about 1250 and of these he professes to identify about 240, say 20 per cent, as Mon-Annam. The comparison is made at a later stage, and it is rather anticipating matters to mention it here, but it is the main thesis of the article.\n\nMost of the identifications seem to be quite unassailable and even if they only account for something less than 20 per cent of the vocabulary, that is still a considerable achievement.\nBut a good many are at least doubtful, and one great element of uncertainty remains which it is at present impossible to eliminate, viz: the question whether the so-called Mon-Annam languages themselves constitute a true family or are not rather a very mixed formation, embodying various elements of unknown origin.\n\nThe point is shortly this: so long as one is dealing with Peguan or Cambodian, about which, as they are written languages, a considerable amount is known, one is on relatively safe ground and can fairly refer words, that are attested by their appearance in these two languages, to the Mon-Annam group. But when it comes to words that reappear only in such dialects as Lemet, Cat, Sedang and the like, of which merely a few short vocabularies exist, while little or nothing is known of their structure, the genuine Mon-Annam character of such words is at least doubtful. The frequent comparisons with Cham which the author makes also illustrate this point: for Cham is, in part at least, a Malayan language. Such a word as cheong \"belly\" in S\u00e9mang, if it be really identical with the Cham tian, cannot be referred to a Mon-Annam origin, for tian is unquestionably Malayan, occurring as it does in several island languages of the Archipelago.\n\nThe fact is that one is dealing here with very mixed materials, and even the greatest care will not prevent an occasional mistake.\n\nAfter setting out the comparative vocabulary and the too few sentences which have been recorded, the author proceeds to give what is really the first attempt at a comparative grammar of these dialects. As a first attempt it can only be characterized as admirable.\n\nHe begins by discussing the sounds, both vowels and consonants; and here it is worth while laying stress upon his well-grounded complaint that collectors almost uniformly omit to give a key to their systems of orthography. If they would only be good enough to explain precisely how they intend words to be pronounced, the work of the comparative student would be much facilitated. The discussion of the phonology of these dialects brings out several interesting points. The nasal consonants are noticed; the nasal vowels, however, which are\nequally well-marked, are not observed by the author, that is not his fault: it may be explained that they somewhat resemble the French n sounds, but are not unfrequently followed by an ordinary consonant. The pronunciation of the palatal letters (ch, j, sh) seems to require further elucidation, as it is not quite clear whether they are identical with the corresponding English sounds or somewhat softer. There is a question whether all the so-called diphthongs are really diphthongs or merely two vowels in juxtaposition, each retaining its separate force. A few letters seem to be doubtful: e.g., z and f in Newbold's list, where the former represents a rough (probably palatal) r and the latter generally a p; but both z and f appear, though rarely, in Semang, and z in a few Sakai words. On these points perhaps future collectors may throw more light.\n\nReduplication and repetition as modes of word formation are next noticed, and then follows a most valuable section on prefixes and infixes. Their existence as formative elements in these dialects has been pointed out before, though never worked out as completely as is done here. There can be no two opinions as to its importance, especially in relation to the closely similar formation of the Mon-Annam and the Malayan families of speech. It may however be as well to express a doubt as to the soundness of the author's view that a prefix can be assumed whenever a word appears in two slightly varying forms differentiated by their initial syllables, or by the absence in one case of an initial syllable which appears in the other. In the first place, the mutability of sounds in these dialects is something quite remarkable, but this need not imply that the syllable which changes is a prefix, that is to say a merely formal accretion and no part of the essence of the word: for the same mutability shows itself in the final consonants, which must surely be part of the root. Secondly, where there are two forms, a longer and a shorter, it is by no means certain that the shorter is always the original one: it may be only an abbreviation, the result of rapid speech and phonetic decay. Some allowance, too, must be made for the defective observation and spelling of some collectors.\n\nn. e.g., by Mr. W. W. Skeat in Selangor Journal, Vol. V, p. 328.\nv. The author gives instances of the interchange of k, -t and -p.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nStill, after making a reasonable allowance for these sources of error, there remains a large number of words in which the existence of prefixes is quite certain. Their meaning is more difficult to arrive at, but some, e.g., Ku- in Besisi and ma- in Semang are undoubtedly verbal, and there are others which are apparently adjectival and pronominal or demonstrative. One very curious verbal prefix found in a dialect of the Northern Sakai group (but by the collector, Mr Morgan, called Semang) appears to vary its final consonant to suit the final consonant of the principal root; e.g. n\u0113pchip \"to go\", n\u0113bhip \"to enter,\" n\u0113kpol \"to open.\" This would seem to be in reality a combination of a prefix and a broken down repetition of the root word.\n\nThe author after comparing in succession the pronouns, personal, possessive, demonstrative and interrogative, proceeds to deal with the syntax of the substantive. It is worth noting that, so far as appears, the same system of syntax runs through all these dialects. The nominative (subject) precedes the predicate; the genitive, adjective and demonstrative pronoun follows the verb which governs it. Apparently there is no foundation, at any rate in the materials here analysed, for the theory that in Semang the ideology is different.\n\nNext the numerals are compared: here there is a clear classification into groups, and as the numerals raise certain points of some difficulty and considerable interest it seems desirable to give specimens of the various types which occur. They are as follows:\n\n|   | I       | II     | III    | IV                  |\n|---|---------|--------|--------|---------------------|\n|   | Semang | Sakai  | Sakai  | Besisi (and other southern dialects) |\n| 1 | nai     | neh (nei) | namu   | mui                 |\n| 2 | bie     | nar    | narr   | 'mbar               |\n| 3 | (various) | ne'   | ni     | 'mpo\"               |\n| 4 | (various) | (none)| (none)| upun                |\n| 5 | (none)  | (none)| (none)| w\u0101sek               |\n| 6 | (none)  | (none)| none  | p\u0113rn                |\n| 7 | (none)  | (none)| (none)| tempo               |\n\nFor three in Semang the forms put, ne, din and for four sa-bhr and nas are given. These seem doubtful: but all the forms\n\nJean Stratis Blande\ngiven in the above table are well attested, and it is noticeable how little agreement there is between the Sakai on the one hand and the Semang and Besisi respectively on the other. It is true that one appears to be the same in groups I and II and possibly this is due to the fact that II is a mixed group of Sakai with a tinge of Semang in it, as is evidenced by other words common to these two groups. But the author's attempt to derive the forms of groups I, II and III from the purely Mon-Annam forms of group IV is more or less conjectural, and even if it is correct it leaves one with the curious result that the pure Sakai is (as regards the numerals) farther removed from the regular Mon-Annam type than the mixed Besisi and its neighbours. This group IV consists of a string of outlying dialects scattered along the border line between the pure Sakai and the Jakun, in a tract of country which extends from Ulu Tembeling and Kuantan (Pahang) to the Jasin district of Malacca and from Kuala Langat (Selangor) to Ulu Indau (Johor). In this group alone do the numerals extend beyond four, and that fact as well as their singularly good state of preservation (in these very mixed dialects) seems to me to indicate that these Mon-Annam numerals were not native to the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula but were imposed from without, and that they either have nothing whatever to do with the Sakai numerals (from which they certainly cannot be derived) or that they have filtered through into Sakai in degenerate forms. It seems very unlikely that the pure Sakai first imposed its numerals (in a primitive form) on the Jakuns who speak Besisi etc., and then proceeded to corrupt them while the Besisi preserved them unchanged.\n\nSo far as this evidence goes, it appears to me to tell against the conclusion which the author ultimately arrives at, viz.: that all the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula are branches of the Mon-Annam stock.\n\nIt will be seen, too, that it is a mistake to regard the various dialects as corruptions, in different degrees, of one single type\n\n---\n\n*Some rather dubious lists of numerals beyond \"four\" are given by two or three authorities, but all differ (inter se) and are suspected on that ground.*\n\nR. A Soc. No. 39, 1902\nof Sakai, represented in its purest form by the S\u0113noi dialect. This erroneous view has perhaps tended to discourage the collection of the other dialects, which has been stigmatized as useless except for the purpose of studying the progressive decay of the language. It is evident, however, that S\u0113noi, though no doubt on the whole the purest type of its own class of Sakai, cannot be called upon to explain all the other dialects, some of which appear to be in some respects nearer to the ancient forms.\n\nI need say nothing of the author's further comparison with the numerals of two Borneo dialects given in Mr. Ling Roth's work on Sarawak, as Mr. Ray (in \"Man\" 1902, No. 42) has shown that one of these so-called Borneo dialects is really a Sakai dialect of Perak collected by the late Mr. Brooke Low, while the resemblance of the other is very slight and clearly fortuitous.\n\nAfter pointing out that a fair number of words (some 50 or so, and all or nearly all of them of Mon-Annam origin) run through almost all the dialects, the author next proceeds to analyse the lists where they differ, with a view to discovering the relationship of the various dialects inter se and establishing a classification of them into groups. Considering the paucity of the materials for many of the dialects, this is really a brilliant piece of work, to which justice could be done only by going into details for which there is no space in this notice. The upshot of it is that the dialects of the Peninsula, so far as they are here represented, fall into the following groups:\n\nI. S\u0113mang.\n\n(i) A relatively pure S\u0113mang (and Pangan) group, curiously homogeneous though covering a large tract of country and extending from Northern K\u0113dah to southern Kelantan;\n\n(ii) Another S\u0113mang group, less pure than the preceding, represented by (a) the \"Jooroo\" (Juru) S\u0113mang of the authorities, (b) the dialect given by Begbie (and Tomlin) and (c) certain words in Newbold's \"Benua\" list: apparently to be regarded as \"low country\" S\u0113mang as opposed to the purer dialects of the interior hills.\nII. Sakai.\n\n(iii) The Tembe' (or northern) Sakai group;\n(iv) The Senoi (or central) Sakai group and the southern dialects, such as Besisi.\n\nSubstantially this classification, so far as it goes, would seem to be entirely justified by the existing materials. It will be observed that the main line of division (that between groups I and II) corresponds pretty closely with the difference in race between the Negritos (Semangs) and the Sakais, while the subdivision of group II into sub-groups iii and iv coincides with Mr. Clifford's distinction between Tembe' and Senoi and agrees with Dr. Luering's statement (which is borne out by a comparison of their vocabularies) that the Ulu Kampar Sakais, who belong to sub-group iv, cannot understand the dialect of the Kinta Sakais, who fall into sub-group iii. So far at least as the Western half of the Peninsula is concerned, this classification will probably stand the test of further enquiry: in Pahang there appear to be dialects of a mixed character which partake of some of the characteristics of several of these sub-groups and have peculiarities of their own as well. Of these the author had no knowledge, as they have not as yet appeared in print.\n\nIt is probable that sub-group iv should be further subdivided into \u2014\n\n(a) Central Sakai, including Senoi, the Southern Perak dialects and some of the Selangor dialects, down to and including the dialect of the Orang Tanjong of Ulu Langat; and\n\n(b) Besisi and a straggling group of allied dialects in Southern Selangor, the Negri Sembilan, Malacca, and part of Pahang.\n\nThis last sub-division runs along the borderland between Sakais and Jakuns: to the south and south-east of it come the more Malayan Jakun dialects of Johor and the neighbouring territories, and it is to be observed that the Besisi group, itself, though remarkable for the purity with which it has preserved the Mon-Annam numerals, contains a considerable Malayan ele-\n\nSelangor Journal (1895) Vol III pp. 244, 245.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nment. Similarly one of the chief differences between the S\u0113noi and the T\u0113mbe' groups is that the latter has more in common with Semang than the former. The purest S\u0113mang appears to be spoken in Central and Northern K\u0113dah and the adjoining States of Raman and L\u012bgeh, and the purest Sakai in South-eastern Perak, between Sungei Raya and Ulu Slim, and in the adjoining valleys of Ulu Pahang. Between these centres there is a debatable country in which are to be found more or less mixed tribes speaking mixed dialects partly S\u0113mang, partly Sakai.\n\nThe author's classification appears to be defective in one point, namely in ignoring the Jakun group of the South of the Peninsula: this group, whatever its origin, is now hopelessly broken down and almost swamped with Malay, but it is of some interest and apparently originally quite distinct from Sakai.\n\nHere we have, however, the first attempt at a systematic grouping of these dialects, and for this the author deserves every credit. He also brings out a most important fact, viz: that, underlying the common Mon-Annam element which apparently runs through practically all these dialects, though in varying strength, and the comparative uniformity of which has led some former writers into the erroneous Pan-Negrito theory, there is in the S\u0113mang dialects an alien element, neither Mon-Annam nor Malayan, which may reasonably be assumed to be the remnant of the original speech of the Negritos.\n\nIt is a mistake to assert that there are but few words common to Sakai and S\u0113mang: the contrary is the case, such words being fairly numerous. But, apart from these, there is a body of words apparently peculiar to S\u0113mang and not derived from Sakai or any other known language. It is in these words that the original affinities of the S\u0113mang dialects will have to be sought (if indeed it is any longer possible to detect them) and not in the words which S\u0113mang has in common with Sakai and\n\n---\n\n1. I mean pure with reference to S\u0113mang and Sakai intermixture only, leaving Malay influence out of the question.\n\n2. By this I mean the notion (of Maclay and others) that the whole of the aborigines are of Negrito origin and that the differences amongst them depend merely, on the percentage of crossing with Malays.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthe Mon-Annam languages of Indo-China. The author is fully justified in claiming to have established on purely linguistic grounds the existence of a distinct Semang group of dialects, spoken by and more or less co-extensive with the Negrito tribes of the North of the Peninsula.\n\nIt is true that the border lines of language and physique do not quite coincide: there are mixed Sakai-Semang tribes in Northern Perak who speak substantially Sakai dialects, while in Southern Kelantan and Trongganu there are tribes, described as having the Sakai physical characteristics, whose dialects nevertheless must be classified as Semang. But the great point gained is that there is now proved to be a Semang group of dialects originally distinct from Sakai and retaining a considerable number of words for which no analogues have yet been found elsewhere. Instances of such words are (1) K\u00ebto', \"day,\" (2) Kawau, \"bird,\" (3) mako, \"egg,\" (4) ekob, \"snake;\" (5) ek, \"dog\", (6) yus, nyus, \"tooth\", (7) chas, \"hand,\" which are in no way connected with the corresponding Sakai words (1) jish, (2) chim (or chep), (3) tap, (4) taju, (5) clo, (6) iemun, (7) tek\" (or th). With the possible exception of No. 6, none of the above Semang words appear to be Mon-Annam; while, of the Sakai, Nos 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 certainly are.\n\nThe next section of the paper is occupied with a careful analysis of the mode of formation of the Mon-Annam languages. It is shown that the sounds correspond pretty closely with those of our aboriginal dialects; but the greatest stress is laid on the system of prefixes and infixes. In this place it is hardly practicable to do more than illustrate this point by an example or two, drawn from the author's specimens. Thus in Cambodian, from a word p\u00ebk, \"to fall to pieces: to split up; division,\" are derived the following:\n\n- pn\u00ebk \"part\"\n- pamp\u00ebk \"to divide\"\n- pann\u00ebk \"piece\"\n- pren\u00ebk \"piece\"\n- prap\u00ebk \"division\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903\nwhere the persistence of the root (here shown in italics) is clearly seen in spite of the apparatus of prefixes or infixes added to it. Another similar case is:\n\n- *kat* \"to cut off\"\n- *khnat* \"measure\"\n- *kumnat* \"piece\"\n- *thkat* \"pain\"\n- *tamkat* \"pain, suffering.\"\n\nAnalogous, though less elaborate, formations occur in several of the other Mon-Annam languages, and this system, it must be admitted bears a strong resemblance to the mode of formation of the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula.\n\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that it also finds parallels in the Malayan family, some members of which (e.g. the Philippine languages) have carried it to an even higher stage of complicated development. In fact the relation between the Malayan and Mon-Annam families in this particular are very puzzling: there is so much similarity in their structure and so little, relatively speaking, in their material or lexicographical elements. I suppose it may be regarded as certain that these two families of speech formerly bordered on one another in Southern Indo-China (and possibly in the Peninsula too) and, it would seem that while they were in contact the one group in some way exercised a profound influence on the other, probably in the way, mainly, of the Mon-Annam group absorbing Malayan elements, both material and formal. This makes it doubly difficult, in the case of the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula which must have been evolved somewhere near the border line of these two families, to decide to which, if either, of them they originally belonged, seeing that the mode of formation in both is so very similar. In the apparent absence of suffixes and in some other respects, however, it must be admitted that the aboriginal dialects offer more analogy to the Mon-Annam than to the Malayan family.\n\nAfter analysing these formal elements, the author runs through the various parts of speech in the Mon-Annam languages.\nand compares them with the corresponding ones in the aboriginal dialects, so far as the materials admit of such comparison. The upshot of the matter is that, in his view, on grounds of phonology, structure, and similarity of pronouns, demonstrative adverbs and numerals, as well as the number of other words already alluded to, the Sakai and Semang dialects are to be considered as essentially related to the Mon-Annam family. Further the author holds that, on anthropological grounds, the Sakais are to be considered as genuine members of the Mon-Annam group of races, and therefore that their dialects are not an acquired form of speech but represent their own original language.\n\nThis latter point is, unfortunately, very slightly handled. The author rests it upon (1) the dolichocephalic character (2) the dark complexion (3) the non-Mongoloid eyes and (4) the wavy hair of these tribes, characteristics which may be paralleled in certain of the Mon-Annam races.\n\nThis matter is, however, involved in great obscurity: for some of these characteristics appear to be absent in some of the Mon-Annam races. The Peguans and Cambodians appear to be decidedly Mongoloid in type, though with a difference: and the author's view requires us to believe that this is due to crossing with a Mongoloid strain which has obliterated their genuine original characteristics, while these have been retained in relative purity by some of the wilder tribes. The thing is possible. One knows that in Indo-China there has been an enormous amount of crossing of races, and it is conceivable that a slight strain of the strong Mongoloid type (which, as one sees in Straits Eurasians, is very persistent even when present in small percentages) might have modified the physical characteristics of the civilized members of the Mon-Annam stock (after the wild tribes had parted off from it) without seriously affecting their languages.\n\nIn the case of the Negritos the matter is not susceptible of the same explanation, and the author's view is that the Se\n\na. I am assured by a Peguan that he can distinguish his own people from the Burmese by their more oval faces and more prominent (almost European) noses; and that wavy hair occurs, though rarely, amongst them.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nmangs have substantially given up their own languages and now speak dialects imposed upon them by a Mon-Annam race, that is presumably by their neighbours the Sakais, although they have preserved a good many genuine old S\u00ebmang words.\n\nThe collection and analysis of new materials will show whether these conclusions are tenable. Personally I still incline rather to the view, suggested in a former number of this Journal, that most of the Mon-Annam words in these dialects have been imposed from without by the influence of a Mon-Annam race of higher civilization; and I think that the curiously pure form of the numerals in the otherwise mixed group of dialects to which B\u00ebsisi belongs supports this view. It would not however be inconsistent with this idea to hold that the Sakai dialects are also of Mon-Annam origin, though much more distantly related to the parent stem: and that would perhaps account for the divergence of the Sakai numerals from the normal type. In that case we should have two waves of Mon-Annam influence in the Peninsula, as well as two of Malayan, and the analysis of the dialects would be somewhat as follows:\n\nI. Common elements running through practically all the dialects\u2014\n\n(1) Malay;\n(2) Mon-Annam of the purer type;\n(3) Malayan, other than Malay.\n\nII. Separate original elements.\n\n(4) In S\u00ebmang: the original language of the Negritos, whatever that may have been (possibly akin to Andamanese?)\n(5) in Sakai: a rude Mon-Annam form of speech (?)\n(6) in Jakun: Malayan (?) and if so, identical with (3) above (?).\n\nIt is evident from what has been said that though some progress has been made in the study of these dialects, much remains to be done; and as the author's main purpose, as stated by himself, is to encourage further research, it is to be hoped that collectors will be stimulated by his valuable paper, and will take the matter seriously in hand. Above all it is absolutely necessary to obtain a large number of genuine sentences, as\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nactually spoken by the aborigines: mere lists of words have their value, but the only chance of getting an insight into the grammar of a language lies in the collection and analysis of sentences, and that is now the most urgent desideratum in connection with these dialects. Such work can only be done properly by men on the spot and thoroughly conversant with local circumstances, and the task should be undertaken at once, before the imminent extinction of these dialects makes it forever impossible. In view of the high value, from a scientific point of view, of such researches (which is attested by the interest taken in them by a scholar of European reputation like the author of the paper I have attempted to review) I venture to express the hope that the Governments of the Straits Settlements and the Native States will follow the good example, in these matters, of the Indian Government and will give some assistance, or at least encouragement, towards a systematic linguistic survey of the Peninsula on the lines of the Linguistic Survey of India.\nThe Contents of a Dyak Medicine Chest.\n\nBY BISHOP HOSE.\n\nA few days ago I was in the upper part of the Saribas river, the home of the race once celebrated throughout Malaya for daring deeds of piracy. My companion was the Rev. William Howell, the joint author with Mr. D. J. S. Bailey of 'A Dictionary of the Sea-Dyak Language,' and an authority on all subjects connected with the religious and other customs of that people. We had ascended the Padih, an affluent of the main river, to the village of Kundong, where we were going to spend the night in the Dyak house, of which Brok is the tuai, or head-man. The house is of moderate length, about twenty doors; and as usual the apartments of the tuai are near the middle of the building. There we were hospitably installed on the rwai, or undivided hall, (sometimes described as a verandah), which extends throughout the whole length of a Sea-Dyak house, and occupies about half of its area. The good mats were brought down from the sadau, or loft, and spread for us; the rare luxury of a chair was provided for me and there we talked, and taught, and answered questions, and dispensed medicines, while the inhabitants of the other rooms gathered round us, as well as the occupants of our host's private quarters. There also we ate, and there we slept when the kindly people would at last consent to our going to bed.\n\nThe majority of the 'rooms,' i.e. separate tenements, in this house are inhabited by Christians of long standing, but there are a few who have not yet come in. Amongst them is a Manang, or Doctor of Magic, named Dasu, who has a large practice in the neighbourhood. I was anxious to interview him in order to get some information that I wanted for the purpose of comparing the original spiritual beliefs of the Borneans with those that underlie the Mohammedanism of the Malays of the Peninsula. I was also desirous of ascertaining how far the methods of the\nDyak Manang, when undertaking to cure diseases, resembled those of the Pawang and Bomor, his Malay confr\u00e8res.\n\nAt our invitation Dr. Dasu came out of his room readily enough, and sat down with us to chat and smoke a cigarette. He talked freely and intelligently about such matters of general interest as happened to be broached, especially the late expedition against the turbulent people of the Ulu Ai, and the terrible epidemic of cholera which was just passing away. But as soon as we began to give the conversation a professional turn, and speak of the practice of medicine by the native doctors of the Saribas, he put on a look of impenetrable reserve, and could hardly be persuaded to speak at all. There is reason to believe that this was chiefly owing to the presence of Howell. He has succeeded in winning the confidence and affectionate regard of Dyaks to an unusual degree, but he is unpopular among the Minangs. His teaching has led people to think for themselves, and wherever he goes the business and the gains of the village doctor show a tendency to decrease. Moreover several of the fraternity have submitted to his influence, abandoned their tricks, and taken to honest farming. It is known too that some of these have surrendered their whole stock of charms to my friend, and have also made dangerous revelations, whereby the profession has been much discredited.\n\nSo Dr. Dasu was only with great difficulty induced to impart to us his knowledge. He told me after more confidential relations had grown up between us, that he suspected me of an intention, by some means or other, to get possession of his precious materia medica, and to deprive him of his means of living. However his fears were removed by repeated assurances that it was information only that I wanted, and that I was consulting him just because I preferred to get it direct from a professor of repute, rather than trust to reports received from white men. At length we persuaded him to be gently catechised. I got some precise answers to my questions respecting certain articles of Dyak belief which had been variously defined by different investigators, and about which my ideas had been a good deal confused. But those matters are not the subject of this note. It is the concluding incident of the rather prolonged interview that I propose to describe.\n\nJour. Smith Branch.\nWe had talked to one another so pleasantly and frankly that I thought I might ask Dasu as a great favor to show me his Lupong, or Medicine Chest, and the charms of power which it contained. It was quite evident that this aroused his suspicions again, and he retired within himself as before. But the principal people of the house, who were sitting by us, urged him to consent, and, as old acquaintances of mine, assured him of my good faith. So he was at last persuaded, and went to his own room to fetch the treasure.\n\nAs I have said, the good mats of the household, as is usual when it is intended to show respect to a visitor, had been taken down for our accommodation from the place where they are stored. But we now saw that the most valued of them all had been held in reserve. This, which was made of fine and very flexible rotan, the latest triumph of the skill and industry of our courteous hostess Ipah, Brok's wife, was now handed down and spread in front of us for the reception of the great man and the mysterious implements of his profession. After some considerable delay, probably intended to excite our curiosity the more, he appeared and sat down on the mat prepared for him; a subdued murmur of applause and satisfaction greeting him as he took his seat.\n\nA Manang's Lupong, or case for holding his charms, may be almost anything. Sometimes it is a box, sometimes a basket, sometimes a bag. In this instance it was an open-mouthed basket made of thin shavings of bamboo, hung round the neck of the owner by a strip of bark.\n\nBefore beginning the exhibition Dasu made a little formal speech, in which with much show of humility, he spoke in depreciation of his own powers and knowledge, and of his collection of remedial charms, as compared with those of other members of the profession elsewhere. These remarks were of course received with complimentary expressions of dissent from the audience; and then at last the contents of the basket were displayed before us. They were tied up together in a cloth bag, the most highly prized being further enclosed in special receptacles of their own, such as a second cloth covering, a little bamboo box with a lid, or a match-box. They were ceremoniously brought out and placed side by side on the mat.\nof honour. I was then invited to handle and examine them, and the name and use of each were told me without any fresh indication of unwillingness. This is a list of them.\n\ni. Batu bintang, or Star-stone; a small transparent stone rounded by the action of water till it was almost spherical, with a rather rough surface. The Manang looked upon it as his badge of authority, and told the following story of the way he became possessed of it. Many years ago, in the interval between harvest and the next seed-time, he was working as a cooly in Upper Sarawak. There he had a dream in which he was visited by the being whom he looks upon as his guardian-spirit. As in all cases when this spirit has had any communication to make to him, it appeared in the form of a tortoise. It told him that he must forthwith put himself under instruction in order to be qualified for the office of a Manang; and that if he neglected this command all the spirits would be angry, and death or madness would be the penalty. When he awoke he found the Batu bintang by his side, and had no doubt it was the gift of the spirit. Accordingly he did as he was bidden without loss of time. He acquired the professional knowledge and the stock in trade which were necessary, and was at last duly initiated with all the proper rites and ceremonies.\n\nii. Batu krat ikan sembilan, or The petrified section of the Sembilan fish. This was a curious object which I could not quite make out. It was oblong in shape, about two inches long, one inch broad, and half an inch thick in the middle, but getting suddenly thinner towards the two edges till it became not more than \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of an inch. The thick part was hollow, having a large oval-shaped perforation going through it. It resembled a section from the middle of a large winged seed, but heavy for its size, and feeling like stone. I could not of course test this by cutting or scraping. When used it is soaked for a time in water; the water is then given to the sick man to drink, or is rubbed gently upon the part of his body which is affected.\n\niii. Batu lintar, or Thunder-bolt: a small dark-coloured stone, about an inch and a half long, and a quarter of an inch thick at the base, tapering to a sixteenth of an inch at the point; curved and rather like a very small rhinoceros horn, and highly polished. It was probably the same kind of stone as that of\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwhich the stone implements found in the Malay Peninsula are made, which are also called Batu lintar. It is pressed firmly against the body wherever pain is felt.\n\niv. Batu nitar, another name for Thunder-bolt: a minute four-side crystal, half an inch long and about two lines thick. A charm to be used only in extreme cases. It is dipped in water and then shaken over the patient. If he starts when the drops of water fall upon his body he will recover, otherwise he will die.\n\nv. Batu krang jiranau, or Petrified root-stock of jiranau (a Zingiberad?). They told us this is the Dyak name of a kind of wild ginger. The word is curiously near to Jerungau or Jeringu, which Ridley says is Acorus calamus: \"a plant much used by native medicine-men,\" (Wilkinson, Malay-English Dictionary.) The thing so called was possibly part of the back-bone of some animal, bent double and the two ends tied together, each vertebra brown and shining after long use. A charm for dysentery and indigestion, and also for consumption. It is dipped in oil, and rubbed on the patient's body in a downward direction.\n\nvi. Batu ilau, or Sparkling stone, also called Batu kras, or the hard stone. A six-sided crystal, two inches long and three quarters of an inch thick. One end appeared to have been formerly stuck into some sort of handle, as it was covered with malau, or lac. This is the indispensable sight-stone to be looked into for a view of that which is future, or distant, or otherwise invisible to ordinary eyes. It is specially used by Manangs, for discovering where the soul of the sick man, wandering away from the body, is concealing itself; or for detecting the particular demon who is causing the illness.\n\nThere were also, jumbled up together at the bottom of the bag, a number of tusks of wild boar, pebbles, and other rubbish, but these were pronounced to be utai ngapu, things of no importance. One article that we hoped to find was absent. Dasu said he should be glad indeed to have it, but it had never come in his way. It is the Batu burung endan, or Pelican stone. He explained to us that this is a stone which has the magical power of securing the presence and cooperation of a spirit who dwells in the form of the endan, (pelicanus malaccensis). When the Manang is seeking to enter Selayan, the Spirit world, in search\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nof the errant soul of a sick man, this demon can ensure to him a swift and unimpeded passage thither and back again.\n\nWhile Dasu was telling us the story of his vision of the Tortoise spirit who gave him the Batu Bintang I watched his face carefully for any sign that he believed, or did not believe his account. I could not be sure: but I am inclined to think he did not. He seemed relieved when we had finished our examination of his possessions, and he could pack them all up and carry them off to the security of his own dwelling.\n\nSeveral similar collections of charms have at different times been given to me, obtained from Manangs who have become Christians but it was particularly interesting to me to have a set actually in use exhibited and explained by their owner, and I have thought that a description of them might possibly have some interest for other Members of the Society.\nNew Malay Orchids.\n\nBY H.

This little plant generally occurs in orchid trees, and I cannot think how it has escaped being described for so long. It grows also in Borneo. Its flowers resemble those of *S. latifolium*, Ridl. *Cleisostoma latifolium* and *C. fuscum*, Lindl., but it has a much smaller stem than that plant and the panicle is much smaller.\n\n*S. arachnanthe*, n. sp.

CAMERON.\n\nThis paper is a continuation of one describing the new genera and species contained in the Sarawak Museum and those captured by Mr. Shelford at Sarawak, published in the Journal of this Society, No. 37, January 1902.\n\nSIRICID\u00c6.\n\n*Xiphydria erythropus*, sp. nov.\n\nBlack, the scape of the antenn\u00e6 and the legs dark red, the wings dark fuscous-violaceous, the nervures and stigma black, the head and thorax closely rugosely punctured, the greater part of the vertex and the upper half of the front broadly; in the middle smooth and shining, \u2642.\n\nLength 16 mm.\nHab. Matang, 3600 feet.\n\nFront coarsely rugosely punctured, the punctures running into reticulations in parts; its centre is furrowed; the furrow is punctured on either side, the punctured band becoming wider towards the apex. On the smooth part of the vertex, at the apex, is a deep transverse furrow; behind, in the centre, is a narrower, shallower longitudinal furrow. Face irregularly longitudinally striated; the clypeus is piceous; its apex is broadly roundly incised. Mandibles opaque, sparsely punctured; their teeth are smooth and shining, large and broadly rounded. Thorax coarsely rugosely punctured: the pleur\u00e6 more coarsely than the mesonotum and more or less reticulated; the propleur\u00e6 smooths and with the central depression bearing some stout keels. The central lobe of the mesonotum has a deep furrow in the centre which is stoutly transversely striated; on the apex in the centre are 4 longitudinal keels. The fore tarsi and the\napical joints of the posterior are black. Except on the inner sides and apices of the lobes the median segment is closely punctured; the basal 4 segments are broadly furrowed across the base: these furrows are closely longitudinally striated.\n\n*Xiphydria melanopus*, sp. nov.\n\nBlack; the wings fuscous violaceous: the head rugose, the vertex smooth, the thorax coarsely rugosely punctured and reticulated throughout; the lateral and central furrows on the mesonotum wide, closely transversely striated, the lateral curved and becoming wider towards the apex, \u2640.\n\nLength 17 mm.\nHab. Matang.\n\nMandibles at the base closely punctured and thickly covered with white hair. Middle lobe of mesonotum coarsely irregularly reticulated; the lateral lobes on the inner side less strongly and more irregularly reticulated, on the outer almost smooth; the furrows become gradually wider towards the apex. Scutellum rugosely, coarsely punctured, except at the apex, which is smooth and shining; it is longitudinally furrowed down the centre. Abdomen as in *X. erythropus*.\n\nApart from the difference in colour this species may be known from *erythropus* by the much wider, broader at the apex, more rounded and closely striated middle lobe of the mesonotum, by the front having a large deep round depression and by the thorax being more strongly punctured,\n\n*Tenthredinidae*.\n\n*Monophadnus trichiocerus*, sp. nov.\n\nBlack, shining; the clypeus, labrum, the apex of the femora, and the tibiae, the upper edge of the pronotum and the tegulae whitish-yellow; abdomen testaceous, darker towards the apex; the wings from the transverse basal nervure fuscous-violaceous, the stigma and nervures black, \u2640.\n\nLength 9 mm.\nHab. Matang.\n\nAntennae short stout; the basal joint testaceous, the apical joint rufous beneath; they are thickly covered with\nstiff black hair. Centre of vertex bordered by wide and deep furrows, in front by a narrow oblique one; the front is deeply depressed, narrowly above, widely below. Apex of clypeus transverse. Labrum large, rounded in front. Mandibles pale yellow, rufous at the apex. The apical segments of the abdomen are narrowly edged with black at the apex; they are darker coloured than the basal and have a faint but distinct, violaceous tint. Legs covered with white hair; the apex of the hinder tibiae black.\n\n*Selandria iridipennis*, sp. nov.\n\nDark blue, the labrum, the coxae, trochanters and the base of the tibiae broadly white; the front wings fuscous, with a violaceous tint and highly iridescent; the stigma and nervures black; the hinder wings clear hyaline, \u2640 and \u2642.\n\nLength 9 mm.\nHab. Kuching.\n\nAntennae thickly covered with stiff black hair. Front and vertex closely and distinctly punctured, the vertex not raised; the lateral furrows shallow, indistinct; on the centre of the front is a large wide fovea almost transverse in front, rounded behind, and having a smaller round fovea on either side. Clypeus closely and distinctly punctured. Labrum smooth. Base of mandibles closely punctured. Legs thickly covered with white hair; the claws bifid. The 1st transverse cubital nervure is widely interrupted in the middle.\n\n*Cynipidae*.\n\n*Mesocynips*, gen. nov.\n\nAbdomen sessile, large, ovate, its middle as wide as the thorax, its basal 4 segments of equal width, the apical 2 longer. Antennae stout, 13-jointed; they are placed near the top of the head. Eyes ovate, widely separated from the base of the mandibles, the malar space being longer than their length. Clypeus depressed, separated from the face, obliquely narrowed towards the apex, which is transverse. Mandibles stout, broad, bidentate, the teeth broadly rounded. Vertex stoutly, longi-\ntudinally keeled; the front being also bordered below by a stout keel. The apex of the pronotum is sharply keeled; this keel is continued down the middle of the propleur\u00e6 obliquely, their apex being also keeled. Mesonotum and scutellum stoutly transversely striated. Scutellar fovea large, deep and stoutly keeled in the middle. The metanotum is bordered laterally by a stout keel and outside this, on the pleura, is a stout curved, irregular keel. Radial cellule short, the radius curved not reaching half way to the apex; the areolet is small, elongate, narrow, closed below by a thick pseudo-nervure; the cubitus reaches to the apex of the wing, it really issues from the radius, for a transverse cubital nervure can hardly be said to exist. The costal, median and submedian cellules are all distinct; the externo-median nervure is distinct, the discoidal nervure is distinct and reaches close to the apex of the wing, it is interstitial with the externo-median nervure.\n\nThe ovipositor is long and issues from the base of the abdomen, is straight and its sheaths are curved and project; the hypopygium is short and does not reach to the apex of the abdomen. Legs stout, pilose; the front calcaria are curved, the basal joint of all the tarsi is much the longer; the middle 3 are small; the apical large, but not quite so long as the basal one; the claws are large, curved, simple.\n\nThis new genus will form a new subfamily of Cynipidae. It has the form of Cynips but differs from that in the abdominal segments being of almost equal length, and in the straight, not curved, ovipositor. The subfamily Ibalii\u00e6 may be known from it by the long, cultriform abdomen, which has, as in our subfamily, the segments about equal in length. It has the alar nervures better developed than in the other subfamilies and in that respect resembles Mesocynips, whose systematic position is probably between the Ibalii\u00e6 and the Cynipinae.\n\nMesocynips insignis, sp. nov.\n\nFerruginous-yellow, the yellow tint more noticeable on the sides; the flagellum of the antenn\u00e6 infuscated, paler towards the apex; the mesonotum and the basal half of the scutellum\nstrongly, sharply transversely striated; the wings dark smoky-fuscous; the base to the transverse basal nervure and above to the base of the stigma bright yellow; the apical nervures fuscous-black; the basal bright yellow, \u2640.\n\nLength 10 mm.\nHab. Kuching.\n\nHead shining, sparsely punctured; the middle of the face raised and more closely and distinctly punctured; the face, front, vertex and occiput covered, but not thickly, with longish pale fuscous and white hairs. Apex of the mandibles broadly, deep black. Thorax Smooth and are shining; the pro-and meso-sparsely, the meta thorax thickly covered with long pale hair. Centre of metanotum smooth; the sides somewhat shagreened. Abdomen shining; the back and apical segments covered with long pale fuscous hairs; the penultimate segments punctured; the last much more strongly and deeply punctured. Femora sparsely, the tibiae and tarsi thickly covered with pale hairs; the claws blackish.\n\nThis species is probably identical with \"Cynips\" insignis, Smith, described, Proc. Linn. Soc. 1857, p. 117, from Sarawak. It is in no sense a Cynips in the modern meaning, and belongs to the parasitic branch of the family. To prevent the making of a synonym I have used Smith's name in case an examination of Smith's type would prove it to be identical with the species I have described.\n\nCHALCIDID.E.\n\nLeucospis erythrogastera, sp. nov.\n\nBlack, the ventral surface and apex of abdomen rufous mixed with yellow; a large broad mark on the inner orbits, rounded at the top and bottom and roundly curved inwardly on the inner side.

The\nhinder tarsi are rufous: the 4 anterior dark yellow; the hinder\ncoxae are rufous on the under side at the apex and have there a\nyellow mark. The ovipositor reaches to the apex of the scutellum.\n\nMegacolus epicipennis, sp. nov.\n\nBlack, the tarsi dark rufo-testaceous; the basal half of the\n\nJean Strode Branch\nwings to the ulna smoky-fuscous, the ulna fuscous, the cubitus black, the apex of the wings milky-white; the hinder femora with 7 teeth; the ovipositor stout, two-thirds of the length of the body, \u2640.\n\nLength to the commencement of the ovipositor 10 mm.; the ovipositor nearly 4 mm.\n\nHab. Kuching.\n\nHead and thorax coarsely, closely rugosely punctured; the front is stoutly keeled down the middle and is stoutly transversely striated on either side of the keel; the face is sparsely covered with glistening white hair. The upper part of the propleurae is smooth and is depressed at the base, the lower is irregularly striated. The basal third of the mesopleurae is depressed and is irregularly, widely striated. The base of the pronotum is obliquely depressed and is irregularly transversely striated. The apex of the scutellum broadly projects in the middle and is there roundly incised.

It may be known from our genus by the abdominal segments being unequal in length; the 1st and 2nd occupy most of the surface, the 4th and 5th being very short; the first three joints of flagellum are scarcely longer than thick, etc.\n\nSigulphogastra Ashmeadi, sp. nov.\n\nHead and thorax ferruginous, the antennae, abdomen and hinder legs black; the fore legs rufous; the middle dark testaceous; the head and thorax smooth and shining, the metanotum with a few irregular keels in the centre; the back of the abdomen strongly, irregularly longitudinally striolated; the wings hyaline, the nervures black; the stigma fuscous below. 8?\n\nLength 7 mm.\n\nHab.

Front flat in the centre, bordered laterally from near the top by a blunt, stout keel which runs into the antennal scape. The centre of the petiole is raised, clearly limited; its sides raised, broad at the base, its apex narrowed; there is an irregular row of oblique keels on the sides. The area on the 2nd segment is large, broad at the base, becoming gradually narrowed to the apex; it is finely irregularly longitudinally striated, the rest more strongly transversely striated; there is an oblique keel outside this; the part on either side of this is stoutly obliquely striated; the last segment is more closely and regularly striated than the others.\n\nR.

D.\n\n(With two plates.)\n\nAbout three years ago, during some excavations near the mouth of the Malacca river, a considerable number of coins was found scattered in the mud. These were collected together and handed over to the Hon'ble W. Egerton, Resident-Councillor of Malacca at the time, and presented by him to the Raffles Museum. The collection has proved to be of the greatest interest. It contains coins of both Asiatic and European origin, the European coins, Portuguese, Dutch and English, embracing practically the whole history of the various European occupations of Malacca, covering thus a period of about four hundred years. The most interesting of the coins are those of Portuguese origin, all of tin. They are probably quite unique: the British Museum does not possess any, and numerous enquiries I have made about them in various places, including Lisbon, have remained without result. With regard to their discovery Mr. Egerton writes:\n\n\"The Malacca Coins were found in digging a channel from the mouth of the river seawards. Outside the mouth there is a deep pool, and beyond that a bank submerged at high water, extending some half mile or more seawards. It was in this bank the coins were found scattered here and there, not in large pockets. The bank contained quantities of household detritus, broken crockery and old ironware, bricks, earthenware, etc. I think it is quite possible buildings on piles, like those now seen on the foreshore, may have been built on this bank, or possibly all this rubbish was thrown out of ships at anchor, or washed down out of the river. Most of the coins were found in the first hundred yards outside the big pool referred to above. There must be many still there.\"\n\nI. THE ASIATIC COINS.\n\nThat tin coins, struck by the inhabitants of the place, existed in Malacca before the arrival there of the Portuguese is\nproved by certain accounts in Albuquerque's Commentaries (2)*, but the fact seems to have almost escaped numismatologists, for Mill\u00e8s (19), p. 140, speaking of the currency of the Malay Peninsula says: \"M\u00eame l'\u00e9tat malai si c\u00e9l\u00e8bre de Malaka, qui \u00e9tait parvenu \u00e0 son apog\u00e9e au commencement du XVIe si\u00e8cle, lorsqu'il tomba sous la force mat\u00e9rielle majeure et l'h\u00e9ro\u00efsme des Portugais, ne nous a laiss\u00e9 aucun monument numismatique connu, et nous ne savons m\u00eame pas, si ce \u00e9tat malai poss\u00e9dait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une monnaie propre.\" In this Mill\u00e8s is certainly wrong, for in Albuquerque's Commentaries (2), Vol. III, p. 77, we find a mention of native coin which tells how King Xaquendarca (i.e. Iskander Shah), ruler of Malacca, went to see the king of China, wishing to become his vassal and took with him many presents, receiving in return, amongst other privileges, permission to coin small \"money of pewter, which money he ordered to be made as soon as he reached Malacca; and to it he gave the name of Caixes which are like our (i.e. Portuguese) c\u00eaitils, and a hundred go to the calaim, and each calaim was worth, to an appointed law, eleven reis and four c\u00eaitils. Silver and Gold was not made into money, but only used by way of merchandise.\" The fact that Malacca possessed native pewter coins on the arrival of the Portuguese becomes indisputable when we read that Albuquerque after the occupation of Malacca minted coins under the name of his king, D. Manuel, \"in order to withdraw and suppress the coinage of the Moors and cast their root and their name out of the land,\" and that when the new coinage was ready, he gave orders \"that all the Moors who held coin of the King of Malacca should convey it thither\" (i.e. to the mint) \"without delay under pain of death; and so great a quantity of money was thus carried there out of fear of the penalty which had been appointed to them, that the officers could not dispatch their business fast enough.\" (Vol. III, p. 138).\n\nI am sorry I cannot furnish absolute proof that the collection really contains coins of that early period. There are about 150 tin coins with Arabic inscriptions, but those few which are clear enough to be deciphered are of a much later date. It may be that the most worn and defaced coins belong to the period\n\n*These numbers refer to the list of Literature at the end of the paper.\n\nJour.

Wilkinson kindly identified this coin for me, and I subsequently found it figured and described by Netscher and Van der Chijs (18,) p. 179, pl. XXVI, fig. 245, and by Millies (12,) p. 148, pl. XXIII, fig. 250. The specimen described by the former two authors has also one side entirely smooth, and they state that the title maliku 'l-'\u00e2dil is used by several rulers of Western Borneo. According to them the coin would have come from Sambas or Mampawa in West Borneo and date from the year 1822. Millies, however, refers the coin to Trengganu.*\n\n(6). The coin figured on pl. II, fig. 2, seems to bear only a portion of the inscription maliku 'l-'\u00e2dil on the one side, whilst the characters on the other side are too indistinct to be deciphered.\n\nSome of these tin coins may possibly have come from Sumatra. Marsden (9), p. 401, speaks of tin coins current in Acheen, and Netscher and Van der Chijs (18), p. 162, too describe such coins from Acheen, as well as from Palembang, Jambi and the neighbouring island of Banka, but I have not been able to identify any of the Malacca coins with them.\n\nThe collection also contains a few Chinese coins, cash, which, however, are too much corroded to be identified.\n\nII. THE EUROPEAN COINS.\n\n1. The Portuguese Coins.\n\nThe European coins found at Malacca are Portuguese, Dutch and English, and, as I stated before, their dates embrace the whole period of the occupation of that place by these three nations.\n\n*Since writing the above I have seen a paper by Lt. Col. Gerini, 'A Malay Coin,' Journal, Royal Asiatic Society, April 1903, pp. 339-343, in which certain small gold coins, found in Jaring, near Patani, are described. Their obverse is 'an imitation of a Southern Indian fanam bearing the figure of a maneless lion,' whilst their reverse bears the inscription \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062f\u0644, reminding thus strongly of the tin coins described above. Dr. Codrington is of opinion that those gold coins had come from Acheen.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nMalacca was taken by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511 and held by them until 1641. The kings of Portugal during that period were:\n\nEmmanuel, 1495\u20141521\nJohn III, 1521\u20141557\nSebastian, 1557\u20141578\n\nand four others to whom it will not be necessary to refer in this paper. From 1641 to 1795 the Dutch held possession of it, from 1795 to 1818 the English, from 1818 to 1824 the Dutch again, and since then the English.\n\nThe coins in the collection which date from the time of the first Dutch occupation are nearly all well known, but it is otherwise with a large number of tin coins struck by the Portuguese in Malacca itself; in fact as I said before, it seems doubtful whether any more of these coins exist at the present day. However, the record of the first mint established by Albuquerque in Malacca, as given in his \"Commentaries,\" and quoted below, leaves no doubt as to their identity.\n\nThis mint was the only one ever established in Malacca by Europeans. This was in 1511, immediately after the conquest of the place. In the previous year, 1510, Albuquerque had conquered Goa, and had established a mint there, and as the circumstances under which those two mints were founded were very similar, and since, as will be shown below, the Malacca coins were struck after the same pattern as those in Goa, although not of the same metals, it may be well first to shortly narrate the history of the founding of the mint in Goa.\n\nSoon after Goa had been taken in 1510 the principal Moors and Hindus of the country went to Albuquerque and told him how the trade of the people suffered because there was no proper currency, begging him to coin some money or at least to permit the coinage of the Cabaio, the former ruler, to pass current, which he had forbidden. Albuquerque thereupon called a meeting of the goldsmiths, some Portuguese experts, and the native merchants, and discussed the matter, after which he gave orders for the coinage of money in gold, silver and copper, and on the one side they were to stamp a cross of the order of Christ, and on the other a sphere,\u2014the device of the King D. Manuel. And when the money was ready (March 12th,\n1510), Albuquerque \"gave the word to take the royal flag, and the trumpets and kettle drums, and assemble all the men in the fleet, and ordered Tristao Dega to go and proclaim it; and he went with all this company of people all round the city, and at each proclamation that was made they scattered quantities of the new money over the heads of the crowds, which were great, and they went on proceeding in this manner round the city.\" (Vol. II, p. 191).\n\nWhen a few months afterwards Goa had been retaken by the Moors, and Albuquerque had reconquered it, he established a new mint at Goa (Vol. III, p. 41).\n\nAlbuquerque arrived before Malacca in the middle of June 1511, made the first attack on July 25th, conquered it in August, and then took speedy measures for restoring order in the place. Vinachatu, a rich Hindu merchant, being of the greatest service to him in this matter. Vinachatu and some of the \"Governors of the land\" soon approached Albuquerque and told him what inconvenience the people suffered from the want of a currency, and begged he would give orders for some system of coinage. Albuquerque thereupon called together the merchants, governors, and principal men of the city, and arranged with them that gold, silver, and pewter coins should be struck, substituting thus pewter for the copper coins of Goa and utilizing the natural wealth of tin in the Malay Peninsula. We saw above that the native coinage before the arrival of the Portuguese had been pewter, just as now-a-days coins of that metal are current in Trengganu and Kelantan.\n\nThe gold coin, called Catholico, should weigh a quarter of a tundia which, amongst the Portuguese, was worth a thousand reis. The silver coins, called Malayesses, i.e. Malacca pieces, should have the same value of a quarter tundia. The pewter coins were to be of three different denominations, viz:\n\n1. dinheiro (i.e. money), the smallest coin, equal to two of the previously existing coins of the ruler of Malacca, bearing the sphere of the King D. Manuel,\n2. soldo, equal to ten dinheiros,\n3. bustardo, equal to ten soldos.\n\nA mint was immediately established, and orders were given that under pain of death the old coinage of the King of Malacca\nshould be delivered there to be reminted. When this had been done, and sufficient money had been coined, Albuquerque fixed a day for the proclamation of the new currency, and the principal men of the people met Albuquerque with the Captains, Fidalgos and Cavaliers of the fleet in the fortress to form a procession through the town. The account given of this procession and proclamation is so interesting and picturesque, that I give it literally:\n\n\"There went first, in front of all the people, one of the principal Governors of the City mounted upon an elephant with his castle caparisoned with silk, and carrying in his hands a flag of the arms of the King of Portugal upon a long spear, and behind him went all the people on foot on one side and the other, as it were in procession; and in the midst of these people there went a Moor mounted upon another elephant, likewise caparisoned with silk, making the proclamation; and behind this one came the trumpets; and after them the Governors of the City, and all the Merchants, and principal men thereof; and at the rear of this throng there went Antonio de Sousa the son of Joao de Sousa of Santarem, and the son of Ninachat\u00fa, both together upon a large elephant, which had been kept for the King's own use, with his castle caparisoned with brocaded cloths, and they carried with them a large quantity of gold, silver, and copper * coin, which they kept on throwing out over the heads of all the people at each publication of the proclamation which the Moor made. The crowd was so great that the streets could scarcely contain it, and with many songs and blowing of horns, according to the native custom, the people gave great praise to Afonso Dalboquerque for giving orders for this distribution of money by the advice and in accordance with the opinions of their natives.\" (Vol. III, p. 141). Accounts of this first mint in Malacca are also given by Danvers (5), Vol. I, p. 230, and Stephens (15), p. 162.\n\nBesides these two mints at Goa and Malacca, others were established by the Portuguese in Ceylon, Cochin, Diu, Bassein, Damao and Chaul. The following are the mint marks of six of\n\n* This is probably an error: no copper coins of Malacca are previously mentioned. Probably pewter coins are meant.\nthese towns according to Da Cunha (4), part 1, p. 273; part 3 p. 202; part 4, p. 21.\n\nG or G\u2014A ... ... Goa\nM or M\u2014A ... ... Malacca\nC\u2014LO ... ... Ceylon\nD ... ... Damoso\nD or D\u2014O ... ... Diu\nB ... ... Bassein\n\nFinally the letter A which is found on some coins, is supposed to stand for 'Asia' (see Da Cunha, part 1, p. 271), but 'Albuquerque' has also been suggested.\n\nDa Cunha, the first authority on this subject, alludes to the many difficulties which the study of the coins issued by these mints presents, he states that the coins were issued by the viceroys or even by the officers of the mint in the most capricious fashion, that they frequently bore effigies and legends which had no connection whatever with the reigning monarchs of the periods when they were issued, that some of them were struck years after the kings whose busts they bore, had ceased to live (4, part I, p. 267). Da Cunha continues: \"But these difficulties are increased tenfold by an absolute want of examples of the early periods of the Portuguese rule in India, their place being but inefficiently supplied by some written official reports and private memoirs. The coins of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are not only scarce, but even the written documents relating to them are rare or deficient.\" To Valentyn (16) they seem to have been entirely unknown. Millies (15), p. 110, says: \"Un des monuments m\u00eame de la victoire du grand Alfonso d'Albuquerque, la monnaie qu'il fit frapper \u00e0 Malaka, a tellement disparu, que nous n'avons nullepart pu en d\u00e9couvrir un exemplaire.\"\n\nBirch (2), in a footnote to Albuquerque's 'Commentaries,' Vol. II, p. 130, refers for descriptions of the earliest Portuguese coins to the works of De Faria (6) and Fernandes (8) and states that \"the coins themselves are so rare that they may almost be described as no longer extant,\" and that those writers had not figured any of them. I have not been able to see the works of De Faria and Fernandes, but I am glad to say that the collection unearthed in Malacca does contain some of those earliest\n\nJohn Alfred Brench\nCOINS FROM MALACCA.\n\ncoins, in fact some of them may be the identical specimens which Albuquerque threw out over the heads of the admiring crowd during his procession and the proclamation of the new coinage ni Malacca in 1511.\n\nThe oldest specimens are three coins in excellent condition belonging to the reign of King Emmanuel who was reigning when Malacca was captured. Their diameter is 30 mm. = 1\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) in., their weight 10.3 to 10.8 grammes, and they are probably bastardos. They bear on the obverse the Portuguese coat-of-arms, and around it the inscription:\n\n**EWANVEL: R: P: ET: A: DOVINE.**\n\nThe second and fourth letters of the first word are inverted, and the last word, consisting of five or six letters, is less distinct than the rest. It might stand for DOMINE. The meaning of the other letters is of course \u2018Emanuel Rex Portugali\u00e6 et Algarbiorum. The Algarves were first conquered by the Portuguese about 1188, and their name is still mentioned on the coins of the present day. The reverse of the coin bears the sphere, the \u201cdevice of the King D. Manuel,\u201d like the coins struck at Goa. The device of the sphere, by the way, is used as a symbol of the glorious world-wide conquests of Portugal (see pl. I, figs. 2 and 2a).\n\nAlbuquerque died off Goa on Dec. 16th 1515, and King Emmanuel in 1521. From the reign of the next king, John III, 1521-1557, between fifty and sixty coins are in the collection. The first kind, probably the Soldo (size 24 mm. = \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) in; weight 3.2 to 3.9 grammes), is of a very clear stamp, bearing on the obverse a cross, and around it the inscription\n\n**IOA: III: POR: ET: AL: R.,**\n\ni.e. Ioannes III Portugali\u00e6 et Algarbiorum Rex, on the reverse the usual sphere. This tin coin therefore tallies exactly with the description of the gold, silver and copper coins struck at Goa, which bore on the one side \u201ca cross of the Order of Christ, on the other a sphere\u2014the device of the King D. Manuel.\u201d Of this coin there are only three specimens (pl. II, figs. 9 and 9a)\n\nAnother kind, of which there are fifteen specimens, resembles this last in all details except that it is of a much ruder make and that the cross is slightly different: thus\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 59, 1903.\nOf a smaller size of this coin, possibly the Dinheiros, there are about forty specimens, some in excellent condition. Size 19mm = \u00be in; weight 2 to 2.3 grammes. The obverse bears around the cross the inscription\n\nIOA III POR ET. AL.\n\nThe reverse has the sphere (pl. II, figs. 10 and 10*).\n\nThere are some coins which on the obverse round a coat-of-arms merely bear the inscription.\n\nIOANNES. R. P. ET. AL. D. G.,\ni.e. Ioannes Rex Portugalie et Algariorum Dei Gratus, and on the reverse the sphere. Although not clearly assigned to the reign of John III, still there is no reasonable doubt that they too belong to his time, and not to that of John IV, 1640-1656, during the second year of whose reign Malacca was lost to the Portuguese, nor to the time of John V, 1706-1750. There are about twenty specimens of it, but most of them in a very indifferent condition. Size 24 mm. - 1\u00bd in; weight 6.9 to 6.4 grammes. (pl. II, figs. 8 and 8*).\n\nA smaller coin, of which there are two specimens, has on the obverse a cross, with the letters I S M A in the four angles of the cross, and on the reverse again the sphere. These letters probably stand for 'Ioannes, Malacca,' shewing that the coin was struck at Malacca during the reign of a King Ioannes, probably again John III. The cross is very like the cross on certain coins figured by Da Cunha (part 1, pl. I, figs 3, 4 and 7) from the mints of Goa and Diu and belonging apparently to the eighteenth century. Size 17.5 mm. - 1\u00bc in; weight 3.8 to 3.9 grammes (pl. II, figs. 13 and 13*).\n\nBelonging probably to the reign of the next king, Sebastian, 1547-1578, there are six specimens of a large coin which has on the reverse the two letters S. B. with three crossed arrows between them, and on the reverse the coat of-arms. The S. probably stands for 'Sebastian', and the letter B. may stand either for\n\nJoaq. Straits Branch\nfor 'Bassein,' one of the mint towns, or for 'Bastardo,' the name of the largest tin coin. The arrows are symbolic of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian after whom the king was called. The size of the coin is 90 mm. = 1\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) in; weight 11.3 to 11.9 grammes (pl. I, figs. 4 and 4a).\n\nAnother coin, which very probably also belongs to this reign, bears on the obverse the letters B and A, with three crossed arrows between them, and on the reverse the sphere. The coin is too small for the letter B to stand for 'Bastardo,' and it is probably the mint mark of Bassein, whilst the letter A may stand either for 'Asia' or 'Albuquerque' (see above p. 190). The three crossed arrows show that the coin was struck during the reign of Sebastian, like the previous coin, and the two dots above them probably indicate its value in dinheiros. Eight specimens were found: size 17 mm. = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.; weight 3.5 to 3.7 grammes (pl. II, figs. 12 and 12a).\n\nThe coin pictured on pl. I, fig. 1, of which there is only one specimen, was probably struck at Goa, as its obverse bears a device very like the wheel, the symbol of the martyrdom of St. Catherine, the patron saint of Goa. This wheel is often found on coins struck at Goa, as it commemorates the conquest of Goa by the Portuguese on St. Catherine's Day, November 25th, 1510. Its reverse is entirely smooth. Size 27 mm. = 1\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) in.; weight 8.9 grammes.\n\nA small coin, represented by five specimens, shows on the obverse a coat-of-arms, and on the reverse a ship, but no inscription whatever. Size 18 mm. = \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in.; weight 2.2 to 2.4 grammes (pl. I, figs 6 and 6a).\n\nA considerably larger coin shows on the obverse the coat-of-arms, and on the reverse the sphere, but has no inscription either. There are five specimens of it. Size 28 mm. = 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.; weight 10 to 11.2 grammes (pl. I, figs. 3 and 3a).\n\nFinally there is a coin represented by only one specimen showing on the obverse a small coat-of-arms surrounded by large and deeply impressed Roman letters, and on the reverse the sphere. Notwithstanding that the letters are deeply impressed and only little worn, they are so very rough, that my efforts to decipher them have not been successful. Size 24 mm. = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.; weight 3.7 grammes (pl. II, fig. 7).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 29, 1903.\n2. The Dutch, French and English Coins.\n\nThe Dutch during their possession of Malacca (1641-1795, and 1818-1824) never minted any coins especially for that place, but naturally used the coinage current in Java. That island has changed its rulers several times since the end of the sixteenth century, viz:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1594-1602 &: \\text{ Compagnie van Verre te Amsterdam.} \\\\\n1597-1602 &: \\text{ Compagnie van Verre te Middleburg.} \\\\\n1602-1799 &: \\text{ Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie} \\\\\n1800-1807 &: \\text{ Batavian Republic.} \\\\\n1807-1811 &: \\text{ French Government.} \\\\\n1811-1816 &: \\text{ British Government.} \\\\\n1816 &: \\text{ Dutch Government.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nCoins belonging to four of these epochs were discovered at Malacca.\n\nThe two Companies van Verre seem to have issued silver coins only, but none are in the collection.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company issued gold, silver and copper coins. The first copper coins were minted in 1644, but in the Malacca collection which contains no gold or silver coins, the earliest copper coins date from 1729. From the fact that the earliest copper coin figured by Netscher and Chijs (13) dates from 1726 we may conclude that still earlier ones are rare in numismatic collections.\n\nThe Batavian Republic issued gold, silver and copper coins, but the collection does not contain any. The Raffles Museum, however, possesses a copper coin of that period. The obverse shows the Dutch coat-of-arms consisting of a crowned shield enclosing a lion rampart, with the figures 5 and \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) to the right and left of the shield respectively. The reverse bears the inscription INDIAE BATAV. 1802.\n\nThe French Government issued silver and copper coins, and two of the latter were found at Malacca.\n\nThe British Government issued gold, silver, copper and lead coins during its occupation of Java, but the Malacca collection contained none of them. The Raffles Museum, however, possesses silver Rupees of the years 1812 and 1816, half Rupees of 1813, copper Stuivers of 1814, half Stuivers of all the years\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nCOINS FROM MALACCA.\n\n1811 to 1815, copper Duits of the years 1811 to 1813 and lead Duits of 1814.\n\nThe Dutch Government of Java has so far issued no gold coins. The first silver coins, Guilders, seem to have been struck in 1821, the first copper coins in 1817 or 1818. The Malacca collection contains four copper coins.\n\nIn addition to coins current in Java also some of the well-known tokens issued by British merchants and traders in Sumatra were found, further some coins struck by the British East India Company for Penang, and finally a coin from India and one from Holland.\n\n(a). Coins of the Dutch East India Company (1602-1799.)\n\nMost of the coins issued by this Company bear the monogram VC, formed of the letters V. O.

Coins identical with it, except for the date, were issued by the Batavian Republic previous to the English occupation of Java, and by the Dutch Government after the English occupation, and the Raffles Museum contains such coins of the years 1802, 1818, 1819, 1821 and 1824. But the Museum also contains a coin of 1815, that is a coin struck in Batavia with the Dutch coat-of-arms during the time of the English rule. Therefore it is just\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\npossible that the above coin of 1816, found at Malacca, may also have been struck under English rule. I cannot offer any explanation of this.\n\nA coin of this kind, but of the year 1802, is figured by Netscher and Chijs, pl. VI, fig. 39. The figures '5' and '16', to the right and left of the shield respectively are somewhat mysterious.

That the monsoon has been an exceptionally favourable one for insects is shown also by the following occurrences:\u2014(1) The number of swarms of social wasps and bees has been greater than usual during the past 3 months. (2) Captain A. Balser of the s.s. \"Rajah of Sarawak\" reports that on the 20th January ult., a swarm of dragon flies came aboard his ship when about 50 miles west of the island of St. Pierre; the wind was very unsteady at the time; the insects appeared to be making their way North. (3) Mr. H. B. Crocker, officer-in-charge at Paku, Upper Sarawak, informs me that on January 27th ult., he noticed a swarm of some Pierine butterflies (species not identified, probably Catoptria crocata, Cram.) flying in a solid phalanx some 20 fathoms long by 8 fathoms wide in a westerly direction.\n\nR. Shelford.\n\nWork on Sakais by Messrs. Skeat and Blagden.\n\nIn a letter from Mr. Blagden lately received he states that the important work on the wild tribes of the Malay peninsula by Mr. W. D. Skeat and himself will shortly be out. It is an attempt to combine in one work all that is of any permanent value in previous publications both books and periodicals, as well as Mr. Skeat's own independently collected matter collected during the Cambridge Exploring Expedition, in the Northern States of the Peninsula and in Selangor, Mr. Blagden's own notes, and the various information collected by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey, Hugh Clifford, Vaughan Stevens and others. The book which will be well illustrated will be found to be as complete as it is possible to make it, and should prove of the greatest interest to all Europeans in the Malay peninsula. It is unnecessary to point out that in many cases the language and customs of these most interesting tribes are gradually disappearing so that a good record of them is of the greatest importance, and the names of the authors are a guarantee of the excellence of the work.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nJour Straits Branch\nA Buddhist Votive Tablet.\n\nSome years ago the late Mr. H. Vaughan Stevens discovered in K\u00e9dah in a cave, nine feet below the floor, a number of fragmentary clay tablets stamped with inscriptions. These he forwarded to the Singapore Museum, where they now are, accompanying them with a letter explaining where he had found them.\n\nBy the courtesy of the Curator I have been enabled to submit a photograph of the largest and best preserved of these tablets to Professor Kern of Leyden, who in reply to my request was good enough to examine it and wrote as follows:\u2014 \"After repeated attempts I have given up the hope of deciphering the whole. The writing is N\u0101gar\u012b of the 10th century, approximately, and therefore the tablet is from Northern India. At the top I discern parts of the well known Buddhist formula:\n\nye dharma hetu prbha, etc.,\n\nThe first line shows hetuprabha; the second s\u0101mi hetu-lath\u0101ga-; the third teadam . . ca (?) go nirotha-; the fourth . . r\u0101di manah sarve; the fifth sans K\u0101r\u0101. Further I can distinguish some letters, but without being able to make out an intelligible context. Most probably the whole tablet is filled up with the common formula of the Buddhist creed.\"\n\nThe formula here referred to is clearly the one which occurs also in certain other inscriptions found in K\u00e9dah and Province Wellesley, which will be found in Indo-Chinese Essays, Series I, Vol. 1. These were dealt with by Professor Kern, in Verslagen en Mededeelingen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen, Afdeeling Letterkunde, 3de Reeks, Deel 1. He assigns them to the period 400 A.D. These however are in a South Indian form of alphabet (and from such form the existing Far Eastern alphabets are in the main derived), whereas the clay tablet now dealt with points to influences from Northern India.\n\nEvidently, therefore, both Northern and Southern India have contributed something towards the civilization of the Malayan regions.\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 38, 1903.\nI take this opportunity of pointing out, as regards the date to which this Indian influence can be traced, the following few acts:\n\n(1) In the 2nd century, Ptolemy gives Indian place names to several of the islands of the Archipelago, notably Java, which he calls Iabadios i.e. Yava-dvipa \"the island of Java\" (or the island of millet,\" if that is what the name meant) as well as to certain ports on the coast of Indo-China and the Peninsula.\n\n(2) Early in the 5th century, Fa-Hian going from Ceylon to Java, finds in the latter island \"heretical Brahmans, but no Buddhism worth mentioning.\" He was a Buddhist pilgrim himself and stayed five months in Java and after spending some years in India, so he may be supposed to know what he was talking about.\n\n(3) Late in the 7th century I. Tsing, another Chinese Buddhist, found Buddhism (of the Sanskrit-using variety) flourishing in South-eastern Sumatra.\n\nThe inscriptions found in the Peninsula, though few in number and of little intrinsic interest, supply further links in this chain of evidence, and negative Mr. Hugh Clifford's assertion (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica supplement s. v. Malays) that the traces of Hindu influence do not extend to the Peninsula. They are only fainter there than in Java and Sumatra, not absent altogether.\n\nUnquestionably Indian influence was by far the most potent of the forces which have led the Javanese and Malays to such civilization as they have attained. It has made a far deeper impression upon them than the Arab and European teaching by which it has been succeeded.\n\nC. O. Blayden.\nA new Balanophora from Tenimber Islands.\n\nWhen Mr. H. O. Forbes visited the Tenimber islands in 1882, he obtained among his collections, specimens of a Balanophora which however perished in the disastrous conflagration by which the greater part of his collections were destroyed. No other person has since visited this group with a view of collecting botanical specimens though Orchid collectors have lately taken to exploring the spot usually for the sake of the beautiful *Dendrobium Phalaenopsis*. Mr. Micholitz during a recent visit came across the *Balanophora*, and brought a quantity of it preserved in Formaline which he has kindly given me, and I may here remark that this seems to be about the best way of preserving these fleshy plants. If preserved in ordinary spirit, not only does the spirit become black, though often changed, but the plants which are ordinarily red, yellow or white also become black. The specimens in formaline retain to a considerable extent the yellowish white color which they possessed in life.\n\n*B. Micholitzi*, n. sp.\n\nRhizome rather small about $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch through, rounded and shortly lobed, minutely irregularly pustulate. Stems two or three on a rhizome, 2 inches tall thick, leaves about 8. orbicular to orbicular ovate, apex rounded $\\frac{1}{2}$ an inch long, $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch wide white.

Flowers obconic clavate, apex rounded tessellate, spadics numerous nearly as long as the pistil, base and apex slender filiform centre swollen.\n\nThis plant is nearly allied to *B. Zollingeri* Fawcett, Trans. Linn. Soc. Ser. ii. Vol. ii. p. 234. Plate 34 figs 11-14 which was collected by Zollinger in the island Salayer, south of Celebes. It is however much larger in all its parts, and the female flowers are more club shaped with a longer stalk armed with large well developed spadics.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nOn the supposed evil influence exercised by ghosts in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nSome four years ago when I was engaged in certain prospecting operations in the highlands of Pahang on the borders of that State with Perak, I had occasion to make a somewhat lengthy stay at a place called Kampar on the Tu\u00e9 river, one of the tributaries of the Betok, in its turn a tributary of the Jelai, the principal feeder of the Pahang River. I selected this spot because it had already been cleared of large trees and had only recently been in occupation as a Sakai Settlement, from the remains of which, we reared our unpretentious little camp. The Sakais however strongly advised us to go elsewhere alleging that this place was haunted by elephant ghosts and that they had been the direct cause of a number of deaths among them, principally among their children, whose remains lie buried there. It is necessary to explain that at the back of this place, not fifty yards away, is to be seen one of those peculiar muddy pools which animals of all kinds frequent for their saline properties, this particular one being known as the Kubang Gajah Hantu (the mud pool of the ghostly elephants). These salt licks are also known as gents in Malay. When the Sakais refer to this place it is usually with bated breath and a mysterious and awesome gesture. These men declared that almost nightly elephants are seen and heard breaking twigs and branches and wallowing in this mud pool, and yet in the morning, not a vestige of their spoor can be seen anywhere. Of this I am certain, the prints of deer and pigs were always plentiful and fresh, but no elephant could have been within miles of the place during my residence in that locality. My mandor's wife, an oldish person, who always followed her husband in his journeys doing the cooking for my followers, declared that the first night we slept there, she and all my men heard continued long drawn wails, like a long weee-\u00ea-\u00ea-\u00ea which went on without intermission until almost daylight. This noise they said came from those Sakai children buried there.\n\nThis account is interesting from an ethnological standpoint in so far as it illustrates the beliefs and superstitions of a race of very primitive people. As for the number of children dying\n\nJoan Struitt Branch\nat the time, this would only seem natural when it is remembered that an epidemic of measles was then and had been for some time after raging.\n\nA. D. Machado.\n\nMalay Witchcraft.\n\nTowards the end of 1901 while I was in charge of a country district in Alor Gajah, complaints were made to me of a certain Pawang Musah who was said to bewitch children by means of a familiar spirit called a Polong. One man stated that one of his children had died from the effects and that another was affected. As his house was only about a mile from where I lived, I and the colonial surgeon from Malacca, who happened to be with me on one of his periodical visits decided to go and see the child. When we arrived at the house we found a large number of people in the house and lying at one end of the verandah, the child (a little girl of 7 or 8 years old) in a semi-unconscious state. The doctor examined it and found that it was in a high fever and evidently dying. While we were there the father sat down and spoke to the child. She opened her eyes and when asked by the father \"who sent you here and who is your father\" or words to that effect, she replied \"Pawang Musah.\" This was taken by the bystanders to be the voice of the Polong speaking through the child. We were also told that the child had been asked who would be the next victim and had pointed out her older sister a girl of 18 or 19 years old. This girl was examined by the doctor and found to have nothing the matter with her. We assured her she had nothing to fear, and as far as I know she is still alive, at any rate she was alive in February 1902 when I left Malacca. The dying child was suffering from malarial fever, enlarged spleen and starvation and though we sent up stimulants they were of no avail and she died a very few hours after we left. Pawang Musah lived about 2 miles from where the child lived and had a bad reputation as a wizard. He originally came from the other side of Malacca about 30 miles away and had moved about from village to village everywhere getting the credit for the deaths of child-\nren being driven out. I have very little doubt that he traded on the reputation as the people were quite willing to give him anything he asked for through fear that he would otherwise bewitch their children. The explanation appears sufficiently obvious. If any person thought he had in any way offended the Pawang the next case of sickness in his house would in all probability be attributed to him, the illness then being considered supernatural no ordinary remedies would be tried and incantations alone would be used to drive out the evil spirit. The result to the patient is very easy to imagine and as he or she being familiar with the story of the Polong, it is not surprising that the answers given to the well known formul\u00e6 coincide with the suspicion of the relations especially when it is remembered that the patient is a young boy or girl in high fever.\n\nH.
