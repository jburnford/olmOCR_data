MORLEY, M.R.A.S.\n\nPRINTED BY ORDER OF THE COUNCIL\n\nLONDON:\nJOHN W. PARKER & SON, WEST STRAND.\n\nMDCCCLIV.\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\nWith the exception of Grammars and Dictionaries, there is, perhaps, no class of works more calculated to be practically useful to the student of Oriental literature than Descriptive Catalogues of MSS. Mere lists are of small value, even when accurately made, since the names generally given by Eastern authors to their compositions afford but little insight into the nature of their contents; and if, as is frequently the case, the titles of the books are taken merely from the fly-leaves, or the backs of the volumes, such lists are quite as likely to mislead as to furnish a correct guide.\n\nThe description of historical MSS. is of peculiar utility, for, in order that the student of the intricate history of Asia should know where to search for particular facts, or to find the best accounts of special epochs, it is obviously of the utmost consequence that he should have at his command concise but complete tables of the contents of the various works applicable to the period he may wish to investigate. In addition to this it is highly requisite that he should also be informed where copies of such works are to be found, as it is in most cases necessary, and always desirable, to consult more than one MS. of all the various authorities for the ascertainment of a fact. Different copies of the same history often vary materially both in extent and arrangement; the injuries caused by time or accident; the misplacing of leaves by the binders; the constant omission of detached sentences, and even of entire passages; the difficulty of deciphering words, especially proper\nnames; and all the errors arising from the ignorance or carelessness of the transcribers, concur to perplex the reader, and to render it extremely unsafe to trust to a single MS., where more than one can be procured.\n\nIf we were in possession of good catalogues of only half the public libraries in Europe, how much labour in research would be saved to the student, and how great would eventually be the gain to historic truth.\n\nThe historical MSS. preserved in the library of the Royal Asiatic Society are, from their number and character, well deserving the attention of Orientalists. Amongst them will be found a good collection of works relating to India and Persia, together with some others which are both rare and curious. At the desire of the Council of the Society, I have undertaken to give an account of them, confining myself, however, to those in the Arabic and Persian languages.\n\nIn the following pages I have, in the first instance, described each history shortly, and have added some notice of the author where procurable; I have then given the particular contents of each volume,\u00b9 and have mentioned its size and extent, noticing the species of handwriting, and whether it is well written or transcribed in a more or less illegible hand. I have also enumerated the editions of the whole, or of the portions of each work, that have been printed either in text or translation.\n\nThe reader will perceive that I have given the size of the volumes in inches, instead of saying that they are in folio, 4to, &c. Eastern paper not being made in a regular series of sizes and folded as in Europe, those terms convey but a very indefinite idea of form when applied to Oriental MSS.; whilst the actual measurement of a volume, together with a statement of the number of leaves, and of the lines in a page, enable us\n\n\u00b9 I believe that the tables of contents which I have given are sufficiently equal, and that I have not dilated too much when describing the works of my favourite authors. When a whole dynasty is dismissed in a page, or less, as is often the case, I have merely mentioned the name of such dynasty; and the reader may conclude that the account of it in the work described is unimportant.\nto form a tolerable estimate as to the extent of a work. I have also departed from the practice too often observed in catalogues in describing the external appearance and the exaration of MSS. The main points to be remarked are, the species and degree of legibility of the handwriting, the state of a MS. when damaged, the existence of lacun\u00e6, and the misplacing of leaves by the binder. The elaborate notices of the illuminations, the gold and red and blue lines, the silk paper, &c., &c., with which works of the present nature are generally overloaded, seem to me to be so much space wasted, and should, I think, be abandoned to the tradesman who seeks to give a false value to his goods by bombastic description. If, therefore, I have at any time adverted to a volume as \"beautifully written,\" or \"finely illuminated,\" it must be understood as denoting that such volume presents a peculiarly good specimen of calligraphy or ornament. The names of the donors are added at the end of the description of each MS.\n\nNotwithstanding every care, I fear that several errors of the press have escaped my observation.\u00b9 The multitude of proper names and dates\u00b2 occurring in the text render it very difficult, if not impracticable, to avoid oversights; and, had it not been for the kind revision of the last proofs, by my friend Mr. Charles Rieu, of the British Museum, and for which I tender him my best thanks, the typographical faults would have been still more numerous than at present.\n\nJanuary, 1854.\n\nW. H. M.\n\n\u00b9 I trust that few will be found to be of importance. I have added a table of errata to call the reader's attention to the graver faults, but I have not thought it necessary to notice the occasional omission of accents and such like inadvertencies. Even these, however, I believe, are not of frequent occurrence.\n\n\u00b2 I may here mention that in converting the years of the Hijrah into those of our own era, Prinsep's tables have been followed; the year of our Lord given being that in which the Hijrah year commenced.\nCONTENTS.\n\nARABIC.\n\nI.\u2014GENERAL HISTORY ........................................... 1\nII.\u2014PARTICULAR HISTORY ....................................... 13\n\nPERSIAN.\n\nI.\u2014HISTORIES OF MUHAMMAD, HIS COMPANIONS AND IMMEDIATE SUCCESSORS .................. 15\nII.\u2014GENERAL HISTORY ........................................... 17\nIII.\u2014INDIA ............................................................ 58\n   1.

He passed a portion of his life in the service of Ab\u00e1k\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n and his successors, and subsequently, in A.H. 697 (A.D. 1297), was appointed by Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n to the office of Waz\u00edr, in conjunction with Sa\u2019d ad-D\u00edn. The two Waz\u00edrs disagreed, and Sa\u2019d ad-D\u00edn having been put to death at the instigation of Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn, was succeeded in his office by \u2019Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h Jabal\u00e1n. Fresh dissensions soon arose between Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn and the new Waz\u00edr, and \u2019Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h eventually, by his intrigues, procured the condemnation of his colleague from the Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sa\u2019\u00edd, on the charge of having administered poison to Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. The son of the unfortunate Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn was first put to death before his father\u2019s eyes, and the Waz\u00edr was then cloven in twain by the executioner: his property was confiscated, and a large suburb of the city of Tabr\u00edz, which he had built at an enormous expense and called after his name, was given up to pillage and destroyed. Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn was a man\n\n1 H\u00e1j. Khalf., tom. ii. p. 508.\nof immense learning, a profound politician, an accomplished linguist, and an industrious and voluminous writer. His execution took place in A.H. 718 (A.D. 1318).\n\nThe Jami\u2019 at-Tawarikh is the most important of Rashid ad-Din\u2019s numerous works, and indeed is one of the most valuable Oriental histories which we possess.\n\nIn a notice, by the author himself, prefixed to a MS. of his theological works, preserved in the Imperial Library at Paris,\u00b9 and quoted by M. Quatrem\u00e8re in the introduction to the first volume of the Collection Orientale,\u00b2 the Jami\u2019 at-Tawarikh is stated to comprise four volumes, containing as follows:\n\nVol. I. Preface.\u2014Account of the origin of the nations of the Turks, and the number of their tribes. History of the Kings, Khans, Amirs, and great men, sprung from each tribe. The ancestors of Changiz Khan and the history of that monarch\u2019s reign and actions, and of his children and descendants, down to the time of Uljaitu Sultan. To the life of each prince is added his genealogy, an account of his character, of his wives and children, the contemporary Khalifahs, Kings, Sultans, and Atabaks, and the remarkable events which occurred during his reign.\n\nVol. II. Preface.\u2014The life of Uljaitu Sultan, from his birth to the time when the author wrote.\u00b3 History of the Prophets, Sultans, and Kings of the universe, from the time of Adam to that of the author, together with a detailed account of many people, of whom little or nothing had been previously known. This portion comprises the history of the Jews and Christians, and of the Sultans, and most celebrated princes of each country, also an account of the Isma'ilis, &c.\n\nVol. III. Preface.\u2014Account of the descent of the Prophets, Kings, Khalifahs, the Arab tribes, the Companions of the Prophet, &c., from the time of Adam to the end of the dynasty of the Abbassides. The genealogy of the ancestors of Muhammad, and of the tribes descended from them. The Prophets of the Jews, their Kings, and an enumeration of their tribes. The genealogies of the Kaisars and other Christian princes, with their names and the number of years of their respective reigns.\n\n\u00b9 MS. ar. No. 356.\n\u00b2 Collection Orientale. Tome I. Memoire, &c., p. lxxii. Append. p. clix. Fol. Paris, 1836.\n\u00b3 The author here mentions his intention of adding a supplement to this section of his work, to comprise an account of the daily actions of Uljaitu, written by himself and the Court historians.\nVol. IV. Preface.\u2014Account of the limits of the seven climates, the division and extent of the various countries of the globe, the geographical position and description of the greater part of the cities, seas, lakes, valleys, and mountains, with their longitudes and latitudes.\n\nIn the preface to the first volume of the J\u0101mi\u2019 at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, which is dedicated to Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n and called, after him, the T\u00e1rikh-i Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed, the author, however, distributes the subject-matter of his work somewhat differently. He mentions only three volumes, and includes in the second volume the contents of the second and third, as given above. In the preface to the T\u00e1rikh-i Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed the work is divided as follows:\n\nVol. I.\u2014The same as in the preceding description.\n\nVol. II\u2014The history of Ulj\u00e1\u00eft\u00fa Sult\u00e1n (to whom this volume is dedicated), from his birth to the time of the author; this forms the first division of the volume. The second division comprises two parts, the first of which is again divided into two sections.\n\n1. An abridged history of all the Prophets, Khal\u00edfahs, and a description of the various races of mankind, to A.H. 700 (A.D. 1300).\n2. A detailed account of all the inhabitants of the earth, according to their races. The second section of this part is occupied by the remaining portion of the history of Ulj\u00e1\u00eft\u00fa, and was intended to be continued to the time of his death.\n\nVol. III.\u2014A description of geographical charts and various routes between different places.\n\nSuch is the contents of the J\u0101mi\u2019 at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, as given by the author himself. Previously to the year 1838 it was very generally supposed that the first volume, the T\u00e1rikh-i Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed, was the only portion of Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn\u2019s work extant; for although his history is occasionally quoted by Eastern writers as authority for facts not comprised in the T\u00e1rikh-i Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed, yet no MS. of any part of the remainder was known to be in existence. In that year, however, I was so fortunate as to meet with the present curious and interesting volume, and I inserted an account of it in the Journal of the Society.\u00b9 The attention of Orientalists having been thus drawn to the subject, no less than five other MSS., containing either the whole work, or detached portions thereof, were successively brought to light.\n\nFrom a comparison of these MSS. with the author\u2019s descriptions given above, it would seem that the entire work of Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn should comprise the following histories, which were probably thus arranged:\n\n\u00b9 Jour. Roy. As. Soc. vol. vi. p. 11.\nVol. I. General Preface.\u2014An account of the Turks and Mongols to the time of Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. Supplement: The T\u00e1rikh-i Ugh\u00faz, a history of Ugh\u00faz Kh\u00e1n and his successors.\n\nVol. II.\u2014Life of Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, from his birth to the time of the author. History of Adam and his descendants, of N\u00fah and his posterity, of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm and his descendants, of the Prophets, the early Kings of Persia, the Greeks, and the Arabs. A detailed history of Mu\u1e25ammad and the Khal\u00edfahs, to the death of Al-Must\u00e1sim Billah, and the extinction of the Khil\u00e1f\u00e1t. A history of the Ghaznavides, the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00eddes, the D\u00edlamites, and the Buwaihid\u00e9s. History of the Salj\u00faks and the Kings of Kh\u00e1rizm, of the At\u00e1baks of F\u00e1rs, of the Khal\u00edfahs of the Maghrib and Misr, and of the Isma\u2019\u00edl\u00eds. History of Kh\u00edt\u00e1 and the Kings of Ch\u00edn and M\u00e1ch\u00edn. History of the Jews and their Kings. History of the Franks, their Emperors and Popes. History of Hind and Sind and Sh\u00e1km\u00fan\u00ed. A treatise in refutation of the doctrine of Metempsychosis. The latter portion of the life of Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa Sult\u00e1n.\n\nVol. III.\u2014Geographical description of the world.\n\nEach of the above histories is complete in itself, and most of them have separate prefaces, but their order of sequence varies in the different MSS. We do not find in any of the known MSS. the history of Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa\u2019s reign, or the supplementary journal; and the third volume, containing the geographical portion, has not yet been discovered, and probably was never written.\n\nThere appears to be some doubt as to the language in which the J\u00e1mi\u2019 at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh was originally composed, but it seems pretty certain that it was first written in Persian and then translated into Arabic, under the author\u2019s inspection. Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn caused translations of all his Persian compositions to be made into Arabic, and in\n\n1 This supplement is occasionally referred to in the T\u00e1rikh-i Ghaz\u00e1n\u00ed.\n2 Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn wrote the history of the Salj\u00faks to the time of Tughril Ben Arsl\u00e1n, the last of the Salj\u00faks of Persia. A supplement to this section is added in the Calcutta and the East India House MSS., and is also to be found among the Lakhnau fragments, continuing the history, and comprising that of the Kings of Kh\u00e1rizm. A portion of the history of the last-named dynasty is likewise existing in Colonel Baillie\u2019s MS. This supplement seems, therefore, to have formed part of the original work. It was composed by Ab\u00fa H\u00e1m\u00edd Ben Mu\u1e25ammad Ben Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, in A.H. 599 (A.D. 1202).\n3 This treatise is extracted from the Tauz\u00edf\u00e1t-i Rash\u00edd\u00ed; it is only found in the present MS., and in the MSS. of Calcutta and the East India House, but it probably was incorporated into the original work.\nlike manner Persian versions were made of every work written by him in Arabic, in order that his labours might be rendered more generally useful.\\(^1\\) Sir Henry Elliot, however, states that it is certain no Persian copies of the J\u0101mi\u2019 at-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh existed in India in Akbar\u2019s time, since that Emperor directed a translation of it to be made from the Arabic into Persian. Sir Henry adds: \u201cIt does not exactly appear from the text [of Bad\u00e1\u00fan\u00ed] whether this was an abridgment or a translation, but the portion which was completed by Abdu-l-K\u00e1dir is distinctly said to have been translated from the Arabic.\u201d\\(^2\\)\n\nIt will not be out of place here to give a short account of the five MSS. to which I have alluded, and of the circumstances which led to their discovery. They are as follows:\n\nI. A volume (indeed the larger portion of the identical volume of which the present MS. originally formed a part), containing the following fragments of the Arabic version. The history of Persia and Arabia, from the earliest times to the birth of Muhammad, comprising an account of the patriarchs and prophets, and of Alexander the Great and his successors. The genealogy and birth of Muhammad, and the history of his life and of his successors, down to the capture of Baghd\u00e1d, by H\u00fal\u00e1k\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, in A.H. 656 (A.D. 1258). This part is imperfect, but the missing portion is partly supplied by the first seven leaves of the present MS. The history of Persia under the Ghaznaw\u00ed, the Salj\u00fak\u00ed, and the At\u00e1bak dynasties, with an account of illustrious persons of other nations, particularly the Christians. Imperfect towards the end. The history of the Kings of Kh\u00e1rizm. Imperfect at the end. This MS. was found, soon after my discovery, by Dr. Forbes, who gave an account of it in the Journal of the Society.\\(^3\\) The volume formerly belonged to Colonel Baillie, who constituted it an heir-loom, and it is now deposited in the family mansion in Inverness-shire.\n\nII. A MS. in Persian, found by Professor Falconer, in the library of the East India House. Of this MS. I gave a description in the Society\u2019s Journal, where its contents will be found in detail.\\(^4\\) It comprises the whole work, with the exception of Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa\u2019s life, and the geographical volume. This MS. was transcribed in A.H. 1082 (A.D. 1671).\n\nIII. A MS. in Persian, presented to the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Collection Orientale, Tome i.

It was transcribed in A.H. 1098 (A.D. 1686).\n\nIV. A MS. in Persian, formerly belonging to Mr. Rich, who purchased it at Baghdad, in 1818, and now deposited in the British Museum.\u00b2 This volume, which is alluded to by Dr. Dorn, in the preface to his History of the Afghans,\u00b3 was most unaccountably and carelessly mislaid for several years, and was not forthcoming in 1838 when I made inquiry for it. It was eventually found in 1847, at the request of Mr. Thomas, who wished to consult it in furtherance of his numismatic researches. The contents of this MS. coincides with that of the East India House, and the matter comprised is arranged in an almost exactly similar order, the T\u00e1rikh-i Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed, in both MSS., occurring at the end. The treatise on the transmigration of souls is, however, omitted. It is written by different hands, and has no date of transcription. Being stamped in several places with a seal bearing the following inscription \u062d\u0633\u0628\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u062f\n\n\u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0633\u064f\u0644\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0627\u0646, Mr. Rich supposed that it must have belonged to Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa Sult\u00e1n himself,\u2074 who, as is well known, was called Muhammad Khud\u00e1bandah; but as regards the proper name the inscription is vague, the character in which it is written is quite different from that which appears on the coins of the period; and moreover, from the general appearance of the MS., I think that so early a date cannot be assigned to any part of it.\u2075 From\n\n\u00b9 Elliot, Bibl. Index, vol. i. p. 19.\n\u00b2 No. 7628 Addit. MSS.\n\u00b3 History of the Afghans, vol. i. pref. p. xv.\n\u2074 I believe the note on the fly-leaf, in which this is stated, to be in Mr. Rich's handwriting.\n\u2075 Sir H. Elliot speaks of this MS. as written as early as A.D. 1314, four years before the author's death, but he had not, so far as I know, seen the MS. (Bibl. Index. Vol. i. p. 18.) The mere name on the seal might of course apply to any other Sultan Muhammad. It is true that there does not happen to have been any other sovereign than Ulj\u00e1it\u00fa so called, at least in Persia, at the period the Jami' at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh was composed, but the MS. may have made the circuit of Asia between the time when it was written and when purchased by Mr. Rich, and may, meanwhile, have belonged to more than one monarch who bore the Prophet's name, in India or elsewhere. The style of the handwriting on the seal seems\nanother seal on the MS., which is inscribed as follows:\n\n\u0645\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0628 \u062e\u0632\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u062f \u0631\u062e \u0628\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0631\n\nit seems, however, to be certain that the volume was at one time the property of Sh\u00e1h Rukh, son of T\u00edm\u00far. At the head of the preface to the T\u00e1rikh-i Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed, the Bismillah is written in letters of gold in a fine hand; and in the margin, in the same handwriting, are the words \u062e\u064e\u0637\u0651 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0633\u0646\u063a\u0631.\n\nB\u00e1\u00edsanghar was the son of Sh\u00e1h Rukh, and if this Bismillah be his autograph, which there seems no reason to doubt, it is conclusive, and the MS. must have been transcribed previously to A.H. 850 (A.D. 1446), when Sh\u00e1h Rukh died, and was succeeded by his son Ulugh B\u00e9g.\n\nV. Fragments in Persian, deposited in the Royal Library at Lakhnau, and wrongly entitled the T\u00e1rikh-i Sabuktag\u00edn. This MS. contains portions of the history of the Ghaznavides, of the T\u00e1rikh al-Hind wa as-Sind, and of the histories of the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00eddes, the D\u00edlamites, the Salj\u00faks, the Kh\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1h\u00eds, the At\u00e1baks of F\u00e1rs, the F\u00e1timites, and the Isma'il\u00eds. These fragments are without a date, but as they appear to coincide exactly with the present MS., both in the style of the handwriting, and of the paintings by which they are illustrated,\u00b9 it may be fairly inferred that they are of equal antiquity.\n\nmore nearly to resemble that on the coins of the early Safawiyah Kings of Persia; and the seal may perhaps be that of Muhammad Khud\u00e1bandah Ben Tak-m\u00e1sp, the fourth monarch of that dynasty, who was proclaimed King of Persia in A.H. 985 (A.D. 1577), but this is a mere conjecture.\n\n\u00b9 I am enabled to state this with considerable certainty, as Sir Henry Elliot has kindly sent me a traced facsimile of a portion of the Lakhnau MS. The similarity is unmistakeable. I may here mention a curious MS. preserved in the library of the East India Company (No. 132), which is so nearly identical in appearance with the Society's MS., and that at Lakhnau, that it may almost with certainty be assumed that all three were written by the same scribe. The handwriting in the India House MS. is smaller than that in the others, but it bears the same character, and I have no hesitation in asserting that the paintings which illustrate the volumes are from the pencil of one artist. The East India Company's MS. gives the name of the writer in two places, where he signs himself 'Abd al-M\u00famin al-'Alaw\u00ed al-K\u00e1sh\u00ed. It contains the D\u00edw\u00e1ns of six poets, viz.: 1. Am\u00edr Mu'izz\u00ed. 2. As\u00edf ad-D\u00edn Akhs\u00edk\u00e1s\u00ed. 3. Jal\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn Ad\u00edb S\u00e1bar Tirm\u00edz\u00ed. 4. Niz\u00e1m ad-D\u00edn Mahm\u00fad Kamar Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed. 5. K\u00e1z\u00ed Shams ad-D\u00edn Tabr\u00edz\u00ed. 6. N\u00e1s\u00edr Khusr\u00fa Balkh\u00ed. The third D\u00edw\u00e1n is stated to have been transcribed in the last ten days of Muharram A.H. 714 (A.D. 1314); the fifth in Z\u00ed al-Ka'dat A.H. 713 (A.D. 1313), and the last in Z\u00ed al-Ka'dat A.H. 714 (A.D. 1314). This precious volume was formerly the property of Sh\u00e1h Isma'il, the first of the Safawiyah kings of Persia, and is stamped in numerous places with that monarch's seal. If the three MSS. were not written by 'Abd al-M\u00famin they must be looked upon as detached specimens of a style of Oriental calligraphy, unlike anything that has prevailed before or since, either in Persia or elsewhere.\nThe present MS. comprises the following detached portions of the Jami' at-Tawarikh:\n\nI. Fragments of the history of Muhammad and his adherents, relating to the earliest times of the Islam. Imperfect.\n\nII. The concluding portion of the history of Khita, beginning with the eleventh race of Kings, and continuing the history until the time of Shuj\u00fa (Cheou-Siu), the last of the Alt\u00e1n Kh\u00e1ns, of the J\u00fcrjah tribe, who was conquered by Ukt\u00e1i Kh\u00e1n, son of Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, in A.H. 631 (A.D. 1233). Imperfect at the commencement.\n\nIII. The history of Hind and Sind, comprising a short preface and two sections. Section I is divided into eleven chapters. 1. On the different areas of the Hind\u00fas. 2. The measurement of the earth. 3. The mountains and waters of Hind. 4. The countries, cities, and islands of Hind, and the inhabitants thereof. 5. The Sult\u00e1ns of Dihl\u00ed and the genealogies of the Kings of Hind. 6. The birth of B\u00e1sid\u00edv (Vasud\u00e9va); an account of the Kings who reigned after him, to the time of Bh\u00edm P\u00e1l, son of Jaip\u00e1l II.; of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00edn; and of the Gh\u00farides, and the Kings of Dihl\u00ed, to the time of 'Al\u00e1 ad-D\u00edn Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Khilj\u00ed, who ruled when the author wrote this part of his work i.e., A.H. 703 (A.D. 1303). 7. A description of Kashmir, its mountains, waters and cities, with an account of some of its Kings. 8. History of the Kings of Hind who reigned during the Krita Y\u00fag. 9. The Kings during the Tr\u00edt\u00e1 Y\u00fag. 10. The Kings during the Dw\u00e1par Y\u00fag. 11. The Kings during the Kalah Y\u00fag. Section II is divided into twenty-one chapters. 1. Account of the Prophets of Hind. 2. The birth of Sh\u00e1km\u00e1n\u00ed. 3. On the properties and signs of a perfect man. 4. On the disposition, habits, and sayings of Sh\u00e1km\u00e1n\u00ed. 5. On the austerities of Sh\u00e1km\u00e1n\u00ed, and his incorporation with the divine essence. 6. The conclusion of his retirement from the world. 7. Account of the four cycles according to Sh\u00e1km\u00e1n\u00ed.\u2014(Here there occurs a lacuna in the history, in the midst of the seventh chapter; the next two pages are occupied by an account of certain books, and the advantages to be derived from their perusal;\u00b9 and then follows chapter the seventeenth.)\n\n\u00b9 I subjoin a list of these books as given in the present MS.:\n17. The questions put to Sh\u00e1km\u00fan\u00ed by the angels. 18. The information given by Sh\u00e1km\u00fan\u00ed as to another prophet. 19. On Paradise and Hell, and things commanded and forbidden by Sh\u00e1km\u00fan\u00ed. 20. On the establishment of Sh\u00e1km\u00fan\u00ed\u2019s religion in Hind. 21. On the death of Sh\u00e1km\u00fan\u00ed and his last actions.\n\nTo this is added the treatise in refutation of the doctrine of Metempsyehosis, from the Tauzih\u00e1t-i Rash\u00edd\u00ed, to which I have already alluded. The history of Hind and Sind is perfect, with the exception of the lacuna above-mentioned.\n\nIV.\u2014A fragment of the history of the Jews, comprising a short preface and an account of their prophets, patriarchs, and kings, from the creation to the time of Jonah. Imperfect at the end.\n\nIt will be seen that some of the books have specific names, no doubt of Indian origin, whilst others have no title, but merely an indication of the nature of their contents. These titles, where given, being foreign both to the author of the work and the transcriber of the MS., are, in common with all the Indian terms introduced in the history of Hind and Sind, very inaccurately rendered into the Arabic character. I think, however, on comparing them with the names of Buddhist works given by Mr. Hodgson and M. Burnouf (see Asiatic Res. vol. xvi.; Trans. Roy. Asiat. Soc., vol. ii.; and Introduction \u00e0 l\u2019Histoire du Buddhisme Indien, tome i.), we may fairly conclude that the first-named book is the Praj\u00f1\u0101 Par\u00e1mit\u0101; the second the Graha M\u00e1trik\u0101; the third the Pancha Rasha or Raksha; and the fourth the Karanda Vy\u00faha. The others are more doubtful, but the fifth may possibly be a Sangraha. It is to be remarked that this account of the books does not exist in any of the Persian versions (viz., the MSS. of the India House, the British Museum, and of Calcutta, of which last Sir H. Elliot has kindly sent me a transcript: the whole History of Sh\u00e1km\u00fan\u00ed is omitted in\nSir Henry Elliot has published two extracts from the J\u00e1mi' at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh. The first is taken from the continuation of the history of the Salj\u00faks, and the second relates to the Geography of India.\u00b9 The portion of the T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed which contains the life of H\u00fal\u00e1k\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, has also been edited in the original Persian, accompanied by a version in French, by the learned M. Quatrem\u00e8re. This edition is enriched by numerous invaluable notes, and forms the first volume of that truly magnificent publication the \"Collection Orientale.\"\u00b2\n\nFoll. 59. Thirty-five lines in a page. Well written in the Naskh character, but with a constant omission of the diacritical points, and illustrated by one hundred paintings executed in a much higher style of art than is usually to be found in Oriental MSS. In the fragments relating to the history of Muhammad, there is a curious painting of the siege of the fortress of the Ben\u00ed Nuzair, in which there is a portrait of the Prophet. He is represented on horseback, and an angel is hovering over him holding in one hand a flask and in the other a cup. In general, as is well known, Eastern artists refrain from depicting the sacred features of Muhammad, substituting, in place of the head, a flame or glory. Mr. Bland indeed possesses in his inestimable collection, a MS. in which there is a portrait of the Prophet; but, with that exception, this is the only instance I know of\n\nthe Lakhnau fragments), in all of which the chapter containing the questions put by the angels, is numbered as the sixteenth, and not the seventeenth, as in the Arabic version; and that they give only twenty chapters in all, instead of twenty-one. I may add, that the books are not mentioned in the T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i Bin\u00e1kiti (described infra Nos. xiii. xiv.), which is an abridgement of the J\u00e1mi' at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh. The chapters missing in the Arabic version, and supplied by the Persian copies, are eight in number; they immediately follow the seventh chapter on the four eyes, and are numbered respectively from eight to fifteen. They treat almost exclusively of the doctrine of metempsychosis, explaining, amongst other things, the six degrees (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0628) in the transmigration of souls, and detailing the circumstances which govern the degree of a man's future existence, i.e., whether he will reappear in one of the eight hells, in the form of a D\u00edv, as a brute, in the human shape, in that degree which is between mankind and angels, or in that of an angel\n\n\u00b9 Elliot, Bibl.

Having lost his father and mother by the plague in A.H. 749 (A.D. 1348), he entered into the service of the governor of Tunis. In A.H. 784 (A.D. 1382) he quitted that city, and went, first to Alexandria, and from thence to Cairo, where he established himself. The Sult\u00e1n Bark\u00fak appointed him K\u00e1z\u00ed al-Kuz\u00e1t of the M\u00e1l\u00edki sect in A.H. 786 (A.D. 1384), but his firmness in resisting the recommendations and supplications of the grandees of the court caused him to be deposed in A.H. 787 (A.D. 1385). Having been again appointed chief K\u00e1z\u00ed in A.H. 801 (A.D. 1398), the death of Bark\u00fak, which happened soon afterwards, caused him once more to lose his post. He accompanied the Sult\u00e1n Malik an-Nasr Faraj into Syria, and was at Damascus when that city was taken by T\u00edm\u00far, who treated him with the greatest consideration. When T\u00edm\u00far returned to his own country, Ibn Khald\u00fan went back to Cairo. In A.H. 803 (A.D. 1400) he was a third time appointed K\u00e1z\u00ed al-Kuz\u00e1t, and after having subsequently been several times deprived of the office and re-appointed, he died suddenly in A.H. 808 (A.D. 1405) at the advanced age of seventy-six years and twenty-five days.\u00b9\n\nExtracts from Ibn Khald\u00fan have been published by Lanci,\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Silvestre de Sacy, Chrestomathie Arabe, tome i. p. 390, 2me edit.

Other less important divisions and subdivisions of the traditions have been made, classing them according to their respective value and authenticity, or the periods when they were first known or collected.\n\n\u00b2 H\u00e1jj\u00ed Khalfah gives the name of author of the Fut\u00fah A'sam, as Muhammad Ben 'Al\u00ed, known by the name of A'sam al-K\u00faf\u00ed (H\u00e1j\u00ed Khalf. tom. iv. p. 385); he is however called as above in the Persian version, and also in the preface to the Nigar\u00edst\u00e1n of 'Abd al-Ghaff\u00e1r. In different copies formerly belonging to Sir W. Ouseley, the author is named Ab\u00fa Muhammad Ahmad Ben A'sam al-K\u00faf\u00ed, or simply Ahmad Ben A'sam al-K\u00faf\u00ed, as in the text. See Critical Essay on various manuscript works, Arabic and Persian. Translated by J. C. 8vo. Lond. 1832, p. 24, note. Printed for the Oriental Translation Fund.\n\n\u00b3 The present MS. is the only one of the Fut\u00fah A'sam that I have seen, and I am not therefore aware whether it comprises the whole work or merely a portion of it. Dr. Sprenger, however, informs me that the Persian work ends with an account of Hasan and Husain. He also states that it is sometimes called the T\u00e1rikh-i Khul\u00e1s\u00e1 ar-R\u00e1s\u00edhid\u00edn, and that he believes it to be a forgery, as he has never seen it quoted by any respectable Arabic author.\nThe text and translation of some short extracts from this work will be found in Sir William Ouseley's Oriental Collections;\u00b9 they were afterwards republished, with a Latin translation, by Wilken.\u00b2\n\nFoll. 355.

He was celebrated for his great learning, and was pre-eminent in the sciences of the interpretation of the Kur\u00e1n, the Sunnah, Jurisprudence, and History. He was also one of the Mujtahid Im\u00e1ms, as he relied on his own interpretation of the law without reference to the opinions of other doctors, and founded a sect of his own, which however did not long survive him.\u00b3\n\nThe chronicle of At-Tabar\u00ed, as originally written in Arabic, comprised about twenty parts, of which, until very lately, only the third, fifth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth were known.\u2074 Dr. Sprenger has however recently discovered some of the lost portions containing that part of the annals which relates to the origin of the Isl\u00e1m.

In A.H. 352 (A.D. 963) Ab\u00fa S\u00e1l\u00edh Mans\u00far Ben N\u00fah Ben Nasr Ben Ahmad as-S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed, who then reigned in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, commanded his Waz\u00edr Ab\u00fa \u2019\u00c1l\u00ed Muhamm\u00e1d Ben Muhamm\u00e1d Ben \u2019Abd Allah al-Bal\u2019am\u00ed, to translate the Arabic work of At-Tabar\u00ed into Persian. The history was continued by Ab\u00fa Muhamm\u00e1d \u2019Abd Allah Ben Muhamm\u00e1d al-Fargh\u00e1n\u00ed, who entitled his appendix As-Silat, and also by Ab\u00fa al-Hasau Muhamm\u00e1d Ben \u2019Abd al-Mal\u00edk Ben Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Ben Ahn\u00e1d al-Hamad\u00e1n\u00ed, who died in A.H. 521 (A.D. 1127).\n\nIt was likewise translated into Turkish by order of a certain Ahmad P\u00e1sh\u00e1, but by whom, or at what precise period, seems doubtful. Bal\u2019am\u00ed\u2019s version was rendered into the Chaght\u00e1\u00ed language, in A.H. 928 or 938 (A.D. 1521, or 1531), by W\u00e1hid\u00ed al-Balkh\u00ed, the librarian of K\u00fach-k\u00fanj\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the Uzbak; and it was also translated into Arabic by Kh\u00edzr Beu Kh\u00edzr al-Am\u00edd\u00ed, about A.H. 935 (A.D. 1528). The translation by Bal\u2019am\u00ed is curious in a philological point of view, as it is the oldest work in the modern Persian language with which we are acquainted. The style is remarkably easy and simple, and words of Semitic origin are but rarely introduced. Bal\u2019am\u00ed has omitted in his translation the Isn\u00e1ds, or authorities, which are enumerated by At-Tabar\u00ed, and almost all the Arabic verses: he has in addition greatly abridged his original, though at the same time he has added much new matter.\n\nThe Turkish translation was printed at Constantinople, in the year 1844, and many years since M. Dubeux commenced a translation in French of Bal\u2019am\u00ed\u2019s version, the first livraison only of which has been published.\n\nThe present MS. contains Bal\u2019am\u00ed\u2019s Persian translation, and con-\n\n---\n\n1 Taberistanensis Annales regum atque legatorum Dei, ex codice manuscripto Berolinensi Arabice edidit et in Latinum transtulit J.

As this was long after Bal'am\u00ed's death, the continuation must have been added by some other writer.\n\nAl-Bal'am\u00ed has not divided his version in the convenient and systematic manner usually observed by Oriental writers, but has merely separated it into chapters of greater or less length. As the order observed is for the most part chronological, the account of a dynasty or race is thus often split into several portions, between which occur relations of other events. This renders the history before the time of Muhammad somewhat confused, but at the same time the arrangement has the advantage of presenting contemporary occurrences together, or nearly so, and thus obviates the necessity of reference.\n\nContents:\n\nTranslator's Preface.\u00b9\u2014Preface by At-Tabar\u00ed.

He states that, according to that writer, they are called Shansab\u00e1n\u00edyah from one Shansab, who attained great eminence and power among the descendants of Zahh\u00e1k, after the emigration of the latter to Gh\u00far.\n\n2 The author calls Jal\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn the fourth king, and 'Al\u00e1 ad-D\u00edn Mas'\u00fad the fifth. He, however, relates the circumstances exactly as they occurred, the substance being that Jal\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn having left Bamy\u00e1n on an expedition against Ghazn\u00edn, was supplanted by 'Al\u00e1 ad-D\u00edn, who assumed the sovereignty, but that Jal\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn returning shortly afterwards, surprised and defeated his uncle, and slew him. Jal\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn himself was put to death in the seventh year of his reign, by Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1h.\nfrom the time of Saif ad-D\u00edn S\u00far\u00ed, who conquered Bahr\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h Ghaznav\u00ed, to that of Kutb ad-D\u00edn Aibak, who expelled T\u00e1j ad-D\u00edn Yald\u00faz in A.H. 603 (A.D. 1206).\u00b9\n\nBook XX.\u2014The Mu\u2019izz\u00edyah Sult\u00e1ns of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, comprising the history of Kutb ad-D\u00edn Aibak, and of his son Ar\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, whose capital was Dihl\u00ed; of N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Kab\u00e1chah al-Mu\u2019izz\u00ed, and Bah\u00e1 ad-D\u00edn Tughril al-Mu\u2019izz\u00ed,\u00b2 and of the first four Khilj\u00ed princes who reigned at Lakhnaut\u00ed or Gaur, ending with the death of Hus\u00e1m ad-D\u00edn Ghiy\u00e1s ad-D\u00edn, who was defeated and slain by N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Mahm\u00fad Ben Shams ad-D\u00edn Altamish, governor of Bah\u00e1r, in A.H. 624 (A.D. 1226).\u00b3\n\nBook XXI.\u2014History of the Shams\u00edyah Sult\u00e1ns of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, whose capital was Dihl\u00ed, from the time of Shams ad-D\u00edn Altamish, who expelled Ar\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h from the throne in A.H. 607 (A.D. 1210) to A.H. 658. (A.D. 1259), when N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, the seventh King of the dynasty,\u2074 reigned in Dihl\u00ed, and the author completed the present history.\n\nBook XXII.\u2014Account of the most eminent nobles, viceroys, governors, &c., who flourished under the Shams\u00edyah dynasty, from A.H. 625 (A.D. 1227) to the author\u2019s own time, ending with a life of Bah\u00e1 ad-D\u00edn Al\u00fa Kh\u00e1n Balban, who was the Waz\u00edr of N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, and who afterwards, on the death of that monarch, ascended the throne of Dihl\u00ed without opposition.\n\n\u00b9 The account of T\u00e1j ad-D\u00edn, who became independent on the death of Shih\u00e1b ad-D\u00edn Muhammad Gh\u00far\u00ed, in A.H. 602 (A.D. 1205), is here given before that of Kutb ad-D\u00edn Aibak. The former, however, regained his kingdom soon after his expulsion by Kutb ad-D\u00edn, who retired to L\u00e1h\u00far, but was himself driven out a second time by Muhammad Kh\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1h.\n\n\u00b2 On the death of Muhammad Gh\u00far\u00ed, Kutb ad-D\u00edn Aibak became independent in India, and N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Kab\u00e1chah in Mult\u00e1n and Sind. Bah\u00e1 ad-D\u00edn Tughril was occupied in the blockade of the fortress of Gw\u00e1l\u00edy\u00e1r when he died, and the fortress fell into the possession of Kutb ad-D\u00edn Aibak.\n\n\u00b3 This N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Mahm\u00fad was the eldest son of Altamish, and died in A.H. 626 (A.D. 1228.) He must not be confounded with the youngest son of Altamish, who was also called N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, receiving the title of N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn and the government of Bengal from his father on his brother\u2019s death, and to whom, when king of Dihl\u00ed, the author dedicated his work. The first four of the Khilj\u00ed princes were independent; afterwards, Bengal having been conquered by N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn, the governors were appointed from the capital, viz. Dihl\u00ed, until the time of Malik Fakhr ad-D\u00edn, who put to death Kadr ad-D\u00edn, governor of Bengal under Muhammad Tughlak, in A.H. 742 (A.D. 1341), and proclaimed himself independent of the throne of Dihl\u00ed.\n\n\u2074 The author reckons N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, the eldest son of Altamish, as the second of the Shams\u00edyah monarchs; but, as he died in his father\u2019s lifetime, this may not be admitted. N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn, the youngest son, is properly the sixth and not the seventh King of that dynasty.\nBook XXIII.\u2014On the incursions of the infidels; comprising an account of the war between Sult\u00e1n Sanjar Salj\u00fak\u00ed and the tribes of Kar\u00e1 Khit\u00e1; of the conquest of Turk\u00edst\u00e1n, by Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1h, and the defeat and death of G\u00far Kh\u00e1n the Kar\u00e1 Khita\u00edan, in A.H. 607 (A.D. 1210); and of Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n and his descendants, viz.: J\u00faj\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, Ukt\u00e1i Kh\u00e1n, Chaght\u00e1i Kh\u00e1n, Kuy\u00fak Kh\u00e1n, B\u00e1t\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, Mang\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, H\u00fal\u00e1k\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, and Barakah Kh\u00e1n, to A.H. 658 (A.D. 1259).\n\nThe Tabak\u00e1t-i N\u00e1s\u00edr\u00ed is a work of rare occurrence. Although in many portions of the history it is too concise to be of much use, it is exceedingly valuable where it has reference to the intricate history of the Gh\u00farides, and of the Slave Kings of India and their viceroys and governors.\u00b9 So far as it extends, it is the best authority for the events of that interesting period; and a large portion has the additional merit of being the work of a contemporary writer.\n\nFoll. 300.

It is a general history, in nine books, abridged from the J\u00e1mi\u02be at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh of Rash\u00edd ad-D\u00edn by Ab\u00fa Sulaim\u00e1n D\u00e1wud, surnamed Fakhr ad-D\u00edn al-Bin\u00e1kit\u00ed,\u00b2 who composed his work and dedicated it to the Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sa\u02be\u00edd, the ninth Mongol sovereign Persia, in A.H. 717 (A.D. 1317).\n\nVery little is known of the life of Fakhr ad-D\u00edn al-Bin\u00e1kit\u00ed. He was born at Bin\u00e1kit or Fin\u00e1kit, a town in M\u00e1war\u00e1 an-Nahr, afterwards\n\n\u00b9 The history of the Gh\u00farides and the Slave Kings occupies more than one-third of the entire work.\n\n\u00b2 He is called Fakhr al-Binak\u00edt\u00ed in the present MS. H\u00e1jj\u00ed Khalfah calls him Ab\u00fa Sulaim\u00e1n Fakhr ad-D\u00edn D\u00e1wud (Tom. ii. p. 121); and in another place Fakhr ad-D\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Ben Ab\u00ed D\u00e1wud Sulaim\u00e1n al-Bin\u00e1kit\u00ed (tom. iii. p. 499). In a MS. in the British Museum (Addit.

In another MS. in the British Museum (Addit.

Index. vol. i. p. 74.)\ncalled Sh\u00e1hrukh\u00edyah. He was of the Sh\u00ed'ah seet, as may be gathered from his writings. In the reign of Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n he held the office of court poet, and he died in A.H. 730 (A.D. 1329).\u00b9 The T\u00e1rikh-i Bin\u00e1kit\u00ed, to use the words of Sir Henry Elliot, \"till the discovery of the lost portions of the J\u00e1miu-t-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, ranked very high both in Europe and Asia, but it must now take its place as a mere abridgment, and can be considered of no value as an original composition.\"\u00b2 It will however be found very useful as an abridgment, and it is remarkably easy of reference.

In this book the author has added, at the end of the history of each sovereign, an account of the contemporary princes.\n\nA short extract from the first Chapter of Book VII has been published in the original by Sir Henry Elliot.\u00b9\n\nThe whole of the eighth book of the T\u00e1rikh-i Bin\u00e1kit\u00ed was edited in the original with a Latin translation by Andreas M\u00fcller in 1677,\u00b2 and was republished by his son in 1689.\u00b3 The editors erroneously imagined the work to be a portion of the Niz\u00e1m at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, by \u2019Abd Allah al-Baiz\u00e1w\u00ed. The mistake was first pointed out by M. Quatrem\u00e8re, who ingeniously conjectured that the section edited by the M\u00fcllers was part of the T\u00e1rikh-i Bin\u00e1kit\u00ed, although he had not access to a copy of that work.\u2074 He had subsequently the satisfaction of finding that his conjecture was correct.\u2075 An English translation of this same history of Khit\u00e1 is also said to have been made by S. Weston, and published in London in the year 1820.\u2076\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i Bin\u00e1kit\u00ed has been fully described by the Baron Hammer-Purgstall in the catalogue of his MSS.\u2077\n\nFoll. 157.

It is however worthy of some attention, particularly in its latter portions, on account of the author having compiled it from authentic written authorities, hearsay evidence, and personal observation; and from the fact that in\n\n\u00b9 Muzaffar ad D\u00edn Afr\u00e1siy\u00e1b Ben Y\u00fasuf Sh\u00e1h, who submitted to T\u00edm\u00far in A.H. 795 (A.D. 1392), was in fact the last At\u00e1bak of Lur\u00edst\u00e1n, but Ghiy\u00e1s ad-D\u00edn states that he was succeeded by Nusrat ad D\u00edn, 'Izz ad-D\u00edn Pashang, P\u00edr Ahmad, a brother of P\u00edr Ahmad, and the sons of the latter. In the Sharaf N\u00e1mah, described infr\u00e0 No. CLIX, Muzaffar ad-D\u00edn is said to have been reappointed to the government by T\u00edm\u00far, and to have been succeeded by Pashang Ben Y\u00fasuf Sh\u00e1h, Ahmad Ben Pashang, Ab\u00fa Sa'\u00edd Ben Ahmad, and Sh\u00e1h Husain Ben Ab\u00fa Sa'\u00edd, who was slain in A.H. 827 (1423).\nmany instances he mentions from which of such sources he derived his information.\n\nFoll. 145.

He devoted himself, early in life, to literary pursuits, but he never composed anything previously to his introduction to M\u00edr 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00edr, who immediately took him under his protection, and soon afterwards assigned him apartments in the Kh\u00e1nk\u00e1h Akhl\u00e1s\u00edyah, a building which the minister had erected to serve as a retreat and asylum to men of merit distinguished by their attainments. A great portion of M\u00edrkh\u00e1nd\u2019s work was written whilst he was on a bed of sickness, and he has himself given a painful account of his sufferings whilst engaged in completing his history. For a whole year before his death, which occurred in A.H. 903 (A.D. 1493), he gave himself up entirely to religious duties.\u00b3\n\nIt is doubtful whether M\u00edrkh\u00e1nd wrote any part of the seventh volume of the Rauzat as-Saf\u00e1, as some of the events recorded in it took place after his death. M. Jourdain is inclined to think that we owe the whole of the seventh volume to his son Kh\u00e1ndam\u00edr,\u2074 and\n\n\u00b9 H\u00e1j. Khalf. Tom. iii. p. 501.\n\u00b2 For an account of M\u00edr 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00edr, see Silvestre de Sacy, M\u00e9moires sur diverses antiquit\u00e9s de la Perse, p. ix.; Notices et Extraits des MSS. tome iv. p. 246 and 290; Hammer-Purgstall, Geschichte der sch\u00f6nen Redek\u00fcnste Persiens, p. 310; Price\u2019s Retrospect of Mohammedan History, vol. iii. p. 656; Ouseley\u2019s Biographical Notices of Persian Poets, p. 50; Memoirs of Baber, p. 184; Elliot\u2019s Bibl.

Price\u2019s Retrospect, vol. iii. p. 656.\n\u2074 Notices et Extraits des MSS. tome ix. p. 117.\nMajor Price is of the same opinion.\\(^1\\) Sir William Ouseley, however, thinks it likely that Kh\u00e1ndam\u00edr only wrote the latter portion.\\(^2\\) Sir Henry Elliot leaves the question still undecided.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe Rauzat as-Saf\u00e1 is of the very highest authority both in Asia and Europe. Though extremely comprehensive, it omits to mention many dynasties which are found in the works of Kh\u00e1ndam\u00edr and others, to be mentioned hereafter; but it possesses the advantage of being more diffuse and circumstantial; and, in addition, as incidental mention is made of several races of kings without distinct sections being appropriated to them, many apparent omissions are thus partially, though not wholly, supplied.\n\nThe entire text of M\u00edrkh\u00e1nd\u2019s history was published in lithography at Bombay in the year 1848, but I do not know of any copy that has as yet reached this country. A tolerably full description of the Rauzat as-Saf\u00e1, from the pen of M. Jonrdain, will be found in the ninth volume of the Notices et Extraits des MSS. de la Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi; the learned Baron Hammer-Purgstall has also given a detailed account of its contents in the Catalogue of his Oriental MSS.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe present MS. comprises the first volume of M\u00edrkh\u00e1nd\u2019s great work, and contains:\n\nA Preface and Introduction on the utility of history, and the advantages to be derived from its study. An account of the creation of the world and of the deluge. Account of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Kings of Israel, the Virgin Mary, St. John, Jesus Christ, the Seven Sleepers, and St. George. History of the P\u00e9shd\u00e1dian and Kai\u00e1nian Kings of Persia. Account of Alexander the Great and of the ancient philosophers. The Ashk\u00e1n\u00edan, and S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan dynasties, to Yazdajird, the last of the Kings of the race of S\u00e1s\u00e1n.\n\nA translation of the preface is appended to the article in the Notices et Extraits, by M. Jourdain, of which I have already made mention. The text of the history of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00eddes was published by M. Jaubert in 1843, forming part of the Chrestomathies Orientales, printed for the use of the students in the \u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale des langues\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Price\u2019s Retrospect.

In A.H. 909 (A.D. 1503) he was sent on a diplomatic mission by the Sultan Bad\u00ed\u2019 az-Zam\u00e1n, the last of the T\u00edm\u00farides who reigned in Persia, to Khusr\u00fa Sh\u00e1h the chief of Kunduz. He was appointed by the same monarch to be Sadr or chief judge of the civil court. The \u00dazbak T\u00e1t\u00e1rs conquered Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n in A.H. 913 (A.D. 1507), and they in their turn were driven out by Sh\u00e1h Isma\u2019il in A.H. 916 (A.D. 1510). In the midst of this confusion Kh\u00e1dam\u00edr retired from public life, and it seems that it was during this period that he composed the Ma\u00e1sir al-Mul\u00fak, the Akhb\u00e1r al-Akhy\u00e1r, the Dast\u00far al-Wuzar\u00e1, the Mak\u00e1rim al-Akhl\u00e1k, the Muntakhab-i T\u00e1rikh-i Wass\u00e1f, and the greater part, if not the whole, of the Hab\u00edb as-Siyar. In A.H. 933 (A.D. 1526) Kh\u00e1ndam\u00edr left Hir\u00e1t, and in the following year he proceeded to Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, and was introduced to the Emperor Akbar: upon that sovereign\u2019s death he attached himself to his son and successor the Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan; and having accompanied the latter to Gujar\u00e1t, he died there in A.H. 941 (A.D. 1534), aged 61 or 62 lunar years.\n\nThe Khul\u00e1sat al-Akhb\u00e1r contains:\n\nIntroduction.\u2014An account of the creation of heaven and earth, and of the deluge, Ibl\u00eds, and the Jinns.\n\nBook I.\u2014History of the Patriarchs and Prophets, and of the Kings of Israel.

Al-Ghaff\u00e1ri has derived his materials from the most authentic sources; in his preface he enumerates no less than twenty-eight standard works which he consulted, and from which he has extracted his anecdotes.\u00b2 The date of the composition of the Nig\u00e1rist\u00e1n is expressed by the letters of its name, according to the Abjad, viz., A.H. 959 (A.D. 1551).\n\nFrom the nature of this work it would be impossible to give an exact idea of its contents, without enumerating each separate anecdote. This has already been done by M.

He calls the author Muhammad Kam\u00e1l Ibn Isma'il, and states that, though a flatterer, he is considered the best authority.\u00b9 The title of the work, as given above, occurs on the back of the first leaf, but is not mentioned in the short preface, of a few lines only, in which the author names himself Kam\u00e1l Ben Jal\u00e1l, the astrologer. The present MS. belonged to Sir John Malcolm, but I cannot discover any ground for the author's name being as he gives it.\n\nThe Zubd at-T\u00e1r\u00edkh is not systematically divided into books or sections, and the accounts of the dynasties follow each other as nearly as possible in chronological order; many races are, however, only mentioned incidentally, and the author frequently confines himself to a mere list of names. The work is too concise to be of any great utility, but is valuable in that portion which treats of the early Kings of the Safaw\u00ed dynasty.

The date of the composition of this history is expressed by its title, the letters of which form a chronogram, and, according to the Abjad, give the date A.H. 1217 (A.D. 1802).\n\nI have not been able to ascertain any particulars of the life of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, except that he was prime-minister of Sh\u00e1h '\u00c1lam. It is necessary to remark that he must not be confounded with his more celebrated namesake the Naw\u00e1b Sams\u00e1m ad-Daulah Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, the D\u00edw\u00e1n of the Dakhin under Sal\u00e1bat Jang, and the author of the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1.\u00b9\n\nThe contents of the Mir\u00e1t-i \u00c1ft\u00e1b Num\u00e1 is as follows:\n\nIntroduction.\u2014On the advantages of the study of history.\n\nPart I.\u2014Divided into six books, each of which is subdivided into several chapters.\n\nBook I.\u2014An account of the creation, and of created beings and things.\n\nBook II.\u2014History of the Prophets, from the time of Adam to that of Muhammad.\n\nBook III.\u2014The history of Muhammad, of the first four Khal\u00edfs, and of the twelve Im\u00e1ns.\n\nBook IV.\u2014Account of celebrated S\u00faf\u00eds, Darw\u00edshs, and religious men and sects; and biographies of 'Ulam\u00e1 and lawyers, physicians and philosophers, poets and caligraphists.\n\nBook V.\u2014An account of various dynasties. The author in this book gives the names of almost every dynasty that has ruled in the East, but adds little more, and generally dismisses a dynasty with a simple statement of the number of kings. Occasionally, however, we find a concise history of one or more of the most remarkable persons of certain races. This is the case in the following instances, viz.: The P\u00e9shd\u00e1dians.

The biographical part, especially Book 4 of Part I., is, however, very interesting; and the concluding portion of Book 6 is worthy of notice, as one of the sources to be consulted on the curious subject of the music of Asia.\n\nIt is to be observed that there is some discrepancy between the division into Books, &c., of the first Part, in the body of the work, and in the account given of such division in the preface. This discrepancy occurs both in the present volume, and in the only other MS. I have had an opportunity of consulting (Brit. Mus., No. 16,697).\u00b9 For instance, Book 5 of Part I., is called in the Rubrics, Book 6: the actual Book 6, containing the history of T\u00edm\u00far and his descendants, appearing merely as a chapter; and the account of the musicians, which it must be observed is not mentioned at all in the preface, is headed Book 9. The subject-matter, however, follows in the order given\n\n\u00b9 The British Museum MS. was presented by the author to Colonel D.

In the twenty-ninth year of Akbar's reign, Niz\u00e1m ad-D\u00edn was appointed Bakhsh\u00ed of Gujar\u00e1t, which office he held for a long time. He died in A.H. 1003 (A.D. 1594).\n\nThe Tabak\u00e1t-i Akbarsh\u00e1hi is the first work especially devoted to the general history of India, excluding that of other countries, and was compiled by its author from the most authentic sources. Much of the work is very concise, but the first book is particularly important, and full of most interesting detail: it occupies about one-half of the entire history. Firishtah, and other subsequent writers, have borrowed freely from this work of N\u00edz\u00e1m ad-D\u00edn Ahmad.\n\nIn the preface the author gives the following table of contents:\n\nIntroduction.\u2014Containing the history of the Ghaznavides.\n\nBook I.\u2014History of the Kings of Dihl\u00ed.\n\nBook II.\u2014History of the Kings of the Dakh\u00edn.\n\n\\(^1\\) This work is sometimes called the T\u00e1rikh-i N\u00edz\u00e1m\u00ed, by which name it is quoted in the Muntakhab at-T\u00e1w\u00e1r\u00edkh, as well as in the Makhtzan-i Afgh\u00e1n\u00ed. In the Rauzat at-T\u00e1hir\u00ed\u00ed it appears to be called the T\u00e1rikh-i Sult\u00e1n N\u00edz\u00e1m\u00ed.

Sir Henry Elliot, in his description of the Tabak\u00e1t-i Akbarsh\u00e1h\u00ed, reproduces the table of contents from Stewart's Catalogue,\u00b2 but remarks in a note that it contains both more and less than he has seen in other copies. The table of contents given by the author appears, however, to be correct, as it coincides with the MSS. consulted by Sir Henry Elliot, with the present MS., and with several others to which I have had an opportunity of referring,\u00b3 all of which comprise the same matter; the present MS. and one other differing from the rest merely in the order of sequence of the books.\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction.\u2014History of the Ghaznavides, from the time of Sabuktag\u00edn to that of Khusr\u00e1 Malik Ben Khusr\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h, King of L\u00e1h\u00far, who was conquered by Shih\u00e1b ad-D\u00edn Muhammad Gh\u00far\u00ed, in A.H. 583 (A.D. 1187), and was subsequently put to death by his order.\n\nBook I.\u2014History of the Kings of Dihl\u00ed, from the time of Shih\u00e1b ad-D\u00edn Muhammad Gh\u00far\u00ed; comprising: The history of Kutb ad-D\u00edn Aibak.

The portion of the present MS., which relates to Akbar, is exceedingly faulty, omissions are frequent and considerable, and it ends abruptly; taking up the thread of the narrative, without a break in the line, in the midst of the account of the Shaikhs. In addition to these imperfections the leaves in this part of the volume have been misplaced by the binder.\n\n\u00b2 Firishtah places his submission in A.H. 978 (A.D. 1570), and says that he reigned seventeen years: the Mir\u00e1t al-\u2019\u00c1l\u00e1m agrees with the Tabak\u00e1t-i Akbarsh\u00e1h\u00ed.\n\n\u00b3 Firishtah says that D\u00e1wud was slain in A.H. 933 (A.D. 1575), and the Mir\u00e1t al-\u2019\u00c1l\u00e1m gives the chronogram \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0632\u062f\u0627\u06cc \u0631\u0641\u062a which fixes his death in the same year.\nfrom the commencement of A.H. 784 (A.D. 1382),\u00b9 the time of the accession of Kh\u00e1jah Jah\u00e1n ash-Shark\u00ed, the first independent King of Jaunp\u00far, to the extinction of the monarchy in A.H. 881 (A.D. 1476), when Sult\u00e1n Husain Ben Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h Shark\u00ed was defeated by Sikandar Ben Buhl\u00e1l, King of Dihl\u00ed.\n\nBook VII.\u2014History of the Muhammadan Kings of Kashmir, from A.H. 715 (A.D. 1315) to A.H. 992 (A.D. 1584): that is, from the time of Shams ad-D\u00edn Sh\u00e1h M\u00edr, to the period when Y\u00fasuf Sh\u00e1h agreed to pay tribute to the Mongol Emperor.\n\nBook VIII.\u2014History of Sind, from A.H. 86 (A.D. 705), but more especially of the J\u00e1m\u00ed and Argh\u00fan\u00edyah dynasties, to the submission of M\u00edrza J\u00e1u\u00ed B\u00e9g to Akbar, and the final annexation of the whole province to the Mongol empire, in A.H. 1001 (A.D. 1592).\n\nBook IX.\u2014The history of Mult\u00e1n, from the Muhammadan conquest by Muhammad K\u00e1sim, but more particularly of the independent monarchy established by Shaikh Y\u00fasuf, in A.H. 847 (A.D. 1443) to the time when that province was annexed to the Mongol empire.\n\nConclusion.\u2014A concise statement, comprised in a few lines, of the area of Akbar\u2019s empire, the number of cities and villages therein, and of its revenue.\n\nShort extracts from the Tabak\u00e1t-i Akbarsh\u00e1h\u00ed have been published by Sir H.

Twenty-one lines in a page. Well written in a small Nasta\u02bfl\u012bk hand. The present MS. is imperfect in many places, and is very deficient in the portion relating to the reign of Akbar, which terminates abruptly.\u00b3 It is, moreover, difficult of reference, from the leaves having been misplaced by the binder, and from the entire omission of the rubrics after fol. 283.\n\nSize 9\u00be in. by 4\u00be in.

He wrote numerous works on various subjects, amounting altogether to more than one hundred.\u00b9 I have not been able to ascertain the year of his death, but Sir Henry Elliot, quoting the P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah of \u2019Abd al-Ham\u00edd L\u00e1h\u00far\u00ed, says that \u201cin the year 1047 H., although he was then ninety years old, he is said to have been in full possession of his faculties, and to have employed himself in religious duties, in instruction and composition, as vigorously as if he had been still a young man.\u201d\u00b2\n\nThe T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i Hakk\u00ed is too concise to be of any great utility, but that portion which is drawn from extraneous sources is taken from the best authorities; and as the remainder depends upon verbal information and the personal observation of the author, it is worthy of notice. It may, however, be considered as superseded by the Zubdat at-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, which is a second and enlarged edition of the work of \u2019Abd al-Hakk, by his son Shaikh N\u00far al-Hakk al-Mushr\u00e1k\u00ed al-Dihlaw\u00ed al-Bukh\u00e1ri. I have not met with this latter work, but Sir Henry Elliot states that it commences with the reign of Kutb ad-d\u00edn, and ends with the close of Akbar\u2019s reign, which is copiously abstracted from the Akbar N\u00e1mah, and comprises one-half of the entire history of the Dihl\u00ed emperors.\u00b3 The present MS. is the only copy of the T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i Hakk\u00ed that I have seen; there is a lacuna between the second and third leaves, and the author\u2019s name does not appear.

General Briggs says that he was born at Astar\u00e1b\u00e1d, about A.D. 1570, and supposes that he died in A.D. 1612.\u00b2 M. Mohl, however, places his birth in A.D. 1550,\u00b3 and thinks that he revised his work at least up to A.D. 1623.

I must add, that in the MS. described infr\u00e0, No. XLIX., it is stated that the author corrected the history of the Bar\u00edd-sh\u00e1h\u00eds of Bidar to A.H. 1036 (A.D. 1626), when Bar\u00edd Sh\u00e1h was in bondage at\ninelines to the opinion of M. Mohl as regards Firishtah's birth. Firishtah, in his younger days, held considerable offices under Murtaza Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h of Ahmadnagar, and enjoyed the favour of his successor M\u00edr\u00e1n Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h; subsequently to the death of the latter, he left Ahmadnagar and proceeded to Bij\u00e1pur, where he arrived, as he himself tells us in his preface, in A.H. 998 (A.D. 1589). Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm '\u00c1d\u00edl Sh\u00e1h, shortly after his arrival, persuaded him to undertake his history, which he did accordingly, and dedicated it to his sovereign and patron, in A.H. 1018 (A.D. 1609). He mentions in the preface no less than thirty-five works which he consulted in the composition of his history.\u00b9 The T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i Firishtah is remarkable for its impartiality; but as the author was a Sh\u00ed'ah it is somewhat tainted with prejudice against the Sunnis. Sir Henry Elliot observes that he does not even flatter the prince in whose reign he lived; a rare excellence in Muhammadan historians.\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction \u2014 On the \u00c6ras of the Hind\u00fas.

In the Mir\u00e1t-i Ahm\u00e1di, the death of Malum\u00fad is said to have happened in the early part of A.H. 938 (A.D. 1531), but the Tabak\u00e1t-i Akbarsh\u00e1h\u00ed and the T\u00e1rikh-i Hakk\u00ed place it in A.H. 937 (A.D. 1530), as does also Firisht\u00e1l in that portion of his work which relates to the history of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\u2074 See supra, p. 60, note 2.\n\u2075 Firisht\u00e1l states that Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the last of the F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00eds, was subsequently sent to Akbar\u00e1b\u00e1d, where he was maintained by the Emperors Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr until his death in A.H. 1033 (A.D. 1623).\nthe S\u00famarahs and S\u00famanahs, or J\u00e1m\u00ed dynasty of Sind; and of the Argh\u00fan\u00edyah dynasty; from A.H. 87 (A.D. 705) to the death of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad Kh\u00e1n of Bhakar in A.H. 982 (A.D. 1574) and the annexation of Sind to Akbar\u2019s empire in A.H. 1003 (A.D. 1592).\n\nBook IX.\u2014History of the Kings of Mult\u00e1n, from the conquest by Muhammad K\u00e1sim, until Mult\u00e1n became a province of the Mongol empire in the reign of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan.\n\nBook X.\u2014Account of Kashmir and the history of that province, from the introduction of the Isl\u00e1m, under Sh\u00e1h M\u00edr Shams ad-D\u00edn, to its annexation to Akbar\u2019s empire, in A.H. 995 (A.D. 1586).\n\nBook XI.\u2014Account of the Muhammadans in Malab\u00e1r.\n\nBook XII.\u2014Account of the Saints of India.\n\nConclusion.\u2014An account of the climate and geography of India.\n\nThere is some discrepancy as to the division of the books in the various MSS. of Firishtah, which I have consulted.\u00b9 In the prefaces to all the MSS. I have seen, the books are mentioned as twelve in number, and their subjects are enumerated in the present MS. and four others.\u00b2 In all these prefaces, and in that to the text edited by General Briggs, the history of the Kings of Mult\u00e1n precedes the history of Sind, but in the body of the work, in each instance, the order as given above is observed. In all the MSS. but one,\u00b3 the history of Sind is divided into two books, the former containing the Rulers of Sind, &c., and the latter the J\u00e1m\u00ed and Argh\u00fan\u00edyah dynasties, which would make thirteen books. The books, however, are in such cases always falsely numbered. In the present MS. the history of Kashmir and the account of Malab\u00e1r, are both called Book XI.; and, in the old MS. of the India House,\u2074 the histories of the J\u00e1m\u00ed dynasty and of the Kings of Mult\u00e1n are both headed as Book IX., as is likewise the case in the MS. next following. The MS. described below (No. L.) divides the history of Sind into two books, and numbers them as VIII. and IX., and so goes on, heading the account of Malab\u00e1r as the Twelfth Book, omitting the account of the Saints, and the Conclusion. In my own complete MS. the numbering is even still more defective.\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i Firishtah is called the Gulshan-i Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u00ed, and the\n\n\u00b9 That is, MSS. of the entire work.

General Briggs was assisted in his laborious task by a learned native, Munsh\u00ed M\u00edr Khairat 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n Musht\u00e1k of Akbar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u00b3\n\nThe first two books of the work were translated by Colonel A.

The author dedicated his history to Aurangz\u00e9b, and tells us in his preface, that he composed it in A.H. 1107 (A.D. 1695). The first portion, relating to the Hind\u00fas, occupies nearly one-third of the work, and the account of the Muhammadan dynasties previous to the conquests of the Mongol Emperors, is exceedingly meagre. The history virtually concludes with the troubles which arose on the accession of Aurangz\u00e9b, and D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shik\u00fah's ineffectual opposition to his brother; the author merely mentioning in the last few lines that Aurangz\u00e9b died in A.H. 1118 (A.D. 1706), in the ninety-second year of his age, and the fifty-first year of his reign. The work is curious as proceeding from the pen of a Hind\u00fa; and is, to a certain extent, valuable, as continuing the T\u00e1rikh-i F\u00edrishtah, from the death of Akbar; but it is vastly inferior to that history in every respect.\n\nFoll. 325.

On his return from that country in A.H. 1015 (A.D. 1606) the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr appointed him Am\u00edr al-Mulk, and he proceeded to Bhakar, where he died. It is stated that he attained the rank of commander of 1000. Muhammad Ma'sum was a poet of some note, and wrote a D\u00edv\u00e1n and a Masnaw\u00ed. In addition to these and his history of Sind,\n\n\u00b9 The Hind\u00fa names in Nos. LVI., LVII., and LVIII., are barbarously written.

He was an excellent caligraphist, and numerous mosques, &c., were adorned with inscriptions from his hand: he also erected many buildings, particularly at Sakhar and his birthplace Bhakar.\n\nThe T\u0101r\u012bkh-i Sind contains:\n\nAuthor's Preface, giving an account of the work.\n\nBook I.\u2014History of the early Kings of Sind and of its conquest by Muhammad Ben K\u00e1sim Sakaf\u00ed, the cousin and son-in-law of Hajj\u00e1j Ben Y\u00fasuf, in A.H. 92 (A.D. 710), during the Khil\u00e1f\u00e1t of 'Abd al-Malik.

This book comprises biographical notices of divers learned and holy men.\n\n1 Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1.\n\n2 A.H. 801 is stated positively as the date, but there is no doubt that the rulers of Sind were virtually independent of the Kings of Dihl\u00ed many years previously. Indeed N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn Kab\u00e1ehah asserted his independence so early as the reign of \u00c1r\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, but on the defeat and death of N\u00e1sir ad-D\u00edn, in the reign of Altamish, Sind again fell under the yoke of Dihl\u00ed.\n\n3 This prince is usually called J\u00e1m Afra, but in the present MS. his name is distinctly written and pointed \u062c\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0641\u0631. In the MS. of the East India House, No. 43, the name is similarly spelled, but without the vowel points. The British Museum MS. (Addit. No. 16,700) reads \u062c\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0641\u0631\n\n4 Sh\u00e1h B\u00e9g Argh\u00fan, according to Muhammad Ma's\u00fan 'Al\u00ed, died in A.H. 928 (A.D. 1521). General Briggs, in his translation of Firishtah, places his conquest of Sind in A.H. 928 (A.D. 1521), and says that he died two years afterwards.

In the East India House MS. (No. 43) this is omitted; the history ending immediately after the capitulation of J\u00e1n\u00ed B\u00e9g, and stating in four lines, that he died in A.H. 1011 (A.D. 1602), and was succeeded in his government by his son M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2019\u00c1z\u00ed. The MS. in the British Museum (Addit.

At the end of each reign the author gives a number of dates that are curious and useful.

Account of the government of the English.\n\nIn the preface to the Bas\u00e1t\u00edn as-Sal\u00e1t\u00edn the author enumerates the following authorities for the history of Bij\u00e1pur: The Tazkirat al-Mul\u00fak, by M\u00edr Raf\u00ed\u2019 ad-D\u00edn Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, written in A.H. 1000 (A.D. 1591). The Muhammad N\u00e1mah, by Mull\u00e1 Zah\u00far, son of Mull\u00e1 Zah\u00far\u00ed K\u00e1in\u00ed, written in the time of Muhammad \u2019\u00c1dil Sh\u00e1h. The Insh\u00e1\u2019i \u2019Al\u00ed \u2019\u00c1dilsh\u00e1hiyah, by the Sayyid N\u00far Allah, son of the K\u00e1z\u00ed Sayyid \u2019Al\u00ed Muhammad N\u00far Allah, written in a flowery style, in the time of \u2019Al\u00ed \u2019\u00c1dil Sh\u00e1h II. The \u2019Al\u00ed N\u00e1mah, by the Court-poet of the Dakh\u00edn\u00b2 written at the same period; and a history of the entire dynasty, by the Shaikh Ab\u00fa al-Hasan, son of the K\u00e1z\u00ed \u2019Abd al-\u2019Az\u00edz. He also\n\n\u00b9 Muhammad Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm says that the Tabak\u00e1t-i Akbarsh\u00e1hi places Y\u00fasuf\u2019s death in A.H. 913 (A.D. 1507), Firishtah in A.H. 916 (A.D. 1510), and Raf\u00ed\u2019 ad-D\u00edn Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed and M\u00edr Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Asad Kh\u00e1n\u00ed, in A.H. 925 (A.D. 1519).\n\n\u00b2 Nusrati. The \u2019Al\u00ed N\u00e1mah or T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i \u2019Al\u00ed \u2019\u00c1dil Sh\u00e1h is a Masnaw\u00ed of considerable extent, comprising Kas\u00eddahs and other poetical pieces, celebrating the events mentioned in the work. See Garcin de Tassy, Histoire de la Litterature Hindou et Hindoustani. Tome i. p. 400.\nstates that the Muhammad N\u00e1ma\u1e25, and the history by the Shaikh Ab\u00fa al-Hasan, are extremely rare, and that he had never seen them, but that having procured rough drafts of portions of the work of Ab\u00fa al-Hasan, and some parts of the writings of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Asad Kh\u00e1n\u00ed and others, he collected and arranged his materials at the desire of his friends; and, after making some additions and corrections from the works of Firishtah, Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n, and other writers, produced the present history.\n\nThe dates of the deaths of two of the sovereigns of Bij\u00e1pur are here given somewhat differently from those in the work last described. Isma'il '\u00c1dil Sh\u00e1h is stated to have died in A.H. 941 (A.D. 1534), after a reign of twenty-four years and some months (instead of ten years earlier),\u00b9 which statement agrees with that of Firishtah; and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm '\u00c1dil Sh\u00e1h II. is said to have died in A.H. 1037 (A.D. 1627).\n\nThe Bas\u00e1t\u00edn as-Sal\u00e1t\u00edn was completed, as the author himself informs us, in A.H. 1240 (A.D. 1824). At the end of each book there is a collection of useful dates, and the statistics and mode of government of the empire are more than once touched upon. Though insufficient in many respects, it is written in an easy style, and must be considered as a valuable addition to the stock of materials for the history of Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nFoll. 387.

The J\u00e1mi\u2019 al-\u2019Ul\u00fam may probably have been a mere common-place book, in which the K\u00e1z\u00ed was used to insert, among other matters, extracts from the different histories that came into his hands, relating to the affairs of the Dakhin, and to the city of Ahmadnagar, his native place. It does not follow, from the statement contained in the first lines, that the entire volume was compiled by \u2019Abd an-Nab\u00ed, as it may only refer to the commencement. The account of the Niz\u00e1msh\u00e1h\u00eds, at the beginning of the work, presents some new matter, but that which occurs at the end is worthless, being taken almost verbatim from Firishtah.\n\nFoll. 155.

He was nearly ninety years old when he was assassinated.\nKutb Sh\u00e1h, who built Bhagnagar or Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and transferred his capital from Gulkundah to the newly-erected city, to his death in A.H. 1020 (A.D. 1611).\n\nAppendix.\u2014Account of the first six years of the reign of Ab\u00fa al-Muzaff\u00e1r Ab\u00fa al-Mans\u00far Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad Kutb Sh\u00e1h.\n\nFirishtah\u2019s account of the Kutbsh\u00e1h\u00ed Kings is somewhat insufficient. Indeed he makes an excuse for the defective state of this portion of his work, saying, that although a certain native of \u1e6cr\u00e1k, named Khurr\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, wrote a history of the dynasty, he had never been able to obtain a copy of it, and that he was obliged to content himself with such details as were procurable. The insufficiency of Firishtah\u2019s account is, however, well supplied by the present work, which, moreover, continues the history nearly to the end of the dynasty. The appendix to the third volume of General Briggs\u2019 translation of Firishtah contains an abridged version of the present MS., which he conjectures to be identical with the history spoken of by Firishtah. This supposition cannot be admitted if we agree with the learned General in his opinion that Firishtah died in A.D. 1612, as the present work was not completed, according to the author\u2019s own statement, until five years later. If, however, M. Mohl be right in thinking that Firishtah revised his work up to A.D. 1623, the present history may well be that fruitlessly sought for by the great historian.\n\nFoll. 303.

He says that he devoted fourteen years to the composition of his work, and that he drew his materials from the Mir\u00e1t-i Sikandar\u00ed, the Akbar N\u00e1mah, the Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr N\u00e1mah, and the P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah, mentioning also that he gives the events which occurred after the tenth year of Aurangz\u00edb\u2019s reign, on the information of persons living when he wrote.\n\nThe present MS. comprises the first portion of the Mir\u00e1t-i Ahmad\u00ed, and contains:\n\nAuthor\u2019s preface.\n\nIntroduction, giving a general description of Gujar\u00e1t, its produce and revenues, in the time of the independent monarchy.\n\nThe history of the early R\u00e1jahs, from the origin of the kingdom to the conquest by the Muhammadans, and a detailed account of\n\n\u00b9 Elphinstone places the suicide of Mu\u1e93affar III. in A.D. 1593 (Hist. of India, vol. ii, p. 246, 2d edit.).

But Shah\u00e1mat \u2019Al\u00ed, apparently on the authority of original documents, states that their real origin is to be traced to a very different source. He says that \u201ctheir progenitor, Daood, was a resident of Shikarpur, of the class called Julahas, or weavers.

It is not merely a history of the Nawabs of Bhawalpur, but comprehends that of Sind, Afghanistan, Multan, Jullhpur and the Sikhs, during an eventful period as regards our western frontier of India. The author was contemporary with the greater part of the events which he relates, and I am not aware that we can have recourse to any better Eastern authority for the history of Western India during the period of which he treats.\n\nShahamat Ali has published in English an abstract of an abbreviation of the family annals of the Nawab of Bhawalpur, the abbreviation having been made, as he informs us, by Pir Ibrahim Khau, at the request of Captain J. D. Cunningham. The abstract seems to be merely an abridged translation of Lallah Daulat Rai's work, and is both ill-arranged and obscurely written.\n\nThe present MS. was presented to Sir Claude Wade by the Nawab Bhawal Khan, during his mission to the Court of Bhawalpur, in A.D. 1832-33.\n\nFoll. 441.

His father, Jal\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn Ish\u00e1k, was K\u00e1zi in the time of Sh\u00e1h Rukh. In A.H. 841 (A.D. 1437), after his father\u2019s death, he was admitted into the service of Sh\u00e1h Rukh, and in A.H. 845 (A.D. 1441) he was sent on an important mission to one of the Kings of India; of this embassy he afterwards gave an interesting account in the Matla\u2019 as-Sa\u2019dain. In A.H. 850 (A.D. 1446) \u2019Abd ar-Razz\u00e1k was sent on an embassy into Gil\u00e1n, and had scarcely fulfilled his mission when he was ordered to depart for Egypt, with the title of ambassador. The death of his master, however, prevented his journey. After this \u2019Abd ar-Razz\u00e1k resided successively with M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2019Abd al-Lat\u00edf, M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u2019Abd Allah, M\u00edrz\u00e1 B\u00e1bar, and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm; and in A.H. 856 (A.D. 1452) he made preparations for a journey into \u2019Ir\u00e1k. In that year the Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa al K\u00e1sim B\u00e1bar, passing through the town of Taft Yazd, had an interview with the celebrated historian Sharaf ad-D\u00edn \u2019Al\u00ed Yazd\u00ed, and our author was present at the conference. Two years afterwards he became attached to the person of the Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sa\u2019\u00edd, who treated him with the greatest honour; and, in A.H. 863 (A.D. 1458), when Sult\u00e1n Husain Bah\u00e1dur undertook an expedition into Jurj\u00e1n, our author, who had been sent on a mission into that part of the country, had an opportunity of witnessing most of the events of the war. In A.H. 867 (A.D. 1462) \u2019Abd ar-Razz\u00e1k was elected Shaikh of the monastery of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h Rukh, at Hir\u00e1t, and held that office until his death, which happened in A.H. 887 (A.D. 1482).\n\nContents:\n\nVol. I.\u2014Commencing with the birth of Ab\u00fa Sa\u2019\u00edd, son of Ulj\u00e1j\u00fa\u0144 Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Khud\u00e1bandidah.

The account of the embassies and letters that passed between the Emperor of China and Sh\u00e1h Rukh, was published at Calcutta, in Persian and English, by Mr. Chambers,\u00b9 and was afterwards translated into French by M. Langl\u00e8s.\u00b2 The latter Orientalist also gave an account of the work in the Notices et Extraits des MSS.\u00b3 and introduced a version of 'Abd ar-Razz\u00e1k's description of India into the second volume of his Recueil portatif des Voyages. M. Charmoy has given a short notice of the Matla' as-Sa'dain, together with the text and translation of an extract from it, relating to Tim\u00far's expedition against Tuktamish Kh\u00e1n, in the M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de St. Petersbourg.\u2074 The most satisfactory description of the work will be found, however, in the elaborate article by M. Quatrem\u00e8re, in the fourteenth volume of the Notices et Extraits des MSS.\u2075\n\nThe learned academician has given a French translation of a great portion of the life of Sh\u00e1h Rukh;\u2076 and the text, accompanied by a version in French, of two other extracts from 'Abd ar-Razz\u00e1k's history, relating respectively to the voyage of the ambassadors of Sh\u00e1h Rukh to China,\u2077 and to that of 'Abd ar-Razz\u00e1k himself to India.\u2078 M. Quatrem\u00e8re passes the most favourable judgment as to the merits of the work, saying that it is, incontestably, one of the most curious and veracious histories that have been written in any of the Eastern languages.\n\nThe present MS. comprises the second volume only of the Matla' as-Sa'dain. It professes to be the autograph copy of the author, and is distinctly stated so to be in the colophon. The general appearance, however, of the volume scarcely warrants its being considered as of so old a period; and the care and neatness with which it is written, hardly any marginal corrections existing, lead me to suspect that the statement of its being in the handwriting of the author is untrue.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Asiati\u00ebk Miscellany.

The present work is the first edition, with additions, by Ghul\u00e1m 'Ali, poetically surnamed \u00c1z\u00e1d Husain\u00ed W\u00e1sit\u00ed B\u00e1lgr\u00e1m\u00ed; the whole arranged in alphabetical order.\n\nThe Am\u00edr Kam\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn, the fifth ancestor of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, came from Khaw\u00e1f to Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, in the reign of Akbar, whose service\nhe entered; and his descendants held in succession some of the highest offices of state, under the succeeding emperors. Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, whose original name was \u2019Abd ar-Razz\u00e1k al-Husain\u00ed, was born at L\u00e1h\u00far, in A.H. 1111 (A.D. 1699). Early in life he went to Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, where most of his relatives resided, and he was not long afterwards appointed D\u00edw\u00e1n of Bar\u00e1r. Having incurred the displeasure of the Niz\u00e1m al-Mulk \u00c1saf J\u00e1l, by favouring the revolt of his son N\u00e1sir Jang, he was disgraced and went into retirement, and it was during this period that he composed the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1. After he had passed five years in seclusion, \u00c1saf J\u00e1l, in A.H. 1160 (A.D. 1747), shortly before his death, took him again into favour, and reinstated him in the D\u00edw\u00e1n\u00ed of Bar\u00e1r. Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n enjoyed the highest honours under N\u00e1sir Jang, the son and successor of \u00c1saf J\u00e1l, and subsequently became the chief minister of Sal\u00e1bat Jang, the S\u00fabahd\u00e1r of the Dakhin, and played a conspicuous part in the affairs of that portion of India, and the struggles for supremacy between the English and French. He was assassinated in A.H. 1171 (A.D. 1757). Ghul\u00e1m \u2019Al\u00ed implicates Bussy in his murder, but the charge appears to be without foundation.\n\nAfter the death of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n his house was plundered, and his library dispersed. He had left the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1 in a rough and imperfect state, and it was missing at the time of his murder. Ghul\u00e1m \u2019Al\u00ed, however, who had been his intimate friend, made all search for the lost work, and, a full twelvemonth afterwards, found it, arranged the scattered portions, and prepared it for publication, making several important additions, and prefixing a preface, which gives an account of the work, and a good life of its distinguished author.\n\nMr. Bland has related some particulars of the life of Ghul\u00e1m \u2019Al\u00ed, the editor of the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1, in the Society\u2019s Journal.

Mr. Wilson judiciously remarks: \u201cThe native historian is no doubt misled by his prejudices, in ascribing to the French commandant any share, however indirect, in the assassination of the Dewan; but had Clive been implicated in any similar transaction, it is very probable that the English historian would have given a very different account of it.\u201d And see the Quarterly Oriental Magazine, vol. iv. p. 284, note. 8vo.

He travelled into various parts of India, and visited Makkah and Mad\u00ednah; and Mr. Bland states, on the authority of the Khul\u00e1sat al-Afk\u00e1r, \"that after his journeys and pilgrimage already described (and mentioned also in the Sub\u00faf), he was much honoured during his residence at Aurangabad, by the Subahd\u00e1rs, and associated in friendly intimacy with the sons of \u00c1saf Jah; yet, with these temptations, he never engaged in the affairs of the world.\" Ghul\u00e1m 'Al\u00ed himself informs us that he was at one time attached to Sams\u00e1m ad-Daulah, in the capacity of amanuensis.\n\nThe biographies comprised in this first edition of the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1 extend to Ghul\u00e1m 'Al\u00ed's own time, and are 261 in number, if we include the life of the author by the editor.

In the time of Sal\u00e1bat Jang he became Kil\u2019ahd\u00e1r of Daulatab\u00e1d. On his father\u2019s murder, in A.H. 1171 (A.D. 1757), he was imprisoned in the fortress of Gulkundah, but he was subsequently released in A.H. 1173 (A.D. 1759), by the Naw\u00e1b Niz\u00e1m al-Mulk Niz\u00e1m ad-Daulah \u00c1saf J\u00e1h S\u00e1n\u00ed, who treated him with great distinction, and reinstated him in his hereditary title as Sams\u00e1m al-Mulk.\u00b9 He died in A.H. 1196 (A.D. 1781).\n\n\u2019Abd al-Hayy Kh\u00e1n mentions in his preface the edition of the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1 prepared by Ghul\u00e1m \u2019Al\u00ed, and says that other parts of his father\u2019s work having subsequently come into his hands, he determined to complete it from them and other sources. He enumerates no less than thirty histories and biographical treatises, from which he has drawn the materials for his own portion of the work. He also states that he finished his task in A.H. 1194 (A.D. 1780).\n\nThe second edition of the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1 contains:\n\n- The preface by the editor.\n- The original preface by Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n.\n- The preface by Ghul\u00e1m \u2019Al\u00ed.\n- The life of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, by Ghul\u00e1m \u2019Al\u00ed.\n- An index to the biographies.\n\n\u00b9 At the end of the life of Sams\u00e1m ad-Daulah, by Ghul\u00e1m \u2019Al\u00ed, it is said that \u2019Abd al-Hayy Khan\u2019s title was originally Shams ad-Daulah Dil\u00e1war Jang, but that he afterwards, on being released from prison, received his father\u2019s title, viz., Sams\u00e1m ad-Daulah Sams\u00e1m Jang, and was appointed to the rank of six thousand. He himself, however, in the appendix to his own edition of the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1, states, that the title conferred upon him was Sams\u00e1m al-Mulk, and that in relation therewith he adopted the poetical name of \u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0646 S\u00e1rim. He concludes his work by quoting some of his own verses.

They are very ably written, and full of important historic detail; and, as they include those of all the most eminent men who flourished in the time of the Mongol Emperors of the house of T\u00edm\u00far, down to A.H. 1194 (A.D. 1780), the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1 must always hold its place as one of the most valuable books of reference for the student of Indian history.\n\nColonel Stewart has made a strange confusion with regard to the authorship of the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1, reversing completely the relations of father and son. He says: \"This book was compiled by Abd al-Hy Ben Abd al-Rez\u0101k Sh\u0101h N\u016b\u0101z Kh\u00e1n, and finished by his son Sums\u0101m al-Dowlah, A.D. 1779.\"\u00b9\n\nFoll. 421.

This version is sufficiently faithful to the text, but the style is inelegant, and it is to be regretted that the translator should have been induced to render his original into a language with which he was not thoroughly acquainted.\n\nThe first portion of the Siyar al-Mutaakhkhirin has been more recently translated by General Briggs, to whose learned labours on the history of Muhammadan India we are so largely indebted. I may here appropriately quote his account of the work, and his opinion of its merits: \"It embraces a period of about seventy years, and affords a complete insight into the events which caused the downfall of the Mahomedan power, and the elevation of the Mahrattas; and it brings us to the first steps which led to the occupation of Bengal, and eventually of all India, by the British Government. The work is written in the style of private memoirs, the most useful and engaging shape which history can assume; nor, excepting in the peculiarities which belong to the Mahomedan character and creed, do we perceive throughout its pages any inferiority to the historical memoirs of Europe. The Duc de Sully, Lord Clarendon, or Bishop Burnet, need not have been ashamed to be the authors of such a production.\"\n\nGeneral Briggs' translation ends with the defeat of Sar Afr\u00e1z Khan, by Mah\u00e1bat Jang, commonly known in this country as Alla Verdi Khan, in A.H. 1153 (A.D. 1740), and comprises about one-fifth of the entire work.\n\nFoll. 481.

He was originally a Sunn\u00ed, then a Sh\u00ed'ah, and subsequently became a freethinker. It is probable that his sons, although conforming with the outward observances of Muhammadanism, imbibed from him the liberal opinions on religious subjects which they entertained, and which they are accused by all the Musulm\u00e1n writers of having instilled into Akbar's mind, and thus corrupted that monarch's orthodoxy.\\(^1\\)\n\nAb\u00fa al-Fazl was born in A.H. 958 (A.D. 1551).\\(^2\\) Faiz\u00ed, his\n\n\\(^1\\) Elphinstone, History of India, vol. ii. p. 281. 2nd edition.\n\\(^2\\) Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1, as edited by 'Abd al-Hayy Kh\u00e1n.\nbrother, had been presented to Akbar in the twelfth year of that monarch's reign, and Ab\u00fa al-Fazl was introduced to the emperor's notice in the twentieth, viz., A.H. 982 (A.D. 1574). Ab\u00fa al-Fazl soon afterwards attained high military rank, and became chief minister, an office which he filled with distinction for nearly twenty-eight years. His favour at Court naturally excited the envy of his less fortunate rivals, and towards the close of Akbar's reign, a conspiracy was formed against him by his enemies, and headed by Sal\u00edm, one of Akbar's sons, who afterwards ascended the throne, under the name of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. The conspirators having learned that Ab\u00fa al-Fazl was on his return from a mission in the Dakhin, sent a Hind\u00fa R\u00e1jah, named Narsingh D\u00edv B\u00fandhilah, with a strong force, both horse and foot, in order to intercept him. The R\u00e1jah met Ab\u00fa al-Fazl near Ujjain,\u00b9 and, after an obstinate conflict, the minister's party was defeated, and he himself was slain. Narsingh D\u00edv forwarded Ab\u00fa al-Fazl's head to Sal\u00edm at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. This assassination, which is the deepest blot on the character of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, was perpetrated on the fourth of Rab\u00ed' al-Awwal, in A.H. 1011 (A.D. 1602).\n\nAb\u00fa al-Fazl, besides the Akbar N\u00e1mah, was the author of the Dust\u00far al-'Amal, which is an abridgment of the \u00c1y\u00edn-i Akbar\u00ed, the third volume of the Akbar N\u00e1mah; and of the 'Iy\u00e1r-i D\u00e1n\u00edsh, a Persian translation of the fables of Bidpai: there is also a collection of his letters and miscellaneous writings, which was published after his death by his nephew, 'Abd as-Samad, and is entitled the Makt\u00fab\u00e1t, or, Insh\u00e1'\u00ed Ab\u00fa al-Fazl. In addition to the productions of his own pen, he conferred a further benefit upon the Muhammedan literature of India, by causing translations to be made of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, and other Sanskrit works of note.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Muhammad H\u00e1d\u00ed, the editor of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's autobiography (described infra, No. CXX.), states in his introduction that Ab\u00fa al-Fazl was assassinated on his arrival at a place called the Sar\u00e1\u00ed Bar, ten kur\u00fahs distance from Guw\u00e1liy\u00e1r.\n\nGladwin calls it Barkeh Serai (Hist. of Hind. p. vii.) There is great uncertainty as to this name. In the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1, [(described supra No. CIII.) we find the place thus mentioned:\n\nThe words Barkeh or Bar kih, are very possibly erroneous renderings of the term Parganah, the name of the Parganah being omitted.\n\n\u00b2 See the article \"Ab\u00fa-l-Fazl,\" by Professor Forbes, in the Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, vol. i. 8vo.

The best account that I have seen of Ab\u00fa al-Fazl, as also of his brother Faizi, is to be found in the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1, as edited by 'Abd al-Hayy K\u00edshn (described supra, No. CIII).\nThe present MS. comprises the first two volumes of the Akbar N\u00e1mah.\n\nVol. I.\u2014Divided into two parts, and a conclusion. Part 1. Containing the author's preface; an account of Akbar's birth, and of his ancestors; of the Mongols, from their origin; and of Tim\u00far, B\u00e1bar, and Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, giving a detailed history of the reign of the last-named emperor, to his death in A.H. 963 (A.D. 1555). Part 2. The history of the reign of the Emperor Akbar, from his accession to the throne, to the second of Jum\u00e1da al-Awwal, A.H. 979 (A.D. 1571).\u00b9 Conclusion.\u2014Many MSS. omit this conclusion,\u00b2 and it seems doubtful whether it is from the pen of the author.\n\nVol. II.\u2014The continuation of the history of Akbar to Ramaz\u00e1n A.H. 1010 (A.D. 1601), the commencement of the forty-eighth year of his reign.\n\nI cannot refrain from quoting in this place Mr. Elphinstone's excellent criticism on the Akbar N\u00e1mah:\u2014\"Abul Fazl, in this reign, shows all his usual merits, and more than his usual defects. Every event that had a tendency to take from the goodness, wisdom, or power of Akbar, is passed over or misstated; and a uniform strain of panegyric and triumph is kept up, which disgusts the reader with the author, and almost with the hero. Amidst these unmeaning flourishes, the real merits of Akbar disappear, and it is from other authors that we learn the motives of his actions, the difficulties he had to contend with, and the resources by which they were surmounted. The gross flattery of a book written by one so well acquainted with Akbar's disposition, and submitted, it appears, to his own inspection, leaves an impression of the vanity of that prince, which is almost the only blot on his admirable character.\"\u00b3\n\nFoll. 232.

The present MS. is most probably the oldest copy of the autobiography of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr now extant, having been written in A.H. 1040 (A.D. 1630), only three lunar years after the death of the royal author; and for this reason I shall style the memoirs, as contained in this volume, the first edition.\u00b9 This edition was translated by the learned and indefatigable Major Price,\u00b2 from a MS. which will be presently described. I have had the opportunity of examining no less than five copies of the first edition, viz.: three in the present collection,\u00b3 one in the library of the East India House,\u2074 and a fifth in the British Museum,\u2075 all of which agree, more or less, one with another, although some discrepancies occur.\n\nI will now advert to what I would style the second edition.\n\nIn the year 1786 Mr. Anderson published some extracts from Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's memoirs in the Asiatic Miscellany,\u2076 and other portions were subsequently given by Mr. Gladwin, in the appendix to his History of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.\u2077 These differ materially from the translation by Major Price, being the same in substance only, but couched in very different language; they, however, agree tolerably with each other. Mr. Elphinstone, in his History of India, says that Gladwin possessed\n\n\u00b9 I would so call it, merely from the period at which the present MS. was transcribed; it may possibly be only an abridgment, or rather an altered version of the larger work, described infr\u00e0, No. CXX.\n\u00b2 Memoirs of the Emperor Jahangueir, written by himself; translated by Major D.

Calcutta, 1788.\na much more perfect copy of the memoirs than that used by Price,\u00b9 and Gladwin himself speaks of the work thus: \"He (Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr) also wrote his own memoirs in the Persian language, containing a minute account of the political and private conduct of his life, from the commencement of his reign to the end of the twelfth year; they are universally admired for the purity, elegance, and simplicity of the style; and he appears, in general, to have exposed his own follies and weaknesses with great candour and fidelity: when he had completed the memoirs of twelve years he distributed several copies of them among his children, and principal officers of his court. He continued these memoirs, with his own hand, till the commencement of the seventeenth year of his reign; when, finding himself, from ill health, unable to proceed, he, from that period to the time of his death, employed Motamid Khan as his amanuensis. The whole of this continuation is exceedingly scarce, the compiler of this history not having been able to procure a sight of any other copy than the one which was sent him by his friend, Colonel Polier.\"\u00b2 Gladwin gives no authority for these statements,\u00b3 and it is to be remarked that the author of the Critical Essay says: \"I have never seen a copy of the emperor's own work that traces his history beyond the eighteenth year of his reign.\"\u2074\n\nOn the appearance of Major Price's translation the learned Silvestre de Sacy pointed out the difference that existed between that translation and the extracts above-mentioned.\u2075 He observed that this difference could not be explained by the supposition that the text, as published by Anderson, was only an abridgment or extract from the original memoirs of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, since the version of Anderson, though the more concise of the two, contained the statement of many circumstances omitted in Price's translation; he likewise, by quoting parallel passages, showed that it was impossible that Anderson's extracts and Price's version could have been derived from the same text. De Sacy also mentions the exaggerated account of property and expenditure, as of the number of elephants, horses, &c., and the cost of buildings,\n\n\u00b9 Elphinstone, History of India, vol. ii. p. 350, note. 8vo.

Pp. 359 et seq., 430 et seq.\nand such like, in the memoirs as translated by Price, compared with\nthe more moderate statements given in Anderson's extracts. He con-\ncludes, without questioning the authenticity of the MS. employed by\nPrice, by stating that he considers the extracts published by Anderson\nand Gladwin have a greater right to be considered as the work of the\nEmperor than the MS. from which Price has translated, and that the\nlatter is probably a portion of a more recent work, written on the\nbasis of the original memoirs of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and perhaps of other docu-\nments, by some writer who has wrongfully adopted the first person,\nas though addressing his children, and, without regard to the order of\nevents, has inserted much extraneous matter, just as he happened to\nremember it, leaving out many things that ought to have formed part\nof the narrative.\n\nSome time ago I chanced to meet with a MS. containing memoirs\nof Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's reign, written in the first person, and agreeing closely\nwith the extracts published by Anderson and Gladwin. My MS.,\nthough unfortunately imperfect, differed so extensively from the\nothers that I had then seen, that, if authentic, it at once confirmed the\nsagacious suggestion of De Sacy as to the existence of two distinct\ntexts of the Emperor's work. Since then I have found two other\nMSS. of the memoirs in the library of the East India Company, which\nagree with my own copy almost verbatim, and are perfect at the com-\nmencement: they begin rather abruptly with the Emperor's accession,\nand they both bring the history of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's reign down to the\nbeginning of the nineteenth year, where it is broken off without\nexplanation, comment, or conclusion. These two MSS., taken in con-\njunction with my own, at once set the question at rest as to there being\ntwo texts of the memoirs, but some doubt still remained as to their\nrespective authenticity. That the edition which I have here called\nthe first is authentic, is, I think, sufficiently proved by the age of the\n\n1 The volume is imperfect at the beginning, and the memoirs conclude with\nthe events of A.H. 1027 (A.D. 1617); it is, moreover, ill-written, and in some\nplaces almost illegible, from the difficulty of the handwriting, and injury received\nfrom damp.\n\n2 Nos. 164 and 181.\n\n3 The first words are:\n\n\u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0646\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0647\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062a \u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645\u06cc\n\u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0645 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u062c\u0631\u06cc\n\u06a9\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0647\u060c \u0622\u06a9\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0646 \u0633\u06cc \u0648 \u0647\u0634\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0644\u06a9\u06cc \u0628\u0631 \u062a\u062e\u062a\n\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0646\u062a \u062c\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0645\npresent MS., since a work transcribed so soon after the author's death could scarcely have been foisted on the public if a forgery; but the authenticity of the larger and more complete edition remained still somewhat doubtful. Under these circumstances I was delighted to find amongst the valuable MSS. recently presented to our society by General Briggs, a complete copy of the memoirs, coinciding with my own MS., with the published extracts, and with the two MSS. of the East India House last-mentioned, and containing, moreover, an editorial preface and introduction, together with a continuation of the work to the death of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. The details given by the editor in the MS. of General Briggs, which will be described hereafter,\u00b9 are, I think, decisive as to the genuineness of the larger work. I have called it the second edition, since it was edited after the author's death, but it possibly, nay, was probably, prepared as it at present exists, by the Emperor himself. That the shorter work was only a kind of sketch for the preparation of the more complete edition, may be hazarded as a conjecture; but, from the great difference existing between them, I am disposed to think that Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, like T\u00edm\u00far and B\u00e1bar, wrote his autobiography in the Chaght\u00e1\u00ef Turk\u00ed language, and that the copies we now possess are merely more or less perfect translations from the original.\u00b2\n\nThe present MS. is probably the most authentic copy of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's memoirs now extant, or at least of the first edition, having been written as before stated, soon after the imperial author's death. In addition to the memoirs it comprises a Pand N\u00e1mah, or collection of moral maxims and rules of conduct, with a short preface by another writer.\u00b3 This Pand N\u00e1mah occupies thirty-two leaves, and the volume concludes with a number of letters, petitions, &c., written during the latter part of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's reign, and filling the last twenty leaves of the book. This third division of the work I have not met with in any other MS. The memoirs and the Pand N\u00e1mah are, in the present volume, freely interspersed with verses, many of which are omitted in Price's MS., which will be presently described, and the\n\n\u00b9 See infr\u00e0, No. CXX.\n\n\u00b2 M. de Tassy suggests that the memoirs may have been originally written in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed.\u2014\"On pourrait, peut-\u00eatre, consid\u00e9rer la r\u00e9daction hindoustani comme originale, car il n'est pas dit qu'elle soit traduite du persan.

At the commencement of this preface, and also of the Pand N\u00e1mah, spaces are left for rubries in the present MS.\nmemoirs themselves are somewhat fuller in detail.\\(^1\\) There is also some additional matter at the end of the memoirs, occupying, however, only three pages and a half, which is wanting in the copy used by Major Price.\n\nThe title which I have prefixed to the present MS. appears in the middle space of an illuminated 'Unw\u00e1n at the head of the work, and is also written by a native hand, on the back of the first leaf. No particular title to the memoirs is given, either by Gladwin or Price, nor is there one in the MSS. described under the two next following numbers. Anderson heads his extracts as from the \u062a\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0639 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc.

He also mentions that, as Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr commenced the memoirs from the date of his accession to the throne, he has prefixed an introduction, giving the history of that monarch from his birth to his accession.\n\nContents:\n\nI.\u2014Editor's preface and Introduction, comprising an account of the descent of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr from T\u00edm\u00far, of his birth, of his youth, of his wives, and children; and a summary of events, from the time of his birth to his accession to the throne. The preface and introduction occupy twenty leaves and one page.\n\nII.\u2014The autobiographical memoirs of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, from his accession to the commencement of the nineteenth year of his reign. The memoirs in the present copy occupy no less than 412 leaves; and the events of each year are distinguished by rubrics, which greatly facilitate reference. Jahang\u00edr appears to have written part of the history of the nineteenth year of his reign, the contents of seven pages relating to that year being in the first person. The autobiography then ends abruptly, and it is stated in a rubric that the Emperor's work concludes in that place, and that the subsequent matter has been added by Muhammad H\u00e1d\u00ed, in order to complete the book.\u00b9\n\nIII.\u2014The continuation of the memoirs, by the editor, Muhammad H\u00e1d\u00ed, beginning with the early part of the nineteenth year of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's reign, and ending with his death, in A.H. 1037 (A.D. 1627), and the accession of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.

In illustration of the variance between the two versions, and of the copiousness of Muhammad H\u00e1d\u00ed\u2019s edition, when compared with the first, I may add that the substance of what occupies forty-seven pages in Major Price\u2019s translation fills forty pages in the present MS., and that the translation comprises only 141 pages in all, whilst the autobiography extends over no less than 824 pages in General Briggs\u2019 MS.\n\nI have entitled the present volume \u062a\u0648\u0631\u06a9 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc T\u00fazak-i Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr\u00ed, in order to distinguish it from the first edition of the memoirs, and because it is so called by the scribe at the end of the memoirs, immediately before the account of the W\u00e1z\u00edrs.\u00b9\n\nFoll. 488.

In the rubric, at the beginning of the continuation (see supra, p. 119, note 1), the author names himself Muhammad Zam\u00e1n H\u00e1d\u00ed.

Gladwin's History of Hindustan. Gladwin states that Mu'tamad Kh\u00e1n, in AH. 1031 (A.D. 1621), was implicated in a treasonable correspondence, carried on by Mahram Kh\u00e1n, Khalil B\u00e9k, and Fid\u00e1y\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, with the Prince Khurram (afterwards Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n), who was then in rebellion against his father Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and that he was dismissed from the emperor's service, and banished to Thathah. The treason alluded to by Gladwin is mentioned in the Ikb\u00e1lnamah-i Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr\u00ed, and the fate of the traitors is specified, the two former having been condemned to death, and Fid\u00e1y\u00ed Kh\u00e1n having managed to exculpate himself; but the author does not advert to his own participation in the plot, nor is the fact spoken of in the Ma\u00e1sir al-Umar\u00e1.

He states, also, on the authority of Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n, that the emperor prohibited the composition and recitation of poetry, but that this extreme austerity must have been of very short duration, for his own letters are filled with poetical quotations, and sometimes with extemporary verses made by himself. Mr. Elphinstone adds that \"his prohibition of history was more permanent; he not only discontinued the regular annals of the empire, which had before been kept by a royal historiographer, but so effectually put a stop to all record of his transactions, that from the eleventh year of his reign, the course of events can only be traced through the means of letters on business, and of notes taken clandestinely by private individuals\" (Hist. of India, vol. ii., p. 456. 2d edit.).

In the preface the author names himself merely Fazl Allah, and dedicates his work to the At\u00e1bak above mentioned, so that the opinion that he was Wass\u00e1f's father is probably correct: this is, moreover, favoured by the Mu'jam being written in an obscure and inflated style, very much resembling that of the T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i Wass\u00e1f.

In addition to the history of the Safaw\u012bs, traced down to his own time, the author has affixed separate accounts of the English in India, and of their justice and generosity; of the Afgh\u0101n usurpation in Persia; of the Kachal\u0101tiy\u0101n; of the Afsh\u0101rs; of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h and his descendants; of the\n\n\u00b9 Muhammad M\u012brz\u0101 was the great grandson of Sh\u0101h Husain Ben Sulaim\u0101n, who abdicated the throne in favour of Mahm\u016bd, the Afgh\u0101n usurper, in A.H. 1135 (A.D. 1722), and who was the last sovereign of the Safaw\u012b family, who ruled independently. Tahm\u0101sp II., son of Sh\u0101h Husain, struck coin in his own name, and struggled ineffectually for a few years to reestablish the monarchy. He was nominally restored by N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, who deposed and imprisoned him in A.H. 1145 (A.D. 1732), and was nominally succeeded by his infant son \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101, who died, or was murdered, or imprisoned, in A.H. 1148 (A.D. 1735), when N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h assumed the sovereignty of Persia. Husain M\u012brz\u0101, who is stated to have been born in prison six months before the assassination of his father Tahm\u0101sp II., in A.H. 1151 (A.D. 1738), but as to whose parentage there seems some doubt, was set up as king of Persia, under the name of Husain II., by \u1e24usain Mard\u0101n Kh\u0101n and some other nobles about the time when Kar\u012bm Kh\u0101n Zand began the foundation of his power; he reigned nominally for seven months, when he was deposed and blinded. Husain II. had two sons, Tahm\u0101sp M\u012brz\u0101, and Muhammad M\u012brz\u0101. Tahm\u0101sp M\u012brz\u0101 died of small-pox in his childhood. Muhammad M\u012brz\u0101 was the last of the Safawiyah to whom the title of king was given. In A.H. 1200 (A.D. 1785) Muhammad Kh\u0101n, son of Muhammad Husain B\u0113g Ast\u0101r\u0101b\u0101d\u012b, sent to him at T\u0101bs, begging him to proceed to T\u012bhr\u0101n, and assert his authority. Some r\u016bp\u012bs were even struck in his name as King, bearing the following inscription:\u2014on the obverse\n\nin the margin, the names of the Panj Tan, i.e., Muhammad, F\u0101\u1e6dimah, \u1e24usain, and Husain; and on the reverse\n\nMuhammad M\u012brz\u0101, however, declined the invitation, believing it to be a snare, and stated that his desire was to remain in obscurity, and that he had given up all pretensions to the sovereign power. It was in this very year, A.H. 1200 (A.D. 1785), that \u0100gh\u0101 Muhammad Kh\u0101n made T\u012bhr\u0101n the seat of his empire, and struck money with the legend\nAbd\u00e1l\u00ed Afgh\u00e1ns; of the Zand dynasty; and of the K\u00e1j\u00e1rs to the time of Fath \u2019Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h.\n\nAb\u00fa al-Hasan in his preface, as well as in other places, and at the conclusion of the work, mentions that the date of its composition is expressed by the chronogram \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e i.e., A.H. 1211 (A.D. 1796); but in another passage he distinctly states that he completed it in A.H. 1215 (A.D. 1800), when Muhammad M\u00edrz\u00e1 was twenty-six years of age; and he elsewhere records events which occurred in the following year.\n\nFoll. 153.

S\u00e1d\u00edk Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed gives the same orthography, adding the vowel points \u0643\u0631\u0647\u0631\u0648\u062f and states that it is \"a city of 'Ir\u00e1k 'Ajam, called after the Arabian manner Karathh \u0643\u0631\u0627\u062b\u062d\" (S\u00e1d\u00edk Isf. p. 41). In a MS. of Hamd Allah Kazw\u00edni's Nuzhat al-Kul\u016bb, in my possession, the reading is \u0643\u0631\u0647\u0631\u0648\u062f.\n'Ir\u00e1k, in A.H. 949 (A.D. 1542), and was the son of the Am\u00edr Shams ad-D\u00edn, ruler of Budl\u00eds.' The latter becoming dispossessed of his government, received the title of Kh\u00fan from Sh\u00e1h Tahm\u00e1sb, and Sharaf ad-D\u00edn was educated with the Sh\u00e1h's own sons. At the early age of twelve years he was appointed, under tutelage, governor of S\u00e1l\u00edy\u00e1n and Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d, dependencies of Sh\u00edrw\u00e1n; that honour being granted to him by the Sh\u00e1h at the unanimous request of the R\u00faz\u00e1k\u00ed tribe. In the course of the succeeding years he was nominated to several important posts, and distinguished himself greatly in the suppression of a rebellion in G\u00edl\u00e1n, where he remained for seven years. The air of that province being unhealthy, he obtained leave to return to Kazw\u00edn, and applied for permission to stay at the Sh\u00e1h's court. In this, however, he was opposed by a party of his enemies, who had acquired influence over the mind of the aged Tahm\u00e1sb; and seeing no safety in remaining, he petitioned to be sent away on service. He was accordingly dispatched into Sh\u00edrw\u00e1n, but he had only been there eight months when the intelligence arrived of Sh\u00e1h Tahm\u00e1sb's death, of the murder of Sult\u00e1n Haidar M\u00edrz\u00e1, and of the proclamation of Sh\u00e1h Isma'il II., at Kazw\u00edn. He was now recalled from Sh\u00edrw\u00e1n, and appointed Am\u00edr al-Umar\u00e1, but the envy of his enemies became once more excited by the high favour in which he was held by the new Sh\u00e1h, and it was reported that he was implicated in a conspiracy to raise Sult\u00e1n Husain M\u00edrz\u00e1 to the sovereignty. For some time Sh\u00e1h Isma'il hesitated to believe in Sharaf ad-D\u00edn's guilt, but at length his opponents prevailed, and he was sent in an official capacity to Nakhlj\u00e1w\u00e1n. He had resided in \u00c1zarb\u00e1ij\u00e1n one year and four months, when, in A.H. 986 (A.D. 1578), the Turks invaded Persia,\n\n---\n\n1 This word is usually written Badl\u00ed\u0161, or Bedl\u00ed\u0161, but it is carefully pointed Budl\u00ed\u0161 in the present MS., which, having been presented to Sir John Malcolm by the W\u00e1lf of Ard\u00e1l\u00e1n, may be considered as a great authority in fixing the orthography of the name. In the MS. marked B. mentioned below (p. 146, note 1), and in the Mu'jam al-Buld\u00e1n, it is, however, given as Badl\u00ed\u0161, which mode of spelling is also adopted by the author of the Mar\u00e1sid al-Ittil\u00e1'.

The Turks received Sharaf ad-D\u00edn with great honour, the Ottoman emperor conferred upon him the title of Sharaf Kh\u00e1n, and he was appointed ruler of his hereditary possession of Budl\u00eds, a position which he held in A.H. 1005 (A.D. 1596), the time when he composed his work.\n\nThe Sharaf N\u00e1mah is a work of great rarity. Three copies, however, exist at St. Petersburg; one in the Imperial library (No. 306 in the new Catalogue), and two in the Asiatic Museum of the Academy, numbered respectively 576 and a 576. The copy in the Imperial Library would be invaluable for clearing up the numerous difficulties inseparable from a work containing such a multitude of proper names, inasmuch as it was written in A.H. 1007 (A.D. 1598), only two years after the completion of the work, and was revised and corrected by the author himself. The editors of the Catalogue of the Imperial Library do not give a detailed table of the contents of the Sharaf N\u00e1mah, but M. Wolkow has described one of the MSS. of the Asiatic Museum, at considerable length, in the Journal Asiatique.\n\nThere are two separate Turkish translations of the Sharaf N\u00e1mah in the library of the British Museum. My friend, Mr. Charles Ricou, who pointed them out to my notice, has kindly furnished me with the subjoined description of these MSS. They are useful in\n\n---\n\n1 Tome viii. p. 291 et seq.\n2 Addit. MSS., Nos. 7, 860 and 18,547.\n3 \"My Dear Morley,\n\n\"The British Museum possesses two copies, or rather two different versions, of the Sheref N\u00e1me, in Turkish: No. Add. 7,860, and Add. 18,547.\n\n\"The first of these MSS. contains a version in extenso, in which the flowery style of the Persian work, and the numerous verses with which it is interspersed, are faithfully preserved, the latter being left in the original language. It begins thus:\n\n\"\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0634\u0631\u0641 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647\u060c \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0647 \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0627 \u0646\u06af\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f.\n\n\"No translator's name appears, nor is there any mention made of the work being a translation at all.\n\n\"It is a folio of 332 leaves, and seventeen lines in a page, rather negligently written in Neskh\u00ed, apparently in the latter part of the eighteenth century.\n\n\"The second MS. (Add. 18,547, 4to., 132 leaves; seventeen lines in a page; written in a small and well formed Neskh\u00ed, about the same period as Add. 7,860) presents an abridged version of the same work.\n\n\"The translator Shem'i \u0634\u0645\u06cc states, in a short preface, the circumstance which led to its composition. He was once present in an assembly at the court of the Kurdish Emir Mustafa Beg, governor of Ekil \u0627\u06a9\u06cc\u0644 when the discourse happened to fall on the rule and government of the Emir's illustrious ancestors.\"\ndetermining the orthography of the proper names, and though I have adhered to the spelling of our own MS., giving the original of every uncommon or uncertain name, I have thought it advisable to insert in the notes the various readings contained in the Turkish MSS., and that described by M. Wolkow.\n\nThe contents of the present MS. are as follows:\n\nAuthor's Preface.\u2014Giving an account of the work.\n\nIntroduction.\u2014On the origin of the Kurds, and their manners and customs.\n\nBook I.\u2014History of the Sultans of Kurdish origin; divided into five chapters. 1.

In order to make it more easily accessible, the Emir directed Shem'i to translate it into Turkish.\n\n\"This version, being divested of the superfluous ornaments and poetical quotations of the original, is considerably shorter. Moreover, the concluding chapter, which treats of the Osmanli Sultans, although mentioned in the table of contents included in the preface, is omitted in the body of the work.\n\n\"I remain, my dear Morley,\n\n\"Very sincerely, yours,\n\n\"Ch.

In the introduction he mentions that in some instances the H\u00e1kim and Am\u00edr are distinguished by the names of their tribes, and in others by those of the cities or fortresses which they possessed. He gives as examples of the former, the H\u00e1kim of Hak\u00e1r\u00ed, Sahr\u00e1n, B\u00e1ban, and \u00c1rdal\u00e1n, and of the latter the H\u00e1kim of Hisnk\u00edf\u00e1 and Budl\u00eds.\n\nIt will be remarked that \u00c1rdal\u00e1n is usually considered as the name of a district, but not only we have this authority of Sharaf ad-D\u00edn for its being the name of the tribe or family, and not of the country, but he also expressly states in another place that the tribe was so called after B\u00e1b\u00e1 \u00c1rdal\u00e1n, its founder.\n\n| \u062d\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc | \u0628\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0648 | \u0628\u062e\u062a\u06cc |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0646\u0627\u0646 | \u0641\u06cc\u0646\u06a9 | \u0639\u0632\u06cc\u0632\u0627\u0646 |\n| \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u0644 | \u062d\u0633\u0646\u06a9\u06cc\u0641\u0627 | \u0686\u0645\u0634\u06a9\u0632\u06a9 |\n| \u062d\u0633\u0646\u06a9\u06cc\u0641\u0627 | \u0645\u0646\u06a9\u0627\u0646 | \u0686\u0645\u0634\u06a9\u0632\u06a9 |\n\nL 2\nof Majankurd.

This appendix is dedicated to Ab\u00fa al-Muzaffar Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Khan III., the thirteenth of the Ottoman emperors, who came to the throne in A.H. 1003 (A.D. 1594).\n\nThe history of every dynasty or race mentioned in the above table of contents, is traced by the author, where not otherwise specified, from its origin to his own time. The work is of the greatest importance for the elucidation of the history of countries and tribes of which we at present know but little, and concerning which we cannot, so far as I know, gain any sound information from other sources. The author, moreover, is an excellent authority for a large amount of the events recorded in his work, seeing that he himself took an active part in them. The fourth Book and the Appendix are especially valuable, the former giving the history of the rulers of Budl\u00eds, with the most circumstantial detail, and the latter furnishing a full account of the Turkish invasions of Persia, and of the disturbances which took place after the death of Sh\u00e1h Tahm\u00e1sb. This fourth Book and the Appendix occupy more than one half of the entire work.\n\n\u00b9 These first two chapters are transposed in the table of contents, but occur as above in the body of the work, both in the present MS. and the Turkish translations.\n\n\u00b2 The author, after the account of Malik Ashraf, who was ruler of Budl\u00eds in A.H. 625 (A.D. 1227), when Jal\u00e1l ad-D\u00edn Mankbar\u00fa, King of Kh\u00e1rizm, took Akhl\u00e1t, passes over his immediate successors, and proceeds at once to H\u00e1jj\u00ed Sharaf Ben Ziy\u00e1 ad-D\u00edn, who was ruler of Budl\u00eds in A.H. 796 (A.D. 1393), when T\u00edm\u00far visited Kurdist\u00e1n. H\u00e1jj\u00ed Sharaf was then the most powerful of the Kurdish chieftains, and may be regarded as the founder of his family.\nM.

He was deposed and blinded by the prime minister Fa\u00efk, in A.H. 389 (A.D. 998). He was succeeded by his brother, 'Abd al-Malik, but the latter never enjoyed independent authority. After the death of 'Abd al-Malik, Ab\u00fa Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Isma'il, another son of N\u00fah, continued for nearly six years to lead a wandering and predatory life, and was put to death in A.H. 395 (A.D. 1004), whilst on his way from N\u00eds\u00e1 to Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, by M\u00e1hr\u00fal, one of Mahm\u00fad Ben Sabuktag\u00edn's agents.

Account of some of the descendants of B\u00e1zanjar Kh\u00e1n, to the time of Ab\u00fa al-Khair Kh\u00e1n, who reigned for about forty years over the Dasht of Kipch\u00e1k, from the country of the R\u00fas (Russia), to the boundary of Bulgh\u00e1r and Turkist\u00e1n, and was the grandfather of Muhammad Shaib\u00e1n\u00ed Kh\u00e1n.\n\nBook I.\u2014Account of the subjugation of M\u00e1war\u00e1 an-Nahr and Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, by Muhammad Shaib\u00e1n\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, who is sometimes called Sh\u00e1hi B\u00e9g Kh\u00e1n; of his death in A.H. 916 (A.D. 1510); and a history of his successors, who are known as the Shaib\u00e1n\u00edyah.\n\n---\n\n1 In the preface he is named Am\u00edr Ham\u00edd Muhammad Ben N\u00fah Ben Nasr Ben Isma\u02bfil as-S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed; this must, however, be the Am\u00edr N\u00fah, who bore the title of Am\u00edr Ham\u00edd. From the date it cannot be his son. In the account of holy and learned men alluded to in note 1, p. 151, it is correctly said that An-Narshakh\u00ed lived in the time of Ab\u00fa Muhammad N\u00fah Ben Nasr as-S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed, and that he wrote his account of Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1 in A.H. 337 (A.D. 948).\n\n2 In another place this name is written Ab\u00fa Nasr Ahmad Ben Muhammad Ben Muhammad al-Kab\u00e1wi.\nSult\u00e1ns of M\u00e1war\u00e1 an-Nahr, to the murder of \u2019Abd al-M\u00famin Kh\u00e1n, son of \u2019Abd Allah Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, in A.H. 1006 (A.D. 1597).\u00b9\n\nBook II.\u2014Account of the origin of the Astarkh\u00e1n\u00ed\u00b2 Sult\u00e1ns of Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, and the history of that dynasty, from the accession of J\u00e1n\u00ed Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, who was raised to the throne by the Am\u00edrs of Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, on the murder of \u2019Abd al-M\u00famin Kh\u00e1n,\u00b3 to the death of Sayyid Subh\u00e1n Kul\u00ed Muhammad Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, in A.H. 1114 (A.D. 1702).\n\nBook III.\u2014Account of the reign of Ab\u00fa al-Muzaffar Sayyid Muhammad Muk\u00edm Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, from his accession at Balkh, in A.H. 1114 (A.D. 1702) to A.H. 1116 (A.D. 1704).\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i Muk\u00edm Kh\u00e1n\u00ed is of the greatest value, as treating of a period of the history of Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, of which but little knowledge can be gained from other works. The information we possess regarding the princes of the Shaib\u00e1n\u00ed dynasty, who were remarkable for the conquest of M\u00e1war\u00e1 an-Nahr, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and Kh\u00e1z\u00edzm, and for the expulsion of B\u00e1bar, is very insufficient. The history of the Astarkh\u00e1n\u00ed Sult\u00e1ns, almost, if not quite, unknown to European authors, is not, I believe, to be found recorded in any of the Oriental histories with which we are at present acquainted, if we except the somewhat scanty details given in the Mir\u00e1t al-\u2019\u00c1lam,\u2074 and two next following works.

He, however, declined the sovereignty, on the ground that, although he was descended from Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, yet his son D\u00edn Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, being related to the Shaib\u00e1n\u00ed family, through his mother, had on that account a greater right to the throne than himself. D\u00edn Muhammad Kh\u00e1n was accordingly proclaimed king instead of his father. J\u00e1n\u00ed Muhammad Kh\u00e1n is nevertheless reckoned by the author as one of the sovereigns of Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\n\u2074 Described supra, No. XLIV.\nContents:\n\nI.\u2014Account of the wives and children of Chaug\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, J\u00faj\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, and his descendants.

The first part appears to have been written in the reign of Iskandar Kh\u00e1n Shaib\u00e1n\u00ed, as the author puts after that monarch's name the common formula of \"May his dominion endure for ever.\" At the end of this first part occur the words \"conclusion of the history,\" and on the next page the account of the Astarkh\u00e1n\u00ed kings begins without any preface or rubric. I have thought it best, however, to consider the two as one work, since the history is continuous, with but a slight interval between the two parts, and there is nowhere any indication as to the title or author.\n\nFoll. 31.

The dates are in most instances expressed in figures as well as by the chronograms, and the whole work is arranged in chronological order.\n\nIt would be impossible to give the exact contents of this curious volume without extracting the title of each article. It is almost entirely confined to the \u00dazbak kings and chiefs, and the holy and learned men, &c., who lived during the time of the Sultans of M\u00e1war\u00e1 an-Nahr; and though it is professedly only a collection of dates, yet, as I have already stated, it comprises a quantity of valuable historical information, giving the parentage and descendants of the sovereigns and chiefs who are mentioned, and a concise account of the most important events in which they took part. In the first portion of the work we can gather a good account of the Muzaffarides, the Sarbadarians, and the immediate descendants of T\u00edm\u00far; and the latter part furnishes a tolerably full though scattered history of the Sultans of M\u00e1war\u00e1 an-Nahr, to the time of Nadr Muhammad Kh\u00e1n. The arrangement of the work, and its miscellaneous character, is somewhat inconvenient, the thread of the story being constantly broken by the insertion of biographies of Shaikhs and others, who were in no way connected with the history of the period in which they lived. Taking it altogether it will, however, be found of great use in tracing the history of M\u00e1war\u00e1 an-Nahr, whilst many of the biographical notices are of considerable interest.\n\nThe system of expressing dates by chronograms is of greater utility than might be imagined, since it leaves but little chance of the errors which so commonly arise in MSS., from the uncertain transcription of numerals, and the similarity of several words, when the dates are written at length by a careless scribe.\n\nThis MS., as well as the three preceding, was purchased at Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, by the late Sir Alexander Burnes, in the year 1832, and the whole four were presented by him to the Society.\n\nFoll. 227.
