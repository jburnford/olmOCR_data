The contents would no doubt yield no new matter of philosophic tradition. But they would certainly teach something respecting such points as pre-Aristotelian logical methods, and the procedure followed in one or more schools for rendering students conversant with the concepts in psychology, ethics and metaphysic accepted or debated by the culture of the age.\n\nReaders whose sympathies are not confined to the shores of the Mediterranean and \u00c6gean seas will feel a stir of interest, similar in kind if fainter in degree, on becoming more closely acquainted with the Buddhist text-book entitled Dhamma-Sangayi. The English edition of the Pali text, prepared for the Pali Text Society by Professor Dr. Ed. M\u00fcller, and published fifteen years ago, has so far failed to elicit any critical discussion among Pali scholars. A cursory inspection may have revealed little but what seemed dry, prolix and sterile. Such was, at\nleast, the verdict of a younger worker, now, alas! no more.\\footnote{H. C. Warren, 'Buddhism in Translations,' xviii. Cf. Kern, 'Indian Buddhism,' p. 3.}\n\nCloser study of the work will, I believe, prove less ungrateful, more especially if the conception of it as a student's manual be kept well in view. The method of the book is explicative, deductive; its object was, not to add to the Dhamma, but to unfold the orthodox import of terms in use among the body of the faithful, and, by organizing and systematizing the aggregate of doctrinal concepts, to render the learner's intellect both clear and efficient.\n\nEven a superficial inspection of the Manual should yield great promise to anyone interested in the history of psychology. When upwards of six years ago my attention was first drawn to it, and the desirability of a translation pointed out by Professor Rhys Davids, I was at once attracted by the amount of psychological material embedded in its pages. Buddhist philosophy is ethical first and last. This is beyond dispute. But among ethical systems there is a world of difference in the degree of importance attached to the psychological prolegomena of ethics. In ethical problems we are on a basis of psychology, depending for our material largely upon the psychology of conation or will,\\footnote{Cf. G. C. Robertson, 'Elements of General Philosophy,' pp. 191, 197; 'Philosophical Remains,' p. 3; A. Bain, 'Moral Science'\u2014'The Psychological Data of Ethics.' 'Every ethical system involves a psychology of conduct, and depends for its development upon its idea of what conduct actually is' (C. Douglas, 'The Philosophy of J. S. Mill,' p. 251).} with its co-efficients of feeling and intelligence. And in the history of human ideas, in so far as it clusters about those problems, we find this dependence either made prominent or slurred over. Treated superficially, if suggestively and picturesquely, in Plato, the nature and functions of that faculty in man, whereby he is constituted an ethical and political 'animal,' are by Aristotle analyzed at length. But the Buddhists were, in a way, more advanced in the\npsychology of their ethics than Aristotle\u2014in a way, that is, which would now be called scientific. Rejecting the assumption of a psyche and of its higher manifestations or nous, they were content to resolve the consciousness of the Ethical Man, as they found it, into a complex continuum of subjective phenomena. They analyzed this continuum, as we might, exposing it, as it were, by transverse section. But their treatment was genetic. The distinguishable groups of dhamma\u2014of states or mental psychoses\u2014'arise' in every case in consciousness, in obedience to certain laws of causation, physical and moral\u2014that is, ultimately, as the outcome of antecedent states of consciousness. There is no exact equivalent in Pali, any more than there is in Aristotle, for the relatively modern term 'consciousness,' yet is the psychological standpoint of the Buddhist philosophy virtually as thoroughgoing in its perceptual basis as that of Berkeley. It was not solipsism any more than Berkeley's immaterialism was solipsistic. It postulated other percipients as Berkeley did, together with, not a Divine cause or source of percepts, but the implicit Monism of early thought veiled by a deliberate Agnosticism. And just as Berkeley, approaching philosophical questions through psychology, 'was the first man to begin a perfectly scientific doctrine of sense-perception as a psychologist,' so Buddhism, from a quite early stage of its development, set itself to analyze and classify mental processes with remarkable insight and sagacity. And on the results of that psychological analysis it sought to base the whole rationale of its practical doctrine and discipline. From studying the processes of attention, and the nature of sensation, the range and depth of feeling and the plasticity of the will in desire and in control, it organized its system of personal self-culture.\n\n1 Utu and kamma.\n2 Cf. e.g. below, p. 272 [1045].\n3 G. C. Robertson, op. cit., p. 154.\nGermany has already a history of psychology half completed on the old lines of the assumed monopoly of ancient thought by a small area of the inhabited world. England has not yet got so far. Is it too much to hope that, when such a work is put forth, the greater labour of a wider and juster initiative will have been undertaken, and the development of early psychological thought in the East have been assigned its due place in this branch of historical research?\n\nII.\n\nThe Date of the Manual.\n\nWe can fortunately fix the date of the Dhamma-Sang\u0101ni within a limit that, for an Indian book, may be considered narrow. Its aim is to systematize or formulate certain doctrines, or at least to enumerate and define a number of scattered terms or categories of terms, occurring in the great books of dialogues and sundry discourse entitled the Nik\u0101yas of the Sutta Pi\u1e6daka. The whole point of view, psychological and philosophical, adopted in them is, in our Manual, taken for granted. The technical terms used in them are used in it as if its hearers, subsequently its readers, would at once recognise them. No one acquainted with those books, and with the Dhamma-Sang\u0101ni, will hesitate in placing the latter, in point of time, after the Nik\u0101yas.\n\nOn the other hand, the kind of questions raised in our Manual are on a different plane altogether from those raised in the third book in the Abhidhamma Pi\u1e6daka, viz., the Kath\u0101 Vatthu, which we know to have been composed by Tissa at Patna, in the middle of the third century B.C.\u00b9\n\nThe Dhamma-Sang\u0101ni does not attempt to deal with any such advanced opinions and highly-elaborated points of doctrine as are put forward by those supposed opponents of the orthodox philosophy who are the interlocutors in the Kath\u0101 Vatthu. It remains altogether, or almost altogether, at the old standpoint of the Nik\u0101yas as regards\n\n\u00b9 Atthas\u0101lin\u012b, p. 3; Mah\u0101 Bodhi Va\u1e47sa, p. 110.\ndoctrine, differing only in method of treatment. The Kath\u0101 Vatthu raises new questions belonging to a later stage in the development of the faith.\n\nThe Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i is therefore younger than the Nik\u0101yas, and older than the Kath\u0101 Vatthu. If we date it half-way between the two, that is, during the first third of the fourth century B.C. (contemporary, therefore, with the childhood of Aristotle, b. 384), we shall be on the safe side. But I am disposed to think that the interval between the completion of the Nik\u0101yas and the compilation of the Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i is less than that between the latter work and the Kath\u0101 Vatthu; and that our manual should therefore be dated rather at the middle than at the end of the fourth century B.C., or even earlier. However that may be, it is important for the historian of psychology to remember that the ideas it systematizes are, of course, older. Practically all of them go back to the time of the Buddha himself. Some of them are older still.\n\nThe history of the text of our Manual belongs to that of the canonical texts taken collectively. There are, however, two interesting references to it, apart from the general narrative, in the Mah\u0101 Va\u1e47sa, which show, at least, that the Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i was by no means laid on the shelf among later Buddhists. King Kassapa V. of Ceylon (A.D. 929-939) had a copy of it engraved on gold plates studded with jewels, and took it in procession with great honour to a vih\u0101ra he had built, and there offered flowers to it.\u00b9 Another King of Ceylon, Vijaya B\u0101hu I. (A.D. 1065-1120), shut himself up every morning for a time against his people in the beautiful Hall of Exhortation, and there made a translation of the Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i, no doubt from Pali into Sinhalese.\u00b2\n\nI can testify to the seriousness of the task, and feel a keen sympathy with my royal predecessor, and envy withal for his proximity in time and place to the seat of orthodox tradition. Nothing, unfortunately, is now known, so far\n\n\u00b9 Mah., ch. l., vers. 50, 51, 56. \u00b2 Ibid., ch. lxx., ver. 17.\nas I have been able to ascertain, of this work, in which\nthe translator was very likely aided by the best scholarship\nof the day, and which might have saved me from many a\ndoubt and difficulty.\n\nIII.\n\nOn the Commentaries and the Importance of the\nAtthas\u0101lin\u012b.\n\nIt will be seen from Appendix I. that the last part of the\ntext of our Manual is a supplement added to it by way of\ncommentary, or rather of interpretation and digest. It is,\nperhaps, not surprising that so much of this kind of\nmaterial has survived within the four corners of the\nPitakas. We have the Old Commentary embedded in the\nVinaya, and the Pariv\u0101ra added as a sort of supple-\nmentary examination paper to it. Then there is the\nNiddesa, a whole book of commentary, on texts now\nincluded in the Sutta Nip\u0101ta, and there are passages\nclearly of a commentarial nature scattered through the\nNik\u0101yas. Lastly, there is the interesting fragment of\ncommentary tacked on to the Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i itself\n(below, p. 357). As these older incorporated commentaries\nare varied both in form and in method, it is evident that\ncommentary of different kinds had a very early beginning.\nAnd the probability is very great that the tradition is not\nso far wrong, when it tells us that commentaries on all the\nprincipal canonical books were handed down in schools of\nthe Order along with the texts themselves.\n\nThis is not to maintain that all of the Commentaries\nwere so handed down in all the schools, nor that each of\nthem was exactly the same in each of the schools where it\nwas taught. But wherever Commentaries were so handed\ndown, tradition tells us that they were compiled, and subse-\nquently written, in the dialect of the district where the\nschool was situated. From two places, one in India and\nthe other in Ceylon, we have works purporting to give in\nPali the substance of such ancient traditional comment as\nhad been handed down in the local vernacular. One of\nthese is the Atthas\u0101lin\u012b, Buddhaghosa's reconstruction, in Pali, of the Commentary on our present work, as handed down in Sinhalese at the school of the Great Monastery, the Mah\u0101 Vih\u0101ra at Anur\u0101dhapura in Ceylon.\n\nThe Mah\u0101 Va\u1e47\u1e47a, indeed, says (p. 251) that he wrote this work at Gay\u0101, in North India, before he came to Anur\u0101dhapura. This, however, must be a mistake, if it refers to the work as we have it. For in that work he frequently quotes from and refers to another work which he certainly wrote after his arrival in Ceylon, namely, the Visuddhi Magga, and once or twice he refers to the Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101, which he also wrote in Ceylon.\n\nThe Sadhamma Sangaha\\(^1\\) has two apparently inconsistent statements which suggest a solution. The first is that he wrote, at the Vih\u0101ra at Gay\u0101, a work called the 'Uprising of Knowledge' (N\u0101\u1e47odaya), and a Commentary on the Dhamma-Sangani, called the Atthas\u0101lin\u012b, and began to write one on the Parittas. Then it was that he was urged to go, and actually did go, to Ceylon to obtain better materials for his work. The second is that, after he had arrived there and had written seven other works, he then wrote the Atthas\u0101lin\u012b. When the same author makes two such statements as these, and in close conjunction, he may well mean to say that a work already written in the one place was revised or rewritten in the other.\n\nDhamma Kitti, the author of the Sadhamma Sangaha, adds the interesting fact that, in revising his Atthas\u0101lin\u012b, Buddhaghosa relied, not on the Mah\u0101 \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101 in Sinhalese, but on another Commentary in that language called the Mah\u0101 Paccari.\n\nWe know, namely, that at the time when Buddhaghosa wrote\u2014that is, in the early part of the fifth century A.D.\u2014the Commentaries handed down in the schools had been, at various times and places, already put together into treatises and written books in the native dialects. And we know the names of several of those then existing. These are:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal of the Pali Text Society, 1888, pp. 53, 56.\n1.

But this we can no longer hope to do. The numerous stories of Ceylon Theras occurring in the book are almost certainly due to the author's residence in Ceylon. And we cannot be certain that these and the reference to his own book, written in Ceylon, are the only additions. We cannot, therefore, take the opinions expressed in the book as evidence of Buddhist opinion as held in Gay\u0101. That may, in great part, be so. But we cannot tell in which part.\n\nIn the course of his work Buddhaghosa quotes often from the Nik\u0101yas without mentioning the source of his quotations; and also from the Vibhanga\\(^2\\) and the Mah\u0101 Pakara\u1e47a\\(^3\\) (that is, the Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na), giving their names.

Nor is it clear who were the Por\u0101\u1e47\u0101 or Ancients, though it seems likely, from the passages quoted, that they were Buddhist thinkers of an earlier age, but of a later date than that of our Manual, inasmuch as one of the citations shows that the \u2018Door-theory\u2019 of cognition was already developed (see below, p. lxviii., etc.). From the distinct references to 3 and to 7, it seems possible that the so-called \u2018Great Commentary\u2019 (3) dealt not so much with any particular book, or group of books, as with the doctrines of the Pitakas in general.\n\nThe foregoing notes may prove useful when the times are ready for a full inquiry into the history of the Buddhist Commentaries.\u00b9 With respect to the extent to which the Atthas\u0101lini itself has been quoted in the following pages, it may be judged that the scholastic teaching of eight centuries later is a very fallacious guide in the interpretation of original doctrines, and that we should but darken counsel\n\n\u00b9 I may add that a Tik\u0101, or sub-commentary on the Atthasalini, written by a Siamese scholar, N\u0101nakitti, of unknown date, was edited in Sinhalese characters by Ko\u1e0dagoda Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sekhara of Kalutara, in Ceylon, and published there in 1890.\nif we sought light on Aristotle from medi\u00e6val exegesis of the age of Duns Scotus.\n\nWithout admitting that the course of Buddhist and that of Western culture coincide sufficiently to warrant such a parallel, it may readily be granted that Buddhaghosa must not be accepted en bloc. The distance between the constructive genius of Gotama and his apostles as compared with the succeeding ages of epigoni needs no depreciatory criticism on the labours of the exegetists to make itself felt forcibly enough. Buddhaghosa's philology is doubtless crude, and he is apt to leave cruces unexplained, concerning which an Occidental is most in the dark.\\(^1\\) Nevertheless, to me his work is not only highly suggestive, but also a mine of historic interest. To put it aside is to lose the historical perspective of the course of Buddhist philosophy. It is to regard the age of Gotama and of his early Church as constituting a wondrous 'freak' in the evolution of human ideas, instead of watching to see how the philosophical tradition implanted in that Church (itself based on earlier culture) had in the lapse of centuries been carefully handed down by the schools of Theras, the while the folklore that did duty for natural science had more or less fossilized, and the study of the conscious processes of the mind had been elaborated.\n\nThis is, however, a point of view that demands a fuller examination than can here be given it. I will now only maintain that it is even more suggestive to have at hand the best tradition of the Buddhist schools at the fulness of their maturity for the understanding of a work like the Dhamma-Sanga\u00f1i than for the study of the Dialogues. Our manual is itself a book of reference to earlier books, and presents us with many terms and formul\u00e6 taken out of that setting of occasion and of discourse enshrined in which we meet them in the Nik\u0101yas. The great scholar who comments on them had those Nik\u0101yas, both as to letter and spirit, well pigeon-holed in memory, and cherished both\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Dr. Neumann in 'Die Reden Gotamo Buddhos,' p. xv et seq.\nwith the most reverent loyalty. That this is so, as well as\nthe fact that we are bred on a culture so different in mould\nand methods (let alone the circumstances of its develop-\nment) from that inherited by him, must lend his interpreta-\ntions an importance and a suggestiveness far greater than\nthat which the writings of any Christian commentator on\nthe Greek philosophy can possess for us.\n\nIV.\n\nOn the Method and Argument of the Manual.\n\nThe title given to my translation is not in any way a\nfaithful rendering of the canonical name of the Manual.\nThis is admitted on my title-page. There is nothing very\nintelligible for us in the expression 'Compendium of States,'\nor 'Compendium of Phenomena.' Whether the Buddhist\nmight find it so or not, there is for him at all events a\nstrong and ancient association of ideas attaching to the\ntitle Dhamma-Sangani which for us is entirely non-\nexistent. I have therefore let go the letter, in order to\nindicate what appears to me the real import of the work.\nNamely, that it is, in the first place, a manual or text-book,\nand not a treatise or disquisition, elaborated and rendered\nattractive and edifying after the manner of most of the\nSutta Pitaka. And then, that its subject is ethics, but\nthat the inquiry is conducted from a psychological stand-\npoint, and, indeed, is in great part an analysis of the psycho-\nlogical and psycho-physical data of ethics.\n\nI do not mean to assert that the work was compiled\nsolely for academic use. No such specialized function is\nassigned it in the Commentary. Buddhaghosa only main-\ntains that, together with the rest of the Abhidhamma,1 it\nwas the ipsissima verba of the Buddha, not attempting to\nupset the mythical tradition that it was the special mode\nhe adopted in teaching the doctrine to the 'hosts of devas\ncome from all parts of the sixteen world-systems, he having\n\n1 But including the M\u0101tik\u0101 only of the later Kath\u0101 Vatthu.\nCf. 'Dialogues of the Buddha,' p. xi; Asl., p. 1.\nplaced his mother (re-incarnate as a dev\u012b) at their head because of the glory of her wisdom.\\(^1\\) Whether this myth had grown up to account for the formal, unpicturesque style of the Abhidhamma, on the ground that the devas were above the need of illustration and rhetoric of an earthly kind, I do not know. The Commentary frequently refers to the peculiar difference in style from that employed in the Suttanta as consisting in the Abhidhamma being nippariy\u0101ya-desa\u1e47\u0101\u2014teaching which is not accompanied by explanation or disquisition.\\(^2\\) And the definition it gives, at the outset, of the term Abhidhamma shows that this Pitaka, and a fortiori the Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i, was considered as a subject of study more advanced than the other Pitakas, and intended to serve as the complement and crown of the learner's earlier courses.\\(^3\\) Acquaintance with the doctrine is, as I have said, taken for granted. The object is not so much to extend knowledge as to ensure mutual consistency in the intension of ethical notions, and to systematize and formulate the theories and practical mechanism of intellectual and moral progress scattered in profusion throughout the Suttantas.\\(^4\\)\n\nIt is interesting to note the methods adopted to carry out this object. The work was in the first instance inculcated by way of oral teaching respecting a quantity of matter which had been already learnt in the same way. And the memory, no longer borne along by the interest of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Asl., p. 1.\n\n\\(^2\\) E.g., Asl. 403.

Translated by Mr. A. C. Taylor, J. R. A.

For my part, I have found no reason to limit the manual's dependence on the Suttantas to any one book. Buddhaghosa does not specially connect the two works.\nnarrative or by the thread of an argument, had to be assisted by other devices. First of these is the catechetical method. Questions, according to Buddhist analysis, are put on five several grounds:\\(^1\\)\n\nto throw light on what is not known;\nto compare what one knows with the knowledge of others;\nto clear up doubts;\nto get the premises in an argument granted;\\(^2\\)\nto give a starting-point from which to set out the content of a statement.\n\nThe last is selected as the special motive of the catechizing here resorted to. It is literally the wish to discourse or expound (\\textit{kathetu kamyat\u0101}), but the meaning is more clearly brought out by the familiar formula quoted, viz.: 'Four in number, brethren, are these Advances in Mindfulness. Now which are the Four?' Thus it was held that the questions in the Manual are analytic or explicative, having the object of unfolding and thereby of delimitating the implications of a mass of notions which a study of the Suttantas, if unaided, might leave insufficiently co-ordinated in the mind.\n\nAnd the memory, helped by the interrogative stimulus, was yet further assisted by the symmetrical form of both question and answer, as well as by the generic uniformity in the matter of the questions. Throughout Book I., in the case of each inquiry which opens up a new subject, the answer is set out on a definite plan called \\textit{uddesa}\u2014exposition\u2014and is rounded off invariably by the \\textit{appan\u0101}, or emphatic summing up: 'all these (whatever they may stand for on other occasions or in other systems) on this occasion=\\textit{x}.' The \\textit{uddesa} is succeeded by the \\textit{niddesa}\u2014de-position\u2014\\textit{i.e.}, analytical question and answer on the details of the expository statement. This is indicated formally by the initial adverb \\textit{tattha}\u2014what \\textit{here} (in this\n\n\\(^1\\) Asl. 55, 56; cf. Sum. 68.\n\\(^2\\) A favourite method in the Dialogues. The Cy. quotes as an instance M. i. 232.\nconnexion) is \\(a \\ldots b \\ldots c\\) ? Again, the work is in great part planned with careful regard to logical relation. The Buddhists had not elaborated the intellectual vehicle of genus and species, as the Greeks did, hence they had not the convenience of a logic of Definition. There is scarcely an answer in any of these Niddesas but may perhaps be judged to suffer in precision and lucidity from lack of it. They substitute for definition proper what J. S. Mill might have called predication of \u00e6quipollent terms\u2014in other words, the method of the dictionary. In this way precision of meaning is not to be expected, since nearly all so-called synonyms do but mutually overlap in meaning without coinciding; and hence the only way to ensure no part of the connotation being left out is to lump together a number of approximate equivalents, and gather that the term in question is defined by such properties as the aggregate possesses in common. If this is the rationale of the Buddhist method, the inclusion, in the answer, of the very term which is to be defined becomes no longer the fallacy it is in Western logic. Indeed, where there is no pursuit of exact science, nor of sciences involving 'physical division,' but only a system of research into the intangible products and processes of mind and character, involving aspects and phases, i.e., logical division, I am not sure that a good case might not be made out for Buddhist method. It is less rigid, and lends itself better, perhaps, to a field of thought where 'a difference in aspects is a difference in things.'\n\nHowever that may be, the absence of a development of the relation of Particular and Universal, of One and All, is met by a great attention to degree of Plurality. Number plays a great part in Buddhist classes and categories.\\(^2\\) Whether this was inherited from a more ancient lore, such as Pythagoras is said to have drawn from, or whether this feature was artificially developed for mnemonic purposes, I do not know. Probably there is truth in both alternatives.\n\n\\(^1\\) Professor J. Ward, Ency. Brit., 9th ed., 'Psychology.'\n\\(^2\\) Cf. especially, not only Book II. of this work, but also the whole of the Anguttara.\nBut of all numbers none plays so great a part in aiding methodological coherency and logical consistency as that of duality. I refer of course especially to its application in the case of the correlatives, Positive and Negative.\n\nThroughout most of Book II. the learner is greatly aided by being questioned on positive terms and their opposites, taken simply and also in combination with other similarly dichotomized pairs. The opposite is not always a contradictory. Room is then left in the 'universe of discourse' for a third class, which in its turn comes into question. Thus the whole of Book I. is a development of the triplet of questions with which Book III. begins (a-kusalam being really the Contrary of kusalam, though formally its Contradictory): What is A? What is B? What is (ab), i.e., non-A and non-B? In Book III. there is no obvious ground of logic or method for the serial order or limits observed in the 'Clusters' or Groups, and the interpolated sets of 'Pairs' of miscellaneous questions. Nevertheless a uniform method of catechizing characterizes the former.\n\nFinally, there is, in the way of mnemonic and intellectual aid, the simplifying and unifying effect attained by causing all the questions (exclusive of sub-inquiries) to refer to the one category of dhamma.\n\nThere is, it is true, a whole Book of questions referring to rupam, but this constitutes a very much elaborated sub-inquiry on 'form' as one sub-species of a species of dhamma\u2014rupino dhamma, as distinguished from all the rest, which are arupino dhamma. This will appear more clearly if the argument of the work is very concisely stated.\n\nThose who can consult the text will see that the Matika, or table of subjects of all the questions (which I have not held it useful to reproduce), refers exclusively to Book III. Book III. in fact contains the entire work considered as an inquiry (not necessarily exhaustive) into the concrete, or, as one might say, the applied ethics of Buddhism. In it many if not all fundamental concepts\nare taken as already defined and granted. Hence Books I. and II. are introductory and, as it were, of the nature of inquiry into data. Book II. is psycho-physical; Book I. is psychological. Together they constitute a very elaborate development, and again a sub-development, of the first triplet of questions in Book III., viz.: dhamma which are good, i.e., make good karma, those which are bad, and those which make no karma (the indeterminates). Now, of these last some are simply and solely results\\(^1\\) of good or bad dhamma, and some are not so, but are states of mind and expressions of mind entailing no moral result (on the agent).\\(^2\\) Some again, while making no karma, are of neither of these two species, but are dhamma which might be called either unmoral (rupam),\\(^3\\) or else supermoral (uncompounded element or Nirvana).\\(^4\\) These are held to constitute a third and fourth species of the third class of dhamma called indeterminate. But the former of the two alone receives detailed and systematic treatment.\n\nHence the whole manual is shown to be, as it professes to be, a compendium, or, more literally, a co-enumeration of dhamma.\n\nThe method of treatment or procedure termed Abhidhamma (for Abhidhamma is treatment rather than matter) is, according to the M\u0101tik\u0101, held to end at the end of the chapter entitled Pitthidukam or Supplementary Set of Pairs. The last thirty-seven pairs of questions\\(^5\\) and answers, on the other hand, are entitled Suttantikadukam. They are of a miscellaneous character, and are in many cases not logically opposed. Buddhaghosa has nothing to say by way of explaining their inclusion, nor the principle determining their choice or number. Nor is it easy to deduce any explanation from the nature or the treatment of them. The name Suttantika may mean that they are pairs of terms met with in the Dialogues, or\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Book I., Part III., ch. i.  \n\\(^2\\) Ibid., ch. ii.  \n\\(^3\\) Book II.  \n\\(^4\\) Appendix II.  \n\\(^5\\) \u00a7\u00a7 1296-1366.\nin all the four Nik\u0101yas. This is true and verifiable. But I for one cannot venture to predicate anything further respecting them.\n\nV.\n\nOn the Chief Subject of Inquiry\u2014Dhamma.\n\nIf I have called Buddhist ethics psychological, especially as the subject is treated in this work, it is much in the same way in which I should call Plato's psychology ethical. Neither the founders of Buddhism nor of Platonic Socratism had elaborated any organic system of psychology or of ethics respectively. Yet it is hardly overstating the case for either school of thought to say that whereas the latter psychologized from an ethical standpoint, the former built their ethical doctrine on a basis of psychological principles. For whatever the far-reaching term dhammo may in our manual have precisely signified to the early Buddhists, it invariably elicits, throughout Book I., a reply in terms of subjective consciousness. The discussion in the Commentary, which I have reproduced below, p. 2, note 3, on dhammarammanam, leaves it practically beyond doubt that dhammo, when thus related to mano, is as a visual object to visual perception\u2014is, namely, mental object in general. It thus is shown to be equivalent to Herbart's Vorstellung, to Locke's idea\u2014'whatsoever is the immediate object of perception, thought or understanding'\u2014and to Professor Ward's 'presentation.'\n\nThe dhamma in question always prove to be, whatever their ethical value, factors of cittam used evidently in its widest sense, i.e., concrete mental process or state. Again, the analysis of r\u016bpam in Book II., as a species of 'indeterminate' dhamma, is almost wholly a study in the phenomena of sensation and of the human organism as sentient. Finally, in Book III. the questions on various dhamma are for the most part answered in terms of the four mental skandhas, of the citt\u0101ni dealt with in Book I., and of the springs of action as shown in their\n\n1 'Ency. Brit.,' 9th ed., art. 'Psychology.'\neffect on will. Thus the whole inquiry in its most generalized expression comes practically to this: Given man as a moral being, what do we find to be the content of his consciousness?\n\nNow this term dhammo is, as readers are already aware, susceptible of more than one interpretation. Even when used for the body of ethical doctrine it was applied with varying extension, i.e., either to the whole doctrine, or to the Suttantas as opposed to Vinaya and Abhidhamma, or to the doctrine of the Four Truths only. But whatever in this connexion is the denotation, the connotation is easy to fix. That this is not the case where the term has, so to speak, a secular or 'profane' meaning is seen in the various renderings and discussions of it. The late H. C. Warren in particular has described the difficulties, first of determining what the word, in this or that connexion, was intended to convey, and then of discovering any word or words adequate to serve as equivalent to it. One step towards a solution may be made if we can get at a Buddhist survey of the meanings of dhammo from the Buddhists' own philosophical point of view. And this we are now enabled to do in consequence of the editing of the Atthas\u0101lini. In it we read Buddhaghosa's analysis of the term, the various meanings it conveyed to Buddhists of the fifth century A.D., and his judgment, which would be held as authoritative, of the special significance it possessed in the questions of the Dhamma-sangani. 'The word dhammo,' runs the passage (p. 38), 'is met with [as meaning] doctrine (pariyatti), condition or cause (hetu), virtue or good quality (guna), absence of essence or of living soul (nissatta-nijjivata),' etc. Illustrative texts are then given of each meaning, those referring to the last being the beginning of the answer in our Manual.\n\n1 Cf., e.g., Oldenberg, 'Buddha,' etc., 3rd ed., p. 290; Warren, 'Buddhism in Translations,' pp. 116, 364; Kern, 'Indian Buddhism,' p. 51, n. 3; Neumann, 'Reden des Gotamo,' pp. 13, 23, 91; Gogerly, 'Ceylon Friend,' 1874, p. 21.\nnumbered [121]: 'Now at that time there are states'; and, further, the passage from the Satipatth\u0101nasutta\u00b9: 'Concerning dhammas he abides watchful over dhammas.' And it is with the fourth and last-named meaning of dhammo that the term is said to be used in the questions of the Manual. Again, a little later (p. 40), he gives a more positive expression to this particular meaning by saying that dhammo, so employed, signifies 'that which has the mark of bearing its nature' (or character or condition\u2014sabh\u0101vadh\u0101ran\u014d). This to us somewhat obscure characterization may very likely, in view of the context, mean that dhammo as phenomenon is without substratum, is not a quality cohering in a substance. 'Phenomenon' is certainly our nearest equivalent to the negative definition of nissatta-nijjivam, and this is actually the rendering given to dhammo (when employed in this sense in the Sutta just quoted) by Dr. Neumann: 'Da wacht ein M\u00f6nch bei den Erscheinungen...'. If I have used states, or states of consciousness, instead of phenomena, it is merely because, in the modern tradition of British psychology, 'states of consciousness' is exactly equivalent to such phenomena as are mental, or at least conscious. And, further, because this use of 'states' has been taken up into that psychological tradition on the very same grounds as prompted this Buddhist interpretation of dhamm\u0101\u2014the ground of non-committal, not to say negation, with respect to any psychical substance or entity.\n\nThat we have, in this country pre-eminently, gone to work after the manner of electrical science with respect to its subject-matter, and psychologized without a psyche, is of course due to the influence of Hume. In selecting a term so characteristic of the British tradition as 'states' of mind or consciousness, I am not concerned to justify its use in the face of a tendency to substitute terms more expressive of a dynamic conception of mental operations, or of otherwise altered standpoints. The Buddhists seem\n\n\u00b9 D. (suttanta 22); M. i. 61.\nto have held, as our psychology has held, that for purposes of analysis it was justifiable to break up the mental continuum of the moral individuality into this or that congeries of states or mental phenomena. In and through these they sought to trace the working of moral causation. To look beneath or behind them for a 'thing in itself' they held to be a dangerous superstition. With Goethe they said: 'Suche nichts hinter den Ph\u00e4nomenen; sie selbst sind die Lehre!' And in view of this coincidence of implication and emphasis, 'states of mind' or 'of consciousness' seemed best to fit dhamma when the reply was made in terms of mental phenomena.\n\nIn the book on Form, the standpoint is no doubt shifted to a relatively more objective consideration of the moral being and his contact with a world considered as external. But then the word dhamma (and my rendering of it) is also superseded by rupa.\n\nIt is only when we come to the more synthetic matter of Book III. that dhamma strains the scope of the term I have selected if 'states' be taken as strictly states of mind or of consciousness. It is true that the Buddhist view of things so far resembles the Berkelean that all phenomena, or things or sequences or elements, or however else we may render dhamma, may be regarded as in the last resort 'states of mind.' This in its turn may seem a straining of the significance which the term possessed for early Buddhists in a more general inquiry such as that of Book III. Yet consider the definitions of dhamma, worthy of Berkeley himself, on p. 272 [1044-45].\n\nThe difficulty lay in the choice of another term, and none being satisfactory, I retained, for want of a better, the same rendering, which is, after all, indefinite enough to admit of its connoting other congeries of things or aspects beside consciousness.\n\nThe fundamental importance in Buddhist philosophy of this Phenomenalism or Non-substantialism as a protest against the prevailing Animism, which, beginning with projecting the self into objects, elaborated that projected self\ninto noumenal substance, has by this time been more or less admitted. The testimony of the canonical books leaves no doubt on the matter, from Gotama's first sermon to his first converts,\\(^1\\) and his first Dialogue in the 'Long Collection,' to the first book of the Kath\u0101 Vatthu.\\(^2\\) There are other episodes in the books where the belief in a permanent spiritual essence is, together with a number of other speculations, waived aside as subjects calculated to waste time and energy. But in the portions referred to the doctrine of repudiation is more positive, and may be summed up in one of the refrains of the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya: Su\u1e47\u00f1am ida\u1e41 attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101 ti\u2014Void is this of soul or of aught of the nature of soul!\\(^3\\) The force of the often repeated 'This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my Self,' is not intended to make directly for goodness but for truth and insight. 'And since neither self nor aught belonging to self, brethren, can really and truly be accepted, is not the heretical position which holds:\u2014This is the world and this is the self, and I shall continue to be in the future, permanent, immutable, eternal, of a nature that knows no change, yea, I shall abide to eternity!\u2014is not this simply and entirely a doctrine of fools?'\\(^4\\)\n\nAnd now that the later or scholastic doctrine, as shown in the writings of the greatest of the Buddhist scholastics, becomes accessible, it is seen how carefully and conscientiously this anti-substantialist position had been cherished and upheld. Half-way to the age of the Commentators, the Milinda-pa\u00f1ho places the question of soul-theory at the head of the problems discussed. Then turning to Buddhaghosa we find the emphatic negation of the Suman-gala Vil\u0101sin\u012b (p. 194):\u2014'Of aught within called self which looks forward or looks around, &c., there is none!' matched\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) S. ii. 66-8; also in Mah\u0101 Vagga, i. 6, 38-47.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Rhys Davids' 'American Lectures,' pp. 39, 40.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or 'self' (attena). M. i. 297; ii. 263 (leye su\u1e47\u00f1am); cf. S. iv. 54; and K. V. 67, 579. Cf. the 'Emptiness-concept,' below, p. 33.\n\n\\(^4\\) M. i. 138.\nin the Atthas\u0101lini, not only by the above-given definition of dhamma's, but also by the equally or even more emphatic affirmation respecting them, given in my note 1 to p. 33:\u2014'There is no permanent entity or self which acquires the states... these are to be understood phenomenally (sabh\u0101vatthena). There is no other essence or existence or personality or individual whatever.' Again, attention is drawn in the notes to his often-reiterated comment that when a disposition or emotion is referred to cittam, e.g., nandir\u0101go cittassa,\u00b9 the repudiation of an ego is thereby implied. Once more, the thoughts and acts which are tainted with '\u0100savas' or with corruptions are said to be so in virtue of their being centred in the soul or self,\u00b2 and those which have attained that 'ideal Better,' and have no 'beyond' (an-uttar\u0101) are interpreted as having transcended or rejected the soul or self.\u00b3\n\nTo appreciate the relative consistency with which the Buddhists tried to govern their philosophy, both in subject and in treatment, in accordance with this fundamental principle, we must open a book of Western psychology, more or less contemporary, such as the 'De Anima,' and note the sharply contrasted position taken up at the outset.\n\n'The object of our inquiry,' Aristotle says in his opening sentences, 'is to study and ascertain the nature and essence of the Psyche, as well as its accidents... It may be well to distinguish... the genus to which the Psyche belongs, and determine what it is... whether it is a something and an essence, or quantity, or quality... whether it is among entities in potentiality, or whether rather it is a reality... Now, the knowledge of anything in itself seems to be useful towards a right conception of the causes of the accidents in substances... But the knowledge of the accidents contributes largely in its turn towards knowing what the thing essentially is... Thus the\n\n\u00b9 P. 277, n. 2; also pp. 129, note 1; 298, note 3, &c.; and cf. p. 175, p. 1. See also on dh\u0101tu, p. lxxvii.\n\u00b2 P. 294, n. 7; 327, n. 1.\n\u00b3 P. 336, n. 2.\nessence is the proper beginning for every demonstration...\n\nThe whole standpoint which the Buddhists brought into question, and decided to be untenable as a basis of sound doctrine, is here accepted and taken as granted. A phenomenon, or series of phenomena, is, on being held up for investigation, immediately and unhesitatingly looked upon under one of two aspects: either it must be a substance, essence, reality, or it belongs to one of those nine other 'Categories'\u2014quantity, quality, etc.\u2014which constitute the phenomenon an attribute or group of attributes cohering in a substance.\n\nIt is true that Aristotle was too progressive and original a thinker to stop here. In his theory of mind as \\(\\epsilon\\delta\\sigma\\varsigma\\) or 'form,' in itself mere potentiality, but becoming actuality as implicate in, and as energizing body, he endeavoured to transform the animism of current standpoints into a more rational conception. And in applying his theory he goes far virtually to resolve mind into phenomenal process (De An., III., chaps. vii., viii.). But he did not, or would not, wrench himself radically out of the primitive soil and plant his thought on a fresh basis, as the Buddhist dared to do. Hence Greek thought abode, for all his rationalizing, saturated with substantialist methods, till it was found acceptable by and was brought up into an ecclesiastical philosophy which, from its Patristic stage, had inherited a tradition steeped in animistic standpoints.\n\nModern science, however, has been gradually training the popular mind to a phenomenalistic point of view, and joining hands in psychology with the anti-substantialist tradition of Hume. So that the way is being paved for a more general appreciation of the earnest effort made by Buddhism\u2014an effort stupendous and astonishing if we consider its date and the forces against it\u2014to sever the growth of philosophic and religious thought from its ancestral stem and rear it in a purely rational soil.\n\nBut the philosophic elaboration of soul-theory into Substantialism is complicated and strengthened by a deeply\nimportant factor, on which I have already touched. This factor is the exploitation by philosophy, not of a primitive Weltanschauung, but of a fundamental fact in intellectual procedure and intellectual economy. I refer to the process of assimilating an indefinite number of particular impressions, on the ground of a common resemblance, into a 'generic idea' or general notion, and of referring to each assimilated product by means of a common name. Every act of cognition, of coming-to-know anything, is reducible to this compound function of discerning the particular and of assimilating it into something relatively general. And this process, in its most abstract terms, is cognizing Unity in Diversity, the One through and beneath the Many.\n\nNow no one, even slightly conversant with the history of philosophy, can have failed to note the connexion there has ever been set up between the concept of substratum and phenomena on the one hand, and that of the One and the Many on the other. They have become blended together, though they spring from distinct roots. And so essential, in every advance made by the intellect to extend knowledge and to reorganize its acquisitions, is the co-ordinating and economizing efficacy of this faculty of generalizing, that its alliance with any other deep-rooted traditional product of mind must prove a mighty stay. A fact in the growth of religious and of philosophic thought which so springs out of the very working and growth of thought in general as this tendency to unify, must seem to rest on unshakeable foundations.\n\nAnd when this implicit logic of intellectual procedure, this subsuming the particular under the general, has been rendered explicit in a formal system of definition and predication and syllogism, such as was worked out by the Greeks, the breach of alliance becomes much harder. For the progress in positive knowledge, as organized by the logical methods, is brought into harmony with progress in religious and philosophic thought.\n\nThis advance in the West is still in force, except in so far as psychological advance, and scientific progress\ngenerally, tell on the traditional logic and philosophy. Psychological analysis, for instance, shows that we may confuse the effective registration of our knowledge with the actual disposition of the originals. That is to say, this perceiving and judging, by way of generalizing and unifying, is the only way by which we are able to master the infinite diversities and approximate uniformities of phenomena. Through such procedure great results are attained. Conceptions are widened and deepened. Laws are discovered and then taken up under more general laws. Knowledge groups all phenomena under a few aspects of all but supreme generality. Unification of knowledge is everywhere considered as the ideal aim of intellect.\n\nBut, after all, this is only the ideal method and economy of intellect. The stenographer's ideal is to compress recorded matter into the fewest symbols by which he can reproduce faithfully. The ideal of the phonograph is to reproduce without the intermediacy of an economical process. Limitations of time and faculty constrain us to become mental stenographers. Whatever be our view as to the reality of an external world outside our perception of it, psychology teaches us to distinguish our fetches of abstraction and generalization for what they are psychologically\u2014i.e., for effective mental shorthand\u2014whatever they may represent besides. The logical form of Universal in term and in proposition is as much a token of our weakness in realizing the Particular as of our strength in constructing what is at best an abstract and hypothetical whole. The philosophical concept of the One is pregnant with powerful associations. To what extent is it simply as a mathematical symbol in a hypothetical cosmos of carefully selected data, whence the infinite concrete is eliminated lest it 'should flow in over us' and overwhelm us?\n\nNow, the Buddhistic phenomenalism had also both the one and the other member of this great alliance of\n\n1 Infra, p. 351: 'Yam . . . p\u0101pak\u0101 akusal\u0101 dhamm\u0101 anv\u0101ssaveyyum.'\nNoumenon and Unity to contend with. But the alliance had, so far at least as we know or can infer, not yet been welded together by a logical organon, or by any development in inductive science. Gotama and his apostles were conversant with the best culture of their age, yet when they shape their discourse according to anything we should call logic, they fall into it rather than wield it after the conscious fashion of Plato or Aristotle. Nor is there, in the books, any clear method practised of definition according to genus and species, or of mutual exclusion among concepts. Thus freer in harness, the Buddhist revolutionary philosophy may be said to have attempted a relatively less impracticable task. The development of a science and art of logic in India, as we know it, was later in time; and though Buddhist thinkers helped in that development, it coincided precisely with the decline of Buddhistic non-substantialism, with the renascence of Pantheistic thought.\n\nVI.\n\nOn the Inquiry into R\u016bpam (Form), and the Buddhist Theory of Sense.\n\nTaking dhamm\u0101, then, to mean phenomena considered as knowledge\u2014in other words, as actually or potentially states of consciousness\u2014we may next look more closely into that which the catechism brings out respecting r\u016bpam (Book II., and \u00a7 583) considered as a species of dhamm\u0101. By this procedure we shall best place ourselves at the threshold, so to speak, of the Buddhist position, both as to its psychology and its view of things in general, and be thus better led up to the ethical import of the questions in the first part.\n\nThe entire universe of dhamm\u0101 is classed with respect to r\u016bpam in questions 1091, 1092 (Book III.). They are there shown to be either r\u016bpino, having form, or a-r\u016bpino, not having form. The positive category comprises 'the four great phenomena (four elements) and all their derivatives.' The negative term refers to what\nwe should call modes or phases of consciousness, or subjective experience\u2014that is, to \u2018the skandhas of feeling, perception, syntheses and intellect\u2019\u2014as well as to \u2018uncompounded element.\u2019 (The skandhas are also \u2018elements\u2019\u2014that is, irreducible but phenomenal factors (see p. 129, n. 1)\u2014but they are compounds.) R\u016bpam would thus appear at first sight to be a name for the external world or for the Extended universe, as contrasted with the unextended, mental, psychical or subjective universe. Personally I do not find, so far, that the Eastern and Western concepts can be so easily made to coincide. It will be better before, and indeed without as yet, arriving at any such conclusive judgment, to inquire into the application made of the term in the Manual generally.\n\nWe find r\u016bpam used in three, at least, of the various meanings assigned to it in the lexicons. It occurs first, and very frequently, as the general name for the objects of the sense of sight. It may then stand as simply r\u016bpam (\u00a7 617, \u2018this which is visual form,\u2019 as opposed to \u00a7 621, etc., \u2018this which is \u201csound,\u201d \u201codour,\u201d etc.). More usually it is spoken of as r\u016bp\u0101rammanam, object of sight (p. 1), or as r\u016bp\u0101yatana\u1e41, sphere (province, Gebiet) of sights or of visual form (pp. 172, 183 et seq.). It includes both sensations of colour and lustre and the complex sensations of form. Used in this connexion, its specialization is, of course, only due to the psychological fact that sight is the spokesman and interpreter of all the senses, so that \u2018I see\u2019 often stands for \u2018I perceive or discern through two or more modes of sensation.\u2019\n\nOn this point it is worth while pointing out an interesting flash of psychological discrimination in the Commentary. It will be noticed, in the various kinds of r\u016bp\u0101yatana\u1e41 enumerated in \u00a7 617 (p. 183, n. 9), that, after pure visual sensations have been instanced, different magnitudes and forms are added, such as \u2018long, short,\u2019 etc. On these\n\n---\n\n1 Cf., e.g., Dhp. A., p. 413: . . . \u2018all the compounds, with their divisions of skandhas, elements and spheres.\u2019\nBuddhaghosa remarks: 'Here, inasmuch as we are able to tell \"long,\" \"short,\" etc., by touch, while we cannot so discern \"blue,\" etc., therefore \"long,\" \"short\" and the rest are not visual forms except inferentially (literally, not visual forms without explanation). A, B, placed in such a relation to C, D, is only by customary usage spoken of as something seen' (Asl. 316).\u00b9 This may not bring us up to Berkeley, but it is a farther step in that direction than Aristotle's mere hint\u2014'There is a movement which is perceptible both by Touch and Sight'\u2014when he is alluding to magnitudes, etc., being 'common sensibles,' i.e., perceptible by more than one sense.\u00b2\n\nTo resume: R\u016bpa\u1e41, in its wider sense (as 'all form'), may be due to the popular generalization and representative function of the sense of sight, expressed in Tennyson's line:\n\n'For knowledge is of things we see . . .'\n\nAnd thus, even as a philosophical concept, it may, loosely speaking, have stood for 'things seen,' as contrasted with the unseen world of dhamm\u0101r\u016bpino. But this is by no means an adequate rendering of the term in its more careful and technical use in the second Book of our Manual. For, as may there be seen, much of the content of 'form' is explicitly declared to be invisible.\u00b3\n\nR\u016bpa\u1e41 occurs next, and, with almost equal frequency, together with its opposite, ar\u016bpa\u1e41, to signify those two other worlds, realms or planes\u2074 of temporal existence,\n\n\u00b9 The symbols are my own adaptation, not a literal rendering. In the account of the 'external senses' or Indriyas given in the (later) S\u0101\u1e45khya text-books, Professor Garbe points out that the objects of sight are limited to colour (r\u016bpa), exclusive of form (Garbe, 'Die S\u0101\u1e45khya Philosophie,' p. 258).\n\u00b2 'De Anim\u00e2,' II. vi.\n\u00b3 Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 597 et seq., 657, 658, 751, 752, etc.\n\u2074 To the employment of 'universe' for avacaram exception may be taken, since the latter term means only a part of the Oriental cosmos. I admit it calls for apology.\nwhich Buddhism accepted along with other current mythology, and which, taken together with the lowest, or sensuous plane of existence, exhaust the possible modes of re-birth. These avacaras, or loci of form and non-form, are described in terms of vague localization (\u00a7\u00a7 1280-85), but it is not easy to realize how far existence of either sort was conceived with anything like precision. Including the 'upper' grades of the world of sensuous existence, they were more popularly known as heaven or sagga (svarga), i.e., the Bright. Their inhabitants were devas, distinguished into hosts variously named. Like the heaven of the West or the Near East, they were located 'above.' Unlike that heaven, life in them was temporal, not eternal.\n\nBut the Dhamma-sangani throws no new light on the kind of states they were supposed to be. Nor does Buddhaghosa here figure as an Eastern Dante, essaying to body out more fully, either dogmatically or as in a dream, such ineffable oracles as were hinted at by a Paul 'caught up to the third heaven . . . whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell\u2014God knoweth,' or the ecstatic visions of a John in lonely exile. The Atthas\u0101lin\u012b is not free from divagations on matters of equally secondary importance to the earnest Buddhist.\u00b9 Yet it has nothing\n\nIf I have used it throughout Book I., it was because there the term avacaram seemed more suggestive of the logician's term 'universe of discourse,' or 'of thought,' than of any physically conceived actuality. It seemed to fit De Morgan's definition of 'the universe of a proposition'\u2014'a collection of all objects which are contemplated as objects about which assertion or denial may take place,' the universe of form, for instance, either as a vague, vast concept 'in' time and effort, or as a state of mind, a rapt abstraction\u2014in either case a 'universe of thought' for the time being.\n\n\u00b9 Cf., e.g., on a similar subject, Sum. 110. He tells us, it is true (see below, p. 196, n. 4), that the food of the gods who inhabited the highest sphere of the sensuous world was of the maximum degree of refinement, leading\nto tell of a mode of being endowed with r\u016bpa, yet without the k\u0101m\u0101, or sensuous impulses held to be bound up with r\u016bpa, when the term is used in its wider sense.\u00b9 Nor does it enlighten us on the more impalpable denizens of a plane of being where r\u016bpa itself is not, and for which no terms seem held appropriate save such as express high fetches of abstract thought.\u00b2 We must go back, after all, to the Nik\u0101yas for such brief hints as we can find. We do hear, at least, in the D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya, of beings in one of the middle circles of the Form heavens termed Radiant (\u0100bhassara), as \u2018made of mind, feeding on joy, radiating light, traversing the firmament, continuing in beauty.\u2019\u00b3 Were it not that we miss here the unending melody sounding through each circle of the Western poet\u2019s Paradise,\u2074 we might well apply this description to Dante\u2019s \u2018anime liete,\u2019 who, like incandescent spheres:\n\n\u2018Fiammando forte, a guisa di comete,\nE come cerchi in tempra d\u2019oriuoli\nSi giran.\u2019\n\nLiker to those brilliant visions the heavens of Form seem to have been than to the \u2018quiet air\u2019 and \u2018the meadow of fresh verdure\u2019 on that slope of Limbo where\n\n\u2018Genti v\u2019 eran con occhi tardi e gravi,\u2019\n\nperhaps to the inference that in the two superior planes it was not required.\n\n\u00b9 See pp. 168-170: \u2018All form is that which is . . . related, or which belongs to the universe of sense, not to that of form, or to that of the formless.\u2019\n\n\u00b2 See the four \u0100ruppas, pp. 71-75.\n\n\u00b3 D. i. 17. Again we read (D. i. 195), that of the three possible \u2018personalities\u2019 of current tradition, one was made of mind, having form, and a complete organism, and one was without form and made of consciousness, or perception (ar\u016bp\u012b sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101mayo).\n\n\u2074 There is no lack of music in some of the lower Indian heavens. Cf., e.g., M. i. 252, on Sakka the god enjoying the music in his sensuous paradise. And see Vim\u0101na Vatthu, passim.\n'Parlavam rado, con voci soavi.'\n\nYet the rare, sweet utterances of these devas of Europe, discoursing with 'the Master of those who know,' may better have accorded with the Buddhist conception of 'beings made of mind' than the choric dances of the spheres above.\n\nAmong these shadowy beings, however, we are far from the fully bodied out idea of the 'all form' and the 'skandha of form' of the second and third Books of the Manual. It may be that the worlds of r\u016bpa and ar\u016bpa were so called in popular tradition because in the former, visible, and in the latter, invisible, beings resided. But whereas attributes concerning either are 'sadly to seek,' there is no lack of information concerning the attributes of form in the 'sensuous universe' or k\u0101m\u0101vacaram. If the list given of these in the first chapter of Book II. be consulted, it will be seen that I have not followed the reading of the P. T. S. edition when it states that all form is k\u0101m\u0101vacaram eva, r\u016bp\u0101vacaram eva, that is, is both related to the universe of sense and also to that of form. The Siamese edition reads k\u0101m\u0101vacaram eva, na r\u016bp\u0101vacaram eva. It may seem at first sight illogical to say that form is not related to the universe of form. But the better logic is really on the side of the Siamese. On page 334 of my translation,\u00b9 it is seen that the avacaras were mutually exclusive as to their contents. To belong to the universe of form involved exclusion from that of sense. But in the inquiry into 'all form' we are clearly occupied with facts about this present world and about women and men as we know them\u2014in a word, with the world of sense. Hence the 'all form' of Book II. is clearly not the form of the r\u016bp\u0101vacaram. It is not used with the same implications.\n\nFurther than this, further than the vague avacara-geography gathered already from other sources, the Manual does not bring us, nor the Commentary either.\n\n\u00b9 \u00a7\u00a7 1281-1284 of the P. T. S.'s edition.\nWe come then to r\u016bpam in the sensuous plane of being, or at least to such portion of that plane as is concerned with human beings: to sabbam r\u016bpam and to its distribution in each human economy, termed r\u016bpakha\u1e47\u1e0do. Whether taken generally, or under the more specialized aspect, there seems to be unanimity of teaching concerning the various manifestations of it.\\(^1\\) Under it are comprised four ultimate primary, or underivable constituents and twenty-three secondary, dependent or derived modes. Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{R\u016bpam} \\\\\n\\text{No up\u0101d\u0101} & \\quad \\text{Up\u0101d\u0101} \\\\\n(a) \\text{The Tangible} & = (a) \\text{The Five Senses}, \\\\\n(i.e., earthy or solid, lambent or fiery, gaseous or aerial elements, or great phenomena), & (b) \\text{The Four Objects of Sense (excluding Tangibles)}, \\\\\n(b) \\text{The Fluid Element.} & (c) \\text{The Three Organic Faculties}. \\\\\n& (d) \\text{The Two Modes of Intimation}, \\\\\n& (e) \\text{The Element of Space}, \\\\\n& (f) \\text{Three Qualities of Form}, \\\\\n& (g) \\text{Three Phases in the Evolution of Form}, \\\\\n& (h) \\text{Impermanence of Form}, \\\\\n& (i) \\text{Bodily nutriment}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo enter with any fulness of discussion into this classification, so rich in interesting suggestions, would occupy itself a volume. In an introduction of mere notes I will offer only a few general considerations.\n\nWe are probably first impressed by the psychological aspect taken of a subject that might seem to lend itself to purely objective consideration. The main constituents of\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf., e.g., S. iii. 59, with Dh. S., \u00a7 584, and Vis. Mag.\nthe material world, classified in the East as we know them to have been classified, contemporaneously, in the West, are set down in terms of subjective or conscious experience. The \u0101po-dh\u0101tu is not called explicitly the Intangible; virtually, however, it and the other three 'Great Phenomena,' or literally 'Great things that have Become,' are regarded from the point of view of how they affect us by way of sense. We might add, how they affect us most fundamentally by way of sense. In the selection of Touch among the senses the Indian tradition joins hands with Demokritus. But of this no more at present.\n\nAgain, in the second table, or secondary forms, the same standpoint is predominant. We have the action and re-action of sense-object and sense, the distinctive expressions of sex and of personality generally, and the phenomena of organic life, as 'sensed' or inferred, comprehended under the most general terms. Two modes of form alone are treated objectively: space and food. And of these, too, the aspect taken has close reference to the conscious personality. \u0100k\u0101so is really ok\u0101so, room, or opportunity, for life and movement. Food, though described as to its varieties in objective terms, is referred to rather in the abstract sense of nutrition and nutriment than as nutritive matter. (Cf. p. 203, n. 3.)\n\n1 Better in Greek \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b3\u03c5\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1, or in German die vier grossen Gewordenen. How the Buddhist logic exactly reconciled the anomaly of \u0101podh\u0101tu as underived and yet as inaccessible to that sense which comes into contact with the underived is not, in the Manual, clearly made out. In hot water, as the Cy. says, there is heat, gas, and solid, and hence we feel it. Yet by the definition there must be in fluid a something underived from these three elements.\n\nThe Buddhist Sensationalism was opposed to the view taken in the Upanishad, where the senses are derived from praj\u00f1\u0101 (rendered by Prof. Deussen 'consciousness'), and again from the World Soul. In the Garbha Up., however, sight is spoken of as fire. The Buddhist view was subsequently again opposed by the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, but not by the Ny\u0101ya.\nOr we may be more especially struck by the curious selection and classification exercised in regard to the items of the catalogue of form.\n\nNow, the compilers of this or of any of the canonical books were not interested in r\u016bpam on psychological grounds as such. Their object was not what we should term scientific. They were not inquiring into forms, either as objective existences, or as mental constructions, with any curiosity respecting the macrocosm, its parts, or its order. They were not concerned with problems of primordial \u1e43\u0101\u1e47a, of first causes, or of organic evolution, in the spirit which has been operative in Western thought from Thales (claimed by Europe) to Darwin. For them, as for the leaders of that other rival movement in our own culture, the tradition of Socrates and Plato, man was, first and last, the subject supremely worth thinking about. And man was worth thinking about as a moral being. The physical universe was the background and accessory, the support and the 'fuel' (up\u0101d\u0101nam), of the evolution of the moral life. It was necessary to man as ethical (at least during his sojourn on the physical plane), but it was only in so far as it affected his ethical life that he could profitably study it. The Buddhist, like the Socratic view, was that of primitive man\u2014'What is the good of it?'\u2014transformed and sublimated by the evolution of the moral ideal. The early questioning: Is such and such good for life-preservation, for race-preservation, for fun? or is it bad? or is it indeterminate? becomes, in evolved ethics: Does it make for my perfection, for others' perfection, for noblest enjoyment? does it make for the contrary? does it make for neither?\n\nAnd the advance in moral evolution which was attempted by Buddhist philosophy, coming as it did in an age of metaphysical dogmatism and withal of scepticism, brought with it the felt need of looking deeper into those data of mental procedure on which dogmatic speculation and ethical convictions were alike founded.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 G. Croom Robertson, 'Philosophical Remains,' p. 8.\nViewed in this light, the category of r\u016bpam or of r\u016bpakkhandho becomes fairly intelligible, both as to the selection and classification of subject matter and as to the standpoint from which it is regarded. As a learner of ethical doctrine, pursuing either the lower or the higher ideal, the Buddhist was concerned with the external world just as far as it directly and inevitably affected his moral welfare and that of other moral beings, that is to say, of all conscious animate beings. To this extent did he receive instruction concerning it.\n\nIn the first place, the great ultimate phenomena of his physical world were one and the same as the basis of his own physical being. That had form; so had this. That was built up of the four elements; so was this. That came into being, persisted, then dissolved; this was his destiny, too, as a temporary collocation or body, 'subject to erasion, abrasion, dissolution and disintegration.'\u00b9 And all that side of life which we call mind or consciousness, similarly conceived as collocations or aggregates, was bound up therein and on that did it depend.\n\nHere, then, was a vital kinship, a common basis of physical being which it behoved the student of man to recognise and take into account, so as to hold an intelligent and consistent attitude towards it. The bhikkhu sekho\u00b2 'who has not attained, who is aspiring after the unsurpassable goal,' has to know, inter alia, earth, water, flame, air, each for what it is, both as external and as part of himself\u00b3\u2014must know 'unity' (ekattam) for what it is; must indulge in no conceits of fancy (m\u0101 ma\u00f1\u00f1i) about it or them, and must so regard them that of him it may one day be said by the masters: Pari\u00f1\u00f1\u0101tam tassa!\u2014'He knows it thoroughly.'\n\nTo this point we shall return. That the elements are considered under the aspect of their tangibility involves\n\n\u00b9 D. i. 76, e.g.\n\u00b2 The brother in orders undergoing training. M. i. 4.\n\u00b3 M. i., pp. 185, et seq.; pp. 421, et seq.\nfor the Buddhist the further inquiry into the sensitive agency by which they affect him as tangibles, and so into the problem of sensation and sense-perception in general. On this subject the Dhamma-sanga\u1e47i yields a positive and valuable contribution to our knowledge of the history of psychology in India in the fourth century B.C. It may contain no matter additional to that which is reproduced in Hardy's 'Manual of Buddhism' (pp. 399-404, 419-423). But Hardy drew directly from relatively modern sources, and though it is interesting to see how far and how faithfully the original tradition has been kept intact in these exegetical works, we turn gladly to the stronger attractions of the first academic formulation of a theory of sense which ancient India has hitherto preserved for us. There is no such analysis of sensation\u2014full, sober, positive, so far as it goes\u2014put forward in any Indian book of an equally early date. The pre-Buddhistic Upanishads (and those, too, of later date) yield only poetic adumbrations, sporadic aphorisms on the work of the senses. The Ny\u0101ya doctrine of pratyak\u1e63a or perception, the Jaina Sutras, the elaboration of the Ved\u0101nta and S\u0101\u1e45khya doctrines are, of course, of far later date. It may not, therefore, be uncalled for if I digress at some length on the Buddhist position in this matter, and look for parallel theories in the West rather than in India itself.\n\nThe theory of action and reaction between the five special senses and their several objects is given in pages 172-190 and 197-200 of my translation. It may be summarized as follows:\n\nA. The Senses.\n\nFirst, a general statement relating each sense in turn (a) to Nature (the four elements), (b) to the individual\n\n---\n\n1 They are called 'special' in modern psychology to distinguish them from organic, general or systemic sense, which works without specially adapted peripheral organs.\norganism, and affirming its invisibility and its power of impact.\n\nSecondly, an analysis of the sensory process, in each case, into\n\n(a) A personal agency or apparatus capable of reacting to an impact not itself;\n\n(b) An impingeing 'form,' or form producing an impact of one specific kind;\n\n(c) Impact between (a) and (b);\n\n(d) Resultant modification of the mental continuum, viz.: in the first place, contact (of a specific sort); then, hedonistic result, or intellectual result, or, presumably, both. The modification is twice stated in each case, emphasis being laid on the mutual impact, first as causing the modification, then as constituting the object of attention in the modified consciousness of the person affected.\n\nB. The Sense-objects.\n\nFirst, a general statement, relating each kind of sense-object in turn to Nature, describing some of the typical varieties, and affirming its invisibility, except in the case of visual objects,\\(^1\\) and its power of producing impact.\\(^2\\)\n\nSecondly, an analysis of the sensory process in each case as under A, but, as it were, from the side of the sense-object, thus:\n\n(a) A mode of form or sense-object, capable of producing impact on a special apparatus of the individual organism;\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This insistence on the invisibility of all the senses, as well as on that of all sense-objects except sights or visual forms, is to me only explicable on the ground that r\u016bpam recurring in each question and each answer, and signifying, whatever else it meant, in popular idiom, things seen, it was necessary, in philosophic usage, to indicate that the term, though referring to sense, did not, with one exception, connote things seen. Thus, even solid and fiery objects were, qua tangibles, not visible. They were not visible to the k\u0101yo, or skin-sensibility. They spelt visible only to the eye.\n\n\\(^2\\) See p. 183, n. 1.\n(b) The impact of that apparatus;\n(c) The reaction or complementary impact of the sense-object;\n(d) Resultant modification of the mental continuum, viz.: in the first place, contact (of a specific sort); then hedonistic result, or intellectual result, or, presumably, both. The modification is twice stated, in each case emphasis being laid on the mutual impact, first as causing the modification, then as constituting the object of attention in the modified consciousness thus affected.\n\nIf we, for purposes of comparison, consult Greek views on sense-perception before Aristotle\u2014say, down to B.C. 350\u2014we shall find nothing to equal this for sobriety, consistency and thoroughness. The surviving fragments of Empedoklean writings on the subject read beside it like airy fancies; nor do the intact utterances of Plato bring us anything more scientific. Very possibly in Demokritus we might have found its match, had we more of him than a few quotations. And there is reason to surmise as much, or even more, in the case of Alkm\u00e6on.\n\nLet me not, however, be understood to be reading into the Buddhist theory more than is actually there. In its sober, analytical prose, it is no less archaic, na\u00efve, and inadequate as explanation than any pre-Aristotelian theory of the Greeks. The comment of Dr. Siebeck on Empedokles applies equally to it:\u00b9 'It sufficed him to have indicated the possibility of the external world penetrating the sense-organs, as though this were tantamount to an explanation of sensation. The whole working out of his theory is an attempt to translate in terms of a detailed and consecutive physiological process the primitive, na\u00efve view of cognition.' Theory of this calibre was, in Greece, divided between impact (Alkm\u00e6on, Empedokles, with respect to sight, Demokritus, Plato, who, to impact, adds a commingling of sense and object) and access (efflux and pore theory of Empedokles) as the essential part of the process. The Buddhist\n\n\u00b9 'Geschichte der Psychologie,' i. 107.\nexplanation confines itself to impact.\\(^1\\) But neither East nor West, with the possible exception of Alkm\u00e6on, had yet gripped the notion of a conducting medium. In Aristotle all is changed. 'Eid\u00f4la' which collide, and 'aporrho\u00eb' which penetrate, have been thrown aside for an examination into 'metaxu.' And we find the point of view similarly shifted in Buddhaghosa's time, though how long before him this advance had been made we do not know. Nor was there, in the earlier thought of East or West, any clear dualistic distinction drawn between mind and matter, between physical (and physiological) motion or stimulus on the one hand, and consequent or concomitant mental modification on the other, in an act of sense-perception. The Greek explanations are what would now be called materialistic. The Buddhist description may be interpreted either way. It is true that in the Milinda-pa\u00f1ho, written some three or four centuries later than our Manual, the action and reaction of sense and sense-object are compared in realistic metaphor to the clash of two cymbals and the butting of two goats.\\(^2\\) But, being metaphorical, this account brings us really no further. The West, while it retained the phraseology characterizing the earlier theory of sense, ceased to imply any direct physical impact or contact when speaking of being 'struck' by sights, sounds, or ideas. How far, and how early, was this also the case in the East?\n\nThe very fact that the Buddhist theory, with all its analytical and symmetrical fulness of exposition, yields so very abstract and schematic a result leaves the way open to surmise that, even in the time of our Manual, the process of sense impression was not materialistically conceived.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Access comes later into prominence with the development of the 'Door-theory.' See following section.\n\n\\(^2\\) 'Milindapa\u00f1ho,' p. 60. S.B.E., vol. xxxv., pp. 92, 93. Cf. below, p. 5, n. 2.\n\n\\(^3\\) Note 2, p. 175, below, suggests the eye, in the case of sight. If so, in what shape did the object get there?\nWe are not told, for instance, where the mutual impact takes place, nor with what a distant object impinges. And if dhamma are conceived, as in the Manual, as actual or potential states of consciousness, and r\u016bpa\u1e41 is conceived as a species of dhamma, it follows that both the r\u016bpa\u1e41, which is 'external' and comes into contact with the r\u016bpa\u1e41 which is 'of the self,' and also this latter r\u016bpa\u1e41 are regarded in the light of the two mental factors necessary to constitute an act of sensory consciousness, actual or potential.\n\nSuch may have been the psychological aspect adumbrated, groped after\u2014not to go further\u2014in the Dhamma-sanga\u1e47i itself. That the traditional interpretation of this impact-theory grew psychological with the progress of culture in the schools of Buddhism seems to be indicated by such a comment in the Atthas\u0101lin\u012b as: 'strikes (impinges) on form is a term for the eye (i.e., the visual sense) being receptive of the object of consciousness.'\u00b9 This seems to be a clear attempt to resolve the old metaphor, or, it may be, the old physical concept, into terms of subjective experience. Again, when alluding to the simile of the cymbals and the rams, we are told by Buddhaghosa to interpret 'eye' by 'visual cognition,' and to take the 'concussion' in the sense of function.\u00b2 Once more, he tells us that when feeling arises through contact, the real causal antecedent is mental, though apparently external.\u00b3\n\nWithout pursuing this problem further, we cannot leave the subject of sense and sensation without a word of comment and comparison on the prominence given in the Buddhist theory to the notion of 'contact' and the sense of touch. As with us, both terms are from the same stem. But phasso (contact), on the one hand, is generalized to include all receptive experience, sensory as well as ide-\n\n\u00b9 Asl. 309. Cakkhum \u0101rammanam sampaticchayam\u0101nam eva r\u016bpamhi patiha\u00f1\u00f1ati n\u0101ma.\n\u00b2 Ibid. 108: 'kiccatthen' eva.\n\u00b3 See below, p. 5, n. 2.\ntional,\\(^1\\) and to represent the essential antecedent and condition of all feeling (or sensation = vedan\u0101). On the other hand, phusati, photthabbam (to touch, the tangible) are specialized to express the activity of one of the senses. Now, the functioning of the tactile sense (termed body-sensibility or simply body, k\u0101yo, pp. 181, 182) is described in precisely the same terms as each of the other four senses. Nevertheless, it is plain, from the significant application of the term tangible, or object of touch, alluded to already\u2014let alone the use of 'contact' in a wider sense\u2014that the Buddhists regarded Touch as giving us knowledge of things 'without' in a more fundamental way than the other senses could. By the table of the contents of r\u016bpam given above, we have seen that it is only through Touch that a knowledge of the underived elements of the world of sense could be obtained, the fluid or moist element alone excepted. This interesting point in the psychology of early Buddhism may possibly be formulated somewhere in the Abhidhamma Pitaka. I should feel more hopeful in this respect had the compilers been, in the first instance, not ethical thinkers, but impelled by the scientific curiosity of a Demokritus. The latter, as is well known, regarded all sensation as either bare touch or developments of touch\u2014a view borne out to a great extent by modern biological research. This was, perhaps a corollary of his atomistic philosophy. Yet that Demokritus was no mere deductive system-spinner, but an inductive observer, is shown in the surviving quotation of his dictum, that we should proceed, in our inferences, 'from phenomena to that which is not manifest.' Now, as the Buddhist view of r\u016bpam calls three of the four elements 'underived' and 'the tangible,' while it calls the senses and all other sense-objects 'derived from that tangible' and from fluid, one might almost claim that their position with respect to Touch was in effect parallel to that of Demokritus. The Commentary does not assist us to any\n\n\\(^1\\) See below, p. 4, n. 2.\nclear conclusion on this matter. But, in addition to the remark quoted above, in which visual magnitudes are pronounced to be really tactile sensations, it has one interesting illustration of our proverb, 'Seeing is believing, but Touch is the real thing.' It likens the four senses, excluding touch, to four balls of cotton-wool, intervening between hammer and four anvils (i.e., U p\u0101d\u0101r\u016bpam, or derived form, without and within) and deadening the impact. But in Touch, hammer smites through wool, getting at the bare anvil.\\(^1\\)\n\nFurther considerations on the Buddhist theory of sense, taking us beyond bare sensation to the working up of such material into concrete acts of perception, I propose to consider briefly in the following section. The remaining heads of the r\u016bpa-skandha are very concisely treated in the niddesa answers (pp. 190-197), and, save in the significance of their selection, call for no special treatment.\n\nIt is not quite clear why senses and sense-objects should be followed by three indriyas\u2014by three only and just these three. The senses themselves are often termed indriyas, and not only in Buddhism. In the indriyas of sex, however, and the phenomena of nutrition, the r\u016bpa-skandha, in both the self and other selves, is certainly catalogued under two aspects as general and as impressive as that of sense. In fact, the whole organism as modifiable by the 'sabbam r\u016bpam' without, may be said to be summed up under these three aspects. They fit fairly well into our division of the receptive side of the organism, considered, psychophysically, as general and special sensibility. From his ethical standpoint the learner did well to take the life in which he shared into account under its impressive aspects of sense, sex and nutrition. And this not only in so far as he was receptive. The very term indriyam, which is best paralleled by the Greek \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2, or faculty\u2014i.e., 'powers in us, and in all other\n\n\\(^1\\) Asl. 263; below, p. 127, n. 1.\nthings, by which we do as we do'\u2014and which is interpreted to this effect by Buddhaghosa, points to the active, self-expressive side of existence. Both as recipient, then, and as agent, the learner of the Dharma had to acquire and maintain a certain attitude with respect to these aspects of the r\u016bpa-skandha.\n\nThe same considerations apply to the next two kinds of r\u016bpa\u1e41, with which we may bracket the next after them. The two modes of 'intimation' or self-expression exhaust the active side of life as such, constituting, as one might say, a world of sub-derivative or tertiary form, and calling quite especially for modification by theory and practice (dassanena ca bh\u0101van\u0101ya ca). And the element of space, strange as it looks, at first sight, to find it listed just here, was of account for the Buddhist only as a necessary datum or postulate for his sentient and active life. The vacua of the body, as well as its plena, had to be reckoned in with the r\u016bpa-skandha; likewise the space without by which bodies were delimitated, and which, yielding room for movement, afforded us the three dimensions.\n\nThe grounds for excluding space from the four elements and for calling it derived remain in obscurity. In the Mah\u0101 R\u0101hulov\u0101da-Sutta (cited below) it is ranked immediately after, and apparently as co-ordinate with, the other four. And it was so ranked, oftener than not, by Indian thought generally. Yet in another Sutta of the same Nik\u0101ya\u2014the Mah\u0101 Hatthipadopama-Sutta\u2014S\u0101riputta\n\n---\n\n1 Republic, v. 477.  \n2 Asl., p. 119 and passim.  \n3 See below, p. 194, n. 1; also M. i. 423. In the former passage space is described as if external to the organism; in the latter Gotama admonishes his son respecting the internal \u0101k\u0101so.\n\nOn the interesting point put forward by Professor von Schroeder of a connexion between \u0101k\u0101sa and the Pythagorean \u1f40\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2, see Professor Garbe in the Vienna Oriental Journal, xiii., Nro. 4 (1899). The former scholar refers to the ranking of space as a fifth element, as a schwankend \u00fcberlieferte Bezeichnung. It was so for Buddhism.\ndescribes four elements, leaving out \u0101k\u0101so. Eliminated for some reason from the Underived, when the Dhammasangani was compiled, it was logically necessary to include it under Derived R\u016bpam. That it was so included because it was held to be a mental construction, or a 'pure form of intuition,' is scarcely tenable.\n\nAnd yet the next seven items of derived form are apparently to be accepted rather as concepts or aspects of form than as objective properties or 'primary qualities' of it. Be that as it may, all the seven are so many common facts about r\u016bpam, both as 'sabbam' and as skandha. The Three Qualities\\(^1\\) indicated the ideal efficiency for moral ends to which the r\u016bpa-skandha, or any form serving such an end, should be brought. The Three Phases in the organic evolution of form and the great fact of Impermanence applied everywhere and always to all form. And as such all had to be borne in mind, all had to co-operate in shaping theory and practice.\n\nConcerning, lastly, the \u0101h\u0101ro, or support, of the r\u016bpa-skandha, the hygiene and ethics of diet are held worthy of rational discussion in the Sutta Pi\u1e6daka.\\(^2\\)\n\nWe have now gone with more or less details into the divisions of r\u016bpam in the 'sensuous universe,' with a view of seeing how far it coincided with any general philosophical concept in use among ourselves. For me it does not fit well with any, and the vague term 'form,' implicated as it is, like r\u016bpam, with 'things we see,' is perhaps the most serviceable. Its inclusion of faculties and abstract notions as integral factors prevent its coinciding with 'matter,' or 'the Extended,' or 'the External World.' If we turn to the list of attributes given in Chapter I. of Book II., r\u016bpam appears as pre-eminently the unmoral (as to both cause and effect) and the non-mental. It was 'favourable' to immoral states, as the chief constituent of a world that had to be mastered\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lightness, plasticity, wieldiness, pp. 194, 195.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf., e.g., M. i., Suttas 54, 55, 65, 66, 70.\nand transcended by moral culture, but the immoral states exploiting it were of the other four skandhas. It included the phenomena of sense, but rather on their physical pre-mental side than as full-fledged facts of consciousness. And it was sharply distinguished, as a constituent \u2018collocation\u2019 or \u2018aggregate\u2019 (skandha, r\u0101si), in the total aggregate of the individual organism from the three collocations called cetasik\u0101 (feelings, perceptions, syntheses), and from that called citta (intellect, thought, cognition). The attabh\u0101vo, or personality, minus all mental and moral characteristics, is r\u016bpam.\n\nAs such it is one with all r\u016bpam not of its own composition. It is \u2018in touch\u2019 with the general impersonal r\u016bpam, as well as with the mental and moral constituents of other personalities by way of their r\u016bpam. That this intercommunication was held to be possible on the basis, and in virtue of, this common structure was probably as implicit in the Buddhist doctrine as it was explicit in many of the early Greek philosophers. It is not impossible that some open allusions to \u2018like being known by like\u2019 may be discovered in the Pitakas as a consciously held and deliberately stated principle or ground of the impressibility of the sentient organism. No such statement occurs in our Manual. But the phrase, recurring in the case of each of the special senses, \u2018derived from the four Great Phenomena,\u2019 may not have been inserted without this implication. Without further evidence, however, I should not be inclined to attach philosophical significance in this direction to it. But on the one hand we have an interesting hint in the Commentary that such a principle was held by early Buddhists. \u2018Where there is difference of kind (or creature), we read,\u00b9 there is no sensory stimulus. According to the Ancients, \u201cSensory stimulus is of similar kinds, not of different kinds.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u00b9 Asl. 313. Bh\u016bta visese hi sati pas\u0101do va na uppajjati. \u2018Sam\u0101n\u0101nam bh\u016btanam hi pas\u0101do, na visam\u0101n\u0101nan ti\u2019 Por\u0101\u1e47\u0101.\nAnd again: 'The solid, both within and without, becomes the condition of the sense of touch in the laying hold of the object of perception\u2014in discerning the tangible.' It is true that Buddhaghosa is discoursing, not on this question, but on what would now be called the specific energy, or specialized functioning, of nerve. Nevertheless, it seems inferable from the quotations that the principle was established. And we know also how widely accepted (and also contested) this same principle\u2014'\u0397 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u1ff3\u2014was in Greece, from Empedokles to Plato and to Plotinus, thinkers, all of them, who were affected, through Pythagorism or otherwise, by the East. The vivid description by Buddhaghosa (cf. below, pp. 173-174) of the presence in the seat of vision of the four elements is very suggestive of Plato's account of sight in the 'Tim\u00e6us,' where the principle is admitted.\n\nWhether as a principle, or merely as an empirical fact, the oneness of man's r\u016bpaskandha with the sabbam r\u016bpa\u1e43 without was thoroughly admitted, and carefully taught as orthodox doctrine. And with regard to this kinship, I repeat, a certain philosophical attitude, both theoretical and practical, was inculcated as generally binding. That attitude is, in one of the Majjhima discourses, led up to and defined as follows: All good states (dhamma) whatever are included in the Four Noble Truths concerning Ill. Now the First Noble Truth unfolds the nature of Ill: that it lies in using the five skandhas for Grasping. And the\n\n---\n\n1 Ibid., 315.

I have retained the meaning of 'Grasping' as dictated by Buddhaghosa for the group of the Four Kinds of Grasping. Dr. Neumann renders up\u0101d\u0101nak-\nfirst of the five is that of r\u016bpa\u1e41. Now r\u016bpa\u1e41 comprises the four Great Phenomena and all their derivatives. And the first of the four is Earth (the solid element). Then the solid within, or 'belonging to the self,' is catalogued, with the injunction that it is to be regarded as it really is with right wisdom (yath\u0101bh\u016btam sammapa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya datthabbam). And this means that\u2014while recognizing his kinship with the element to the full\u2014the good student should not identify himself with it so as to see in it a permanent unchanging substance as which he should persist amid transient phenomena. He was to reflect, 'This is not mine, it is not I, it is not the soul of me!' 'It is void of a Self.'\u00b9 And so for the other three elements. In their mightiest manifestations\u2014in the earthquake as in the flood, in conflagration as in tempest\u2014they are but temporal, phenomenal; subject to change and decay. Much more is this true of them when collocated in the human organism. So far from losing himself in his meditation in the All, in Nature, in 'cosmic emotion' of any kind, he had to realize that the r\u016bpa\u1e41 in which he participated was but one of the five factors of that life which, in so far as it engulfed and mastered him and bore him drifting along, was the great Ill, the source of pain and delusion. From each of those five factors he had to detach himself in thought, and attain that position of mastery and emancipation whereby alone the true, the Ideal Self could emerge\u2014temporary as a phenomenal\n\n\u00b9 See above, p. xxxvi, where the context leaves no doubt as to what the reflection is meant to emphasize.\n\nkhandho by element of the impulse to live (Lebenstrieb; an expression doubtlessly prompted by Schopenhauer's philosophy). It would be very desirable to learn from the Papa\u00f1ca-S\u016bdani (Buddhaghosa's 'Commentary on the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya), whether the Commentator interprets the term to the same effect in both passages. Dhammadinn\u0101, the woman-apostle, explains up\u0101d\u0101nam, used with a similar context, as meaning 'passionate desire in the five skandhas-of-grasping.' (M. i. 300.)\ncollocation, eternal by its ethical aspiration. And the practical result of cultivating 'this earth-like culture' and the rest, as Gotama called it in teaching his son, was that 'the mind was no longer entranced by the consideration of things as affecting him pleasantly or disagreeably,' but 'the disinterestedness which is based on that which is good was established.' 'And he thereat is glad'\u2014and rightly so\u2014'for thus far he has wrought a great work!'\n\nThese seem to me some of the more essential features in the Buddhist Dharma concerning R\u016bpa\u1e41.\n\nVII.\n\nOn the Buddhist Philosophy of Mind and Theory of Intellection.\n\nIt would have been the greatest possible gain to our knowledge of the extent to which Buddhism had developed any clear psychological data for its ethics, had it occurred to the compilers of the Dhamma-Sangani to introduce an analysis of the other four skandhas parallel to that of the skandha of form. It is true that the whole work, except the book on r\u016bpa\u1e41, is an inquiry into ar\u016bpino dhamma, conceived for the most part as mental phenomena, but there is no separate treatment of them divided up as such. Some glimpses we obtain incidentally, most of which have been pointed out in the footnotes to the translation. And it may prove useful to summarize briefly such contribution as may lie therein to the psychology of Buddhism.\n\nAnd, first, it is very difficult to say to what extent, if at all, such psychological matter as we find is distinctively and originally Buddhist, or how much was merely adopted from contemporary culture and incorporated with the Dharma. Into this problem I do not here propose to inquire farther. If there be any originality, any new departure in the psychology scattered about the Nik\u0101yas, it is more likely to be in aspect and treatment than in new\n\n1 M. i. 423, 424. 2 M. i. 186.\nmatter. Buddhism preached a doctrine of regenerate personality, to be sought after and developed by and out of the personal resources of the individual through a system of intellectual self-culture. Thrown back upon himself, he developed introspection, the study of consciousness. But, again, his doctrine imposed on him the study of psychical states without the psyche. Nature without and nature within met, acted and reacted, and the result told on the organism in a natural, orderly, necessary way.\\(^1\\) But there was no one adjusting the machinery.\\(^2\\) The Buddhist might have approved of Leibniz's amendment of Locke's 'Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu' in the additional phrase 'nisi ipse intellectus.' But he would not thereby have exalted vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41, citta\u1e41, or mano to any hypostatic permanence as prior or as immanent. He would only admit the priority of intellect to particular sensations as a natural order, obtaining among the phenomenal factors of any given act of cognition.\n\nPsychological earnestness, then, and psychological inquiry into mental phenomena, coexisting apart from, and in opposition to, the usual assumption of a psychical entity: such are the only distinctively Buddhist features which may, in the absence of more positive evidence than we yet possess, be claimed in such analysis of mind as appears in Buddhist ethics.\n\nOf the results of this earnest spirit of inquiry into mental phenomena, in so far as they may be detached from ethical doctrine, and assigned their due place in the history of human ideas, it will be impossible, for several years, to prepare any adequate treatment. Much of the Abhidhamma Pi\u1e6daka, and even some of the Sutta Pi\u1e6daka, still remains unedited.\n\nOf the former collection nothing has been translated with the exception of the attempt in this volume. And, since Buddhist psychology has an evolution to show covering nearly a thousand years, we have to await fresh materials\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Mil. 57-61.  \n\\(^2\\) Sum. 194.\nfrom the yet unedited works of Buddhaghosa, the Buddhist Sanskrit texts, and such works as the Netti-pakarana, Professor Hardy's edition of which is now in the press. Meanwhile there is an increasing store of accessible material which might be sifted by the historical investigator.\n\nThere are, for instance, in the Dhamma-Sangani several passages suggesting that Buddhist scholars, in contemplating the consciousness or personality as affected by phenomena considered as external, were keenly alive to the distinction between the happening of the expected and the happening of the unexpected, between instinctive reaction of the mind and the organism generally, on occasion of sense, and the deliberate confronting of external phenomena with a carefully adjusted intelligence. Modern psychology has largely occupied itself with this distinction, and with the problems of consciousness and subconsciousness, of volition and of memory, involved in it. The subject of attention, involuntary and voluntary, figures prominently in the psychological literature of the last two decades. But it is not till the centuries of post-Aristotelian and of neo-Platonic thought that we see the distinction emerging in Western psychology contemporaneously with the development of the notion of consciousness.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn the history of Buddhist thought, too, the distinction does not appear to have become explicitly and consciously made till the age of, or previous to, the writing of the great Commentaries (fifth century). A corresponding explicitness in the notion of consciousness and self-consciousness, or at least in the use of some equivalent terms, has yet to be traced.\\(^2\\) Buddhism is so emphatically a philosophy, both in theory and practice, of the conscious will, with all that this involves of attention and concentration, that we hardly\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

See in Grimblot's 'Sept Suttas,' p. 255.\nlook to find terms discriminating such notions from among other mental characteristics. We are reminded instead of Matthew Arnold's well-known remark that as, at Soli, no one spoke of solecisms, so in England we had to import the term Philistine.\n\nBut, whereas it is the Atthas\u0101lin\u012b, written from the standpoint of a later elaboration of thought, that makes explicit what it holds to be the intention of the classic manual, the latter work lends itself without straining to such interpretation. I pass over Buddhaghosa's comments on the limitations and the movements of attention reproduced below, pp. 198, n. 2, 200, n. 1, as derived very possibly from thought nearer to his own times. Again, with respect to the residual unspecified factors in good and bad thoughts\u2014the 'or-whatever-other-states'\u2014among which the Commentator names, as a constant, manasik\u0101ra, or attention\u2014this specifying may be considered as later elaboration. But when the Commentary refers the curious alternative emphasis in the description of the sensory act to just this distinction between a percipient who is prepared or unprepared for the stimulus, it seems possible that he is indeed giving us the original interpretation.\n\n---\n\n1 See below p. 5, n. 1; also Asl., pp. 168, 250, etc. The definition given of manasik\u0101ra in the 'ye-v\u0101-panaka' passage of the Commentary (p. 133) is difficult to grasp fully, partly because, here and there, the reading seems doubtful in accuracy, partly because of the terms of the later Buddhist psychology employed, which it would first be necessary to discuss. But I gather that manasik\u0101ra may be set going in the first, middle, or last stage of an act of cognition\u2014i.e., on the \u0101ramma\u1e47am or initial presentation, the vithi (or \u0101vajjana\u1e41), and the javanam; that in this connexion it is concerned with the first of the three; that it involves memory, association of the presentation with [mental] 'associates,' and confronting the presentation. And that it is a constructive and directing activity of mind, being compared to a charioteer.\n\n2 Below, p. 176, nn. 1, 2.\nAgain, the remarkable distinction drawn, in the case of every type of good or of bad thoughts, 'relating to the sensuous universe,' i.e., to the average moral consciousness, between thoughts which are prompted by a conscious motive,\\(^1\\) and such as are not, seems to me to indicate a groping after the distinction between instinctive or spontaneous intellect, on the one hand, and deliberate, purposive, or motivated thought on the other.\n\nTaken in isolation, there is insufficient material here to establish this alternative state of mind as a dominant feature in Buddhist psychology. Taken in conjunction with the general mental attitude and intellectual culture involved in Buddhist ethical doctrine and continually inculcated in the canonical books, and emphasized as it is by later writings, the position gains in significance. The doctrine of karma, inherited and adopted from earlier and contemporary thought, never made the Buddhist fatalistic. He recognised the tremendous vis a tergo expressed in our doggerel:\n\n'For 'tis their nature to.'\n\nBut he had unlimited faith in the saving power of nurture. He faced the grim realities of life with candour, and tolerated no mask. This honesty, to which we usually add a mistaken view of the course of thought and action he prescribed in consequence of the honesty, gains him the name of Pessimist. But the hope that was in him of what might be done to better nature through nurture, even in this present life, by human effort and goodwill, reveals him as a strong Optimist with an unshaken ideal of the joy springing from things made perfect. He even tried to 'pitchfork nature' in one or two respects, though opposed to asceticism generally\u2014simply to make the Joy\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. below, p. 34, n. 1. The thoughts which are not called sasankh\u0101rena are by the Cy. ruled as being a-sankh\u0101rena, though not explicitly said to be so (Asl. 71).\nmore easily attainable by those who dared to 'come out.' And this regenerating nurture resolves itself, theoretically, into a power of discrimination; practically, into an exercise of selection. The individual learner, pervious by way of his 'fivefold door' to an inflooding tide of impressions penetrating to the sixth door of the co-ordinating 'mind,' was to regulate the natural alertness of reception and perception by the special kind of attention termed yoni so manasi k\u0101ra, or thorough attention, and by the clear-eyed insight referred to already as yath\u0101 bh\u016btam sammappa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya datthabbam, or the higher wisdom of regarding 'things as in themselves they really are'\u2014to adopt Matthew Arnold's term. The stream of phenomena, whether of social life, of nature, or of his own social and organic growth, was not so much to be ignored by him as to be marked, measured and classed according to the criteria of one who has chosen 'to follow his own uttermost,' and has recognised the power of that stream to imperil his enterprise, and its lack of power to give an equivalent satisfaction. The often-recurring subject of sati-sampaj\u0101\u00f1\u00f1am, or that 'mindful and aware' attitude, which evokes satire in robust, if superficial, criticism, is the expansion and ethical application of this psychological state of prepared and pre-adjusted sense or voluntary attention. The student was not to be taken by surprise\u2014'evil states of covetousness and repining flowing in over him dwelling unprepared'\u2014until he had\n\n'. . .

Alertness is never long, and, indeed, never strictly, attending to anything and everything at once. We are reminded of Condillac's definition of attention as only an 'exclusive sensation.' From the multitude of excitations flowing in upon us, one is, more or less frequently, selected,\\(^1\\) the rest being, for a time, either wholly excluded or perceived subconsciously. And this selective instinct, varying in strength, appears, not only in connexion with sense-impressions, but also in our more persisting tendencies and interests, as well as in a general disposition to concentration or to distraction.\n\nBuddhism, in its earnest and hopeful system of self-culture, set itself strenuously against a distrait habit of mind, calling it *tatratatr\u0101bhinandini*\\(^2\\)\u2014'the there-and-there-dalliance,' as it were of the butterfly. And it adopted and adapted that discipline in concentration (*sama\u1e0dhi*), both physical and psychical, both perceptual and conceptual, for which India is unsurpassed. But it appreciated the special practice of rapt absorbed concentrated thought called Dhy\u0101na or Jh\u0101na, not as an end in itself, but as a symbol and vehicle of that habit of selection and single-minded effort which governed 'life according to the Higher Ideal.' It did not hold with the robust creed, which gropes, it may be, after a yet stronger ideal:\n\n'Greift nur hinein ins volle Menschenleben,\nUnd wo Ihr's packt, da ist es interessant?'\n\n'Full life' of the actual sort, viewed from the Buddhist standpoint, was too much compact of Vanity Fair, shambles\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

It had, on the other hand, great faith in experimenting on nature by a judicious pruning of everything it judged might wreck or hinder the evolution of a life of finer, higher quality. If we, admitting this intention, look on the frequent injunctions respecting what 'was to be put away' (pah\u0101tabb\u0101m)\\(^1\\) from the life of each disciple, whether by insight or by culture, whether by gentle or by forcible restraint,\\(^2\\) not as so much mere self-mortification and crippling of energy, but as expressions of selective culture for the better 'forcing' of somewhat tender growths, we may, if we still would criticise, appraise more sympathetically.\n\nIf I have dwelt at some length on a side of Buddhist psychological ethics which is not thrown into obvious relief in our Manual, it was because I wished to connect that side with the specially characteristic feature in Buddhist psychology where it approximates to the trend of our own modern tradition. There, on the one hand, we have a philosophy manifestly looking deeper into the mental constitution than any other in the East, and giving especial heed to just those mental activities\u2014attention and feeling, conation and choice\u2014which seem most to imply a subject, or subjective unity who attends, feels, wills and chooses. And yet this same philosophy is emphatically one that attempts to 'extrude the Ego.' If, on the other hand, we leap over upwards of 2,000 years and consider one of the most notable contributions to our national psychology, we find that its two most salient features are a revival of the admission of an Ego or Subject of mental states, which had been practically extruded, and a theory of the ultimate nature of mental procedure set out entirely in terms of attention and feeling.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See, e.g., below, p. 256 et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. the Sabbasava Sutta and passim, M. i., especially the Vitakkasanthana Sutta.\n\n\\(^3\\) I refer to Professor Ward's 'Psychology,' Ency. Brit., 9th ed.\nAnd yet the divergence between the two conclusions, widely removed though they are by time and space, is not so sharp as at first appears. The modern thinker, while he finds it more honest not to suppress the fact that all psychologists, not excepting Hume, do, implicitly or explicitly, assume the conception of 'a mind' or conscious subject, is careful to 'extrude' metaphysical dogma. That everything mental is referred to a Self or Subject is, for him, a psychological conception which may be kept as free from the metaphysical conception of a soul, mind-atom, or mind-stuff as is that of the individual organism in biology. In much the same way the Buddhists were content to adopt the term attabh\u0101vo (self-hood or personality\u2014for which Buddhaghosa half apologizes\u00b9)\u2014ajjhattikam (belonging to the self, subjective\u00b2) and the like, as well as to speak of cittam, mano and vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam where we might say 'mind.' It is true that by the two former terms they meant the totality of the five skandhas, that is to say, both mind and body, but this is not the case with the three last named. And if there was one thing which moved the Master to quit his wonted serenity and wield the lash of scorn and upbraiding, and his followers to use emphatic repudiation, it was just the reading into this convenient generalization of mind or personality that 'metaphysical conception of a soul, mind-atom, or mind-stuff,' which is put aside by the modern psychologist.\n\nAnd I believe that the jealous way in which the Buddhists guarded their doctrine in this matter arose, not from the wish to assimilate mind to matter, or the whole personality to a machine, but from the too great danger that lay in the unchecked use of att\u0101,\u00b3 ahank\u0101ra, attabh\u0101vo, even as a mere psychological datum, in that it afforded a foothold to the prevailing animism. They\n\n\u00b9 See below, p. 175, n. 1. \u00b2 Ibid., p. 207, n. 1.\n\u00b3 Svayam (this one) is nearly always substituted for att\u0101 as a nominative, the latter term usually appearing in oblique cases.\nwere as Protestants in regard to the crucifix. They remembered with Ste. Beuve: 'La sauvagerie est toujours l\u00e0 \u00e0 deux pas, et, d\u00e8s qu'on l\u00e2che pied, elle recommence.'\n\nWhat, then, was their view of mind, as merely phenomenal, in relation to the r\u016bpa-skandha or non-mental part of the human individual? We have considered their doctrine of external phenomena impingeing on and modifying the internal or personal r\u016bpam by way of sense. Have we any clue to their theory of the propagation of the modifications, alleged in their statement\\(^1\\) to take place in relation to those factors of personality which were ar\u016bpino, and not derived from material elements\u2014the elements (dh\u0101tu's), namely, or skandhas of feeling, perception, syntheses and intellect? How did they regard that process of co-ordination by which, taking sensuous experience as the more obvious starting-point in mental experience, sensations are classed and made to cohere into groups or percepts, and are revived as memories, and are further co-ordinated into concepts or abstract ideas? And finally, and at back of all this, who feels, or attends, or wills?\n\nNow the Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i does not place questions of this kind in the mouth of the catechist. In so far as it is psychological (not psycho-physical or ethical), it is so strictly phenomenological, that its treatment is restricted to the analysis of certain broadly defined states of mind, felt or inferred to have arisen in consequence of certain other mental states as conditions. There is no reference anywhere to a 'subjective factor' or agent who has the cittam or thought, with all its associated factors of attention, feeling, conception and volition. Even in the case of Jh\u0101na, where it is dealing with more active modes of regulated attention, involving a maximum of constructive thought with a minimum of receptive sense, the agent, as conscious subject, is kept in the background. The inflexion of the verb\\(^2\\) alone implies a given personal agent, and the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See answers in \u00a7\u00a7 600, 604, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bh\u0101veti, viharati (cultivates, abides); p. 43 et seq.\nCommentary even feels it incumbent to point him out. It is this psychologizing without a psyche that impressed me from the first, and seemed to bring the work, for all its remoteness in other respects, nearer to our own Experiential school of and since Locke, than anything we find in Greek traditions.\n\nIt is true that each of the four formless skandhas is defined or described, and this is done in connexion with the very first question of the book. But the answers are given, not in terms of respective function or of mutual relation, but of either synonyms, or of modes or constituent parts. For instance, feeling (vedan\u0101) is resolved into three modes,\\(^1\\) perception (sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) is taken as practically self-evident and not really described at all,\\(^2\\) the syntheses (sankh\u0101ra) are resolved into modes or factors, intellect (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam) is described by synonyms.\n\nAgain, whereas the skandhas are enumerated in the order in which, I believe, they are unvaryingly met with, there is nothing, in text or Commentary, from which we can infer that this order corresponds to any theory of genetic procedure in an act of cognition. In other words, we are not shown that feeling calls up perception, or that the sankh\u0101ras are a necessary link in the evolution of perception into conception or reasoning.\\(^3\\) If we can infer\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See pp. 3-9, 27-29.\n\n\\(^2\\) It is on the other hand described with some fulness in the Cy. See my note s.v.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. the argument by Dr. Neumann, 'Buddhistische Anthologie,' xxiii, xxiv. If I have rendered sankh\u0101ra by 'syntheses,' it is not because I see any coincidence between the Buddhist notion and the Kantian Synthesis der Wahrnehmungen. Still less am I persuaded that Unterscheidungen is a virtually equivalent term. Like the 'confections' of Professor Rhys Davids and the 'Gestaltungen' of Professor Oldenberg, I use syntheses simply as, more or less, an etymological equivalent, and wait for more light. I may here add that I have used intellection and cognition interchangeably as comprehending the whole process of knowing, or coming to know.\nanything in the nature of causal succession at all, it is such that the order of the skandhas as enumerated is upset. Thus, taking the first answer (and that is typical for the whole of Book I. when new ground is broken into): a certain sense-impression evokes, through 'contact,' a complex state of mind or psychosis called a thought or cittam. Born of this contact and the 'appropriate' cittam, now (i.e., in answer 3) called, in terms of its synonym, representative intellection (manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-dh\u0101tu), feeling, we are told, is engendered. Perception is called up likewise and, apparently, simultaneously. So is 'thinking' (cetan\u0101)\u2014of the sankh\u0101ra-skandha. And 'associated with' the cittam come all the rest of the constituent dhammas, both sankh\u0101ras, as well as specific modes\\(^1\\) or different aspects\\(^2\\) of the feeling and the thought already specified. In a word, we get contact evoking the fifth skandha, and, as the common co-ordinate resultant, the genesis or excitement of the other three. This is entirely in keeping with the many passages in the Nik\u0101yas, where the concussion of sense and object are said to result in vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47am = cittam = the fifth skandha. 'Eye,' for instance, and 'form,' in mutual 'contact,' result in 'visual cognition.'\n\nIn the causal chain of that ancient formula, the Paticca-samupp\u0101da,\\(^3\\) on the other hand, we find quite another order of genesis, sankh\u0101ras inducing cognition or thought, and contact alone inducing feeling. This mysterious old rune must not further complicate our problem. I merely allude to it as not in the least supporting the view that the order of statement, in the skandhas, implies order of happening. What we may more surely gather from the canon is that, as our own psychological thought has now conceived it,\\(^4\\) the, let us say, given\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) E.g., ease.\n\n\\(^2\\) E.g., the 'faculties' of mind (ideation) and of pleasure.\n\n\\(^3\\) Given below on p. 348 [1336].\n\n\\(^4\\) Professor Ward, op. cit.\nindividual 'attends to or cognizes (vij\u0101n\u0101ti) changes in the sensory continuum, and is, in consequence, either pleased or pained' (or has neutral feeling). And, further, in any and every degree of conscious or subconscious mood or disposition, he may be shown to be experiencing a number of 'associated states,' as enumerated. All this is in our Manual called a cittupp\u0101d\u0101\u2014a genesis of thought.\n\nOf thought or of thinking. There seems to be a breadth and looseness of implication about cittam fairly parallel to the popular vagueness of the English term. It is true that the Commentary does not sanction the interpretation of contact and all the rest (I refer to the type given in the first answer) as so many attributes of the thought which 'has arisen.' The sun rising, it says, is not different from its fiery glory, etc., arising. But the cittam arising is a mere expression to fix the occasion for the induction of the whole concrete psychosis, and connotes no more and no less than it does as a particular constituent of that complex.\\(^1\\)\n\nThis is a useful hint. On the other hand, when we consider the synonymous terms for cittam, given in answer 6, and compare the various characteristics of these terms scattered through the Commentary, we find a considerable wealth of content and an inclusion of process and product similar to that of our 'thought.' For example, 'cittam means mental object or presentation (\u0101ramma\u1e47am); that is to say, he thinks; that is to say, he attends to a thought.'\\(^2\\) Hence my translation might well\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Asl. 113. I gather, however, that the adjective cetasikam had a wider and a narrower denotation. In the former it meant 'not bodily,' as on p. 6. In the latter it served to distinguish three of the incorporeal skandhas from the fourth, i.e., cittam, as on pp. 265, 318\u2014cittacetasik\u0101 dhamm\u0101. Or are we to take the Commentator's use of k\u0101yikam here to refer to those three skandhas, as is often the case (p. 43, n. 3)? Hardly, since this makes the two meanings of cetasikam self-contradictory.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. 63.\nhave run: When a good thought . . . has arisen . . . as the object of this or that sense, etc. Again, cittam is defined as a process of connecting (sandh\u0101nam) the last (things) as they keep arising in consciousness with that which preceded them.\\(^1\\) Further, it is a co-ordinating, relating, or synthesizing (sandahana\u1e41);\\(^2\\) and, again, it has the property of initiative action (pure c\u0101rikam). For, when the sense-impression gets to the 'door' of the senses, cittam confronts it before the rest of the mental congeries.\\(^3\\) The sensations are, by cittam, wrought up into that concrete stream of consciousness which they evoke.\n\nHere we have cittam covering both thinking and thought or idea. When we turn to its synonym or quasi-synonym mano we find, so far as I can discover, that only activity, or else spring, source or nidus of activity, is the aspect taken. The faculty of ideation (manindriyam), for instance,\\(^4\\) while expressly declared to be an equivalent (vevacanam) of cittam, and, like it, to be that which attends or cognizes (vij\u0101n\u0101ti), is also called a measuring the mental object\u2014declared above to be cittam.\\(^5\\) In a later passage (ibid., 129), it is assigned the function of accepting, receiving, analogous, perhaps, to our technical expression 'assimilating' (sampaticchana\u1e41). In thus appraising or approving, it has all sensory objects for its field, as well as its more especial province of dhammas.\\(^6\\) These, when thus distinguished, I take to mean ideas, including images and general notions. And it is probably\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Asl., pp. 112, 113.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. the characteristic\u2014samvidahanam\u2014of cetan\u0101 in my note, p. 8.\n\n\\(^3\\) The figure of the city-guardian, given in Mil. 62, is quoted by the Cy.\n\n\\(^4\\) See below, p. 18, and Asl. 123.\n\n\\(^5\\) It is at the same time said to result in (establishing) fact or conformity (tath\u0101bh\u0101vo), and to succeed sense-perception as such.\n\n\\(^6\\) See p. 2, n. 3.\nonly in order to distinguish between mind in this abstract functioning and mind as cognition in its most comprehensive sense that we see the two terms held apart in the sentence: 'Cittam cognizes the dhammas which are the objects of mano, just as it cognizes the visual forms, etc., which are the objects of the senses.'\n\nWhen cittam is thus occupied with the abstract functioning of mano\u2014when, that is, we are reflecting on past experience, in memory or ratiocination\u2014then the more specific term is, I gather, not cittam, but manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam (corresponding to cakkhuvini\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam, etc.). This, in the Commentarial psychology, certainly stands for a further stage, a higher 'power' of intellect, for 'representative cognition,' its specific activity being distinguished as judging or deciding (santir\u0101nam), and as fixing or determining (votthappanam).\n\nThe affix dh\u0101tu, whether appended to mano or to manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam, probably stands for a slight distinction in aspect of the intellectual process. It may be intended to indicate either of these two stages as an irreducible element, a psychological ultimate, an activity regarded as its own spring or source or basis. Adopted from without by Buddhism, it seems to have been jealously guarded from noumenal implications by the orthodox. Buddhaghosa, indeed, seems to substitute the warning against its abuse for the reason why it had come to be used. According to him, the various lists of dhammas (e.g., in the first answer), when considered under the aspect of phenomena, of 'emptiness,' of non-essence, may be grouped as together forming two classes of dh\u0101tu. Moreover, each special sense can be so considered (cakkhu-dh\u0101tu, etc.; see pp. 214, 215),\n\n---\n\n1 Asl., p. 112.\n2 Cf. the expression suddha-manodv\u0101ro in my note, p. 3. And on what follows, cf. pp. 129, 132, nn.\n3 Viz., manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-dh\u0101tu and dhamma-dh\u0101tu see Asl. 153, and below, p. 26, n. 2. The term 'element' is similarly used in our own psychology.\nand so may each kind of sense-object. For, with respect to sense, or the apprehension of form, they are so many phenomenal ultimates\u2014the two terms, so to speak, in each sensory relation.\n\nHow far dh\u0101tu corresponds to vatthu\u2014how far the one is a psychological, the other a physical conception\\(^1\\) of source or base\u2014is not easily determined. But it is interesting to note that the Commentator only alludes to a basis of thought (cittassa vatthu), that is, to the heart (hadaya-vatthu), when the catechizing is in terms of mano-dh\u0101tu.\\(^2\\) His only comment on \u2018heart,\u2019 when it is included in the description of cittam (answer [6]), is to say that, whereas it stands for cittam, it simply represents the inwardness (intimit\u00e9) of thought.\\(^3\\) But in the subsequent comment he has a remark of great interest, namely, that the \u2018heart-basis\u2019 is the place whither all the \u2018door-objects\u2019 come, and where they are assimilated, or received into unity. In this matter the Buddhist philosophy carries on the old Upanishad lore about the heart, just as Aristotle elaborated the dictum of Empedokles, that perception and reasoning were carried on in \u2018the blood round the heart.\u2019\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. below, pp. 214, 215, with 209-211.\n\n\\(^2\\) Asl. 264; below, p. 129, fn.\n\n\\(^3\\) Asl. 140: \u2018Heart=thought (Hadayan ti cittam). In the passage\u2014\u201cI will either tear out your mind or break your heart\u201d\u2014the heart in the breast is spoken of. In the passage (M. i. 32)\u2014\u201cMethinks he planes with a heart that knows heart\u201d (like an expert)!\u2014the mind is meant. In the passage\u2014\u201cThe vakkam is the heart\u201d\u2014the basis of heart is meant. But here cittam is spoken of as heart in the sense of inwardness (abbhantaram).\u2019 It is interesting to note that, in enumerating the r\u016bpaskandha in the Visuddhi Magga, Buddhaghosa\u2019s sole departure from conformity with the Dhamma-Sangani is the inclusion of hadaya-vatthu after \u2018vitality.\u2019\n\nThe other term, \u2018that which is clear\u2019 (pandaram), is an ethical metaphor. The mind is said to be naturally pure, but defiled by incoming corruptions. (Cf. A. i., p. 10.)\nIt is possible that this ancient and widely-received tradition of the heart (rather than the brain, for instance) as the seat of the soul or the mind is latent in the question put by Mah\u0101kotthito, a member of the Order, to S\u0101riputta, the leading apostle:\u00b9 \u2018Inasmuch as these five indriyas (senses) are, in province and in gratification, mutually independent, what process of reference is there,\u00b2 and who is it that is gratified by them in common?\u2019 So apparently thinks Dr. Neumann, who renders S\u0101riputta\u2019s answer\u2014\u2018The mind (mano)\u2019\u2014by Herz. This association must, however, not be pressed. For in another version of this dialogue more recently edited, Gotama himself being the person consulted, his interlocutor goes on to ask: What is the patisara\u1e47am of mano\u2014of recollection (sati)\u2014of emancipation\u2014of Nirvana?\u00b3 So that the meaning of the first question may simply be that as emancipation looks to, or makes for Nirvana, and recollection or mindfulness for emancipation, and ideation or thinking refers or looks\n\n\u00b9 M. i. 295.\n\u00b2 Kim patisara\u1e47am. The word is a crux, and may bear more than one meaning. Cf. Vinaya Texts (S. B. E. xvii.), ii., p. 364, n.; \u2018Dialogues of the Buddha,\u2019 i., p. 122, n. Dr. Neumann renders it by Hort, following Childers.\n\nIt is worthy of note that, in connexion with the heresy of identifying the self with the physical organism generally (below, p. 259), the Cy. makes no allusion to heart, or other part of the r\u016bpam, in connexion with views (2) or (4). These apparently resembled Augustine\u2019s belief: the soul is wholly present both in the entire body and in each part of it. With regard to view (3), is it possible that Plotinus heard it at Alexandria, or on his Eastern trip? For he, too, held that the body was \u2018in the soul,\u2019 permeated by it as air is by fire (Enn. iv.). Buddhaghosa\u2019s illustrative metaphor is \u2018as a flower being \u201cin\u201d its own perfume.\u2019 I regret that space fails me to reproduce his analysis of these twenty soul-hypotheses.\n\n\u00b3 S. v., p. 218. In the replies mano is referred to sati, sati to vimutti, and this to Nirvana.\nto memory,\\(^1\\) so sensation depends on thinking, on mental construction (to become effective as knowledge).\n\nIt is, indeed, far more likely that Buddhist teaching made little of and passed lightly over this question of a physical basis of thought or mind. It was too closely involved with the animistic point of view\u2014how closely we may see, for instance, in the Brihad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upanishad. When King Milinda puts a similar question respecting the subject of sensations,\\(^2\\) he does so from so obviously animistic a standpoint that the sage, instead of discussing mano, or heart, with him, argues against any one central subjective factor whatever, and resolves the process of cognition into a number of 'connate' activities. The method itself of ranking mental activity as though it were a sixth kind of sense seems to point in the same direction, and reminds us of Hume's contention, that when he tried to 'catch himself' he always 'tumbled on some particular perception.' Indeed it was, in words attributed to Gotama himself, the lesser blunder in the average man to call 'this four-elementish body' his soul than to identify the self with 'what is called cittam, that is, mano, that is, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam.' For whereas the body was a collocation that might hold together for many years, 'mind, by day and by night is ever arising as one thing, ceasing as another!'\\(^3\\)\n\nImpermanence of conscious phenomena was one of the two grounds of the Buddhist attack. So far it was on all fours with Hume. The other ground was the presence of law, or necessary sequence in mental procedure. The Soul was conceived as an entity, not only above change, an absolute constant, but also as an entirely free agent. Both\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. the interesting inquiry into the various modes of association in remembering, given in Mil., pp. 78, 79, and 77, 78.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mil. 54.

And both grounds were put forward by Gotama in his very first sermon.\\(^1\\) The standard formula for the latter only is reproduced in our Manual.\\(^2\\) And it is interesting to see the same argument clothed in fresh dress in the dialogue with Milinda referred to above. The point made is this: that if any one of the skandhas could be identified with a self or soul, it would, as not subject to the conditions of phenomena, act through any other faculty it chose. It would be a principle, not only of the nature of what we should call will, but also of genuine free will.\\(^3\\) Soul and Free Will, for the Buddhist, stand or fall together. But, he said, what we actually find is no such free agency. We only find certain organs (doors), with definite functions, natural sequence, the line of least resistance and association.\\(^4\\) Hence we conclude there is no transcendent 'knower' about us.\n\nHere I must leave the Buddhist philosophy of mind and theory of intellection. We are only at the threshold of its problems, and it is hence not strange if we find them as baffling as, let us say, our own confused usage of many psychological terms\u2014feeling, will, mind\u2014about which we ourselves greatly differ, would prove to an inquiring Buddhist. If I have not attempted to go into the crux of the sankh\u0101ra-skandha, it is because neither the Manual nor its Commentary brings us any nearer to a satisfactory hypothesis. For future discussion, however, the frequent enumerations of that skandha's content, varying with every changing mood, should prove pertinent. In every direction there is very much to be done. And each addition to the texts edited brings new light. Nor can philosophic interest fail in the long-run to accumulate about a system\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vin. i. 14; = M. i. 138, 300; S. iii. 66; cf. iv. 34.\n\n\\(^2\\) P. 257 et seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. the writer's article on the Vedalla Suttas, J.

Given a human being known to us by way of these phenomenal states, what is implied when we say that some of them are good, some bad, others neither?\n\nThe Dhamma-Sanga\u1e47i does not, to our loss be it said, define any one of these concepts. All it does is to show us the content of a number of 'thoughts' known as one or the other of these three species of dhamma. In a subsequent passage (pp. 345-348) it uses the substantival form of 'good' (kusala\u1e6d\u0101; another form is kosallam) in the sense of skill or proficiency as applied to various kinds of insight, theoretical or practical.\n\nNow if we turn to the later expression of old tradition in the Commentaries, we find, on the one hand, an analysis of the meaning of 'good'; on the other, the rejection of precisely that sense of skill, and of that alone out of four possible meanings, with respect to 'good' as used in Book I. Kusalam, 'we read,' may mean (a) wholesome, (b) virtuous, (c) skilful, (d) felicitic, or productive of happy result. The illustrations make these clear statements clearer. E.g. of (a), from the Dasaratha J\u0101taka: 'Is it good for you, sir, is it wholesome?' Of (b) 'What, sir, is good\n\n1 Asl. 38.\n2 The two adjectives are kusalam, an\u0101mayan.\nbehaviour in act? Sire, it is conduct that is blameless (anavajjo). Of (c) 'You are good at knowing all about the make of a chariot.' Again: 'The four girl-pupils are good at singing and dancing.' Of (d) 'Good states, brethren, are acquired through good karma having been wrought and stored up.'\n\nOf these four, (c) is alone ruled out as not applicable to the eight types of good thoughts constituting dhamma kusal\u0101. In so far, then, as we suffer the Buddhist culture of the fifth century to interpret the canon for us, 'good,' in the earlier ethics, meant that which insures soundness, physical and moral, as well as that which is felicific.\n\nThe further question immediately suggests itself, whether Buddhism held that these two attributes were at bottom identical. Are certain 'states' intrinsically good, i.e., virtuous and right, independently of their results? Or is 'good,' in the long-run at least, felicitous result, and only on that account so called? Are Buddhists, in a word, Intuitionists, or are they Utilitarians? Or is not a decidedly eclectic standpoint revealed in the comprehensive interpretation given of kusal\u0101?\n\nThese are, however, somewhat modern\u2014I am tempted to say, somewhat British\u2014distinctions to seek in an ancient theory of morals. They do not appear to have troubled Buddhism, early or late. The Buddhist might possibly have replied that he could not conceive of any thought, word, or deed as being intrinsically good and yet bad in its results, and that the distinction drawn by the Commentator was simply one of aspects.\n\nIf pressed, however, we can almost imagine the Buddhist well content with the relative or dependent good of Utilitarianism, so closely is his ethics bound up with cause and effect. Good, for him, is good with respect to karma\u2014that is, to pleasurable effect or eudaimonia.\n\nWith respect to the supremely good effect, to arahatship\n\n1 Cf. M. ii. 94.\nor Nirvana, he might, it is true, have admitted a difference, namely, that this state was absolutely good, and not good because of its results. It was the supreme Result or Fruit, and there was 'no beyond.' But then he did not rank Nirvana exactly in the category of good, and precisely for this reason, that in it moral causation culminated and ceased. He spoke of it as Indeterminate, as without result\u2014as a Freedom, rather than as a Good.\n\nHe would not then have fallen in with Aristotle's definition of Good in terms of aim, viz., as 'that at which everything aims.' Good was rather the means by and with which we aim. But that at which we aim is, in all lower quests, Sukham, in the one high quest, Vimutti (emancipation), or Nirvana.\n\nNor must the substitution of these two last terms for that well-being, that well-ness, '\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b5\u1f56 \u1f14\u03b3\u03bd\u03c5,' which is the etymological equivalent of sukham,\\(^1\\) be taken as indicating the limit of the consistent Hedonism or Eud\u00e6monism of the Buddhist. For he did not scruple to speak of these two also (Emancipation and Nirvana) in terms of pleasurable feeling. Gotama attaining his supreme enlightenment beneath the Bo-tree is said to have 'experienced Emancipation-bliss' (vimutti-sukha-patisamvedi).\\(^2\\) And to King Milinda the Sage emphatically declares Nirvana to be 'absolute (or entire) happiness' (ekanta-sukham).\\(^3\\) And we know, too, that Buddhism defined all right conduct and the sufficient motive for it in terms of escape from ill (dukkham, the antithesis of sukham) or suffering. Here then again their psychological proclivity is manifested. They analyzed feeling, or subjective experience, into three modes: sukham, dukkham, adukkham-asukham. And in Good and Bad they saw, not ends or positions of attainment, but the vehicles or agencies, or, to speak less in abstractions, the characteristic mark of those kinds of\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Cf. p. 12, n. 3.  \n\\(^{2}\\) Vin. i. 2, 3, quoted J\u00e4t. i. 77.  \n\\(^{3}\\) Mil. 313.\nconduct, by which well-being or ill-being might respectively be entailed.\n\nThe Buddhist, then, was a Hedonist, and hence, whether he himself would have admitted it or not, his morality was dependent, or, in the phrase of British ethics, utilitarian, and not intuitionist. Hedonist, let us say, rather than eudaemonistic, because of the more subjective (psychological) import of the former term. And he found the word sukh\u0101\u1e41 good enough to cover the whole ground of desirability, from satisfaction in connexion with sense\u2014compare Buddhaghosa's traveller refreshed obtaining both joy and ease\\(^1\\)\u2014up to the ineffable 'Content' of Nirvana.\\(^2\\)\n\nHe did not find in it the inadequacy that some moral philosophers have found in our 'Pleasure.' His ethical system was so emphatically a study of consequences\u2014of karma and vip\u0101ka (effect of karma)\u2014of seeing in every phenomenon a reaping of some previous sowing\u2014that the notion of good became for him inevitably bound up with result. As my late master used to say (ex cathedra): If you bring forward consequences\u2014how acts by way of result affect self and others\u2014you must come to feeling. Thence pleasure becomes prominent. And did not folk suffer loose, lower associations to affect their judgment, there would be no objection to Hedonism. For pleasures are of all ranks, up to that of a good conscience.'\n\nA reflection may here suggest itself to readers in this country who have, at the feet of Spencer, Bain, and Leslie Stephen, learnt to see, behind Nature's device of Pleasurable Feeling, the conservation of the species\u2014'quantity of life, measured in breadth as well as in length'\u2014as the more fundamental determinant of that which, in the long-run, becomes the end of conduct. Namely, that there seems a strange contradiction in a philosophic position which is content to find, in the avoidance of pain and the quest of pleasurable feeling, its fundamental spring of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Below, p. 12, n. 3.\n\n\\(^2\\) Santut\u1e6dhi. See p. 358, n. 2.\nmoral action while, at the same time, it says of life\u2014apart from which it admits no feeling to be possible\u2014that the attainment of its last phase is the one supremely happy event.\\(^1\\) Pleasurable feeling, from the evolutionist\u2019s standpoint, means, and is in order to, the increase, \u2018intensive and extensive,\u2019 of life. Yet to the Hedonistic Buddhist, the dissolution of the conditions of renewed existence is a happy event, i.e., an event that causes pleasurable feeling in the thoughtful spectator.\n\nI believe that the modern ethics of evolution would have profoundly interested the early Buddhists, who after their sort and their age were themselves evolutionists. And I believe, too, that they would have arisen from a discussion with our thinkers on this subject as stanch Buddhists and as stanch Hedonists as they had sat down. I admit that with respect to the desirableness of life taken quantitatively, and in two dimensions, they were frankly pessimistic. As I have already suggested,\\(^2\\) and have put forward elsewhere,\\(^3\\) to prize mere quantity of living stood by Gotama condemned as ignoble, as stupid, as a mortal bondage, as one of the four Asavas or Intoxicants.\\(^4\\) The weary, heart-rending tragedies immanent in the life of the world he recognised and accepted as honestly and fully as the deepest pessimist. The complexities, the distractions, the burdens, the dogging sorrow, the haunting fear of its approaching tread, inevitable for life lived in participation of all that the human organism naturally calls for, and human society puts forward as desirable\u2014all this he judged too heavy to be borne, not, indeed, by lay followers, but by those who should devote themselves to the higher life. To these he looked to exemplify and propagate and transmit\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf., e.g., M. P. S. 62; Mah\u0101 Sudassana-sutta, S. B. E. xi. 240, 289.\n\n\\(^2\\) See above, pp. lxix, lxx.\n\n\\(^3\\) In an article \u2018On the Will in Buddhism,\u2019 J. R. A. S., January, 1898.\n\n\\(^4\\) Cf. below, p. 290 et seq.\nhis doctrine. Theirs it was to lift the world to higher standpoints and nobler issues. Life in its fulness they at least could not afford to cultivate.\n\nBut if we take life of a certain quality where selective economy, making for a certain object, cuts off some lines of growth but forces others on\u2014then Buddhism, so far from 'negating the will to live' that kind of life, pronounced it fair and lovely beyond all non-being, beyond all after-being. If final death, as it believed, followed inevitably on the fullest fruition of it, it was not this that made such life desirable. Final dissolution was accepted as welcome, not for its own sake, but as a corollary, so to speak, of the solved problem of emancipation. It merely signified that unhealthy moral conditions had wholly passed away.\n\nKeeping in view, then, the notion of Good in thought, word and deed, as a means entailing various kinds of felicific result, we may see in Book I. of our Manual, first, the kind of conscious experience arising apart from systematic effort to obtain any such specific result, but which was bound, none the less, to lead to hedonistic consequences, pleasant or unpleasant (pp. 1-42). Next, we see a certain felicific result deliberately aimed at through self-cultivation in modes of consciousness called Good (pp. 43-97). And, incidentally, we learn something of the procedure adopted in that systematic culture.\n\nThe Commentary leaves us no room to doubt whether or not the phase r\u016bpap\u0101pattiy\u0101 magg\u0101m bh\u0101veti ('that he may attain to the heavens of Form he cultivates the way thereto') refers to a flight of imaginative power merely. 'Form = the r\u016bpa-bh\u0101vo,' or mode of existence so called. 'Attainment = nibbatti, j\u0101ti, sa\u00f1j\u0101ti'\u2014all being terms for birth and re-birth. So for the attaining to the Formless heavens. Through the mighty engine of 'good states,' induced and sustained, directed and developed\n\n---\n\n1 Asl. 162. See below, pp. 43 et seq., 71 et seq.\nby intelligence and self-control, it was held that the student might modify his own destiny beyond this life, and insure, or at least promote, his chances of a happy future. The special culture or exercise required in either case was that called Jh\u0101na, or rapt contemplation, the psychology of which, when adequately investigated, will one day evoke considerable interest. There was first intense attention by way of 'an exclusive sensation,'\\(^1\\) to be entered upon only when all other activity was relaxed to the utmost, short of checking in any way the higher mental functions. After a time the sensation practically ceases. The wearied sense gives out. Change, indispensable to consciousness, has been eliminated; and we have realized, at all events since Hobbes wrote, how *idem semper sentire et non sentire ad idem recidunt*. Then comes the play of the 'after-image,' and then the emergence of the mental image, of purely ideational or representative construction. This will be, not of the sense-object first considered, but some attenuated abstraction of one of its qualities. And this serves as a background and a barrier against all further invasion of sense-impressions for the time being. To him thus purged and prepared there comes, through subconscious persistence, a reinstatement of some concept, associated with feeling and conation (*i.e.*, with desire or aspiration), which he had selected for preliminary meditation. And this conception he now proceeds by a sort of psychical involution to raise to a higher power, realizing it more fully, deepening its import, expanding its application.\n\nSuch seems to have been the Kasi\u1e47a method according to the description in the Visuddhi Magga, chap. iv.,\\(^2\\) but there were several methods, some of which, the method, *e.g.*, of respiration, are not given in our Manual. Of the thoughts for meditation, only a few occur in the Dhamma-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See above, p. lxix.\n\n\\(^2\\) Translated in Warren's 'Buddhism in Translations,' p. 293 *et seq.* Cf. below, Book I., Part I., chap. ii. Cf. also Rhys Davids' 'Yog\u0101vacara's Manual,' Introduction.\nSang\u0101ni, such as the 'Sublime Abodes' of thought\u2014love, pity, etc. But in the former work we find numerous lists for exercise in the contemplative life, with or without the rapt musing called Jh\u0101na.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn the exercises calculated to bring out re-birth in the world of Form, it was chiefly necessary to ponder on things of this life in such a way as to get rid of all appetite and impulse in connexion with them, and to cultivate an attitude of the purest disinterestedness towards all worldly attractions. If the Formless sphere were the object of aspiration, it was then necessary, by the severest fetches of abstraction, to eliminate not only all sense-impression, but also all sensory images whatever, and to endeavour to realize conditions and relations other than those obtaining in actual experience.\\(^2\\) Thus, in either method a foretaste of the mode of re-becoming aspired after was attempted.\n\nBut besides and beyond the sort of moral consciousness characterizing these exercises which were calculated to promote a virtuous and happy existence in any one of the three worlds, there were the special conditions of intellect and emotion termed lok'uttaram cittam.\\(^3\\) Those exercises were open to the lay pupil and the bhikkhu alike. There was nothing especially 'holy,' nothing esoteric, about the practice of Jh\u0101na. The diligent up\u0101saka or up\u0101sik\u0101, pursuing a temporary course of such religious and philosophic discipline as the rising schools of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) J. P. T. S., 1891-1893. Synopsis of the Vis.

Logic). Some great adepts were credited with the power of actually partaking in other existences while yet in this, notably Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na (e.g., M. i.).\n\nGotama tells of another in the Kevaddha Sutta (D. i. 215), but tells it as a myth.\n\n\\(^3\\) P. 82 et seq. Cf. n. 2 on p. 81.\nBuddhism afforded, might be expected to avail himself or herself of it more or less. But those 'good' dhammas alluded to were those which characterized the Four Paths, or Four Stages of the way, to the full 'emancipation' of Nirvana. If I have rendered lokuttaram cittam by 'thought engaged upon the higher ideal' instead of selecting a term more literally accurate, it is because there is, in a way, less of the 'supramundane' or 'transcendent,' as we usually understand these expressions, about this cittam than about the aspiring moods described above. For this sort of consciousness was that of the man or woman who regarded not heaven nor re-birth, but one thing only, as 'needful': the full and perfect efflorescence of mind and character to be brought about, if it might be, here and now.\n\nThe Dhamma-Sangani never quits its severely dry and formal style to descant on the characteristics and methods of that progress to the Ideal, every step in which is elsewhere said to be loftier and sweeter than the last, with a wealth of eulogy besides that might be quoted. Edifying discourse it left to the Suttanta Books. But no rhetoric could more effectively describe the separateness and uncompromising other-ness of that higher quest than the one word A-pariyappanam\u2014Unincluded\u2014by which reference is made to it in Book III.\n\nYet for all this world of difference in the quo vadis of aspiration, there is a great deal of common ground covered by the moral consciousness in each case, as the respective expositions show. That of the Arahat in spe differs only in two sets of additional features conferring greater richness of content, and in the loftier quality of other features not in themselves additional.\n\nThis quality is due to the mental awakening or enlightenment of sambodhi. And the added factors are three constituents of the Noble Eightfold Path of conduct (which are, more obviously, modes of overt activity than of consciousness) and the progressive stages in the attainment of\nthe sublime knowledge or insight termed a\u00f1\u00f1\u0101. Our Western languages are scarcely rich enough to ring the changes on the words signifying 'to know' as those of India did on j\u00f1\u0101 and vid, dr\u015b and pa\u015b. Our religious ideals have tended to be emotional in excess of our intellectual enthusiasm. 'Absence of dulness' has not ranked with us as a cardinal virtue or fundamental cause of good. Hence it is difficult to reproduce the Pali so as to give impressiveness to a term like a\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 as compared with the mere \u1e47\u0101\u1e47am, usually implying less advanced insight, with which the 'first type of good thought' is said to be associated.\n\nBut I must pass on. As a compilation dealing with positive culture, undertaken for a positive end, it is only consistent that the Manual should deal briefly with the subject of bad states of consciousness. It is true that akusalam, as a means leading to unhappy result, was not conceived as negatively as its logical form might lead us to suppose. Bad karma was a 'piling up,' no less than its opposite. Nevertheless, to a great extent, the difference between bad types of thought and good is described in terms of the contradictories, of the factors in the one kind and in the other. Nor are the negatives always on the side of evil. The three cardinal sources of misery are positive in form. And the five 'Path-factors' go to constitute what might have been called the Base Eightfold Path.\n\nWe come, finally, to the third ethical category of avy\u0101kata\u1e41, the Inexplicit or Indeterminate. The subject is difficult if interesting, bringing us as it does within closer range of the Buddhist view of moral causation. The hall-mark of Indeterminate thought is said to be 'absence of result'\u2014that is, of pleasant or painful result. And there are said to be four species of such\n\n1 Viz., Ana\u00f1\u00f1at'a\u00f1\u00f1ass\u0101mitindriyam, a\u00f1\u00f1indriyam, a\u00f1\u00f1at\u0101vindriyam. Pp. 86, 96, 97, 150. Cf. Dh.

Two instances, at least, occur to me in the Nik\u0101yas,\\(^2\\) where the talk was cut short, in the one case by Gotama himself, in the other by the woman- apostle Dhammadinn\u0101, when the interlocutor brought up Nirvana for discussion of this sort. This is possibly the reason why, in a work like our Manual, the concept is presented\u2014in all but the commentarial appendixes\u2014under the quasi-metaphysical term \u2018uncompounded element.\u2019 It is classed here as a species of Indeterminate, because, although it was the outcome of the utmost carrying power of good karma, it could, as a state of mind and character, itself work no good effect for that individual mind and character. These represented pure effect. The Arahat could afford to live wholly on withdrawn capital and to use it up. His conduct, speech and thought are, of course, necessarily \u2018good,\u2019 but good with no \u2018heaping-up\u2019 potency.\n\nOf the other two Indeterminates, it is not easy to say whether they represent aspects only of states considered with respect to moral efficacy, or whether they represent divisions in a more rigid and artificial view of moral causation than we should, at the present day, be prepared to maintain. To explain: every thought, word and deed (morally considered) is for us at once the effect of certain antecedents, and the cause, or part of the cause, of subsequent manifestations of character. It is a link, both held and holding. But in vip\u0101ko we have dhammas\n\n\\(^1\\) See Appendix II.  \n\\(^2\\) S. v. 218; M. i. 304.\nconsidered, with respect to cause, merely as effects; in kiriya\\(^1\\) we have dhammas considered, with respect to effect, as having none. And the fact that both are divided off from Good and Bad\u2014that is to say, from conduct or consciousness considered as causally effective\u2014and are called Indeterminate, seems to point, not to aspects only, but to that artificial view alluded to. Yet in this matter I confess to the greater wisdom of imitating the angels, rather than rushing in with the fools. Life presented itself to the Buddhist much as the Surrey heath appeared to the watchful eyes of a Darwin\u2014as a teeming soil, a khetta\\(^2\\), where swarmed the seeds of previous karmas waiting for 'room,' for opportunity to come to effect. And in considering the seed as potential effect, they were not, to that extent, concerned with that seed as capable of producing, not only its own flower and fruit, but other seed in its turn.\n\nHowever that may have been, one thing is clear, and for us suggestive. Moral experience as result pure and simple was not in itself uninteresting to the Buddhists. In dealing with good and bad dhammas, they show us a field of the struggle for moral life, the sowing of potential well-being or of ill. But in the Avy\u0101katas we are either outside the struggle and concerned with the unmoral R\u016bpa\\(^3\\), or we walk among the sheaves of harvest. From the Western standpoint the struggle covers the whole field of temporal life. Good and bad 'war in the members' even of its Arahats. The ideal of the Buddhist, held as realizable under temporal conditions, was to walk\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I am indebted to the Rev. Suriyagoda Sumangala, of Ratmalan\u0113, Ceylon, for information very kindly given concerning the term kiriya or kriya. He defines it as 'action ineffective as to result,' and kiriya-cittam as 'mind in relation to action ineffective as to result.' He adds a full analysis of the various modes of kiriya taught by Buddhists at the present day.\n\n\\(^2\\) 'Origin of Species,' p. 56. A. i. 223, 224. Cf. Asl. 360.\namong his sheaves 'beyond the Good and the Bad.' The Good consisted in giving hostages to the future. His ideal was to be releasing them, and, in a span of final, but glorious existence, to be tasting of the finest fruit of living\u2014the peace of insight, the joy of emancipation. This was life supremely worth living, for\n\n'leben heisst\nIn Freiheit leben und mit freiem Geist!'\n\nThe Good, to take his own metaphor, was as a raft bearing him across the stream of danger. After that he was to leave it and go on. 'And ye, brethren, learn by the parable of the raft that ye must put away good conditions, let alone bad.'\n\nIt is not easy for us, who have learnt from Plato to call our Absolute the Good and our Ideal a summum bonum, to sympathize really with this moral standpoint. Critics see in it an aspiration towards moral stultification and self-complacent egoism.\n\nYes, there is little fear but that in the long-run fuller knowledge will bring deeper insight into what in Buddhism is really worthy of admiration for all time. If it is now accused of weakening the concept of individuality by rejecting soul, and, at the same time, of fostering egoistic morality, it is just possible that criticism is here at fault. On the ruins of the animistic view, Buddhism had to reconstruct a new personality, wholly phenomenal, impermanent, law-determined, yet none the less able, and alone able, by indomitable faith and will, to work out a personal salvation, a personal perfection. Bearing this in mind and surveying the history of its altruistic missionary labours, we cannot rashly cast egoistic morality at it to much effect. Nor has it much to fear from charges of stultification, quietism, pessimism and the like. We are misled to a\n\n1 Nietzsche on Buddhism in 'Der Antichrist.'\n2 A. Pfungst, 'An Giordano Bruno.'\n3 See the third quotation, p. vii.\ncertain extent herein by the very thoroughness of its methods of getting at the moral life by way of psychical training. We see, as in our Manual, and other canonical records, elaborate systems for analyzing and cultivating the intellectual faculties, the will and feeling, and we take these as substitutes for overt moral activity, as ends when they are but means. And if the Dhamma-Sangani seems to some calculated to foster introspective thought to a morbid extent, it must not be forgotten that it is not Buddhist philosophy alone which teaches that, for all the natural tendency to spend and be spent in efforts to cope, by thought and achievement, with the world without, 'it is in this little fathom-long mortal frame with its thinkings and its notions that the world' itself and the whole problem of its misery and of the victory over it lies hid.\n\nIf I have succeeded to any extent in connecting the contents of this Manual with the rest of the Buddhist Pitakas, it is because I had at my disposal the mass of material accumulated in my husband's MS. Pali dictionary. Besides this, the selection of material for Sections II. and III. of my Introduction is his work. Besides this I owe him a debt of gratitude indefinitely great for advice and criticism generally.\n\n1 See second quotation, p. vii.\nBOOK I.\n\nTHE GENESIS OF THOUGHTS\n(Cittupp\u0101da-kanda\u1e41).\n\nPART I.\u2014GOOD STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nThe Eight Main Types of Thought relating to the Sensuous Universe (K\u0101m\u0101vacara-attha-mah\u0101cit-t\u0101ni).]\u00b9\n\nI.\n\n[1] Which are the states that are good?\u00b2\n\nWhen a good thought concerning the sensuous universe\u00b3 has arisen, which is accompanied by happiness and associated with knowledge,\u2074 and has as its object a\n\n\u00b9 The brackets enclosing this and all other headings indicate that the latter have been transposed from the position they occupy in the text.

According to the Cy., a good thought deserves to be thus distinguished on three grounds: from the karma it produces, from the maturity of the faculties it involves, and from the remoteness of mental and moral infirmity which it implies (Asl. 76). Sampayuttam\u2014lit., con-yoked\u2014is, in the Kath\u0101vatthu, quoted by the Cy. (p. 42), described as including the following relations (between one 'state' and another): concomitant (sahagat\u0101), connate (sahajat\u0101), contiguous\nsight,\\(^1\\) a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch;\\(^2\\) a [mental] state,\\(^3\\) or what not,\\(^4\\) then there is\n\n(i) contact (\\(\\S\\ 2\\)),\n\n(ii) feeling (\\(\\S\\ 3\\)),\n\n(samsatth\u0101), having a common origin (ekupp\u0101d\u0101), a common cessation (ekanirodh\u0101), a common basis or embodiment (ekavathuk\u012b), a common object of attention (ek\u0101ramman\u0101). In the present work the term is subsequently rendered by \u2018connected,\u2019 e.g., in \\(\\S\\ 1007\\), etc. The preceding adjectival phrase, somanassa-sahagatam, which I have rendered \u2018accompanied by happiness,\u2019 is virtually declared by the Cy. to be here equivalent to somanassa-sampayuttan\u012b, inasmuch as it is to be interpreted in its fullest intension. Of its five distinguishable shades of meaning, the one here selected is that of \u2018conjoined\u2019 (samsattham). And of the four distinguishable connotations of \u2018conjoined,\u2019 the one here selected is that of \u2018connate.\u2019 Hence \u2018accompanied by\u2019 means here \u2018connate.\u2019 And further, inasmuch as the concomitance is not between two corporeal phenomena, or between a corporeal and an incorporeal phenomenon, it is of that persistent and thoroughgoing kind\u2014persisting beyond the common origin\u2014which is described under the word \u2018associated.\u2019\n\nThus far the intricate Buddhaghosa.

Buddhaghosa rejects the opinion that a dhamm\u0101rammanam is something outside the range of the senses, and cites M. i. 295, where S\u0101riputta declares that, whereas\n(iii) perception (\u00a7 4),\n(iv) thinking (\u00a7 5),\n(v) thought (\u00a7 6),\n(vi) conception (\u00a7 7),\n(vii) discursive thought (\u00a7 8),\n(viii) joy (\u00a7 9),\n(ix) ease (\u00a7 10),\n(x) self-collectedness (\u00a7 11),\n(xi) the faculty of faith (\u00a7 12),\n(xii) the faculty of energy (\u00a7 13),\n(xiii) the faculty of mindfulness (\u00a7 14),\n(xiv) the faculty of concentration (\u00a7 15),\n(xv) the faculty of wisdom (\u00a7 16),\n\neach sense has its specific field, the mano has all these five fields as its scope. At the moment when an object enters 'the door of the eye' or other sense, it enters also the door of the ideating faculty causing the consciousness, or one's being, to vibrate (bhavangacalanassa paccayo hoti), just as the alighting bird, at the same moment, strikes the bough and casts a shadow (ibid. 72).\u2014As we might say, presentative cognition is invariably accompanied by representative cognition.\u2014Then, in the course of the mental undulations arising through this disturbance by way of sense impact, one of these eight psychoses termed Mah\u0101citt\u0101ni may emerge. 'But in pure representative cognition (suddha-manodv\u0101re) there is no process of sensory stimulation,' as when we recall past sense-experience.\u2014The process of representation is illustrated in detail, and completes an interesting essay in ancient psychology. In the case of seeing, hearing, and smell, past pleasant sensations are described as being simply revived during a subsequent state of repose. In the case of taste and touch, it is present disagreeable sensations which suggest certain contrasted experience in the past. But the commentator is not here interested in 'association by contrast' as such.\n\nLit., 'or whatever [object the thought] is about.' The gist of the somewhat obscure comment is that, while no new class of objects is here to be understood over and above those of present or past sensations, there is no serial or numerical order in which these become material for thought.\n(xvi) the faculty of ideation (\u00a7 17),\n(xvii) the faculty of happiness (\u00a7 18),\n(xviii) the faculty of vitality (\u00a7 19);\n(xix) right views (\u00a7 20),\n(xx) right intention (\u00a7 21),\n(xi) right endeavour (\u00a7 22),\n(xii) right mindfulness (\u00a7 23),\n(xiii) right concentration (\u00a7 24);\n(xxiv) the power of faith (\u00a7 25),\n(xxv) the power of energy (\u00a7 26),\n(xxvi) the power of mindfulness (\u00a7 27),\n(xxvii) the power of concentration (\u00a7 28),\n(xxviii) the power of wisdom (\u00a7 29),\n(xxix) the power of conscientiousness (\u00a7 30),\n(xxx) the power of the fear of blame (\u00a7 31);\n(xxxi) absence of lust (\u00a7 32),\n(xxxii) absence of hate (\u00a7 33),\n(xxxiii) absence of dulness (\u00a7 34);\n(xxxiv) absence of covetousness (\u00a7 35),\n(xxxv) absence of malice (\u00a7 36),\n(xxxvi) right views\u00b9 (\u00a7 37);\n(xxxvii) conscientiousness (\u00a7 38),\n(xxxviii) fear of blame (\u00a7 39);\n(xxxix, xl) serenity in sense and thought (\u00a7\u00a7 40, 41),\n(xli, xlii) lightness in sense and thought (\u00a7\u00a7 42, 43),\n(xliii, xliv) plasticity in sense and thought (\u00a7\u00a7 44, 45),\n(xlv, xlvii) facility in sense and thought (\u00a7\u00a7 46, 47),\n(xlviii, l) fitness in sense and thought (\u00a7\u00a7 48, 49),\n(l) directness in sense and thought (\u00a7\u00a7 50, 51);\n(li) mindfulness (\u00a7 52),\n(lii) intelligence (\u00a7 53)\n(liii) quiet (\u00a7 54)\n\n\u00b9 According to Buddhaghosa the 'states' numbered xxxiv-vi are considered as equivalents of those numbered xxxi-iii respectively, but as taken under another aspect. In the prior enumeration the threefold 'root of good' is set out; in the latter, reference to the 'path of karma' is understood (Asl. 129).\n(liv) insight (\u00a7 55),\n(iv) grasp (\u00a7 56),\n(lvi) balance (\u00a7 57).\n\nNow these\u2014or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are good.\n\n[2] What on that occasion is contact (phasso)?\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Nine other states, according to the Cy., are here implied as factors in this psychosis, viz., desire (or conation, or volition, chando), resolve (adhimokkho), attention (manasikaro), equanimity (tatramajjhattata), pity (karun\u0101), sympathy (mudit\u0101), abstinence from evil conduct in act, speech, and mode of livelihood. And the opening words of this and similar supplementary clauses in the text are coined into a technical term\u2014ye-v\u0101panak\u0101, \u2018the or-whatever\u2019 [states],\u2014to signify such groups.\n\nThe Cy. then \u2018defines\u2019 the nine: desire, qualified as orthodox desire (dhammachando), to distinguish it from ethically undesirable desire (cf. \u00a7 1097, etc.), is the wish to act, the stretching forth the hand of the mind (cf. \u1f40\u03c0\u03ad\u03be\u03b9\u03c2) to grasp the object in idea. Resolve is steadfastness, decision, the being unshaken as a pillar. Attention is movement, direction of the mind, confronting the object. Equanimity\u2014lit., the mean (medium) state\u2014is the being borne along evenly, without defect or excess, without partiality. Pity and sympathy are described in \u00a7 258 et seq. The last three give those three factors of the Eightfold Path unrepresented in the analysis of the thought (Asl. 132, 133).\n\nIt is not without interest to note that in this supplementary category all the purely psychological states are wholly, or at least mainly, volitional or emotional.\n\n\u00b2 Touch or contact must be understood in a very general sense, as the outcome of three conditions: an impingeing sentient organ, an impingeing agency conceived as external to the sentient organ, and impact or collision. The similes in Mil. 60 of the rams and the cymbals are quoted in the Cy. The eye and its object are the usual illustration, but the representative imagination (mano or cittam) and its object are included as proceeding by way of contact, only without impact (sanghattanam). The real causal connexion in every case\u2014so I understand the, to me, obscurely\nThe contact which on that occasion is touching, the being brought into contact, the state of having been brought into touch with\u2014this is the contact that there then is.\n\n[3] What on that occasion is feeling (vedan\u0101)?\u00b9\n\nThe mental pleasure, the mental ease, which, on that occasion, is born of contact with the appropriate element of representative intellection;\u00b2 the pleasurable, easeful sensa-\n\nworded comment to say (Asl. 109)\u2014is mental, even though we speak of an external agency, just as when lac melts with heat we speak of hot coals as the cause, though the heat is in the lac's own tissue.\n\n'Contact' is given priority of place, as standing for the inception of the thought, and as being the sine qua non of all the allied states, conditioning them much as the roof-tree of a storied house supports all the other combinations of material (ibid. 107).\n\n\u00b9 Vedan\u0101 is a term of very general import, meaning sentience or reaction, bodily or mental, on contact or impression. Sensation is scarcely so loyal a rendering as feeling, for though vedan\u0101 is often qualified as 'born of the contact' in sense-activity, it is always defined generally as consisting of the three species\u2014pleasure (happiness), pain (ill), and neutral feeling\u2014a hedonistic aspect to which the term 'feeling' is alone adequate. Moreover, it covers representative feeling.\n\nThis general psychical aspect of vedan\u0101, as distinct from sensations localized bodily\u2014e.g., toothache\u2014is probably emphasized by the term 'mental' (cetasikam) in the answer. The Cy. points out that by this expression (=cittanissitattam) 'bodily pleasure is eliminated' (Asl. 139). It also illustrates the general scope of vedan\u0101 by the simile of a cook who, after preparing a number of dishes for his lord, tastes each critically to test them, the lord partaking of whichever he pleases. The cook represents all the associated states in the thought-complex, each functioning in one specific way. Vedan\u0101, the master, 'enjoys the essence (taste) of the object' as a whole.\n\n\u00b2 Tajj\u0101-manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47adh\u0101tu. Tajj\u0101 is paraphrased by anucchavik\u0101, sar\u016bp\u0101. Cf. A. i. 207; S. iv. 215; M. i. 190, 191; Mil. 53. On the remainder of the com-\ntion which is born of contact with thought;\u00b9 the pleasurable, easeful feeling which is born of contact with thought\u2014this is the feeling that there then is.\n\n[4] What on that occasion is perception (sa\u00f1\u00f1a)?\u00b2\n\nThe perception, the perceiving, the state of having perceived which on that occasion is born of contact with the compound term, see \u00a7 6. And on the hedonistic expressions in the answer, see \u00a7 10.\n\n\u00b9 Ceto-samphassajam...vedayitam. The latter term (experience) is, more literally, that which is felt, das Empfundene. Ceto, cittam are used interchangeably in the Cy. on these terms (see \u00a7 6). The 'contact' is that between idea or object and thought, or the ideating agency, conceived as analogous to the impact between sense-organ and sense-object. In consequence of this contact or presentation, emotional affection arises in consciousness.\n\n\u00b2 The apparently capricious way in which the intension of the term sa\u00f1\u00f1a is varied in the Pitakas makes it difficult to assign any one adequate English rendering. In the Mah\u0101vedalla Sutta (M. i. 293) and elsewhere (cf. Mil. 61) it is explained as the relatively simple form of intellective or cognition which consists in the discernment, recognition, assimilation of sensations\u2014e.g., of colours, as 'blue,' etc.\u2014the process termed in modern English psychology sense-perception, except that it is not quite clear that, in Buddhist psychology, as in English, the perception is made only on occasion of sense-stimulation. The answer, indeed, in our \u00a7 4 alludes to representative activity only. In the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta, however (cf. A. v. 105), sa\u00f1\u00f1a stands for the intellectual realization of a number of highly complex concepts, such as impermanence, non-substantiality, etc. In the Pothap\u0101da Sutta (D. i. 180-187), again, the sa\u00f1\u00f1a discussed is clearly what we should call consciousness, whether as opposed to the unconsciousness of trance, or as the raw material of n\u0101nam, or as conceivably distinct from the soul or Ego. Lastly, in a more popular sense the term is used (notably in the J\u0101takas and in commentators' similes) for sign, mark, or token.\n\nHere, if we follow the Cy. (Asl. 110), sa\u00f1\u00f1a means simply that sense-perception which discerns, recognises and gives class-reference to (upatthita-visaya), the impressions of sense. Its procedure is likened to the carpenter's recognition of certain woods by the mark he had made on each;\nappropriate element of representative intellection\u2014this is the perception that there then is.\n\n[5] What on that occasion is thinking (cetan\u0101)?\n\nThe thinking, the cogitating, the reflection, which is born of contact with the appropriate element of representative intellection\u2014this is the thinking that there then is.\n\n[6] What on that occasion is thought (cittam)?\n\nto the treasurer's specifying certain articles of jewelry by the ticket on each; to the wild animal's discernment in the scarecrow of the work of man. The essence of sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 is said to be recognition by way of a mark. In this notion of mark and marking lies such continuity of thought as may be claimed for the various uses of the term. The bare fact of consciousness means ability to discriminate\u2014that is, to mark. To mark is to perceive. And the ideas or concepts of 'impermanence,' 'impurity,' and the like, were so many acts of marking, though of a highly 're-representative' character. Sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, no less than cittam (see Introduction), and 'thought,' stands for both faculty and any act or product of that faculty. And it is even objectified so far as to signify further the result of any such act\u2014that is, in its connotation of mark or sign.\n\nIt is, I believe, when connoting the more specific sense of faculty, or of skandha, that it may safely be rendered by 'perception' or 'marking,' and may be taken to mean the relatively 'superficial,' 'transient' (Asl. 110, 111) play of cognition when concerned with objects of sense. In ch. xiv. of the Visuddhi Magga\u2014in a passage the late Henry C. Warren was good enough to transcribe for me\u2014sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 is in this way, and this way only, distinguished from vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam and pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101. The latter terms stand for cognition at (as we might say) a relatively higher and a still higher power, in virtue of the greater depth and complexity of the concepts they were exercised about (see \u00a7\u00a7 6, 16).\n\nThere is no more difficult problem in interpreting the Dhamma Sangani than to get at the grounds on which its compilers, and subsequently its commentator, saw fit to set out mutually independent descriptions of terms etymologically so identical as cetan\u0101 and cittam. The only parallel that suggests itself to me is the distinction drawn, during a long period in British philosophy, between 'reasoning' and 'reason'\u2014that is, between deductive inference and the nous, or no\u00ebtic function. Both pairs of terms are quite\nThe thought which on that occasion is ideation, mind, heart, that which is clear, ideation as the sphere of mind, the faculty of mind, intellect, the skandha of intellect, the appropriate element of representative intellect\u2014this is the thought that there then is.\n\npopular in form. Compare, e.g., in the Nid\u0101na-kath\u0101 (J\u0101t. i. 74), Buddha\u2019s reply to M\u0101ra: \u2018I have here no conscious (or intelligent) witness. . . . Let this . . . earth, unconscious though it be, be witness. . . . Sacetano koci sakkh\u012b, etc. . . . ayam acetan\u0101pi . . . pathav\u012b sakkhiti.\u2019 Again, in A. i., p. 224, the import seems simple and quite untechnical: \u2018Their thoughts (cetan\u0101) and hopes (lit., thinking and hoping) are fixed on lower things.\u2019 Hence I have kept to terms popular in form. This does not justify the use of terms so undifferentiated as \u2018thinking\u2019 and \u2018thought\u2019; yet I have returned to them, after essaying half a dozen substitutes, for various reasons. They show the close connection between the Buddhist pair of terms, instead of obscuring it; they are equally popular and vague in form and extension; the import of cetan\u0101 has much in common with a psychological account of thinking; no term misfits cittam less than \u2018thought,\u2019 unless it be \u2018heart,\u2019 on which see Introduction. It is unfortunate that Buddhaghosa does not give a comparative analysis of the two, as he does in the case of vitakka-vic\u0101ra and piti-sukham. Under cetan\u0101 he expatiates in forcible similes, describing it as a process of activity and toil, and as a co-ordinating, ordering function. He likens it to an energetic farmer, bustling about his fifty-five labourers (the fifty-five co-constituents in the thought-complex) to get in the harvest; to a senior apprentice at the carpenter\u2019s, working himself and supervising the tasks of the others; to the leader of a warrior band, fighting and inciting. To these notions the definition of N\u0101gasena (Mil. 61) only adds that of preparing (abhisankharanam), the other qualifying term being merely a denominative form (as if we should say \u2018thinkifying\u2019).\n\nIn so far, then, as \u2018thinking\u2019 connotes representative, co-ordinate intellect, it coincides with cetan\u0101. In its narrower, technical sense of intellect by way of general notions, it does not (see Introduction). Any way, to call it \u2018thinking\u2019 is sufficiently indefinite, and does not preclude the rendering of it elsewhere by such terms as \u2018reflecting,\u2019 \u2018cogitating,\u2019 \u2018considering,\u2019 etc. But the problem has still\n[7] What on that occasion is conception (vitakko)?\u00b9\n\nThe ratiocination, the conception, which on that occasion is the disposition,\u00b2 the fixation, the focussing,\u00b3 the applica-\n\nto be solved of how it is related to such terms as sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, cittam, and vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam. With regard to skandha, it is classed, not with cittam, but under the sankh\u0101ra-skandha, \u00a7 62.\n\nCittam, together with the terms in which it is described, is discussed in my Introduction.\n\n\u00b9 Vitakko and vic\u0101ro is another pair of terms which it is hard to fit with any one pair of English words. It is very possible that academic teaching came to attach a more pregnant and specialized import to them than was conveyed in popular and purely ethical usage. Cf. M. i., Suttas xix. and xx., where vitakk\u0101 would be adequately rendered by ideas, notions, or thoughts. In Asl. 114, 115, on the other hand (cf. Mil. 62, 63), the relation of the two to cittam and to each other is set out with much metaphor, if with too little psychological grasp. Vitakko is distinctively mental procedure at the inception of a train of thought, the deliberate movement of voluntary attention. As a king ascends to his palace leaning on the arm of favourite or relative, so thought ascends to its object depending upon the conceptual act (vitakko; Asl. 114). Other metaphorical attributes are its impingeing upon, circum-impingeing upon (pary\u0101hanam), the object, and, again, bringing it near. Hence in selecting \u2018conception\u2019 in preference to \u2018reasoning,\u2019 by which vitakko has often been translated, I wished to bring out this grasping, constructive, reaching-out act of the mind, this incipient fetch of the imagination, elaborated in the Buddhist scholastic analysis of the term; but I had no wish to read our own logical or psychological import of conception as intellecction by way of general notions, or the like, into the Eastern tradition. Yet just as conception may be so used as to include \u2018reasoning\u2019 or \u2018ratiocination,\u2019 so vitakko is, in the reply, described by takko, the term used for ratiocinative procedure, argument, or logic (cf. D. i. 12, 21). \u2018What,\u2019 asks the Cy., \u2018does one reason about (takkesi)? About a pot, a cart, the distance of anything. Well, vitakko is a stronger reasoning.\u2019\n\n\u00b2 On \u2018disposition,\u2019 \u2018right intention,\u2019 see \u00a7 21.\n\n\u00b3 Appan\u0101 vyappan\u0101, the latter an intensive form of the former (Asl. 142, 143). In the \u2018Yog\u0101vacara\u2019s Manual\u2019 (p. xi and passim) appan\u0101 denotes the dawn of the desired\ntion of the mind,\\(^1\\) right intention\u2014this is the conception that there then is.\n\n[8] What on that occasion is discursive thought (vic\u0101ro)?\\(^2\\)\n\nThe process, the sustained procedure (vic\u0101ro), the progress and access [of the mind] which on that occasion is the [continuous] adjusting and focussing of thought\\(^3\\)\u2014this is the discursive thought that there then is.\n\n[9] What on that occasion is joy (p\u012bti)?\\(^4\\)\n\nconcept during the practice of regulated meditation. Buddhaghosa defines it thus:\u2014ekagg\u0101m citta\u1e41 \u0101ramma\u1e47e appenti.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cetaso abhiniropan\u0101 = \u0101ramma\u1e47e cittam . . . patitthapeti (ibid.)\n\n\\(^2\\) Vic\u0101ro, as compared with vitakko, was used to express the movement and maintenance of the voluntary thought-continuum, as distinguished from the initiative grappling with the subject of reflection. Examining in detail, as compared with grasping the whole, is also read into it by commentators (Asl. 114). It is a pounding up (anumajjaman), as well as a linking together. Metaphors are multiplied, to show its relation to vitakko. It is as the reverberation of the beaten drum or bell is to the beating; as the planing movement of the bird\u2019s wings after the initial upsoaring; as the buzzing of the bee when it has alighted on the lotus; as the scouring of the dirty bowl when clutched; as the manipulating hand of the potter, vitakko being represented by the hand which holds the clay to the wheel, and so on. \u2018Investigation\u2019 would well represent the sustained activity; \u2018analysis,\u2019 the cogitation in details; \u2018discursive thought\u2019 gives some of the import of both, without introducing modern and Western implications.\n\n\\(^3\\) Like the adjusting of bow and arrow. \u2018Focussing\u2019 is anupekkham\u0101no.\n\n\\(^4\\) P\u012bti, as distinguished from sukham, is explicitly excluded from the skandha of feeling, considered as the irreducible hedonic constituent, and referred to the composite psychoses of the sankh\u0101ra skandha. It connotes emotion, as distinct from bare feeling; that is to say, p\u012bti is a complex psychical phenomenon, implying a \u2018central psycho-physical origin\u2019 and a widely diffused \u2018somatic resonance\u2019 (cf. Sully, \u2018The Human Mind,\u2019 ii. 56).\nThe joy which on that occasion is gladness, rejoicing at, rejoicing over, mirth and merriment, felicity,\\(^1\\) exultation, transport of mind\\(^2\\)\u2014this is the joy that there then is.\n\n[10] What on that occasion is ease (sukham)\\(^3\\)\n\nIt arises out of a present idea, and suffuses the whole being. By Buddhaghosa\u2019s day it was divided into five species: the thrill of joy, just causing \u2018the flesh to creep\u2019; the flash of joy, like lightning; the flood of joy, like the breakers on a sea-shore; ecstasy or transport, in which the subject could float in the air; and overwhelming suffusing joy (Asl. 115, 116). Instances are related of the fourth species (ubbega-piti), the inspiring idea being \u2018Buddh\u0101rammanam\u2019 (see also Visuddhi Magga, ch. iv.; \u2018Yog\u0101vacara\u2019s Manual,\u2019 vii.). The same word (ubbego) is used to describe the anguish or trembling over guilt discovered. See below, \u00a7 31 n.\n\n\\(^1\\) Vitti, meaning literally, as the Cy. points out, prosperity, wealth, and used here by analogy as a state conditioned by a source of pleasure. \u2018Happiness arises to him who is joyful through his joy, as it arises to the wealthy through his rice-possessions.\u2019 (Asl. 143.)\n\n\\(^2\\) Attamanat\u0101 cittassa. Buddhaghosa, who did not know the true etymology of this term, is ready as ever with a guess: attano manat\u0101, or mentality of one\u2019s self, not of another, subjective experience. If I am pained or pleased, that is peculiarly my affair (ibid.). Psychologically it is interesting to note that he is prepared to find this intimate, subjective reference in a state of intense feeling. \u2018Feeling is subjective experience par excellence . . . our feelings . . . are all our own.\u2019 (Sully, \u2018The Human Mind,\u2019 ii. 2; G. C. Robertson, \u2018Elements of Psychology,\u2019 185-188.)\n\n\\(^3\\) To contrast piti with sukham, Buddhaghosa draws a charming picture of the traveller who, fordone with journeying through a desert, hears with joy of a pool in a grove, and with joy comes upon it, and who, on drinking, bathing, and resting in the shade is filled with ease. Sukham, it is true, is not bare quiescence; it is positive, pleasurable feeling, and may have active concomitants; its \u2018essence\u2019 is expansion or increase (upabr\u016bhanam). But just as dukkham means, not so much pain as ill-being or misery, so does sukham mean well-being or sane and sound ca\u00f1\u00e6sthesis. And as \u2018joy\u2019 is the satisfaction of\nThe mental pleasure, the mental ease which on that occasion is the pleasant, easeful experience born of contact with thought, the pleasant, easeful feeling born of contact with thought\u2014this is the ease that there then is.\n\n[11] What on that occasion is self-collectedness (cittass' ekaggat\u0101)?\u00b9\n\nThe stability, solidity, absorbed steadfastness of thought\u00b2 which on that occasion is the absence of distraction.\n\ngaining (potentially or actually) what we desire, so is \u2018ease\u2019 the enjoyment of the flavour (French, savouer) of what we have gained (Asl. 117). See further \u00a7 60. \u2018Mental ease\u2019 (cetasikam sukham) is perhaps more correctly somanassam, rendered (\u00a7 1, etc.) by \u2018happiness\u2019, sukham being sometimes distinguished as bodily (k\u0101yikam) only. See S. v. 209.\n\n\u00b9 \u2018Citt\u2019 ekaggat\u0101, the one-peaked condition of mind, is a name for concentration (sam\u0101dhi),\u2019 says the Cy. (p. 118). And accordingly, whereas under \u00a7 15 it gives no further description of sam\u0101dhi, it here applies to citt\u2019 ekaggat\u0101 the metaphors used in Mil. 38 to illustrate sam\u0101dhi, viz., the centre part of a tent-shaped hut, and a chieftain leading his army. It then adds that \u2018this sam\u0101dhi, which is called self-collectedness, has, as its characteristic mark, the absence of wandering, of distraction; as its essence, the binding together of the states of mind that arise with it, as water binds the lather of soap; and as its concomitants, calmness, or wisdom\u2014for it is said, \u201che who is at peace he understands, he sees things as they really are\u201d\u2014and ease. The steadfastness of thought is likened to the steadiness of a lamp-flame in a windless place.\u2019 See \u2018Yog\u0101vacara\u2019s Manual,\u2019 p. xxvi.\n\n\u00b2 These three cognate terms are in the text cittassa thiti sanjhiti avatthiti. According to the Cy. (p. 143), the standing unshaken in or on the object (\u0101rammane) connoted by thiti is modified by the prefix sam to imply kneading together (sampildetv\u0101) the associated states in the object, and by the prefix ava to imply the being immersed in the object. The last metaphor is in Buddhist doctrine held applicable to four good and three bad states\u2014faith, mindfulness, concentration (= self-collectedness) and wisdom; craving, speculation and ignorance, but most of all to self-collectedness.\nbalance,\\(^1\\) imperturbed mental procedure, quiet,\\(^2\\) the faculty and the power of concentration, right concentration\u2014this is the self-collectedness that there then is.\n\n[12] What on that occasion is the faculty of faith (saddhindriyam)?\\(^3\\)\n\nThe faith which on that occasion is a trusting in, the professing confidence in,\\(^4\\) the sense of assurance, faith,\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Avisah\u0101ro, avikkhepo (v. \u00a7 57). Distraction and loss of equilibrium are attributed to the presence of 'excitement and perplexity' (\\(\\S\\S\\) 425, 429; Asl. 144).\n\n\\(^2\\) Samatho. Distinguished as of three species: mental calm (so used here); legal pacification, or settlement; calm in all the sansk\u0101ras, by which, according to the Cy. (144), is meant the peace of Nirvana.\n\n\\(^3\\) On 'faculty,' see Introduction.\n\nFaith is characterized and illustrated in the same terms and approximately the same similes as are used in Mil., pp. 34-60. That is to say, it is shown to be a state of mind where the absence of perplexity sets free aspiration and energy. It is described as trust in the Buddha and his system. There is, however, no dwelling just here on any terminus ad quem, as St. Paul did in speaking of 'the prize for the mark of the high calling,' etc., towards which he pressed in ardent faith. There is, rather, an insistence on that self-confidence born of conviction of the soundness of one's methods and efforts which is, as it were, an aspect of faith as a vis a tergo. In the simile of the stream, the Cy. differs from Trenckner's version of the Milinda to the extent of making the folk afraid to cross because of alligators and other monsters, till the hero takes his sword and plunges in. See the note on 'faith' in the translation of Mil. i. 56.\n\n\\(^4\\) I.e., in the Buddha, the Doctrine and the Order. Buddhaghosa is only interested in making the etymology bear on ethics, and compares the 'downward plunge' of confidence (o-kappan\u0101) in the attitude of faith to the 'sinking' in 'mindfulness,' the 'grounded stand' in 'concentration,' and the 'sounding' penetration of 'wisdom' (Asl. 144, 145).\n\n\\(^5\\) The Cy. puts forward an alternative explanation of the repetition in the description of this and following compounds of the first term of the compound, viz., 'faith.'\nfaith as a faculty and as a power\u2014this is the faith that there then is.\n\n[13] What on that occasion is the faculty of energy (viriyindriyam)?\u00b9\n\nThe mental inception\u00b2 of energy which there is on that occasion, the striving and the onward effort, the exertion\n\nAccording to the former, it is the method of Abhidamma to set out in isolation the adjectival part of a compound on which the substantival part depends: faith-faculty = faith (faculty of). According to the latter, the identity between the two abstractions, faith and faith-faculty, is brought out. The case of woman and attribute of femininity, it remarks, is different. (This may be a groping after the distinction between concrete and abstract.)\n\n\u00b9 Viriyam is by Buddhaghosa connected with (a) v\u012bra, the dynamic effectiveness which is the essence of the genus 'hero' (viro), (b) iriya, vibrating movement. He characterizes it by the two notions, 'supporting' and 'grasping at,' or 'stretching forward' (paggaho), and, again, by 'exerting' (uss\u0101hanam). Cf. Mil. 36; Sum. Vil. 63. And he cites the same similes as appear in the Milinda. He seems to have wished, as modern psychologists have done, to account for the two modes of conscious effort: Resistance and Free Energy. But he also emphasizes the fact that the energy in question is mental, not bodily (pp. 120 et seq., 145).\n\n\u00b2 \u0100rambho (cf. \u0101rammanam), overt action as distinguished from inaction, hence action at its inception, is distinguished by the Cy. as having six different implications, according as there is reference to karma, to a fault committed, to slaying or injury, or to action as such (kiriya), or energy as such.\n\nI do not pretend that the four following pairs of words fit those in the text exactly. They are mere approximations. 'Endeavour' is v\u0101y\u0101mo, the term representing 'energy' in the Noble Eightfold Path. 'Unfaltering' effort (asithila-parakkamata) is the attitude of one who has made the characteristic Buddhist vow: Verily may skin and nerve and bone dry up and wither, or ever I stay my energy, so long as I have not attained whatsoever by human vigour, energy, and effort is attainable! (M. i. 480). The desire sustained\u2014lit., not cast down\u2014is that felt on an occasion for making good karma.\nand endeavour, the zeal and ardour, the vigour and fortitude, the state of unfaltering effort, the state of sustained desire, the state of unflinching endurance, the solid grip of the burden, energy, energy as faculty and as power, right endeavour\u2014this is the energy that there then is.\n\n[14] What on that occasion is the faculty of mindfulness (satindriyam)?\u00b9\n\nThe mindfulness which on that occasion is recollecting, calling back to mind; the mindfulness\u00b2 which is remembering, bearing in mind, the opposite of superficiality\u00b3 and of obliviousness; mindfulness as faculty, mindfulness as power, right mindfulness\u2014this is the faculty of mindfulness that there then is.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Buddhaghosa's comment on sati, in which he closely follows and enlarges on the account in Mil. 37, 38, shows that the traditional conception of that aspect of consciousness had much in common with the Western modern theory of conscience or moral sense. Sati appears under the metaphor of an inward mentor, discriminating between good and bad and prompting choice. Hardy went so far as to render it by 'conscience,' but this slurs over the interesting divergencies between Eastern and Western thought. The former is quite unmystical on the subject of sati. It takes the psychological process of representative functioning (without bringing out the distinction between bare memory and judgment), and presents the same under an ethical aspect. See also under hiri, \u00a7 30; and the notion as described in 'Questions of Milinda,' 38, n. 2.\n\n\u00b2 The threefold mention of sati in the reply (cf. \u00a7 12) agrees with K., but not with Puggala Pa\u00f1\u00f1atti (p. 25). It is not noticed by the Cy.\n\n\u00b3 Apil\u0101panat\u0101. The Atthas\u0101lin\u012b solves the problem presented by this term (see Milinda (S.B.E.), vol. i., p. 58, n. 2) by deriving it from pilavati, to float, and interprets:\u2014'not floating on the surface like pumpkins and pots on the water,' sati entering into and plunging down into the object of thought. Cf. \u00a7 11, n. 2; \u00a7 12, n. 2, in which connection the term is again used. The positive form occurs infra, \u00a7 1349. P. P. has (a)vil\u0101panat\u0101 (21, 25). (Asl. 147; cf. 405.) I should have rendered the word by 'profundity,'\n[15] What on that occasion is the faculty of concentration (sa\u1e41\u0101dhindriyam)?\u00b9\n\nAnswer as for 'self-collectedness,' \u00a7 11.\n\n[16] What on that occasion is the faculty of wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1indriyam)?\u00b2\n\nhad I not preferred to bring out the negative form of the original.\n\n\u00b9 Buddhaghosa's etymology\u2014'\u0101rammane cittam samm\u0101 adhiyati, thapeti ti'\u2014is no doubt incorrect, sam\u0101-dh\u0101 being the sounder analysis; nevertheless, he brings out that voluntary and deliberate adjustment of the attention with a view to sustained mental effort which is connoted by sa\u1e41\u0101dhi (Asl. 122).\n\n\u00b2 To fit the term pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 with its approximate European equivalent is one of the cruces of Buddhist philosophy. I have tried in turn reason, intellect, insight, science, understanding, and knowledge. All of these have been, and are, used in the literature of philosophy with varying shades of connotation, according as the sense to be conveyed is popular and vague, psychological and precise, or transcendental and\u2014passez-moi le mot\u2014having precise vagueness. And each of them might, with one implication or another, represent pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101. The main difficulty in choice lay in determining whether, to the Buddhist, pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 stood for mental function, or for the aggregate product of certain mental functioning, or for both. When all the allusions to pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 in the Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final translation may become possible. Here it must suffice to quote two. In M. i. 292, he who has pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (pa\u00f1\u00f1av\u0101) is declared in virtue thereof to understand (paj\u0101n\u0101ti) the nature of the phenomenon of pain or ill (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 124 Gotama asks: What is this pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101? and himself sets out its content as consisting in certain intellectual attainments, viz., the Jh\u0101nas, insight into the nature of impermanence, the mental image of one's self, the power of Iddhi, the cosmic Ear, insight into other minds, into one's own past lives, the cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all vitiating tendencies. Buddhaghosa also (Vis. M., ch. xiv.) distinguishes pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 from sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 and vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101na. He describes it as adequate to discern not only what these can, viz., sense-objects and the Three Marks (impermanence, pain, and non-substantiality) respectively, but also the\nThe wisdom which there is on that occasion is understanding, search, research, searching the Truth,\\(^1\\) discernment, discrimination, differentiation, erudition, proficiency, subtlety, criticism, reflection, analysis, breadth,\\(^2\\) sagacity,\\(^3\\) leading,\\(^4\\) insight, intelligence, incitement;\\(^5\\) wisdom as faculty, wisdom as power, wisdom as a sword,\\(^6\\) wisdom as a height,\\(^7\\) wisdom as light,\\(^8\\) wisdom as glory,\\(^9\\) wisdom as splendour,\\(^10\\) wisdom as a precious stone; the absence of dulness, searching the Truth,\\(^11\\) right views\u2014this is the wisdom that there then is.\n\n[17] What on that occasion is the faculty of ideation (representative imagination, manindriya)?  \nAnswer as for \u2018thought\u2019 (cittam), \u00a7 6.\n\nPath. For him, then, it might be called intellect \u2018at a higher power.\u2019 And in Gotama\u2019s reply, all those attainments are described in terms of intellectual process. Nevertheless, it is clear that the term did not stand for bare mental process of a certain degree of complexity, but that it also implied mental process as cultivated in accordance with a certain system of concepts objectively valid for all Buddhist adepts. Hence, I think it best to reject such terms as reason, intellect, and understanding, and to choose wisdom, or science, or knowledge, or philosophy. Only they must be understood in this connexion as implying the body of learning as assimilated and applied by the intellect of a given individual.

Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 82, 295, 441. The reason of its omission is probably that in the presence of life, by which the complex of dhammas is sustained as lotuses by water, or as an infant by its nurse (Asl. 124), there is nothing contingent on the ethical quality (good, bad, or indeterminate) of the given complex.\n3 For a discussion of the term ditthi, see \u00a7 1003. On these five factors of the Path see Introduction.\n4 Sankappo is by the Cy. especially identified with the expression cetaso abhiniropan\u0101, application of the mind, the disposition or adjustment of attention, that on which the heart is set, hence aspiration, intention, purpose, design.\n[25] What on that occasion is the power of faith (saddh\u0101balam)?\nAnswer as for the \u2018faculty of faith,\u2019 \u00a7 12.\n\n[26] What on that occasion is the power of energy (viriyabalam)?\nAnswer as for the \u2018faculty of energy,\u2019 \u00a7 13.\n\n[27] What on that occasion is the power of mindfulness (satibalam)?\nAnswer as for the \u2018faculty of mindfulness,\u2019 \u00a7 14.\n\n[28] What on that occasion is the power of concentration (sam\u0101dhibalam)?\nAnswer as for \u2018self-collectedness,\u2019 \u00a7 11.\n\n[29] What on that occasion is the power of wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101balam)?\nAnswer as for the \u2018faculty of wisdom,\u2019 \u00a7 16.\n\n[30] What on that occasion is the power of conscientiousness (hiribalam)?\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Hiri and ottappam, as analyzed by Buddhaghosa, present points of considerable ethical interest. Taken together they give us the emotional and conative aspect of the modern notion of conscience, just as sati represents it on its intellectual side. The former term \u2018is equivalent to shame (lajj\u0101),\u2019 the latter to \u2018anguish (ubbego) over evil-doing.\u2019 Hiri has its source within; ottappam springs from without. Hiri is autonomous (att\u0101dhipati); ottappam, heteronomous, influenced by society (lok\u0101dhipati). The former is established on shame; the latter on dread. The former is marked by consistency; the latter by discernment of the danger and fearsomeness of error. The subjective source of hiri is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is due to one\u2019s birth, age, worth and education. Thus, one having hiri will think, \u2018Only mean folk (fishers, etc.), children, poor wretches, the blind and ignorant, would do such an act,\u2019 and he refrains. The external source of ottappam is the idea that \u2018the body of the faithful will blame you,\u2019 and hence one refrains. If a man have hiri, he is, as said the Buddha, his own best master. To one who is sensitive by way of ottappam, the masters of the faith are the best guides (Asl. 126).\n\nIn a supplementary paragraph (p. 127) the \u2018marks\u2019 (consistency, etc.) are thus explained: In hiri one reflects\nThe feeling of conscientious scruple\\(^1\\) which there is on that occasion when scruples ought to be felt, conscientious scruple at attaining to bad and evil states\u2014this is the power of conscientiousness that there then is.\n\n[31] What on that occasion is the power of the fear of blame (ottappabalam)?\n\nThe sense of guilt,\\(^2\\) which there is on that occasion, where a sense of guilt ought to be felt, a sense of guilt at attaining to bad and evil states\u2014this is the fear of blame that there then is.\n\n[32] What on that occasion is the absence of lust (alobho)?\n\nThe absence of lust, of lusting, of lustfulness, which there is on that occasion, the absence of infatuation, the feeling and being infatuated, the absence of covetousness, that absence of lust which is the root of good\\(^3\\)\u2014this is the absence of lust that there then is.\n\n[33] What on that occasion is the absence of hate (adoso)?\n\non the worth of one's birth, one's teacher, one's estate, and one's fellow-students. In ottappam one feels dread at self-reproach, the blame of others, chastisement, and retribution in another life.\n\n\\(^1\\) Hiriyati, paraphrased by jigucchati (Asl. 149; D. i. 174; M. i. 78).\n\n\\(^2\\) Ottappati, paraphrased by ubbego (Asl. 124).\n\n\\(^3\\) I.e., the fundamental condition, the cause of goodness. On 'covetousness' and 'infatuation,' see \u00a7\u00a7 35, 1059. Alobho and its two co-ordinate virtues, the threefold 'root' of goodness, lose all their force in English negatives, but to a Buddhist convey doubtless as much impressiveness, as much of positive import, as the negative 'immortality' does to the Christian. Alobho, e.g., involves active altruism; adoso, active sympathy; amoho, a life of culture (see \u00a7 34, n.). I do not know any positive terms meet to represent them.\n\nThe 'mark' of the first is absence of greed, or of adhesion, as a drop of water runs off a lotus leaf. Its essence is independence, like that of the emancipated bhikshu (Asl. 127).\nThe absence of hate, of hating,\\(^1\\) of hatred, which there is on that occasion, the absence of malice, of spleen,\\(^2\\) the absence of hate which is the root of good\u2014this is the absence of hate that there then is.\n\n[34] What on that occasion is the absence of dulness (amoho)?\n\nAnswer as for the 'faculty of wisdom,' \u00a7 16.\\(^3\\)\n\n[35] What on that occasion is the absence of covetousness (anabhijjh\u0101)?\n\nAnswer as for the 'absence of lust,' \u00a7 32.\\(^4\\)\n\n[36] What on that occasion is the absence of malice (avy\u0101pado)?\\(^5\\)\n\nAnswer as for the 'absence of hate,' \u00a7 33.\n\n[37] What on that occasion are right views (samaditthi)?\\(^6\\)\n\nAnswer as for the 'faculty of wisdom,' \u00a7 16.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) K. reads ad\u016bsan\u0101, ad\u016bsitattam. The 'mark' of adoso is said to be absence of churlishness and crossness (see \u00a7 1060); its essence the suppression of annoyance and fever; its immediate result is loveliness\u2014like the full moon (Asl. 127).\n\n\\(^2\\) 'The opposite of the pain felt when one is angry' (Asl. 150).\n\n\\(^3\\) Buddhaghosa expatiates at some length on the excellencies of the fundamental trinity of Buddhist virtue. To take a few only: alobho (1) involves health, adoso (2) youth (hate ages quickly), amoho (3) long life (through prudence). (1) tends to material good through generosity (cf. 'he that soweth plenteously,' etc.); (2) to the acquisition of friends, won and held by love; (3) to self-development. (1) leads to life in the devaloka, (2) to life in the Brahmaloka, (3) to Arahatship. (1) gives insight into impermanence, and, conversely, (2) and (3) into the other two marks ('pain' and 'non-substantiality,' respectively).\n\n\\(^4\\) Abhijjh\u0101 and lobho are synonymous. See \u00a7\u00a7 1059 and 1136, where abhijjh\u0101 stands for lobho.\n\n\\(^5\\) Described (Asl. 129) as the being void of any wish to destroy welfare of others, bodily or mental, their advantages in this or other worlds, or their good reputation.\n\n\\(^6\\) Cf. \u00a7 1 (xxxvi), footnote.\n[38] What on that occasion is conscientiousness (hiri)?\nAnswer as for the 'power of conscientiousness,' \u00a7 30.\n\n[39] What on that occasion is the fear of blame (ottappam)?\nAnswer as for the 'power of the fear of blame,' \u00a7 31.\n\n[40] What on that occasion is repose of sense (kayapassaddhi)?\u00b9\n\nThe serenity,\u00b2 the composure which there is on that occasion, the calming, the tranquillizing, the tranquillity of the skandhas of feeling, perception and syntheses\u2014this is the serenity of sense that there then is.\n\n[41] What on that occasion is serenity of thought (cittapassaddhi)?\n\nThe serenity, the composure which there is on that occasion, the calming, the tranquillizing, the tranquillity of the skandha of intellect\u2014this is the serenity of thought that there then is.\n\n[42] What on that occasion is buoyancy\u00b3 of sense (kayalahut\u0101)?\n\nThe buoyancy which there is on that occasion, the alertness in varying,\u2074 the absence of sluggishness\u2075 and inertia, in the skandhas of feeling, perception and syntheses\u2014this is the buoyancy of sense that there then is.\n\n[43] What on that occasion is buoyancy of thought (cittalahut\u0101)?\n\n\u00b9 On the meaning of kayo see Introduction.\n\u00b2 Passaddhi is described as a state free from pain\u2014where pain is allayed and suppressed; where tremor or unquiet is replaced by 'coolness'\u2014the opposite to the states called kilesas, especially excitement (\u00a7 1229).

Thus, if the constituent factors of the thought be regarded under the aspect of classified aggregates (r\u0101satthena, or khandhatthena), they all fall under four heads. All that do not belong to the skandhas of feeling, perception, or intellect, come under the sansk\u0101ra-skandha. Regarded under the aspect of collocation or conjuncture (\u0101yatan\u0101ni), they all fall under two heads, corresponding to the fourth, and to the first, second, and third, of those four skandhas respectively. Regarded under the aspect of phenomena, of non-no\u016bmena (sabh\u0101vatthena, su\u00f1\u00f1atatthena, nissattatthena), they all fall under two heads, corresponding to the two preceding.

The significance of this section in the student's course of study seems to have consisted simply in this: That the interest being withdrawn from the nature and numbers of the particular constituents in each of the species of mental activity to which the thought-complex is reducible, emphasis is laid on the principle that this same thought-complex is an aggregate or combination of such phenomenal factors, and nothing more. 'There are states of consciousness' (dhamm\u0101 honti); that is (Asl. 155), 'there is no permanent entity or self which acquires the states.' 'The states are to be understood phenomenally. There is no other being or existence or person or individual whatever.'\n[122] What on that occasion are states?\nThe skandhas of feeling, of perception, of syntheses, of intellection.\n\n[123] What on that occasion are skandhas?\nAnswer as in \u00a7 59.\n\n[124-145] Similar questions are then put respecting 'spheres,' 'elements,' and so on through the list of constituent species. The answers are identical with those given to similar questions in the previous 'Summary,' viz., in \u00a7\u00a7 64, 67, 70, 74, 83, 89, 95, 103, and 107-120.\n\n[Here ends] the 'Emptiness' Section.\n\n[Here ends] the First Main Type of Good Thoughts.\n\nII.\n\n[146] Which are the states that are good?\nWhen a good thought concerning the sensuous universe has arisen by the prompting of a conscious motive,\\(^1\\) a\n\n\\(^1\\) Sasankh\u0101rena. Buddhaghosa's explanation of the term is terse and explicit. Sa=co-, sankh\u0101ro=compound, is here used in the sense of concomitant with spring, motive, means, or cause (uss\u0101ho, payogo, up\u0101yo, paccayo-gahanam). For instance, a bhikshu dwelling in the neighbourhood of a vih\u0101ra is inclined, when duty calls him to sweep the terrace round the st\u016bpa, wait on the elders, or listen to the Dhamma, to find the way too far, and shirk attendance. Second thoughts, as to the impropriety of not going, induce him to go. These are prompted either by his own conscience (attano v\u0101 payogena), or by the exhortation of another who, showing the disadvantage in shirking, and the profit in attending, says, 'Come, do it!' And the 'good thought,' i.e., of course, the resolve to go, is said 'to have arisen by way of a concomitant motive, by way of the taking hold of a cause.' Asl. 156.\n\nThis explanation is not discrepant with that of sasankh\u0101riko, given to Childers by Vijesinha Mudliar. He\nthought which is accompanied by pleasure, associated with knowledge, and having, as its object, a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch, a [mental] state, or what not, then there is contact, feeling, etc.\\(^1\\) [here follows the list of 'states' dealt with in \u00a7\u00a7 1-145 and constituting the First Thought]\u2014these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are good. . . .\n\n[Here ends] the Second Thought.\\(^2\\)\n\nIII.\n\n[147] Which are the states that are good?\n\nWhen a good thought concerning the sensuous universe has arisen accompanied by pleasure, disconnected with knowledge, and having as its object, a sight, a sound, a\n\nwas not, I take it, so bad a Buddhist as to mean that an asankh\u0101rika\u1e41 cittam was a thought in and for itself spontaneous, i.e., uncaused. He would mean only that the subject of the thought experienced it without being conscious of its mental antecedent as such, without paccaya-gahanam. In a cittam sasankh\u0101rena, on the other hand, the thought presents itself in consciousness together with its mental conditions. In the Abhidhamma-tha-Sangaha the terms used in a similar connexion are asankh\u0101rika\u1e41 and sasankh\u0101rika\u1e41. J. P. T. S., 1884, p. 1 et seq. Cf. Warren, 'Buddhism in Translations,' 490.\n\n\\(^1\\) In the text (\u00a7 146), at the omitted repetitions indicated by '... p e ...' reference is made to \u00a7 147. More correctly reference should be made to \u00a7 1. The second type-thought is in all respects (including Summary and 'Emptiness' Section) identical with the first (Asl. 156), with the sole exception of the additional implication 'by the prompting of a conscious motive.' With the same exception the fourth, sixth, and eighth type-thoughts are identical with the third, fifth, and seventh respectively. Hence the reference in \u00a7 159 of the text should have been to \u00a7 157.\n\n\\(^2\\) K. reads Dutiyam Cittam, and so on for the eight.\nsmell, a taste, a touch, a [mental] state, or what not, then there is\n\ncontact, conception,\nfeeling, discursive thought,\nperception, joy,\nthinking, ease,\nthought, self-collectedness;\nthe faculty of\nfaith, concentration,\nenergy, ideation,\nmindfulness, happiness,\nvitality;\nright intention,\\(^1\\) right mindfulness,\nright endeavour, right concentration;\nthe power of\nfaith, concentration,\nenergy, conscientiousness,\nmindfulness, the fear of blame;\nabsence of lust,\nabsence of hate,\nabsence of covetousness,\nabsence of malice;\nconscientiousness,\nfear of blame;\nserenity, wieldiness,\nbuoyancy, fitness,\nplasticity, rectitude,\nboth of sense and thought;\nmindfulness, grasp,\nquiet, balance.\n\n\\(^1\\) Samm\u0101ditthi should have been here omitted in the text, just as it is rightly omitted at the place of its second mention between avy\u0101p\u0101do and hiri. Its absence from the third type of thought is involved in the qualifying phrase 'disconnected with knowledge,' just as 'wisdom,' 'insight,' etc., are. Cf. K. In 147a the Path is said to be fourfold only.\nThese, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are good.\n\n[Summary, cf. \u00a7 58 et seq.]\n\n[147a] Now, on that occasion\nthe skandhas are four,\nthe spheres are two,\nthe elements are two,\nthe nutriments are three,\nthe faculties are seven,\\(^1\\)\nthe Jh\u0101na is fivefold,\nthe Path is fourfold,\nthe powers are six,\\(^2\\)\nthe causes are two,\\(^3\\)\ncontact, etc.\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 58.]\n\n* * * * * *\n\n[148] What on that occasion is the skandha of syntheses?\n\nThe content of the sansk\u0101ra-skandha is the same as in the First Type of Thought, \u00a7 62,\\(^4\\) with the following omissions:\n\n\u2018The faculty of wisdom,\u2019\n\u2018right views,\u2019\n\u2018the power of wisdom,\u2019\n\u2018the absence of dulness,\u2019\n\u2018intelligence,\u2019\n\u2018insight.\u2019\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) That of \u2018wisdom\u2019 being omitted.\n\\(^2\\) See preceding note.\n\\(^3\\) \u2018Absence of dulness\u2019 being omitted.\n\\(^4\\) In the text the reader is referred to \u00a7 62 without reservation, and is thereby landed in inconsistencies. K. enumerates the content of the skandha in full, omitting all those factors which are incompatible with a thought divorced from knowledge. I have thought it sufficient to name only these excluded factors.\nThese are omitted as incompatible with the quality 'disconnected with knowledge.'\n\nThese, or whatever other incorporeal, etc.\n\n[Here ends] the Third Type of Thought.\\(^1\\)\n\nIV.\n\n[149] Which are the states that are good?\n\nWhen a good thought concerning the sensuous universe has arisen by the prompting of a conscious motive, a thought which is accompanied by happiness, disconnected with knowledge, and having as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch, a [mental] state, or what not, then there is contact, etc. [continue as in \u00a7 147]\u2014these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are good. . . .\n\n[Here ends] the Fourth Thought.\n\n\\(^1\\) Placed erroneously in the text after \u00a7 147.\n\n\\(^2\\) So K. The text, by omitting not only the repetitions, but also the essentially distinctive factor sasankh\u0101rena, renders the insertion of the 'Fourth Thought' quite unintelligible.\n\nBuddhaghosa gives a different illustration of this type of thought in harmony with its resemblance to and difference from the former cittam sasankh\u0101rena, viz.: in its involving a pleasurable state of mind, but not any great understanding or discernment. Such is the thought of little boys, who, when their parents duck their heads to make them worship at a cetiya, willingly comply, though doing so without intelligent conviction.

(ibid.)\u2014from the objects of sensual desires, and from the desires themselves, respectively (vatthuk\u0101ma, kilesak\u0101ma. Childers' Dictionary, s.v. k\u0101mo). The former phrase (vivice' eva k\u0101mehi) includes the whole psychological realm of sense-presentation (k\u0101yo, or the three skandhas of feeling, perception and sanskaras); the latter, dhammehi, referring to the realm of ideation (cittam) only.\n\nThe Cy. repudiates the idea that the emphatic enclitic eva, occurring only in the former of the two phrases, renders the latter less important, and quotes, in support, the opening words of the C\u016bla-sihan\u0101da Discourse (M. i.63).\n\n\\(^4\\) Pathavikasinam.

Leaving the negative essential conditions of Jh\u0101na, we pass to the positive features (Asl. 166).

According as it is said in the Petaka (? Pe\u1e6d\u0101kopadesa), concentration opposes sensual desire; joy opposes malice; conception, or the onset of intellect, opposes stolidity and torpor; ease opposes excitement and worry; discursive thought opposes perplexity or doubt (Asl. 165). See D. i. 73, where the hindrances are explicitly mentioned in connection with Jh\u0101na; also the notes in Rhys Davids\u2019 \u2018Dialogues of the Buddha,\u2019 I., p. 84.\n\n\\(^4\\) I.e., joy of the fifth species, phara\u1e47a-piti (Asl. 166), \u00a7 9; also compare the passage just referred to, D. i. 73.

K. does not repeat the ... pe ... cited above at the corresponding point in the three remaining Jh\u0101nas, where the Summary is not elided, but given.

The substance of them is that the ceto (intellect, mind, heart), no longer overwhelmed or encumbered by vitakko and vic\u0101ro, rises up slowly pre-eminent (eko=settho or asah\u0101yo) in its meditative concentration, or sam\u0101dhi, this term being synonymous with ekodibh\u0101vam (Sam\u0101dhiss\u2019 etam adhivacanam). The discursive intellective of the First Jh\u0101na, troubling the ceto, as waves rendering water turgid, has in the Second Jh\u0101na sunk to rest. And this uplifting is said (the commentator emphasizes) of ceto, and not of an individual entity, nor of a living soul (na sattassa na jivassa). See Morris\u2019s note, J. P. T. S., 1885, p. 32.\n\n\\(^3\\) Samm\u0101sankappo is here, its usual order of place, omitted. It involves vitakko; see \u00a7 7.\n\n\\(^4\\) The reference in the text to \u00a7 157 cannot be right.

'Happiness' is the last of these to be transcended; the others have been expelled in the course of the previous stages of Jh\u0101na (Asl. 175, 176). But all four are here enumerated, as if all were only in this Fourth Jh\u0101na transcended, in order to show more clearly, by the method of exhaustive elimination, what is the subtle and elusive nature of that third species of feeling termed 'neutral' (adukkham-asukh\u0101), or 'disinterested' (upekkh\u0101)\u2014the zero point, or line, as we should say, of hedonic quantity.

The fivefold division is obtained by the successive, instead of simultaneous, elimination of vitakko and vic\u0101ro. According to the Cy., it was optional to the teacher, after the example of the Buddha, to use either at his discretion, adapting himself to the particular mental state of his pupils, or having a view to the effective flow of his discourse. A passage is quoted from the Pitakas\u2014probably S. iv. 363 or A. i. 299, n. 2 (cf. K. V. 413; Mil. 337)\u2014where sam\u0101dhi is distinguished as (1) having vitakko and vic\u0101ro, (2) having only the latter, (3) having neither.\nthe Jh\u0101na is fourfold,\nthe Path is fourfold,\netc., etc.\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 58.]\n\n* * * * *\n\n[169] What on that occasion is the skandha of syntheses?\nContact, thinking, discursive thought, joy, etc. . . .\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 162.]\n\n* * * * *\n\n[170-175] The Third, Fourth and Fifth Jh\u0101nas.\n[These are identical in formulation with the Second, Third and Fourth Jh\u0101nas of the Fourfold System.

The special stage of Jh\u0101na supervened after each act of self-control and intensified abstraction. In these processes there was an earlier and a subsequent stage called\u2014at least in the later books\u2014upac\u0101ra and appan\u0101 respectively. The effective cognition linking these two was an exercise of pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 which, in the text, is known as abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 ('intuition'), probably the intuitive or subconscious fetch of the mind to compass the desired appan\u0101, or conception. Now, whether the preparatory abstraction was easy or difficult, and whether the constructive generalizing effort was sluggish or vigorous, depended on the moral temperament and the mental ability\nWhich are the states that are good?\n\nWhen, that he may attain to the heavens of Form, he cultivates the way thereto, aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, and so, by earth-gazing, enters into and abides in the First Jh\u0101na . . . progress being painful and intuition sluggish\u2014then the contact . . . the balance that arises\u2014these . . . are states that are good.\n\n[177] . . .

See the double explanation in A. ii. 149-152, where the swiftness or sluggishness of intuition in both accounts depends on the acuteness or flabbiness of the five faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. The ease or difficulty in self-abstraction depends, in the first explanation, on whether the student is by nature passionate, malignant, dull, or the reverse of these three. In the second account progress is painful if he have filled his consciousness with the disciplinary concepts of the Foul Things (vide below, \u00a7 263), Disgust with the World, Impermanence and Death; easy if he simply work out the Four Jh\u0101nas.\n\nOn the varying import of abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (which occurs in no other connexion in the present work), see \u2018Dialogues of the Buddha,\u2019 i. 62.

The fact of the omission and the nature of the two omitted kasi\u1e47as are commented on by Buddhaghosa (Asl. 186). He explains the omission of the former by its being identical with the second of the four Aruppajh\u0101n\u0101ni given in \u00a7\u00a7 265-268, and that of the latter through its ambiguity. For either it amounts to the \u2018yellow\u2019 kasi\u1e47a (sun-lit space), or it amounts to the first Aruppajh\u0101na (\u00a7 265).

In the Suttanta the aesthetic aspect of the objects perceived is taken into account in all four stations, the specific difference replacing it in two of them being the conscious dwelling on some part of one\u2019s own bodily frame or r\u016bpaskandha. In the Dhammasangani this consciousness is excluded from all the stations. To teach by way of its inclusion and exclusion is called \u2018merely a jeu d\u2019esprit in the Master\u2019s discourse\u2019 (desan\u0101-vilasa-mattam eva).

The student, either because he has tried and failed, or because he did not wish to try, has not induced Jh\u0101na by way of fixing attention on his own hair or the rest.

And just as a man of vigorous digestion bolts a spoonful of rice, so the aspirant after sublime truth swiftly and easily transcends the initial act of external perception when the object is insignificant, and brings forth the desiderated concept (app\u0101n\u0101). The judgments by which he registers the consciousness of intellectual mastery have reference, according to Buddhaghosa, to past experience of enlightenment, and indicate simply a recognition, or, in terms of syllogism, a minor premise identified. But he states that, in the Sinhalese commentary on the Nik\u0101yas, they are interpreted as implying a present access of new light, a fresh moral attainment, gained after the thinker transcends perceptual consciousness (ibid.).\n[(d) The Two Objects of Thought.]\n\n[211-213] Repeat, substituting for 'earth-gazing' the Mastery-formula, \u00a7 181, where the Jh\u0101na 'is limited, and has a limited object of thought,' and \u00a7 183, where the Jh\u0101na 'is capable of infinite extension, but has a limited object of thought.'\n\n[(c = c and d) The Eightfold Combination (a\u1e6d\u1e6dhakkhattukam).]\n\n[214-221] Repeat, with the same substitution, \u00a7\u00a7 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 198, and 200 of the Sixteenfold Combination.\n\n[222] Repeat these eight combinations in the case of each of the remaining Jh\u0101nas.\n\n[2.

The term appam\u0101nam connoting merely a relative, not an absolute infinitude, there is only a difference of degree in the depth, purifying efficacy, or what not, of the Jh\u0101na attained to. The same illustrative figure is accordingly used, varied in degree. The gourmet, discontented with a small dish of rice, demands more and more. So the aspirant (now n\u0101nuttaro, not n\u0101nuttariko), aiming at perfect self-concentration, refuses to call that infinite which seems so (ibid.).\n\n2 So K.\n\n3 The general aesthetic designations of suvannam and dubbannam are in the Cy. paraphrased by parisuddham and its negative. Just as the limited nature of visible things was held to be an efficacious consideration for conceptual efforts, and the notion of 'infinite' helpful for dulness, so the beautiful and the ugly were prescribed for inimical conduct and for indulgence in passion respectively. The appropriateness of it all is said to be discussed in the Cariy\u0101-niddesa of the Visuddhi Magga (Asl. 189).\n(a) and (b)]\n\n[223] Which are the states that are good?\nWhen, that he may attain to the heavens of Form, he cultivates the way thereto, and, unconscious of any part of his corporeal self, but seeing external objects to be limited, and to be beautiful or ugly, gets the mastery over them with the thought, 'I know, I see!' and so, aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, enters into and abides in the First Jh\u0101na, etc. . . . then the contact, etc., that arises\u2014these . . . are states that are good.\n\n[224] Repeat in the case of each of the remaining Jh\u0101nas.\n\nDevelop in eightfold combination.\n\n[3. \u2018Forms as infinite\u2019 (r\u016bp\u0101ni appam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni).]\n\n(a) and (b)]\n\n[225] Which are the states that are good?\nWhen, that he may attain to the heavens of Form, he cultivates the way thereto, and, unconscious of any part of his corporeal self, but seeing external objects to be infinite, gets the mastery over them with the thought, 'I know, I see!' and so, aloof from sensuous appetites, etc.\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 204.]\n\n[226] Repeat in the case of each of the remaining Jh\u0101nas.\n\n[(c) The Four Modes of Progress.]\n\n[227-231] Repeat \u00a7\u00a7 206-210, substituting \u2018infinite\u2019 for \u2018limited.\u2019\n\n---\n\n1 See note on \u00a7\u00a7 211-213.

Like the latter term, nil\u0101m may originally have referred more to lustre than to tinge, meaning darkly lustrous, jetty, or nigrescent. Any way, it is not plausible to render the term by \u2018blue\u2019 when one is referred to human hair or bile (pitt\u0101m) as instances of it in the human body. See note 2 to \u00a7 248. In J\u0101t. iii. 138 hair-dye or hair-wash is called n\u012bliy\u0101m\u2014much, perhaps, as we speak of \u2018blacking\u2019 or \u2018russet polish\u2019 for shoes. This implies that the colour called nil\u0101m was, if not the usual, at least the desiderated colour of human hair.\n\nIf it were what we understand by a typical blue, the term would be applied to sky and sea, or the violet band of the rainbow, which is, I believe, never the case. Possibly our own colour-parallels in these respects are a modern development. Cf. Havelock Ellis in Contemporary Review, vol. lxix., p. 727.

Judging by the Cy. (190), this is equivalent to ajjhattam r\u016bpasa\u00f1\u00f1\u012b\u2014that is, to the opposite of the term \u2018unconscious of any part of his corporeal self,\u2019 the attitude prescribed in the Stations of Mastery, supra, \u00a7 204 et seq. The parikammam selected is \u2018one\u2019s own hair and the rest.\u2019 If a n\u012bla-parikammam is sought, attention is fixed on the hair or bile (pittam) or the pupil of the eye. If the induction is to be by way of yellow, fat or skin may be taken; if red, flesh, blood, or the tongue, or the palms of the hands or feet, etc.; if white, the teeth, nails, or white of the eye.

(191), not the conscious acquirement of the concept (appan\u0101), but the consciousness\nThese three Deliverances may also be developed in Sixteenfold Combination.\n\n[IV.\n\nThe Four Jh\u0101nas of the Sublime Abodes (catt\u0101ri brahmavih\u0101rajh\u0101n\u0101ni).1\n\n1.

(The reading should, of course, be subhan ti.) And this aesthetic consciousness is declared by Buddhaghosa to quicken the sense of emancipation from morally adverse conditions analogously to that perception of moral beauty which may be felt in the Sublime Abodes of the following sections. According to the Patissambhid\u0101-magga, here quoted, when, on pervading the whole world with heart of love, pity, etc., all feeling of aversion from living beings is rooted out, the student is struck with the glory of the idea, and works his deliverance.\n\n1 On these four great exercises, see Rhys Davids, S. B. E. xi. 201, n.; and on their emancipating efficacy, M. i. 38. Buddhaghosa again refers the reader to his Visuddhi Magga for a more detailed commentary (vide chap. ix., and cf. Hardy, 'Eastern Monachism,' p. 243 et seq.). The four are set out here only under the 'Suddhika' formul\u00e6\u2014that is, under heads (a) and (b). But (c), or the Modes of Progress, as well as (d) and (e), are understood to follow in each case (Asl. 192). The object of thought (\u0101rammanam) in this connexion will be 'limited' if the student dwells in love, etc., on but a restricted number of beings; 'infinite' if his heart embrace vast numbers.\n\nThe commentator has not a little to say in the present work, however, on the nature and mutual relations of the 'Abodes' (pp. 193-195). First, the characteristics of each\ncultivates the way thereto, and so, aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, enters into and abides in the First Jh\u0101na (the first rapt meditation), wherein conception\n\nare fully set forth, together with their false manifestation (vipatti). Clinging (sinehasambhavo) is the vipatti of love, the essential mark of which is the carrying on of beneficent conduct, etc. Tears and the like are less truly characteristic of pity than is the bearing and relieving the woes of others. Laughter and the like are less genuine expressions of sympathy (mudit\u0101, which is strictly \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd, Mitfreude) than is appreciation of what others have achieved. And there is a condition of disinterestedness (upekkh\u0101) which is prompted by ignorance, and not by that insight into the karma of mankind which can avail to calm the passions.\n\nHe next designates the four antisocial attitudes which are to be extirpated by these ethical disciplines, taken in order\u2014ill-will (vy\u0101p\u0101do), cruelty (vihes\u0101), aversion (arati), and passion (r\u0101go)\u2014and shows how each virtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he terms its near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its ethical opposite, the latter resembling an enemy who has to lurk afar in the jungle and the hills. Love and vengeful conduct cannot coexist. To prevail in this respect, let love be developed fearlessly. But where love and its object have too much in common, love is threatened by lust. On this side let love be guarded well. Again, the near enemy to pity, more insidious than cruelty, is the self-pity pining for what one has not got or has lost\u2014a low, profane melancholy. And the corresponding worldly happiness in what one has, or in consequence of obliviousness as to what one has lost, lies in wait to stifle appreciation of the good fortune of others. Lastly, there is the unintelligent indifference of the worldling who has not triumphed over limitations nor mastered cause and effect, being unable to transcend external things.\n\nThe remainder of his remarks are occupied with the necessary ethical sequence in the four Abodes, and the importance of observing method in their cultivation, and finally with their other technical appellation of Appama\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, or Infinitudes. In this connexion he repeats the touching illustration given in Hardy (op. cit., 249) of the\nworks and thought discursive, which is born of solitude, is full of joy and ease, and is accompanied by Love\u2014then the contact, etc. . . .

Her desire for the growth of the infant is as Mett\u0101; for the recovery of the sick child as Karu\u1e47\u0101; for the maintenance of the gifts displayed by the youth as Mudit\u0101; while her care not to hinder the career of her grown-up son is as Upekkh\u0101.\n\nIt may be remarked, by the way, that when Hardy, with a foreigner\u2019s want of mudit\u0101, calumniates the Buddhist mendicant (p. 250) as one who thinks about the virtues of solidarity without practising them, he quite forgets that these exercises are but preparations of the will for that ministering to the intellectual needs of others to which the recluse\u2019s life was largely devoted, and the importance of which the Western, in his zeal for material forms of charity, does not even now appreciate at its real value. And Buddhism did not believe in giving the rein to good impulses unregulated by intellectual control.\nthat is unbiassed and watchful dwelleth at ease\u201d\u2014and so, by earth-gazing, enters into and abides in the Third Jh\u0101na, which is accompanied by Love\u00b9\u2014then, etc.\n\n[Continue as in the foregoing.]\n\n(b) Fivefold Jh\u0101na.\n\n[254-257] Repeat question and answers in \u00a7\u00a7 167, 168, 170, 172, adding in each answer, as in the foregoing section, \u2018and which is accompanied by Love.\u2019\u00b2\n\n2.

For, in the words of the Cy. (p. 199), \u2018just as on a swiftly-flowing river a boat can only be steadied by the power of the rudder, so from the weakness (dubbalatt\u0101) of the idea (in this case) the mind can only be steadied in its abstraction by the power of conceptual activity (vitakko).\u2019 And this activity is dispensed with after the First Jh\u0101na.\n\n\u00b2 For a more detailed account of this peculiar form of moral discipline, the reader is again referred to the Visuddhi Magga (chap. vi.). Hardy (\u2018East. Mon.\u2019), who quotes largely from the Sinhalese commentary on the Visuddhi Magga, may also be consulted (p. 247 et seq.). In the Satipatth\u0101na Sutta (D. 22. Cf. Warren, \u2018Buddhism in Transla-\nThe Jh\u0101na of Foul Things may be developed in Sixteen Combinations.\n\n[Here ends the Chapter on] Good in relation to the Universe of Form.\n\ntion,' p. 358 et seq.; and M.I. 58) a system of nine Asubha-\nmeditations is set out in terms somewhat different. In\nS. v. (pp. 129-131) five of the Asubhas, beginning with 'the\nskeleton' meditation, are prescribed in connexion with the\nsambhojjhangas of mindfulness and disinterestedness.\nAnd the same five are given in the Jh\u0101na Vaggga of A. i. 42\n(cf. A. iii. 323). The ten here given are said in the Cy.\n(pp. 197-199) to be prescribed for such as were proved to be\npassionately affected by the beauty of the body\u2014of the figure,\nskin, odour, firmness or continuity, plumpness, limbs and\nextremities, symmetry, adornment, identifying self with the\nbody, or complacency in the possession of it (? k\u0101ye\nmamattam; cf. S. N. 951), and teeth respectively. A dead\nbody is not essential to this kind of mind-culture, the Cy.\nciting the cases of those Theras who obtained the requisite\nJh\u0101na by the glimpse of a person's teeth, or by the sight of\na r\u0101jah on his elephant. The essential procedure lay in\ngetting a clear and courageous grasp of the transience of\nany living organism.\n[Chapter III.\n\nGood in relation to the Universe of the Formless (ar\u016bp\u0101vacara-kusalam).\n\nThe Four Jh\u0101nas connected with Formless Existence (catt\u0101ri ar\u016bpajjh\u0101n\u0101ni).\u00b9\n\n1. The Sphere of Unbounded Space (\u0101k\u0101s\u0101na\u00f1c\u0101yatana\u1e41).\n\n[265] Which are the states that are good?\n\n\u00b9 These often appear in the Nik\u0101yas as the fourth to the seventh of the Eight Vimokhas or Deliverances (cf. \u00a7\u00a7 248-250; Mah\u0101 Par. Sutta, p. 30; A. iv. 306). Though treated of in the Visuddhi Magga (chap. iii.), Buddhaghosa only makes comparison with the account of them given in the Vibhanga. In S. iii. 237, and frequently in the Majjhima, they occur in immediate sequence to the four Jh\u0101nas without any collective title, and not as concomitants of the Fourth Jh\u0101na. There, too, the formul\u00e6 also have this slight variation from those in the present work, that the conscious attainment of each stage of abstraction is expressed by a brief proposition of identification, e.g., ananto \u0101k\u0101so ti . . . n'atthi ki\u00f1ci ti (It is boundless space! . . . There is nothing whatever!). The Cy. explains this by a curious quibble which is incidentally of interest (p. 204). It was the wish of the Buddha to carry out, as in previous procedure so in this, the study of the Four Objects of Thought [\u0101ramma\u1e47\u0101ni; see above, passim, under (d)]. And the first of these is that one's object is 'limited.' But if the student, in attaining to an undifferentiated consciousness of unbounded space, realize its nature by the, so to speak, exclamatory thought, 'It is boundless!' he cannot logically proceed to consider it as limited. If I interpret Buddha-\nWhen, that he may attain to the Formless heavens, he cultivates the way thereto, and so, by passing wholly beyond all consciousness of form, by the dying out of the consciousness of sensory reaction,\\(^1\\) by turning the attention from any consciousness of the manifold,\\(^2\\) he enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of unbounded space\u2014\n\nghosa aright, an interesting significance is hereby added to these parenthetical exclamations, which are not unfrequent in Buddhist philosophy. They seem to imply an act of conscious recognition.\n\n\\(^1\\) The student is to withdraw all interest in and attention to the world of \\(r\u016bpa\\), to cease so entirely to differentiate the plenum of external phenomena (including his own form) which impinge on his senses, that sensations cease, or resolve themselves into a homogeneous sense of extended vacuum. \\(Pa\u1e6digho\\), rendered by sensory reaction, is explained to be sight-perception, sound-perception, smell, taste, and touch-perception. \u2018Thought is (here) not sustained by way of the five doors\u2019 (Asl. 201, 202). Hardest of all was it to abstract all attention from sounds. \u0100\u1e37ara K\u0101l\u0101ma, one of Gotama\u2019s teachers, and proficient in these rapt states, at least so far as the sixth Vimokha (M. i. 164), was credited with the power of becoming so absorbed that he failed to see or hear hundreds of carts passing near him (Asl. 202). On the psycho-physiological use of patigho, see the theory of sense in the book on form, infra, \u00a7 597 et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) N\u0101nattasa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam amanasik\u0101ra. On the latter term, see above, p. 5, n. 1. N\u0101nattam is of rare occurrence in the Nik\u0101yas; but see M. i. 3, where, in a series of concepts, it follows \u2018unity\u2019 and precedes \u2018the whole\u2019 (Neumann renders by Vielheit); also S. iv. 113, 114, where it is explained to refer to the various kinds of sensation, the corresponding vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101na, and the resulting feeling. In the Vibhanga, quoted by Buddhaghosa (p. 202), it is explained to mean cognition of the mutual diversity or dissimilarity (a\u00f1\u00f1ama\u00f1\u00f1\u0101m asadis\u0101) of nature in the eight kinds of good thoughts, the twelve bad thoughts (below, \u00a7 365), as well as in those ideas of good and bad results which are taken next to these. For citt\u0101ni, however, sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 is substituted, possibly limiting the application of the discernment of diversity to the sensuous basis\neven the Fourth Jh\u0101na, to gain which all sense of ease must have been put away, and all sense of ill must have been put away, and there must have been a dying out of the happiness and misery he was wont to feel\u2014(the rapt meditation) which is imbued with disinterestedness, and where no ease is felt nor any ill, but only the perfect purity that comes of mindfulness and disinterestedness\u2014then the contact, etc. . . .

On the next stage, too (\u00a7 267), no light at all is thrown (p. 206).\n\n\\(^2\\) Buddhaghosa explains this mental state as the cultivation of the functioning of the subtle residuum of conscious\nThe Four Jh\u0101nas connected with Formless Existence may be developed in sixteen combinations.\n\nsyntheses (sankh\u0101r\u0101vasesa-sukhumabh\u0101vam). In so far as perception (presumably understood as being wholly introspective) has become incapable of effective functioning (patu-sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101-kiccam), the state is non-perceptual. In so far as those faint, fine conscious reactions are maintained, the state is 'not non-perceptual.' This oscillation about a zero-point in consciousness is illustrated by the similes quoted (not from this Cy.) by Hardy (op. cit., 264), namely, of the bowl containing just so much oil as suffices for cleansing purposes, but not to be poured out; also, of the little pool, sufficient to wet the feet, but too shallow for a bathe. Both oil and water exist, or do not exist, according to what action can be taken with respect to them. The Cy. adds that this liminal point obtains not only in sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, but also in feeling, thought, and contact (208). The study of the 'threshold' of consciousness, and of the supra- and sub-liminal grades clustering about it, is familiar enough to the investigator in psychophysics. What is unfamiliar to us is the exploitation of the borderland of consciousness in the interests of ethical growth. Leibnitz might have found in the neva-sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101-n\u0101sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101yatanam, had he had opportunity, the inspiration for his theory of petites perceptions.\n[Chapter IV.\n\nDegrees of Efficacy in Good relating to the Three Realms.\n\n1.

So I gather, at least, from the comment on this curious section (pp. 211, 212): '\u201cinferior\u201d (h\u012bnam) must be understood to mean paltry in respect of heaping up.' 'Heaping up' is in later books almost always associated with karma. Meaning to toil, more specifically to dig up, pile up, it is used to express the metaphorical notion of ever accumulating merit or demerit constituting the individual's potentiality in the way of rebirth. Cf. Mil. 109; also below, \u00a7 1059, n. 9, on \u2018she who toils.\u2019 The Pat\u1e6dh\u0101na may throw more light on the subject (Asl., ibid.).\n[another] thought, or investigation;\u00b9\n\nor the dominant influence in which is\ndesire of inferior,\nof medium, or\nof superlative efficacy;\n\nor the dominant influence in which is\nenergy of inferior,\nof medium, or\nof superlative efficacy;\n\nor the dominant influence in which is\n[another] thought of inferior,\nof medium, or\nof superlative efficacy;\n\n\u00b9 An explanation is also needed, it seems to me, for this association of the Four Iddhip\u0101das (M. i. 103; A. iii. 82; S. v. 264-266) with this special aspect of karma; for they lead to Arahatship rather than to rebirth in some other plane. The Cy. only states that when anyone, in the act of accumulating, relinquishes desire or the rest, \u2018that\u2019 is called inferior [in efficacy]; that when these four states are moderately or superlatively efficacious they are called accordingly; and that \u2018when anyone has accumulated, having made desire (chando), i.e., the wishing-to-do, his sovereign, chief and leader,\u2019 then the procedure is said to be under the dominant influence of desire. So for the other three.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the Cy. does not discuss the term vim\u0101\u1e47s\u0101 (investigation), or the propriety of its position in this series of four. It would be interesting to have learnt its psychological import in relation to vitakko and vic\u0101ro. There is a suggestion of dual symmetry about the series: as chando is to viriyam (conation passing into action), so is cittam (the idea) to the discursive re-representative intellective of vim\u0101\u1e47s\u0101. I have rendered citt\u0101dhipateyyam by the influence of another thought in accordance with the Cy.

K. V., pp. 620, 458)\u2014and by the text itself as niyy\u0101nikam apacayag\u0101mim.

And the latter term: This is not like that heaping together and multiplying of rebirth effected by the good which belongs to the three worlds of being. This is even as a man who, having heaped up a stockade eighteen cubits high, should afterwards take a great hammer and set to work to pull down and demolish his work. For so it, too, sets about pulling down and demolishing that potency for rebirth heaped up by the three-world-good, by bringing about a deficiency in the causes thereof.\n\n\\(^1\\) Dit\u1e6dhi-gat\u0101ni, lit. resorting to views.

Of the three \u2018riddles\u2019 there discussed\u2014\u2018the empty, the aimless and the signless\u2019\u2014only the first two are here prescribed for cultivation. Buddhaghosa argues on the subject at some length (Asl. 221-225). He explains that the three terms are so many names for the way to the Ideal (lokuttara-maggo), each throwing a special aspect of it into greater relief than the other two, while yet no advance can be made without all three concepts. The advent of the Path as a conscious ideal is especially characterized by insight into the fact that the sansk\u0101ras are void of a permanent soul, and of all that conduces to happiness. The virtue or quality of the Path, again, is wholly empty of lust, hate and dulness. So also is its object, namely, Nirvana. But the chief import of \u2018empty\u2019 is said to relate to the fact first named\u2014the nonentity of any substratum or soul in anything. The \u2018aimless\u2019 applies chiefly to the insight into dukkham, or the nature of pain or ill. All aspiration or hankering after sansk\u0101ras withers up under the penetration of such insight. By it, too, the path of the Ideal becomes revealed. The third \u2018riddle,\u2019 the \u2018signless\u2019\u2014i.e., the path conceived as free from the three signs or false tenets of Permanence, Sorrow and Soul\u2014comes up for meditation later (\u00a7\u00a7 506, 511, etc.).\n(c) The Modes of Progress, with 'Emptiness' as the Basis (su\u1e47\u1e47ata-m\u016blaka-pa\u1e6dipad\u0101).\n\n[346] Which are the states that are good?\nWhen he cultivates the Jh\u0101na of the Higher Ideal . . .\nand when, that he may attain to the First Stage, he . . .\nenters into and abides in the First Jh\u0101na . . . progress thereto being difficult and intuition sluggish, the method being the concept of Emptiness\u2014then the contact . . .\nthe balance that arises\u2014these . . . are states that are good.\n\n[347-349] Repeat the same formula, substituting in succession the three remaining Modes of Progress (\u00a7\u00a7 176-179), with the addition in each case of the phrase 'the method being the concept of Emptiness.'\n\n[350] Repeat the same formula, substituting in succession the remaining Jh\u0101nas on the Fourfold System and those on the Fivefold System, and applying in each case the Four Modes of Progress, with the additional phrase on 'Emptiness.'\n\n(ii.)

Ignorance (= dulness) is only really conquered in the Fourth Path. The diminution is described (Asl. 238) as coming to pass in two ways: vicious dispositions arise occasionally and no longer habitually, and when they do arise it is with an attenuated intensity.

There being for bad thoughts no other sphere of existence save the sensuous universe, this is to be understood throughout (Asl. 247).\n\n\u00b2 Ditthigata-sampayutta\u1e41.

If the mind be undistracted, says Buddhaghosa, the murderer's knife does not miss, the theft does not miscarry, and by a mind of single intent (lit., of one taste) evil conduct is carried out (Asl. 248). Cf. the Hebrew idiom rendered by 'the heart being set'\u2014to do good or evil (Eccles. viii. 11; Ps. lxxviii. 8).\n\n\u00b3 Hate (dos\u014d) and malice (vy\u0101p\u0101do) do not find a place among the factors of Bad Thoughts (corresponding to the place occupied by their opposites in the Good Thoughts, \u00a7 1) till we come to the last four types of bad thoughts. Whereas these are accompanied by melancholy (domanassam), the subject of the first and the following three types of thought is a cheerful sinner. Joy, ease, happiness, were held to be incompatible with hate.\nquiet,\ngrasp,\\(^1\\)\nbalance.\n\nNow, these\u2014or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states that there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are bad.\\(^2\\)\n\n[366-370] What on that occasion is contact . . . feeling . . . perception . . . thinking . . . thought?\n\nAnswers as in \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 respectively.\n\n[371] What on that occasion is conception?\n\nAnswer as in \u00a7 7, substituting \u2018wrong intention\u2019 (micch\u0101sankappo) for \u2018right intention.\u2019\n\n[372-374] What on that occasion is discursive thought . . . joy . . . ease?\n\nAnswers as in \u00a7\u00a7 8-10 respectively.\n\n[375] What on that occasion is self-collectedness?\n\nAnswer as in \u00a7 11, substituting \u2018wrong concentration\u2019 for \u2018right concentration.\u2019\n\n[376] What on that occasion is the faculty of energy?\n\nAnswer as in \u00a7 13, substituting \u2018wrong endeavour\u2019 for \u2018right endeavour.\u2019\n\n[377] What on that occasion is the faculty of concentration?\n\nAnswer as in \u00a7 375.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vipassan\u0101 (insight) has been erroneously included in the text. Moral insight was as incompatible with immoral thoughts to the Buddhist as it was to Socrates and Plato. Hence also \u2018wisdom\u2019 and \u2018mindfulness\u2019 are excluded, as well as \u2018faith.\u2019 The Cy. rules that the followers of heretical dogmas and mere opinion can have but a spurious faith in their teachers, can only be mindful of bad thoughts, and can only cultivate deceit and delusion. Nor can there possibly be that sixfold efficiency of sense and thought which is concomitant with good thoughts (\u00a7\u00a7 40-51). Asl. 249.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kusal\u0101 in the text is, of course, a slip. There are in all these Bad Thoughts ten \u2018whatever-other\u2019 states: desire, resolve, attention, conceit, envy (iss\u0101, or read icch\u0101, longing), meanness, stolidity, torpor, excitement, worry (Asl. 250).

(p. 248) as ay\u0101th\u0101vadassanam, seeing things as they are not. (On ditthi, see \u00a7 1003, n.) Sixty-two kinds of this perverted vision, or ill-grounded speculation are distinguished in the Brahmaj\u0101la Sutta (D. i.), all of them being theories of existence, and are alluded to by the commentator (p. 252).

It is clear, therefore, that the '... pe ...' after thiti in the text is a mistake. And cf. K. 'Concentration,' it will be noticed, as well as 'quiet' and 'balance,' are entirely omitted.\nWhat on that occasion is perplexity (vicikicch\u0101)?\u00b9\n\nThe doubt, the hesitating, the dubiety, which on that\n\n\u00b9 It is tempting to render vicikicch\u0101 by \u2018doubt.\u2019 It would not be incorrect to do so. The dual state of mind which is the etymological basis of doubt is shown in two of the terms selected to describe the word. Again, the objects of vicikicch\u0101, as given in \u00a7 1004, are those to which the term \u2018doubt,\u2019 in its ethico-religious sense, might well be applied. But there are features in which the Buddhist attitude of vicikicch\u0101 does not coincide with doubt as usually understood in the West. Doubt is the contrary of belief, confidence, or faith. Now, the approximate equivalents of the latter\u2014saddh\u0101 and pas\u0101do\u2014are not alluded to in the answer, as they might be, for the purpose of contrast. Again, though this by itself is also no adequate ground for not matching the two terms in question, the etymology of the words is very different. There is nothing of the dual, divided state of mind in the structure of vicikicch\u0101 as there is in that of \u2018doubt.\u2019 Cikit is the desiderative or frequentative of cit, to think; vi, the prefix, indicating either intensive or distracted thinking. Thus, the etymology of the Indian word lays stress on the dynamic rather than the static, on the stress of intellect rather than the suspense of inconclusiveness. When the term recurs (\u00a7 1004), Buddhaghosa refers it to kiccho\u2014to \u2018the fatigue incurred through inability to come to a decision\u2019\u2014a position nearer, psychologically, to \u2018perplexity\u2019 than to \u2018doubt.\u2019 It is quite true that, on etymological ground, neither is kankh\u0101 a match for our term \u2018doubt.\u2019 K\u0101nks is to desire. The word would seem to give the emotional and volitional complement of the intellectual state implied in vicikicch\u0101, the longing to escape into certainty and decision attendant on the anxious thinking. Kankh\u0101, however, is not one of any important category of ethical terms, as is vicikicch\u0101; besides, its secondary meaning\u2014namely, of a matter sub judice, or of the state of mind connected therewith (see J\u0101t. i. 165; M. i. 147)\u2014seems to have superseded the primary meaning, which is retained in \u0101kankhati (cf. Akan-kheyya Sutta, M. i. 33). Hence, it can be fairly well rendered by \u2018doubt.\u2019 I do not, then, pretend that \u2018per-\noccasion is puzzlement,\\(^1\\) perplexity; distraction, standing at cross-roads;\\(^2\\) collapse,\\(^3\\) uncertainty of grasp; evasion, hesitation;\\(^4\\) incapacity of grasping thoroughly;\\(^5\\) stiffness of mind;\\(^6\\) mental scarifying\\(^7\\)\u2014this is the perplexity that there then is.\n\nplexity' is etymologically the equivalent of vicikicch\u0101, but I use it (1) to guard against a too facile assimilation of the latter to the implications of 'doubt' as used by us, and (2) to throw emphasis on the 'mortal coil' and tangle of thought in one who, on whatever grounds, is sceptically disposed.\n\n\\(^1\\) Vimati, almost an exact parallel to vicikicch\u0101, connoting as it does either intense or distraught mind-action.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dvelhakam, dvedh\u0101patho. Here we get to the etymological idea in our own 'doubt.' The Cy. has, for the one, 'to be swayed or shaken to and fro'; for the other, 'as a path branching in two, this being an obstacle to attainment' (259).\n\n\\(^3\\) Samsayo, the etymological equivalent of 'collapse.'

According to the Cy., these mean, respectively, 'to relinquish' (or slip down from\u2014osakkati; cf. Trenckner's 'Miscellany,' p. 60) 'an object of thought through inability to come to a decision,' and 'to slip' (or run\u2014sappati [\\textit{vide} sarpi]) 'about on all sides from inability to plunge in.'

(Asl. 260), were it not that the latter paraphrases the term by saying 'the meaning is a condition of denseness (or rigidity, thaddho). For when perplexity arises, one makes one's mind stiff (stubborn, dense, thaddham).' K. also reads thambhitattam.

It seems clear that, whether or no uddhaccam can elsewhere be rendered by terms indicative of a puffed-up state of mind (see Rhys Davids, 'Buddhism,' p. 109; Warren, 'Buddhism in Translations,' p.365; Neumann, 'Die Reden,' etc., I., passim), the specific meaning in this connexion (Tattha katamam uddhaccam) is the antithesis of v\u016bpasamo, and the equivalent of vikkhepo,\nNow, at that time\nthe skandhas are four,\netc.,\nthe faculties are five,\n\nboth of which are expressions about the meaning of which there is little or no uncertainty. In Sanskrit uddhatya is only found twice in later works, one of them Buddhist (v. B\u00f6thl. and Roth., s.v.), and there means wrestling, a word used by ourselves for certain agitated, perfervid mental states. That the term should be yoked with kukkuccam (worry) in the Nivaranas (see \u00a7\u00a7 1158-1160; and cf. the cognate meaning in another allied pair, thinamiddham, \u00a7\u00a7 1155-1157) goes far to rob it of implications of vanity or self-righteousness. (In \u2018Dialogues of the Buddha,\u2019 i. 82, the former pair are rendered \u2018flurry and worry.\u2019) Buddhaghosa gives little help; but he distinguishes uddhaccam, as a struggling over one object of thought (ek\u0101rammane vipphandati), from perplexity as a struggling over divers objects of thought. The Buddhists were apparently seeking for terms to describe a state of mind antithetical to that conveyed by the designation thinamiddham\u2014stolidity and torpor. In the latter there is excessive stability\u2014the immobility not of a finely-adjusted balance of faculties and values, but of an inert mass. In the former (uddhacca-kukkuccam) there is a want of equilibrium and adjustment. From some cause or another the individual is stirred up, agitated, fussed; in American idiom, \u2018rattled.\u2019\n\nWhat I have rendered \u2018turmoil\u2019 (bhantattam; more literally, wavering, rolling, staggering) Buddhaghosa calls vibhanti-bh\u0101vo (sic lege), bhantay\u0101na-bhantagon\u0101dinam viya (Asl. 260).\n\nWhatever the exact meaning of uddhaccam may be, there is enough to show that it is in great part antithetical to some of the other constituents enumerated under the Bad Thought in question\u2014at least, when these are taken in their full intention. I refer to the approximately synonymous group: \u2018self-collectedness,\u2019 \u2018concentration,\u2019 \u2018quiet\u2019 and \u2018balance.\u2019 The last, indeed (avikkhepo), is a contradiction in terms to the phrase which describes uddhaccam as cetaso vikkhepo! The text actually omits it, but this is through mere inadvertence (cf. \u00a7 430).\nthe Jh\u0101na is fourfold,\nthe Path is threefold,\nthe powers are four,\nthe cause is one,\netc.\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 58.]\n\nIt is given in K., and the Cy. explicitly states (p. 260) that there are twenty-eight constituents enumerated, fourteen of them being described in terms of one or other of the other fourteen. (If the reader will compare \u00a7 427 with the corresponding descriptions given in \u00a7\u00a7 2-57, he will prove this to be correct.) Nor is there a word to comment on, or explain away any apparent incongruity in the inclusion. There is only a short discussion, alluded to already, on the relation of uddhaccan and vicikicch\u0101. Thoughts XI. and XII., as departing from the symmetrical procedure of I. to IX., are said to be miscellaneous items, and to be concerned with persistent attending to the idea (\u0101ramma\u1e47e pavattanaka-citt\u0101ni). And just as, if a round gem and a tetragonal gem be sent rolling down an inclined plane, the former\u2019s motion is uniform, while that of the latter is from one position of rest to another, so vicikicch\u0101 connotes a continual working of thought, while uddhaccan works on one given basis at a time.\n\nThere being, then, as it would appear, this fairly close analogy between \u2018perplexity\u2019 and \u2018excitement,\u2019 it is fair to assume that \u2018self-collectedness\u2019 and its synonyms are to be understood in Thought XII., as present in the feeble degree to which they, or at least the first of them, is present in Thought XI. (see \u00a7 424, n.). The compilers were thus between two fires as to their logic. Either avikkhepo must go to admit of the use of vikkhepo\u2014in which case the synonyms of avikkhepo (sam\u0101dhi, etc.) must go too\u2014or it and its synonyms must be retained with a highly attenuated import. Possibly the subject was conceived as agitated on some one point only, but calm as to things in general.\nWhat on that occasion is the skandha of syntheses?\n\nContact,\nthinking,\nconception,\ndiscursive thought,\nself-collectedness;\nthe faculties of\nenergy,\nconcentration,\nvitality;\nwrong intention,\nwrong endeavour,\nwrong concentration;\nthe powers of\nenergy,\nconcentration,\nunconscientiousness,\ndisregard of blame;\nexcitement;\ndulness;\nunconscientiousness,\ndisregard of blame,\nquiet,\ngrasp,\nbalance.\n\nOr whatever other, etc.\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 62.]\n\n* * * * * *\n\n[Here end] the Twelve Bad Thoughts.\nPART III.\u2014INDETERMINATE STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nOn Effect, or Result (vip\u0101ko).\n\nA.

(262), are not included in the summary; and why? Jh\u0101na at its extremity has conception (vitakko), and the Path at its extremity has cause (hetu). Hence, it is not consistent to include Jh\u0101na in a thought that has no conceptual activity, or the Path, when the thought is not causally effective.\n\nThis remark throws a little light on to the problem of indeterminate states. In vitakko the mind is working towards an end good or bad; in the Path the first factor (right views) is synonymous with \u2018absence of dulness,\u2019 which is the cause or root of good (\u00a7 1054). Neither vitakko nor amoho is, therefore, a possible constituent in a cognition which is inefficacious to produce good or bad karma.\nthe faculty of ideation counts as a single factor,\nthe element of visual cognition counts as a single factor,\nthe sphere of [mental] states counts as a single factor,\netc.\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 58.]\n\n* * * * *\n\n[442] What on that occasion is the skandha of syn-\ntheses?\n\nContact,\nthinking,\nself-collectedness,\nthe faculty of vitality,\nor whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there\nare on that occasion, exclusive of the skandhas of feeling,\nperception and intellect\u2014these are the skandha of syn-\ntheses.\n\n* * * * *\n\n(ii.-v.)

The view that the cognition of something tangible has a positive hedonic concomitant\u2014pleasant or, if the karma be bad (\\$ 556), unpleasant\u2014as compared with the neutral feeling attending other kinds of sense-cognition (under the given circumstances), is of psychological interest. And the comment it evokes is not less so. Touch, or body-sensibility, is, the Cy. explains (263), the one sense through which the four elements without and within the individual come into direct contact. Other cognition is secondary, inasmuch as the other senses are derived (up\u0101d\u0101). They are as balls of cotton-wool on four anvils, deadening the impact of the hammer. In touch the wool is beaten through, and the reaction is stronger. Cf. this with the theory of sense below, \u00a7\u00a7 596-632. Nevertheless, the ease or the distress is so faintly marked, that the cognition remains 'indeterminate.'\n\nThe constituent states, contact, etc., refer only to the last-named species of cognition. In the case of the other four 'disinterestedness' would have to be substituted for 'ease.'\n\n\\(^2\\) Vedan\u0101 has dropped out of the printed text.\nis born of contact with the body; the pleasurable, easeful feeling which is born of contact with the body\u2014this is the feeling that there then is.\n\n[446] What on that occasion is perception?\n\nThe perception, the perceiving, the state of having perceived, which on that occasion is born of contact with appropriate element of the cognition of body\u2014this is the perception that there then is.\n\n[447] What on that occasion is thinking?\n\nThe thinking, the cogitating, the reflection, which on that occasion is born of contact with the appropriate element of the cognition of body\u2014this is the thinking that there then is.\n\n[448] What on that occasion is thought?\n\nThe thought which on that occasion is ideation, mind, heart, that which is clear; ideation as the sphere of mind, the faculty of ideation, intellect, the skandha of intellect, the appropriate element of the cognition of body\u2014this is the thought that there then is.\n\n[449] What on that occasion is ease?\n\nThe bodily pleasure, the bodily ease which on that occasion is the pleasant, easeful sensation born of contact with the body; the pleasant, easeful feeling born of contact with the body\u2014this is the ease that there then is.\n\n[450-453] What on that occasion is self-collectedness\u00b9... the faculty of ideation\u00b2... of ease... of vitality?\n\nAnswers as in \u00a7\u00a7 438, 448, 449 and 441 respectively.\n\nOr whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are indeterminate.\n\n\u00b9 In \u00a7 450 omit... pe... in the text after thiti.\n\u00b2 In \u00a7 451 supply k\u0101ya- before vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47adh\u0101tu.

Cf. above, p. 33, n. The characteristics of mano are here set out. See Introduction (Theory of Intellection). The theory of a sensorium commune here alluded to is practically identical with that adopted by Aristotle in the 'De Sensu.' 'The basis (or site, vatthu) of this kind of thought is a constant, namely, the heart; the objects of the \"doors\" (or of the idea-door) are not constants.

As a resultant state, it is here said (Asl. 264), when \u2018accompanied by happiness,\u2019 to eventuate in two sets of circumstances: \u2018Standing in the doors of the five senses, it accomplishes the task (or function, kiccam) of deciding (santirana) as to that idea (or percept) which the element of ideation, just expired, received on the expiry of that sense-cognition which constituted the result of good karma.\u2019 Again: \u2018When the action of the six doors (senses and ideation) results in a more impressive idea, this becomes what is called the idea\u2019 (tad-\u0101rammanam), i.e., \u2018the object of the impulse\u2019 (javanam), and the element of representative cognition is drawn away to fix itself on that object. So a vessel crossing a strong current avails to turn the latter aside for a moment, though its natural course is a flowing downward. The normal flow of the intellect is, so to speak, down the stream of the individual life (bhavangam ev\u2019 otarati). And it is this normal functioning of the intellect which alone is here taken into account.\n\nThe further stage of cognition immediately preceding any outgoing or conative impulse such as seems to be meant by the word javanam (cf. Sum. 194; Abh. S. iii. 3)\u2014I allude to that of \u2018establishing\u2019 (or full assimilation, as we might say\u2014votthappanam)\u2014is not here explicitly mentioned. But it is probably implied in the phrase santiran\u0101di, \u2018deciding and the rest.\u2019 And it is discussed a few pages further on (Asl. 269, 272).\na sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible, the idea [of any of these], or what not, then there is\n\ncontact, conception,\nfeeling, discursive thought,\nperception, joy,\nthinking, ease,\nthought, self-collectedness;\n\nthe faculties of\n\nideation,\nhappiness,\nvitality.\n\nThese, or whatever other, etc.\n\n[Continue as in \u00a7 455.]\n\n[470-482] These thirteen constituent states are described as in \u00a7\u00a7 2-11 and 17-19, with the exception of 'conception' (vitakko) and 'self-collectedness' (cittass' ekagat\u0101), which are described with the restricted connotation used in \u00a7\u00a7 461, 464.\n\n[Summary.]\n\n[482a] Identical with \u00a7 467a, but 'the element of representative cognition' (manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nadh\u0101tu) must be substituted for 'the element of ideation.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n[483] What on that occasion is the skandha of syntheses?\n\nContact, discursive thought,\nthinking, joy,\nconception, self-collectedness;\n\nthe faculty of vitality.\n\nOr whatever incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion, exclusive of the skandhas of feeling,\n\n1 The reference to [58] in the text is again incorrect, for there is to be no rehearsal of either Jh\u0101na or Path.

The conception of infirm offspring, viz., blind, deaf, imbecile or insane, hermaphrodite or neuter; (ii.) during the span of one individual lifetime (bhavangam); (iii.) in the decision (santir\u0101nam) respecting an idea where the object causes neither pleasure nor pain; (iv.) when the \u2018that-object\u2019 (tad\u0101rammanam) of absorbing impressiveness arises (cf. \u00a7 469, n.); (v.) when death opens the way to renewed existence (cuti). It will be seen that these five correspond to the first, second, tenth, thirteenth and fourteenth occasion on which vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47as occur, according to the Visuddhi Magga (chap. xiv.; see Warren\u2019s \u2018Table of Contents,\u2019 J. P. T. S., 1891-93, p. 130). It is possible that the absence of explanatory matter in our Cy. is due to the existence of a full treatment by Buddhaghosa in the former earlier work.\nThese thirteen states are described as in the foregoing section (i.), except that the questions and answers on 'feeling' and 'disinterestedness,' as given in \u00a7\u00a7 152-154, must be substituted for those on 'feeling,' 'joy,' and the 'faculty of happiness' given in \u00a7\u00a7 471, 477, and 481.

The later form is kriy\u0101-cittam (see Abh. S., p. 2 et seq.; Bastian\u2019s \u2018Buddhistische Psychologie,\u2019 Anhang). Kiriya is discussed in my Introduction. The Cy. has the following on the term: \u2018Kiriya here means simply doing (karana-mattam). In all kiriya-thoughts those in which the stage of javanam is attained are like wind-blown blossoms, but those in which that stage is not attained are like blossoms where the tree has been felled, barren of fruit. But when this or that is kept going in the performance of function, then there is \u201cdoing\u201d pure and simple. Hence the term kiriya is used.\u2019 Now, javanam, according to Buddhaghosa (Sum. I., 195), is the effective outcome of an act of cognition, the stage when the mind or character of the percipient subject is modified (ethically) in one way or another. But in the species of indeterminate thoughts termed kiriya there can be no practical outcome for good or bad, no karma can be set free. Hence the simile of the sterile blossoms. The Abh. S. gives also three species of non-causative kriy\u0101-thoughts as connected with the sensuous universe\u2014reflection on sense-impressions, reflection on ideas, and the genesis of mirth (hasitupp\u0101da-cittam). These correspond fairly well to the three given in the Dh. S., if the two modes of representative intellect be taken in inverted order.\nhas arisen,\\(^1\\) which is neither good nor bad nor the result of karma, which is accompanied by disinterestedness, and which has as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible, or what not, then there is\n\ncontact, thought,\nfeeling, conception,\nperception, discursive thought,\nthinking, disinterestedness,\n\nself-collectedness;\\(^2\\)\n\nthe faculties of:\nideation,\ndisinterestedness,\nvitality.\n\nNow these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are indeterminate.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\n[Summary.]\n\n[566a] Now, at that time\nthe skandhas are four,\n\n\\(^1\\) According to the Cy., the ideation which is kiriy\u0101 differs from the ideation which is result only in the mode of its arising (upatti\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101nam). The latter arises immediately after the act of sense-cognition. The former arises while sensation is actually proceeding, while the organism is being turned towards the object (Asl. 294). Again (ibid.), that the thought is \u2018neither good nor bad\u2019 means the absence of that cause of good or of bad which is termed the root of the one or of the other; it means the absence of those conditions of good or of bad which are termed considering things by way of their causes (yoniso-manasik\u0101r\u0101), or not so considering them. \u2018Nor the result of karma\u2019 means the absence of the generative cause (jana-kahetu), known as good or bad (as the case may be).

(p. 294) pronounces this species of thought not common to men, but peculiar to the arahat. \u2018It is obtained in the six doors,\u2019 e.g., when an arahat sees a spot (th\u0101nam) favourable to one of those prescribed spiritual wrestlings termed padh\u0101n\u0101ni [sic lege; cf. below, \u00a7 1366, (v.)], \u2018by this thought he is gladdened.\u2019 When he comes to a market-place, \u2018hears the uproar of the bargaining, and thinks, \u201cI have done with all this thirst for gain,\u201d by this thought he is gladdened. When he has made an offering of fragrant odours or flowers at the shrine, by this thought he is gladdened. When he is tasting the food he has received as ordained, and thinks, \u201cVerily I have carried out the doctrine incumbent upon me,\u201d by this thought he is gladdened. When he is carrying out minor rules concerning the body, and thinks, \u201cI have fulfilled the rules concerning the door of the body,\u201d by this thought he is gladdened. Such is this kind of intellection when obtained in connexion with the \u201cfivefold door.\u201d In connexion with the door of ideation, it arises with reference to the\nand which has as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible, or what not, then there is\n\ncontact, conception,\nfeeling, discursive thought,\nperception, joy,\nthinking, ease,\nthought, self-collectedness;\nthe faculties of ideation,\nenergy, happiness,\nconcentration, vitality.\n\nNow these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion\u2014these are states that are indeterminate.\n\n[569] Question and answer on 'contact' as above passim.\n\n[570] What on that occasion is self-collectedness?\nThe stability, solidity, absorbed steadfastness of thought which on that occasion is the absence of distraction, balance, imperturbed mental procedure, quiet, the faculty and the power of concentration\\(^1\\)\u2014this is the self-collectedness that there then is.\n\n[571] What on that occasion is the faculty of energy . . .\n[572] of concentration?\n\nAnswers as in \u00a7 13 and \u00a7 570 respectively.\n\npast and the future.'

The Cy. (p. 295) explains that 'concentration' and 'energy' are not present in full strength.

It includes two other species: Form (or External Phenomena) and Nirv\u0101\u1e47a (Uncompounded Element). (Asl. 296.) Hence it is that the following inquiry into 'Form' as objective and subjective phenomenon is led up to by a question connecting it with the foregoing inquiry into the genesis of 'thought,' which is presented from the point of view of a-rupino dhamma, or formless (incorporeal) states of consciousness.\n\n\u00b2 Apariy\u0101pann\u0101. This term, which is often employed in Book III., and which is intended to convey a sense of the 'apartness' of the pursuit of the Highest from all lower aims, is dealt with below (\u00a7 992).\n\n\u00b3 I follow, here as often elsewhere, the punctuation of K. In this identical answer later on, however, K. is self-inconsistent, placing a colon before, and a comma after, the enumeration of the skandhas. See \u00a7 983. One or the other is probably an inadvertency.\nand [finally] Uncompounded Element\\(^1\\)\u2014these are states that are indeterminate.\n\n[584] In this connexion what is \u2018all form\u2019 (sabbam r\u016bpam)?\n\nThe four great phenomena\\(^2\\) and that form which is derived from the four great phenomena\u2014this is what is called \u2018all form.\u2019\\(^3\\)\n\n[584-594] Here follows the M\u0101tik\u0101, or table of contents of the following analysis of Form, considered under quantitative categories\u2014the usual Buddhist method. That is to say, Form is considered, first, under a number of single, uncorrelated qualities, then under dichotomized qualities, then under\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Asankhat\u0101 ca dh\u0101tu. This term, which both Buddhaghosa and the original Atthakath\u0101 (see \u00a7 1,376 in printed text of Dh. S.) identify with Nirv\u0101na, occurs often in this connexion with its opposite \u2018all form\u2019 (v. p. 168, n. 3) in Book III. I do not know whether this, so to speak, cosmological conception of the Ethical Ideal occurs in the older books of the Pitakas, or whether, indeed, the commentators have not laid upon the physical term more than it was intended to bear\u2014a connotation that derives perhaps from the \u2018scholastic\u2019 ages of Buddhism. For example, in \u00a7\u00a7 1016-1018 of the present work, to identify uncompounded element with Nirv\u0101na, just after it has been opposed to the \u2018topmost fruit of arahatship,\u2019 would apparently land the compilers in a grave inconsistency. I have yet to meet with a passage in the first two Pitakas which establishes the identification. In the Milinda-pa\u00f1ho, giving the traditional doctrine of an age half-way between Pitakas and Commentaries, we can see the theory of Nirv\u0101na as the one asankhatam developing. See pp. 268 seq. Cf. also K.

We then get pairs of qualities taken together, affording four combinations.

'For, strictly speaking, with reference to  \nvisual and other sense-cognition, they (read na hi t\u0101ni)  \ndo not cognize the past and future; that is the function of  \nrepresentative cognition (manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47am)' (Asl. 304).\nimpermanent,\\(^1\\)\nsubject to decay.\n\nSuch is the category of Form considered by way of single attributes.\\(^2\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Aniccam, 'inasmuch as, having fallen into this stream of sense-cognition it ('form') has become mere flotsam, has become something gone, something that is not' (ibid.). This shows well the idealist or psychological standpoint of the Buddhist tradition. Form is impermanent for the individual perceptive consciousness.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Cy. gives as the reason for there being no catechism on each of the foregoing attributes the fact that there is no correlated opposite, as in the next category, from which each term is to be differentiated (Asl. 303). This, in view of the procedure in Book I., is scarcely adequate. However, every term is examined in the sequel, as the foregoing notes will have indicated.\n[Chapter II.\n\nThe Category of Form considered by way of dual attributes\u2014positive and negative (duvidhena r\u016bpasangaho).\n\n'There is form which is derived.']\n\n[596] What is that form which is derived?\nThe sphere of\nvision, smell,\nhearing, taste,\nbody-sensibility;3\nthe sphere of\nsights, odours,\nsounds, tastes;\nthe faculties of\nfemininity, masculinity,\nvitality;\n\n1 This and the following italicised headings are quoted from the table of contents, \u00a7 585, etc.\u2014atthi r\u016bpam up\u0101d\u0101, and again, athi r\u016bpam no up\u0101d\u0101.

'Eye,' however, is always in the present work to be understood as the seeing faculty or visual sense, and not as the physical organ or 'eye of flesh' (mamsa-cakkhu). The Cy. gives an account of the eye, of which the following is the substance: First the aggregate organism (sasambh\u0101ra-cakkhu). A ball of flesh fixed in a cavity, bound by the socket-bone beneath and by the bone of the eyebrow above, by the angles of the eye at the sides, by the brain within and by the eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents: the four elements, the six attributes dependent on them, viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of life, form (sa\u1e45th\u0101nam), and collocation (sambhavo); vitality, nature, body-sensibility (k\u0101yappasa\u1e45do) and the visual sentient organ. The last four have their source in karma. When 'the world,' seeing an obvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye, it only perceives the basis (or seat \u2014vatthu) of the eye. And this ball of flesh, bound to the brain by nerve-fibres, is white, black and red, and contains the solid, the liquid, the lambent and the gaseous. It is white by superfluity of humour, black by superfluity of bile, red by superfluity of blood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by superfluity of the liquid, inflamed by\n\n\\(^2\\) See note on p. 174.\nthe Great Phenomena, forming part of the nature of the self,\\(^1\\) invisible and reacting\\(^2\\)\u2014by which eye, invisible and\n\nsuperfluity of the lambent, quivering by superfluity of the gaseous. But that sentient organ (pas\u0101do) which is there bound, inherent, derived from the four great principles\u2014this is the visual sense (pas\u0101dacakkhu). Placed in the midst and in the front of the black disc of the composite eye, the white disc surrounding it (note that the iris is either not distinguished or is itself the 'black disc') and in the circle of vision, in the region where the forms of adjacent bodies come to appear (there seems here some omission in the text), it permeates the seven ocular membranes as sprinkled oil will permeate seven cotton wicks. And so it stands, aided by the four elements, sustaining, binding, maturing, moving (samudir\u0101nam)\u2014like an infant prince and his four nurses, feeding, bathing, dressing and fanning him\u2014maintained by nutriment both physical (utu) and mental, protected by the (normal) span of life, invested with colour, smell, taste and so forth, in size the measure of a louse's head\u2014stands duly constituting itself the door of the seat of visual cognitions, etc.\n\nFor as it has been said by the Commander of the Doctrine (S\u0101riputta):\n\nThe visual sense by which he beholds forms\nIs small and delicate, comparable to a louse's head.\n\nThe elaborate architectonics of this paragraph in the original is a fine effort of the Commentator's style. I am not clear to what the 'etc.' after 'cognitions' alludes. But the expression occurs in the description of each sense. Cf. the description in Hardy, 'Man. of Buddhism,' p. 419.\n\n\\(^3\\) Pas\u0101do. By selecting this term, continues the Cy., he (the Buddha) rejects the other (physical) eye. So far as I know, the as yet unidentified verses quoted in the previous note are the only early instance of the word pas\u0101do, meaning literally clearness, brightness, serenity, faith, being used to denote the receptive reacting sense-agency. It is not easy to divine exactly how the Buddhists came to use the word in this connexion. It is used co-ordinately for all the other senses, hence the sensuous signification had nothing to do with the specific nature of sight (unless this was\n\n\\(^1\\) See note \\(^1\\) on p. 175. \\(^2\\) See note \\(^2\\) on p. 175.\nreacting, one has seen, sees, will, or may see form that is visible and impingeing\u2014this that is sight, the sphere of sight, the element of vision, the faculty of vision, this that is \u2018a world,\u2019 \u2018a door,\u2019 \u2018an ocean,\u2019 \u2018lucent,\u2019 \u2018a field,\u2019 \u2018a\n\nmade the Type of all other sensation). Taken causatively it may conceivably have meant either that which makes clear\u2014a revealer, as it were (cf. B\u00f6thl. and Roth\u2014pras\u0101dana), or that which gratifies or satisfies (Beruhigen), both meanings emphasizing psychological process, rather than \u2018product\u2019 or \u2018seat.\u2019\n\n1 Attabh\u0101va-pariy\u0101panno. \u2018The body and the five skandhas are here termed nature of the self, after the usage of foolish folk who say, \u201cThis is myself\u201d\u2019 (Asl. 308). Thus the usage of attabh\u0101vo was a concession on the part of the Great Teacher to animistic phraseology.\n\n2 I.e., impact and reaction are set up in the eye\u2019 (ibid.).\n\n3 Paraphrased by aya\u1e47 satto, any given individual (ibid.).\n\n4 This and the following similes will be quotations of metaphors applied to the senses in the Sutta Pitaka. E.g., that of the \u2018empty village\u2019 occurs in S. iv. 174\u2014Su\u00f1\u00f1o gamo ti kho, bhikkhave, channam ajjhattik\u0101nam [? \u0101yatan\u0101nam] adhivacanam. That of a \u2018door,\u2019 which in the age of the Commentaries was the regular term for sense-organ, is, I believe, seldom used in the Sutta Pitaka, and then only as a poetical figure, not as a technical term. Cf., e.g., indriyesuguttadv\u0101ro (D I., 63, 250). Buddhaghosa simply paraphrases the various metaphors\u2014\u2018world,\u2019 by reason of wasting and decay; \u2018door,\u2019 by reason of customary resort; \u2018ocean,\u2019 by reason of its insatiableness; \u2018lucent,\u2019 by reason of its purity; \u2018field,\u2019 by reason of the springing up (growth) of contact, etc.; \u2018base,\u2019 by reason of its fixed seat; \u2018guide,\u2019 \u2018guidance,\u2019 by reason of its leading the nature-of-the-self showing agreements and differences; \u2018hither shore,\u2019 by reason of its being included in the \u2018body of this life\u2019 (or individuality, sakk\u0101ya\u1e47); \u2018empty village,\u2019 because it is common to many, because there is no headman (i.e., Ego or soul. \u2018Many\u2019 must mean the individual considered as an aggregate of constituents.) The metaphors, it will be seen, are applied equally, with the sole exception of \u2018guide\u2019 and \u2018guidance,\u2019 to each remaining sense. By the explanation of these two figures given in the Cy., they should have been\nbasis,' 'a guide,' 'guidance,' the 'hither shore,' an 'empty village'\u2014this is that form which constitutes the sphere of vision.\n\n[598] What is that form which is the sphere of vision?\n\nThe eye, that is to say the sentient organ, derived from the four Great Phenomena, forming part of the nature of the self, invisible and reacting, and against which eye, invisible and reacting, form that is visible and impingeing, has impinged,\\(^1\\) impinges, will, or may impinge\u2014this that is sight, the sphere of sight, the constituent element of sight, etc. [continue as in \u00a7 597].\n\n[599] What is that form which is the sphere of vision?\n\nThe eye, that is to say the sentient organ, derived from the four Great Phenomena, forming part of the nature of the self, invisible and reacting, which eye, invisible and reacting, has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge on form\\(^2\\) that is visible and impingeing\u2014this that is sight, the sphere of sight, etc. [continue as in \u00a7 597].\n\n[600] What is that form which is the sphere of vision?\n\nThe eye, that is to say the sentient organ, derived from the four Great Phenomena, forming part of the nature of the self, invisible and reacting, (i.) depending on which eye, in consequence of some visible form,\\(^3\\) there has arisen, arises, will, or may arise\n\nvisual contact;\\(^4\\) . . .\n\nleft to stand for each sense.

Thinking (cetan\u0101) may stand for a train of ideas set going by the sensation having no special reference to the visible object as such. Visual cognition, on the other hand, would take special account of the thing seen. Or possibly the two are to be considered as corresponding approximately to process and product.

With the exception of this quality of relatively undifferentiated organ, the sense is co-ordinate with the other senses. To the objection that, if the sensitive surface be indeed so general it would convey confused impressions, it is counter-asserted that, if it were not so general, tactile impressions could not be adequately differentiated. Strictly speaking the body-sense is both everywhere and not everywhere. Not everywhere to the extent of being in things as seen or as tasted. We cannot segregate and analyze sensations as we can grains of sand, and hence qualities are said to coalesce in the object. Nevertheless each mode of sense conveys its specific messages.\u2014Such seems to me the substance of what I have clothed to a slight extent in terms of Western psychology.

That of the sun is 50 yojanas, is made of gold and roofed with crystal. The constellations, the mansions of different gods, are 7, 8, or 10 yojanas in extent, and are made of the seven jewels.

I confess I do not see what is gained by shifting cakkhum niss\u0101ya, so that by K.'s reading it is sandwiched between adjective and noun, beyond the symmetry in these sense-object answers, of giving precedence everywhere to the object. But this does not invalidate the reading in K. \u0100ramma\u1e47am is a term of mental procedure, not of bare sense-function, such as is indicated by the relation of r\u016bpa\u1e41 : cakkhu.\nand, having which visible form as its object, and depending on the eye, there has arisen, arises, will, or may arise\n\na feeling . . .\n[or] a perception . . .\n[or] thinking . . .\n[or] visual cognition . . .\n\nthis which is visible form, the sphere, the constituent element of visible form\u2014this is that form which is the sphere of visible form.\n\n[621] What is that form which is the sphere of sound?\n\nThat sound which is derived from the four Great Phenomena, is invisible and produces impact, such as the sound of drums, of tabors, of chank-shells, of tom-toms, of singing, of music;\u00b9 clashing sounds,\u00b2 manual sounds,\u00b3 the noise of people,\u2074 the sound of the concussion of substances,\u2075 of wind,\u2076 of water,\u2077 sounds human and other than human, or whatever other sound\u2078 there is, derived from the Great Phenomena, invisible and producing impact\u2014such a sound, invisible and producing impact, as, by the ear, invisible and reacting, one has heard, hears, will, or may hear . . .\n\n[622] . . . and on which sound, invisible and producing impact, the ear, invisible and reacting, has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge . . .\n\n[623] . . . which sound, invisible and producing impact,\n\n\u00b9 I.e., the sound of lutes and other stringed instruments (Asl. 319).\n\u00b2 E.g., of gongs and castanets (ibid.).\n\u00b3 I.e., of hand-clapping (ibid.).\n\u2074 I.e., of a crowd when words and syllables have become indistinguishable (ibid.).\n\u2075 I.e., of trees rubbing against each other, or of the knocking of blocks (ibid.).

He predicates the same of good and bad tastes (s\u0101du, as\u0101du, \u00a7 629). In \u00a7 648 we find, classed among the tangibles, pleasant contact and painful contact. But we do not find the commentator making the same comprehensive claim for hedonistic values in touches as in odours and tastes. Nor, as we have seen, does the text predicate anything hedonistically of sight or touch. This is interesting as bringing the psychology of Buddhism, with its acute if incipient intuition, in \u2018touch\u2019 with our modern\nwhatever other odour there is, derived from the four Great Phenomena, invisible and producing impact; such an odour, invisible and producing impact, as one has smelt, smells, will, or may smell with the nose, that is invisible and impingeing...\n\n[626]...on which odour, invisible and producing impact, the nose, invisible and impingeing, has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge...\n\n[627]...such an odour, invisible and producing impact, as has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge on the nose, invisible and reacting...\n\n[628]...in consequence of which odour and depending on the nose, there has arisen, arises, will, or may arise olfactory contact...\n\nand\u00b9...born of that olfactory contact,\n\na feeling...\n\n[or] a perception...\n\n[or] thinking...\n\n[or] olfactory cognition...\n\n...[further] having an odour as its object and depending on the nose, there has arisen, arises, will, or may arise olfactory contact,\n\n...and...born of that olfactory contact,\n\na feeling...\n\n[or] a perception...\n\n[or] thinking...\n\n[or] olfactory cognition;\n\npsychology. For we say that the more our knowledge of the external world is built up by a given sense, the more is that sense connected with neutral feeling. And it is precisely sight, touch, and hearing that give us most of that knowledge.\n\nAristotle remarks, with reference to the sense of smell only, that our never discriminating an odour without associating therewith an impression of something painful or pleasant, seems to reveal the imperfection of this sense in humans. Imperfect, i.e., in delicacy of discrimination, touch being herein the most perfect sense (De. An. II. ix.).\n\n\u00b9 See \u00a7 624, note.\nthis that is odour, the sphere and constituent element of odour\u2014this is that form which is the sphere of odours.\n\n[629] What is that form which is the sphere of taste?\n\nThat taste which is derived from the four Great Phenomena, is invisible and produces impact, such as the taste of roots, stems, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, of sour, sweet,\\(^1\\) bitter,\\(^2\\) pungent,\\(^3\\) saline,\\(^4\\) alkaline,\\(^5\\) acrid,\\(^6\\) astringent,\\(^7\\) nice and nauseous sapids,\\(^8\\) or whatever other taste there is, derived from the four Great Phenomena, invisible and producing impact\u2014such tastes, invisible and producing impact, as with the tongue, invisible and reacting, one has tasted, tastes, will, or may taste...\n\n[630] . . . against which taste, invisible and producing impact, the tongue, invisible and impingeing, has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge...\n\n[631] . . . a taste which, invisible and producing impact, has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge on the tongue, invisible and reacting...\n\n[632] . . . in consequence of which taste and depending on the tongue, there has arisen, arises, will, or may arise gustatory contact...\n\n\\(^1\\) Buttermilk (takkambilam) is given as a typical sour sapid, ghee from cow's milk (gosappi) as the type of a sweet sapid. But, adds the Cy., sweet added to astringent (kas\u0101vam) and kept standing will lose all its sweetness, and so with raw sugar and alkaline substance. Ghee, however, kept standing, while it loses colour and smell, does not lose its taste. It therefore is the absolute sweet (ekanta-madhuram) (Asl. 320).\n\n\\(^2\\) E.g., as nimb-tree fruit (ibid.).\n\n\\(^3\\) E.g., as ginger and pepper (ibid.).\n\n\\(^4\\) E.g., as sea-salt (ibid.).\n\n\\(^5\\) E.g., as the egg-plant (v\u0101tinganakatiram), or as green palm sprouts (coconut cabbage) (ibid.).\n\n\\(^6\\) E.g., as the jujube, or the Feronia elephantum, etc. (ibid.).\n\n\\(^7\\) E.g., as the yellow myrobalan (haritakam).

Under 'appearance,' which the Cy. (321) rules to be here the import of lingam (=santh\u0101nam, cf. Mil. 133, 134), he indicates the physical proportions in which the woman, generally speaking, differs from the man\u2014smaller hands, feet, and face, upper trunk less broad, lower trunk broader. Characteristics (nimittam) are that by which she is recognisable (sanj\u0101nanam), both external bodily marks (no beard, e.g., nor tusks, which would seem to include certain animals) and modes of dressing. Under 'occupation' (kuttam=kiriy\u0101) there is an allusion to girls' distinctive amusements\u2014playing with baskets, pestles [and mortars], and dolls (? literally, little daughters, dhitalik\u0101ya kilanti), and spinning thread with a mattikav\u0101kam, whatever that may be. Under 'deportment,' the 'absence of breadth' (avisa-\nWhat is that form which is masculinity (purisindriyam)?\n\nThat which is of the male, masculine in appearance, masculine in characteristics, in occupation, in deportment, masculine in condition and being\u2014this is that form which constitutes masculinity.\n\nIn women's walking, standing, sitting, lying, and eating is specified, all these being done more mincingly, less assertively by women. If a man so deport himself, it is said of him, 'He goes like a woman!' The 'condition and being' of the female, constituting her essential nature, are 'born of karma, and take their source at conception.' The other female characteristics are evolved by her 'potentiality' in the course of existence, just as the tree with all its appurtenances is evolved in time from the seed. This 'indriyam' is discernible, not by the eye, but by the mind (mano). It is an abstract idea. And it is not to the one sex just what the faculties of sight and so forth are to the other.\n\nThe priority of place given to the female is a form of statement as characteristically Buddhist (not to say Indian) as that of saying 'moon and sun.' Both no doubt have their source very deep in the history, or prehistory, of humanity. The Commentator gives the correlative opposites in describing male characteristics, down to the 'swash-buckling and martial air,' which if a woman affect she is said to 'go like a man.' Boys are said to occupy themselves with their characteristic games of playing at carriages and ploughs, and at making sand-banks round puddles and calling them reservoirs.\n\nHe then remarks that these sexual distinctions have been evolved during the course of life in primeval ages; since when, originating by way of conception and, some of them, in the individual life, it happens that they get interchanged. He then quotes cases of hermaphroditism, said to have occurred in the members of the Order.\n\nHe is mindful also, as we might expect, to appreciate the sex to which he belongs, and makes a curious application to it of the doctrine of karma. 'Of the two, the male sex-marks are superior (uttamam), those of the female inferior (hinam). Therefore the former disappear by means of a very bad karma, while the latter are established\n[635] What is that form which is vitality (j\u012bvitindriyam)?\n\nThe persistence of these corporeal states, their subsistence, their going on, their being kept going on, their progress, continuance, preservation, life, life as faculty\u2014this is that form which is vitality.\\(^1\\)\n\n[636] What is that form which is bodily intimation (k\u0101yavi\u00f1\u00f1att\u012b)?\n\nThat tension, that intentness, that state of making the body\\(^2\\) tense, in response to a thought, whether good, bad, or indeterminate, on the part of one who advances, or recedes, or fixes the gaze, or glances around, or retracts an arm, or stretches it forth\u2014the intimation, the making known, the state of having made known\u2014this is that form which constitutes bodily intimation.\\(^3\\)\n\nby a karma indifferently good. The latter, on the other hand, disappear by means of a karma indifferently bad, while the former are established by means of a very good karma. \u2018Thus, both disappear by badness and are acquired by goodness.\u2019\n\nThus, our Commentator approximates more to Plato\u2019s position than to that of the typical religious celibate, finding woman not stronger to do evil, but rather the weaker in heaping up either good or evil.\n\n\\(^1\\) What there is to say, has been said already in connexion with the faculty of vitality as related to incorporeal (formless) states\u2019 (Asl. 323. See \u00a7 19).\n\n\\(^2\\) K\u0101yo is said to = sariram; possibly to distinguish it from k\u0101yo as used for \u2018body-sensibility,\u2019 or the tactile sense (Asl. 324), or again from sense-experience generally (p. 43, n. 3).\n\n\\(^3\\) K\u0101yavi\u00f1\u00f1att\u012b is analyzed in a somewhat rambling style by the Commentator. The gist of his remarks amounts, I gather, to the following: In any communication effected by bodily action\u2014which includes communications from animals to men, and vice versa\u2014that which is made known is one\u2019s condition (bh\u0101vo) at the time, one\u2019s self (sayam), and one\u2019s intention (adhipp\u0101yo); in other words, the how, the who or what, and the what for. And this is wrought by a bodily suffusion (vipphandanena).\n\nHe then classifies the kinds of thoughts which tend to\n[637] What is that form which is intimation by language (vac\u012bvi\u00f1\u00f1att\u012b)?\nThat speech, voice, enunciation, utterance, noise, making noises, language as articulate speech, which expresses a thought whether good, bad, or indeterminate\u2014this is called language. And that intimation, that making known, the state of having made known by language\u2014this is that form which constitutes intimation by language.\\(^1\\)\n\n[638] What is that form which is the element of space (\u0101k\u0101sa-dh\u0101tu)?\nThat which is space and belongs to space, is sky and\n\n\u2018produce an intimation,\u2019 no others having this tendency. They are\u2014\n\nThe eight good thoughts relating to the sensuous universe (\u00a7\u00a7 1-159), and\nthe thought concerning intuition (abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 cittam).\nThe twelve bad thoughts (\u00a7\u00a7 365-430).\nThe eight great kiriya-thoughts,\nthe two limited kiriya-thoughts,\nthe one kiriya-thought relating to the universe of form which has attained to intuition,\nmaking eleven indeterminate thoughts.\n\nFinally he refers us to his theory of \u2018Doors\u2019 (dv\u0101rakath\u0101). See my Introduction. (Asl. 323-4.)\n\n\\(^1\\) Vac\u012bvi\u00f1\u00f1att\u012b is dealt with verbatim as bodily intimation was, \u2018vocal noise\u2019 being substituted for \u2018bodily suffusion.\u2019 \u2018Making noises\u2019 is to be understood as making a noise in a variety of ways. \u2018Articulate speech\u2019 (lit., broken-up speech) is no mere jangle (bhango), but is vocal utterance so divided as to serve for communication (Asl. 325).\n\nIt is interesting to note in connexion with the problem as to whether communication or registration of thought is the historically prior function of language, that Buddhaghosa, for all his aptness to draw distinctions, does not make any allusion here to intimation by language forming only one of the functions of speech.\n\nStill more curious, as being more germane to this specific aspect of language, is it that he does not take into account the oral communication of the registered ideas of the race.\nbelongs to sky,\\(^1\\) is vacuum and belongs to vacuum, and is not in contact\\(^2\\) with the four Great Phenomena\u2014this is that form which is the element of space.\n\n[639] What is that form which is lightness of form (r\u016bpassa lahut\u0101)?\\(^3\\)\n\nThat lightness of form which is its capacity for changing easily, its freedom from sluggishness and inertia\u2014this is that form which is lightness of form.\n\n[640] What is that form which is plasticity of form?\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Buddhaghosa\u2019s etymology (Asl. 325) derives \u0101k\u0101so from \u2018unploughed\u2019\u2014what may not be ploughed, cut, or broken\u2014which recalls Homcr\u2019s \u1f00\u03c4\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f34\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1 and \u1f00\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 as well as the \u1f00\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 of Euripides (Asl. 326). \u2018Sky\u2019 he connects with striking\u2014a gh\u0101m, a-ghattan\u012byam\u2014what is not strikable.\n\n\u0100k\u0101so, he continues, is that which delimitates, or sets bounds to forms, environing them and making them manifest. Through it, in forms thus bounded, we get the notions\u2014hence above, hence below, hence across.\n\n\\(^2\\) Asamphuttham cat\u016bhi mahabh\u016btehi. Although space is in this work treated of apart from the four elements, and does not, as a rule, count as a fifth element, in the Pitakas, yet, in the Mah\u0101 R\u0101hulov\u0101da Sutta (M. i. 428), when Gotama is discoursing to his son of the distribution of the elements in the composition of the human body, he co-ordinates \u0101k\u0101sadha\u1e6du with the four other dhatus, to all appearance as though it should rank as a fifth element. In the older Upanishads it is usually coordinated with the four elements, though not, as such, in a closed list. In the Taittir\u012bya Up., however, it appears as the one immediate derivative from the \u0100tman; wind, fire, water, earth, plants, etc., proceeding, the first from \u0101k\u0101\u00e7a, the rest, taken in order, from each other.\n\nThe word asamphuttham is paraphrased by nijjata-kam (or nissatam), and may mean that space does not commingle with the four elements as they with each other.\n\n\u2018Belongs to\u2019 is, in the Pali, -gata\u1e41.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. above, \u00a7\u00a7 42-47, with this and the two following answers. Supremely well-dressed hide is given as an illustration of the plasticity of matter (Asl. 326).\nThat plasticity of form which is its softness, smoothness, non-rigidity\u2014this is that form which is plasticity of form.\n\n[641] What is that form which is wieldiness of form?\n\nThat wieldiness of form which is its serviceableness, its workable condition\u2014this is that form which is wieldiness of form.\\(^1\\)\n\n[642] What is that form which is the integration (upacayo) of form?\n\nThat which is accumulation of form is the integration of form\\(^2\\)\u2014this is that form which is the integration of form.\n\n[643] What is that form which is the subsistence of form (r\u016bpassa santati)?\n\nThat which is integration of form is the subsistence of form.

This is only adopted by the text in \u00a7\u00a7 732, 733. K. reads so and s\u0101.\n\nThis and the following section formularize the coming into being of things. Integration is paraphrased (Asl. 327) as the cumulative effect of the spheres (\u0101yatan\u0101nam \u0101cayo) as they are reproduced over and over again. The import of the term is vaddhi, fulness of growth. \u0100cayo, or nibbatti, is to upacayo or vaddhi as the welling up of water in a reservoir by a river\u2019s bank is to the brimming over of the water, while santati or pavatti (subsistence or persistence) is as the overflow and running of the water. All are expressions for the phenomenon of birth and growth (j\u0101tr\u016bpassa).\n\n\\(^3\\) This is a stock formula, and occurs at M. i. 49; S. ii. 2, and 42. The Cy. points out (Asl. 328) that the three terms,\nWhat is that form which is the impermanence of form (r\u016bpassa aniccat\u0101)?\n\nThe destruction, disease, breaking-up, dissolution of form, the impermanence which is decline\u2014this is that form which is the impermanence of form.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhat is that form which is bodily (solid) nutriment (kabalinkaro \u0101h\u0101ro)?\\(^2\\)\n\nBoiled rice, sour gruel, flour, fish, flesh, milk, curds, butter, cheese, tila-oil, cane-syrup, or whatever else\\(^3\\) there is in whatever region that by living beings may be eaten, chewed, swallowed, digested into the juice\\(^4\\) by which living\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This and the preceding section formularize the waning and passing away of things. Birth-and-growth, decay and death are by the Commentator likened to three enemies of mankind, the first of whom leads him astray into a pit, the second of whom throws him down, the third of whom cuts off his head (Asl. 329).\n\n\\(^2\\) Literally, morsel-made food. \u2018Bodily\u2019 (or solid) suffices to distinguish it from the three immaterial nutrients. See p. 30.\n\n\\(^3\\) Under these come roots and fruits. Asl. 330.\n\n\\(^4\\) On this section, where \u2018form\u2019 is considered under the aspect of sustaining growth, etc., the Commentator gives a brief dissertation where an adumbration of physiological truth is humorously illustrated. Whereas, he says (Asl. 330-332), food is here first set out in terms of its embodiment, in oj\u0101 we have the evolved essence of it. Now whereas the former removes risk, the latter is a preservative. And the risk is this, that when no food is taken, the karma-born heat within feeds on the walls of the belly, making the owner cry out, \u2018I am hungry; give me something to eat!\u2019 and only setting his intestines free when it can get external food. The internal heat is likened to a shadow-demon who, having got the entry into a man\u2019s shadow, bites his head when hungry so that he cries out.\nbeings are kept alive\u2014this is that form which is bodily nutriment.\n\n[All] this is form which is derived.\n\n[End of] the Section on Derivatives.

Living beings are then classified in an order of increasing fineness in the food they live on, beginning with crocodiles, who, they say, swallow pebbles, continuing with peacocks, hyenas, and elephants, later with other birds, then with borderers, town-dwellers, kings, and ending with the Y\u0101ma and Paranimitavasavatti gods, who enjoy food of supreme delicacy.\n\n\u00b9 'Just as derived form is derived in such and such a way and in no other, so, to say it is not derived, is equivalent to saying it is not derivable.' Asl. 333.\n\nPossibly the form of negative here employed (no up\u0101d\u0101) is a technical mark of the relatively unethical nature of this aspect of r\u016bpam. Anup\u0101d\u0101, on the other hand, is used with a philosophical import. Cf. D. i. 17 with M. i. 148\u2014anup\u0101d\u0101 vimutto and anup\u0101d\u0101 parinibb\u0101nattham. See also below, \u00a7\u00a7 1210 and 1213.\n\n\u00b2 In keeping with the general psychological standpoint of the present work, the things which are not derived from (have no foothold or support in) other things are considered\nsoft; the smooth and the rough; pleasant (easeful) contact, painful contact; the heavy and the light\u2014such a tangible, invisible and producing impact, as, with the\n\nunder the aspect of sense-percepts. They are tangibles or intangibles. Element (dh\u0101tu) is now substituted for the collective term used above, namely, great phenomena or beings (mah\u0101bh\u016bt\u0101ni, \u00a7 584 et seq.). Both terms occur together in A. i. 222. The latter term may be used to denote great or wondrous derivatives of the four elements, great either physically or ethically, as when (Vin. ii. 240) the ocean and its 'great creatures' serve to illustrate the Dhamma and those wondrous phenomena, the human beings who by way of it are seeking or have attained Nirv\u0101na. Dh\u0101tu, on the other hand, as the Cy. with unflagging 'mindfulness' once more points out, indicates absence of substratum or soul. Asl. 332.\n\nOn the essential characters of the four elements, see below, \u00a7\u00a7 962-965, also the following note.\n\n1 The first two and last of these four pairs are so many aspects or modes of the earth-element (Asl. 332), and are paraphrased respectively as rigid and non-rigid, polished and jagged (saw-like), weighty and non-weighty. These correspond almost exactly to our modern view of the modes of resistance, i.e., of active touch, or of skin-sensibility with a co-efficient of muscular sense. The Buddhist view lacks, as all but recent psychology has lacked, insight into the presence of the muscular factor; on the other hand, it is logically more symmetrical in giving 'lightness' where Dr. Bain, e.g., gives 'pressure'\u2014another positive.\n\nPleasant contact is defined as a tangible which is desired on account of pleasant feeling; the opposite, in the case of painful contact. Each of the three elements furnishes instances of either: In connexion with solidity there is the pleasant contact felt when a soft-palmed attendant is doing massage to one's feet, and the opposite when his hands are hard. From 'caloric,' or the flame-element, we may get the pleasure of a warming-pan in winter, or the reverse, if it is applied in summer. From the aerial element, we may get the pleasure of fanning in summer, or the discomfort of it in winter. Asl. 332, 333.\n\n2 The Cy. here discusses a point of attention in sense-perception which is interesting as adumbrating modern\nbody-sensibility, invisible and reacting, one has touched, touches, will, or may touch...\n\n[649]... against which tangible, invisible, and producing impact, the body-sensibility, invisible and reacting, has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge...\n\n[650]... such a tangible, invisible and producing impact, as has impinged, impinges, will, or may impinge against the body-sensibility, invisible and reacting...\n\nEuropean theories respecting consciousness and subconsciousness (Asl. 333). In a concrete object of sense, the three modes of the tangible, i.e., the three elements (solid, hot, airy), may all of them be present. Now do they all come 'at one stroke' into the field of consciousness (\u0101p\u0101tham)? They do. Thus come, do they impinge on the body-sense? They do. When it has thus made them a (mental) object, does cognition of body arise at one blow? It does not. Why? Thus: Mental objects are made either by deliberate sensing or by intrusion. (The latter term\u2014ussado\u2014is more literally extrusion, or prominence, but either word shows that involuntary, as contrasted with voluntary attention is meant.) Now when one is deliberately testing the hardness or softness of a ball of boiled rice by pressure, heat and vapour are present, but it is the solid to which one gives attention. If hot water be tested by the hand, though there is solid and vaporous (matter), it is heat that occupies the attention. If one lets the breeze blow on the body at the window in hot weather, solid and heat are present, but it is the aerial element that is attended to. Or take involuntary impressions: If you stumble, or knock your head against a tree, or bite on a pebble, heat and wind are present, but the intrusive object is solid matter. So analogously for walking on something hot, or being deafened by a hurricane. The three elements are not apprehended as such at the same instant. And with regard to the extended surface of the body-sentience, cognition of body arises only in that spot where the sentient surface is impinged upon, e.g., when a shoulder-wound is bathed (? dressed; cf. Vin. ii. 115 and Transl.) with a quill, the k\u0101ya-pa\u015bado of the shoulder is impinged upon, or intensified, and there cognition arises. And where the pa\u015bado is most powerfully impressed, there cognition arises first.\nin consequence of which tangible and depending on the body-sensibility, there has arisen, arises, will, or may arise\n\nbodily contact . . .\n\nand . . . born of that bodily contact,\n\na feeling . . .\n\n[or] a perception . . .\n\n[or] thinking . . .\n\n[or] cognition of body . . .\n\n[further,] having a tangible as its object and depending on the body(-sensibility), there has arisen, arises, will, or may arise\n\nbodily contact . . .\n\nand . . . born of that bodily contact,\n\na feeling . . .\n\n[or] a perception . . .\n\n[or] thinking . . .\n\n[or] cognition of body;\n\nthis that is the tangible, the sphere and element of the tangible\u2014this is that form which is the sphere of the tangible.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhat is that form which is the fluid (aqueous) element (\\(\u0101\\)podh\u0101tu)?\n\nThat which is fluid and belongs to fluid, that which is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Buddhaghosa goes on, with reference to the senses generally, to give a psychological account of the passing from one group of sensations or \u2018object of thought\u2019 to another in terms not far removed from what would now be used to describe the \u2018movement of attention\u2019 (Asl. 384). We pass from one object to another \\((a)\\) from deliberate inclination, or \\((b)\\) from a sensation of preponderating impressiveness (\\(ajjh\u0101saya\\)to v\u0101 visay\u0101dhimattato v\u0101). E.g., \\((a)\\) from saluting a shrine, a believer forms the intention of entering to do homage to a statue and contemplate the carvings and paintings. \\((b)\\) While contemplating some vast tope, a man is struck by the sound of music, and is then affected by flowers and incense brought near.\nviscid\\(^1\\) and belongs to viscous, the cohesiveness of form\\(^2\\) \u2014this is that form which is the fluid element.\n\n[All] this is that form which is not derived.\n\n[653] What is that form\\(^3\\) which is the issue of grasping (up\u0101di\u1e47\u1e47am)?\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Literally, oil (sneho). Cf. the description with that of \u0101k\u0101sadh\u0101tu, \u00a7 638.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is the aspect of the moist or liquid element in an object compact of several elements. The one essential \u2018mark\u2019 of \u0101po-dh\u0101tu is pagghara\u1e47am, flowing. See \u00a7 963. But \u2018cohesiveness of form means the cohering condition of some concrete in which there is superfluity of solid\u2019 (Asl. 335). For it is by the cohesive force of the fluid element that lumps of iron or what not are made rigid. Similarly in the case of stones, mountains, palms, tusks, horns, etc.\n\nHence Buddhaghosa passes on to discuss the mutually related spheres of the elements and their apparent approximations to each other, as in viscous things, e.g., or congealed liquid, or boiling water. Corrupt MSS., however, render parts of the disquisition hard to follow. His conclusion is that whereas the elements may vary in their condition as phenomena, their essential mark never alters, however latent it may be. And he quotes a yet unedited sutta (Atth\u0101naparikappa sutta), but which is repeated in A. i. 222, that it is easier for the four elements to change their essential character, than for the seeker of Nirvana (the Noble Student) to alter his high estate (Asl. 336).\n\n\\(^3\\) Here follow the remaining pairs of correlated terms, making up the categories of form under the Dual Aspect.\n\n\\(^4\\) Literally, \u2018which has been grasped at\u2019 or \u2018laid hold of.\u2019 This and the cognate terms are discussed under the \u2018Group on Grasping,\u2019 \u00a7 1213 et seq. It is disappointing to find that, with the exception of two items in the list of things \u2018grasped at,\u2019 or come into being through the action of karma (the two phrases are approximately equivalent), the Cy. does not discuss the inclusion of any. One would have liked to hear, e.g., why, of all sense-objects, sounds alone are \u2018not the issue of grasping\u2019 (cf. the heresy concerning sound as result [of karma, K. V. 466], and why the elements of space and of fluidity may and may not be the\nThe spheres of sight, hearing, smell, taste, body-sensibility, femininity, masculinity, vitality, or whatever form there exists through karma having been wrought, whether it be in the spheres of visible forms, odours, tastes, or the tangible; the element of space, the fluid element, the integration or the subsistence of form,\\(^1\\) or bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is the issue of grasping.\n\n[654] What is that form which is not the issue of grasping?\n\nThe sphere of sound, bodily and vocal intimation, lightness, plasticity and wieldiness of form, decay and impermanence of form, or whatever other form exists which is not due to karma having been wrought, whether it be in the sphere of visible forms, smells, tastes, or the tangible; the element of space or that of fluidity; the integration or the subsistence of form, or bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is not the issue of grasping.\n\n[655] What is that form which is both the issue of grasping and favourable to grasping (up\u0101dinn'up\u0101d\u0101niyam)?\n\nThe spheres of the five senses, femininity, masculinity and vitality, or whatever other form exists through karma having been wrought, whether it be in the spheres of\n\nissue of grasping, or what they have to do with it in any way.\n\nConcerning the two items above mentioned, how is it, asks the Cy. (337), 'that \"decay and impermanence\" are classed with respect to what is due, and what is not due to the performance of karma? They are classed with what is not the issue of grasping. That which has sprung from conditions other than karma is included under \"not due to the performance of karma...\" And as these two forms arise neither from karma, nor from form-producing conditions other than karma, they are therefore not classified with reference to karma. How they are acquired will become evident later.'\n\n\\(^1\\) For r\u016bpasantati read r\u016bpassa santati.\nvisible forms, odours, tastes or the tangible, in the elements of space or fluidity, in the integration or the subsistence of form or in bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is both the issue of grasping and favourable to grasping.\n\n[656] What is that form which is not the issue of grasping, but is favourable to grasping (anup\u0101di\u1e47\u1e47' up\u0101d\u0101niy\u0101m)?\u00b9\n\nThe sphere of sounds, bodily and vocal intimation, the lightness, plasticity, weldiness, decay and impermanence of form, or whatever other form exists which is not due to karma having been wrought, whether it be in the sphere of visible forms,\u00b2 smells, tastes, the tangible, in the element of space or of fluidity, in the integration, or the subsistence of form, or in bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is not the issue of grasping but is favourable to grasping.\n\n[657] What is that form which is visible?\n\nThe sphere of visible forms\u2014this is that form which is visible.\n\n[658] What is that form which is invisible?\n\nThe sphere of vision . . . and bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is invisible.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 The privative prefixed to the first half of this dvandva-compound does not apply to the latter half.

Hence to get, as we do, a positive answer would, if up\u0101d\u0101niy\u0101m were to be taken negatively, be a very patent infringement of the law of contradiction. The distributed negative is given by anup\u0101di\u1e47\u1e47\u0101nup\u0101d\u0101niy\u0101m as in \u00a7 992.\n\n\u00b2 I have elided sadd\u0101yatana\u1e41, and, on the next line, inserted \u0101podh\u0101tu, as consistent with \u00a7 654.

All the other terms in \u00a7 596, if understood as strictly abstract sensibility or sensation, or as abstract ideas, are inaccessible to sight. Even in kabalink\u0101ro \u0101h\u0101ro, it is only the vatthu, or embodiment of the concept of nutriment, that is visible. And similarly, whereas one\u2019s bodily gestures are visible, the \u2018intimation\u2019 given is a matter of inference, a mental construction.\n\n\\(^1\\) Both terms have been applied in the detailed theory of sense given in \u00a7 597 et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) Keeping to \u00a7 596 as the norm for these abbreviated replies, we may assume that these two (\u00a7\u00a7 659 and 660) divide out that answer between them.

This and the next two pairs of questions and answers refer to form of some kind as brought into relation with an intelligent agent. And the purest instance of this is those groups of phenomena which are brought into play when the agent is expressing himself. The expression or intimation itself, it says, does not spring directly from thought, but it is said nevertheless to have its source in thought because those phenomena (of gesture and speech) on which the intima-\nBodily and vocal intimation, or whatever other form exists that is born of thought, caused by thought, has its source in thought, whether it be in the sphere of visible forms, sounds, odours, tastes or tangibles, in the spatial, or the fluid element, in the lightness, plasticity, wieldiness, integration or subsistence of form, or in bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is sprung from thought.\n\n[668] What is that form which is not sprung from thought?\n\nThe sphere of the five senses, femininity, masculinity and vitality, the decay and the impermanence of form, or whatever other form exists that is not born of thought, not caused by thought, does not have its source in thought, whether it be in the sphere of visible forms, sounds, odours, tastes, or tangibles, in the spatial or fluid element, in the lightness, plasticity, wieldiness, integration or subsistence of form, or in bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is not sprung from thought.\n\n[669] What is that form which comes into being together with thought (citta-saha-bh\u016b)?\n\n[670] What is that form which does not come into being together with thought?\n\nAnswers as in the preceding pair of relatives.\n\n[671] What is that form which is consecutive to thought (citt\u2019\u0101nuparivatti)?\n\n[672] What is that form which is not consecutive to thought?\n\nAnswers as in the preceding pair of relatives.\n\ntion depends are immediately prompted by thought, just as we say that old age and death \u2018are\u2019 impermanence (in virtue of their forming part of the content of that idea).

It will already have been noted (p. 59, n. l.), that ajjhattam, ajjhattikam does not run on all fours with our modern psychological term \u2018subjective,\u2019 or that which belongs to the conscious experience of the individual. It connotes anything belonging to an individual organism, physical or mental. Hence, too, the word \u2018self\u2019 must here be understood in no narrow metaphysical, or even psychological sense, but as equivalent to the concrete person or attabh\u0101vo (see above, p. 175, n. 1). It is used in the sense of all but the last of the four constituents into which Professor W. James divides the Self, viz., the material Self (body, clothes, family, home, property: the Buddhist would only admit the first item, I fancy), the social Self (recognition from others), and the spiritual Self (psychic faculties or dispositions). (\u2018Principles of Psychology,\u2019 1892, i. 292-296.) Only the fourth constituent, the \u2018pure Ego,\u2019 was rejected by Buddhism, as it was, twenty-two centuries later, by Hume. Cf., however, the apparently more \u2018subjective\u2019 use in \u00a7\u00a7 161 and 1207.\n\nI have felt equal reluctance to foist the (relatively) modern counterpart \u2018objective\u2019 on to bahiram or bahiddh\u0101 (see \u00a7 1045).\n\n\u00b2 Read in full, this should coincide with the latter part of \u00a7 596, beginning at \u2018the spheres of visible form.\u2019\nFemininity . . . and bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is subtle.\\(^1\\)\n\n[677] What is that form which is remote (d\u016bre)?\n\nFemininity . . . and bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is remote.\n\n[678] What is that form which is near (santike)?\n\nThe spheres of the five senses and of the five kinds of sense-objects\u2014this is that form which is near.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Cy., paraphrasing ol\u0101rikam by th\u016blam, explains that this has reference to the material embodiment of sense-objects and to the fact of sensuous impact, sukhum\u0101 connoting the contrary. Under the latter class we have, according to my assumption (p. 203, n. 3), the indriyas of sex and vitality, intimation, space, the modes of form and the nutritive principle in food. The force of this effort at dichotomy is, to the modern Western mind, curious and not obvious. It is suggestive of tradition earlier than the date of the compiling of the Abhidhamma, as early as the earlier Upanishads\u2014of a time when there was no definite antithesis between material and immaterial, extended and unextended. We have seen that the senses, though \u2018invisible,\u2019 were conceived as species of \u2018form\u2019\u2014nay, that the later Cy. preserved the tradition of their shape and size. And I incline to think that just as, in the older Upanishads, soul was a shadowy, impalpable, but \u2018physical double of the physical body,\u2019 and just as \u2018when an early Greek philosopher speaks of \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f44\u03bd, he does not mean Being, but Body\u2019 (Burnet, \u2018Early Greek Philosophy,\u2019 27), so the items in the list divided out in these two answers are all physical \u2018forms,\u2019 whether patent, impressive, and pervading, or latent, fine and mysterious.\n\n\\(^2\\) D\u016bre, the Cy. explains, refers to that which on account of its being difficult to apprehend or discriminate cannot be discerned by way of the sensuous impact, whether it be literally far or near at hand. Conversely, santike refers to things which are patent to sense, even though they may be distant. The content of each division agrees with that of the preceding division, and we see that, whereas the field of sense-perception is pronounced to be a relatively patent, as well as gross concern, the essence of sex, vitality, etc.,\n[Basis. (vatthu).]\u00b9\n\n[679] What is that form which is the basis of visual contact (cakkhusamphassassa vatthu)?\nThe sphere of vision\u2014this is that form which is the basis of visual contact.\n\n[680] What is that form which is not the basis of visual contact?\nThe sphere of hearing . . .\u00b2 and bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is not, etc.\n\ndown to the nutritive principle in food, is found to be as obscure, latent or relatively inaccessible, as it was subtle or minute. Asl. 337.\n\n\u00b9 From \u00a7 653 to \u00a7 961 the Commentator lapses into silence, dismissing the reader with the remark that in the exposition on \u2018spheres,\u2019 etc. (\u00a7\u00a7 695-741), the method of treatment is more detailed than it was above, and, further, that the category of triplets (\u00a7 742 et seq.) is easy to understand. To enable the reader to gather with more ease the drift of this part of the catechizing, I have inserted a few headings to indicate whenever there is a change in the aspect under which \u2018form\u2019 is considered. Thus we have form considered under the aspect of the basis (vatthu) in the subjective procedure of coming-to-know, of the object so apprehended, and so forth.\n\nIn all the answers, where lacun\u00e6 occur, except where otherwise specified, the formula appears to be the answer of \u00a7 596, with one or more terms omitted, and with the occasional insertion of \u2018the sphere of the tangible,\u2019 according to the sense required by each specific process of dichotomy.\n\n\u00b2 By referring to the standard answer, \u00a7 596, it will be seen that the negatives in the present answer include \u2018visible forms,\u2019 or the objects of the sense of vision. Now, vatthu means seat, embodiment, or what we might call physical basis. However, then, the process of sense-stimulation was ultimately conceived, the effective result was held to take place in the sense-organ (and heart). The sense-object was defined as the \u0101rammanan of the contact.

Similarly, for the replies to the questions on sense taken objectively (\u00a7\u00a7 699, 701), see \u00a7\u00a7 617-632, 648-651.\n\nThe contradictories seem to be described in all four answers, by a repetition of \u00a7 596, with the omission in each case of the specific item named in the question on the corresponding positive term, and, presumably, with the insertion of \u2018the sphere of the tangible.\u2019\nThe sphere of vision . . . and bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is not, etc.\n\n[699] What is that form which is the sphere of visible forms?\n\nThat form which, derived from the four Great Phenomena, is visible under the appearance of colour . . . this . . . which is the constituent element of visible form\u2014this is that form which is the sphere of visible forms.\n\n[700] What is that form which is not the sphere of visible forms?\n\nThe sphere of vision . . . and bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is not, etc.\n\n[701] What is that form which is the sphere of sound,\nodour,\ntaste,\nthe tangible?\n\nThe earthy (solid) element . . . this that is the . . . element of the tangible\u2014this is that form which is the sphere of the tangible.\u00b9\n\n[702] What is that form which is not the sphere of . . .\nthe tangible?\n\nThe sphere of vision . . . and bodily nutriment\u2014this is that form which is not, etc.\n\n[Element (dh\u0101tu).]\n\n[703] What is that form which is the element of vision?\n\nThe sphere of vision\u2014this is that form which is the element of vision.\n\n\u00b9 In the printed text read r\u016bpam phottabb\u0101-yatanam.

The former term in the pair combined is, with its negative, a relative constant, there being a series of only six, namely, the concept of form as derived, as the product of karma, as that which breeds karma (literally, is karma-ish or karm-ous), as impressing the senses, as faculty, and as one of the elements (i.e., the opposite of derived, conceived positively). The latter five of these six are in turn used as the relatively variable term, with the addition of three others: the concept of form with respect to grossness or delicacy, to distance, and to visibility.\n\n2 On sound and karma, see p. 201, n. 4.\nwrought, whether it be in the spheres of visible forms, odours, or tastes, the element of space, the integration or subsistence of form, or bodily nutriment.\n\n(iii.) underived and the issue of grasping?\n[Form] due to karma having been wrought, which is in the sphere of the tangible and the fluid element.\n\n(iv.) underived and not the issue of grasping?\n[Form] not due to karma having been wrought, which is in the sphere of the tangible and the fluid element.\n\n[Derivation\u2014Production of Karma.]\n\n[881-884] What is that form which is\n\n(i.) derived and both the issue of grasping and favourable to it?\n\n(ii.) derived and not the issue of grasping but favourable to it?\u00b9\n\n(iii.) underived and both the issue of grasping and favourable to it?\n\n(iv.) underived and not the issue of grasping but favourable to it?\u00b2\n\nThe four answers are respectively identical with those in the preceding group.\n\n[Derivation\u2014Impact.]\n\n[885-888] What is that form which is\n\n(i.) derived and impingeing?\n\nThe spheres of the five senses, and of visible form, sound, odour and taste.\n\n(ii.) derived and non-impingeing?\n\nSex . . . and bodily nutriment.\n\n(iii.) underived and impingeing?\n\nThe sphere of the tangible.\n\n(iv.) underived and non-impingeing?\n\nThe fluid element.\n\n\u00b9 See \u00a7 656, n. 1.\n\u00b2 Read na before kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dha in the answer.\n[Derivation\u2014Bulk.]\n\n[889-892] What is that form which is\n(i.) derived and gross?\n(ii.) derived and subtle?\n(iii.) underived and gross?\n(iv.) derived and subtle?\n\nAnswers respectively identical with those in the preceding group.\n\n[Derivation\u2014Proximity.]\n\n[893-896] What is that form which is\n(i.) derived and remote?\nSex . . . and bodily nutriment.\n(ii.) derived and near?\nThe spheres of the five senses, and those of visible form, sound, odour and taste.\n(iii.) underived and remote?\nThe fluid element.\n(iv.) underived and near?\nThe sphere of the tangible.\n\n[Work of Karma\u2014Visibility.]\n\n[897-900] What is that form which is\n(i.) the issue of grasping and visible?\nThe sphere of visible form which is due to karma having been wrought.\n(ii.) the issue of grasping and invisible?\nThe spheres of the five senses;

I am under the impression that the first three members of this group are survivals of an older tradition, belonging to an age when the five senses had not been co-ordinated by psychological analysis comparable to that effected by the earlier Buddhist school, and when mano and its function, expressed here (in part) by this old past participle, were more vaguely conceived. In the Pra\u1e47a Upanishad, e.g., which may or may not be older than the Abhidhamma, either the five senses are grouped as above under manas, eye and ear, or the last two are alone held worthy to rank with the divine elements of life. If it be contended that the former interpretation is not plausible, it should be remembered that, in the far older Brihad\u0101ranyaka Upanishad (i., 5, 3), it is said that by manas we know when we are touched from behind. It is as though the tradition were endeavouring to say, Smell, taste, touching, without the aid either of sight or of hearing, require a greater effort of inference, of mental construction, of imagination, to realize the external cause, or potential concrete mental percept, than either sight or hearing.\n(iv.) All form is Form Cognized by the mind.\\(^1\\)\n\nSuch are the Categories of Form under Fourfold Aspects.\n\n[End of] the Groups of Four.\n\nBuddhaghosa, who here resumes his parable (Asl. 388), paraphrases *mutam* by *munitv\u0101 j\u0101nitabbatthena*, and by *phusitv\u0101 pi n\u0101nuppattik\u0101ranato*.\n\n\\(^1\\) *Manas\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101tam*, that is, *manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47ena j\u0101nitabban*. *Ibid.*\n[Chapter V.\n\nThe Category of Form under a Fivefold Aspect (pa\u00f1cavidhena r\u016bpasangaho).]\n\n[962-966] What is that form which is\n\n(i.) earth-element (pa\u1e6dhav\u012b-dh\u0101tu)?\u00b9\n\nThat which is hard, rough, hardness, rigidity, whether it be of the self,\u00b2 or external, or the issue of grasping,\u00b3 or not the issue of grasping.\n\n\u00b9 The essential mark (lakkha\u1e47a\u1e41) of the earth-element is given as \u2018hardness\u2019 (kakkhalattam, Asl., 332). This may very likely have conveyed to Buddhists what we understand by \u2018solid,\u2019 when the implication is density as opposed to what is liquid or gaseous, and it was tempting to use solidity in preference to hardness. But the former term is ambiguous, for it may mean the opposite of plane surface, and kakkhalattam cannot be strained to mean that. Again, the opposite of the latter term is neither liquid nor flat, but soft or pliant. Further, compare its use in describing gravel or stone-food in Mil. 67, where we should certainly use \u2018hard.\u2019 The other characteristics of pa\u1e6dhav\u012bdh\u0101tu are said to be establishing a fulcrum or \u03c0\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6, patitth\u0101nam), and accepting (sampaticchanam), the import of the latter term not being very clear.\n\n\u00b2 Ajjhattam. See \u00a7 673, note, and \u00a7 742, note.\n\n\u00b3 In the Commentary, p. 338, where up\u0101dinna\u1e41 is said to be na kammasamutth\u0101nam eva, the negative particle must have crept in by some error, that which is up\u0101dinna\u1e41 being essentially due to karma. See Dh. S., \u00a7\u00a7 653, 654; Asl., pp. 46, 337 (\u00a7 664), etc. Generally, says Buddhaghosa, the bony framework of the body (the most solid part of one\u2019s self, sariratthakam) is here\n(ii.) fluid-element (\u0101podh\u0101tu)?\nThat which is fluid, belonging to fluid, viscid, belonging to what is viscid, the cohesiveness of form, whether it be of the self, or external, or the issue of grasping or not the issue of grasping.\\(^1\\)\n\n(iii.) flame-element (tejodh\u0101tu)?\\(^2\\)\nThat which is flame, belonging to flame, heat, belonging to heat, hot, belonging to what is hot, whether it be of the self, or, etc. [continue as in preceding].\n\n(iv.) air-element (v\u0101yodh\u0101tu)?\nThat which is air, belongs to air [the fluctuation], the inflation,\\(^3\\) of form, whether it be of the self, or, etc.\n\nreferred to. For this, while it may, or may not be up\u0101dinnam, is said to be wholly the issue of grasping when signifying that which is taken, laid hold of, infected.\n\n\\(^1\\) See \u00a7 652, note. The essential characteristics of \u0101podh\u0101tu are said to be flowing (pagghara\u1e47am), expansion or spreading (br\u016bhanam, cf. p. 12, note 3, Mil. 317) and congress (sangaho, Asl., ibid.). The last term may possibly be an attempt to express what we term, loosely enough, \u2018water always finding its own level.\u2019 The internal or personal \u0101po is distributed as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, serum, tears, and so on. M. i. 42.\n\n\\(^2\\) Never agg\u012b or fire, in the Buddhist books. The essential characteristics are said to be (Asl., ibid.) heat, ripening, maturing (parip\u0101canam) and softening. By the heat within food and drink are digested. M., loc. cit.\n\n\\(^3\\) The text reads here both chambitattam and thambhitattam, fluctuation (quaking) and inflation. The former term, however, is not elsewhere in the Atthasalini applied to v\u0101yo; the latter, with the intensive vi-, is declared to be the characteristic mark of v\u0101yo, other features of the element being onward movement (samudiranam) and downward force (abhinih\u0101ram\u2014sic lege. Cf. D. i. 76; M. i. 119; Asl. 332). Now Buddhaghosa passes over chambhitattam in silence, but explains thambhitattam. Again, though this is, of course, not conclusive, only the single term thambhitattam r\u016bpassa seems to be called for by the parallel, bandhanatam r\u016bpassa (cohesiveness), in the description of fluidity. It is significant also that K. omits chambhitattam.

The instance chosen to\nillustrate the inflating function characteristic of v\u0101yo is\nthat of the sheaths or stems of lotuses and reeds which are\n'filled with air,' or wind (v\u0101tapunn\u0101ni).\n\n\\(^1\\) 'Derived' (up\u0101d\u0101) is the opposite of (i.) to (iv.).

According to the Cy. (344, 345), the various classes into which the states of the moral consciousness were distinguished (dhamma-vibh\u0101go) are now to be set forth by a method which, in its greater conciseness, is a rejection or discarding of the relatively more detailed exposition (vitth\u0101ra-desanam) of Book I. 'Any intelligent person can recognise,' for instance, that in the concise terms in which the answer to question [984] is couched, the answer to question [1], among others, is involved. Relatively to the following Atthakath\u0101, on the other hand (\u00a7 1368 to end in the printed text), this method is in its turn less concise, more detailed.\n\n\u00b2 By 'root' is meant 'cause, condition, bringing to pass, generating, originating, producing.'

Ekatth\u0101m is defined (Asl. 345) as located in one and the same thought by virtue of a common origin, or in one and the same person, by virtue of a common exclusion, to wit here, of corrupt or faulty states.

I have kept to the more literal rendering of bh\u016bmi here, in preference to some such term as \u2018stage\u2019 (as in \u00a7 277 et seq.) or \u2018source,\u2019 because of the analogy drawn by the Cy. (p. 346):\u2014just as by saying \u2018This is a sugar-soil\u2019 or \u2018a rice-land\u2019 we mean localities where these products thrive, so by sukha-bh\u016bmi, etc., we mean a thought (or state of mind, cittam), which is the place (or occasion, th\u0101nam) for the uprising of ease (or happiness).\n\n\\(^2\\) K. invariably places a colon before that enumeration of four or more skandhas which is part of the usual procedure in these triplets. There is nothing explicit in the Cy. to justify my interpretation by the parenthesis \u2018in other words\u2019 of the somewhat amorphous construction of the answers thus punctuated. But I gather from its remarks that, in these concentrated replies, the skandha-list represents the preceding half of the answer, in which it occurs, under\nWhich are the states that involve resultant states?\u00b9\n\nGood and bad states belonging to the worlds of sense, form and the formless, or to the life that is Unincluded; [in other words] the four skandhas.\n\nWhich are the states that neither are results, nor have the quality of involving resultant states?\n\nThose states concerning action which are neither good, nor bad, nor the results of karma; all form, moreover, and uncompounded element.\n\nWhich are the states that are both the issue of grasping and favourable to it?\u00b2\n\nThe co-Intoxicant\u00b3 results of good and bad states taking effect in the worlds of sense, form or the formless; in other words, the four skandhas; such form, moreover, as is due to karma having been wrought.\n\nWhich are the states that are not the issue of grasping but are favourable to grasping?\n\nGood and bad co-Intoxicant states taking effect in the worlds of sense, form, or the formless; in other words, the four skandhas; those states, moreover, known as kiriy\u0101-thoughts, which are neither good, nor bad, nor the results of karma; as well as such form as is not due to karma having been wrought.\n\nWhich are the states that are neither the issue of grasping nor favourable to it?\n\nanother aspect, viz., r\u0101satthena, or that of groups in consciousness. This is really the method followed in detail throughout Book I., but here in mere outline: first a reply in terms of dhamm\u0101, then the Summary, which is mainly, at least, in terms of skandha. Cf., e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 431-441, 441a, 442.

The term apariy\u0101panna, when applied to dhamma and used in an ethico-psychological sense, is described as here in terms of path, fruit and uncompounded element. See \u00a7 1287. Its positive correlate is paraphrased, in Asl. 50, by \u2018contained in the threefold cycle of existence\u2019 (i.e., the worlds of sense, form, etc.). I do not know whether apariy\u0101pannam with this lofty significance occurs in either of the older Pitakas. But it appears in K. V. 507, where it is declared a heresy to hold that any mere speculative opinion was of the Unincluded, and where the content of the latter concept is more amply set forth than in our manual.\n\n\\(^2\\) Read ca after maggaphal\u0101ni. The commentator vindicates the status of the arahat, here alluded to, as being free from all \u2018grasping\u2019 as follows: Although the skandhas (the temporary being) of the arahat may become a cause of grasping to those who say, Our mother\u2019s brother, the Thera! Our father\u2019s brother, the Thera! yet there is no grasping, no infection, attaching to the Paths, the Fruits and Nirvana. For just as there is no inducement to mosquitoes to alight on a ball of iron which has been heated all day, so these Things, by their excessive glory, do not attract the grasp of craving, pride or false opinion.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or corrupting.

In view of what can and can not be put away by 'insight,' it must be remembered that the term is here used in the technical sense it possesses for Buddhist ethics, and means the mental awakening, or intellectual conversion, by which one became a sot\u0101patti and entered the First Path\u2014and no more. Asl. 356, 357; 43. It was the vehicle for breaking the three Fetters named here, and numbered as 4th, 5th and 6th in the list of ten named later (\u00a7\u00a7 1118, 1123, note). It represented a certain vantage-point for mind and heart, from which the Promised Land of Nirvana was caught sight of, and the fact of impermanence first discerned (see the standard passage on this and n\u0101na-dassanam, D. i. 76),\nThe three Fetters,\\(^1\\) to wit, the theory of individuality, perplexity, and the contagion of mere rule and ritual.\n\nIn this connexion\n\n[1003] What is the 'theory of individuality'? \\(^2\\)\n\nas well as the futility of Substantialist theories, and the impotence of a religion of rules and works. Confidence in the new methods sprang up with the wider vision. Dassan\u0101m was powerless to remove the cosmic processes of life and mind: the collocations of phenomena, the evolution of karma, the infinite mystery of the extra-sensuous (see \u00a7 1008 and note). On various ways of attaining this insight, see the interesting Kimsuka Sutta, S. iv. 191. Relatively to the higher standpoints to be gained it might rather, says Buddhaghosa, be called no-vision. For even as a man, bound on some mission to a king, if he saw the latter pass afar off on his elephant, would say, if questioned, that he had not seen him, he not having accomplished his mission, so the convert, though he have caught his first glimpse of Nirvana, yet because of all he has to do in the getting rid of evil, is said to have no vision. His knowledge consists in a contemplation of the Path.\n\n\\(^1\\) On the Fetters, see \u00a7 1113 et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sakk\u0101ya-ditthi, embodying one of the most dangerous of all delusions from the Buddhist point of view, is by the Cy. (p. 348) connected with k\u0101yo, the phenomenal compound of five skandhas, and either with sat, in the sense of (noumenal) being, or with sayam, one's own. Cf. S. N., verses 950, 951; Dhp., verse 367. The latter explanation \u2014svak\u0101ya\u2014is probably correct (vide E. M\u00fcller, 'P\u0101li Grammar,' p. 19). 'Individuality,' then, stands for this skandha-complex, which we should now speak of as 'body and soul' (or mind). Both term and theory are discussed by Dhammadinn\u0101 in M. i. 299 et seq. (See an article by the writer in J. R. A. S., 1894, p. 324.) The fourth Up\u0101d\u0101na, or 'Grasping after a theory of soul,' is described in identical terms. See \u00a7 1217.\n\nDitthi, which is here rendered by 'theory,' and which might with equal propriety be translated by 'speculation' or 'views'\u2014all four terms having a common etymological basis in the notion of seeing, or things seen\u2014is in the answer rendered by 'opinion,' as fitting better that 'mass of notions current among the mass of men' which in the\nWhen in this world\u00b9 the ignorant,\u00b2 average\u00b3 man who perceives not the Noble Ones,\u2074 who comprehends not, nor\n\ncase of the puthujjano does service for organized knowledge. Gotama might possibly have approved the Platonic description of \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1 as \u2018something more dusky than knowledge, more luminous than ignorance.\u2019 To translate by \u2018heresy\u2019 or \u2018delusion\u2019 has the disadvantage of necessitating the use of other terms in the case of sound ditthi, such as that described, in M. P. S., Bh. I., as dit\u1e6dhi ariy\u0101 niyy\u0101nik\u0101. Cf. below, \u00a7 1366.\n\n\u00b9 Idha, a term, as the Cy. says, either of localization, or of instance in giving instruction; here used in the former sense, and meaning occurrence in the world. Asl. 348.\n\n\u00b2 Assutav\u0101, lit., one who has not heard, i.e., not been taught, who through lack of investigation, inquiry, acquiring, in such matters as skandhas, elements, spheres, conditions, constituents, meditations, is without proper tradition and attainment. Ibid.\n\n\u00b3 Puthujjano, the common worldling. The Cy. cites verses distinguishing l'homme sensuel moyen as either blind or amiable; of these the former is here meant. In another quotation (also as yet unverified) he is described as given to various common vices, governed by the individuality-theory, hanging on the lips of various ordinary preachers, immersed in every kind of re-birth; complicating life with various common complexities; carried away by divers vulgar currents; appeased or feverish with various low sources of gratification or of irritation; steeped in, greedy of, entangled in, infatuated with, involved in, sticking to, held fast and hampered by, the five low pleasures of sense; veiled, muffled, shrouded in, closed and cloaked and covered up by, the five low hindrances (\u00a7 1152 et seq.); as absorbed among the countless folk in the past of low character and conduct opposed to noble doctrine; or, finally, as one separate and distinct from those noble folk who are given to virtue and learning.\n\n\u2074 Ariy\u0101nam adass\u0101vi, referring either to the Buddhas, the Pacceka-buddhas and the disciples of the Buddhas, or to the Buddhas only. Buddhaghosa points out at some length that the inability to perceive, lit., see, holy persons is no mere visual shortcoming, but a lack of insight or of intelligent inference. The truly noble, as such, seen with\nis trained according to\\(^1\\) the doctrine of the Noble Ones, who perceives not good men,\\(^2\\) who comprehends not, nor is trained according to, the doctrine of good men, regards (1) the self as bodily form, or (2) as having bodily form, or regards (3) bodily form as being in the self, or (4) the self as being in bodily form;\\(^3\\) or regards (5) the self as feeling, or (6) as having feeling, or regards (7) feeling as being in the self, or (8) the self as being in feeling; or regards (9) the self as perception, or (10) as having perception, or regards (11) perception as being in the self, or (12) the self as being in perception; or regards (13) the self as syntheses, or (14) as having syntheses, or regards (15) syntheses as being in the self, or (16) the self as being in syntheses; or regards (17) the self as intellect, or (18) as having intellect, or regards (19) intellect as being in the self, or (20) the self as being in intellect\u2014then this kind of opinion, this walking in opinion, this jungle of opinion, wilderness of opinion,\n\nthe bodily, or with the 'divine' eye, are not really seen. Their appearance (va\u1e47\u1e47o) is apprehended, but not the area of their noble nature, even as dogs and jackals, etc., see them and know them not. Even the personal attendant of a Thera may not discern the hero in his master, so hard is it without insight and understanding to discern the standpoint attained by the saints, or the conditions of true nobility. 'What is to thee this vile body that thou seest, Vakkali? He who seeth the Doctrine, he it is who seeth Me!' S. iii., p. 120; Asl. 350.\n\n\\(^1\\) Avinito.

The specific forms of doubt are thus commented on (Asl. 354, 355): (1) As to whether or no the Teacher has the 32 major bodily marks, or the 80 minor bodily marks of a Buddha, or the requisite omniscience with respect to things past, future and present; (2) as to the adequacy of the Paths and their Fruits to lead indeed to the grand ambrosial Nirvana; (3) as to whether those of the Order are indeed at various stages of the path to salvation, or have rightly won their way so far; (4) as to whether the Training is helpful; (5) as to whether evolution by way of skandhas, dh\u0101tus and \u0101yatanas has held in the past, or will hold in the future; (6) as to whether there is a twelve-graded cycle of causation, taking effect here and now or taking effect at all.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ita bahiddh\u0101.\n\n\\(^4\\) I have ventured to adopt a reading differing slightly\nthis walking in mere opinion, this jungle of opinion, this wilderness of opinion, this puppet-show of opinion, scuffling of opinion, Fetter of opinion, the grip and tenacity of it, the inclination towards it, the being infected by it, this by-path, wrong road, wrongness, this 'fording-place,' this shiftiness of grasp\u2014this is called the contagion of mere rule and ritual.\n\n[1006] These three Fetters, and the Corruptions united with them,\u00b9 and the four skandhas associated with them, as well as the action, bodily, vocal and mental, springing from them\u2014these are the states which are to be put away by insight.\n\n[1007] Which are the states that are to be put away by culture?\u00b2\n\nfrom that both of the text and of K. The sense seems to demand it and the Cy. to imply it. The latter has: Silena ti gosiladin\u0101, vaten\u0101 ti govatadin\u0101 va (sic lege), silabbaten\u0101 ti tadubhayena, suddhi ti kilesasuddhi paramattha-suddhighbutam va nibb\u0101nam eva. But it would not be in accordance with the methods of the Cy. to quote vaten\u0101 ti if suddhivatena stood in the text. (Asl. 355.)\n\nAs to the terms gosila, govatam, it is not clear what were the practices and mode of life followed in the 'bovine morals,' etc., of those who were called govattik\u0101, or in the 'canine (? Cynic) practices' of the kukkuravattik\u0101. Both are named in M. i. 387. Cf. also Kh. P. Cy., p. 26.\n\nSuddhi, it will be seen, is distinguished as, on the one hand, the mere renunciation of the Kilesas (see \u00a7 1229), on the other, perfect holiness or Nirvana.\n\nOn silabbataparamaso, see Rhys Davids' 'American Lectures,' 146.\n\n\u00b9 These are said to be chiefly speculation and perplexity (regarded not as 'fetters,' but as plagues or evils), and, besides these, lust, hate, dulness, pride, stolidity, excitement, unconscientiousness, disregard of blame.\n\n\u00b2 Or practice: bh\u0101van\u0101, the collective name for the systematized effort in self-training of the disciple who, having attained 'insight,' leaves 'the principles of the doctrine' that he may 'go on unto perfection' (Heb. vi. 1)\u2014\nWhatever lust, hate and dulness still remain, and any corruptions united with them; the four skandhas that are associated with them; whatever action, bodily, vocal or mental, springs from them.\n\n[1008] Which are the states that are to be put away neither by insight nor by culture?\n\nGood and indeterminate states relating to the worlds of sense, form or the formless, or to the life that is Unincluded; the four skandhas; all form, moreover, and uncompounded element.\\(^1\\)\n\n[1009] Which are the states the causes of which are to be put away by insight?\\(^2\\)\n\nThe three Fetters, to wit, theory of individuality, perplexity, contagion of mere rule and ritual.\n\nIn this connexion\n\n[1010] What is \u2018theory of individuality\u2019? . . . [continue as in \u00a7\u00a7 1003-1005].\\(^3\\)\n\nin other words, travel along the three higher Paths to Arahatship.\n\nOn the \u2018powers of bh\u0101van\u0101,\u2019 see A. i. 52.\n\nIn A. i. 43, the \u2018one thing needful\u2019 for the perfecting of bh\u0101van\u0101 is said to be k\u0101yagata-sati, mindfulness in what concerns the body, or bodily action.\n\n\\(^1\\) Hence only akusala dhamm\u0101, \u2018bad states,\u2019 can be put away by insight and culture. Nor can even these two avail in mutual independence, for see \u00a7\u00a7 1258, 1260. The rest of one\u2019s karma goes on accumulating. The good and the indeterminate, the modes of matter, and Simple Element:\u2014these cannot cease for any individual until, according to Buddhaghosa, his abhisankh\u0101ra-vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101nam (Asl. 357)\u2014his constructing, storing intellect, itself dies out with the extinction of his life as Arahat.

I follow that in K., viz.: Tattha katam\u0101 sak\u0101yaditthi?\nThese three Fetters, and the Corruptions united with them, and the four skandhas associated with them, as well as the action, bodily, vocal and mental, springing from them\u2014these are the states the causes of which are to be put away by insight.\n\nThe three Fetters:\u2014theory of individuality, perplexity, contagion of mere rule and ritual\u2014are the states that are to be put away by insight.

Nevertheless, Buddhaghosa comments on it (p. 357).\n\n2 Here again I follow K. in reading pah\u0101tabba-het\u016b for hetuk\u0101.

Cf., however, \u00a7\u00a7 1282, 1284. \u2018Emotional\u2019 must be taken in its more limited sense, as the adjective to bare feeling or hedonic consciousness.\n\n1 See \u00a7 1021.\n\n2 The three subjects of this triplet of inquiry\u2014dhamm\u0101 hi\u1e47\u0101, majjhima, pa\u1e47\u012bt\u0101\u2014are paraphrased (Asl. 45) as l\u0101mak\u0101 (of poor quality, cf. Vin. ii. 76), midway between this and the third quality, and supramundane or ideal (lokuttar\u0101).\n\n3 Micchattaniyata, thus explained by the Cy. (ibid.): \u2018Wickedness\u2019 is that wrongful disposition which, in its\nThe five acts that have immediate results, and those wrong views that are fixed in their consequences.\\(^1\\)\n\ndesire for happiness, sees benefit in things baneful and persists in this perversion. 'Fixed in its consequences' (lit., 'reaching down to') means yielding a result immediately on the disintegration of the skandhas (\\textit{i.e.}, after death). \\textit{Cf.} M. P. S. 17: \\textit{asmi . . . niyato\u2014I am fixed or sure (as to my future); also K. V. 609-612, and P. P. 13: katamo ca puggalo niyato? The answer to this question is practically identical with those given in these sections. It is the persons (puggal\u0101) who are decisively good and bad that are called anantarak\u0101 (incurring immediate destiny good or bad) instead of the 'acts' or the 'Paths,' as in the Dh. S.\n\nThese five acts, the Cy. says, refer to 'matricide, etc.,' as though the Abhith\u0101nas were here alluded to, whereas the five usually classed under this name appear to be murder, theft, impurity, lying and intemperance. \\textit{Cf.} \u00a7\u00a7 1290, 1291. Compare the passage relating to lohitupp\u0101do, or the wounding of a Buddha, Vin. ii. 193, which is called an \u0101nantarika-kammam. I venture to think that, in the Mil., p. 25, the phrase kopa\u00f1c\u0101nantariya-kammam karoti is not intended, as the translator infers, to sum up the five offences previously specified, but is an allusion to five others, of which matricide was one and lohitupp\u0101do another. It only remains to ascertain whether or not the other three coincide with any other three of the six Abhith\u0101nas.\n\nAs to the immediacy of their consequences, whereas, from the Devadatta incident in the Cullavagga, the outrages entailed at least some of their retribution in this life, it will have been seen that, according to Buddhaghosa, the effect is experienced immediately after the cessation of the present life. The Cy. goes on: In the case of these acts, it is impossible for any other conduct to push off the karma of any one of them, so as to obtain room for the realization of its own consequences. Neither could the agent effect this if he were to build a golden st\u016bpa as big as Mt.

Later (p. 359) the Cy. gives the purport of this triad as follows: \u2018In the first formula the kind of causal conjunction of the skandhas, in their connexion with the Path by way of cause, in the sense of condition, is set forth. In the second, the kind of causal conjunction of the other parts of the Path with Right Views, which are a constituent of the Path and are reckoned as cause (amoho; cf. \u00a7\u00a7 16, 34, 1054); and in the third, the kind of causal conjunction of Right Views with those causes that are operative in the Path, is set forth.\u2019 Yet in the text it is the causal connexion of the\n[Firstly] the four skandhas when associated with the stages of the Path as experienced by one who is conversant with the Path\\(^1\\) (the stages being excepted).\n\n[Secondly (1033)] the four skandhas when associated with the right views\u2014these being both Path and Cause\u2014of one who is conversant with the Path (the right views being excepted).\n\n[Thirdly] the four skandhas when associated with the states of freedom from lust, hate and dulness peculiar to one who is conversant with the Path.\n\nNow, these [last named] states are the \u2018Path-causes\u2019;\\(^2\\) the former (the skandhas) are those states which are causally dependent upon the Path.\n\n[1034] Which are the causes that are Path-governed?\\(^3\\)\n\n[Firstly] those emotional, perceptual and synthetic states, as well as those of intellect applied to sense-impressions, which in arising make the Noble Path their governor.\n\n[Secondly] the four skandhas when associated with the investigation carried on by one who is conversant with the\n\n\\(^1\\) Ariyamaggasamangissa maggangan\u0101ni.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the printed text, after amoho read ime dhamm\u0101 magga-het\u016b.

Later (p. 359) we get supplementary remarks showing that the relation of governor (or sovereign) and governed, in this connexion, resembles that between Christ and the believer who brings \u2018into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ\u2019 (2 Cor. x. 5). All such thoughts or \u2018states\u2019 are insignificant (paritt\u0101) as compared with the one great object of devotion\u2014the Path, the Fruit, Nirvana. Even to contemplate the progress of others in the Path, or to have seen the Tath\u0101gata work a double miracle, is not precious to the student as is his own discernment and realization of what the Path means to him.\nPath, and who is cultivating a way wherein investigation is the dominant factor.\\footnote{The construction in this sentence is obscure. Vimams\u0101dhipateyyam is apparently in the nominative case. The Cy., however (p. 359), substitutes, in quoting, the instrumental\u2014which only makes the reading obscurer. Anyway, it proceeds to explain that the term shows a joint \u2018supremacy\u2019 between the Path and an adhipateyyam to be only possible (\\textit{cf}. \u00a7 269) when the latter is either \u2018investigation\u2019 or \u2018energy.\u2019 When the latter is \u2018desire\u2019 or a \u2018thought,\u2019 then the Path yields its sway over the mind to the adhipateyyam.

The Cy. distinguishes four varieties in the connotation of ajjhattan, namely, gocarajjhattam, niyakajjhattam, ajjhattajjhattam and visayajjhattam, two of which are identical with two of the three meanings cited by Childers.

It is to be regretted that Buddhaghosa\u2019s fertility in illustration was not applied to this species of dhamma. Incidentally one gathers that they alternate between self-reference and reference to other selves. For whereas the dhamma in the first and third questions are said to be either \u2018limited\u2019 or \u2018enlarged\u2019 (see \u00a7\u00a7 1019-1021), and those in the second are said to be \u2018infinite,\u2019 states that are \u2018infinite\u2019 are said \u2018not to take as their object that which now relates to the external, now to the self.\u2019 (Asl. 361, 362.)\nexternal [to the self] . . . concerning that which is 'personal-external'?\n\nThose emotional, perceptual, synthetic states, as well as those of intellect applied to sense-impressions,\\(^1\\) which arise in connexion with states of the self . . . states that are external . . . states that are personal-external.\n\n[1050] Which are the states that are both visible and impingeing?\\(^2\\)\n\nThe sphere of visible form.\n\n[1051] Which are the states that are invisible, but impingeing?\n\nThe spheres of the five senses and the spheres of sound, odour, taste and the tangible.\n\n[1052] Which are the states that are both invisible and non-impingeing?\n\nThe four skandhas; that form, moreover, which, being invisible and non-impingeing, is yet included in the sphere of [mental] states;\\(^3\\) also uncompounded element.\n\n[End of] the Triplets.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. \u00a7 1022 et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) See \u00a7 597 et seq., \u00a7 657 et seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) See \u00a7 980.\n[Chapter II.\n\nThe Group on Cause (hetu-gocchakam).]\u00b9\n\nI.\n\n[1053] Which are the states that are causes?\n(A) The three causes of good (karma).\n\n\u00b9 In connexion with the statement (\u00a7 595) that form is 'that which is not a cause,' the Cy. distinguishes, as did Aristotle, four varieties of cause. The coincidence, however, scarcely extends beyond the number. Hetu is either (a) cause as cause (hetu-hetu); (b) cause as condition, or necessary antecedent, 'wherewithal' (paccayahetu); (c) cause as ultimate or supreme (uttama-hetu); and (d) cause as an attribute held in common (s\u0101dh\u0101ranahetu). Asl. 303. These distinctions are shown to be applied as follows: (a) the trinity of threefold cause given in \u00a7 1053. Here the word is always paraphrased by 'root,' root, conversely, standing for productive agent in general (see the list in note to \u00a7 981), and, of course, for moral agency especially. (b) 'I have declared, bhikkhu, that the four great phenomena are the causes, are the conditions of the form-skandha.' When the paccayo is material, it may be said to coincide with Aristotle's second formal principle \u1f21 \u1f51\u03bb\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd. Possibly paccayo was this conception so generalized as to include the immaterial wherewithal requisite for the effect. Colebrooke, however ('Life and Essays,' ii. 419), said that the Baudhas distinguish between hetu as proximate cause and pratyaya (paccayo) as concurrent occasion. (c) 'When good (karma) takes effect, it is the object ultimately or supremely desired'\u2014and the opposite, of course, in the case of bad karma. This may possibly approximate\n(B) The three causes of bad (karma).\n(C) The three causes of the indeterminate.\n   The nine causes operative in the sensuous universe.\n   The six causes operative in the universe of form.\n   The six causes operative in the universe of the formless.\n(D) The six causes operative in the life that is the Unincluded.\n\n(A) In this connexion,\n[1054] Which are the three causes of good karma?\n   The absence of lust, hate and dulness.\nIn this connexion,\n[1055] What is the absence of lust?\n   The absence of lust, lusting, lustfulness is the absence of infatuation, of raving, of passionateness; the absence of covetousness, that absence of lust which is the root of good (karma).\u00b9\n\n[1056] What is the absence of hate?\n   The absence of hate, hating, hatred; love,\u00b2 loving, loving disposition;\u00b3 tender care, forbearance, considerateness;\u2074\n\nto Aristotle's final cause (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03bd \u1f14\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1). (d) 'As the essence of the elements of earth and water (solid and liquid) are the condition of sweet or not-sweet, so is ignorance the common base-element of the syntheses (sansk\u0101ras). In our present connexion the term is said to be used in its first-named meaning.\n\n\u00b9 Cf. \u00a7 32. The Pali terms coincide in both answers. In the following answer, the terms differ considerably from those in \u00a7 33.\n\u00b2 The printed text has mettam; the Cy. and K. read metti.\n\u00b3 'The mental condition of one who is possessed by love, and through love is loosed from clinging.' (Asl. 362.). Cf. note on p. 66.\n\u2074 Anudd\u0101, anudd\u0101yan\u0101, anudd\u0101yitattam. The Cy. paraphrases by rakkhati, showing the reference there is in these terms, usually rendered by 'pity,' 'compassion,' to the protective, shielding aspect of altruism and benevolence. Cf. its use in C. vii. 3, 13; S. ii., p. 218, where it\nseeking the general good,\\(^1\\) compassion; the absence of malice, of malignity; that absence of hate which is the root of good (karma).\\(^2\\)\n\n[1057] What is the absence of dulness?\n\nKnowledge about ill, about the uprising of ill, about the cessation of ill, and about the way leading to the cessation of ill; knowledge about the former things, about the latter things, about both taken together; knowledge about the assignable causation of causally determined states\u2014even that kind of wisdom which is understanding, search, research, searching the Truth, etc. [continue as in \u00a7 34].\n\nThese are the three causes of good (karma).\n\n(B) In this connexion,\n\n[1058] Which are the three causes of bad (karma)?\n\nLust, hate, dulness.\n\nIn this connexion,\n\n[1059] What is lust?\n\nThat which is\n\npassion (r\u0101go),\n\ninfatuation (sar\u0101go),\\(^3\\)\n\nfawning (anunayo),\\(^4\\)\n\ncompliance (anurodho),\\(^5\\)\n\nis used to express that attitude of forbearance in the interests of the weaker brethren recommended by St. Paul to Roman and Corinthian adherents.\n\n\\(^1\\) Hitesit\u0101.

Possibly the procedure in the induction of Jh\u0101na was in his mind in using these technical terms. Cf.

The term is probably formed from \u221as\u0101, to bind (or to gain), and usually, by its context, signifies attachment. Cf. M. i. 109, 498; Mil. 74. Judging by the Commentary, however, there seems to be a homonym derived from the root a\u00e7, to eat, similar to the parallel evolution of jh\u0101yati, from \u221adhy\u0101 and \u221ak\u1e63\u0101. Cf. Rhys Davids, 'Dialogues of the Buddha,' i. 33, note 2.

The Cy. (p. 47) on this term has: Sampa-yogato pavattena saha hetun\u0101 ti sahetuk\u0101, and on the opposite: aheto k\u0101th Ta\u1e6dh\u2019eva pavatto n\u2019atthi etesam het\u016b ti. This may be rendered: \u2018Sahetuk\u0101 means, union in continuance with a cause.\u2019 And \u2018aheto k\u0101th means, there is for them no continuance of a cause.\u2019 The sustaining of a cause in concomitance with a given state is so much harped upon by the Cy. that one is tempted to surmise that the medi\u00e6val controversy, known by the formula, Cessante caus\u0101 cessat et effectus, was not unfamiliar to Buddhist scholastics. Have we here the categorizing of certain states, for the maintenance of which, as effects, the continuance of the cause is required? In that case the Buddhist would have agreed (see \u00a7 1075, n.) with a modern logician (J. S. Mill) that, in some cases only, \u2018The continuance of the condition which produced an effect is necessary to the continuance of the effect.\u2019 The coincidence, however, is extremely doubtful. The Pali even leaves it vague as to whether the concomitant cause is the cause of the state in question; sometimes, indeed, this is evidently not the case. E.g., in \u00a7 1077 \u2018dulness\u2019 is a hetu-dhammo, but not therefore the cause of the concomitant states, lust and hate.

Cf. Mil. 87, where this intellectual process is more clearly set forth. Buddhaghosa\u2019s argument is to me less clear.\n[Chapter IV.\n\nThe Intoxicant Group (\u0101sava-gocchakam).]\n\n[1096] Which are the states that are Intoxicants?\u00b9\nThe four Intoxicants, to wit, the Intoxicant of sensuality,\n\n\u00b9 'Intoxicant' is but a pis-aller for \u0101savo, no adequate English equivalent being available (see Rhys Davids, 'Dialogues of the Buddha,' i., p. 92, n. 3). The choice of it here has been determined by Buddhaghosa's comment. This is as follows: \u0100sav\u0101 means they flow on to. They are said to flow (lege savanti), to circulate about the senses and the mind. Or, they flow, in respect of mental states, right up to the elect, in respect of space, right up to the highest planes of becoming\u2014I mean, their range embraces both states and space, this encompassing being denoted by the prefix \u0101. The \u0100savas, moreover, are like liquors (\u0101sav\u0101), such as spirits, etc., in the sense of that which may be kept a long time. For, in the world, spirits, etc., which have been laid down for a long period are called \u0101savas. And if those spirits for this long storage are called \u0101savas, these states deserve the name as well. For it is said: \"The ultimate point of ignorance, brethren, before which ignorance has not existed, is not manifest\" [alluding to the \u0101sava of ignorance].\u2019 Asl. 48.\n\nFrom this passage we gather that, to Buddhaghosa, the word \u0101savo, whatever other implications it may have had, typified mainly two notions, and these were pervasion and length of growth of a potential and very potent effect. The former metaphor\u2014that of a flowing in, upon, and over\u2014occurs with a cognate verb in the standard description of the guarded avenues of sensation\u2014anv\u0101s(s)a-veyyum (e.g., D. i. 70). The latter notion appears in\nthe Intoxicant of renewed existence, the Intoxicant of speculative opinion, the Intoxicant of ignorance.\n\nIn this connexion\n\n[1097] What is the Intoxicant of sensuality?\n\nThat sensual desire,\\(^1\\) sensual passion, sensual delight,\n\nSubh\u016bti\u2019s opening remark on the term (\u2018Abhidh\u0101nappadipika-s\u016bci,\u2019 s.v. Asavo): m\u0101na-purisamad\u0101dayo yen\u0101ti\u2014that by which come pride and human madness [or infatuation]. No doubt the term also implied something that tainted, corrupted, souillissait as it flowed. But this is also part of the physiological and ethical import of the term I have selected in translating.\n\nLater (p. 369) the Cy. considers the Intoxicants under numerical categories, according to the very usual Buddhist method. Thus, they are One, or undifferentiated, in virtue of their being, like liquor, long stored up. In the Vinaya they are treated of as Twofold:\u2014the Intoxicants that have to be suppressed in this life and those that have to be eschewed in future lives (see V. iii. 21; V., pp. 143, 223). In the Suttanta, e.g., in the Sal\u0101yatana-Sutta, they are distinguished under Three heads, ditth\u0101sava being omitted. (The Sutta referred to is not yet edited, but v. M. i. 55; S. iv. 256; A. i. 167; iii. 414; and cf. D. i. 84. In the Mah\u0101-parinibb\u0101na-sutta of the D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya, however, all four \u0100savas are mentioned (pp. 38, 40). Hence follows one of three possible conclusions. Either Buddhaghosa is for once in error, or the edition of the Sutta last named needs correcting, or it is a later work, contemporary, it may be, with the Abhidhamma.) In the passage on \u2018Penetration\u2019 (A. iii. 410-417) they are treated of as leading to Five different forms of rebirth. \u2018In the \u0100huneyya-sutta of the Chakka nip\u0101ta\u2019 (i.e., No. lviii. of that Nip\u0101ta, A. iii. 387) they are treated of under Six methods for overcoming them. In the Sabb\u0101sava-discourse (M. i., pp. 7-11) Seven methods are given.\n\n\\(^1\\) \u2018K\u0101machando ti k\u0101masankh\u0101to chando na kattukamyat\u0101chando na dhammachando.\u2019 Asl. 370. This carefully-drawn distinction between sensual desire and an ethically neutral state of bare conation, as well as the desire after the ideal, bears me out in the argument I ventured to put forward in J. R. A. S., January, 1898, and which is rediscussed in my Introduction.\nsensual craving, sensual fondness, sensual thirst, sensual fever, sensual languishing, sensual rapacity, which is excited by the pleasures of the senses\u2014this is called the Intoxicant of sensuality.\n\n[1098] What is the Intoxicant of renewed existence?\n\nThe desire, the passion for coming into being, delight in coming into being, craving, fondness for coming into being, the fever, the yearning, the hungering to come into being, which is felt concerning rebirths\u2014this is called the Intoxicant of renewed existence.\n\n[1099] What is the Intoxicant of speculative opinion?\n\nTo hold that the world is eternal, or that it is not eternal, infinite or finite; that the living soul is the body, or that the living soul is a different thing from the\n\n---\n\n1 Pa\u00f1cak\u0101maguniko r\u0101go k\u0101m\u0101savo n\u0101ma (Asl. 369). The Cy. points out that to hanker after the mansions of the supreme gods or the wishing-trees of heaven or the craving for aesthetic luxuries (\u0101bhara\u1e47am) is not to be confounded with the Intoxicant of sensuality, since such desires are a step higher than the latter vice. But they are subsumed under the Tie of covetousness (\u00a7 1136), and the Lust-cause (\u00a7 1059).

Asl. 48. This list differs in some items from the well-known dasa sa\u00f1\u00f1ojan\u0101ni occurring so often in the Suttas, and enumerated in Childers. See Rhys Davids, 'American Lectures,' 141 et seq. That that older category was known to Buddhaghosa may be gathered from his naming the first three in order as 'states which are to be put away by insight,' \u00a7 1002 et seq. He proffers, however, no comment on the two lists as such. In M. i. 360-363, eight states of mind are enumerated and severally designated as a Fetter and a Hindrance, but they are quite different from either category habitually understood by these two titles. Cf. also M. i. 432; A. ii. 238; Div. S. 533, 553.\nIn this connexion,\n\n[1114] What is the Fetter of sensual passion?\n\nThat sensual desire, sensual passion, sensual delight, sensual craving, sensual fondness, sensual fever, sensual languor, sensual rapacity, which is excited by the pleasures of the senses\u2014this is called the Fetter of sensuality.\\(^1\\)\n\n[1115] What is the Fetter of repulsion?\\(^2\\)\n\nAnswer as for \u2018hate,\u2019 \u00a7 1060.\n\n[1116] What is the Fetter of conceit?\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. with \u00a7 1097. The single discrepancy is the omission in \u00a7 1114 of \u2018sensual thirst\u2019 (k\u0101mapip\u0101so), both in the P. T. S. text and in K.\n\n\\(^2\\) Patigha-sa\u00f1\u00f1\u014djanam, cf. \u00a7\u00a7 418-421.\n\n\\(^3\\) M\u0101na-sa\u00f1\u00f1\u014djanam\u2014or pride. Conceit is etymologically more exact, though not so in any other respect. \u2018Lowly\u2019 is hino. Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 269, et seq., 1025. \u2018Loftiness and haughtiness\u2019 are unnati, unnamo. \u2018[Flaunting] a flag\u2019 is simply dhajo, the metaphor implying the pretensions conveyed by raising a flag over one\u2019s self or property, but answering better to our metaphor of a \u2018flourish of trumpets.\u2019 \u2018Assumption\u2019 is sampagg\u0101ho. The Cy. (p. 372) hereon has ukkhipanatthena cittam sampagganh\u0101ti ti\u2014to grasp in the sense of tossing (puffing up) the mind. Cf. s\u012bsam ukkhipitv\u0101, quoted by Childers, and the Hebrew figures for arrogance, etc.\u2014lifting up head, horn, heel, or one\u2019s self on high; also pagg\u0101ho, \u00a7 56. \u2018Desire of the heart for self-advertisement\u2019 is ketukamyat\u0101 cittassa. I can only make sense of the Cy. hereon by altering the punctuation followed in the text. Thus: Ketu vuccati bah\u016bsu dhajesu accuggatadhajo. M\u0101no pi punappuna uppajjam\u0101no apar\u0101pare up\u0101d\u0101ya accuggata-thena ketum viyati ketu. Ketum icchati ti ketukamyatassa bh\u0101vo ketukamyat\u0101. S\u0101 pana cittassa, na attano, tena vuttam:\u2014ketukamyat\u0101 cittass\u0101 ti. \u2018A flag hoisted above many flags is called a ketu (sign, or standard); cf. R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a i. 19, 16, quoted by B\u00f6hl. and Roth). By ketu is meant the conceit which arising again and again is like a signal in the sense of something set up on high. The state of ketu-desire, i.e., to wish for self-advertisement, is ketukamyat\u0101. But this means [a state of] mind, not of a self-entity, therefore the phrase is desire of the mind [or heart] for self-advertisement.\u2019\nConceit at the thought 'I am the better man'; conceit at the thought 'I am as good [as they]'; conceit at the thought 'I am lowly'\u2014all such sort of conceit, overweening, conceitedness, loftiness, haughtiness, flaunting a flag, assumption, desire of the heart for self-advertisement\u2014this is called conceit.\n\n[1117] What is the Fetter of speculative opinion?\n\nAnswer as for the 'Intoxicant of speculative opinion,' \u00a7 1099, with this supplement: And, with the exception of the 'Fetter of the contagion of mere rule and ritual,' all wrong views are included in the Fetter of speculative opinion.\n\n[1118] What is the Fetter of perplexity?\n\nAnswer as for 'perplexity,' \u00a7 1004.\n\n[1119] What is the Fetter of the contagion of mere rule and ritual?\n\nAnswer as for the 'contagion of,' etc., \u00a7 1005.\n\n[1120] What is the Fetter of the passion for renewed existence?\n\nAnswer as for the 'Intoxicant of renewed existence,' \u00a7 1098.\n\n[1121] What is the Fetter of envy (iss\u0101sa\u00f1\u00f1o-janam)?\n\nEnvy, envying, enviousness\u2014jealousy, the expression and mood of jealousy at the gifts, the hospitality, the respect, affection, reverence and worship accruing to others\u00b9\u2014this is called the Fetter of envy.\n\n[1122] What is the Fetter of meanness (macchari-sa\u00f1\u00f1o-janam)?\n\nThe Five Meannesses, to wit, meanness as regards dwelling, families, gifts, reputation, doctrine\u00b2\u2014all this sort of\n\n\u00b9 In other words, discontent and murmuring at the success of one's neighbour, and complacency when bad luck overtakes him (Schadenfreude). Asl. 373. Cf. P. P., p. 19.\n\n\u00b2 Buddhaghosa is at some pains to distinguish genuine instances of want of magnanimity from such as are not. For example, it is macchariyam when a bhikshu, enjoying the use of a lodging, grudges another a share of it, or when he grudges another intercourse with his own patrons\nmeanness, grudging, mean spirit, avarice and ignobleness,\\(^1\\) niggardliness and want of generosity of heart\\(^2\\)\u2014this is called the Fetter of meanness.\n\nand relatives, or gifts from the laiety for his piety, or that he should enjoy a reputation for physical or moral attractiveness, or that he should win proficiency in the letter, or the spirit of doctrine. On the other hand, it is not macchariyam to deprecate the arrival at one\u2019s lodging of quarrelsome persons and the like, or the introduction to one\u2019s own social circle of peace-breakers, or the gifts made to selfish, miserly brethren instead of to the virtuous. Nor is it ungenerous in every case to withhold instruction from an inquirer. Reserve may be employed out of regard either for the doctrine, or for the inquirer. The latter may distort the imparted doctrine, or the doctrine may upset him. Nevertheless, it is an act of doctrinal illiberality to withhold the doctrine, if the inquirer is not a \u2018weak brother,\u2019 but one likely to prove hostile to \u2018our Cause\u2019 (amh\u0101kam samayam bhinditum samattho).\n\nThere then follows a mythological paragraph on the unpleasant rebirths awaiting those who err with respect to any one of these five forms of meanness. Asl. 374, 375.\n\n\\(^1\\) Veviccham kadariyam. These terms are characterized (Asl. 375, 376) as respectively the soft (mudu) and hard (thaddha) varieties of meanness (\\(cf.\\) Childers, s.v. thaddho). We might name them the negatively and the positively anti-social. For the former is the spirit that says, spreading itself over all its own gettings, \u2018Mine be it, not another\u2019s!\u2019 (\\$ 1059). The latter (the anariyo) would even prevent another from giving to others.\n\n\\(^2\\) Katuka\u00f1cukat\u0101 aggahitattam cittassa. There is doubt about the reading of the former term. K. has kataka\u00f1cukat\u0101, Buddhaghosa katuka\u00f1cukat\u0101. The term is discussed by Morris, J. P. T. S., 1887, p. 161. Buddhaghosa\u2019s remark is as follows (Asl. 376): \u2018Katuka\u00f1cuko means that, on seeing a beggar, owing to one\u2019s styptic (katuko) disposition, one\u2019s heart narrows or is bent (a\u00f1cati\u2014?/an h, or a\u00f1c) and shrinks up.\u2019 He then, in offering an alternative explanation, relapses into characteristic etymology, deriving katuka\u00f1cukat\u0101 from katucchugaho\u2014spoon-helps. When your rice-pot is full to the brim, one can only take niggling helps with the tip of\nWhat is the Fetter of ignorance?\n\nAnswer as for the Intoxicant of ignorance, \u00a7 1100.\n\nThese are the states that are Fetters.\n\nWhich are the states that are not Fetters?\n\nEvery state, good, bad and indeterminate, which is not included in the foregoing [ten] states, whether it relates to the worlds of sense, or of form, or of the formless, or to the life that is Unincluded; in other words, the four skandhas; all form also, and uncompounded element.\n\nWhich are the states that are\n\n(a) favourable to the Fetters?\n\nCo-Intoxicant states, good, bad and indeterminate, relating to the worlds of sense, form, or the formless; in other words, the five skandhas.\n\n(b) unfavourable to the Fetters?\n\nThe Paths that are the Unincluded and the Fruits of the Paths, and uncompounded element.\n\nWhich are the states that are\n\n(a) associated with the Fetters?\n\n(b) disconnected with the Fetters?\n\nAnswers identical with those given to corresponding questions respecting the 'Intoxicants.' \u00a7\u00a7 1105, 1106.\n\nWhich are the states that are\n\n(a) both Fetters and favourable to the Fetters?\n\na spoon. And just as the heart of the niggard shrinks, so too is his body 'bent back on itself, thrown back on itself, obtains no peace' (he quotes from Mil., p. 297). Similarly aggahitattam cittassa is a holding the heart fast, or back, preventing its expansion by way of gifts and service to others.\n\n1 Sa\u00f1\u00f1ojananiy\u0101. So the text and K. The Cy. reads sa\u00f1\u00f1ojananiy\u0101. But cf. ganthaniy\u0101, oghaniy\u0101, yoganiy\u0101, Asl. 49. The Cy. explains the term, which is literally fetter-ish, as that which benefits the Fetters by developing them, once their inception has begun. Asl. 48.\nThe Fetters themselves are both\n\n[1130] (b) favourable to the Fetters but not themselves Fetters.\n\nThe states which are favourable to those [ten] states afore-named; that is to say, with the exception of the Fetters themselves, all co-Intoxicant states whatever, good, bad and indeterminate, whether relating to the worlds of sense, form or the formless; in other words, the five skandhas.\n\nWhich are the states that are\n\n[1131] (a) both Fetters and associated with Fetters?\n\nThe Fetter of sensuality in conjunction with the Fetter of ignorance, and conversely, is both. So is any one of the remaining eight Fetters when in conjunction with the Fetter of ignorance, and conversely.\n\n[1132] (b) associated with the Fetters but not a Fetter?\n\nThe states which are associated with those ten states afore-named, with the exception of the Fetters themselves; in other words, the four skandhas.\n\nWhich are the states that are\n\n[1133] (a) disconnected with the Fetters yet favourable to them?\n\nThe states which are disconnected with those afore-mentioned [ten] states, that is to say, good, bad and indeterminate states which are co-Intoxicant, whether they relate to the worlds of sense, or of form, or of the formless; in other words, the five skandhas.\n\n[1134] (b) disconnected with the Fetters and not favourable to them?\n\nThe Paths that are the Unincluded and the Fruits of the Paths; all form also, and uncompounded element.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 In quitting the subject of Fetters, the Cy. declares (pp. 376, 377) that the Fetters of sensuality and repulsion are put away during one's progress through the third (anag\u0101mi) path, the Fetter of conceit in the fourth\n(arahatta) path, the Fetters of speculative opinion, perplexity, and the contagion of mere rule and ritual, in the first (sot\u0101patti) path, the Fetter of the passion for renewed existence in the fourth path, the Fetters of envy and meanness in the first path, the Fetter of ignorance in the fourth path. Hence the second path seems, according to Buddhaghosa, to constitute an interim in the breaking of Fetters.\n\nThe following tables show how far the Dh. S. and its Cy. agree with the authorities quoted in Childers, s.v. samyojanam (cf. D. i. 156):\n\n| Dh.

[continue as in the Group of Fetters.]\n\n1 This and the group in the next chapter are thus indicated to be taken as read, in both the text and K. By the table of contents, it can be seen that the same system of catechizing is followed as in the Groups of the Fetters and the Ties. In S. v., p. 59, may be seen the number and kind of 'states' included under Floods or under Bonds, the contents of either group being identical with the four \u0100savas. These are the Flood or Bond of sensuality (k\u0101ma), renewed existence (bhava), speculative opinion (ditthi) and ignorance (avijj\u0101). The Atthas\u0101lini only remarks that the Floods are states so called because they sink him for whom they exist into sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, while the Bonds, like the Ties, chain him to the Circle (p. 49). Also that the adjectives, oghaniy\u0101 and yoganiy\u0101, analogous to ganthaniy\u0101, stand for that which can be engulfed by Floods and enchained by Bonds respectively.\n[Chapter VIII.\n\nThe Group of the Bonds (yoga-gocchakam).]\n\n[1151a] Which are the states that are Bonds?\n... [continue as in the Group of Fetters].\n[CHAPTER IX.\n\nThe Group of the Hindrances (n\u012bvara\u1e47a-gocchak\u0101m).]\n\n[1152] Which are the states that are Hindrances?\nThe six Hindrances, to wit, the Hindrance of sensual desire, the Hindrance of ill will, the Hindrance of stolidity and torpor, the Hindrance of excitement and worry, the Hindrance of perplexity, the Hindrance of ignorance.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn this connexion\n\n[1153] What is the Hindrance of sensual desire?\nAnswer as for the \u2018Intoxicant of sensuality,\u2019 \u00a7 1097.\\(^2\\)\n\n[1154] What is the Hindrance of ill will?\nAnswer as for the \u2018Tie of ill will,\u2019 \u00a7 1137.\n\n[1155] What is the Hindrance of stolidity and torpor?\nFirst distinguish between stolidity and torpor.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the Sutta Pitaka, the Hindrances form a category of five, ignorance (avijj\u0101) being excluded. See the description in D. i. 71-74, and cf. D. i. 246; M. i. 60, 144, 181, 269, 294, etc.; A. iii. 63; S. v. 60, 94-98. This discrepancy is not noticed by Buddhaghosa. See also \u00a7 1112, etc. The Hindrances are to be understood as states which muffle, enwrap or trammel thought. States, again, which are n\u012bvara\u1e47iya are to be understood analogously to those which are sa\u00f1\u00f1ojaniy\u0101. Asl. 49.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u2018Sensual thirst\u2019 is again omitted, as in the description of the corresponding Fetter, \u00a7 1114.\n\n\\(^3\\) It is interesting to note that whereas the text calls thinam (stolidity) a morbid state of the cittam and middham a morbid state of the k\u0101yo, Buddhaghosa, in\nIn this connexion,\n\n[1156] What is stolidity?\n\nThat which is indisposition,\\(^1\\) unwieldiness\\(^2\\) of intellect; adhering and cohering; clinging, cleaving to, stickiness; stolidity, that is, a stiffening, a rigidity of the intellect\\(^3\\)\u2014this is called stolidity.\n\n[1157] What is torpor?\\(^4\\)\n\nThat which is indisposition and unwieldiness of sense, a shrouding, enveloping,\\(^5\\) barricading within;\\(^6\\) torpor that\n\nhis Cy. on the D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya (Sum. 211), speaks of thinam as citta-gela\u00f1\u00f1am (sickness or affection of the mind), and of middham as cetasikagela\u00f1\u00f1am. The apparent inconsistency, however, will vanish if the predominantly psychological standpoint of the Dhamma Sangani be kept in mind. By k\u0101yo, as Buddhaghosa reminds us (Asl. 378; see above, p. 43, n. 3), is meant \u2018the three skandhas\u2019 of feeling, perception and syntheses, that is to say, the three through which we have subjective experience of bodily states objectively conceived. And cetasiko is the adjective corresponding to k\u0101yo taken in this sense (\\$ 1022). Hence stolidity is confined to the vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-skandha, which = citta = (approximately) representative intellection, while torpor is a corresponding affection of mind on its presentative and emotional side.\n\n\\(^1\\) Akalyata, equivalent to gil\u0101nabh\u0101vo, Asl. 377, where Mah\u0101 Vibhanga, i. 62, is quoted.\n\n\\(^2\\) See \u00a7 47.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u2018The (stolid) mind cannot be maintained in any required attitude or deportment. It is as inert as a bat hanging to a tree, or as molasses cleaving to a stick, or as a lump of butter too stiff for spreading\u2019 (Asl., ibid.). \u2018Attached to\u2019 (linam) is paraphrased by avipph\u0101rikat\u0101ya patikutitam, lit., bent back without expansion, where the notion, as conceived by the Commentator, has something akin to ka\u1e6duka\u00f1cukat\u0101 or niggardliness. See \u00a7 1122, n. 2.\n\n\\(^4\\) Middham, derived by the Cy. from medhati (\u221amed, \u2018be fat\u2019); there is a cognate notion in our \u2018torpor,\u2019 cf. \u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, to be sated, and \u221atarp.\n\n\\(^5\\) On\u0101ho, pariyon\u0101ho.

The Cy. explains that, as men cannot get out of an invested city, so dhamma, blockaded by torpor, cannot get out by expansion or diffusion).\n\n\\(^1\\) There is no comment on this repetition of soppam.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Commentator in his general remarks on this Hindrance is at pains to point out that for the khin\u0101savo, or arahat, a periodical torpor or repose has ceased to engender bad karma. The Buddha allowed an after-dinner nap, for instance, at certain seasons (see M. i. 249), as not in itself conducive to a bemuddling of the mind. So powerful, however, is the Hindrance to the non-adept, that its influence is not rooted out till the arahat Path is gained. The arahat is fain to rest his frail body (lit., his fingernail-k\u0101yo), but to him it is as unmoral an act as the folding up of leaves and blossoms at night. On overcoming torpor see A. iv. 86.\n\n\\(^3\\) See \u00a7 429.\n\n\\(^4\\) In its primary meaning kukkuccam is fidgeting, bad deportment of hands and feet. See Jat. i. 119; ii. 142; also Sum. i. 1, 2. Hence mental fidget, the worry of scruple (lit., \u2018the little sharp stone in a man\u2019s shoe.\u2019 See Skeat\u2019s English Dictionary), the over-sensitive, over-scrupulous conscience. In the frequent cases of kukkuccam, respecting the keeping of the rules of the Order, given in the Vinaya\u2014\u2018tassa kukkuccam ahosi\u2019\u2014or kukkuccayanto\u2014no blame seems to have attached to the person in question. There was weakness in the anxiety\nConsciousness of what is lawful in something that is unlawful; consciousness of what is unlawful in something that is lawful; consciousness of what is immoral in something that is moral; consciousness of what is moral in something that is immoral\u2014all this sort of worry, fidgeting, over-scrupulousness, remorse of conscience, mental scarifying\u2014this is what is called worry.\n\nNow this is the excitement and this is the worry which are what is called 'the Hindrance of excitement and worry.'\n\n[1162] What is the Hindrance of ignorance?\n\nAnswer as for 'dulness,' \u00a7 1061.\n\n[1163] Which are the states that are not Hindrances?\n\nEvery state, good, bad and indeterminate, which is not included in the foregoing [six] states, whether it relates to the worlds of sense, of form, or of the formless, or to the life that is Unincluded; in other words, the four skandhas; all form also, and uncompounded element.\n\nWhich are the states that are\n\n[1164] (a) favourable to the Hindrances?\n\nfelt by the non-robust conscience as to the letter of the law; on the other hand, there was loyalty to the Master's decrees. Even the great S\u0101riputta was not above such scruples, when, on falling ill at a rest-house, he declined to take food, in accordance with the 31st P\u0101cittiya rule (Vin. iv. 70). But Buddhaghosa quotes this as an instance of praiseworthy scruple, to be distinguished, as 'Vinaya-kukkuccam,' from the after-flush of burning anguish (anut\u0101po) accompanying the consciousness of having done amiss, a feeling that is no longer possible for an arahat. Asl. 384. Cf. below, \u00a7 1304.\n\n1 Things lawful (kappiya\u1e41) and unlawful are explained as here referring merely to rules of routine in the Order, e.g., to kinds of food, the dinner-hour, etc. By things moral and immoral (avajjam, etc.) are meant acts of virtue and of vice.

This fundamental notion in Buddhist ethics is in the Cy. (pp. 450 and 385), paraphrased by the words 'they take violently, i.e., they take hold with a strong grasp' (bhusa\u1e43 adiyanti . . . dalhag\u0101ha\u1e43 gahanti), the prefix upa being credited with augmentative import as in other terms, such as up\u0101y\u0101so and upakkuttho. This shows that, in so far as Buddhaghosa gives the traditional sense, the word, in the Buddhism of his day, connoted rather the dynamic force of 'grasping' than the static condition of 'attachment' (cf., Warren, 'Buddhism in Translations,' p. 189 et seq.) or 'cleaving' (Hardy, 'Manual,' 394). Nor does his comment ratify such renderings as 'Hang' or 'Lebenstrieb' (Neumann, 'Die Reden Gotamo Buddhos,' pp. 104, 470). Fausb\u00f6ll's 'seizures' (S. N. in S. B. E., x., p. 138) and Oldenberg's 'Ergreifen' ('Buddha,' 3rd ed., 269), on the other hand, agree with Buddhaghosa.\n\nThe relation of the cognate term up\u0101d\u0101niyo to up\u0101d\u0101nam (cf. \u00a7\u00a7 655, 881, 1219) is most clearly set forth in S. iv. 89; there the special senses are termed up\u0101d\u0101niy\u0101 dhamm\u0101, and the passionate desire connected therewith the up\u0101d\u0101nam. See also S. iv. 258. Buddhaghosa makes no comment on up\u0101d\u0101niyam when, as in \u00a7 1219, it is applied to dhamm\u0101; but when it is a question of r\u016bpam . . . up\u0101d\u0101niyam (Dh. S., \u00a7\u00a7 655, 881), he defines this as 'states which are favourable to (hit\u0101, lit., good for) the Graspings as objects by their\nThe four Graspings:\u2014the Grasping after sense, the Grasping after speculative opinion, the Grasping after mere rule and ritual, the Grasping after a theory of soul.\n\nIn this connexion,\n\n[1214] What is the Grasping after sense?\n\nThat sensual desire, sensual passion, sensual delight, sensual craving, sensual cleaving, sensual fever, sensual languishing, sensual rapacity, which is excited by the pleasures of the senses.\\(^1\\)\n\n[1215] What is the Grasping after speculative opinion?\n\n'There is no such thing as alms, or sacrifice, or offering;\\(^2\\) there is neither fruit, nor result of good, or of evil deeds; there is no such thing as this world, or the next;\\(^3\\) there is no such thing as mother or father, or beings springing into birth without them;\\(^4\\) there are in the world no recluses or brahmans who have reached the highest point, who have attained the height, who, having understood and being bound up with grasping; in other words, phenomena which are the conditions of the mental objects of grasping' (up\u0101d\u0101nassa \u0101ramma\u1e47a-paccaya-bh\u016bt\u0101ni). Asl. 42.\n\nIn the same connexion, r\u016bpam up\u0101dinna\u1e41 (Dh. S., \u00a7 653) is by Buddhaghosa defined as [states] which have been got, laid hold of, taken (gahit\u0101), by way of fruition\u2014heaped up by karma having the property of craving. Ibid. None of the comments explains up\u0101d\u0101nam in the sense of fuel, i.e., as the basis of re-birth; each of the four Up\u0101d\u0101nas is paraphrased simply by to grasp at sense (k\u0101mam up\u0101diyati), at speculation, etc.\n\n\\(^1\\) See \u00a7 1114 and \u00a7 1097; also \u00a7 1153.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Cy. explains these negations as merely meaning that none of the three has an efficacy, any fruition.

Asl. 386. Contrast with this \u00a7\u00a7 1173 n., 1134 n., and 1112 n., where in every case \u2018sense,\u2019 \u2018sensuality\u2019 and \u2018sensual desire\u2019 are in the Cy. said to succumb in the Third or An\u0101g\u0101mi\u2019s Path.\n[Chapter XIII.\n\nThe Group on the Corruptions (kilesa-gocchakam).]\n\n[1229] Which are the states that have the attribute of corruption?\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 On the term kilesa the Cy. is silent. It is true that the word lies as near to the Buddhist believer as 'sin' to the Christian. As a rule, however, Buddhaghosa is too Socratic to accept familiar terms without examination. In this case he has confined his attention to the derivatives. Incidentally, however\u2014in discussing the meaning of 'good' (above, \u00a7 1; Asl. 62)\u2014he makes spiritual health to consist in the absence of kilesa-disease, showing that kilesa was co-extensive with evil or the absence of moral good. Of the derivatives, only sankilittha is made to convey the idea of impurity or foulness (see Childers, s.v. sankileso), bad butter being so termed (Asl. 319). Elsewhere it is paraphrased as 'possessed of sankileso,' while sankilesa (above, \u00a7\u00a7 993-995; Asl. 42) is defined in close agreement with the description of sankle\u00e7a in B\u00f6hl and Roth (qu\u00e4len, bel\u00e4stigen): 'the meaning is to trouble, to torment,' while the corresponding adjective is described as 'deserving sankilesa by persistently making self the object of one's thoughts ... the term being an equivalent for those things which are the conditions (or objects) of sankilesa.' Corruption or impurity is, however, I believe, approximately what this group of terms represents to modern Buddhists; nor have I been able to select an English word adequate to render them in what seems to have been their first intention, viz., 'torment' (caused by moral unsoundness).

Of the eight modes of Buddhist vijj\u0101, viz.: knowledge born of insight (vipassana\u00f1\u0101nam), the potency (iddhi) of the 'mental image,' and the six forms of intuition (abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101)\u2014the first only is here referred to (cf. D. i., p. 76 et seq., and Childers, s.vv.). The reader will remember that vijj\u0101 is a term borrowed by Buddhist ethics from Brahmanic doctrine. Cf. the expression tisso vijj\u0101, p. 358. It is almost equivalent to our 'lore.' Six states are in the Anguttara (iii. 334) said to be vijj\u0101-bh\u0101giy\u0101.\n3 Ignorance respecting the Four Truths. Asl. 51.\n4 This and the following simile are gone into at some length (Asl. 388), as follows: Stage 1. The traveller sets out in the gloom. 2. He loses his way. 3. Lightning flashes out and illumines. 4. The road is made plain again. So to the 'noble' disciple there is: (1) the inception of insight making for the first (second or third) Paths; (2) the obliteration of truth by darkness; (3) the glory of\nThe science\\(^1\\) of the three lowest of the Noble Paths.\n\n(b) *the likeness of the thunderbolt*?\n\nThe science of the topmost Path, the Path of Arahatship.\n\n[1300, 1301] Which are the states that are\n\n(a) *foolish*?\\(^2\\)\n\nUnconscientiousness and disregard of blame.

But in the thunderbolt of the might of Arahatship won we get the simile of (a) an all-penetrating power, (b) the mystery of its coming. *Cf.* that of the wind as applied to Regeneration, John iii. 8.\n\n\\(^1\\) Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, elsewhere rendered \u2018wisdom.\u2019 See \u00a7 17 and *cf.* n. 3. \u2018Science\u2019 is here to be understood, not so much in its modern sense of organized knowledge and organized methods of investigation and verification for the attaining and establishing that knowledge, as in the Platonic and Aristotelian sense of \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7, or the intellectual antithesis to *opinion*.\n\n\\(^2\\) B\u0101l\u0101, its opposite being pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101, which partakes of pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101. See \u00a7 16, where the substantival form, pa\u1e47\u1e0diccam, is rendered \u2018erudition,\u2019 and paraphrased (Asl. 147) as pa\u1e47\u1e0ditassa bh\u0101vo, the state of a *wise* person, one who has discernment, discretion, one who has \u2018chosen that good part\u2019 as contrasted with the \u2018average sensual person\u2019 or foolish youth.

(*Cf.* \u2018Questions of King Milinda,\u2019 i. 284, n. 2.)\nWhich are the states that\n\n(a) conduce to remorse?\n\nMisconduct in act, word and thought. Besides, all bad states conduce to remorse.\n\n(b) do not conduce to remorse?\n\nGood conduct in act, word and thought. Besides, no good states conduce to remorse.\n\nWhich are the states that are synonymous?\n\n1 Tapaniy\u0101. Whereas we, in 'remorse,' bring into relief the 'ayenbite of inwyt,' the Buddhist term refers to the flush of heat when the deed ill done is realized as such.\n\n2 This and the subjects of the two following questions are adhivacan\u0101, nirutti and pa\u00f1\u00f1att\u012b respectively. The three are said (Asl. 51) to 'converge in meaning' (atthato ninnakara\u1e47\u0101), though their form is diverse. In the phrase 'An increaser of luck is an increaser of wealth' the terms are mutually delimitated. This is adhivacanam. . . . In the phrase 'They construct (or combine, abhisankharonti), brethren, and are therefore \"syntheses,\"' there is a statement of fact together with the cause, as in discourse (abhil\u0101p\u0101). . . . In the phrase 'the ratiocination, conception, disposition [of the mind]' (see above, \u00a7 7), something is set out on this wise or that; and this is pa\u00f1\u00f1att\u012b.\n\nIt seems inferable from the foregoing that by adhivacanam a simple equipollence of terms is to be effected. 'Is' or 'are,' in translating, must be understood simply as =, and not as implying inclusion under a more general notion. The word occurs at every turn in the Cy., and has usually been rendered, in these footnotes, 'equivalent to.' Cf. a good instance in J\u0101t. i. 117; Div. 491.\n\nThe second example and the comment adumbrate what we mean by explanation. But in the absence of the context it is not easy to gather much respecting pa\u00f1\u00f1att\u012b from the third passage cited. Coming to the answer common to all three questions, the Cy. instances as the things which are classed (sankh\u0101), designated (sama\u00f1\u00f1\u0101), expressed, and current (voh\u0101ro) the names 'I,' 'another,'\nThat which is an enumeration, that which is a designation, an expression, a current term, a name, a denomination, the assigning of a name, an interpretation, a distinctive mark of discourse on this or that state.\n\n[1306a] All states are processes of synonymous nomenclature.\n\n[1307] Which are the states that are interpretative?\nAnswer as in \u00a7 1306.\n\n[1307a] All states are processes of interpretation.\n\n[1308] Which are the states that are expressions?\nAnswer as in \u00a7 1306.\n\n[1308a] All states are processes of expression.\n\nIn this connexion,\n\n[1309] What is name?\u00b9\n\n'a man,' 'cattle,' 'Tisso,' 'a bed,' 'a house,' etc. Name is fourfold from the point of view of the grounds on which it is bestowed, viz.: (1) given by general consent on a special occasion (s\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1a-n\u0101ma\u1e41), e.g., that of the first King Mah\u0101sammato; (2) given because of a personal quality (gu\u1e47a-n\u0101ma\u1e41), e.g., versed-in-the-Vinaya; (3) given because of a private wish or fancy (kittimana\u1e41), e.g., naming of an infant; (4) not given; of primeval origin; primordially fortuitous (opap\u0101tika-n\u0101ma\u1e41), e.g., 'moon,' 'earth,' etc. See further \u00a7 1309, n.\n\nProcesses of nomenclature, etc. = adhivacanapatha, etc.\n\nThere is no being, no compound, concludes the Commentator, that is not somehow nameable.

N\u0101ma must, namely, be understood as opap\u0101tika-name, that is, all its constituents\nThe four skandhas and uncompounded element.\n\n[1310] What is form?\nThe four great phenomena and the form which is derived from them.\\(^1\\)\n\n[1311] What is ignorance?\nAnswer as for 'dulness,' \u00a7 390 (omitting 'on that occasion').\\(^2\\)\n\n[1312] What is the craving for renewed existence?\nAnswer as for the 'Fetter of the passion for renewed existence,' \u00a7 1120.\n\n[1313] What is speculative opinion about renewed existence?\nTheories that both soul and world will be re-born, etc.\n\n[1314] What is speculative opinion about existence not being renewed?\nTheories that both soul and world will not be re-born, etc.\n\nmust be so understood. Feeling, e.g., when it arises, is not named on the grounds on which a new individual, or an 'artificial kind'\u2014table, etc.\u2014might be named. 'One has not to take a name for it, saying, \"Be thou called feeling!\" The name has arisen together with it' (p. 392).\n\n'Uncompounded element' is here spoken of again a Nirvana. Ibid. See above, p. 166, n. 1.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. \u00a7 584. The more concise form of question: tattha katamam... is now sustained till the end. Hitherto it has only been used to cross-question the student on the details of a given answer, on 'name,' for instance, as part of the contents of the preceding answer. Hence the translation of tattha by 'in this connexion' (whatever the term in question may mean elsewhere). It is not clear, however, what is the force of tattha in these last fifty-seven questions, the greater part of the subjects not having occurred in the foregoing part of the manual.\n\n\\(^2\\) This pair of questions 'is included to show' how the mass of views in the following pairs is 'an upgrowth from the root of the Round of Re-birth.' Asl. 392.\n[1315] What is the sort of speculation known as Eternalism?\nThat both soul and world are eternal, etc.\n\n[1316] What is the sort of speculation known as Annihilation?\nThat both soul and world will be dissolved, etc.\n\n[1317] What is the sort of speculation known as the Finite Theory . . .

Of these, the first two (bhava and vibhava) are, in the Cy. (p. 392), connected with the next two respectively (cf. \u00a7 1099). All the eight are enumerated and discussed in the Brahmaj\u0101la Sutta. D. i. 13-40. The Cy. itself refers to this Sutta in connexion with the last two theories. See also 'Dialogues of the Buddha,' i. 26, n. 3.\n[1323] What is conscientiousness?\nThe feeling of conscientious scruple when scruples ought to be felt, conscientious scruple at attaining to bad and evil states.\n\n[1324] What is the fear of blame?\nThe sense of guilt where a sense of guilt ought to be felt, a sense of guilt at attaining to bad and evil states.\\(^1\\)\n\n[1325] What is contumacy?\\(^2\\)\nThe being surly, refractious, contumacious when that which is in accordance with the Law has been said, contrariness, captiousness, want of regard, of consideration, of reverence, of deference.\\(^3\\)\n\n[1326] What is friendship with evil?\nTo follow after, to frequent the company of, and associate with,\\(^4\\) such persons as are unbelievers, immoral, uneducated, mean-spirited\\(^5\\) and witless;\\(^6\\) to resort to and consort with\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See \u00a7\u00a7 30, 31.\n\\(^2\\) Dovacassata. For \u2018surly\u2019 the Cy. (p. 393) and K. read dovacass\u0101yam.\n\\(^3\\) The three first terms in the answer are in the original simply different forms of the same abstract noun, viz.: dovacass\u0101yam, dovacassiyam, dovacassata. The fourth term is literally \u2018taking the opposite side.\u2019 The fifth is literally \u2018gratification in antagonism.\u2019 The last is described as due to a lack of the habit of placing others before one\u2019s self. Asl. 393. The term in question the Cy. finally dismisses with the remark that, if persisted in in the foregoing fashion, it involves the four skandhas, especially that of syntheses.

In the sense of devotion bhatti does not, I believe, occur in the Nik\u0101yas. Perhaps its oldest appearance with this import is in J\u0101t. v. 340\u2014where the Cy. gives as equivalent sineho\u2014and in the Svet.

On \u2018skill\u2019 or \u2018proficiency\u2019 (kusalat\u0101) see Introduction viii., on \u2018good.\u2019\n(a) the Offences termed the Five Groups of Offences and the Seven Groups of Offences;\u00b9\n(b) restoration from [the effects of] those Offences;\u00b2\n(c) a case of Attainment\u00b3 where \u2018conception works and thought discursive,\u2019 a case of Attainment \u2018wherein is no working of conception, but only of thought discursive,\u2019 a case of Attainment \u2018void of the working of conception and of thought discursive\u2019;\n(d) recovery from those Attainments.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 That is, the group of \u2018\u0100patti\u2019s termed Par\u0101jika, Sa\u1e45gh\u0101disesa, P\u0101cittiya, P\u0101tidesan\u012bya and Dukka\u1e6da offences, and the group which, besides these, includes Thullaccaya and Dubbhasita offences. Asl. 394; cf. Vin. v. 91. The scientific procedure is described in the Cy. as -pariccheda-j\u0101nana-pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101.\n\n\u00b2 \u0100patti-vu\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na, or rising up from an offence. Buddhaghosa does not in this connexion explain the term, but in his Cy. on the passage, found in nearly identical words at Vin. iii. 112, and iv. 225 (which Cy. is found in Minayeff, P\u0101t. 69), he uses vu\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na as a general term covering all the three methods (pariv\u0101sa, m\u0101natta, abbh\u0101na) of expiation of, and release from, an offence committed by a member of the Order. Cf. Childers, s.v. sa\u1e45gh\u0101diseso; Vin. v. 118. See also infra, \u00a7 1332.\n\n\u00b3 The Sam\u0101pattis, or various stages of self-concentration, include the Jh\u0101nas\u2014as here\u2014and other forms of sam\u0101dhi, all pre-Buddhistic and all utilized in the body of Buddhist doctrine and culture. It is noteworthy that they are not here referred to as only eight in number\u2014see Childers, s.v. (for that matter, neither do they find a place in the Atthaka-nip\u0101ta of the Anguttara). Neither is it clear that the three Sam\u0101pattis quoted in the answer coincide in all respects with the first three stages of five-fold Jh\u0101na. If they do, and if we are to assume that the term includes more than those three stages, then, by Subh\u016bti\u2019s inclusion of four Vimokhas, this would give us nine sam\u0101pattis. Again, in M. i. 301, a fifth Vimokha\u2014the last\u2014is spoken of as a Sam\u0101patti, this bringing the number up to ten. Cf.

Of these, all but the fifth are exercised on mundane objects of thought; penetration is concerned with supramundane matters; attention and comparison can be exercised about\nWhat is skill in the 'Conditioned Geneses'?\n\nScience, understanding, etc., when applied to the formula: 'The syntheses come to pass because of ignorance; cognition comes to pass because of syntheses; name and form come to pass because of cognition; the sixfold sphere comes to pass because of name and form; contact comes to pass because of the sixfold sphere, feeling because of contact, craving because of feeling, grasping because of craving, renewed existence because of grasping, birth because of renewed existence, old age and death, grief, lamentation, distress, melancholy and despair come to pass because of birth.

Asl. 395.\n\nThis species of skill (th\u0101nakusalat\u0101, atth\u0101nakusalat\u0101) constituted one of the Ten Powers of the Buddha. See M. i. 69. The Cy.

Ajjavo, javano, maddavo, khanti and soraccam are, in A. iii. 248, given as the dharm\u0101 of a thoroughbred horse.\n\n\\(^2\\) Temperance (soraccam) is defined as \u2018to be well on the hither side of wickedness,\u2019 to avoid transgression in the three kinds in deed, in the four kinds in speech and in one\u2019s mode of livelihood. See Rhys Davids, \u2018Manual of Buddhism,\u2019 p. 142. The three transgressions of the mind are omitted, hence soraccam applies apparently only to the self-expression of the individual.

Buddhaghosa\u2019s comment obviates the necessity either for Kern\u2019s hypothesis that the word, when applied to speech, should be read as ka\u1e47\u1e0daka, or for that of Morris, that it should be read as candaka. He says (Asl. 396): Just as in a defective (sadose) tree bosses (andak\u0101ni; excrescences, warts) protrude, so through faultiness, by words of bragging and insolence, are swellings (andaka) produced.\n\n\\(^i\\) Disagreeable\u2019 (as\u0101t\u0101) is omitted in the M. i. 286.\nupon anger, not conducive to concentration, is put away, and when all such speech as is innocuous,\\(^1\\) pleasant to the ear,\\(^2\\) affectionate, such as goes to the heart, is urbane,\\(^3\\) sweet and acceptable to people generally\u2014when speech of this sort is spoken\u2014polished, friendly and gentle language\u2014this is what is called amity.\n\n[1344] What is courtesy?\n\nThe two forms of courtesy: hospitality towards bodily needs and considerateness in matters of doctrine. When anyone shows courtesy it is in one or other of these two forms.\\(^4\\)\n\n[1345] What is it to have the door of the faculties unguarded?\\(^5\\)\n\n\u2018Grating\u2019 = kakkas\u0101 = (Asl. *ibid.*) p\u016btik\u0101. By a somewhat forced figure grating or rasping speech is compared to the disagreeable sensation in the ear (sot\u0101m not kan\u00f1\u0101!) by the entrance of the crumbling pulverous tissue of a rotten tree. \u2018Vituperative,\u2019 etc. (par\u0101bhissajjani); as it were, a lurking branch of barbed thorns wounding the limbs and obstructing passage. *Ibid.*\n\n\\(^1\\) Innocuous = nel\u0101 = niddos\u0101. Asl. 397.\n\n\\(^2\\) *I.e.*, by varied sweetness.\n\n\\(^3\\) Por\u012b, *i.e.*, town-conversation, either because it is full of good points (guna), or used by persons of breeding, or simply urban. For town-dwellers use fitting terms, calling a father a father and a brother a brother. *Ibid.*\n\n\\(^4\\) Patisanth\u0101ro, both \u0101misena and dhammena, is discussed at length by Buddhaghosa (Asl. 397-399). He takes, as usual, the etymology of the term\u2014a spreading out or diffusion\u2014and shows it as a covering or closing, through kindness and generosity, of the gap there may be between the having of the giver and the recipient of his attentions. Both are supposed to be members of the Order, and many of the hospitable and polite ministrations described occur in Vin. ii. 210, 211. See also Mil. 409.\n\n\\(^5\\) Aguttadv\u0101rata. This and the contrary attitude in \u00a7 1347 constitute an important formula in Buddhist doctrine, and occur in D. i. 70, M. i. 180, 269, etc. It is also quoted K.V. 426, 464.\nWhen a certain individual\\(^1\\) sees an object with the eye\\(^2\\) he is entranced with the general appearance, or in the details of it.\\(^3\\) He does not set himself to restrain that which might give occasion for wicked states, covetous, dejected, to flow in over him, were he to dwell unrestrained as to the sense of sight.

He does not set himself to restrain that which might give occasion for wicked states, covetous, dejected, to flow in over him, were he to dwell unrestrained as to the mental faculty. He keeps no watch over the mental faculty, nor does he attain to mastery over it. That these six faculties should be thus\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) K. omits puggalo, given in the printed text. The latter omits it in the corresponding answer, \u00a7 1347.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is a passage naturally calling for psychological qualification from the Commentator (Asl.399, 400). \u201cEye\u201d stands here for the total efficient cause (k\u0101rana-vasena), namely, for that visual cognition which is the generally accepted form-seeing capacity. As the Ancients have said: The eye does not see form, not being of the nature of intellect (cittan); the intellect, not being of the nature of eye, does not see form (the Cy. has here been wrongly punctuated). One sees with the sense-embodied mind impingeing on the \u2018door-object\u2019 (dv\u0101r\u0101ramma\u1e47e sa\u1e41ghattanena pas\u0101davatthukena cittena passati), that is, with the aggregate organism, or apparatus, as when we say, \u201che shoots with the bow.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) On nimittag\u0101hi and anuvya\u00f1jana-g\u0101hi, see notes relating precisely to this passage in D. i. 70, in \u2018Dialogues of the Buddha,\u2019 i. 80. The former term is, in the Atthasa\u1e45giti, defined as the act of one who, not content with simply beholding what is attractive and so forth, or what is characteristically female or male, grasps at it with passionate desire.\nunguarded, untended, unwatched over, unrestrained, is what is called having the door of the faculties unguarded.\n\n[1346] What is immoderation in diet?\u00b9\n\nWhen anyone, through carelessness and without judgment, takes food\u00b2 for purposes of sport,\u00b3 sensual excess, personal charm and adornment, his insatiableness, immoderation, and want of judgment are what is called immoderation in diet.\n\n[1347] What is it to have the doors of the faculties guarded?\n\nWhen a certain individual sees an object with the eye he is not entranced with the general appearance or the details of it. He sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for wicked states, covetous, dejected, to flow in over him, were he to dwell unrestrained as to the sense of sight. He keeps watch over this faculty of sight, and attains to mastery over it. And so in like manner, when he hears a sound with the ear . . . smells an odour with the nose . . . tastes a sapid with the tongue . . . feels a tangible with the body . . . recognises an idea with the mind, he is not entranced with the general appearance and the details of it. He sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for wicked states, covetous, dejected, to flow in over him, were he to dwell unrestrained as to the mental faculty. He keeps watch over the mental faculty, and attains to mastery over it. That these six faculties should be thus guarded, tended, watched over,\n\n\u00b9 Bhojane amatta\u00f1\u00f1ut\u0101 = a sustained indulging without reflection . . . the ignoring of measure or bounds therein.

The comments in the Asl. reveal a more specific and less sublime interpretation of the vedan\u0101 in question than is taken by the translator of the last-named passage (Rhys Davids, \u2018Questions of King Milinda,\u2019 ii. 231). According to the former, pur\u0101na\u00f1 ca vedan\u0101m is simply that due to one\u2019s not having dined, and nava\u00f1 ca vedan\u0101m to one\u2019s having dined too much, or to one\u2019s having dined. Asl. 403, 404. Psychologically then, the ideal state of one relieved of the craving of appetite would seem to be, not the positive sensations of surfeit or of having well dined, but the relatively negative state of not-hungry, not-thirsty. Under \u2018comfort\u2019 (ph\u0101suvih\u0101ro = bhoj\u0101nisamso) gourmands, who fail to acquire the same, are described, with some gusto, under five current sobriquets\u2014\u2018Hold, waistcoat!\u2019 \u2018Gyrator\u2019 (because unable to rise after eating), etc. Abstemious procedure is also categorized otherwise and in detail. Asl. 404.\n\n\u2074 In this answer (describing mutthasaccam) the text requires some emendation. Anussati should be asati, and the privative a should of course be dropped in a-pil\u0101panat\u0101, a-sammussanat\u0101.

This is not included in any set of 'powers' enumerated in the present work (cf. \u00a7 1, etc.), nor does it form part of pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101balam (\u00a7 29). However, it is included in the eight very different kinds of powers given in A. iv. 223, ranking as the specific balam of the erudite or bahussuto. Cf. the use of pati-sankh\u0101 in Vin. i. 218. In the present connexion it seems as a correlative term to have superseded dassanam (insight); see above, \u00a7\u00a7 1002-1012, 1254-1267.\n\n3 See \u00a7\u00a7 285, 287, etc.\n\n4 In this and the following references the phrase 'on that occasion' must be understood to be omitted.\n[1357] What is 'the mark of composure'?\u00b9\nAnswer as for 'quiet,' \u00a7 1357.\n\n[1358] What is 'the mark of grasp'?\nAnswer as for 'grasp' and 'energy,' \u00a7\u00a7 56, 13.\n\n[1359] What is grasp?\nAnswer as for 'the mark of grasp,' \u00a7 1358.\n\n[1360] What is balance?\nAnswer as for 'balance,' \u00a7 57.\n\n[1361] What is moral failure?\u00b2\nExcess in deed, excess in word, excess in both together.

Purity in theory would seem to indicate perfection relative to progress in theory, while in moral matters a similar distinction does not apparently hold. The Cy. only explains this want of distinction by saying that in \u00a7 1363 the s\u012bla of restraint of the P\u0101timokkha is alluded to, while in \u00a7 1365 visuddhi-s\u012bla is spoken of.\n\n\\(^3\\) K. reads here kammassakata\u1e41 n\u0101nam\u2014a curious phrase. Buddhaghosa, to judge by his exposition, reads kamma-ssakata-\u00f1\u0101nam (Asl. 406, 407) or -ssakata-, or -ssakata\u1e41 n\u0101nam (Asl. 406). The corresponding adjective to this sakat\u0101 or sakata\u1e41 occurs in the passage quoted from the Sutta Pitaka by N\u0101gasena (Mil. i. 45; cf. Rhys Davids\u2019 trans., i. 101, n. 1; also Asl. 66), namely, kammassak\u0101 (satt\u0101); i.e., according to the translator\u2019s view, \u2018having each their own karma.\u2019 As this passage occurs in the yet inedited 135th Sutta of the Majjhima N., the Papa\u00f1ca S\u016bdan\u012b may prove to have a more lucid commentary on it than that given in the Atthas\u0101lin\u012b. The latter is to this effect: [This phrase means] the science of knowing that this karma (or action) is sakam, that karma is not sakam. In this connexion all bad kamma, whether it be done by one\u2019s self or by another, is not sakam. How so? Because it destroys utility and creates disutility. But good karma, which has the reverse effect, is named sakam. Just as a man with a full purse in the course of a journey\nof the Truths in their due order; the knowledge of him who holds the Path; the knowledge of him who holds the Fruit of the Path.\n\n(i.) The phrase 'Now purity of theory' is equivalent to that science, understanding... right theory (views) [described above, \u00a7 16].\n\n(ii.) In the phrase 'And as the struggle of him who holds certain views,' struggle means that inception of energy etc. [described above, \u00a7 13].\n\nmay stop at various cities where festivals are going on and, determining what votive outlay he will make, takes part accordingly in those festivals as his inclination prompts, and safely emerges from the jungle, even so do beings who are established in this knowledge of the sak\u0101nam of karma, when they have heaped up much karma making for transmigration, safely and at ease attain arahatship, even to the extent of numbers innumerable.\n\nNow if sak\u0101nam mean here, as it usually does, 'one's own,' that still seems no explanation of the assertion that one's bad actions are not one's own. And how does the parable bear out the assertion?\n\n1 With the foregoing question and answer the catechism proper of the 'Dhamma Sanga\u1e47i' comes to an end. There follow eleven sundry phrases or terms, not made the subject of any part of the catechism, and appended here in the phraseology of a commentary. They are severally either referred to some reply in the catechism, or briefly expounded, and are probably all culled from the Sutta Pitaka as technicisms of Buddhist ethics. Very possibly they form one connected sentence, giving an eloquent and concise description of the nature of Wisdom and Emancipation. Buddhaghosa has nothing very enlightening on this fraction of ancient commentary included in the text, but promises an explanation of at least the division of the subject of 'agitation' in the Commentary on the 'Vibhanga.'\n\n2 Yath\u0101 ditthissa ca padh\u0101nam. It is just possible one should read Yath\u0101ditthissa; K., however, divides the two words. The Cy. merely remarks that the energy put forth is intelligent or scientific, and can be applied either to worldly or to higher things.\n(iii.) The phrase 'agitation' implies dread of birth, dread of old age, dread of sickness, dread of death.\n\n(iv.) The phrase 'occasion of agitation' means birth, old age, sickness, death.\n\n(v.) The phrase 'And the earnest struggle of him who is agitated' refers to [the four Right Struggles]:\u2014When a bhikkhu brings forth the desire (a) that bad and wicked states which have not arisen should not arise, (b) that bad and wicked states which have arisen should be put away, (c) that good states which have not arisen should arise, (d) that good states which have arisen should stand firm, should not get confused, should be frequently practised, made to abound, cultivated, and perfected\u2014then he uses endeavour, sets energy a-going, reaches forward in thought and struggles.\\(^1\\)\n\n(vi.) The phrase 'And discontent in good states' means the longing for higher achievement in one who is dissatisfied over the cultivation of good states.\\(^2\\)\n\n(vii.) The phrase 'And the not shrinking back in the struggle' means the thorough and persevering and unresting performance, the absence of stagnation, the unfaltering volition, the unflinching endurance,\\(^3\\) the assiduous pursuit, exercise and repetition which attend the cultivation of good states.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See A. ii. 15, 16, 74. It will be seen that the four modes of will-culture described on p. 15 of A. ii. as the Sammapadhb\u0101n\u0101ni (and quoted in the Dh. S.) are, on p. 74, termed respectively the Struggles for Self-control, for Renunciation, for Cultivation (or Development) and for Preservation. Yet on p. 16 a different connotation is given to each of these four terms.\n\n\\(^2\\) This and the next phrase (vii.) occur consecutively in A. i. 50. The progress of sublime discontent in a pious individual from giving small donations to the Order, then greater gifts till he personally enters the Order and finally wins the goal of Arahatship, is briefly described, Asl. 407. The last attainment gives the winner the title of the Greatly Content.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. \u00a7 13.\n(viii.) The phrase 'Wisdom' means the threefold wisdom, namely (a) reminiscent knowledge of one's former births, (b) knowledge of the relapse and renascence of beings, (c) the knowledge that makes an end of the Intoxicants.\n\n(ix.) The phrase 'Emancipation' means the twofold emancipation, namely, (a) detachment of thought,\\(^1\\) and (b) Nirvana.\\(^2\\)\n\n(x.) The phrase 'knowledge in making an end' means the knowledge he has who holds the Path.\n\n(xi.) The phrase 'knowledge in origins' means the knowledge he has who holds the Fruit of the Path.\n\nEnd of the Division entitled 'Elimination.'\n\n\\(^1\\) Cittassa ca adhimutti=vimutti (emancipation). D. i. 174.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is, I believe, the only passage in the original Manual where the word occurs. This is interesting in view of the fact that it occurs in what appears to be an appendix of original Commentary, and also that the term occurs so frequently in the old digest which follows in the text. See Appendix I.\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nThe Digest, or Condensed Paraphrase of Book III. (\u00a7\u00a7 981-1295), entitled Division of Exposition, or the Elucidation (atthuddh\u0101ro).\n\nImmediately following the text of the Dhammasanga\u1e47i itself is a supplement of some 230 questions and answers. The questions are verbatim those of the 'Elimination' Division, or Book III., taken in order, but without the cross-questioning on the details of the various lists of ethical factors or defects, such as the varieties of cause (hetu), or of the 'Intoxicants,' etc. The answers are for the most part more tersely worded than those in Book III., and couched in language more or less different, including several terms that came into technical use after the earliest ages of Buddhism.\n\nNo distinctive title is assigned to this supplement in the Manual itself. It is probable that the final announcement 'Dhamma-sanga\u1e47i-ppakara\u1e47i samatt\u0101' refers, not to it, but to the entire work. In the 'Atthas\u0101lin\u012b,' however (p. 409 et seq.), this section is pronounced to be commentary, not text, and is termed the Atthakath\u0101kandam, or expositional division; and in an earlier passage it was termed the fourth Vibhatti comprising the atthuddh\u0101ro (Asl. 6). The tradition is related that it is the work of S\u0101riputta, and was compiled by him with the object of making clearer the contents of the 'Nikkhepa-kandam' (Book III., i.e., virtually the whole Manual) to a pupil who could not otherwise understand it.\n\nThis being so, and the answers throwing no new light on\nto the subjects discussed, I have not thought it worth while to translate them. At the same time, it seemed advisable to sort out the specific, if not the individual, differences in diction, so that the reader may lose nothing that may prove of any value for the history either of the terms or of the concepts of Buddhism. I have also given translations of a few answers where the very difference in the terms used to obtain a virtually equivalent statement may prove helpful towards understanding the language of the Manual itself.\n\nIn respect of P\u0101li terms used, when there is need of referring collectively to the three modes, or worlds of all rebirth, as well as to that higher life of saintly aspiration, which is not concerned with rebirth, these four are no longer distinctively spoken of as the \u0101vacaram of this or that and the Unincluded, but are simply classed together as 'the four bh\u016bmis.'\n\nAgain, 'Nirvana' (nibb\u0101nam) invariably replaces the term 'uncompounded element.' See Appendix II.\n\n'Form' replaces 'all form' (see \u00a7 983 passim), and 'fruits of the life of the recluse' the word 'fruits of the Paths.' (See \u00a7 992 passim.) The latter variation occurs but once in the Manual itself, viz., at \u00a7 1016.\n\nFrequent allusion is now made to those 'types' of good and bad thoughts distinguished and analyzed by Book I. They are spoken of, not as citt\u0101ni, but as cittupp\u0101d\u0101, or genesis of thought, a term occurring only once in the Manual, viz., as a title. (See above, p. 164.)\n\nThe skandhas, so frequently adduced in Book III., are never mentioned.\n\nThe term 'co-Intoxicant' (s\u0101savo), is no longer used except in the analysis of the Intoxicant Group.\n\nThe very frequent use of the ablative in -to (when the\n\n---\n\n1 By an error presumably in the MSS., the printed text has, in \u00a7 1597, jh\u0101nabal\u0101ni for s\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1aphal\u0101ni. Cf. K.\n\n2 Printed above by an error as [1015].\nManual would use a substantival adjective\u2014for instance, k\u0101m\u0101vacara-kusalato instead of k\u0101m\u0101vacaram kusalam\u2014betrays the later idiom. The Manual itself uses this ablative, I believe, but twice, viz., in \u00a7\u00a7 1062, 1071: vip\u0101kato=as, or by way of, result.\n\nThe term kiriy\u0101, so seldom used in the Manual, is now used extremely often.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTaking now the three questions respecting (a) good, (b) bad, and (c) indeterminate states, with which Book III. (\u00a7\u00a7 981-983, and for that matter the Manual itself) opens, we read the following concise replies, taken in order:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(a) & \\text{ Good in the four planes (bhummisu).} \\\\\n(b) & \\text{ The twelve geneses of bad thought.} \\\\\n(c) & \\text{ Result in the four planes; completed indeterminates}\\footnote{Kiriy\u0101vy\u0101kata\u1e41. See Introduction viii.} \\text{ in the three planes;}\\footnote{I.e., excluding that of sense (see Book I., Part III., ch. ii.).} \\text{ form also and Nirvana.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow, on referring to the analysis of the twelve Types of bad states (Book I., Part I., ch. ii.), it will be seen that these cover the whole question, inasmuch as only one \u2018plane\u2019\u2014that of sensuous existence\u2014is involved. Good and indeterminate dhammas, on the other hand, involve all four planes, and cannot be answered simply in terms of the eight types of good thoughts (ch. i.) in the one case, nor of thought genesis in the other.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe next triad of questions (Book III., \u00a7\u00a7 984-986) is answered in language which occurs at only one other passage in the whole work (\u00a7 1268 et seq.), and which is of a vagueness that makes any equivalent rendering welcome.\n\n\u2018States associated with easeful feeling\u2019:\n\n\u2018The four geneses of thought accompanied by happiness, which belong to good (karma) in the sensuous universe.

Moho (dulness), however, is inexplicitly named as something the cause of which can be put away by neither.\n\n* * * * *\n\nQuestions 1022-1024 are answered in quite other terms than those there used:\n\n(a) 'States having limited objects of thought':\u2014\n\n'All result of sensuous existence; ideation that is completed action; representative cognition that is completed action but not free of causes,\\(^1\\) and is accompanied by happiness.'\n\n(b) 'States having objects of thought of wider scope':\u2014\n\n'The sphere of infinite intellect; the sphere where there\n\n\\(^1\\) Kiriy\u0101-hetuk\u0101 manovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47adh\u0101tu.\nis neither perception nor non-perception.'

This is the two triads corresponding to \u00a7\u00a7 1044-1049. The \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101 has the following:\n\n'States which are\n\n(a) personal (or subjective),\n(b) external,\n(c) personal-external.'\n\n'With the exception of form which is not bound up with\nfaculties,\\(^1\\) all states may be subjective or external or subjective-external. Form which is not bound up with faculties, and Nirvana are both external.'\n\n'States which have\n\n(a) a subjective object of thought,\n(b) an external object of thought,\n(c) a subjective-external object of thought':\u2014\n\n'(a) The sphere of infinite intellect and the sphere where there is neither perception nor non-perception.\n\n'(b) The threefold and fourfold Jh\u0101na relating to the heavens of Form, whether it arise as good (karma), as result (of good karma), or as completed thought, also results of Fourth Jh\u0101na, the sphere of infinite space, the four Paths that are the Unincluded and the four Fruits of the life of the recluse:\u2014these states have an external object of thought.\n\n'Excepting form, states, good, bad, and indeterminate relating to the sensuous universe, and the Fourth Jh\u0101na relating to the heavens of Form, whether it arise as good (karma), or as completed thought:\u2014all these may be either (a), (b), or (c).\n\n'But it is not proper to say that the sphere of nothingness is all three.\n\n'Form and Nirvana are without objects of thought.'\n\nThere is here a point of additional interest.\n\nThe second and fourth \u0100ruppajjh\u0101nas are shown to have been conceived as exercises of pure introspection, and to be devoid of any implications of a World-Reason, or a macrocosmic Perception, let alone any of the 'rapt soul' being caught up to other spheres.\n\n\\(^1\\) Read, for Manindriyam, Anindriya-baddha-r\u016bpa\u00f1 ca. By an oversight this sentence and the next are printed in the text as if belonging to the previous triad.\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nOn that which is predicted about Uncompounded Element (asankhat\u0101 dh\u0101tu) in the Dhamma Sanga\u1e47i.\n\nUncompounded Element is classed as the fourth and last species of the morally Indeterminate (avy\u0101kata\u1e41)\u2014in other words, of that conduct or state of mind which is not productive of good or bad karma. But it alone, of those four, does not receive separate and systematic discussion, as is the case with the other three\u2014Result, Kiriya, and Form. The following predicates are elicited incidentally in the course of Book III., which discusses what may be called Applied Ethics. Again, whereas the word Nirvana (nibb\u0101nam) is always substituted for asankhat\u0101 dh\u0101tu in that \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101 which is appended as a supplement to the original text, the term \u2018uncompounded element\u2019 is not identified, in the Dhamma Sanga\u1e47i, with the \u2018topmost fruit\u2019 of the Paths, the arahatta-phalam, which is one aspect of the state called Nirv\u0101\u1e47a (cf. S. iv. 251, 252). The subject therefore seems to demand further inquiry. It is to facilitate this that the following results are appended, parallel more or less to the table on Form, pp. 168-171. Cf. note, p. 166.\n\nUncompounded element is\n\n| Predicate                                      | Reference |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| indeterminate                                   | [983]     |\n| neither result nor productive of result         | [989]     |\n| neither the issue of grasping\\(^1\\) nor favourable to it\\(^2\\) | [992]     |\n| neither corrupt nor baneful                     | [995]     |\n\n\\(^1\\) Given also in [1212]. \\(^2\\) Given also in [1220].\n'void of the working of conception and of thought discursive'\nto be put away neither by insight nor by culture\nsomething the causes of which are to be put away neither by insight nor by culture\nthat which makes neither for the piling up nor for the undoing of re-birth\nneither appertaining nor not appertaining to studentship\ninfinite\nperfected\nthat which does not entail fixed consequences\ninvisible and non-impingeing\nnot a cause\nwithout causes as concomitants\nnot associated with a cause\nwithout material form\nsupra-mundane\nnot an Intoxicant\nnot co-Intoxicant\ndisconnected with the Intoxicants\nnot a Fetter\nunfavourable to the Fetters\ndisconnected with the Fetters\nnot a Tie\nnot that which tends to become tied\ndisconnected with the Ties\n\n1 Given also in [1269], [1271].\n2 Given also in [1258] et seq.\n3 In the printed text [1018].\n4 Repeated in [1291].\n5 Repeated in [1088] and [1090].\n6 [1082] combines [1072] and [1074].\n7 [1112] repeats [1104] and [1106].\n8 [1134] repeats [1126] and [1128].\n9 [1150] repeats [1142] and [1144].\nnot a Hindrance [1163]\ndisconnected with and unfavourable to the Hindrances [1173]\nnot a Contagion [1176]\ndisconnected with the Contagion and uninfected [1184]\nwithout concomitant object of thought [1186]\nnot of the intellect [1188]\nnot involved in the life of sense [1190]\ndisconnected with thought [1192]\ndetached from thought [1194]\nnot sprung from thought [1196]\nnot something coming into being together with thought [1198]\nnot consecutive to thought [1200]\nnot derived [1210]\nwithout the attribute of Grasping [1218]\ndisconnected with Grasping, and not favouring it [1228]\nwithout the attribute of corruption [1240]\nharmless [1242]\nnot corrupt [1243a]\ndisconnected with the Corruptions, and harmless [1253]\nnot joyous [1273]\nunaccompanied by joy [1275]\nunaccompanied by ease [1277]\nunaccompanied by disinterestedness [1279]\nUnincluded [1287]\nthat by which there is no going away [1289]\nsomething having no Beyond [1293]\nnot concomitant with war [1295]\n\nIn the Cy. on the Dh\u0101tu Kath\u0101 nibb\u0101nam (Nirvana) is always substituted for asankhato khandho.\n\nTHE END.\nINDEX OF PALI WORDS.\n\n[n is throughout printed for \u1e45.]\n\nAggi, 242\nAggahitattan, 300\nAjjava, 348\nAjhatika, 220\nAjhatta, 45, 207, 241, 272\nAjh\u0101sayo, 200\nAjhos\u0101na, 277\nAn\u00f1\u0101, 96\nAn\u00f1indriya, 97, 149\nAtth\u0101na, 348\nAndak\u0101, 349\nAttabh\u0101vo, 175, 207, lxi\nAttamanat\u0101, 12\nAttaniya, xxxvi\nAtt\u0101, 294.
