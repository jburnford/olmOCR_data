A. SKEEN, GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CEYLON.\n\n1881.\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nCEYLON BRANCH.\n\nHINDU ASTRONOMY:\nAS COMPARED WITH THE EUROPEAN SCIENCE.*\n\nBY S. MERVIN.\n\n(Read April 7th, 1881.)\n\nAstronomy was discovered and cultivated in the early period of the world. It spread from one country to another, and seems to have come from Chaldea to India and China.\n\nThe Rev. H. Hoisington, of the American Mission at Jaffna, in his work entitled The Oriental Astronomer, says:\u2014\"Chaldea may be considered as the cradle of astronomy. A series of observations was made at Babylon during a period of 1,903 years preceding the capture of that city by Alexander. This would carry back the origin of astronomy in Chaldea to at least 2,234 years before Christ.\"\n\n\"The Chinese possess the oldest authentic records of astronomical observations. They invented their cycle of 60 years as early as 2,900 years B.C., and they were able to predict (or calculate) the eclipses as early as 2,128 years B.C.\"\n\n\"The early part of Hindu astronomy is involved in great obscurity. The lunar mansions, or Nadechattirams, are the most ancient part of Hindu astronomy found on record. They date somewhere between the years 1528 and 1371 B.C.\"\n\n* The Society decline to be responsible for the statements of the author. The Paper is printed (in r\u00e9sum\u00e9) having been read at a General Meeting.\nTrue Hindu astronomy is very different from Hindu mythology. Some Europeans seem to think that the mythology and the astronomy of the Hindus are identical.\n\nHindu mythology is mingled with legends and exaggerations of poetry, which are utterly fantastic and absurdly false. But the true science of astronomy is found in other works which are really scientific, such as:\n\nBrahma Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nS\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nS\u00f3ma Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nVashda Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nR\u00f3maka Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \n\nViy\u00e1sa Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nP\u00f3sa Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nVar\u00e1ka Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nA'riya Siddh\u00e1ntam  \nSiddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani.\n\nThere are several other works among the Hindus on astronomy, but these are the important ones.\n\nI do not pretend to say that I have read all these books. I have read only two of them, from which I will give quotations and authorities, to prove that many of the doctrines of the Hindu science do perfectly correspond with those of the European science.\n\nThe 59th verse of the 1st chapter of S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam reads as follows:\n\n\"Twice 800 y\u00f3janas are the diameter of the earth; the square root of ten times the square of that is the earth's circumference.\"\n\nHere it is plainly said that the earth's diameter is 1,600 y\u00f3janas, which at 5 miles each* will give 8,000 miles,\n\n---\n\n* The measurement of the y\u00f3jana is not exactly settled. According to some authorities, it is equal to 16,000 yards; according to others, to 8,000 yards. The Chinese traveller Hieuen Thsang, who visited India in the middle of the 7th century, reports that in India, according to ancient tradition, a y\u00f3jana equalled 40 li (a li being about 550 yards). According to the customary use of the Indian kingdoms, it is 30 li. But the y\u00f3jana mentioned in the sacred books contains only 16 li; which smallest y\u00f3jana is equal to 5 English miles.\nand its circumference 25,298 miles. According to European science the diameter is 7,917 miles, and the circumference 24,856 miles, shewing a very close proximity to the Hindu calculation.\n\nAgain, the 52nd verse of the 3rd chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani reads thus:\u2014\n\n\"The circumference of the earth has been pronounced to be 4,967 y\u00f3janas, and the diameter of the same has been declared to be $1581\\frac{1}{24}$ y\u00f3janas.\"\n\nAccording to this, the diameter is $7,905\\frac{5}{24}$ miles, and the circumference 24,835 miles, which figures are very much nearer to the European than those given in S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1nta, the difference being very insignificant.\n\nII.\u2014According to Hindu mythology, the earth is a circular, flat body, supported by the serpent \"A't\u00edch\u00e9dan,\" &c.; but the 32nd verse of the 12th chapter of S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1n-tam says that the earth is a globe and a self-supporting body.\n\nThe same description is given in the 2nd verse of the 3rd chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani:\u2014\n\n\"This globe of the earth is perfectly round, and encompassed by the orbits of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, and by the constellations. It has no (material) supporter, but stands firmly in the expanse of heaven by its own inherent force,\" &c.\n\nThe 4th verse demonstrates the self-support of the earth:\u2014\n\n\"If the earth were supported by any material substance or living creature, then that would require a second supporter; and for that second, a third would be required. Here, we have the absurdity of an interminable series. If the last of the series be supposed to remain firm by its own inherent power, then why may not the same power be supposed to exist in the first\u2014that is, in the earth?\"\nIII.\u2014According to Hindu mythology, the earth is said to be motionless, and the day and night are caused by the sun moving round the earth; but *A'riya Siddh\u00e1ntam* says that the earth moves round on its axis, and that thereby the day and night are caused. This verse of *A'riya Siddh\u00e1ntam* is quoted by Professor Colebrook in his Essays, Vol. II., page 392.\n\nIV.\u2014The mythology states that the sun is nearer the earth than the moon; but the 2nd verse of the 3rd chapter of *Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani*, read before, says that the earth is encompassed by the orbits of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. By the order of the planets, as given here, it will be seen that the moon is nearer than the sun. The order is the very same as that given in the European science, except that the sun and the earth have been transposed.\n\nBesides, the 5th verse of the 10th chapter of the same work says that the distance of the moon from the earth is 51,566 y\u00f3janas, and that of the sun 689,377, shewing that the moon is much nearer to the earth than the sun.\n\nV.\u2014The diameter of the moon\u2019s disc is said in the 1st verse of the 4th chapter of *S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam* to be 480 y\u00f3janas or 2,400 miles, whereas according to European science it is 2,162 miles, shewing only a slight difference.\n\nVI.\u2014The common idea of the people and the poetical expression in almost all the Tamil epic poems are that the clouds go to the sea, drink its water, and then pour the rain on the earth. But a verse in *R\u00e1ku Vamsam* says: \u201cThe sun evaporates the waters and moisture of the earth, and then gives it back\u201d\u2014i.e., it rains.\n\nEuropean science is the same.\n\nVII.\u2014According to the European science, a year is caused by the earth revolving once round the sun in 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 48 seconds; and according to the Hindu science,\nit is caused by the sun going once through the twelve (12) signs of the zodiac in 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 29 seconds. Whatever may be the difference in the theory, the result is almost alike in determining the length of a year, the difference being only about 24 minutes.\n\nVIII.\u2014The 2nd verse of the 4th chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani says: \"The atmosphere extends to the height of 12 y\u00f3janas from the earth; within this limit are the clouds, lightning, &c.\" Twelve y\u00f3janas are equal to 60 miles.\n\nEuropean science also says that the atmosphere surrounds the earth to the height of 50 or 60 miles.\n\nIX.\u2014The cause of the motion of the planets is explained in the first five verses of the 2nd chapter of S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam.\n\n(Verse 1.) \"Forms of time, of invisible shape, stationed in the zodiac (bhagana), called the conjunction (sighr\u00f3chcha), apsis (mand\u00f3chcha), and node (p\u00e1ta), are causes of the motion of the planets.\"\n\n(2.) \"The planets, attached to these beings by cords of air, are drawn away by them with the right and left hand, forward or backward according to nearness, toward their own place.\"\n\n(3.) \"A wind, moreover, called prav\u00e1ha impels them towards their own apices (uchcha); being drawn away forward and backward, they proceed by a varying motion.\"\n\n(4.) \"The so-called apex (uchcha), when in the half orbit in front of the planet, draws the planet forward; in like manner, when in the half orbit behind the planet, it draws it backward.\"\n\n(5.) \"When the planets drawn away by their apices (uchcha) move forward in their orbits, the amount of the motion so caused is called their excess (dhana); when they move backward, it is called their deficiency (r\u012bna.)\"\n\nThere is some sort of agreement between European and Hindu sciences in this intricate and abstruse part of astronomy. European science says that the planets take their circular\norbits from the combined effect of their centrifugal and centripetal forces.\n\nIn the verses referred to just now the following description is given:\u2014\"The so-called apex, when in the half orbit in front of the planet, draws the planet forward; in like manner, when in the half orbit behind the planet it draws it backward. Being drawn away, forward and backward, they proceed by a varying motion.\"\n\nThe accelerated motion and retarded motion are conveyed by the terms \"sighr\u00f3chcham\" and \"mand\u00f3chcham,\" which mean respectively \"swiftness\" and \"slowness.\"\n\nThus, it will be seen that the European and Hindu sciences, although the expressions are different, agree as to the causes of the motion of planets in circular or oval orbits.\n\nX.\u2014Though the motions of planets and the figure of their orbits had been determined by Copernicus and other astronomers, yet the cause, or power, which carries them in their orbits, was unknown at that time. The discovery of this cause was made by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nThe principle on which the planetary revolution is founded is gravitation. The laws of gravitation were known to the Hindus long before Sir Isaac Newton's time. Thus, the 6th, 7th, and 9th verses of the 3rd chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani state:\n\n(6th.) \"The property of attraction is inherent in the earth. By this property the earth attracts any unsupported heavy thing towards it. The thing appears falling, but it is in a state of being drawn to the earth. The ethereal expanse being equally outspread all around, where can the earth fall?\"\n\n(7th.) \"Observing the revolution of the constellations, the Buddhas thought that the earth had no support; and as no heavy body is seen stationary in the air, they asserted that the earth goes eternally downwards in space.\"\n\n(9th.) \"Observing, as you do, O Buddha, that every heavy\nbody projected into the air comes back again to, and overtakes, the earth, how can you idly maintain that the earth is falling down in space? If true, the earth being the heavier body, would perpetually gain on the higher projectile, and never be overtaken.\"\n\nB\u00e1skara-\u00e1s\u00e1riy\u00e1r, the author of this work, was born in the year 1036 of S\u00e1liv\u00e1hana era, and composed it in the year 1072, corresponding with the year 1150 of the Christian era, or about 500 years before Sir Isaac Newton made the discovery of gravitation.\n\nXI.\u2014Now, lastly, about the Solar and Lunar Eclipses. The doctrine is the same in the European and Hindu sciences, though in Hindu mythology it is said that two serpents, called R\u00e1ku and K\u00e9tu, are hiding the sun and moon, and are causing the eclipses.\n\nOf all the phenomena of the heavens, it is the eclipses of the sun and moon that attract the attention of man more than any other. In early ages of antiquity eclipses were regarded as alarming prognostications of public calamities and tokens of divine displeasure.\n\nIn Mexico, during the times of eclipses, the natives fast and afflict themselves, thinking that the great spirit is in deep sufferance.\n\nSome of the Indian tribes of North America imagine that the moon has been wounded in a war.\n\nThe prevailing notion among the Hindus, which they derived from the mythological legends of poetry, is that certain serpents swallow the sun and moon, sometimes partially, and sometimes entirely. But the true Hindu science accounts for the eclipses just in the same way as European science does.\n\nS\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam, 4th chapter, 9th verse :\u2014\"The moon is the eclipser of the sun, coming to stand underneath it like a cloud; the moon moving eastward enters the earth's shadow, and the latter (i.e., the shadow) becomes its eclipser.\"\nThis doctrine is in perfect accordance with the European.\n\nIt has been shewn that in many respects there is a perfect accordance between the Hindu and European astronomy. There are discrepancies in the theory and principles as regards some points, as inculcated in the Hindu science, but in almost all cases the result of the calculations as regards the several phenomena is the same as that of European astronomy, such as the lunar and solar eclipses, the position of planets, the retrogradation in planetary motions, &c.\n\nIt is not known what instruments were used by the ancient Hindus, but it is an undoubted fact that they had the use of some sort of instruments, without which it would not be possible to make the several calculations.\n\nThe 11th chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani speaks of the use of certain instruments, such as armillary sphere, nodi valaya, yashi, chanka, gha\u1e6di, circle, semi-circle, quadrant, swayam v\u00e1ha yantra, syphon, &c.\n\nTo once more quote Mr. Hoisington:\n\n\"The Egyptians, Chaldeans, Indians, and Chinese early possessed many astronomical facts, many observations of important phenomena, and many rules and methods of astronomical calculations; and it has been supposed that they had the ruins of a great system of astronomical science, which in the earliest ages of the world had been carried to a great degree of perfection, and that while the principles and explanations of the phenomena were lost, and isolated, unconnected facts, rules of calculation, and phenomena themselves remained.\"\nSCULPTURES AT HORANA.\n\nBy James G. Smither, F.R.I.B.A.\n\n(Read April 7th, 1881.)\n\nHaving recently had occasion to visit Horana, a place distant about twelve miles inland from P\u00e1nadur\u00e9, I took the opportunity of inspecting some sculptured stones, which, with a few mouldings and some other fragments of an ancient building, lie half concealed by high grass and weeds behind the Government rest-house. There is nothing remarkable about the mouldings, but the sculptures are, I think, of sufficient interest to warrant my forwarding to the Society the following short description of them.\n\nThe sculptured stones form the vertical face of the stylobate or raised platform, on which, doubtless, formerly stood a structure, of which all vestiges have entirely disappeared.\n\nThe platform (only 35 feet square) was originally about three feet high above the paved open court round about it, and was approached by a single flight of steps at the end towards the east. The court or enclosure measures 58 feet from north to south, and 56 feet from east to west. It was surrounded by a stone wall, now broken down, and was entered at the east end opposite the above mentioned flight of steps leading up to the platform. The wall of the stylobate consisted of a moulded base, a sculptured die 14 inches high, and a moulded cornice, the latter nowhere now in position. Most of the stones forming the die have been removed quite away from the spot, but the sculptures upon the few which remain differ entirely from any in the same position which have hitherto come under my notice, and are particularly interesting.\nThe subject represented is a procession, in honor probably, of some august personage who most likely figured in part of it.\n\nThe occasion must have been an important and joyous one, judging from the great length of the procession, (which, with figures under a foot high and closely following one another, must have extended more than 100 feet,) and the wild demonstrations of delight in which all who are taking part in it are indulging.\n\nUpon one stone, which measures 10 feet 6 inches in length, are nine male figures and two animals. This series commences with four dancing figures with musical instruments, followed by one who appears to be running in and out of the procession. Then comes a man leading a horse\u2014probably a led horse of the honored personage\u2014and holding an umbrella over the head of the animal; then a walking figure immediately followed by an elephant; and behind the elephant two men fencing with swords, each furnished with a shield.\n\nOn another stone measuring 4 feet 6 inches in length are five figures, all in the wildest dancing attitudes; one holds his left leg over his head with his right hand, and another flourishes a sword.\n\nOne stone, 3 feet 4 inches long, exhibits three dancing figures; and another, 3 feet long, two figures, one performing with a sword or stick which he holds with both hands.\n\nA stone measuring 6 feet 4 inches in length differs from those above described, and must, I think, have formed one of the angle stones of the course. At one end of the stone is a narrow panel, and near the other end a similar panel, each containing a seated lion, the interval between the panels being occupied by three running nondescript horned animals somewhat resembling goats. In the small space left at the extreme end of the stone beyond the small panel stands a man blowing a horn, with his face turned away from the panel and in the direction of the advancing procession, which doubtless commenced on the next stone. The\nthree horned animals occur again on another stone, and are most likely part of a similar composition to that above described.\n\nUnfortunately the whole of the sculptures are so much weather-worn and defaced, that it is very difficult to make out what some of them are intended to represent, and the details of dress, musical instruments, &c., are scarcely distinguishable. The absence of the stones which would complete the subject is much to be deplored, as well as the lamentable condition of those which remain; but the latter, even in their present state, are of so much interest, that they should certainly be preserved if possible, and the best means of doing so is to deposit them in the Colombo Museum.\n\nThe ruins at Horana have evidently been used as a quarry for some time past, and I observed that a fine carved stone doorway and other ornamental stones, which must have formed part of some ancient structure, (probably that under notice,) have been built into the walls of a Buddhist Temple, a most unsightly edifice, which has been very recently erected within 50 yards of the ruins.\nGOLD.\n\nBy Alex. C. Dixon, B. Sc. (Honors), London.\n\n(Read April 7th, 1881.)\n\nThe Island of Ceylon is referred to by Ptolemy as containing gold, and Solinus, a noted historian, makes mention of it in his works, A.D. 238. The early inhabitants of Ceylon were not ignorant of its presence. It is referred to in the Mah\u00e1wanso, while during the founding of the Ruwanv\u00e9li D\u00e1goba at Anur\u00e1dhapura there was a sudden appearance of sprouts of gold above and below the ground, and of silver in the vicinity of Adam's Peak.\n\nIt is also referred to in the Sinhalese works entitled Ka\u1e0dayimpot, as being found in several localities; and the names of many places either have reference to its occurrence or to their glistening appearance resembling gold, such as Ruwanvella, Ramboda (formerly Rangbodx).\n\nThe Sinhalese name for gold is ran; for gold ore the term amuran, signifying not ripe or unextracted gold; while ratran refers to melted gold.\n\nIn 1854 it was found in the Maha-oya and at Nuwara Eliya, and still later again at Nuwara Eliya.\n\nThere is a great similarity between the hill regions of Ceylon and the South-East Wynaad district at the North-West base of the Neilgherries, which has recently become so prominent on account of its auriferous reefs. As to the probable age of these districts we are uncertain, but there can be no doubt that the two regions are contemporaneous, consisting of granitoid schists or gneissoid rocks, that they are highly metamorphosed, and that quartz reefs form a conspicuous feature.\n\nThe reefs are often white, occasionally somewhat brecciated, and not unfrequently bound together by h\u00e6matite or limonite.\nAlthough the strike of the rock is peculiar in the Neilgherries E.N.E., yet the auriferous reefs run N.N.W., corresponding with the gneiss a little further to the North. The general run of the rocks here is N. to N.W.\n\nAs on the Wynnaad, we have an absence of intrusive rock\u2014no dykes, porphyritic masses, or basalts. It has been observed that the auriferous belts are richest where micaceous and chloritic rocks occur. Strange to say, in the cuttings of the railway into our hill district, and the various cuttings on the public roads, no prominent reefs have been crossed. Probably one or more may be met with on the extension of the railway from N\u00e1walapitiya to N\u00e1nu-oya. In several parts the country is traversed by large persistent reefs of quartz, with numerous narrow seams and veins diverging from them and often traceable into decomposed lithomargic earth. Some good examples of these are to be found in the Balangoda, Pussellawa, Ramboda, and Dolosb\u00e1g\u00e9 districts.\n\nThe character of the vegetation in prospecting for gold is of great assistance in Australia, where each formation is characterized by distinct forms of vegetation, but in Ceylon we have no guidance, as the mountainous zone is but one formation.\n\nGold occurs in three chief forms:\n\n1.\u2014As scattered grains or nuggets in alluvial deposits, having been set free by natural causes from its matrix.\n\n2.\u2014In grains and leaves in numerous veins, chiefly quartz, still in the matrix, but not with other metals. This is called free gold.\n\n3.\u2014Associated (but not chemically combined) with numerous other metallic compounds, such as arsenides, sulphides, &c., generally classed under the term pyrites, found in veins of quartz and other rock.\n\nIn the first form, I have met with it in the alluvium of the D\u00e9duru-oya beyond Kurun\u00e9gala. The particles were exceedingly small, and other metallic matters were not uncommon.\nThis must have come from some quartz reefs further up in the hills. Its occurrence in this river is referred to in the Kadayim-pota.\n\nA second instance of its occurrence in this form was in the Galle District, where a small nugget was taken from the alluvium accumulated in one of the ravines; it weighed over 6 grains, and was associated with fragments of gems, such as sapphire, garnet, chrysoberyl, tourmaline, zircon, as well as of sulphides of some rare metals. This deposit was due to disintegration from the matrix in which they occurred originally. I followed up the ravine to its head with the expectation of finding a quartz reef from which the gold must have been dislodged, and found two small reefs crossing it. I took specimens from these and found traces of gold, but not in sufficient quantity to warrant its being worked. I have had further specimens from this reef of a much better character.\n\nIn the second form it occurs in the Rambo\u1e0da district, Central Province, where several remarkable reefs strike across the valleys. In one of my tours I gathered numerous specimens of quartz of various hues, chloritic and micaceous rocks. On breaking them up and examining, I found in the quartz traces of gold, a specimen of which is on the table. I am unable to give the precise locality.\n\nIn the third form it occurs in the pyrites of the gem-pits in the Ratnapura\u2013Rakw\u0101na districts, but only in very small quantity.\n\nFrom the little I have seen, it is my opinion that considerable quantities will yet be brought to light.\n\n---\n\nSpecimens exhibited.\n\n1.

He enquired of the prime minister what the lizard meant. The minister replied that the lizard wished to pay obeisance to his majesty. The king, pleased, caused a bit of gold to be tied to its neck. A few days afterwards, the king passing through the same gateway saw the lizard seated as before, but it took no notice of the king. The king again enquired of the minister why the lizard did not salute him as before. The minister replied that the lizard thought that he was now on a par with the king, as he himself wore a gold ornament, and that he was not therefore bound to pay homage.\n223.

I set myself to work at once in trying to improve the system. By the courtesy of Mr. Ferguson, the senior Editor of the \"Ceylon Observer,\" I was enabled to secure works on practical bee-keeping, and by carefully reading these I endeavoured to improve the primitive means adopted by the native apiarists, but without success. My thanks are also due to E. T. Sharpe, Esq., and R. Morris, Esq., who encouraged me much in the pursuit of my experiments by getting out for me English bee-hives and apparatus for working them.\n\nThere are four species of honey-bees in Ceylon:\n\n1. \u2014 Mi\u2014: Apis Indica;\n2. \u2014 Danduwel\u2014: Apis Florea;\n3. \u2014 Bambar\u00e1\u2014: Apis Dorsata; and\n4. \u2014 Kana Veyiy\u00e1\u2014: Trigonae.\n\nThe Mi Mess\u00e1 (Apis Indica) is the common honey-bee of Ceylon, and the only species kept by natives. I have had a few colonies of these from the very beginning, and in the way of improvement I have transferred them to pots of quite a different shape from the ordinary narrow-mouthed pitchers used by natives, which required the destruction of the pot to get at the honey, thereby causing considerable destruction to bee-life. The pots I substituted are in two sections: the first section or entrance narrow-mouthed and oblong, which fits\ninto the second, which is flat and deep. When the first section, or mouth-piece with an opening of about 10 in. across, is taken up, the honey-combs are easily removed without any injury to the combs or to the bees, leaving the brood combs intact within it. Directly the honey-combs are removed the mouth-piece is again replaced, tied fast, and placed in its proper position, when all the bees return to it and begin to work as if they were never disturbed. At this critical stage, however, they are fed for a few days with jaggery and water, which is made into a thin light syrup, and placed close to the mouth of the pot in a flat vessel. In this manner I have always had a supply of honey for house use, and occasionally to spare for my friends. With regard to the English bee-hives, I have made little or no progress with them. The bees take to them easily, but it is an effort to keep them in long, as they shew a disposition to get out. By continual feeding they may be regularly established in them, and when once established they keep on and build their combs and fill the stock hive; but I have never been successful in inducing them to take to supers, which may be attributed to my want of ingenuity and experience to adapt the frames to their mode of comb-building, or to the bees preferring pots, which are I believe cooler than the boxes.\n\nThe bees are easily moved about in combs in frame boxes, and hence it is my impression that they can be by competent persons easily reared according to the European system, and with profit and advantage.\n\nThe native system of bee-keeping is very simple indeed. They invariably sweeten the pot intended to be used as a hive by fumigating it with resin, and place it in a cool elevated position, smearing the mouth of the pot with a little honey during the swarming season. The wild bees take to them without the least trouble and begin building their combs, and filling them. When the proper season comes round they break the pots, blow into them to drive the bees aside, and abstract\nall the honey as well as the brood combs; the former they retain, and the latter are thrown away, a great waste of material and reckless destruction of bee-life. When the next swarming season comes round, which is between March and April, a fresh pot is fumigated with resin, is placed in the same position for the next supply of honey, which is obtained in July or August. The largest supply the natives so obtain is about three or four bottles of liquid honey. With regard to the wild bees they always build in the crevices and hollows of rocks and trees, and, if not removed by bee-hunters in proper season, they themselves consume the produce of their labour, and abandon the empty combs and betake themselves to the woods; and it is firmly believed by the natives, that when the swarming season comes round they return to their old haunts and set to work again.\n\n2nd.\u2014Danduwel (Apis Florea) is an unprofitable bee, producing very little honey. It attaches its solitary semi-circular combs 9 in. by 5 in. to the branch of a tree. Its honey is esteemed by the natives as being cool and nice, but this species is not at all adapted for rearing purposes, as its produce is very scanty.\n\n3rd.\u2014Bambar\u00e1 (Apis Dorsata) is a large bee prettily marked with yellow and black, and makes a large quantity of honey varying from two to three gallons. It constructs its hive, a large thick comb about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. in a peculiar shape, attaching it to the branches of very lofty forest trees, or securing it to the ledges of high rocks with its two ends fastened up, and having a narrow opening in the middle. It is with great difficulty got at by bee-hunters, and only by those used to such kind of work.\n\nAt the proper season three or four experienced men start on the expedition armed with knives and ropes and a quantity of straw and other materials (for smoking and burning the bees). Having reached the woods where the bees are located the hunters commence operations on a calm day. First they smoke\nout the bees by a heavy fire of straw, when the bees fly high in\nthe air in a straight line; meanwhile one of the hunters cuts\nthe hive, and lowers it down by means of a rope attached to a\nbasket, and hastens down in time to avoid being stung; his\ncompanions, who preceded him, throw the hive into the fire\ndirectly it comes down, in order to burn all the straggling bees\nin the comb, and remove away the hive at once, for the Bambara,\nwhen provoked are very persistent in stinging, and the poison\nis as virulent as that of a wasp. People are known to have\nbeen stung to death by swarms of these. This is not to be\nwondered at, considering that they go to work without any\nprotection to their naked bodies. It is believed\u2014and my ex-\nperience corroborates the belief\u2014that they do not rebuild their\nhives in the same place unless a portion of the comb is left\nbehind with the queen bee uninjured. The honey of this bee is\nvery rich in flavour and highly esteemed, and is considered an\nuncommon luxury among the natives. It is not however so thick\nas the common bee honey. I have never heard of any attempts\nbeing made by natives to domesticate them like the common\nhoney bee of Ceylon; and it is my impression that any amount\nof exertion to domesticate them will prove fruitless. One of the\npeculiar characteristics of this species is that, unlike the common\nbees, they go about gathering materials for the construction of\ntheir hives only during the evening twilight, and myriads of\nthem are seen at that hour in the Mora, Kon, and other flowering\nforest trees during the season.\n\n4th.\u2014Kana Veyiy\u00e1 (a tiny bee belonging to the Trigon\u00e6),\nproduces a small quantity of honey which it makes in the\nhollows of rotten trees and crevices of rocks and dilapidated\nbuildings. I have seen and examined a great many of these\ncombs, which are irregular in shape; they never yield more than\na tea-cupful of honey, which has a rather acid taste, and is only\nused for medicinal purposes. Their combs are generally about\nfour or five inches in circumference, and the cells partially filled\nwith honey and the rest with their brood, like other honey bees, and kept separate. When interfered with or disturbed, they would buzz about one's ears and nostrils, but in other respects they are perfectly harmless and may be easily handled.\n\nSince writing the above I have been taken by surprise by Mr. Benton, a good authority on Bee Culture. His visit to Kurun\u00e9gala is for the purpose of hunting up the Bambar\u00e1 (Apis Dorsata). A narration of his valuable experience has afforded me much information, and I indulge in the hope that this will enable me to compete with my difficulties more successfully in the future.\n\nA person of Mr. Benton's acknowledged ability and experience would do much for Ceylon in opening up a branch of industry so easily conducted and yielding so large a return, but of which the natives are so lamentably ignorant.\nA SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPAL RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES OBSERVED BY THE KANDYANS OF CEYLON.\n\nBy C. J. R. LeMesurier, C.C.S.\n\n(Read May 7th, 1881.)\n\n1.\u2014The religious ceremonies of the Kandyans begin with that of New Year\u2014the Avurudu Mangaliya. This commences at a lucky hour, fixed by the astrologers, on the 11th of April. During the short interval that precedes it, while the old year is passing away, no food is eaten save that which has been prepared before that interval; and the people do not wash, work, spend money, or give alms. At the lucky hour (the Nekata) a gun is fired from a parapet on the walls of the temple containing the Sacred Tooth at Kandy, and the New Year begins. The customary daily ceremonies are then observed, but with more show than usual. The tom-toms are more vigorously beaten, the tenants of the temple and the priests put on their best clothes; and the services are more sumptuously performed. Milk is boiled in the main entrance to the temple, and is afterwards sprinkled over the floors. During the days of the kingdom, the king himself used to attend the opening services; but now the Diyawadana Nilame and other influential Buddhists take his place.\n\nThe offerings are much better than usual, and more neatly and extravagantly prepared. If the lucky hour is in the morning, rice and curry and sweetmeats are offered; the curry being of thirty, and the sweetmeats of thirty-two kinds. If the lucky hour falls in the evening, drinkables are presented. Besides these, it is usual for the wealthy to offer robes, fans, cloths, and other articles of value to the priesthood. At the beginning of the\nyear all Buddhists wash, and confine themselves to certain victuals prescribed by the astrologers. All work is abandoned for a certain specified time; and after the usual religious rites have been performed, the people engage in games of various descriptions. These they break off and resume at stated periods. During the intervals they pray, or have the scriptures read to them by their priests, or visit their friends, according as their fancies or opportunities dictate. The priests confine themselves for the most part to their religious duties: or they keep away from the busy world and meditate; it being considered that the New Year is a peculiarly fitting time for the exercise of this duty.\n\n2.\u2014The next in importance is the Perahera Mangalyaya, the great processional festival of the Kandyans. This festival is begun at Alutnuwara in the Badulla district on the first day after the full moon in May; and is repeated at different times in different parts of the Kandyan province. The forms in all cases are the same, though of course the magnificence of the ritual varies with the place and the means of those who engage in it. The most magnificent and complete is that at Kandy, which begins at a lucky hour on the first day after the new moon in the month of Esala (July-August). A jack tree, the stem of which is three spans in circumference, is selected beforehand for each of the four d\u00e9w\u00e1la\u2014the Kataragama, N\u00e1ta, Saman, and Pattini; and the spot where it stands is decorated and perfumed with sandal-wood, frankincense, and burnt raisins, and a lighted lamp with nine wicks is placed at the foot of the tree. At the lucky hour a procession of elephants, tom-tom beaters, and dancers proceeds to the spot; the tree is cut down by one of the tenants (the wat\u1e6d\u00f3rur\u00e1la) with an axe, and it is trimmed, and its end is pointed by another with an adze. It is then carried away in procession, and placed in a small hole in a square of slab rock, buried in the ground or raised on a platform in the small room at the back of the d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9. It is then\ncovered with a white cloth. During the five following days the procession is augmented by as many elephants, attendants, dancers, tom-tom beaters and flags as possible; and it makes the circuit of the temple at stated periods. The processions of the several temples are then joined by one from the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa (the temple of the Sacred Tooth), and together they march round the main streets of Kandy at fixed hours during the five days next ensuing. On the sixth day, and for five days more, four palanquins\u2014one for each d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9\u2014are added to the procession, containing the arms and dresses of the gods; and on the last day the bowl of water (presently to be explained) of the previous year, and the poles cut down on the first day of the ceremony. On the night of the fifteenth and last day, the Perah\u00e9ra is enlarged to the fullest limits which the means of the several temples will permit, and at a fixed hour, after its usual round, it starts for a ford in the river near Kandy, about three miles distant from the temple of the Sacred Tooth. The procession from the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, however, stops at a place called the \u00c1d\u00e1hana Maluwa in Trincomalee-street, and there awaits the return of the others. The ford is reached towards dawn, and here the procession waits until the lucky hour (generally about 5 A.M.) approaches. A few minutes before its arrival the chiefs of the four temples, accompanied by a band of attendants, walk down in Indian file under a canopy of linen and over cloths spread on the ground to the waterside. They enter a boat and are punted up the river close to the bank for some thirty yards. Then at a given signal (i.e., at the advent of the lucky hour) the four jack poles are thrown into the river by the men on shore, while each of the four chiefs, with an ornamental silver sword, cuts a circle in the water; at the same time one attendant takes up a bowl of water from the circle, and another throws away last year's supply. The boat then returns to the shore, the procession goes back to Kandy, the bowls of water are placed reverently in the several d\u00e9w\u00e1la, to remain there\nuntil the following year; and the Perahera is at an end. The next day, however, there is a grand winding up procession in the afternoon, after which the chiefs all pay their respects to the Government Agent of Kandy as the representative of the Queen.\n\n3.\u2014The Was Mangalyaya. On the day after the full moon in July, the elders of the village visit their village priest, or any other priest they may have selected, and ask him to stay with, and minister to, them for three months. They promise to give him a place of residence, to feed him and render him any service he may require during that period. The request is complied with, and a procession is organized to conduct him to the place prepared. Here he remains for the stated period. He cannot leave except under certain ceremonies; and at no time can he be absent for more than seven days. On a fixed day in October, determined on beforehand by the elders of the village and communicated to the priest, he is requested to invite a certain number of his brotherhood to the last ceremony. The number varies according to the means and generosity of the villagers. On the day named, these priests assemble and are sumptuously fed in the morning by the villagers. After the meal is over a sheet of white cloth, twenty cubits in length, is presented to the priests, who thereupon divide it into fifteen rectangular pieces, and these they join together again into the shape of a priest\u2019s robe\u2014a large rectangle, five cubits long, and four and a-half cubits broad. The object of this division and re-joining being to destroy the value of the cloth, and to carry out the rule that no priest may wear a robe of one piece. It is then taken by the dhoby of the village under a canopy to a neighbouring stream, and publicly washed; tom-toms and trumpets being sounded in the meanwhile. When washed, it is brought back to the hall where the priests are assembled, and placed in a small vessel containing the proper yellow dye. After it has remained in this a sufficient time, it\nis taken out and presented by the chief elder of the village as a common offering to the priesthood. The chief of the assembled priests thereupon puts the question, \"Who here requires a robe?\" to which all but the Was priest reply, \"We have robes already.\" Then another priest says: \"They have kept the Was priest so long here; let us give it to him.\" This is agreed to, and two other priests at once rise and chant the refrain:\u2014\n\n\"A robe has been presented to the priesthood, and we have agreed to present it to [naming the Was priest].\" One of them accordingly takes the robe, hands it round to each priest in turn, so that all may touch it, and then gives it to the Was priest. He puts it on, wet as it is, over his shoulder, makes a mark in a corner, repeats a stanza of Bana (the sacred scriptures), presses it over his other robes, and then hangs it up to dry in view of all. He is obliged to carry this robe, either on his body or in a bundle, for three months before it can be washed; and he always looks upon it with a certain degree of pride. A second robe is, however, usually presented afterwards to him; the first being considered as an offering to the priesthood in general, the second as a present to the individual priest.\n\n4.\u2014Next in order is the Keti Mangalyaya: so called because on this day the full moon and the Keti Nekata (the lucky hour) come together. It takes place on the full-moon day immediately after the termination of the previous\u2014i.e., the Was festival. On this day all the temples are brilliantly illuminated. This is done by means of small oil lamps, placed close together all round the buildings. During the night a procession of elephants, flags, tom-toms, etc., and a large number of torches, is kept up for many hours; the effect in Kandy, in conjunction with the illuminated temples, being very striking. It is customary also at this festival to make offerings of fans, robes, begging bowls, cloths, etc., to the recent Was priests.\n5.\u2014The *Aluts\u00e1l Mangalyaya*, or festival of the new rice. This festival takes place on the full-moon day in January. At the appointed hour, a large procession consisting of certain officers and the representatives of certain temples, with their attendants, elephants, etc., proceeds to the village of Gurudeniya in Lower H\u00e9w\u00e1h\u00ebta, and there receives a fixed share of the new rice and of the rice of the previous year; the villagers of Gurudeniya having originally obtained their lands from the king of Kandy on condition of devoting a certain portion of their harvests to this purpose. A fixed quantity is given to each; but as this in many cases is very small, it is seldom that all the temples and officers are represented. I however annex an interesting list (*vide* Appendix) shewing how the rice should be distributed, and during the time of the kings all the persons to whom rice was due were compelled to be present. The distribution takes place at the d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 at Gurudeniya; and in the case of temples the rice is taken home in procession and cooked on the following morning. It is then offered at the shrine, and afterwards distributed to the different priests and officers.\n\n6.\u2014*N\u00e1numura Mangalyaya*: the ceremony of purification. This is performed every Wednesday morning in every temple erected by the Kandyan kings, as follows. Some lime juice is made before the daily rice is offered, and is mixed with cuscus, sandal, and other fragrant herbs and bark. The officiating priest takes a looking-glass, and, holding it in front of the shrine, anoints the reflected image with the preparation. A vessel is held under to catch the liquor as it drops, to prevent it from falling to the ground. The liquor is then thrown away and the daily offerings are made.\n\n7.\u2014The reading of *Bana*, or the sacred scriptures. This is done for the most part on the \u201cp\u00f3ya\u201d days of the month\u2014*i.e.*, the four phases of the moon. The officiating priest, being seated on an elevated seat made for the purpose, recites passages from the Buddhist scriptures, generally from some portion of a\nPitaka* and then explains the meaning to his audience. For this service he is lodged and fed during the time of his ministry and is afterwards presented with robes, white cloths, handkerchiefs, etc., and sometimes money.\n\n8.\u2014Pirit, a ceremony to ward off evil. This is generally performed on the occasion of some epidemic, or in the case of serious illness. A large hall, called a Bana Ma\u1e0duwa, is prepared and decorated, and as many priests as possible are invited to take part in it, the number never being less than thirty. The floor of the hall is covered with mats, over which white cloths are spread. Cushions are placed all round for the priests, two for each, one to sit upon and the other to lean against. A low platform is erected in the middle, on which a table is placed, with two chairs on one side. This table is covered with a cloth, and the Pirit book is put upon it. A relic in the usual bell-shaped casket, called a karanduwa, is placed on a second table close by, and a bowl of water, taken from a newly-dug well in the vicinity, is put on a bench beside it. A piece of string is attached to the karanduwa and to the Pirit book, and is then carried up to a ring in the ceiling and thence down to the ground. It is of sufficient length to be held by all the priests when they are assembled, and sitting round the room; and during the ceremony they all hold it. On the appointed day the priests are brought in procession to the hall; their feet are washed at the entrance, and they are escorted to their places along stretched-out cloths. The place is consecrated and the deity is invoked, while the hall is perfumed with incense and tom-toms are beaten. An elder of the village then steps forward, and requests the priests assembled to open the Pirit, and to continue it for seven days. The priests assent, and thereupon dedicate the hall to that purpose. They then\n\n---\n\n* The records of the teachings of Buddha are contained in the three Pitakas\u2014i.e., the S\u016btra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma Pitaka.\nreturn for the night to the place prepared for them. At day-break next morning they re-assemble, and begin the Pirit. This is done by two of their number seating themselves at the table, and reciting the opening service of the Pirit-book; the other priests in the meantime holding their fans in front of them, and the string above described over their knees. When the invocation and one S\u00fatra* have been read, the two seat themselves by the others, and all joining in chorus recite three particular S\u00fatras: the Ma\u1e45gala (of festivals), the Ratana (of the means of warding off disease), and the Karaniya-metta (of the methods whereby dangers may be avoided and prosperity obtained by gods and men). When these are ended two other priests come forward, seat themselves at the table, and go on with the next S\u00fatras, while the others all retire. Every two hours the readers are relieved; and three times a day all re-assemble, and repeat in chorus the three S\u00fatras before mentioned. There is no break in the continuity, as this would mar the whole effect; and the reading continues for seven days. On the sixth night the last seven S\u00fatras in the book are read over and over again, either by twos or fours; if the latter, two more chairs are brought in and placed at the table opposite the first two. On the morning of the seventh day after the early meal, one of the priests reads the vih\u0101ra Asne, the list of the names of the ancient temples in Ceylon and elsewhere; and then the assembled priests, with the exception of those who are reading the Pirit\u2014for the reading still goes on\u2014compose the D\u00e9w\u00e1la Patraya. This is a letter written on an ola, and addressed to the presiding deity of a neighbouring temple. It sets out the name of the d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9, and invokes the deity to attend the Pirit with the other gods. This is taken in procession to the temple\u2014or, if there is no d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 in the\n\n* The S\u00fatras are a collection of the counsels of Buddha and form a portion of the three Pi\u1e6dakas.\nneighbourhood, to a b\u00f3-tree, where a god is supposed to reside, and carried by a villager, dressed to represent an angel, in many-coloured cloths and a Kandyan hat. The priests, except those who are reading, accompany the procession if desired. A portion of the water from the bowl in the hall is taken too; and this is sprinkled over any sick persons that may be met with along the way. On arrival at the d\u00e9w\u00e1le, the letter is presented, and is hung upon the wall. The procession returns; and the \"angel\" reports at the door of the hall that he has presented the letter, and that the gods have come. One of the priests blesses the gods, and the Mangala S\u00fatra is read over once, after which the A't\u00e1n\u00e1tiya S\u00fatra is read over and over again by fours till dawn. The ceremony is then at an end; and the priests are conducted back to their residence.\n\n9.\u2014G\u00f3d\u00e1na Mangalyaya: the ceremony performed for the very aged, or those who are about to die. The relations of the dying man are assembled, and offerings of different kinds are collected. These consist sometimes of cattle, sometimes of furniture, such as the bed of the sick man, sometimes of his implements of agriculture or of his trade, but more often they are merely cloths, robes, fans, etc.\n\nThe priest of the neighbouring pansala (residence of the priesthood), and any others that may be selected, are summoned and entertained; and the offerings are made to them. They read a portion of the scriptures suitable to the occasion, and bless the sick man; after which, escorted by the assembled company, they depart with their presents.\n\n10.\u2014Mataka D\u00e1na: the ceremony of conferring merit on the dead.\n\nOn the seventh day after death the priest of the neighbouring pansala is invited back, and is entertained as before. Bana is read till midnight, when he retires. In the morning after the early meal a cloth is presented to him, and he is escorted by\nthe friends and relations of the deceased to a prepared spot near the house. Here the plate and cup that had been used by the dead man are deposited; and cake and rice are put into the plate, and water is poured into the cup. A light is set up by their side, and incense is burnt; while the priest invokes the deceased in the following words: \"Take this rice, water, cake, light and fragrance, and release thyself from the condition of an evil spirit.\" At the same time he takes the cup of water and pours it on the ground. The plate and cup are washed; and the priest carries them off to his residence. The object of the ceremony is to confer merit on the departed, in whatever condition he may have been re-born.\n\n10.\u2014Ava Mangalyaya. A day is fixed, a month, forty-five days, or three months after the G\u00f3d\u00e1na; of which due notice is given. A number of priests are invited, through the priest of the neighbouring Pansala, the number varying with the means of the family; and rice, cakes, fruit, etc., are collected. The priests are brought in procession to the house, where they read the scriptures for several hours. After this, robes, begging-bowls, cups, handkerchiefs, etc., are presented to them; and a common offering, consisting of a load of vegetables, cakes, an adze, a mamoty, an axe, an arecanut-cutter, a chunam-box, and (if the deceased was an old man), a betel-pounder, is placed before them. A cloth not less than 16 cubits in length, and held at one end by the relations of the deceased, is then tied to the load, a priest holding it meanwhile near the other end. Another priest takes his seat close by; and, holding his fan in front of him, recites the following words, the people repeating them after him:\u2014\"These offerings, which have been procured by just means by us and the dead man, we offer to you, the descendants of the great Buddha, in order that we may obtain merit in the name of the deceased.\" The cloth is then rolled up and placed on the offering, and the eldest priest intones the stanza: \"As the\nrain from the sky falls on hills and mountains, rolls down the valleys, and thence to the rivers, which carry the waters to the ocean; so may the merits of this great act descend on the dead man.\u201d Upon this the remainder chime in with the prayer: \u201cIf there be anything you wish to obtain by these offerings, may you be blest with it as with the full moon.\u201d Ba\u1e47a is then read for about an hour; and after it a priest closes the ceremony with the words:\u2014\u201cBy these virtuous acts may you all obtain prosperity here and in the next world, and attain Nirw\u0101\u1e47a at last.\u201d\n\nI was going to add a short account of the ordination and confession ceremonies of the priesthood; but my paper has run out to too great a length already. An exhaustive account of these will, however, be found in two papers contributed to the Royal Asiatic Society by Mr. J. F. Dickson in 1873 and 1875, and I need do no more here than merely refer to them.\n\nKandy, 2nd April, 1881.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nThe new rice (Aluts\u00e1l) is distributed as follows:\n\n| Location                                      | Half Measures |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| To the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, the temple of the Sacred Tooth | 10           |\n| Gangar\u00e1ma Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, a temple in Kandy            | 2            |\n| Kund\u00e1s\u00e1le Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, a few miles from Kandy in Lower Dumbara | 2            |\n| Degaldoruwa Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, do.                        | 2            |\n| N\u00e1ta D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9, in Kandy                          | 4            |\n| Maha D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 do.                                | 4            |\n| Pattini D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 do.                             | 4            |\n| Kataragam D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 do.                           | 3            |\n| Ganadewi K\u00f3wila, a Hindu temple near the Post Office, Kandy | 1            |\n| Diwa Nilam\u00e9, the lay officer in charge of the Tooth Temple | 30           |\nThe four Basn\u00e1yaka Nilames, the lay officers in charge of the N\u00e1ta, Maha, Pattini, and Kataragama D\u00e9w\u00e1la ... 32\n\nThe four Kapur\u00e1ll\u00e1, the lay officiating officers of the same ... 4\n\nThe Tamb\u00f3ruk\u00e1ray\u00e1, the officer who beats the drum (tamb\u00f3ruwa) on all P\u00f3ya days, on Wednesdays, and on the four festival days, (the Awurudu, Perah\u00e9ra, Katti, and Aluts\u00e1l) ... 1\n\nThe Gurudeniya Vid\u00e1n\u00e9, the officer who supervises the cultivation of the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa mutte\u1e6d\u1e6du fields (i.e., the fields that are cultivated for the benefit of the temple only), the gathering of the crop and the storing in the granary (\u0101tuwa) ... 6\n\nThe Gurudeniya L\u00e9kama, the officer who keeps the account of the annual yield of the temple fields and of the new rice distributed ... 6\n\nThe Gurudeniya Gammah\u00e9, an assistant to the Vid\u00e1n\u00e9 ... 5\n\nThe Gurudeniya Man\u00e1r\u00e1la, the officer who measures the crop of every temple field when it is gathered, and the receipts and issues of the granary.

Spence Moss, P.W.D.\n\n(Read 7th May, 1881.)\n\nAfter treating at some length the history of the Island, he proceeds to give a sort of review of the mode of Government under \"Vimala Dharma S\u00fariya Ada\" (whom he calls Don Juan) and a description of the Court, from which I extract as follows:\n\nThis Emperor, from fear of his own subjects, confines himself now (1604) to the mountain city of Diyatilaka, where he is surrounded by a large force of soldiers under the nobles, and by his higher officers of state; but he relies chiefly for his personal safety upon a special body guard of Moors, who keep watch continually at his chamber-door. Besides these he has many other guards, whom he selects from the best families, and who are the bravest and smartest young fellows in the country. They have long straight hair, go always bareheaded, and are generally about him wherever he goes.\n\nHis revenues are very great. Thrice a year must his subjects pay him tribute. The first he draws in March, at the time of their New Year; the second is taken from the first-fruits; and the third from a sort of offering which they make in November to the honour of their god.\n\nIn addition to these taxes every one is bound to provide for the Emperor whatever he may further require for use in his palace; and the nobles take advantage of this prerogative to practise extortion in his name wherever they think it is worth while.\n\nAll tribute and presents are covered with white cloth as a mark of respect, and are brought first to the Emperor after he has washed his\n\n* Valentyn (F.) Ond en Nieuw Oost Indien, 1724-26.\nhead and bathed at the New Year; when he shews himself publicly to the whole army assembled together for this purpose, and to the nobles also, under a salute from the whole of his artillery. After this the nobles and people come, in order, and offer him their presents of gold, silver, precious stones, arms, silk, stuffs, and cloth, besides the tribute proper, of which they then have to pay the first instalment in gold, palm wine (? arrack), oil, rice, honey, wax, iron, elephants' teeth, tobacco, or in other kind; and they then have often to remain a very long time about the Court before their gifts are accepted by the Emperor or his servants, in consequence of which great crowds are collected and commotions arise.\n\nBesides these revenues, which are fixed, he has many others which are uncertain or adventitious; as when, for instance, a man dies leaving cattle behind him, he (the Emperor) takes therefrom according to the law of the land and his own prerogative, one ox, one cow, and a pair of buffaloes, which are punctually claimed by certain officers appointed for the purpose.\n\nAt the time of the harvest in each year every one must pay to the Emperor a certain measure of corn, or rice, according to the extent of his land, which is sometimes commuted for all time by payment of a sum of money, though this latter custom is now no longer followed.\n\nThe estates of soldiers however who die in battle are free from this tax, but not otherwise.\n\nAll farmers also of the land, in addition to the prescribed grain tythe, must pay a certain sum of money; but, on the other hand, those lands are not liable which have been given to a priest or to a charity.\n\nIn olden times he had also the tolls at Kottiyar or Trincomalee, Port des Galles, and Portaloon, &c., &c., &c.\n\nAfter describing the religion of the Sinhalese he alludes to\u2014\n\nTrincomalee, which means either the hill of the three Pagodas, or of the world-famed Pagoda called the Pagoda of \"three stories.\" . . . One of these (three temples) was appropriated to the use of the pilgrims who came thither by thousands to practise their idolatry, and of whom some in the fervour of devotion precipitated themselves\nfrom the rock into the sea and were drowned, firmly believing that this was the straightest and shortest way to come at heaven, and that the waters wherein they found their end had little less sanctity than those of the Ganges.\n\nThere is a tradition, which the writer will endeavour to obtain in its correct form, still extant in Trincomalee, that an European soldier entered and defiled by his presence the old temple on the rock, and that this soldier may now be seen by the faithful, down under the sea in the ruins of the old temple, when the priest after sacrificing holds his torch over the edge of the precipice when it is dusk or nearly dark.\n\nOf Adam's Peak, Valentyn goes on to give the following remarkable description, figuring Arangala or N\u00e1landa Peak by way of illustration. From enquiries of the old priest at Aluwih\u00e1re, the writer has not been able to find any tradition of sanctity attaching to Arangala, so that Valentyn's mistake is the more remarkable:\n\nThis mountain was esteemed most sacred not only by the Sinhalese, but also by all the Gentiles and heathen of India, and even by many Mahometans as their chief sanctuary. On the top of this mountain stands a beautiful Pagoda, concerning which the Sinhalese have many traditions, and where they say Buddha [whom he calls throughout \"Budhum\"], a disciple of the Apostle Thomas, dwelt. They say that he stood with one foot on this, and the other foot on a mountain near Tuticorin, and that he made so much water that thereby the Island of Ceylon was divided from the coast.\n\nFrom the same tradition they proceed to say of him that he was 26 cubits in stature.\n\nOf the same kind and size footprints of Buddha are found here and there upon the rocks in Ceylon, and also whole figures hewn out, from which many of them hold that Adam lived there; but most of them hold firmly to this, that Buddha went up to heaven from this hill (Adam's Peak), taking this account from the ascension of Christ, whereof they have obtained the tradition either through the St. Thomas' Christians or through the Portuguese.\nUp the Peak or Mount of Adam one has to climb by an iron chain, serving for the pilgrims and travellers who wish to make the ascent. This chain is made with shackles, by the help of which one can climb as if by the rungs of a ladder.\n\nOn the top of the mountain is a plain, 150 paces long and 110 broad, in the middle of which lies a stone nine palms high from the ground and twenty-two long, whereon they say the footprint is; although others testify, on the contrary, that they found there nothing but a dirty depression be-oiled by the lamps which the pilgrims leave there, who as they go down always take a little of the earth, which they consider sacred. Although many Sinhalese ascribe it [the footprint] to Buddha, Herr Baldaens states that not only they, but also the people of Siam, are in the habit of talking about Adam, and to this day shew his footprint impressed upon a stone on the summit of a mountain (of which we have spoken before), being $1\\frac{1}{2}$ ell long, $\\frac{3}{4}$ ell broad, and the sole of the foot going $\\frac{1}{4}$ ell down in the stone. It is set round the edge with silver, and there is an elegant temple built near, around which many Siamese priests and other people of the country dwell. These priests shewed a party of our people in March, 1654 . . . . . . a gold plate representing the length and breadth of the foot, on which were various figures which they said were to be seen formerly in the footprint itself, but that after the priests allowed them to be engraved on the gold they disappeared from the stone. These figures were 68 in number, and may be seen figured by Baldaens in his description of Coromandel, Vol. 154, with several other matters relating thereto.\n\nCompare the \u015ar\u012b P\u00e1da stones engraved in Fergusson's \"History of Eastern Architecture.\" Valentyn then describes in great detail two galleries of rock-cut chambers containing figures of Buddha (\"Adam\"), and minutely specifies the dimensions of eyes, nose, mouth, head, hands, arms, fingers, nails, &c. In the lower gallery were two chambers hewn out of the cliff, and each containing one colossal figure in the usual Nirw\u00e1\u1e47a attitude, with various smaller erect and sitting figures. In the upper gallery were four chambers, the largest called\nRaja Maha wih\u0101re. Then he describes a detached rock-chamber on the other side of the mountain:\n\n. . . . wherein lies a figure 9 ft. 10 in. in length, called after a certain Sinhalese woman (\"Diegod\u0101 Mahage\") who caused it to be made.\n\nThen again:\n\nOn the top of this mountain [which he now calls \"Mokeregalla\" otherwise called \"Adam's Peak\"] stands a white tower, which is 44 feet 3 in. in circumference, and 16 feet high. This mountain is flat on the top, and planted with several trees, and was at times sown with kurakkan. The sea can also be seen from its summit, although it is several miles distant.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, with regard to the large and small figures of the Sinhalese, that they shew the same attitudes reclining, standing, or sitting, and also the same expression, with their hands uplifted or olded and upraised fingers, as the idols of the Siamese.\n\nThe following letter from Mr. Helmont to H. E. Governor Symons gives us further light on this subject:\n\nNoble, Honourable, &c., &c., Sir,\u2014In conformity with Your Excellency's command, I reply thereto with all respect that Adam's Peak, as far as I remember, lies two days' journey from M\u00e1tara, and close by the Company's estate of Markatta. At the foot there is a large hewn chamber divided by a wall into two portions; in the one lies a huge naked figure with a yellowish body, brown eyebrows, red lips, and long ears, with the hand under the head, and the legs one above the other, called Adam by the Sinhalese; in the other a corresponding figure, of similar shape, a woman, called Eva; and I remember well that the nose of the former was measured out of curiosity in my presence, in the year 1690, by the Rev. Predicant Feico Wylsma, and found to be over a foot in length. From this cave you proceed by a flight of freestone steps, built dry without lime, up above where, on account of its steepness, you cannot go round the mountain. There is little space to walk and only to follow your guide. There are two smaller chambers: in the one Adam, with the Patriarchs, dressed as 'Baljadoors' of a heathen Pagoda, painted on the wall, and in the\nnext one Eva, with her legs crossed under her body, on a stone shelf like an altar, and an erect snake going up behind her back and over her head as if picking her brains, in the midst of her sons, of whom the eldest is discerned by his size, being the same as his mother life-size hewn out of stone. Outside there is a square shelf of which the border is inscribed with characters which no one can read, but which were explained. Near one of these small chambers one climbs up by means of a great iron chain soldered into the mountain [probably on standards, for which the sockets were seen by the writer on his recent ascent] and hewn steps, to near the top, which is reached by an ugly crevice in the following manner. Five, or six, or more blacks go up on their bellies climbing over each, other the lower one holding the upper by the legs. The topmost reaches out his hand, grasps the handle at the end of the chain, and so pulls up to the top, where there is nothing but a sham Pagoda and Devil's tree, the leaves of which are like the points of pikes. This tree shoots through a cleft in the rock an ever-flourishing root, whose sap is caught drop by drop in a chatty set near, and is considered of great value for many purposes, and held in great esteem as a cure for impotence.\n\nHe then describes the truly miraculous effect of a few drops upon women, but adds that he has not had an opportunity of observing its effect upon their virtue. It would be extremely interesting to know, whether these caves really exist, either on Adam's Peak itself or in some of the hills of the Peak range. Perhaps, if some of the gentlemen connected with the Revenue Service, of whom several are members of this Society, were to enquire from priests and headmen, some tradition would be discovered which would lead to their identification. The writer has been informed by the old priest of Aluwih\u00e1re that there are rock-cut shrines at the base or half-way up Adam's Peak, that the approaches are now overgrown with jungle, and that no one dare make the ascent; that they lie on the west side. Possibly the priest has framed his answer in accordance with what he saw was the anxiously-expected answer, regardless of strict truth.\nIt would appear that the caves, or rock-hewn chambers, now used as shrines in Ceylon are not of any great antiquity as shrines from the following considerations:\n\n(1) The principal figure is in all cases the Buddha in Nirw\u0101\u1e47a.\n(2) The figure is of colossal size.\n(3) It is not of hewn stone, but of composition, and is painted and plastered.\n(4) The erect or sitting figures where found are mere accessories.\n(5) That the caves are immensely older than the figures in them is evident from the figures not being hewn in situ, but built up of chunam and brick, &c.\n(6) That the caves are of recent use as Buddhist shrines may be inferred from the character of the fa\u00e7ades by which they are closed in. These are plain to meanness, devoid of all attempt at decoration, being generally sun-dried brick laid in mud, rubble stone dry or in lime, or even plain mud walls.\n\nBut the writer is of opinion that these caves are of great antiquity, and have been used in past ages as refuges from floods and wild animals in the low-country, and from wild animals and hostile tribes in the hill-country. By mere difficulty of access as at Adam's Peak, Dambulla, Aluwih\u0101re and Dunumad\u0101lakanda, &c., they are eminently fitted as places of refuge; and from the commanding view which they in all cases give of the country round by which the smoke of the fire of any pursuing party by day, and the flame by night, could be readily detected, they would serve as natural forts in a primitive age.\n\nAt the caves of Aluwih\u0101re, near Mat\u00e1l\u00e9, may be seen a stone exactly similar to one discovered among some cave-dwellings in the Rhone valley, and figured by Mons. Louis Figuier in his \"L'Homme Primitif\" as a polishing stone used for polishing flint weapons.\n\nWhen by gradual civilization the forest aborigines learned to make huts without the help of Nature, and to fortify their\nhamlets in a rude way, these refuge places would naturally be adopted with the first uprising of any primitive form of natural religion as places pre-eminently fitted for the performance of worship. It has struck the writer when, in travelling in the Northern forests for miles under overarching trees, he has come upon some bald black rock, and, ascending its summit, has found a scooped-out water tank, a ruined d\u00e1goba, and a lovely view of nature, that the tank which has outlived the flimsy dry brick d\u00e1goba was in existence centuries before the religion was revealed to which the d\u00e1goba was dedicated,\u2014that the hill is the holy place of some primitive worship, probably of fire, and has been adopted by a later faith in a manner common throughout the world.\nPreliminary Notice.\n\nPali Text Society.\n\nCommittee of Management.\n\nHon.

NEVILL, ESQ., C.C.S.\n\nIn the very complete compilation of ancient accounts of Ceylon, which Sir E. Tennent gives in the first Volume of his work on the Island, he proceeds (after giving most interesting notices of the emporium in Taprobane, or Serendib, through which the luxuries of Eastern Asia were gathered for the markets of the West) to adduce reasons, which appeared to him plausible, as to the identification of the ancient Kalah with the modern Galle.\n\nHe first clearly shows the errors into which Bertolacci and other authors had fallen, and then suggests the fresh site, in which, as I now hope to prove, he was deceived by a mere similarity of sound.\n\nIn the first place, we at once fail to trace on our S.W. coast the numerous Islands lining the shore, which form so striking a portion of the description of the earlier writers.\nAgain, the cramped and rocky creek known as Galle Harbour can scarcely be identified with the capacious 'limen' or lagoon, and tranquil inland water, which is often spoken of in connection with the emporium of Kalah.\n\nFurther, we have every reason to regard the Galle neighbourhood as of comparatively recent civilization, and possessing few ancient historical traditions, and no ancient historical remains. Neither in the extreme corner of the kingdom ever guarded for its legitimate Sovereigns by the loyal, brave, and independent mountaineers of Ruhuna, can we trace the half Tamil district of Kalah, which owned the sway of the Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Zabedj, the Sultans of the Isles, who, as Cosmas in A.D. 550, (supported by Abou Zeyd in A.D. 900,) tells us were '\u1f10\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd' 'opposed to, or independent of, each other,' when spoken of in conjunction with the King who had the Hyacinth.\n\nIt may be well to remark here that the recurring expression 'the King who has the Hyacinth,'* scarcely refers to the great gem that was mounted on the pinnacle of a lofty dagoba, and is celebrated by the travellers to the royal city; or yet to the blue statue of Buddha described by Fa Hian, but rather means 'the King who had the country where the Hyacinth was found,' i.e. Sabaragamuwa and the adjacent Highlands, anciently included in Ruhuna.\n\nFurther, as we are told by Abou Zeyd, between the kingdom with the emporium and the Hyacinth country lies the pepper country\u2014a remark positively not applying to Galle, but at once understood, if we admit, as I hope hereafter to show is the case, that Kalah is the N.W. coast between the Arippu river (the ancient Kadamba) and the Deduru-oya; when the expression may be amplified into, between Puttalam District and the Adam's Peak District lies the plain of the Kelani river and\n\n* \"\u1f41 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f51\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\" (Cosmas Indicopleustes)\u2014Tennent, Ceylon, Vol. I. p. 591.\nthe Mah\u00e1-oya, which through all tradition has been and still is, the 'pepper country'; or, in still conciser terms, between Kalah and Ruhuna is the M\u00e1y\u00e1-ra\u1e6da.\n\nMany other arguments might here be adduced, and some will be alluded to further on, but I think it is even already sufficiently shown that Galle was not the ancient centre of Kalah, the Tarshish of Solomon's fleets, and the rendezvous of Arabs, Persians, Indians, Syrians and Chinese.\n\nWe will now proceed to consider a number of facts, which, when aggregated, render it probable, or even certain, that the district alluded to on the N.W. coast was the great emporium of the Eastern trade\u2014the Kalah kingdom. In A.D. 50, when Claudius was Emperor at Rome, a ship sent to collect the revenues of Arabia was caught by the winds and borne to Hippuros, the bold point still known as Kutiraimalai or 'Horse Hill,' and which has from the dimmest dawn of tradition been, what it still is, the landmark of sailors, and a sacred spot at which they to this day make suitable offerings to appease winds and waters.\n\nHere the mariners were hospitably received, and after a short stay returned to Rome with an embassy from the King of that district, which, as Pliny tells us, consisted of four persons, the highest bearing the name of Rachia.\n\nCasie Chetty (Jour. A.S., Ceylon, 1848, p. 78.) has proved that Rachia is a corruption of A'r\u00e1chchiya, and not as Sir E. Tennent fancied, a form of R\u00e1j\u00e1, since that title was never used for persons of the rank selected for such missions.\n\nNow in this very remarkable embassy to Rome from a point of N.W. Ceylon, we have the most extraordinary confirmation of my views regarding the site of the ancient trade.\n\nFor though Pliny gives us a full account and minute description of the Ambassadors, and the details they gave of their country, yet he never even gives a hint that Hippuros was an out of the way and unknown port, but on the contrary we\nare naturally left to believe that once there, the mariners recognised the country, knew their way home, and ran no further risk.\n\nAlso had there not been regular intercourse between that port and the Red Sea, how would the Romans have found their way home? and is it likely an embassy would have been sent had it not been recognised that there was no difficulty in the relations of the two countries? On the contrary, once arrived, having recruited their strength, the sailors start off home as if on a beaten track, and without comment on their safe return, bring an embassy and presents. Further, from Pliny's silence, there can be no doubt the embassy went home, and was not condemned to a perpetual exile at Rome; and in consequence doubtless of its safe return with presents, we find another arriving in Rome, when Julian was Emperor.\n\nFifty years later still, in A.D. 110, Ptolemy gives his wonderful map taken down from the narratives of sailors, which clearly shows how well our N.W. coast was known even in its minutest details, and the course of its rivers inland.\n\nIn A.D. 410 Palladius writes, on the faith of a Theban merchant, that in the neighbourhood are a thousand islands, one group called Maniol\u00e6, and five large rivers.\n\nNow, in the boundaries assumed for Kalah we have a chain of islands recently joined and forming the Akkara-pattu of Kalpi\u1e6diya, the long island of K\u00e1rativu (no doubt then a group of detached islets), and various others scattered from Puttal\u00e1m to Kutiraimalai, while on the North are Mann\u00e1r, R\u00e1messaram, and the adjacent group, parts of which are now connected by sandbanks, and form Adam's bridge; doubtless the Maniol\u00e6. Beyond these again are the islands of Jaffna, Delft and many others.\n\nBy this hypothesis the untenable supposition of Sir E. Ten- nent and M. Landresse, that the far distant M\u00e1ldives were referred to, is at once avoided.\nThe five rivers accurately answer to the Arippu or Kadamba river, the Kal\u00e1-oya, the Morachchikatti river near Kutiraimalai, the M\u00ed-oya and the D\u00e9duru-oya.\n\nIn A. D. 550 Cosmas, writing the travels of Sopater, tells how on that trader\u2019s arrival at the emporium he learned that the Hyacinth was found beyond the pepper country. This, the ancient M\u00e1y\u00e1-r\u0101\u1e6da, the Mah\u00e1wansa tells us was bounded on the North and South respectively by the D\u00e9duru-oya and the Kelaniganga, accurately enclosing and dividing the \u2018pepper\u2019 from the \u2018gem\u2019 districts and the district in which was the emporium.\n\nAgain, he says around it are a multitude of small islands containing fresh water and thickly covered with palms producing the Indian and the aromatic nuts.\n\nIn the islands now forming the Akkara-pattu as far as Kalpi\u1e6diya are abundant proofs of ancient groves of cocoanut and palmyra palms, and the latter from which palm-sugar, and a sweet paste called p\u016bnatu, is prepared, was perhaps the aromatic nut, and not the areka, which is a hill-growing species and not likely to have been valued by the Western traders. It is also of course possible the aromatic nut was not grown but imported for export, and Cosmas\u2019 informers mistaken in their statement.\n\nWith regard to the special notice of the abundance of fresh water even at this day, all visitors are surprised to find that excellent water may be got in all the islands, and the Akkara-pattu, at a foot or so in depth, while on the mainland water is extremely scarce, only obtained by deep wells and ancient tanks.\n\nSopater was presented to the King of the district in which was the emporium, who was independent of, or opposed to, the King that had the Hyacinth.\n\nIn A. D. 850 Soleyman, a trader who had made many voyages, described Adam\u2019s Peak and the district around as that which produced the gems, thus identifying the Hyacinth country of Cosmas with that part of Ruhuna.\nThe Island was then (A.D. 850) still subject to its two Kings, he tells us. When in his continuation of this work Abou Zeyd describes Ibn Wahab's voyages (Tennent's Ceylon, Vol. I, p. 587) the still water lagoons in which he so delighted, and where he spent months in coasting about, could only have been one of the lagoons either of Jaffna, Kalpi\u1e6diya, or Batticaloa, \"and it is evident from the narratives of Soleyman and Ibn Wahab, that ships availing themselves of the monsoons to cross the Indian Ocean, crept along the shore to Cape Comorin, and passed close by Adam's Bridge to reach their destined ports.\"\n\nAt page 591 of the same work it is said:\u2014\"The assertion of Abou Zeyd as to the sovereignty of the Maharaja of Zabedj at Kalah, is consistent with the statement of Soleyman, that 'the Island was in subjection to two monarchs.'\"\n\nIn this we find still another strong support for our argument, since the whole N.W. coast and Jaffna has from the most ancient times been peopled by Tamils and Moors, thus accounting for the district being under the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1s of Zabedj, who from B.C. 100 to A.D. 700 extended their empire and ruled the Malay Islands, Kalah, and Travancore; and it satisfactorily accounts for the silence preserved by the priestly annalists of the Kings who possessed the Hyacinth, as to the commercial wealth of their rivals who governed the territory in which was the great emporium.\n\nSir E. Tennent also quotes the \"Garsharsp-Namah\" of about the 10th century, in which the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 having requested Persian aid against the \"Shah of Serendib,\" one Baku, a fleet is sent, which lands at Kalah and obtains a signal victory over Baku; and this seems authentic, as the empire of Zabedj was then breaking up, and the Kalah Viceroy likely to seek aid from Persia, whose merchants profited so largely by its trade, and indirectly proving the old enmity between Ruhuna and Kalah, a feud at once understood as between the Tamil port and the Sinhalese capital, but not applicable to Galle.\nThis Baku may have been only a General, or he may have been the Par\u00e1krama P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0di or B\u00e1hu, who in 1059 was* Viceroy of Ruhuna according to the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, which also refers to the Solian conquest and frequent irruption of foreigners during the end of the 10th century.\n\nBaku in either case is no doubt a corrupt spelling of B\u00e1hu.\n\nStill later in 1347 Ibn Batuta visited the district where the traders went for cinnamon, and landing at a place called \u2018Batt\u0101la\u2019 (either Puttalam or some port nearer the Battala-oya) whence he crossed a river (the D\u0113duru-oya) and reached the port of \u2018Sal\u0101wat,\u2019 still called in Sinhalese by that name, a little on the Battala side of which the infidel King\u2019s territory ceased, thence turning inland he reached \u2018Kank\u0101r\u2019 (? Gang\u0101 \u015bripura), either Gampola or one of the Sabaragamuwa towns on the K\u0113lani-ga\u1e45ga, and ascending Adam\u2019s Peak he descended to \u2018Dinaur\u2019 (Dem-nuwara, Devundara), or Anglice Dondra, whence he returned by \u2018K\u0101li\u2019 and \u2018Kolamb\u016b,\u2019 then a flourishing port, to \u2018Batt\u0101la.\u2019\n\nThis route would have been from Dondra, by the ancient port of Weligam and the village of Hinidum, through the Walall\u00e1wi\u1e6di-k\u00f3ral\u00e9 to Kalutara, and not Galle; and \u2018K\u0101li,\u2019 doubtless is a corruption of the word Kalu-ga\u1e45ga-tara=Kalutara, i.e. the ferry over the black (kalu) river.\n\nI would here invite special attention to the expression \u201cthe infidel King\u201d used by Ibn Batuta, when contrasting the King of the district in which was the port with the Buddhist King who ruled the rest of Ceylon. Its use by the Arabian in this context shows the King of Kalah was not a Buddhist, but of a religion hostile to that of the priestly annalists, who drew up the chronicles of the Kings of Anur\u00e1dhapura and Polonnaruwa, and accounts for their silence upon the flourishing port and busy commerce settled in the maritime state of\n\n* Lee\u2019s \u201cTravels of Ibn Batuta,\u201d 1829, pp. 183\u2014191.\nKalah, the *point d'appui* as it were of the hated Tamils, so hostile to their religion.\n\nHaving pointed out how well the site I have given corresponds with ancient descriptions, I will adduce analogies to its ancient name of Kalah, far surpassing that of 'K\u0101li' (Kalutara) and Galle; for though a more fallacious ground could not be selected as the base of an argument, yet it may be a corroborative proof of value when taken in connection with other and more direct proofs.\n\nIn the district between the Arippu-river and D\u0113duru-oya the principal river is the Kal\u0101-oya, or 'Kalah-river'\u2014the port of Kalpitiya is still called by the natives Kalputti, *i.e.* 'the Kala sandbanks'\u2014the opposite point on the mainland is K\u0101rat\u012bvu, *r & l* being mutable, and the name signifying 'Kalah Island.'\n\nIn the commencement of this paper I have alluded to the absence of ancient historical remains, and traditions in the neighbourhood of Galle; let us see how far the proposed site is supported by such corroboration.\n\nWhen Wijaya landed and founded the historical dynasty of Ceylon, he arrived near the mouth of the M\u00ed-oya at the present Puttalam, B. C. 543.\n\nHe thence proceeded a short distance inland, where, after marrying the daughter of one of the Native Chiefs, he gradually extended his power, till from his capital of Tammanna Nuwara he acquired possession of the greater part of the Island, and ultimately became so strengthened by bands of adventurers from the coast, that he repudiated his wife and native allies, reducing many to the rank of slaves.\n\nAlthough the annalists of the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 confine the narrative to the conquerors, and have only sneers for the aborigines, the so-called Yakkhos and N\u00e1gas, yet it is clear the assertion of their previous utter barbarity is quite unfounded, and we have abundant proofs that they had attained considerable civilization, although inferior to that of their Aryan invaders. Thus\nwe are told that one of their towns was called La\u1e45k\u0101pura, and was the capital of the kingdom; hence they had a King and Chiefs under him, they had gathered into towns and were not mere savages or (as one popular idea supposes) the same as the present Rock Veddas;* also they understood jewellers' craft, since a \"throne of gems\" was an object of strife.\n\nWhere Wijaya first landed, the Princess whom he married was met near the tank, though this tank was doubtless used merely as a reservoir of water and not for irrigation; while\u2014most important\u2014here the Princess or Chieftain's daughter distributed rice to his followers, which was obtained from the shipwrecked boats of mariners. Now, had there not been considerable commerce on the shore of the lagoon, it is clear rice would not have so occurred, not from one special wreck, but from the wrecked boats, as if such were of frequent occurrence. This, too, is supported by the tradition extant (*Pien-i-tien*, Book LXVI.) when the Chinese travellers Hiouen-Thsang and Fa-Hian heard that Wijaya had come as a merchant to the district, and there, by his tact gradually acquired royal power. I think we must deduce that the emporium of Ceylon existed as a trading station long prior to his advent.\n\nIt may be well at some length to notice the tradition as recorded by these ancient Chinese authors. Hiouen-Thsang, who\u2014unlike the simple matter-of-fact Fa-Hian\u2014has always a ready ear for, and pen to record, the romantic, says the tradition was that a South Indian Princess on her way to be married, with her retinue, was waylaid by a King of the lions, and carried off captive to his mountain home, where she bore him a son and daughter. When the son attained puberty, he consulted with his mother and arranged to escape with her and his sister to her people. With this object he carefully explored the mountain paths, and at last succeeded in his plan and escaped with\n\n* S. \u0935\u0947\u0926\u094d\u0927, v\u0113dd\u014d.\nhis mother and sister. The mother, however, having warned him his parentage would disgrace him in the eyes of her countrymen, they concealed the real nature of his father. Meanwhile the King-lion ravaging the neighbouring lands in search of his family, the King of the land to which the lion-son had gone was in extreme peril from him, on which the lion-son treacherously killed his own father with a dagger\u2014the father dying with forgiving love to his son.\n\nOn the \u00e9claircissement that ensued, the King deciding he must not break his pledge of reward, and also refusing to allow the parricide to remain in his territory, equipped two vessels, and in one sent off the lion-son with a retinue of men to seek his fortune, and in the other sent off a retinue of women. The history is here silent, but as the ships were sent off in this manner, each on its own course, it is only natural to suppose the lion-son\u2019s sister and mother were banished in that with a female retinue, which is said to have gone towards Persia. That which contained the lion-son and his male retinue reached \u201cthe isle of jewels,\u201d and as many valuable articles of merchandize were procurable there, they settled, and after killing some of the chief merchants already settled there, married their widows and established a kingdom, calling it \u201cthe Lion-kingdom.\u201d\n\nWe have only here to understand by lion, not the quadruped but a Gangetic hill chieftain, with the title of Sinha (not uncommon), and the tradition is a highly probable partial account of the origin of the Tamil coast race (which I assume to be the Yakkhos of ancient accounts) as settled in N.W. and E. Ceylon, in the country of the N\u00e1gas or aboriginal snake worshippers.\n\nThis is again supported by a passage in Upham\u2019s R\u00e1j\u00e1vali (p. 168) not hitherto connected with the above tradition. In this second legend the R\u00e1j\u00e1vali says that the Yakkhos came to Ceylon when the country was lying devastated and depopulated by the wars between R\u00e1ma and R\u00e1wa\u1e47a.\nIn combination we have from these traditions a very consistent story, that when the aboriginal (N\u00e1ga) race of Ceylon was weakened by the Indo-Aryan invasion perpetuated in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, a subsequent Tamil colony came from the South of India, established itself as Yakkhos, and was organised by an out-cast Prince of mixed Gangetic and South Indian blood, who landed at a port frequented by merchants already settled there, attracted by productions affording a lucrative trade.\n\nThis we may call the pre-Wijayan era, and accounts for the Gangetic and Br\u00e1hman Wijaya arriving at its port when the Island was inhabited by two races\u2014N\u00e1gas (snake worshippers)* and Yakkhos (probably a form of Saivites).\n\nHiouen-Thsang goes on to relate that 500 demon women, who lived in one of the towns, seduced a party of merchants who had arrived to trade, and each bore a son to her paramour. Their Queen, who seduced the chief merchant, bore a son who, after his father, whose name was Seng-kia (Sin\u1e25a) was called Seng-kia-lo.\n\nThe legend goes on to tell how Seng-kia-lo secretly deserted his wife after her lavish kindness: how she followed him to a neighbouring kingdom and implored him to return to her, and upbraided him with his ingratitude: how he replied she was of demon origin, justifying his repudiation: and how on her appealing to the King, he, struck with her beauty and moved with pity, took her to wife and protected her: how during the night all the inmates of the palace were murdered and mutilated, and on the next morning the refugee announced to the people that his wife was a devil, and in the night had flown to Ceylon, and fetched a party of other devils, who had killed and eaten the inmates of the palace and the King who had just married her. On this he was elected King, and proceeded at once to form an army and return to Ceylon, where he entirely conquered the Island, exterminating many of its\n\n* Note (1).\ninhabitants, and driving away the others to a neighbouring Island, and then, having destroyed their town, established a kingdom in his name \"Seng-kia-lo\" (Sinhala) to which people rapidly collected from other countries. Let us treat this as a true tradition, merely garnished by the persons who gave it to Hiouen-Thsang with the false representation that the unhappy wife was really a devil, as it suited her betrayer to represent when he effected the murder of the King, who had taken her part against him, together with the inmates of the palace. It is scarcely surprising the Buddhist annalists omitted to record in their chronicles this horrible crime and the successful conspiracy that brought Seng-kia-lo back from India again, to the land of his birth, as a conqueror of the whole land; nor, priding themselves on their pure Gangetic race, would the Kings descended from Wijaya care to see it recorded that Wijaya was the son of a Gangetic Chief and a Yakkho Princess. On the other hand, there was absolutely no inducement for Hiouen-Thsang to invent the story, had it not been the current oral tradition.\n\nI should also here refer to the extract from the Pradipik\u00e1wa, given by Alwis at page xxv of the Introduction to his Sidat Sangar\u00e1wa, in which Gurulug\u00f3mi* quotes from the lost Atuv\u00e1s (original Sinhalese commentaries on the P\u00e1li Scripture) compiled B.C. 92.\n\nHe says: \"'Since King Sinhab\u00e1hu took the Sinha (lion) captive, he was (called) Sinhala, and his descendants were (thence also called) Sinhala,' so the name Sinhala is derived from the circumstance of the lion being taken captive by Sinhab\u00e1hu,\n\n* Gurulug\u00f3mi, the learned Thero of Aluvih\u00e1r\u00e9 (M\u00e1tal\u00e9 District), says the legend, wrote Am\u00e1watura at his sister's request for the instruction of his nephew. Said the mother:\u2014\"Brother, the diction is not good; my son's style needs improving.\" Then he wrote Pradipik\u00e1wa; and yet the student of Sinhalese prose \"undefiled\" (Elu) may perhaps best study Gurulug\u00f3mi's earlier work.\u2014H.

With reference to the reign of Wijaya, I follow the Mah\u00e1vansa in giving it as 38 years. May we not suppose the Sul\u016b R\u00e1ja Ratn\u00e1kara gives it as 30 years, because the former dates his reign from his accession on his father Sihhab\u00e1hu\u2019s death, and the latter from his return from India at the head of an army to conquer the Island? The new light thrown upon the subject by the Chinese accounts renders this explanation highly probable.\nyounger brother Sumit to rule the paternal kingdom Sinhapura, established the kingdom of Lakdiva (La\u0144k\u00e1), but was succeeded by his nephew (Panduwas D\u00e9va), son of Sumit who left Sinhapura to ascend the throne of Lakdiva.\n\nI think I can scarcely leave this part of my subject without alluding to another legend of the R\u00e1j\u00e1navali that is also unnecessarily regarded as an idle falsehood. This is the story that during the life of Gautama Buddha he caused a fire to break out in Ceylon which drove away the Yakkhos who had subsequently to the R\u00e1ma era taken possession of the part of Ceylon, where Buddha foresaw his religion would be greatly cherished. This fire, we are told, drove the Yakkhos to the sea and to the Island of Yakgiridivayina, and by depopulating the land of these Yakkhos prepared the way for its settlement by the race destined to introduce the Buddhist cult.*\n\nLet us merely suppose that Mahinda and his disciples learned when building their temples at Anur\u00e1dhapura, that a former city had existed on that spot, the inhabitants of which were driven from the country by an excessive period of heat and drought, during the life-time of Buddha himself. Can we wonder that such enthusiastic missionaries should seize the tradition, and by saying the drought and heat was a fire sent by Buddha, and not accidentally happening during his life, thus obtain a hold upon the faith of the newly-converted people and a special halo of sanctity upon their own mission? Nor in this connection must we forget the Abhayagiri monastery was itself founded on the site of an ancient temple of the former religion; and that in days before the large irrigation works were constructed there is nothing whatever forced or improbable in the tradition of such a drought.\n\n* Upham, \"Sacred and Historical Books of Ceylon,\" Vol. II., pp. 169-70.\nI think then these legends, thus connected, are all consistent, and show that after the wars of R\u00e1ma a second race, the Yakkhos, intruded in Ceylon from South India, drove out the enfeebled N\u00e1gas from the Anur\u00e1dhapura district, as they spread in from the N.W. coast and the trading ports, and were again driven back to the Coast and Islands by excessive heat and incessant drought, but subsequently, and about the Wijayan era, an Aryan race spread back again to the interior, where Wijaya's descendants formed again the city to which their Gangetic kinsmen came to preach the law of Buddha.\n\nFa-Hian naively tells us:\u2014\"This kingdom was originally uninhabited by man; only demons, genii [Yakkhos] and dragons [N\u00e1gas] dwelt there. Nevertheless, merchants of other countries trafficked with them. When the season for the traffic came, the genii and demons appeared not, but set forward their previous commodities marked with the exact price; if these suited the merchants, they paid the price and took the goods. As these traders went, and came, and sojourned, the inhabitants of other kingdoms learned that this country was very beautiful; these also came, and eventually established a great kingdom.\"*\n\nFa-Hian who went to Anur\u00e1dhapura about A.D. 410 direct from To-mo-li-ti in the Ganges (the T\u00e1malitti of the Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1 and almost on the site of Calcutta) says that he sailed thence by a trade wind to Ceylon in fourteen days and nights, (a surprisingly short time which accounts for the frequent intercourse between Ceylon and the Ganges). He took passage in one of some large vessels going on a merchant voyage to this Island. He proceeds to say that, arrived at Ceylon, \"to the right and to the left there are small islets to the number of a hundred; their distance from each other is in\n\n* Laidlay's \"Pilgrimage of Fa-Hian,\" translated from the Foe kou\u00e9 ki of MM. Remusat, Klaproth, and Landresse, 1848, pp. 332-3.\nsome cases 10 li, in others from 20 to 200 li; all are dependent upon the great Island.\u201d*\n\nThese islets answer perfectly to the islands of Jaffna, Delft, Iranaitivu, &c., on the one side of the Straits of Mann\u00e1r, and on the other to Mann\u00e1r and the connected islands with K\u00e1rat\u00edv\u00fa, Ipant\u00edv\u00fa, Dutch Bay, and the long peninsula of the Akkara-pattu of recent geological formation, and very likely a line of islands in A.D. 400, and the small islets of the Puttal\u00e1m lagoon, and the present peninsulas opposite Negombo and Chilaw. Fa-Hian goes on to say of the islands, \u201cMany precious things and pearls are procured there.\u201d\n\nHe further says:\u2014\u201cThere is a district which produces the jewel mo-ni [a red gem probably, by the context, ruby] and which may be about 10 li square. The King sends people thither to protect it, and when they have gathered the jewels he takes three pieces out of every ten.\u201d\n\nTen li would be three miles,* and this district of red gems was possibly Nuwara Eliya, and not Sabaragamuwa.\n\nThis independent testimony of a Chinese pilgrim to Anur\u00e1dhapura, in A.D. 410, is surely convincing proof that \u201cthe large ships\u201d then traded with the North-Western coast of Ceylon as the emporium, and his account identifies the islands of the Arabian voyagers, and the King who had the hyacinth, as already quoted from their narratives.\n\nIt was not until A.D. 850, when Soleyman visited it, that we hear of any traveller actually visiting and identifying the gem district, no doubt jealously guarded as a secret monopoly by the Kings of Anur\u00e1dhapura.\n\nThe fact that former writers overlooked our islands North and South of the Straits of Mann\u00e1r is not surprising,\u2014they are\n\n* Laidlay\u2019s \u201cPilgrimage of Fa-Hian,\u201d translated from the Foe koue ki of MM.

The stress laid on Sanchoniathon styling Ceylon \"the island of Rachius\" as an evident plagiarism from Pliny is to me a false argument, and the whole of his treatise on Ceylon is literally a correct account of an ancient journey from the Puttalam coast to a town near the modern Kurun\u00e9gala, one of the most ancient districts of former civilization. Philo's island of Rachius may clearly be 'the R\u00e1j\u00e1's Island,' while Pliny's Rachia is 'A'rachchiya,' an approximation at once perceptible. All throughout the N.W. coast of Ceylon, and as far in the interior as Anur\u00e1dhapura and Kurun\u00e9gala, the whole country is one continuous scene of ancient settlements. The extensive ruins of Tammann\u00e1 Nuwara near Puttalam, and the adjacent town and tank of Mah\u00e1-tabuwa are known, and a constant succession of reservoirs and hewn stones mark the site of old villages and towns.\n\nThese reservoirs are principally tanks made solely to preserve water, and not like the historical ones of the Buddhist annals as sources for irrigation.\n\n* Note (2).\n\u2020 Tenment, \"Ceylon,\" Vol. I, pp. 571-7.\nWe can scarcely expect, however, the trading ports of the coast to afford ruins, such as are seen on the site of the Buddhist cities of the interior, for the trading cities on the coast are said to have been singularly tolerant of all religions, and hence it is probable none were very dominant, while the King being only a Viceroy his palace would be a modest one. Now, except temples and palaces, it is well known no other buildings were built in a permanent way in ancient times, and so we must not be surprised that the trade which swept our coasts has left no very elaborate traces of its progress.\n\nAgain, perhaps I may notice as singularly illustrative of the hereditary nature of many qualities, that the villagers in the Tamil Wanni and Demala-pattu preserve to this day their characteristic hatred of any intrusion and their love of retirement. Just as in the days of the merchant sailors of Kalah the Yakkhos are described as hiding from sight, and leaving their merchandise on the shore for exchange: so we still find them withdrawing their houses from the busy high roads that now connect Puttalam with Kurun\u00e9gala and Anur\u00e1dhapura, and altogether abstaining from mixing in the commerce around them or the colonies of settlers that have come among them.\n\nI must also notice that at Kalaputti, or Kalpi\u1e6diya, during various excavations, large quantities of coins, gold and copper, have been brought to light, and of the latter the commonest bear the name of S\u00e1hasa Mallawa, who reigned over Ceylon in A.D. 1202, though the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa tells us that he was deposed after two years,\u2014two facts apparently at variance with each other and requiring explanation; others are of L\u00edl\u00e1wat\u00ed and Dharm\u00e1soka D\u00e9wa.\n\nFrom the vast amount of treasure buried through some miles of the country shortly after A.D. 1202, it is clear there must have been at that time some great and unexpected calamity and\ninvasion, so that it is probable that when the rule of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1s of Zabedj finally collapsed and their wide domains fell under different sway, the protection withdrawn from Kalah was the cause of successful forays and inroads from the opposite coast of India or the Sinhalese capital, and that the wealthy community was then broken up and its trade abandoned.\n\nFrom the absence of buried hoards of any extent before or after this date, there is no doubt no such previous invasion took place, and never since, for probably never again did it recover from the blow received.\n\nWithin four square miles in the memory of the older people, there has been found near Kalpi\u1e6diya probably as much as a thousand pounds' worth of hidden treasure, gold coins and copper being the principal, but even a gold statue having been dug up by the father of the present Tamil Mudaliy\u00e1r of the district.\n\nTo conclude, I have endeavoured to show that the emporium of Taprobane or Serendib, from B.C. 500 until a comparatively recent time, was not Galle, but the coast from Mann\u00far to the D\u00e9duru-oya (the Northern limit of the M\u00e1y\u00e1-rata): that it was separated from the capital of the Sinhalese by jealousies that account for the silence of the Sinhalese chronicles: and that it forms the Kalah so often referred to.\n\nAs to which point on its coast we are to regard as the emporium, I cannot on the data yet known decide. I incline to think however, that the coast around, and opposite to, Kalpitiya formed the centre of trade, and that the emporium was not one defined spot, but a cluster of petty ports all bartering the luxuries of the Far East for silver, and the wares of Europe, Persia, and Ethiopia; while the site of Tammann\u00e1 Nuwara with the adjacent ruins of Mah\u00e1-tabuwa was the Capital of the ruler who governed under the Sultans of Zabedj.\nThere remains only one further matter in relation to my subject to which I need still refer in recapitulation, and that is the bearing on it of the ancient accounts of the inhabitants of Ceylon before the Aryan immigration under and subsequent to Wijaya.\n\nThey are described as of two classes, Yakkhos and N\u00e1gas. I think it is now universally accepted that N\u00e1gas were an aboriginal tribe of snake worshippers, and formed, with an infusion of Aryan blood, the bulk of our present Sinhalese. What then were the Yakkhos? Have I not succeeded in showing there was from the Islands of Adam's Bridge on the North, down to the Deduru-oya near Chilaw on the South, an ancient trading district forming an emporium for the East and West, and under a separate ruler of its own, opposed to the Chief King of the N\u00e1gas at La\u0144k\u00e1pura and the Kings who succeeded Wijaya? What more natural than that the people of this colony of the empire of Zabedj should be the Yakkhos, or demon worshippers (? Saivites), as opposed to the N\u00e1gas, or snake worshippers, who were the aborigines of the rest of the Island; and what more probable than that as the Sinhalese of to-day represent the race of N\u00e1gas, so the Tamils of the Jaffna Wanni, Eastern Province, and the Puttalam District represent the Yakkhos who held the country in which was the port, and who were opposed to the N\u00e1gas who held the rest of the Island.\n\nNOTES.\n\n(1)\n\nI think the references here made to the Ceylon N\u00e1gas, as snake worshippers, perhaps justify the following note:\n\nIn the Ceylon Museum will be found the pottery image of a coiled cobra and also what looks like a lamp. These are of a peculiar and heavy pottery different to any I have yet seen from Ceylon. They were the only relics found under a crumbling heap of brickwork excavated on a little quoin rock in Bintenna, and are, as far as I know,\nthe only such recorded relics of the Ophid, or N\u00e1ga, cult in Ceylon.\n\nI was for a long while struck with surprise that the Ophid, or N\u00e1ga, image should have been enclosed in a mound of brick like a Buddhist relic, but on reading the notes in Fa-Hian\u2019s account of the combination of the Buddhist with the ancient Ophid cult at Samkassa (chapter xvii of Laidlay\u2019s translation) in this connection, I unexpectedly found Cunningham describing the ruins of the Ophid shrine as follows: \u201cIt is a small mound of ruined bricks dedicated to the worship of the N\u00e1ga. Nothing whatever is erected there; but whenever rain is desired the people proceed to the spot and pray for it. The period of annual worship however is the month of Bys\u00e1kh, [? Sinhalese, Wesak, \u0dc0\u0dda\u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dca] just before the commencement of the seasonal rains, when the village women go there in procession and make offerings of milk, which they pour out on the spot. This is no doubt the identical dragon (N\u00e1ga) which Fa-Hian mentions as appearing \u2018once every year,\u2019 from whose favour the people of Seng-kia-shi [this is Samkassa] obtained propitious rains and abundant harvests.\u201d\n\nI shall be excused for here further quoting the text of Fa-Hian (A.D. 400) to show the conclusive grounds for believing the Ophid cult actually witnessed by Captain Cunningham was practically identical with that witnessed by Fa-Hian. \u201cTheir stay being ended, the dragon assumes the form of a little serpent with two ears bordered with white. When the ecclesiastics perceive him, they present him with cream in a copper vessel\u2026 He comes out once every year.\u201d And again ante: \u201cIt is he who confers fertility and abundance on the country by causing gentle showers to fall upon the fields, and securing them against all calamities.\u201d\n\nI italicise two points in these accounts as worthy of attention: the one is the ascendancy of \u201cwomen\u201d in the Ophid ceremony, and the other is the expression \u201ctwo ears bordered with white.\u201d With reference to the former I draw attention to the ascendancy of woman as quite antagonistic to the usual Indo-Aryan customs, and suggest an additional deduction from it, that the Ophid cult was not of origin among an Indo-Aryan race; as to the snake, local knowledge enables me to\npoint out that there is a peculiar word always for the hood, or *pen\u00e9,* of the cobra, which would have no Chinese equivalent, and which it would be difficult for Fa-Hian to translate or express without a very long explanation. No doubt Fa-Hian when he says \"white ears\" means 'white sides to the hood'; and it is well known that in India and Ceylon this albino, or partially albino, cobra is not very uncommon, and regarded with special veneration.\n\nIt is generally known that if enquiry be made from any intelligent old Singhalese villager as to the habits of the cobra, he states that it has a special passion for new milk, and can always be enticed from its lurking place by a bowl of this delicacy. Are we to regard this belief as arising from fact, and originating milk as the offering made to the N\u00e1ga? or has a tradition that milk is the offering made given rise to the popular belief?\n\nThis is a most interesting question, and it is much to be wished one of our Members would experiment and report on the attraction milk or cream may, or may not, possess for the cobra.\n\nIn this connection I have asked my friend Mr. Haly, Director of the Ceylon Museum, if possible, to exhibit the N\u00e1ga and lamp presented by me to the Museum at the reading of this Paper, and also to exhibit for me two especially fine and ancient masks of the mythical King and Queen of the N\u00e1gas procured by me in the interior of the Southern Province, and still in my collection. I think it is possible what appears to be a lamp (found just in front of the snake) is in reality the dish for the offering of milk.\n\n(2)\n\nThis Paper is so largely mixed up with matter extracted from Fa Hian's travels, that the following notes on his account of Ceylon may be here appended:\n\n(i.) Firstly, observe the hitherto (as far as I know) neglected passage in which he, a devout Buddhist Priest, says the tradition in A.D. 400 was that the sacred B\u00f3 tree was grown at Anur\u00e1dhapura\n\n* S. \u0db4\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dda, 'the cobra's hood,' and \u0db4\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dcf\u0d9c\u0ddc\u0db6, *penagoba*, 'the inside of the extended hood.'\u2014Hon.

No doubt, I think, the Sinhalese chronicles have been tampered with, and the origin of the tree embellished since Fa-Hian wrote.\n\n(ii.) \"The Mountain without Fear\" is correctly identified in the notes to Laidlay's edition (p. 342) as the Abhayagiri Vih\u00e1r\u00e9.\n\n(iii.) With regard to the chapel \"Po-thi,\" should we not read this \"Bodhi\"? The Samanean's name we may safely read as \"Dharma-joti,\" for Tha-mo-ku-ti as it is written in Chinese\u2014a language unsuited to express Sanscrit more precisely. The \"stone house\" in which Dharmajoti lived with his rats and snakes is no doubt the literal rendering of 'cave,' still called by the Sinhalese gal-g\u00e9, \u0d9c\u0dbd\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda, 'stone house.'\n\n(iv.) Who were \"the merchants Sa-pho\"? I think this is worth enquiring, but, as far as I can see, the word must be a Chinese substitute for the original.\n\n(v.) As to the statue at the Abhayagiri Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 made of \"blue jasper\" and over 18 feet high, of what was the lustrous image really made? It is not conceivable so large a block of lapis lazuli could have found its way to Ceylon from North Asia, nor have turquoise or sapphire ever been heard of of such size.\n\nThe only approximate artificial product then known was the rare and beautiful blue glass used for the celebrated Portland vase, and the Theban pottery coated with a brilliant blue enamel like turquoise, of which small gods and amulets form the exquisite speciality of Egyptian antiquity. Is it possible this statue was made in Egypt for sale in Ceylon? Or that an ancient Egyptian god was brought to Ceylon for sale after its worship had died out in Egypt.\n\nAny fragment with blue enamel on it found among the d\u00e9bris near the Abhayagiri Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 should be carefully preserved, as its origin could at once be decided if Egyptian, and by encouraging a further search of the d\u00e9bris might lead to the partial recovery of an unique antiquity.\n(vi.) It is also desirable to note the tradition that the \"great tower 40 chang* high\" (? the Brazen Palace) was built over a footstep of Buddha.\n\n(vii.) The visit of the King to the Treasury of the Priesthood where the coveted \"Mo-ni\" (? ruby) was kept, will be found described in the Sinhalese chronicles, which, if my memory can be trusted, say the treasure chamber was under a D\u00e1goba to which they had access by a secret passage.\n\n(viii.) Fa-Hian describes the Dalad\u00e1 temple at Anur\u00e1dhapura in A.D. 410, as decorated \"with the seven precious things.\" It may not be out of place to draw attention to the Chinese interpretation of these. (See Fa-Hian, Laidlay's edition, chapter xiii, and note (4) by Klaproth.)\n\nTwo series are here given from the Chinese Buddhist writings, but I think they are scarcely in each case rightly translated, and propose the following corrections:\n\nFirst series.\n\n1.\u2014Sou-fa-lo\u2014(suvarna)=gold.\n2.\u2014A-lou-pa\u2014(r\u00fapiya)=silver.\n3.\u2014Lieou-li\u2014in the Kouan-king-sou called Fe\u00ef-lieou-li-y\u00e9 which signifies \"not far.\" This is explained as identical with Va\u00efd\u00fbrya (Sanscrit)\u2014the mountain Vid\u00fbra on which Va\u00efd\u00fbrya was found being \"not far\" (i.e., \"Vid\u00fbra\") from Benares. Burnouf translated Va\u00efd\u00fbrya as \"lapis lazuli.\" This I think is wrong. The hardness, the colour (green or blue), and the locality, all point to Oriental turquoise as the mineral here denoted, and there can be little doubt Lieou-li must be read \"turquoise\" and not \"lapis lazuli.\" I doubt the identification with Va\u00efd\u00fbrya, which I have always elsewhere construed as corundum or sapphire.\n\n4.\u2014Pho-li, or Se-pho-ti-kia (sphatika)=rock crystal.\n5.\u2014Meou-pho-lo-kie-la-pho. This is star sapphire or asteria, not fossil, ammonite as somewhat wildly conjectured; the rays of the\n\n* \"A chang is a measure of 10 Chinese feet, and the Chinese foot is 8 lines shorter than ours.\"\nstar form the spokes of the wheel. May we not recognise in the wheel formed by the star on a round gem of asteria, the sacred symbol of the wheel, which accounts for the present belief among some Oriental races that there is a god in the asteria, although they have forgotten the reason for their superstition, and substitute the god for the symbol?\n\n6.\u2014Mo-lo-kia-li=agate.\n\n7.\u2014Po-mo-lo-kia (padmar\u00e1ga)=ruby.\n\nWe must here notice this ancient origin of the still existing Ceylon superstition, that the finest rubies lie in the head of cobras. This extraordinary myth seems to have been an accepted matter when the Chinese authors wrote.\n\nMay we not now translate this myth as simply the exaggerated form that arose when the Indo-Aryan races began to confuse the N\u00e1gas (ophid cult) and Yakkhos (perhaps an early form of Saivites) with actual snakes and demons, in which secondary sense the original name of the races evidently came after a time to be used by the Aryan invaders?* It might then simply mean, the N\u00e1gas with whom rubies are found in a secret and jealously guarded place, instead of the rubies hidden in the head of the cobras and jealously guarded, as we have recently been too literally interpreting it.\n\nSecond Series.\n\n1.\u2014Po-lo-so=(prab\u00e1la) coral. Here I ask your attention to the Chinese account, that it was found on an Island to the S.W. [of the Gangetic countries or ? of China] and dredged by iron nets from submerged rocks [evidently at a great depth, or divers would have\n\n* \"Naglok (snake land) was at an early period a Hind\u00fa name for hell. But the N\u00e1gas were not real snakes\u2014in that case they might have fared better\u2014but an aboriginal tribe in Ceylon, believed by the Hind\u00fas to be of serpent origin,\u2014N\u00e1ga being an epithet for 'native.' The term is now used very vaguely. Mr. Talboys Wheeler, speaking of the 'Scythic N\u00e1gas' (History of India, Vol. I. p. 147), says:\u2014'In process of time these N\u00e1gas became identified with serpents, and the result has been a strange confusion between serpents and human beings.' In the 'Padma Pur\u00e1na' we read of 'serpent-like men.' The dreaded powers were from another tribe designated Yakkhos 'demons.'\"\u2014Conway, \"Demonology and Devil-lore,\" Vol.I., p. 151.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nbeen employed]. This account agrees with fact. On the S.W. coast of Ceylon at Balapitiya, a considerable quantity of small pieces of valuable red coral, much water-worn, are annually washed up during the S.W. monsoon. The site on which it grows is no longer known, possibly it may come from a great distance S.W. of our coast, though I am inclined to think not from such a distance as the Maldives.\n\nI have asked Mr. Haly to exhibit some coral picked up by me as above described.\n\n2.\u2014A-chy-ma-kie-pho (? asmagarbha). This is I think wrongly identified as amber. This transparent red substance should be translated carbuncle or garnet. It was in carbuncle that ancient Indian intaglios were cut, the translucency of the stone when cut thin giving great effect to the workmanship.\n\n3.\u2014Ma-ni or mo-ni=pearl.\n\n4.\u2014Chin-shou-kia\u2014a gem like the flower of the kimsuka tree (Butea frondosa) [see First Book, Indian Botany, Olliver], that is of an orange red colour. This unidentified substance should be translated Oriental topaz (yellow; pink or orange corundum), one variety of which satisfactorily answers to the description.\n\n5.\u2014Shy-kia-pi-ling-kia\u2014not translated. This may be read diamond. The word \"pi-ling-kia\" is evidently of common origin from Sanskrit, with the modern Sinhalese palingu (\u0db4\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd4), which is used for crystal.\n\n6.\u2014Mo-lo-kia-pho\u2014translated marakata, or emerald. I would suggest another interpretation of chrysoberyl, or cat's-eye.\n\nThe Indian cat's-eye (quartz) is of remarkable softness, and is cut even by a pen-knife. The two forms of cat's-eye may have been confused. Has the Chinese form \"Mo-lo-kia\" any origin in the Indo-Aryan word \"soft\" (S. molok, \u092e\u094b\u0932\u0915)? I am not myself scholar enough to say whether this word was then used in the Gangetic District in the sense of softness\u2014easy to cut. The same word occurs above possibly in Mo-lo-kia-li (agate), from which we learn vases were cut. I recall a passage in some old Oriental book\u2014I forget which, but think it is in the Ummagga Jataka\u2014in which this word moloka is used in reference to the softness of a thigh as a pillow. Perhaps one of our Members may be able to rectify my\nignorance by stating whether such a word for 'soft' was in Indo-Aryan usage in above sense of 'easy to cut.'\n\n7.\u2014Pa-che-lo.\u2014This is translated vajra, or diamond, and is clearly erroneous. The colour, we are told, is like that of an amethyst and the stone is used for engraving others. It must be translated sapphire or corundum.\n\nWe have in these (what the learned annotators of course could not see with the imperfect light then thrown on the minerals) a parallel series in colour, thus:\n\nLight \\{ gold=Oriental topaz=? sun=? life.\nsilver=pearl=? moon=? death,\n\nCrystal=diamond=? ether.\nAsteria=(emerald or) cat's-eye=? air.\nTurquoise=sapphire=? water.\nRuby=carbuncle=? fire.\nAgate=coral=? earth.\n\nBoth gold and silver have in the ancient books one four-fold attribute, of which \"changeless,\" \"indestructible,\" \"incorruptible,\" and \"omnipotent\" would be the euphonious transcription.\n\n\"The seven precious things\" might thus symbolise the five elements:\u2014ether which is supported by (? generating) air, air supported by (? generating) fire resting on water, and water supported by (generating) earth, all adorned by the attributes of gold and silver: that is changeless, indestructible, incorruptible, and omnipotent, in one sense, and combined with light\u2014i.e., sun and moon\u2014in another.\n\nThis is a well-known ancient symbol of the elements.\n\nA, ether\u2014B, air\u2014C, fire\u2014D, water\u2014and E, earth\u2014which, by adoption among Buddhists give rise to the present D\u00e1gobas, originally no doubt erected over his remains, and symbolically used to show the return of Gautama Buddha to the five primitive and indestructible elements. We should thus have the shape of the D\u00e1goba borrowed from the symbol of creation of an older cult by the Buddhists, and further illustration of it by the seven precious ornaments.\n\nIn addition, then, to the question of the colours probably symbolising the five elements with neither beginning nor end, I would suggest\nthe study amongst our Members of the question, whether in our ancient records there is any account showing that the five colours were applied separately to the different parts of the St\u00fapa or D\u00e1goba, which I suggest they may symbolise. Thus, whether the rectangular case was painted red, the dome was painted blue, &c.\n\nIt is quite possible the colouring of a St\u00fapa may have been so arranged and a record preserved thereof.\n\nTo recapitulate. I suggest these \"seven precious things\" are the symbol of a cult which taught that the five elements combined with light (sun and moon) are the origin of all things and source of creation. In detail we may read the symbol that by action of (light causing) fire (heat) on water resting on earth proceeds air penetrated by the apex of the triangle of fire (heat), above which rests ether from which the triangle fire radiates but into which it does not enter; thus giving us in ether, or the firmament above our atmosphere, combined with sun and moon, or light, the creative power which shaped the earth into its four other distinct elements. Bearing this in mind, a special interest will follow the work of local students, who will take the trouble to record the exact shape of the various St\u00fapas or D\u00e1gobas still existent, or adequately described in ancient records, as they gradually diverged from the primitive type.\n\nMy view of the original Buddhist symbolised theory of creation, here suggested, accounts for the early Buddhist writers classing the theory of creation of the contemporary sect they call \"strong-mouth\" as an heresy. This sect, existing in and established before the lifetime of Gautama Buddha, taught that ether begat air, air begat fire\u2014fire, heat\u2014heat, water\u2014water, ice\u2014and the ice solidified begat earth\u2014and earth begat five kinds of grain, which produce life, which when ended returns to ether.\n\nIt will be seen then \"the heresy\" would consist in the interpolation of a glacial period in the earth's stage of development into dry land, and the mediation of vegetation derived from land; thus the meaning veiled in the seven precious things of early Buddhism is closely akin\u2014but brings in the action of sun and moon, and omits glacial and vegetable influence on creation.\nON THE SINHALESE OBSERVANCE OF THE KAL\u00c1WA.\n\nBy L. NELL, Esq.\n\nSome time ago my attention was drawn to the belief of the common people amongst the Sinhalese in the kal\u00e1na (\u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf). This, according to the impression left on my mind, was some moveable principle or predisposition, moving in a certain course in the human body in accordance with the lunar calendar. The believers in the kal\u00e1na assert, that when it is in position on the crown of the head, the scratch of a pin on that part would be sufficient to cause death; so, on the day of this kal\u00e1na, women in some parts of the interior of the Island will decline to carry loads of firewood on the head. In like manner, on the new moon day labourers will not go into the jungle to clear it, on account of the risk of injuries to the toe of the foot. On the 6th day of the first half, and the 10th day of the second half, of the lunar month, it is considered dangerous to take a purgative medicine, the seat of the kal\u00e1na being then supposed to be in the belly. On the 7th day leeches should not be applied to the region of the chest.\n\nIn the case of a man, the kal\u00e1na rises, with the moon, from the big toe of the right foot, from part to part, till, on the 15th day of the moon, it reaches the crown of the head. It then descends in corresponding parts on the left side, till, on the 30th day, it reaches the big toe of the left foot, ready again to ascend on the right side. In the case of a woman, the movement is reversed, since it ascends on the left side and descends on the right, the positions being otherwise the same: that is, the kal\u00e1na ascends from the left great toe upwards to the crown of the head, then descends by the same degrees to the right toe. This corresponds to a principle in native\npalmistry, according to which the fortune of a male is told from the lines on his right hand, of a female from those on the left hand.\n\nI found subsequently that Tables of the kal\u00e1wa had been published in a Sheet Almanac, printed in a native vernacular press in Galle,\u2014in a Sinhalese Ephemeris for the year, printed in a pamphlet of 54 pages,\u2014and in a Sheet Almanac published by the press of the Lakrivikirana newspaper. Though this led to the idea that the subject was well known, I was surprised to find discrepancies when the Tables were translated. This led me to make personal enquiries during a short visit to the Bento\u1e6da District, where I questioned the learned priest, Kohomala Indus\u00e1ra, and a native Vedar\u00e1la or medical practitioner. I was surprised to find that the latter had little or no knowledge of a subject so important, apparently, in native medical science.\n\nIn the discussion with the priest, a difficulty arose from his division of the lunar month into sixteen kal\u00e1; namely, (1) Am\u00e1naka, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0d9a, the day on which the moon does not appear; (2) P\u00e9laviya, \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dba, the day on which the moon first appears; (3) Diyanaka, \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0d9a, the second day; (4) Tiyanaka, \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0d9a, the third day; (5) Jalawaka, \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0d9a, fourth; (6) Wis\u00e9niya, \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dda\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba, fifth; (7) Satanaka, \u0dc3\u0dad\u0db1\u0d9a; (8) Satanaka, \u0dc3\u0dad\u0db1\u0d9a; (9) Atanaka, \u0d85\u0da7\u0db1\u0d9a; (10) Namanaka, \u0db1\u0db8\u0db1\u0d9a; (11) Dasanaka, \u0daf\u0dc3\u0db1\u0d9a; (12) Ekalosnaka, \u0d87\u0d9a\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0db1\u0d9a; (13) Dolosnaka, \u0daf\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0db1\u0d9a; (14) Telesnaka, \u0dad\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dc3\u0db1\u0d9a; (15) Tudusnaka, \u0dad\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0db1\u0d9a; and (16) Pasalosnaka, \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0db1\u0d9a.\n\nThis, of course, omitting the day on which the moon does not appear, is the lunar calendar\u2014the full moon with the common people being known as the pahaloswaka-p\u00f3ya (\u0db4\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0d9a \u0db4\u0ddd\u0dba) or 'p\u00f3ya of the 15th lunar day.' The counting of the kal\u00e1 on which the moon does not appear introduces a\ndifficulty, since the kal\u00e1wa can ordinarily be only counted with 30 lunar days. The sixteen kal\u00e1, enumerated by the priest, therefore refer to the intervals between these \"days,\" and correspond to the 16th part of the disc of the moon, which will be referred to in a definition to be here quoted.\n\nIn the month during which I was making these enquiries, the new moon had risen on Wednesday, the 30th of March, at 3:52 P.M.: the first quarter, on Wednesday, the 6th of April, at 9:14 P.M.: the full moon on the next Thursday, at 5:9 P.M.: and the last quarter moon on Thursday, the 28th of April, at 3:44 P.M. So that, even taking the particulars given in an English Almanac, it must be a matter of difficulty for ordinary natives to fix the exact time of the commencement and close of each kal\u00e1wa, granting that it corresponds with a particular lunar day. This probably led to the neglect of this part of the native science in the empirical practice of the Vedar\u00e1las. It will also appear that even with the assistance of the native Tables (translations of which are appended), the science will be of difficult application till the limits of each kal\u00e1wa are more accurately limited. The duration of a particular kal\u00e1wa may, of course, be roughly recognized during some part of a lunar day, and the most ignorant native is usually aware of the principal phases of the moon from the practice of faithfully observing the p\u00f3ya days.\n\nL. De Zoyza, Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r, after kindly making enquiries at my request, wrote:\u2014\"I have received the explanation of two of the best Vedar\u00e1las here about the kal\u00e1wa; but they are somewhat contradictory, and I cannot make much sense of them. The truth is that their ideas of the matter are very vague.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances the derivation of the term is calculated to throw some light on the subject. According to the priest, already referred to, the term kal\u00e1 may be Sanskrit,\nP\u00e1li, or \u00c9lu, and means 'a share.' De Zoyza, M\u00e1ha-Mudaliy\u00e1r, pronounces it a Sanskrit, or P\u00e1li word, to which the following meanings have been given in the Dictionaries:\u2014(i) 'a part'; (ii) 'a fraction'; (iii) 'the 16th part of the Moon's disc'; (iv) 'a mechanical act;' (v) 'a division of time.' The kal\u00e1, \u0915\u0932\u093e, or Kal\u00e1na, \u0915\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e, in Sinhalese, of which we are now treating, he renders as 'the sixteenth part, or digit, of the moon's disc, which in some mysterious way ascends and descends in the human body.' As it is always difficult to apply a term of one language to translate a term of another accurately, each in its native use being associated with ideas foreign to the other, we must modify this definition. I think my original conception will consist with taking kal\u00e1na as a derivative from kal\u00e1, and the idea obtained will therefore be, that of some moving principle, or local predisposition, following a course in the human body in relation to the course of the moon in her increase and decrease.\n\nIn the examination of the calendar of the kal\u00e1na, many discrepancies occur in the various versions received by me. I propose to add translations of the two published versions, as they are probably more generally accepted on account of their publication. The principal discrepancies in the various accounts are in the fourth kal\u00e1na, described as \"the calf\" or \"the knee-cap\"; the eleventh described as \"the lip,\" \"the lower lip,\" \"the cheek.\" This second discrepancy may spring from the general application of the term tola \u0924\u094b\u0932\u093e to the region of the fore-teeth, the lips, cheek, and chin.\n\nBut besides these discrepancies in details, I found that my original information, distinguishing the Mul-kal\u00e1na, \u092e\u0942\u0932\u0915\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e from the Amrita-kal\u00e1na, \u0905\u092e\u0943\u0924\u0915\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e (erroneously called Mruta-kal\u00e1na, \u092e\u0943\u0924\u0915\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e) was altogether wrong. It appears that in Sinhalese popular medical works the Amrita-kal\u00e1na means literally 'the ambrosial' or 'good' kal\u00e1na. The\nVisa-kal\u00e1wa, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0ddd, I would translate as 'the baneful (literally, 'poisonous') kal\u00e1wa.' It will be seen in the Table taken from the Lakrivikirana Sheet Almanac that the Visa-kal\u00e1wa is said to ascend on the left side in males, and on the right in females. This Table and that from the Lita or Ephemeris for the year give both the Visa-kal\u00e1wa and Amrita-kal\u00e1wa, which I have not obtained from other sources. There can be no doubt that the Mul-kal\u00e1wa, commonly spoken of, is the same as the Amrita-kal\u00e1wa. The Sinhalese Lita (page 50) advises that if the Amrita-kal\u00e1wa locates itself in any part of the body, care should be taken of it, as \"life\" then chiefly exists in it. In the case of Visa-kal\u00e1wa it is asserted that any wound or hurt to the part where it is located will bring calamity or death. The distinction of effect is not very clear, except that a hurt in the latter case appears to be considered as more directly baneful. The only explanations remaining to be made are: first, that when the kal\u00e1wa is in the arm-pit or shoulder, the whole arm and hand are involved; and secondly, that the Amrita-kal\u00e1wa moves at a certain distance from the Visa-kal\u00e1wa.\n**KALAWA TABLES.**\n\nThe Kalawa Table appearing in the Sheet Almanae of the Lakrivikirana is as follows:\n\n**Ascending Visa-kalawa.**\n\n| No. |

THEIR\nSONGS AND CHARMS.\n\nBy Louis De Zoysa, Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n(Read July 6th, 1881.)\n\nIn submitting the following Note to the Society, it is not my intention to enter upon the vexed question of the origin of the Vedd\u00e1s, but simply to call attention to an important passage in the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so relating thereto, the true meaning of which has been long hidden from the readers of that work by an erroneous rendering in Mr. Turnour\u2019s translation.\n\nThe 6th chapter of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so gives an account of the arrival of Vijayo, the first monarch of the Sinhalese dynasty, B.C. 543. The 7th chapter relates his encounter with an aboriginal Princess named Kuw\u00e9ni, how he married her, and how he conquered the Island by her means.\n\nWhen she had borne him two children, a son named Jivahatto and a daughter named Dis\u00e1la, the King wished to divorce her and marry a Princess from Southern Madura. For this purpose he sent ambassadors to King P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davo of Madura, soliciting his daughter in marriage, and duly obtained his consent. On the arrival of the Princess from India, Vijayo \u201cthus explained himself to Kuw\u00e9ni: \u2018A daughter of royalty is a timid being; on that account, leaving the children with me, depart from my house.\u2019 She replied: \u2018On my account, having murdered Yakkhos, I dread these Yakkhos; now I am discarded.\u201d\n\nIt is due to Mr. De Zoysa to record that he had no opportunity of perusing the Papers on the Vedd\u00e1s\u2014only very recently received from England\u2014of Messrs. J. Bailey (Trans. Ethnological Soc., Vol. II. n.s., Art. xxvi., 1863), and B. F. Hartshorne (Fortnightly Review, Art v, March, 1876), prior to writing the \u201cNote\u201d now printed. Mr. De Zoysa\u2019s Paper has been delayed, whilst in the press, to enable the Honorary Secretary to add (necessarily as Notes) some extracts bearing thereon.\nby both parties, whither can I betake myself?' 'Within my dominions,' said he, 'to any place thou pleasest, which is unconnected with Yakkhos; and I will maintain thee with a thousand bali offerings.' She who had been thus interdicted (from re-uniting herself with the Yakkhos) with clamorous lamentation, taking her children with her, in the character of an inhuman being, wandered to that very city (La\u0144k\u00e1pura) of inhuman inhabitants. She left her children outside the Yakkha city. A Yakkho who detested her, recognising her in her search for a dwelling, went up to her. Thereupon another fierce Yakkho, among the enraged Yakkhos, asked: 'Is it for the purpose of again and again spying out the peace we enjoy that she is come?' In his fury he killed the Yakkhini with a blow of his open hand. Her uncle (a Yakkho named Kum\u00e1ro) happening to proceed out of the Yakkha city, seeing these children outside the town\u2014'Whose children are ye?' said he. Being informed 'Kuw\u00e9ni's,' he said: 'Your mother is murdered: if ye should be seen here, they would murder you also\u2014fly quickly.' Instantly departing thence, they repaired to the (neighbourhood of the) Sumanta mountain. The elder having grown up, married his sister, and settled there. Becoming numerous by their sons and daughters, under the protection of the King they resided in that Malay\u00e1 district. This person (J\u00edwahatto) retained the attributes of the Yakkhos.\"*\n\nNow, I submit that the rendering of the words \"\u090f\u0938\u094b \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092f \u0939\u093f \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u094b\" [Eso pulind\u00e1nay hi sambhavo] by \"this person (J\u00edwahatto) retained the attributes of the Yakkhos,\" is erroneous, and that the words should be rendered \"This is the origin of the Pulinda\"\u2014i.e., the Vedd\u00e1s.\u00b9\n\n* Turnour's \"Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so,\" Vol. I., p. 52: Cotta, 1837. Followed by Forbes' \"Eleven Years in Ceylon,\" Vol. II., p. 81; Pridham's \"Ceylon, &c.,\" Vol. I., p. 27; and Tennent's \"Ceylon,\" Vol. I., p. 371.\u2014Hon. Sec.\n\n\u00b9 This interpretation is based on the context and the historical references provided at the end of the text.\nIn the first place, the word \"\u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e\" [Pulind\u00e1] which Mr. Turnour renders by \"Yakkhos\" (who are supposed to be supernatural beings), is never applied to Yakkhos, but means Vedd\u00e1s. The following is the meaning given by Professor H. H. Wilson in his Dictionary of the Sanskrit language, p. 545: \"S. V. Pulinda, a barbarian; a ml\u00e9chch'ha; a savage or mountaineer; one who uses an uncultivated and unintelligible dialect, &c.\"2 The Sinhalese vocabulary, the N\u00e1m\u00e1valiya, gives \"Pulindu\" as one of the synonyms for Vedd\u00e1s,\n\n\u0935\u0947\u0926\u093f \u092e\u0932, \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941, \u0935\u0928\u0938\u0930\u093e (\u0928\u092e \u0935\u0947\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0902\u0924\u0903).*\n\n[Vedi, mal, pulindu, vanasara (nam veddanta).]\n\nStrangely, this word does not occur in the P\u00e1li language. It is not found in the Abhidh\u00e1nappadipik\u00e1, the only authorized vocabulary of the P\u00e1li language, nor in Childers' P\u00e1li Dictionary, nor in any other P\u00e1li work I have seen. But this need not excite much surprise, as Sanskrit words, not found in the P\u00e1li vocabulary, are sometimes found in P\u00e1li writings; e.g., in this very chapter of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so the word \"\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0902\u0917\u093e\" [surung\u00e1], which is pure Sanskrit and not found in the P\u00e1li vocabulary, is used for a \"subterraneous abode.\"\n\nIn the second place, \"\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u094b\" [sambhavo], which Mr. Turnour translates \"attributes,\" means, according to Childers' P\u00e1li Dictionary (p. 431), \"production, birth, origin, cause, union, &c., &c.\"\n\nThe demonstrative adjective \"\u0925\u094b\" [\u00e9so] (nom. sing. m.) Mr. Turnour refers to Jivahatto understood, but the more\n\n* Alwis' Nam\u00e1valiya, p. 59, v. 225. Colombo, 1858.

Sec.\nnatural construction, I think, is to connect it with the noun *sambhavo* (nom. sing. m.) \"origin.\"\n\nI discovered this erroneous rendering many years ago, but for obvious reasons I have refrained from calling public attention to it. The truth is, I was extremely reluctant to do so from fear that I might unwittingly lead others to think that Turnour's translation of the Mah\u00e1wanso is generally incorrect. Such is not my opinion. The few mistakes found in this great work are mere \"spots on the sun,\" and I do not think there is a better translation of a historical work in the East. It is not too much to say that this \"gifted Englishman\" has, by his writings and researches, undoubtedly done more for the development of the *historical* literature of India and Ceylon than all his predecessors and successors, both European and native.\n\nMy belief is, that Mr. Turnour's Kandyan Pandits, not knowing the meaning of this unusual word \"*Pulinda*\" which, as I stated above, is not found in the P\u00e1li vocabulary, erroneously interpreted it to mean \"Yakkho\" instead of \"Vedd\u00e1.\"\n\nI may here add that I have had the satisfaction of discovering that my reading is confirmed by the Commentary on the Mah\u00e1wanso, which has the following gloss on the passage in question:\n\n\"*Pulind\u00e1na\u1e47 hi sambhavoti.* Etthahik\u00e1ro k\u00e1ra\u1e47atthe. Yasm\u00e1 te Pulind\u00e1na\u1e47 \u00e1di pur\u00eds\u00e1 hutv\u00e1 tattha vasi\u1e47su. Tasm\u00e1 ettha Pulind\u00e1na\u1e47 eso sambhavo \u00e1yuppatt\u00edti vi\u00f1\u00f1eeyyo ahos\u00ed ti attho.\"\n\n\"'Pulindana\u1e47 hi sambhavoti.'\u2014Here the letter 'hi' signifies 'cause' or 'reason.' On what account did they, becoming the progenitors (*\u00e1di pur\u00eds\u00e1*) of the *Pulind\u00e1*, reside here (Malaya Division), on that account it should be known that this is the origin, first existence, of the *Pulind\u00e1*.\"\nIt will be seen from the above exegesis that they (Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children, J\u00edwahatto and Dis\u00e1la) are spoken of by the commentator as \u201cthe progenitors\u201d [A\u2019di pur\u00eds\u00e1], of the Pulind\u00e1s (Vedd\u00e1s).\n\nI am, moreover, in a position to add that the tradition that the Vedd\u00e1s are the descendants of Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children by Vijayo, is still current in some parts of the Kandyan country. In 1879, when I visited the Ratnapura and U\u2019va Districts to inspect Temple Libraries, I made it a point to collect information about the Vedd\u00e1s, whenever an opportunity occurred. When at Pelmadulla Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, I enquired from the incumbent, Induruw\u00e9 Piyadassi Unn\u00e1ns\u00e9, whether he knew anything about the origin of the Vedd\u00e1s, and, to my surprise, he said at once that the tradition is that they are descendants of Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children by Vijayo. On my enquiry, whether he had read the passage in the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so which forms the subject of this note, he replied he had never seen it, but that his information was derived from a Sinhalese work on the Vedd\u00e1s, which he had seen long ago in the possession of a native.

Fields, villages, and families yet retain the name of Vedd\u00e1s, as *Vedi-pa\u1e45gu*, *Vedde-kumbura*, *Vedde-watta*, *Vedde-ela*, *Veddegala*, *Vedde-g\u00e9*, &c., in the district of Saffragam, which is the country at the foot of Adam's Peak, and in the Rayigam K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\"\nIndeed, Saffragam or Habaragamuwa means 'the district of Vedd\u00e1s' or 'barbarous people'; and in this form of the word the former existence of Vedd\u00e1s can again be traced as Habara-goda, Habara-kaduwa, &c. It is traditional throughout Saffragam that once Vedd\u00e1s predominated over Sinhalese in that district, and that, as the latter gained ground, the former withdrew towards Bintenna and Wellassa. But Mr. Macready, of the Civil Service, has given me very important proof of the existence of Vedd\u00e1s near the Samanta mountains. He has given me the translation of some stanzas from a Sinhalese poem, written about 400 years ago, called the Paravisand\u00e9saya, or 'the Dove's message,'* The poem treats of a message sent, by means of a dove, from K\u00f3tt\u00e9 (near Colombo) to Vishnu at Dondra, at the extreme south of the Island. The dove takes its course exactly over the districts lying below Adam's Peak. The poet addresses the dove, and tells her she will see [at Potupitiya] 'the daughters of the Vedd\u00e1s' clothed in ri\u1e6di\u2020 bark, their hair adorned with peacock's plumes. So wild are they that the poet describes the herds of deer as being startled at the sight of them.\"\u2014J.

They are repeated by rote; they do not pause to understand them, and could not if they would. It is enough for them, as for most Oriental people, that a particular formula is to serve a particular purpose. These [charms] are identical; yet the Vedd\u00e1s and the Sinhalese certainly do not associate so closely as to borrow one another's charms. Have they descended in each race since the time they were one? The term ohm\u00e1 I can get no satisfactory explanation of. It is not Sinhalese certainly. I assume it means 'wild boar,' as this is the charm to arrest a boar in the path; but it is not the term used by the Vedd\u00e1s for a boar in ordinary conversation. The allusion to the Pas\u00e9, or Pach\u00e9, Buddha, is curious as occurring in both; the one people being anything but Buddhists, while Buddhism is the religion of the others. As Gautama Buddha visited Ceylon long anterior to the final establishment of Buddhism in Ceylon, and descended in Bintenna, may not this solitary allusion to the religion have been handed down in this form among the Vedd\u00e1s from a period even before the invasion by Vijayo? In the form of a charm which is repeated by rote, such an allusion would be most naturally retained.\"\nSo far as having any Buddhist tendencies, they do not even show the slightest outward respect in the presence of a Buddhist priest. The other Vedd\u00e1 charms are, I believe, quite unlike those of the Sinhalese.\u201d\u2014Hon. Sec.]\n\nNo. 9.\n\nI have found this mantra or charm in a collection of Vedd\u00e1 songs and charms I procured at Badulla. The use in it, however, of a Hind\u00fa-religious term, and the corrupted form of a Buddhist metaphysical term, may raise a doubt whether this charm be a genuine Vedd\u00e1 production or not.\n\nThe Hind\u00fa term alluded to is O'm nam\u00f3!\u2014\u2018Salutation to the triune deity!\u2019 The following is the explanation given of this term by Wilson in his Sanskrit Dictionary:\n\n\u2018O'm.\u2014The mystic name of the deity, prefacing all the prayers and most of the writings of the Hindus: A., a name of Vishnu, U., of \u015aiva, and M. of Br\u0101hma. It therefore implies the Indian triad, and expresses the three in one.\u2019 The Buddhist term is \u091a\u094d\u091b\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0915\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0947 [chhandachkande], which is a corruption of the Sinhalese word \u092a\u093e\u0902\u091a\u0915\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0947 [pandaskande], which again is corrupted from the Sanskrit or Sinhalese word \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0915\u0923\u094d\u0921 [pa\u00f1chakandha], \u2018the five constituent parts of the human body.\u2019 These terms may have been interpolated by the village Vedd\u00e1s, or more probably by their neighbours, the Kandyan Sinhalese, but the contents of the charm are peculiarly Vedic\u2014if I may use the term\u2014and the interesting information it gives of the seats or localities of the various Vedd\u00e1 demons or chieftains throughout the Island is unique, and is not now procurable from any other source.\n\nThe mantra also seems to afford information which may possibly enable us to settle a long-disputed point in the early history of Ceylon, namely, as to whence the aborigines (Yakkhos or demons of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so, who are doubtless the ancestors of the Vedd\u00e1s) came to Ceylon.\n\nIt will be seen that the Vedd\u00e1 demons are called here \u0915\u0921\u0935\u0930\u093e \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093f \u091a\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0935\u093e [Ka\u1e0davara Vedi ch\u00e9n\u0101va]. I cannot find the meaning of the word Ka\u1e0davara, but the expression shows that they are identical\nwith the Vedd\u00e1s (Vedd\u00f3). It is well known that there is a tribe of demons called Ka\u1e0davara Yakku, \"Ka\u1e0davara demons,\" to whom offerings are made in some parts of the Kandyan country. If the songs and prayers (y\u00e1dini or kannalav), used by the Ka\u1e0davara devil-dancers, are examined (which I have no means of doing at present), I have no doubt they will throw light on the early history of the Yakkhos, or Vedd\u00e1s, and probably lead to very important ethnological results. Again, \"nine millions, nine millions\" (a vast number) of these Ka\u1e0davara or Vedi demons are said to reside in a \"far distant land beyond the seas,\" in a country called Mallava d\u00e9sa, possibly a corruption of Malaya d\u00e9sa, the 'hilly country.'\n\nDoes not this show that the Vedd\u00e1s of Ceylon have a faint tradition that their fatherland is the \"hill country\" of India?\n\nI may here mention a curious legend related in the R\u00e1j\u00e1vali and Kuv\u00e9ni Asna (a little work on the history of Kuv\u00e9ni, in Sinhalese blank verse), which seems to have some connection with the history of the Vedd\u00e1s. Pa\u1e47\u1e0duvasa (B. C. 504), nephew of Vijayo, and third in succession to him, became ill with a combination of diseases, \"cough, asthma, fever, burning, rheumatism, &c.,\" the result of perjury committed by his uncle, Vijayo, who swore that he would not renounce Kuv\u00e9ni, the aboriginal Princess whom he first married, but afterwards violated his oath, by repudiating her and marrying a princess from Southern India. When the King was afflicted with this disease, Sakra, King of the gods, (Indra of the Hind\u00fa mythology) ordered the R\u00e1hu, the Asura (the ascending node) to assume the form of a wild boar, in size like a huge mountain, and devastate the pleasure garden of the King of Malaya (the hill-country in India), who was versed in all the arts of necromancy. When King Malaya saw the destruction of his pleasure garden, he pursued the boar with bow and arrow, accompanied by his three brothers and a retinue of archers or Vedd\u00e1s, through the continent of India. The boar crossed over the sea near Tuticorin and made the circuit of the Island, followed by the King, and when it reached the vicinity of Anur\u00e1dhapura, the boar was turned into a mountain! The King of gods then appeared to Malaya R\u00e1j\u00e1, and conducting him to King\nP\u0101\u1e47\u1e0duvas, got him to perform certain demon ceremonies, and restored the king to his wonted health.\u2014L. De Z.\n\n[Since writing the above I have seen some of the songs used by the Ka\u1e0davara devil dancers, which not only confirm the identity of the Ka\u1e0davara demons and the Vedd\u00e1s, but also in a remarkable manner strengthen the opinion I have ventured to express, that the legend of the Malaya Raja is connected with the history of the Vedd\u00e1s. It is stated in these songs that Malaya R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his visit to Ceylon was accompanied by 2,000 Vedd\u00e1s, and when he performed the devil ceremonies for the King, 36 Vedd\u00e1s stood around him assisting at the ceremonies.\u2014L. De Z.]\n\n\"The result of the most patient enquiry is, that the Vedd\u00e1s have a vague belief in a host of undefined spirits, whose influence is rather for good than for evil. Still, vague as this belief is, not even the wildest Vedd\u00e1s are without 'an instinct of worship.' They believe that the air is peopled by spirits, that every rock and every tree, every forest and every hill\u2014in short, every feature of nature\u2014has its genius loci, but these seem little else than mere nameless phantoms, whom they regard rather with mysterious awe than actual dread. But besides this vague spirit-worship, they have a more definite superstition, in which there is more of system. This is the belief in the guardianship of the spirits of the dead. Every near relative becomes a spirit after death, who watches over the welfare of those who are left behind. These, which include their ancestors and their children, they term their n\u00e9hiya yakun, 'kindred spirits.' They describe them as 'ever watchful, coming to them in sickness, visiting them in dreams, giving them flesh when hunting.' In short, in every calamity, in every want, they call on them for aid, and it is curious that the shades of their departed children, bilindu yakun, or 'infant spirits,' as they call them, are those which they appear most frequently to invoke.\n\n\"It is a pretty belief, and contrasts favourably with the superstitions of the Kandyans, who have spirits enough in their system, but almost all thoroughly malignant, and needing constant propitiation. But the Vedd\u00e1 spirit-world is singularly free from evil. I can find only one absolutely malignant spirit in it, whom they really fear, though,\nlike all savages, they have an undefined awe of the nameless spirits whom they believe to haunt the darkness. The shades of their ancestors and of their children seem to be purely benevolent. The ceremonies with which they invoke them are few as they are simple. The most common is the following. An arrow is fixed upright in the ground, and the Vedd\u00e1 dances slowly round it, chanting this invocation, which is almost musical in its rhythm:\n\n\"M\u00e1 miya m\u00e1 miya m\u00e1 d\u00e9y\u00e1\nTopang koyih\u00ebti mit\u00ecgan yanda.\"\n\n\"My departed one, my departed one, my God!\nWhere art thou wandering?\"\n\n\"The spirit of the dead is here simply called upon, without even the object for which it is invoked being mentioned. And this invocation appears to be used on all occasions when the intervention of the guardian spirits is required,\u2014in sickness, preparatory to hunting, &c.\n\n\"Sometimes, in the latter case, a portion of the flesh of the game is promised as a votive offering in the event of the chase being successful, and they believe that the spirits will appear to them in dreams, and tell them where to hunt.\n\n\"Sometimes they cook food and place it in the dry bed of a river, or some other secluded spot, and then call on their deceased ancestors by name: 'Come, and partake of this! Give us maintenance as you did when living! Come, wheresoever you may be; on a tree, on a rock, in the forest, come!' And they dance round the food, half chanting, half shouting, the invocation..........\n\n\"They have no system of medicine, though they will accept medicine when given. In cases of sickness, they sprinkle water on the patient, invoking their deceased ancestors to heal him. Sometimes they simply utter the names of spirits as they dance round the sick man. Sometimes a garland of flowers is offered to the spirit who has afflicted him.\n\n\"They invoke the Gal-yak\u00e1, 'spirit of the rock'; Vedi-yak\u00e1, 'spirit of the chase'; Unap\u00e1na-yak\u00e1, of whom I have no knowledge;\"\nand the shade of their grandmother. They also propitiate Mah\u00e1-yakin\u00ed, who appears rather an evil personage. It is to her that they offer a garland of flowers. They describe her as a 'foreigner' and say that they know nothing about her, but acquired their awe of her from the Sinhalese.\n\n\"The Vedi-yak\u00e1 is known to the Sinhalese; hunters offer flowers, blood, and burnt meat to this spirit, before hunting, to secure their success. Unap\u00e1na-yak\u00e1 is known to the Sinhalese of the Vedira\u1e6da, but I do not think he is generally known to the Sinhalese.\n\n\"They believe in the efficacy of what are called devil-dancers, but are ignorant of the art of a Katt\u00e1diya, or devil-dancer.\"\u2014J. B.\nA H\u00daNIYAM IMAGE.\n\nBy L. NELL, Esq.\n\n(Read July 6th, 1881.)\n\nLong residence amongst the native Sinhalese and careful observation of their superstitious practices and expressions of superstitious ideas lead to the conclusion that, amongst the lower castes, who have also hitherto been the most ignorant, Buddhism has not existed as a religion. The tom-tom beaters, the toddy-drawers, the jaggery-makers, have only lately attempted to build Buddhist temples of their own. The Amarapura sect of Buddhists is a modern importation to satisfy the social ambition of the Mahabadd\u00e9 people, candidates of whose community for priestly ordination would have been refused by the previously existing Siamese sect. The latter, though heterodox in this exclusiveness, had confined the right of ordination to pupils drawn from the Goyigama caste.\n\nThe liberal and orthodox principle of the Amarapura sect extended in time from the Mahabadd\u00e9 and Karaw\u00e9 to lower castes. As an instance, the jaggery people (Vahumpura) near Galle have built a temple, and their pupil-priests in yellow robes and with begging-bowls in their hands are now seen obtaining the food of mendicants from the hands of their own friends. The profound meditative air of the young mendicants, and the evident pride with which their friends give alms and honor the new priesthood are very striking. This is quite a reform, and Buddhism, perhaps for the first time, is subverting what other missions have not hitherto observed as a likely field of conversion. Before this reform the priests of the very low castes have been the Yakadur\u00e1s, commonly called Katt\u00e1diy\u00e1s, belonging to the tom-tom beater and Oliya castes. Kapur\u00e1las belong to all castes, and Pattinis also belong to all castes.\nThese remarks apply to the practice of Kapur\u00e1las. The priests undergo a training\u2014which, if they have a good memory, is of not long duration\u2014namely, the committing to memory of certain charms, invocations, and songs to be accompanied on the tom-tom, drum, and by violent dances. One must live in the neighbourhood of these devil-worshippers to appreciate the form of nuisance known as a 'devil-ceremony.' The tom-tom is beaten violently to accompany the discordant song, and the noises are very violent during the intervals of dancing. The family having the ceremony keep it up from sunset till past dawn the next morning. If any remonstrance is used with respect to such practices, they will excuse themselves on the ground that it is their \"religion\" or \"faith.\" But the Yakadur\u00e1s are in no way respected for being priests, and their remuneration is very little.\n\nBesides the performance of these devil-dances the Yakadur\u00e1s practise H\u00faniyam charms,* by which harm\u2014such as disease\u2014is inflicted on one's fellow-creatures. To counteract H\u00faniyam charms counter-charms\u2020 are muttered over a cup of oil or a thread, and three limes are cut with an arecanut-cutter whilst charms are muttered.\u00a7 The failure of such counter-charms strengthens the belief in the potency of the H\u00faniyam. In most of these H\u00faniyam charms a small image, made of wax or wood or drawn on a leaf, is necessary. Nails made of five metals\u00a7 (usually gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead) are driven\n\n* \"Kodivina [\u0d9a\u0ddc\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dab] or H\u00faniyam [\u0dc4\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db8] is the name given to evils of whatever kind inflicted by the agency of charms......There are said to be 84,000 [H\u00faniyam charms] of every degree of malignity, most of which more or less contribute to bring to an untimely death the person affected by this influence, though that event may be deferred for many years.

T. Shams-ud-Di'n.\n\n(Read October 6th, 1881.)\n\nThis feast is annually held in Colombo at the Marad\u00e1na Mosque during Jam\u00e1d-ul-\u00e1khir, the sixth month of the Muhammadan year, in memory of the saint M\u00edr\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, whose miracles are well known to the Muhammadans, and whom they esteem as a great Wali.* His sepulchre is at N\u00e1g\u00far, near N\u00e1gapatam.\n\nThe festival\u2020 commences on the evening the new moon becomes visible in the month of Jam\u00e1d-ul-\u00e1khir, and lasts till the tenth of the lunar month. Five or six days previous to the new moon they erect a flag-staff, and in the evening of the new moon day the sacred banners are conveyed in solemn procession, attended by a ceremonious display of music, artificial trees, &c. After having perambulated the town in great pomp and state, the procession returns to the place where the flag-staff is erected. There the F\u00e1thihah or opening chapter of the Kur\u00e1n is recited in the name of the saint, and the sacred flag is hoisted.\n\nIn other parts of the Muhammadan world also, as at N\u00e1g\u00far, those Musalm\u00e1ns who venerate this saint set up a flagstaff and annually repeat the F\u00e1thihah in his name. On the night of the 10th a great feast is held on account of its being the day that the saint departed this life. The Mosque is illuminated and all kinds of sports take place, which attract crowds of people\n\n* \"The favourite of heaven.\"\n\n\u2020 Regarding these annual festivals (M\u00f3lids) held in commemoration of the birth of Muslim Saints, see Lane's Arabian Nights, Vol., I., Chap. iii., Note 63, p. 216.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nto the spot. In short, the whole town is awake that night, and presents a scene of bustle and confusion. The slow murmur of human voices rising at times like the waves of the ocean, and mingling with the clear voices of the ubiquitous sherbert vendor and roasted gram seller\u2014the invariable concomitants of a Ceylon crowd\u2014renders the scene perfectly picturesque. Moreover a k\u016bdu is constructed in honour of this saint. This is a frame-work of bamboo, in the shape of a pagoda, made with a sort of network of paper nicely clipped and pasted on it. It is further ornamented with different kinds of coloured paper, formed into various devices, tinsel fringes, &c. When the whole is lighted up within and without, it has a beautiful appearance.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n ship captains and sailors are in the habit of making vows and oblations in the name of this saint; e.g., when they meet with any misfortune at sea, they vow that should the vessel reach the desired haven in peace, safely with their property and cargo, they will spend a certain sum of money in offering F\u0101thihah to him.*\n\nThere is a tradition in general reception among the Moors, that in former times the inhabitants of the M\u00e1ldives were tormented by a demon, to whom they were compelled to sacrifice a female every year; but this saint, a descendant of the prophet, having arrived in the Island, attacked and overcame the demon, and that in return for this service the whole of the inhabitants\n\n* \"Before a voyage is undertaken, an offering is made to some saint for success, and in danger or distress the mariners trust chiefly in the efficacy of vows or offerings to the tombs of some personage (dead or living) eminent for piety. We are informed of large sums given as votive offerings made during boisterous weather to an old priest resident at Calcutta. All moneys paid at M\u00e1l\u00e9 in fulfilment of such vows go to the priest.\" (Christopher and Young, Memoir on the M\u00e1ldivian Islanders, Trans. Bombay Geo. Soc, 1836-8, p. 75.)\u2014Hon.

The miracles performed by this saint were innumerable.\n\nNOTE.\n\n[According to a Tamil version of an Arabic biography of this saint,* M\u00edr\u00e1 S\u00e1hib was born at \u201cM\u00e1\u1e47ikkapuri\u201d on the 9th Jam\u00e1d-ul-\u00e1khir, A. H. 910 (A. D. 1504), and died on the 10th of the same month, A. H. 978 (A. D. 1570). He is known to his votaries under several names, e.g., Hazrat M\u00edr\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, Shaikh \u2019Abd-ul-K\u00e1dir, S\u00e1ul Ham\u00edd, &c.\n\nAmong the miraculous adventures attributed to the Shaikh is included a visit to the M\u00e1ldives, where, after thwarting the treachery of the King and his subjects, he was enabled to win them over to Isl\u00e1m by ridding the Islands of a dreaded Jinni.]\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the account of this conversion, though sufficiently quaint to warrant its insertion here in extenso, is manifestly nothing more than the plain unvarnished legend related by the Arab traveller Ibn Bat\u00fata, as then (circa A. D. 1344) current among the Islanders\u2021 popularised and assimilated to the familiar Arabian Nights\u2019 Tale of the Fisherman, the \u2019Ifrit, and the bottle of brass.\n\n*Kalarattu Mir\u0101\u1e47 S\u0101hipu A\u2019ndavaravarkal k\u0101ra\u1e47a-sarittiram, K\u0101raikk\u00e1l, A.

Perceiving that the sea was boisterous and having a mind to visit M\u00e1l\u0111ive Island, (the Shaikh,) after meditating upon God and performing the prayers of two raka't,* looked at Hazrat Y\u00fasuf S\u00e1h\u00edb and the others, and said: \"Shut ye your eyes, and placing your feet in the salt sea follow me.\" The S\u00e1h\u00edb\u2014exclaiming 'In the name of God!'\u2020\u2014first set his lotus-like feet in the water and walked, the others following him. Before the twinkling of an eye the Shaikh with his holy\u2021 mouth commanded the devotees to open their eyes. When they looked and saw that they were on the shore of M\u00e1l\u0111ive Island they rejoiced exceedingly. But the Ruler of that country and the other infidels,\u00a7 seeing Hazrat S\u00e1h\u00edb come with a company, spoke one with another: \"They are come to make war on our land\"; and, intending to kill them by stratagem, introduced deadly poisons into fruits and other eatables. Taking these, the King and the rest of the inhabitants approached Hazrat S\u00e1h\u00edb with great respect, as though they had come to welcome them, and set before them the poisoned viands they had brought. But the S\u00e1h\u00edb\u2014although cognizant (of their treachery)\u2014feigning ignorance, saying 'In the name of God!' and laying his holy hands on the food, ate it, and handing to the others they too ate and rejoiced.

Some hold that the Devils (Shaij\u00e1ns) are distinct from Angels and Jinn. The species of Jinn (said to have been created some thousand years before Adam) consists, according to tradition, of five orders:\u20141. Jann; 2. Jinn; 3. Shait\u00e1n; 4. 'Ifrit; 5. M\u00e1r\u00edd\u2014the most powerful. There are good and evil Genii. If good, they are exceedingly handsome: if evil, horribly hideous. At pleasure they become invisible, or disappear in earth or air; and appear to mankind commonly in the shapes of serpents, dogs, cats, or giants. Their chief abode is said to be in the mountains of K\u00e1f, which encircle the earth.

This custom has obtained from the time of our ancestors. We therefore give our maidens by turns. As it is now this girl\u2019s turn, we have come here and are preparing to take her away.\u201d Hazrat, looking on the infidels, forbade them, saying, \u201cDo not this wicked act, but marry ye the maid to a young man,\u201d and went away.\n\nBut those infidels disregarded the righteous words of the S\u00e1hib, being quite ignorant of his previous miraculous acts. According to their wont they adorned the girl, bound her tightly, and having placed her in a palanquin paraded her through the country with music and lighted torches\u2020; finally, leaving her in the temple which is outside the town, they departed to their respective houses.\n\nHazrat M\u00edr\u00e1n S\u00e1hib, aware of these circumstances by divine intuition, meditating on the wonderful God, in the dread night took a goglet joyfully in his hand, and walked alone to the place where the girl was kept.\u2021 At that juncture the Jinn\u00ed approached with fearful noise, coming to gaze on the maid. M\u00edr\u00e1n Ham\u00edd seeing him said, \u201cO Shait\u00e1n, be patient; approach not the girl.\u201d Hearing those words the Jinn\u00ed, alarmed, confused in mind, trembling, with face distorted, made obeisance at the lotus feet of the S\u00e1hib.\u00a7 Hazrat looking on the Jinn\u00ed said \u201cTake this goglet, O Accursed,\u2016 and fetch water from the tank which is opposite.\u201d The Jinn\u00ed, at once assuming human shape, took\n\n* \u201cThere appeared to them every month an evil spirit, who came from the sea, resembling a ship filled with lamps.\u201d (Gray, J.

But when he dipped the goglet to draw water, all the water of the tank flowed into it. Perceiving this the Jinn\u00ed was filled with wonder, because the goglet did not come with his hand nor yield in the least though he lifted it with all his might. While the Jinn\u00ed was standing with diminished strength without releasing his hold on the goglet, the Islanders, taking their waterpots as usual and going to the tank to draw water at the third watch, seeing the tank dry and the Jinn\u00ed in human form standing tugging at the goglet, stood terrified. Because the goglet did not yield, although he tried his utmost to lift it, the Jinn\u00ed returned to the holy presence of Hazrat and informed him of what had happened. \"Go, Shait\u00e1n,\" said the Shaikh, \"and say our (Muslim) 'Bismill\u00e1h' ('In the name of God!'), and the water in the goglet will run out; again say 'Bismill\u00e1h,' draw water and come.\" The Jinn\u00ed went, did as directed, and bringing water placed it before Hazrat, who took it and made his ablutions.* The Jinn\u00ed, in his foolishness thinking 'I will enter the goglet and see the wonder inside,' as soon as the S\u00e1hib had finished, said \"Master, be pleased to allow me to enter this goglet.\" As Hazrat said \"Well, enter,\" the Jinn\u00ed contracted his body and crept into the goglet.\u2020 Whilst the Shaikh, having clapped on the stopper, was performing his prayers \u2021 those Islanders, as usual, brought the requisites for taking away the corpse. But when they saw the girl alive, as left the night before, they were astonished, approached her and asked what had occurred. Having heard her relate\n\n* \u1e6d\u016bl [olu]: Arabic wuzu, \"the ablution of face, hands, feet, &c., necessary before every time of prayer.\" (See Hughes' Notes on Muhammadanism, p. 105.)\n\n\u2020 \u1e0d\u0101d\u0101r [k\u00fas\u00e1], an earthen water-bottle; whereas the one which contained the 'Ifrit in the \"Story of the Fisherman\" (Arabian Nights) was of brass (kumkum.)\n\n\u2021 \u1e63\u016bl\u016bk [s\u00fapuku], the Muslim morning prayer. \"Glorify God when it is evening (masa) and at morning (subh)\u2014and to him be praise in the heavens and in the earth\u2014and at afternoon ('ashi) and at noontide (zuhr).\" \u2014S\u00farat-ur-Rum (xxx), 17.\nthe events of the night, the Islanders asked, \"Where is the Jinn\u00ed?\" She replied, \"He is shut up in the goglet which is in the presence of the deliverer,\" pointing to Hazrat. The Islanders, rejoicing exceedingly, with gladdened minds untied the bonds of the girl, and taking her with them worshipped the golden feet of the bountiful benefactor who abounded in the favour of the wonderful God; then very hastily went and narrated the circumstances to the King of the Island. He, rejoicing when he heard, surrounded by his ministers, other chief men, astrologers, and merchants, came quickly on foot, and seeing the Shaikh, worshipped him, saying \"O lord who hast removed the danger that threatened us, be pleased to save us: we are come under thy protection: we will without fail perform whatever thou commandest.\" Hazrat M\u00edr\u00e1n S\u00e1hib, having fed that King and all his subjects with the divine ambrosia called Kalimah, caused them to come into the right way,* and, having broken down all the temples in the Island, built mosques. Looking at that King he said, \"Do thou reign alone and be a help to thy subjects\"; (then) blessed them, and abode (there) a few days.\u2020 The King and the other inhabitants, however, came to the S\u00e1hib and said \"O lord, the fear of the harm he will work in the future distresses our minds, should we keep our enemy the Jinn\u00ed here thus; we will do whatever thou biddest us.\" Hazrat replied, \"Load the goglet in which the Jinn\u00ed is enclosed in a gundara,\u2021 and having taken and sunk it (in the sea) beyond Galle,\u00a7 return.\" But those people said\n\n* \"When any one is converted to Isl\u00e1m he is required to repeat the Kalimah, or Creed:\u2014L\u00e1-il\u00e1h\u00e1-il-lal-laho Muhammad-ur-Ras\u00fal-Ullah.

C. P. B., Hon. Sec.]\nSERICULTURE IN CEYLON.\n\nBy J. L. Vanderstraaten, M.D.\n\n(Read October 6th, 1881.)\n\nSericulture, or, the raising of silk-worms, is derived from Seres, 'Chinese,' and cultura, 'culture,' because \"silk\" came from the Chinese word Se, which signifies 'silk.' The name, therefore, of the great Empire of China derives its name from the great silk industry. The discovery of the uses to which the cocoon of the silk-worm might be applied appears to have been first made in China by an Empress, who was the first to unravel the filmy thread, and to work it into a web of cloth, about 2,700 years before the Christian era.\n\nIn the middle of the 6th century, the Western world received the great boon of a supply of silk-worms' eggs. These were secretly conveyed from Semida, between Tartary and China, to Constantinople, by two Persian monks, who concealed the eggs in a hollow cane. At the proper season they were hatched, and the caterpillars were fed with the leaves of the wild mulberry tree. From this small commencement the myriads of silk worms have sprung, which, throughout Europe and Western Asia, have met the continual demand for silk. The introduction of silk into Europe occurred about the year A.D. 552, in the reign of Justinian, and we find from Tennent's History of Ceylon, (Vol. I., p. 569) that the earliest record made of the introduction of silk into the Island of Ceylon, was in the reign of Justinian, by Cosmas, an Egyptian merchant, who published the narrative of Sopater, a Greek trader, whom he had met at Adule in Ethiopia, when on his return from Ceylon. Sopater told Cosmas that, from China and other emporia, silk and other articles named by him were imported into Ceylon.\nI have searched for information on the subject of Sericulture, or silk, in all the works relating to Ceylon that I could find in the Library of this Society, and in the Colombo and Colonial Medical Libraries. I have looked into Bald\u00e6us, Knox, Valentyn, Percival, Cordiner, Davy, Lee\u2019s translation of Ribeyro, Marshall, Forbes, Knighton, Pridham, Hoffmeister and Tennent, but I have only been able to glean the following scanty information on these subjects.\n\nIn Valentyn\u2019s History, published in 1663, there is the following reference to Sericulture:\u2014\u201cIn Jaffnapatam experiments are made to nourish the silk-worm, and obtain by it a source of livelihood. Mulberry trees have been planted here and in many other places, and they appear to thrive well. In January and February the worms are transported from Jaffna, and other small insects can be collected here. These are occupations which are interesting, and can be undertaken with little pains and at small cost.\u201d\n\nI find from the Appendix to Lee\u2019s translation of Ribeyro\u2019s History of Ceylon, that in March, 1740, the Governor Baron Van Imhoff left the following memorandum on silk for the information of his successor:\n\n\u201cSilk has not been so successful as we anticipated when we began to grow it here.\u201d\n\nIn 1849, Pridham mentions (Vol. I., p. 374) that \u201con account of the dryness of the Northern Province, the culture of the mulberry plant might be almost indefinitely extended by the introduction of the silk-worm, and silk be rendered one of its leading staples, instead of being, as is now the case, completely neglected. The mode of culture practised in Hindostan, as being the most simple, will be at first the best-adapted for the native agriculturist, who has to acquire skill and practice ere he can be expected to improve upon Oriental methods. Much depends upon the abundance of cooly labour, which may be further cheapened by employing children to\nprepare and lay down the sets as soon as the nurseries of the mulberry plant are sufficiently stocked to admit of the operations of the planter.\"\n\nFrom Sir J. E. Tennent's \"Natural History of Ceylon\" I have obtained the following description of the Silk Moths found here:\n\n\"Among the strictly nocturnal Lepidoptera are some gigantic species. Of these, the cinnamon-eating Atlas often attains the dimensions of nearly a foot in the stretch of its superior wings. It is very common in the gardens about Colombo, and its size, and the transparent talc-like spots in its wings, cannot fail to strike even the most careless saunterer. But little inferior to it in size is the famed Tusseh silk-moth [Antheraea mylitta, Drury,] which feeds on the country almond (Terminalia catappa) and the palma christi or castor-oil plant; it is easily distinguishable from the Atlas, which has a triangular wing, whilst its is falcated, and the transparent spots are covered with a curious thread-like division drawn across them.\n\nTowards the Northern portions of the Island this valuable species entirely displaces the other, owing to the fact that the almond and palma christi abound there. The latter plant springs up spontaneously on every manure-heap or neglected spot of ground; and might be cultivated, as in India, with great advantage\u2014the leaf to be used as food for the caterpillar, the stalk as fodder for cattle, and the seed for expression of castor oil. The Dutch took advantage of this facility, and gave every encouragement to the cultivation of silk at Jaffna.\n\n\"The Portuguese had made the attempt previous to the arrival of the Dutch, and a strip of land on the banks of the Kelani river, near Colombo, still bears the name of Orta Seda, the silk garden. The attempt of the Dutch to introduce the true silk worm, the Bombyx mori, took place under the Governorship of\nRyckloff Van Goens, who, on handing over the administration to his successor, in 1663, thus apprises him of the imitation of the experiment:\u2014'At Jaffna Palace a trial has been undertaken to feed silk-worms, and to ascertain whether silk may be reared at that station. I have planted a quantity of mulberry trees, which grow well there, and they ought to be planted in other directions.'\u2014Valentyn, chap. xiii. The growth of the mulberry tree is noticed the year after in a report to the Governor-General of India, but the subject afterwards ceased to be attended to; but it never attained such a development as to become an article of commercial importance.\n\nCeylon now cultivates no silk-worms whatever, notwithstanding this abundance of the favourite food of one species; and the rich silken robes sometimes worn by the Buddhist priesthood, are imported from China and the Continent of India.\n\nIn addition to the Atlas moth and the Mylitta, there are many other Bombycidae in Ceylon; and though the silk of some of them, were it susceptible of being unwound from the cocoon, would not bear a comparison with that of the Bombyx mori, or even of the Tusseh moth, it might still prove to be valuable when carded and spun. If the European residents in the Colony would rear the larv\u00e6 of these lepidoptera, and make drawings of their various changes, they would render a possible service to commerce and a certain one to entomological knowledge.\n\nIn connection with the subject of Sericulture in Ceylon, I have obtained the permission of the Revd. Father Palla, of Galle, to illustrate my paper by the exhibition of a card of silk-worm eggs as originally received from Japan, through Government, in December last.\n\nIn November, 1879, the Rev. Father Palla applied to His Excellency the Governor, Sir J. R. Longden, to use his influence\nin obtaining a supply of eggs from China or Japan. In a few days he received the gratifying information that His Excellency would have much pleasure in applying to the Consul-General of Japan for a supply of eggs.\n\nIn January, 1880, a communication was received by Government from Her Majesty's Consul-General at Yeddo, in Japan, that it was too late in the season to forward any eggs then as they had almost all been exported, but that a supply would be sent in the next season.\n\nIn December, 1880, the first supply was received by Government from Yeddo, and at once handed to Father Palla, who distributed a few cards to some friends who had previously begun the cultivation of the mulberry plant in anticipation of the arrival of the eggs.\n\nThe eggs, which are as small as grains of mustard, as laid by the insect on white cards, (each 14 by 9 inches long,) cover the whole card, so that there are thousands of eggs on each card. The one I now exhibit has been practically hatched and bears the empty shells as well as those which have not hatched as yet. The cards have certain Japanese impressions on them to prove that they are genuine Japanese silk-worm eggs.\n\nThere were several cards, each being covered with tissue paper, and then wrapped in thick covers of China and brown paper. There was also a little box with 100 divisions, numbered; in each division there were six cocoons. The numbers on the divisions corresponded with the numbers on the cards, and the quality of the cocoons and silk, which each card was capable of producing, could be ascertained by reference to these numbers.\n\nThe eggs which were received in December began to hatch in a few days after they were exposed to the air in a ventilated room. It required a magnifying glass to enable one to see the minute caterpillars or larv\u00e6 which were hatched, and these\nhad to be carefully removed and kept in little paper boxes containing tender mulberry leaves. They began to grow rapidly and increase in size, as can be judged from the specimens now exhibited, containing caterpillars of different stages of growth.*\n\n**Indian Species**\n\nDescribed by Captain Thomas Hutton, F.G.S., C.M.Z.S., Corresponding Member of the Agri-Horticultural Society of India.\u2020\n\nWild species of India differ widely in form, habits, food, and silk from the Bombyces proper; they are all wild and indigenous to India and widely diffused wherever there are hills. The type of this group is the well-known *Tussar* or *Tusseh* moth (*Antheraea paphia*) which is found along the coast line from Bombay through Pondicherry and eastward to Bengal, and thence through Cachar, Assam, Darjiling, and even to the Punjab.\n\nWhen left to nature, in a wild state, they are annual or single-brooded; but when domesticated, two to five broods a year may be obtained.\n\nIn the whole family of the Lepidoptera there is no insect so variable in the imago state in point of colouring as the Tussar species, so that a novice would scarcely believe the varieties to be of one species.\n\nThe *Actias selene*, others of that genus, and the *Antheraea*, have a strong, sharp-pointed, horny spine at the shoulder of the wing, which is alternately brought into play in making a cross-cut, or in separating the threads without cutting, until the\n\n---\n\n* The card and other specimens exhibited at the Meeting can be seen at the De Soyza Museum, Ceylon Medical College, Colombo.\n\n\u2020 From the Journal of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India Vol. I. Part 4; New Series.\nmoth makes its exit from the cocoon. In *Actias* the cocoons are not so full of silk as those of *Anther\u00e6a*, but it is \"strong, tenacious, elastic, and brilliant.\"\n\nOne species of wild silk-worm found in the N. W. Himalayas has been named after the writer alluded to, *Bombyx Huttoni*. It will not submit to domestication.\n\nThe other species are *Anther\u00e6a assama*, found in Assam; *Anther\u00e6a Roylei*, found in Mussoree and Simla feeding on the oak; and *Bombyx Mari a P\u00e1t Porloo*, found in Bengal.\n\nOf the *Eria*, *Erie*, *Arrea* or *Arindee* group *Phal\u0153a cynthia*, found in Bengal, feeds on the castor oil plant instead of on the mulberry and yields a coarser silk.\n\nAnother of the *Eria* group is the *Attacus atlas*. It thrives well when found and taken from the jungle, but the moths could not be induced to breed. The *Attacus cynthia* is the same as the *Attacus canningi*, and is abundant in Mussorie and Cachar.\n\nThe above are also described as belonging to the genus \"Saturnia\"\u2014*Saturnia atlas*, 'the giant atlas moth' whose wings measure 7 or 8 inches across; *Saturnia cercropia* and *Saturnia luna* have their wings produced into a tail; *Saturnia cynthia* is the arindi silk-worm of India. Lattreille states that these are the wild species of silk worm of China. *Saturnia promethea* is a North American species. It forms its cocoon within the leaf of a sassafras tree, having previously fastened the stalk of the leaf to the stem by a strong silken web, whereby it is prevented from falling with the other leaves.\n\nWild silk-worms feed upon different trees, such as the jujube, *Ficus religiosa* or Peepul tree, the castor oil plant, the almond, some of the laurel tribe, and others. (*Royle's Productive Resources of India.*)\n\nAs Mr. Geddes of Moratuwa had a supply of silk-worm eggs from Father Palla I wrote to him for such information as he could give me. The following is his reply,\nwhich will be found full of interesting information on this subject:\n\nParate, Moratuwa,\nSeptember 29th, 1881.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to your request for specimens of the Mylitta silk moth, I regret that I have no moths at present, but only some larv\u00e6 of Mylitta and Atlas, which I am rearing for Mr. Alfred Wailly, of London. There must be specimens at the Museum.\n\nThere seem to be several varieties of the Mylitta. According to Major Coussmaker, the Himalayan variety is univoltine (single-brooded) and the larv\u00e6 casts the skin five times, and attains a length of seven inches when full grown. There are smaller varieties in other parts of India, and in the kind found here the larv\u00e6 moults four times and is about five inches long. In India the Mylitta feeds on the *Terminalea tomentosa*, *Zizypus jujuba*, *Lagerstroemia indica*, *Ficus benjamina*, *Carissa*, *Guidia*, and other trees. I do not know if any of these grow here. In this country the Mylitta is to be found on the *kaju*, *kahata*, *milila*, *veralu*, and some other trees; and the Ceylonese variety of the insect is polyvoltine, producing four or five generations in a year. Sir Emerson Tennent says, in his Natural History, that the Mylitta feeds on the leaves of the castor oil tree, but he has confounded it with the *Attacus ricini* or Arinda silk worm, which is quite a different species and does not, so far as I know, exist in Ceylon.\n\nThe word *tussur*\u2014variously written \"tasar,\" \"tusseh,\" \"tussah,\" and several other ways\u2014is derived from *tussurie*, Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed for a shuttle.* In England they call all sorts of wild silk-worms by the general name of \"tussurs,\" but the name properly belongs to the species known scientifically\u2014or rather empirically, for such names have been multiplied until they have become worse than useless\u2014by the various names of *Saturnia paphia*, *Anther\u0153a paphia*, *Anther\u0153a Mylitta* and *Attacus Mylitta*.\n\nThe Mylitta silk-worm cannot be fed on plucked leaves like the mulberry and castor oil species, but must be kept either on growing\n\n* S. \u0924\u093e\u0938\u0930 [tasara], \"shuttle.\"\nthe leaves fresh. It has not hitherto been cultivated except by entomologists, all the tussur silk being made from wild cocoons gathered in the jungles. I have tried keeping the larv\u00e6 on exposed trees, but it did not answer, as they were all destroyed by birds, red ants, or lizards. Major Coussmaker keeps them on bushes covered with bamboo cages, and that plan might answer here; but I believe it would be too expensive a way of obtaining cocoons in sufficient quantity for manufacturing purposes. I keep mine on cut branches, and I have an arrangement by which they are transferred from exhausted branches to fresh ones with very little trouble. But this plan requires a plant that, after being cut and put in water, will not wither before the silk-worms have time to consume the leaves; and I have not yet found any plant that is perfectly satisfactory in that respect for feeding the Mylitta, though, in the case of the Atlas, the *Milnea Roxburghiana* answers perfectly. For the Mylitta I have used *kahata*, *veralu*, and *kaju*, and I am now using *ka\u1e6daka\u1e37u* (Singhalese for a common weed of which I do not know the botanical name). This plant seems to answer better than any I have tried before, but I have had very little experience of it yet. For keeping the branches for the silk-worms I have long tin cylinders placed horizontally and filled with water, and along the upper side of the cylinder there is a bar of wood pierced with holes for inserting the branches; but the plan is not easy to describe, though very simple when seen.\n\nThe culture of the tussur silkworm is only an experiment yet, and except as a matter of scientific investigation, it would be premature to give it any encouragement. Though a silk-worm be polyphagous in a state of nature, yet it does not follow that it has no proper food plant, and the proper food plant of the tussur\u2014if it has one\u2014is not yet known. Then there is no general market for tussur silk, because it is not a recognized commercial product as real silk is. Tussur silk may in future to a considerable extent supersede cotton, and it may also be largely used in combination with cotton and woollen yarn for improving fabrics both in appearance and durability, but it never can be a substitute for true silk. Those who are now giving attention to the artificial propagation of the tussur silkworm may confer a service on future commerce and manufacturing industry, but they\ncannot expect to obtain from their experiments any pecuniary benefit for themselves. In the meantime the thing to be ascertained is the proper food plant of the tussur, for, as I said before, a silkworm's being polyphagous does not prove that it has not a proper tree on which it is more at home than any other. The Arinda silk-worm is polyphagous in a wild state, and yet it has for its proper food plant the castor oil tree. The Atlas is also more polyphagous than the tussur, and yet I know of no tree except the Milnea Roxburghiana on which it can be artificially reared for more than one generation; and while more than a hundred cocoons of the Atlas will be found on a single tree of this species, not more than two or three can be found on any other. I think the proper tree of the tussur must be an Indian species not indigenous to this country, because there does not seem to be any tree here on which the cocoons are to be found in such numbers as to be worth collecting for manufacturing purposes, as is done in India.\n\nIn the meantime the only silk industry likely to be commercially successful is the cultivation of the mulberry. Many persons when they first give their attention to silk production think that wild silk-worms must be more profitable than the mulberry species, but they always become converts to the mulberry in the end.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlex. T. Geddes.\n\nP.S.\u2014The eggs of the tussur moth hatch in 8 days here. In a temperature of 70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 Fah., they hatch in about fifteen, but they lose their vitality and become putrid if the hatching be delayed for more than twenty days. The breed can therefore be transported long distances only in the pupa state. I omitted to mention that the caterpillar, like that of the Atlas, has the habit of devouring its own cast off skin.\n\nI enclose a specimen of tussur silk and one of mulberry silk. The mulberry silk is the one tied with red thread.*\n\n* These can be seen at the \"De Soyza Museum,\" Colombo.\nSINHALESE OMENS.*\n\nBy S. JAYATILAKA, Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n(Read October 6th, 1881.)\n\nOMENS enter largely into the every-day life of the native of Ceylon. They exercise considerable influence in almost every remarkable occurrence or incident in his life\u2014the birth of a child, the marriage of a son or daughter, the undertaking of a journey or speculation, an illness or death in the family, and last but not least, the result of his favourite pastime, a lawsuit.\n\nOne of the peculiar characteristics in Ceylon of faith in omens is that this feeling, or fear, or belief\u2014by whatever name it may be called\u2014is shared alike by all classes of natives.\n\nOmens are of two kinds, lucky and unlucky. If one about to start on a journey, or undertake a particular work, meets with an omen described as a bad one, he postpones the journey and gives up the work for a while, and in many instances he abandons both altogether; and when compelled by necessity to do the one or the other, he does it with the foregone conclusion of a failure.\n\nInstances are known of medical men, summoned to attend on persons dangerously ill, whom, perhaps, timely aid might have saved, returning home and refusing to see the patient, or prescribe for him, as being perfectly useless and unavailing, because just after starting they had met with a bad omen.\n\nThe following verse from an Elu poetical work called Selalihini Sandhasaya, written by Sri Rahula Totagamuv\u00e9, the great poet who flourished about the year\n\n* First published in abridged form in the \"Ceylon Diocesan Gazette,\" March 1st, 1879.\u2014Hon. Sec.\n1410, A.D., enumerates some of the good omens which it is lucky to meet with before commencing a journey or undertaking:\n\nLiterally translated it runs thus:\n\nObserve the following omens, and if met with they are far better than even consulting a good planet:\n\n1. A soft and balmy breeze,\n2. A pitcher filled with water,\n3. Peacocks, or sweet mangoes,\n4. Full-blown white flowers,\n5. A sweet-spoken woman,\n6. A gold vessel,\n7. Waving white ch\u00e1mara,\n8. White umbrellas,\n9. Elephants inflamed with ichor.\n\nThe following Sanskrit stanza, from a miscellaneous work on morals Pratya-slokaya [\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0915\u092f] also enumerates good omens:\n\n\u2020 See Macready's translation. (Colombo, 1865), Stanza XV., p. viii.\n\n\"Look at thine outset for auspicious signs\nE'en better than the nekata, white fans\nWaving, umbrellas white, King elephants,\nWhite flowers in fullest bloom, and sweet-voiced maids,\nGold pictures, gentle breezes perfumed;\nO'erflowing cars, peacocks, and mango fruits.\"\u2014Hon. Sec.\nTranslation.\n\nIt is lucky for a man or a woman on starting on a journey to meet the following objects, viz.:\u2014\n\n1 Virgins,\n2 A milch cow,\n3 A tom-tom,\n4 A conch shell,\n5 Curdled milk,\n6 Fruit,\n7 Flowers,\n8 A flame of fire,\n9 A person after his ablutions,\n10 Horses,\n11 Elephants,\n12 Bullocks,\n13 A pitcher filled with water,\n14 Flags,\n15 S\u0113sat placed on elevated ground,\n16 Two strings of fresh fish,\n17 White boiled rice,\n18 Cow ghee,\n19 A harlot,\n20 Fresh meat,\n21 Sweet words.\n\nThe following Sanskrit stanzas are found in a similar work, and describe certain good and bad omens in connection with reptiles, birds, and beasts:\n\nTranslation.\n\nIf, on starting on a journey, a house lizard should cry on your left, or if a bird, a reptile, jackals, crows, or pigeons cross from the left to the right, it is unlucky; if from the right to the left, it is lucky.\n\nTranslation.\n\nIt is unlucky to meet with the following objects, viz.:\u2014\n\n1 One besmeared with clay or oil,\n2 A cobra,\n3 One with dishevelled hair,\n4 Naked persons,\n5 The aged,\n6 Noseless and blind persons,\n7 People with clotted hair,\n8 People covered with mud,\n9 A gossip, or one given to nonsensical talk,\n10 Empty pitchers,\n11 Dried wood (faggots),\n12 Noisy and quarrelsome people,\n13 Red flowers,\n14 Red garments.\n\nAmongst the Sinhalese or Malabars, any person sneezing suddenly before commencing any work, taking any food or drink, or starting on a journey, allows a short interval to elapse before he begins his undertaking. But according to the following stanzas, extracted from a Medical Miscellany, it appears that in every case a sneeze from every person cannot be considered as prognosticating an omen of ill:\n\nTranslation.\n\nObserve the sneezing of a healthy person. The sneezing of delicate or lean persons and that of cattle forebodes death. Regard not the sneezing of the aged, sufferers from disease of the nose, and children.\n\nTranslation.\n\nSneezing from the\nEast forebodes want of success;\nSouth-east, death;\nSouth, destruction or ruin;\nSouth-west, calamities;\nWest, profit;\nNorth-west, success in whatever one is about to undertake;\nNorth, victory;\nNorth-east, profit.\n\nThe following formula is not unfrequently used in ascertaining the indications of the cry of a lizard, or of the result of a journey or other undertaking. This performance is invariably accomplished by the aid of a second person, the operator.\n\nThe operator arranges on the floor, in any order he chooses, eight pebbles, without letting the enquirer know which pebble he put down first. The operator then calls upon the enquirer to hold or touch any pebble he selects, and commences to recite a portion of the following stanza, from a discourse of Buddha called Ash\u1e6dal\u014dka Dharmmaya, [\u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0932\u094b\u0915\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092e\u092f], word by word, till he comes to the pebble held or touched by the enquirer, and the result is then ascertained and communicated:\n\nTranslation.\n\nProfit, \u2014 Loss:\nMisery or poverty, \u2014 Prosperity or happiness:\nDisgrace, \u2014 Praise or encomium:\nHealth, \u2014 Sorrow.\n\nThe cry of the house lizard, or the cawing of a crow close to a person or a dwelling, is regarded as ominous of either good or evil, and deductions from such occurrences are detailed in two little works (lately corrected and published by one Hisvell\u00e9 Pandit) used as handbooks of reference by Nekett\u00e1s, or astrologers, called Suhunu-s\u00e1straya [\u0938\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f] and Kapu\u1e6du-s\u00e1straya [\u0915\u092a\u0941\u091f\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f]\u2014the \"Science of Lizards\" and the \"Science of Crows.\" Much reliance and faith are placed in these omens, and this feeling is in many instances shared by the more intelligent and educated natives.\nThe age of the above works, unfortunately, cannot be ascertained. I give below extracts with literal translation which I trust will be as amusing as they are interesting:\n\nSCIENCE OF LIZARDS.\n\nThe science of lizards is divided into three main sections:\n\n1.

If the remainder be 1, it indicates the obtaining of something of a whitish colour, or sweet in flavour; if 2, it is bad; if 3, something to gladden; if 4, a quarrel; if 5, happiness and gain; if 6, the mean between good and bad; if no remainders, death.\nBesides the deductions of omens from reptiles, &c., already described, the falling or dropping, from a height, of a lizard, a cobra, a hikanala, a blood-sucker or a chameleon, or a rat, on the body of any person is thus described:\n\nTranslation.\n\nIf on Sunday, it is a prognostication of victorious results in his projects and intentions;\nIf on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday, it is fatal to him;\nIf on Tuesday, it is fatal to his wife;\nIf on a Friday, it prognosticates his being obliged to quit his native country.\n\nShould these animals fall on the right hand side of any person he will gain or inherit riches which will last as long as he lives: if on the left hand side, it forebodes inexpressibly great evil.\n\nThe cry of the lizard, woodpecker, and the cawing of a crow is only ominous when one starts from home on a journey, projects a work, or is about to express an opinion, or when about to ask for something, or give an order\u2014in fact when about to do or think of anything of utility.\nShould a crow caw opposite to you in the morning, it forebodes great sorrow and sickness, death or trouble: if in the noon, profit, gain, and pleasure: if in the evening, gain, and arrival of friends and relatives.\n\nShould it caw in the morning looking towards the sun, great sorrows, sickness, troubles and death, await you: if in the noon, it forebodes the arrival of a friend: if in the evening, obtaining something profitable.\nShould a crow caw (near your dwelling) perched on the uppermost branches of a tree, you will see and converse with a great personage, obtain a present of food, witness the arrival of friends, or experience destruction, sorrow or death; if from the east, rain or wind; if from the west, the meeting of a particular friend.\n\nIf it caw from the north-west, or north-east, looking towards the sun, and perched on a dead tree or a tree without branches, it forebodes the obtaining of meat just killed, or food of whitish colour, and the arrival of a friend within three days.\n\nShould a crow caw from the south-east, perched on the withered stump of a tree looking towards one's face whilst taking meals, it forebodes death, sickness, a sudden journey, or certain death to his wife within three months.*\n\nTo proceed\u2014\n\nTranslation.\n\nShould a crow drop its dung on the head of a person it is a sign of great happiness and comfort ere long: if on the small of the back, or on either of the shoulders, the sign of great happiness and comfort likewise: but if on either of the knees, or on the instep, it is a prognostication of the speedy approach of his death.\n\nThe sudden entrance to any dwelling of certain beasts, birds, and reptiles likewise is considered as a sign of evil, shown from the following stanza, which I quote from a work called Golalipata Namadiya [\u0997\u09cb\u09b2\u09be\u09b2\u09bf\u09aa\u09a4\u09be \u09a8\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a1\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be].\n\n* So Sidrophel to Hudibras:\u2014\n  \"Is it not om'rous in all countries,\n   When crows and ravens croak upon trees.\"\u2014Hon. Sec.\nTranslation.\n\nToucans; Owl; Jackals; Cobras; Swallow; Indian cuckoo; Crows; Outcasts. The entrance of any of these into any human dwelling forebodes its ruin.\n\nThe howling of dogs, jackals, the hooting of an owl from the roof of a house, and the screech of the Ulam\u00e1 or devil-bird near a dwelling-house are considered omens of sickness, sorrow, calamity, or death.\n\nIf a dog happen by some means to climb on to the roof of a house, it is considered as the harbinger of much evil, sorrow, and even death to the family; and the inmates of such houses invariably abandon them at once to avert the evil consequences.\n\nI have known two instances in which very fine houses, built in the Kandyan style\u2014one belonging to a very intelligent and well-informed Rat\u00e9mahatmay\u00e1, the other to a Basn\u00e1yaka-Nilam\u00e9, the latter living within six miles of Kurun\u00e9gala\u2014were abandoned and eventually allowed to fall into ruins in consequence of a dog having been discovered on the roof.\n\nAs one is about to start on a journey or commence any undertaking, a dog flapping its ears is also proverbially known as ominous of bad luck.\n\nIt is said that a dog belonging to a member of the household of the last Kandyan King, located near the store rooms of the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, on one occasion got into the Pattirippuwa (the octagon), and that the Royal astrologers regarded this as an evil omen that would bring ruin upon His Majesty and his possessions ere long. Strange as the coincidence may be, before the expiration of three months the King, hearing of\nthe approach to Kandy of the British troops, had to abandon his throne and kingdom and betake himself to the jungles, where he was captured with his wives, and subsequently transported.\n\nThis belief in omens being identified with domestic life and shared alike by the high and low, is deeply rooted in the native mind, and although the benefits of education and civilization are (aided by the strenuous efforts of the Missionaries) enlightening the masses, it will be long before these superstitions cease to exercise powerful influence over the every-day life of the Sinhalese.*\n\n* \"They are very superstitious in making observations of any little accidents as Omens portending good to them or evil. Sneezing they reckon to import evil. So that if any chance to sneeze when he is going about his business, he will stop, accounting he shall have ill success if he proceeds. And none may sneeze, cough, nor spit in the King's presence, either because of the ill-boding of those actions, or the rudeness of them, or both. There is a little creature much like a lizard which they look upon altogether as a prophet, whatsoever work or business they are going about; if he cries, they will cease for a space, reckoning that he tells them there is a bad planet rules at that instant. They take great notice in a morning at their first going out, who first appears in their sight: and if they see a white man, or a big-bellied woman, they hold it fortunate: and to see any decrepit or deformed people as unfortunate.\" (Knox, \"An Historical Relation of Ceylon, &c.\", p. 64, London, 1681.

The sources of information cannot be too carefully and critically investigated, sifted, analyzed, and tabulated. The feeling of Nirv\u00e1na is hinted at in the Upanishad literature.* It is frequently mentioned in the Br\u00e1hmanic Pur\u00e1\u1e47as.\u2020 In the\n\n* See for instance the Upanishad (Mundaka III. 2. 6.) where the commentator explains Nirv\u00e1na.\n\u2020 See the Bh\u00e1gavat Pur\u00e1\u1e47a, Vishnu Pur\u00e1\u1e47a.\nTantra literature it occurs as a concrete fossilised ceremony.*\n\nIn the Bh\u00e1gavat G\u00edt\u00e1, the scriptures of all the sects of the Hind\u00fas, Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a is the predominant aspiration\u2020; it is cherished by the present generation of the pious Hind\u00fas; it is a prominent idea in their sacred music.\u2021\n\nThere are two schools of Jainas\u2014the Digambara and Sv\u00e9tambara; both propound a view of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a. The ground-basis of their theology and metaphysics is the same as that of the Buddhists.\u00a7 But they do not carry their doctrines to all their consequences. Rationalistic in their feeling and aspiration, they are to a certain extent conservative in their practices and customs. Their literature || is extensive, intricate, and varied\u2014a literature which throws a great deal of light upon the subject of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a.\n\nNirv\u00e1\u1e47a is a central doctrine of Buddhistic theology and metaphysics. The Buddhistic literature of N\u00e9p\u00e1la, the Tibetan Buddhistic literature, the Burmah Buddhistic literature, the Chinese Buddhistic literature, the Ceylon Buddhistic literature\u2014all these have been opened up to scholars by Brian Hodgson, by Cosmo K\u00f6r\u00f6s, by Bigandet, by Beal and by Hardy.\n\nIndian Buddhism, though extinct as a living system, is still important on account of the writings of the different \u00c1ch\u00e1ryas of the different schools. The dicta uttered by the Y\u00f3ga-ch\u00e1ryas, the Sontrantikas the Vaibh\u00e1sikas, and the\n\n* In the Agni Pur\u00e1\u1e47a this ceremony is described because it is an attempt at an Encyclop\u00e6dia of the Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic science, history and philosophy.\n\n\u2020 See (V. 25. and VI. 15.) of the Bh\u00e1gavat G\u00edt\u00e1.\n\n\u2021 See an Abhang\u00e1 of Tuk\u00e1ram:\u2014Nirv\u00e1n\u00edch\u00e1 eka P\u00e1nduranga. See the Prabodha Chandrodaya which describes the doings of Chatainnya of Bengala.\n\n\u00a7 The Jainas recognize karma or eternal activity as the Baudhas do. They discard the notion of god and sacrifice as the Baudhas do. They believe in the eternity of religious truth which they state is revealed from time to time as the Baudhas do. They uphold the doctrine of metempsychoisis as the Baudhas do. Both maintain pain to be positive.\n\n|| There are large Jaina libraries in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and in some towns of the Karnatic.\nM\u00e1dhyamikas are found scattered in the polemical literature of the Br\u00e1hma\u1e47as, such as the writings of Kum\u00e1rla Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da.*\n\nThough the researches of eminent scholars have accomplished much in elucidating the subject of Buddhistic Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a, yet the water sheds of Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic, Jaina, and Buddhistic literature are not reached and investigated. What is known is, however, sufficient to show the series of transformations the doctrine of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a has passed through between 1,000 B. C. (the time of the Upanishad literature), and 1,200 A. D. (the time of Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic and Jaina revival.)\n\nII. A position stated.\u2014A doctrine like that of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a, accepted and acted upon by the masses of people in different countries of the world, is not a mere accident; it is a growth determined by the environment of those who maintain the doctrine\u2014an environment involving historical conditions and circumstances, and originating in a many-sided revolution. Buddhism is a popular revolt against the exclusive \u00c1ryan conquerors. It is a rebellion of the proleteriat against the upper classes. It is the polity of absorption determined to upset the polity of exclusion. It is the masses (S\u0101\u1e45gha) in opposition to the upper classes (Udgha). It is a socialistic movement against the hereditary aristocracy of ancient India and its prior rights. The sequel will elucidate and support this view of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a.\n\nIII. Summary of the differences between the Buddhists and V\u00e9dists.\u2014There were conservative and liberal \u00c1ryas\u2020; the former attempted to exclude half-castes from their schools: the latter encouraged them to learn and gave them instruction.\u2021 The S\u0101\u1e45gha or a class\u2014consisting of the \u00c1ryanized non-\u00c1ryas, half-castes and degenerated \u00c1ryas\u2014was distinguished from the higher classes or genuine \u00c1ryas \u00a7. The leaders of the S\u0101\u1e45gha gradually grew in intelligence and pressed forward, claiming\n\n* See M\u00e1dhava S\u00e1ya\u1e47a\u2019s Sarva Dar\u015bana S\u0101\u1e45graha, which offers a summary of their doctrines.\n\n\u2020 The P\u00farva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 (VI. 1, 26, 27.)\n\n\u2021 Chh\u00e1ndogya Upanishad (IV. 4, 1.)\n\n\u00a7 P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s S\u016btras (III. 3, 86.)\nadmission into the Aryan polity. The Nish\u00e1ds* declared that they could perform sacrifices as the Aryas did. Sacrifice was the soul of all Aryan thought, feeling and activity; and none but the genuine Aryas could perform it.\u2020 The learned Aryas either favoured or opposed the Nish\u00e1ds; there were thus philo-Nish\u00e1ds and anti-Nish\u00e1ds. The conservative Aryas restricted or sought to restrict the rights of women,\u2021 declaring that they could not possess property of their own, that they could not learn in schools, that they could not live independently of the joint-family. The Aryan laws bore hard on the non-Aryas, and on the half-castes\u00a7; even a distinctive costume was prescribed.\u2016\n\nImpressed with the conviction that the Aryan gods were powerful and prompt in granting prayers, and that Aryan institutions conferred superiority and contributed to comforts of this life, the Sangha naturally desired to adopt the forms and modes of Aryan worship, to live as the Aryas lived, and to enjoy themselves as the Aryas did.\u00b6 They were systematically suppressed; and the Sangha was agitated. Vexed and alienated by the superciliousness of Brahmana priests, the Kshatriyas dissented, and condemned the Vedic polity of exclusion.**\n\nSome of the Vaisyas necessarily sympathised with the Kshatriya princes.\u2020\u2020 The Sangha persisted in asserting their rights, but failed in securing them. The conflict between the genuine Aryas and the Sangha terminated in a revolution. Buddhism came.\n\n---\n\n* The P\u00farva M\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1 (VI. 1, 51.) and the K\u00e1l\u00edya Shr\u00f3nica S\u00fatra (I. 1, 12.)\n\n\u2020 The Taittir\u00edya Br\u00e1hma\u1e47a (I. 2, 1, 26.)\n\n\u2021 The P\u00farva M\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1 (VI. 1, 6 and 8.)\n\n\u00a7 The Upakri\u1e63\u1e6da and the Rathak\u00e1ra.\n\n\u2016 The costumes of the Br\u00e1hmans and Kshatriyas are definitely described. They could not assume this.\n\n\u00b6 See the Prasiddhi-isti or the ceremony of an Aryan girl being out: \"Indra grants us wealth and breaks the spells of Dasius\" is the burden of Vedic hymns.\n\n** The lives of such Kshatriyas as Janaka. The internecine war between the Br\u00e1hmans and the Kshatriyas.\n\n\u2020\u2020 The Jainas in India are mostly Vaisyas.\nIV. The platforms of the polities of exclusion and absorption or the Vedic and Buddhistic polities.\u2014The doctrine of worldliness was systematized. It was distinctly stated that the duties of man\u2014or rather Aryan man\u2014were to live in happiness here and hereafter;* but perfect liberty to do as one pleased was not sanctioned. The Veda was recognised as a code\u2020 of ethical, social, and political conduct\u2014the eternal Vedas.\u00a7 Truthfulness as among the Aryas themselves was recognized as a binding and paramount duty.\u00b6 Worldly happiness was identified with heaven; and worldly happiness in its variety could be secured, they believed, by performing duly their sacrifices in conformity with the Veda.\u2016 Gods like Indra or Mitra favoured their exclusive privileges, and it was a special privilege of the Aryas to lord it over the whole world and specially over the non-Aryas.\u2021 The reformers made a new departure: they condemned worldliness, and opposed to it spirituality:** they condemned exclusion and opposed to it universal benevolence: they condemned sacrifice and its arrogant superiority and opposed to it spiritual contrition of the heart: they condemned caste and opposed to it universal brotherhood: the schools were opened to all who sought instruction. A distinction was made between individuality, local in its grasp and earthly in its aspirations, and universality, disclosing transcending views, and inspiring by its deep spirituality. This is the first view of Nirvana\u2014a condition of positive spiritual bliss as distinguished from worldly happiness or temporal power or secular privileges. The Vedic sacrifice pre-supposed worldly prosperity and encouraged secularity.\u2020\u2020 The Vedic Arya sought happiness by acting on external nature and his surroundings. The reformer or the Arya of the\n\n---\n\n* The Purva Mimansa (VI. 1, 1, 3.)\n\u2020 Id. (I. 1, 2.)\n\u2021 Id. See the discussion in (I.)\n\u00a7 This is inculcated or was interpreted from Tai. S. (II., 5, 5, 6.)\n\u2016 The Purva Mimansa system.\n\u00b6 See the Aitareya Brahmana (IV. 3. and VII. 29.)\n** The Upanishads teem with utterances in support of these statements.\n\u2020\u2020 The Purva Mimansa (VI. 1, 10.)\nUpanishads sought spiritual bliss by controlling his passions, and checking his aspirations.* The one felt that bliss, repose, or tranquility was out in the objects he sought\u2014it was objective: the \u0100ch\u0101rya of the Upanishad period felt that tranquility was in himself\u2014it was subjective. The first is systematized in the P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophy: the last in the Y\u014dga doctrine.\n\nV. The cardinal principle of Y\u014dga and the cardinal doctrine of Gautama Buddha.\u2014\"Oh! man, control thyself\" was the principle which Buddha emphatically propounded and inculcated on his followers.\u2020 The Y\u014dga starts and ends with this same statement.\u2021 Nibbuti is thus opposed to Pabatti: attachment to life and its pleasures was opposed to asceticism. This is the first view of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014the view of moderate reforming \u0100ch\u0101ryas who, still revering the Vedic polity, aspired beyond it. Their utterances seek to reconcile sacrifices with spirituality, exclusion with absorption. Influenced by the narrowminded, but glorious, past, they rose superior to themselves, and, ascetically disposed and spiritually moved, looked into a future of universal benevolence.\u00a7\n\nVI. The Naimisya forest and its ascetics.\u2014Either prevented from living in towns or determined to enjoy his ecstatic trance in the solitude of the wilds, the Kshatriya philosopher or the \u015audra, fired with spiritual aspirations, retired into the Naimisya forest, and passed his life there, meditating on the essence of all he saw in external nature or of all he felt within himself. He characterized this conduct as Departure or Pravrajya. He earnestly sought the noumenon which underlies and constitutes all phenomena or tatva. Various were the conjectures of such philosophers and ascetics. Some fixed upon air || as\n\n* The Brihat Aranyakaka Upanishad.\n\u2020\u2021 Compare Vi\u00f1\u00f1anassa Nirodhena etth' etam uparajjhadi\u2014a dictum of Buddha Gautama and Yogastu Chitta-Vritti-Nirodhah\u2014the Y\u014dga S\u016btra (I. 2.)\n\u00a7 This is the spirit of the Upanishad literature. The distinction between Par\u0101 and Apar\u0101 Vidy\u0101 deserves attention (Mund. I. I. 5.) See again the Mundaka Upanishad (12. 2.)\n|| Samvarga Vidya Chh\u0101ndogya Upanishad (IV. 3, 1.)\nthe essence of all existence: others resolved matter and mind into light. Some analyzed life, its conditions and circumstances into a spirit in which they lived and moved: others referred their life and its phenomena to spiritual or meditational warmth. Whatever any of these thinkers fixed upon as the ultimate analytical unit or essence, they all agreed in condemning the Vedic polity which sanctioned animal sacrifices, and inculcated that worldliness itself was the last goal of all human aspirations. Ahinsa (recognition of all animal life being sacred) was the cardinal point of their belief; but they did not in a wholesale manner condemn the past. The Vedic polity with its devotion to caste, to sacrifice, and to the prior rights which they secured was adjudged to be inferior to the new philosophy,* the result of the new departure taken by these reforms. If sacrifice deserved attention and recognition, it deserved attention, because it led to contemplation of the essence of all intellectual, moral and physical phenomena.\u2020 A systematic attempt was made to interpret anew the utterances of the Rishis known as Mantra, and many Mantras were spiritualized away: worldliness was interpreted into spirituality. Women were freely taught: Gargi and Maitreyi discoursed on metaphysical subjects with their distinguished husband Yajna\u00f1alkya. Young men of doubtful birth were initiated into the mysteries of the new philosophy. Thus the land-marks of the Vedic polity were washed off. Aspiration after a new philosophy, earnest spirituality, a spirit of adjustment, new interpretation, a liberality of spirit with which caste and all prior rights were incompatible, distinguished these reformers. Nirvana at this time signified identity and absorption into the unlocalized, universal, subtle essence which pervades all phenomena. A teacher points this out to a pupil:\u2014\"That thou art, Somija \u2021, that spirit which moves the air, from whose fear the sun regularly shines, and to which death itself is obedient.\"\u00a7 Attached to the Vedic polity,\n\n* Distinction between Par\u00e1 and Apar\u00e1 Vidya (Mund. 1, 1, 5.)\n\u2020 Adhi Daivam &c.

See the Br\u0101hma Vid\u0101 Upanishad (VIII.)\nand venerating it, these reformers did not violently denounce it. A modesty* which earnest enquiry generates, and a love of truth\u2020 which results from spiritual emancipation, characterized the period. The Brahmav\u0101dins or Vedic teachers often explained a four-fold salvation,\u2014(i) dwelling in the same place with a god like Indra,\u2014(ii) dwelling near him,\u2014(iii) obtaining his dignity and form,\u2014(iv) identity with him.\u2021 The last was only materially understood by the Vedic teachers. These reformers or ascetics gave a spiritual interpretation to it and insisted upon final absorption into the spiritual essence as emancipation or salvation. This is the back-ground of Buddhistic Nirv\u0101na.\n\nVII. The Jainas or conservative rationalists.\u2014The Jainas divided into two classes\u2014the Sv\u0113tambara and the Digambara, or those wearing white clothes and those who go about naked\u2014are to be found in all parts of India. There are about 2,000 of them in the city of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d alone in Gujar\u00e1t. In this place I cannot discuss the chronology of the Jaina movement, and state the grounds of my belief that the Jainas preceded the Buddhists. The position of the Upanishad reformer was formulated and pressed on the attention of the Vedic \u0100ryas. The conservative sacrificing \u0100ryas attempted coercion. Anathemas were pronounced; prayers, offered. The reformers, aspiring after deep spirituality and communion with the all-pervading spirit, were stigmatized as lethargic and their doctrine was declared to be \"the path of inactivity.\" The sacrificing \u0100rya publicly prayed:\u2014\"Oh! let my lethargy, or rather my tendency to (moral) sleep, depart to the natives of Vidhea or to contemplative inactive men.\u00a7 In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the condition of society is feelingly depicted.

They, therefore, fell victims to scepticism. Their leaders stigmatized their views and stated their grounds. The logic of scepticism\u2020 was thus developed and it would be elucidated by a contrast between the views of the Upanishad reformer and those of the Jaina. The one merely adjusted the importance of a sacrifice and connived at the slaughter of animals; the other was fired by enthusiasm of life\u2014he strongly condemned the slaughter of any animal for any purpose. To the one Vedic lore, though a dispensation old and inferior, yet was important as the means of his superior wisdom; the other discarded all notion of revelation. The one believed that an abstract essence\u2014a generality, was real, eternal, and could be cognized; the other declared that a generality was only a kind of knowledge, and its notion was derived from the knowledge of particular facts. The one aspired after absorption into the eternal, all-pervading essence; the other aspired after maintaining his individuality\u2021 through eternity. The one believed that all phenomena are only transient and are ultimately to be resolved into Br\u0101hma; the other believed that they are real and eternally abide. The one thought that the universe is either created by or emanated from the Supreme Person; the other discarded all notion of a personal creator. The one was definite in his statements and had resort to the utterances of the Rishis and attempted to interpret them anew to support his views; the other more or less hesitated, but declared that virtue eternally abideth, and that it is revealable by eminent teachers.\n\n* Louk\u0101yatika or Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka as popularly known.\n\n\u2020 This is called Sy\u0101d v\u0101da. It states:\u2014Perhaps a thing is\u2014perhaps it is not. Perhaps in sequence of time it is and it is not. Perhaps at once it is and it is not,\u2014this cannot be stated. Perhaps it is and cannot be stated\u2014perhaps it is not, and cannot be stated. Perhaps in sequence of time it is, and it is not, and cannot be at once stated.\n\n\u2021 This view that every individual object has a spirit is met with in the Zendavesta in its chapter on Farohars.\nEqually repelled by the Vedic polity, the reformer and the Jaina rose superior to mere materialism of the Brahmavadins, and sympathised with higher spiritual aspirations and virtue as distinguished from mere ritualism. Philosophically sceptic the Jaina was practically conservative; rationalistic in his method and aspirations, he adhered to his caste and believed in the philosophy of metempsychosis which the Vedic thinkers had developed. The reformer and the Jaina condemned this life as a perpetual source of pain and misery and aspired after emancipation or Nivritti, consisting in the eternal enjoyment of positive happiness and in escaping the transmigration of soul from life to life\u2014the inevitable consequence of all activity.\n\nVIII. The philosophical plexus.\u2014The activity of the Jainas paved the way of the radical rationalists or Buddhists. The ground-basis of the doctrine of emancipation as propounded by the Upanishad reformer or Vedantist, by the Jaina or the conservative rationalist, and by the Buddhist or radical rationalist is the same, because the same cause originated these movements\u2014the opposition to the conquering supercilious Vedic Aryas, their sacrificial exclusiveness, their prior rights, and their all-engrossing worldliness, and materialism. The Vedantist, the Jaina and the Buddhist are all world-weary, and seek the cessation of all activity, and its fruit\u2014the transmigration of soul. Activity or Karma is a potent cause. It is eternal: it is accumulated: it adheres to the human spirit: it produces all phenomena: it abides in the peri-spirit or the semi-material body which it gathers about itself. It is either increased or decreased in one life. As soon as the body decays, and is destroyed it leaves it and takes another body. This activity or Karma is a subtle entity. It is the cause of all human suffering: so long as a particle of this activity remains, there will be to that extent human misery. Separation from it is salvation. Thus human activity, human misery, inseparable from it, and its consequence\u2014metempsychosis, explain all phenomena of human life and of its environment. The practice of virtue, the power of contemplation to nullify the habit of belief in material and corporeal existence, and self-abnegation\u2014these are the remedies\nfor escaping from the trammels of all activity. Thus the Y\u00f3ga philosophy is developed\u2014the philosophy of contemplation or Dhy\u00e1na. I cannot explain in this place its different stages, the progress made from one stage to another, the amount of self-abnegation and power over the self secured, and the knowledge or the intellectual light it generates. The material body is gradually left behind, and the Y\u00f3g\u00ed lives a spirit above all worldliness, above the power of the flesh, free from all power of activity, working miracles and enjoying spiritual beatitude. Activity or rather a tendency to it is the disturbing cause\u2014Up\u00e1dhi. Until a Y\u00f3g\u00ed is completely emancipated, he is in danger of getting into its meshes. Annihilation of all Up\u00e1dhi is complete emancipation. Upon this ground-basis, all V\u00e9d\u00e1ntism, Jainaism, or Buddhism are built. But the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist seeks emancipation from all activity, and practises contemplation and self-abnegation, that the spirit encased in a material body and subject to the power of activity may re-unite with itself in its universality, and being once more unlocalized and universalized, enjoy perfect happiness. The Jaina seeks the emancipation of his individual spirit by the same means and for the same purpose; but he believes that the human spirit maintains its individuality and enjoys happiness for eternity. The Buddhist believes in the power of activity, dreads metempsychosis, practises contemplation and self-abnegation and aspires after emancipation, and yet differs from both the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina materially. His notion of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a will be elucidated by that of the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist or Jaina.\n\nIX. The radical rationalist or Buddhist.\u2014The Buddhist differed both from the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina, and made a new departure. The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist developed into an isoteric school and moved forward on the lines of the V\u00e9dic polity, aspiring after being absorbed into a noumenal essence. The Jaina believed in the individuality of the spirit, and had recourse to acts of charity and faith\u2014a situation into which his logic of scepticism landed him. The Buddhist succeeded in organizing a national movement. His activity accomplished a moral-force revolution which subverted the V\u00e9dic polity itself.\nX. The Buddhistic method.\u2014The V\u00e9dic A'ch\u00e1ryas like \u00c1sval\u00e1yana, P\u00e1\u00f1ini and others, had developed and stated the definition method. Jaimini and Patanjali had developed exegetical logic, stated and applied it. The Jaina had sceptically argued. The definition-method, the exegetical logic and the logic of scepticism paved the way of analytic logic which the Buddhist preferred. He was, therefore, called the analytic reasoner.* A persistent attempt at analysing, classifying, and defining knowledge was made.\n\nXI. Its result.\u2014The Buddhist perceived that the human will was the ultimate analytic unit beyond which he could not proceed. The will was the noumenon from which all he said, thought, and felt was developed. This was the Chitta manas, or Ch\u00e9tas.\u2020 The disparity of human destiny and conditions of human life were explained by the action of accumulated activity or Karma. His realistic analytical reasoning recognized the ideality of knowledge as determined by realistic activity. This will, modified and acted on by Karma or activity or merit, was the basis of which all else was a phase\u2014a quality. But the will \u2021 acted on by activity invariably resulted in pain real and cognizable as such. Activity called into existence the will, and modified it. Its modifications are manifold, varied and subtle. The forms of human life and of phenomenal existence were considered to be so many phases of the human will acted on by activity and were not real. Emancipation from misery, the inseparable result of all activity acting on and modifying the will by externalizing it, was the summum bonum. The Buddhist discarded the reality and individuality of the human will and of the external noumenal essence.\n\n* Vibhajya V\u00e1di.\n\n\u2020 The opening lines of Dhammapada, when interpreted from this standpoint, are adequately and consistently adjusted. \"Man\u00f3pubbanga gam\u00e1 Dhamm\u00e1\" is a phrase which is not adequately comprehended by those who have attempted to explain it, because they have not carefully examined the antecedents of Buddhism.\n\n\u2021 The Abhidhamma\u2014the metaphysical portion of the Tipi\u1e6daka recognizes and states Chitta, Ch\u00e9tasika, R\u00fapa, and Nibb\u00e1na.\nXII. The determining causes; the Buddhistic stand-point stated.\u2014The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist aspired after the eternal noumenal essence, and submitted to the V\u00e9dic polity with its caste, and prior rights, though he sought to interpret the V\u00e9dic code as liberally* as he could. The Jaina recognised the reality and individuality of the human spirit, the basis of his logic of scepticism. His inactivity and his conservatism, the Buddhist necessarily outgrew. Absorbed in profound thought, impelled by introspection, he feelingly believed, and assiduously taught. His view of the human will and of phenomenal existence was thoroughly analytic and the stand-points of the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina determined his view. The gross feeling or K\u00e1ma was distinct from form, and form was distinct from the ideal existence of form but not free from action or Kriy\u00e1. Beyond this was the life of contemplation, of introspection, of deep absorption, of all freedom from externalization gross or subtle. This is the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara, the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara, Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara, and L\u00f3kuttara, forms of life. In the last there is no action whatever, no Kriy\u00e1 chitt\u00e1ni, but the Vip\u00e1ka chitt\u00e1ni are playful, the Chitta or the will as acted on by itself.\u2020 To sum up, all gross and pure action and bustle\u2021 in the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara life; pure for mal action, but no bustle in the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara life,\u2014abstract ideal action in the Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara life; but peace and inaction are the exclusive privileges of L\u00f3kuttara life.\n\nXIII. The ground basis of Buddhism or the A'riya-sachchas, and the Indian system of Y\u00f3ga.\u2014(1) Dukkha sachcham, or suffering in its variety; (2) Samudaya sachcham, or all life as a development of different analytic conditions; (3) Dukkha nirodha, or suppression of all thought and feeling of suffering; and (4) final emancipation.\u00a7 U\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u00e1na (Vyutth\u00e1na) or Pavatti (Prav\u1e5bitti) or gross life of mere externalization is common to\n\n---\n\n* See the Story of J\u00e1b\u00f3la in the Chh\u00e1ndogya Upanishad, 4.\n\u2020 See the 1st Parichhed\u00e1 of the Abhidhamm\u00e1tttha Sangaha.\n\u2021 The term \u00datt\u00e1nam (Vyutth\u00e1nam in Sanskrit) characteristically expressed this. Y\u00f3ga was the latter term. Pavatti (Prav\u1e5bitti in Sanskrit) is another term.\n\u00a7 See the 9th Parichhed\u00e1 of the Abhidhamm\u00e1tttha Sangaha.\nboth Buddhism and Y\u00f3ga. Both recognize that suffering (Kl\u00e9sa) is the inevitable destiny of humanity, a destiny intensified by the elaborate system of metempsychosis, both state that the Chitta or the heart, the intellect and will\u2014combined and forming one unit\u2014is constantly acted on and modified by activity, and a tendency to externalization, and this is the cause of all suffering. Both proclaim aloud that the suppression of this tendency is the means of happiness.* The means of accomplishing this suppression are identical in both, intense contemplation\u2020 which ends in producing a vision or higher knowledge.\u2021 The great point of difference is, the human will is the last unit recognized by the Buddhist, and beyond it he does not go. His notion of the human will corresponds to that of Y\u00f3ga; but Y\u00f3ga sees behind the human will a spirit which is essentially identical with the all pervading spirit, but which is enthralled and encased in the human body. This is the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist view. The Jaina rejected it and declared the independent individuality of the human spirit, ever independent and ever existing by itself. The Buddhist rejected both as noncognizable by his intense and profound introspection. He knew he saw (R\u00fapa); he knew he perceived (V\u00e9dan\u00e1); he knew he reflected (Sa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1); he knew his mind was acted on by itself, and its activities, and that which its merits and demerits attached to it (Sankh\u00e1ra); he knew he rose superior to all this, and absorbed in contemplation, realised a tranquility and a profundity of feeling (Vi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na). Beyond this, \u00a7 in the realm of infinity of knowledge or intellect, he lives, preparing for entering the stream of the great paths. When in this condition, he is above all\n\n* Notice and compare the following\u2014Yogachitta Vritti Niradhah\u2014the second S\u00fatra of the Y\u00f3ga Philosophy. (explained in my \"Studies in Indian Philosophy.\") and the utterance of Buddha Gotama, \"etassa nirodhana idha' etam nirujjhati.\"\n\n\u2020 Sam\u00e1dhi or Jh\u00e1na. The Buddhist has elaborated this by his analytic reasoning. The Y\u00f3ga simply states it.\n\n\u2021 Compare Sam\u00e1patti in both, and the \u00d1ana Dassana S\u00e1ma\u00f1\u00f1a phala, Vipassan\u00e1 Dibbachakkhu of the Buddhist with Ritambhara Praj\u00f1\u00e1 of the Y\u00f3gi.\n\n\u00a7 A'k\u00e1sana\u00f1ch\u00e1yatana; Vi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na\u00f1ch\u00e1yatana; A'kincha\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1yatana; Nevasa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1nasa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1yatana.\nform: he is conversant with nothing but abstract knowledge; his will is, however, affected and works.* His five-fold combination falls to pieces and ceases to exist when he enters the four paths. His intense contemplation and introspection failed him when he attempted to soar higher than this. Nor did he see the necessity of going beyond this. The tendency to externalization inseparable from the will so liable to be affected by external and internal influences, being destroyed, that on which Kamma can act, is destroyed. If nothing beyond the Chitta or the human will or heart in its five Skandhas existed or could be realised, then nothing in the form of noumenal essence would be thought of. The Buddhist began with introspection and ended with it.\n\nXIV. Buddhistic attitude towards the V\u00e9dic, V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist, and Jaina systems.\u2014He hates the V\u00e9dic polity, its pantheon, its hierarchy, its exclusiveness, and its prior rights. To him the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist goes only half the way, and the Jaina is wrong, and is not able to contemplate and introspect. The V\u00e9dic polity recognizes the independent eternal individuality of the human spirit.\u2020 It is the basis of the Purva M\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1 philosophy. Q\u1e47\u1e0dulomi had stated it long before Jaimini. The Jaina follows the V\u00e9dic polity in this, but the Buddhist rejects it as likely to land him in all the absurdities of ritualism and caste as he conceives it. The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist recognised eternal noumenal essence consisting in eternal existence joined to intelligence and happiness.\u2021 When introspection unlocalized and universalized his inner self or the Chitta, he found himself plunged in a nothingness immeasurably expanding on all sides, transcending all thought, and growing into an infinitude of space and eternity.\n\nXV. Up\u00e1dis\u00e9sa Nibb\u00e1na.\u2014The peri-spirit comes into existence, energises and externalises so long as a tendency to Karma exists. The tendency is annihilated when all desire is vanquished, when a Buddhist has risen superior to the flesh.\n\n* Mark the Vip\u00e1kachitta and Kriy\u00e1chitta as explained in the Abhidhamma.\n\n\u2020 S\u0101chchid\u00e1nanda. This is the watch-word of all schools of V\u00e9d\u00e1ntists: it is based on utterances in the Upanishads.\nWhen in this condition a Buddhist is J\u00edvan Mukta, one who is emancipated while living, he is Bh\u00e1vit A\u2019tman, one who is unlocalized and universalised. He has yet, however, to live for some time and his accumulated activity is to be consumed by dint of mere living. When the accumulated activity is thus exhausted, he is completely emancipated when he dies, i.e., when his peri-spirit (the Pa\u00f1chaskandhas) fall to pieces, and when it can no longer act. The first condition is characterised as Up\u00e1dis\u00e9sa Nibb\u00e1nam. A Buddhist is an Arhat. He is in the fourth Rath. He is a perfect Y\u00f3gi. He can perform miracles. He lives in a condition of beatitude. He lives on the earth merely to live out his last portion of earthly existence. The last condition\u2014the condition of an Arhat after his death is characterised as Anup\u00e1dis\u00e9sa Nibb\u00e1nam. The Y\u00f3ga system of Indian philosophy throws a flood of light on this view of Nibb\u00e1na. A perfect Y\u00f3gi ecstatically declares he has only to pass a few days of his last earthly existence in sportiveness. \u201cEmancipation is my wedded spouse.\u201d *\n\nXVI. Anup\u00e1dis\u00e9sa Nibb\u00e1na.\u2014Perfect Nibb\u00e1na is characterised in the following way by the Buddhists :\u2014\u201cA condition (Padam) permanent (Achchutam), infinite (Achchautam), unconditioned (Asankhatam), highest (Anuttaram)\u2014Nibb\u00e1nam this say the great sages (Mahesayo) who are delivered from all desire (V\u00e1namukt\u00e1).\u201d \u2020 I attach some importance to the term Viharati \u2021 \u201clives in sportiveness\u201d used in the Mah\u00e1n\u00edbb\u00e1na Sutta. \u201cAgain a Y\u00f3gi free from desire, from the sight of existence, sees the Sankh\u00e1ra as nihil; (sees) the Skandh\u00e1yatana-n\u00e1ni, and Dh\u00e1tavat as nihil (both) spiritually and materially; sees (all) realities distinctly as infinite (An\u00e1lava) and known by the properties of ether (\u00c1k\u00e1sha) and of the law of Buddha (Dharma).\u201d \u00a7 \u201cEmancipation is the result of the extinction of all desire, the consequence of thought and feeling.\u201d || I have\n\n* See the Abhangas of Tuk\u00e1rama.\n\u2020 See the 6th Parichhedha of the Abhidhamm\u00e1tttha Sangaha.\n\u2021 See page 30 of Childer\u2019s edition.\n\u00a7 See the Lalita Vist\u00e1ra Chap.

Perfect Nirv\u0101\u1e47a stated.\u2014It is a negation of all that man, thinks, feels, and wills. So far it is nihilism. It is a negation of all suffering which results from thought, feeling and volition. So far it is nihilism. But suffering according to a Buddhist, a Jaina, or a V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist is a positive entity. Happiness he does not recognize as positive. Suffering (Dukkha) is positive and results from localized existence. Both localized existence and suffering are destroyed together. When this is accomplished, unlocalized universalization is emancipation, co-extensive with happiness itself. Suffering is the inevitable result of all localization: happiness\u2014of all universalization. Hence Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is both negative and positive. It is not nihilism. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is beyond all localization. This is what all the Buddhists state. Reasoning on the basis of introspection alone, and observing the facts as they develope in the inner man, they stated that there are different degrees of localization. Infinity itself, as conceived by man, is localized. Eternity as conceived by man is localized. Hence persistent efforts were made by Buddhists so to soar in contemplation as to rise higher than all conception itself, as to leave behind all thought, feeling, and volition. In the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara all is gross, material, involved in a multiplicity of all that is \"frail and feverish;\" above it is the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara, the region of Gods and Divinities. Form is localized, and what is grosser and more material than form is dropped. Beyond the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara is the Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara in which form itself is dropped, i.e., left behind. Infinity, eternity, is contemplated. But being the subject of contemplation, it is localized. In the four paths all this is left behind, and all tendency to localization is checked, i.e., destroyed. Existence\u2014substance\u2014that which is the nameless, the formless, the eternal, the infinite, the permanent, the unconditioned has a tendency to be localized. This tendency to be localized is what is called activity or Karma. It is strengthened as it is indulged. The tendency localizes the universal and Panchaskandhas result.\nThen there is immediately thought, feeling and volition which are inseparable from suffering. Buddhism does not attempt to state the properties or attributes of the unlocalized\u2014the eternal\u2014because no matter how carefully a statement is made, the fact of statement will localize it. It is, therefore, beyond all statement. It is enough to say\u2014it is Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nXVIII. Conclusion.\u2014Buddhism is an interesting study, scientifically, philosophically, religiously, socially, and politically. Scientifically, because science seeks the unification of force and the elements which embody all force; philosophically, because Buddhism discovers to what the psychological method of introspection leads; religiously, because when there are so many Buddhists in the world, not believing in a personal God and not yearning to worship Him the fact of religious instincts of man calls for re-examination and re-statement; socially, because it ignores all ritualism, ceremonies, and social life in its amplitude and minutude, in its materialism and its subtility of love, and ambition; and politically, because the convent of the Buddhists subverted the Vedic polity of caste, sacrifice and prior rights, and justified the aspirations of a proletariat and placed them on a legitimate basis for the first time in the history of man.\nTWO SINHALESE INSCRIPTIONS.\n\nBy B.

De Soyza Mah\u0101 Mudaliy\u0101r, who courteously lent it to the translator. It is to be regretted that the Mah\u0101 Mudaliy\u0101r\u2019s health prevents him from completing the translation which he undertook some years back.\n\nWith a view to test the accuracy of the copy, the translator visited the temple-premises at Pepiliy\u0101na, but, to his great disappointment, he found the stone in detached fragments built up into a wall, and the fragments themselves so much defaced that they could not be utilized for testing the style or spelling\nof the transcript. The translator has, therefore, taken the liberty to note and italicise what he considers clerical errors and place the proposed readings at the bottom of each page. He will feel thankful to any persons who may favor him with their remarks on the doubtful words of the text which he has noted, or suggest any better readings than those proposed by him.*\n\n**Inscription.**\n\n*Mr. L. De Soysa read a Paper on the Pepiliy\u00e1na inscription before the Society some years ago, but it was not printed in the Journal at the time, and is now lost. The following extract from the Paper appeared in the Ceylon Times of June 11th, 1873:\u2014\n\n\"This inscription, is to be found on a rock on the site of an ancient Buddhist Temple near K\u00f3tt\u00e9, where from A. D. 1410 to A. D. 1542 Sinhalese Kings held Court.\n\n\"No part of the ancient buildings of the Temple now remain, having been, it is said, levelled to the ground, by the Portuguese who destroyed this and other buildings in and near K\u00f3tt\u00e9.\n\n\"My copy of the inscription was taken from one in the possession of a Buddhist Priest who now occupies the modern Pansala built on the supposed site of the ancient Temple, and I was informed by him that his teacher's teacher obtained it some 70 or 80 years ago, from a transcript preserved in the\n\n\\[a \\text{ } b \\text{ } c \\text{ } d \\text{ } e \\text{ } f \\text{ } g \\text{ } h \\text{ } i\\]\nArchives of the late King of Kandy. There can be no question however, as to its genuineness. I have compared it with such parts of the stone as still remain, and have found that it exactly corresponds with the stone. The style and matter too of the inscription furnish indisputable evidence of its genuineness and authenticity.\n\n\"The inscription records the erection and endowment of a Buddhist Temple in memory of his deceased mother Sun\u00e9tra Mah\u00e1 D\u00e9vi, by King Sri Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI., who reigned at K\u00f3tt\u00e9 (according to Turnour) from A.D. 1410 to 1462. It also contains a variety of provisions for the due maintenance of the temple: for the expenditure of its income: and regulations for the observance of the clerical and lay members of the establishment.\n\n\"The style of the inscription is similar to that of other writings of the 14th or 15th centuries; and Mr. Alwis has published in his Introduction to the Sidat Sangar\u00e1, the introductory paragraph of the inscription as a specimen of the prose of that age. The construction of the sentences, however, is very peculiar. The whole of the inscription, which is a very long one, is conglomerated, as it were, into one sentence by means of conjunctive particles and participles, having apparently only one finite verb expressed. The words in general are those in modern use, with a very few exceptions which I have noticed in the notes.\"\n\"The date assigned to the King's accession is stated to have taken place in the year of Buddha 158 (A.D. 1415), whereas Tarnour in his adjustment of Sinhalese Chronology, computed from native records, has fixed the date at 1593 (A.D. 1410) five years earlier. The authority of the stone however, cannot be disputed, and it is in a remarkable manner confirmed by the well known contemporary poem K\u0101ya\u015bekhara, the author of which was the most learned monk of the age, and, according to tradition, the King's adopted son.\n\n\"The regulations enacted for the management of the Temple establishment and for the distribution of its income are also very curious, and throw considerable light on the manners, customs, and social condition of the Island at the period in question. It shows that the form of Sinhalese letters now in use have not undergone any material change, during, at least, the last five or six hundred years, with the exception of a few.\n\n\"It is believed by many that the worship of Hindu Gods, and the practice of Hindu rites and ceremonies, were introduced into Ceylon by the last Malabar King who obtained the throne of Kandy, after the extinction of the Sinhalese Royal Family about the year A.D. 1739; but it would appear from the inscription that the innovation is of much earlier date. The King it is well-known was an eminent patron of Buddhism, having built four D\u0113valas in connection with the Vih\u0101r\u0113.\"\u2014Hon. Sec.\n190 JOURNAL R. A. S. (CEYLON). [Vol. VII., Pt.

Let no residents of the Vih\u0101ra be sold away by persons of any rank. Let all these orders be strictly carried out with energy under the royal patronage.\n\n\"As between a gift and protection, protection is superior to a gift; by means of a gift one attains heaven; by means of protection one attains the imperishable state.\"\\textsuperscript{28}\n\nA good man, therefore, who desires to enjoy such happiness of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, should take a deep interest in the maintenance of the abovementioned Vih\u0101ra and endeavour, by the efficacy of the same meritorious act, to see the Supreme, Omniscient Maitr\u012b Buddha, to hear his sermons, and, at last, to enter the city of the great Nirv\u0101\u1e47a which is tranquil, undecaying, undying, safe and immortal which was attained by the (Supreme) Buddhas, inferior Buddhas, and the great Rahats.\nNotes.\n\n1.

Gunatilaka, Esq.\n\n(Read, September 14th, 1882.)\n\nVery great interest and importance attach to the folk-lore of any nation, as is evidenced by the labors bestowed on the subject by eminent writers, and the manner in which those labors have been appreciated. The tales of a people once collected and recorded afford material alike for the ethnologist, the philologist and the historian to build upon, and enable them to arrive at truths previously unknown, and to throw fresh light upon theories which are but partially established. It is not the amusement which the tales and stories afford that makes them valuable but it is the great truths which they point to in the field of literature and science that commend them to our notice and study. Readers who wish to have some idea of the importance of folk-lore to ethnology and its cognate sciences, will find the subject fully treated in the \"Chips from a German workshop\" of Max M\u00fcller, and in the introduction to the \"Popular Tales from the Norse\" of Mr. Dasent.\n\nWhile different writers have labored in the work of collecting tales in other countries, while each successive number of the \"Indian Antiquary\" presents to us the folk-lore of the Panjab and other parts of India, it is a matter both of regret and surprise that no writer in Ceylon has, so far as I am aware, yet begun to work in a systematic manner in collecting the folk-lore of this Island.\n\n* I was requested by the Honorary Secretary of this Society, about a month ago, to prepare a Paper to be read at this Meeting, and he suggested the Folklore of Ceylon as a subject that would be of interest. Although the time at my disposal was insufficient either to collect materials, or, when collected, to digest them, I readily accepted the undertaking, convinced that any shortcomings on my part would be excused in view of the shortness of the time given me and the difficulty of the subject to be dealt with.\nMr. Steele the author of a metrical translation of the *Kusa J\u00e1taka* has,\u2014no doubt with the view of attracting the attention of literary men to this interesting subject,\u2014given a few Sinhalese stories as an appendix to his work, and has concluded them with the following appropriate observations:\n\n\"Old-world household stories are very plentiful in Ceylon. The foregoing may be of interest as shewing how rich a field, one little harvested yet, lies open to the gleaner. When it is remembered that, besides the aboriginal wild race, the Vedd\u00e1s, the Island is the home of Sinhalese, an \u00c1ryan race from the upper valley of the Ganges, of Tamils, of Moors, the descendants of the ancient Arab navigators, who, as Sinbad avouches, voyaged often to Serendib, of Malays, not to mention Pars\u00eds, Chinese, Kaffirs from Eastern Africa, M\u00e1ldivians, Beng\u00e1l\u00eds and many others,\u2014men of widely diverse descent and creeds, the abundance of, so to speak, unwrought folk-lore will be readily recognised.\n\n\"It is the writer's hope, should the present venture meet with favor and acceptance, to offer a large and more varied selection to the reader hereafter.\"\n\nThe hope here entertained has not, I think, been realized, nor has the subject been taken up by any other writer that I am aware of.\n\nA complete collection of the tales and stories existing in Ceylon,\u2014and I think they exist as abundantly here as in any other country in the world,\u2014can only be the work of time. It is therefore desirable that, rather than wait to make such a collection, writers who may wish to labor in this field of literary investigation should publish what stories they may collect in the columns of this Society's Journal as the only literary periodical in the Island.\n\nThe present Paper is merely a beginning in this direction, and it is to be hoped that other writers who are more able than myself to undertake the task, and have more leisure at their disposal than I can command, will from time to time contribute their collections to this Journal, and thus supply a store of materials for future scientific and linguistic investigations.\nIn the work of collection it is necessary that a great deal of care and discrimination should be exercised, for what is really wanted and what can lead us to real truths are the genuine stories of the Sinhalese\u2014those which are quite free from foreign influences and have existed among the people from time immemorial. These can only be gathered from the inhabitants of villages and of the remoter parts of the Island into which western civilization has not yet penetrated. In the principal towns and suburbs there are now current among the Sinhalese several stories taken from English books and other sources, and hence too much care and caution cannot be exercised in deciding whether a story is really free from such influences or not.\n\nIn this paper I am able to give only one Sinhalese story out of the collection I have made. Its aim is to shew the cunning and avarice of women and the fertility of their resource when tricks have to be resorted to for the accomplishment of an object, the averting of a calamity or the getting out of a difficulty.\n\nIn order to understand the story it is necessary that the reader should know what is meant by the expressions \"to take sil\" and \"to give sil.\" Sil is a religious observance. \"To take sil\" is to vow or to promise and solemnly undertake to follow strictly the precepts of Buddha, not to kill, not to steal, not to drink &c. One desirous of taking sil attends the Pa\u1e47sala and after bowing down in reverence to the priest recites \"the three saranas\" as follows, the devotee repeating them after him:\n\nBuddha\u1e43 sara\u1e47a\u1e43 gacch\u0101mi,\nDhamma\u1e43 sara\u1e47a\u1e43 gacch\u0101mi,\nSa\u1e45gha\u1e43 sara\u1e47a\u1e43 gacch\u0101mi.\n\nThis is done three times after which the commands or precepts are recited by the priest and repeated by the devotee. In this ceremony the priest is said \"to give sil\" and the devotee \"to take or receive sil.\"\n\nI must also premise before beginning the story that when a priest is invited by a layman to his house for the purpose of performing a religious ceremony or of partaking of meals usually\ncalled *dan* or *d\u00e1na*, \"a gift or any thing given,\" it is not permitted to the priest to decline the invitation, except under unavoidable circumstances such as sickness or a prior engagement.\n\nThe story then runs thus.\n\nOnce on a time there was a simple and dull-witted man who had a cunning and artful wife. The woman was, however, much devoted to religion, and was a regular attendant on *p\u00f3ya* days at the Vih\u00e1ra and P\u00e1nsala in order to worship Buddha and to receive *sil*. The man, who had previously paid no attention to religion, was one day seized all of a sudden with a desire to follow the example of his wife, and calling her immediately to his side said, \"I wish to take *sil*: tell me how I should set about it.\"\n\nThe wife delighted to see her husband form so good a resolution said, \"Get up very early in the morning, go to the P\u00e1nsala with a pingo of boiled rice and curries, offer them to the priest, and repeat the words which he will pronounce.\"\n\nThe earnestness with which the man formed his resolution and his anxiety to act on it were so great that sleep fled from his eyes, and he impatiently watched for the dawn to hasten to the priest's residence. Long before the break of day he set out for the P\u00e1nsala which lay about a mile from his house. On arriving there he found the door closed, but he knocked with such violence as to rouse the priest who was fast asleep in an inner chamber.\n\n\"I wonder\" said the priest to himself \"who this can be that disturbs my repose at this ungodly hour.\" So saying he rose and began to rub his eyes. The knocks on the door continued with redoubled vigour. The priest then jumped out of bed, and approaching the door with some degree of anxiety said \"Kavuda?\", \"Who's there?\"\n\nThe man, following literally the instructions of his wife as to repetition, replied \"Kavuda?\"\n\nThe priest could not understand how any one could be in the mood for fun at such a time or place, and drawing still nearer the door said, \"Mokada?\", \"What's the matter?\"\n\"Mokada?\", repeated the man.\n\nThe priest was bewildered. He could not for the life of him understand the meaning of so strange a proceeding, and he called out in a loud and stern tone, \"Allapiya\", \"Lay hold (of him).\"\n\n\"Allapiya\" was as quickly echoed forth.\n\nThe priest then went into one of the rooms to wake up his servant, and in the meantime the simpleton, hearing nothing more, concluded that the ceremony was over and returned home, leaving the pinga at the door. The priest and his servant opened the door to see what it all meant, and right glad were they to find the pinga, but they could see no one.\n\nOn reaching home the man called his wife to his side and said, \"I have received sil: I feel such a change: I am determined to be more assiduous than you have been in the observance and practice of the rite.\" The man then went to work in the field, returned home in the evening, and took his dinner, but was scarce in bed before he repeated \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya.\"\n\n\"What's the sense of these words?\", enquired the wife in surprise.\n\n\"I am reciting what the priest taught me when he gave me sil,\" said the man.\n\n\"I wonder if you're right in your head!\", said the wife.\n\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"in right good earnest I tell you, I repeat what the priest taught me. I am practising sil.\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me,\" retorted the woman. \"If you're not mad already, you're very near it!\"\n\nThe man, however, paid no attention to his wife's words believing her to be in jest, but kept repeating the words all night long at frequent intervals, to the serious disturbance of his wife's rest and that of the other inmates of the house. This went on for several nights, and nothing that the wife could think of had the effect of convincing the man of his mistake.\n\nAbout this time three thieves broke into the King's Treasury at night, and stole from it a part of his treasure, consisting of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls and jewels of great value.\nCarrying off their booty they came to the pilikanna [back part] of the man's house, and, as it was a safe and convenient spot for the division of their spoil, they began to divide it. They had hardly commenced their task when they were startled by the words \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya\" in a loud voice from within the house.\n\n\"We are undone,\" said one of the thieves: \"Discovered most certainly,\" said another: \"Hush! hush!\", said the third, \"the words may have been addressed to somebody else.\"\n\nSo they made up their minds to go on with the division, but had scarcely recommenced before the same words \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya\" fell on their ears. Then they forthwith took to their heels leaving the booty behind.\n\nThe man hearing all the clatter outside, went to the pilikanna with a light, and saw to his amazement the three heaps of treasure. He immediately awoke his wife and took her to the spot. Her eyes beamed as she beheld the unexpected wealth. Husband and wife together conveyed the heaps into the house, and all was secure in trunks before the day dawned.\n\n\"Now,\" said the man, \"was it not my observance of sil that brought us this luck?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the wife, \"I am glad you have been so earnest in its practice.\"\n\nThe man's thoughts were now directed to the consideration, as to how best he might shew his gratitude to the priest who had given him sil.\n\n\"It is our duty,\" said he to his wife, \"to make a gift of one-third of the wealth to the priest who gave me sil, and who has thus been the means of our acquiring this unlooked for fortune. Prepare breakfast for him, therefore, to-morrow morning, and I will invite him to partake of it, and to receive the offering of a third of the treasure.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said the woman, \"that will never do. What the priest taught you was not sil.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said her husband, \"hold your tongue and attend to what I say. I must shew my gratitude to the priest; I must give him a third of the wealth,\"\n\"Well, if you must\u2014you must\" said the woman.\n\nWords and tears were of no avail. The man was firm as a rock, and his wife gave up all hopes of dissuading him from his purpose.\n\nNext morning she prepared meals for the priest. The man called at the Pansala and said to the priest: \"My lord, you were kind enough to give me sil some time ago, and I have been a constant and diligent observer of the rite ever since. The result is that I have been blessed with very valuable treasure, quite sufficient to keep me and mine comfortable for many generations to come. Condescend therefore to repair to my humble abode, partake of the meal I have prepared for you, and receive one-third of the fortune I have come by, as a token of my gratitude.\"\n\n\"I never saw you before,\" said the priest, \"nor do I remember having ever given you sil.\"\n\n\"Then it must be some other priest in this Pansala,\" said the man; \"it matters little which, only come and receive the gift.\n\nThe man led the way and the priest and his servant followed, not, however, without some suspicion and fear. When they had come within sight of the house the man saw his wife standing in the compound.\n\n\"Come on leisurely,\" said the man to the priest, \"while I run a-head to see that everything is ready for your reception.\" So saying the man ran up to his wife and whispered in her ear, \"Has our neighbour brought the curds we ordered last evening?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"I will go and fetch it then,\" said he; \"in the meantime give the priest a seat and attend to him till I return.\"\n\nNow when the priest saw the man whispering in the woman's ear, his suspicions of some foul play, which had already been roused, were almost confirmed.\n\nSo when he got to the house he said to the woman, \"Pray what did your husband whisper in your ear?\"\n\n\"Bad luck to you! \", said the woman, \"my husband is gone to fetch a rice pounder to make an end of you!\"\nWhen the priest heard this he ran as fast he could and the servant after him.\n\nThey had not run far before the man returned with the curds.\n\n\"Why are they running away?\" said he.\n\n\"That's more than I can say,\" answered his wife; \"but the priest told me to ask you to follow him with a rice-pounder.\"\n\nThe man hastened into the kitchen, took up a rice-pounder, and away he went at full speed.\n\n\"Stop a bit! stop a bit! your Reverence,\" he bellowed.\n\nBut the priest, seeing the man actually following with a rice-pounder, redoubled his steps and was soon out of sight, and the man could not find him though he searched every nook and corner of the Pa\u1e47sala.\n\nSo the man returned home and never more thought of offering the wealth to the priest, and right glad was the woman to find that her plan had succeeded so well.\nBUDDHA'S SERMON ON OMENS.\n\nBy Louis De Zoysa, Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n(Read, September 14th, 1882.)\n\nThat the Founder of Buddhism has repudiated caste and superstition both in theory and practice, is well known. A high authority* has characterized Buddha as \"the great opponent of Hind\u00fa caste and superstition.\" But in countries like Ceylon, in which Hind\u00faism had prevailed before the introduction of Buddhism, caste and superstition still exist though in a modified form; and writers whose information is derived from secondary sources are apt to forget the real teachings of Buddha on these subjects. A notable instance of this I may mention here. A recent writer,\u2020 \"On the Religions of India\" has, according to a review of his work in the Atheneum, attributed the introduction of caste into Ceylon to the influence of Buddhism!\n\nI hope to lay before the Society from time to time, translations of extracts from Buddhist writings bearing on these two subjects. In the present note I shall confine my remarks to the subject of \"superstition,\" reserving those on \"caste\" for a future occasion.\n\nA fair idea of Buddha's views on superstition may be formed on reference to two papers published in this Society's Journal. I allude to the able translation of \"Brahmaj\u00e1la Suttan\"\u2021 by the late Revd. D. J. Gogerly, in which various superstitions are enumerated and condemned as \"unworthy and animal sciences,\" and to my own translation of two J\u00e1takas, (Nakkhatta and N\u00e1masiddhi),\u00a7 one of which exposes the folly of\n\n---\n\n* The late learned Dr. Mill, Principal of Bishop's College, Calcutta.\n\u2020 Mr. A. Barth. (Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series.)\n\u2021 C.A.S. Journal 1846 (Reprint, 1861) pp. 17\u201462.\n\u00a7 C.A.S. Journal 1880, Part II, pp. 29\u201433.\nbelieving in astrology, and the other of the practice of conferring on individuals what are supposed to be lucky or auspicious names.\n\nMy special object however in the present note is to bring to light the true object of Mangalan Sutta, one of the most remarkable discourses of Buddha against \"superstition,\" which is found in two of the canonical Scriptures of Buddhism, namely in the Sutta Nipata and Khuddaka Pattha sections of the Khuddaka Pattha of the Sutta Pitaka.\n\nThere are three English translations extant of this discourse\u2014one by the late Rev. D. J. Gogerly, in the Ceylon Friend for June 1839, another by the late Professor R. C. Childers in his translation of the Khuddaka Pattha, and a third in the late Sir M. Coomara Swamy's translation of Sutta Nipata; but by an unhappy rendering of one expression by the learned translators, the true object of the discourse, namely, that of exposing the folly of believing in omens, has been completely kept out of view, and the discourse is simply regarded as a series of excellent moral maxims. Mr. Gogerly rendered the words \"etan mangalan uttaman,\" \"these are chief excellencies\": Mr. Childers, \"this is the greatest blessing\": this is also the rendering adopted by Sir M. Coomara Swamy.\n\nWhen Mr. Childers' able and lucid translation of Khuddaka Pattha appeared in 1874, I ventured to address a letter to that gentleman referring him to the Atthakatha or Commentary on the discourse, which explains its origin and objects, and submitting to him whether the words \"etan mangalan uttaman,\" which he has rendered \"this is the greatest blessing,\" should not be more correctly rendered \"this is the best omen,\" or \"these are the best omens.\" In reply he approved of my proposed rendering, but unfortunately having mislaid his letter, I am deprived of the gratification of producing it, but it will be seen that my late lamented friend has made the following note in the Addenda to his Pali Dictionary Vol. II. P. 617 s. v. \"'mangalo,' 'mangalan,' means also 'an omen.' I learn from Louis de Soysa that 'etan mangalan uttaman' should be rendered 'this is the best omen.'\"\nThe reasons which have induced me thus to render the words \"etan mangalan uttaman\" will be seen from the following condensed translation of the introduction of this discourse in the Commentary.\n\n\"What is the origin of mangalan suttan? It was the practice for people in Jambudipa to assemble at the gates of cities, in meeting houses and other places, and to hear the recital of various stories such as those of Sita, Bharata, &c. The people discussed various subjects at these meetings. Each discussion some time lasted for four months. On one occasion, the subject of discussion happened to be that of mangalan (happy or auspicious things i.e. good omens). What is a dittha mangalan (a good omen of sight)? What is a suta mangalan (a good omen of smell or taste or touch)? Do you know what a mangalan is?, said some of the audience present). One of them, a believer in omens of sight (dittha mangaliko), said, 'I know what a mangalan is. For example, a man rising up early in the morning sees a speaking bird,* tender fruits of the bilva tree (\u00c6gle marmelos), a pregnant woman, a child, an ornamented brimming jar, a fresh cyprinus fish, a thorough bred horse, or the likeness of one, a bull, a cow, a tawny coloured cow, or any other object of an auspicious nature,\u2014it is a mangalan.' Some of the audience accepted his theory, but those who did not entered into a dispute with him.\n\n\"A believer in omens of hearing (suta mangaliko) remarked that the eye sees what is pure and what is impure, what is good and what is bad, what is pleasant and what is unpleasant. If what is seen by the eye be a mangalan (good omen), then every object of sight must be one. What is seen therefore is not a mangalan: that which is deemed a true mangalan is that of hearing. If a man rising up early in the morning hears a sound such as 'it has prospered,' 'it is prospering,' 'it is full,' 'it is fresh,' 'it is delightful,' 'prosperity,' 'increase of prosperity' 'the lunar constellation,' 'to-day is auspicious,' 'a lucky moment,' a 'lucky day,' or any other pleasant sound deemed auspicious, this is said to be a mangalan.\n\n* Such as a parrot, mina, &c.\n\"Whereupon a believer in omens of smell, taste and touch, (muta mangaliko) addressed the meeting saying:\u2014'A man hears what is good and what is bad, what is pleasant and what is unpleasant; if what is heard by the ear be a mangalan, (good omen) then everything heard must be a good omen also. I say therefore that suta mangalan is not a true mangalan, and that the true mangalan is what is called muta mangalan. For example, if a man rising up early in the morning smells the fragrance of the lotus and other sweet smelling flowers, uses fresh dentrifice, touches the earth, or ripe corn, or fresh cow-dung, or a turtle, or a heap of sesamum seed, or flowers, or fruits, daubs (the floor) with fresh earth, puts on a new cloth, wears a new turban, or smells any other sweet smells, tastes or touches an object deemed auspicious\u2014it is a mangalan.'\n\n\"Thus men all over Jambudipa formed themselves into groups, and began to discuss what the real mangalani are. From men, their guardian deities, from them, their friends the terrestrial deities, from them, their friends the celestial deities, from them, their friends the deities of the Ch\u0101tummahar\u0101jika heavens, and from them, all the deities as far as Akanittha, the highest of the heavens, took up the subject of mangalan, and forming themselves into groups, began to discuss what mangalani are. Thus the discussion lasted for twelve years amongst men and gods. (except among the disciples of Buddha) throughout the ten thousand worlds of the universe, but they were unable to solve the problem. At last the gods of the T\u0101vati\u1e41sa heavens approached Sakko, and begged of him to declare what the mangalani are. The King of the gods enquired of them where the Supreme Buddha was then residing. Being told that he was then residing at J\u0113tavana Monastery in the city of S\u0101vatthi, he directed one of the gods to repair to him, and beg him to declare what mangalani are, and the god did so,\"\n\nThe sequel is told in the Sutta itself, and now I have the pleasure to reproduce Mr. Childer's masterly version of Mangala Sutta, only substituting the expression 'this is the best omen,' for 'this is the greatest blessing.'\n\"Thus I have heard. On a certain day dwelt Buddha at \u015ar\u0101vasti, at the J\u0113tavana Monastery, in the garden of An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0daka. And when the night was far advanced a certain radiant celestial being, illuminating the whole of J\u0113tavana, approached the blessed one, and saluted him and stood aside. And standing aside addressed him with this verse:\n\n'Many gods and men, yearning after good, have held divers things to be blessings (good omens); say thou, what is the greatest blessing (the best omen or the best omens)?\n\nBuddha:\u2014'To serve wise men and not serve fools, to give honour to whom honour is due, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To dwell in a pleasant land, to have done good deeds in a former existence, to have a soul filled with right desires, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Much knowledge and much science, the discipline of a well trained mind, and a word well spoken, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To succour father and mother, to cherish wife and child, to follow a peaceful calling, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To give alms, to live religiously, to give help to relatives, to do blameless deeds, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To cease and abstain from sin, to eschew strong drink, to be diligent in good deeds, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Reverence and lowliness, contentment and gratitude, to receive religious teaching at due seasons, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To be long-suffering and meek, to associate with the priests of Buddha, to hold religious discourse at due seasons, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Temperance and chastity, discernment of the four great truths, the prospect of Nirv\u0101na, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\"\n'The soul of one unshaken by the changes of this life, a soul inaccessible to sorrow, passionless, secure, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'They that do these things are invincible on every side, on every side they walk in safety, yea, theirs is the greatest blessing, (theirs are the best omens).'\n\nIt may be remarked, how could such distinguished scholars as Gogerly and Childers have committed such a mistake as the one referred to? The matter is easily explained. They have evidently translated the word *mangalan* in its ordinary sense,* without referring to the commentary which explains the special sense in which the word is used in this discourse. This is not to be wondered at, seeing that even some of the learned Buddhist Priests of the present day commit the same mistake and interpret the discourse simply as a series of moral maxims. Strangely enough, this discourse is used by Buddhists even for purposes of superstition, such as, exorcism, etc. It is so used by the Kandyan Buddhists according to Mr. C. J. R. LeMesurier, c.c.s., who, by the way, calls it \"the Sutra of Festivals\" which might lead one to suppose that it has some connection with the various Kandyan Hind\u00fa Festivals, which he describes in his account of \"The Principal Religious Ceremonies observed by the Kandyans of Ceylon.\"\u2020\n\nIt is only when this discourse is viewed by the light thrown on it by the commentary, that it appears in its true character, as one of the most powerful exposures of Hind\u00fa superstition on record.\n\n---\n\n*Mangalo* (adj.)

Lewis, Esq.\n\n(Read, November 2nd, 1882.)\n\nNo naturalist, or more probably, no ornithologist has ever looked upon a feather without admiring its beautiful structure, and admirable adaptation of ends to means. Here will be found a maximum of strength in a minimum of weight; adapted alike, as an organ of flight, or as a means of warmth to the creature that supports this exquisite structure. Colored in some instances only as a means of attraction, or, in others, as one of protection, and yet withal, light as proverbially, 'as a feather.'\n\nIn variety of external form, we have many, even in Ceylon birds, though of course, if the examples of variation of pattern, from all parts of the world were tabulated, a long and interesting list could be made, were such necessary. My object in the present Paper is of a further character, and one which requires a deeper investigation than that of a mere comparison of external shapes and forms.\n\nA feather may not inaptly be likened to a cocoanut leaf or branch, as it is sometimes called. There is the shaft or quill, and from it diverge other shafts which form the webs. If a breast feather be pulled from some well-known bird, say a Woodpecker, we observe in the lower, or basal region, that the quill supports a shaft, or, as I shall call it, a web-shaft Fig. 1 (bb); which, in turn, towards the lower half of the feather bears a fine thread like process, say one-tenth of an inch long, which I shall call the sub-web-shaft Fig. 1 (ccc). In the upper or exposed part of the feather, this sub-web-shaft is absent, leaving the conclusion that these fine filaments are for the purpose of warmth\u2014a con-\nPlate I.\n\nNo 1\n\nShewing (a) the quill; (b) the web shafts;\nand (c c c) the sub web shafts much enlarged:\nso as to shew clearly the portions in question.\n\nNo 2\nSub web shaft of simple order\n\u00d7500\n\nNo 3\nSub web shaft of the telescopic order\n\u00d7500\n\nNo 4\n\u00d7500\n\nLITHOGRAPHED AT THE S.G OFFICE, COLOMBO.\nPlate II.\n\nN\u00b0 5\nOf the partially spinous order\n\u00d7 500.\n\nN\u00b0 6\nOf the highly spinous order\n\u00d7 500.\n\nN\u00b0 7\nThe probable aboriginal form\n\nN\u00b0 8\n\nLITHOGRAPHED AT THE S.

Supposing a web shaft is removed from the same feather\u2014Woodpecker's\u2014and placed under a microscope of some power, the sub-web-shafts exhibit a series of joint-like markings of a more or less modified character. See Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, & 6.\n\nThis modification is of very considerable interest, as the conclusion that I have arrived at, after carefully examining a large series of Ceylon birds, is, that they are modifications of an aboriginal form, which I have ventured to illustrate.\n\nI have drawn my conclusions from the fact, that at remote periods of time, it is but reasonable to conclude, that birds required a closer plumage than at present, in order to endure a colder temperature than now upon the earth, and to bring about that end a further addition to the sub-web-shaft would render most material assistance. I am confirmed in this view by the fact that some of our high flying eagles, such as Spizaetus, possess a spine upon the sub-web-shaft, that can be considered as a modified filamentous process, just as the sub-web-shaft is itself.\n\nThe conclusion then to be drawn is that those representing the series Fig. 2, are of a much older formation than the series Fig. 4 through process of modification, through disuse. In like manner the forms up to Fig. 6 can be traced up to what was probably the aboriginal form, Fig. 7. I am inclined to believe that any of the forms may be traced through variation and modification to the form Fig. 7, which through long ages of disuse forms the present modified structure. If then, this view be correct\u2014and I am unable to see cause for any serious objection to it\u2014the course of modification may be traced as represented in Fig. 8, from the aboriginal form to the present, as shewed by the dark lines, and the dotted lines, which bear a strong comparison with Fig. 7, or with Fig. 6, which last is an existing form.\n\nI consider that by this peculiarity of structure we shall be able to trace the relative ages of existing forms of birds, which\nin itself may be considered as a means of classification, if such there be. Unfortunately, I have not had the good fortune to be able to examine the plumage of birds from other countries, more especially those from the colder climates of the extreme north which would give evidence either in support, or to the contrary of my theory. For the present, I venture the subject more as a question, than as an established fact, though the evidence from local examples tends greatly to prove the force of my theory.\n\nClimatic effects may probably bear with more or less weight upon the point, but I find the conclusion is still irresistible that each existing form can be traced to a higher, which we may call the aboriginal parent, and its necessity is just the same, in a larger measure, as that which supplies the present sub-web-shaft. Where warmth is unnecessary, then sub-web-shafts do not exist, as for instance in the tail feathers, or feathers beyond the body, and by analogy, where greater warmth is required, then the additional process would exist, which through non-necessity is now reduced to a simple, or at most a spinous joint.\nSINHALESE FOLK-LORE STORIES.\n\nBY W. KNIGHT JAMES, F.R.G.S., F.R. Hist., S.\n\n(Read, November 2nd, 1882.)\n\nThe Sinhalese are essentially a social people. Some of the most important traits of their character are, deep attachment to friends, filial obedience, and love of their homes and villages. There are a few greater hardships which a Sinhalese can be called upon to undergo than separation from the home and friends of his childhood, and there are few dearer reminiscences to him, wherever he may be in after life, than those which recall the early days spent in his native village. Home stories and sayings exercise no little influence on him, and at any rate in the leisure portion of the life of the villager oral stories take an important place, whether they be the J\u0101taka stories of the various births of Buddha,\n\n\"The preternatural tale,\n\"Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends,\"\n\nor the more modest stories that relate the doings of the people. In the Sinhalese home it is true that the \"fireside\" with which we connect the story-telling of harsher climes is absent, but it finds its representative in the little verandah or in the roadside, and often when the family have retired to rest for the night in the single room and verandah which generally form the \"house\" of the Sinhalese cultivator, one member, frequently the grandfather relates stories to the others until he finds that the \"dull god\" has drawn away his audience. In the night as two or three villagers sit guarding the ripening grain of their paddy fields from the inroads of elephant, buffalo or boar, stories serve to wile away what would be otherwise a weary vigil, and on numerous other common-place occasions story-telling plays an important part. Some of these stories throw considerable light\non the modes of thought, manners, and customs of the people, and also may perhaps be of some value in comparative folklore, I therefore give translations of a few of these village stories.\n\nI.\u2014The Trial at Avich\u00e1ra-pura.*\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Badulla there is among the Sinhalese a saying, when justice appears to have miscarried:\n\n\"Avich\u00e1ra-pur\u00e9 na\u1e0duwa w\u00e1geyi,\"\u2014\"Like the trial at Avich\u00e1rapura.\"\n\nThe story on which the saying is founded is without doubt of considerable age and contains rich satire:\n\nOne night some thieves broke into the house of a rich man and carried away all his valuables. The man complained to the Justice of the Peace, who had the robbers captured, and when brought before him enquired of them whether they had anything to say in their defence. \"Sir,\" said they, \"we are not to blame in this matter: the robbery was entirely due to the mason who built the house; for the walls were so badly made, and gave way so easily, that we were quite unable to resist the temptation of breaking in.\" Orders were then given to bring the mason to the Court-house. On his arrival he was informed of the charge brought against him. \"Ah,\" said he, \"the fault is not mine, but that of my cooly, who made mortar badly.\" When the cooly was brought he laid the blame on the potter whom he said had sold him a cracked chatty, in which he could not carry sufficient water to mix the mortar properly. Then the potter was brought before the judge, and he explained that the blame should not be laid upon him, but upon a very pretty woman who in a beautiful dress was passing his house at the time he was making the chatty, and had so riveted his attention that he forgot all about the work. When the woman appeared, she protested that the fault was not hers, for she would not have been in that neighbourhood at all had the goldsmith sent home her earrings at the proper time; the charge she urged should properly be brought against him.\n\n* A, 'without'; vich\u00e1ra, 'enquiry'; pura, 'city.'\nThe goldsmith was brought and as he was unable to offer any reasonable excuse, he was condemned to be hanged. Those in the Court however begged the Judge to spare the goldsmith's life; \"for,\" said they, \"he is very sick and ill-favoured and would not make at all a pretty spectacle\"; \"but,\" said the judge, \"somebody must be hanged.\" Then they drew the attention of the Court to the fact that there was a fat Moorman in a shop opposite who was a much fitter subject for an execution, and asked that he might be hanged in the goldsmith's stead. The learned Judge, considering that this arrangement would be very satisfactory, gave judgment accordingly.\n\nII.\u2014The Goldsmith Who Cheated His Mother.\n\nOf all workmen the Sinhalese regard the native goldsmith with the greatest suspicion. This is due no doubt to the fact that, whenever opportunity occurs, he appropriates a portion of the precious metal entrusted to him, often substituting for it that of a baser kind. There are many sayings in the language to the effect that 'whoever else is to be trusted, a goldsmith is not'; and there is a popular belief that 'a goldsmith would cheat his own mother', in illustration of which the following story is told:\n\nA certain woman possessed a large piece of gold made up in the form of a frog,* which had been a heir-loom in her family for many years. She, though wishing to keep the metal, was anxious to have it made up in the form of ornaments, which she could wear and display before her friends. She was afraid to take it to a goldsmith, for she knew that they all had the reputation of being rogues, and that she would most likely be cheated. It, therefore, occurred to her that the safest way would be to have her son apprenticed to the trade: this she accordingly did. When he had learned it sufficiently well, she took the golden frog to him and requested him to make it into the ornaments she required. The cunning fellow first obtained a live frog and placed it among the ashes of his fireplace, and then, whilst his mother stood by, took the golden\n\n* S. Gemadiya.\none, put it among the ashes also, and commenced to blow the fire to melt it down. The live-frog feeling uncomfortable in the heat immediately jumped out and hopped away. \"See, dear mother\", said he, \"your frog is gone. How can you expect me to make ornaments from a living thing?\" \"Oh, my dear son\", said the mother, \"what is worse than bad fortune? My lump of gold has turned into a lump of flesh.\"\n\nIII.\u2014A Story of Two Rogues.\n\nThere are several stories which relate to the sharp-wittedness of people from different villages, towns, or districts, and which, seem to imply much the same as is expressed in our English proverb \"set a thief to catch a thief.\" The following is well-known, and, although the story varies somewhat in different localities, is in substance the same. The names given to the two rogues vary with the place where it is told, but they are, as far as I have heard, always the names of different villages, or districts, with the affix y\u00e1 or w\u00e1 thus Gampolay\u00e1 and Rayigamay\u00e1, 'a Gampola man' and 'Rayigama man'; Migamiw\u00e1 and M\u00e1taray\u00e1, 'a Negombo man' and 'M\u00e1tara man':\n\nTwo men who lived in different districts, and who depended principally on their wits for a livelihood, started off one day about the same time each to pay a visit to the other. On their way they met, and agreed to go together in search of adventure. As they went on they heard the sound of weeping at a certain house and, finding the friends of a dead man mourning for him, they went and joined in the lamentations. When the question of the division of the deceased's property arose, they put in their claim. \"Who are you?\", the people asked, \"and what right have you to any of the property?\" \"Was not this our own poor old grandfather whom we have not seen for these many years?\", said the men weeping. The friends at the house were so affected by the grief of the strangers, that they agreed to go that evening to the grave of the dead man, and see if he would express any wish in the matter. One of the rogues slipped out unobserved and laid himself beside the grave. \"Is it your will that these two\nstrange persons should have any share in your property?\u201d, asked one. \u201cYou are all my children: divide it amongst you fairly\u201d, came in sepulchral tones from the grave. Having received a box containing some valuable articles, they started off, and after journeying for some time lay down to rest near the sea-shore, placing the box between them. One, finding the other asleep shortly afterwards, took the box, and, going into the sea as high as the armpits, buried it in the sand; then going back again to his place fell asleep. Soon afterwards the second man awoke, and, finding his neighbour asleep and the box gone, guessed what had been done with it. He therefore commenced to lick along the whole length of his body, and, finding the taste of salt did not go above his armpits, knew the depth where it was buried. Having discovered the box, he carried it away, and hid himself in one of a number of ricks of straw that were standing a short distance off. On the other man awakening, he knew that his friend had discovered the treasure and made off with it, but, as had not had time to escape far, he thought that he was most likely hiding in one of the heaps of straw hard by. Tying a sokada (wooden bullock bell) round his neck he went on his hands and knees knocking his head against each of the ricks. The man who was hiding hearing the noise and thinking it was a buffalo, shouted out \u201cJah! jah! kotiy\u00e1 k\u00e1*!\u201d and so was discovered. After this, it is said, they divided the spoil equally.\n\nIV.\u2014How the Tumpan\u00e9 Folk went a-Bees\u2019 Nesting.\n\nAmong the folk stories of the Sinhalese there are a large number which relate to simpletons,\u2014a class of stories which we find in most countries. The following bears some resemblance to the story of the Wise Men of Gotham, who, seeing the reflection of the full moon in the river Trent as they passed over, and thinking it to be a cheese lying at the bottom, lowered one of their number with a rope to reach it.\n\nOne day a man in Tumpan\u00e9 (a district renowned for its foolish people) wanted some honey for his daughter who was\n\n* An imprecation, lit. \u201cMay a tiger eat you!\u201d\nvery sick: so he got his friends to assist him, and they started off to the forest in order to find a bees' nest. As they were passing by a deep pond, they beheld the reflection of one which was suspended on an overhanging tree. Having tried vainly to grasp the nest in the water, they thought that it must be deeper down than they supposed, and one of their number was, therefore, sent in. Believing, as he was unable to touch it, that he could not get down far enough, they tied a large stone round his neck. The other fools stood by the whole day waiting for the man to come up with the honey.\n\nV.\u2014How a Tumpan\u00e9 Man cured his Mother.\n\nOnce upon a time a half-witted villager bought a bullock to use in his hackery, and, as he took it away, the dealer (a philosopher in his way) repeated to him this proverb:\n\n\"Harak diya-badu w\u00e1ge,\" lit. \"cattle are like watery things,\" (that is, they are perishable, and consequently require a great deal of care and attention). The man, however, took the saying literally, and, noticing water coming from the bullock as it went along, thought that it had already commenced to dissolve. He was now very anxious to dispose of his bullock before the process went farther, and a man happening to be passing with a ketta (bill-hook) in his hand, the owner of the bullock asked 'what the ketta would do': \"fell jungle\", said the man. It was then agreed that an exchange should be made of the bullock for the ketta. The half-witted fellow took the axe, and going to some jungle land which belonged to him, placed it upon a stone and went away. Some time afterwards he returned to see how much jungle it had felled, but was surprised to find that it had not cut even a single tree. When he picked it up he found the iron was quite warm, and concluded that it had not been able to work that day as it was suffering from fever. He, therefore, went to the doctor, who, knowing how foolish the man was, appeased him by telling him to bury it in a cool spot until the morning and he would then find the fever gone. The man did as he was told, and found his ketta quite cool. Next day, however, his mother had a severe attack of fever, and, remembering\nthe medicine that had cured his ketta, he took the poor old woman to the same spot, and making a bigger hole carefully covered her up.\n\nVI.\u2014Hunting a Palm-Cat.\n\nA long time ago there lived in Tumpan\u00e9 a newly married couple. One evening as the wife was commencing to prepare her husband's dinner she heard the cry of a kalavedd\u00e1 (palm-cat) in a tree near the house, and, thinking if she could manage to catch it she might surprise her husband with a good meat curry, went out with the dog, saying \"usi, usi,\" (urging on the dog). The dog ran to the foot of the tree barking and placed his forefeet on the trunk. She, thinking that he was trying to climb it, began to make him a valalla (a ring put round the ankles when climbing a tree). Just at that time the husband returned, and seeing what she was doing chid her for her foolishness, saying that 'he would shew her the way to get the dog up the tree.' Procuring a long stake he sharpened one end of it and sticking it into the dog hoisted him up to where the palm-cat was. The poor animal in agony whined b\u00e9! b\u00e9! \"Say not b\u00e9! b\u00e9! (I cannot, I cannot)\" said the man \"but lay hold of the palm-cat!\"\nRUINS AT VEHERAGALA.*\n\nThe ruins in question are known as \"Veheragala\" and are situated about two miles South of the 10th mile-post on the Anur\u00e1dhapura road.\n\nThey consist for the most part of groups of stone pillars more or less roughly squared, and are probably the remains of palaces and Vih\u00e1r\u00e9s. The jungle is, however, so thick, and the ruins are so overgrown, that it is difficult to conjecture, from their formation, to what period they belong.\n\nThe only really interesting ruin which has so far been discovered, is that of an oval building, found upon a rocky mound, and the base of which is constructed of huge slabs of stone, (the shape of which is very peculiar) laid upon oblong blocks. They are cut into segments of a circle, each segment being 8 ft. to 12 ft. by 7 ft. \u00d7 7 in. or 8 in. thick. These slabs are also concave on the upper side and convex on the lower, but whether this was intentional, or the result of being wedged out of laminated rock\u2014with which the neighbourhood abounds,\u2014is not apparent. Another curious feature of the building is, that the oblong blocks upon which these slabs are laid, (and which seem to have formed the foundations) built upon the solid rock were morticed together, the sockets and notches being very distinct. The building faces North, on which side there is a flight of stone steps leading to the entrance, and its dimensions are, from North to South 56 feet, and from East to West 78 feet.\n\nIf this structure was intended for a Tope or D\u00e1gaba\u2014which, considering that it was not circular, is, I think, unlikely\u2014it was never completed, and appears to have been temporarily used for some other purpose; for at the South end there are five spur stones, arranged in a curve, and upon which pillars must have\n\n* Extract from letter dated September 25th, 1882, from P.

As there are no remains of these pillars to be seen they were probably made of wood; and the debris of earth, bricks and tiles, which fill up the space inside the stone work, shows that a building of not very permanent character did exist at sometime.\n\nOn the slab rock near the flight of steps is an inscription, much of which was buried in earth. It is of the roughest kind and very difficult to copy in consequence. I have, however, had a copy made of it by Mr. F. Navaratna which I annex. The characters are not D\u00e9wan\u00e1gar\u00ed, though some of them bear some resemblance thereto.\n\nI annex tracing of a ground plan, sketched by Mr. C. T. D. Vigors, c.c.s., which gives the exact dimensions of the slabs forming the ring, and a very good idea of the elevation on the east side. A sketch is also annexed which I made from the top of a rock overlooking the building on the west side. This shows the peculiar shape of the slabs and the notches and sockets in the foundation blocks.*\n\n* The ground plan and inscription are here reproduced.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nTHE CONNECTION OF THE SINHALESE WITH THE MODERN \u00c1RYAN VERNACULARS OF INDIA.\n\nBy W. P. Ra\u1e47asinha, Esq.\n\nIs Sinhalese to be placed under the Turanian family of languages with Tamil, Telugu, &c., or under the Indo-Germanic family, along with Hindi, Bengali, Panjabi, Sindhi, Marathi, Gujarathi, Nepali, Oriya, Assamese, and Kashmiri?\n\nThe Turanian family of languages has not got beyond the collocational or syntactical and agglutinated stages, whilst the Sinhalese has not only reached the inflectional stage, like Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, but has also advanced to the analytical, like the English, French, &c.: examples are karayi, \"he does\"; yayi, \"he goes\"; deyi, \"he gives,\" &c. Here we find the stems kara, ya, and de, which are derived from the Sanskrit roots kri, y\u00e1, and d\u00e1, with an inflection yi. This yi is again divisible into two parts y, i. The y, i, is merely an augment adopted for the purpose of avoiding the hiatus which would otherwise occur if after the stem the i, were pronounced alone. The i, here is the remnant of ti, in the Sanskrit verbs karoti, \"he does\"; bharati, \"he bears,\" &c. Mr. Beames points out that ti, is equal to the English s in \"he bears, &c.\" In Greek \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af, he says, we have i equal to the English pronoun \"he.\" In Latin fert the i is lost and t alone remains. In Gothic baireth we have th; here too the i is lost. In English \"beareth\" the i is lost, and the th alone remains. The English th and the Sinhalese i are parts of the same termination ti. This th in English, he points out, is still further modified in the modern language into s as in \"bears,\" \"fears,\" &c. So the English s and the Sinhalese i, in the third person singular number present tense of the indicative mood, can be traced to the \u00c1ryan ti,\u2014the English taking the first part of the termination and further modifying\nit into s, the Sinhalese rejecting the first part, and taking the vowel alone, and inserting a \u03c9, y, to avoid the hiatus.\n\nThe \u03c9, y, in \u03c9\u03c9\u03b2, karayi, &c., is an augment and not a substitute for \u03c9\u03bd, t. We have in \u03c9\u03c9\u03b2, ker\u00e9, \u03c9\u03b2, y\u00e9, and \u03c9\u03be, \u1f26, other forms of the above verbs, meaning \u201che does,\u201d \u201che goes\u201d and \u201che gives.\u201d Here we find the \u03c9, i, without the \u03c9, y. By the rule of sandhi adigecornuvri, the vowel \u03c9, i, following the \u03c9, a, in \u03c9\u03b1, kara, \u03c9\u03b1+\u03c9+\u03b1, kar+a+i, becomes \u03c9, e, that is to say, both the \u03c9, a, and \u03c9, i, are lost, and \u03c9, e, is substituted in their place; hence the word \u03c9\u03c9\u03b2, kare, and by the force of the vowel \u03c9, e, in \u03c9\u03be, r\u00e9, the word becomes \u03c9\u03c9\u03be, ker\u00e9, \u201che does\u201d; similarly \u03c9+\u03c9+\u03b1, y+a+i, becomes \u03c9\u03b2, y\u00e9, \u201che goes\u201d; and \u03c9\u03be+\u03c9+\u03b1, d+a+i, becomes \u03c9\u03be, de, \u201che gives.\u201d\n\nNow, although we never write \u03c9\u03c9\u03b2, karai, \u03c9\u03b2, yai, and dei, but \u03c9\u03c9\u03b2, karayi, \u03c9\u03b2, yai, and \u03c9\u03be\u03b2, deyi, yet they are pronounced \u03c9\u03c9\u03b2, karai, \u03c9\u03b2, yai, and \u03c9\u03be\u03b2, dei, as if they had been written so. This also is proof that the \u03c9, y, is merely an augment.\n\nIn the book language we have the following terminations:\n\n| Singular | Future |\n|----------|--------|\n| Present  |        |\n| 1. \u03c9\u03b2,   | \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, |\n| karami,  | karanemi, |\n| \u201cI do.\u201d  | \u201cI will do.\u201d |\n| 2. \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, | \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, |\n| kerehi,  | karannehi, |\n| \u201cYou do.\u201d| \u201cYou will do.\u201d|\n| 3. \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, | \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, |\n| ker\u00e9,    | karann\u00e9, |\n| \u201cHe does.\u201d| \u201cHe will do.\u201d|\n\nPast\n\n1. \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, halemi, \u201cI did.\u201d\n2. \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, helehi, \u201cYou did.\u201d\n3. \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, kel\u00e9, \u201cHe did.\u201d\n\nBut in the spoken language these perhaps were found to be a great encumberance, and a form \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, karaaw\u00e1, has come to be used in the present and future tenses without any distinction as to number or person: and it is now necessary to say \u03c9\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, mama karaaw\u00e1, \u201cI do;\u201d \u03c9\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, \u03c9\u03b2 karaaw\u00e1, \u201che does;\u201d \u03c9\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, mama het\u00e1 karaaw\u00e1, \u201cI will do to-morrow.\u201d Sometimes \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, kar\u00e1vi, and \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2 \u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\u03b2, karaaw\u00e1 eti, are used.

This too having no inflections to show\nthe number or person, the pronouns have to be prefixed:\u2014\u0db8\u0db8\n\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd, mama ka\u1e37a, \u201cI did\u201d; \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd, api ka\u1e37a, \u201cwe did\u201d;\n\u0dc4\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd, u ka\u1e37a, \u201che did,\u201d &c. We have here both the inflec-\ntional and analytical stages. Thus by classification Sinhalese\nmust be grouped under the Indo-Germanic family. \u201cBut,\u201d it\nis said \u201cclassification is not in itself sufficient for purposes of\nanalysis.\u201d Let us therefore, look for other peculiarities. In\nthe Turanian group, it is said that nouns are not distinct from\nverbs. In Sinhalese they are: \u0d9a\u0dbb, kara, \u0dba, ya, \u0daf, de, \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0da7,\nsit\u012b, &c.,\u2014are always verbs and never nouns; nor could a noun\nbe converted into a verb except by the addition of a verb, as\n\u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dd3, pelakarami, \u201cI grow\u201d; \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dc0\u0dda, diyaveyi, \u201cit be-\ncomes liquid\u201d; \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dd3, diyakarami, \u201cI liquify.\u201d\n\nAnother characteristic of the Aryan language, says Mr.\nBeames, is \u201cthat the noun possesses three numbers, singular,\ndual and plural; and numerous cases each distinguished by a\npeculiar and inseparable termination.\u201d\n\nWe have in Sinhalese only the singular and the plural\nnumbers, the dual is lost, as in English. The case endings are\ninseparable, that is to say, if separated from the stem, as \u0db8, ta,\nin \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad, ma\u1e6da, \u201cto me,\u201d they have no meaning in themselves, and\nhere the \u0db8, ta, when separated has no meaning in itself.\n\nWe have the following terminations in nouns:\n\n**Masculine**\n\n\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, m\u0101\u1e6da, \u201cMan.\u201d\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nom. \u0db8, m | \u0db8\u0dd4, mu |\n| Acc. \u0db8, m | \u0db8\u0dd4, mu |\n| Inst. \u0db8 (\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd2), m (min\u012b) | \u0db8\u0dd4 (\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd2), mu (min\u012b) |\n| Aux. | |\n| Dat. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad, ma\u1e6da | \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da |\n| Abl. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da | \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da |\n| Gen. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da | \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da |\n| Loc. | |\n| Voc. \u0db8, m | \u0db8\u0dd4, mu |\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nom. \u0db8, m | \u0db8\u0dd4, mu |\n| Acc. \u0db8, m | \u0db8\u0dd4, mu |\n| Inst. \u0db8 (\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd2), m (min\u012b) | \u0db8\u0dd4 (\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd2), mu (min\u012b) |\n| Aux. | |\n| Dat. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad, ma\u1e6da | \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da |\n| Abl. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da | \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da |\n| Gen. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da | \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca, ma\u1e6da |\n| Loc. | |\n| Voc. \u0db8, m | \u0db8\u0dd4, mu |\nFeminine,\n\u0d9c\u0dda g\u0113ni, \"Woman.\"\n\nSing. | Plur.\n---|---\nNom. | \u0db8, \u0db8, u, \u00f3\nAcc. | \u0db8, \u0db8, un, an\nInst. | \u0db8, \u0db8, un, an\nAux. |\nDat. | \u0db8, ta\nAbl. | \u0db8, gen\nGen. | \u0db8, g\u00e9\nLoc. |\nVoc. | \u0db8, a\n\nNeuter\n\u0d9c\u0dc3, gas, \"Tree.\"\n\nSingular | Plural\n---|---\nNom. | \u0d85, a\nAcc. | \u0d85, a\nInst. |\nAux. | \u0d85, en\nDat. | \u0d85, ata\nAbl. | \u0d85, en\nGen. |\nLoc. | \u0d85, \u00e9\nVoc. | \u0d85, d\n\nThe verb has three forms for the three persons and no forms for the three genders. Thus:\u2014\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8 \u0dba\u0dd9, \u00fa y\u00e9, \"he goes\" \u0d91\u0db8 \u0dba\u0dd9, \u00e9 y\u00e9, \"she goes\"; \u0db8\u0dd3\u0db8 \u0dba\u0dd9, neva y\u00e9, \"the ship goes.\"\n\n\"In the \u00c1ryan languages the personal terminations of the verb are abraded pronouns, or rather pronominal types.\" So are they in Sinhalese.\n\nIn Pr\u00e1krit the terminations are:\n\nPresent Tense.\n\nSingular.\n1. \u0db8, mi as \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd2, hasami, \"I smile\"\n2. \u0db8, si as \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd3, hasasi, \"You smile\"\n3. \u0db8, i as \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd3, hasai, \"He smiles\"\n\nPlural.\n1. \u0db8, \u0db8 mo, mu, as \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd2, hasimo, hasimu, \"We smile\"\n2. \u0db8, ha, as \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd3, hasaha, \"Ye smile\"\n3. \u0db8, anti, as \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dd3, hasanti, \"They smile\"\nThe terminations of the future tense are the same, with \u0950, *issa*, prefixed to them.\n\n\"Another striking characteristic of this family,\" says Mr. Beames, \"is its power of expressing complicated ideas or strings of ideas by compounds. Several words are joined together, and the case and tense-endings are added to the last word only, the first member of the compound being either a preposition or a noun, or even a verb. This power is not possessed by other families.\" This power the Sinhalese language possesses in a preeminent degree, \u092c\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u0926\u093f\u0924\u093f, *Bamba sura nar\u00f3 namadit*, given in the *Sidat Sangar\u00e1* is a familiar example.\n\nI have here attempted to shew that most of the characteristics of the \u00c1ryan languages do also apply to the modern Sinhalese.\n\nThe following languages, as was said before, belong to the Indic class of the Indo-Germanic family, Hind\u00ed, Beng\u00e1li, Panj\u00e1b\u00ed, Sindh\u00ed, Marath\u00ed, Gujarath\u00ed, Oriya, and Kashmir\u00ed. Following Mr. Beames' excellent work on the Philology of these languages I shall endeavour to shew the connection of Sinhalese with this family.\n\nThe numerals, says Mr. Beames, are those parts of speech which retain their forms with the greatest tenacity, and offer the most obvious similarities. Let us compare the Sinhalese with the Indian vernacular numerals.\n| Sanskrit | P\u0101li | Pr\u0101krit | Hindi | Panjabi | Sindhi | Gujar\u0101th\u012b | Mar\u0101th\u012b | Oriya |

exception of the changes peculiar to the language.\n\nIn the Maldivian language the numerals are almost the same as in the Sinhalese. The difference, as far as I am aware, is that the progression in that language is by duodecimals instead of decimals. They are eken, den, tinen, hataren, pahen, hayen, hatey, aren, nuven, dihen, ekolahen, dolahen. Here they stop and for thirteen they have dolos eken, which means \"twelve + one.\" This is continued up to \"twenty-three\" which is dolos ekolos, and twenty-four is passihi: now passihi is evidently the same as the Sinhalese \u0db4\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd3, paswisi, which means \"twenty-five.\" They proceed on with passihi eken, passihi den, &c., and their \"thirty-six\" is tindolos, (i.e., three twelves.) Their \"forty-eight\" is panas, which is the Sinhalese for \"fifty;\" their \"sixty\" is pasdolos, (i.e., five twelves); \"eighty-four\" is hayidolos, (i.e., seven twelves; \"ninety six\" is hiya, which is the same as the Sinhalese \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba, siya, \"hundred.\" The real \"hundred,\" however, they call sata, which is the P\u0101li form of the Sanskrit \u0dc3\u0dad, sata, from which the Sinhalese \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba, siya, is derived through the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit saya, as we have seen.*\n\nIn the Dravidian group the Telugu and the Tamil, I believe, stand foremost.

By reducing the \u1e63, s, into \u1e6d, h, and dropping it altogether, the \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e, jj\u00e1, is reduced to \u1e0da, da, and to compensate for the loss of the conjunct consonant, the vowel \u090f, e, is substituted. This is more apparent when we compare the Sinhalese \u090f\u0902\u0921\u093e, enda, with the old Hind\u00ed sajy\u00e1\u2014the modern Hind\u00ed, Panj\u00e1b\u00ed, and Sindh\u00ed being sej.\n\nIn Pr\u00e1krit, which, as Professor Max M\u00fcller says, is the basis of all the \u00c1ryan vernaculars of India, consonants are dropped in the middle of words; as visai for vinsati, twenty. In Sinhalese the hiatus is always avoided by the coalition of the letters or by the insertion of the semivowels \u1e63, ya, or \u1e0d, va, and sometimes \u1e0d, ra; \u0930\u093e\u0924\u0928\u093e, ratana, \"cubit,\" Sinhalese \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093e, riyana; \u0915\u0925\u092f\u0924\u093f, kathayati, \"he says,\" Sinhalese \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0908, kiyayi.\n\nWe could never have such a combination of letters as the Pr\u00e1krit janava\u0101, for the Sanskrit \u091c\u0928\u092a\u0926, janapada, \"community;\" the Sinhalese word is \u0926\u093e\u0928\u0935\u093e, danavva.\n\nThese are the main features of the language.

O. id.; Sin. \u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924, ata.\n\nThe following rules may be deduced from the above and other peculiarities of the language.\n\n1. That pure Sinhalese retains all the Sanskrit vowels except \u0930\u093f, ri, \u0932\u094d\u0930\u093f, lri, \u090f, ai, \u0913, au: ri becomes either \u090f, a, \u0913, i, or \u090f, u, or \u090f, uri, sometimes \u090f, ru; as \u0924\u092a\u093e, \"grass,\" for\ntrina, idu, \"straight,\" for riju, utu, \"season,\" for ritu, rusi, for rishi.\n\n2. ai, becomes e, as hela, \"mount,\" for saila.\n\n3. au, becomes o, as sonduru, saundaryya, \"comely.\"\n\n4. A long vowel is generally shortened as ek, \"one,\" for eka; solos, \"sixteen,\" for s\u00f3dasa; maga, \"road\" for marga; isuru, \"lord\" for \u012b\u015bvara.\n\n5. The dental sibilent s, represents the palatal and the lingual; as visi, \"twenty,\" for vi\u1e63ati; seta, \"sixty,\" for shashti; sa, \"six\" for shash.\n\n6. Aspirated consonants are reduced to their unaspirated sounds, sometimes with h, to compensate for the loss of the aspirate; as bima, \"land,\" for bhumi; vidi, \"manner,\" for vidhi; dehena, \"religious meditation,\" for dhy\u0101na.\n\n7. cha, is changed either to sa, or da, sometimes to ta; as satara, \"four\" for chatur; pas, \"five\" for pa\u00f1cha; goduru, \"an object of sense\", for g\u014dchara; tudus, \"fourteen,\" for chaturda\u015ba. The change of cha, to sa, is not peculiar to the Sinhalese alone: it is a feature of the Bengali and Marathi too. Mr. Beames says, \"In Eastern Bengal, where the pronunciation reaches the utmost limits of corruption, chha is regularly sounded as s, and in that dialect of Bengal spoken in Assam, not only has the s sound driven out the chha but also has in many cases still further passed into h.\" So it is in Sinhalese; sanda, \"moon,\" from Sanskrit chandra, is reduced to handa; pa\u00f1cha, \"five\" is pasa, and reduced further into paha; dasa, \"ten\" becomes daha. This ha is sometimes still further reduced in Sinhalese, by dropping it altogether and retaining only its inherent\nvowel, e.g., Sanskrit, \u0936\u092f\u094d\u092f\u093e, sayy\u0101, \"bed\"; Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, sejj\u0101; Sinhalese, \u1e63e\u1e47\u1e0da, the first form of which seems to have been \u1e63e\u1e6d\u1e6da, \u1e63e\u1e47\u1e0da, then \u1e63e\u1e6d\u1e6da, \u1e63e\u1e47\u1e0da, and now \u1e63e\u1e6d\u1e6da, \u1e63e\u1e47\u1e0da.\n\n8. \u091c\u093e, ja, is often changed to \u0926\u093e, da; as \u0932\u093e\u091c\u093e, laja, \"parched grain,\" Sinhalese, \u1e0da\u1e37a; \u091c\u093e\u0932\u093e, j\u00e1la, \"net,\" Sinhalese, \u1e0da\u1e37a.\n\n9. The Sanskrit conjunct consonant \u0917\u0941, g\u00f1a, is changed in P\u0101li to \u0928\u093e, n\u0101, which is changed in Sinhalese to \u0928, n; as \u0917\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e, \"wisdom,\" P\u0101li, \u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e, n\u0101na, Sinhalese, \u0928\u0947\u0928\u093e, nena, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0924\u093f, \"wisdom,\" P\u0101li, \u092a\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0924\u093f, pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ti, Sinhalese, \u092a\u0947\u0928\u093e, pena.\n\n10. \u0921, \u1e0d, and \u0930, r, are changed to \u0932, l, in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit; and Sinhalese adopts it, e.g., \u0938\u094b\u0932\u094b\u0938, solos, \"sixteen,\" for \u0936\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093e\u0938, shodasa; \u0924\u0947\u0930\u093e\u0938, teles, \"thirteen,\" for \u0924\u0947\u0930\u093e\u0938, terasa; \u0905\u0920\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0938, atalos, \"eighteen,\" for \u0905\u0920\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0938, atth\u0101rasa. Sinhalese also changes \u091f, t, into \u0932, l, as \u0915\u0930\u0915\u091f\u093e\u0915\u093e, karkataka, Sinhalese, \u0915\u093e\u0915\u0941\u0932\u0941, kakulu, \"crab.\"\n\n11. Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit (in which is included P\u0101li) always reduces conjunct consonants of different classes to one class: this is done by eliding one and doubling the other; \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, dharma, \"scriptures,\" is written \u0927\u092e\u094d\u092e, dhamma; \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935, aswa, \"horse\" is written \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0938\u093e, assa; \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0917, mudga, \"kidney beans,\" is \u092e\u0941\u0917\u094d\u0917\u093e, mugga; \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e, punya, \"merit,\" is punna, in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, and \u092a\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e, pu\u00f1\u00f1a in P\u0101li; \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e, matsya, \"fish,\" is written \u092e\u091a\u094d\u091b, machchha. The Sinhalese still further reduces these to single consonants by eliding one of them; as \u0926\u092e\u094d, dam, or \u0926\u0939\u092e\u094d, daham, \"scriptures\"; \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935, as, \"horse;\" \u092e\u0941\u0902\u0917\u0941, mungu, \"kidney beans;\" \u092a\u093f\u0928\u094d, pin, \"merits\" \u092e\u0938\u0941, masu, \"fish.\"\n\n12. In Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, consonants are elided in the middle or end of words, and sometimes in the beginning also; but in Sinhalese the hiatus thus occurring is avoided either by the coalition of the vowel or by the insertion of semi-vowels: thus, \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0948\u0932\u094b\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e, trailokya, \"the three worlds,\" is in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit teloa, but in Sinhalese we find \u0924\u093f\u0932\u094b\u0935\u093e, tilova. Here we have the semi-vowel \u0913, o, inserted between the vowels o and a. For the Sanskrit nabha\u015btala, \"sky,\" we find in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit nahaala, where both the b and the nexus st are lost. The Sinhalese avoids the\naspirate eliding the first letter of the conjunct consonant, and we get \u0db1\u0dd4\u0db6\u0dbd, nubatala. Pr\u00e1krit, naa, \"nine,\" Sinhalese, \u0db1\u0dc0 nava; Pr\u00e1krit, visai, \"twenty,\" Sinhalese, \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2 visi.\n\n13. The Sinhalese sound \u0d85, \u0113, comes into play when a long \u1e41, \u00e1, or \u1e43 \u0113, is shortened, or a nexus preceded by \u1e41, a, is elided, e.g., \u0905\u0936\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935, \u00e1sh\u00e1\u1e0dha, \"name of a month (June and July),\" \u0910\u0938\u0932\u093e, esala; \u092e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u093e, makshik\u00e1, \"fly,\" \u092e\u0947\u0938\u0940, mesi; \u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0928, hastin, \"elephant,\" \u090f\u0924\u093f, eti; \u0937\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0940, shashti, \"sixty\" \u0939\u0947\u0924\u093e, heta. It is also a substitute for \u1e41, e, as velli, \"creeper\" Sinhalese \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dbd vel. Though in Beng\u00e1li and other vernaculars of India there is no letter corresponding to the Sinhalese \u0d85, \u0113, yet Mr. Beames says:\u2014\"In some instances in Beng\u00e1li the vowel \u1e41, e, has a short harsh sound, like that of English a in hat. Thus ek, \"one,\" sounds yak or ack.\" This is just what the Sinhalese \u0d85, \u0113, is: the vowel changes entirely depend upon the preceding or succeeding vowels of a word.\n\nThe following examples will shew that a large number of words with slight modifications, is common to all. I work on the materials supplied by Beames.\n\nSk\u1e5b.* karka\u1e6daka \"crab;\" P\u00e1li, kakka\u1e6da; S. k\u00e1nki\u1e0do; H. kekara; Sin. kaku\u1e37u, \"sea crab.\"\n\nSk\u1e5b. karka\u1e6dika; \"cucumber;\" P\u00e1. kakk\u00e1ri; S. kaki\u1e0d\u00ed; H. kakad\u00ed; O., B. kakud\u00ed; Sin. k\u0113kiri.\n\nSk\u1e5b. karbura, \"variegated;\" S. kubiro; H. kabar\u00e1, k\u00e1b\u0101ra; Sin. kabara.\n\nSk\u1e5b. kshana; \"moment;\" S. khina; H. khana, khana, chhana; Sin. kena, s\u0113na.

Beyond 10 a modified form of the Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed decimal numeration is that in common use. Some confusion, however, arises from the co-existence of the two systems; thus, fanas or fans\u00e1s may be either 48 or 50; hiya or sat\u00e9ka, 96 or 100.\" (\"The M\u00e1ldive Islands,\" Sessional Papers, Ceylon, 1881, p. 121.)\n\nMr. Albert Gray in giving the M\u00e1ldive numerals recorded by Pyrard with their Sinhalese equivalents, adds in a foot note:\u2014\"After this number Pyrard has the following:\u2014Note that they have the numbers up to twelve (as we have them up to ten): then they go on by twelves, and their hundred is 96, or eight times 12.\" It will be seen by the numbers which follow that those only which are correct according to Sinhalese enumeration are compounds of dolos, viz., tin dolos, passedolos, and addolos. They are simply, 'three dozen', 'five dozen,' and 'seven dozen.' On the other hand, those which are not compounds of dolos are altered values of the ordinary Sinhalese decimal numbers. Yet it is strange that Pyrard could make mistakes with numbers so low as 'twenty-four' and 'forty-eight' which by analogy ought to be dedolos and h\u00e1radolos...... It seems that the Maldivians count much by dozens; indeed, Christopher (Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. 1836-8, p. 69) says,\n\n* Mr. Ranasingha's paragraph (p. 241) on M\u00e1ldive numerals justifies this note.\u2014B. Hon. Sec.\n'they reckon by twelves, as we do by tens;' but they have not abandoned altogether the decimal system. If, however, passee and panas really stand for 'twenty-four' and 'forty-eight,' it will be interesting to know the Maldivian for 'twenty' and 'fifty.'\u201d (Journ. R. A. S., Vol. viii. n. s. 1878, pp. 193-4.)\n\nMr. Ranasingha has rightly shown, from a comparison with the Sinhalese, the true meaning and value of the forms, fassehi, fanas, and hiya; but it is difficult to account for the anomaly of their employment in a duo-decimal system, otherwise than as relics of an original decimal numeration, which, from unknown causes, was temporarily abandoned, only to reassert itself, though under a different garb more closely resembling other \u00c1ryan vernaculars than Sinhalese.\n\nThe following table of Maldivian numerals exhibits both systems:\u2014\n| Duo-decimal | Decimal |\n|-------------|---------|\n| 1           | eke'    |\n| 2           | de'     |\n| 3           | tine'   |\n| 4           | hatare' |\n| 5           | fahe'   |\n| 6           | haye'   |\n| 7           | hate'   |\n| 8           | arhe'   |\n| 9           | nuvaye' |\n| 10          | dihaye' |\n| 11          | ekolobe'|\n| 12          | dolohe' |\n| 13          | dolos-eke' |\n| 14          |         |\n| 15          |         |\n| 16          |         |\n| 17          |         |\n| 18          |         |\n| &c.,        |         |\n| 19          |         |\n| 20          |         |\n| 21          |         |\n| 22          |         |\n| 23          |         |\n| 24          | fassehi |\n| 25          | fassehi-eke' |\n| 26          |         |\n| 27          |         |\n| 28          |         |\n| 29          |         |\n| 30          |         |\n| &c.,        |         |\n| 31          |         |\n| 32          |         |\n| 33          |         |\n| 34          |         |\n| 35          |         |\n| 36          | tin-dolos |\n| 37          | tin-dolos-eke' |\n| 38          |         |\n| 39          |         |\n| 40          |         |\n| 41          |         |\n| 42          |         |\n| &c.,        |         |\n| 43          |         |\n| 44          |         |\n| 45          |         |\n| 46          |         |\n| 47          |         |\n\n\u2020 Transcribed from a list given in a M\u00e1ldiv\u00e9 tar\u012bb, or commentary on the kur\u0101n.\u2014B.

M. Deffremery and Sanguinetti, by Albert Gray, M.R.A.S., late of the Ceylon Civil Service.]\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe wonderful travels of Ibn Bat\u00fata are a record alike of the commercial activity of the Arabs, and of the far-reaching power of the Bagdad caliphate, whose influence long survived its overthrow. From the swift rise of the Muhammadan power in the seventh century down to the arrival of Vasco di Gama at Calicut in 1498, the trade of Europe with the East was in the hands of the Arabs. The carrying to Europe was done by their ships, but in the Indian seas a vast coast trade was developed by all the nations of the Indian sea-bord\u2014Persians, the races of India, Ceylon, the Eastern Islands and China. After the rounding of the Cape followed in succession the restrictive monopolies of the Portuguese, Dutch, and English, and the Eastern nations have never regained the great and free international commerce of the Arab days.\n\nFrom the story of Ibn Bat\u00fata, one comes to understand how it was possible for a native of Tangiers in the fourteenth century to travel, with but little difficulty, for twenty-four years over every country between Morocco and China. The Muhammadan faith had been spread over a great part of India, and had established a footing in China: Arab merchants were everywhere; and ships were never long in demand for voyages from any one port to any other.\nIbn Bat\u00fata was born at Tangiers in 1304, and died at Fez 1377\u20138. The following summary of his travels of twenty-four years (1325 to 1349) is given by Dr. Birdwood of the India Office. From Tangiers he travelled across Africa to Alexandria, and in Palestine, Syria, and Arabia: down the east coast of Africa to Quilon: across the Indian Ocean to Muscat, Ormuz, Kish, Bahrein and El Catif: through Central Arabia to Mecca and Jeddah: and again in Egypt and Asia Minor, and across the Black Sea to Caffa or Theodosia, and by Azov or Tana \u2018on past the hills of the Russians\u2019 to Bolgar on the Volga\u2014but not daring to penetrate further northwards into \u2018the land of Darkness.\u2019 Returning south to Haj-Tarkhan (Astrakhan) he proceeded in the suite of the wife of the Khan of Kipchah, the daughter of the Greek Emperor Andronicus, westward to Soldaia and Constantiniah (Constantinople), whence returning to Bolgar he travelled on eastward to Bokhara, and through Khorassan to Cabul, Multan, and Delhi where he remained eight years (1334-42). Being sent on an embassy to China he embarked at Kin-baiat (Cambay), and after many adventures at Calicut (where he was honorably received by the \u2018Samari\u2019 or Zamorin) and Hunawar (Onore), and in the M\u00e1ldive Islands (beginning of 1343-August, 1344) and Ceylon and Bengal, he at last took his passage toward China in a junk bound for Java, as he calls it, but in fact Sumatra. Returning from China, he sailed direct from the coast of Malabar to Muscat and Ormuz: and travelling by Shiraz, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Damascus and for the fourth time to Mecca, Egypt, Tunis, at last reached Fez again, after an absence of half his life-time. Subsequently he spent six years in Spain and Central Africa, where he was the guest of the brother of a countryman of his own from Ceutra, whose guest he had been in China. \u201cWhat an enormous distance lay between these two!\u201d he exclaims.\n\nThe first detailed account of his book was published in Europe only in 1808. Moura in 1845 commenced a translation in Portuguese of a copy obtained at Fez at the end of last century. The abridgment translated by Lee was brought from the east by Burckhart. It was not till the French conquest of Algeria that the best and completest texts were obtained. Five are in the Imperial Library at Paris, only two of which are perfect. From these M. M. Defr\u00e9my and Sanguinetti made their translation for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique: and it is from their version that the present account of the M\u00e1ldives and Ceylon visit has been extracted. His description of the M\u00e1ldives is the most interesting and complete in existence, excepting only that of Pyrard de Laval.\nIBN BAT\u00daTA\n\nIN\n\nTHE M\u00c1LDIVES AND CEYLON.*\n\nI RESOLVED to go to the Dh\u00edbat Almahal (the M\u00e1ldives) of which I had heard much. Ten days after we had embarked at Calicut we arrived at the Dh\u00edbat Almahal islands. Dh\u00edbat is pronounced as the feminine of Dhib ('Arabic for \"wolf\": it is really an alteration of the Sanskrit dou\u00eepa, \"island\"). These islands are among the wonders of the world: they number about 2,000.\u2020 A hundred or less of these islands lie together in a circle in the form of a ring: the group has an entrance as to a harbour, and ships get through by that alone. When a ship arrives near one of these islands it must of necessity have a pilot from among its natives, so that it may reach the other islands under his guidance. They are so close to each other that the tops of the palms which grow on one seem to belong to its neighbour.\u00a7 If the vessel misses its way it cannot reach the islands, and is driven by the wind to Ma\u2019bar (coast of Coromandel) or towards Ceylon.\n\n* Voyages d'Ibn Batoutah, par C. Defr\u00e9my et Le Dr. B. R. Sanguinetti, Tome IV., 110\u2014185, 191\u20132, 205\u20136, 207\u201310. Paris, 1879.\n\n\u2020 See Gray, J. R. A. S., 1878, Vol. X. n. s., pp. 196\u20137, notes 2, 3; and \"The M\u00e1ldive Islands\" (Ceylon Sessional Papers, 1881), pp. 3, 4, 5, Notes (1) (6)\u2014B.\n\n\u2021 So too more recent travellers:\u2014\"The Malabares say that heretofore they were joyn\u2019d to the Continent, and were separated by the sea, which in some places hath left such narrow divisions that an active man might leap from one side to the other\" (Mandelso's Travels into the Indies, 1639. Lib. II. 116. London, 1662). \"But that which makes them so numerous is the multitude of canals that divide them; which are so narrow that the sprit-sails of the ships strike the leaves of the trees which are planted on both sides. And in some places a nimble man may leap into an island from the top of a bough that grows in another.\"\u2014(Collection of Voyages of the Dutch East-India Company, p. 131, London, 1703)\u2014B.\nAll the inhabitants of these islands are Musalm\u00e1ns, pious and honest people. They are divided into regions or zones, each of which is ruled by a governor called Cordouiy. Among these zones the following are distinguished: (1) the zone of P\u00e1lipour; (2) Cannalo\u00fbs; (3) Mahal, the province after which all the islands are called, and at which their sovereigns reside; (4) T\u00e9l\u00e2dib; (5) Car\u00e2\u00efd\u00f4\u00fb; (6) Te\u00eem; (7) T\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty; (8) H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty, the name differing from the preceding only by having its first letter an h: (9) B\u00e9r\u00e9\u00efd\u00f4\u00fb; (10) Candacal; (11) Molo\u00fbc; (12) Souweid. The last is the most distant of all.* All the M\u00e1l-dive islands are destitute of grain, except that in the province\n\n* The French editors identify these names with those given by Pyrard as follows:\u2014\u2018P\u00e1lipour\u2019\u2014\u2018Padypolo\u2019; \u2018Mahal\u2019\u2014\u2018Mal\u00e9\u2019; \u2018Car\u00e2\u00efd\u00f4\u00fb\u2019\u2014\u2018Caridou\u2019; \u2018T\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty\u2019\u2014\u2018Tilla dou matis\u2019; \u2018H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty\u2019\u2014\u2018Milla doue madoue\u2019; \u2018B\u00e9r\u00e9\u00efd\u00f4\u00fb\u2019\u2014\u2018Poulisdous\u2019; \u2018Molo\u00fbc\u2019\u2014\u2018Molucque\u2019; \u2018Souweid\u2019\u2014\u2018Souadou.\u2019 The Cannalo\u00fbs of Ibn Bat\u00fbta, they add, is perhaps the \u2018Collomadous\u2019 of Pyrard, or, as Horsburgh writes it, \u2018Colomandous.\n\n[\u201cThe majority of the above \u2018are easily recognisable,\u2019 but five (viz., Cannalo\u00fbs, T\u00e9l\u00e2dib, Te\u00eem, H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty, and Candacal) present more difficulty,\u2014some, indeed, being shaped, more Arabico, out of all but unsatisfactory conjectural recognition.\n\n\u201cAs regards H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty, the French translators would appear to be at fault. It may perhaps with more reason be taken as equivalent to Hela-du(m)-mati (S. hela, \u2018white,\u2019 or even sela, = Jav. sela, \u2018rock\u2019 + d\u00e2va, \u2018island\u2019 + matu-pita, \u2018above\u2019) passing by contraction into Had-dummati. Add\u00fb may similarly be a contracted form of Hela-d\u00fb or Hulu-d\u00fb\u2014the name of one of the islands in that Atol.\n\n\u201cIf it be open to question the orthography of the MS. and, supposing an error of the copyist, read N\u00e9l\u00e2dib for T\u00e9l\u00e2dib\u2014t and n are not unlike in Arabic\u2014it can be at once fitted to Nilandu Atol. Even accepting the received form as correct, the identification may possibly be not considered too far-fetched. Cf. Tojaree = ? Naus\u00e2ri; Accanee and Kaluftee islands\u2019 (Lakkadive group) = Aucutta, Kalpeni. Adm. Chart. (Col. Yule in Indian Antiquary, Vol. III., pp. 212-4 on \u201cNames in the Tohfat-al Maj\u00e2hidin.\u201d).\n\n\u201cTo attempt to twist the rest into probable coincidence with the modern names of the remaining Atols seems hopeless. But the identification of Car\u00e2\u00efd\u00f4\u00fb with Caridou (Kaharid\u00fb)\u2014if accepted\u2014suggests a likely clue to their origin. Admitting that this island\u2014now-a-days of comparative insignificance\nof Souweid there is a cereal like the anly (a kind of millet) which is brought thence to Mahal.* The food of the natives consists of a fish like the lyroun, which they call koulb alm\u00e1s. Its flesh is red: it has no grease, but its smell resembles that of mutton. When caught at the fishing, each fish is cut up into four pieces, and then slightly cooked: it is then placed in baskets of coco leaves and suspended in smoke. It is eaten when perfectly dry. From this country it is exported to India, China and Yaman. It is called koulb alm\u00e1s\u2020 (cobolly masse, i.e., \"black fish\" according to Pyrard, Part 1, p. 210, 214.)\n\n\u2014was of sufficient importance in the 14th century to be classed as a 'province', it is not improbable that other islands would have been taken as representative of whole groups or Atols.\n\n\"T\u00e9l\u00e1dib, if not Nilandu, might then be Toddu, on the analogy of Had-dummati from H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty: Cannalo\u00fbs\u2014Kinalos, 'Kenoorus,' Admiralty Chart, (M\u00e1losma\u1e0dulu Atol): Candacal\u2014Kedikolu, 'Kaindecolu,' Admiralty Chart, (Miladumma\u1e0dulu Atol. Cannalo\u00fbs and Teim should lie North of M\u00e1l\u00e9. Ibn Bat\u00fata, crossing from the Malabar coast, landed first at the former, 'an island fair to behold, where there are many mosques,' and touched later at Teim 'after four days' cruise' when bound for Mahal (M\u00e1l\u00e9).\u201d\u2014(The M\u00e1ldives Islands, p. 18, Note (1), Ceylon Sessional Papers, 1881.)\n\nColonel Yule and Mr. Gray identify Teim with Utimu (Admiralty Chart, Oteem) near north end of Tiladummati Atol. \"Cannalous, Candecal and Otimo appear in the oldest European maps\"\u2014B.]\n\n* Either the fine grain known to the Sinhalese as (i.) tana h\u00e1l (Setaria Italica), M. ur\u00e1 (Pyrard, oura), or (ii.) men\u00e9ri (Panicum miliaceum), M. kudibai\u2014both of which are found on the Southern Atols. Some nacheri or kurakkan (Cynosurus corocanus), M. bimbi (Pyrard, bimby), is grown on the Northern Atols\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Koulb alm\u00e1s:\u2014Pyrard has cobolly masse (Pyrard, third edition, 1619, p. 210), and combolly masse (p. 214), and says the words mean \"black fish.\" See also Pridham 'Ceylon', p. 605. The Sighalese call it umbalaka\u1e0da. [See \"Note on Fish-curing at the M\u00e1ldives\" (Ind. Ant., July, 1882, Vol. XI., pp. 196-8):\u2014\"The real 'M\u00e1ldives fish' (M. kalubili mas, vulgarly komboli mas), S. umbala kada) of the Ceylon and Indian markets are chiefly bonito (S. balay\u00e1)\u2014Scomber Pelamis, Linn.\" Kalubili=kalu, 'black': bili (S. balay\u00e1,) 'bonito.'\u2014B.]\nThe Trees of the Maldives.\n\nMost of the trees on these islands are coconuts: they furnish the food of the inhabitants along with the fish, of which mention has been made. The nature of the coconut is marvellous. One of these palms produces each year twelve crops, one a month. Some are small, others large: many are dry [yellow], the rest are green and remain always so. From the fruit is obtained milk, oil, and honey, as we have said in the first part of this book. With the honey is made pastry, which they eat with the dried coconut. All the food made from the coconut, and the fish eaten at the same time effect an extraordinary and unequalled vigor in manhood.*\n\nAmong the remarkable trees of these islands are the tchou-mo\u00fbn (Eugenia Jambu) the lemon, the lime and the colocasia. From the root of the last named, the natives prepare a flour with which they make a kind of vermicelli, and this they cook in coco milk; it is one of the most agreeable dishes in the world. I had a great taste for it and ate it often.*\n\nOf the Inhabitants of these Islands and some of their Customs: Description of their Dwellings.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Maldivian islands are honest and pious people, sincere in good faith and of a strong will: they eat only what is lawful, and their prayers are granted. When one of them meets another, he says \"God is my lord: Muhammad is my prophet: I am a poor ignorant being.\" In body they are weak and have no aptitude for combat or for war, and their arms\n\n* \"The island [M\u00e1le] produces .......... a bulb in shape and appearance much resembling an ordinary potatoe, but having a pungent flavor. This the natives grate down, and steep in water for some time to deprive it of the unpleasant taste, and dry it afterwards, when it looks very much like flour, and is very palatable\" (Christopher and Young in Trans. Bombay, Geographical Society, 1836-38, p. 80). Without doubt the yam called by Maldivians hittala (Pyrard, itelpoul, \"an edible root which grows in abundance, round and large as the two fists\") and probably identical with the hiritala (Dioscorea oppositifolia) of the Siphalese\u2014B.\nare prayers. One day in this country, I ordered the right hand of a robber to be cut off; upon which many of the natives in the hall of audience fainted away. The Indian pirates do not attack them, and cause them no alarm, for they have found that whoever takes anything of theirs is struck with a sudden calamity. When a hostile fleet comes to their shores, they seize what strangers they find, but do no harm to the natives. If an idolater appropriates anything, if it be but a lime, the chief of the idolaters punishes him and beats him severely, so much does he fear the results of such an action. Were it otherwise, certainly these people would be a most contemptible foe in the eyes of their enemies, because of the weakness of their bodies. In each of their islands there are fine mosques, and most of their buildings are of wood.\n\nThe islanders are good people: they abstain from what is foul, and most of them bathe twice a day, and properly too, on account of the extreme heat of the climate and the abundance of perspiration. They use a large quantity of scented oils, such as sandal-wood oil, &c., and they anoint themselves with musk from Makdachaou.* It is one of their customs, when they have said the morning prayer, for every woman to go to meet her husband or son with the collyrium box, rose-water and musk oil. He smears his eye-lashes with collyrium, and rubs himself with rose-water and musk oil, and so polishes the skin and removes from his face all trace of fatigue.\n\nThe clothing of these people consists of cloths. They wrap one round their loins in place of drawers, while on their backs they wear the stuffs called alouily\u00e2n\u2020 which resemble the ihr\u00e2m\n\n* Makdachaou:\u2014? Madagascar. [Rather Magadoxo on the Zanzibar coast, which Ibn Bat\u00fata had visited (Tome II., 181.) \"After leaving Zaila we sailed on the sea for fifteen days, and arrived at Makdachaou an extremely large town.\"\u2014See Yule's Marco Polo. Vol. II., p. 347\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Alouily\u00e2n\u2014ouily\u00e2n (p. 120):\u2014A probable corruption of M. j\u00e9liya, (cf.: S. valu, pil\u00ee, 'clothes') the term for the kambaya (S) or waist cloth worn by Maldivian women commonly and by soldiers on special occasions. The Maldivian equivalent for the ihr\u00e2m is known as digu lib\u00e1s\u2014B.\n(clothes worn by the Musalm\u00e1ns during the pilgrimage). Some wear the turban, others supply its place with a little kerchief. When any one meets the Kadh\u00ed or the preacher, he takes his garment off his shoulders, and uncovers his back, and so accompanies the functionary till he arrives at his place of abode. Another of their customs is this\u2014when one of them marries, and goes to the house of his wife, she spreads cotton cloths from the house door to that of the (nuptial) chamber: on these cloths she places handfuls of cowries on the right and left of the path he has to follow, while she herself stands awaiting him at the door of the apartment. On his arrival she throws over his feet a cloth which his attendants take up. If it is the wife* who goes to the husband\u2019s house, that house is hung with cloths, and cowries are placed thereon: and the woman on her arrival throws the cloth over his feet. And this is also the custom of the islanders when they salute the sovereign, they must without fail be provided with a piece of cloth to cast down at the moment, as we shall hereafter describe.\n\nTheir buildings are of wood\u2020 and they take care to raise the floor of their houses some height above the ground, by way of precaution against damp, for the soil of their islands is damp. This is the method they adopt: they cut the stones, each of which is of two or three cubits long, and place them in piles then they lay across these beams of the coco-tree, and afterwards raise the walls with boards. In this work they show marvellous skill. In the vestibule of the house they construct an apartment which they call m\u00e1lem,\u2021 and there the master of the house\n\n---\n\n* It appears from this passage that the two kinds of Sinhalese marriage, bina and diga, were in vogue at the M\u00e1ldives.

This room has two doors, one opening on the vestibule by which strangers are introduced, the other on the side of the house by which the owner enters. Near the room in question is a jar full of water [?] and a bowl called ou\u00e9lendj* made of the coconut shell. It has a handle of [only] two cubits, wherewith to draw the water from the wells, by reason of their little depth.\n\nAll the inhabitants of the M\u00e1ldives, be they nobles or the common folk, keep their feet bare. The streets are swept and well kept: they are shaded by trees, and the passenger walks as it were in an orchard. Albeit every person who enters a house is obliged to wash his feet with water from the jar placed near the m\u00e2lem, and rub them with a coarse fabric of lif\u2020 (stipulae which envelope the base of the stalks of the date-palm leaves) placed there: after which he enters the house. Every person entering a mosque does the same. It is a custom of the natives when a vessel arrives for the can\u00e2dir (in the singular cundurah)\u2021 i.e., the little boats to go out to meet it, manned by the people of the island and bearing some betel and caranbah \u00a7 that is to say, green coconuts. Each presents some of these to whom he will of those on board the ship, and then becomes his host carrying to his own house the goods belonging to him, as if he were one of his near relations. Any one of the new-comers who wishes to marry, is at liberty to do so. When the time comes for his departure, he repudiates his wife, for the people of the M\u00e1ldives do not leave their country. As for a man who does not marry,\n\n---\n\n* Ou\u00e9lendj:\u2014These cocoanut bowls with long handles (M. d\u00e2ni, but cf: S. valanda \u201cchatty\u201d) are regularly used by the Islanders for drawing water.

The revenue of the treasury, which is called bender *(custom-house) consists in the right of buying a certain portion of all cargo on board ship, at a fixed price, whether the commodity be worth just that or more: this is called the bender law. The bender has in each island a house of wood called b\u00e9djens\u00e2r where the governor, the cordou\u00e9ry, (above it is written cordo\u00fbiy)\u2020 collects all such goods: he sells or barteres them. The natives buy with chickens any pottery which may be brought: a pot fetches five or six chickens.\n\nShips export from the islands the fish of which I have spoken, coconuts, fabrics, the ouliy\u00e2n and turbans: these last are of cotton. They export also vessels of copper, which are very common there, cowries\u2021 and kanbar\u00a7, such is the name of the\n\n* Bender.\u2014See Pyrard, p. 231, \"bandery\": cf. Sin. bandh\u00e1ra. The system of raising revenue here described was still in force in Pyrard's day (Pyrard, chap. xvii.), and seems to be identical in principle with the 'culture system,' employed by the Dutch in Java, where it is supposed to have been invented by one of the Dutch governors subsequent to the English occupation. [Each Atol has its own storehouse (v\u00e1r\u00fa-g\u00e9) into which the revenues of the Sultan are received, and whence they are transferred from time to time to the Treasury (bod\u00fc bad\u00e9ri-ge, cf : S. bh\u00e1nd\u00e1g\u00e1rika) at M\u00e1l\u00e9.\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Cordou\u00e9ry, cordo\u00fbiy:\u2014\"The Atol-wari [Atolu-veri or V\u00e1r\u00fa-veri; Pyrard 'varuery'] is a governor or chief of a division of islands called an Atol ......

The Rarhu-wari [Rarhu-veri] or headman of an island, stands in the same relation to the Atol-wari, as the latter does to the Hindeggeree, in respect to the revenue.\" (Trans. Bombay Geo.

The natives make it undergo a preparation in pits dug near the shore: then they beat it with picks, after which the women work it into rope. They make of it cord for joining the boards of their ships, and such cordage is exported to China, India and Yemen. Kanbar rope is worth more than hemp. With this cord the (boards of) ships are joined in India and Yemen, for the Indian sea is full of rocks, and if a ship joined with iron bolts strikes a rock, it is broken up: but when it is fastened with this cord it has elasticity, and does not break.\n\nThe money of the islanders consist of cowries. This is the name of a creature (a mollusc), collected in the sea and placed in pits dug out on the beach. Its flesh decays and there remains only the white shell. A hundred of these shells is called sy\u00e2h, and 700, f\u00e2l; 12,000 are called cotta, and 100,000 bostou\u00e2. Bargains are struck through the medium of these cowries, at the rate of four bostou\u00e2 to a din\u00e2r of gold. Often they are of less value, such as twelve bostou\u00e2 to a din\u00e2r.* The islanders sell them to the people of Bengal for rice, for they too use them for money. They are sold in the same way to the people of Yemen, who use them for ballast in their ships in place of sand. These cowries serve also as a medium of exchange with the negroes in their native country. I have seen them sold, at M\u00e1ly and at Djoudjou, at the rate of 1,150 to a din\u00e2r of gold.\u2020\n\n**The Women of the M\u00e1ldives.**\n\nThe women of these islands do not cover the head: the sovereign herself does not so. They comb their hair and tie it\n\n---\n\n* Sy\u00e2h = Sin. siya. Ibn Bat\u00fata says bostou\u00e2 = 1 din\u00e2r of gold [= about 10 shillings, Lane], and Pyrard says 12,000 = 1 larin = 8 sols. [Cowries are usually sold in the Islands by the hiya = 100, the fal\u00e9 = 800 to 1,000, and the kott\u00e9 = 12,000 (b\u00e1ra-f\u00e2.) A kott\u00e9 is not now worth more than Rs.1 at M\u00e1l\u00e9.\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 M\u00e1ly; Djoudjou:\u2014Two places in the Soud\u00e1n, afterwards visited by the traveller.\nup on one side [of the head.] Most of them wear only a cloth, covering them from the navel to the ground: the rest of the body remains uncovered. In this costume they promenade the baz\u00e1rs and elsewhere. While I was invested with the dignity of K\u00e1z\u00ed in these islands, I made efforts to put an end to this custom, and to compel the women to clothe themselves: but I could not succeed. No woman was admitted to my presence in the trial of a case, unless she had her whole body covered: but, saving that, I had no power over the usage.* Some women wear, besides the cloth, chemises with short and full sleeves. I had some young female slaves whose dress was the same as that of the women of Delhi. They covered the head: but that disfigured rather than embellished their appearance, as they were not used to it.\n\nThe ornaments of the M\u00e1ldive women consist of bracelets: each has a certain number on both arms, indeed, so that the whole of the arm from the wrist to the elbow is covered. These trinkets are of silver: only the wives of the Sultan and his nearest relatives wear bracelets of gold. The M\u00e1ldive women have also khalkh\u00e1l (anklets) called by them b\u00e2il, and collars of gold round the neck, called besdered.\u2020 One of their curious customs is to engage themselves as house servants, in consideration of a fixed sum, which does not exceed five pieces of gold. Their board is at the expense of those who hire them. They do not regard this as a disgrace, and most of the daughters of the inhabitants do it. You will find in the house of a rich man ten or twenty of them. The cost of all dishes broken by one of these maids is charged against her. When she wishes to go from one house to another, the masters of the latter give her the amount of her debt, this she remits to the people of the house she is\n\n* Pyrard, 3rd ed., pp. 82, 124, says that all women in his time carefully kept the breasts covered.

Most of the men say nothing about a nuptial gift, contenting themselves with declaring their profession of the Musalm\u00e1n faith, and a nuptial gift in conformity to the law is given. When ships arrive, those on board take wives, and repudiate them on their departure: it is a kind of temporary marriage. The M\u00e1l\u0111ive women never leave their country. I have never seen in the world women whose society is more agreeable. Among the islanders, the wife entrusts to no one the care of her husband\u2019s service: she it is who brings him his food, takes away when he has eaten, washes his hands, presents the water for his ablutions, and covers his feet when he wills to go asleep. It is one of their customs that the wife never eats with her husband, and that he does not know what his wife eats. I married in that country many wives: some ate with me at my request: others did not, and I could not succeed in seeing them take their food, and no ruse to get a sight was of any avail.\n\nThe story of the motive for the conversion of the inhabitants of these Islands to Isl\u00e1m: Description of the Evil Spirits who wrought harm to them every month.\n\nTrustworthy men among the inhabitants, such as the\n\n* Regarding these servants (M. femus\u00e9ri), who are still employed, Mr. Gray (J.

They are generally well treated and fed; if not they are entitled to their freedom. \u2018Many a poor man voluntarily enters the service of some great lord as a pemousser\u00e9 to gain his protection and favour.\u2019 Christopher says that the men of Mal\u00e9 having to pay no taxes are very lazy and \u2018become dependents of any of the chiefs, most of whom retain as many followers as they may be able to support, a large retinue being a sign of rank and power.\u2019 Compare with this custom the growth of the feudal system in the West.\u201d\u2014B.\njuris-consult I\u00e7a Alyamany,* the juris-consult and schoolmaster \u2019Aly, the K\u00e1z\u00ed \u2019Abd Allah, and others, related to me that the population of the islands used to be idolaters, and that there appeared to them every month an evil spirit from among the Jinn, who came from the direction of the sea. He resembled a ship full of lamps. The custom of the natives, as soon as they perceived him, was to take a young virgin, to adorn her, and conduct her to a boudkh\u00e1nah,\u2020 i.e., an idol temple, which was built on the sea shore and had a window by which she was seen. They left her there during the night and returned in the morning; then they found the young girl dishonored and dead. They failed not every month to draw lots, and he upon whom the lot fell gave up his daughter. At length arrived among them a Maghrabin\u2021 called Abou\u2019lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t, the Berber, who knew by heart the glorious Kur\u00e1n. He was lodged in the house of an old woman of the island Mahal. One day he visited his hostess and found that she had assembled her relatives, and that the women were weeping as if they were at a funeral. He questioned them upon the subject of their affliction, but they could not make him understand the cause. An interpreter coming in informed him that the lot had fallen upon the old woman and that she had one only daughter, who had to be slain by the evil Jinn\u00ed. Abou\u2019lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t said to the woman:\n\n* I\u00e7a Alyamany:\u2014i.e.,? Is\u00e1 Falliy\u00e1 Maniku. The Falliy\u00e1 Maniku is the Sultan\u2019s Secretary and Keeper of the Privy Seal.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Boudkh\u00e1nah:\u2014It is very probable that this was a Buddhist temple. Christopher gives bu\u1e0du as the modern M\u00e1ldives for \u201cimage\u201d (J.R.A.S., Vol. VI., o.s., p. 57). But the word bodd seems to have been a general term for an image with the Arab Oriental travellers, and may only indicate that the Buddhist parts of India were the first visited by the Arabs.\u2014Journ. As, 1845, p. 167. Ibn Bat\u00fata elsewhere says that the Jama Masjid of Delhi was built upon the sight of a former Boudkh\u00e1nah he does not therefore mean to imply that the word was M\u00e1ldives. [For some remarks on \u201cBuddhism at the M\u00e1ldives\u201d see Ceylon Sess.

He was conducted the night following to the idol temple after he had done his ablutions. There he set himself to recite the Kur\u00e1n, then by the window he perceived the demon, and continued his recitation. As soon as the Jinn\u00ed came within hearing of the Kur\u00e1n, he plunged into the sea; and when the dawn was come, the Maghrabin was still occupied in reciting the Kur\u00e1n. The old woman, her relatives and the people of the island came to take away the girl, according to their custom, and to burn the corpse. They found the stranger reciting the Kur\u00e1n, and conducted him to their King, by name Ch\u00e9nour\u00e1zah,* whom they informed of this adventure. The King was astonished: the Maghrabin proposed to him to embrace Isl\u00e1m, and inspired him with a desire for it. Then said Ch\u00e9nour\u00e1zah to him:\u2014\"Remain with us till next month, and if you do again as you have just done and escape the evil Jinn\u00ed, I will be converted.\" The stranger remained with the idolaters and God disposed the heart of the King to receive the true faith. He became Musalm\u00e1n before the end of the month, as well as his wives, children and court. At the beginning of the following month the Maghrabin was conducted to the idol-temple; but the demon came not, and the Berber recited the Kur\u00e1n till the morning, when the Sultan and his subjects arrived and found him so employed. Then they broke the idols, and razed the temple to the ground. The people of the island embraced Isl\u00e1m, and sent messengers to the other islands, whose inhabitants were also converted. The Maghrabin remained among them, and enjoyed their high esteem. The natives made profession of his doctrine, which was that of the Im\u00e1n M\u00e1lic. Even at present they respect the Maghrabins for his sake. He built a mosque, which is known by his name. I have also read the following inscription graven in wood on the enclosed pulpit of the\n\n* Ch\u00e9nour\u00e1zah:\u2014Cf. S. Senarat 'King (Chief Commander) of the army' and Seneviratna 'the gem-like General.'\u2014B.\ngrand mosque: \"Sultan Ahmed Ch\u00e9no\u00fbr\u00e2zah has received the true faith at the hands of Abou\u2019lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t the Berber, the Maghrabin.\" This Sultan assigned a third of the taxes of the islands as alms to travelling foreigners in recognition of his reception of Isl\u00e1m through their agency. This share of the taxes still bears a name which recalls this event.\n\nOwing to the demon in question many of the M\u00e1l\u0111ive islands were depopulated before their conversion to Isl\u00e1m. When I reached the country I was not aware of this matter. One night, when I was at one of my occupations, I heard of a sudden people crying with loud voice the formul\u00e6, \"There is no God but God\" and \"God is very great.\" I saw children carrying Kur\u00e1ns on their heads, and women rapping the insides of basins and vessels of copper. I was astonished at their conduct and said \"What is happening\"? and they replied \"Do you not see the sea\"? Upon which I looked and saw a kind of large ship, seemingly full of lamps and chafing-dishes. They said to me \"that is the demon; he is wont to show himself once a month: but when once we have done as you have seen, he turns back and does us no harm.\"\n\nOf the Queen of these Islands.\n\nOne of the marvels of the M\u00e1l\u0111ives is that they have for their Sovereign a woman, by name Khad\u00eedjah, daughter of the Sultan Dj\u00e9l\u00e2l edd\u00een \u2019Omar, son of the Sultan Sal\u00e2h edd\u00een S\u00e2lih Albendj\u00e2ly. The kingdom had at one time been possessed by her grandfather, then by her father, and when the latter died, her brother, Chih\u00e1b edd\u00een, became King. He was a minor, and the Vizier \u2019Abd Allah, son of Mohammed Alhadhramy\n\n* Vestiges of this romantic legend of their conversion to Muhammadanism live in the traditions of the Islanders to this day. But with more probability, they assign to a Shaikh Y\u00fasup Shams-ud-din of Tabrij the honour, which Ibn Bat\u00fata not unnaturally would claim for a Maghrabin, and the votaries of Hazrat Mir\u00e1 S\u00e1hib for the N\u00e1g\u00farsaint (C.A.S. Journ., No. 24, pp. 125\u201336 1881). Their first royal convert to Isl\u00e1m the M\u00e1l\u0111ivians commonly know as \"Darumavanta (= S.

He is the same personage who married the Sultana Khadidjah after the death of her first husband, the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l edd\u00edn, as we shall describe hereafter. When Chih\u00e1b edd\u00edn attained full age he ousted his step-father \u2019Abd Allah and banished him to the islands of Souwe\u00edd. He was then left in sole possession, and chose as Vizier one of his freedmen by name \u2019Aly Calaky,* whom he deposed at the end of three years and banished to Souwe\u00edd. It is related of the Sultan Chih\u00e1b edd\u00edn that he consorted nightly with the wives of the public officers and with courtezans. On that account he was deposed and deported to the province of H\u00e9l\u00e9dout\u00e9ny (above spelt H\u00e9l\u00e9dommety): afterwards some one was sent and put him to death.\n\nThere then remained of the royal family only the sisters of the deceased, Kadidjah who was the eldest, Miryam and Fathimah. The natives raised Kadidjak to the throne, who was married to their preacher Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l edd\u00edn. The latter became Vizier and master of the situation\u2020 and promoted his son Mohammed to the office of Preacher in his own stead: but orders were promulgated only in the name of Khadidjah. These are traced on palm leaves by means of an iron [style] bent down resembling a knife. They write on paper only the Kur\u00e1ns and scientific treatises. The Preacher makes mention of the Sultana on Fridays and on other days [of public prayer]; and here are the terms used, \u201cO God, succour Thy servant, whom Thou hast in Thy wisdom preferred before other mortals, and whom Thou hast made the instrument of Thy mercy towards all Musalm\u00e1ns, namely, the Sultana Khadidjah daughter of Sultan Dj\u00e9l\u00e1l edd\u00edn, son of Sultan Sal\u00e1h edd\u00edn.\u201d\n\nWhen a stranger comes among these people and repairs to the hall of audience, which is called d\u00e1r,\u2021 custom requires that he\n\n* \u2019Aly Calaky:\u2014i.e., \u2019Ali Kal\u00e9ge.

Their pay is in rice, supplied to them at the bender (v. s., p. 10) every month. When the month is ended, they present themselves at the audience hall, and, saluting the Vizier, say, \"Convey our respects (to the Queen) and inform her that we have come to request our pay.\" Thereupon the necessary orders are given in their favour. The K\u00e1z\u00ed and ministers, who have with the people the title of Viziers, also present themselves every day at the audience hall.

The lawyer 'Aly gave me a feast. He was a distinguished person and had sons addicted to study. I saw there a man named Mohammed a native of Zhaf\u0101r Alhom\u014dudh, who entertained me and said to me, \"If you set foot on the island of Mahal, the Vizier will forcibly detain you, for the people have no K\u0101z\u012b.\" It was then my intention to get away from that country to Ma'bar (Coromandel coast), to Serendib (Ceylon), to Bengal, and then to China. I had then arrived at the Maldives in a ship whose captain was 'Omar Alhinaoury, who was one of the virtuous pilgrims. When we had come into harbour at Cannalo\u00fbs, he remained there ten days: then he hired a little barque to take him thence to Mahal, bearing a present for the Queen and her Consort. I wished to go with him, but he said, \"The barque is not big enough for you and your companions: if you like to set out without them, it is your affair.\" I declined this proposal, and 'Omar took his departure. But the wind was contrary (literally 'played with him') and at the end of four days he came back to us, not without having experienced trouble. He made his excuses to me, and implored me to go with him, my companions and all. We set sail in the morning and towards midday disembarked on an island: leaving that, we passed the night at another. After a four days cruise, we arrived at the province of Te\u00efm, the governor of which was one Hil\u00e1l. He welcomed me, and gave me a feast; and afterwards came to visit me accompanied by four men, two of whom had on their shoulders a rod* from which were suspended four chickens. The other two had a similar rod to which were attached about ten coconuts. I was\n\n* M. dadim\u0101ru\u2014the katliya of the Sinhalese\u2014B.\n\natoll of the name Cannalo\u00fbs or one resembling it. It is unlikely too that Ibn Bat\u00fata coming from the north made his landing at a point so far south as Collomandu. The termination 'lous,' moreover or 'lu' seems in the modern names of the islands to be quite distinct from 'du.' [V.s., p. 5, for identification of this island with Kinalos in M\u00e1losma\u1e0dulu Atol. M. \u1e0dos = ? the bois mapou tree of the Chagos group : M. du = S. diva 'islet.'\u2014B.]\nsurprised that they thought so highly of these common objects; but was informed that they do this as a token of consideration and respect.*\n\nAfter leaving these people we landed on the sixth day at the island of Othm\u00e2n, a distinguished man and one of the best one could meet. He received us with honour and entertained us. On the eighth day we put into an island belonging to a Vizier named T\u00e9lemdy. On the tenth, we at length reached the island of Mahal, where the Sultana and her Consort reside, and cast anchor in the harbour. It is a custom of the country that no one may disembark without the permission of the inhabitants.\u2020 This was accorded to us: and I then desired to betake myself to some mosque, but the slaves on the beach prevented me, saying, \"It is necessary that you should first visit the Vizier.\" I had requested the captain when he should be questioned about me to say, \"I know nothing of him\"; for fear lest they should detain me, being unaware that some ill-advised babbler had written to them an account of me, and that I had been K\u00e1z\u00ed at Delhi. On our arrival at the audience hall, we took our seats on benches at the third entrance door. The K\u00e1z\u00ed 'I\u00e7a Alyamany came up and welcomed me, while I saluted the Vizier. The ship captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem (above he is called 'Omar) brought ten pieces of worked stuffs, made a salute before the Queen, and threw down one of them: then he bent the knee in honor of the Vizier and threw down another, and so on to the last. He was questioned about me, and replied, \"I know nothing of him.\"\n\nWe were then presented with betel and rose-water which is a mark of honor with them. The Vizier gave us lodging in a house and sent us a repast consisting of a large bowl full of rice and surrounded with plates of salted meats dried in the sun, chickens, melted butter and fish. On the morrow I set out with the captain and the K\u00e1z\u00ed, 'I\u00e7a Alyamany to visit a hermitage\n\n* The Sinhalese penumkada or pinga of presents of sweetmeats, provisions, fruits, &c.\n\n\u2020 Enforced to this day\u2014B.\nsituated at the extremity of the island and founded by the virtuous Shaikh Nedjib.* We returned at night, and on the following morning the Vizier sent me some raiment, and a repast comprising rice, melted butter, salt, sun-dried meat, coconuts, and honey extracted from the same fruit, called by the natives korb\u00e2ny,\u2020 signifying 'sugar-water.' They brought me also 100,000 cowries for my expenses. After ten days there arrived a ship from Ceylon, having on board some Persian and Arab fak\u00eers who knew me and told the servants of the Vizier all about me. This enhanced the pleasure given by my coming. He sent for me at the commencement of Ramaz\u00e1n. I found the Chiefs and Viziers already assembled: food was served at the tables, each of which accommodated a certain number of guests. The Grand Vizier made me sit by his side, in company of the K\u00e1z\u00ed \u2019Iqa, the F\u00e2meld\u00e1ry Vizier or Chief of the Treasury, and the Vizier \u2019Omar, the D\u00e9herd,\u2021 i.e., General of the army. The dinner of these islanders consists of rice, chickens, melted butter, fish, salt, sun-dried meat, and cooked bananas. After eating, they drink the coco honey mingled with aromatics, which facilitates digestion.\n\nOn the 9th of Ramaz\u00e1n, the son-in-law of the Vizier died. His wife, the daughter of that minister, had already been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e1b eddin: but neither of her husbands had cohabited with her on account of her youth. Her father, the\n\n* This old shrine (Najibu miskitu), it is said, may still be seen at M\u00e1l\u00e9.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Korb\u00e2ny:\u2014Probably ought to be \u2018hakorban\u2019 equivalent to the Sinhalese hakuru, \u2018jaggery\u2019: peni, \u2018honey,\u2019 the former word appearing as acourou for \u2018coco-honey\u2019 in the vocabulary of Pyrard.\n\n\u2021 D\u00e9herd:\u2014Cf.

I asked permission to entertain the fak\u00edrs returning from visiting the Foot of Adam, in the island of Ceylon (see below). This he granted, and sent me five sheep, a rare animal with the islanders, having to be brought from Ma\u2019bar (Coromandel Coast) from Malabar and from Makdachaou. The Vizier sent me also rice, chickens, melted butter and spices. I had all these carried to the house of the Vizier Soule\u00efm\u00e1n, the M\u00e2n\u00e2yec (Admiral), who took the greatest care in having them cooked, augmented them in quantity, and sent me carpets and copper vessels. We broke the fast according to custom, in the palace of the Sultana, with the Grand Vizier, and I requested him to permit some of the other Viziers to assist at my dinner. He said \u201cI will come myself too.\u201d I thanked him and returned home: but he had already arrived with the Viziers and grandees of the State. He seated himself in a raised pavilion of wood. All who came, whether Chiefs or Viziers, saluted the Grand Vizier, and threw down a piece of unworked stuff, in such numbers that the total reached to a hundred or thereabouts, all of which the fak\u00edrs appropriated. Dinner was then served and eaten: then the readers of the Kur\u00e1n gave a reading with their fine voices, after which were singing and dancing. I had a fire prepared, and the fak\u00edrs then entered and trampled it under foot; some of them even ate the live embers, as one would devour sweetmeats, until the flame was extinguished.\n\nThe Story of Some of the Vizier\u2019s Bene-\nfactions to Me.\n\nWhen the night was ended, the Vizier went home and I accompanied him. We passed a garden belonging to the Treasury, and the Vizier said to me, \u201cThis garden is for you: I will have a house built upon it to serve for your residence.\u201d I praised his kind action, and made vows in his favour. Next day he sent me a young female slave, and his messenger said, \u201cThe Vizier bids me say, if this girl pleases you, she is yours: otherwise he will\nsend a Mahratta slave.\u201d I liked the young Mahratta girls, so I replied \u201cI desire only the Mahratta,\u201d The minister had one brought to me, by name Gulistan, which signifies \u201cthe flower of the garden\u201d (or more exactly \u2018the parterre of flowers\u2019). She knew the Persian tongue, and pleased me highly. The Maldivian inhabitants have a language which I did not understand.\n\nThe next day, the Vizier sent me a young female slave from Coromandel by name Anbery (ambergris colour). On the following evening he came to my house with some of his servants, and entered attended by two little [boy] slaves. I saluted him, and he asked me how I did. I made vows for his welfare and thanked him. One of the slaves put before him a lokchah (bokchah),* that is, a kind of napkin, from which he drew some silk stuffs and a box containing pearls and trinkets. The Vizier made me a present of them, adding, \u201cIf I had sent these with the young slave, she would have said \u2018This is my property: I brought it from the house of my master.\u2019 Now that the things belong to you, make her a present of them.\u201d I addressed prayers to God for the minister, and rendered to him expressions of my gratitude, of which he was worthy.\n\nOF THE VIZIER\u2019S CHANGE OF DISPOSITION TOWARDS ME; OF THE PROJECT WHICH I FORMED TO DEPART; AND OF MY CONTINUED SOJOURN AT THE MALDIVES.\n\nThe Vizier Souleiman, the Manayec, had proposed to me to espouse his daughter. I sent to ask the permission of the Vizier Djem\u00e2l eddin to conclude the marriage. My messenger returned saying, \u201cIt does not please him; he wishes you to marry his daughter when the legal term of her widowhood shall have expired.\u201d I refused to consent to this union, fearing the sinister fortune attached to the daughter of the Vizier, since two husbands had already died without having consummated the marriage. In the midst of all this a fever seized me, and I was very ill.\n\n* Lokchah or bokchah.\u2014If the latter be the correct reading = ? burug\u00e2 the cloth worn over the face at times by Maldivian ladies,\u2014B.\nEvery person who goes to that island must inevitably catch the fever.* I made a strong resolve to get out of the country: I sold a portion of my trinkets for cowries, and chartered a ship to take me to Bengal. When I went to take my leave of the Vizier, the K\u00e1z\u00ed coming out met me, and addressed me in these terms, \"The Vizier,\" said he, \"bids me tell you this 'If you wish to go away, give us back what we have given you and then go.'\" I replied, \"With a part of my trinkets I have bought cowries; do with them what you will.\" In a little while the K\u00e1z\u00ed returned to me and said, \"The Vizier says 'We have given you gold, not cowries,'\u201d I replied, \"Very well: I will sell them and will pay you gold.\" Accordingly I sent to request the merchants to buy the shells from me. But the Vizier gave them orders not to deal with me; for his design, in so conducting himself, was to prevent me going away from him.\n\nThen he deputed one of his intimates, who had this conversation with me, \"The Vizier bids me request you to remain with us and you shall have everything you desire.\" So I said to myself, \"I am under their authority: if I do not stay with a good grace, I shall have to stay by constraint: a voluntary sojourn is preferable to that.\" I therefore made reply to the envoy, \"Very well: I shall remain with him.\" The messenger returned to his master, who was delighted with my reply, and sent for me. When I entered his presence, he got up and embraced me, saying, \"We wish you to remain with us, and you wish to go!\" I made my excuses, which were accepted, and said, \"If you wish me to stay, I will impose upon you certain conditions.\" The Vizier replied, \"We accept them: please to name them.\" I answered, \"I am unable to walk on foot.\" For it is a custom of the country that\n\n* \"On la connoist par toute l' Inde sous le nom de fi\u00e9vre des Maldives. Ils l'appellent Mal\u00e9 ons [hun or huma]. C'est de cette maladie que la pluspart de mes compagnons estoient morts, comme tous estrangers ne manquent pas d'en estre bientost atteints,\" (Pyrard, p. 95; again p. 201). The Indian Navy Surveyors (1834-6) suffered much from this pest of the group.\u2014B.\nno one rides on horseback, except the Vizier. So it was that when I had a horse* given to me and was mounted, the crowd of men, as well as children, began to follow me with astonishment, whereof I complained to the Vizier. Accordingly a donkorah was beaten, and it was proclaimed among the people that no one should follow me. The donkorah is a kind of copper basin, which is struck with an iron rod [or hammer], and gives a noise heard afar.\u2020 After it is struck, the crier cries in public whatever he required.\n\nThe Vizier said to me, \"If you wish to ride in a palaquin, well and good: otherwise we have a stallion and a mare: choose which of these animals you prefer.\" I chose the mare which was brought to me at once. At the same time some garments were brought to me. I said to the Vizier, \"What shall I do with the cowries which I have bought?\" He replied, \"Send one of your companions to sell them for you in Bengal.\" \"I will do so,\" said I, \"on condition that you send some one to help him in the affair.\" \"I will,\" he replied. So I despatched my comrade Abou Mohammed, son of Ferh\u00e2n, in whose company they sent one called the pilgrim 'Aly. But it happened that a storm arose: the crew jettisoned the whole cargo, including even the mast, the water, and all the other provisions for the voyage. They remained for sixteen days without sail, rudder, &c.; and after the endurance of hunger, thirst, and toil, they arrived at the island of Ceylon. In a year's time my comrade Abou Mohammed came back to me. He had visited the Foot (of Adam) and he afterwards saw it again with me.\n\nACCOUNT OF THE FESTIVAL IN WHICH I TOOK PART WITH THE ISLANDERS.\n\nThe month of Ramaz\u00e1n ended, the Vizier sent me some [proper] raiment, and we made our way to the place consecrated\n\n* In November, 1879, there were but two horses in the Islands, the property of the Sultan at M\u00e1l\u00e9, \"wretched wry-legged weeds, not fit to ride,\" and kept merely for show.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Donkorah:\u2014Ibn Bat\u00fata's ignorance of the M\u00e1ldivian language may possibly have led him to confuse dummarhi, the term for the 'flagiolet,' with koli 'gong.' The iron striker is called da\u011figa\u1e0du.\u2014B.\nfor prayer. The path which the minister had to traverse, between his residence and the place of prayer, had been decorated: stuffs had been spread, and there had been placed to right and left heaps (literally cotta's, v. s., p. 11) of cowries. All the Emirs and grandees who had houses on the road had planted near them little coco-trees, arecas, and bananas. Ropes were hung from one tree to the next, and green nuts were suspended from the ropes. The master of the house remained near the gate, and when the Vizier passed, he threw before his feet a piece of silk or cotton. The slaves of the minister appropriated these, as well as the cowries placed by the way. The Vizier advanced on foot, covered with an ample robe of goat's hair of Egyptian manufacture, and with a large turban. As a scarf he wore a kerchief of silk; four umbrellas shaded his head, and sandals covered his feet. All his attendants without exception had their feet bare. Trumpets, clarions, and drums* preceded him: the soldiers marched before and behind him, all shouting the cry \"God is very great!\" until they were arrived at the place of prayer.\n\nPrayer ended, the son of the Vizier preached: then was brought a litter which the Vizier mounted. The Emirs and the other grandees again saluted him, casting down pieces of stuffs according to custom. Before this time the Grand Vizier used not to ride in a litter, for the Kings alone did so. The bearers then lifted it; I mounted my horse, and we entered the palace. The minister seated himself at a raised dais, having near him the Viziers and the Emirs. The slaves remained standing, bearing shields, swords, and staves.\u2020 Food was then served, and afterwards arecanuts and betel, after which was brought a little dish containing sandal mokassiry.\u2021 As soon as one party of the guests\n\n---\n\n* M. talafili; dummarhi; beru.\u2014B.\n\u2020 M addana; kadi; daqi.\u2014B.\n\u2021 Mokassiry: =? M. kasturi 'musk.'\u2014B.\nhad eaten, they rubbed themselves with sandal. That day I saw upon one of their dishes a fish of the species of sardines, salted and raw, which had been sent as a present from Caoulem. This fish is very abundant on the Malabar Coast. The Vizier took a sardine, and began to eat it, at the same time saying to me, \"Eat some of that; it is not found in our country.\" I answered, \"How can I eat it? It is not cooked.\" \"It is cooked,\" said he. But I replied, \"I know this fish well, for it abounds in my native land.\"\n\nOF MY MARRIAGE AND OF MY NOMINATION TO THE DIGNITY OF K\u00c1ZI.\n\nOn the 10th day of Shaww\u00e1l I agreed with the Vizier Soule\u00efm\u00e2n M\u00e2n\u00e2yec, or Admiral, that I should espouse his daughter, and I sent to request the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin that the betrothal should take place in his presence at the palace. He agreed and sent betel, according to custom, and sandal. The people were present for the ceremony. The Vizier Soule\u00efm\u00e2n delayed his coming. He was sent for; and yet he came not. He was sent for a second time, and he excused himself on account of the illness of his daughter: but the Grand Vizier said to me in private, \"His daughter refuses to marry; and she is mistress of her own actions. But see! the people are assembled: would you like to espouse the step-mother of the Sultana, the widow of her father?\" (The Grand Vizier's son was then married to this woman's daughter). I replied \"Yes, by all means.\" He then convoked the K\u00e1z\u00ed and the notaries. The profession of the Musalm\u00e1n faith was then recited, and the Vizier paid the dowry. After some days my wife was brought to me. She was one of the best women who ever lived. Such was her good manners, that when I became her husband, she anointed me with scented oils and perfumed my clothes; during this operation she laughed and allowed nothing disagreeable to be seen.\n\nWhen I had married this lady, the Vizier constrained me to accept the functions of the K\u00e1z\u00ed. The cause of my nomina-\ntion was that I had reproached the K\u00e1z\u00ed for taking the tenth part of inheritances, when he made partition among the heirs. I said to him, \"You ought to have only a fee, which you should agree for with the heirs.\" This judge did nothing rightly. After I was invested with the dignity of K\u00e1z\u00ed, I used all my efforts to have the precepts of the law observed. Disputes are not settled in that country as in ours. The first bad custom which I reformed concerned the sojourn of divorced women at the houses of those who had repudiated them; for these women did not cease to remain at the houses of their former husbands, until they got married to others. I prevented this being done under any pretext. About five and twenty men were brought to me who had conducted themselves in this sort. I had them beaten with whips,* and had them marched through the baz\u00e1rs. As for the women, I compelled them to leave the homes of these men. Next I exerted myself to get prayers celebrated: I ordered some men to run down the streets and baz\u00e1rs immediately after the Friday's prayers. If any were discovered, who had not prayed, I had him beaten and marched through the town. I compelled the Im\u00e2ms and Mouezzins in possession of fixed appointments to apply themselves assiduously in their duties. I wrote in the same sense to (the magistrates of) all the other islands. Lastly I essayed to make the women dress themselves, but in this I did not succeed.\n\nOf the Arrival of the Vizier 'Abd Allah, son of Mohammed Alhadhramy whom Sultan Chihab Eddin had banished to Souweid: Account of what passed between us.\n\nI had espoused the step-daughter of this personage, and I loved this wife very dearly. When the Grand Vizier recalled him to the Island of Mahal, I sent him presents, went to meet\n\n* M. durr\u00e1. Pyrard has gleau \"leathern thongs used for corporal punishment.\"\u2014B.\nhim, and accompanied him to the palace. He saluted the Grand Vizier, who lodged him in a magnificent house, and there I often visited him. It happened, when I passed the month of Ramaz\u00e1n in prayer, that all the inhabitants visited me, except 'Abd-Allah. The Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l eddin himself came to see me, and 'Abd-Allah with him, but only bearing him company. Enmity arose between us. Afterwards when I came out of my retreat, the maternal uncles of my wife, the step-daughter of 'Abd-Allah made a complaint to me. They were the sons of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l eddin Assindjary. Their father had appointed the Vizier 'Abd-Allah to be their guardian, and their property was still in his hands, although they had by the law emerged from wardship. They demanded his appearance in Court. It was my custom when I summoned one of the contending parties to send him a slip of paper, either with or without writing. On delivery of that the party repaired to the Court; if he did not, I punished him. In this way I sent a slip to 'Abd-Allah. This procedure raised his choler, and on account thereof he conceived a hatred for me. He concealed his enmity and sent some one to plead for him. Some unseemly language was reported to me as having been used by him.\n\nThe islanders, both gentle and simple, were accustomed to salute the Vizier 'Abd-Allah in the same way as the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l eddin. Their salutation consists in touching the ground with the forefinger, then kissing it, and placing it on the head. I issued orders to the public crier, and he proclaimed in the Queen's palace in the presence of witnesses, that whoever should render homage to 'Abd-Allah in like manner as to the Grand Vizier should incur severe chastisement. And I exacted from him a promise that he would not allow men to do so. His enmity against me was now increased. Meantime I married another wife, daughter of a highly esteemed Vizier, whose grandfather was the Sultan D\u00e1oud, the grand-son of the Sultan\nAhmed Ch\u00e9no\u00fbr\u00e2zah.* Then I married one who had been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e2b eddin, and I had three houses built in the garden which the Vizier gave to me. My fourth wife, the step-daughter of 'Abd-Allah, lived at her own house. She was the one of all my wives whom I cherished the most. Thus allied by marriage to the persons named, the Vizier and the people of the island feared me much, by reason of their own weakness. False reports were spread between me and the Grand Vizier, in great part by the care of the Vizier 'Abd-Allah, so that our estrangement became final.\n\nOf my departure from these people, and of the motive thereof.\n\nIt happened that one day the wife of a slave of the late Sultan Djet\u00e2l eddin made a complaint of him to the Vizier, to the effect that he had a liaison with one of the Sultan's concubines. The Vizier sent witnesses, who entered the girl's house and found the slave asleep with her upon the same carpet. Both were taken into custody. In the morning, on being informed of this, I went to the audience hall and took my seat in my customary place. I made no reference to the affair. A courtier then approached me and said, \"The Vizier requests to know if you have any business with him.\" I replied, \"No.\" The design of the minister was that I should speak of the affair of the concubine and the slave; for it was my invariable rule to decide every case which he put before me. But as I was showing him my dissatisfaction and dislike, I omitted to do so then. I went straightway to my own house and took my seat where I delivered my judgments. Soon after came a Vizier, saying on behalf of the Grand Vizier, \"Yesterday, so and so occurred in\n\n* This relationship fixes approximately the date of Ch\u00e9no\u00fbr\u00e2zah and of the Muhammedan conversion, which may have been as early as 1200 A.D., but\u2014allowing for early marriages\u2014perhaps more probably about 1220, or 1230 A.D.\u2014See Paper on the Maldives, J.R.A.S., Vol.X., N., s., 1878., p. 177.\nthe matter of the concubine and slave: judge both of them conformably with the law.\" I replied, \"It is a cause in which it is not fitting to deliver judgment save at the Sultan's palace.\" I then returned thither: the people assembled, and the concubine and the slave were summoned. I ordered that both should be beaten for their liaison; and adjudged that the woman should be set at liberty and the slave kept in prison: after which I returned home.\n\nThe Vizier sent several of his principal attendants to speak to me about setting the slave at liberty. I said to them, \"Intercession is made with me in favor of a negro slave, who has violated the respect which he owed to his master; while but yesterday, you have deposed the Sultan Chih\u00e1b edd\u00edn and slain him, because he went into the house of one of his slaves.\" Thereupon I ordered the prisoner to be beaten with bambu switches, which produced more effect than the whip. I had him marched through the whole island, with a rope round his neck. The messengers of the Vizier went and informed him of what passed. He discovered great agitation and was inflamed with anger. He assembled the other Viziers, the chiefs of the army, and sent for me. I obeyed the summons. It was my custom to pay him homage by bending the knee. This time I did not do so, only saying \"Peace be with you!\"* Then I said to those present, \"Be ye witnesses that I resign my functions as K\u00e1z\u00ed, because I am rendered powerless to exercise them.\" The Vizier having then bespoken me, I went up and took a seat in front of him, and then I answered him in terms yet more severe. After this rencontre, the Mouezzin made the call to prayer at sun-down, and the Grand Vizier entered his house, saying, \"It is pretended that I am a sovereign; but see! I have sent for this man in order to vent my wrath upon him, and he dares to be angry with me.\" I was only respected by these islanders for the sake of the Sultan of India, for they knew the position I occupied under\n\n*Salaam alescon!\u2014Ar.\nhim. Although they are far removed from him, they fear him much in their hearts.\n\nWhen the Grand Vizier had returned to his house, he sent the deposed K\u00e1z\u00ed, an eloquent speaker, who addressed me as follows:\u2014\"Our master requires to know why you have violated, in the presence of witnesses, the respect which is due to him, and why you have not rendered him homage?\" I replied, \"I saluted him only when my heart was satisfied with him; but now that dissatisfaction has supervened, I have renounced the usage. The salutation of Musalm\u00e1ns consists only of the word ass\u00e9l\u0101m, (Peace be with you!) and that I have pronounced.\" The Vizier sent this person a second time, and he then said, \"You have no other aim but that of leaving us; pay the dowries of your wives, and what you owe to the men, and go when you will.\" At this speech I bowed and went to my house and paid such debts as I had contracted. Up to this time the Vizier had given me carpets and a suite of furniture, consisting of copper vessels, and other things. He used to grant me everything I asked; he loved me and treated me with consideration; but his disposition changed and he became inspired with fear of me.\n\nWhen he heard that I had paid my debts and that I was intending to depart, he repented of what he had said, and put off granting me permission to go. I adjured him by the strongest oaths that I was under necessity to resume my voyage. I removed my belongings to a mosque upon the beach, and repudiated one of my wives. Another was with child, to her I gave a term of nine months, within which I might return, or in default thereof she was to be mistress of her own actions. I took with me that one of my wives who had been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e1b eddin in order to restore her to her father who dwelt in the island of Molouc, and my first wife, whose daughter was half-sister to the Sultana. I agreed with the Vizier 'Omar Deherd (or General of the army, v. s. p. 22) and the Vizier\nHa\u00e7an, the Admiral, that I should go to the country of Ma\u2019bar* (Coromandel), the king of which was my brother-in-law, and that I should return with troops, to the end that the islands might be reduced under his authority, and that I should then exercise the power in his name. I chose to serve as signals between us, white flags to be hoisted on board the vessels. As soon as they should see these, they were to rise in rebellion on shore. I never had any such idea, up to the day when I showed my displeasure. The Vizier was afraid of me and said to the people, \u201cThis man is determined to get the Vizierate, me living or dead.\u201d He made many enquiries about me, and added, \u201cI have heard that the King of India has sent him money, to use in raising trouble against me.\u201d He dreaded my departure lest I should return from the Coromandel Coast with troops. He bade me remain until he should get a ship ready for me: but I refused.\n\nThe half-sister of the Queen complained to her of the departure of her mother with me. The Queen wished to prevent her, but did not succeed. When she saw her resolved to go, she said to her, \u201cAll the trinkets you possess were provided with money from the custom-house. If you have witnesses to swear that Dj\u00e9l\u00e1l eddin gave them to you, good and well; otherwise restore them.\u201d These trinkets were of considerable value; nevertheless my wife gave them up to these people. The Viziers and Chiefs came to me while I was at the mosque, and prayed me to return. I replied to them, \u201cHad I not sworn, assuredly I would return.\u201d They said, \u201cGo then to some other island, so that your oath be kept, and then return.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said I, to satisfy them. When the day of my departure\n\n* The name Ma\u2019bar (\u2018passage\u2019 or \u2018ferry\u2019) was given to the Coromandel coast by the Arabs during the 13th and 14th centuries. Col. Yule suggests that it referred to the communication with Ceylon, or, as is more probable, to its being at that age the coast most frequented by travellers from Arabia and the Gulf (Marco Polo II., p. 268). The tract of coast called Ma\u2019bar extended from Cape Comorin to Nellore.\nwas come, I went to bid adieu to the Vizier. He embraced me and wept in such wise that his tears fell upon my feet. He passed the following night watching in the island, for fear lest my connections by marriage and my comrades should rise in rebellion against him.\n\nAt length I got away and arrived at the island of the Vizier 'Aly. My wife was in great distress, and wished to return. I repudiated her and left her there, and wrote this news to the Vizier, for she was the mother of his son's wife. I repudiated also the wife to whom I had fixed the term (for my return) and sent for a slave girl I was fond of. Meanwhile we sailed through the midst of the islands, from one group to another.\n\nOf Women who have only One Breast.\n\nIn one of the islands I saw a woman who had only one breast. She was mother of two daughters, of whom one resembled her exactly, and the other had two breasts, only that one was large and full of milk, the other small and contained none. I was astonished at the conformation of these women.\n\nWe arrived in course at another of these islands which was small, and had a solitary house, occupied by a weaver,* a married man and father of a family. He possessed small coco trees, and a little barque,\u2020 which served him for fishing and visiting the other islands when he wished: on his islet were also small bananas trees. We saw there none of the birds of the continent, except two crows, which flew in front of us on our arrival and circled round our ship. I truly envied the lot of this man, and made a vow that if his island should belong to me, I would retire to it until the inevitable term should arrive for me.\n\n* Mats, and some cloths, are woven in Huvad\u00fa (Suv\u00e1diva) Atol; the former on the islands Gadd\u00fa, Havara Tinad\u00fa, and Gemand-furhi.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 M. mas odi.\u2014B.\nI next arrived at the island of Molo\u00fbc,* where I found the ship belonging to the captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem in which I had resolved to sail to the Coromandel Coast. That person came to visit me along with his companions, and they entertained me at a fine feast. The Vizier had written in my favor an order requiring them to give me at this island 120 bosto\u00fb (v.s.p.11) of cowries, 20 goblets of athou\u00e2n\u2020 or coco-honey, and to add to that every day a certain quantity of betel, arecanuts, and fish. I remained at Molo\u00fbc 70 days, and married two wives there. Molo\u00fbc is one of the fairest islands to see, being verdant and fertile. Among other marvellous things to be seen there, I remarked that a branch cut off one of the trees there, and planted in the ground or on a wall, will cover itself with leaves and become itself a tree. I observed also that the pomegranate tree there ceases not to bear fruit the whole year round. The inhabitants of this island were afraid that the captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem was going to harry them at his departure. They therefore wanted to seize the arms which his ship contained, and to keep them until the day of his departure. A dispute arose on this subject, and we returned to Mahal, but did not disembark. I wrote to the Vizier informing him of what had taken place. He sent a written order to the effect that there was no ground for seizing the arms of the crew. We then returned to Molo\u00fbc, and left it again in the middle of the month of Rab\u00ed the second of the year 745 (26th August A.D. 1344). In the month of Shab\u00e1n of the same year (December, 1344), died the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin. The Sultana was with child by him and was delivered after his death. The Vizier \u2019Abd-Allah took her to wife.\n\n* Molo\u00fbc:\u2014Moluk, the chief island of Moluk Atol, is in lat. 2\u00b0 57' N. The Admiralty Chart says that it possesses good water. [More probably Fu\u00e2 Mulaku Island, which lies detached a little S.E. of the centre of the Equatorial Channel (lat. 0\u00b0 17', S.) between Huvad\u00fb and Ad\u00fb Atols. Ibn Bat\u00fbta had already \u201csailed through the midst of the islands, from one group to another.\u201d\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Athou\u00e2n:\u2014Above at p. 22 coco-honey is called korb\u00e2ny. In Moura\u2019s edition of Ibn Bat\u00fbta (Lisbon, 1855), the word appears as alatuan.\nAs for us, we sailed on, though without an experienced pilot. The distance which separates the Maldives from the Coromandel Coast is three days' sail. We were for nine days under sail, and on the 9th we went on shore at the island of Ceylon. We perceived the mountain of S\u00e9rendib raised in the air like a column of smoke. When we came near the island, the mariners said, \"This port is not in the country of a Sultan in whose dominions the merchants can go in all safety; it is in the country of the Sultan Airy Chacarouaty* who is one of the unjust and perverse. He has ships engaged in piracy on the high seas.\" Wherefore we feared to land at his port, but, the wind rising, we were in danger of being swamped, and I said to the Captain, \"Put me ashore and I will get for you a safe-conduct from this Sultan.\" He did as I requested, and put me out on the beach. The idolaters advanced to meet us and said, \"Who are you?\" I apprized them that I was the brother-in-law and friend of the Sultan of Coromandel, that I was on my way to pay him a visit, and that what was on board the ship was destined for a present to that prince. The natives went to their Sovereign and communicated to him my reply. He sent for me, and I presented myself before him at the town of Batthalah (Puttalam)\u2020 which was his capital.\n\n* Airy Chacarouaty.\u2014This seems to be the (?) P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan prince, \"Aareya Chakra Warti,\" mentioned in Pridham (Ceylon, Vol I., p. 78), who, after 1371 A.D., conquered the northern half of the Island, and took King Wikrama captive, but was defeated by the Adigar Alakeswara, and possibly the same Malabar Prince captured and put to death by Prince \"Sapoomal Cumara.\"\u2014See Upham's R\u00e1jawali, p.264, 269. [A correspondent writes:\u2014\"The name identifies no individual. All the Kings of Jaffna seem to have been called Ariya or Ariyan\u2014an old title in India. See the Khandagiri rock inscription, and one of those over the Manikpura cave at Udayagiri (Cunningham's Corpus Insc. Indic., Vol. I.) Jaffna at this period (A.D. 1344) was, if the Vaipava M\u0101lai can be trusted, under the rule of Kunavirasinka Ariyan.\"\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Batthalah.\u2014This town has been identified with Puttalam by Lee, Tennent, the French Editor, and Col. Yule, successively; but, it seems to me, without sufficient authority. The \u0101 of Batthalah is against it; so too the want\na neat little place, surrounded by a wall and bastions of wood. All the neighbouring shore was covered with trunks of cinnamon trees, torn up by the torrents. This wood was collected on the beach, and formed as it were hillocks. The inhabitants of Coromandel and of Malabar take it away without payment, save only that in return for this favor they make a present to the Sultan of\n\nof corroborative evidence of the existence of Puttalam as a town of any importance at this period, and the want of any river in its neighbourhood answering to the \"torrents\" spoken of by the traveller. This last point, and the doubtful existence of cinnamon so far north as Puttalam, are the only difficulties raised by Tennent (Vol. I., p. 580). The site of Batthalah has to be found with a full consideration of the cinnamon question, and, of the site of M\u00e9nar Mendely, the town at which Ibn Bat\u00fata: first halts on his journey towards the Peak. With his usual laborious care Tennent (Vol. I., p. 596) has examined all the early authorities known to him, and concludes that the text here gives the first mention of cinnamon as a product of Ceylon. Col. Yule, however (Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 255), points out that two previous notices of it exist, one in Kazwini (circa A.D. 1275), the other in a letter from John of Montecorvino (Ethel's Kazwini, 229; Cathay, 213.)\n\nThe account given by our traveller shews that it was not as yet cultivated, and perhaps that the \"trunks\" seen by him were not those of the valuable variety of later days, but of the common indigenous cassia. I am not aware whether the cultivation, or growth, of cinnamon positively ceases at Chilaw, as seems to be the common opinion: but, even if this be true of the Ceylon cinnamon of commerce, it may not be so of the indigenous plant, and the area of production may be more limited now than in the 4th century. Ribeyro (Lee's edn., p. 15), says \"there is a forest of it 12 leagues in extent between Chilaw and the pagoda of Tenevary,\" without saying that Chilaw is the northern limit: the French translator (at p. 11) in his note, remarks 'that it is only found between Grudumal\u00e9 and Tenevar\u00e9.' Now the promontory of Kutiraimalai is a considerable distance north of Puttalam: and I have little doubt that the French translator had good authority for the assertion. The remaining difficulty, that of the \"torrents,\" inclines me to believe that the site of Batthalah was probably further north, near the mouth of the Kal\u00e1-oya, where the free access to the sea by the passage between Kalpi\u1e6diya and K\u00e1rativu would seem to designate a more suitable situation for a Prince, whose strength lay in ships.\n\nIt now remains to fix M\u00e9nar Mendely, which has been identified by preceding commentators, and not unnaturally, with the Minneri Mundal of\nstuffs and such things. Between Coromandel and the island of Ceylon there is a distance of a day and a night. There is also found in this island plenty of brazil-wood,* as well as Indian aloes, called alcalakhy (perhaps from the Greek \u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u2020), but which does not resemble the kam\u00e1ry or the k\u00e1kouly.\u00a7 We shall speak of them hereafter.\n\nOf the Sultan of Ceylon.\n\nHe is called Airy Chacarouaty, and he is a powerful King upon the sea. I saw in one day, while I was on the Coromandel\n\nArrowsmith's map, adopted by Tennent. This place is represented as upon the Calpentyn [Kalpi\u1e6diya] peninsular, due west of Puttalam, and I could never account for the traveller taking it on his route to the Peak. I am now informed that no such place exists. There is, however, on the present road, about half way between Puttalam and Chilaw, a village called Muntal or Mundal, four miles north of the Battul-oya, which seems to me to suit the description of the traveller in every way. M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely was the frontier town of the Batth\u00e1lah Prince, as Bender S\u00e9ldou\u00e1t (Chilaw) must (from the term Bender) have been to the Singhalese King of the South: and the low jungles of the neighbourhood have always been a favourite haunt of wild buffaloes. By the Census of 1871, I find Mundal and T\u00e1ndivila together had a population of 128, and Paniya Muntal, a neighbouring village, of 80. In conclusion, I have to state that the correspondent who has indicated the places on the Peak route, is of opinion that Batth\u00e1lah is Jaffna and M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely, Mann\u00e1r. I have been unable, after due consideration, to adopt his views, nor could I state them here at sufficient length. I trust, however, that if he has no objection he will formulate them in a separate paper for the use of the Society.\n\n* Brazil-wood:\u2014i.e., \"sapan.\" \"'They have brazil-wood, much the best in the world,' Kazwini names it, and Ribeyro (Lee's edn., p. 16) does the like.\" \u2014Yule, Marco Polo, Vol. II., pp. 254, 256.\n\n\u2020 Alcalakhy:\u2014Mr. L. Nell considers the surmise of the French editors correct. \"Ibn Bat\u00fata evidently uses the Greek term agallokon corresponding to the Latin Excaecaria agallocha. The Socotrine variety of aloes is the usual medicinal species. Two indigenous species are known in India, the Aloe Indica and the Aloe litoralis.

There were in the port eight ships belonging to the Sultan of the country and destined to make the voyage to Yemen. The sovereign gave orders to make preparations, and assembled people to guard his vessels. When the Sinhalese despaired of finding an opportunity of seizing them, they said, \"We have only come to protect the vessels belonging to us, which also must go to Yemen.\"\n\nWhen I entered the presence of the idolater Sultan, he rose, and made me sit by his side, and spoke to me with the greatest good-will. \"Let your comrades,\" said he, \"land in all safety, and be my guests until they leave. There is an alliance between me and the Sultan of Coromandel.\" Then he gave orders to have me lodged, and I remained with him for three days, in great consideration, which increased every day. He understood the Persian tongue, and much did he relish all I told him of foreign Kings and countries. I entered his presence one day when he had by him a quantity of pearls, which had been brought from the fishery in his dominions. The servants of the prince were sorting the precious from those which were not so. He said to me, \"Have you seen the pearl fishery in the countries whence you have come?\" \"Yes,\" I answered, \"I have seen it in the island of Ke\u00efs, and in that of Kech, which belong to Ibn Assaou\u00e2m\u00e9ly.\" \"I have heard of them,\" replied he; and then took up some pearls and added, \"Are there at that island any pearls equal to these?\" I said, \"I have seen none so good.\" My answer pleased him, and he said, \"They are yours: do not blush,\" added he, \"and ask of me anything you desire.\" I replied, \"I have no other desire, since I have arrived in this island, but to visit the illustrious Foot of Adam.\" The people of the country call the first man b\u00e2b\u00e2 (father) and Eve, m\u00e2m\u00e2 (mother). \"That is easy enough,\" answered he, \"We shall send some one to conduct you.\" \"That is what I wish,\"\nsaid I, and then added, \"The vessel in which I have come will go in safety to Ma'bar and on my return, you will send me in your ships.\" \"By all means\" said he.\n\nWhen I reported this to the Captain of the ship, he said, \"I will not go till you have returned, even though I should have to wait a year for you.\" I made known this answer to the Sultan, and he said, \"The Captain shall be my guest until your return.\" He gave me a palanquin, which his slaves bore upon their backs, and sent with me four of those djoguis who are accustomed to undertake the pilgrimage annually to the Foot; he added to the party three Br\u00e1hmins, ten others of his friends, and fifteen men to carry the provisions. As for water, it is found in abundance on the route.\n\nOn the day of our departure, we encamped near a river, which we crossed in a ferry-boat formed of bamboos. Thence we took our way to M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely, a fine town, situated at the extremity of the Sultan's territory, the people of which treated us to an excellent repast. This consisted of young buffaloes, taken in chase in the neighbouring forest and brought in alive, rice, melted butter, fish, chickens and milk. We did not see in this town a single Musalm\u00e1n, except a native of Khorassan, who had remained on account of sickness, and who now accompanied us. We left for Bender S\u00e9l\u00e1ou\u00e2t,* a little town, and after quitting it we traversed some rough country, much of it under water. There were numbers of elephants there, which do no manner of harm to pilgrims, nor to strangers, and that is by the holy influence of Shaikh Abou 'Abd Allah, son of Khafif, the first who opened this way to visiting the Foot. Up to that time the infidels prevented the Musalm\u00e1ns from accomplishing the pilgrimage,\n\n* Bender S\u00e9l\u00e1ou\u00e2t, i.e., Chilaw.\u2014The fact that it was called Bender, implies, I think, that it contained a custom-house or store-house (V. s. p. 10), and was a frontier town of the King who ruled south of \"Aareya Chakrawarti.\" This is confirmed by the description of M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely as the frontier town of \"Aareya Chakrawarti.\"\nharried them, and would not eat or deal with them. But when\nthe adventure, which we have recounted in the first part of these\nVoyages (Tome II, pp. 80, 81) had happened to the Shaikh Abou\n'Abd Allah, that is to say, the murder of all his companions by\nthe elephants, his own preservation, and the manner in which the\nelephant carried him on its back, from that time on the idolaters\nhave respected the Musalmans, have permitted them to enter\ntheir houses and to eat with them.* They also place confidence\nin them, as regards their women and children. Even to this\nday they venerate in the highest degree the above-named Shaikh,\nand call him 'the Great Shaikh.'\n\nMeanwhile we reached the town of Conac\u00e1r,\u2020 the residence\n\n* \"In this statement Ibn Batuta is fully borne out by Robert Knox, who\nsays, speaking of the charity of the Sinhalese, in his Chapter 'concerning\ntheir religious doctrines, opinions, and practices,' Part iii., Ch. 5, 'Nor are\nthey charitable only to the poor of their own nation; but, as I said, to others\nand particularly to the Moorish beggars, who are Mahometans by religion;\nthese have a temple in Kandy. A certain former King gave this temple this\nprivilege\u2014that every freeholder should contribute a ponnam (fanam, 1\u00bdd.) to it;\nand these Moors go to every house in the land to receive it [except in\nDolosb\u00e1g\u00e9]; and, if the house be shut, they have power to break it open, and\ntake of goods to the value of it. They come very confidently when they beg,\nand say they come to fulfil the peoples' charity; and the people do liberally re-\nlieve them for charity's sake...... These Moors pilgrims have many pieces of\nland given to them by well disposed persons, out of charity, where they build\nhouses and live; and this land becomes theirs from generation to generation for\never.'\" (Skeen, Adam's Peak, p. 285.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Conac\u00e1r\u2014Dr. Lee identifies this place with Gampola, and he is followed\nby Pridham and Tennent. According to Turnour's Epitome, Gampola did not\nbecome the capital till after 1347, while Ibn Bat\u00fata is writing of the end of\n1344. The Sinhalese monarchy was then in a very troublous condition, and\nit is difficult to decide upon the locality of Conac\u00e1r.\u2014[Skeen (Adam's Peak,\np. 286) hesitates between Gampola and Ratnapura, the place where gems are\nchiefly found.] Col. Yule (Cathay, p. 423, Note) suggests that it was Kurun\u00e9gala.\n\n[Mr. L. Nell writes:\u2014\"Sir Emerson Tennent did not hesitate to identify\nthis Sovereign with Bhuwan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV., whose capital was Ganga\u015bripura, the\nmodern Gampola. This identification was based on the Chronological Table of\nof the principal Sovereign of the Island. It is built in a gully, between two mountains, near a great vale, called 'the vale of precious stones,'* because gems are found in it. Outside this town is seen the Mosque of the Shaikh Othm\u00e2n of Shir\u00e1z, surnamed Ch\u00e2ouch (the usher). The King and inhabitants of the place visit him, and treat him with high consideration. He used\n\nTurnour; but there are two grounds to doubt this identification. In the first place Turnour admitted an anachronism about A.D. 1347, the date assumed for the accession of Bhuwan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV, because the terms of three reigns immediately preceding this Sovereign are not given. Secondly, the capital of Kin\u00e1r or Kon\u00e1r is described as situate in a valley between two hills in a 'vale' (or according to Lee 'bay') in which gems were found. The term Conac\u00e1r, sounds like an Arab attempt to reproduce the name Kurun\u00e9gala. Ibn Bat\u00fata wrote in A.D. 1344; according to Turnour, Gampola did not become the capital till after A.D. 1347. We are thus thrown back to a period before the accession of Bhuvan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV. There is an old native route between Puttal\u00e1m and Kurun\u00e9gala. The route from Puttal\u00e1m to Gampola direct has not been known.\" The correspondent already quoted notes:\u2014\"In tracing the traveller beyond Chilaw reference is necessary to Ceylon history. Incomparably the best authority for this period is the Nik\u00e1ya Sangraha, which was composed about 1396 A.D. (Turnour states 1357 A.D., but that is manifestly wrong, as the author describes all the Kings up to Bhuvanaika B\u00e1hu V., who came to the throne 1914 A.B., showing Turnour's date to be wrong by 7 years): the corresponding portion of the Mah\u00e1va\u00f1so was written in 1758 A.D., and is not of anything like the same authority.\n\n\"The King of Sinhalese Ceylon in 1344 A.D. was Bhuvanaika B\u00e1hu IV. He ascended the throne 1342 A.D., and did not move the seat of Government to Gampola from Kurun\u00e9gala until 1346 A.D. Consequently Con\u00e1c\u00e1r must be (as indeed one would expect from the sound) Ibn Bat\u00fata's way of rendering Kurun\u00e9gala. It lies 'between two mountains,' the Handrukkanda range and the Yakdessa range.\"\u2014B.]\n\n* \"The valley of the Mah\u00e1-oya which is within 10 miles of Kurun\u00e9gala. The word 'Manikam' used by the traveller (Lee's version) occurs in two villages in this valley Menik-divela and Menik-kadawara. The valley was celebrated for precious stones (see Kadaim pota), and the latter was a place of some notoriety in the 16th century, and figures in Tennent's Portuguese map as Manicavare: it is near Polgahawela.\"\u2014B.\nto serve as a guide for those who go to see the Foot. When he had his hand and foot cut off, his sons and slaves became guides in his stead. The cause of his being so mutilated was that he killed a cow. Now the law of the Hind\u00fas ordains that one who has killed a cow should be massacred in like wise, or enclosed in its skin and burnt. The Shaikh 'Othm\u00e2n being respected by those people, they contented themselves with cutting off his hand and foot, and granted to him, as a present, the dues levied at a certain market.\n\nOf the Sultan of Conac\u00e2r.\n\nHe is called by the name Con\u00e2r,* and possesses the white elephant. I have never seen in the world another white elephant. The King rides him on solemn occasions, and attaches to the forehead of this animal large jewels. It happened to this Monarch that the nobles of his empire rebelled against him, blinded him, and made his son King. As for him, he still lives in this town, deprived of his sight.\n\n* Con\u00e2r\u2014According to Turnour's list of Sinhalese monarchs, the King at this time, 1344\u201345, would be Wijaya B\u00e1hu the Vth. Col. Yule (Cathay, p. 423 Note) thinks Con\u00e2r or Kun\u00e2r is the Sanskrit Kumvar, 'prince.'\n\n[\u201cCol. Yule\u2019s guess\u201d adds Mr. Nell \u201cat the name of the Sovereign \u2018Con\u00e2r,\u2019 as identical with \u2018Kumvar,\u2019 the Sanskrit for \u2018Prince\u2019, comes near what I conceive to be the fact. It will be seen that the Arab traveller describes a Mahommedan Mosque, outside the town of this Prince. Now, a Mahommedan Prince, Vasthimi Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, did reign with great popularity in Kurun\u00e9gala. His romantic story is a local tradition in that town. He is said to have been treacherously murdered by the Buddhist priests of a temple on Et\u00e1gala. They invited him to be present at a religious ceremony and suddenly pushed him over the precipice [Pridham, Vol. II., p. 649]. Offerings are made upon a mound on the road to the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, which probably marks the spot where the Prince was interred, or the Shaikh referred to hereafter. No native will venture to pass the spot after dark without company, for the spirit of Gala-Band\u00e2ra, on horseback, is supposed to ride about the neighbourhood. The Court is said to have been immediately removed to Dambadeniya after this assassination, on the ground that the sanctity of the city had been polluted by a Mahommedan usurper.]\nOF THE PRECIOUS STONES.\n\nThe admirable gems called albahram\u00e1n (rubies or carbuncles) are only found at this town. Some of them are found in the vale and these are the most precious in the eyes of the natives; others are extracted from the earth. Gems are met with in all localities in the island of Ceylon. In this country the whole of the soil is private property. An individual buys a portion of it, and digs to find gems. He comes across stones white-branched: in the interior of these stones the gem is hidden. The owner sends it to the lapidaries, who scrape it until it is separated from the stones which conceal it. There are the red (rubies), the yellow (topazes), and the blue (sapphires) which they call ne\u00eflem (n\u00eelem).* It is a rule of the natives that precious stones whose value amounts to 100 fanams are reserved for the Sultan, who gives their price and takes them for himself. As for those of an inferior price, they remain the property of the finders.\u2020 One hundred fanams are equivalent to six pieces of gold.\n\nIt is probable that the priest, who compiled the history referred to by Turnour, has purposely omitted the name of this Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, thus causing the anachronism noticed by Turnour. C\u00e1sie Chetty conjectures that this Prince was the son of Wijaya B\u00e1hu V. by his Moorish Queen Vasthimi and this is quite consistent with the above theory. It is also stated by Ibn Bat\u00fata that the King and inhabitants of Conac\u00e1r used to visit the Mahommedan Shaikh 'Othm\u00e1n of Shiraz at his Mosque, and to treat him with great respect. It is significant that the Prince of Conac\u00e1r is not mentioned in the French translation as 'an infidel King', as Ibn Bat\u00fata seems to be careful to do in all instances of those who were not his co-religionist. The French translation also describes this King as deposed by his subjects and deprived of his sight, whilst his son was placed on the throne. This son may have been Vasthimi Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1. The silence of the Siyhalese historians has, however, left all this in doubt.\"\u2014B.]\n\n* Ne\u00eflem = S. nila.\n\n\u2020 Barbosa on the other hand says that all the Ceylon gemming is done by the agents of the King, and on his behalf. The stones are brought to him, and his lapidaries select the best, and sell the rest to the merchants (Stanley's\nAll the women in the island of Ceylon possess necklaces of precious stones of divers colors: they wear them also at their hands and feet, in the form of bracelets and khalkh\u00e2ls (anklets). The concubines of the Sultan make a network of gems and wear it on their heads. I have seen on the forehead of the white elephant seven of these precious stones, each of which was larger than a hen's egg. I likewise saw in possession of Airy Chacarouaty a ruby dish, as large as the palm of the hand, containing oil of aloes. I expressed my astonishment at this dish, but the Sultan said, \"We have objects of the same material larger than that.\"*\n\nWe left Conac\u00e1r, and halted at a cave called by the name of Ostha Mahmoud Allouiry. This person was one of the best of men: he had excavated this cave in the mountain side, near a little vale. Quitting this place, we encamped near the vale called Khaour bouzneh ('monkey vale'). Bouzneh (Persian bo\u00fbzineh) designates the same as alkoroud (plural of alkird, 'monkey') in Arabic.\n\nOf the Monkeys.\n\nThese animals are very numerous in the mountains: they are of a black colour, and have long tails. Those of the male sex have beards like men. The Shaikh Othm\u00e2n, his son and other persons, have related to me that the monkeys have a Chief whom they obey like a Sovereign. He binds round his head a wreath of the leaves of trees, and supports himself with a staff. Four\n\nBarbosa, Hakt. Soc., p. 169.) Ludovico di Varthema (A.D. 1505) says:\u2014\"And when a merchant wishes to find these jewels, he is obliged first to speak to the King, and to purchase a braza of the said land in every direction (which braza is called a molan [? amu\u00f1am], and to purchase it for five ducats. And then when he digs the said land, a man always remains there on the part of the King, and if any jewel be found there which exceeds ten carats, the King claims it for himself and leaves all the rest free.\"\u2014Badger's Varthema, Hakt. Soc., p. 190.\n\n* See further, as to the wonderful gems of that period, Marco Polo, Bk. III., Ch. xiv., and Col. Yule's note thereto.\nmonkeys, bearing staves, march on his right and left, and, when the chief is seated, they stand behind him. His wife and little ones come and sit before him every day. The other monkeys come and squat at some distance from him; then one of the four above-mentioned gives them the word and they withdraw; after which, each brings a banana, or a lime, or some such fruit. The King of the monkeys, his little ones, and the four chief monkeys then eat. A certain djogui related to me that he had seen these four monkeys before their Chief, occupied in beating another monkey with a stick, after which they plucked his hair.*\n\nTrustworthy persons have reported to me that when one of these monkeys has got possession of a young girl, she is unable to escape his lust. An inhabitant of the island of Ceylon has told me that he had a monkey, and when one of his daughters entered the house, the animal followed her. She cried him off, but he did her violence. \"We ran to her aid,\" continued the speaker, \"and seeing the monkey embracing her, we killed him.\"\n\nThen we took our departure for 'the vale of bamboos,'\u2020 where Abou 'Abd Allah, son of Khafif, found two rubies, which he\n\n* \"This is evidently a confused account of the Vedd\u00e1s and their customs.

It lives upon trees and herbs in the neighbourhood of water, and when a man approaches, it pounces upon him.

Thenceforward it was called Pal\u00e1-bat-dola, 'the place [rill] of rice and vegetables,' a name which it has ever since retained.\" (Skeen, loc., cit. p. 147, 154-5.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 \"An ascent of some fifty feet brings the pilgrim to the crest of the ridge of which the Dharmma-r\u00e1ja-gala forms a part.

It is said that a certain pilgrim was passing this neighbourhood, and that the leeches fastened upon him. He remained impassive, and did not squeeze lime-juice upon them: and so all his blood was sucked and he died.* The name of this man was B\u00e1b\u00e2 Kho\u00fbzy, and there is there a cave which bears his name. From this place we took our way to 'the seven caves,' then to 'the hill of Iskandar' (Alexander). There is there a grotto called of Alisfah\u00e2ny, a spring of water, and an uninhabited mansion, beneath which is the bay called 'the place of bathing of the contemplative.' At the same place is seen 'the orange cave' and 'the cave of the Sultan.' Near the latter is the gateway (derw\u00e2zeh in Persian, b\u00e2b in Arabic) of the mountain.\u2020\n\n* Dr. Lee has this note:\u2014\"Knox describes these leeches as being rather troublesome than dangerous. His words are:\u2014'There is a sort of leaches of the nature of ours, onely differing in colour and bigness; for they are of a dark reddish colour like the skin of bacon, and as big as a goose-quill; in length some two or three inches. At first, when they are young, they are no bigger than a horse-hair, so that they can scarce be seen. In dry weather none of them appear, but immediately upon the fall of rains, the grass and woods are full of them. These leaches seize upon the legs of travellers......Some, therefore, will tie a piece of lemon and salt in a rag, and fasten it unto a stick, and ever and anon strike it upon their legs to make the leaches drop off: others will scrape them off with a reed, cut flat and sharp in the fashion of a knife,' &c.\u2014Ceylon, p. 25.

About fifty or sixty feet below, he saw a clearing in a small dell, in the centre of which was a square kind of tank; and this dell he determined to examine on the occasion of his third visit. The result of the examination was, that he identified the station H\u00e9ramitip\u00e1na, and this place, as that described by Ibn Bat\u00fata, as 'the ridge of Alexander, in which\nOf the Mountain of Serendib (Adam's Peak).\n\nIt is one of the highest mountains in the world: we saw it from the open sea, when we were distant from it upwards of nine days' march. While we were making the ascent, we saw the clouds above us, hiding from view the lower parts of it. There are upon this mountain many trees of kinds which do not cast their leaves, flowers of divers colors, and a red rose as large as the palm of the hand.* It is alleged that on this rose is an inscription in which one may read the name of God Most High and that of his Prophet.\u2020 On the mountain are two paths leading to the Foot of Adam. The one is known by the name of\n\nis a cave and a well of water,' at the entrance to the mountain Serendib. The old Moor's account is somewhat confused, his notes or recollections not always carrying his facts exactly in their due order; but half way down the descent, on the left hand, is a well, excavated in the rock, in which we found about five feet of water, and which swarmed with tadpoles. Possibly Ibn Bat\u00fata found it in the same condition, for he speaks of the well, at the entrance, full of fish, of which 'no one takes any.' At the bottom of the dell is a cleared space; in the centre of this is a square tank or well, the sides of which are formed of blocks of stone, six or eight feet long. Beyond this, almost facing the descent, some twenty feet up the opposite mountain's side, is a cave. To this my companion and I forced our way through the jungle, and came to the conclusion that this was the cave of Khizr, where, Ibn Bat\u00fata says, 'the pilgrims leave their provisions, and whatever else they have, and then ascend about two miles to the top of the mountain, to the place of (Adam's) foot.' In the preceding sentence he says, 'Near this (cave) and on each side of the path, is a cistern cut in the rock.' Now, no other place that we saw, or heard of\u2014and we were particularly minute in our inquiries\u2014answers to such a description. There are the two wells, and the cave; and the distance to the foot-print is also pretty fairly estimated.\" (Skeen, loc. cit., pp. 226-7.)\u2014B.\n\n* \"Gigantic rhododendrons overhang the wall on the eastern side of the Peak. Their bending trunks seem, to the Buddhist mind, to bow to the foot-print; and to offer, in homage and adoration, their wealth of crowning crimson flowers to the pedal impress of the founder of their faith.\" (Skeen, loc. cit., p. 200.).\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 The pious Musalm\u00e1ns in this age of faith found their creed proclaimed by nature itself not only on the flowers of the rhododendron, but on the leaves\n'the Father's path' and the other by that of 'the Mother's path. By these terms are Adam and Eve designated. The Mother's route is an easy one, and by it the pilgrims return; but any one who took it for the ascent would be regarded as not having done the pilgrimage. The Father's path is rough and difficult of ascent. At the foot of the mountain, at the place of the gateway, is a grotto also bearing the name of Iskandar, and a spring of water.\n\nof the fig-tree. Before he went to the Maldives, Ibn Bat\u00fata was at Deh Fatian (? D\u00e9vipatam), a town on the Malabar Coast, where he records the existence of an extraordinary tree near the mosque. \"I saw that the mosque was situated, near a verdant and beautiful tree; whose leaves resembled those of the fig, except that they were glossy. It was surrounded by a wall and had near it a niche or oratory, where I made a prayer of two genuflexions. The name of this tree with the natives of the country was derakht (dirakht) acch\u00e9h\u00e1dah 'the tree of the testimony.' I was informed at this place that every year, on the arrival of autumn, there fell from this tree a solitary leaf, whose colour passed first to yellow and then to red. On this leaf were written, with the pen of the Divine power, the words following 'There is no God but God, and Mohammed is the apostle of God.' The juris-consult Hou\u00e7ain and many other trustworthy men told me that they had seen this leaf, and had read the inscription upon it. Hou\u00e7ain added that, when the time arrived for it to fall, trusted men from among the Musalm\u00e1ns and the idolaters sat down under the tree. When the leaf fell the Musalm\u00e1ns took one half of it, while the other was deposited in the treasury of the idolater Sultan. The inhabitants preserve it for the purpose of curing the sick. This tree caused the conversion of the grandfather of Coucil [the Sultan at the time of his visit] to the faith, and he it was who built the mosque and the tank [from its description similar to the Sinhalese pokuna]. This prince could read the Arabic characters: and when he deciphered the inscription and understood what it contained, he embraced the true faith and professed it entirely. His story is preserved in tradition among the Hind\u00fas. The juris-consult Hou\u00e7ain told me that one of the children of this King returned to idolatry after the death of his father, governed with injustice, and ordered the tree to be torn up from the roots. The order was executed, and no vestige of the tree was left. Nevertheless it began to shoot again, and became as fair a tree as it had been before. As for the idolater, he came to die full soon thereafter.\" (Tome IV., pp. 85-87.) I have quoted this passage\nThe people of old have cut in the rock steps of a kind, by help of which you ascend; fixed into them are iron stanchions, to which are suspended chains, so that one making the ascent can hold on to them.* These chains are ten in number, thus:\u2014two at the foot of the mountain [Peak] at the place of the gate-way; seven in contiguity after the two first; and the tenth, that is \u2018the chain of the profession of faith (Isl\u00e1m),\u2019 so named because a person who has reached it and looks back at the foot of the mountain will be seized with hallucinations, and, for fear of falling, he will recite the words \u201cI bear witness that there is no God but God, and that Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d When you have passed this chain, you will find a path badly kept. From the tenth chain to \u2018the cave of Khidhr\u2019\u2020 is seven miles. This cave is situate at an open place, and it has near it a spring of water full of fish, and this also bears the name of Khidhr. No one may catch these fish. Near the cave are two basins cut in the rock, one on each\n\nat length as an illustration of the habit of missionary religions to annex and adapt the shrines and idols of local worship. The fig-tree in question was, I have little doubt, a b\u00f3 tree, surrounded by a wall and altars like the Mah\u00e1 Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 at Anur\u00e1dhapura. It is likely to have been credited with healing powers, and so to have preserved its influence in the locality from the decay of Buddhism in Malabar, through the centuries of Br\u00e1hmanish reaction, until at length the followers of the Prophet contrived by means of the fancied inscription to control the superstitious faith of its devotees. The similar attempt of the Muhammadans to annex the \u015ar\u012b-p\u00e1da of Samanala, by claiming it as the foot-print of Adam, has done nothing towards the conversion of the S\u00edghalese. The Hind\u00fas claim it as that of S\u00edva or Vish\u1e47u, according to their sect. (Skeen\u2019s Adam\u2019s Peak, p. 27.)\n\n* These chains are spoken of by Marco Polo in the previous century. \u201cFurthermore you must know that on this Island of Seilan there is an exceeding high mountain; it rises right up so steep and precipitous that no one could ascend it, were it not that they have taken and fixed to it several great massive iron chains, so disposed that by help of these men are able to mount to the top.\u201d\u2014Yule, Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 256.\n\n\u2020 See, as to the identity of this saint or prophet, Dr. Lee\u2019s note, and Sell, \u2018Faith of Isl\u00e1m,\u2019 p. 260.\u2014B.\nside of the path.

The Foot is sunk in the stone, in such wise that its site is quite depressed; its length is eleven spans.* The inhabitants of China came here formerly; they have cut out of the stone the mark of the great toe, and of that next to it, and have deposited this fragment in a temple of the town of Ze\u00eftoun (Tseu-thoung) whither men repair from the most distant provinces.\u2020 In the rock whereon is the print of the foot, are cut nine holes, in which the idolater pilgrims place gold, precious stones and pearls.

Ribeyro, Liv. i., C. xxiii., says, \"two palms long and eight inches broad.\" See further Yule's Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 261. Lieut. Malcolm, the first Englishman who made the ascent, (1815), says the impression is in kabook or ironstone. [\"The heel is much higher than the toes, and the artificiality of the whole is palpable. A thick raised edging of cement marks the rude outline of a foot 5 ft. 7 in. long, and 2 ft. 7 in. broad at the point where the heel begins to curve. The interstices between the toes are also formed of cement, and the whole of the markings of the foot every now and again need repair.

I have given it some attention and I think it most probable that he went from Kurun\u00e9gala towards the mountains and ascended Adam's Peak from the pilgrim's path in Maskeliya. My reasons are\u2014\n\n(i.) The extreme limit of the inhabited region was evidently a long way from the Peak\u2014this would be true on the Maskeliya side, but not true in the low country, as there were villages comparatively near the Peak.\n\n(ii.) From the traveller's description he evidently went into the mountains soon after leaving Kurun\u00e9gala.\n\n(iii.) The names of places described are found on this route, and on no other.\n\n(iv.) The traveller describes two routes as practicable. The 'father's path' as rough and difficult, the 'mother's path' as easy and the way of return. He went by the former, which is evidently the way through the hills and the forest of Maskeliya.\n\nThe most convenient pass from Kurun\u00e9gala to the mountains runs past Girih\u00e1gama, and there is a cave in the mountain side near a little vale (exactly as described) which still retains the name Galagedara ('cave abode').\nof *djoguis*, who did not leave the foot of the hill, waiting for the fall of the leaves of this tree. It is planted in a place where there is no possibility of getting at it. The idolaters retail some fictions concerning it; among them, this\u2014whoever eats of its leaves recovers his youth, even should he be an old man. But that is false.\n\nUnder this mountain is a great vale where precious stones are found. Its waters appear to the eye extremely blue. From this we marched for two days as far as the town of *Din\u00e9wer*, a large one, built near the sea and inhabited by merchants.* In a vast temple is seen an idol bearing the same name as the town. In this temple are upwards of a thousand Br\u00e1hmins and *djoguis*,\n\n*Monkey vale* I cannot identify; there is a place in Dolosb\u00e1g\u00e9 called *Wanduru-m\u00e1na* (*monkey measure*).\n\n*The vale of bamboos (or reeds)* I should guess to be *Rambukpitiya* in Upper Bulatgama; it is of some antiquity and importance, and lies right on the road to Adam\u2019s Peak.\n\nThe spot where \u2019Ab\u00fa Abd-Allah found his two rubies is probably even yet to be identified by the name *Menik-hambantoja* (*the gem ford of the foreign trader*) on the pilgrim\u2019s route. *The house of the old woman* (*A\u2019chchi-gedara?*) has probably not survived till our time. The rest of the route lay through \u2018the wilderness of the Peak,\u2019 containing no inhabitants but hermits. The Royal hermit called *S\u00e9bik* I should guess to be \u2018Raja Savlu (or Sakra) Vije Bahu,\u2019 afterwards father of the *\u015ari-Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI.* (Valentyn, p. 71, and K\u00e1vyas\u00e9kara, 89.)

A Musalm\u00e1n there, called the Ship-Captain Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, entertained us at his house. We then took the route for the town of Calenbou (Colombo) one of the largest and most beautiful in the island of S\u00e9rendib. There dwells the Vizier, prince of the sea, Dj\u00e1lesty,\u2020 who has there about 500 Abyssinians. Three days after leaving Calenbou, we arrived at Batth\u00e1lah, of which mention is made above. We visited the Sultan of whom I have spoken. I found the Captain Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm awaiting me, and we left for the country of Ma\u2019bar.\n\n[Ibn Bat\u00fata and his friends met with tempestuous weather, and were wrecked on the Coast of Coromandel, probably near the mouth of the Patar.

He landed at Perivilis (? Barberyn) \u201cover against Paradise. Here a certain tyrant, by name Coya Jaan, a eunuch, had the mastery in opposition to the lawful king. He was an accursed Saracen, who, by means of his great treasures, had gained possession of the greater part of the kingdom.\u201d This person \u201cin the politest manner\u201d robbed him of the valuable gifts he was carrying home to the Pope, and detained him four months.\u2014Yule\u2019s \u2018Cathay,\u2019 p. 357.\nGhiy\u00e2th edd\u00een, whose wife was a sister of a woman Ibn Bat\u00fbta had married at Delhi: he is therefore above called his brother-in-law. Ibn Bat\u00fbta was hospitably entertained, and he thus continues:\n\nI had an interview with the Sultan and proposed the subject of the M\u00e1ldives, and the sending of an army to the islands. He formed a resolve to accomplish this object, and appointed the ships for the purpose. He arranged a present for the Queen of M\u00e1ldives, robes of honor, and gifts for the Emirs and Viziers. He entrusted to me the care of securing a marriage for him with the sister of the Queen; and lastly, he ordered three ships to be loaded with alms for the poor of the islands, and said to me, \"You will get back in five days.\" The Admiral Khodjah Serlee said to him, \"It will not be possible to go to the M\u00e1ldives until three months from this moment.\" The Sultan went on to address me, \"Since that is so, come to Fattan, so that we may finish this expedition and return to our capital at Moutrah (Madura): you will set out from there.\" I then remained with him, and as we waited I sent for my concubines and my comrades.\n\n[Ghiy\u00e2th edd\u00een won a great victory over the infidels and returned with Ibn Bat\u00fbta to Fattan (? D\u00e9vipatam) a large seaport town, and thence to Madura. At Fattan the Sultan told the Admiral to cease preparing the vessels for the M\u00e1ldivian expedition. He was then suffering from an illness, and shortly afterward died at a place near Madura. He left no son, and his nephew, N\u00e2ssir edd\u00een, whom Ibn Bat\u00fbta had known as a domestic servant at Delhi, was accepted by the army, and reigned in his stead:]\n\nHe [N\u00e2ssir edd\u00een] ordered that I should be provided with all the ships which his uncle had assigned to take me to the M\u00e1ldives. But I was attacked with fever, which is mortal at this place. I imagined that I was about to die. God inspired me to have recourse to the tamarind, which is very abundant in that country: I took about a pound and put it in water. I then\ndrank the beverage, and that relieved me in three days, and God healed me. I took a disgust for the town of Moutrah, and requested the Sultan's permission to take a voyage. He said, \"Where would you go? There remains only a month ere you start for the Maldives. Remain here and we shall give you all the equipment ordered by the master of the world (the deceased Sultan).\" I declined, and he wrote an order in my favor to Fattan, that I should be allowed to depart in any vessel I would. I returned to that town, and there found eight vessels setting sail for Yemen, and in one of them I embarked.\n\n[Ibn Bat\u00fata left this ship at Caoulem (Quilon) on the Malabar Coast, and there remained for three months. He then embarked in another, which was attacked by the pirates near Hinaour (Honore), and the traveller lost all his property, including the pearls and precious stones presented to him by the Ceylon King, and all his clothes:\u2014]\n\nI returned to Calicut and entered one of the Mosques. A lawyer sent me a suit of clothes; the K\u00e2zi, a turban; and a merchant, another coat. I was here informed of the marriage of the Vizier 'Abd Allah with the Queen Khad\u00eedjah, after the death of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin, and I heard that my wife, whom I had left enceinte, was delivered of a male child. It came into my heart to go back to the Maldives, but I feared the enmity which existed between me and the Vizier A'bd Allah. In consequence, I opened the Kur\u00e1n, and these words appeared before me, \"The angels shall descend unto them, and shall say, 'Fear not, neither be ye grieved.'\" (Kur\u00e1n, Sur. xii., 30.) I implored the benediction of God, took my departure, and arrived in ten days at the Maldives, and landed at the island of Cannalo\u00fbs. The Governor of this island, 'Abd al 'Az\u00eez Almakdach\u00e2ouy, welcomed me with respect, entertained me, and got a barque ready. I arrived in due course at Hololy,* an island to which the Queen and her sisters\n\n* Hololy:\u2014Probably Olweli island in North M\u00e1le Atol.\u2014B.\nresort for their diversion and for bathing. The natives term these amusements *tetdjer,* and they then have games on board the vessels. The Vizier and chiefs send offerings to the Queen of such things as are found in the island. I met there the Queen's sister, wife of the preacher *Mohammed,* son of *Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin,* and his mother, who had been my wife. The preacher visited me, and he was served with food.\n\nMeanwhile some of the inhabitants went across to the Vizier *'Abd Allah* and announced my arrival. He put some questions about me and the persons who had come with me, and was informed that I had come to take my son, who was now about two years old. The mother presented herself before the Vizier to complain of me, but he told her, \"I will not prevent him taking away his son.\" He pressed me to go to the island (*Mahal*), and lodged me in a house built opposite the tower of his Palace, in order that he might be aware of my estate. He sent me a complete suit of clothes, betel, and rose-water, according to custom. I took to him two pieces of silk to throw down at the moment of saluting him. These were received from me, with the intimation that the Vizier would not come out to receive me that day. My son was brought to me, and it seemed to me that a sojourn among the islanders was what was best for him. I, therefore, sent him back, and remained five days in the island. I thought it best to hasten my departure, and asked the usual permission. The Vizier sent for me and I repaired to his presence. They brought to me the two pieces of stuff they had previously taken from me, and I cast them before the Vizier and saluted him in the customary way. He made me sit by his side and questioned me of my condition. I ate in his company and washed my hands in the same basin with him, which thing he does with no one. Then betel was brought and I came away. The Vizier sent me\n\n---\n\n*Tetdjer:*\u2014Cf. M. *kuli-jahan* 'sports.'\u2014B.\ncloths and *bostous* of cowries, and conducted himself towards me in the most perfect way. I took my departure and after a voyage of forty-three days we arrived at Bengal.\n\n[The son of Ibn Bat\u016bta here spoken of was probably born before the close of 1344. The traveller therefore took his final departure from the M\u00e1ldives about the close of the year 1346.]\nPROCEEDINGS\n\n1881.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\n1882\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nCEYLON BRANCH.\n\nTHE VEDD\u00c1S OF CEYLON.\n\n(An abridgement of the Monograph communicated by Professor Virchow.)\n\n\"TIMES OF CEYLON\" PRESS.\nTHE VEDD\u00c1S OF CEYLON.\n\n(An abridgement of the monograph by Professor Virchow.)\n\nObject of the Paper.\u2014In the various mixture of races inhabiting Ceylon, the Vedd\u00e1s have, for a long time, been an object of special prominence in the study of ethnography, because there is much room for conjecture that in them is preserved a remnant of the aboriginal inhabitants of the island. And now, when, according to all accounts, their number is so rapidly diminishing that, at no very distant date, their last members will have disappeared from among the living, a peculiar interest is added to their study, and it is desirable to transmit to posterity a trustworthy picture of their singular characteristics. For this purpose the material we now have is nowise sufficient; hence the object of the following disquisition is not merely to collect what has been already ascertained, but to point out the gaps which can be supplied only by further local researches. It is to be hoped that this may stimulate to the immediate application of all possible means to obtain the wanting material.\n\nThe Vedd\u00e1 Land.\u2014The Vedd\u00e1s have dwelt, at least for some centuries, in the vast forests on the south-east side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, and especially in the wild tracts of land called the Vedd\u00e1-ra\u1e6da of Bintenne and the Mah\u00e1-vedd\u00e1-ra\u1e6da of Uva. The more savage remnant of the tribe live in the beautiful province of Nilgalla and in the forests of Bintenne. There is much evidence, however, that in times not very far distant the Vedd\u00e1s were scattered over a much larger extent of country, which reached much further northward, and their earlier presence in the south and even south-west is also proved (1). They are indeed spoken of as having formerly inhabited the districts between Adam\u2019s Peak and the Raygam\n\n---\n\n(1) Knox. Historical relation of the island of Ceylon, 1817, p. 9, 122.

(Habaragamuwa: Habara=Barbarians.)\n\nThe present Vedd\u00e1-land is very lovely, embracing a comparatively flat, wooded country, nowhere raised more than 200 feet above the level of the sea, and frequently having the appearance of a park. The character of the soil varies: damp and unwholesome marshes alternate with rock-ribbed hills which stud the country between the central mountains and the sea coast. Here the Vedd\u00e1s live in perfect isolation even from their more civilized tribal brethren, without fixed abodes, but yet upon their own recognized lands, mostly in small groups or simply in families. Rarely do they venture beyond their own boundaries, and then only for the purposes of exchanging honey, wax, skins, or venison for iron, axes, arrow-points, etc.\n\nTheir Numbers.\u2014This secluded existence explains why the estimates of their numbers vary so greatly. No recent estimate leads us to conclude that the total exceeds 1,500, and the extinction of the tribe seems imminent, though wherefore we are unable to discover.\n\nVillage and Forest Vedd\u00e1s.\u2014From the time of Knox they have been classed in two groups, a \"tamer sort\" or \"village Vedd\u00e1s,\" and a \"wilder\" or \"forest Vedd\u00e1s.\" All observers, however, agree that both belong to the same race. Hence, for the study of their physical condition, the two groups may without hesitation be united; but for the observation of their social and psychical conditions we must hold them strictly apart. In the latter respect only the forest, or jungle Vedd\u00e1s, are of any interest to us. These, therefore, will be mainly spoken of here; nevertheless we may not venture quite to set aside the village Vedd\u00e1s, since their actual settlement and civilization have succeeded only very imperfectly as yet.\n\nAttempts at their Culture\u2014Yakkho Worship.\u2014All attempts to bring the Vedd\u00e1s into fixed abodes and to raise them to a higher culture have suffered shipwreck in far greater measure than the efforts to civilize the Australians. Whether they actually have any conceptions of God, or God-like beings, is, to\nsay the least, very doubtful. The only thing that is proved is a lower kind of Demon or Yakkho worship among them, which here and there assumes the form of a worship of ancestors. Mr. Bailey tells us that those in Bintenne had mourned and buried their dead for a longtime, but that the more barbarous inhabitants of Nilgalla had only just begun to do so. Formerly they threw their dead into the jungle, or left them where they had died; after covering the body with leaves, they laid a heavy stone upon the breast and sought out for themselves another cavern, giving up the one where death had entered to the spirit of the departed. These spirits,\u2014now become Yakkhos\u2014watch over the welfare of those left behind; come to their relations when they are ill; visit them in dreams; and grant them flesh on the chase. They are invoked with dance and song around an upright arrow. Sometimes while preparing for the chase the spirit is promised a piece of the flesh of the slain animal; at other times they cook something and put it in the dry bed of a river or other obscure place, invoke the souls of the departed, dance round the food, and perform their incantations.*\n\nMr. Hartshorne describes these sacrificial feasts. While invoking the departed spirit they roast the flesh of the wandura, monkey, or talagoya (iguana) with honey and edible roots, and then distribute it among those present, who eat it on the spot.\n\nYakko and Naga-worshipping communities in early times.\u2014This word \"Yakkho\" (Yakko) designates, according to Turnour, a kind of demon; though the demon-worshippers are also called Yakkhos and Yakkhinis. He derives it from the root Y\u00e1ga, to bring offerings. This word has, for a long time, justly excited the attention of scientists, since in the great historical work of Ceylon\u2014the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so\u2014the earliest inhabitants of the island\n\n* [In respect to these beliefs and customs\u2014apparently put forward as illustrations of barbarism\u2014do we, the most civilized, not also seem in our dreams to see those who have occupied our thoughts when alive, and still occupy our affections when gone; and who has not at least wished, or hoped, if not prayed for the countenance, the approval, even the aid in our needs, of venerated ones passed from hence? Do not the vastest number of Christians pray to and invoke the dead, not to speak of sacrifices and vows and offerings to them? Is the difference so great at bottom between the ideas of the Vedd\u00e1s on these heads and those of Augustan Rome or Modern Europe?\u2014T. B.]\nare called by that name. When Wijeya, the founder of the first known Ceylon dynasty, in the year of Gautama Buddha's death, 543 B.C., landed in the island, he found an already organized Yakkho state; and indeed it is said of Gautama Buddha himself that he came to Lanka, \"a settlement of the Yakkhos.\" It is hardly allowable to conclude from this, with Sir Emerson Tennent and others, that these were identical with the Vedd\u00e1s, and that up to the time of Wijeya an aboriginal homogeneous race inhabited the island, though it may not be a mistake to assume that in the earliest period almost the entire population were devoted to this Yakkho-worship as it now exists amongst the Vedd\u00e1s. The identification of the Vedd\u00e1s with those Yakkhos would require us to assume such a deep physical and intellectual degeneration of the present Vedd\u00e1s from the old Yakkho times as would be without parallel in history, as well as in ethnology, and such as the author cannot bring himself to admit. Not a single fact sustains the conjecture that Wijeya, with his followers from the valley of the Ganges, was the first stranger who came to Ceylon. On the contrary, the legend of the advent of Gautama Buddha, and, no less, the old traditions of the R\u00e1mayana, clearly point to earlier arrivals and invasions, and if Wijeya found some kind of political organization on the island, the time in which the whole north of the island was Vedd\u00e1-land must then be placed a good deal further back. The first visit of Gautama Buddha to the island was, according to the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so, in Mahiyangana, near Bintenne. According to the Yakkhos, in whose midst the Buddha here appeared, he visited on a second occasion N\u00e2gadipo, the abode of the N\u00e2gas, or snake-worshippers, which is generally assumed to be the name for the north and west of the island; at any rate mention is made of N\u00e2gas living by the ocean as well as mountain N\u00e2gas, and a N\u00e2ga King of Kalyani, in the neighbourhood of Colombo, is spoken of. If any importance is to be attached to these traditions, a number of tribes, or at least a division of the original population, must be inferred. And it is not without value that the description of the N\u00e2ga States, in these most ancient myths, disclose to us a much more perfect organization than we find any account of in the tales of the Yakkhos.\nNevertheless, we must renounce the idea of using these myths as the basis for ethnological contemplation and for building up a highly developed Vedda-state in prehistoric times.\n\nVeddas nomadic hunters.\u2014Up to a very recent date the Veddas have been a nomadic, half cave-inhabiting race of hunters, each small family group having its special vaguely-defined hunting ground, comprising a proportionately vast tract of woodland. Of any kind of culture, garden or farm, there was no trace. They had no domestic animal save the dog, of a species identical with that common in Ceylon, and apparently trained not for hunting but for watching. Their hunting implements are the simplest possible, consisting of a strong bow 6 feet long, and two or three arrows of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet, having points of wrought iron, not made by themselves but obtained by barter for honey and wax. Besides these they have only an iron axe, or sometimes two (a larger and a smaller) obtained in the same way. Mr. Hartshorne rightly finds in their word for axe a reminiscence of an earlier period when stone weapons were in use among them, and for which it might be a not unprofitable task to explore the caverns in which, according to Mr. Bailey, bones of the dead are still to be found. They subsist almost wholly on animal food, excluding the flesh of cattle, the elephant, bear, leopard, jackal, and fowls. Their food is cooked, but very roughly, as they have no clay or earthen vessels. They have no special stimulants, and neither betel nor tobacco, but chew a kind of bark. Their only drink is water. Mr. Hartshorne says that even salt was unknown to them, but that when it was given to them they were much delighted with it. Only in occasional places where European influence is perceptible do we find a rude kind of agriculture in the form of little strips of chena cultivation. With this exception, which really cannot be taken into account, their whole existence depends on the product of the chase; and there is nothing to speak of which indicates that anywhere or at any time they have risen above the condition of a savage tribe of hunters. Indeed, they have never arrived at even the very crudest form of permanent dwelling places; and, although they sheltered themselves from the inclemency of the weather in natural caverns, or in simple huts made of branches of trees\nand bark, they seem never to have made these their settled abodes. On the contrary, perpetual change of place within their hunting grounds has been ever the rule.*\n\nInfluence of their mode of life on their Psychical Condition.\u2014Hence their social intercourse is essentially limited to their next of kin, whose number is often very small, consisting of only four or five persons, and all stimulant to higher acquisitions and enjoyments and need for sustained mental effort is, therefore, wanting.\n\nTheir Peaceable Character.\u2014In character they are peaceable among themselves, and toward strangers so long as they are unmolested. They respect the rights of property, and are true and truth-loving.\n\nDress and ornaments.\u2014Both sexes go almost naked. In former times they wore pieces of bark from the riti tree (a species of Anticaris); which were later replaced by little bits of cloth held round the body by a string. The women wore round iron pegs stuck through their ears. Mr. Hartshorne, however, saw ornaments worn in the ears by both sexes, generally pearls, or, what seemed peculiarly admired, empty cartridge boxes. Evidently these are quite modern innovations.\n\nMarriage relations.\u2014It is a custom with them to marry with a younger sister\u2014a practice in use among the royal families of the Sinhalese from the time of Wijeya. The only marriage ceremony consists in the suitor's bringing food for the parents.\n\nEmotional expression.\u2014There seems to be no particular depth of feeling among them. All the descriptions indicate rather a certain morose indolence. Whilst they can help it they not only do not laugh themselves, but they despise those who do. Mr. Hartshorne says of them that they are incapable of laughing. This, if it be true, is a peculiarity which, so far as the author knows, has not been told of any other race of people, and has only appeared among certain idiots.\u2020\n\n* [And a necessity of their life, as hunters depending on game for their subsistence.\u2014T. B.]\n\n\u2020 [It seems impossible to deny the existence of emotions, and of the outward physical expression of these, to any vertebrated animals at\nIntellectual capacity.\u2014In point of intellect they seem indeed to stand very low. If they have any notion of numbers, or can count at all, it is to the most limited extent, probably not beyond five. It is said that they have no word for color, nor any perception of differences of color; that their memory is defective; and that they are incapable of forming any general ideas. Sir Emerson Tennent says they have no notion [perhaps it would be more correct to say only a very limited and vague notion] of time or space; no words for hours, days or years;* no games, no amusements,\u2020 no music.\u2021 These statements, however, apply in their full breadth only to the \"wild sort,\" for Davy says of the village Vedd\u00e1s that they have a rough kind of song performed as an accompaniment to a clumsily executed dance. Granting some of the observations furnished to be too exclusive, still we are compelled to acknowledge the inferiority of the race.\n\nCaste.\u2014As they have no distinction of caste it is a very striking fact that they not only look upon themselves as superior to their neighbours but are looked upon by them as members of a high and even of a royal caste. The Sinhalese term for the agricultural caste is Goyi-wa\u1e63e, the Malabar term Wellala; to this caste they are said by writers to belong; and those of Bintenne are said to call themselves Vedd\u00e1-Vellalas.\n\nleast. However low the sensibilities, pain and pleasure must equally be experienced, and be visibly manifested in the absence of some physical defect, and their deliberate suppression or control would seem to argue a degree of intellectual and moral strength which no one has given the Vedd\u00e1s the credit of possessing. Possibly, a low emotional excitability has been confounded with incapacity.\u2014T. B.]\n\n* [But the ordinary Sinhalese cultivator is singularly poor and vague in the observation and notation of time and space, though he does measure the day by the length of the shadow in feet, and the height of the sun by comparison with the height of a cocoanut tree. Is it quite certain the Vedd\u00e1s do not the same? Mr. Hartshorne's assertion has, however, been disproved, as appears in Russels' Account of the Prince of Wales' visit to India.\u2014T.

Thousands of years had not sufficed to reduce the Rodiya out-casts to the degree of degradation to which the Vedd\u00e1s had fallen when Knox first heard of them.\n\nHISTORICAL & LINGUISTIC.\n\nCultivated Races in the Island: Tamils.\u2014This would be the place to bring forward the historical and linguistic observations which concern the relations of the Vedd\u00e1s to the cultivated tribes of the island, by far the most numerous of whom, after the Sinhalese themselves, are the Tamils, who now exclusively occupy all those portions of the island which lie nearest to the Indian continent, and whose connection with the Dravidians of India seems unquestionable. These are the Damilos of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so, a Pali term exactly equivalent to Dravida in the Sanskrit. (2) In local English speech they are frequently called Malabars, as if they came only from the Malabar coast, but in point of fact they belong to the ancient great Pandian kingdom, which stretched from the east to the west coast of India, and from the Deccan to Cape Comorin, but has ultimately dwindled to the little state of Madura. The first warlike invasion of the Damilos, of which there is historical record, took place B.C. 237, and during the whole of the next fourteen or fifteen hundred years their invasions were constantly renewed, and the dynasties of native princes repeatedly superseded by their Tamil conquerors. (3) In the beginning of the 13th century the whole country was overrun, subjected, and cruelly devastated; its inhabitants tortured, and many of its Buddhist monuments destroyed by a great expedition from K\u00e1l\u00ednga and the northern Circars of the Dekkan, under Maagha, who assumed the throne of the island. In the result,\n\n(2) R. C. Childers. Notes on the Sinhalese language. Journal Royal Asiatic Society, 1875, London, Vol. viii., p. 133 note.\n\n(3) Mahawanso, Chap. xxi., p 127.

Tennent, i. 412.\nthe Sinhalese people succeeded in recovering or retaining the provinces of Ruhuna in the south, and Mayaratta in the mountainous centre of the island; but the north of the country\u2014the province of Pihiti or Rajarata, the land of the kings\u2014remained, even as far as the Mahawila Ganga, in the possession of the Tamils, and was by them wholly and permanently Dravidized.\n\nMoors.\u2014More peaceable invasions of the country took place by Mohammedan Arabs, whose descendants are now called Moors or Moormen. There seems to be no doubt that, at least since the first, and certainly since the 6th century A.C. (4) very extensive mercantile relations existed between Persia, Arabia and Ceylon, and that since that time many of these \"Mauren\" (as the Portugese called them later) remained in the land. The present Moors seem to be descended partly from these immigrants, who intermarried with native women, and partly from persons of similar origin in India, who in large numbers settled in the districts of Chilaw and Puttalam (5). There is now little or no distinction between these two groups of Moors, who are scattered over the whole island and are the chief medium of all mercantile intercourse\u2014even with the Vedd\u00e1s.\n\nMalays.\u2014Malays, belonging throughout to the Mohammedan religion, are to be found in the island only in comparatively small numbers, but scattered over many regions. According to the representations of Mr. Pridham (6) they are descended chiefly from the little Rajas and their followers whom the Dutch brought hither from Java, Malacca and Sumatra, and who were later taken by the English into their native regiments. More important it would be for us if the opinion were correct that the original population of the island had been Malays. This is supported by the certainly very noticeable fact that the Sinhalese use double canoes, or boats with booms, just such as are used in all the regions inhabited or colonized by Malays. This, however, is the only foothold for the hypothesis of an ethnic relationship.\n\nEuropeans, Negroes, Parsees.\u2014Naturally, in the last centuries the different nations of Europe, especially Dutch,\n\n(4) Tennent 1, 546, 555, 607.\n(5) Pridham i. 470.\n(6) Pridham p. 482.\nPortugese and English, have added to the population; but for our researches they are of no importance. The same is to be said of the African Negroes and the Parsees, the former of whom have been only recently introduced, whilst the latter immigrated at different periods but in small numbers.\n\n*Sinhalese.*\u2014The southerly half of the island, the old province of Ruhuna and the central Maya-land, are still peopled by the Sinhalese; the former by comparatively pure-blooded Sinhalese, the latter by the somewhat more mixed Kandyans, the immediate neighbours of the Veddas. The ethnological position of the Sinhalese has been until now discussed chiefly on linguistic grounds, and on these it has been inferred by some that the Sinhalese belong to the great Dekkan family, and by Max M\u00fcller that they are a mixture of Indians with Dravidian aborigines. But others entertain directly the opposite opinion, and particularly Childers (6b) who derives the Sinhalese language from the ancient Elu with, however, an immense admixture of Sanskrit words partly unchanged. According to him the word *Elu* is identical with the word \"Sinhalese,\" by which the Sinhalese call themselves. It stands for the old word *Hela* or *Helu*, and this again for the still older *Sela*, which leads us back to the Pali *Sihala*. The Sinhalese language is very nearly related to Pali which, however, only represents the dialect of one of the districts of M\u00e2gadha, (the modern Behar), from a district of which (Lala), Wijeya, the founder of the Sihala dynasty, is said to have come. Hence Sinhalese is one of the native Aryan (Sanskrit) languages of India, and very ancient, for it is absolutely identical with the *Elu* of the 5th and 6th centuries B.C., which is also found on the rock inscriptions of Mihintale of the 2nd or 3rd century.\n\n*Vedda Dialect.*\u2014What place the Vedda language holds relatively to this is still in the highest degree dubious.

Taylor (10), Hartshorne (11) and Cust (12),\u2014seem to consider it to be a dialect of, or to approach to the Sinhalese. But there is much difference of opinion as to the existence in it of Dravidian elements, the supposed mixture of which (Telugu) in a dialect of an Aryan tongue (which he considers Sinhalese to be) leads Mr. Taylor to say that \"their language makes a mixture of Aryan blood along with Aryan language probable, whilst their bodily characteristics shew that the race of Veddas belong chiefly to the native pre-Arian type.\" The disagreements in the views of linguists are so great that we unfortunately gain very little from them towards a just comprehension of the phylogenetic position of the Veddas. On the contrary, the mystery that envelopes this people, so remarkable in themselves, is vastly increased, and the purely anthropological interest comes even more into the foreground.\n\nThe word Vedd\u00e1.\u2014The word \"Vedd\u00e1,\" or some modification of it, is widely used in India\u2014a whole series of little tribes dwelling far apart, and who probably have not the least connection with one another, bearing the very same name, or one very like it. Whether the word be derived from the Sanskrit (Viyadha, hunter) or the Tamil (Vedan, hunter, wood-dweller,) this much seems certain that except when used in combination (as in the case of \"Doddu-Vedd\u00e1,\") it always relates to aborigines or savage races.\n\nThe Ethnological problem not to be solved by linguistics but by anthropology.\u2014Up to the present time two leading views stand opposed to one another which are mainly supported by\n\n(8) Bailey l. c. 297, 305, 309.\n(9) MaxMuller cited by Childers l. c.

According to one the Vedd\u00e1s would be next of kin to the Dravidians; according to the other, members of the great Aryan family. In either case they must have immigrated from the continent; only in the first very much earlier than in the second. If we assume that the Vedd\u00e1s originally belonged or were nearly related to the Dravidians, or even, if different from them, at any rate a savage aboriginal tribe, and that they only received their present language subsequently from Aryan conquerors, then it is difficult to conceive how the process of Sinhalesing the language could have been accomplished whilst their whole way of living, their customs and habits, remained wholly unchanged. On the other hand the hypothesis that the Vedd\u00e1s are Sinhalese who have become savage would require us to fall back on some period after Wijeya, and, contrary to all experience, we should have to assume a descent from a high state of comparative civilization to a degradation too great to be conceivable, unless we can prove at the same time a very deep physical demoralisation; and that too whilst in closest proximity, even in direct contact, with a people who had passed through a long and eventful history. From whatever side we consider the question we must come to the conclusion that linguistics can only be used as aids in the investigation; and that if a real solution is to be found it is only possible by means of anthropology.\n\nANTHROPOLOGICAL.\n\nVedd\u00e1s\u2014The earliest known description of the Vedd\u00e1s is contained in a work attributed to Palladius, Bishop of Helenopolis in Bithynia, who died A.D. 410, and in which he describes a journey made from Thebes to Ceylon. The Vedd\u00e1s are there described as feeble, and small of stature, and as having heads black and apparently large, with long, smooth, unshorn hair. Davy has given the first description resting an autopsy. He says:\u2014\"Such of the village Vedd\u00e1s as I have seen were in general small men between 5 feet 3 and 5 feet 9 inches high; muscular and well made; in colour, form and features resembling the Sinhalese. Their appearance was wild\nin the extreme and completely savage. Their hair seemed never to have been combed or cleaned; it was long, bushy and matted, hanging about their shoulders and shading their faces in a very luxuriant and disgusting manner; nor were their beards less neglected.\" Sir Emerson Tennent describes their children as unsightly objects, entirely naked, with misshapen joints, huge heads and protuberant stomachs, and says of their women that they were the most repulsive specimens of humanity he had ever seen in any country. The men, he says, also presented the same characteristics of wretchedness and dejection. He speaks of their projecting mouths, flattened noses and stunted stature. Of several measured by Mr. Bailey, the tallest, who towered above his fellows, was only 5 feet 3 inches in height; and the smallest 4 feet 1 inch: and he concludes the average height of the men to range from 4 feet 6 to 5 feet 1, and of the women from 4 feet 4 to 4 feet 8. Observers present no facts which indicate disproportionate or imperfect development of the separate members of the body. Only Mr. Hartshorne asserts that they have short thumbs and sharp-pointed elbows. The descriptions we have of them are sufficient to show us that the Vedd\u00e1s are a dark, but not actually black race; and not woolly haired like the Negro; and that they are a very small, not to say dwarfish race.\n\nAs to their features, Bailey says that these are, on the whole, tolerably regular. He, like Sir Emerson Tennent and Hartshorne, speaks of the flatness of the nose, and of the lips as somewhat thick. A woodcut prepared from a drawing made from a photograph of a group of six Vedd\u00e1s, who were presented to the Prince of Wales, shews plainly the growth of the hair; the noses comparatively short, broad at the end and flattened;\u2014the eyes apparently deep-set; the lips of the younger persons full and bulging: and this gives a far more vivid idea of the people than any description could furnish. One only of the men has anything like a beard. We see the little spear worn by the men, the great bows they carry, the arrows with the leaf-like points, and, finally, the iron axe stuck in the girdle.\n\nIf we add to the foregoing descriptions of their features the short thumbs and sharp-pointed elbows, referred to by Mr. Hartshorne, there are indications enough to distinguish the\nVedd\u00e1s in a noticeable manner from the oriental races living in their neighbourhood.*\n\nIn our comparisons with other races the Sinhalese and the Tamils come chiefly under consideration: the others only collaterally. Those two are so predominant, both through their numbers and the extent of territory they occupy, that, apart from their exclusively historical claims, they must be specially considered.\n\nThe Sinhalese.\u2014For purposes of comparison with the Vedd\u00e1s the information with regard to the relative physical condition of their neighbours is very deficient, and osteological material scanty in the European collections; and what there is of that rather unsafe. The following remarks must, therefore, be taken with reserve, and are made principally to induce the sending of better material and especially photographs\u2014half lengths and not too small\u2014showing the profile and front face in the right horizontal position.\n\nThe Sinhalese occupy in the main the south and south-west of the country. According to Sir Emerson Tennent the inhabitants of the south coast from Galle to Hambantotte are the purest Sinhalese. This part formed an important division of the old province of Ruhuna, which was very early colonised by the descendants of Wijeya, who neither mingled with the Malabars nor had any intercourse with them.\n\nPhysical appearance compared with the Veddas.\u2014If we compare the descriptions given of the Sinhalese with those of the Vedd\u00e1s we find in reality few points of difference. The complexion of the latter may be on the average somewhat darker, but it varies, apparently, within the same limits. It is equally doubtful if the hair varies; allowance being made for its neglected, dishevelled condition in the one case, and its carefully combed and well-kept condition in the other, it may be considered that the difference here is owing rather to culture than to original peculiarity. The average height of the Sinhalese seems to correspond with that of the tallest Vedd\u00e1, but they\n\n* [The detailed craniological observations which follow the descriptions of the external physical appearance of the different races are here omitted; as the material points are collected and compared or contrasted in the pages which discuss their comparative craniology and osteology.\u2014T. B.]\nare also somewhat shorter than Europeans. Among all the characteristics cited there is in reality only one which seems to have made a great and decided impression on every observer, to wit the form of the nose. Whilst with the Sinhalese it is very prominent, resembling an eagle's beak, and therefore thin and round, with the Vedd\u00e1s it is always described as flat and with widely distended nostrils. Add to this, the thick and projecting lips and the large mouth, and perhaps also the comparative smallness of the Vedd\u00e1 face, and there remain few facial characteristics for diagnosis.* We may say that the Sinhalese also belong to a dark, perhaps best described as a brown, smooth-haired, and a not (or only very moderately) prognathous race, that is to say the jaws do not project, or only slightly.\n\nThe Tamils or Malabars: their distribution in the island and physical appearance.\u2014We understand by this term the Dravidian immigrants who, in historic times, came from many different parts on the peninsula of Hindustan, and, in the course of two thousand years, multiplied so greatly that they almost exclusively peopled the north and a large portion of the east of the island, more especially along the shore, and whom Pridham speaks of as inhabitants of the land from Batticaloa on the east, to Jaffna on the north, and from there as far south as Puttalam on the west coast. When the Portugese, the first pioneers of civilization, obtained a firm foot-hold upon the island the Malabar rule was firmly established in the old Rajarata or Pihiti. It is not to be supposed that they live even now wholly separated from the Sinhalese. On the contrary, they are found in no small numbers mixed with other races. It is of special interest to us that they are immediate neighbours of the Vedd\u00e1s. Wolff describes the Malabars as black, long-haired, and without calves to their legs. Beyond this the author has found very few statements regarding their physical peculiarities; most of the writers limiting themselves to ascribing to them a stouter physique than the Sinhalese and greater activity.\n\n* [Another point (whether common to the Vedd\u00e1s also I do not know) which seems to me of perhaps ethnological importance is the yellow tint or tone that seems to suffuse the brown Sinhalese complexion, and which is noticed by Percival, Philolethes and Davy.\u2014T. B.]\nThe Moors or Moormen.\u2014Their number is small; and their effect upon the rest of the population even less highly to be estimated, because of their religion which necessitates a sharply defined separation, so that they rarely intermarry with the Sinhalese or other natives. We have scarcely any description of their physical peculiarities. There seems to be only one skull of a \"Moor\" in Europe, and that is in the possession of Mr. Bernard Davis. This (317 of his collection) is a male skull of 1495 cub. cm. capacity; therefore tolerably large; with a length to breadth index of 70; length to height index of 71; and a facial index of 85\u00b77. It is accordingly ortho-dolichocephalic and chamaeprosop. From a single skull no judgment can be formed whether it is really typical of its race, and therefore further comparison is scarcely desirable.\n\nMalays.\u2014The existence of a scattered Malay element has been earlier discussed. A few statements as to their physical condition have come to us. Cordiner describe them as lighter, more inclining to copper colour than any other of the Indian races. Selkirk speaks of them as copper-coloured; below middle height; with flat brow; broad flat nose; and piercing eyes. In the Davis collection there is a Malay skull from Colombo, marked male. Its capacity amounts to 1435 cub. cm.; the length to breath index is 79; length to height 76; face index 108. It is therefore hypsimeso-cephalic and leptoprosp.\n\nTHE MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE RACES.\n\nWe now proceed to consider the origin and relationship to each other of the different tribes existing close to one another in Ceylon: and it is noteworthy that the inhabitants of the island are spoken of as belonging to distinct races both by Greek travellers in the 6th, and by Chinese travellers in the 7th centuries after Christ.\n\nQuestion of a Chinese or Siamese origin of the Sinhalese.\u2014With respect to the question of a Chinese origin which some have on insufficient grounds attributed to the Sinhalese, we have reports of one warlike invasion by the Chinese; and Chinese soldiers are stated to have entered the military service of King Prakrama in 1266. The defeat of a King of Ceylon\nby a Chinese army so late as the year 1408 is also narrated. But nothing is known of any colonization or settlement by the Chinese having ever taken place in Ceylon; and no elaborate proof is needed to prove that neither Sinhalese nor Veddas, at least in the form of their skulls, present the slightest indication of any relationship to the Mongols. According to an old tradition mentioned by Valentyn, the Sihala dynasty, from which Wijeya the conqueror was descended, had their residence in Tennasserim, so that a Siamese origin [or connexion] is thus ascribed to the Sinhalese; but it is unnecessary to follow up the tradition. Besides, it is not the search for the origin of the Sinhalese which claims our first interest but the derivation of the Veddas.\n\nThe Veddas not degenerated Sinhalese.\u2014Whether we consider the Veddas to be, as some say, \"savage Sinhalese,\" or the Sinhalese to be, as others say, \"tame Veddas\"\u2014thus deducing both from the same stock\u2014we must begin our investigations with the Veddas. A reverse order would be justified only if we assumed that the Veddas had sunk back from a condition of higher civilization to that of absolute savagery in which all travellers have found them for many centuries. The theoretical objection to such an assumption need not be again brought up, but I will only ask what signs of an earlier civilization have actually been found? What remains of an earlier culture that, with any probability, might be attributed to the Veddas? A people who do not even possess clay vessels; who have no knowledge of domestic animals, beyond the dog; who are unacquainted with the simplest form of gardening and agriculture; who lack almost every kind of social institution; who are not even counted as outcasts by their civilized neighbours,\u2014cannot possibly ever have had the means which make a higher culture of any kind possible. The hypothesis of a relapse to barbarism must hence be definitely given up.\n\nThe ground for such an assumption could only be found in the language. But it has been already shewn how great is the difference of opinion as to the place which should be given to that. That it is no Dravidian idiom, fundamentally, seems proved beyond a doubt. If we take it for a dialect of the Sinhalese, and the latter for a primitive sister dialect of the\nPali, it will still be truly very difficult for any one to argue from that, and still less from the Sanskrit words intermingled with it, the derivation of the Veddas from the valley of the Ganges. Surrounded for centuries by more highly cultivated peoples, a certain intercourse with their neighbours has been unavoidable, and consequently, where the Tamils have continuously pressed on nearer to them\u2014as near Batticaloa\u2014a part of the Veddas have adopted the Tamil language. But for very much longer, and in the greater number of places, they have been in immediate contact with the Sinhalese. What wonder, therefore, if they adopted more and more Sinhalese words and forms. The question is only whether besides these, as I suppose, borrowed words, their language has not preserved some individual elements? To this point so little attention has been given that we do not even know positively whether the Vedd\u00e1 language contains any words designating numbers. It is no use being told that half the words noted down are corrupted Sanskrit. To what belongs the other half, which perhaps with greater attention might be enlarged? If we cannot class it among the Tamil languages it is very possible that it may prove specific. Nothing hitherto justifies us in any such one-sided statement as that of Mr. Tyler who, without hesitation, calls the Vedd\u00e1 language Aryan.\n\nThe matter would take a rather different aspect if we might assume that originally the Veddas alone inhabited the island and that they were not only forced back into the forests by the immigrants but had [partly] intermingled with them.* According to the native annalists the origin of the Sinhalese is to be traced back to the followers of King Wijeya\u2014a victorious host of immigrants from the valley of the Ganges in a numerical proportion to the inhabitants which must have been somewhat like that of the Danes and Normans in England. A patriarchal system was introduced which has lasted for thousands of years, and a series of facts testify that the aboriginal population was not wholly\n\n* [This has actually happened. Of the Tamils who did not immigrate, till later we may say that while in the North they have entirely supplanted the original population, in the East they have not merely mingled with the Veddas but have accomplished a veritable tamulization of them.\u2014T.B.]\nexcluded from this system.* Upon such a foundation an intermingling of the Magadha people with the aborigines would most naturally take place, and if we look upon the Sinhalese race as the result of this commingling, the experience of so many other countries, where a similar commingling has taken place, would make it perfectly explicable that the Magadha people made their language, the old Pali or Elu, the ruling one, while in their physical conformation the aboriginal element won lasting influence. With such a view of the matter the Vedd\u00e1s and Sinhalese would neither be identical, nor distinguished from one another merely by the degree of culture. The Vedd\u00e1s would appear rather as representatives of the aboriginal race; the Sinhalese, on the other hand, as hybrids produced by a union of immigrant Indians with Vedd\u00e1s, and therefore varying according to the measure of these elements. This indeed strikes me as being the solution of the anthropological problem before us. The linguistic difficulty, that also the unmixed natives adopted to some extent\u2014less or more\u2014the Aryan language of their conquerors appears no longer insurmountable, for the same thing is actually now happening with the Fins in the Baltic provinces of Russia.\n\nCOMPARATIVE ANTHROPOLOGY\n\nThe craniological materials available to the Author for purposes of comparison have been the following. Of Vedda skulls, twenty-three well authenticated specimens, including three lent to the Author himself from the Colombo Museum; but of this number two had to be excluded from some of the computations owing to abnormalities, the probable consequence of artificial or accidental occipital pressure. Of Sinhalese skulls, after setting aside those of which there are no detailed descriptions or measurements, or which are measured on a system different from that used by the Author, and also those of\n\n* [We have corroboration of this in the statement that \"King Pandukhabayo (B.C. 437) placed the Veddas in a separate settlement, near the town (Anuradhapura).\" Burrows' Buried Cities p. 3. Unfortunately Mr. Burrows has not quoted his authority for this statement.\u2014T.B.]\nhybrids,\u2014there remained twelve available for comparision, which include two received by the Author himself, through the kindness of Consul Freudenberg: a third, similarly received, proved to be probably that of a Tamil child. These would form a good broad basis for future decision if important measurements were not wanting in these belonging to Mr. Davis' collection, for instance, of the orbits, nose and palate. With respect to Tamil or Malabar skulls only a single specimen was known in Europe until lately. This was in the collection of Mr. Davis, in which was also the skull of a hybrid of Malabar and Sinhalese. This has been supplemented, through the kindness of Consul Freudenberg, by three Tamil skulls, unfortunately all without the lower jaw, and a child's marked Sinhalese, but which rather appears to be Tamil. There are therefore, strictly, only four specimens for comparision, and in giving the averages of measurements only these undoubted ones are taken into computation.\n\n[There is only a single skull of a Moor known in Europe, and in the Davis' collection one Malay skull from Colombo, but these are not brought into the comparisions.]\n\nANTHROPOLOGICAL COMPARISON OF THE VEDDAS WITH THE SINHALESE.\n\nConsidered simply on anthropological grounds the differences between the Vedd\u00e1s and the Sinhalese are not so great as to oblige us to assume an absolute contrast in the two tribes. The skulls which have been personally examined [by the Author] are too few to lead to a definite conclusion, but they seem sufficient to enable us to ascertain whether any reason exists for distrusting results obtained in other ways. Such reason I do not find.\n\nComparing briefly what has been arrived at, the result is that the Vedd\u00e1s, as well as the Sinhalese, are dark tribes whose complexion varies\u2014apparently within the same limits\u2014between yellow-brown and black. The character of the hair also is plainly similar: only that here the effect of culture is conspicuous to a much greater extent. Both tribes, however,\nwear the hair long; it is black, luxuriant and a little wavy; but with the Vedd\u00e1s, owing to neglect, it hangs down in tangled but, properly speaking, not curly nor wooly tresses. There is special testimony which conclusively proves that the Sinhalese hair, when not cared for, strongly resembles that of the Vedd\u00e1s. Information with respect to the colour of the iris is less complete, but it may be gathered that, as a rule, it is black or dark-brown, in both cases. As regards size, plainly both races are of moderate stature, rather short than tall. The significance of the shorter measure of the Vedd\u00e1s cannot be doubted, but the fact that they are not all dwarfs, and that comparatively large Vedd\u00e1s are met with, may be adduced in favor of the hypothesis that their often dwarfish size is a result of long continued unfavourable conditions for development. Nevertheless the fact in the main is well established that the Vedd\u00e1s belong to a small, indeed to one of the smallest known races. Concerning the development of muscle and strength of body, the witnesses testify loudly in favor of the Vedd\u00e1s. With respect to the shortness of the thumbs and pointed elbows, emphasized by Mr. Hartshorne, only the first would be of any importance if it should be proved by measurement to be altogether disproportionate. It may, perhaps, be a deception, such as that of Mr. Burnet in regard to the length of the foot, which direct measure shews to be of perfectly fair proportions.\n\nSimilar observations, only still less distinctive, we find in regard to the size of the head, and especially the capacity of the skull. The result proves that the Vedd\u00e1 skulls are on the average much smaller than the Sinhalese; their capacity only averaging 1,261 cub. cm. against 1,406 cub. cm. for the latter. [The average capacity of the English male skull is 1,511 cub. cm. taking the average of those in the Royal College of Surgeons.\u2014T. B.] Some of the Vedd\u00e1 skulls are positively nano-kephalic, descending in one specimen to a capacity of 1,025, and in another, that of an adult man, to a capacity of only 960 cub. cm. This term nano-kephalic [pigmy-headed] is chosen to distinguish the case from microcephaly in the pathological sense, [i.e., from smallness of the head the result of disease or malformation.] But notwithstanding this difference in average, the numbers slide over from both sides; the higher average of the Sinhalese does not prevent\nthe occurrence of very small specimens; for the extremes range from 1,694 to 1,110 cub. cm.; and vice versa, the certainly very low average of the Vedd\u00e1s includes some pretty large specimens, (one 1,420, and one 1,614.) The length measures and the relations deduced from them have brought to light certain differences between the two tribes, but we shall represent these parallel to each other in their indices. One of the proportions is, however, now mentioned as being of considerable importance, viz., that with the Sinhalese the front and middle head have the larger share in forming the roof of the skull, while with the Vedd\u00e1s it is the occipital region that does so. Of special interest is the comparison of the skull indices. The average ratio between length and breadth, ascertained by the Author, is for both tribes almost identical: 71\u00b78 for the Sinhalese; 71\u00b76 for the Vedd\u00e1s. This is a highly dolichocephalic [i.e. long-headed] measure [and its value will be better appreciated if we remember that for the narrow long-headed Negro the ratio is nearly the same, while for the European it is 80, and for the broad and short head of a Tartar tribe 85, and in some Mongolian tribes even 88.\u2014T. B.] For our present purposes of comparison we can only say that these important relative measures do not point to any radical difference in race between Sinhalese and Vedd\u00e1s. With both the skull is long and narrow, yet among the Vedd\u00e1s there is a greater number in which the narrowness is extreme than among the Sinhalese. The Vedd\u00e1 skulls are narrower than those of the African Negroes, and sometimes as narrow as those of the New Caledonians. [The narrowest appear to be the Fijian mountain-eers, with whom the average ratio is only 66.\u2014T. B.] It is the same with the ratio between length and height, which is orthocephalic [straight-headed] with both tribes; [the average for the Sinhalese (74\u00b72) being only a little below that for the Vedd\u00e1s (74\u00b79.)] With reference to the height measures the ratio is somewhat different, in so far as the larger figures are on the side of the Sinhalese. In both the vertical height exceeds the breadth. These coincidences of the main indices are so great that they could not be greater within the limits of a single race. The configuration of the capsule of the skull may\u2014apart from the share of the separate bones in it\u2014be considered as identical. The total result as regards the formation of the skull is that a great\ncorrespondence exists between the proportions of the skulls of the Sinhalese and the Vedd\u00e1s, while the absolute figures shew those of the Sinhalese to exceed the Vedd\u00e1s, as a rule, in height.\n\nIn fact, according to the testimony of travellers, the difference of race is more conspicuous in the face than in the skull. It is chiefly to the form of the nose, particularly the flatness of its ridge, and the breadth of the nostrils, but likewise to the form of the lips and jaws, which are throughout described as prognathous [or projecting], that the various writers call attention as being characteristic features of the Vedd\u00e1 face. Contrasted with the Sinhalese nose\u2014which the old Chinese reporters call a bird\u2019s beak, and in the description of a Kandy beauty is compared to a hawk\u2019s bill,\u2014and also contrasted with the delicate lips and orthognathous [or straight] jaw, which we perceive in Davy\u2019s drawings, there are certainly very striking differences. Unfortunately no other observer has recorded orbital measurements for the Sinhalese, and there is a difference in the system of the published measurements which prevents our turning the skulls in England to much account in this direction; but, on the whole, osteological investigation has, in regard to the main facts, confirmed the observations made among the living. The skeleton face of the Sinhalese differs far more from that of the Vedd\u00e1s than their respective skulls do. The index for the face shews a very considerable contrast to that of the Vedd\u00e1s, averaging for the latter only 83, against 89 for the former, calculated on 5 female and 1 male skulls, one of which is that of a weak-minded person. In general the skeleton face of the Sinhalese is much narrower and longer than that of the Vedd\u00e1s. Corresponding with this the palate with the Sinhalese is more long and narrow; with the Vedd\u00e1s rather short and broad, with a prognathous jaw. In the last particular, however, the contrast is not so clear. With the Vedd\u00e1s occurs mesokonchy (orbital index 84\u00b76) and mesosorrhiny (52), with many individual aberrations it is true, so that with the women more platyrhine [or flat-nose] with the men more leptorhine [or narrow-nose] forms occur. On this point the Sinhalese materiel is very unsatisfactory and quite inadequate.\nANTHROPOLOGICAL COMPARISION OF THE TAMILS WITH THE VEDDAS AND SINHALESE.\n\nIt is necessary to take the Tamils next into comparision, chiefly because the historical accounts, going backward as far as the time of Wijeya, inform us of numerous marriages, not merely of the kings, but of their retainers, with the Malabar women, not to mention the very early invasions and settlements made on the island by Tamil hordes.\n\nIn spite of the meagre reports with regard to the physical characteristics of the Tamils, we cannot doubt that they, likewise, are very dark, more or less black, and have long black hair. For the rest, observers lay stress on their greater strength and activity\u2014nothing more. Hence there remains only the scant craniological material found in Mr. Davis\u2019 and the Author\u2019s own collections. As these are all insufficient for a final authoritative answer to the question of the ethnological relation of the Tamils to the two other (Sinhalese) tribes, the Author wishes his conclusions only to be accepted with great reserve.\n\nAll these Tamil skulls are comparatively small; the average capacity being only 1,247 cub. cm. which is even less than the average of the Vedd\u00e1s (1,261 cub. cm.) and of the Sinhalese (1,406 cub.cm.) It is scarcely possible to look upon this number as the typical one for the race, and it is only interesting as showing that small skulls may be found among all the races in the island. Still, none of them reach the minimum figure for the Vedd\u00e1s. More important, however, is the difference in the form of the head. The Tamil skull, judging from these specimens, is hypsi-meso-cephalic\u2014[i.e. the height index exceeds the breadth index; while the relation of the breadth to the length approaches the medium]\u2014in fact wholly different from the Sinhalese and the Vedd\u00e1 skull. Corresponding to this its transverse vertical length is greater than its sagittal circumference length. In the share of the separate bones of the skull in forming the roof of the skull we also find a great difference and radical contrast; the squama occipitalis [i.e., the flat portion of the occipital bone] is much smaller, and the frontal bone considerably larger than with the Sinhalese, and still more emphatically so than with the Vedd\u00e1s. While\nwith the Tamils the skull-roof culminates with the frontal division, with the Sinhalese, and still more with the Vedd\u00e1s; the occipital is strongly developed. The basilar view shows plainly the extraordinary shortness of the occipital region in the Tamil skulls. After this we must say that the skull of the Tamils, so far as can be ascertained from those under consideration, exhibits no relationship either with the Vedd\u00e1s or with the Sinhalese.\n\nIn size the Tamil face occupies a middle position between the Sinhalese and the Vedd\u00e1 face. The Sinhalese is the largest; then the Tamil; and the Vedd\u00e1 is the smallest. The proportions of the Tamil face may briefly be stated in the following formula: mesokonchy, mesorrhiny, prognathy, and brachystaphy.* This positively distinguishes the Tamil face from the Sinhalese, and brings it nearer to the Vedd\u00e1 face. But the almost complete identity of the nasal indices (Tamils 51, Vedd\u00e1s 50-52) does not prevent the greatest variety in the formation of the nasal bridge. Owing to the greater narrowness of the nasal bone as well as the form of the bridge we would not be at all justified in representing the flat, and, towards the lower part, broad nose of the Vedd\u00e1s as a Tamil inheritance. The form of the orbits is different in all the three races; and to this dissimilarity is to be added the very different formation of the naso-frontal region, in which, however, the proportions in the Sinhalese more nearly resemble those of the Vedd\u00e1. The form of the aperture of the nose is with the Tamil more like that of the Sinhalese than that of the Vedd\u00e1; both being platyrhine, and that of the Vedd\u00e1 mesorrhine; but at its epiphysis nevertheless the Vedd\u00e1 nose is flatter and more depressed; the Sinhalese and Tamil protuberant\u2014the Tamil in fact more than the Sinhalese. The chief distinctive feature of the Vedd\u00e1 palate is that the \"tooth-curve\" has very nearly the outline of a horse shoe. Wholly different from the Tamils, and also somewhat different from the Vedd\u00e1s, is the \"tooth-curve\" of the Sinhalese. With them the palatal plate is unusually large and at the same time of considerable breadth, so that it is very large, but the sides are more parallel, and the region of the incisors forms a broader, flatter curve jutting out in front. The Os\n\n* [i.e., Medium orbital index,\u2014medium nasal index,\u2014projecting jaw,\u2014and short palate.\u2014T. B.]\npalatinum has a relatively large share with the Sinhalese in the formation of the palatal plate. The Tamil palatal index is in very striking contrast to the Sinhalese.\n\nThe facts given in respect to three of the most important regions of the skeleton face shew that great difficulties are encountered in attempting to ascertain the degree of affinity existing between these three tribes. If we take, as usual, the indices as guides we gain for each region another combination. Most nearly related are:\n\nAccording to the orbital index\u2014the Vedd\u00e1 and the Tamil.\nDo. nasal index\u2014\u201e Tamil \u201e \u201e Sinhalese.\nDo. palatal index\u2014\u201e Sinhalese \u201e Vedd\u00e1.\n\nWe must not forget however, that here only one individual is taken from each tribe, and that he by no means corresponds in every particular to the average of his tribe: the Author having had to select for his illustrations from the few skulls available those which gave the best indications of regular development, but which perhaps do not, in all respects, represent typical forms. The Author's work will have fulfilled its aim if it hastens the bringing up of better material. For the present he can only assert that, so far as we have a distinct view of the physical relations, as few evidences appear of a real affinity between the Tamils and the Vedd\u00e1s as between the Tamils and the Sinhalese.\n\nQuestion of Dravidian element in Vedd\u00e1s and Sinhalese.\u2014This, however, does not decide the question as to whether there is a Dravidian element in either the Vedd\u00e1s or the Sinhalese. We now know that the Tamils who made invasions and settlements in Ceylon came not only from the nearer points on the coast of India, but also from quite northern districts; and, before expressing a decided judgment, all the tribes of Hindustan which are usually embraced in the term \"Dravidas\" must be compared in turn. A comparison of this kind would here be out of place, and the material is not sufficient. For the present, it will only be stated that the physical condition of the Tamils, including those of the Coromandel coast, is not sufficient to represent perfectly the Dravidian type.*\n\n* Of two skulls from Tanjore,\u2014the Chola of the Sinhalese annals,\u2014one is dolicho-cephalic; the other mesocephalic; which is here typical? One is hypsikonch; the other mesokonch; one leptostaphyline; the other brachystaphyline. According to which shall we decide?\nin the mountains we come upon other Dravidas, such as the Kurumbars and other wild tribes of the Nilgherries, of stunted stature and debased type, who, to all appearance, are essentially different from the Tamils, and whose skull measurements show great similarity to those of the Vedd\u00e1s of Ceylon, while the form of their face, though differing from that in both Tamils and Vedd\u00e1s, is not so different from the latter as to justify an ethnological separation. Therefore, if one would search out the connection of the Vedd\u00e1s, and perhaps of the Sinhalese themselves, with Dravidian India, it would be advisable to go beyond the inhabitants of the coast, and bring the mountain tribes into comparison.\n\nBut even here the researches will not end; for, according to all probability, the present mountain tribes are not the real aborigines of Hindustan. We have the tradition that, together with the Kurumbars, the Veddas were the oldest inhabitants of Tondamandalam (Madras); and of them it seems was said \"there were then no forts, only huts; no kings; no religion; no civilization; no books; men were naked savages: no marriage institutions.\" And we have the tales of the fight of Vishnu with fabulous Assoors; and of the war of Rama upon Rawana, the Ceylon champion of the Yakkho and Rakshasas worship; and also the traditions preserved among the Hayas in Nepaul, and the Wouralis of the Konkan, that their tribes emigrated from Ceylon to their present mountain homes when Rawana was slain. Such traditions are, of course, of no positive value for the diagnosis of the different tribes, but they at least warn us not to decide as to the aboriginal races of India and Ceylon simply on the ground of some crude linguistic indications, or the physical characteristics of a few better known tribes. All the same, we cannot avoid the conviction that the earliest inhabitants of Ceylon stand in a close affinity to the aborigines of India.\n\nProto-Dravidians and Pre-Dravidians.\u2014Whether these aborigines were Proto-Dravidian, or even Pre-Dravidian tribes, we cannot with certainty decide at present. When the light-skinned Aryans from the Punjab invaded the land later called Hindustan, they found it already in the possession of numerous tribes of \"dark-skinned\" people, who, in the Vedd\u00e1s, are desig-\nnated by the generic name of *Dasyu* or *Dasa*. The greater part of them, as the conquerors penetrated further into the valley of the Ganges, were forced back on both sides, to the mountains northward into the Himalaya, and southward into the Vindhya; those who remained behind were adopted as *Sudras*, thus becoming a part of the Aryan organization. Hence nothing stands in the way of the assumption that the mountaineers in general belong to the aboriginal tribes. But neither does anything compel us to consider all these tribes of the Dasyu as homophylic [of one race.] M. Rousselet speaks most positively of an immigration of Thibetan tribes of the yellow race from the east, and another of Turanians from the west, before the Aryan invasion; but he assumes, as anterior to both, a population of *Negritoes*. To the admixture of the latter with yellow tribes he first of all ascribes the origin of the Proto-Dravidians, (counting among these the *Malars*, the *Konds*, and perhaps the *Gounds*); and only when fresh troops of invaders had again mixed with the Proto-Dravidians, arose, in his opinion, the Dravidas or Tamils. They brought the snake worship (Nagas) with them. On the other hand, from the immigration of the Turanians arose in the plains the *Yats*; in the mountains the *Bhils*, *Minas*, and *Mhairs.* He regards as the last remains of the primitive black population scattered remnants of a small black people upon the high plateaus of the Amarkantak, who became known under the name of *Djangals*, *Puttnas*, and *Yuangas* (*Dschuangs*) * If I have many doubts about admitting the distinctions of M. Rousselet, especially with regard to the assumption of a veritable Negrito race as the aboriginal race of India, I yet in nowise oppose the idea that the tribes of black-skins which the Aryans found established in the valley of the Ganges were mixed. How much Mongolian, Turanian or Negrito blood flowed in their veins must remain for the present undecided. But it is certainly not impossible that a part only of the Dasuya were Dravidians, and that even before the Proto-Dravidas of M. Rousselet, Pre-Dravidian tribes inhabited the land, Neither the Mongols nor the Turanians satisfactorily\n\n---\n\n* Col. Dalton states that these belong to the Kolars; and his description of these contains quite as many Mongolian as Negretian characteristics.\nexplain the stunted growth of the tribes of \"black-skins\" to whom even Pliny alludes as \"pigmies.\" All the information we have of them is so imperfect as to admit of being turned to account for any sort of opinion. M. de Quatrefages has collected accounts of the Negritoes in India from which he concludes definitely that Negritoes are still living in various parts of the country. I cannot esteem the evidence sufficient, but will not deny that the question is open to discussion.\n\nAs affording grounds for misgivings, reference may be made to the so-called Negrito race inhabiting several clusters of islands and parts of Malacca, and also to their neighbours, the \"little-blacks,\" who dwell in the Andaman islands. In various respects, as by their dark complexion, the smallness of their frames, and particularly of the head, they unquestionably shew a striking approach to the Vedd\u00e1s and Kurumbas. But the one circumstance of the difference in the form of the skull, which, with the Andamanese as well as the Negritoes generally, is in reality brachycephalic, distinguishes them definitely from all the Ceylon races. When to this is added that their hair grows in spiral coils and is to be classed with the wooly hair of the genuine Negro, every possibility disappears of a connexion with the Vedd\u00e1s, unless we assume that climatic influences have especially affected the hair. Even less analogy is found between Vedd\u00e1s and Australians, although M. Topinard has recently emphasized the supposed relationship of the Australians to the Vedd\u00e1s, as well as to the Bhils, Gonds, Khandas, Kurumbas, &c.\n\nMalay element.\u2014Very much more complicated is the question whether Malay elements were not infused into the aboriginal population of Ceylon. The Malays have extended there settlements much further, and even as far as Madagascar. There are, however, no obvious physical indications of such a relationship. Only Mr. Williams, an American Missionary in China, observed in the Sinhalese \"a Malay expression of countenance.\"\n\nConclusions.\u2014From the foregoing discussion we assume as proved:\n\n1st.\u2014That manifold resemblances exist between Vedd\u00e1s and Sinhalese; and that the origin of the Sinhalese race\nfrom a mixture of Vedd\u00e1s and immigrants from India possesses great probability, as well upon historical as also upon anthropological grounds.\n\n2nd.\u2014That the Vedd\u00e1s as well as the Sinhalese are, in the main features, distinguished from the Ceylon Tamils, and equally from those of Tanjore (Chola.)\n\n3rd.\u2014That on the other hand, among the remnants of the old Dravidian, or perhaps Pre-Dravidian tribes of Hindustan we find even today evidence of analogies with the Vedd\u00e1s.\n\nThe low development of the Veddas a race distinction and not a hereditary morbid condition.\u2014Have the Vedd\u00e1s remained in the condition of the Proto-Dravidians, or possibly Pre-Dravidians?\u2014or have they, in their isolation, sunk to a lower state? In other words, are they ethnologically to be turned to account in order to paint anew the picture of this primitive period? If, in spite of reasons which seem to the Author conclusive, one would assume that they have by degrees retrograded physically and intellectually, we should be forced to represent them as a pathological tribe; and the question suggests itself whether the tiny size of their skulls and small capacity for mental development be not microcephaly in the pathological sense? We can distinctly deny this suggestion. The individuality of the Vedd\u00e1s is psychically fully developed. So far as their needs demand they have matured their capacities and are able to take care of themselves and their children; and they even associate, so far as unavoidable, with neighbours and strangers in a free way and as self-determined men. They are distinguished in all the main features from microcephyles in the technical sense; and it may therefore be admitted, without hesitation, that the inferior bodily and mental development of the Vedd\u00e1s is not owing to a really morbid condition which, as such, might be hereditary, but is rather to be regarded as a race peculiarity.\n\nThis, however, by no means excludes the possibility that favourable outward circumstances, especially better food, might produce a more complete development, and the body become larger and stronger, the skull and brain formation more perfect. In fact such cases appear among the Vedd\u00e1s, as is proved by\nexamples of men far exceeding the average height, and by skulls having a capacity of 1,614 and 1,420 cub. cm. It might follow from this that the Sinhalese are civilized Vedd\u00e1s who simply owe the superiority of their physical development to their better life. But the Vedd\u00e1 race is still, as it was in ancient days, among the smallest of the living human tribes. Similar dwarfish tribes are scattered all over India, which possibly was in ancient times inhabited by tribes which had a close relationship to these. And with just as little propriety as the present Hindoos can be said to have sprung and progressively developed from these more or less dwarfish aborigines, does such a kind of explanation suit the connection of the Vedd\u00e1s with the Sinhalese. As they have not descended from the Sinhalese by regressive degeneration, neither surely have they been transformed by progressive evolution into Sinhalese. That no such affinity exists is proved chiefly by the form of the face, to which all observers testify. All descriptions, and history confirmed by the Ramayana, as well as the Wijeyan legend, shew that there can be no doubt that the Sinhalese face is an importation from the Aryan province of the Indian continent: while, directly to the contrary, all observers ascribe to the Veda face a foreign and, very frequently, Dravidian type. It becomes clear then that genealogical investigation must make the face a main object of study.\n\nIf the view be correct that the Vedd\u00e1s are a pure, the Sinhalese a mixed race, we may then leave the question out of consideration as to how far soil, food, and climate, and the like may have operated to determine the formation of the body, or the size of the head, or to transform the character of the hair from that of wooly-haired blacks like Negritoes, &c., to what we now find it. Although facts bearing more or less plausibly on this question may not be wanting, we should hesitate before applying arguments gathered from the history of domesticated animals to the savage inhabitants of Ceylon, at any rate until it is proved that the latter actually possessed in earlier times different physical characteristics. The present state of the hair plainly corresponds to the description given by Palladius, and must, therefore, have been just as it now is for at least fifteen hundred years.\nDirection of further enquiry: the Vedd\u00e1s a member of the pre-historic Dasuya group.\u2014It is very certain that if we would pursue the search for the origin of the Vedd\u00e1s genealogically, we must first turn our investigations to the savage or half-savage tribes of India. Every possible effort must be made to enlarge the facts bearing on Indian ethnology in order to be able to investigate radically the tribe of \"Black-skins.\" Since a part of the Dasuya were transferred to the Sudras, and consequently included in the caste system of the Hindoos\u2014as the Vedd\u00e1s in that of the Sinhalese\u2014it is not possible to bring to a conclusion the physical anthropology of the Hindoos and the Sinhalese, until we have resolved the evidently very composite group of the Dasuya into its separate members. One such member is plainly the tribe of the Vedd\u00e1s: their natural isolation upon an island has perhaps tended to preserve in them, more than in similar places upon the continent, their peculiar character, and made them an object by which to test the admissibility of the theories concerning the origin of the Black Indians. May the zeal of the observer know no flagging, that, before the utter extinction of this already much depleted race, the language and customs, the physical and mental constitution of the Vedd\u00e1s may, in all particulars, be firmly established.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File":
