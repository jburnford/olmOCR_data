Maxwell, proposed and the Hon. C. J. Saunders seconded that a vote of thanks be accorded to the retiring President for the great service that he had done to the Society in editing the Hikayat Sri Rama. This was passed.\n\nThe Hon. Secretary explained how exactly a map of the Peninsula projected by the Survey Department, F. M. S., would compete with the Society's, and that the Council saw no other course than to abandon their work towards a new Edition.\n\nThe Hon. C. J. Saunders, proposed and Mr. Ayre seconded that a vote of thanks be accorded to Mr. W. Makepeace for his services in auditing the accounts of the Society. This was passed.\n\nThere being no further business, the President asked Mrs. Legrew Watkins to exhibit her collection of articles used by the Ainu of Northern Japan; and the meeting became informal.\nANNUAL REPORT\nof the\nStraits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society\nfor 1915.\n\nMembership. During 1915 the following new members were elected:\n\nMr. A. F. Worthington, Mr. V. Knight.\n,, Lim Cheng Law, ,, A. W. H. Hamilton.\n,, See Tiong Hwa, ,, J. G. Raggi.\n,, H. C. W. Allen, ,, F. M. Baddeley.\nDr. C. Strickland, ,, J. W. Boyd-Walker.\nMr. L. Lewton-Brain, ,, C. C. Brown.\n,, O. T. Dussek, ,, H. D. Mundell.\n\nThe Branch lost by death 4 members, and from other causes 5 members.\n\nIn January 1916 the following were elected:--Messrs. H. W. Ford, T. G. Watson, Shiva Prasad Gupta, J. W. Cundell Ellis and Professor Argyll Campbell.\n\nCouncil. During the year Mr. Gold and Mr. Still resigned their places on the Council. To fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Gold\u2019s resignation, the Hon. W. G. Maxwell was co-opted. Mr. Still\u2019s place was not filled up.\n\nJournal. Three parts of the Journal were issued. The first part contained the Proceedings, and four short papers as follows:\u2014\n\nJ. E. Nathan, A Journey over the Main Range from Perak to Pahang.\nH. Overbeck, New Notes on the Game of Chongkak.\nH. N. Ridley, New and Rare Malayan Plants.\nI. H. Burkill, An Abnormality in the Coconut Palm.\n\nThe second part contained Dr. R. Hanitsch\u2019s monograph on the Malayan Blattidae or cockroaches. The last part contained the Hikayat Sri Rama verbatim from an old manuscript in the Bodleian\nLibrary, Oxford, which the University kindly enabled the Branch Society to use. The President edited the text, and the Council wish to record their gratitude to him for doing so.\n\nIn accordance with plans determined on in 1914, the parts of the journal were paged so as to make an annual volume, the Malay text forming an appendix. A title page and an index will be issued with the small part still unpublished.\n\nThe Council printed 550 copies of the first two parts but 1000 of the last, so that it may be sold to the public. As the text has been stereotyped, a second edition, if called for, will cost little. In order to sell the first edition the price has been fixed as low as the Society's expenses in procuring the photographic copy of the manuscript, in transcribing and in printing permit.\n\nTowards the 1916 Journal, the Council has eight papers actually in hand, including the Hikayat Marong Maha-wangsa or Annals of Kedah, promised in the Annual Report for 1914. As additional to the Journal, the Council has undertaken to publish the Reports on the Robinson-Kloss expedition to Korinchi Peak, Sumatra, and has put a part of the illustrations already into preparation.\n\nMap. Subject to confirmation at the annual meeting the Council has decided to abandon its preparations for a new edition of the Map of the Malay Peninsula in consequence of the projection of a similar map by the F. M. S. Survey Department.\n\nLibrary. One hundred and eighty-two volumes have been bound. They have been put onto the shelves, but cause a congestion which necessitates a rearrangement. A pair of pigeon-hole almairahs have been constructed especially for the holding of unbound periodicals.\n\nPhotographic Record. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining permanent photographic paper during the war, little progress has been made with the Photographic Record. Messrs. Topham, Jones and Railton have been so good as to present photographs and several members have offered negatives.\n\nFinances. The expenditure for the year exceeded the revenue. In the Treasurer's statement, appended, it is recorded that he received:\n\nBy subscriptions : : : $1329.68\nBy sales : : : 476.48\nBy interest : : : 385.75\n\n$2191.91\n\nand paid out $1932.04; but by the deduction of a printing bill paid in\n1915, amounting to $627.83, for the 1914 Journals and by the addition of a printing bill for $1998.44 dated 31st December last, for the 1915 Journals, etc., it is shown that $1110.74 was incurred above the receipts for the year. This excess has gone into the improvement of the Journal and into the sale copies of the Hikayat Sri Rama. It is hoped that it will come back in an increased membership and a demand for the latter publication, so rapid as to justify reprinting.\n\nApplication has been made to the Administrator of the Estate of the late Hon. Treasurer for the balance which was in his hands at his death.\n\nI. Henry Burkill,\n\nHon.

By rule 105 of this Society all the Members of Branch Societies are entitled when on furlough or otherwise temporarily resident within Great Britain, and Ireland, to the use of the Library as Non-Resident Members and to attend the ordinary monthly meetings of this Society.

Under rule 84, the Council of the Society is able to accept contributions to its Journal from Members of Branch Societies, and other persons interested in Oriental Research, of original articles, short notes, etc., on matters connected with the languages, archaeology, history, beliefs and customs of any part of Asia.\n\n4. By virtue of the afore-mentioned Rule 105 all Members of Branch Societies are entitled to apply for election to the Society without the formality of nomination. They should apply in writing to the Secretary, stating their names and addresses, and mentioning the Branch Society to which they belong. Election is by the Society upon the recommendation of the Council.\n\n5. The subscription for Non-Resident Members of the Society is 30/- per annum. They receive the quarterly journal post free.\n\n*Asiatic Society of Bengal.* Members of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, by a letter received in 1903, are accorded the privilege of admission to the monthly meetings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, which are held usually at the Society's house, 1 Park Street, Calcutta.\nA Fragment of the History of Trengganu and Kelantan.\n\nThe following fragment of the history of Trengganu and Kelantan was written in about 1876 by Haji Abdullah, a court historian in Trengganu. The manuscript is in the possession of Nara Wangsa Mohamed Ali, better known as the Dato' Mata-mata, of Trengganu. The fragment describes the struggles between Kelantan and Trengganu from about 1770 to 1835, when the further intervention by Trengganu in Kelantan affairs was peremptorily stopped by Siam. The Sultan Mahmud of Linggi referred to in the text was the father of Sultan Hussain of Singapore. He was driven out of Rio by the Dutch in 1785, and found a refuge in Trengganu until the capture of Malacca by the English in 1795 permitted his return to his own country. The Tuan Snik of Kampong Raja who was raised by the Siamese to the Raja-ship of Kelantan was the famous Sultan of the Red Mouth who reigned in Kelantan until his death in 1877. The present Sultan is his great-grand-son. The present Sultan of Trengganu is a descendant in the direct male line of Sultan Mansur.\n\nH.

This is a story related by old men, partly derived from the annals of Petani and Kelantan and partly from the annals of Sultan Mansur the Great the son of Zainalabidin the son of Abdulmajid, from the time when he went to Petani to the time when his son Sultan Zainalabidin went to Kelantan and stayed in Besut. Now the Rajas of Kelantan sprang from Dato\u2019 Wan who was called Raja of Petani after the time of\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 72, 1916.\nBaginda Nam Chayam. Dato' Wan's son was Dato' Pengkalan Tua and the latter had three sons, Dato' Pasir, Tuan Besar and Tuan Lun Nik. Dato' Pasir remained in Petani and the other two came to Kelantan, for at that time there was no Raja in Kelantan. After they were settled in Kelantan Dato' Pasir had a son Lun Pandak, Tuan Besar had a son Lun Nik, and Lun Nik had two daughters and a son Lun Yunus. Tuan Besar told Lun Nik to stay in Kelantan as he intended to make an expedition to the islands. It is not certain where he went, but suddenly there came news of his death. A certain Raja of Legeh conquered the country. He was called Baginda Lun Drahman, a brother of Lun Man and nephew of the Dato' of Pujud. While in Legeh Lun Drahman had a son named Lun Nik. After this Lun Drahman came with all his forces to Kelantan and there married a daughter of Lun Nik and so closely related himself to Lun Yunus. Not long after he quarrelled with his father-in-law and in the fight that ensued Lun Drahman got the worst of it. Not long after they fought again and once more he was defeated by his father-in-law. After a time he quarrelled again with his father-in-law who would not allow him a share in the government of the country. Lun Drahman still sought means to increase his power and another fight followed in which the father-in-law was worsted. So Lun Drahman killed his father-in-law and obtained possession of Kelantan. Lun Yunus retired to Trengganu and lived at Bukit Dato' and there he took to himself a concubine. From there he moved to Losong where a son named Lun Muhammad was born to him. He subsequently married Tuan Inche' Jumat, the eldest daughter of Ungku Tenang Wangsa. By her he had children, Inche' Wan Teh, Inche' Wan Ngah and Tuan Dagang. After Baginda Lun Drahman had obtained possession of Kelantan he appointed Lun Pandak as his representative to rule in Kelantan and himself returned to Legeh. In A. H. 1186 (A. D. 1771) a letter came from the Dato' of Jeram to Sultan Mansur asking for help and offering to accompany Sultan Mansur if he wished to acquire Pujud. At this time Sultan Mansur's age was 57. Sultan Mansur equipped a fleet consisting of several scores of vessels and proceeded to Petani taking Lun Yunus with him. When they arrived at Penarik in Petani in the district of Ru Sarang Lang he landed and the Dato' of Jeram gave suitable presents to the Raja to further his project. The Sultan then ordered Inche' Aim of Losong and Bandar Abdul Muluk to go to the Dato' of Pujud and inform him that the Sultan and his chiefs were coming to look into the affairs of Pujud. When these two men had conveyed this information to the Dato' he told them to make this humble reply to the Sultan: 'It is better for Your Highness to go back. Why follow the wishes of another? I am ready to follow your own wish but if you wish to follow that of another, even so Pujud will not be won.' If Your Highness desires merely to see the contest, match me with my enemy from the West. Whoever is defeated, Your Highness can adopt and cherish his\nvictor.\u201d At the same time he sent to the Sultan a present of 30 tahils of gold ore and in addition several buffaloes and bullocks and goats and several loads of rice and other things much exceeding the presents of the Dato\u2019 of Jeram. And each of the men who carried the presents was careful to take with him a bundle of spears. So there was no invasion of Pujud and the expedition returned to Trengganu. When it was known that Baginda Lun Drahman was in Legeh and that Lun Pandak alone remained in Kelantan Lun Yunus was very anxious to take Kelantan and asked permission of Sultan Mansur to do so. The Sultan granted his request and allowed the Dato\u2019 Temenggong to accompany him. When the expedition was ready they set out with a large force. When they arrived in Kelantan they seized the country and Lun Pandak retired to Legeh and Lun Yunus obtained possession of Kelantan. The Temenggong returned to Trengganu and shortly after Baginda Lun Drahman came with a large force to recover Kelantan from Lun Yunus. Lun Yunus retired to Trengganu (according to some accounts after an unsuccessful resistance) and Lun Drahman asked whether it was a manly act to seize his country when his back was turned. When Sultan Mansur heard the news he sent Inche\u2019 Kadir to Baginda Lun Drahman bidding him get ready as His Highness was coming to take Kelantan. Lun Drahman replied that he was glad to hear it as otherwise he would himself have had to go and take Trengganu. So Sultan Mansur collected 80 vessels and several thousands of soldiers were sent overland. The fleet sailed and when they had reached Stiu news was received that Baginda Lun Drahman had reached Telaga Tujoh with several thousands of his subjects fully equipped to attack Trengganu, and there could be seen many persons on the shore but it was doubtful whether they were enemies or friends. So Inche\u2019 Dahmad was ordered to go ashore and investigate. Suddenly Lun Drahman approached in a boat manned by 13 men; and some say that because of the bold and fearless manner of his approach, half the fleet began to pull up their anchors in their anxiety; but the other story is as follows:\u2014many people had gone to the Sultan\u2019s vessel and the Sultan enquired who would go ashore to find out the truth of the news, but no one replied; the Sultan looked at Wan Muhammad of Stiu who was sitting in the bow of the Sultan\u2019s vessel and told him to come forward. Wan Muhammad came as far as the foremast and the Sultan told him to come on. Wan Muhammad approached and the Sultan asked him if he would go ashore and see if the news about Lun Drahman was true. He replied that he would not refuse to do anything that the Sultan ordered. So the Sultan ordered him to go. He saluted the Sultan and got into a boat and told his children that he did not know whether he would ever return. He then sailed to the shore and the people on shore would have fired on him but refrained as they said he might be the bearer of a message. When he landed he met Baginda Lun Drahman himself. Baginda Lun Drahman addressed him by name, and coming close up to him said \u201cI put my\nlife into your hands.\u201d Wan Muhammad replied \u201cYour slave does the same. His life is in your hands and at your feet.\u201d When they had thus confided in one another, Baginda Lun Drahman said that if Wan Muhammad would answer for the anger of His Highness he would go and see him, and Wan Muhammad accepted the responsibility. They then got into the boat paddled by 13 men and rowed straight to the Sultan\u2019s vessel. When they reached it, they were both allowed to go on board. When they sat down before the Sultan, Baginda Lun Drahman presented the kris at his waist to the Sultan and the Sultan pulled off his coat and gave it to Baginda Lun Drahman, at the same time asking him the cause of the trouble in Kelantan. He replied that he submitted to the Sultan, but requested that during his lifetime he might rule on behalf of the Sultan. Sultan Mansur agreed to this and made him a present of a chest of opium. Baginda Lun Drahman then respectfully withdrew and returned in his boat to Legeh with all his followers. Sultan Mansur proceeded to Kelantan and made Lun Yunus Raja Muda of Kelantan under Lun Pandak. At this time the Sultan wished to take to wife Tang Snik the daughter of Lun Dil of Pulau Beluru. So he took her to wife and she bore to him Tengku Ahmad. After this he went back to Trengganu. Not long after the news came that Baginda Lun Drahman had gone to Benara for a cock fight. He was letting go his bird after the spurs had been fixed and was bending down to blow up the feathers, when it slipped from his hands and a spur struck Lun Drahman\u2019s head. Lun Drahman told his attendants to take away the bird as he said that his seer had foretold that he would not be wounded, but that if he was wounded he would die. So he returned to Legeh and became ill with another sickness and shortly after died. When the Raja Muda of Kelantan got the news he went over to assist in the matter of Lun Drahman\u2019s death. While the Raja Muda was in Kelantan there were born to him five sons by his concubine: Lun Yusuf, Lun Zainal, Inche\u2019 Ku Pelembang (daughter), Lun Tan, Lun Ismail, and Lun Pandak. And the Raja Muda was as it were a constable in Kelantan for Sultan Mansur, being under Lun Pandak only, at the time of Baginda Lun Drahman\u2019s death. Not long after the Raja Muda got into trouble on account of his government, and there was anger in Trengganu about it, so he was recalled to Trengganu and ordered to live near Bukit Jalan Kaliran, but shortly after he moved to Beladu and during this period Lun Pandak alone carried on the government of Kelantan. Not long after Lun Pandak rebelled and refused to recognise the government of Trengganu. Thereupon the Sultan ordered his fleet to be got ready to invade Kelantan. It was very nearly the twelfth moon when the fleet consisting of 80 vessels set sail and anchored in the harbour, and daily it grew nearer to the stormy season. The Dato\u2019 Temenggong went to the Sultan and said that in his opinion it was very near to the time when the river would be closed and that they had better return home. The Sultan however gave no\nanswer, so the Temenggong came a second time and said \"With regard to Kelantan let me and my three brothers, Raja Muda, Raja Besut and To' Limbat go to Kelantan. If we do not get Kelantan we will not come back to Trengganu but will go on the pilgrimage to Mecca.\" The Sultan agreed and he respectfully withdrew and the four of them went to their boats and set sail. They were accompanied by many other vessels and when near to Kelantan they saw a number of stockades along the sea shore. The Raja Muda and To' Limbat went ashore leaving the Temenggong in his boat. To all the commanders of the stockades the Raja Muda apportioned presents of cloth and coats and trousers and at the same time he gave them advice saying \"What are you doing in guarding these stockades against this expedition which is now at sea? His Highness owns Kelantan and Lun Pandak is only the representative of the late Lun Drahman. Will you not all get the reputation of being rebels against His Highness?\" They considered that this was true and they agreed to be faithful subjects to His Highness, and the Temenggong's boat came in and reported to His Highness who was at sea. He then came in and when the Raja Muda heard the royal commands they went up river, and when they met the enemy there was a fight and many people were killed and wounded. Lun Pandak retired and fled. When Kelantan was regained the Raja Muda was made Raja in Kelantan. Not long after he had returned to Trengganu, Inche' Wan Teh being now grown up, Sultan Mansur married her to his son Tungku Muhammad. In due time she bore a son Tungku Sulong. After the sovereignty of the country had been settled Sultan Mansur decided to make a large palace on ten pillars. So he sent for the Raja Muda of Kelantan to collect the necessary timber. The Raja Muda came with about a thousand men and stayed at Pasir Sebrang in many sheds and huts. The timber was collected in Sungei Nerus and when it was all got the Raja Muda asked permission to return to Kelantan as he was anxious about the country and he asked that one of the sons of His Highness should be sent to be a good steel blade in Kelantan. After he had been back some time and when Tungku Sulong was six or seven years old, Sultan Mansur equipped a vessel to take his son Tungku Muhammad with his wife and child and their retainers to Kelantan. At this time Sultan Mahmud of Lingga was in Trengganu and he accompanied the expedition. When the expedition reached Kelantan, Tungku Muhammad was dressed in state clothes belonging to Sultan Mahmud. He was overcome with a fit of shivering and seemed about to faint. Sultan Mahmud supported him and when he was composed it was proclaimed that His Highness the great Sultan had granted to his son Tungku Muhammad the title of His Highness of Kelantan and when the Sultan was about to return home he gave to Inche' Wan Teh the title of Inche' Puan of Kelantan. Then Sultan Mansur returned to Trengganu and Sultan Mahmud returned to Lingga. Three months later Sultan Mansur fell sick and he sent for His Highness\nof Kelantan. When the later had reached Batu Rakit, cannon announced the death of Sultan Mansur which took place at 12 p.m. on the eve of Friday the 14th of Jemadalakhir A. H. 1208 (A.D. 1793). The next day the body was washed and prayers were recited over it and his son (Zainalabidin) was proclaimed Sultan in the afternoon. The body was then carried in procession as befits a Raja and buried in the mosque. When the news of the Sultan\u2019s death reached the Raja Muda he was very grieved and it so changed his health that people said he showed the effects of the change until the end of his life. After eight or nine months in the month of Safar A. H. 1209 (A. D. 1794) he returned to his maker. About eight years after the death of Sultan Mansur the Sultan betrothed Tungku Sulong to his daughter Tungku Che Muda. His Highness of Kelantan made all preparations for the wedding and the kitchens alone remained to be made. His Highness ordered Lun Drahman and Lun Zainal and Tuan Dagang and Lun Dil to remove and rebuild the house at Kota Tras but from early morning to noon they did not obey the summons. Accordingly His Highness sent Lun Muhammad to see what was the difficulty. Lun Muhammad went and found them all taking shelter under a tree. Lun Drahman said \u201cHow is it that you are doing nothing when His Highness has ordered you to rebuild the house?\u201d Lun Drahman said \u201cCome here.\u201d So Lun Drahman went to him. Then Lun Zainal said \u201cWhat do you think of these Trengganu men coming here? Do you think we shall be lean or fat? It is Tengku Che\u2019 Muda who has come and he has brought with him Lun Mydin and Lun Daud, whose father you killed; the others do not count.\u201d Lun Muhammad replied \u201cWhat single resource have I got?\u201d and they said \u201cThat does not matter as long as we are all agreed\u201d and Lun Muhammad replied \u201cIf that is so, I will fall in with the general opinion.\u201d After this each came up with such weapons as he had but there was only one flask of gunpowder. Then Lun Muhammad went back to His Highness who asked him for his report. He told His Highness that all of them were sick, some with head-aches and some with stomach-aches, and that the house was not yet pulled down. In the meantime the Trengganu fleet arrived with all the paraphernalia for the wedding and with many women. His Highness of Kelantan went on board the Sultan\u2019s vessel and told him all about the house etc. Then His Highness of Kelantan returned. The Sultan ordered Tuan Syed Akil and Bandar Abdul Muluk and the Dato\u2019 Mata-mata Inche\u2019 Saleh to call Lun Muhammad. When they met him and gave him the Sultan\u2019s summons Lun Muhammad answered \u201cI respect the summons, and you who bring it here are as fathers to me. His Highness of Kelantan promised to take me with him to the Sultan, but he has already gone to the Sultan alone. At this hour, as you see I cannot go; I should be afraid to go alone and moreover I have a head-ache.\u201d It was evening and the messengers went back and told the Sultan. The Sultan then changed his plans and thought it would be better to-\nhave the wedding in Trengganu, for he said that if Lun Muhammad came there was not likely to be any trouble with the others. So he ordered His Highness of Kelantan and Inche' Puan to be told to get their things on board. After Syed Akil and his companions had returned from summoning Lun Muhammad, Lun Muhammad went to His Highness of Kelantan and informed him of the Sultan's summons. His Highness of Kelantan told him that he had better go to the Sultan. He replied \"If Your Highness goes I will go with you.\" But His Highness said \"If I do not go it does not matter.\" Lun Muhammad went back and induced his friends and four or five young Rajas who sided with him to accompany him until he had a following of four or five hundred men. Inche' Rashad said \"Who are these trying to set the Sultan's boat adrift?\" and when they came to the Sultan he said \"Well, Lun Muhammad, you have come at last,\" and not a drop of coffee was served. Not many hours later Lun Muhammad retired and shortly after a cannon was fired from Pulau Sabar, and that night the Sultan ordered boats to go up river to bring down all the women. As they went the noise of timber-cutting was heard and the glimmer of lights was seen. The next day when the women were being brought down a stockade was seen. So the boats with all the women proceeded down river and joined the Sultan's vessel. The next day, Friday morning, a cannon was fired from Syed Akil's boat in the direction of Kampong Laut and Pulau Sabar. All the boats then fired their cannon that Friday from morning until evening, but there were only occasional replies from the enemy and at night the firing ceased. Next morning the firing was resumed and a shot came in the direction of Tikat from Syed Osman's boat and fell on Tungku Che Muda's boat. This caused great consternation and there was as great confusion as if there were desertion to the enemy. When the Sultan was informed he replied that he had not come prepared for war but for a wedding and that as there appeared to be a hitch in the proceedings they had better go back to Trengganu. The firing then ceased and by the help of God the Sultan suffered no losses amongst his people except that one man who was steering the boat of Wan Muhammad of Kebur was shot in the mouth and killed. The Sultan's fleet then sailed out and went to Trengganu. When the two rulers arrived back in Trengganu the wedding of Tungku Che Muda was not proceeded with that year and the only business was that of the next year's war and the increase and improvement of weapons. Messages were also sent to Petani asking for help from Dato' Lun Ismail, and in the second year when the harbours were open, they collected the young Rajas who were going by land with their penghulus and followers, viz. Ungku Muda, Tuan Inche' Kepong, Tuan Jamal Maras, Tuan Sulaiman, Tuan Mahamud and Inche' Ungku Long. They were followed by boats with ammunition and other things, as a reserve against a shortage. The fighting penghulus with their followers who were taken were Inche' Udin of Serada and Penghulu Bahrul of Serada and Penghulu Deman\nand Pa\u2019 Sulong of Dunah and the keeper of the war flags was Penghulu Sapai of Pertang. All of them had hundreds of followers and Inche\u2019 Udin had a thousand followers. When they were all ready to start the Sultan sailed with his young Rajas and great men and with a large number of boats of all descriptions. The expedition stopped at Besut and waited several days for the boat of Inche\u2019 Aim of Losong as he was sick. The Sultan amused himself by going backwards and forwards to Besut while waiting for news of Panglima Prang Inche\u2019 Abdullah, who had gone in a boat to Petani to see if Dato\u2019 Lun Ismail would collect his fleet. Suddenly Inche\u2019 Aim came from Trengganu and roused his Highness by asking if they were going to wait on account of two men before they attacked the country. The Sultan then hastily proceeded in the fishing boat named \u201cBujang Sa\u2019 ribu\u201d and thence sailed to Kelantan. The fleet which accompanied the Sultan went right to Kelantan but the Sultan himself stopped at Pulau Ketitir in Sungei Pinang. Now those who had travelled overland had already got into touch with the enemy and after stockade fighting for about twenty days the enemy had retired and made a stand at Lubok Limau Nipis. The stockade at Semerak was captured and then Lubok Limau Nipis was attacked and in the end similarly captured. The enemy then retired to Kubu Kandih and it was also captured and the enemy retired and made a stand at the stockade of Klun Tarak in Kelantan. This stockade was in turn attacked and here the attackers were supported by the fleet attacking the villages alongside the river in Kelantan, only seven or eight boats remaining to guard the Sultan\u2019s vessel at Pulau Ketitir. After the fighting had lasted several days Lun Muhammad gave a letter to Ungku Muda saying that he was retiring to Sukui and asking for pardon and requesting that he should not be followed to Sukui as he would no longer be a rebel against the descendants of the late Sultan. He added that if he rebelled again he trusted that he and his descendants might be entirely ruined. After Lun Muhammad had retired to Sukui, Inche\u2019 Udin of Serada met the royal ladies who had fled on elephants with their husbands and Inche\u2019 Udin said he would capture them and hand them over to his penghulu. His children tried to dissuade him but he would not listen to them. Suddenly Inche\u2019 Udin met the husband of the ladies with a lot of their people. These rescued the ladies and after a fight Inche\u2019 Udin and fifty or sixty of his followers were killed. At this place Inche\u2019 Lok made Inche\u2019 Ahmad bin Isahak get up and said \u201cWhere are the rest of the men who gorge their food by trays full at the palace?\u201d Inche\u2019 Ahmad rushed with Inche\u2019 Sharif of Pulau Ketam in order to thrust a spear at Lun Dil who was on an elephant. They were shot at from the elephant and missed but the driver of the elephant stabbed Inche\u2019 Ahmad and Inche\u2019 Sharif from underneath the elephant and both were killed, and the fugitives went on to Sukui. After the Kelantan men had retired to Sukui all those who were fighting on land plundered whatever\nthey could get in the way of buffaloes, bullocks etc. And they burnt all the houses in the districts of Kenali and Ja Kechil and Ja Besar and the Balai Jawa at Kampong Raja. After this they remained about a month longer in Kelantan. Altogether including the time on the road and the time of the actual fighting it was about five months before those who went by sea reached Trengganu. Some time after the war news was received that Lun Muhammad had retired to Hulni. And at this time everyone plundered as much as he could. After this His Highness of Kelantan moved from his boat to his house in Kelantan and His Highness of Trengganu went up stream. About this time Lun Daud wanted to marry a daughter of the Orang Kaya of Tandun. But when he asked for her her father said that she was already betrothed. The father then went to His Highness of Kelantan and His Highness said that if Lun Daud attempted to get the girl by force he was to resist him, and, as a sign of His Highness's authority to do so, he gave him a spear. So when Lun Daud came with Lun Mydin and tried forcibly to carry out his wish the father resisted him with the emblem of His Highness's authority. Lun Daud complained to His Highness of Trengganu. The Sultan said \"You have come on a business of life and death, and yet in the matter of a single person you are making trouble.\" The Sultan then wished to go back, and leaving only Tungku Ahmad and Tungku Endak he took with him many good men and followers and waited for Dato' Lun Ismail to accompany him in his attack up river. After the Sultan had started back the Dato' came and the Sultan's commands were conveyed to him. So they all went together to attack the stockade at Pasir Mas. When they had attacked for a few days there suddenly came many people of Lun Muhammad's party supported by several thousands of Chinese from Galas. These crept in and could not be stopped by the Petani and Trengganu people, and both those who had come by boat and those who had come by land had to retreat. After they had returned to their countries, in the third year, there was an armed expedition, but it stopped some days in Besut. Here the Sultan was suddenly taken ill and went back. After the war was over in A. H. 1217 (A. D. 1802) in the 11th moon on the 21st of Rejab the wedding of Tungku Che Muda and Tungku Sulong was celebrated in Trengganu. In many years they got no children. The mother, Inche Puan of Kelantan had only the one son Tungku Sulong, and Inche' Wan Teh (sic) the younger sister of Inche' Puan, had a daughter named Meriam who married Tungku Salam. Tuan Dagang, the younger brother of Inche' Wan Ngah had children: Raja Inche', Raja Mai, Tuan Kechik, Tang Snik, Lun Drahman, and Tuan Snik of Sungei Pinang. Lun Muhammad had no children. Lun Yusuf had seven children; Lun Ahmad, Tuan Bulat, Lun Saleh, Lun Omar, Lun Ibrahim, and two daughters, one Ungku Tiba the wife of Lun Nik Pati the son of Lun Koris, and the other the wife of Tun Lun Hassan. Lun Zainal had five children; Lun Drahman, Ungku Lebai, Ungku\nTengah, Tuan Kling, and Lun Dris; Inche' Ungku Pelembang had no children by her husband Ungku Kakong, and later became the wife of Ungku Kadir of Besut. Lun Ismail had three children: Tun Besar who became Raja of Petani, Lunk Nik of Kampong Laut, and Tuan Busu. Lun Tan had five children: Lun Nik of Gagap, Tun Snik of Kota, Tuan Snik of Kampong Sireh, Tun Busu, and a daughter Tuan Besar who became the wife of Tuan Besar of Petani. Lun Pandak had one son, Tun Snik of Lebar. So Lun Muhammad got back Kelantan in the former war when he was helped by the Chinese of Galas. He ruled for several years and gave to Tuan Dagang the title of Ungku Sewa Raja; Lun Drahman of Kuala Cha was called Lun Raja; Lun Zainal was called the Raja Bendahara, and Lun Tan the Raja Temenggong. And the reign of Lun Muhammad was established from the 10th or 11th of Rejab A. H. 1216 (A. D. 1801) to his death at midnight on the eve of Wednesday the 27th of Safar A. H. 1251 (A. D. 1835). His reign lasted 34 years 7 months and 7 days, and from the date of Lun Muhammad's death his relations allowed Lun Zainal to be Raja, Lun Ahmad to be Raja Muda, Tuan Snik of Kota to be Bendahara, Tun Snik of Kampong Sireh to be Temenggong and Tuan Besar to be Perdana Mantri. About two months later, the two Tuan Sniks conspired to seize the kingdom from Lun Zainal and Lun Ahmad. So they attacked the Raja's fort, but meeting with resistance they retired to Kelupan and admitted their error. Lun Ahmad would have crushed them but Lun Zainal would not allow him and the Siamese intervened. Then the Tuan Sniks went to Banggul and made a stockade there, and surrounded both Lun Zainal and Lun Ahmad in the Raja's fort, and when they had been shut up there for about four months Lun Zainal got out and retired to Benara. After nearly six months Lun Ahmad managed to get out and lived at the mosque at Sungei Budul. Then he retired to Tumpat, and after forty days Tuan Lonik of Tapong with Tuan Besar made a stockade at Titian Papan and attacked the stockade of Tuan Busu of Bachok. Tuan Besar induced Lun Ahmad to accompany him to Tumpat. They came to Pekan and went to Kampong Bukit but they were pursued by Tun Snik of Kota and Ungku Sri Mas. These two met Lun Ahmad on the hill and fought there for several days until Ungku Sri Mas was transfixed with a spear by Tuan Bulat the son of Lun Koris. He was borne on a litter to Limbat and Kelantan was very nearly regained by Lun Ahmad owing to the defeat of the other side. Then Lun Hamad went to Lekub Titian Papan to seize the stockade of Tuan Busu of Bachok, when there suddenly came men from Siam bringing letters appointing Tun Snik of Kampong Sireh as Raja and Tun Snik of Kota was given the title of Sultan Dewa. Then Lun Ahmad realised that however much he resisted he could get nothing owing to the orders from Siam. So he went to Bachok and took boat to Trengganu. He had not been long in Trengganu when letters came to Trengganu from Siam ordering Lun Ahmad\nto be removed for fear of a disturbance with Kelantan. So he was removed to Kemamam. This collection of tales from the annals was finished on Sunday the 23rd of Rejab A. H. 1285 (A. D. 1868) by the hand of Abdullah, a poor and humble mosque official.\n\nWritten on Saturday 16th Shawal A. H. 1293 (A. D. 1876).\nA Naning Wedding-Speech.\n\nJ. L. Humphreys,\nStraits Settlements Civil Service.\n\nI first heard this speech in the year 1908, at a wedding in Naning. It was recited by a Malay, Ungkai Lisut, local headman of the Mungkar tribe at Kelemak, Alor Gajah. The bridegroom was one of his clansmen. After the usual fencing, fireworks, and show of resistance below the house, in which, I remember, some Hailam kulis gave an amusing display of Chinese boxing, Ungkai Lisut, with several of his tribesmen, led the bridegroom up the steps on to the verandah of the bride\u2019s house. The headman of her clan was seated at the far end with the party of the bride, and to him Ungkai Lisut addressed this recital, pausing after each period, and raising his hands together in salute with each repetition of the words \u201cSembah, Dato\u2019!\u201d\n\nThe ritual was conducted with considerable solemnity, and was followed with close attention: doubtless portions of it had a semi-religious significance in pre-Muhammadan days. On its conclusion the usual wedding ceremonies were continued.\n\nI asked Ungkai Lisut some time afterwards to repeat the speech, and took it down in writing: he had no record of it but his own memory. In the year 1914, meeting him in Singapore, I again asked him to recite it: he did so without hesitation, and with hardly the alteration of a word.\n\nThis set speech is an interesting exposition of the domestic Menangkabau custom still surviving in Naning. A very complete discussion of the fuller exogamic custom of Negri Sembilan is given in Rembau, Parr and Mackray, volume 56 of the Journal.\n\nThe homely precepts of the recitation recall more than one passage in the Second Georgic: among the Naning, as among the Virgilian, peasantry are still found\n\n\\[\n\\text{...patiens operum exiguoque assueta juventus,}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Sacra deum sanctique patres.}\n\\]\n\nI am indebted to Mr. W. H. Mackray, of the F. M. S. Civil Service, who has kindly read through this paper, for several valuable suggestions, which I have adopted.\n\nThe following is a short summary of the recital:\n\nOur lives are guided by religious law, and by ancient Menangkabau custom.

Under Menangkabau exogamic custom, the bride-groom on marriage is severed from his own tribe, and enters into the tribe of the bride.\n\n(2) Line 61. The husband is subject to the family of his wife, (tempat semenda,) lives in her house, and tills her fields. On divorce the children of the marriage remain with her; joint earnings or debts are divided; he removes the personal property brought by him to the marriage.\n\n(3) Line 71. A Malay child, immediately on birth, before the severance of the umbilical cord, is given a name by one of the parents; that is, a baby name or pet name; the true name is given subsequently.\n\nThe meaning of lines 71 and 72 is that the peculiar debt of the parents commences to run from the moment of birth: it ends with the marriage of the child. The clan is the judge of its proper fulfilment. (Line 89.)\n\n(4) Lines 98 and 99 are customary phrases to describe the activities of the go-betweens, who make the informal advances that precede a formal proposal of marriage.\n\nKechapi is a Chinese string instrument, played after the fashion of a guitar.

MacFadyen.\n\nKuala Lumpur is generally assumed to be a descriptive title\u2014'Muddy Mouth'\u2014but the use of a descriptive epithet to qualify the word Kuala is so unusual, that one frequently hears ingenious explanations put forward to account for it in this instance.\n\nKuala in place names is commonly qualified by the name of the river or tributary which debouches at that point into the sea or a main river; Kuala Perak for instance or Kuala Kubu. If one met a Kuala Merah it would naturally be the name of a place where a Sungei Merah flowed into some larger river. I do not think it would occur to Malays to speak of a place as Kuala Merah because the water there had a red tinge.\n\nSome old residents of Kuala Lumpur have even gone the length of suggesting that a small stream known as the Sungei Lumpur once flowed into the Klang where the Selangor Government offices now stand. If so the name Kuala Lumpur would be quite natural; but I much doubt there being any historical basis for this hypothesis.\n\nAn old Malay who worked for me in Kuala Langat used to speak of Kuala Lumpur as Pengkalen Lumpur and I have once or twice questioned Malays on the subject who said that old-fashioned people used that name for the place. It is to be noted, moreover, that the town of Klang was formerly known as Pengkalen Batu; a name by which it is still considered good form to describe the place in full dress writing.\n\nAt a time when there were only two settlements on the Klang river it appears probable enough that one should be called Pengkalen Batu and the other Pengkalen Lumpur. The place up stream, however, was from the first almost exclusively a Chinese settlement and anyone who has heard Chinese residents of places like Pengkalen Durian or Pengkalen Kempas refer to these places will agree that 'Kalen Lumpur is about as near an approximation to the correct form as they would be at all likely to attain.\n\nI suggest that this is possibly the origin of the name. The transition, by a false analogy, to Kuala Lumpur would be tempting to people much more accustomed to Malay place names beginning with a Kuala than with a Pengkalen; and at a time when the 'tulisan Roman' was an undiscovered art there would be few obstacles to the mistaken version becoming stereotyped. No large or indigenous Malay element existed in the population to correct such tendency.\nHikayat Marong Maha Wangsa.\n\nor\n\nKedah Annals.\n\nEDITED\n\nBY\n\nA. J. STURROCK\n\nF. M. S.

Ada-pun raja itu ayah-nya dari-pada indra dan bonda-nya itu asal-nya dari-pada dewa-dewa. Maka terbuka-lah pintu hati-nya gemar dan suka ia beristri akan anak raja gergasi karena puteri itu kecil lagi baik rupa paras-nya dan asal bonda-nya dari-pada rakasa. Maka jadi tiada-lah suka ayah bonda-nya Raja Marong Mahawangsa akan dia beristrikan tuan puteri itu. Maka oleh raja Marong Mahawangsa barang ka-mana ia pergi di-bawa-nya istri itu bersama-sama dengan dia tiada ditinggalkan dengan segala menteri para penggawa sida-sida biduanda rayat sakalian, karena raja Marong Mahawangsa itu ia ketahui ilmu kesaktian dan di-takuti oleh sakalian raja-raja. Maka titah raja Rum ka-pada raja Marong Mahawangsa, \u201cHai, Saudara hamba hendak-lah saudara pergi ka-benua China ganti hamba membawa pergi paduka anakanda ini kahwinkan dengan anak raja benua China.\u201d Maka sembah raja Marong Mahawangsa, \u201cBaik-lah tuanku barang yang di-titahkan itu patek kerjakan tuanku.\u201d Sa-telah itu, maka Sultan Rum pun menghadzirkan sa-buah bahtera akan kenaikan anakanda baginda itu dengan segala anak menteri penggawa hulubalang dengan empat puluh empat anak raja-raja dan sa-buah bahtera akan kenaikan raja Marong Mahawangsa dengan segala menteri para penggawa hulubalang rayat mengiringkan anak raja Rum itu.

Maka segala kapal itu pun membongkarkan sauh-nya serta menaikkan layar-nya masing-masing, lalu beralayar-lah sakalian mengikut bahtera anak raja Rum dan bahtera raja Marong Mahawangsa, sa-tengah dahulu sa-tengah kemudian bertaburan pohon-lah laut menuju hala-nya ka-benua China. Hata beberapa lama-nya beralayar dari-pada negeri Rum itu, maka sampai-lah ka-tengah arongan dengan beberapa melalui kuala negeri raja-raja yang taalok ka-pada raja Rum. Maka sakalian raja-raja itu pun datang-lah menghantar makanan dan hadiah berbagai-bagai jenis dari-pada sa-buah negeri ka-pada sa-buah negeri karna sakalian itu negeri yang besar-besar jua taalok ka-pada benua Rum. Maka dengan hal yang demikian pelayaran pun sampai ka-laut sabelah Hindustan. Maka terlalu banyak segala yang ajaib-ajaib dan yang indah-indah kelihatan pada mata sakalian-nya itu. Maka di-pintasi juga merentas segala tanjong-tanjong terlalu-lah ramai-nya beralayar itu. Ada pun pelayaran angkatan anak raja Rum hendak pergi kahwin ka-benua China itu ada-lah seperti burong terbang ka-sarang dan tiang-nya seperti batang para rupa laku-nya, barang di-mana beraloboh dan berhenti itu seperti pulau yang besar serta dengan segala bunyi-bunyian pun di-palu orang-lah terlalu adzmat bunyi-nya seperti akan terangkat-lah lautan itu tam-\n\nJour.

Ada pun sakalian-nya belayar itu tiada jauh dari tanah daratan hingga kelihatan jua daratan itu. Maka sampai-lah ka-laut Kuala Chang-gong nama-nya dan nama raja-nya negeri itu Kelinggi. Maka kelihatan-lah pada mata sakalian datang t\u00e9doh r\u00e9dum dari sa-b\u00e9lah matahari hidup itu seperti hendak menimpa atas segala kapal kecuali bahtera. Maka tengah belayar itu datang-lah kelam kabut guroh petir dengan hebat dahshat datang-nya itu, seperti pohon ribut angin yang besar rupa-nya. Maka bahtera kenaikan anak raja Rum pun mendekati kenaikan raja Marong Mahawangsa. Maka titah anak raja Rum Suroh bertanya apa juga yang datang di-hadapan itu seperti hendak menimpa di-atas segala perahu itu. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa seg\u00e9ra-lah naik ka-atas b\u00e9randa bahtera-nya dengan alat senjata-nya. D\u00ebmi di-libat-nya yang datang itu bukan-nya dari-pada angin ribut tofan hanya bunyi sayap burong terbang juga akan datang rupa-nya hendak merosakkan segala perahu sakalian-nya. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun bertitah ka-pada sakalian-nya suroh beringat-ingat alat senjata masing-masing tangan serta mengisi ubat bedil meriam jangan dil\u00e9pakan. D\u00ebmi di-dengar oleh sakalian-nya titah raja Marong Mahawangsa itu, maka ia pun meng\u00e9rahkan sakalian orang-nya suroh beringat-ingat serta memegang senjata masing-masing tangan.\n\nAda pun burong g\u00e9roda itu sa-telah nyata-lah angkatan anak ra'ia Rum itu, maka datang-lah marah-nya, lalu ia pun terbang datang menyambar langsung di-halakan-nya ka-sa-b\u00e9lah matahari jatoh. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun menarek busar anak panah-nya yang bernama ayun-ayunan itu ka-udara b\u00e9g\u00e9muroh-lah bunyi seperti halilintar memb\u00e9lah. Maka seg\u00e9ra-lah di-t\u00e9piskan dengan sayap-nya tiada k\u00e9n\u00e4. Maka segala yang memasang bedil meriam itu pun di-pasang-nya hala ka-langit tiada b\u00e9rhenti lagi, jikalau guruh petir di-langit pun tiada kedengaran lagi bunyi adzmat-nya. D\u00ebmi di-libat oleh burong g\u00e9roda terlalu banyak alat senjata yang datang hendak meng\u00e9na\u00ef dia, maka ia pun tiada ambil tahu karena tiada memb\u00e9ri guna ka-pada burong g\u00e9roda itu habis b\u00e9rt\u00e9rbangan p\u00e9rgi hala ka-lain ka-sana ka-mari.

D\u00ebmi di-libat oleh raja Marong Mahawangsa hal kelakuan burong g\u00e9roda itu k\u00e9saktian menurunkan hujan angin ribut guroh petir itu, maka seg\u00e9ra-lah ia mengambil anak panah yang bernama ayun-ayunan bichara m\u00e9nahahkan angin ribut burong g\u00e9roda itu hujong-\n\nR.

Maka dari-pada tiada bercerenti datang senjata kena ka-pada tuboh-nya burong geroada itu, maka ia pun tiada memb\u00e9ri guna ka-pada-nya. Maka burong geroada itu pun raib-lah pergi hala-nya ka-darat lantas ka-hutan rimba belantara. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa hendak membals panah sa-kali lagi tiada sempat karena burong geroada itu terlalu cepat dan tangkas-nya ia terbang itu. Maka hari pun malam-lah lalu bercerenti sakalian-nya pada malam itu. Telah kecesokan hari-nya di-nanti-nanti-nya kalau-kalau datang burong geroada itu melanggar pula tiada datang. Maka sakalian-nya pun belayar-lah pula tiada juga jauh dari-pada daratan. Antara boborapa hari belayar sakalian-nya itu dengan tempek sorak serta memalu segala bunyi bunyian sa-panjang laut. Maka sampai-lah ka-laut Kuala Tawai nama-nya. Maka datang-lah burong geroada itu dengan hebat dan garang-nya seperti tiada beralawan-lah kelakuan rupa-nya datang dengan angin ribut guruh petir kilat sabong menyabong. Maka oleh raja Marong Mahawangsa segera disuruh kembaran bahteria itu dengan bahteria kenaikan anak raja Rum itu. Maka segala kapal dan kechi pun beraloh-lah berceliling bahteria kenaikan dua buah itu masing-masing memegang senjata. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun naik-lah ka atas beranda bahteria-nya itu dengan alat senjata serta memegang panah-nya yang bernama \"beran pura\" itu bernyala-nyala api di-hujong-nya segera di-tarek busar-nya. Maka di-kenaikan-nya anak panah beran pura itu lalu di-panahkan-nya naik ka-udara bergemuroh-lah bunyi-nya. Maka turun-lah anak panah itu menerbangkan segala yang kalam kabut dzalmat dan angin ribut hujan itu pun habis-lah sakalian-nya hilang. Maka kelihatan-lah burong geroada itu sudah menerbangkan kapal tiga buah di-dalam kalam dzalmat itu juga. Maka sorak tempek pun terlalu-lah adzmat tambahkan dengan bunyi bedil meriam pun seperti berteh dan tagar di-langit sa-kali pun tiada juga kedengaran ka-pada sangat adzmat itu hingga dengan kalam kabut asap bedil juga di-dalam banyak peluru meriam dan bedil itu dengan bellerapa pula anak panah segala raja-raja seperti hujan yang lebat rupa-nya datang mengena ka-pada tuboh burong geroada itu suatu pun tiada singgah habis bertaburan dan bercibaran melayang di-dalam laut itu, jika kena ka-tuboh burong geroada itu jangan pun hendak luka tuboh-nya pun tiada luroh barang sa-helah jua pun. Maka terlalu-lah ramai dengan tempek scrak-nya mereka itu bergempita di-dalam laut itu. Sa-ketika lagi datang pula burong itu terbang melayangkan diri-nya seperti angin tofan yang besar bunyi-nya dan suara-nya seperti bunyi guruh dan halilintar membela.

Maka g\u0113roda pun datang-lah sep\u0113rti ribut tofan yang t\u0113r-amat b\u0113sar menyambar dan m\u0113mukul d\u0113ngan savap-nya dan m\u0113-n\u0113ndang d\u0113ngan kaki-nya ka-hadapan baht\u0113ra anak raja Rum itu hingga habis-lah karam t\u0113nggelam s\u0113gala kapal dan orang pun banyak-lah mati dari-pada hidup b\u0113rtaburan sa-panjang laut itu. Maka tatkala itu anak raja Rum pun b\u0113rp\u0113gang pada suatu papan di-dalam laut itu d\u0113ngan sa-orang diri-nya habis-lah binasa s\u0113gala kapal dan kechi s\u0113rta sakalian baht\u0113ra anak raja Rum itu, pada sangka hati burong g\u0113roda mati-lah sudah anak raja Rum itu. Maka ia pun k\u0113mbali-lah ka-pulau Langkapuri. Ada pun akan raja Marong Mahawangsa sa-t\u0113lah hari sudah siang lalu ia pun b\u0113layar m\u0113nurut anak raja Rum itu ada-nya.\n\nShahadan tiada beberapa lama-nya b\u0113layar itu sampai-lah ka-pada t\u0113mpat anak raja Rum itu rosak lalu b\u0113rt\u0113mu d\u0113ngan orang b\u0113r\u0113nang di-ambil-nya dan b\u0113rtanya. Maka di-hikayatkan orang itu s\u0113gala hal-nya yang di-binasakan oleh burong g\u0113roda malam tadi. D\u0113mi di-d\u0113ngar oleh raja Marong Mahawangsa yang d\u0113mikian itu, maka di-suroh layar kapal p\u0113rgi m\u0113nchari kalau-kalau b\u0113rt\u0113mu d\u0113ngan anak raja Rum itu. Maka di-charikan orang-lah tiada b\u0113rjumpa sa-hingga b\u0113rt\u0113mu d\u0113ngan orang lain juga b\u0113rtaburan pada s\u0113gala laut itu. Hata beberapa hari lama-nya anak raja Rum itu tiada b\u0113rjumpa d\u0113ngan siapa-siap aja pun. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun t\u0113rlalu-lah k\u0113mashghulan hati-nya karna ia suatu harapan yang b\u0113sar ka-pada Sultan Rum itu. Maka di-suroh-nya chari pada s\u0113gala m\u0113nt\u0113ri para p\u0113nggawa hulubalang sakalian tiada juga b\u0113rt\u0113mu. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun b\u0113layar-lah hala ka-sa-b\u0113l\u0101h timur d\u0113ngan baht\u0113ra-nya m\u0113nyusur daratan tanah b\u0113sar itu sambil m\u0113nchari anak raja itu. Hata d\u0113ngan hal yang d\u0113mikian, maka sampai-lah ka-pada suatu t\u0113lok d\u0113ngan suatu tanjong. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun b\u0113rtanya pada sa-orang malim yang tua di-dalam baht\u0113ra-nya itu. Maka kata-nya, \u201cBahwa pulau yang b\u0113sar itu baharu hendak b\u0113rsatu d\u0113ngan daratan itu b\u0113rnama Pulau S\u0113ri, dan pulau k\u0113chil itu b\u0113rnama Pulau Jambul dan ka-darat-nya s\u0113dikit b\u0113rnama Pulau Lada, tuanku.\u201d Maka titah raja Marong Mahawangsa \u201cJikalau d\u0113mikian, singgah-lah b\u0113rlaboh kita di-tanjong pulau itu.\u201d Maka b\u0113layar-lah baht\u0113ra itu m\u0113nuju ka-t\u0113mpat yang di-titah oleh raja Marong Mahawangsa itu. Sa-t\u0113lah sampai maka b\u0113rlaboh-lah baht\u0113ra itu. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun d\u0113ngan s\u0113gala m\u0113nt\u0113ri hulubalang naik ka-darat. Maka tatkala itu datang-lah kaum g\u0113rgasi orang-nya b\u0113sar-b\u0113sar t\u0113rlalu banyak datang m\u0113ngadap raja Marong Mahawangsa. Maka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun sudah k\u0113tahui bangsa-nya g\u0113rgasi lalu di-t\u0113gur-nya d\u0113ngan manis suara-nya m\u0113ngambil hati-nya. Maka s\u0113gala kaum g\u0113rgasi\nitu pun takut-lah akan raja Marong Mahawangsa itu serta hebat sikap-nya tiada berlawan pada zeman itu dan yang melihat akan dia takut dan gentar sakalian-nya. Maka titah-nya ka-pada kaum gergasi yang datang itu, \u201cAda pun beta singgah di-sini jikalau baik-baik bichara-nya mahu-lah beta dudok berhenti di-sini dahulu sa-mentara melihat khabar anak raja Rum itu kalau-kalau ada hidup-nya.\u201d Maka sembah segala kaum gergasi itu, \u201cPatek sakalian lebih lagi kesukaan karena patek sakalian ini tiada menaroh raja pada tempat ini; jikalau demikian itu baik-lah duli tuanku sila berangkat melihat tanah ini yang patut tempat hendak dudok.\u201d\n\nMaka raja Marong Mahawangsa pun berangkat hendak melihat susok tanah itu tempat hendak dibuat kota parit balai istana di-iringkan oleh kaum gergasi dengan segala menteri lalu bertemu-lah dengan tanah bumi yang baik terlalu-lah indah tempat-nya dengan tanah-nya menjadi tiada-lah turun ka-bahtera-nya gila dengan membuat kota istana dengan balai-nya yang terlalu amat besar-nya lagi dengan indah-nya. Sa-telah sudah balai itu maka dinamai akan dia Langkasuka karena menggerjakan itu dengan makan minum dan bersuka-sukaan serta dengan beberapa binatang berjenis-jenis seperti rusa kijang pelandok napoh sapi dengan segala perburuan yang dimakan oleh sakalian-nya terlalu amat kesukaan serta dengan tepok tari segala kaum itu karena mereka itu tiada beraja hanya berpenghulu sahaja dan lagi pun dengan baik bahasa-nya raja Marong Mahawangsa itu. Sa-telah sudah lengkap kota istana kemudian segala menteri hulubalang pun masing-masing dibuat-lah rumah dan kampong di-atur-nya berkeliling kota raja-nya. Sa-telah sudah sakalian-nya itu maka masing pun datang mengadap raja-nya sa-hari-hari. Maka termashbur-lah raja Marong Mahawangsa itu sudah dudok menjadi raja pada tempat itu. Maka segala dagang senteri pun berhimpun-lah datang berniaga ka-dalam negeri itu dengan baik budi bahasa baginda itu serta dengan menteri sakalian itu tiada-lah merasai kesakitan segala rayat meneri makan pergi mari ka-negeri itu. Maka banyak-lah orang yang telah pindah dengan anak istri-nya pergi dudok bersama-sama raja Marong Mahawangsa makin berambah-tambah rayat-nya dari-pada sa-bulan ka-pada sa-bulan, dari-pada sa-tahun ka-pada sa-tahun makin banyak segala orang pindah ka-negeri itu. Maka tetap-lah raja Marong Mahawangsa di-atas takhta kerajaan dengan adil murah-nya demikian-lah dipertahankan oleh baginda itu tiada-lah lagi berubah melainkan bertambah-tambah kebajikan di-dalam negeri itu.\n\nSa-bermula maka tersebut-lah perkataan anak raja Rum di atas papan ia bergantong tiada makan dan minum kurus kering tuboh badan-nya dengan di-hingga oleh kapang dan tertip pada segala badan-nya datang pasang di-sorong oleh pasang datang surut di-bawa surut dengan di-julang pula oleh ombak angin. Dengan hal yang demikian itu jatoh-lah di-chelah batu yang di-pulau Langkapuri dengan leteh lesu dan lapar dahaga-nya. Maka mengarang pun tiada kedengaran suara lagi karena sangat dzaif itu.\nMaka ada-lah ka-pada suatu hari k\u00e9tika burong g\u00ebroda itu p\u00ebrgi m\u00ebnchari makan tiada ia di-pulau itu, maka turun-lah tuan put\u00ebri anak raja China itu s\u00ebrta d\u00ebngan inang p\u00ebngasoh-nya datang ka-t\u00ebpi laut itu m\u00ebnchari k\u00ebtam siput di-susur pantai itu, tiba-tiba k\u00ebd\u00ebngaran-lah bunyi suara orang m\u00ebng\u00ebrang p\u00ebrlahan-lahan. Maka titah tuan put\u00ebri ka-pada inang-nya, \u201cAku m\u00ebnd\u00ebngar bunyi suara orang m\u00ebng\u00ebrang p\u00ebrgi-lah mak inang chari b\u00ebri b\u00ebrt\u00ebmu d\u00ebngan suara itu.\u201d Sa-t\u00eblah rata sudah di-chari-nya lalu b\u00ebrt\u00ebmu-lah d\u00ebngan manusia vang tiada b\u00ebrk\u00ebtahuan rupa-nya p\u00ebnh d\u00ebngan kapang sa-g\u00ebnap tuboh-nya mata-nya juga t\u00ebrk\u00eblip-k\u00eblip. Maka inang itu pun t\u00ebrk\u00ebjut-lah lalu b\u00ebrlari-lari ka-pada tuan put\u00ebri m\u00ebngatakan hal itu, \u201cMaka patek lihat akan dia tiada boleh patek s\u00ebmbahkan yang khusus ka-pada tuan karna patek takut h\u00ebndak p\u00ebrgi m\u00ebl\u00echat hampir-nya d\u00ebngan s\u00ebbab rupa-nya tiada b\u00ebrk\u00ebtahuan orang-kah atau jin shaitan.\u201d Maka tuan put\u00ebri pun t\u00ebrs\u00ebnyum m\u00ebnd\u00ebngar s\u00ebambah inang-nya itu. Maka titah tuan put\u00ebri, \u201cHai mak inang p\u00ebrgi juga lihat manusia-kah atau bukan jika manusia boleh kita m\u00ebngambil khabar.\u201d Maka mak inang pun p\u00ebrgi juga d\u00ebngan gagah-nya s\u00ebrta di-hampiri lalu dudok d\u00ebkat p\u00ebrtanya kata-nya, \u201cSiapa tuan ini b\u00ebrkata b\u00ebnar-lah jin-kah atau manusia-kah?\u201d Maka saluh anak raja Rum itu d\u00ebngan p\u00ebrlahan-lahan, \u201cHai ibu-ku bahwa d\u00ebngan sa-sunggoh-nya beta ini manusia juga beta-lah anak raja Rum h\u00ebndak p\u00ebrgi kahwin d\u00ebngan tuan put\u00ebri anak raja b\u00ebnuua China d\u00ebngan b\u00ebberapa banyak baht\u00ebra dan kapal kechi k\u00ebnaikan beta habis-lah di-s\u00ebrang oleh g\u00ebroda di-binasakan sakalian-nya.\u201d Maka d\u00ebngan s\u00ebbab itu-lah, hai ibu-ku jadi yang d\u00ebmikian ini.\u201d Maka t\u00e9rlalu-lah b\u00eblas kasehan hati mak inang m\u00ebnd\u00ebngarkan hal anak raja Rum itu lalu ia pun k\u00ebmbali ka-pada tuan put\u00ebri p\u00ebrs\u00ebmbahkan hal itu sakalian-nya d\u00ebngan suka t\u00ebrtawa-nya. Maka tuan put\u00ebri pun tundok sambil t\u00ebrs\u00ebnyum. Sa-t\u00eblah itu maka tuan put\u00ebri pun b\u00ebrtitah ka-pada mak inang itu, \u201cH\u00ebndak-lah s\u00ebg\u00ebra mak inang p\u00ebrgi ambil anak raja itu s\u00ebmbunyikan sa-b\u00eblum datang burong g\u00ebroda itu. Siapa tahu kalau t\u00ebrlihat pada-nya t\u00ebntu-lah mati anak raja itu? Maka jangan-lah \u00e8mak inang b\u00ebrikan dia nasi yang b\u00ebrbijji, b\u00ebri-lah ayer nasi sahaja dahulu s\u00ebrta \u00e8mak inang mandikan dia.\u201d Maka inang itu pun p\u00ebrgi b\u00ebrdua d\u00ebngan budak kundang tuan put\u00ebri itu m\u00ebngusong anak raja itu masok ka-dalam suatu goa lalu di-tutup d\u00ebngan batu yang k\u00ebchil ka-pada pintu goa itu supava jangan di-lihat oleh burong g\u00ebroda itu. Maka ayer pun di-angkat-nya lah di-mandikan dan di-kikis-nya buang s\u00ebgala kapang dan t\u00ebritip pada tuboh-nya itu s\u00ebrta di-b\u00ebri oleh mak inang kain yang di-pakai-nya. Maka pada hemat-nya waktu k\u00e9tika burong g\u00ebroda itu datang baharu-lah h\u00ebndak di-katupkan pintu goa itu lalu k\u00ebdua-nya pun k\u00ebmbali-lah m\u00ebngadap tuan put\u00ebri itu, d\u00ebmikian-lah tiap-tiap hari mak inang itu m\u00ebm\u00ebl\u00echarakan anak raja Rum d\u00ebngan tiada di-k\u00ebtahui-nya oleh g\u00ebroda itu dari-pada sa-hari ka-pada sa-hari makin b\u00ebrtambah baik rupa paras-nya dan badan-nya pun kuat-lah. Maka tatkala boleh anak raja Rum itu makan dan minum s\u00ebp\u00ebrti s\u00ebdia\nkala rupa paras-nya pun baik seperti sa-lama-nya hanya yang kurang pakaian sahaja. Maka sembah mak inang ka-pada tuan puteri, \u201cNyata-lah anak raja Rum patut sangat dengan budi pokerti-nya dan perkataan-nya bertambah pula dengan rupa paras-nya dari-pada sa-hari ka-pada sa-hari berlainan dari-pada anak raja yang kebanyakan di-benua China atau raja lain-lain pun hanya sayang sedikit dengan sebab tiada berpakaian sahaja.\u201d Maka utah tuan puteri, \u201cHai, mak ingan, sabar-lah dahulu, nanti datang burong ka-mari kita pinta ka-pada-nya segala pakaian.\u201d Sa-telah hari sudah malam maka burong geroda datang-lah menghantarkan makanan akan tuan puteri. Maka kata tuan puteri, \u201cHai, burong geroda, betapa nenek-ku bawa akan kami ketiga ini ka-sini memberi kesakitan di atas kami?\u201d Bahwa sa-sunggoh-nya nenek-ku memberi makan dengan serba aneka makanan sakalian, tetapi segala pakaian aku hendak-lah nenek ambil beri boleh-lah aku bersalim hal kami ketiga orang di-sini.\u201d Maka burong geroda pun tertawa mendengar kata tuan puteri itu serta bercakta, suara-nya seperti halilintar membela dari langit, \u201cHai chuchu-ku, tiada apa yang nenek hendak bermuat di atas chuchu-ku yang tiga bermamba ini, hanya nenek menanti janji dengan Nabi Allah Sulaiman jua, tiada beberapa lama nenek hendak kembali kan chuchu-ku kepada avah bonda chuchu-ku di-benua China.\u201d Maka kata tuan puteri, \u201cHai nenek-ku, ada-lah di-dalam istana besar avah-ku raja di-benua China itu di-dalam suatu bilek yang berdinding cermin ada suatu peti besar yang bersendi gading dan bersendi dengan permata yakud di-situ-lah sakalian ada pakaian-ku boleh nenek-ku ambil beri ka-pada aku, maka terlalu-lah kesukaan hati kami tiga orang ini.\u201d Maka kata burong geroda, \u201cBaik-lah hai chuchu-ku biar-lah nenek pergi ambil beri ka-pada chuchu-ku jangan seperti istana avah bonda chuchu-ku di-benua China itu, jika terlebih sukar dari-pada tempat itu pun kelihandak chuchu-ku itu nenek pergi ambil jua.\u201d Maka tuan puteri terlalu-lah sukachaka mendengar kata burong geroda itu. Sa-telah sudah maka burong geroda pun terbang-lah pergi hala-nya ka-benua China di-tuju-nya. Sa-telah sampai lalu ia beringgit ka-pada sa-buah gunung bermantikan lelah-nya. Saketika lagi lalu terbang-lah pula menju mahaligai raja China itu serta ia menurunkan angin ribut tofan hujan kilat guroh petir halilintar serta dengan kelam kabut adzmat berdahenan bunyi-nya tiada siapa mengenal siapa lagi. Maka tatkala itu raja benua China tengah ramai di-hadap oleh segala menteri hulubalang para penggawa sida-sida bentinara biduanda sakalian penoh sesak dengan rayat bala tentera di-balai peseban agong hendak mendengarkan surat utusan datang dari benua Rum bertanya khabar anak-nya sampai atau tidak. Ada pun orang membawa surat itu berjalan tiba-tiba datang angin ribut tofan itu yang amat besar serta dengan hujan yang teramat lebat. Maka segala yang duduk hampir itu tiada berkendal lagi dibuat oleh kelam kabut itu menjadi haruhara-lah sakalian mereka itu terkejut masing-masing hingga dengan memeliharkan diri-nya habis bergonchang-gonchang balai rong\nraja itu, t\u00e8rlalu-lah hebat dan dahshat-nya p\u00e8kak tul\u00ec t\u00e8linga sakalian yang m\u00e8nd\u00e8ngar itu. Maka di-lihat oleh burong g\u00e8roda itu sakalian orang itu di-dalam lorat b\u00e9laka ka-sana ka-mari tiada b\u00e8rk\u00e8tahuan. Maka burong g\u00e8roda pun turun-lah di-dalam k\u00e8lam kabut itu m\u00e8nuju istana b\u00e8sar itu s\u00e8rta m\u00e8nchabut suatu papan d\u00ecding istana itu m\u00e8nghulur k\u00e8pala-nya m\u00e8ngangkatkan p\u00e8ti itu d\u00e8ngan paroh-nya s\u00e8p\u00e8rti di-p\u00e8san oleh tuan put\u00e8ri itu tiada b\u00e8rsalahan lagi. Sa-t\u00e8lah dapat sudah p\u00e8ti itu maka ia pun t\u00e8rbang-lah k\u00e8mbali ka-atas udara s\u00e8p\u00e8rti angin yang maha tangkas m\u00e8nuju ka-pulau Langkapuri itu. Maka tiada b\u00e8rapa lama-nya ia t\u00e8rbang itu sampai-lah ka-hadapan tuan put\u00e8ri itu lalu m\u00e8l\u00e8takkan p\u00e8ti itu di-hadapan-nya. D\u00e8mi di-lihat tuan put\u00e8ri p\u00e8ti-nya sudah datang itu, maka t\u00e8rlalu-lah suka hati-nya s\u00e8rta m\u00e8n\u00e8rkam dan m\u00e8nchapai p\u00e8ti-nya itu d\u00e8ngan anak kunchi-nya; lalu di-ambil oleh tuan put\u00e8ri s\u00e8gala pakaian-nya yang di-g\u00e8mar-nya b\u00e8rtimbun-timbun di-hantarkan di-hadapan-nya. Maka burong g\u00e8roda pun t\u00e8rbang-lah naik ka-atas m\u00e8rchu pulau itu b\u00e8rtinggir b\u00e8rh\u00e8ntikan l\u00e8lah-nya. T\u00e8lah k\u00e8esokan hari-nya maka burong g\u00e8roda itu pun t\u00e8rbang ka-darat m\u00e8nchari makan. Maka tuan put\u00e8ri pun m\u00e8ngambil sa-p\u00e8ranggu pakaian-nya dari-pada j\u00e8nis p\u00e8ta ratna yang k\u00e8\u00e8masan l\u00e8ngkap d\u00e8ngan alat-nya pakaian s\u00e8gala raja-raja, di-suroh-nya mak inang hantarkan ka-pada anak raja itu. Maka oleh inang itu pun di-bawakan s\u00e8gala pakaian s\u00e8rta d\u00e8ngan nasi sa-kali akan anak raja Rum, lalu di-hantarkan s\u00e8gala pakaian dan nasi di-hadapan-nya lalu ia pun m\u00e8ny\u00e8mbah ka-pada anak raja Rum itu. Maka anak raja itu pun t\u00e8rlalu-lah sukachita hati-nya b\u00e8roleh pakaian itu. Sa-t\u00e8lah datang antara \u00e8nam tujoh hari-nya k\u00e8tika burong g\u00e8roda tiada ia p\u00e8rgi m\u00e8nchari makan. Maka anak raja Rum pun datang-lah m\u00e8ngadap di-bawa oleh mak inang. Sa-t\u00e8lah di-lihat oleh tuan put\u00e8ri akan anak raja itu maka ia pun tundok k\u00e8malu-maluan rupa-nya. Maka anak raja Rum pun jatoh-lah hati-nya jadi tiada takut k\u00e8dua-nya itu akan burong g\u00e8roda itu. Maka apakala hari p\u00e8tang pada k\u00e8tika burong g\u00e8roda h\u00e8ndak k\u00e8mbali maka k\u00e8dua-nya b\u00e8rp\u00e8lok b\u00e8rchium b\u00e8rtangis-tangisan. Sa-t\u00e8lah sudah maka anak raja Rum itu pun k\u00e8mbali p\u00e8rgi ka-dalam goa t\u00e8mpat dudok-nya itu di-bawakan oleh inang tuan put\u00e8ri itu s\u00e8rta d\u00e8ngan makanan anak raja itu h\u00e8ndak makan ka-pada malam itu. Sa-t\u00e8lah sudah sampai maka s\u00e8gala makanan itu pun di-hantarkan ka-hadapan-nya s\u00e8rta m\u00e8nangis b\u00e9las hati-nya m\u00e8mandang hal k\u00e8dua-nya lalu ia m\u00e8ny\u00e8mbah k\u00e8luar dari dalam goa itu sambil m\u00e8nutupkan pintu goa itu d\u00e8ngan batu lalu ia pun k\u00e8mbali ka-pada tuan put\u00e8ri di-dapati-nya s\u00e8dang m\u00e8nangis b\u00e8rk\u00e8nangkan untong nasib-nya. T\u00e8lah di-lihat oleh inang maka ia pun s\u00e8g\u00e8ra m\u00e8nyapu akan ayer mata-nya. Maka sa-k\u00e8tika ia dudok itu burong g\u00e8roda pun datang-lah m\u00e8mbawa makanan akan tuan put\u00e8ri tiga b\u00e8ranak itu, lalu ia pun t\u00e8rbang ka-atas m\u00e8rchu pulau itu d\u00e8mikian-lah k\u00e8lakuan tuan put\u00e8ri dan anak raja Rum itu tiap-tiap hari burong g\u00e8roda pun tiada-lah khali m\u00e8ngantarkan makanan, akan t\u00e8tapi tiada di-k\u00e8tahu\u00ec oleh burong itu, bahwa anak raja\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 72, 1916.\nRum itu ada hidup tiada mati dan peri ia hanyut sampai sudah ka-pulau itu, dan peri tuan puteri bertemu dengan dia. Hata antara beberapa lama-nya maka ka-pada suatu hari datang-lah burong geroa ka-pada tuan puteri selaya berkata, \"Hai chuchu-ku tinggal-lah chuchu-ku dudok baik-baik beta hendak pergi mengadap Nabi Allah Sulaiman.\" Maka kata tuan puteri, \"Baik-lah hai nenek-ku.\" Maka burong geroa pun terbang-lah naik ka-udara mengarasi awan menjuji pergi ka-tempat Nabi Allah Sulaiman, serta sampai langsung menyembah. Maka sabda Nabi Allah Sulaiman, \"Hai burong geroa apa khabar-nya yang engkau berjanji hendak pergi rebut ada-kah dayat engkau perbuat seperti chakap-mu atau tidak?\" Maka sembah burong geroa, \"Ya, nabi Allah, sudah-lah hamba-mu kerjakan seperti kehendak hamba-mu itu.\" Maka sabda nabi Allah Sulaiman, \"Bertapa peri-nya perbuatan engkau atas kedua-nya anak raja dua buah negri itu?\" Maka sembah burong geroa, \"Ada-lah hamba-mu ambil anak raja benua China tiga berhamba ketiga-nya hamba bawa pergi ka-pulau Langkapuri hamba dudok diam itu, ya nabi Allah, serta hamba-mu piliharkan chari peri segala makanan akan dia tiap-tiap hari tiada lagi khali-nya serta hamba-mu ambil pula peri segala pakaian-nya suatu peri yang besar tiada-lah hamba-mu peri ia kesakitan di atas ketiga orang itu dudok dengan kesukaan juga, ya Nabi Allah.\" Maka sabda nabi Allah Sulaiman, \"Ada-kah anak raja Rum itu belayar pergi ka-benua China atau tidak?\" Maka sembah burong geroa, \"Ya Nabi Allah Sulaiman dengan beberapa banyak kapal dan kechi bahtera di-alatkan oleh raja Rum itu serta dengan raja yang besar-besar serta pula ada sa-orang raja yang sangat besar lagi pula dengan kesaktian-nya bernama raja Marong Mahawangsa jadi harapan membawa anak raja Rum itu sa-buah bahtera kenaikan-nya dengan menteri hulubalang rayat sakalian. Maka belayar-lah anak raja itu diringkan raja Marong Mahawangsa serta segala kapal dan kechi yang banyak itu pun belayar sakalian-nya. Hata apabila sampai pertengahan jalan lalu bertemu dengan hamba-mu. Maka hamba pun nirosakkan sakalian kapal kenaikan mereka itu sa-hingga karam tenggelam ka-dalam laut itu habis-lah mati orang berhamburan pada sa-genap lautan tiada lagi hidup barang sa-orang jua pun.\" Maka nabi Allah Sulaiman pun tertawa memandang ka-pada menteri-nya sakalian. Maka segala orang besar-besar yang ada mengadap nabi Allah Sulaiman itu pun suka tertawa gelak-gelak mendengarkan sembah burong geroa itu mengatakan sudah habis mati itu tiada sa-kali-kali ia bercerita pada kuasa tuhan seru sakalian alam. Maka sabda nabi Allah Sulaiman ka-pada burong geroa, \"Kalau-kalau ada hidup, apa jua kata-mu?\" Maka sembah burong geroa, \"Jikalau ada hidup anak raja Rum itu serta bertemu dengan anak raja China yang perempuan tiga berhamba itu, bahwa sa-sunggoh-nya tiada hamba ubahkan seperti janji hamba-mu dari-pada zeman ini hendak berrundur dari-pada segala kaum sifat manusia itu. Dan di-mana-kah boleh hamba-mu mungkirkan janji hamba-mu dengan nabi Allah hendak undur dari\nbawah langit dan atas bumi yang di-diami oleh segala manusia, ya Nabi Allah berani-kah hamba membuat dusta ka-pada nabi Allah?\" Maka nabi Allah pun tersenyum mendengarkan sembah burong geroda itu. Maka sabda nabi Allah Sulaiman ka-pada raja jin yang bernama Harman Shah, \"Hendak-lah tuan hamba suroh akan menteri tuan hamba barang sa-ratus orang pergi ambil puteri anak raja China itu. Maka hendak-lah dibubuh ka-dalam peti-nya k\u00e9tiga b\u00e9rhamba itu serta dengan anak raja Rum itu. Pada k\u00e9tika ini juga mau sampai sakalian itu mari di-hadapkan hamba.\" Maka raja jin Harman Shah pun menyuruhkan menteri-nya dengan sa-ratus jin bersama-sama pergi mengambil anak raja itu. Maka menyembah-lah sakalian itu lalu terbang ka-udara raib dengan sa-saat itu juga pergi menuju ka-pulau Langkapuri, serta sampai di-lihat-nya ada sunggoh anak raja Rum itu bersama-sama puteri anak Raja China.

Demi dilihat oleh menteri keempat harimau rupa-nya itu mengamok, maka keempat-nya sakali memasang pemuras-nya menju tuhoh harimau itu.

Sa-t\u0113lah t\u0113ntu-lah p\u0113ngajaran p\u0113nghulu iblis itu, maka ia undur-lah dari-pada t\u0113mpat itu, p\u0113rgi pula ka-pada suatu k\u0113dai sa-orang saudagar yang b\u0113sar lagi pandai ia m\u0113niaga. Maka banyak-lah dagang s\u0113nt\u0113ri datang ka-k\u0113dai itu b\u0113rjual b\u0113li s\u0113gala dagangan. Maka saudagar itu pun ada-lah ia m\u0113naroh kati k\u0113chil satu dan b\u0113sar satu dan m\u0113naroh chupak k\u0113chil b\u0113sar.

Maka saudagar itu pun sa-konyong m\u0113maki d\u0113ngan kata tutur tiada b\u0113rk\u0113tahuan. Maka datang-lah marah orang dagang itu lalu m\u0113nghunus k\u0113ris m\u0113nikam dada saudagar itu luka akan mati. Maka ada-lah saudagar itu banyak anak chuchu-nya. Maka sakalian-nya pun datang b\u0113rtikam d\u0113ngan orang dagang itu; d\u0113mikian juga orang dagang banyak kawan-nya.

Maka b\u0113rbunoh-bunohan-lah m\u0113reka itu sama s\u0113ndiri-nya. Ada pun sakalian itu b\u0113rtikam d\u0113ngan k\u0113jamkan mata-nya s\u0113p\u0113rti babi luka-lah rupa-nya t\u0113rlalu-lah ramai anak chuchu shaitan itu b\u0113rsorak dan b\u0113r-t\u0113pok tangan d\u0113ngan t\u0113mpek oleh s\u0113bab sakalian-nya p\u0113nchuri itu\ntelah mengikut ajaran hingga sampai berkaparan mayat sakalian orang itu. Maka penghulu iblis pun berjalan pula dengan shaikh Abdullah masok ka-dalam sa-buah negeri. Maka kata penghulu iblis, \"Ini hamba hendak pergi ka-misjid hamba,\" lalu ia masok ka-pajak chandu. Maka banyak-lah ia berjumpa dengan orang main judi dan makan chandu, itu-lah nama-nya misjid shaitan. Sa-telah itu maka berjalan-lah pula ia kedua maka bertemu dengan beberapa pereumpuan muda-muda lalu di-hampiri dan di-suroh-nya membuat kejahatan. Apabila sampai bagai kehendak shaitan itu, maka anak chuchu-nya yang banyak-banyak itu pun suka-lah serta menepok tangan dengan tempek sorak-nya. Sa-telah itu maka ia berjalan pula sampai sa-buah kampong rumah orang besar yang sangat dzalim dan lagi menteri ka-pada raja negeri itu. Maka ramai-lah orang berhimpun mengadap bertanya hukum hak-nya di-ambil orang; dan sa-orang bertanya hukum dusun tanah kampong rumah-nya di-ambil orang; dan sa-tengah bertanya akan perahu-nya di-situ orang tiada mau pulangkan balek; dan sa-orang bertanya hamba-nya di-larikan orang di-perbukaatkan bini-nya. Sa-telah itu maka datang-lah penghulu shaitan di-hampiri dudok pada kadzi di-susur telinga-nya kadzi itu lalu di-hunjamkan rahsia pada hati kadzi itu segala harta orang itu di-suroh-nya himpukan ambil ka-semua-nya dari-pada segala jenis orang yang bertanya itu bawa ka-rumah kadzi itu. Maka oleh penghulu iblis disurohkan anak chuchu-nya, sakalian pergi ambil harta benda dan anak isteri-nya dan hamba sahaya-nya di-bawa masok ka-kampong-nya; dan jikalau pada orang yang besar harta itu terduduk sakali pun di-suroh-nya ambil juga bawa pulang ka-rumah-nya; maka dikerjakan orang-lah. Dengan sa-ketika itu juga berhimpun ka-pada rumah kadzi itu di-buat oleh haloba dan tama' akan harta orang yang tiada dengan sa-benar-nya itu. Maka pergi-lah penghulu shaitan ka-pada tuan empunya harta laki-laki dan pereumpuan dan ka-pada sakalian yang ada bichara antara kedua pehak itu yang menuntut jua harta-nya dan yang menahan tuntut itu. Maka tiada mau kadzi itu jatohkan hukum. Maka tiba-tiba dihimpun ambil segala jenis harta itu. Saketika maka datang-lah sakalian meminta di-kembalikan segala harta-nya itu. Kadzi itu pun tiada berkata-kata lagi hingga masok-lah ka-rumah-nya hendak makan nasi. Maka tiada ia tertunggu yang empunya harta itu mengatakan hendak masok makan nasi; maka sa-konyong-konyong raib-lah kadzi itu masok ka-rumah-nya. Maka pada fikiran tuan yang empunya harta itu akan kembali harta-nya. Maka datang-lah marah sakalian-nya itu, lalu menghunus senjata-nya mengamok masok ka-rumah kadzi itu. Maka kadzi itu pun mati-lah tiada sempat ia makan nasi lagi. Maka akan anak chuchu-nya dan sahaya-nya ramai-lah sakalian-nya bertikam-tikam dengan orang mengamok itu dan berbunuh-bunuh tiada-lah sempat segala orang yang harapan menteri itu hendak menolong dan memeliharkan rumah kampong terbakar itu karena banyak sangat orang mengamok. Dan menteri itu pun mati-lah di-dalam ter-\nbakar dan kampong rumah-nya habis terbakar menjadi abu angin. D\u00e9mikian itu p\u00e9roleh-nya orang yang haloba dan tama\u2019 itu. Maka penghulu shaitan itu pun b\u00e9rjalan-lah pula d\u00ebngan Shaikh Abdullah itu p\u00ebrgi ka-pada sa-buah n\u00e9gr\u00e9i; maka b\u00e9rt\u00ebmu-lah d\u00ebngan orang fakir m\u00ebminta s\u00e9d\u00e9kah lima orang orang di-dalam hutan rimba s\u00e9sat yang tiada sampai ka-pada t\u00e9mpat s\u00e9gala manusia itu. Maka masing-masing b\u00ebrdukong s\u00e9gala p\u00ebrb\u00e9kalan makanan. Maka b\u00e9rt\u00ebmu-lah fakir itu d\u00ebngan sa-pohon kayu b\u00ebrbuah dan b\u00ebrbunga \u00e9mas merah dan perak dari-pada p\u00ebrdu-nya hingga sampai ka-puchok-nya kayu itu yang b\u00ebrsangkutan g\u00eblang subang dan k\u00ebron-chong g\u00ebndit dan dari-pada p\u00ebnding agok sa-g\u00ebnap ranting dahan-nya itu. Maka b\u00ebrh\u00ebnti-lah lima orang fakir itu di-bawah pohon itu. Maka penghulu shaitan pun hampir-lah ka-pada-nya. Maka kata fakir itu, \u201cApa juga kita chari dari-pada sa-buah n\u00e9gr\u00e9i ka-pada sa-buah n\u00e9gr\u00e9i, bukan-kah kita m\u00ebnchari \u00e9mas perak? maka s\u00ebkarang b\u00e9rt\u00ebmu-lah d\u00ebngan kita \u00e9mas perak yang tiada t\u00e8rbawa oleh kita. Apa juga rupa bichara kita ini?\u201d. Maka di-hunjam-kan oleh penghulu shaitan itu d\u00ebngan rahsia raib pada hati fakir itu, di-suroh tinggal s\u00e9gala p\u00ebrb\u00e9kalan makanan itu. Maka jadi muafakat m\u00ebreka itu d\u00ebngan tiada fikir himat-nya m\u00ebmbuangkan s\u00e9gala makanan yang di-dalam b\u00e9kas-nya d\u00ebngan k\u00ebsukaan hati k\u00eblima-nya itu. Maka di-ambil-nya s\u00e9gala harta yang b\u00ebrk\u00ebnan pada hati-nya masing-masing lalu di-buboh-nya ka-dalam b\u00e9kas-nya dukong ka-atas b\u00e9lakang-nya. Di-dalam itu pun sa-t\u00ebngah orang itu b\u00ebrpaling juga ka-atas pohon itu di-lihat-nya banyak jua lagi yang b\u00ebrk\u00ebnan pada hati-nya, lalu k\u00ebmbali pula di-ambil-nya di-sangkutkan pada sa-g\u00ebnap leher-nya. Maka di-p\u00ebsan oleh penghulu iblis ka-pada anak chuchu-nya di-suroh turut binasakan serta s\u00ebsatkan sakalian jalan-nya. Maka di-turut-lah oleh kaum shaitan itu akan fakir lima orang itu. Sa-t\u00eblah itu maka penghulu iblis itu b\u00e9rjalan-lah h\u00ebndak masok ka-dalam n\u00e9gr\u00e9i orang. Maka b\u00e9rt\u00ebmu-lah d\u00ebngan sa-orang yang b\u00ebrtapa elmu seher al-shahid h\u00ebndak jadi pahlawan dan hulubalang. Maka ia b\u00ebrtapa sangat k\u00ebras p\u00ebrtapaan-nya. Maka penghulu shaitan pun m\u00ebnampakkan dirinya s\u00ebp\u00ebrti sa-orang shaikh b\u00e9rjanggut panjang sampai ka-dada-nya b\u00ebrs\u00ebrban hijau b\u00ebrjubah hijau m\u00ebmbawa sa-bijji yang b\u00ebrnama buah d\u00eblima di-tangan-nya s\u00ebrta di-hampiri d\u00ebkat lalu m\u00ebmb\u00ebri salam. Maka orang itu pun s\u00ebg\u00ebra-lah m\u00ebmbukakan mata-nya m\u00ebnyahuti salam itu s\u00ebrta kata-nya, \u201cSiapa tuan hamba ini?\u201d Maka kata penghulu shaitan, \u201cHamba-lah yang h\u00ebndak m\u00ebnayampaikan s\u00e9gala k\u00ebh\u00ebndak hati tuan hamba makan-lah buah d\u00eblima ini.\u201d Maka s\u00ebg\u00ebra-lah di-ambil oleh orang b\u00ebrtapa itu di-lihat-nya b\u00ebrchahaya-chahaya buah d\u00eblima itu. Maka di-koyak di-ambil biji-nya lalu di-masokkan ka-dalam mulut-nya. S\u00ebrta t\u00ebrmasok sampai ka-r\u00ebngkongan maka m\u00ebnjadi k\u00eblam mata-nya, tiada-lah s\u00ebdar akan diri-nya m\u00ebnjadi gila-lah orang b\u00ebrtapa. Maka penghulu shaitan itu pun raib-lah di-mata-nya dan buah d\u00eblima yang di-tangan-nya itu pun hilang-lah. Maka orang b\u00ebrtapa itu pun b\u00e9rt\u00ebmpek dan m\u00eblompat b\u00ebrlari-lari ka-sana ka-mari di-dalam\nhutan itu jadi gila huru-biru. Maka penghulu shaitan itu pun masok-lah ka-dalam negeri orang bertemu dengan suatu bandarsah tempat segala budak-budak mengaji. Maka penghulu shaitan pun mendekati segala kanak-kanak itu di-hunjamkan di-dalam hatinya dengan kejahatan sa-mata-mata. Maka budak itu pun habislah di-tinggalkan segala pengajian pergi bermain dan yang saat tengah pulang ka-pada ibu bapa-nya menjadi marah-lah guru-nya di-panggil anak murid-nya di-pukul.

WILLIAM WESLEY & SON\n28, BAKER STREET, STRAND,\nLONDON, W.C.\n\nPRINTED AT THE METHODIST PUBLISHING HOUSE, SINGAPORE.\nNOTES ON MALAY HISTORY.\n\nBY C. O. BLAGDEN.\n\nI. AN EARLY REFERENCE TO MENANGKABAU.\n\nIn Chau Ju-kua's \"Chu-fan-chi,\" translated by Hirt and Rockhill, under the heading \"Palembang, San-fo-ts'i,\"* p. 61, the following passage occurs:\n\n\"There is an old tradition that the ground in this country once suddenly gaped open and out of the cavern came many myriads of cattle, which rushed off in herds into the mountains, though the people all tried to get them for food. Afterwards the crevice got stopped up with bamboo and trees and disappeared.\"\n\nThe editors have rightly surmised that this contains a reference to the legendary etymology of the place-name \"Menangkabau,\"\u00a7 in Central Sumatra. It evidently represents one of the many variant ways in which \"popular etymology,\" as it is called, has attempted to explain this obscure name. The second half is always identified (rightly or wrongly) with the Malay word for \"buffalo,\" but in other respects the explanations are very various. In connection with this Chinese authority, the chief point of interest is that he speaks of the legend as \"an old tradition:\" evidently it had been current for some time before his own date (which was about the middle of the 13th century of our era); and this goes to show that the Menangkabau country was known by that name from a considerably earlier period, that the real meaning of the name had been forgotten and there had been time for legends to grow up around it.\n\nII. AN EARLY MENTION OF THE OLD SINGAPORE.\n\nIn Wang Ta-y\u00fcan's \"Tao i chih lio\" (dated 1349 A.D. and recently partially translated by Rockhill in T'oung Pao, March 1915), under the heading \"Hsien,\"\u2020 p. 100, the following passage occurs:\n\n\"The people are much given to piracy; whenever there is an uprising in any other country, they at once embark in as many\n\n*\u4e09\uff0e\u4f5b \u9f4a\n\u00a7 First actually mentioned, I think, in the Nagaratretagama (A.D. 1365): see this Journal, No. 53, p. 147.\n\u2020 \u9055\n\nJour.

(Thus) in recent years they came with seventy odd junks and raided Tan-ma-hsi\u2020 and attacked the city moat. (The town) resisted for a month, the place having closed its gates and defending itself, and they not daring to assault it. It happened just then that an Imperial envoy was passing by (Tan-ma-hsi), so the men of Hsien drew off and hid, after plundering Hsi-li.\u201d\u2021\n\nAccording to the editor, \u201cHsien\u201d was Siam, and I think there is no reason to doubt that it especially referred to some part of that country adjacent to the Gulf named after it. Tan-ma-hsi was the old Singapura (see this Journal, No. 53, pp. 155-6). Assuming these identifications to be correct, as I believe we are entitled to do, the above quotation suffices to establish the fact that a naval expedition from Siam attacked Singapore in the first half of the 14th century. That is an interesting scrap of information about a period of Malay history which is otherwise almost a blank, so far as real history is concerned, though of course legends and traditions are not altogether lacking. Slight as the information is, it fits in well with what we already knew about the relations of the Siamese with the Malays of the Peninsula in this period, and it confirms the view (now pretty well established) that the old Singapore was a flourishing port during the first three quarters of the 14th century.\n\n\u2020 \u5355 \u9a6c \u9521\n\u2021 \u6614 \u91cc\nThe plates illustrating Dr. Argyll Campbell's paper will be distributed with the next issue of the Journal.\nAn Experimental Investigation concerning the Effects of \"Tuba\" (Derris elliptica) Fish-Poison.\n\nBy J. Argyll Campbell.\n\n\"Tuba\" is a term used by the Malays to denote various plants which possess fish-poisoning properties. *Derris elliptica* Benth., Leguminosae, is the most powerful of these plants.\n\nInteresting accounts of \"tuba\" fishing are given by George Maxwell (1) and W. H. Furness (2). According to these authors the root of the low climbing plant, *Derris elliptica*, is most commonly employed. The root is pounded by a club and then extracted by soaking it in water contained in boats. The soaked root is compressed and a milky-white watery fluid escapes. This fluid is mixed with lime to make it sink and spread when poured into the river. Previously a barricade has been erected some distance down the river to prevent the fish escaping. The poison stupefies the fish and they flee before it. Men in boats and on the barricade scoop up the fish in nets or spear them as they come to the surface. Furness says that the fish seem to be affected by suffocation.\n\nResearch has been done concerning the chemical composition of this poison. M. Greshoff (3) obtained a resin which he called \"derrid\" and which he found to resemble pachyrhizid, timboine, nicuoline and piscidine in composition. Wray (4) also isolated a resinous substance which he named \"tubaine.\"\n\nI can find no research concerning the actions of the poison upon the living tissues, although much has been written about its apparent actions. Greshoff (5) says that drinking the poison produces vomiting, dizziness and death. He records a case of suicide in Java. Ridley (6) mentions that \"tuba\" poison is speedily fatal to man when swallowed or to fish when in contact with the gills; and that it is used by Malays as an abortifacient (7). Gimlette (8) gives a good deal of information. Fish stupefied by the poison can be eaten with impunity by man. Chinese use the poison extensively as an insecticide, especially for spraying pepper vines. It is put into wells with criminal intent, but death seems to be rare. A decoction is used by Malay girls to produce abortion; death sometimes occurs owing to uterine haemorrhage. Acute cases of poisoning are characterised by fixation of the jaws. In Borneo the Dyak girls use it to commit suicide. It is also mixed with \"ipoh\" poison by the Sakei in preparation of dart poison for blow pipes.\nPreparation of the Poison.\n\nIn my research the extract was prepared in the same way as Malay fishermen prepare it. When necessary the root was not extracted with water, but with Ringer's physiological saline solution (NaCl .9%; KCl .01%; Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082 to saturation). It was then filtered and boiled. These processes do not interfere with its toxic properties and the fluid is still milky-white. The poison passes very slowly through parchment; only one seventieth part of the poison passes through in five days, so that it seems to be in colloidal solution. The extract keeps at least for a week. In most cases the extract was prepared fresh when required. The specimen of the root used by me, was kept for three months in a cupboard and retained its full powers all that time.\n\nThe extract is not antiseptic. Organic matter soaked in it soon putrefies at ordinary room temperature (28\u00b0C).\n\nThe extract is faintly acid in reaction. It has an acrid taste and smell. The taste persists for a long time; strong solutions cause slight numbness of the gums and mouth about ten minutes after tasting.\n\nI have not attempted to separate the active substance, but I have investigated the actions of the extract as used by the natives.\n\nIn estimating the strengths of the solutions used, I have taken 1 gm. by weight of the root in 100 cubic centimeters of water as 1 in 100 solution.\n\nBefore performing any experiments, the milky extract to be used was first tested to prove that it was capable of killing fish. It never failed to do this. A given weight of the root contains a constant quantity of the poison and kills fish in a definite time.\n\nEffects on Different Animals.\n\nEffects on Fish. Fish, Ophiocephalus gachua, Buch.-Ham., of about fifty grammes weight were used. Solutions as weak as 1 in 100,000 are fatal to these fish. Wray (9) found that 1 in 350,000 of the isolated resin \"tubaine\" kills fish in half an hour. Greshoff (9) obtained the same results with a much weaker solution of the resin \"derrid.\"\n\nThe symptoms of poisoning as observed by myself are constant. In a solution 1 in 4500 the fish becomes agitated almost at once and swims about wildly at the surface of the water taking in mouthfuls of air which escapes into the water by the gill slits. In two minutes time the fish is lying on its side at the bottom of the vessel, breathing slowly and deeply. In another five minutes the breathing stops, the fins twitch, but reflex movements can be elicited for another three minutes. The fish dies eleven minutes after immersion. A solution 1 in 12,000 kills in twenty eight minutes, a solution 1 in 50,000 in eighty three minutes. The fish\ndoes not seem to lose consciousness until the breathing is greatly affected. Post mortem examination shows venous congestion of the organs; the heart is full of blood, but still capable of contracting in response to stimuli. If the heart be examined soon after the breathing has stopped, it is observed to be beating feebly, and if relieved from the distension with blood, will beat for a long time.\n\nFrom these observations it seems very probable that death is due to asphyxia.\n\nAnother series of experiments was done in which a small quantity (1 cubic centimeter) of the extract was injected into the stomach of the fish by means of a long narrow metal tube passed down the esophagus.\n\nThe minimal lethal dose, in this manner of injection, is the extract obtained from 1/200 gm. of the root. The extract actually injected is 1 c. c. 1 in 200 solution. The symptoms of poisoning are exactly the same as those described above. The poison is rapidly absorbed by the stomach, the fish becoming affected two minutes after the injection. Wray (9) points out that \"tubaine\" is insoluble and that he has seen a fish eat a quantity without ill effects. I have not used the isolated substance \"tubaine,\" but the milky extract is certainly rapidly fatal when administered in this way. The extract from 1/25 gm. of the root kills fish in twelve minutes, from 1/200 gm. in one hour.\n\nI have not experimented with fish larger than 50 gm. Undoubtedly larger fish would require larger doses to kill them.\n\nEffects on Tadpoles. Tadpoles of the common Singapore toad, *Bufo melanostictus*, were immersed in solutions of various concentrations. The symptoms of poisoning closely resemble those described for fish, but stronger solutions are required. Solutions weaker than 1 in 12,000 do not kill tadpoles. A solution 1 in 12,000 kills in forty three minutes and a solution of 1 in 4,500 in twenty minutes. These solutions kill fish in half these times respectively.\n\nEffects on Mosquito Larvae. Stegomyia larvae were employed. Solutions weaker than 1 in 10,000 are not fatal, nor do they prevent the larvae developing. A solution 1 in 10,000 takes at least two days to kill larvae; 1 in 5,000 kills them in about two days; 1 in 1,000 in one day, 1 in 500 in three hours, 1 in 10 in one hour. Therefore much stronger solutions and much longer periods of action are required to kill mosquitoes larvae than to kill fish or tadpoles.\n\nEffects on Toads. The common toad, *Bufo melanostictus*, was employed. The poison was administered either by subcutaneous injection or by injection into the stomach of one cubic centimeter of the fluid extract. The minimal lethal dose by the\nfirst method of injection is 1 c. c. 1 in 50, that is the extract obtained from 1/50 gm. of the root, by the second method of injection 1 c. c. 1 in 12, that is the extract obtained from 1/12 gm. of the root. In both cases the symptoms are similar. In a few minutes the animal becomes agitated for a short time, then quietens down and in another ten minutes its breathing becomes deeper and irregular in rate, the nostrils dilating at each inspiration. The animal is still conscious and all its reflexes are normal. In another twenty minutes the breathing stops, reflexes diminish and finally disappear about thirty five minutes after the injection. Post mortem examination reveals signs of death from asphyxia, the organs being congested, and the heart full. The heart can be stimulated to contract for a long time after removal from the animal.\n\n**Effects on Monkeys.** Two varieties of monkeys were used, the common kra (*Macacus cynomolgus*) and the larger pig-tailed monkey (*Macacus nemesthinus*).\n\nThe poison was injected subcutaneously; the injection causes no pain. The minimal lethal dose is the extract from 2 gm. of the root. The extract is concentrated to small bulk by boiling; boiling does not effect the poison. Within five minutes the animal becomes weak, and the gums and tongue are very pale. There is usually slight vomiting about this time. The vomiting resembles cerebral vomiting and soon ceases as the animal goes to sleep. It can be aroused and its reflexes are normal. Then the breathing shows great increase in depth, and soon becomes very deep and slow; then gasping inspirations occur about six a minute; the reflexes now disappear and the animal cannot be aroused; gasping gradually ceases and the animal dies. The heart beats for several minutes after the respiration ceases. These symptoms are those of asphyxia and post mortem examination shows the signs of death from asphyxia. Death occurs in about forty minutes.\n\nExperiments in which the poison is introduced into the stomach by a stomach tube give the same results. Vomiting comes on in about five minutes and is not excessive. In any case sufficient poison is absorbed because death takes place even after vomiting. The extract from 2 gm. weight of the root is the minimal lethal dose. Death occurs in forty minutes, the symptoms resembling those produced by subcutaneous injection of the poison. When the respiration is greatly affected, the reflexes disappear, the corneal reflex being the last to go. The pupils are dilated.\n\n**Action on the Tissues and Organs Removed from the Body.**\n\n**Effects on Voluntary Muscle.** When in concentrations 1 in 8 to 1 in 2,000, its action on the voluntary muscles of the tongue and of the calf of a toad is to weaken their power of contraction. The motor nerves and end plates are not affected. This\nweakening of the muscle is removed by washing out the poison. Weaker solutions have no action on voluntary muscle.\n\nIn the experiments on the tongue the poison was injected under the mucous membrane. Induction shocks were used to stimulate the muscle.\n\n**Effects on Involuntary Muscle.** \"Tuba\" poison in solutions 1 in 60 to 1 in 6,000, diminishes the tone and movements of the involuntary muscle of the intestine of a monkey. This weakening is counteracted by the presence of a dilute solution of sodium carbonate.\n\n**Effects on Heart Muscle.** \"Tuba\" poison, even in strong solutions, has no action on heart muscle. The isolated heart beats strongly and for a long time in Ringer's solution containing the poison in concentrations 1 in 8 or 1 in 100. The same results are obtained when the heart is perfused with the poison 1 in 80.\n\nThese results with heart muscle, verify the fact that for some time after the respiration has ceased in the living animal under the influence of the poison, the heart may be felt still beating strongly.\n\n**Effects on the Blood.** Strong solutions (1 in 100) of the poison in Ringer's solution alter neither the red nor white cells of the blood of the monkey. The white cells show the usual amoeboid movements if the solution be kept warm. There is no haemolysis or breaking up of the red cells.\n\nThe oxygen capacity of the blood is not altered by the poison, the red cells taking up oxygen easily and giving it off easily.\n\n**Effects on the Blood Vessels.** Solutions of the poison varying in strength from 1 in 30 to 1 in 4000 were perfused through the blood vessels of a toad. In most cases the poison dilates the blood vessels, in a few cases no effect is produced.\n\nIn another series of experiments the extract (from 1 in 50 up to 1 in 1250) was perfused through the blood vessels of a limb of a monkey. In these vessels dilatation is produced and the poison so affects the blood vessels that the power of adrenalin to constrict them is markedly lessened and in most cases abolished.\n\n**Experiments on Anaesthetised Monkeys.**\n\n*Macacus cynomolgus* and *Macacus nemestpinus* were the monkeys employed, chloroform being used as the anaesthetic. The poison was injected into a vein, usually the femoral vein, by means of an injection cannula; records of the blood pressure, usually that of the femoral artery, and of the respiration were taken.\n\nInjected in this way the extract from 1/50 gm. of the root is sufficient to produce death. In all cases marked effects are produced on the respiration and blood pressure (Fig. 1). Respiration is usually stimulated at first, then depressed and finally paralysed. The blood pressure falls considerably but only temporarily.\nLater further changes are produced in the blood pressure, but these are produced by the asphyxia.\n\nA dose as weak as 1 c. c. of 1 in 10,000 solution produces similar changes in the respiration and blood pressure but the changes are not so well marked; the respiration is not paralysed and death does not occur, the normal conditions prevailing again.\n\nThe tissues apparently become accustomed to the poison in a slight degree. Thus a dose from 1/50 gm. of the root kills if injected without any previous injection being made; but if many injections of weaker solutions of gradually increasing strengths are first performed, a stronger dose than 1/50 gm. is required to produce death.\n\nThe poison acts upon the respiratory nervous centre in the medulla and not on the vagal ending in the lungs, because the same results are obtained if the vagi are cut (Fig. 2). Also if the poison is injected into the carotid artery, the respiration is affected in a few seconds.\n\nIt has already been stated that the poison dilates the blood vessels of the isolated limb of a monkey and that it greatly weakens the tone and movements of the involuntary muscle of the intestine of the same animal. The fall of blood pressure is explained by these actions. Further experiments and chemical analysis are required to prove whether one substance causes both paralysis of respiration and dilatation of the blood vessels or whether there are two distinct substances for these actions.\n\nThe previous injection of adrenalin only slightly modifies the depressing influence of the poison upon the blood vessels, and the fall of blood pressure is still very well marked.\n\nAfter-effects of the Poison.\n\nIn some experiments injections were made subcutaneously into monkeys, but although these injections were strong enough to produce very great effects on the respiration, causing a marked degree of asphyxia, they were not strong enough to kill the animals. In these cases the animals recover completely in a few hours and exhibit no ill after-effects,\u2014no paralysis, no digestive troubles and no weakness of any kind.\n\nDiscussion.\n\nFrom the results on different animals it is evident that the poison affects the more highly developed members of the animal kingdom more readily that it does the primitive members. This is only to be expected since its action concerns the brain and one particular part of this, namely the medulla oblongata.\n\nIt could be used to destroy mosquite larv\u00e6, but it should be used in solutions not weaker than 1 in 1,000, that is just enough\nof the extract should be added to the pool to make the water cloudy. Of course this would kill fish up to 50 gm. far more quickly than it would the larva and in time it would certainly affect much larger fish.\n\nIts effects on the higher animals can be explained from the results obtained in the experiments performed on anaesthetised animals. The great weakness exhibited in cases of poisoning is due to the fall of blood pressure and to the weakening of the voluntary and involuntary muscle. The effects on the respiration are due at first to the stimulation and afterwards to the paralysis of the respiratory centre. The vomiting which usually occurs seems to be due to the stimulation of the vomiting centre in the medulla. After injection of the poison into the stomach whatever the dose a definite interval elapses before vomiting takes place. It occurs at the same time as the other changes and it is never excessive. Even after vomiting death takes place thus showing that sufficient poison is absorbed before vomiting occurs.\n\nFrom the facts that the animal remains conscious and that the reflexes are present until the respiratory centre is greatly affected, it follows that the poison has no previous effect on other parts of the brain and spinal cord. The animals do become sleepy but that can be explained by the muscular weakness and the fall of the blood pressure. The unconsciousness and absence of reflexes come on during the asphyxia.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that cases of abortion with fatal haemorrhage have occurred by the use of this poison. The poison does not act directly on the uterus since it weakens involuntary muscle. The abortion must be due to the asphyxia produced by the poison. The uterine haemorrhage is due to the dilatation of the blood vessels.\n\nThe poison is very virulent since the extract from only 2 gm. (30 grains) of the root is sufficient to kill a large monkey. Cases of murder have not been reported probably because the would-be victim detects the presence of something to be avoided owing to the acrid taste and smell of a strong solution. Cases of suicide have been reported. A few months ago a case of suspected \"tuba\" poisoning was recorded in Singapore. I am indebted to Dr. R. D. Keith acting Government Pathologist for the details. A quantity of \"tuba\" root was found in the room with the body. Post Mortem examination revealed nothing but venous congestion of the organs. The lungs possessed an acrid odour. Analysis of the stomach contents was negative. \"Tuba\" poison was not tested for, because chemical tests for this poison are unknown, although Greshoff (3) describes crystals of definite shape and colour, which are obtained from the poison.\n\nThe Post Mortem examinations in my experiments only show venous congestion of the organs.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nIt should be easy enough to detect the presence of \"tuba\" poison in the stomach contents by simply testing the effects, after boiling and filtering, of some of the fluid upon small fish, seeing that they are killed by very weak solutions of the poison.\n\nThe treatment indicated is that for poisons which produce muscular weakness and paralyse the respiratory centre. The natives of Sarawak administer sugar and cold baths. (8).\n\nConclusions.\n\n(1) \"Tuba\" fish-poison (*Derris elliptica*) causes death by paralysing the respiratory centre in the medulla. The sap from 2 gm. weight of the root when administered by mouth, is sufficient to kill a monkey (*Macacus nemestpinus*).\n\n(2) It usually stimulates the respiratory centre before depressing it.\n\n(3) It causes great weakness, because it weakens both voluntary and involuntary muscle and because it produces a great fall of blood pressure.\n\n(4) It has no action upon the heart muscle or heart nervous mechanism.\n\n(5) It produces a marked fall of blood pressure because it greatly weakens the muscle of the vessel walls, thus causing dilatation.\n\n(6) It causes vomiting probably by stimulating the vomiting centre in the medulla; but, after swallowing large doses, sufficient poison to cause death is absorbed even if vomiting occurs.\n\n(7) Fish poisoned by \"tuba\" can be eaten with impunity by man, because fish are killed by very small quantities of the poison.\n\n(8) It is not antiseptic and its poisonous action is less marked on the lower members of the animal kingdom than on the more highly organised members. It kills mosquite larva and tadpoles but it is less toxic to these than to fish.\n\nI am indebted to Dr. Hanitsch of The Raffles Museum and to Mr. I. H. Burkill of The Botanical Gardens, for assistance with the literature.\n\nReferences.\n\n1. George Maxwell. \"In Malay Forests,\" page 246, 1907.\n2. W. H.

Those from the Gardens' jungle were fully developed and borne on the trunk. Wallich describes it as a climber from the Penang hills; but it has not been collected again, and as no species of the genus is a climber, it is possible that the label is wrongly affixed. The species is chiefly remarkable for its narrow leaves and hairy inflorescence.\n\n*Xanthophyllum puberulum*, n.sp. (*Polygalaceae*).

Kingii*, Chodat.\n\n*X. eurhynchum*, King, is also not Miquel\u2019s plant, and is renamed *X. verrucosum*, Chodat (l.c. 263).\n\n*X. glaucum*, Wall. Chodat separates King\u2019s plant from Wallich\u2019s, as *X. microcarpum*, saying that it has \u201cFructus parvus nec verrucosus nec costatus\u201d which is an excellent description of Wallich\u2019s type of *X. glaucum*. King\u2019s plant from Trang is absolutely identical with Wallich\u2019s *X. glaucum*.\n\nHe describes two new species.\n\n**X. nebecarpum**, Chodat (l.c. 263) based on imperfect fruiting specimens collected in Pangkor (*Curtis* 1639) with large velvety fruit.\n\n**X. discolor**, Chodat (l.c. 257). A small tree with leaves glaucous beneath, and rather large white flowers, collected by me at Seletar and in the Gardens\u2019 jungle, Singapore.\n\n**Garcinia clusiaefolia**, n. sp. (*Guttiferae*). A tree, with black branches not angled. Leaves stiffly coriaceous, obovate, apex obtuse, base cuneate, nerves very fine inconspicuous above, invisible beneath, 5-5.5 inches long, 2-2.5 to 3 inches wide, drying greenish; petiole 5 inches long, stout, not wrinkled. Male flowers in fascicles upon axillary tubercles 10 or more in a fascicle, very small, 1 inch long: bracts ovate, numerous: pedicels thick, 2.5 inches long. Sepals 4, 2 outer coriaceous orbicular concave, 2 inner thinner obovate oblong. Petals oblong, obtuse, as long as the sepals. Stamens connate into a subconic mass, not lobed; anthers sessile, minute, 2-celled, cells separated by the broad subtriangular connective. Pistillode 0.

(*Ternstroemiaceae*). Branches stout, grey. Leaves thick, coriaceous, obovate to oblanceolate, blunt, long-narrowed to the petiole, 2\u00b75 to 3 inches long, 1\u00b71-1\u00b725 inches wide, nerves above invisible, beneath often invisible but sometimes distinct, 3-4 pairs, arched, and anastomosing some way from the margin.

Petals coriaceous, rotund, edges denticulate. Stamens glabrous: anthers linear, oblong, longer than the filament.\n\nPerak: Gunong Kerbau at 4500 feet (Robinson).\n\nThis differs from *T. Maclellandii*, Ridl. for which I at first took it in the nervation, which in that species so far as it is ever visible is horizontal slightly ascending, in this it is curved in the centre and anastomoses some way from the edge, the flowers are bigger, the pedicels much shorter and thicker, the petals coriaceous and minutely denticulate.\n\n*Gordonia singaporeana*, Wall. Cat. 1457, (*G. grandis*, King in Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, lix. (1890) p. 203) (*Ternstroemiaceae*). There seems to have been some confusion as to the Gordonias of the low country of the Malay Peninsula. The type of *G. singaporeana* referred by King to his *Gordonia excelsa*, is undoubtedly the common *G. grandis* King, a native of Singapore. This species is closely allied to the true *G. excelsa*, Bl. of Java, resembling it in the leaves in which the lamina is decurrent on the petiole, differing in the rather smaller flowers, and silky pubescence of the bud and young shoot. *G. grandis* having these parts quite glabrous.\n\n*G. excelsa*, King, is a totally different plant, and has rather an affinity with *G. Maingayi* as King suggests than with the *G. excelsa*, Bl. I describe it under the name of *G. penangensis*.\nGordonia penangensis, n.sp. (G. excelsa, King l.c. 203 not of Blume) (Ternstroemiaceae). A tree 30 to 40 feet tall, 10-15 inches through the stem, branchlets silky pubescent. Leaves thinly coriaceous, glabrous, lanceolate elliptic acuminate, edges serrulate or entire, base acuminate, 2.5 to 4 inches long, 1-1.75 inches wide, nerves very faint sometimes almost invisible 5 to 7 pairs inarching doubly within the edge; petiole 2.5, creamy white or yellow; pedicel very short silky. Sepals rounded, silky outside. Petals round, narrowed at the base, backs silky. Stamens very numerous; anthers oblong. Ovary conic, silky; style 1, stout, pubescent, 5-lobed. Capsule 5- or 6-angled, 1.25 to 1.5 inches long, conic, hairy or glabrescent, valves acute.\n\nPenang: common on Penang Hill (Curtis), and I have also found it in Singapore at Seletar (6214 and 3913 of my collection).\n\nGordonia hirtella, n.sp. (Ternstroemiaceae). A tree with silky buds and shoots. Leaves coriaceous, elliptic lanceolate, acuminate, base narrowed subacute, nerves very fine much reticulate, the secondary nerves and reticulations as distinct as the primary nerves, above almost as invisible as on the lower surface, margins crenulate or entire, above glabrous, beneath appressed hairy, 3.5 to 6 inches long, 1.5 to 2 inches wide; petiole 2.5 inches long. Flowers rather small, cream coloured; peduncles silky 1 inch or less long. Sepals orbicular, silky tomentose, 2 inches long. Petals obovate, silky on the back. Stamens apparently few. Capsule 7.5 inches long, appressed pubescent outside, valves subacute.\n\nSelangor: in mountain forests, Bukit Kutu at 3000 feet (Ridley 7350). Perak: Gunong Batu Puteh (Wray 1116).\n\nThis species is nearest to G. dipterosperma, Kurz, of Bhotan. The leaves are more coriaceous, and it is more hairy, and the hairs do not spring from large pustules on the leaf as in that species. From G. penangensis it differs in the hairy backs of the leaves and smaller flowers and fruits. The nervation is much the same as in penangensis but the reticulation is more elaborate.\n\nHopea albescens, n.sp. (Dipterocarpaceae). Leaves coriaceous, ovate to elliptic, acuminate, apex blunt, base rounded, glabrous, nerves 8 pairs very slender almost invisible above, 2.75 to 3 inches long, 1.25 inches wide; petiole 1 inches long. Panicles axillary and terminal, 3-4 inches long. Flowers subsecund, white tomentose, shortly pedicelled. Sepals lanceolate ovate, obtuse. Petals 2 inches long, a little longer than the sepals, oblong, broad, blunt, pubescent outside. Stamens 15, filaments elongate triangular; anther elliptic, seta very fine, as long as the anther. Ovary pubescent; style short.\n\nPahang: at Raub (Burn-Murdoch) \"Merawan.\"\nThis species is allied to *H. odorata*, Roxb. of Tenasserim, but has smaller leaves more coriaceous, fewer nerved, and more abruptly acuminate, flowers distinctly pedicelled (not sessile as in *H. odorata*), petals smaller and the filaments different in shape.\n\n**Hopea Lowii**, Brandis. This moderate sized tree has not previously been recorded from the Malay Peninsula. I have met with it at Chua Chu Kang, (No. 6685 of my collections) but I believe the only tree I ever saw there is gone now: and I have had it also from Muar, and Penang Waterfall (*Curtis* 3635). It is also a native of Borneo and Sumatra.\n\n**Durio singaporensis**, n. sp. (*Malvaceae*). A large tree. *Leaves* oblong, obtuse or subacute, base blunt rounded, coriaceous, glabrous above, with channelled midrib, beneath scaly raw sienna colour, nerves very numerous, and inconspicuous above, and hardly distinct beneath, 7-9 inches long, 2\u00b75-3 inches wide: petiole thick \u00b725 inches long, angled. *Flowers* in clusters of 2 or 3 on the trunk: peduncles short: pedicels \u00b75 inches long, 4-angled, with 2 lanceolate bracts at their bases: floral bracts ovate, acute, 1 inch long and as wide. *Sepals* oblong, 2 inches long, acute, scaly, cinnamon colour. *Petals* linear, oblong, 1\u00b75 inches long, outside scaly with fringed scales, cinnamon colour, within pubescent white. *Stamens* and pistil like those of *D. malaccensis*, Griff.\n\n**Singapore**: Bukit Timah (*Ridley* 3204); Ang Mo Kio (*Ridley* 6676); Seletar. **Johore**: in Johore Bahru (*Ridley* 6677), and Mount Austin (*Ridley* 11996).\n\n**Scaphium longiflorum**, n. sp. (*Sterculiaceae*). Tree. *Leaves* coriaceous, elliptic rounded, shortly acuminate, blunt, sometimes glaucescent beneath, nerves 7 pairs strongly raised, and the reticulations conspicuous beneath, above smooth, 4\u00b75 to 6 inches long, 2\u00b78 to 3 inches across: petiole 2\u00b72 inches long. *Panicles* axillary, 6 inches long, sparingly red-tomentose, compact, much branched. *Flowers* numerous glabrous: bracts caducous: pedicels glabrous, \u00b71 inch long. *Calyx* \u00b73 inches long; tube cylindric, \u00b72 in. long: lobes 4, much shorter, ovate, acute, all glabrous except the inner edges which are woolly. *Stamens* 8, in a globose woolly head, staminal column longer than the calyx tube, woolly.\n\n**Perak**: (*Scortechini* 2077 and 2026).\n\nI have seen no female flowers or fruit of this species which was confused with *S. affine*, but from which it is very distinct in its long tubed glabrous flowers and woolly long androecium. The panicles are also much more glabrous.\n\nI consider it advisable to keep the genus *Scaphium* distinct from *Sterculia* from which it differs not only in its membranous one-seeded carpels but also in the form of the flowers. Besides this there are known four other species.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.*\n1. **Scaphium Wallichii**, R. Br., only known from one gathering in Martaban in Wallich\u2019s collection and described usually as *Sterculia scaphigera*, Wall. Cat. 1130. I have seen no flowers of this species which has much larger leaves than the commoner species, *S. affine*.\n\n2. **Scaphium affine**, Ridl. (*Sterculia affine* Masters). This plant is the \u201cKembang Semangkok\u201d of the Malays and occurs in Singapore, Malacca and Pahang. Pierre\u2019s *Sterculia scaphigera* (Fl. For. Cochinchine, t. 201) may be this species but the flowers have not been seen.\n\nThe species is very distinct in its small short-tubed flowers with a very short stalked staminal column quite glabrous. The inflorescence is very tomentose.\n\n3. **S. Beccarianum**, (Pierre l.c.) is a native of Sarawak, in Borneo, and has quite glabrous flowers more resembling those of *S longiflorum*. I found fallen fruits and leaves of what I take to be this species in the Matang forest. The fruit which has not been described is thin and green, 5 inches long and over 1\u00bd inches deep, much shorter and broader and quite blunt at the tip. The seed was an inch long.\n\n4. **Scaphium linearicarpum**, (*Sterculia linearicarpa*, Masters) a rare Malacca tree, belongs to the genus also.\n\n**Pterygota Roxburghii**, Schott and Endl. Melet. p. 32 (*Sterculia alata* Roxburgh) (*Sterculiaceae*) is given in King\u2019s *Materials* as a native of the Malay Peninsula on the strength of a specimen in Scortechini\u2019s collections without locality. The tree is a native of Southern India and the Andamans. It has been introduced from the Calcutta Gardens and largely planted as a roadside tree in Singapore and Penang, and perhaps Scortechinni\u2019s specimens are not from a wild plant. No one else has found it wild, and it would be advisable to leave it out of our Flora until we get additional evidence of its being a native tree. The genus *Pterygota* of which there are several species in Africa, is a very good one, and distinct from *Sterculia*.\n\n**Buettneria brevipes**, n. sp. (*Sterculiaceae*). A glabrous woody climber. *Leaves* coriaceous, elliptic, obtuse, base narrowed truncate, nerves five pairs conspicuous on both surfaces as are the reticulations, inarching within the margin, 4\u00bd inches long, 2 inches wide; petiole 2 inches long. *Cymes* numerous, slender, axillary, 1 inch long; pedicels umbellate, very slender, minutely pubescent. *Sepals* lanceolate, acuminate, 3 inches long. *Petals* about as long as the sepals, base obcuneate with 2 short points at the upper angles, apex caudate. *Staminal tube* short, broad, cylindric; anthers small, oblong. *Ovary* small, ovate, conic 5-lobed bluntly with seabrid angles. Fruit not seen.\nDINDINGS: at Simpit near Lumut (Ridley).\n\nAllied to B. Curtisii, Oliv. of Penang, but the leaves are much broader with more nerves and conspicuous reticulations. They are dark brown when adult and dry.\n\n**Buettneria uncinata**, Mast. in Hook. fil., Fl. Brit. Ind. i. p. 377 and King, Journ., As. Soc. Bengal, p. 200, 91. *(Sterculiaceae)*. The type of this in Herb. Kew, is a fruiting specimen of *Mallotus Griffithianus*, Hook. fil. *(Euphorbiaceae)* collected by Maingay in Malacca. Another sheet put with it in Herb. Kew as possibly the same is also a species of Mallotus.\n\n**Waltheria indica**, Linn. is given by King as occurring \u201cin all the provinces, a weed,\u201d I have never seen a specimen of this at all from the Malay Peninsula, either in Kew or the British Museum herbarium; nor have ever seen it myself anywhere in the Peninsula. It is a common weed in many parts of the world and may be expected to turn up; but it has not done so yet.\n\n**Murraya caloxygen**, Ridl. *(Rutaceae)*. I found that this plant was flowering in the Singapore Botanic Gardens in the spring of 1915, although little more than a bush about 6 feet tall. The petals and stamens have never been described. The *petals* are 1\u00b75 inches long and 0\u00b725 inches wide in the upper part; they are linear spathulate, gradually narrowed to the base and pale green, four or five in number. The *sepals* or rather lobes of the calyx are also either 4 or 5. The *stamens* nearly half an inch long, have long slender filaments, small oblong anthers with the connective prolonged into a short point beyond the cells; they are 8 in number. In the flower and foliage this plant resembles most a *Murraya*, but the fruit is quite unlike that of any species described, and is more like that of *Limonia*. On the whole I think it better to keep it in the genus *Murraya*.\n\n**Diodia sarmentosa**, Sw. Prodr. Veg. Ind. Occ. p. 30. *(Rubiacae)*. I found this new addition to our Flora abundantly on the East Coast road near Tanjong Katong in Singapore. It is a herbaceous plant growing as much as 2 feet tall, the stem hairy, four-angled, stout, the ridges crisped in the upper part. *Leaves* obovate, sessile, 2\u00b75 inches long, 2\u00b725 inches wide, apex subacute, base narrowed, hairy on both sides, with 6 pairs of nerves; stipules linear, bristles numerous. *Flowers* numerous, crowded in axillary heads. *Calyx* lobes 4, hairy, 0\u00b725 inches long. *Corolla* 1\u00b72 inches long, lobes rounded white tipped with lilac. *Capsule* 1 inch long hairy, splitting from the top to near the base into 2 cocci, which dehisce on the inner face. Each contains one elliptic brown seed deeply grooved on the inner face.\n\nThis plant is a native of South America and the West Indies and also occurs in Tropical Africa and the Mascarene islands, but I cannot find any specimens from Asia in the Kew Herbarium, nor any record of its occurring in any part of Asia.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nDendrocalamus hirtellus, n.sp. (Gramineae). A tall bamboo, about 40 feet long, and 2 inches through, but rather weak, walls thin, internodes long. Leaves broad, oblong, acuminate, with a long point, base broad rounded, glabrous above, softly pubescent beneath, 11 inches long, 1\u00b75 inches wide; petiole thick, 1 inch long, glabrous; ligule of few stiff bristles; sheath glabrous. Panicle branches pendulous, 3 feet long. Spikelets in dense heads 5 inches through and 1\u00b75 inches apart; bracts numerous ovate acute keeled. Glume I, lanceolate; glume II similar, but longer many nerved; III twice as long as I, mucronate; IV similar longer. Palea shorter, lanceolate, three-nerved, pale. Stamens 6, filaments free: anthers oblong, muticous, exsert. Style simple shortly plumed.\n\nJohore: in forests at Genuang (Ridley) April 1915.\n\nSchizostachyum elegans, n.sp. (Gramineae). Stems slender, 1 inch through; walls rather thick: internodes long and weak; branches slender, whorled. Leaves thin, lanceolate, acuminate, pubescent beneath, margins denticulate, base narrowed to the very short petiole, 6 inches long, 7\u00b75 inches wide; ligule of few rather long bristles; sheath hairy. Panicles graceful, 15 inches long slightly geniculate, branches 2-4 inches long: spikelets 2\u00b75 inches long, light green, 4 or 5 in a fascicle, with several ovate bracts at base, fascicles little over 2\u00b75 inches apart. Glume I ovate; II longer, lanceolate, shortly mucronate; III still longer, mucronate; IV similar but longer. Palea a little shorter, lanceolate, not keeled, glume-like but thinner. Stamens 6; filaments free; anthers exsert, oblong, obtuse, violet. Ovary conic, stipitate, subtriquetrous: style simple, grain obliquely blunt conic stipitate.\n\nKedah: Lankawi Islands: common, cultivated in the Botanic Gardens Penang, where it forms a large bush of sarmentose habit and where it flowered in March 1915.\nSir Stamford Raffles, in 1817, when on leave in England, was appointed by the Court of Directors of the Honourable East India Company to the post of Lieutenant-Governor of the decaying settlement of Bencoolen in Sumatra; and he sailed from Portsmouth to take up his new duties. He had attached to his staff the naturalist Joseph Arnold, whose name is so aptly associated with his own in *Rafflesia Arnoldi*\u2014that of the parasite with the gigantic flower, which they discovered together on a journey into the interior of Sumatra (May 20th, 1818). Soon after this, perhaps from the fatigues of this very journey, Arnold died (vide *Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles*, London 1830, p. 365).\n\nAffairs so fell that after Arnold\u2019s death Raffles had to revisit Calcutta, and when there he got together a staff of naturalists. This is how he alludes to them in a letter dated Nov. 26th, 1818 to the Duchess of Somerset \u201cI take down from hence a medical man of the name of Jack, who will be entrusted with the botanical part of my researches: and I have two Frenchmen, M. Diard and M. Duvaucel, the former the pupil and the later the step-son of Cuvier......... These three savans with a missionary clergyman, who takes charge of a printing press, form my equipment from Calcutta, so that I hope we may do something.\u201d\n\nWilliam Jack, who has thus been introduced to the reader, was the eldest son of the Rev. William Jack, and his wife Grace Boult.\n\nOf the father, Dr. J. W. H. Traill, Professor of Botany in the University of Aberdeen, has been so good as to supply the following information. He had the degrees of M.A. and M.D. and was chosen to be Professor of Mathematics in King\u2019s College, Aberdeen in 1794. This chair he held until 1811 when he exchanged it for that of Moral Philosophy. In 1815 he was elected to the post of Principal, and held it until his death at a great age in 1854.\n\nThe son\u2019s career is given in Hooker\u2019s Companion to the Botanical Magazine, i. 1835, p. 120, from the pen of his mother:\nand thence the following statements have been taken. William Jack, the younger, was born in King's College on January 29th, 1795, and at the age of six was sent to the Grammar School. At the age of twelve he proceeded to the University, and at fourteen commenced the study of medicine. Mr. McLachlan, the Head-Master of the Grammar School, seems to have given him an excellent grounding in Latin, and at the same time Mr. Duncan, Professor of Natural Philosophy, taught him to apply his knowledge by reading descriptions in the Latin botany books of the period of the wild plants which already interested him. There were two other Aberdeen botanists of the time who are said to have helped him\u2014Dr. Beattie and Dr. Knight; but the first named can have had little influence as he died when Jack was eight. William Knight must have had much more influence: he was a young man, nine years older than young Jack; and from 1811 to 1815 he taught Botany in Aberdeen privately.\n\nAt the age of sixteen Jack graduated M.A. in Aberdeen, and was preparing to proceed to Edinburgh to go through the Medical Schools there, when scarlet fever laid him up, and caused him to lose the session. During this break Mr. Duncan having been paralysed, young Jack taught the university botany class for a short time. In October, 1911, he proceeded to London to finish his medical training there, and on the last day of January, 1912, he was orally examined by the Court of the College of Surgeons, and admitted a Fellow.\n\nHis friends, chiefly the eminent judge Sir Vicary Gibbs and Lady Gibbs, at once sought for him a surgeonship under the Honourable East India Company, but he preferred to defer his departure, and remained in Britain until the sailing of the Company's ship \"Baring\" on January 29th, 1913.\n\nPublished with the memoir from which the above facts are drawn are extracts from letters, which show that after his arrival in Calcutta, he was attached to a regiment stationed at the adjoining cantonment of Dum-Dum, and was then sent out with troops which fought in the Nepalese war. It is recorded that on January 9th, 1815, he was encamped on the Chorea ghattee hills with the force advancing on Khatmandoo, but he had not been in the fight at Pursua. A month later he was at Bichiakoh, encamped in the broad stony bed of the stream which debouches from those hills at that halting place. In May he was back at the cantonment of Dinapur, near Patna.\n\nFrom Dinapur he wrote to his parents as follows \"I have lately opened a correspondence with Dr. Wallich the Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanic Garden, from which I expect to derive both pleasure and advantage. Till now I have always felt at a loss in my botanical researches, from not being acquainted with the progress of the science in India, and particularly with Roxburgh's extensive labours and discoveries, so that I could never\nbe sure that my own were not anticipated. It was to remedy this and to obtain, if possible, a copy of Roxburgh's manuscript descriptions, that I wished to commence an intercourse with the present Superintendent. In the first letter which I wrote to Dr. Wallich, I sent him some seeds, and a description of a Lobelia which I had found in Nepaul, and which did not agree with any published species. I received in reply a most friendly letter, accompanied by some papers of his own on Indian Botany, informing me that my Lobelia was a perfectly new species, and soliciting further communications. I have since transmitted to him another despatch, with more plants which I conceive to be new.\" Then again he wrote on July 19th, 1818, \"I have paid a visit to Dr. Wallich, at the Botanic Garden, a short distance from Calcutta; he received me with great kindness and warmth, and insists on my coming to stay with him while I remain here. He is......... much inclined to assist me in obtaining some situation, which may open a field for Botanical research, and connect me with himself in that Department. He has already introduced my name with due acknowledgements, in a paper presented to the Asiatic Society, containing an account of some new plants from Nepaul, one of which was communicated by me.\" Then again he writes under the date August 19th, 1818, \"Dr. Wallich has kindly insisted on my staying with him to pursue my Botanical researches: he has an excellent house in a delightful situation, about six miles below Calcutta, where I hope to pass my time most agreeably, free from those temptations to fatigue and exertion which beset me at Calcutta, and where I trust to be so much benefitted by ease of body and mind, that my health will improve as fast as it could from a sea voyage.\" So Jack had been ill: it was of lung trouble; and Sir Stamford Raffles says in a letter of Jan. 1st, 1823, that it was contracted during the Nepalese war, with which his Indian Service began. Jack continues:\u2014\"I am now engaged in drawing up a paper of some of my discoveries, which I have promised to furnish for a periodical work, about to be printed at the Serampore press.\"\n\nAgain on November 10th, 1818, he writes:\u2014I hasten to inform you of the occurrences of the last few days, which have made a considerable alteration in my plans, since I wrote to you. Some days ago Sir Stamford Raffles, the governor of Sumatra, came here to see the garden, and spent the day, during which Dr. Wallich and I had a long conversation with him, the result of which has been my agreeing to accompany him to Sumatra, and his promising to forward my views, and in particular, to afford me every facility for exploring the Natural History of that island. ....... I expect to sail, shortly, with Sir Stamford Raffles in the Company's cruiser \"Nearchus.\"\n\nNathaniel Wallich, who was thus instrumental in bringing Jack to the notice of Sir Stamford Raffles, was a Dane, and had been in the service of the Danish East India Company established\nat Serampur on the river Hoogly above Calcutta. From Serampur, when the Danish territory was ceded, his ability secured, after some little delay, the post at the Botanic Gardens which he desired so much. To him,\u2014a generous and good friend,\u2014Jack wrote as he had a mind to do: and the letters were filed by Wallich along with other considerable accumulations. They have been copied at the expense of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society under the kind supervision of Major A. T. Gage, the present Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, on the suggestion of Mr. H. N. Ridley, and are here for the first time printed with the omission\u2014always indicated\u2014of certain criticisms passed on Diard and Duvaucel, and of the official letters from Raffles to them at the end of their service which may be read in the first edition of Lady Raffles' Memoir of Sir Stamford Raffles.\n\nThe voyage from Calcutta to Penang (Dec. 10th to Dec. 31st, 1818) was made as planned in the \"Nearchus\" and took just twenty-one days.\n\nThe voyage from Calcutta to Penang (Dec. 10th to Dec. 31st, Council by Colonel John Alexander Bannerman, a senior officer who had even served on the Directorate in London, and had been sent out in 1817. Bannerman seems to have considered himself too senior to suffer the interference of a younger man like Raffles and to have lent a very willing ear to opposing counsels from his second commissioner. But Raffles had the authority of the Marquess of Hastings then Governor-General in India (1) to bring to a close the disputed succession to the Kingship of Acheen, and (2) subsequently to endeavour to effect a settlement further to the eastward than Penang.\u2014both matters which had been very much in the hand of the Governor of Penang: in fact Bannerman had just tried under the orders of the Court of Directors to effect this last himself, and failed, because the Dutch forestalled him. It seems that he was therefore unwilling to see how another could succeed, and he proved obstructive. It has been hinted that some of his subordinates were venial: and if so it may be asked whether it was merely by prescience or by leakage of information that the Dutch came to forestall Bannerman at Rhio; but the biscuit had been fingered hesitatingly before by Bannerman (see Memoir of Sir Stamford Raffles, p. 395). With these matters Jack had nothing to do: they took Raffles away from Penang where he left his wife in the charge of Jack as her confinement was approaching.\n\nMajor W. Farquhar, we shall see, met Raffles at Penang possibly by accident but more probably by appointment: for if by accident why had he brought his drawings (see p. 153) with him. It was he who had been sent by Bannerman only a few weeks earlier to found the establishment at Rhio: and he on his return found himself under Raffles orders instead. Doubtless the handing over of the services of his emissary to the younger man would be a thing particularly nettling to Bannerman; for that the services were\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nhanded over is evident from Jack\u2019s remark that Raffles had sent Farquhar on a mission down the Straits, when the change of front on the part of the Governor caused him to go first to Singapore, and only afterwards to Acheen.\n\nThe Acheen affair proved very tedious, and Raffles records that the proceedings taken down in the investigation ran to upwards of a thousand pages of the Company\u2019s largest sized paper. He had returned from founding Singapore to Penang and thence gone forward to Acheen; and all this time Jack was left with light duties and the interesting flora of Prince of Wales Island to investigate.\n\nOf books Jack seems to have possessed Roxburgh\u2019s *Hortus Bengalensis*\u2014a mere catalogue printed in 1814, his *Coromandel plants*, Loureiro\u2019s *Flora cochinchinensis*, Rumpf\u2019s *Herbarium amboinense*, and Lamarck\u2019s volumes of the *Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique* and some of Poiret\u2019s, together with extracts from the manuscript of Roxburgh\u2019s *Flora indica*. Later he employed through Wallich, a clerk to copy the whole manuscript, and he commenced to subscribe for Rees\u2019 *Cyclopaedia*, De Candolle\u2019s *Regni Vegetabilis Systema* and Roemer and Schultes\u2019 *Systema vegetabilium*. He also bought Rheede\u2019s great *Hortus Malabaricus*. In 1820 Carey and Wallich produced the first volume of their revision of Roxburgh\u2019s *Flora*, and an early copy was sent to Jack, who thereupon sent back to Carey what seem to have advance sheets.\n\nHe employed a Chinese draftsman in Penang: but it is not recorded if he continued to employ artists afterwards.\n\nThe interest of the time was the finding of new species, and their cataloguing. Jack brought to this work a really excellent understanding of the natural system of classification, a kind of intuition, the origins of which must have come from work in Britain: and had he lived longer his work would have been splendid. He also showed a small interest in geographic botany.\n\n**SERIES 1\u2014PENANG LETTERS.**\n\nPrince of Wales Island\n\nJan. 14th 1819.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nAt length the land of promise begins to open to me, and very glorious it seems to be. I am so thoroughly occupied that I perceive I shall have little time to write to you, if I put it off to the last, therefore mean to take an hour or two from the night occasionally and to continue my letters at intervals, which though it will make them a little disjointed, I am sure you will excuse, as I shall thereby be able to give you longer details. Of the voyage I need not say much but that it was long and tedious, and on several accounts far from comfortable. Sir Stamford was very ill during part of it.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nWe landed on the 31st and soon forgot everything unpleasant. Among the first objects that saluted me were the Nutmeg and Clove;\u00b9 of the latter there are two trees in full blossom before my door. The pride of the East, the Mangosteen, next presented itself. I must seek and get someone to attempt grafting it for the purpose of being sent round. The variegated Pineapple,\u00b2 I believe is only a variety of the cultivated; but I have heard of another kind which probably differs specifically. The *Melastoma malabathrica* is in the greatest profusion. The situation of the anthers before flowering is very remarkable.\n\nI am convinced this Island will produce many things entirely new. I have already met with and described two species of *Mangifera*, which must be quite new. The first is called the Bachang and for which I intend the specific name of *M. rubicunda*.\u00b3 ['Foliis lato lanceolatis retusis, paniculis ascendentibus, floribus submonandris, corollis infundibuliformibus limbo patente demum reflexo'].\u2074 The other is a very singular one, which I propose to call *M. quadrifida*,\u2075 [foliis oblongo lanceolatis, paniculis axillaribus laxis, floribus quadrifidis, monandris, petalis nudis glandulosis]. Another very interesting discovery is the *Nelumbium javanicum*, Lamarck,\u2076 which seems to have been overlooked by later authors, but is without doubt a distinct species from the *N. indicum*. I have also found the *Rubus alce\u00e6folius*, Lamarck,\u2077 which also seems\n\n---\n\n1. In the year 1818 there were 6,900 nutmeg trees in bearing in the island of Penang (vide Ridley, *Spices*, London, 1912, p. 102) besides large numbers of younger trees or males\u2014the acquisition of 22 years; for it was in 1796 that the East India Company undertook the introduction and sent Christopher Smith to the Moluccas for the purpose: and by 1802, when the trees first fruited, Smith and his successors had sent out from the Moluccas 71,266 in all, mostly to Penang.\n\nTo the same date they had sent out 55,265 clove trees, also in chief part to Penang; but there was only a lesser measure of success with them up to the time of Jack\u2019s visit.\n\n2. It is quite possible that the pineapple with variegated leaves was familiar to Jack from existing in the Calcutta garden. Roxburgh the first Superintendent of the Garden, knew of its existence \u201cin Malacca.\u201d It thrives well in Penang.\n\n3. Jack subsequently found that the bachang had received the name of *Mangifera foetida* from Roxburgh: and in these letters we find him first suspecting that this was so, asking Wallich for a diagnosis: then sending specimens to Wallich, which appear to have reached Calcutta safely for, in or after 1828, Wallich when distributing the collections of the East India Company sent out under No. 8488 material of *M. foetida* collected by Jack. We find in Carey\u2019s and Wallich\u2019s revision of Roxburgh\u2019s *Flora Indica* a description borrowed from Jack (vol. ii., p. 440).\n\n4. *Mangifera quadrifida*, Jack, found a place in the same work, where occur almost the very words used above.\n\n5. *Nelumbium javanicum*, Lamk., has been reduced to *Nelumbium speciosum* along with *N. indicum*.\n\n6. *Rubus alce\u00e6folius*, Poir., is the common bramble in the low ground of Malaya, which has passed in our floras as *R. moluccanus*. It is interesting that Curtis had not found it in Penang (this journal No. 25, 1894).\nto have been neglected. I have a species of *Loranthus*, which from the specific name I think may be Roxburgh\u2019s *L. ferruginea*. Mine is quadrifid, tetrandrous. There is also very common here a species of *Morinda*, which appears to differ from all Roxburgh\u2019s in having both the anthers and style exsert. What confusion there has been about the *Mimusops Kauki*. I wish I had Roxburgh\u2019s character of it. There is a hexandrous species here about which I am doubtful. Major Farquhar who has been for many years resident at Malacca, arrived here the day before us. He has made a very large collection of drawings and subjects of Natural History. I have just had an opportunity of examining his drawings of Malacca plants. Most unfortunately, from want of scientific acquaintance with the subject they are deficient in many essential points of dissection, but they will be extremely useful as a guide, by taking the native names of all that promise to be new or interesting, and making inquiries accordingly for the originals.\n\nI have not yet been up the hill, but shall soon, when I shall find an abundant harvest. There is a species of Fir here with solitary leaves which is probably new\u2014I am in hopes of getting cones. The arborescent ferns are I am told in great abundance.\n\nOur future plans are not determined, probably we shall go first to Bencoolen, it being a great object to arrive there early on account of Lady Raffles.\n\nThere does not appear to be any great cordiality here on the part of this Government, nor am I surprised, for they cannot but feel how little and insignificant they are in comparison with the energy of Sir Stamford.\n\nI cannot express to you how much I am delighted with him; he is of the real Sterling stamp, of that active and comprehensive mind that diffuses a portion of its own energy to all around: even\n\n---\n\n7. *Loranthus ferrugineus*, Roxb., is one of the commonest of the mistletoes in Penang.\n\n8. *Morinda umbellata*, Linn. is the common Morinda of Penang. Whether anthers an exserted or not, is but a sexual character in it: and sexual dimorphism was little understood in Jack\u2019s time.\n\n9. Wallich quotes a series of synonyms under *M. Kauki* in his Catalogue: and it is known that he was both confused and confused others over this species. Probably he had been talking to Jack about it.\n\n10. There were two Farquhars connected with Malacca about this time. The one was the Lieutenant-Colonel Sir R. T. Farquhar who as Governor of Penang in the year 1795 suggested the demolition of the fortifications of Malacca. The other, this Major William Farquhar of the Engineers, described truly by Jack as for many years Resident at Malacca\u2014actually from 1803 to 1818,\u2014and at a later date, when a Colonel, the first Resident and Commandant of Singapore. He employed, so we learn also from Wallich, a Chinese artist, and was the discoverer of that strange fern *Matonia pectinata* on Mount Ophir. Buckley in his *Anecdotal History of Singapore* (1902) vol. 1, p. 50 details his service, and adds (p. 105) that he died in retirement in 1839.\n\n11. *Dacrydium elatum*, Wallich, which was new at that date.\nour two savans feel a little of the Promethian touch, without which\u2014it is needless to say more. Twelve o'clock, so good night.\n\nJan. 16th\u2014I find mention made of a species of *Mangifera*, *M. foetida*, which I suspect is the Bachang, and which I prematurely proposed calling *rubicunda*.\\(^{12}\\) Have you a description of that species? if so, you will be able to judge from the character I gave you and you shall have specimens by the first opportunity; there has not been one yet. We have remarkably rainy weather, which probably is one cause of the difficulty I have found in getting the plants poisoned, I have been obliged to throw away many.\n\nDo you know that the *Rhizophora* has four ovula, three of which abort? I have made a very accurate investigation and sketch of the carpology of a species which I found here,\\(^{14}\\) which approaches to the *R. cylindrica*, but differs in several respects, particularly in habit, erect conduplicate petals, and peduncles 3\u20144-florous. They are a very extraordinary tribe; if I am not mistaken, you refer *Avicennia* to it. Are you acquainted with the Rambutan, *Nephelium lappaceum* of authors, *scytalia rambutan*, Roxb.\\(^{15}\\) Is it not surprising that the analogy with the Litchi should have escaped observation? Look at what a strange corner Jussieu has popped it into. Its being diclinous, is very peculiar, and I suppose the cause of the mistake. I think Roxburgh was right in his idea of the Natural Order, whether it is admissible merely as a species of *Scytalia* is not quite so certain, what say you? I have found a singular species of *Pothos* with aculeate petioles and scapes, and large pinnatifid leaves with long linear divisions, can it be Roxburgh's *pinnatifida*?\\(^{16}\\) Pray send me his specified charac-\n\n\\(^{12}\\) Diard and Duvaucel; see the introductory lines, p. 147, and letters below at pages 187 and 201 et seq.\n\n\\(^{13}\\) See note No. 3, p. 152.\n\n\\(^{14}\\) *Rhizophora caryophylloides*, Jack, which is now placed as *Bruguiera caryophylloides*, Blume. The species to which he compares it, *Rhizophora cylindrica*, is now placed as *Bruguiera parviflora*, W. & A., and is common in the Sundribans of Bengal. Jack described *Rhizophora caryophylloides* in the Malayan Miscellanies and the description was reprinted in Hooker's Botanical Miscellany, ii. p. 86.\n\n\\(^{15}\\) The rambutan had been introduced into the Calcutta Botanic Gardens during Roxburgh's time; but it does not thrive in northern India, and was probably lost before Jack came to know the plants therein. Jack wrote at a later date than this, as internal evidence shows, his description of the plant which was published in the Malayan Miscellanies, vol. 1, (1820) No. 1, p. 10.\n\n\\(^{16}\\) *Pothos pinnatifida*, Roxb., for the characters of which Jack asks, is a climbing plant of Sumatra which was introduced into the Calcutta gardens under Roxburgh, and described by him from leafy specimens. It has been reduced in the *Flora of British India* to *Epipremnum mirabile* where the locality is given as \"Penang, Roxburgh.\" But without doubt Ridley is right in stating that this is probably an error; perhaps the original source of it is here, and its perpetuation was due to one of Wallich's annotations, vide Ridley, Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula, iii. (1907) p. 46.\n\nJack's plant would be *Lasia aculeata*, Lour., and therefore Roxburgh's *Pothos heterophylla* instead of *P. pinnatifida*.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nters. I find here a remarkable variety, or more probably a distinct species from the *Acanthus ilicifolius*, to be readily distinguished even at a distance by its flowers being white, much smaller, and in longer quadrifarious spikes, only at the summits of the branches. The true *A. ilicifolius* is also to be found here, so that I have the opportunity of comparing them together, and find besides the above striking differences the following more minute ones\u2014Calyx shorter than the tube, one bracteate at base, style shorter than the stamens, and stigma simple in the white one; the contrary of which is the case in *A. ilicifolius*, which has three bracts to the calyx and a bifid stigma. In leaves and habit they are much alike, and equally prickly. By the bye, is not Lamarck in a mistake in attributing to the *ilicifolius*, alternate leaves? see \u201cEnc. 1 sub Acantho.\u201d Pray is not that splendid *Cassia* which we often took notice of on the walk down to the great *Ficus infectoria* the *Cassia alata*, Linn. and not a Roxburghian species? it is here abundant on the roadside. The *Mussaenda frondosa* is another ornament of these neglected spots.\n\nJan. 23rd\u2014My occupations have been a little interrupted by an unexpected series of events which have produced quite a revolution in our little world, and which I must now give you a short account of, that I may carry you along with me in everything that occurs. I have already mentioned that I thought there was no cordiality on the part of the Government towards Sir Stamford, and you shall hear presently the lengths they have since proceeded in their spirit of jealousy. You probably know that Sir Stamford left Bengal with a commission to settle the affairs of Acheen where two rivals have been contending for power, and\n\n---\n\n17. *Acanthus ebracteatus*, Vahl. It happens that *A. ilicifolius*, Linn., is not recorded from Penang; but there is no reason why it should not occur or have occurred in Jack\u2019s time.\n\n18. *Cassia alata*, Linn., occurs in Penang as a cultivated plant and an escape from cultivation. It is used medicinally as a poultice for Ringworm, and grown for the purpose.\n\n19. *Mussaenda frondosa*, Linn. does not occur in Penang; but *M. glabra*, Wall. is of common occurrence; and it would be this which Jack had noticed.\n\n20. The rivals were (1) Johar Alam, the king, who had ascended the throne in 1802 and (2) Saif-ul-Alam, son by a slave girl, of a wealthy Penang merchant named Said Husein, the father himself being again the son of a slave girl.\n\nAcheen for long had been a hotbed of trouble because the chiefs were almost as powerful as the king and therefore able to resist him. In this case they seem to have been done out of import exactions by the King, who permitted trade only at Acheen, and they conspired with the rich Penang family for the sake of the money that they needed for resisting; so that armed vessels paid for by Said Husein sailed from the Settlement to harass the King. From 1815 to the date of Raffles\u2019 mission this particular brew of mischief fermented; and the Penang Government was miserably timid throughout,\u2014parleying with traitors, permitting hostile acts to take their origin in their own port, and worse than that by some of the officials assuredly taking bribes. Once a judge condemned Said Husein to prison, and the Recorder released him with honour. So they played fast and loose.\n\nThe story may be read in John Anderson\u2019s *Acheen and the ports of the north and east of Sumatra* (London, 1840).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nboth are desirous of obtaining our aid and protection. He has also in view to make some settlements farther to the Eastward, and as these are in fact the most important, he was anxious to make the earliest possible arrangement of the Acheen affairs in order to be more at liberty in proceeding with his other plans. Expedition however forms no part of the political code of Penang, besides which, there has been such a scene of intrigue, and I believe I may add corruption going on here in regard to Acheen as is quite disgusting. Of the two rivals whose claims are to be decided, the one is the legitimate King, with whom the nobles quarreled some time since, and whose power is insufficient to preserve peace; the other is the son of a Penang merchant, who appears to have no other claim than his father\u2019s immense wealth, and the support he has,\u2014God knows why!\u2014been receiving from this government. You may easily imagine that the arrival of a man like Sir Stamford to clear up such a business as this, could not be welcomed by those whose schemes were likely to be overcast by the event; and they accordingly determined to throw every possible obstacle in the way, and to try every scheme that cunning could suggest to defeat his objects and prevent if possible their own disgrace. It would be tiresome to relate to you the artifices, the meannesses they had recourse to in the pursuit of this object, suffice it to say their conduct was disgraceful not only to their rank and situation, but to their character as men. But they had to do with a man too much their superior. Sir Stamford first intended to have gone to Bencoolen on Lady Raffles\u2019 account, and to have returned to make the final arrangements. The intrigues that were going on here however rendered the execution of that plan impossible, and he was at last obliged to determine on her remaining here, and going himself over to Acheen. In the meantime, that his other plans might not be entirely suspended, during the delays of the Acheen business, he employed Major Farquhar to proceed on a mission down the Straits, as, though very desirous of it, he could not go himself. Major Farquhar sailed on the 18th and he was to go in a few days after to Acheen. Now you must know that Sir Stamford had offered to the Governor that if he wished to make any reference to Bengal on the subject of Acheen, that he would delay his proceedings till an answer should arrive and in the meantime pursue his ulterior object, but the Governor was just as averse to these other views, and wished if possible to\n\n21. Lady Raffles recorded that an attempt was made to influence Sir Stamford by the presentation of a casket of diamonds to her. Vide Memoir of the Life and Public Service of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles 1830, p. 379. Anderson hints that the official interpreter for Achinese, a man with an European name, was not without bias.\n\n22. Raffles\u2019 determination to leave Lady Raffles in Penang is mentioned in one of his published letters dated Jan. 16th, 1819, i.e. two days before the Governer\u2019s change of front.\n\n23. Jack is silent as to the object of the mission, which is quite likely to have been an examination of the Karimon islands.\nprevent his accomplishing either, therefore declined the offer, in hopes, by throwing obstacles in the way, to keep him idle here. He was afraid to take any decided step to prevent his going to Acheen till after Major Farquhar should have sailed for fear he should go away on that expedition. But no sooner was Major Farquhar's ships out of harbour than he addressed to Sir Stamford the most urgent solicitation that he would suspend all proceedings relative to Acheen till a reply should be received to important references that had already been made to Bengal. This, I suppose was considered a master stroke of policy, but respice finem. The moment he received this, Sir Stamford took his resolution: Major Farquhar's ships were but just outside the harbour, and at anchor till next tide: he immediately dispatched intimation to them, ordered the ship in which he was to have proceeded to Acheen to get ready to go to sea immediately, and commenced sending everything on board. This was in the evening, and as soon as everything was arranged for his starting before day-break next morning, he wrote to the Governor to say that he had determined to meet his wishes, and complied with his request of suspending all proceedings relative to Acheen till the arrival of the expected reply, and had in consequence determined to sail next day to overtake Major Farquhar, and that he should return in time to resume the Acheen affairs after the requested delay had been granted. Every arrangement being made he did embark next morning and set sail.24 before the people here, who had no idea of any such promptitude and decision, knew anything about it, or had time to consider on any further obstacles to impede his progress. You may easily conceive the Governor's astonishment and disappointment, at finding his scheme defeated, and falling into a snare of his own devising. But there was no remedy. As Sir Stamford wished me to remain with Lady Raffles, here I am, in a house which he took for her residence while here, in preference to being a guest at the Governor's. Could anything be more excellent? In the first place admire the energy of Sir Stamford, then think how comfortable I am, with so agreeable a woman as Lady R., abundant leisure to examine the productions of this Island: in short I am delighted, and the day is not half long enough for all that I have and wish to do. It is needless after what I have related to make any comments on the extraordinary conduct of the\n\n---\n\n24. Note how in seeking his settlement to the eastward before closing the Acheen business, Raffles deviated from that narrow path of subservience which must be taken to satisfy certain superiors,\u2014a path followed with such faithful subordination to the Board of Directors, and so ineptly, by the Government of Penang throughout these years. To Colonel Bannerman, who himself had been a Director, the \"sin\" may well have seemed large; and larger, because if Raffles had obeyed the letter of his orders, the instructions from Calcutta ordering him to desist would have overtaken him. Apparently this deviation was one of several acts of competence which caused the Board a little later to order that Raffles should have nothing further to do with Acheen, and to keep him in exile in decaying Beneoolen.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nGovernor of this Island; could I waste time and paper on details, the picture would astonish you. The fact of the matter is he is a weak man, with violence of temper sufficient to commit any folly or absurdity, and is entirely under the influence of one of the members of council, an artful designing character, utterly devoid of principle, who is the prime mover of all mischief, without appearing as a principal, and who does not care to what extremities he urges the other while he himself remains secure from the consequences. I wish I could convey to you some idea of the reverse of this picture, and contrast the activity and comprehensiveness of Sir Stamford\u2019s mind, with the narrow contracted spirit displayed in the other, which is almost too contemptible to be ridiculous. Were it not painful to see a British Governor so unworthy of his situation, I could really be amused, the whole is so perfect a burlesque upon politics. \u201cDu sublime au ridicule n\u2019est qu\u2019un pas\u201d was one of Bonaparte\u2019s observations, and really the only difference is often in the scale on which they are performed. That in fast is all that distinguishes an Iliad from a Batrachomyomachia. When a horde of Pindarries commits a few depredations and a Governor-General takes the field with the whole armed force of Hindostan to suppress them, it is grand! but if a Governor of Penang endeavours to place a king on the throne of Acheen, the trumpet of fame is silent, and yet neither of them perhaps surpasses in foresight and contrivance a wily school boy forming a scheme for the plunder of an orchard. Enough however upon this subject. I wish you had added to the list of names of Malacca trees and plants, the scientific names of such as you knew, it would rather have been an assistance. There are two or three of the first named, the Rambay and Dookoo for instance, whose fruit I have met with, but not the flowers, and have not therefore been able to determine yet. I shall add the Linnean names as I discovered them. Have you in the garden the Bua\n\n25. Jack, like another botanist, Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, felt no strong attachment towards the Marquess of Hastings; and from the way in which he writes to Wallich it appears as if his sentiments were shared; but their cause does not transpire in these letters. Buchanan-Hamilton had been treated at the close of his Indian career, as if he could shut up his interests like a tedious novel, and on a minute by the Marquess of Hastings the materials were clumsily withheld from him that he had gathered together to take to the India House there to elaborate in retirement. That years after, he still held himself unjustly treated is evident from the advice which he gave to Wallich to keep control of his collections. It may have been this: but is likely to have been something complex, which caused the feelings held by Jack.\n\nJack alludes here to the circumstance that Lord Hastings had called out in 1817, 116,000 infantry and cavalry, with 300 guns, which as Marshman remarks (History of India, ii. p. 327) was a force \u2018out of all proportion to the simple object of extinguishing bands of marauders who never stood attack.\u2019 But events justified Hastings; and Jack\u2019s remark is that of a boy in politics.\n\n26. *Baccaurea motleyana*, Hook. f. and *Lansium domesticum*, Jack.\nKrass, a species of *Aleurites*? I have just examined it, and was at first a little puzzled by it. It appears to have been described under three different genera, *Croton*, *Jatropha*, and *Aleurites*. I have not the least doubt that the *Croton moluccanum* and *Jatropha moluccana*, see Lamk. Enc. are the same thing; it is quite absurd to compare the two descriptions, which are almost word for word the same, and I should suppose Forster\u2019s *Aleurites triloba* also to refer to the same plant but for the trifid calyx which he attributes to it. I observe in the catalogue, only this latter mentioned; does Roxburgh make them to be all three the same? The calyx of the male of what I have examined is always bifid. There is here a large tree, at present only in fruit, which is called Bua Jiringa. I think it may be Roxburgh\u2019s *Mimosa Djiringa*. I will send you some of the fruit which is very peculiar, the pod being deeply sinuate or lobed on one side, each lobe or articulation monospermous and the whole spirally contorted.\n\nAs this letter has already become of rather an unconscionable length, I will have mercy upon you, and here close it. I shall send it to the Post Office to go by any accidental opportunity, which there sometimes is by native vessels or by the way of Madras\u2014which I may not hear of, and write again when I know of a good opportunity. Specimens of course must wait, as they are mostly too large for the Dak, but to show that they are not forgotten, I shall add a few small ones to take their chance, it would be useless to send good ones on a chance opportunity. I am afraid it will be sometime before I hear from you, as your letters will have gone to Benecoolen. As we may leave this about the 20th of Feb., I believe there would hardly be time after the receipt of this, to address me here.\n\nI am very anxious to have accounts.\n\n---\n\n27. *Aleurites triloba*, Forst. It was a fairly common tree about Calcutta at this time (vide Abbey-Yates, in the *Agricultural Ledger*, 1907, p. 31). *Jatropha moluccana*, Willd. and *Aleurites moluccana*, Willd. are synonyms.\n\n28. *Pithecolobium lobatum*, Benth., is the name which is applied now to Jack\u2019s *Mimosa Jiringa*. Jack published his description in the *Malayan Miscellanies*, i. No. 1 (1820) p. 14. The fate of the pod which he advises and of the specimens sent with his letter of March 5th is not to be traced; they do not appear to have found a place among the collections which Wallich distributed from 1828 forward, and in this respect are like a great quantity of further material which must have passed into the early Calcutta herbarium but never came out into any other,\u2014Roxburgh\u2019s dried plants for instance and more of Jack\u2019s material sent later. It may be suspected that such was lost from want of attention during Wallich\u2019s lengthy visits to Nepal, Singapore, Ava, and the sal forests of Oudh. And Wallich with such losses on his mind may well have become very anxious to carry through his distribution of the East Indian Company\u2019s herbarium in order to save the material.\n\n29.

Colonel, afterwards Major-General, Thomas Hardwicke (died 1835) a zoologist of great merit, served in the Indian army for many years, using his opportunities there and in Mauritius for collecting specimens, and making drawings. He was Vice-President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal when Lord Hastings was its President. A Major H\u2014is mentioned in the extracts of Jack's letters to his parents which Sir William Hooker printed, as stationed with Jack at Dinapur, and it may be that this was Major General Hardwicke.\n\n32. Probably Sonerila erecta, Jack, described in the Malayan Miscellanies, i. No. 5 p. 7.\n\n33. Alpinia mutica was described by Roxburgh as having been introduced into the Calcutta Botanical Gardens from Penang. It flowered in Calcutta; and it has been in many Gardens since, so that it is well known. But it has not been found in Penang by any one during the last century: and the query is raised whether Roxburgh got it from wild plants, it being extinct now in Penang, or from its known home on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula via Penang. The allied Alpinia assimilis, K. Schum., which occurs freely in Penang might have been mistaken by Jack for the other (vide Ridley, in this Journal No. 30, 1899, p. 165).\n\n34. Alpinia punicea, Roxb., Flora indica, i. p. 71 is Hornstedtia punicea, K. Schum., a plant not known to occur in Penang. But there is in the island H. megalocheilos, Ridl. which has \"crimson stars of flowers on the surface of the ground\" just as Jack describes this in the next letter: and it was probably it that he had obtained.\n\n35. It is worth remark in passing that here we have again one of the Roxburghian adoptions of a Dutch spelling of which Jack complains.

We have just had accounts from Sir Stamford, who has taken possession of Singapura (the City of the Lion) an ancient Capital of the Malays and situated on the Island of Singapore, opposite to Johor, and at the Eastern extremity of the Peninsula and Straits of Malacca, which is to be our principal settlement of that quarter, and a most important one it will be. We look for his return very soon. So much for affairs.\n\nNow for Botany; I am actually overwhelmed with the treasures that pour in upon me; I have been employed night and day so as not even to leave time for correspondence. I actually wish for a little remission, for my cough has been teasing me, but how is it possible! I cannot even now get through all; my specimens are in piles that are quite alarming, and I have not time to look over them: I must however take a day to make a selection for you. I look forward to getting on board ship to bring up arrears, and get things in some order, and then you shall not be forgotten. I am at this moment engaged upon a drawing of a splended new *Tacca*\\(^{39}\\) with entire leaves, diphyllous involucrem &c. &c.; of which you shall presently have a full account, and which I mean to dedicate to Lady Raffles. Say Amen! I will send you the drawing\n\n---\n\n\\(^{38}\\) This Calder belonged to one of the Agency firms in Calcutta, and appears to have been the James Calder, who supplied a geological paper to the eighteenth volume of the Asiatick Researches and was an energetic member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal two years later than the date of this letter. Dr. Gravely, Hon. Secretary of the Society has ascertained that James Calder was elected member on April 12th, 1817.\n\n\\(^{39}\\) *Tacca cristata*, Jack in Malayan Miscellanies, i. 1820, No. 5, p. 23, a common plant at low elevations in Penang. We find it here as *Tacca rafflesiana*, and in this understand how Wallich came to distribute it in or after 1828 under that name (Wall. Cat.

I have some recollection of you speaking about some Sylhet plants which you had so named; I shall enclose in this, a section of the seed of a Rubiaceous plant I found here only in seed, whose structure is so peculiar, that I think it may be your genus from the name.\n\nI enclose some ripe capsules of a diandrous plant, habitu didynamioid, which has puzzled me a little. I most distinctly recollect your Nepaul Koom Koom, which you referred to *Incarvillea*, but I think the capsules of this plant resemble it. The placentae are so peculiarly reflected, that they appear to be four celled; I have met with two or three species. It seems to have an affinity to Boea.\n\nI have also a new species of *Cookia* or *Wampi*, differing from the common one in having long tomentose leaves, consisting of 10 or 12 pairs of very inequilateral pinnae, and small greenish flowers whose petals are pellucidly punctate in the same manner as the leaves.\n\nI have found two very splended *Alpinias*, which I believe you have in the gardens, the *A. mutica* and *punicoides* of Roxburgh. The latter is particularly beautiful, throwing up its crimson stars at the very surface of the ground, and its noble leafy stems by their sides. I have also a smaller species which may be new.\n\nFeb. 15th\u2014Sir Stamford is returned, and there is a vessel going to Bengal to-night or tomorrow morning.

Tell me whether you think Roxburgh's *Phyteuma begonifolia* really belongs to that genus. I am doubtful. You can probably tell me at once what species of *Elaocarpus* is the one I have sent.

Perhaps I have not been successful, and then there is no more to be said. If I have, I think there is no need that my acceptance of this situation should render vain all the exertions of my friends.

There are numbers of plans in embryo, all of which I will enter upon as soon as I can find time. By the bye, a Mr. Gibson, a young man who was one of the officers of the Nearchus, is going up to Bengal, and will soon after come down to Bencoolen.

You are not yourself I know, over exact in accounts, therefore request you will beg as a favour to me, of Mrs. Wallich to keep an account of all the expenses you have been at, and may incur in future on my account, and be most particular and exact therein, as on that will depend my doing you the honour of teasing you with my commissions!! Dreadful threat.

With writing to Europe, the bustle of preparation for Sir Stamford\u2019s departure, plants coming in, and a variety of trifling interruptions, I had quite enough to do. Now I am quiet and at leisure. Sir Stamford sailed for Acheen on the 8th inst.; he wished to have delayed it till after Lady Raffles\u2019 confinement, but under the circumstances of the time, and the open hostility of the Government who appear resolved to indulge it to the utmost by any means, honorable or dis-honorable, he found it impossible to prolong his stay. On the 12th Lady R. was brought to bed of a son, and is now recovering very fast. I have just found means to send the agreeable intelligence to Sir Stamford, who will I am sure be delighted.

He rose to the position of Chief judge, Bengal, and then accepted the acting post of Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, in Roxburgh\u2019s absence when Buchanan-Hamilton, who had taken over the duties at first, was leaving India. This he did for the sake of his wife\u2019s health, it being thought that a stay outside the capital in the quiet of Shibpur might do her good; but losing her he begged leave to retire and left India in February, 1915, taking with him such an active interest in the promotion of Oriental Research as to bring about the foundation in London of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwhole of the Eastern Islands, and by establishing a complete monopoly of their trade, and shutting all the native ports against us, to exclude the British entirely from that commerce. The spirit of hostility in which their designs were carried on, was open and avowed: it is astonishing with what supineness we have looked upon their progress. In Bengal the subject seems scarcely to have attracted attention and indeed how could it in the full ardor of a grand Pindaree Hunt. This Government made one feeble effort, to get a settlement at the mouth of the Straits, but in their usual spirit of inefficiency and incapability, neglected to support it, and blundered the whole business so abominably, it was worse than doing nothing, for the Dutch finding out our object, came with a force, overturned our treaty and made another in their own favor, excluding us and all foreign nations from the port. This Government took the affront very quietly, in truth my own opinion is, that they would be well pleased at the complete success of the Dutch schemes, for so perfectly local are their prejudices and so narrow their views, that I believe they fancy the loss of the British influence to the Eastward, would increase the importance of this settlement, and that the loss of the commerce of the Islands, would make the possession of this paltry bit of a place, which has hitherto been maintained as a kind of intermediate station, appear the more valuable. It would make you laugh to hear the way in which the Governor talks of the vast and increasing prosperity of the Presidency, so it is always called. To listen to his account of the extensive cultivation and plantations of spices, nutmegs, cotton, tea, coffee, pepper, &c. &c. one would suppose that he was talking of a place equal to the peninsula of India. He got some time ago a single pod of Pernambuco cotton, which was sown, and has multiplied. He was so full of the vast superiority of this cotton, of the great importance of his discovery, and the plantations of it which were to drive all other cotton out of the European markets, that I was anxious to see this staple article of the commerce of Penang. It was some time before I could discover it; at last a couple of acres near the jail were pointed out to me, where amid the luxuriance of weeds, I distinguished a few stunted bushes of a Gossypium. This field is now figuring in the dispatches of the Government, and the Honorable Court of directors are, perhaps now calculating the profits of this new created commerce. In anticipation of these exhaustless resources, he is laying new duties upon trade, new taxes upon industry, raising new crops for the service of the Island, and declares he will make the Island pay its own expenses. I beseech you now, do not think that I am giving you a chapter from the annals of Laputa, it is plain sober fact, and I am now in the place of wonders.\n\n75. That of Penang.\n76. Pernambuco cotton had been introduced into India in the eighteenth century and considerable interest was being taken in it about this time. It has persisted in the damper parts of India, not as a field crop but as a garden plant useful for candle wicks, sacred thread, etc.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nTo return from this digression, Sir Stamford went down to endeavour to find a place fitted for a station at the mouth of the straits of Malacca, if such could be got unoccupied by the Dutch. Fortunately he found all that could be desired, at Singapore on the Island of the same name, one of the most commanding positions in that quarter. The place was formerly the Capital of the Malays, but had been deserted for many centuries, and its harbour was unknown to Navigators. He also found there the eldest son of the late Sultan of Johore, who had been kept out of his regular succession by the numerous sub-ordinate chiefs, who had seized the opportunity of his absence, at the time of his father's death, to establish themselves independent at his expense. He was now however acknowledged as the chief of Singapore, and with both these authorities the necessary treaties were made by us. Sir Stamford left Major Farquhar there as Resident, and the company of Sepoys he had taken with him, and returned here. His first care was to send a re-inforcement, to ensure the respectability of the station, and applied for the troops which this Government had promised to have in readiness whenever he should call for them. Would you believe that they actually refused them, in defiance of their own written promises, and the orders of the Governor General, and why, because they disapproved of the measures that had been taken, or in plain English, because it did not originate with themselves. There is good reason to believe that they have conveyed intimation of their hostile sentiments to the Dutch, in the hope of its exciting them to exert themselves against the settlement. I should hardly obtain credit for all the extraordinary steps they have taken to affect, if possible, the ruin of the finest settlement in the British possession.\n\nHappily however, they and the Dutch together, will only be able to create some petty obstructions, which a little time will entirely obviate. I hope too, their conduct will sooner or later meet with its due reward, and be exposed as it deserves, for it is impossible to conceive anything more disgraceful from first to last.\n\nOn the Island there is but one opinion, both of the Governor and the limb of Satan who guides him, and is the prime mover of all the iniquity and mischief of the place. A government must be bad indeed that cannot even command a voice among those most nearly connected with it, and dependent on it.\n\nEnough however on such a subject; I am tired of it, and I dare say so are you.\n\nMarch 25th.

I ought under all circumstances to be indifferent to it, as there was so little chance of my returning to take up the situation, but I know not how it comes, the news has actually annoyed me. I hate to be foiled in anything. I believe I should have cared less had any one else carried it against me, but to John Tytler, to such an Ursa Major, it is a little provoking to yield. I hope you have congratulated Major Hay on his acquisition; he seemed mightily afraid that Botany and duty would not go on well together, as if the important charge of him, his wife, and his Sepoys was enough to employ all the faculties of any single man. But let him and the bear rub on together as they may, be now Sumatra my field, and it shall go hard if it does not produce something.\n\nI told you in my last, of Sir Stamford\u2019s handsome proposal and my acceptance. There is a good beginning; I have much in prospect, which it is too soon yet to enter upon. Perhaps too, we may carry some of our further plans yet into effect. I am anxious to get to Bencoolen, to receive your letters, to be at the capital as it were, to see about me and form my plans, which in this unsettled kind of place I cannot so well do.\n\nI am preparing a large dispatch which I think will please you. I have been thinking that the most regular and methodical way would be, to send along with the specimens, a list containing such remarks on the plants as may be useful, which will be more convenient to you than having to refer to a desultory letter. It will also be easier for you to return me your remarks in the same manner, either on the same list, or if you prefer keeping it, on another similarly numbered. I would send you the list in duplicate to save you trouble, if I had anyone to write for me. I will also for the same reason, send you a list of the principal contents of the former dispatches, that we may go on regularly. I find I have several times numbered the same plant twice, when I did not happen to recollect whether I had before sent specimens. This is a mistake which can be easily rectified, and which you will readily excuse. I send many also without numbering, which I have not had time to examine particularly, but which are not the less worthy of being examined. For instance, there are a great number of *Ixora* here, which I have not attempted to ascertain, as I have not Roxburgh\u2019s descriptions. Have you got yet into Tetrandria in his printed Flora? What are the \u201cContributions\u201d doing? I shall ere long have plenty to contribute.\n\n78. His hopes of the post; see note No. 69.\n\n79.

Some of the things now sent, will I think be interesting.\n\nSir Stamford has not yet returned, but we are in hourly expectation of him. I think we shall leave this immediately on his return, and I shall not be sorry: new plants begin to get scarce, but on the whole I think the Island has not been unproductive. I have 130 descriptions so about 40 drawings &c; I shall have employment when I get to Bencoolen, in investigating these further than my present means of reference allow, and above all in comparing them with the information I expect from you.\n\nHave the goodness to remember me very kindly to Mrs. Wallich.\n\nDo you see my friend Lindsay81 occasionally? I must write him if possible before I leave this.\n\nBelieve me ever,\nMy dear Wallich,\nYours very affectionately,\nWilliam Jack.\n\nP.S. Write soon.\n\nPulu Penang\nMay 7th, 1819\n[Received June 23rd].\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nSir Stamford did not return from Acheen till the 29th ult. the business there having proved more difficult and tedious than was anticipated. It will take him some days longer to close the affair altogether, and then we shall bid adieu to this Island of delay and obstruction. You will I am sure be happy to learn, that the cause of honour and justice has been triumphant over that which was in every way the reverse. Every person here rejoices in the result, from regard to the British character, except the\n\n80. Jack's published writings contain only 54 descriptions of Penang plants.\n\n81. Who this Lindsay was, has not been ascertained. Dr. F. G. Gravely, Hon. Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, has been so good as to search his records in Calcutta, and does not find his name as a member.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nGovernor and his two coadjutors. Capt. Coombs, the 2nd Commissioner, one of these, made every possible effort to frustrate and defeat the objects of the Mission, but though he supported the opposite party with incredible obstinacy, he was no match for Sir Stamford\u2019s abilities and perseverance. The weight of evidence was such, that he was obliged to give way at last in every material point, and concur in the final resolution of supporting the old and legitimate Sovereign, with the influence of our alliance. A treaty has accordingly been concluded with him, on the usual terms of defensive alliance, but without pledging ourselves to any interference in the internal affairs of the country. The old King appears to be a very superior character, and to possess a much greater share of information than usual among natives. He speaks and writes English, and has some acquaintance with our literature and science, and what is better still, has a great deal of English honesty and plain dealing, no common qualification in this quarter of the world. The investigation has brought to light a great deal of iniquity upon the side so warmly espoused by this Government, and a sense of piracy and plunder on the coasts of Acheen, that is quite disgusting. This Government will use their utmost endeavours to overturn the arrangements, but I do not think it possible the Bengal Government can be so weak as to yield to their clamour. I should like to know the Calcutta opinion on all the affairs of this quarter. Never were there men whose conduct more deserved reprobation than the members of this Government, but it is not unlikely that their remoteness and the little interest excited by affairs in this quarter, will enable them to escape the odium their conduct would otherwise bring upon them.\n\nI now turn to more pleasing subjects. Capt. Fergusson of the Boyne, has agreed to take charge of a box of growing plants, and a parcel of specimens, which I hope will arrive safe. I am sure\n\n---\n\n82. Captain John Monckton Coombs was the second commissioner under Governor Bannerman. It seems that he owed the position to the interest of Governor Petrie, Colonel Bannerman\u2019s predecessor. He had been sent in 1818 to Acheen to enquire into the real state of affairs, having sailed on January 13th, from Penang and reached Acheen on the 17th. Unfortunately he did not understand the Acheenee language, nor did his official interpreter; so he \u201cpeacock-ed\u201d about, and thought that he had made an impression. Then he wrote a report which is contradictory in its statements but for the usurper wholly in its conclusions; and he proceeded direct to Bengal to give information there and receive orders. When he arrived, Lord Hastings was up country in Oondh; and it was some months before Coombs could get his ear, during which other reports had come from Acheen, not altogether in accord with the story as told by this \u201cspecial commissioner\u201d; and moreover Raffles was available for consultation. This fortunate delay led to Raffles and Coombs being sent back to make a new investigation jointly, in the course of which as Jack says Coombs had to give way on every material point. Raffles (vide Memoir, p. 397) says in other words that Coombs if opiniated was not dishonest over this affair.\n\nThe treaty made with the restored king carries both Raffles\u2019 and Coomb\u2019s signatures.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nhe will take the utmost care of them: you will find him a worthy excellent man, and of superior character. I have no doubt if his voyage lies in any direction you are interested in, he will attend to any wishes you may express.\n\nI hope the box of plants will please you; it contains a good many which I have never seen in flower, and can therefore say nothing about. Of those I know, you will be glad to have a healthy plant of *Tacca Rafflesiana*. I need not say take care of it: it is the only one I have met with. There are besides two species of *Arum*, one of *Calla*, a *Pinus*, and another nearly allied with distichous leaves, the *Pancratium amboinense*, several species of *Amomum*, an *Aerides*, and several other kinds of air plants, and plants of which the specimens are numbered 183-220-239. These I think are the chief contents, and most are at present vigorous.\n\nI also send a supplement to my last dispatch of specimens, containing many duplicates, and new ones down to 263 as per enclosed list. A few of these are from Aceh, brought by Sir Stamford, which I have not had time to look over. He brought very few, as they were but little on shore, and too busy to attend much to them. The principal known ones from thence are the splendid *Barringtonia speciosa*, the *Nymphaea cyanea*, Roxb., at least I take it to be so and several of which I have sent specimens from hence as *Volkameria*, *Calophyllum*, *Cardiospermum*, *Gmelina*.\n\nI send you a few seeds of the Pernambuco cotton, which I have mentioned to you: and a few other seeds. Among the plants lately found, of which the specimens are not dry, are the *Guettarda*.\n\n---\n\n83. *Tacca cristata*, see note No. 39.\n\n84. *Arum*. Unless there is some manuscript record of the fate of this at Calcutta, it is impossible to guess what it was, as botanists in the time of Jack put so many different Aroids under the genus Arum.\n\n85. *Calla humilis*, *Calla angustifolia*, and *Calla nitida* were all described by Jack from Penang. The first is *Homalonema humile*, Hook. f., the second *Homalonema angustifolium*, Hook. f., and the third *Aglaiomena oblongifolium*, Schott. The first two are plentiful in Penang.\n\n86. *Dacrydium elatum*, Wall. See note No. 101 in the next letter.\n\n87. *Podocarpus imbricatus*, Blume (P. cupressina.)\n\n88.

I trust ere this reaches you, the time for condolence will have passed, and will therefore forbear the subject, especially as I know how useless are words in those trials which are beyond our control, and for which there is no remedy but resignation.\n\nPresent my very best regards to Mrs. Wallich,\n\nand believe me\n\nto be most sincerely yours\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\nP.S. Excuse the haste apparent in the letter.\n\nPenang May 19th, 1819.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nI have a favor of a very unusual kind to ask you, of which a little explanation is necessary. I have given you some account of the Acheen affairs, and you know somewhat of its iniquities. The party have spared no means to carry their point; among other things a letter appeared in the Calcutta Journal, the writer of\n\n\\textsuperscript{92} There is considerable interest in this record of Guettarda speciosa, if from Penang. It is a common sea-shore tree and is known to occur in Kedah and on the inlands north of Penang, as well as on the coasts well to the south. But Curtis never found it in Penang, nor are there specimens in the Singapore Herbarium thence. Unfortunately there is evidence that Jack visited the Kedah coast, and no evidence here that Jack got the Guettarda on Penang island.\n\n\\textsuperscript{93} Ardisia umbellata, Roth, is A. humilis, Vahl, known to occur in Penang.\n\n\\textsuperscript{94} Sc\u00e6vola Taccada is S. Koenigii, Vahl, common on the coast of Penang.\n\n\\textsuperscript{95} Nymph\u00e6a stellata, Willd. is common in Penang now in ditches about rice fields, etc.; but may have been rare in Jack\u2019s time.\n\n\\textsuperscript{96} Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Lamk., is not recorded by Curtis as a plant of Penang, nor by anyone else: but there is one old specimen in the Singapore herbarium.\n\n\\textsuperscript{97} Rhizophora mucronata, Lamk., is not recorded by Curtis as a plant of Penang, nor by anyone else: but there is no unlikelihood of its occurrence. However we find it mentioned here along with several plants which may have been brought by Jack from the mainland.\n\n\\textsuperscript{98} Barringtonia racemosa, Roxb., is not recorded by Curtis as a plant of Penang; but a specimen from the islet of Pulau Tikus on the north coast is in the Singapore herbarium.\n\n\\textsuperscript{99} Apparently the death of an infant.\n\nR.

A wish was expressed that it should be met and answered, and I have undertaken it. I believe that Buckingham will have no objection to inserting a reply, and I shall be greatly obliged if you will undertake the task of getting him to do it. You may with perfect confidence assure him that every word in it may be depended on. Of course I do not wish to be known as the writer of it, but above all it must never be suspected that Sir S. had any knowledge of it. If Buckingham does not like, any of his rivals will be glad of it. Read it and let me know whether you think it intelligible. I do not think it possible that they can answer it. The writer of the letter is to a certainty Capt. Coombs, a man of whom I believe there is but one opinion, and that is such as need not be put on paper. You may easily believe that what I now send you is a job I would never readily undertake, but I believe you participate in the sentiment that has induced me on this occasion to travel so far out of my usual track. In fact, it is not possible to be an indifferent spectator of what is here passing, to refrain from admiration of the one, or for honest indignation at the others. It has hardly been possible for me to convey to you an idea of the contrast, the one is too disagreeable a subject to be dwelt on, and the other it is not easy to express without seeming partial. I know however what your own early impressions were on this subject, and need only say that every day's experience would have strengthened them.\n\nI have very little time for writing at present, so you will excuse a short letter. I expect to leave this in a few days more, which I shall do with less regret than any place I have ever been in.\n\nIf an answer to mine should ever appear, approve me.\n\nI dispatched to you a box of growing plants some time ago, by the Boyne, which I hope will have arrived in good condition. I have little to add at present on our own subject. I have however made a discovery of some importance, that what I sent you as a Pinus, is not a Pinus. I had long sought in vain for the cones, and at length procured some with a small berry, which proves it to be either a Taxus or Juniperus, I have not determined\n\n\\textsuperscript{100} Anderson in his book on \"Acheen\" already quoted, p. 134, says \"The papers in Calcutta now began to take up the subject of Acheen affairs very warmly, and the friends and supporters of both parties had an opportunity of conveying their opinions in the shape of extracts of private letters from Penang. Some of the letters addressed to the Calcutta Journal bear the stamp of having been written by the different organs of each party, if not by the Commissioners themselves. The style of the first so much resembles that of the paper of October, 1817, and the reports of the envoy, that if he did not write it himself, he must have entrusted it to a head and hand fully capable of catching at his precise ideas.\" Jack here says that Captain Coombs, i.e. the Envoy, \"certainly\" wrote it: and he reveals the fact that he wrote a reply.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwhich.\\textsuperscript{101} I enclose a sprig with one of these fruits. The cones I formerly found, belonged to the Pinus Dammara, which is abundant.\\textsuperscript{102}\n\nThis goes for the Bishop;\\textsuperscript{103} he has been with us once or twice, and has seen all that is going on in the various departments of Natural History, at which, between ourselves, he expressed nothing more than common vulgar wonder, and we certainly did give him enough for that, however as you will probably meet him at the Society, you will probably hear his account of Penang and its wonders. What attracted most his attention was two natives of the Andamans, who were brought here some time ago, whom he pronounced to be in the lowest state of civilization in which he had yet seen human nature, and certainly there could not well be conceived a greater contrast than was exhibited between the portly figure of the Bishop himself, and the two poor wretches he was examining. I should have liked to have asked him whether he really believed himself to have sprung from the same common stock with them; and whether Adam resembled these Aboriginees.\n\nI made a memorandum of the peculiarities of form of these men, which I will send you when I have time to copy it. The most striking peculiarity, is their diminutive stature, the taller of the two being 4 ft. 7 in.\n\nMy best regards to Mrs. Wallich, and believe me.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\n\\section*{SERIES 2\u2014SINGAPORE LETTERS.}\n\nSingapore, June 8th, 1819.\n\n[Received July 27th].\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nWe got clear of Penang on the 22nd ult., and arrived here on the 31st.

The place itself is advancing rapidly, and will soon become one of the most populous settlements to the Eastwards. The forests that now form my delight will gradually give place to man and his habitations, but they are more interesting to me in the present state. Flora here luxuriates in endless varieties, where she finds soil, climate and everything congenial.\n\nI find many, or most of my Penang acquaintances with others surpassing them in magnificence. Witness two most splendid species of *Nepenthes*,\\(^{105}\\) of which I have procured perfect specimens, male and female, and have completed two drawings, to which I flatter myself it will not be easy to bring a parallel. I am sure they will glad your eyes, when they shall be submitted to them.\n\nQuale portentum neque militaris  \n*Napalia* in latis alit esculetis,  \nNec Indiae tellus generat, *novarum*  \nStirpium nutrix.\n\nI have found here another specimen of the new *Tacca*,\\(^{106}\\) in fruit which I had not before seen. The Gambir, *Uncaria Gambir* is here extremely cultivated; I did not meet with a single plant of it at Penang. Among the new plants I have ascertained are the *Lythrum Pemphis*\\(^{107}\\) *Xyris indica*,\\(^{108}\\) a *Fagraea* which I think may be new,\\(^{109}\\) with large splendid flowers. It has led me to the discovery that No. 131 of your specimens, is the *Fagraea fragrans* of Roxburgh at least as far as I can decide from the abbreviated character, which is all I have. Pray is Roxburgh\u2019s *Ardisia umbellata* truly distinct from Swartz\u2019s *A. coriacea*?\\(^{2110}\\) I find here that\n\n\\(^{105}\\) *Nepenthes Rafflesiana*, and *N. ampullaria*\u2014both described by Jack, and the descriptions put into proof which was reprinted by Sir William Hooker in 1835 (vide note No. 51, p. 163).\n\n\\(^{106}\\) *Tacca cristata*, see note No. 39, p. 161.\n\n\\(^{107}\\) *Pemphis acidula*, Forst.,\u2014a rather rare plant on the coast of Singapore island.\n\n\\(^{108}\\) *Xyris indica*, Linn. is a weed of such places as rice-fields, and is found in the north of the Malay Peninsula down as far as Malacca. Through the Peninsula southwards to Singapore, occurs *X. anceps*, Lamk., and it is similar enough to be easily mistaken. Although we have reason to believe that there were rice-fields in Singapore previously, it is more likely that Jack named *X. anceps* as *X. indica*, than that *X. indica* has been lost through the abandonment of the cultivation for rice.\n\n\\(^{109}\\) Doubtless *Fagraea auriculata*, Jack, the description of which appeared in the Malayan Miscellanies, ii. (1822) p. 82.\n\nThere are in Wallich\u2019s beautiful *Planta Asiatica Rariores*, certain plates, that of *Fagraea auriculata* being one, bearing no artist\u2019s name: and in several cases the reason is to be traced to the circumstance that a friend of Wallich had supplied the plate. The plate of *Jackia ornata* is in the same category. It may be suggested from this, but unfortunately without proof, that Jack had supplied the drawings for these two plates, unsigned, so that the published illustrations passed out from the press without a name on them.\n\n\\(^{110}\\) Apparently distinct. *Ardisia umbellata*, Roth, is *A. humilis* Vahl. See note 93.\nthe umbels are often disposed in terminal panicles as well as axillary. I have ascertained another point, which it may be worth while to attend to when you come so far in printing Roxb.'s Flora, which is that Cordia campanulata R. is the same with C. subcordata Lamarck.\\textsuperscript{111}\n\nI am afraid the Singapore specimens will scarcely be dry enough for transmission: however I shall send a few that I think will bear it, and you shall have further dispatches from Bencoolen, which I am now very anxious to reach. I shall not be surprised if this should in time become our head-quarters, and by all accounts it will be much preferable to Bencoolen, which is sadly out of the way.\n\nI send this by Dr. Smith of the 20th N.I.\u2014and regret that I have not more to send by so good an opportunity. However I shall have another soon after I arrive at Bencoolen, when I will begin to get things in order, which I cannot do in the way we are living here.\n\nJune 15th.\u2014I am in hopes we shall not be detained here much longer. I send half a dozen specimens, just to show that I am doing something. There is one very beautiful species of Loranthus among them.\\textsuperscript{112} Pray is the tree I sent you from Penang as a Pinus, and afterwards discovered not to be so, the Juniperus elata, Roxb.\\textsuperscript{2113} the name and nativity render it highly probable.\n\nThe beautiful white-fruited shrub\\textsuperscript{114} No. 183 of your specimens is very abundant here, as also a second and smaller species of the same genus, with red fruit.\\textsuperscript{115} I suspect it to be a new genus, what think you? The generic character will be as follows:\u2014Calyx inferus, 5-phyllus parens. Corolla (alba) 5-petala, petalis reflexopatentibus calyce duplo longioribus. Stamina 5 hypogyna. Filamenta brevissima. Anther\u00e6 long\u00e6 in conum commiventes, apice acuminat\u00e6 poro dehiscentes. Stylus longitudine staminum. Bacca supera, 5-sperma vel 5 pyrena, seminibus arillatis, arillo fibroso, embryone inverso cylindrico, longitudine seminis, albumine incluso. Folia pulcherrima striata nervis transversis parallelis. In some specimens there were five yellow filaments like abortive anthers alternating with the true stamina, but they were not constant.\n\n\\textsuperscript{111} Later botanists have confirmed this.\n\n\\textsuperscript{112} Loranthus coecineus, Jack, apparently. It was described by him in the Malayan Miscellanies, i.

Germen pedicellate, pedicel of the length of the calyx and concrete with it. Style as long as stamens. Legume large, flat, few-seeded. Flowers in terminal corymbs. Leaves pinnate with two pairs without an odd one. Folioles subrotund marginate.\n\nI have a favor to ask of Mrs. Wallich which I hope she will be able to grant without much trouble. I have promised to procure for Lady Raffles a copy of the music of the Persian air \u201cTareh ba tareh\u201d I believe Mrs. Wallich plays it. And if she would be so good as to take the trouble to copy it I will be greatly obliged. Perhaps she would increase the favor by adding any other good Hindostane Airs.\n\nLady R. is a superlative performer, and I should like to hear some of these tunes with the advantage of her execution.\n\nBoth Sir S. and Lady R. frequently desire to be remembered to you, oftener than I remember to record it, so you must always take it for granted to be understood if not expressed in like manner as the affectionate regard with which I am always, My dear Wallich.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\nP.S. I have written up the country to order down some things I left behind me, to your address and care. I will be much obliged if you will take the trouble to receive and forward them.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nSingapore, June 18th, 1819.\n\nSince I closed my letter I have got one of Thetis\u2019s drinking cups to send you, a huge crateriform Spongoid Zoophyte. They have been brought of various sizes, some larger than the present one. If it should not particularly interest you, perhaps Col. Hardwicke would like it,\\textsuperscript{118} and as I have not yet sent him anything it will just serve to show that I am not quite unmindful. I have found it convenient to occupy myself very little with Zoology, as it seems to be expected that every thing in that department should go to the Frenchmen, and I perceive a kind of jealous feeling on their part. I shall probability be more at liberty when I get to Bencoolen. They have been very industrious, but I shall take another opportunity of telling you more about them. You know them pretty well.

Bencoolen,\n\nAug. 19th, 1819.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nAt length after all my wanderings here I am at the ultima Thule, and indeed it seems to deserve the appellation well enough, for it is grievously out of the way. Of your letters I have received those of the 18th Feb., of the 10th of April, of the 27th and a note of the 14th June, but several alluded to, particularly per \u201cTagus,\u201d and \u201cIsabella Robertson\u201d are yet to make their appearance. I have further received from Mr. Halked the writer\u2019s labours down to Polygonum,\\(^{119}\\) and (mihi gratissima) two vols. of Enc. Botanique\\(^{120}\\) for all which, my best thanks. I am most anxious to receive your other dispatches, which I hope will not be long delayed. As they seem to be a little irregular in their transit, it might be a good plan, and save also a little valuable ink and paper, to number our letters, by which means it will be easy to know whether they all arrive safely without constant quotation. To commence therefore I mark this No. 9, which appears by my D\u00e2k Book\\(^{121}\\) to be the number already sent from Penang and Singapore, exclusive of parcels etc. I need not trouble you with much account of my voyage which was long and tedious. We left Singapore on the 28th of June, and two days after got aground on a shoal in the Straits of Rhio, where we were obliged to start all our water overboard before we got off again. This obliged us to run into the Dutch Port of Rhio, and gave me an opportunity of landing and seeing it. It is a paltry miserable place since the Dutch took possession of it. The only new thing I found there was the *Hypericum alternifolium*, Vahl.\\(^{122}\\) From there we pro-\n\n---\n\n\\(^{119}\\) This remark shows that Jack was employing a writer (clerk) under Wallich\u2019s supervision to make for him a copy of Roxburgh\u2019s *Flora indica*. See note 37.\n\n\\(^{120}\\) *Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique*. The botanical part by Lamarek, continued by Poiret, Paris, 1783-1817.\n\n\\(^{121}\\) Post despatch book. This is the eighth preserved letter.\n\n\\(^{122}\\) *Archyt\u00e6a Vahlii*, Choisy. Wallich distributed specimens of this plant collected by Jack labelled Penang, under his number 4806: and because the plant is found at Batu Feringhi in the island of Penang, the locality has never been questioned. But we find Jack stating here that *A. Vahlii* was a new thing to him; and so well did he know his plants that it is impossible to think that he overlooked getting it in Penang if it were so. He got it at Rhio.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nceeded to the Straits of Banca, where our progress was very slow, the monsoon being against us. I had not once an opportunity of landing again till we arrived here, although we were always in sight of and often very near the land. From the Straits of Sunda our passage was good, the same wind which had before opposed us, being then in our favour. The track we pursued was a very unusual one at this season, and one that many people would have pronounced impracticable. I have been as you may suppose, very busy since I arrived, and am hardly yet quite settled and got into regular train. Unfortunately I was far from well during the latter part of the voyage and for a fortnight after my arrival, which rather retarded my labours. I have not yet got through the arrangement of the piles of specimens I brought with me. I am very anxious to have your letters with observations on the specimens sent you. Those I have already received are invaluable, and have given me much new light on several points, on which I shall enter presently. A new field seems to open here, for of all that has yet been brought in, very few indeed are acquaintances.\n\nOptime amice mithi, what do you think of specimens of the flowers of the Camphor,\\(^{123}\\) from which I have made an excellent drawing? Is not that an admirable beginning?! It belongs to *Monadelphia polyandra*: calyce 5-partito: cor. 5-petala: ovario triloculare 6-sporo, stylo filiformi stam. longiore: antherae longae circa stylum conniventes.\n\nAs there is not at present any direct opportunity to Bengal, (this goes via Penang) I cannot send any parcels, but I cannot deny myself the pleasure of enclosing a sprig of that great desideratum, which has so long bloomed in vain and \u201cwasted its fragrance on the desert air.\u201d\n\nBy the bye I should have mentioned that the box of paper and wax cloth is as good as arrived, for though not yet in my possession Capt. Bowman has told me of it, and promises to land it in a day or two. You mention that it is blotting paper, I am sorry therefore, as I prefer the country paper, on a comparative trial of the two; I ought to have mentioned this to you before, and do it now for your information in future. The dry coarse rather stiff paper appears to answer best, such as, what I shall make the cover of this letter of. Allow me to make my acknowledgements for your and Mrs. Wallich\u2019s kindness in so readily agreeing to incur the\n\n\\(^{123}\\). On page 149 of Marsden\u2019s *History of Sumatra* (third edition, London, 1811), there is given the then-existing information in regard to the Malayan Camphor-tree. The leaf is described and the habit of the tree: Gaertner\u2019s figure of the fruit, and an engraving of the foliage made for Lambert are referred to: but the flower had \u201cnot yet been brought to England.\u201d In the twelfth volume of the *Asiatick Researches* Colebrooke described the fruit, together with an excellent figure of leaves, fruit and seed (1816, p. 539 and appendix p. 3).\n\nWith attention directed to the need, in 1819 Mr. Prince, whose name occurs in these letters, sent flowers to Raffles from Tappanouly.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ntrouble of my commissions, of which I shall now avail myself without mercy.\n\nYou will by this have considerably exceeded the amount of my former remittance, therefore I now enclose a draft on the Treasury for Sa R 300. On receiving the cash will you be good enough to desire Messrs. Gibson & Co, Tailors, to send you a small bill which I owe them for a suit of clothes which I had just before leaving Calcutta, and at same time order a genteeel blue coat, of no nonsensical dandy fashion, but such as a gentleman may put on? Pray send it at convenient opportunity, together with the books and atlas, which you were so good as to take charge of. As I may consider myself fixed here for some time, I may as well collect my rattle traps about me.\n\nPray is any acknowledgement of the honour necessary to the Asiatic Society to which your good offices have procured me admission. I find from my account \"Curr.\" that Mr. Calder has done the needful in regard to payment which I suppose is the most essential part of the acknowledgement. Now in regard to your wish for a paper, pray tell me when they are likely to bring forth a vol.124 Something or other they must have, but what, may be regulated by the probable delays. If they are not likely to publish soon, something of minor interest will do, for instance elucidations of some imperfectly known Rumphian or Malay trees and fruits, as the Bachang, Rambutan, Rambeh, etc. etc. A perfect Clavis Rumphianus is rather a desideratum. Do you know anything of the Rasamala of Rumpf?125 His description makes it a Pinus. Here they have a Rasamala, which is different and is more like a Guttifera. There are here a great many kinds of wild nutmegs, which will be interesting and which I must investigate. I think I mentioned to you at Penang my having observed the true Nutmeg to be polygamus. I find the observation confirmed here, in so much that the planters trouble themselves\n\n---\n\n124. The Asiatic Society produced the thirteenth volume of the Asiatick Researches in 1820, and the fourteenth in 1822: but Jack was not among the contributors. The fifteenth volume appeared in 1825. In a later letter he writes to Wallich \"I think you told me that there were two volumes in hand or in the press.\" Possibly he thought the manuscript closed, which cannot have been the case as Hardwicke's paper on the Singapore zoophyte went into the fourteenth.\n\n125. Rasamala to Rumpf was a wood\u2014\"Caju Rasamala\"\u2014which was brought to Amboyna from New Guinea, from a country of barbarians, and its origin was only to be investigated by hearsay. At a much later date, the botanists who worked in Java, e.g. Blume who was Jack's contemporary, Noronha, Hasskarl, and Junghuhn, showed that one kind of Rasamala is the resin of the forest-tree, Altinigia excelsa, Noronha,\u2014not one of the Guttiferae as Jack suggests, but of the Hamamelidaceae. However apparently not all rasamala is from this tree. Rasamala in commerce has been much confused with Rosanallas or Liquid storax from the Levant.\n\nR. A.

October.\n\nper Geo. Cruttenden].\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nA second opportunity offers of writing to you via Madras, of which I avail myself to forward the duplicate of the Draft contained in my last. I also sent you a few flowers of the Camphor tree of Sumatra, which I am sure will delight you. I have found means to send to Tappanooly for further and ample supplies, together with whatever other interesting plants can be procured. This month has been the feast of *Puassir* among the natives during which no business of any kind is done. In a few days more it will be at an end, and all the chiefs come in a body to pay their compliments to the Govr., after which business returns to its old train. We have formed extensive plans for obtaining the productions of all parts of the country which will then be commenced, and mean to have occasionally councils of the chiefs for the purpose of inquiries into all subjects of Natural History, on which information can be obtained from them.\n\nI have taken a look over Sir Stamford's specimens of plants found on the Menang Kaboo trip, almost all of which are new to me, and they have very much of an Alpine character. I observed among them, a *Rhopala*, perhaps the *serrata*, and two\n\n---\n\n133. Yes.\n\n134. Certainly *Memecylon coerulcum*, which Jack described in the *Malayan Miscellanies*, i. (1820) No. 5 p. 26.\n\n135. Raffles had left Bencoolen early in July, 1818, for Padang; and from there had marched into the interior, starting on September 16th. The naturalist Thomas Horsfield was of the party and went ahead carried on the shoulders of four men in order that by arriving at the camping places early he might gain time for botanising. The journey lasted fourteen days, and covered 250 miles (vide *Memoir of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles* first edition, pp. 314-368, or second edition, i. pp. 388-434).\n\n136. *Helicia serrata*, Blume, which may occur in the mountains behind Bencoolen.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73. 1916.\nnew *Sonerila*. I find here a species of *Nepenthes* different from all the Singapore ones, and evidently the *N. phyllamphora*, Lour., which is also the *cantharifera*, Rumph., differing from the *N. distillatoria* in having petiolate leaves, urns ventricose at the lower part, and the striated margin depressed or flattened. Sir Stamford proposes that we should send the Nepenthes with a few more of the most interesting of our discoveries home to be published in a small fascicle, in the most splendid style that they can be executed in, colored figures of the full natural size. I think it would be a good thing to attract attention to the subject. It may or may not be continued, according to circumstances. Give me your idea on the subject. You know that Sir S. has brought a printing press with him; he proposes keeping it constantly employed in printing papers on Natural History, and on a variety of other subjects of local information. He has himself a mass of papers on the Eastern Islands, which in their present MSS. form, are but little available, and of course liable to accidents and destruction; these he proposes printing, in order to preserve them and to afford the means of distributing them to a certain extent. He proposes to go on for some time printing without publishing, but after a little to make selections from among the materials thus collected, of which to form a volume which may be published quarterly or as matter sufficient may accumulate. In this way a great deal will be preserved of considerable interest; but perhaps not finished enough for the established channels of information as the Asiatic Researches &c. For instance we think of printing descriptions of plants, whether new or not, which can then be distributed to a few, better than in MSS. I would send to you, Mr. Brown &c. for your observations, after which what was really valuable might be made public or not, and in such way or channel as would appear afterwards eligible. By the bye, in what state are the vols. of the Asiatic Society, is there any likely soon to appear? Sir S.\n\n137. These Sonerilas were not described by Jack.\n\n138. *Nepenthes phyllamphora*, Willd., was described in print by Jack in proofsheets for the Malayan Miscellanies which were reprinted in Hooker\u2019s Companion to the Botanical magazine i. (1835) p. 271 with the remark \u201cabundant in moist places and ravines in the neighbourhood of Bencoolen.\u201d Later botanists have collected it on the same coasts.\n\n139. Rajendra Lala Mitra in his part of the Centennial Review of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1883) p. 50, referring to the Asiatick Researches says \u201ca heavy quarto volume necessarily suggested elaborate and finished essays, and in the selection of papers for it, short notes describing new discoveries or new ideas, however interesting were frequently rejected.\u201d And he continues by recording that many members of the Society were dissatisfied at the slowness of publication and its insufficiency. A motion was even brought forward for improvement but though it passed, it effected little.\n\nPossibly, had the Society felt itself able to provide the outlet, its prestige being so great, Wilson\u2019s Quarterly Oriental Journal, the Transactions of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta, and the Malayan Miscellanies would not have sprang up as small octavos for notes rather than essays, and for early publication.\n\n140. See note 124 on p. 183.\nsays he would wish to go hand in hand with it, if the delays are not too great. I think you told me there were two vols. in hand or in the press: are they filled up, and when is another likely to come forth? There are description of some animals, for instance the Dugong, which would be worthy of a place there. Diard told Sir S. that he heard that a description of the Tapir of Malacca from Major Farquhar was to appear in one of the present vols.\\textsuperscript{141} That description is not only imperfect but inaccurate, and as we have a better account of the same animal belonging to Sumatra, it would be a pity that a less accurate paper should occupy the pages of the Asiatic Researches. Sir S. I believe would be glad to know how the case actually stands, and whether the Secretary would like to insert his account in preference. He will probably write on this subject to you or Mr. Wilson.\\textsuperscript{142}\n\nIt is intended also to have all the Frenchmen's descriptions of animals &c. printed, in order to prevent being inundated with \\ldots\\ldots\\ldots flummery. I believe, they are to be engaged to put them all into latin, by which they will become, not only more concise, but more generally available. I have said very little to you, I believe, about the Frenchmen, and as they are good friends of yours, you will perhaps wish to know something about them, the estimation in which they stand, and what they are doing. Between ourselves then, I believe they are estimated \"a peu pr\u00e8s a leur propre valeur\" and you know pretty well what that amounts to. They have been the source of not a little amusement to us during our voyages, when there was not much to occupy us.\\ldots\\ldots\n\nYou may easily conceive \\ldots\\ldots\\ldots\\ldots how they fared \\ldots\\ldots\\ldots against a long head like Sir S., and a hard one like Crossly, who to good abilities joins a bluntness more than usual even among Englishmen. I must however give them a great deal of credit of having preserved a good deal of temper throughout, probably they knew well enough that the contrary would be to no purpose. In regard to their labours, they have unquestionably been very industrious in making their collections, nor do they spare their personal fatigue. The number of birds and animals that they have prepared is very great.\u2014I must let you know the footing on which Sir S. supports them, which will explain to you the reasons for my taking no part in the Zoological affairs.\n\nI believe his plan is to employ them in making the collections on the public account, that is to say, that they engage to give the whole fruits of their labours without reservation to be at Sir S's. disposal, in return for which he is to defray their expenses. They are glad to make this bargain, as their own funds\n\n\\textsuperscript{141} This appeared in the \\textit{Asiatick Researches}, XIII, 1820, p. 417.\n\n\\textsuperscript{142} Dr. Horace Hayman Wilson (1784-1860), Secretary of the Asiatic Society 1815-1832, the Sanskrit Scholar, and historian.\nwere nearly exhausted in Bengal without having done much, and the credit of the collection they now make, will of course be theirs, though the property of it be British. This I believe from some private conversation I had with Sir S. on the subject of deriving the most advantage from their labours, to be nearly his plan, and certainly they may be very useful, as the subjects are by no means such as are generally cultivated, particularly in this country. They also regard less than most people the trifling inconveniences of bad smells, putrescence &c. &c. and are therefore well fitted for anatomists. What I have now mentioned, as I have not heard Sir S. speak openly on the subject, is of course private between us. It will explain however, why I do not like to make any private collection for myself, or to do anything that could look like interfering, especially as they might feel a kind of jealousy, and I do not suppose they entertain any affection for me; that of course I care very little about, and they are liberal enough of politesses, but as Sir S. evidently endeavours to keep them in good humour by little attentions, I do the same, or at least nothing to the contrary. If I wished anything, particularly anything of that description, I would ask Sir S. for it. You see therefore it will be very little in my power to send to Col. Hardwicke, as he is himself a correspondent of Sir S. who will probably send from himself. If I should ever be separate, the case would alter.\n\nA species of *Quercus* was brought in to me a day or two ago. Nat. name Punning. Roxb. I see has several Penangian. I have been thinking how it would do to employ a man with you to sketch off rapidly on thin paper, the outlines of such of Roxb.'s drawn species as I am likely to meet with here, which would be of considerable use to me and would there be any objection to such copies being taken? yes, one suggests itself this moment, the putting the vols. in the hands of natives to finger, by which they have already suffered; however you will judge, and whether it would be worth the trouble. I have found also the *Cesalpinia? sumatrana* Roxb., and the *Brucea sumatrana*, the latter figured in Rumph.\n\n---\n\n143. Apparently *Quercus racemosa*, Jack, in *Malayan Miscellanies*, ii. (1822), No. 7, p. 86, which is found to be the same as *Quercus spicata*, Smith (Pasanja spicata, Oerst.) a widely distributed species.\n\n144. Roxburgh had described in MS. *Cesalpinia sumatrana* from a plant introduced into the Calcutta gardens from Sumatra. It is found to be a *Mesoneuron* and becomes *M. sumatranum*, W. & A. It has been collected since Jack's time on the Bencoolen coast.\n\n145. *Brucea sumatrana*, Roxb., had been introduced into the Calcutta Gardens similarly and described by Roxburgh, in the manuscript of his *Flora indica*. It is a common Malayan plant recorded for the Bencoolen coast in other places than this. One interest which attaches to it, is that Wallich collected it in Singapore island, where it had ceased to grow towards the end of the last century, probably in consequence of clearing (vide Ridley in the *Agricultural Bulletin of the Straits and Federated Malay States*, i, 1902, p. 343).\nI have met with a great misfortune, in losing the services of my watch; it got a fall which has I believe dislocated the balance wheel. I am the more annoyed as it cannot be repaired here, and I have a value for it. I will send it up to you, and will you have the kindness to send it to the best watch-maker in Calcutta to be repaired. I know not whether I shall be able to send you anything by this occasion, but will if I can, and if not per next.\n\nMy best regards to Mrs. Wallich, and Believe me.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nThine ever,\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\nBencoolen,\nSept. 1st, 1819.\n\n[Received Oct. 23rd].\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nThe vessel has not sailed so soon as was expected, which gives me the opportunity of giving you a supplement to my last, and adding a small sample of Sumatran novelties. I have not yet got into the thick of them, to use a vulgar phrase, not however from idleness, for I have been bringing up a good deal of arrears; among these there are some things worth giving you. The specimen No. 5 I have now ascertained to be as I supposed Roxb.'s *Grewia paniculata*,\\(^{146}\\) which however is superseded by *Microcos tomentosa* of Sir J. E. Smith, Rees' *Cyclop. in loco*, which agrees most exactly. It is singular to find it so well described from a specimen, which he says was imperfect and without even an indication of its native country. I perceive that Sir J. E. has availed himself of specimens brought home by Mr. C. Smith,\\(^{147}\\) who will have anticipated me in many things. I have further been investigating the *Kamooning*,\\(^{148}\\) concerning which there has been sad confusion which I think I can now clear up, being acquainted now with the three of Rumpf.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{146}\\) Jack's No. 5 would probably be a Penang plant. *Grewia paniculata*, Roxb., occurs there.\n\n\\(^{147}\\) Christopher Smith, was sent to Tahiti in H. M. S. Providence in 1791, then as botanist to the Honourable East India Company to the Moluccas (see note No. 1), and about 1805 was made Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens there; but he died in Penang either in the next year, or immediately afterwards. His drawings and specimens may be found in the British Museum of Natural History, South Kensington.\n\n\\(^{148}\\) Jack wrote in the *Malayan Miscellanies*, i. (1820) p. 31, an account of the Kamuning. Rumpf as Jack says had figured three plants, first what he calls Camunium or Camuneng, which is the *Chalcaea paniculata* of Loureiro, and the *Murraya paniculata* of Jack, and *Murraya exotica* (2) the camunium sinense, which is *Aglaia odorata* of Loureiro, and (3) the camunium japonense which is again *Murraya exotica*. Jack here explains to Wallich that the first is the true Kamuning; and in his note he calls it *Murraya paniculata*; the second is *Aglaia odorata*, and the third is to be distinguished from the first as *Murraya exotica*. Unfortunately for Jack's conclusions we have come back to Lamarck's position that the Camunium of Rumpf and his Camunium japonense are both *Murraya exotica*.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nThe two figured in plate 18 vol. 5, are plain enough and well known, fig. 1, the *Camunium Chinense*, Roxb. quite distinct from the others, fig. 2, the *Murraya exotica*. All the confusion has been with reference to the true Kamooning, t. 17, which has most unaccountably by Lamarek and others been supposed the same with *Murraya*, in the face of Rumphius's figure and of Loureiro's description, who distinguishes the two very well. I am not pleased with any of the names they have borne. *Murraya exotica* is an absurd appellation, and *Chalca paniculata* is a false name as it happens not to be panicled, which is abundantly evident from the fig. of Rumphius. They belong to the same genus, and are distinguished by the one being a tree, furnishing the wood most highly valued by the Malays for making the handles of Kreeses, having ovate acuminate leaves, and the flowers 1-3 from the axils of the superior leaves. The other the *exotica* having blunt thick leaves and panicled flowers (ni fallor) and not exceeding a shrub. I suspect Loureiro's other distinction of *Bacca* 2 and 1-sperma will not be found sufficiently constant.\n\nWhat is known about the two species of Sagus put down in the garden, viz. *inermis* and *spinoso*? Had Roxb. any description of them, and what is the *S. Rumphi* in the appendix? Sir J. E. Smith does not attempt to clear up the matter. Do you know what Rottboll says of them? he is quoted in the *Act. Dan.* I think I have two of Rumph's species, the one armed the other unarmed. I have the fruit only of the latter but both are planted here. The specimen 213 is I find, the *Aegiceras fragrans* Konig. *Am. Bot.*, and figured in Rheede vol. 6. How could it possibly have ever been placed under *Rhizophora*? I see Roxburgh calls *Volkameria inermis* Linn. *Clerodendron littoreum*; is that sanctioned by any other authority? it is a much better name than *inermis*, and I feel much inclined to adopt it; I think two species have been confounded under it, specimens of which have been sent you, one, 204, *fol. ovatis, pedunc. avillar. trichotomis*. The other *fol. lanceolatis, ped. axill. trifloris*.\n\nMr. Nicolson, a gentleman who has purchased a nutmeg plantation here, goes up by this opportunity. I have therefore requested him to take charge of the few specimens I have ready, and\n\n---\n\n149. It is thought that Roxburgh had only got races or conditions of the common Sago palm which he distinguished under these two names. *S. Rumphi* which is named next is according to some the Sago palm of Eastern Malaya: but others do not distinguish it from the Western or common Sago palm.\n\n150. *Aegiceras fragrans* is *A. majus*, Gaertn., a common coast plant of Malaya. The number indicates that it was obtained by Jack in Penang, where it is common.\n\n151. Some regard these as varieties of *Clerodendron inerme*, Benth. whereunder is then included *C. neriiifolium*, Wall.: others separate them. Rumpf had *C. neriiifolium* as *Jasminum littoreum*, whence Roxburgh's *Clerodendron littoreum*.\n\nJour.

I thought at first he would be rather an acquisition to the place, but he has shown a bad litigious spirit, which has made me less satisfied with him. He has a pushing insinuating manner; should you see him and he tell you any long stories about Bencoolen and the favor he stands in, you will know the degree of credit to attach to them.

Bannerman, so that I think that there can be little doubt of his embracing this unlooked for opportunity of carrying it into effect;\\textsuperscript{159} I shall rejoice at it on Sir Stamford\u2019s account, though I confess after so much moving about as we have had lately, I would rather remain quietly here for some time, especially as I have so much in hand. Sir S. himself would like to remain here too for some time: however we must take things as they come.\n\nI am extremely busy at present. I was in hopes ere this to have had some printed sheets of descriptions to send you, but Mr. Ward\\textsuperscript{160} is so slow and dilatory, that I fear he will be of little use to us. A first paper (not mine) which was given him on trial, has not been got out of his hands yet. My botanical time is a\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textsuperscript{156} Colonel Bannerman.\n\\item \\textsuperscript{157} The Honourable W. E. Phillips for a long time a servant of the East India Company in Penang, acted as Governor thrice before Colonel Bannerman came out, and became confirmed as Governor in 1819. He lived in great state having a park full of deer round his residence, and was most hospitable. He did not die of cholera in this year: so, either Jack\u2019s information was wrong, or we must look for another Phillips. The first alternative is more than probable.\n\nSucceeding to the Governorship, W. E. Phillips by his prompt and firm action in the end of 1819, snuffed out a renewed attempt on the part of Saif-ul-alam to disturb the peace, at the time when Raffles was in Calcutta, on his very mission for the subordination of the Penang Governorship: and which it seems, he undertook thinking this apparently capable officer dead.\n\n\\item \\textsuperscript{158} Whoever was dead, it further was not Captain Coombs for he remained in Penang after this date, and died much later in Scotland.\n\n\\item \\textsuperscript{159} After the receipt of this news Raffles proceeded to Calcutta to urge personally the amalgamation of the Straits Settlements into one government as already half-promised (vide Memoir of Sir Stamford Raffles, p. 396). He arrived there on or about November 12th, 1819, taking Jack with him, and Jack taking his collections. In Calcutta, Raffles became ill; and the stay was prolonged, giving Jack facilities for working over his plants with Wallich. Because of this interruption of the correspondence by personal contact, it has been thought best to divide the Bencoolen letters at this break into two series.\n\n\\item \\textsuperscript{160} The Rev. N. M. Ward, one of Raffles\u2019 missionaries, doubtless the one mentioned by him in his letter to the Duchess of Somerset already quoted p. 147. He subsequently penetrated into the interior of Sumatra. Was it not he who in 1815 was with Carey and Marshman at Serampore? (Vide Private Journal of the Marquess of Hastings, (London 1858, ii. p. 93). Jack did not think much of him.\n\\end{itemize}\nlittle diminished at present, by Sir S. having put me on a committee\\textsuperscript{161} to inquire into the state of society among the natives under this establishment; a tremendous subject, and unfortunately the greater part of the burden of it falls on me.\n\nThe marine plant\\textsuperscript{162} No. 271 which I sent you in my last dispatch, I again found on the Coral Reefs at Rat Island, and having got better specimens, discover that is the \\textit{Stratiotes acoroides}, figured in one of the last vols. of Rumphius. Have you any idea what the plant is that is figured in Rumph. vol. 3, t. 26, and very well described at page 47, by the name of \\textit{Lignum Emanum}? I do not find it quoted anywhere, and am extremely puzzled what to make of it: can it have any relationship to \\textit{Taxus}? I found the plant at Singapore, and am not sure whether you have had specimens of it: in case you should not I enclose one in this.\\textsuperscript{163} If it has separate male flowers, I have never met with them, and Rumph. seems to have been equally ignorant of them.\n\nI have again met with the Sago, in still more perfect condition, and hope soon to be able to give you a full account of it. I find that it is absolutely hermaphrodite; it seems to be Rumphius's \\textit{Sagus lavris}. There is also here a spinous species, whose fruit I have not yet procured.\\textsuperscript{164}\n\nThe \\textit{Morinda} with umbellate flowers (spec. 77)\\textsuperscript{165} which you in one of your letters observe to be new, seems to agree very exactly with the Pada-vara, Rheed. H. Mal. 7 p. 51, t. 27, and as it does not appear that the said figure has ever been quoted, I think there can be little question of its novelty. If it is to remain a \\textit{Morinda}, it may be called \\textit{M. tetrandra} \"pedunculis umbellatis terminalibus, corollis 4-fidis, intus hirsutis, foliis lanceolatis.\"\n\n---\n\n\\textsuperscript{161} Raffles thus writes to William Wilberforce under the date of September 1819. \"In our chaplain, the Rev. Charles Winter, I found every disposition to extend the sphere of usefulness, and by associating him in a Committee of gentlemen....... I found the means of effective superintendence. The enclosed printed copy of the proceedings of this committee will place you in full possession of the principles in which we have proceeded, and of the particulars of what has been done towards the establishment of schools at Bencoolen. In the last report of the Committee with which this paper concludes, you will perceive some interesting observation on the condition of society, the character and usages of the people, and the facilities generally extending the plan of educating the whole of the native population\" (\\textit{Memoir of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles}, p. 47). And again (on p. 49), \"I am in a particular manner indebted to a member of my family, Mr. Jack, for the ardour and ability which he has infused into the researches of the Committee.\"\n\n\\textsuperscript{162} \\textit{Enhalus Koenigii}, Rich.

It may be called *M. polysperma*\\(^{166}\\) and characterised as follows, \"tetrandra, pedunculis axillaribus et terminalibus, corollis 4-fidis intus hirsutis, foliis ovatis acuminatis, baccis bilocularibus polyspermis!\u201d. Both these species are very like each other in appearance and general habit; their flowers agree, but the fruit is quite inexplicable. They must I think come into one genus, the alliance is so close, but whether they can unite with *Morinda* is another question, what think you?. My spec. of this last have almost gone to wreck, and I only got one or two; I must however send you a leaf and fruit, that your eyes may be convinced.\n\nI look very impatiently for the letters of yours still due, which have not made their appearance. I am at this moment plagued with a sharp attack of rheumatism, consequent on a slight touch of fever I got by a trip in the sun. It comes very mal a propos, for I really have not time to attend to it, although it actually lames me, and utterly banishes Mr. Somnus.

There and particularly about Hog Island, we were delayed by calms. We reached Tappanooly on the 23rd and left it again\n\n\\(^{166}\\) *Lucinaa Morinda*, DC. which Jack described as *Morinda polysperma* in the Malayan Miscellanies, i. part 5, (1820) p. 14.\nyesterday.\\textsuperscript{167} If I had anticipated so long a passage, during which I have had very little to do, I would have carried down with me a part of the specimens to work at on the way. One mischanter befell me, the box which contained my description book happened to be in a cabin below, which was set afloat one night by a sea through an open port, and it got most thoroughly and completely soaked; I have been obliged to make a copy of the greater part of it, but one good effect has resulted, that in doing so I have perfected the descriptions and put them in shape to be immediately printed, and shall commence thereon as soon as I arrive at Ben-coolen.\\textsuperscript{168} I hope when I arrive there I shall receive letters from you by the Coromandel, which will probably arrive almost as soon as we ourselves; and also by Watson. I hope in dispatching the specimens, you have taken care to preserve for yourself a complete set. We may wish to refer to some of them. I wish we had not done away with the arrangement, of those of which there were duplicates from those which are the only specimens, which is the case with a great many, and certainly with all of which you had not previously received specimens. There were several of these that I should have liked to have ascertained and made descriptions of along with you. You will however distinguish in going over them, as well as I could, such as are of interest, and when necessary we can refer to them afterwards. I shall be anxious to hear what discoveries you make among them. There are several particular points and queries I want from you; the best way will be to put them down in order, that you may have them before you at once, and comply with them when convenient and at leisure. In the first place I wish to have copies of the descriptions you made of several plants, some before, and some as we went along. These are principally your descriptions of:\n\n1. Fagraea obovata.

Penang.\\textsuperscript{170}\n\n\\textsuperscript{167} Raffles wrote to the Duchess of Somerset under date \"off Sumatra, Feb. 12th, 1820\" saying that he had just left Tappanooly. On the 27th, he was off Natal, and in a letter to Marsden states that Jack was with him. Thus we get two dates for visits to Tappanooly, one just previous to Feb. 12th, and Jack's i.e. 23rd to 26th. As there are many slight printing errors in the Memoir of the life of Raffles suspicion falls less on Jack's than on Raffles' dates.\n\n\\textsuperscript{168} This is a reference to the first series of descriptions of Malayan Plants, Malayan Miscellanies, vol. i., 1820. Naturally the greater number of the plants described came from Penang.\n\n\\textsuperscript{169} Wallich described this plant in his and Carey's revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indica, ii. p. 33.

It is a common Penang tree, and Jack's specimens were distributed by Wallich when breaking up the East India Company's herbarium, as No. 8399.\n\\textsuperscript{175} The genus Patisna was never published. The only genus which it can have been is Urophyllum. Wallich had Jack's descriptions for publication at his discretion, and appears to have substituted this name of his own for Jack's. That is why, in publishing Urophyllum, Wallich wrote his own name after the genus, but Jack's after the two species. Griffith (Calcutta Journal of Natural History iv. 1844, p. 17) pointing this out thought that Wallich had inadvertently written his own for Jack's name. The two species are U. villosum and U. glabrum.\n\\textsuperscript{176} Ardisia divergens was described in Carey's and Wallich's revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indica ii. p. 275, and is placed by Wallich next after A. paniculata, Roxb. in his Catalogue No. 2269.

It is to be noted that in this letter Jack questions the genus: and as the only specimen which he had gathered was not in his hands, but had been left with Wallich, probably it is not exactly accurate to assert that Jack called it a Limonia, as it seems to have been Wallich who dropped the query.\n\\textsuperscript{179} Roxburgh's Urtica naucliflora is Conocephalus suaveolens.

Wallichia? glabra is a Tappanoolian. I am not however decided that it shall be so. I shall perhaps have something more splendid to name, only I should like it to be Pentandrian that it may come out soon.\n\nDuring the two days we stayed at Tappanooly, I scrambled over not a few hill and forest tracts, but the season is not the best. The night we came in, we had a narrow escape. We went ashore on Mansilar Island in the evening, the vessel continuing under sail, night came on, the ship outsailed us, we lost sight of her, and had to row about 20 miles in the dark without compass and no stars visible. Ten minutes after we did get on board, (which was at one o\u2019clock at night) there came on a most furious squall which nearly drove us from our anchors, and would have sent us and the boat, had we been out in it, to the D-l in double quick time. However we were born under lucky stars. On Mansilar, we found what I take to be Schrebera Swietenioides Roxb., a delightfully fragrant tree. The Camphor trees were not in flower, but we cut down one and got some Camphor out of it a piece of good fortune, as one in a hundred is only found to contain it. They are indeed the monarchs of the forest. The one cut down measured 90 ft. to the first branch, diameter in proportion, and perfectly straight. I have got young plants, and also of the Styrax Benzoin. Dryobalanops is a confounded herbaceous name, and is nonsensiae nimis affinis!

However Blume in his catalogue of the Buitenzorg gardens published Wallichia as Reinwardt\u2019s name for the genus. Now Reinwardt was in charge of these famous Gardens when Jack went to Java in the hope of recuperating his health: (See p. 239 froward) so that it is probable that Reinwardt got the name Wallichia from Jack then, used it there, and when Blume succeeded Reinwardt without knowing the history of the name, it was ascribed to Reinwardt. Note the connection of the name Urophyllum, or tail-leaf, with Jack\u2019s expression \u201cacuminate gentry.\u201d\n\n189. This plant is not recorded as Sumatran by Miquel in his account of the Flora of Sumatra.\n\n190. See note No. 123.\n\n191.

The pedicels are irregularly fascicled on the summit of the peduncle, and all the flowers turn one way and are bent at an angle to the pedicel. Would \"pedunc: axillaribus floribus cristato fasciculatis secundis\" do? Are your Didymocarpi alternifolious or oppositifolious? I have species both ways. I have a great mind to bring this genus into my grand fascicle, with a drawing of D, frutescens\\textsuperscript{193} and characters of the others. Fagraea racemosa would also deserve a place.\n\nThe people in the interior of Tappanooly are Battus, and we were curious to ascertain whether they were really cannibals as has been represented: our inquiries have placed the fact beyond a doubt, and the circumstances attending the practice are such as I am almost afraid to mention, as they are scarcely to be credited. It appears that by the Battu laws, the capital punishment ordained for certain crimes is to be eaten, and the execution of the sentence is the occasion of a grand feast. But the most horrible part of the story is, that the prisoner is actually eaten alive, and has the\n\n\\textsuperscript{193} Described in the Malayan Miscellanies, i. part 5 (1820) p. 5.\n\nR. A.

We are resolved to witness a human feast. Shall I send you a tit bit preserved in pyro-ligneous acid? The palms of the hands are epicurean morsels, or will you have a great toe? More of this however at another time.\n\nI enclose to you two letters for Mr. Colebrooke and Mr. Lambert,\\(^{194}\\) which pray forward. Read them and tell me if you approve; I wrote them in hopes of being able to send them per Carnatic, but was too late; I wrote Brown\\(^{195}\\) by her. Pray how goes on the report, has it gone in? I wish we could have finished it together, but it will be just as good otherwise. I shall be anxious to hear what it produces. We must keep in view the bringing about a connection between us in the Dept.\n\nI shall also enclose letters for Calder\\(^{196}\\) and Lindsay;\\(^{197}\\) you see I do not spare you in any way. There are enough of requests and commissions in this for one letter at least.\n\nSir Stamford has completely recovered on the way down, and is now as well as ever. By the bye, he wishes to ask you some day that you happen to be in Calcutta, to take a look at the specimen of the Bintooron,\\(^{198}\\) an animal sent up from Malacca by Major Farquhar to the Asiatic Society and in the Museum, and ascertain the number of its teeth; \\(\\ldots\\ldots\\) is a desideratum; also if you can, whether it is what Cuvier calls a plantigrade, i.e., whether the whole length of the foot is applied to the ground.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{194}\\) Aylmer Bourke Lambert (1761-1842), a great collector of plants. He inherited a considerable patrimony which he used freely for the furtherance of science, chiefly by getting together large collections which were at the service of savants. David Don was his curator, the author of the *Prodromus florae nepalensis*, which was based on material obtained by Lambert from Wallich, Raffles and Jack sent to him Sumatran plants. And at his sale in 1842 lot No. 111 was catalogued as probably from Jack and lot 255 as from Raffles, and others. According to information most kindly supplied by Sir David Prain, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the first was bought by the dealer William Pamplin for \u00a31, the second by someone named Rich for \u00a33; their subsequent fate is not known to the writer.

Our Frenchmen\\(^{199}\\) ............. you know ............ were taken up and brought forward by Sir S. Raffles in Calcutta, at a time when their means were exhausted, and they despaired of being able to effect anything; and you know with what kindness they have been treated, the important aid that has been afforded them, the opportunities that have been opened to them, in short the manner in which they have been patronised by that princely man, as never men were patronised before. They have been allowed 1000 rupees a month ever since they have been with him, to defray all their expenses of establishments &c. &c.\u2014besides being provided with passage, table, and here with a house free of all expense. In return for all this, the only stipulation made was, that their collections should be on account of the Company, and that the account of the discoveries they might make, should not appear in France until they had been noticed in England. It was Sir S\u2019s intention, and indeed still is, to have ultimately presented to them a complete set of duplicates in further acknowledgement of their services. To those conditions they gave their full agreement in writing, and in words professed the utmost gratitude for the liberal terms allowed them, and their extreme desire to give everything into the absolute disposal of Sir S. At the same time they were given to understand, that the arrangement was made subject to the approbation of the Supreme Govt., and that the period of their employment would be regulated by that authority. The reply of the supreme Govt. was received in Calcutta, disapproving of the arrangement, sanctioning the expense already incurred, but directing it to cease for the future. On our arrival here we found that they had been very industrious, and had got a considerable number of animals of one kind and another. As therefore they had exerted themselves, Sir Stamford, with all the reason which you know he had to be discontented with them before, felt unwilling to disappoint them in any way, and resolved to make an exertion in their favor rather than at once put a stop to their labours. He accordingly offered them an allowance of 600 rupees a month out of his own pocket, on the chance of its eventually being approved by the Company;\n\n\\(^{199}\\) Diard and Duvaucel.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nexplaining to them at the same time, that as a sufficient number of the principal specimens had already been obtained, the expense might easily be kept within the limits by avoiding an unnecessary number of duplicates. Now what do you think was the reply to this noble proposal?\u2014no words but those of the letter itself can convey to you the full idea, or measure of the ingratitude ....... of it; I shall ask Sir S. to let you have a copy of the correspondence, ............ The fact is they think they have nearly exhausted Sumatra; and now meditate their retreat with as much as they can carry off, ............ They say they were solicited to come here, and in compliance therewith abandoned the researches they had so successfully commenced in Bengal, with many similar lies.\n\nAs they seemed determined not to recede in their pretensions, it became necessary to appoint a committee to take charge of the whole of the collections, which has accordingly been done. They express themselves very indignant, and talk of going to Bengal to protest; ............ Let Gen. Hardwicke (to whom I beg my compliments on his late accession of honors) know the story, and see the correspondence. If possible prevent Lord Hastings from being humbugged by them, humbug. (I like the word and so do you) not being one of the things that his Lordship is quite proof against. There is a vessel here at present that will take a great part of the collections at once to England, which will be so much secured. Our return perhaps was fortunate, as it appears that they had actually been preparing to steal a march and to be off with the whole. So much was this expected that the acting Resident had actually his eye upon them, to place a guard over the house and property, if they should make the attempt.\n\nEnough however of such a subject: I have commenced with it as being the uppermost at the moment, before even acquainting you with our safe arrival here. I wrote you by a vessel that parted with us at Padang, and was proceeding from thence to Madras.\n\nIn that I gave you some account of Tappanooly, and the discoveries in that quarter. We arrived here200 on the 3rd of March, but the weather was so bad, and the surf so great in consequence, that we were unable to land till next day. Rather tantalising this, particularly to Sir S. However we are now once more quietly settled and beginning to resume our old routine. This business of the Frenchmen will give me some additional occupation and disturbances, as all their collections come in here, and there will be the plague of stowing and arranging them, cum stinkibus, et filthibus, et ceteris et ceteris.\n\n---\n\n200. Bengoolen.\nI found here some of your former dispatches which had not appeared on my leaving this, particularly the valuable one by Mr. Stuart. Only one of the series appears to be totally missing, that of March 1819, per Brig Tagus, of which not a trace, and what is provoking, it probably contained a portion of Roxburgh's mss. as I find the part from \"Polygonum lanatum\" to \"Cassia inermis\" wanting. Pray make some inquiry respecting its probable fate, and if lost\u2014the writer may as well supply it. I wanted to have referred to it lately in examining a species of Laurus, called by the Malays Kayu Gadis, or the virgin tree, which name I find subjoined in the catalogue to Roxb.'s L. porrecta. Why the devil did you give it that specific name; I can hardly think of letting it stand, when a much more elegant one might be given in allusion to the native appellation. Let it henceforth be called Laurus virgo, or Laurus Parthenoxylon, alias the Virgin Laurel. Which do you approve? It yields an oil much valued by the natives, and having a balsamic smell somewhat resembling Capivi.\n\nWatson arrived not long after us, but, prop. dolor! brought nothing from you. I hear however that another vessel is to follow, by which I may have your dispatches.\n\nNow I have a grand affair to inform you of, nothing less than specimens of the gigantic flower of Sumatra, Rafflesia Titan. Quid dicit? Marsden in a letter to Sir Stamford, proposes Rafflesia elephantina, Query, which? I must send you a pencil outline of its fructification, in which respect it appears to be as singular and unique as in size. It is no Asclepiad, as was at first guessed, nor does it appear to belong to any known Natural family. It is Polyandrous or rather Gynandrous. The anthers are large spherical bodies, sessile and lodged in hollows under and covered by the lower and projecting edge of the stigma. They are of a\n\n---\n\n201. See notes No. 37 and 119.\n\n202. Cinnamomum Parthenoxylon, Meissn. The wood at all stages has a strong smell as of Citronella oil, not of Camphor, though Kurz called it Martaban Camphor-wood. The seed yields an oil used for rheumatism. Marsden, History of Sumatra, at p. 162 of the third edition, mentions it as having wood smelling of Sassafras. The tree is found in the Malay islands and Peninsula and as far north as the Yang-tze-Kiang valley in China.\n\n203. Rafflesia Arnoldi. Flowers of this strange parasite were obtained in 1818, and a figure from one of them may be seen in the Memoir of Sir T. S. Raffles, opposite p. 316. In a letter later (vide p. 208) Jack says that it had proved to be not uncommon. He described it in detail for publication in the Malayan Miscellanies, under the name of Rafflesia Titan, but held up his description pending news from Europe. Sir William Hooker in 1835 published that description.\n\n204. William Marsden (1754-1836), for eight years (1771-1779) resident in Bencoolen; after which in 1783 he published his History of Sumatra, wherein the care and fidelity exhibited made his reputation. The History went through editions in 1784 (second), and 1811 (third), each of which received the author's careful attention.\n\nMarsden and Raffles had been in correspondence from 1805.\n\nR. A.

The specimen I examined was a yet unopened bud, of the size of a good cabbage. I have information of others, and as soon as I hear of their being blown, mean to take a journey to see them in their native spot.\n\nMarch 22nd.\u2014The business with the Frenchmen is drawing to a close. The correspondence has become so long, and Sir S. is anxious to send a copy home by the ship which sails tomorrow, that I fear that I shall not be able to enclose it in this, but it shall follow. The committee have done their duty in taking charge of all the specimens, in the course of which the Frenchmen showed further their mean jealous spirit in refusing to give specific names to the subjects, and taking off all the distinguishing tickets that they had previously appended to them. The specimens being received, the committee were directed to inform them, that by the terms of their agreement, they were bound to deliver up the observations, and that if they assented to this, and gave their word of honor that the whole of the collections were made over without reservation, they were authorised to make them an offer which was, that if they would agree not to publish in France till the expiration of a year, their descriptions should all be returned to them, and a complete set of duplicates still given to France.\n\nDuvaucel I understand is going to Batavia, thence to Bengal; and Diard talks of going to Padang to prosecute further researches. The sooner they go the better and a good riddance. Let me know what they say or do in Calcutta.\n\nI send by this ship, the \"Mary,\" Indian ink drawings of the two Nepenthes, the gigantic flower, the Camphor, and of that beautiful pentandrian with finely veined and serrated leaves and white fruit. I have named it Euthemis: ab \"euth\u0113m\u014dn\"\u2014concinnus, quid dicit? The two species are E. leucocarpa and E. minor. I have also sent descriptions of these and of the true Sago. They go to Mr. Marsden with instructions to take such notice of them as may prevent anticipation, at the same time that he is apprised of the intention of publishing them afterwards in a fascicle. It would not I think be easy to select other five as interesting. I must soon send you a copy of my account of these. I shall ere long have lots of descriptions for you.\n\n205. Jack succeeded in sending to Wallich by the same boat copies of that part of the correspondence which is in English, but not that in French; Raffles, however sent the whole to London. It is useless to reproduce here the part, not only because it is imperfect, but because the whole, reprinted from Raffles' despatch, may be read in the Memoir of his Life, 1st Edition pp. 702-723.\n\n206. The same boat was to take to Marsden the whole of Raffles' geological collections, as stated in a letter contained in the Memoir of Sir T. S. Raffles, 2nd edition, ii. p. 103.\n\n207.

When I wrote you last the Committee had just closed their proceedings, and the Frenchmen had given their word of honor that they had given up everything. On that Sir S. wrote to them, that as they had concluded everything with the committee, the question of right being no longer in dispute, he was enabled to offer them the same consideration that he always intended; and to do this in the most gratifying manner, desired them to send in a list of such duplicates as they deemed most valuable, which he would be happy to present to them. They sent in a list accordingly which was complied with ............

Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nand Duvaucel reported that a robbery had taken place the night before, by which they had lost all their papers. A robbery of nothing but papers looked a little suspicious, but no comment was made. Yesterday however a man came in and reported that a box had been seen among the grass near the house where the Frenchmen had been living, but that he was afraid to touch it for fear of being accused of having stolen it. It was then sent for and brought in to Sir S., while in Court, where he happened to be sitting that day. It was a box securely nailed up, and well tarred outside and at the joints. On opening it there appeared first a quantity of tow, and then a quantity of papers rolled up and laid in as if hastily packed; these proved to be the Frenchmen's papers, who were informed of the circumstance, and were somewhat surprised at the coming to light of the precious deposit. The box was handed over to the Committee, to receive from the Frenchmen such part of the contents as related to Natural History. They gave a few scraps, and sketches, and gave their word of honor that all the rest were private papers. Unfortunately for the value of their word, some of the rolls of paper had been looked at, and known to be descriptions and sketches, but these were not delivered up, so that they have given their word of honor to what the whole court know to be untrue. So much for that part of it. As to the finding of the box, from the place where it lay, untouched and unopened, the way in which the papers were stowed, not laid in order as if it had been their usual depository, but rolled up hastily as they came to hand; the way in which the box itself was secured with nails and hammer, and further the box having been recognised to have been made only the very day before it was said to be missing, there seems little doubt that it was lost where it could readily be found, and that its discovery was a disappointment to those who had been bewailing its loss. But I am sick of the subject: thank Heaven, Sir S. is done with them. Diard I understand is going to Batavia; and Duvaucel talks of going to Padang, to make, he says, in three months, a better collection than that of Sir S. in a year. Diard says he goes from Batavia to Calcutta. I think there is little to apprehend from anything two such (what shall I call them) can do. I have already told you to be prepared to meet any mis-statements they may spread, for which purpose I have wasted so many words on them.\n\nThey having given over the collection without names or observations, or at least with very few, it becomes necessary to supply the deficiency and prepare an account of it for England. This task of course falls on me, and is no trifling one. As the object is to have it out soon, I am obliged to devote myself to it, and must therefore let my own pursuits stand still for a little.\n\nI have been at work for some days, and have got pretty well through the Mammalia. It is a devil of a job, but there is no help-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ning it, it must be got through. I have not time for more at present, so I conclude, with best regards to you and Mrs. W.\n\nAnd I am ever,\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\nBencoolen,\n\n1st June, 1820.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nI have been much disappointed at not having a single opportunity of writing you for a long period, and now I have nothing better than the circuitous route of Batavia. I must therefore content myself with a few lines, and trust that ere long I shall have some direct opportunity. I am very anxious to hear from you and learn your plans for the ensuing season. The time of your purposed voyage\\(^{211}\\) is fast approaching, and I am desirous of learning your arrangements regarding it. I do hope on your own account that you will put it in execution, it will relieve you from a great deal of tiresome worrying business; and a year passed in amusement and pleasure in an alpine region like Nepaul, will be as good as a voyage to Europe, and be an epoch from which to date the commencement of a new lease of life. If you could have made a voyage here in place of the Nepaul trip, it would have been to me still more delightful, but we are seldom fated to have all we wish in this world, and happy is he who looks at the brightest side of the present, whatever it be, and takes the honey of every flower he finds, without repining that it is not the wished for rose. I think there are few people who have more the means of being independent of circumstances than ourselves, and such as like us can turn from any prospect, however dark to that of nature which is always the same, fresh and bright. But stop, good Mr. pen, not so fast, as Fielding says, we have got on the top of a hill, how we are to get down again is the question. I believe he does it, by ringing the bell for breakfast, and though I have not that resource at hand just now, I must somehow contrive to descend to matters of fact.\n\nAnd first for domestic news; I have a new character to introduce on the stage in the person of Lady Raffles' second son, who made his debut about a week ago with great applause. Captain Watson's lady also presented him with a girl a few days before. In short, increase of the population is the order of the day in more ways than one. Sir Stamford's indefatigable mind is now turned to the improvement of this place, and to drawing forth its\n\n\\(^{211}\\) Journey to Nepal. Wallieh resided at or near Khatmandu from 21st Dec., 1820 to November 8th or 9th, 1821.\nresources whatever they may be. It would be too long to give you here a detail of all he has done, and all he is doing, suffice it to say the very aspect of the place is changed, and in spite of all its natural disadvantages, there are good hopes of its rising. Natives and Europeans all seem to awake to the new impulse they receive, and I really think the former more readily and fully than the latter. It is hardly possible to conceive the apathy and vis inertiae of the Europeans who have been trained up and imbibed the spirit of the old school of this place.\n\nThe last twenty years of Bencoolen have been its age of Gothic darkness. It was far better before in the time of its old government, but has declined ever since it fell under Bengal. Nunc redit ad pristinam dignitatem, yea, it revives in more than pristine splendour.\n\nI have just concluded the second and longest part of the Zoological Paper\u2014The Birds. The remainder will not be given so much in detail, and will I hope be soon finished; then for Botany anew. It has been almost suspended by these and other occupations. I have got numbers of the great flowers and have at length satisfied myself upon every point, and have corrected many of the first ideas of it. I mean to send you a few specimens. How to send it living is more puzzling. I find it is parasitic on a species of Cissus with quinate and ternate leaves, which I cannot ascertain as yet for want of Roxb.\u2014these leaves are serrate and smooth. From the stems of this woody Cissus which run either on, or under the ground, spring these gigantic flowers. At first a round knob, enveloped in a number of calycine or bracteal leaves, which open as the flower enlarges, and mostly drop off as it gets ripe. The flowers are unisexual? ergo Dioicous. The male has the globular anthers disposed round the margin of the central column, as I have already described. The female wants them, but is otherwise similar: and the centre of the column is occupied by the minute seeds which are not exactly nidulant but disposed on the surfaces of a number of fissures, which traverse the substance of the column without any order or regularity. We get them [the flowers] in numbers from all parts of the country, so that they do not appear to be rare. Strange that they never before should have been heard of. They are called by the natives Pelinum Sekuddi, or the devil\u2019s siribox, or as you would call it in Bengal Paun box. I like the name\u2014Poculum Jovis preoc: dub:\n\nI had a story to tell you of the Frenchmen, but will let it alone just now. Here break we off at that unhallowed name like bards of old when words ill omened came.\n\nBelieve me my dear Wallich, thine in s\u00e6cula s\u00e6culorum.\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\n212.

(Cissus angustifolia, Roxb.), according to Jack in the Malayan Miscellanies.\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nWe are still without any arrivals from Bengal, and consequently not a line of advice from you. The time must be approaching for your trip up the country, and I am not even certain whether this will find you in Calcutta. The London, a large China ship, arrived here some time ago direct for England, and we have taken advantage of that opportunity to send home the greater part of the Zoological collections.\\textsuperscript{215} The second part of the description of them is finished and goes home now via Bengal. Sir S. is very desirous to get the drawings home at the same time, as it will give the people at home the means of examining and comparing the whole, and making any corrections in the paper that may be necessary before publication. As there is no likelihood of any direct opportunities from home, we have determined to send them via Bengal. They are put in charge of young O'Brien, one of the officers of Watson's corps, who is going up on duty, and his directions are to take them direct to you, if you are in Calcutta; and if you should have left it, to entrust them to Calder. They will be put up ready and fit for transmission to England, and it is therefore an object to avoid their being opened at the Custom House, or in any way overhauled until they arrive at their destination. We were thinking at first of addressing them to you, in case you might wish to look at them, but considering the chance of your being away, and moreover that they are not of main interest to you, and that your time is too fully occupied otherwise, we thought it best to save you all trouble but that of despatching them. This I am sure you will readily undertake to do, and get them off by the very first opportunity. It is of great consequence their arriving early, as if they are much delayed the paper will be out without the advantage of reference, the \"pieces justificatives\" as the French would say. They ought to go I think regularly manifested, and with a letter of advice to enable Sir Jos.\\textsuperscript{216} to get a Treasury order for their landing. There is lots of trouble for you, and I cannot think of giving you so much without taking example in some degree by the native custom, of not making solicitations empty handed. As they conclude their letters with, \"I have nothing to offer my friend but\u2014which I request him to accept,\" so I shall conclude the above request with specimens in spirits, of our gigantic flower.\n\n\\begin{quote}\nQuale portentum neque militaris \\\\\n\\textit{India} in latis alit esculetis \\\\\nNec Juba tellus generat leonum \\\\\nArida nutrix.\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\textsuperscript{215} Arrived safely. \\\\\n\\textsuperscript{216} Sir Joseph Banks.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nI have dispatched a cask of them to England, and here are some for you. You cannot imagine what abundance we have procured of them, and I have thereby been enabled to ascertain every point respecting them. I think I gave you in my last the particulars, that it is parasitic on a species of Cissus, that it is dioecious, and that the seeds are minute and nidulant in the centre of the column of fructification.\n\nBotany I am sorry to say, has been most grievously at a stand, but I hope soon to resume it and make up for leeway.\n\nAmong our other plans and schemes here, is an agricultural Society which we have established, and of which I am Secretary. Our objects are more practical than to make a figure on paper, and the people will feel the benefits of it most. If however I frame any report on the subject, which I have some idea of doing on the state of the country generally with reference to it, you shall see our lucubrations.\n\nWe have no intelligence from home on the points of immediate interest to ourselves, and there is so much else to occupy people at home, that I do not think anything will be speedily decided. Perhaps it is all the better, the longer they are about it, the better it probably will be done.\n\nAs the vessel will be soon off, and I have a good deal to do to get everything ready, I must make this a short letter. I hope to hear soon from you, and then you shall have more.\n\nRemember me to Mrs. Wallich,\n\nAnd believe me always, my dear Wallich,\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\nP.S. The box of drawings will be addressed to Sir Joseph Banks and Mr. Marsden jointly. A letter containing a list of the contents will be written to them, and sent to Calder to forward. You can therefore communicate with him.\n\nBy the bye, a late letter from Sir Joseph to Sir Stamford acknowledges the receipt of seeds of my Nepenthes through you.\n\nThe specimens of the Titan, are large buds, the opened flowers are difficult to preserve, and buds exhibit everything essential. I advise you to prepare your largest microscope against the arrival of these diminutive fellows.\n\nBencoolen,\n19th Aug., 1820\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nIt is not long since I received your letter No. 2, from Mr. Hall, but No. 1 has not yet made its appearance. I hope it will soon, for I am anxious to have replies from you on many points.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nI rejoice to hear that the Nepal expedition has been so happily brought about; both as regards yourself and as regards science it is most glorious. You will spend a year or more most delightfully in a Hyperborean climate, with no vile Calcutta cares and vexations to disturb you, restore your health \u201cto its pristine dignity\u201d (that phrase is a favorite of yours and mine) and descend again into the plains like a new fledged eagle from his mountain eyrie. But what is this to the harvest before you, to the glorious discoveries that await you, you are about to revel among the living sweets, whose dead anatomies have been exciting our admiration during past years. Agreeably as I am situated here, I could wish to transport myself in a twinkling to your side in a ramble over some pine covered hill, or enormous snow crowned mountains. What exclamations, what triple marks of admiration!!! verily and truly, friend of mine, we lose a positive pleasure in surveying all our wonders with solitary eyes.\n\nI wish in place of your present trip, we could have carried you with us to this island of wonders. But we cannot have everything we wish.\n\nI enclose for your edification, two copies of the firstfruits from our Sumatran Press, it is my part of the first volume of the Malayan Miscellanies, (so we have entitled our collections). The first volume is not particularly interesting, consisting chiefly of papers that Sir S. left to keep the press at work during our absence, and taken at random out of a mass of materials, without undergoing examination or revision. As however when we returned we found enough to make a small volume, forth they come, as they are, and to help it out I have given a few descriptions of minor interest. We have also put one or two of the Frenchmen\u2019s papers, which will show what they really are, and enable us if they attempt anything, to judge them out of their own mouths. Let me have the benefit of any remarks that suggest themselves to you upon the plants here mentioned.\n\nOur second volume will be more interesting, it is proposed to contain the proceedings of the Agricultural Society, the first Report of which I have just completed. It is in fact rather a statistical than Agricultural paper, and forms a kind of supplement to my former Report on the State of Society. I am now cogitating on my projected fascicle, and plan a considerable extension of the original idea. It strikes me, that such splendid plates as they are intended to be, ought to be accompanied with more than the few sheets of letter press that the mere scientific\n\n---\n\n217. E.

I am therefore thinking of a general view of the Natural History of the Eastern Islands, to which the descriptions will be an appendix. It will take me some time to execute this up to the plan I have in view, but I think I shall be able to get sufficient materials, and it will be a pity not to make use of them. I am very glad you had an opportunity of mentioning the circumstances about the Frenchmen to Lord Hastings. I have heard very little about them lately; they will probably sink into merited insignificance and there let them rest.\n\nI read your letter on the subject of timber plantations with much interest. I wish however, to have from you some of the collateral history of it, that is to say, of the circumstances which called for it etc.\n\nThe teak forests in Java were a very important object of attention, and I believe there were some able Reports made on them. I mean to see if I can rummage them out among Sir Stamford\u2019s papers, and if I find anything in them likely to be interesting to you, I will let you know.\n\nI send this up by Capt. MacKenzie, a brother of Holt MacKenzie: he is appointed resident of Singapore, and goes up to Calcutta previous to taking charge. I imagine he has no chance of seeing you in Calcutta, but if it should so happen, I should wish you to see him, and he is equally desirous of paying you a visit.\n\nThis vessel goes round by the Straits of Sunda, and we expect another here soon on its way to Calcutta direct, so I shall write again and more at length by that occasion, and may perhaps in the interim receive some more of your letters.\n\nLady Hastings has requested me to send a Hortus Siccus for the Edinburgh Museum, which of course I must do, and I shall take care that at least the things be neatly put up and in good paper, which perhaps are points that are better understood than the value of the specimens. Were it not that it would be as well on Sir Stamford\u2019s account to keep her in good humour, I should hardly be induced to take even that trouble for any attention I have ever received, or good I am ever likely to get from her.\n\nI shall conclude with best regards to Mrs. Wallich and yourself and am always,\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\n220. Buckley says (Anecdotal History, i. p. 64) that in September, 1820, there was sent to Calcutta \u201cby the hand of Captain Holt M\u2019Kenzie, the Secretary to Government at Bencoolen, then on his way to Bengal\u201d a petition against the dreaded abandonment of Singapore. Jack\u2019s statement above is divergent in showing that it was the Captain MacKenzie\u2014a brother of the Secretary to Government in Calcutta Mr. Holt MacKenzie\u2014who proceeded to Bengal.\nBencoolen,\n9th September, 1820.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nI have just received your letter of the 7th of June No. 3, but have no tidings of No. 1. I begin to fear it may be lost in some of the dreadful gales that occurred in March and April. As your two last letters have been brief, I conclude that it must have been long and full, if so, it will be most melancholy to find that it has gone to the bottom where \"All its hidden treasures\" sleep known but to the genii of the deep who (d-n their eyes) will be none the wiser. Pray recapitulate the contents thereof, and mention whether it had any accompaniments. I am without information from you on a number of interesting points, such as the particulars of your arrangements for your trip, and during your absence, your notes and observations on the specimens e multis etceteris.\u2014I see you have been able to make some use of them in the second vol. of Roxburgh. I will presently give you a few remarks on some of these and as you are going on so briskly, I must make haste to send you such further remarks, as may eventually be useful to you in this chapter.\n\nI sent you a few printed descriptions by the \"Frolic,\" which left this some time ago.\n\nThe concluding paragraph of your letter respecting George, depend upon it shall be fully complied with. I am glad you have written yourself to my father, and be assured I shall follow it up.\n\nI am sadly out of spirits with some late news from home, the most grievous however of which I, as yet, have only from the public papers, I mean, the death of my valued friend Sir Vicary Gibbs. I have at this moment on my table a letter from Lady Gibbs which I must answer; hers is long antecedent to this event, and in what terms to reply I know not. It is terrible to think how my circle of friends has been narrowed in the short time that has elapsed since I left home, and the fatality has fallen more among those which my personal connection was the most intimate with, than among relations, whom from less personal intercourse, I cannot be warmly attached to.\n\n---\n\n221.

Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nIt is not fair however to vent on you my lamentations, but I know not how it is when a subject is uppermost in my mind, it must come out before I can go on, and I mention it to account for a disjointed letter, as I foresee this will be.\n\nIn a late advertisement respecting the Edinburgh Journal, I think I saw an article announced under your name, \"Progress of Botany in India\" I think. Is it correct?\n\nI am glad to find the Patons favorites of yours: they are very much so of mine. I received by young Hule the first volume of Roxburgh and duly presented the copy to Sir Stamford. I returned to Dr. Carey the portion of a copy still remaining here, which had previously been received.\n\nBy the bye, I hope you do not mean to make my copy a gift, in place of being my subscription to the work. Between you and me such is by no means necessary. I wish further, that you would order on my account a copy to be sent to my father. I think he would like to see it and Calder will forward it.\n\nDid I ever tell you of an idea that we started here some time ago regarding your discovery of the *Daphne cannabina*? A gentleman whose name I forget, but who seems to be a scheming sort of character wrote to Sir S. making a variety of requests, such as, for the different kinds of grain, pulse etc. of this country, and among other things, whether there was any material for paper peculiar to the East, as an idea had been started, that if bank notes could be made on paper of some foreign and difficultly procurable material possessed of qualities different from the common Europe paper, that the difficulty of forging them would be materially increased. I suggested the Nepal paper as answering the required conditions, and further being capable of being monopolised and, Sir S. sent in consequence a copy of your account in the Asiatic Researches and the specimens of the paper which I gave him out of the same. The idea seems to me feasible enough, and who knows but your name may soon figure in the annals of the Bank of England, not in their books I fear, which would be much better, but as a contributor to their securities. If they adopt it, I think they should make you a present of the amount of their former losses by forgery, or at least make you their contractor for the supply of paper, which would perhaps be better. At all events the discovery may be the means of saving a considerable number of lives.\n\n---\n\n223. A Paton from 1814 to 1817 was district judge at Krishnagar, Bengal, one day's journey by water from Calcutta. But there is nothing in these letters by which these Patons can be identified.\n\n224. Wallieh and Carey's revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indica.\n\n225. Apparently advanced proofs of volume i. of the Flora Indica.\n\n226. The material from which paper is made in Nepal and South-western China.\nIn one of my late letters from Lindsay, he communicates a request from the Marchioness, that I would send her a Hortus Siccus for her Edinburgh Museum; I comply with it by this occasion, but mean to humbug her in the matter. My best specimens have all gone home, as you know, .......... I have therefore put up a parcel of second rate ones, with plenty of good paper, which is of more consequence (Kaleidoscopically!) and sent her such a flaming list, as will make her think she has the most precious and learned collection ever sent from India. I trust to her indolence never to look into them; indeed if she did, I don\u2019t suppose she would know a Mangosteen from an apple, and then as for the most learned body to which they are to go, the name of the Marchioness will humbug them, and I daresay the sapient Professor of Botony will in reply, extol her Ladyship\u2019s skill and discernment in the selection, and sound the praises of that of which he knows nothing about.\n\nNow for remarks on sheets A to H. Fagraea fragrans, I think Roxburgh is wrong in saying it was brought from China. I found it also in the same garden alluded to, where nobody knew where it had come from, but afterwards got abundance of it from the Kedah shore, where it is a timber tree and well known to the natives.\n\nF. auriculata. I ought to have given you my mems on this. It is arborescent; I had also very fine fruits as large as an egg, of which the following is my note. Fructus baccatus ovoideus, glaber, parte styli persistente acuminatus, bilocularis, seminibus numerosis, pulpa nidulantibus.\n\nI have great doubts as to diversity of F. racemosa and volubilis. In the first place I question the latter being voluble; it is straggling and often with twisted branches, but I think I have seen it grow to a stout but small tree. I always considered them the same; however I will make a more vigorous examination and report to you accordingly.\n\n227. Sir T. Carlaw Martin, Director of the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, has been so good as to turn up his records seeking information upon this Hortus Siccus; but he is unable to find any, and adds that no specimens are in the Museum.\n\n228. The tembusu.\u2014Fagraea fragrans, Roxb., is not common in Penang doubtless because suitable sandy land does not exist in quantity; and this is perhaps the reason why those in correspondence with Roxburgh who visited Penang had not told him that the tree is Malayan. It is to be noted that Jack records it also for Kedah. This mention of the Kedah shore is most important as it is the only indication that Jack landed on the mainland; and makes it possible that some of his \u201cPenang\u201d plants, thought to be extinct now, were not actually obtained by him in the island.\n\n229. Fagraea auriculata, Jack, had been obtained from Singapore, and later at Tappanouly.\n\n230. Fagraea racemosa, Jack, had been obtained in Sumatra and described in Wallich and Carey\u2019s revision of Roxburgh\u2019s Flora. As hinted here F. volubilis, which was described at the same time, does not differ.\nYour name of Neuropeltis I like much, and prefer it to the one I was thinking of Neuropteris, which is too like the fam. of Insecta. My account of the fruit is as follows:\u2014Capsula 4-valvis, monosperma, semen globosum, albumine parce mucilaginoso cotyledonibus contortuplicatis, radicula \"umbilico obversa\" infera.\n\nI believe I mentioned to you having found what I took to be a new *Macrolobium*. I happen afterwards accidentally to refer to Jonesia and Rheedee's Asjoogam, when the similarity with my Macrolobium struck me, and on further comparison I was convinced of their identity in genus, not in species, mine being tetran-drous. On analysing however Roxburgh's description, which is ineffably bad, for who would call the bracts a diphyllous calyx, and give a leguminous plant a tubular monopetalous corolla, bearing not only the stamina but the pistillum, a thing *hactenus inauditum*, I have arrived at the conclusion that Jonesia is nothing else than Macrolobium disguised under a blundering description. The only single point of difference is that Jonesia wants the petal which Macrolobium has. They are both equally variable in the No. of stamens, and I think it questionable whether the want of petal is a difference of generic value. Both ought certainly to be placed in Decandria in place of their present absurd situations, and with as good right as Bauhinia and many other genera.\n\nAs I hence, so far, altered my plan of a fascicle, that it will be a work of some time to complete it, I begin to think of getting out all my plants of any consequence in other ways, which I may at any time resume again in the fascicle, with the addition of figures. You shall have whatever I can give in Pentandrias and the other classes as you go on, and in the mean time I think of giving some to the Linnean or other Societies at home. Do the Asiatic deserve any i.e. will they bring them out in any decent time? I think for home, the best way will be to group them; for instance, I think of making one paper on the Leguminosae that I may have, in which the Macrolobia may come. I thought of another on the Mangiferae, but my materials are not yet complete. I shall send you what I have as it comes into print: I have lately got two new ones besides my former M. quadrifida, and have information of several others. One of these I have described as M. caesia (at least I think that shall be the name) which is a very remarkable species.\n\n---\n\n231. *Neuropeltis* is one of the Convolvulaceae, and it seems probable that Jack had found *N. racemosa* in Penang, whence Wallich also brought it a few years later. But it seems extinct on the island now.\n\n232. *Saroaca declinata*, Mia. (*Jonesia declinata*, Jack in Malay. Misc., ii. (1820) No. 7, p. 74). Miquel gives no other locality for it than Bencoolen.\n\n233. The description of *Mangifera caesia* was sent to Wallich and inserted by him in his and Carey's revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indiae, ii. p. 441.\nI perceive you quote Roemer, Systema Vegetabilium vol. IV.\\textsuperscript{234} I hope you have taken measures to have a copy of that work for me. DeCandolle\\textsuperscript{235} is another desideratum. We are busy making a final clearing of all zoological subjects, when I think all arrears may be considered brought up, and we may make a fresh start. I have been long intending a trip into the interior, but the number of things that have occurred to keep me employed, has prevented it as yet, and the season is now so far advanced, that a very short one will be all that can be attempted. However, I am in no want of materials, so it does not signify. Let me know how your letters had best be addressed.\n\nMy best regards to Mrs. Wallich; Sir S. and Lady Raffles join in the same to you both.\n\nThine ever,\nWilliam Jack.\n\nP.S. Lady Gibbs tells me that they have made a discovery in England that all tropical bulbs will thrive in the open air if sunk in a pond, near the surface in summer, and deeper in winter, so as to be out of the reach of the frost, and with greater luxuriance than in hot houses. She therefore begs me to send her bulbs and handy seeds; may I request you to remember her in this way at the dispatching season. The bulbs of course, dry in a box. I am glad we sent her some last year, they will be acceptable.\n\nThe stones you mention may remain with you.\n\nThere are some large Mangosteen plants going up to Lady Hastings, who I hope will send them to the garden, as I think they are large enough to thrive. I mean also to send to the garden, a few plants of our noble Datura arborea.\\textsuperscript{236}\n\nW. J.\n\nNo. 9 Bencoolen,\n\n19th September, 1820.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nMy last two letters went by the Venus; I now send the remainder of my Pentandrian descriptions. Since I wrote them I have somewhat altered my plan in regard to my descriptions, and have determined on forthwith printing here everything that I have worth it. That once done, it is secured and the number of copies being very small I can make use of any of them again when neces-\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textsuperscript{234} J. J. Roemer and J. A. Schultes, Systema vegetabilium, Stuttgart, 1817-1830, seven volumes.\n\\item \\textsuperscript{235} A. P. De Candolle, Regni vegetabilis systema naturale, Paris, 1818-1821, two volumes.\n\\item \\textsuperscript{236} \\textit{Datura arborea}, Linn., is a native of the Andes: but it has long been in cultivation in the East.\n\\end{itemize}\nsary in any other work. They can also be circulated and I can better have the advantage of remarks upon them. In a country like this where new things, and new subjects are perpetually occurring, the old ones lose their interest unless taken at the moment, and what is once printed may be considered as finished and disposed of, whereas if you go on accumulating, the mass becomes too great and you are prevented by arrears from advancing. We are now at leisure to attend to these things with the means at hand; how can we promise that we shall have the same a year hence? On all these accounts I have determined to print. Some that I now send you will be contained in mine too, but that is of no consequence; if mine is first out, you can quote, and if not, your bringing it out is no prejudice to the other. The Mangiferae, Rauwolfia sumatrana, Euthemis, Styphelia, Celastrus bivalvis, and Morindae will probably be in this number.237 Some I shall not for fear of cross purposes about names. Patisnae238 not in case you should adopt Wallichia which I left at your option. I have not found another Pentandrous genus to which to give that worthy name. Euthemis unluckily has gone home and may come out under that appellation, and I cannot here adopt it to any plant of another class till I know whether you have approved the Patisnae or not. I once thought Rauwolfia new, and had fixed on it, but it turned out otherwise. What sayest thou to Strophanthus plicata from the plaited, not squamous faux?239 Mind, not your original proposal of my name, which I do not wish to see figure in that way at all at all.240 It is no object of my ambition, and the cacophony must not be suffered by such admirers of the classical graces of Euphony as you and I. To memory, put down that!! My Didymocarpi and Sonerilae are now in the press. Do you recollect a Singapore tetrandrus Rubiacea which we examined together\n\n---\n\n237. There is a postscript to this letter which is to be read in conjunction with the paragraph above. The postscript shows that before the letter left Jack's hands, the mission press had actually sent to him proof (some of it revised proof) towards the contemplated number. This proof Jack sent on to Wallich asking for criticism, and waited. In a later letter Jack says that he had had no letter from Wallich since a date previous to this; and so it is evident that the looked for criticism never came. Meanwhile the time for publication came, and Jack issued the number as No. 5 of volume 1 of the Malayan Miscellanies having withdrawn from it a part e.g. the Mangiferas. It would be most interesting if the unpublished proof could be traced among the records of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta.\n\n238. Patisna of Jack ined. otherwise Wallichia of Jack in these letters and of Reinwardt in the Buitenzorg Gardens, published by Blume in his catalogue, is Urophyllum of Wallich, vide note No. 188 on p. 198.\n\n239. It is evident that this is Wallich's *Strophanthus Jackianus* published in the Catalogue, No. 1643, which is *Wrightia dubia* Spreng. Jack collected it in Penang where it grows.\n\n240. What Jack collected and sent to Wallich, became No. 1643 in Wallich's Catalogue.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nand determined to be a new genus. I have called it Epithinia (i.e. littorea from its habitat). How often when making a name when you think you have hit on a highly classical one, which you flatter yourself is unoccupied, turn to Brown and lo! you are anticipated. For this I thought I had made a capital innovation of Aegialites, but on turning to the Prodromus behold it gracing the shores of New Holland, instead of Singapore. So I must reduce to a vile Epithinia. Of the enclosed descriptions the Euthemides have gone home. The Euchelia and Ardisia are copies of our common Memms. Styphelia you will see I have completed, we were interrupted in the middle of it. I have ascertained in other specimens that the anthers do burst in the middle, so as to be only one celled as so admirably described by Brown; we did not find any anthers spontaneously burst, and therefore put a \"vix non ut in Brown Prod. H.\" which need not now be so ceremoniously stated.\n\nFor the three valved capsular plant which follows Patisna, I have not thought of a name yet. It comes near to Vareca, but is valved not baccate. You have had specimens of it. What may it be, or what shall it be called. On second thought it must belong to Pittosporee, Br., vix opinor ejusdem generis, the seeds having no pitch on them!\n\nWhat do you make of my Hypsogyne sent in my last? I think it is new. It is a great bore the huge distance that separates us. One is so long of getting an answer to a question, and I have hundreds that I would ask if we were nearer. Recollect the list of queries and descriptions that I gave you in one of my early letters. The fair Monsoon is approaching for vessels to come here, so fail not to write fully, now that you have fewer vexations and interruptions. Let me know all your arrangements, how the editing of Roxburgh is to go on. How do you manage for books for reference? you cannot carry all with you.\n\n241. Described in the Malayan Miscellanies, i. 1820, part 5, p. 12. Jack however was forestalled by Gaertner who had called it Scyphyphora hydrophyllacea. It is common round the coasts of Malaya.\n\n242.

No description of this appeared in the Malayan Miscellanies and it would appear as if it had been withdrawn along with those of the Mangiferas for publication by Carey and Wallich.

See note No. 257 forward.\nI find Roxburgh's Murraya sumatrana is nothing more than Loureiro's Chalceas paniculata, Rumphius's Camunium,\\textsuperscript{249} unjustly degraded from the rank of a species and confounded with Murraya exotica: I mean to restore it as M. paniculata, a bad name by the bye, because not panicked. I think you would do well to alter Roxburgh's Camunium, which is improperly applied. The Murraya is the true Camunium (I find it is Aglaia of Loureiro, so pray adopt that name, which is good. I mean to do so in the present number of my descriptions).\n\nWhat is Roxburgh's Petaloma in reality, it has nothing to do with Petaloma, and I suspect it of being congener of a coccineous Combretaceae which I was thinking of calling Pyrrhanthus.\\textsuperscript{250} An affinis Lagunculariae, Gaertn.?\n\nPray is Avicennia resinifera, distinct from A. tomentosa.\\textsuperscript{251} The former is perhaps Rumph.'s Mangium album which I have here, and is a good figure. I do not precisely remember the Avicennia of the Sunderbunds, but I think this is different. The fruit of mine is much smaller, being less than an inch long. The leaves are lanceolate, pointed, white but not tomentose below.\n\nMy very best regards to Mrs. Wallich, and believe me always.\n\nThine Affectionately,\n\nWilliam Jack.\n\nP.S. The press has been more active than I expected, and enables me to send you the 3 first sheets of my second paper, the last are uncorrected proofs. They include all Pentandria and I therefore withdraw\\textsuperscript{252} the MSS. of those that appear in it. Pray give me what remarks occur to you.\n\nI think you have now all the Pens\\textsuperscript{253} that I have made descriptions of.

Jack.\n\n\\textsuperscript{249} See note No. 148 p. 189.\n\\textsuperscript{250} Yes; Jack is right.\n\\textsuperscript{251} Jack evidently asks if the Avicennia resinifera described by Forster, and the Avicennia tomentosa, ascribed by Robert Brown in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae to Jacquin, differ. Under Pyrrhanthus in the Malayan Miscellanies, ii. (1822) No. 7, p. 57, he records the finding in Sumatra of what he took to be the first.\n\\textsuperscript{252} What Jack withdrew can only be ascertained from such proof as he sent to Wallich if still preserved in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta.\n\\textsuperscript{253} Pentandria.

See note No. 174, on p. 196.\nOn board the Natal Choonean off Padang,\n11th October, 1820.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nWhen I last wrote you I little thought to be so soon on the move: but so it is. Sir S. and I had some conversation one morning at breakfast about Pulo Nias\\textsuperscript{255} which ended in his proposing to me to go there on a special mission, and so in two days thereafter, I put myself on board a native vessel for Natal the point of appui for Nias, and am thus far on my way. Of the objects &c. of this trip I shall hereafter write more fully. I only sit down at present to be prepared for any chance opportunity that may occur to give you a few of my botanical discoveries that may be in time for Roxburgh\u2019s second vol. It is more than doubtful whether I shall be able to send this before my return to Bencoolen, so it would be idle to say much on other subjects. For the last few days I have been bothered with calms, but (to speak in that case like an Irishman) \u201cits an ill wind that blows nobody good,\u201d so instead of fretting for a wind that would not come, I ordered out the boat, and proceeded to ransack the hundred beautiful little islands that stud this part of the Sumatran coast. Pulo Kumbang, Pulo Bintangor, Pulo Pegang, Pulo Shytan! &c. &c. have thus been explored, and their plants rescued from oblivion. You can hardly imagine anything more beautiful than these little islands, rising in little hills out of the blue waters, and covered either with forests, or planted with cocoanut trees. The access to them is not however always easy, their shores being generally guarded by coral reefs, on which the heavy surf is always beating,\u2014a good roll in which is often the price of landing.\n\nI am now up with you in Didymocarpi, having found my fifth in one of these excursions, a didynamous species, which I mean to call D. elongata, from having the lower lip of the corolla and its tube unusually elongated, also long secund spikes.\\textsuperscript{256}\n\nI found also fresh specimens of what in my last despatches I called Hypsagyne, and on referring to Roxb. (which I had not with me when I first found it at Tappanooly) find that it is neither more nor less than his Johnia, but a new species,\u2014Sumatrana (si velis, mihi).\\textsuperscript{257} With all due deference, I think it is a great pity Roxburgh discovered it first, for I like my own name best. I found at the same time a Hippocratea, which agrees with Roxb. H. obtusifolia in having 4-seeded capsules, but has serrated leaves, ergo I think new.\\textsuperscript{258} Have you not often remarked what singular\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textsuperscript{255} A large island off the west coast of Sumatra.\n\\item \\textsuperscript{256} \\textit{Didymocarpus elongata}, Jack in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, xiv.

He does not seem to have understood the true intention of them, and generally is very much out in the selection of essentialities. Compare in this respect that wonderful man Brown, I must send you herewith a Pentandrian species of his, which perhaps you would not expect from hence, and which, if in time, may enter into Roxburgh: it is Sersalisia obovata, Br. Prodr. N. H. p. 530\\textsuperscript{259} and would be a Sideroxylon of Linnean nomenclature.\n\nI have one other very interesting pentandrian for you. Hoya grandiflora, Br.\\textsuperscript{260} a most splendid personage; flowers 2 inches in diameter, red shading into white, corolla thick and polished like a Japan tea tray. The whole plant hirsute!! Hoya viridiflora\\textsuperscript{261} I have also found in considerable abundance.\n\nI have also found a new Begonia. Do you remember a Myrtoidea from Acheen among the specimens we examined together, with 3-nerved leaves?; I have again found it, and another nearly related species,\\textsuperscript{262} which I think I must make a genus of, as it has a 1-celled ovary, many ovula attached to parietal receptacles. Berry few seeded. Now if the general character of the Myrtoideae are more dependent on their ovaries than fruit, this will not come under any of the present genera.\n\nPray what are the affinities of Hippocratea and Johnia? Their flowers are so exactly alike, that without the fruit they would pass for the same genus, and a 3-celled berry and a 3-capsuled fruit are not incompatible with a junction. I doubt however their affinity to Aceres. Their resemblance is strong to Rhamn\u00e6e in habit, but an exalbuminous fruit is against, an Hippocratea vere exalbuminosa? They seem to be somewhat intermediate betwixt Terebinthace\u00e6 and Rhamn\u00e6\u00e6, at least as much as between Aceres and Malpighi\u00e6. I confess I do not very well understand the distinction between a calycine nectarial disk and a hypogynous one.\n\nNattal, 15 Oct. 1820. I arrived here last night and find a boat going off for Padang, of which I avail myself, as it is the most likely way of this reaching you. I intended to have put up a\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textsuperscript{259} Sersalisia obovata, R. Br. is Sideroxylon Brownii, F. Muell.,\u2014a plant of Queensland.

I am now on my return and as there will probably be lots of business awaiting me at my head quarters, I shall take the opportunity of ship leisure to give you some account of my operations.\u2014I learn from Sir S. that there is a huge despatch of yours waiting my return on which I long to feast, and after the long privation of all such food it will be doubly delightful. What would I not have given for you to have been with me on this trip, what exclamations, what treble marks of admiration, how many of those evanescent figaries and freaks of the imagination which constitute the very essence of the pleasure of such exploration, alas! all lost for want of a congenial spirit. Only imagine my situation, condemned to the solitary enjoyment of all these wonders in company with a freezing mass of ice,\\(^{264}\\) out of which all my fire failed to elicit one single spark, on whom all the wonders of nature were as much thrown to waste as the flies and insects were on Pharaoh and who could see more beauties in a well kept ledger and Day book, than in all that ever occupied the thoughts and heads of a Linnaeus or a Brown.\n\nVerily there is a benumbing influence surrounding such inert masses of vitality, and it will require a little time of more genial intercourse and more enlivening atmosphere to restore to me the caloric I have wasted without effect.\n\nI believe I told you that I was sent to form a settlement on Pulo Nias and for this purpose joined in a commission with Mr. Prince of Nattal. After several delays and difficulties I reached\n\n\\(^{263}\\) As there is only one in the correspondence preserved, it appears as if some have been lost.\n\n\\(^{264}\\) Mr. John Prince, a precise automaton, who was of not a little service to the botanists of India at this time, see for instance p. 182. He furnished to Roxburgh information from Sumatra as well as living plants; and he furnished later plants from Sumatra and Singapore to Wallieh. He is mentioned by Raffles as a witness to his assertions regarding the cannibalism of the Bataks (Memoirs of the Life of Raffles, 1st edition, p. 432, or 2nd Edition, ii. (1835) p. 90).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nNias on the 14th of Nov. and commenced the business. The object was to get the cession of the whole island to the Company in full sovereignty, and as it is held by a great number of independent chiefs, the necessary negotiations occupied a long time. We visited every port on the Eastern and Southern sides of the Island, and succeeded in effecting almost every point. Tello Dalam, a fine harbour to the Southward has been selected as our station, and the whole Island is a British possession. It is altogether one of the richest, finest countries I have ever seen, cultivated almost too highly for a botanist, and populous as many parts of India. It has long been a great mart of slaves, furnishing not less than 1500 a year. The abolition of this trade formed one of our great objects, and it too is in the best train possible. The people are pagans, and a very original race differing from all their neighbours, and display a mixture of barbarism and civilization that makes them very interesting. On seeing a parcel of half naked savages, armed with spears and wooden shields, their physiognomies rendered horrible by helmets and artificial beards of long black Ijau, striking up a war dance, with violent howling and gesticulations, you could fancy yourself transported to the Otaheiti, or some such South sea Island, while on the other hand on seeing their villages, their houses, the style of comfort, and I might say elegance in which they live, one is tempted to give them a superiority over almost every other Eastern race. Their houses are so substantial and well constructed, that a European might live in them with comfort; their villages are built in most picturesque situations upon the pinnacles of the hills for defence, but the ascent is facilitated by noble flights of stone steps, and paved roads are sometimes carried on to the distance of some miles, shaded too on each side by rows of fruit trees. The surface of the country is very uneven, but this only makes it more beautiful to the eye, as the sides of the hills are cultivated up to the very summits and there is a sufficiency of wood to give a picturesque variety, without passing into the dull uniformity which unbroken and primeval forests always produce.\n\nThe principal export of the country is rice, an article of which there is a woeful deficiency in all our Sumatran territories, and which makes the possession of a granary like Pulo Nias an object of importance. Notwithstanding all these advantages and temptations to an intercourse with this island, I believe it is less known in all respects than Otaheiti. Its Geography is almost a blank further than that an island called Pulo Nias exists in such a latitude, and the people have only been known by the great value set upon them as slaves, in which capacity they are highly esteemed throughout the Archipelago. But as to the population, the nature and resources of the island, nothing is known; Marsden devotes, I think, a page to it.\u2014I have as you may suppose, besides the official\n\n265. Ijau is Ijok = fibre of Arenga saccharifera.\nbusiness, been busy collecting all the information respecting it that was to be procured, and as we continued visiting the different parts of the island till the 31st Dec., a month and a half, it is pretty complete upon all points. It is not improbable that Sir Stamford may wish me to draw up some account of it for our Miscellanies, so I need not trouble you with much of its history now, as I may have that opportunity of sending you the whole in shape, if you feel any curiosity on the subject.\n\nIn the botanical department, although its over cultivation was greatly to be abused, it has been by no means unproductive. The first thing I met with was a new Alpinia\\textsuperscript{266} of the division with radical inflorescence, but which threw up its spikes to the height of two feet hactenus, I think, inauditum. I have roots of it which are thriving, and which shall go up to you by the first good opportunity. In what possible way can you make a specific name of Nias, Niasana or Niasensis, in no way can I arrive at euphony? I believe it cannot be admitted into the Botanical temple of fame. Alpinia longiscapa will perhaps answer.\u2014I found also a very extraordinary Zingiber of which the fellow neglected to bring the roots. The spike was larger than a pineapple, and the edges of the bracts involute in such a manner as to give the whole the appearance of a carved capital of the Corinthian or some nondescript order. The Callicarpa arborea Roxb.\\textsuperscript{267} is very abundant; you mention having it from Nepal; here we come again in contact. I sent you in one of my late letters the description of my Hoya grandiflora, I have now discovered what I take to be another species on Pulo Nias. It has in every respect the habit and character of Hoya, except that the column and nectaries are not so flat, but are more conical than in the other. The position of the masses is the same and the inner angle of the nectarial leaflets is acute and incumbent on the membrane of the anther. Can you understand this?\u2014the other species are depressed in the centre, this rises. It is a delicate slender species and may be called H. gracilis,\\textsuperscript{268} the leaves about the size and shape of this:\n\n![Fig. 2]\n\nthe margin thick and fleshy. I shall send you my description when I get to Bencoolen, if I think it is likely to be in time for Roxburgh\u2019s Flora.\n\n\\textsuperscript{266} Alpinia elatior, Jack in the Malayan Miscellanies, ii. (1822) No. 7, p. 2.\n\n\\textsuperscript{267} Callicarpa arborea, Roxb., is a widely distributed plant, not at all unlikely to be Sumatran.\n\n\\textsuperscript{268} Hoya gracilis was never described under this name.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1915.\nAnother curious gentleman that I found at Tello Dalam is a Hypericum with dark purple flowers triadelpha stamens, alternating with a very curious set of large yellow saccate nectaries. I have here and on other parts of the coast, found a great number of Orchideans, which I have described a la Brown, but they are such a plaguy race, that I have not even attempted their discovery, indeed I have not the requisite books. However I shall perhaps come back upon them someday, and yet experience shows that that arrears are bad things, the day of bringing them up never arrives: it is so much pleasanter to go forward than go back.\n\nI have two species of Rhopala that I take to be new, both with large sessile leaves, the one entire, the other strongly serrated. Of the latter I have the ripe fruit. At Tappanooly I found Fagraea auriculata with flower not quite expanded, it must when open be a flos giganteus. Fagraea racemosa on P. Nias grows to a small tree with a straight trunk and round bushy head. F. volubilis is certainly only a twisted specimen of F. racemosa.\n\nNattal Jan. 5th.\u2014I find here a vessel which after remaining sometime on this coast, goes up to Calcutta, and as other opportunities are uncertain, I shall close this and let it take its chance. I hope to start in a few days for Bencoolen and to have a good run. I shall be very glad to get back, and I find that Sir S. is impatient for my return, which he expected before this, and truly so did I, but there is no calculating on time where winds, waves, and Nias people are concerned.\u2014I shall only at present add my best regards to Mrs. Wallich and yourself, and assure you that\n\nI am always,\nMy dear Wallich,\nYours Affectionately William Jack.\nBencoolen, May 1st, 1821.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nWere I not an extreme philosopher I believe I should be for sending Bencoolen to the D\u2014l. It is four months since we have had any arrival from Bengal, and I have no letter later than the 1st of July last from you. I fear there must have been some losses, which will be very provoking. The only letters I have from you since I left Bengal are No. 2 May 27th 1820.\n\nNo. 4 July 1st 1820. extra brief!\nNo. 3 June 7th 1820.\n\n---\n\n269. Obviously a Cratoxylon, and that described by Jack as Elodea sumatrana in the Malay. Miscellanies, ii. (1822) No. 7, p. 22, = Cratoxylon sumatrana, Blume.\n\n270. Rhopala as Jack used it = Helicia. Jack's R. attenuata and R. moluccana are species of Helicia from Penang. His R. ovata is Helicia ovata, Benn. from Tappanooly. These two are additional and were never described in print.\n\n271. Fagraea auriculata has flowers about six inches long.\n\n272. Fagraea racemosa, Jack in Wallich's and Carey's revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indica, ii. (1824) p. 35, = Fagraea volubilis.\nNo. 1 must I fear have fed the fishes. I know not whether my letters have been more fortunate: those from P. Nias &c. have probably made a very circuitous passage.\n\nI now send you No. 2 and 3 of Malayan plants, and I am\n\n273. Just as part 2 of Jack\u2019s *Descriptions of Malayan Plants* was put into print and held up for revision on criticism from Wallich (vide note No. 237 on p. 218) so this above-named \u201cNo. 3\u201d was prepared and held up. Under the date of May 1st, 1821 the part was sent to Wallich. But there is an earlier letter printed in the *Memoir of the Life of Sir Stamford Raffles*, at p. of the first edition, under which Raffles sent this \u201cNo. three\u201d to Marsden with the following lines \u201cI have now the pleasure to send you the third paper on our Malayan plants. These are only to be considered notices of the moment, where we have not the advantage of reference to late publications, or communications with scientific friends. The paper contains an account of the nepenthes, sago, camphor, several new mangifera, many ligna-vita\u00e6, the melastomas, etc.\u201d The letter continues \u201cYou will recognise many of your old friends particularly the kayu gadis, or virgin tree. Under Styphelia you will find an interesting observation respecting Singapore.\u201d\n\nThe date at the head of this letter in Lady Raffles\u2019 Memoir of her husband is October 9th, 1820. Now on September 19th, 1820, Jack wrote to Wallich that he had decided to put everything into print for preservation and was making up a \u201cnumber\u201d containing Styphelia. This he actually did; and it is the second of his papers instead of the third. Moreover this second paper contains the description of the kayu gadis. So that we have in Raffles\u2019 letter to Marsden two plants mentioned as if described in the \u201cthird paper\u201d which we know were described in the second. The date of the letter i.e. October 9th, 1820, is certainly a reasonable one for the forwarding to Marsden of the second paper; and fortunately it is easy also to explain how Raffles could have had then the third paper also, whereas Jack only sent it to Wallich under date of May 1st, 1821, for we must recollect that immediately after September 19th, 1820, Raffles sent Jack with Prince to effect an agreement with the chiefs of Pulau Nias, and that it was January 1821 before he returned, whereafter, as he explains himself, four months passed without any communication with Bengal.\n\nJack would take the very first opportunity of sending these descriptions to Wallich which the scant shipping afforded. And he sent at the same time a clean copy of the second paper which was not out of the press at the time of his departure for Pulau Nias. Raffles\u2019 allusion of Styphelia and Kayu Gadis is to be explained by his sending also part 2 along with \u201cNo. 3.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201cNo. three\u201d bore as a title *Appendix to the Malayan Miscellanies*. We find that it was printed in 1820, and we have the testimony of Raffles and Jack that there was no intention of publication at the actual time of printing. It is therefore correctly quoted as \u201cined.\u201d in our dictionaries of plant-names, but the date should be 1820 and not 1823. A copy fell into the hands of Sir William Hooker who printed from it in his Companion to the Botanical Magazine, vol. 1, in 1835. As Sir William was able to draw on private letters from Jack to his family, it appears probable that he got the copy from which he printed also from the family.\n\nThis *Appendix to the Malayan Miscellanies* is quite distinct from Jack\u2019s third series of descriptions of Malayan Plants, which appeared as part 7 of the second volume of the *Malayan Miscellanies*; but in Singapore there are not the books wherefrom to ascertain how much Jack may have taken out of the Appendix for this other paper. He sent the descriptions of the Melastomas from the appendix to Lambert in a paper which was published after his death in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London; and in that same periodical by the help of Jack\u2019s friends another series of his descriptions appeared.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nin hopes before this vessel sails of being able to send you a volume of Agricultural proceedings from the Sumatran press. I do not know that you will find much to interest you in it, but it will give you an idea of what we are about here, and will show you the flourishing condition of our spice cultivation, which we find to be now equal to the supply of Great Britain. There is a paper on it by Lumsdaine\\textsuperscript{274} where you will find some curious remarks on the \"rapturous impulses\" of these hot blooded trees! Lumsdaine generally writes very much to the point, but is often very quaint in his expressions.\u2014The first Report is perhaps the most readable part of the Vol. but you will perhaps wonder what the D\u2014l it has to do with Agriculture. In fact our Agricultural Society allows itself great latitude, and it has need, for the agriculture (strictly speaking) of Bencoolen might be discussed in a few words.\n\nOf the fascicle No. 2. I sent you the first three sheets before my departure for Nias; I now send the whole corrected and with additions from further observation. The part printed after my departure is full of errors.\n\nOf Didymocarpus I have since discovered three additional species D. racemosa, D. elongata, and D. barbata.\\textsuperscript{275} I thought I had other two, but on lately finding their fruit I find it \\textit{bacca}i, they must therefore belong to Cyrtandra. In D. barbata I have fully ascertained the seeds to be pendulous.\n\nI have also discovered here Incarvillea parasitica Roxb.,\\textsuperscript{276} but without the fully ripe fruit. The seeds however do not seem to be winged and Roxb. does not say that they are. An ergo Nicarvillea?. It differs too much in habit to be a true Didymocarpus; what then is it to be, an novum genus ob stamina sub-exserta?\n\nTo Ixora pendula, I have now to add Ixora neriifolia, a very marked species.\\textsuperscript{277}\n\nI have very lately found a new and very distinct Tacca with palmate leaves.\\textsuperscript{278}\n\nI found Acrotrema which you may recollect pronouncing a Saxifragoideaster,\\textsuperscript{279} at Tappanooly with fruit further advanced\n\n\\textsuperscript{274}. James Lumsdaine, See note No. 127 on p. 184.\n\n\\textsuperscript{275}. All these were described by Jack in his paper published posthumously, in the \\textit{Transactions of the Linnean Society of London}. The first stands; the second is now transferred to the genus \\textit{Didissandra} as \\textit{D. elongata} (vide note No. 256 p. 221 above); and the third is transferred to the genus \\textit{Chirita} becoming \\textit{C.

This \\textit{Tacca} was never described.\n\n\\textsuperscript{279}. Poetaster\u2014a poor sort of poet; Saxifragoideaster\u2014a poor Saxifrage-like thing. Jack evidently found it first in Penang.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nbut not ripe. The seeds are enveloped in an umbilical aril, and the capsules burst internally, but are not quite distinct. An affinior Rutaceis? I also found the stamens twenty in number.\n\nOf Ternstroemia I have two more species. Roxburgh's T. trilocularis might be any or all of them and must I think be dropped. Query might not the trilocular Ternstroemia be separated from those with two cells and few seeds? They appear to me to differ very widely, see a figure of the fruit in Mirbel's Elemens de Bot.\n\nIn Tetracera arborescens, I fell into a mistake; the only one I had then seen was an old sturdy individual that had choked its support, and was then standing alone as an independent tree, whereupon I called it \"arborescens,\" but on seeing a greater number since, I find it to be a real climber, though a very strong one. Ought therefore the specific name \"arborescens\" to be retained, or should it be changed? Had I known its real character at first, I certainly would not have so called it. It comes near to T. euryandra: the corolla is really three-petalled and the calyx five-sepalled! for the calyx is persistent and has ciliate leaflets, which is not the case with the corolla.\n\nNo. 3, will I think please you, but you must observe that though called an appendix to the Malayan Miscellanies it has been kept back till we hear what is done at home about the great flower. If it is brought forward in England, then this is to be suppressed and not published: if not, then this may be used in the event of the French getting hold of it, as a proof of priority of publication. So you understand that it is at present \"inedita.\"\n\nRafflesia, Dryobalanops, Sagus, and Nepenthes are subjects of no small interest. Tell me what you think of Stagmaria:\n\n280. These Ternstroemias would be T. serrata from Pulau Nias, and T. acuminata from Tappanooly.\n\n281. Tetracera arborescens, Jack in Malayan Miscellanies, i. (1820) part 5, p. 244.\n\n282. The appendix to the Malayan Miscellanies never became a publication.\n\n283. Jack wrote a very full account of his Stagmaria verniciflua and put it into print, for the third part of his Descriptions of Malayan Plants. Then apparently he withdrew it; for as he tells us after the description had been printed in 1821 and when he was sending to Wallich a copy in what we must recognise as proof, a suspicion crossed his mind that Stagmaria instead of being new, was but Gluta Benghas: and it is quite evident that he had no intention of publishing unless he could make sure that Stagmaria and Gluta are distinct. With one or more copies out in print the description was reprinted in Hooker's Companion to the Botanical Magazine, i. (1835) p. 267, and so stands in books as if published by Jack. Wallich later mis-identified Melanorrhoea Wallichii, which he had collected in Singapore, as this Stagmaria of Jack. It is now accepted that Stagmaria verniciflua is Gluta Benghas, the well-known Renghas tree of Malaya.\n\nThe date of this pamphlet of Jack's cited as Descriptions of Malayan Plants, iii, has not been known with certainty; and now it appears that we must consider the date of the publication of Stagmaria not as 1823 but as 1835, and the place Hooker's Companion to the Botanical Magazine.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nbeing a Pentandria Trigynia vel Monogynia it will be of use to you in Roxburgh, and you can introduce it either from Mal. Misc. generally or as my communication direct to you. Since printing it an idea has come into my head whether this may not be Linnaeus's Gluta Benghas, erroneously for Renghas, which has been discovered by no one since Linnaeus, see Lin. Rees. Cycl. The point can only be ascertained by a comparison with the specimen in the Linnean Herbarium, and I have a great mind to send a specimen to Sir J. E. Smith for the purpose.\n\nFrom the character of our Sago which must be admitted to be a true one I am inclined to suspect that S. Ruffia is not a true Sagus, though its fruit is similarly imbricated. I observe in the catalogue that Roxb. has two species of Sagus, but I have not his description. Does he give a full account or had he ever their fructification?\n\nI am at present at a country residence of Sir Stamford's in the midst of forests and jungles, from which I am daily receiving treasures. Materials are accumulating so fast upon me that I should like to clear off arrears by getting out descriptions. When a thing is printed, it is in a manner done with, and you go on unincumbered. I have prepared a Monograph on East Insular Melastomae containing 15 species, all new except two, one of which is Roxburgh's?\u2014M. decemfida, which is as good as new. I am thinking of sending it home for the Linnean or some such periodical publication, but I wish first to hear something from the folks in England, particularly Brown. Has the Asiatic Society adopted the plan of printing their papers as they come in; if they have, I would not care to give them one. Do they deserve it?\n\nI am anxious to learn how Roxb. Vol. ii comes on, that I may know what to send you for it.\n\nI am making an abstract of Rumphius, for the purpose of inquiring for his plants by their native names, and in the course of it, have ascertained several of his hitherto unnamed species, such as his\n\nMachilus medius, iii. t. 41. = Laurus incrassata mihi;\nArbor spicularum, iii. t. 106, quae Euphorbiacea;\nClypearia rubra, iii. t. 112;\n\n---\n\n284. Sagus Ruffia is not a Sagus. See note No. 149 on p. 190.\n\n285. This paper on Melastomaceae appeared posthumously in the Transactions of the Linnean Society, vol. xiv. (1823).\n\n286. Jack published his Laurus incrassata in the Malayan Miscellanies, ii. (1822) No. 7, p. 33. It is referred to Dehaasia microcarpa, Blume, with a query, on the authority of Wallich in his Catalogue under No. 2589.\n\n287.

I have advice of the dispatch from England of the later vols. of Rees Cyc. but they are not yet arrived. I see by some English advertisements that the work is brought to a close.\n\nHave you heard yet of George\u2019s arrival in Copenhagen, and received an answer from my father? I have not yet heard, none of my letters coming down so late. My best compliments to Mrs. Wallich and believe me always.\n\nYours sincerely,\nWilliam Jack.\nBencoolen, July 3rd, 1821.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nThe Robarts and John Bull arrived here some time ago, but neither of them brought a line from you. Since that the Repulse has arrived direct from England and brought me a letter from Lambert in answer to mine forwarded by you. Strange that I should have later accounts by six months from home than from you in Bengal. He says, he looks for the specimens which you had promised to send, by which I infer that you had not been able to send them early. I fear that in leaving them for you to arrange and dispatch, I threw a greater labour on you than either of us reckoned on, and I shall not be sorry to learn that they are still in your possession, without your having been able to command time to arrange them. I reckon that this letter is not unlikely to find you in Calcutta, and if my supposition in regard to the specimens is correct, I would, (when you have leisure, to look over them) wish to make an alteration in the original plan of dispatch, and put you in mind of a few former requests. I must in the first place tell you of some of my new plants and ideas. I believe you know that I had some idea of bringing out a fascicle of plants &c. at home with observations on Malayan Botany; in considering the subject, however I have greatly changed and enlarged my original plan until it has swelled to the design of a work for which I shall go on collecting materials in this country and not publish\n\n289. Described by Jack in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London xiv. (1823) p. 123 as *Myrmecodia tuberosa*.\n\n290. See notes No. 234 and 235 p. 217.\n\n291. Wallich\u2019s son, who was being sent to school. Apparently he was sent first to see Wallich\u2019s family in Denmark.\n\n292. See note 194 recording that plants from Jack were in Lambert\u2019s sale. As there stated these plants passed from Lambert\u2019s executors to the dealer Pamplin. Whither they went from Pamplin\u2019s shop is unknown: and it is quite impossible to tell if they were specimens sent direct by Jack or specimens left with Wallich for forwarding.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\ntill I go home. Such is the present whim, whether ever to be executed is another question; but the result of the change of plan is, that I shall confine myself at present to detached papers as opportunities of printing them occur, and make my botanical collections and observations as extensive as I can, with the ultimate view of combining the whole into a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9e of Malayan Flora secundum ordines naturales with stupendous elucidations and illustrations!! I have gone through all my collections here, and arranged them in the most beautiful order, and mean to go through the whole again genus by genus, putting together all I know and have upon each, by which means every future acquisition will at once find its proper place. Now I find that I carried up and left with you many specimens of which I have no duplicates, and that several genera are in consequence less complete than they might have been. What I would therefore propose, in the event of your still having my collection, would be, instead of sending the whole home, to make the first and most perfect set for me, with all your own annotations and remarks, and to send home only duplicates. Thus I shall be enabled to complete my arrangement of all I ever collected, have the advantage of your observations, and in the case of those of which I may have kept duplicates, they can form part of the first dispatch I send from hence, and there is every probability of some direct occasions. It will also enable me to name a great many that I have since described or ascertained, before sending them away.\n\nI hope you have not forgotten a request I formerly made for the Menang Kabau specimens\\(^{293}\\) to be all returned: they were put up separately in a different kind of paper from the rest. I have held my tongue to Sir S. about their being left behind.\n\nLet me also refer you to a list of desiderata given you in my letter of Feb. 1820, from on board ship.\n\nThere is another thing I must mention, I received the work of the writer\\(^{294}\\) to Gynandria, but you must know that he did the whole of Gynandria for me before I left Calcutta, therefore when you set him to work again he must not begin where he left off, but at Ficus (F. comosa is the last written), where his previous copy stops. I could wish however that he would copy first Brown\u2019s remarks in the appendix to Tuckey\u2019s Narrative, which I am anxious to have. You see there is no end of my requests, but I must let you breathe before I come with more.\n\nBy the Repulse I also received a very kind letter from Mr. Colebrooke in which he says he has proposed me a member of the Geological Society, and given them something about Malay geology\n\n\\(^{293}\\) Raffles\u2019 own collecting. See note 135 on p. 185.\n\n\\(^{294}\\) Writer = clerk.\nout of my letter. I do not recollect exactly what I wrote, but it must have been very short and slight. I wrote some time ago by a vessel that went home direct from Mr. Colebrooke and sent him a copy of the Agricultural Volume and of the two Botanical fascicles. In replying to his present letter I mean to make up a selection of Sumatran rocks, and shall give him some notes on Sumatran Geology, which if he likes he may give to the Society.\n\nI see there is a paper of his in the Linnean Society, on what I think of demonstrating the Cyrtandraceae. In my last I think I told of my suspicion of the affinity of Cyrtandra and Didymocarpus; since that I have made an expedition to the top of the Sugar loaf, a remarkable mountain in the interior of Bencoolen, in the course of which I found no less than 8 species of Cyrtandra in addition to those I had before, and two species of a new genus, of the same family which I call Loxonia. With these materials I have adventured to construct a new order (Cyrtandraceae from the oldest genus) an account of which I shall send to Lambert and get him to submit to Brown before presenting it, to see if it will stand muster. The order stands thus, Cyrtandra 11 species, Didymocarpus, 7, and Loxonia 2, exclusive of your Didymi. I shall send you (if I can get it copied) my characters of the order and genera, on which let me have your opinion. Note, Forster's figure of the fruit of Cyrtandra is utterly wrong.\n\nI have huge suspicions concerning Incarvillea, but I cannot find its carpology anywhere. I have not yet got the fruit of Roxb.'s Incarvillea parasitica, but as far as I can make out from the dried ovaries the septum appears to be complete and to separate at the sides from the valves, a character which would make it agree with Bignoniae, but not with Didymocarpus.\n\nIn the course of my excursion to Sugar loaf, I made several interesting discoveries. Two new species of Melastoma which I shall send home to be added to my former paper as M. eximia\n\n---\n\n295. Jack's journey to the Sugar Loaf Mountain was described in the Malayan Miscellanies, ii. (1822) No. 1, pp. 1-22 and was reprinted in the Society's Papers relating to Indo-China, series 2, vol. ii, pp. 57-69. Raffles in a letter to Marsden under date July 12th, 1821, says \"Dr. Jack and a few friends have just ascended the Sugar-loaf and were the first Europeans who reached the summit.\"\n\n296. The paper containing Jack's account of the Cyrtandraceae is to be found in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, vol. xiv. (1825).

It contains now 17 species all new except *M. malabathrica* and *M. decemfida* of Roxb., and *Osbeckia tetandra* Roxb., which is my *Melastoma glauca* (certissime no Osbeckia). My other Alpine discoveries are a species of *Rhododendron*, one of *Vaccinium*, lots of *Begoniae*, an *Impatiens*, a *Lobelia*, a new *Alpinia*, and a second species of a pentandrous genus I sent you with 3-valved, 1-celled capsules, related to the Pittosporaceae.

I hope the next arrival will bring me the remaining part of it, or a copy complete.\n\nYou will probably ere this have received an answer from my father to your letter. Some fatality seems to have lately attended my correspondence, for I have not a line from home by any of the late opportunities.

The first visitation was the death of Sir S.\u2019s eldest boy, one of the finest and loveliest children I ever saw. Scarcely had Sir S. and Lady R. begun to recover some degree of composure after such an affliction, than Capt. Auber fell ill, and was carried off after a few days by an apoplectic stroke. This has been a severe blow, not merely from\n\n---\n\n300. *Melastoma alpestre*, Jack is *Medinilla alpestris*, Blume.\n\n301. *Osbeckia tetandra*, Roxb. is no *Melastoma*; but in the subdivision of that genus it has become *Anplectrum glaucum*, Triana.\n\n302. *Rhododendron malayanum*, Jack in Malayan Miscellanies, ii.

Straits Branch\nhis relationship to Lady R., but from the great regard and esteem in which he was personally held. He was a man of most engaging manners and superior mind, and had embarked on an extensive speculation with every prospect of success, which is now destroyed by his premature death. He had been my companion on the trip to the Sugar loaf, and bore the fatigues of it much better than I did. It was a singular circumstance that the natives strongly dissuaded us from attempting the ascent as they said it would provoke the anger of the Dewas whose sanctum is on the summit. We of course laughed at such a reason, but they tried everything at the difficult parts of the ascent to induce us to turn back by representing it was impossible to get further. Our party consisted of four, three of us persevered in reaching the summit and one gave up half way. On our return the people declared one of the three, Auber, Salmond\\(^{309}\\) and myself would be sure to die for having profaned the sacred spot; and now they are of course firmly persuaded of the special interposition of the offended spirit of the Mountain. The coincidence is certainly singular and the more so as Auber to all appearance was the least likely to have suffered of any of us. His death however does not appear to have had any connection with the trip or exposure in the course of it.\n\nThese unfortunate events have depressed all our spirits; Sir Stamford himself has not been well, and the fatigue and anxiety of looking after so many invalids has almost knocked me up. I wish all was quiet again that I might take my ease for a few days and get well by indulging the luxury of doing nothing. Sir S., as you may recollect in Calcutta, is a very bad patient, for there is no keeping up his spirits when he is ill.\n\nI have employed some odd hours in overhauling my Hexandrous plants for you, and send you herewith for entry in Roxburgh, three species of Tradescantia,\\(^{310}\\) three of Curculigo, four of Loranthus,\\(^{311}\\) and a new genus, which pray tell me what you think of. If I find time before this vessel sails, I shall add some more, but I am much at a loss how far back or forward to go until I learn something of your progress in Roxburgh.\n\n21st July\u2014Another arrival from Calcutta, and not a line from you, or from Calder to whom I look for my Europe dispatches.

There is still one chance, that Mackenzie may bring some, though they might as well have been put under a wild goose wing as given to him. I begin to abominate this place very grievously, however it is a nasty gloomy day, I am out of humour on many accounts, and there is no saying how I may alter my mind when the weather clears up and matters begin to go smoother. A man should never sit down to write a letter in the temperament I am now in, so I will have mercy on you, and spare you a jeremiad.\n\nI add descriptions of three more Aralia\\textsuperscript{312} and my new genus of the same family.\n\nW. Jack.\n\nBencoolen.\n\nOctober 6th, 1821.\n\nMy dear Wallich,\n\nI wrote you pretty fully in August by my cousin Andrew Henderson, but I cannot allow this opportunity which may be the last for some time to pass without sending you a few lines. I am still without any account from you, nor do I know whether this will find you in Calcutta, though I think it most probable it will. Mackenzie arrived here some time ago but brought no letters at all, so that I cannot help thinking there must be some strange mistake which prevents my hearing by the direct arrivals from Bengal. The monsoon is now about to change, and I hope abundance of communications this season will recompense the disappointments of the last. Mr. Palmer\\textsuperscript{313} is here on his way up from Java, with which he seems to be highly delighted. We are going on in our usual quiet way; plants and stones, the order of the day. I have drawn up a short paper for Mr. Colebrooke on the Geology of Sumatra, giving him an outline of our present information on the subject. This may serve as an inaugural dissertation to the Society as they have dubbed me a Member. By the bye, will you\n\n\\textsuperscript{312} These cannot be identified.\n\n\\textsuperscript{313} Mr. John Palmer, a merchant of Calcutta, called \"the prince of merchants\" (vide MacDonald's \"Narrative,\" p. 128) of the firm of Palmer and Co., active in many enterprises. Mr. Palmer's firm were agents to Sir Stamford Raffles, and to Said Husein, father of the pretender to the throne of Aceh, as well as to the Dutch and therefore came into opposition with Raffles. Mr. Palmer was influential enough to get for the Aceh pretender a pension after the trouble had been dispersed; he was also influential enough to get a merchant sent as the Company's agent to Siam, whereby the Company was put to great expense and their possible trade diverted to the agent. In partnership with Sir William Rumbold he was in those unscrupulous banking transactions in the Nizam's dominions which brought down the Court of Directors upon the government in India and drove Lord Hastings into retirement. In 1828 the firm unable to reap in the exorbitant interest that they had counted on, went bankrupt.

I believe it is usual for Members of these societies abroad to pay at once a certain sum in lieu of all future payments, which is far the best mode for us in India, and saves all after trouble. So pray let the remittance be to that amount and effect. I would sooner have been proposed for the Linnean, as being more in my way, but that may come in good time. I told you of my having sent Lambert a paper on the Cyrtandraceae, I have since found a new plant of that family which will form a new genus sub nomine, Aeschynanthus, and to which I think Incarvillea parasitica, Roxb. will be properly referable. Mine has axillary crimson flowers, exsert stamens, four with the rudiment of a fifth. Capsule strictly pseudo 4 locular more Didymocarpi, but the seeds with an arista or long hair at each end, and having something like an apophysis above. I shall send the account of this additional gentleman to Lambert to complete his paper. I am putting together some of the most interesting of my new genera, and I think I shall send them to Mr. Colebrooke through you, so that they may have the benefit of your corrections and remarks. They cannot be ready in time for this occasion, but I shall try and have them ready in case of another offering. Proposals are circulating here for a second volume of the Malayan Miscellanies to be published by the missionaries if they get a sufficiency of subscriptions; if they do, I shall give them some plants to help them out. When it will be finished is a matter of great doubt in Mr. Ward's hands, for he is the laziest animal I ever met with, and one of the stupidest. If such are the people we are to meet in heaven, Lord help me out of it. Did you know our junior surgeon here Lancaster, who died lately; he was an odd and in some things not a very agreeable man, but is a great loss to the settlement. A good for nothing chap (a friend of Calder's by the bye) Mr. MacCalman has been put in temporarily but there is no wish to keep him here for good. If you know any person, a married man in particular, who would like a quiet settled situation of 650 rupees a month it might be worth applying for. I should wish him to be junior to me. MacCalman is a true highlander, with all the captious jealousy and tenaciousness of his countrymen, among whom such qualities are sometimes to be found, and has not contrived to make himself agreeable here. He brought a letter to me from Calder, in conse-\n\n314. *Aeschynanthus* was described by Jack with two species\u2014*A. radicans* and *A. volubilis*. It would be the second to which he refers here.\n\n315. Lambert did as desired: after incorporating the new genus, he communicated Jack's paper on Cyrtandraceae to the Linnean Society. Brown had that on Melastomaceae; and Jack sent as he here proposes the third paper to Colebrooke.\n\n316. See note No. 160, p. 192.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nquence of which I shewed such attention as was in my power, but it does not appear to have come up to his expectations. I wonder whether Calder is particularly interested about him, or whether he is merely a Scotch consignment to the house. I mention this that you may not accidentally commit me with Calder, in case the subject happens to come between you.\n\nI have not time for more so shall only add my best regards to Mrs. Wallich and ever my dear Wallich.\n\nYours very truly,\nWilliam Jack.\n\nP.S. Don\u2019t forget the remittance to Mr. Colebrooke.\n\nBencoolen,\nOctober 26th, 1821.\n\nMy dear Wallich.\n\nI write a few lines by this opportunity, which is a very circuitous one, merely to say that there will be no occasion for you troubling yourself further about the request I made in my last as to the subscription for the Geological Society, to be remitted to Mr. Colebrooke. I have since received a letter from the secretary of the Society announcing my election and requiring the payment of ten guineas admission fee, and have in consequence written to my father to settle the account. A remittance from Bengal will therefore be unnecessary. So if you have spoken to Calder on the subject, countermand it. Two vessels have arrived from Bengal without bringing a line from you, but Hardwicke mentions that you are not expected down till December.\n\nHe has been making some sad piece of humbug to the Asiatic Society on presenting the proceedings of the Agricultural Society, which would have been better spared, tho\u2019 no doubt well intended.

He apparently had not complained before to Wallich, but in a letter home dated April 8th, 1821, he told his parents that he had recovered from another attack of lung trouble. His illnesses added to the sadness of that year when Raffles' three children died. Jack himself seems to have been ill from this date continuously, the lung trouble recurring; but according to Raffles acute Malaria carried him off which was contracted on a trip to Mocomoco. He took a voyage to Java in the hope that it might place him on the road to recovery; but it did not; and he returned to Bencoolen worse. As a last resort he was put on board another vessel for the Cape. From what Raffles wrote it appears that he was landed again dying, and was buried in the Settlement.\n\nThis is how Raffles wrote (i.) on September 4th, 1822, \"My inestimable friend, Jack, still remains in a very dangerous state, and is obliged to embark in the Layton for the Cape. In him I lose my right hand,\" and again (ii.) September 14th, \"I have very little hope for him; I shall feel his loss most severely, both as a private friend and as an able assistant,\" and yet again (iii.) September 15th. \"We were to have embarked this morning for Singapore, but the wind has proved foul; and it was ordained that we should remain another day, to bury our dear and invaluable friend, William Jack. Poor fellow! a finer head or heart there never was; and whether as a bosom friend, or as a scientific assistant, he was to me invaluable; he had been long ill and returned from Java about a fortnight ago, after an unsuccessful visit for change of air: we embarked him yesterday in the Layton for the Cape; and he died this morning before the ship weighed her anchor.\"\n\nIn a letter to Wallich telling him of the loss Raffles says that he died at Government House: if so he was landed again to die. He was but twenty-seven.\n\nHe was unmarried; and Buckley's one-time speculation that Jack's was among the children taken home in 1824 by Sir Stamford, is without foundation (vide Anecdotal History i. p. 10).\n\nWallich received the news of his death at Singapore on October 10th, 1822, where he had arrived on a voyage for his health. His letter of condolence to the parents is reprinted in the companions to the Botanical Magazine. It appears that he had had no premonition of the approaching end: and that Jack's last letter to Wallich here printed was in reality the last written.\n\nThe following lines written by Raffles under the date of February 4th, 1824, give rather histrionically the fate of Jack's collections:\n\n\"We (that is Sir Stamford's party) embarked on the 2nd instant in the Fame, and sailed at daylight for England with a fair wind, and every prospect of a quick and comfortable passage.\nThe ship was everything that we could wish; and having closed my charge here (Bencoolen) much to my satisfaction, it was one of the happiest days of my life. We were, perhaps, too happy; for in the evening came a sad reverse. Sophia (Lady Raffles) had just gone to bed and I had thrown off half my clothes, when a cry of fire! fire! roused us from our calm content, and in five minutes the whole ship was in flames. I ran to examine whence the flames principally issued, and found that the fire had its origin immediately under our cabin. Down with the boats. Where is Sophia? Here. A rope to the side. Lower Lady Raffles. Give her to me, says one. I'll take her, says the Captain. Throw the gunpowder overboard. It cannot be got at; it is in the magazine close to the fire. Stand clear of the powder. Skuttle the water casks. Water! water! Where's Sir Stamford? Come into the boat, Nilson! Nilson, come into the boat. Push off push off. Stand clear of the after part of the ship.\n\nAll this passed much quicker than I can write it; we pushed off, and as we did so the flames burst out of our cabin-window, and the whole of the after part of the ship was in flames; the masts and sails now taking fire, we moved to a distance sufficient to avoid the immediate explosion; but the flames were now coming out of the main hatchway; and seeing the rest of the crew, with the Captain, still on board we pulled back to her under the bows, so as to be more distant from the powder. As we approached we perceived that the people on board were getting into a boat on the opposite side. She pushed off; we hailed her: Have you all on board? Yes, all, save one. Who is he? Johnson sick in his cot. Can we save him?\u2014No, impossible. The flames were issuing from the hatchway; at this moment the poor fellow, scorched, I imagine, by the flames, roared out most lustily, having run upon the deck. I will go for him, says the Captain ......... ....... he then pulled under the bowsprit of the ship and picked the poor fellow up. ............... The Captain fortunately had a compass ............... and ......... to make the best of our misfortune we availed ourselves of the light from the ship to steer a tolerably good course towards the shore. She continued to burn till about midnight, when the saltpetre which she had on board (the powder had blown up towards nine o'clock) took fire, ............... illuminating the horizon in every direction to the extent of not less than fifty miles. She burnt and continued to flame in this style for about an hour or two, when we lost sight of the object in a cloud of smoke. .................. At daylight we recognised the coast and Rat Island. About eight or nine we saw a ship standing to us from the Roads; they had seen the flames on shore, and sent out vessels to our relief. They gave us a bucket of water, and we took the Captain on board as a pilot. The wind however, was adverse, and we could not reach the shore, and took to the ship where we got some refreshment and shelter from the sun. About two o'clock we landed safe and sound. ............ Jour.

(Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 20).\nSterculia rubiginosa, Vent., is recorded by Jack as having been found in Penang, but under the wrong name of S. angustifolia, Roxb. (Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 21). It is not a common tree in Penang; and Curtis' only locality is Penara Bukit.\n\nPterospermum Jackianum, Wall., is founded on specimens collected by Jack in Penang (Wall. Cat. No. 1164).\n\nTILIACEAE.\n\nGrewia paniculata, Roxb., was found by Jack in Penang, who adhering to Smith's name of Microcos tomentosa described it under this in Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 13. He refers to the plant in his letters (p. 189).\n\nGrewia Microcos, Linn., was obtained by Jack from Car Nicobar, and briefly diagnosed as a new species under the name of Microcos glabra in Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 14.\n\nElaeocarpus nitidus, Jack, which occurs in the Waterfall valley, Penang, was found and described by Jack (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 41). Under one of his early letters he sent specimens of an Elaeocarp to Wallich (p. 165) but it is impossible to say which.\n\nElaeocarpus Jackianus, Wall., is a not-uncommon Singapore plant, of which Jack sent specimens to Wallich (Wall. Cat. No. 2679), and which Jack described as Monocera ferruginea (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 44).\n\nElaeocarpus petiolatus, Wall., is described by Jack from Penang as Monocera petiolata in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 43.\n\nLINACEAE.\n\nIxonanthes icosandra, Jack, was found in the interior of Sumatra behind Bencoolen, and described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 53. Writing of it in 1872, Sir Joseph Hooker pointed out that there are differences between Jack's description and the tree as we know it in Malaya (Flora of British India i. p. 416). It is therefore desirable that someone should search in the region from which Jack got his plant for something which would explain the divergence.\n\nIxonanthes reticulata, Jack, was found at Tapanuli, Sumatra, and described in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 51.\n\nGERANIACEAE.\n\nImpatiens sp. An Impatiens was found by Jack on his journey to Gunong Bengkok, behind Bencoolen, (letters p. 234).\n\nRUTACEAE.\n\nGlycosmis pentaphylla, Correa, var. macrophylla, was found by Jack in Penang and described under the name of Chionotria rigida in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 54.\nMicromelum hirsutum, Oliv., was sent to Wallich from Penang, and distributed by him without a name in Wall. Cat. No. 8516.\n\nMurraya exotica, Linn., type, and the variety paniculata were both described by Jack, who held them specifically distinct: he wrote as if he had found the type himself, but not quite definitely about the variety, though familiar with its usefulness to the kris-maker (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 31). In his letters (p. 189) he refers to the species without adding to what he published later. At a later date (letters p. 220) he explains that Murraya sumatrana, Roxb., is the same as the variety paniculata.\n\nClausena excavata, Burm., appears to be the plant which Jack names in his letters (p. 162) as having been found in Penang. It is common near the coast there.\n\nSIMARUBACEAE.\n\nBrucea sumatrana, Roxb., is mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters as having been found at Bencoolen (p. 188).\n\nEurycoma longifolia, Jack, was found in Singapore and in Sumatra at Tapanuli and Bencoolen. It was described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 45. Jack placed it in Connaraceae.\n\nOCHNACEAE.\n\nGomphia sumatrana, Jack, was described from Sumatra no locality being named (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 29).\n\nEuthemis leucocarpa, Jack, a shrub common on the sandy parts of the Singapore coast, was found by Jack and described in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 16. In his letters to Wallich (pp. 179 and 204) he mentions it. And his recognition of it at once as belonging to a new genus shows his great perspicacity.\n\nEuthemis minor, Jack, was found along with the last in Singapore, and described with it (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 18). Though common on Pulau Battam, south of Singapore, it has only once been found in recent years on Singapore island.\n\nMELIACEAE.\n\nMelia excelsa, Jack, was obtained in Penang (letters p. 165) and described in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 12. Wallich received specimens which became No. 1253 in his Catalogue. No Melia answering the description has been found recently; and everything considered, it is impossible that Jack\u2019s plant belonged to the genus.\n\nSandoricum indicum, Cav., was got by Jack in Penang, and distributed by Wallich as No. 1249 of his Catalogue. It is the cultivated Sentol.\nAglaia odorata, Lour., is a common tree of cultivation in Malaya, as Jack records (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 32).\n\nAglaia sp. is the Lansium montanum of Jack found in the forests near Bencoolen (Trans. Linn. Soc., xiv. p. 117). Rumpf had used the combination; and Jack believed that he had got Rumpf's plant. The name Lansium montanum is sometimes referred to Steudel.\n\nLansium domesticum, Jack, is the cultivated Langsat which Jack described in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 115. He defined a variety aqueum (L. aqueum), a superior race. In his letters (p. 158) he names it as the \"Dookoo.\"\n\nCELASTRACEAE.\n\nParacelastrus bivalvis, Miq. (Microtropis bivalvis, Wall.), was obtained by Jack in Penang and described as Celastrus bivalvis (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 19). He mentions it in his letters (pp. 165 and 218), first as related to Celastrus and then as Celastrus bivalvis.\n\nCelastrus pauciflora, Wall., is the Pittosporea? serrulata of Jack from Penang which Griffith named Pittosporum? serrulatum in the Calcutta Journal of Natural History, iv., 1844, p. 195.\n\nCelastrus lucida, Wall., is a plant, not a Celastrus, collected by Jack in Penang and distributed under this name by Wallich (Cat. No. 4318).\n\nHippocratea, sp. near H. obtusifolia, Roxb. is mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 221) as having been found in Pulau Nias.\n\nSalacia sp. Jack found on Pulau Nias a Salacia which in his letters is called Johnia sumatrana, and would be one of the two species referred to, without name, in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 92.\n\nSalacia sp. Jack had sent to Wallich a species of Salacia under the name of Hypsagyne (letters 219 and 221) which was obtained at Tapanuli earlier than the Salacia just named. It may have been the second Salacia mentioned in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 92. Of these two species the one, he wrote, agrees very well both with S. chinensis and with Johnia salacioides (which is Salacia Roxburghii, Wall.) ; and the other is nearly related to Johnia coromandeliana, Roxb. (which is Salacia prinooides, DC.)\n\nAMPELIDACEAE.\n\nVitis racemifera, Jack, was described from Sumatra in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 94.\n\nVitis angustifolia, Wall. is recorded by Jack from Bencoolen (letters p. 208) under Roxburgh's name of Cissus angustifolia.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nSAPINDACEAE.\n\n*Cardiospermum* sp. is mentioned as occurring at Acheen (letters p. 174).\n\n*Erioglossum edule*, Blume, is the *Sapindus rubiginosus* of Roxburgh under which name Jack records its cultivation in Penang (Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 11).\n\n*Lepidopetalum Jackianum*, Radlk. (*Cupania Jackiana*, Hiern in Flora Brit. India, i. p. 678) is a Car Nicobar plant which Wallich distributed as *Coninarus? Jackianus* (Wall. Cat., No. 8552).\n\n*Nephelium lappacem*, Linn., the Rambutan, was described by Jack from Penang and elsewhere (Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 16). He mentions it in his letters (p. 154).\n\nANACARDIACEAE.\n\n*Mangifera quadrifida*, Jack, was found in Penang, and diagnosed in a letter to Wallich (p. 152). Afterwards it was described from Jack's MS. in Carey and Wallich's revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indica ii. p. 440.\n\n*Mangifera foetida*, Lour., was found by Jack in Penang letters p. 152) and described along with the last from Penang and Sumatra, etc. Specimens collected by Jack were distributed by Wallich (Cat. No. 8488).\n\n*Mangifera caesia*, Jack, was found by Jack in Sumatra, perhaps at Bencoolen (letters p. 216), and described along with the above two (p. 441).\n\n*Gluta Benghas*, Linn., was found by Jack at Natal and Moco-moco in Sumatra, etc. He described it in print as *Stagmaria verniciflora*, but withdrew the description from publication, for as pointed out in his letters (p. 239) he found out the identity. Sir William Hooker published Jack's name-Stagmaria\u2014and the description in the Companion to the Botanical magazine, i. (1835) p. 267.\n\nSABIACEAE.\n\n*Meliosma nitida*, Blume, is the *Millingtonia sumatrana* described by Jack from Pulau Nias (Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 36).\n\nCONNARACEAE.\n\n*Agelaea vestita*, Hook. f. Wallich distributed this plant from Jack's collecting in Singapore as No. 8535; and on p. 197 of his letters he mentions having got three species of its order,\u2014the Connaraceae,\u2014calling them Coninarus, in Singapore, the specimens of which were left with Wallich.\n\n*Rourea concolor*, Blume, is thought to be the *Cnestis mimosoides* described by Jack from Tapanuli, Sumatra, (Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 44).\nConnarus ferrugineus, Jack, was found in Penang. It was to it probably that Jack applied the name Connarus paniculata, Roxb., in his letters (p. 163). But after visiting Calcutta in 1826 he used the name Connarus ferrugineus (letters p. 197) and described it in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 37.\n\nConnarus semidecandrus, Jack, occurs in Penang; but Jack did not detect it there. He described it from the west coast of Sumatra (Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 39). It would further seem to be one of the species obtained in Singapore, which are referred to in his letters (p. 197): for Wallich's Catalogue No. 8538 in part is it.\n\nConnarus grandis, Jack, was described from Tapanuli, Sumatra, in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 40.\n\nConnarus villosus, Jack, was described from Sumatra in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 38.\n\nConnarus lucidus, Jack, was described from Sumatra in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 41.\n\nCnestis longifolia, is a name used by Jack in his letters (p. 197) for something that he got in Singapore and at Tapanuli.\n\nCnestis emarginata, Jack, is a plant described from Bencoolen in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 43.\n\nCnestis florida, Jack, is a plant from Pulau Nias and Sumatra described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 43.\n\nLEGUMINOSAE.\n\nMillettia atropurpurea, Benth. This common tree was collected by Jack in Penang, and Wallich distributed the specimens under the name of Pongamia atropurpurea (Wall. Cat. No. 5910).\n\nMezoneuron sumatranum, W. & A., was found by Jack at Bencoolen, and is referred to under Roxburgh's name of Caesalpinia sumatrana. From the way in which Jack puts a question mark after the word Caesalpinia, it seems that he suspected Roxburgh to have got the genus wrong (letter p. 188).\n\nCassia alata, Linn., is quite likely to have been the plant to which Jack refers in his first letter from Penang (p. 155).\n\nSaraca declinata, Miq., was described as Jonesia declinata by Jack from Sumatra in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 74. A reference in his letters (p. 216) indicates Bencoolen as probably the locality where it was found.\n\nAtzelia retusa, Kurz, appears to be the Singapore plant referred to in Jack's letters (p. 180).\nBauhinia emarginata, Jack, is described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 75 from Sumatra.\n\nBauhinia bidentata, Jack, is described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 76 as from the forests of Malaya. In his letters (p. 165) he refers to it as occurring in Penang.\n\nPithecolobium lobatum, Benth., was described by Jack under the name of Mimosa Jiringa in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 14. He collected it in Penang, and records Malacca as an additional locality, perhaps from Farquhar's collection of drawings. He discusses it in his letters to Wallich (pp. 159 and 165).\n\nPithecolobium Clypearia, Benth., was described by Jack in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 78 as Inga Clypearia, from Bengoolen. It is mentioned in his letters as found also in Penang (p. 165) and recognised by him as one of Rumpf's plants (p. 230).\n\nPithecolobium bubalinum, Benth., is described by Jack in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 77, as Inga bubalina.\n\nROSACEAE.\n\nRubus alceaefolius, Poir., is mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 152) as a Penang plant.\n\nParinarium costatum, Blume, was described by Jack from Sumatra but without any locality in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 67, under the name of Petrocarya sumatrana.\n\nParinarium Jackianum, Benth., was described by Jack without locality in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 66, under the name of Petrocarya excelsa.\n\nRHIZOPHORACEAE.\n\nRhizophora mucronata, Lamk., is mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 175) as a Penang plant.\n\nBruguiera gymnorrhiza, Lamk., is mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 175) as a Penang plant.\n\nBruguiera caryophylloides, Blume, is described as Rhizophora caryophylloides in the Malay. Misc. 8. No. 5, p. 34, from Penang and Singapore. It is also mentioned in his letters (p. 154) as a Penang plant.\n\nAnisophyllaea trapezoidalis, Baill., is described from Singapore, Sumatra and elsewhere under the name of Haloragis disticha in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 19.\n\nCOMBRETACEAE.\n\nLumnitzera coccinea, W. & A., is described by Jack in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 57 as Pyrrhantthus littoreus\noccurring in the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra. In his letters he writes of finding it in Penang (p. 165) and on the Silebar river, Sumatra (p. 205).\n\n*Calycopteris floribunda*, Lamk., is mentioned as a Penang plant in his letters (p. 184).\n\n*Quisqualis densiflora*, Wall., was described by Jack under the name of *Sphalanthus confertus* in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 55, no locality being given.\n\n**MYRTACEAE.**\n\n*Leptospermum* sp. is the identification given of Jack\u2019s *Glaphyria sericea* from Pulau Pinang on the west coast of Sumatra (not the British Penang). Jack described it in Trans. Linn. Soc., xiv. p. 129. By an oversight it was included in the Flora of British India.\n\n*Leptospermum* sp. would be the identification of his *Glaphyria nitida* from Gumong Bengkok, described in the same place p. 128 and in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 6.\n\n*Melaleuca leucadendron*, Linn., is named by Jack in his letters (p. 160) as obtained in Penang; he uses Roxburgh\u2019s name *M. Cajuputi*.\n\n*Rhodamia trinervia*, Blume. It appears that Jack had obtained from Sumatra this plant and also its variety *spectabilis*. He refers to them in his letters (p. 222) and in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 48.\n\n*Eugenia Jambos*, Linn., was collected by Jack in Penang; and Wallich distributed the specimens as No. 3615 of his Catalogue.\n\n*Eugenia caryophyllata*, Thunbg., was mentioned by Jack as cultivated in Penang (letters p. 152).\n\n*Barringtonia speciosa*, Forst., is mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters (p. 174) as a plant of Acheen.\n\n*Barringtonia racemosa*, Roxb., is mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters p. 175) as a plant of Penang.\n\n*Barringtonia macrostachya*, Kurz, was described by Jack (Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 47) as *Careya macrostachya*, from Penang.\n\n**MELASTOMACEAE.**\n\n*Melastoma malabathricum*, Linn., attracted Jack\u2019s attention in Penang during his first days there (letters p. 152); and afterwards he paid great attention to the order to which it belongs. In describing it in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv, p. 4, he gives the localities as \u201cSumatra and the Malay islands.\u201d Under *M. malabathricum* he included the very closely allied *M. polyanthum*, and appears to have described the latter rather than *M. malabathricum* under the name of \u201cmalabathricum.\u201d\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nMelastoma polyanthum, Blume, appears to be the Sumatran part of Jack's *M. malabathricum*.\n\nMelastoma obvolutum, Jack, described in Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 3, is sometimes referred to *M. malabathricum*; sometimes mentioned apart. Jack got it at Tapanuli, Sumatra.\n\nMelastoma erectum, Jack, was described in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 5 from Tapanuli, Sumatra; but is doubtfully distinct from the above three.\n\nMelastoma saquineum, Sims, was described by Jack in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 6 from Penang, under Roxburgh's name of *M. decemfidum*.\n\nMedinilla alpestris, Blume, was described by Jack from Gunong Bengkok, Sumatra, in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 28 under the name of *Melastoma alpestre*. In his letters (p. 234) he mentions it.\n\nMedinilla rubicunda, Blume, was described by Jack from Singapore (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 18) as *Melastoma rubicundum*.\n\nMedinilla eximia, Blume, was described by Jack from Gunong Bengkok, Sumatra (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 17) as *Melastoma eximium*. In his letters (p. 233) he mentions it.\n\nAllomorphia exigua, Blume, was described in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 16 from Penang as *Melastoma exiguum*.\n\nSonerila erecta, Jack, was found in Penang (letters pp. 160, 162) and described in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 7.\n\nSonerila paradoxa, Naud., was found by Jack in Penang (letters p. 162) and described in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 9, as *Sonerila moluccana*, Roxb.\n\nSonerila heterophylla, Jack, was obtained at Tapanuli and at other places on the west coast of Sumatra; and it was described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 16.\n\nSonerila spp. Two species are named (letters p. 186) as having been obtained by Raffles on his Menangkabau trip: but for some reason Jack did not refer to them again in his later writings, probably because they were left with Wallich (vide p. 232).\n\nPhyllagathis rotundifolia, Blume, was collected by Jack in the Musi country which is behind Bengoolen and was described by him under the name of *Melastoma rotundifolium* in Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 12.\n\nMarumia stellulata, Blume, was described by Jack in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 6 from the west coast of Sumatra under the name of *Melastoma stellulatum*.\nMarumia nemorosa, was collected by Jack in Sumatra and on Pulau Nias, and was described under the name of *Melastoma nemorosum* in Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 8.\n\nDissochaeta bracteata, Blume, was described by Jack from Penang in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 9 as *Melastoma bracteatum*.\n\nDissochaeta pallida, Blume, was obtained first in Penang (letter p. 163) but was described after he had got it elsewhere (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 12), under the name of *Melastoma pallidum*. Wallich distributed specimens under No. 4049 collected by Jack in Penang.\n\nDissochaeta celebica, Blume, is very probably Jack\u2019s *Melastoma fallax* from Sumatra (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 13).\n\nDissochaeta gracilis, Blume, is Jack\u2019s *Melastoma gracile* from Sumatra (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 14).\n\nAnplectrum divaricatum, Triana, is Jack\u2019s *Melastoma glauca* from Penang (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 14). In his letters (p. 234) he writes of it.\n\nPogonanthera pulverulenta, Blume, is Jack\u2019s *Melastoma rubicundum* and *pulverulentum* from Singapore and Sumatra, as well as the islands off the west coast (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 19).\n\nAnplectrum viminalis, Triana, is Jack\u2019s *Melastoma viminalis* from Sumatra (Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 16).\n\nPternandra coerulescens, Jack, was found in Penang and described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 61.\n\nPternandra capitellata, Jack, was named and very briefly diagnosed in the addenda prefixed to Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7 (p. iii). He had found it at Moco-moco, Sumatra. In the Flora of British India ii. p. 537 it is said to have been found by Jack in Penang; but the authority for this is unknown to me. However it is a common species of Penang, which Sir George King regarded as but a variety of the last.\n\nKibessa simplex, Korth., appeared as *Pternandra echinata* in Wallich\u2019s Catalogue No. 4078, and is named in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. iii, the locality being recorded as Kataun. Griffith on p. 310 of the Calcutta Journal of Natural History, iv. says Kataun in Malacca; but it is without doubt Pasar Katahun, a days journey northward up the coast from Bencoolen.\n\nMemecylon caeruleum, Jack, was found in Penang (letters p. 184) and described in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 26.\n\nMemecylon paniculatum, Jack, was described from the island of Pulau Bintangor and the Sumatran coast at Tapanuli in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 62.\nLYTHRACEAE.\n\n*Pemphis acidula*, Forst. A sea-shore plant of the tropics of the Old World found by Jack in Singapore (letters p. 178).\n\n*Lagerstroemia floribunda*, Jack, was described from Penang in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 38.\n\nBEGONIACEAE.\n\n*Begonia caespitosa*, Jack, described from Bencoolen in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 8.\n\n*Begonia bracteata*, Jack, described from the foot of Gunong Bengkok in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 13. In his letters (p. 234) he names Begonias as found on this trip.\n\n*Begonia fasciculata*, Jack, described from Tapanuli, Sumatra, in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 12.\n\n*Begonia isoptera*, Dryand., was described by Jack from Sumatra under the name of *Begonia geniculata* (Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 15.\n\n*Begonia orbiculata*, Jack, described from Bencoolen in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 9.\n\n*Begonia pilosa*, Jack, was described from the country behind Bencoolen in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 13.\n\n*Begonia racemosa*, Jack, was described from Bencoolen in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 14.\n\n*Begonia sublobata*, Jack, was described from Pulau Penang, West Sumatra, in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 16.\n\nUMBELLIFERAE.\n\n*Hydrocotyle asiatica*, Linn., was sent by Jack to Wallich from Penang and appears under No. 566 on Wallich\u2019s Catalogue.\n\nARALIACEAE.\n\nJack in his letters (p. 236) mentions Araliaceae from Sumatra.\n\nRUBIACEAE.\n\n*Uncaria Gambier*, Roxb., is mentioned by Jack as freely cultivated in Singapore, but not seen in Penang (letters p. 178).\n\n*Uncara lanosa*, Wall., may well be the Penang plant mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters (p. 196).\n\n*Greenea Jackii* W. & A., is the *Rondoletia corymbosa*, described by Jack in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 4 from Penang.\n\n*Ophiorrhiza heterophylla*, Jack, was described in the Malay Misc. ii (1822), No. 7, p. 85, from the neighbourhood of Bencoolen.\nArgostemma humile, Benn., was obtained by Jack in Penang and sent to Wallich. Wallich described the plant in Bennett's Plantae Javanicae Rariores p. 94, and distributed Jack's specimens under his number 8391.\n\nMussea glabra, Vahl, is probably the Penang plant which Jack calls M. frondosa (letters p. 155).\n\nLucinaea Morinda, DC., is Jack's Morinda polysperma (Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 14) from Singapore. He mentions it in his letters (p. 194).\n\nTimonius Koenigii, Blume, is the Helospora flavescens of Jack described in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 127, from Sumatra.\n\nUrophyllum glabrum, Wall., is a name which Wallich gave to a plant described in MS. by Jack for him, Jack had proposed to call it Patisna glabra or Wallichia glabra (letters pp. 196 and 218), and Wallich published the description in Carey's and his revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indica, ii. p. 186 altering the generic name. Urophyllum glabrum was obtained by Jack in Penang, and found again later at Tapanuli, Sumatra.\n\nUrophyllum villosum, Wall., was found by Jack in Penang and described along with the last. It is mentioned incidentally in Jack's letters (p. 196).\n\nLecananthus erubescens, Jack, was described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 83 from the country behind Ben-coolen.\n\nRandia anisophylla, Hook. f., was described by Jack in Carey and Wallich's revision of Roxburgh's Flora Indica ii. p. 461 from Penang as Gardenia anisophylla. In Wallich's Catalogue it appears as Gardenia? anisophylla No. 8399. It is a common tree in Penang.

Jack informed Wallich (letters p. 222) that he had found the Australian Sersalisia obovata on the west coast of Sumatra; but this must have been a mistake, some Malayan Sideroxylon deceiving him.\n\nMimusops sp. Under the name of M. Kauki, Jack recorded the finding of a Mimusops in Penang (letters p. 153).\n\nSTYRACEAE.\n\nStyrax Benzoin, Dryand., the source of Gum Benjamin, is mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 198) as a plant of the country behind Tapanuli, Sumatra.\n\nR.

No. 7, p. 80, from the country behind Bencoolen.\n\nWrightia dubia, Spring., was found by Jack in Penang (letters 195) and apparently again at Bencoolen (letters p. 218). Wallich distributed Jack\u2019s specimens from Penang under the number 1643 of his Catalogue and with the name Strophanthus Jackianus.\n\nMarsdenia volubilis, T. Cooke (Dregea volubilis, Benth.), is mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters (p. 222) as a Sumatran plant under the name of Hoya viridiflora, R. Br.\n\nHoya spp. Two Sumatran species of \u201cHoya\u201d are mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters (pp. 222 and 225) as Hoya grandiflora and Hoya gracilis. It cannot be that the first named is Tylophora grandiflora R. Br., for Jack\u2019s description does not fit that Australian plant, although Jack seems to have thought that it did.\n\nLOGANIACEAE.\n\nFagraea auriculata, Jack, considerably interested Jack on account of the great size of its flowers: he described it in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 82, from Singapore and Tapanuli, Sumatra: and in his letters he mentioned it several times, firstly (p. 178) its discovery, then the despatch of notes on it to Wallich (p. 215) and lastly (p. 226) its occurrence at Tapanuli.\n\nFagraea carnosia, Jack, was described in the Malaya.

It was described in Carey\u2019s and Wallich\u2019s revision of Roxburgh\u2019s Flora Indica, ii. p. 35. As Jack states in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, that his total of species of Fagraea was five, the other references to the genus in his letters must refer to some of the above.\n\nCONVOLVULACEAE.\n\nNeuropeltis racemosa, Wall., is mentioned as a Penang plant in Jack\u2019s letters (pp. 166 and 216).\n\nBORAGINACEAE.\n\nCordia subcordata, Lamk., is mentioned as a Singapore plant in Jack\u2019s letters (p. 179).\n\nSOLANACEAE.\n\nDatura arborea, Linn., a South American plant is mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters as at Bencoolen, where doubtless it was in cultivation (letters p. 217).\n\nGESNERACEAE.\n\nAeschynanthus grandiflora, Spreng. Jack (letters p. 228) says that he obtained Incarvillea parasitica, Roxb. at Bencoolen: but in his published writings he does not refer to it; and consequently it may be assumed that he had realised some difference between his plant and Roxburgh\u2019s.\n\nAeschynanthus volubilis, Jack, was described as a plant of Bencoolen in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 42. Perhaps it is the plant mentioned in his letters (p. 237).\n\nAeschynanthus radicans, Jack, was described as a plant found in the interior of Sumatra, Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 43.\n\nDidymocarpus reptans, Jack, was described from Penang in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 3, and in Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 35. It may be the plant referred to in letters (p. 162). In the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 35 the locality given is \u201cwith the proceeding,\u201d which is D. racemosa from Tapanuli; but this Tapanuli plant is an intercalation, and the \u201cproceeding\u201d intended is D. crinita, which is a Penang plant.\nDidymocarpus crinita, Jack, was described from Penang in Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 4, and in Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 33.\n\nDidymocarpus racemosa, Jack, was described from Tapanuli in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 34.

It is mentioned in his letters (p. 228) in such a way as to show that he got it about the time of his visit to Pulau Nias and probably he had found it at more than one of the Sumatran ports at which he touched on his journey thither.\n\nDidissandra frutescens, C. B. Clarke, was described from Penang in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 5 and the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 39 as Didymocarpus frutescens. He mentions it in his letters (p. 199) but only in reference to a drawing which he wished to publish.\n\nDidissandra elongata, C. B. Clarke, was described as Didymocarpus elongata in the Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 37 from Pulau Bintangor off the west coast of Sumatra. He mentions it in his letters (pp. 221 and 228).\n\nLoxonia acuminata, R.

Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 27.\n\nCyrtandra glabra, Jack, was described from Bencoolen in Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 28.\n\nCyrtandra macrophylla, Jack, was described from the interior of Sumatra in Trans. Linn. Soc. xiv. p. 25.\n\nACANTHACEAE.\n\nAcanthus ilicifolius, Linn. is mentioned as a Penang plant in Jack's letters (p. 155).\n\nAcanthus ebracteatus, Vahl, is mentioned along with the last as a Penang plant (letters p. 155).\n\nVERBENACEAE.\n\nCallicarpa longifolia, Lamk., was distributed by Wallich under No. 1835 of his Catalogue as from Jack collected in Acheen.\n\nCallicarpa arborea, Roxb., is mentioned by Jack in his letters (p. 225) as a plant found on Pulau Nias.\n\nGmelina villosa, Roxb., was described by Jack as a Sumatran plant in Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 18.\n\nGmelina sp. is mentioned in Jack's letters as a plant of Acheen (p. 174).\n\nVitex pubescens, Vahl (V. arborea, Roxb.), was described by Jack as a Sumatran plant in Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 18.\n\nClerodendron penduliflorum, Wall., is the plant of Penang and Acheen which Jack in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 17, called C. nutans. It is mentioned in his letters (pp. 163, 165, and 174).\n\nClerodendron villosum, Blume, was described by Jack from Penang and Sumatra as C. molle, in Malay. Misc. i.

Misc. i. No. 1, p. 16).\n\nPeronema canescens, Jack, was described in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 46 from Sumatra.\n\nSphenodesme pentandra, Jack was described from Penang in Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 19; and it seems that this is the plant referred to in one of Jack's letters (p. 184).\nJack's specimens Wallich founded *Congea Jackiana*, a name to be found in his Catalogue No. 1735.\n\n*Avicennia* sp. An *Avicennia* is mentioned under the name of *A. resinifera*, in Jack's letters (p. 220) as occurring at Bencoolen; and mentioned again under his description of *Pyrrhanthus*.\n\n**LABIATAE.**\n\n*Ocimum Basilicum*, Linn., was recorded as collected by Jack at Penang in Wallich's Plantae Asiaticae Rariores ii. p. 13, and occurs in Wallich's Catalogue as No. 2713. Sir David Prain's remarks (Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, Ixxiv. p. 702) may be referred to as showing that Wallich's 2713, is something unusual.\n\n**NEPENTHACEAE.**\n\n*Nepenthes ampullaria*, Jack, was brought to Jack from Singapore by Raffles (letters p. 163), and then was found by Jack himself in the same place (letters p. 178) and also at Rhio. Jack put a description into print but did not publish it: it would have formed part of his third paper in the Malayan Miscellanies, had he not withdrawn it. Sir William Hooker in 1835 reprinted and published this description in the Companion to the Botanical Magazine, i. p. 271.\n\n*Nepenthes Rafflesiana*, Jack, was likewise collected in Singapore first by Raffles (letters p. 163), and then again by Jack (letters p. 178). Jack's description was similarly put into print but withdrawn from his third paper in the Malayan Miscellanies: and similarly also published by Sir William Hooker in 1835 in the Companion to the Botanical Magazine, i. p. 270.\n\n*Nepenthes phyllamphora*, Willd., was obtained by Jack, in Bencoolen, and other parts of western Sumatra: he mentions finding it at Bencoolen in his letters (p. 186). He described it in print for the third paper of his Descriptions of Malayan Plants and the reprinting and publishing were done in 1835 by Sir William Hooker in the Companion to the Botanical Magazine i. p. 271.\n\n*Nepenthes gracilis*, Korth. is assuredly the *N. distillatoria* of Jack, described very briefly along with the last from Singapore and Malacca. It is possible that Raffles first got it in Singapore (letters p. 163). Macfarlane, in Das Pflanzenreich, iv. No. 111, p. 59, quotes a specimen collected by Jack.\n\n**CYTINACEAE.**\n\n*Rafflesia Arnoldi*, R. Br., was found first by Raffles and Arnold, before Jack joined the service at Bencoolen. Jack, later found it to be by no means rare in the country behind\nHe drew up a very careful description of it under the name of *Rafflesia Titan*, and put it into print along with other material for the third of his Descriptions of Malayan Plants, but withdrew it as Robert Brown had prepared a description under the name of *Rafflesia Arnoldi*. Jack\u2019s description was published by Sir William Hooker in the companion to the Botanical Magazine in 1835, vol. i.\n\n**ARISTOLOCHIACEAE.**\n\n*Aristolochia hastata*, Jack, was described from Natal, Sumatra, in the Malay.

Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 35.\n\n**LAURACEAE.**\n\n*Dehaasia microcarpa*, Blume, probably is the *Laurus incrassata* mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters (p. 230) and described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 33, as from Natal, Sumatra. The reduction depends on Wallich\u2019s authority in his Catalogue under No. 2589.\n\n*Dehaasia* sp.? Another \u201cLaurus\u201d is mentioned by Jack as a Bencoolen plant under his description of the last.\n\n*Cinnamomum Parthenoxylon*, Meissn., was described by Jack under the name of *Laurus Parthenoxylon* in Malay.

No. 1, p. 26.\n\nURTICACEAE.\n\nConocephalus suaveclens, Blume, appears to be a plant mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 196) without locality\u2014the natural inference of the reference is that he had collected it.\n\nFicus diversifolia, Blume, was described by Jack in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 71 as F. ovoidea from Singapore and from Sumatra, and also as F. deltoidea from Sumatra.\n\nFicus rigida, Jack, was described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 72 from Sumatra.\n\nMYRICACEAE.\n\nMyrica aesculenta, Buch.-Ham., is mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 196).

Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 86, as Q. racemosa, from Sumatra; and it is mentioned in his letters (p. 188) in a way which shows that he had got it at Bencoolen.\n\nQuercus urceolaris, Jack, was described in the Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 87, from Sumatra.\n\nCONIFERAE.\n\nDacrydium elatum, Wall., was found by Jack in Penang. It is referred to in his letters, pp.153, 174, 177, and 179.

Three species are mentioned in Jack's letters (p. 235) as having been found by him, but he give no value.\n\n**Pancratium amboinense**, Jack (letters p. 174) cannot be precisely identified.\n\n**TACCACEAE.**\n\n*Tacca cristata*, Jack, was found in Penang and is mentioned in his letters as *Tacca Rafflesia* (pp. 161, 165, and 174); and later it was got in Singapore (letters p. 178). He changed the name before publishing his description so that it appears in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 3 as *Tacca cristata*.\n\n*Tacca* sp. Jack mentions in his letters (p. 228) the obtaining of another species in Sumatra.\n\n**DIOSCOREACEAE.**\n\n*Dioscorea pyrifolia*, Kunth, was got by Jack in Singapore and distributed by Wallich as *D. glabra*, No. 5105 of his Catalogue.\n\n**LILIACEAE.**\n\n*Dracaena Jackiana*, Wall., was collected by Jack in Penang and distributed by Wallich as No. 5145 of his Catalogue.\n\n*Cordyline terminalis*, Kunth, was collected by Jack in Penang, and was distributed by Wallich as No. 5140 of his Catalogue.\n\n**XYRIDACEAE.**\n\n*Xyris indica*, Linn., is mentioned as a Singapore plant by Jack (letters p. 178); but as *X. indica* is not known to occur in Singapore whereas the very similar *X. anceps*, Lamk., does, it seems probably that Jack had the latter.\n\n**FLAGELLARIACEAE.**\n\n*Susum anthelminticum*, Blume, was described by Jack under the name of *Veratrum? malayanum* in Malay. Misc. i. No. 5, p. 25. He had got in Penang.\n\n**COMMELYNACEAE.**\n\n*Tradescantia* spp. Jack in his letters (p. 235) says that he had obtained three species.\n\n*Floscopa scandens*, Lour., was collected by Jack in Penang and distributed by Wallich under his Catalogue number 5204.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 73, 1916.\nPALMAE.\n\n*Corypha* sp.? may perhaps be the Penang palm mentioned in his letters (p. 163).\n\n*Oncosperma filamentosum*, Blume, was described by Jack under the name of *Areca tigillaria* from Sumatra and the Malay islands in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 88.\n\n*Metroxylon Sagu*, Rottb., the sago palm, interested Jack, and the description which he gave had furnished the basis for most of those of subsequent authors. Jack first found the sago palm in Penang (letters p. 166) and subsequently examined it in detail at Bencoolen (letters pp. 190 and 193). He records as localities for the tree \u201cSiak and the Pagi islands.\u201d His description was prepared for the Malayan Miscellanies, put into proof, but only published by Sir William Hooker in his Companion to the Botanical Magazine vol. i. (1835) p. 266.\n\nARACEAE.\n\n*Aglaonema marantifolium*, Blume, was described in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 24, from Penang under the name of *Calla nitida*. It is mentioned in Jack\u2019s letters (p. 174).\n\n*Homalomena angustifolium*, Hook. f., was described by Jack from Penang in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 24 under the name of *Calla angustifolia*. It was mentioned in his letters (p. 174).\n\n*Homalomena humile*, Hook. f., was described from Penang in the Malay. Misc. i. No. 1, p. 22 under the name of *Calla humilis*. Jack in his letters (p. 174) perhaps refers to it.\n\n*Arum* sp. Jack obtained in Penang an Aroid (letters p. 174) which he refers to the genus *Arum*, not then split up as now.\n\n*Lasia acuteata*, Lour., is almost certainly the plant of Penang which Jack calls in his letters (p. 154) *Pothos pinnatifida*.\n\nVERY IMPERFECTLY KNOWN.\n\n*Coelogyrum coriaceum*, Jack in Malay. Misc. ii. No. 7, p. 65, from Bencoolen.\n\n*Ocetas spicata*, Jack, in Malay. Misc. ii.

Annandale, D. Sc., F. A. S. B.\n(Zoological Survey of India).\n\nMany years ago Capt. F. Worsley of the S. S. 'Sherard Osborne' obtained a number of deep-sea barnacles from cables that his ship was engaged in repairing. Some of these he presented to the Indian Museum in Calcutta, the others (the major part) to the Raffles Museum in Singapore. Those in the Indian Museum were described by me in 1905 in the Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal; I have now to thank Dr. Hanitsch for the opportunity of examining those in Singapore and of comparing selected specimens with the collection in Calcutta.\n\nThere is one slight uncertainty as to the provenance of the Singapore specimens. A large portion of them are stated to have been found in lat. $10^\\circ 22' 30''$, but it is not stated whether North or South. There can, however, be little real doubt that South is meant, for the corresponding specimens in Calcutta are labelled \"Bali Straits.\"\n\nThe majority of the specimens are from Bali and Gasper Straits and the Java Sea. There is also one species from off Timor. Probably all were brought up from depths of between 60 and 200 fathoms, except *Heteralepas malaysiana*, the type-specimen of which came from 30 fathoms.\n\nA remarkable feature of the collection is the very large proportion of otherwise unknown forms represented in it. In the following list those species that are recorded also from other sources are distinguished by a star at the end of their names.\n\nList of the Pedunculate Barnacles from Telegraph Cables in the Malay Archipelago.\n\n*Scalpellum (Smilium) nudipes*, sp. nov.\n*Scalpellum sociabile*, Annandale.\n*Scalpellum hamulus*, Hoek.\n*Scalpellum sociabile var. parviceps*, var. nov.\n*Scalpellum stearnsi*, Pilsbry.\n*Scalpellum persona*, sp. nov.\n*Heteralepas gigas* (Annandale).\n*Heteralepas (Paralepas) malaysiana* (Annandale).\n\n*Poecilasma (Glyptelasma) gigas*, sp. nov.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 74, 1916.\nThus, of nine forms, six, or two-thirds, are only known from a small series of less than a hundred specimens. This is the more remarkable from the fact that some eighty species of bottom-haunting Cirripedia Pedunculata were represented in the collection made by the Dutch 'Siboga' Expedition in the seas of the Malay Archipelago.\n\nNow the greater part of the sea-bottom is soft, buried in deep ooze; and fixed sessile organisms must often have great difficulty in finding solid objects to which to attach themselves on settling down in life. To such organisms a telegraph cable is a godsend. A scientific expedition, no matter how well equipped, may dredge over the sea-bottom for thousands of miles and discover no nidus so favourable. Deep-sea Cirripedes are usually fixed to the more solid parts of other organisms such as the anchor-fibres of Hexactinellid sponges like *Hyalonema* or the stems of colonial Coelenterates. These organisms grow anchored in the ooze. The surface of attachment is, however, small. Other favourite bases for deep-sea barnacles are the manganese nodules that form themselves round bodies such as the teeth of dead sharks, the solid ear-bones of whales, and cinders dropped from passing ships. But even these, if the vast area of the sea-bottom be considered, must be scanty upon it. When the larvae of a barnacle, produced as they are in hundreds if not thousands simultaneously, chance on a cable at the moment of fixation, it is evident that a much larger proportion of them will survive than would otherwise be the case. A large number of the species of the group known from depths greater than 100 fathoms are only known at most from a few isolated specimens. One species (*Scalpellum albatrossianum*, Pilsbry) only exists so far as museums are concerned in two individuals, one of which was dredged by the 'Albatross' in the north Atlantic from 2045 fathoms, the other by the 'Investigator' in the Bay of Bengal from 1997 fathoms. Two-thirds of the species in Capt. Worsley's collection are, however, represented by series of ten or more specimens each.\n\nThe barnacles are not only remarkable for their abundance but also for their large size. Only one of the species (*Heteralepas malaysiana*) can be called a small one, while no less than three of the nine species are, each in its own genus, the largest known, namely *Scalpellum stearnsi*, *Poecilasma gigas*\\(^1\\) and *Heteralepas gigas*. *S. persona* is also among the most bulky of the Pedunculata. Moreover, the type-specimen of *S. inerme* (= *S. stearnsi*), found by Capt. Worsley on a cable in Bali Straits, is the largest individual of its species as yet recorded, while the examples of *S. hamulus* from cables are twice the size of those found attached to small objects by the 'Siboga' at about the same depth.\n\n\\(^1\\) In *P. subcarinatum* (Pilsbry) from the Atlantic the capitulum is at least as big but the peduncle is shorter.\nIt is strange to find a barnacle such as *Heteralepas gigas* on the sea-bottom in comparatively deep water, for it has all the appearance of a pelagic form. The specimens in the Raffles Museum, however, were undoubtedly attached to a telegraph cable, as is proved by an examination of the material adhering to their bases. They have been preserved in alcohol for many years and are now dull and formless objects, shrivelled out of all resemblance to their natural form, but much less uniformly contracted than the type-specimen. In life they were in all probability even larger than they are now and their integument must have been smooth, transparent and swollen; they must have borne a close external resemblance to the true *Alepas*, which is found on the surface, as a rule depending from the bells of medusae (see *Rec. Ind. Mus.*, X, p. 276, pl. xxxiii, fig. 2).\n\nBoth *Scalpellum stearnsi* and *S. persona*, which are not closely allied species, display a tendency to get rid of the calcareous valves or plates on the capitulum and to substitute for them a homogeneous cartilaginous or thick membranous investment. In all families of the true Cirripedia Pedunculata a similar tendency occurs and reoccurs in certain genera and species. It may be correlated either with a deep-sea or a pelagic existence or with semi-parasitic habits and therefore affords a rare instance of parallel evolution in which convergence is connected not with similar but with diverse modes of life. In the genus *Scalpellum* itself we find two if not three different manifestations of this curious tendency, which may perhaps be regarded as an ultimate reversion to a primitive condition. In the first place we may note a number of species of comparatively small size (*e.g.* *S. laccadiricum*, Annandale = *S. polymorphum*, Hoek, and *S. larvale*, Pilsbry) with compressed capitula and very delicate valves in which there is great variation in the development of these plates. Even when they are most degenerate the membrane that covers them is not thick. In some cases individuals are known in which the greater part or the whole of the capitular surface is covered by the valves, while others occur in which the valves are reduced by an excavation of their lower margins until (as in *S. lambda*, Annandale) they may all have a form approaching to that of the Greek letter \u03bb. In such forms the valves of the young are, at any rate in some species, more complete than those of the adults.\n\nAt the other extreme we find a little group of very large species such as *S. giganteum*, *S. persona* and *S. alcockianum*, with stout, more or less inflated capitula and with relatively thick valves almost completely concealed beneath a thick cartilaginous investment. In such species the condition of the valves seems to be much more stable than in the other group; in *S. giganteum* they are relatively large, in the two Oriental species very small. But in these latter their area though small is not, except in the terga and to a less extent in the carinal latera, reduced by excavation of the margins of the plates, but by a general reduction in size. Such forms as *S. stearnsi* and *S. gruvelii* are to some extent\nintermediate between these two extremes, being very variable in the extent of the valves, having great or moderately great bulk, a moderately thick capitulum and a moderately thick investment. The reduction of their valves, however, is brought about mainly not by excavation of the margins, and it is possible that they may represent an offshoot from the same stock that has produced *A. giganteum* and *S. persona* successively in the direct line, having valves capable of reduction as in the latter, but lacking the very thick investment and other extreme characters of both species.\n\nIn spite of its biological and taxonomic interest the collection does not cast much light on the distribution of the deep-sea fauna of Malaysia. One species (*Scalpellum stearnsi*) appears to be a true eastern form, common in Japanese seas in shallow water and at moderate depths near shore and found by the 'Siboga' at several places in the Malay Archipelago in from 112 to 221 fathoms. It has not been taken anywhere west of the Malay Peninsula. The other seven species have been found only in the Malay Archipelago, but one of them (*Scalpellum persona*) from the Java Sea is closely related to a form (*S. alcockianum*) described from greater depths (859-80 fathoms) off Ceylon. *S. sociabile* is probably confined to the western and central parts of the Archipelago, while *S. nudipes*, *S. sociabile var. parviceps*, *Heteralepas gigas*, *H. malaysiana* and *Poecilasma gigas* are only known from the seas round Java and Borneo. None of these species are related to others very closely.\n\nI know of no other collection of barnacles from deep-sea cables in the Malay Archipelago. There is a small one in the British Museum from a cable in the western part of the Indian Ocean, including specimens of three species only, all of which are different from the Malayan ones. It is, however, from a considerably greater depth (1200 fathoms) than the collection considered here. Two of the species (*Scalpellum velutinum*, Hoek and *S. gruvelii*, Annandale) are fairly large forms, but the third, *S. (Smilium) acutum*, Hoek, is decidedly small. *S. acutum* and *S. velutinum* are both species with a very extensive range in the deep sea, while *S. gruvelii* is known otherwise with certainty only from off Ceylon and from the Laccadive Sea, but is so closely related to American forms from both the Atlantic and the Pacific that their specific identity has been suggested.\n\n**Family SCALPELLIDAE.**\n\n**Genus Scalpellum**, Leach.\n\n1851. *Scalpellum*, Darwin, *Mon.

Marseilles*, XV, p. 37.\nOf the recent species ascribed to this genus by modern authors, now numbering well over a hundred, only six were known to Darwin in 1851 and of these, four had already received separate generic names. The type-species of *Scalpellum* was *S. vulgare*, Leach: 1824 (= *Lepas scalpellum*, Linn\u00e9: 1767 and Poli: 1795); Gray in 1848 had described a second species under the name *Thaliella ornata*; the same author in 1825 had named a third species *Smilium Peronii*, and a fourth in the same year *Calantica Homii* (= *Pollicipes villosus*, Leach: 1824). All these Darwin included in *Scalpellum*, together with two new species, *S. rutilum* and *S. rostratum*. He was not, however, by any means dogmatic in so doing, for he wrote, \"I have felt much doubt in limiting this genus: the six recent species which it contains, differ more from each other than do the species in the previous genera.\"\n\nHoek in his report on the 'Challenger' collection (1883) followed Darwin in recognizing only one genus, in which he set up two primary divisions, to include (A) those with imperfectly and (B) those with perfectly calcified valves.\n\nGruvel, in his *Monographie des Cirrhip\u00e8des* (1905), accepted Hoek's classification.\n\nIn his account of the Cirripedia in the collection of the United States National Museum (1907) Pilsbry considerably elaborated this system, accepting three subgenera (*Calantica*, *Smilium* and *Scalpellum*) and further subdividing the subgenus *Scalpellum* into three sections, which he called *Scalpellum*, s. str., *Holoscalpellum* and *Neoscalpellum*. He based these subgenera and sections mainly on the number, form and position of the capitular valves of the hermaphrodite or female but also considered the characters of the dwarfed males when these were known.\n\nIn the following year, in a paper \"On the Classification of the Scalpelliform Barnacles,\" he carried the process further, laying greater stress on the males, and recognized four genera, *Calantica*, *Smilium*, *Euscalpellum* and *Scalpellum*. *Scalpellum* he subdivided into two subgenera, *Arcoscalpellum* and *Scalpellum*, s. str. He also recognized other minor groups.\n\nIn the meanwhile, (1907) Hoek had published his report on the Cirripedia Pedunculata of the 'Siboga' and had introduced into literature the names *Euscalpellum* and *Arcoscalpellum*, which Hoek adopted from him. These names, however, Hoek used only as those of \"Sectiones,\" together with two others of similar application\u2014*Proto-Scalpellum* and *Meso-Scalpellum*. In all cases he inserted a hyphen and spelt the 'Scalpellum' part of the compound with a capital S. In distinguishing the four sections he gave great importance to the form of the carina, but also considered other valves in the hermaphrodite and female and did not ignore the males.\n\nIn 1910 I gave reasons for recognizing only the genus *Scalpellum* with two subgenera, *Smilium* and *Scalpellum*, s. str.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 74, 1916.\nQuite recently (1916) Joleaud, writing largely from a palaeontological point of view and ignoring everything but the capitular valves of the hermaphrodites or females, has proposed an entirely new classification. He separates off the apparently more primitive forms assigned to *Scalpellum* by Hoek and places them in the genera *Pollicipes*, which he distinguishes from *Mitella*, and *Scillaelepas*. The remaining species he retains in *Scalpellum*, which he divides into two subgenera. To these he assigns the names *Protoscalpellum* and *Scalpellum*. In *Protoscalpellum* he recognizes three sections, *Euprotoscalpellum*, *Subpseudoscalpellum* and *Pseudoscalpellum*. To *Scalpellum* (*s. str.*) he also assigns three sections, which he calls *Adeuscalpellum*, *Subeuscalpellum* and *Euscalpellum*. To say the least of it, these sectional names are ponderous. Their invention, considering the terminology already available, seems to have laid an unnecessary burden on the ingenuity of the author.\n\nIn all of this I see no reason to recede from the position I took up in 1910, at any rate so far as the Indo-Malayan species are concerned. The forms assigned by Joleaud to *Pollicipes* and *Scillaelepas* are certainly very remarkable and may be worthy of subgeneric or even generic rank, but none of them occur in the Indian Ocean and I have little personal experience of any. Of course I do not deny that among the numerous species I retain in *Scalpellum* (*s. str.*) several more or less distinct groups occur, but these groups are not strictly separated one from another and I think it better, when it is necessary to refer to them separately, merely to call them after the most characteristic species known (as \"the group of *S. alcockianum*\" or \"the group of *S. stratum*\").\n\nThroughout the Pedunculata valves are liable to degenerate and disappear and I doubt whether the absence of any one valve has much significance. The presence, on the other hand, of more than a definite number is in most genera a fact of importance. In *Scalpellum* (*s. l.*) there may be as many as 15 valves on the capitulum of the hermaphrodite, or as few as 13; but it is significant that in all known males of the genus in which the calcareous armature is not degenerate there are six valves. Moreover, in many if not in all species a stage in the post-larval development of the female or hermaphrodite can be found in which there are six main calcified areas.\u00b9 The six valves that appear on these grounds to be primitive are the carina and rostrum, a pair of terga and a pair of scuta. The primitive armature thus differs from that typical of the Lepadidae mainly in the presence of a rostrum. In *Mitella*, on the other hand, there seems to be no evidence for the existence at any stage in the evolution of the genus of so small a number of valves. As I have pointed out elsewhere,\u00b2 the lines of evolution in the Cirripedia are so complicated and uncertain that any statement\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 How readily extra valves of no particular significance can be produced in *Scalpellum* is shown by *S. valvulifer*, Annandale, *Vid. Meddel. naturh. Foren. Kbhavn.*, 1910, p. 214, pl. iii, figs. 1, 2.\n\n\u00b2 Mem. Ind. Mus., II, p. 64 (1909).\nas to the descent of any genus or group of species must be regarded as little more than an expression of individual opinion. I do not deny that a morphological classification would be the ideal one, but when so many doubts exist as to the significance of different structures and organs, convenience is the safest course to follow. It is not convenient to refer to a species as belonging to the genus Scalpellum, the subgenus Proto-scalpellum and the section Sub-pseudoscalpellum, and though this terminology may convey a definite morphological meaning to its author and his followers, it is merely confusing to the average carcinologist, as well as being technically incorrect.\n\nSubgenus Smilium, Gray.\n1910. Smilium, Annandale, Rec. Ind. Mus., V, p. 150.\n\nScalpellum nudipes, sp. nov.\n\n(Pl. IV, fig. 1; pl. V, figs. 1-6; pl. VI, figs. 1, 2).\n\nThe species is a somewhat isolated one readily distinguished by the vestigial nature and microscopic size of the calcareous valves of its stalk. This character is combined with a fully calcified capitular armature, great bulk and leaf-like anal appendages.\n\nCapitulum.\n\nThe capitulum is large, ovoid and compressed. There are thirteen large, fully calcified capitular valves in all of which the umbo is apical. They are of a dead white colour and are covered by a thin, smooth, transparent membrane and embedded in a brown cartilaginous investment that separates them slightly. Together they practically cover the surface of the capitulum; none of their apices project strongly. Their surface is smooth, with widely separated obsolescent angulate ridges and furrows. They are all stout and brittle. There are no upper latera.\n\nTerga. The tergum is relatively large, triangular in outline and with all its angles acute. The three angles are situated, one (the umbo) at the apex of the capitulum, one underneath the apex of the scutum on the orificial margin, and one close to the carina and to the posterior angle of the upper latus. The posterior margin of the valve slopes backwards and downwards and is somewhat sinuous but convex outwards as a whole; the anterior margin is straight and relatively short; it is directed downwards and only a very little outwards; the lower margin resembles the upper but with its convexity reversed. The apex is very slightly retroverted.\n\nScuta. The outline of the scutum somewhat resembles that of the tergum but is relatively shorter and more irregular; the valve is also somewhat smaller. The upper posterior angle is situated immediately above the apex of the upper latus. The apex of the scutum is distinctly retroverted and overlaps the tergum.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 74, 1916.\nInframedian. The inframedian latus is comparatively large and of broadly triangular form. Its base forms an acute angle anteriorly with that of the carinal latus. The posterior angle dives beneath the carina and is truncate; the anterior angle is somewhat produced below the base of the scutum.\n\nCarinal latera. The carinal latus is also triangular, but more symmetrical, more produced at the anterior and posterior angles and with its base parallel to that of the capitulum and its apex pointing directly upwards between the upper latus and the carina. The base of the valve is buried in the cartilaginous investment but the apex projects outwards almost to the surface.\n\nRostral latera. The rostral latus resembles the carinal latus in shape and orientation but is even more transverse and is considerably produced backwards, extending for some distance below the base of the latter valve.\n\nCarina. The carina is of moderate size. It extends upwards very little beyond the apex of the scutum and falls far short of that of the tergum. Viewed from the side it is narrow and tapers gradually to the apex; its upper half has a distinct but by no means strong curvature and the apex projects very little behind the posterior margin of the tergum. The base is convex downwards. The dorsum is obscurely carinate and slopes outwards on either side. The base is subangulate and the apex sharply pointed.\n\nSubcarina. The subcarina, which projects almost directly backwards but extends very little behind the carina, is broadly triangular and of comparatively large size. Its apex lies below the middle of the base of the carina and between the posterior angles of the carinal latera.\n\nRostrum. This valve resembles the subcarina closely but is a little larger and has its apex retroverted below the base of the capitular orifice. It projects hardly at all.\n\nPeduncle.\n\nThe peduncle is stout, somewhat compressed and distinctly constricted in the middle. It is of a pale brown colour and a cartilaginous consistency. The surface is wrinkled transversely and divided into small areas, which on the lower part are transverse and rhomboidal, by a network of minute grooves. To the naked eye the capitulum appears to be quite unarmed, but a lens reveals numerous microscopic calcareous particles embedded in the membrane. They have a spindle-shaped or oval outline, are flattened and for the most part directed outwards but do not penetrate the surface. Their position is not correlated with that of the areas on the surface, which are perhaps of artificial origin.\n\nCirri, etc.\n\n1st Cirrus. Both rami are slender and tapering, without dilated segments, the anterior ramus is considerably the shorter of\nthe two and has about 22 segments. The first cirrus is widely separated from the second.\n\n*Cirri* 2-6. The remaining cirri are moderately stout and long. Their anterior fringe is well developed though consisting of rather short chaetae; the posterior armature consists of bunches of fine hairs, of which the longest is about equal in length to the segment, attached to the upper extremity of each segment. Except at the extremities of the rami, each segment is ornamented on its anterior half by several sloping, sinuous lines constituted by an internal thickening of the cuticle.\n\n*Anal appendages.* These are flattened from before backwards and expanded. They consist of a single leaf-like segment devoid of all armature except a very minute and scanty pilosity. The outer margins are strongly concave, the inner a little sinuous. The tips of the appendages do not reach as far as the upper end of the basal segment of the peduncle of the sixth cirri.\n\n*Penis.* The penis is long, rather broad but compressed laterally, strongly and closely annulate, pointed, armed only with soft fine hairs.\n\n**MOUTH-PARTS.**\n\n*Labrum.* The labrum is by no means large and not at all bullate. It has a sharp chitinous edge posteriorly but no teeth. The palps are rather short and stout.\n\n*Mandible.* The mandible is broad and has a large number of teeth, but, as is usual when it takes this form, is probably variable. In the specimen examined the biting margin is almost straight and bears five main teeth, of which the outermost, the 4th and 5th are subequal and larger than the 2nd and 3rd. Between the 1st and 2nd, 2nd and 3rd and 3rd and 4th there are smaller subsidiary teeth. Of these the first is the largest and the third much the smallest. The inner angle, which projects very little beyond the base of the 5th tooth, is asymmetrical. None of the teeth are pectinate and the whole appendage is practically naked.\n\n*Maxilla.* This appendage is rather broad. The outer chaeta is very stout and is followed by a rather deep but short quadrate excavation. There is also a small notch on the margin about half way between the excavation and the inner angle. The marginal bristles are numerous and long but delicate. There is a fringe of fine hairs running almost parallel to and at some distance from the margin on the posterior surface of the appendage.\n\n*Outer maxillae.* The form of these appendages is normal. The sensory organ connected therewith is situated on a rounded papilla.\n\n**ACCESSORY MALE.**\n\nThere are four accessory males attached to the capitulum of the hermaphrodite just below the orifice, but only one of them appears to be mature. It possesses a well differentiated capitulum\narmed with 8 valves. The number of valves is, however, probably abnormal as it is brought about by the separation, quite asymmetrically, of two small plates, one on either side of the carina a little above its base. The normal number is, as in allied forms, probably 6. The capitulum is about as broad above as it is high, it is much broader than the peduncle and moderately compressed from side to side. The orifice opens upwards and outwards.\n\nThe six valves are stout and of comparatively large size. The terga are much smaller than the others and have an almond-shaped outline. Their main axis is vertical. The scuta are broadly triangular and much wider than the other valves; their apices are pointed and turned backwards slightly. The rostrum is large, relatively narrow, very prominent but somewhat retroverted at the apex. The carina is narrow, curved, pointed above and subtruncate at the base. The apices of this valve, of the terga and of the scuta are almost on a level. The appendages are relatively shorter than in the hermaphrodite but otherwise similar. They lack the peculiar ornamentation characteristic of the larger sex but are armed similarly. The mouth-parts are well developed and also resemble those of the hermaphrodite, except that the labrum is relatively smaller and the mandibles have fewer teeth. The anal appendages are leaf-like and consist of a single segment; there is a small bunch of long hairs at their free extremity. The penis is not annulated.\n\nThe younger males have a much narrower capitulum of oval outline. The rostrum and carina are considerably smaller and not at all prominent, while the other valves are less regular in shape. The vesicula seminalis, a conspicuous feature of the large male, is barely visible in the smaller individuals.\n\n**Measurements.**\n\n| Hermaphrodite (type) | Adult Male | Young Male |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Height of capitulum  | 55 mm.     | 4\u00b75 mm.    | 2\u00b75 mm.    |\n| Width of capitulum   | 40 ,,      | 4\u00b75 ,,     | 2\u00b70 ,,     |\n| Thickness of capitulum| 20 ,,     | \u2014          | \u2014          |\n| Length of peduncle   | 56 ,,      | 2\u00b78 ,,     | 1\u00b75 ,,     |\n| Diameters of peduncle| 25 x 18 ,, | \u2014          | \u2014          |\n\n*Type-specimen.* Crusacea, 9319/10, Z.

(130-500 fathom), Java Sea.\n\nThis species, taking both the hermaphrodite and the male into consideration, would find a place in the genus *Calantica* as redefined by Pilsbry in 1908, but is not at all allied to *S. villosum* (Leach), the type of that genus. Nor is it related to the North Atlantic forms assigned by Pilsbry to the group *Scillaelepas*. In spite of the absence of an upper latus in the hermaphrodite it seems to me to be probably related to such forms as *Scalpellum stratum*.\nAurivillius, from the West Indies and *S. sinense*, Annadale, from the seas of Burma and China. It is, in any case, an extremely distinct species, remarkable for its large size, almost naked peduncle and curious anal appendages. The regularity of the valves of the hermaphrodite is a noteworthy feature and the comparatively large size and high development of the male another.\n\nI have examined only the type-specimen, but there is, I think, another from the same locality in the Raffles Museum.\n\n**Subgenus Scalpellum**, Leach.\n\n1910. *Scalpellum* (s. s.), Annandale, *Rec.

Ped.), p. 86, pl. vii, figs. 14, 14a.\n\nI assign to this species two comparatively large specimens from Johul Bank 90 miles south of Timor (70 fathoms). They were attached to the cable in the midst of a massive Alcyonarian of the genus *Dendronephthya*. The capitulum in one specimen is 36 mm. long by 22 mm. broad, the peduncle 37 mm. by 11 mm. The valves are tinged with pink, especially at the apices. The only difference from Hoek\u2019s figure that I can detect is that all the lower latera are relatively a little larger, the carina distinctly longer and the upper margin of the tergum less sinuate above. The two last characters are probably correlated.\n\nThe cirri of this species are extremely slender and the hairs on their anterior margin very delicate. The basal segment of the anal appendages is expanded and flattened, but much less so than in *S. sociabile*: it bears a long flagellum-like process with about sixteen segments, the exact number, as in *S. sociabile*, being probably variable.\n\n**Scalpellum sociabile**, Annandale.\n\n1905. *Scalpellum sociabile*, Annandale, *Mem. As. Soc. Bengal*, I, p. 77, pl. viii, fig. 1.\n1908. *Scalpellum sociabile*, *id. Ill. Zool. \u2018Investigator\u2019, Entomostraca*, pl. iii, fig. 9.\n\nThe typical form, which is well represented in Capt. Worsley\u2019s collection, is more variable (in particular as to the mouth-parts and the number of segments in the anal appendages) than I realized when drawing up the original description. Indeed, the mandibles of the specimen then dissected seem to have been altogether abnormal (*op. cit.*, 1905, p. 78, fig. 2). A characteristic feature of the appendage is, however, shown even in the abnormal specimen, namely the great distance between the first and second tooth and the strong sinuosity or irregular outline of the margin between these two teeth (*cf.* pl. vi, fig. 6). The form of the anal appendages,\nwith their large and greatly expanded basal segment and short cylindrical flagellum, is also most characteristic, though the number of segments in the flagellum is variable.\n\nThe characteristic features of the typical form are, as distinguishing it from both the two varieties discussed below, its comparatively narrow and compressed capitulum, the large size of the calcareous plates on the upper part of the peduncle and the relatively considerable, though not excessive size of the peduncle.\n\nThe type-specimens in the Indian Museum are from Bali Straits (160 fathoms), while the examples in the Raffles Museum are labelled, lat. $10^\\circ 22' 30''$ (S.), long. $120^\\circ 7' 30''$ E., 130-500 fathoms. The latter do not exhibit the extreme gregariousness of those figured in 1905.\n\n**var. pellicatum**, Hoek.\n\n1907. *Scalpellum pellicatum*, Hoek, *Siboga-Exp.*, mon. XXXI a (*Cirr. Ped.*), p. 91, pl. vii, figs. 18, 19.\n\n1909. *Scalpellum sociabile* var. *pellicatum*, Annandale, *Rec. Ind. Mus.*, III, p. 270.\n\nHoek recognized the close relationship of this form to my species, which was described while his 'Siboga' report was in the press, but left it to future investigators to ascertain the precise connection. In view of the variations seen in the large series of *S. sociabile* I have now examined, I am convinced that *S. pellicatum* is no more than a variety of that species. The curious hook on the upper margin of the capitulum, due to the fact that the apex of the carina is entirely free from the capitular membrane, is perhaps abnormal, but the form differs otherwise from the *forma typica* in its relatively broad capitulum and short peduncle armed with close-set plates.\n\nThe specimens dredged by the 'Siboga' (the only examples known) were taken in the Celebes Sea and east of Halmahera in depths of 450 and 397 metres. They were probably all attached to sea-urchins. I have not examined specimens.\n\n**var. parviceps**, nov.\n\n(Pl. IV, fig. 2; pl. V, fig. 9; pl. VI, fig. 6).\n\nThis variety differs from the typical form mainly in its very large peduncle, which is armed with relatively small, widely-separated plates, in the strong development of the hairy capitular epidermis and of the membrane in which the valves are buried. The capitulum is also stouter and more quadrate and the valves are relatively a little smaller. I figure the type specimen and also its mandible and anal appendage.\n\nThe measurements of the type-specimen are as follows.

(130-500 fathoms) in the Java Sea. They were attached side by side to the cable.\n\nThe differences in the three varieties of this species may perhaps be correlated with differences in environment. The specimens of the typical form were found attached to a telegraph cable or to one another and those of var. pellicatum probably to the spines of sea-urchins. In the first instance there was obvious opportunity for free growth and rapid reproduction, in the second the short peduncle may have been of advantage in permitting the guests to lie closer to their host and so to receive full protection from its spines; but I am unable to suggest an explanation of the long peduncle and thick investment of the var. parviceps.\n\nScalpellum stearnsi, Pilsbry.\n\n? 1851.

II, p. 18, pl. ii, figs. 18, 19.\n\nI have already pointed out (op. cit., 1909) the close resemblance between recent examples of this species and Darwin's figure of the fossil S. magnum\\(^1\\) of the Coralline Crag of Sudbourne. Apart from possible anatomical differences, which of course cannot be discussed, I would have no hesitation in regarding the fossil and the recent form as specifically identical.\n\nScalpellum stearnsi was described under that name by Pilsbry in 1890 and redescribed as S. calcariferum by Fischer in the following year. In 1905 I described S. inerme, which I now believe to be merely an extreme form of the species, without recognizing its true\n\n---\n\n1. This resemblance was first noticed by Fischer in 1891, op. cit., p. 118.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 74, 1916.\nrelationship. My attention was first drawn to the close affinities of the two forms by the Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing, F. R. S. Two years later Hoek referred specimens from the Malay Archipelago to two new varieties, which he called robusta and gemina. The type of S. inerme differs from one of his specimens of the variety gemina hardly more than these specimens vary among themselves. Hoek's Malayan examples differ considerably from those hitherto described from Japan, in particular in the great development of the peduncle and the capitular investment. I have, however, been able to examine a good series both from Japan and from the Malay Archipelago and cannot find any distinct break either between specimens from different localities or between those of the supposed varieties.\n\nThere are in the Indian Museum four specimens from Japan. Two of these, which were received in exchange from the British Museum, are comparatively small, the capitulum of the larger example being only about 25 mm. in length. They agree sufficiently well with Pilsbry's and Fischer's figures and differ little, apart from size, from the young specimen of the variety robusta figured by Hoek, except that all the prominent valves are a little more pointed. I recently obtained in Japan two very large specimens which have the following measurements:\n\n|                | A     | B     |\n|----------------|-------|-------|\n| Height of capitulum | 63 mm. | 55 mm. |\n| Breadth of capitulum   | 43    | 35    |\n| Thickness of capitulum | 26    | 22    |\n| Length of peduncle     | 62    | 49    |\n| Diameter of peduncle   | 25    | 22    |\n\nIn measuring the breadth of the capitulum I have not included the prominent part of the carinal latera; I have measured the thickness of the capitulum at the base.\n\nThese two specimens, which were taken side by side, agree much more closely with the description and figures of the variety robusta than they do with those of the typical form. The investment of their capitulum is thick and semi-opaque and their peduncles, though less swollen than those of the type of robusta, are very nearly as long. I do not think, therefore, that the Japanese form can be regarded as a local race of the Malayan one and I see no reason for giving the latter a distinct name, so far as well calcified examples are concerned.\n\nMy supposed species inerme differs from the typical form and from robusta merely in the rather shorter peduncle and in the extreme degeneration of the capitular valves, for the anatomical differences noted by Pilsbry are certainly not beyond the limits of variation. In respect to the degeneration of the valves it is merely an extreme form of Hoek's form gemina, one of the co-types of which is now in the Indian Museum. There is in the Raffles\nMuseum a fairly large series from the Malay Archipelago, and the series includes a number of individuals intermediate between the forms robusta and gemina. I am doubtful, therefore, whether distinct varieties based on the development of the valves should be recognized in the species, but if it is considered desirable to refer to the form with degenerate valves by a distinct name, they should clearly be called var. inerme. Some justification may be found for this course in the apparent absence from Japanese seas of individuals with degenerate valves.\n\n*S. steurnsi* was originally described from shallow water (6-10 fathoms), on the east coast of Japan. The type was attached to a *Vermetus* shell. The type of *S. calcariferum* was from Enoshima in Sagami Bay. My own Japanese specimens are also from Sagami Bay, but probably came from rather deeper water, as Pilsbry's (*op. cit.*, 1907) from off Hondo certainly did. The latter were taken in 94 fathoms. Mine were attached to a dead shell of *Xenophora*, which was mined by the sponge\u00b9 *Cliona vastifica v. concharum*, Thiele. Hoek's specimens were from the Sulu Archipelago and the Sulu Sea; they came from depths of from 204 to 405 metres. The types of *gemina* were taken at the latter depth, but no examples of the var. robusta were found in depths greater than 330 metres. The specimens in the Raffles Museum are from the Java Sea, from depths of between 130 and 500 fathoms, while the type of *S. inerme* was from Bali Straits (160 fms.). Hoek's specimens were attached to shells or (the types of *gemina*) to the anchor-filaments of a Hexactinellid sponge: all of those from Malaysia in the Raffles and the Indian Museum were fixed to telegraph cables.\n\nIt is possible that large size and a strong development of the capitular investment are correlated in this species with life in comparatively deep water, but I have not found this to be the case in the European *S. vulgare*, in which somewhat similar, but not so extreme, variation occurs so far as the calcification of the capitulum is concerned.\n\n**Scalpellum persona**, sp. nov.\n\n(Pl. IV, fig. 3; pl. V, figs. 7, 8; pl. VI, figs. 3-5).\n\nThis species belongs to a little group of large *Scalpella* of doubtful affinities and remarkable for the great development of the capitular investment, in which the valves are buried and almost completely hidden. The valves themselves are more or less reduced\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Pearl-oyster shells from shallow water in Sagami Bay are attacked by a form of the same sponge much more closely resembling the *forma typica*. The upper surface of the *Xenophora* shell, round the base of the barnacles, was almost completely covered by a thick crust of another sponge, *Gelliuss glacialis v. niveus*, Ridley and Dendy, which I do not think has hitherto been recorded from Japan. The apertures of the mining species were mostly on the lower surface of the shell, which was rather deeply concave owing to breakage. It would seem to have been lying free on the bottom.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 74, 1916.\nin size but their margins, except in the terga and to some extent the carinal latera, are not excavated.\n\n**Capitulum.**\n\nThe capitulum is ovoid, of large size and considerably inflated. The valves are completely concealed (except, in some cases, for the apices of the terga, carina and latera) in a thick, opaque, brownish, cartilaginous investment, the surface of which is glabrous and almost smooth. There are eleven relatively well developed valves in addition to a vestigial rostrum. Even those that are relatively well developed are actually of small size and they occupy together only a small proportion of the capitular area. They have, however, an opaque white colour and are fairly thick. Their umbones are apical. There is no subcarina.\n\n*Terga.* The tergum is much reduced and has the form of a four-pointed star with two of its rays greatly and two slightly produced. The two long rays extend downwards, one reaching the tip of the scutum, the other a point about midway between the upper latus and the carina; one of the short rays is directed upwards and forms the tip of the capitulum, while the other points backwards and downwards. Both the long rays are strongly ridged.\n\n*Scuta.* The scutum, though of small size and widely separated from all other valves but the tergum, is of normal form and has none of its margins excavated or deeply concave. It constitutes a triangle with a broad base and acutely pointed apex. The base lies parallel to that of the capitulum. The anterior margin of the valve is convex forwards, the posterior margin slightly concave and the basal margin nearly straight. The apex slightly overlaps the lower margin of the tergum.\n\n*Upper latera.* The upper latus is small, triangular, non-emarginate. It is widely separated from all the other valves. Its larger axis occupies a line running from the apex of the scutum to the upper angle of the carinal latus. The antero-superior part of the valve is carinate.\n\n*Inframedian latera.* These valves are almost vestigial, consisting of minute triangular plates deeply embedded in the investment. They are situated immediately below the upper latera and nearer the rostral latera than any other valve.\n\n*Rostral latera.* The rostral latus is transverse, elongate and band-shaped. The two valves meet below the orifice. Their inner angles are immediately below those of the scuta.\n\n*Carinal latera.* The carinal latera project strongly behind the capitulum some distance below the base of the carina. Their bases, however, lie deeply buried. Their apices are very slightly turned upwards.\n\n*Rostrum.* The rostrum is vestigial and concealed behind the rostral latera.\nCarina. The carina is reduced in size. Above it extends nearly to the apex of the capitulum, but below falls far short of the base. Its apex approaches that of the terga; otherwise it is widely separated from the other valves. In lateral view it is almost linear, strongly curved in its upper third and with its umbo strictly terminal. The dorsum, which is deeply buried, is narrow and feebly convex; the base is subangulate.\n\nPeduncle.\n\nThe peduncle is cylindrical and of about the same length as the capitulum. It is armed with distinct circles of large, projecting alternate plates more or less completely covered by a cartilaginous investment. They are much compressed from above downwards and their exposed margin is angulate or sub-angulate.\n\nCirri, etc.\n\n1st Cirrus short and rather stout, the two rami subequal, the central segments of the anterior ramus expanded and produced backwards, the inner surface of both densely covered with hairs.\n\nCirri 2-6 not far removed from 1st cirrus, slender, armed anteriorly with two rows of long stiff but slender chaetae and posteriorly with terminal bunches of slender hairs, the largest of which are a little longer than the segment to which they are attached. Each bunch proceeds for a short distance down the back of the segment; those of the 6th cirri are feebly developed.\n\nAnal appendages long, slender and tapering, consisting of a large number of segments, but much shorter than in S. alcockianum. The basal joint much the longest and somewhat expanded and flattened from before backwards.\n\nPenis. Rather short, smooth, slender and pointed.\n\nMouth Parts.\n\nLabrum. Small, not at all bullate; labial palp slender, pointed.\n\nMandible. Rather small, variable in dentition, but with three main teeth in addition to the inner angle, which is variously divided and broad as a whole; the outer tooth remote from and larger than the 2nd and 3rd, which are equal and situated rather close together.\n\nMaxillae. Relatively large, with a broad shallow excavation on its upper margin occupying more than half the margin, the remainder of which is obliquely subtruncate. The two outer spines very stout but not lengthy.\n\nOuter maxilla remarkable for the great development of the olfactory organ, which takes the form of a blunt conical process about half as long as the appendage is broad.\n\nFamily LEPADIDAE.\n\n1909.

There are numerous specimens from the Java Sea (lat. 10\u00b0 22' 30\" (?S.), long. 120\u00b0 7' 30\" E.; 130-500 fathoms) in the Raffles Museum. The latter are considerably more swollen and distorted than the former and show that the animal must have had a gelatinous appearance in life much like that of the Alepas found attached to medusae on the surface.

Pilsbry regards it as intermediate between Poecilasma and Megalasma and as probably ancestral to the latter, under which he places it. The species now to be described, however, though it evidently comes into the subgenus is in most respects a true Poe-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ncilasma and I think that Pilsbry's Glyptelasma has on the whole greater affinity with Darwin's genus than with Hoek's Megalasma, in which the umbo of the scuta has undergone a peculiar rotation.\n\nPoecilasma gigas, sp. nov.\n\n(Pl. IV, fig. 4; pl. V, figs. 10-14, pl. VI, figs. 7, 8).\n\nThis is one of the largest species as yet known either in Poecilasma or in Megalasma. It has also a longer peduncle than is usual in either Megalasma or Glyptelasma, both of which usually differ in their very short peduncle from the more Lepas-like Poecilasma (s. str.). The form of the base of the carina is characteristic of the species.\n\nCAPITULUM.\n\nThe capitulum is large, rather narrow, strongly compressed in the tergal and carinal regions and only moderately inflated in the scutal. In form it is nearly rectangular, but rendered asymmetrical by the strong backward slope of the upper margin. The valves are nearly smooth, white and opaque; they are separated by lines of membrane and covered with a rather thick brownish cuticle, which is usually torn.\n\nTerga. The terga are broad but have comparatively little vertical depth. They are rendered quadrangular by the fact that the posterior angle is distinctly truncated by the apex of the carina. The backward slope of the valve is well marked, its margins are all straight and its apex though not retroverted forms a very acute angle. The occludent margin almost forms an angle with that of the scutum, being directed backwards as well as upwards. There is a well-developed triannular tooth at the outer end of the lower margin on the inner surface of the left valve, but none on the right valve.\n\nScuta. The scuta are large, quadrangular in outline, moderately inflated in their basal parts, and symmetrical externally. The carinal margin is arched, the others almost straight. The occludent margin is, however, a little rounded below and the basal margin, which is the shortest of the four, slightly concave. The umbo is slightly introverted. The occludent margin is much the longest. There is a well-marked groove running along the basal margin above the edge. The right valve bears a blunt tooth on the inner surface at the basal occludent angle. This tooth fits into the concave surface of a short process in the corresponding position on the other valve.\n\nCarina. The carina is of normal length. Seen from the side it is strongly arched and narrow, especially above, but bears at the base two short transverse processes with blunted extremities that impinge on the inner ends of the basal grooves on the scuta. Seen from behind the valve is quite flat in its upper half but strongly carinate towards the base, at which the carina terminates in a sharp,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 74, 1916.\nslightly introverted point; the apex is subangulate and a little expanded. The transverse basal processes are strongly carinate, their carinae meeting that of the dorsum at a right angle but not extending so far outwards towards the surface of the capitulum. The inner surface of the carina is flat above; below it is deeply but narrowly grooved. The basal floor is slightly concave inwards and terminates at either side in a blunt tubercle.\n\n**Peduncle.**\n\nThe peduncle is slender and cylindrical, sometimes nearly as long as the carina. In the specimens examined it is much wrinkled, but this condition is probably artificial. It is quite naked.\n\n**Cirri, etc.**\n\n*1st Cirrus* short, slender, with the basal segments of both rami very long; the anterior ramus a little longer than the posterior; both rami somewhat bluntly pointed.\n\n*2nd-6th Cirri* slender, rather short, with the anterior bristles numerous and well-developed, long and rather stout, the posterior hairs forming short transverse bands across the posterior surface of the tips of the segments; some of these hairs on some segments longer than the segment, but the majority distinctly shorter.\n\n*Anal appendages* short, conical, having on the upper part of the opposed surfaces a small, ovoid, flattened squamose area; a scanty vertical row of bristles borne on the upper part of this area and extending over the tip of the appendage; the bristles of variable length but the apical one much the longest.\n\n*Penis* long, slender, smooth; the tip rather blunt, bearing a dense bunch of soft hairs.\n\n**Mouth-Parts.**\n\n*Labrum* short, triangular, armed at its base with a semicircular row of minute conical teeth; the teeth in the middle part of the row much smaller than those in the outer parts. Labral palps short and rather stout.\n\n*Mandibles* evidently very variable, with a considerable number of teeth, narrow and long.\n\n*Maxillae* broad; the only chaetae of large size at the outer angle; a well-marked excavation occupying nearly one-half of the margin, the inner lobe of which is broadly rounded; a few short bristles present at the base of the excavation; no stout chaetae on the lower part of the margin.\n\n*Outer maxilla* of normal type.\nMEASUREMENT OF TYPE.\n\nHeight of capitulum . . . . . . 24 mm.\nBreadth of capitulum . . . . . . 13 \"\nThickness of capitulum . . . . . . 6\u00b75 \"\nLength of peduncle . . . . . . 12 \"\nDiameters of peduncle . . . . . . 6 x 4 \"\n\nType-specimen.

(130-500 fathoms).\n\nThe species is an isolated one, intermediate between the genus Megalasma, Hoek, which it resembles in the structure of its carina, and Poecilasma, Darwin, with which it agrees in other points. On the whole it seems to be most nearly related to P. kaempferi, Darwin, a Japanese species with local races in many seas. It is easily distinguished, however, from all of these by its large size and by the form of its carina.\n\nThe type-specimens were attached to the peduncle of Heteralepas gigas: a considerable number of specimens were found thus associated with a group of that species from a telegraph cable. Other, smaller examples were fixed to the capitulum of the type of Scalpellum nudipes from the same locality.\n\nDescription of Plate IV.\n\nFig. 1.\u2014Type-specimen of Scalpellum (Smilium) nudipes, sp. nov., with young specimens of Poecilasma (Glyptelasma) gigas attached to its scuta.\n\nFig. 2.\u2014Type-specimen of Scalpellum sociabile var. parviceps, var. nov.\n\nFig. 3.\u2014Type-specimen of Scalpellum persona, sp. nov.\n\nFig. 4.\u2014Type-specimen of Poecilasma (Glyptelasma) gigas, sp. nov.\n\nFig. 5.\u2014Specimen of Heteralepas gigas (Annandale) from the Java Sea.\n\nAll the figures are of the natural size.\n\nDescription of Plate V.\n\nScalpellum nudipes, sp. nov.\n\nFig. 1.\u2014Part of 4th cirrus (greatly enlarged).\n\nFig. 2.\u2014Body from behind, showing anal appendages and base of 6th cirrus (x 4).\n\nFig. 3.\u2014First cirrus (x 2).\n\nFig. 4.\u2014Mouth-parts in lateral view (x 4).\n\nFig. 5.\u2014Immature male (x 8).\n\nFig. 6.\u2014Capitulum of adult male (x 8).\n\nR.

E. Pepys,\n\nF. M. S. Civil Service.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe omissions and shortcomings of this glossary will be obvious to the many Europeans who have some knowledge of Kelantan Malay. The only excuse for its publication is that I know of no other published collection of Kelantan phrases and idioms except Mr. A. J. Sturrock's article \"Some Notes on the Kelantan Dialect,\" published in the Journal of the R. A. S. (Straits Branch) in December 1912, to which I am much indebted in the compilation of the following pages.\n\nIt has been my object to include (1) words and expressions peculiar to Kelantan, most of which have a Siamese origin, (2) words used in Kelantan in a different sense to that in which they are usually found in the F. M. S. and (3) words which, though common in literature, are rarely heard colloquially in the F. M. S., though daily used in ordinary speech by Kelantan Malays.\n\nMost of the words included I have noted when first heard in the mouth of some Kelantan Malay: but some too have been in the first instance supplied me by various Malay clerks, whose assistance I gratefully acknowledge.\n\nI am also indebted to Mr. R. O. Winstedt, to whom I showed this collection, for criticism and advice.\n\nIn such a compilation as this, spelling presents an unusual difficulty; since most of the words being essentially colloquial and rarely if ever written, there is no standard. I have in the majority of cases followed phonetic spelling.\n\nW. E. Pepys.\n\nPasir Puteh, Kelantan, 20th Sept., 1916.\n\nPronunciation.\n\nMalay as talked in Kelantan is in many ways different from the language spoken in the Western States: and the European who comes here from the other side hears a jargon, the worst feature of which (from his point of view) is not the intersprinkling of Siamese or local terms, which he may soon pick up for practical purposes, but the clippings and contortions of words he used to know but in their new form fails to recognise. Nor is the difficulty confined to Europeans: Malays from Perak or Selangor find it almost as hard at first to understand or make themselves understood.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 74, 1916.\nThe following are a few of the more obvious differences in Kelantan pronunciation as compared to that of the Western States.\n\n(1) Final - a - ah - ak - ar become - aw.\nEvery where there is a tendency among Malays to pronounce apa or mana, when spoken by themselves, as if they were apah or manah: in Kelantan this is intensified, and the sound is definitely apaw, manaw, kitaw, etc.\nSo too one hears timaw for timah, kakaw for kakak and (though less pronouncedly) b\u0113sar for b\u0113sar.\n\n(2) Final -am, -ang, -an become - ain.\nWords like p\u0113tang, tuan, are pronounced so as to rhyme exactly with the French termination\u2014ain in \u201cdemain\u201d or \u201cbain;\u201d e.g. \u201cAwang dalang samalam, Tuan,\u201d has a nasal ring very different to the effect of the same sentence pronounced on the other side.\nBut most monosyllables, e.g. lain, kain and main are exceptions to this rule, and are pronounced as elsewhere. Cham however becomes \u201cchain.\u201d\n\n(3) Final - ai become - \u0101.\ne.g. pakai is pronounced pak\u0101, tupai is pronounced tup\u0101.\n\n(4) Medial - m or n before another consonant is omitted.\nThus K\u0113l\u0101ntan becomes K\u0113l\u0101tain, and tumpat tupat: in the case of the latter word, the final - t is practically inaudible, and thus the pronunciation of tumpat is indistinguishable from that of tupai noted above.\n\n(5) Final - s inaudible in many words.\ne.g. l\u0113pa for l\u0113pas, sa-bala for sa-balas (resembling) sa-b\u0113la for sa-b\u0113las (eleven). But the -s here taken away is reinstated sometimes where it has no business to be, e.g. duas for dua, Dollas for Dollah, pulos for puloh, and bharus for bharu.\n\n(6) Medial - ng before k is often omitted.\nThus longkah (which takes the place of the more common lekong in the F. M. S.) becomes lokah and chongkil choki.\n\nPhrases for Divisions of Time.\nOf the phrases given in Maxwell\u2019s Grammar, a few only are heard in Kelantan in common use, viz.\nJindera budak, about 9 p.m.\nTuli tenggala muda, about 9 a.m.\nTuli tenggala tua, about 11 a.m.\nLepas sembayang jumaat is more commonly heard than the technical phrase \u201clepas baadah salah.\u201d\nThe ordinary Kelantan Raiat more often employs, in place of these picturesque phrases, the name of the Mohammedan periods of prayer, somewhat loosely, to denote stages of the day, viz.\n\n*Dlohor*: any time from 12 noon to 2 p.m., and *l\u0113pas Dlohor* 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. [So too *pernama Dlohor*, the middle of the period, for 1 p.m. and even for 1 a.m.].\n\n*Asar*: Any time from 3.30 p.m. to about 6 p.m.\n\n*Maghrib* and *Isha* for after dark.\n\n*Suboh*, daybreak, does not trouble him much: [*b\u0113lum ch\u0113rah* or *b\u0113lum ayam terkukor* is the phrase he employs for that period].\n\nBut the only way by which he can denote at all accurately at what o\u2019clock a given event took place, and the method he feels most at home in using, is by pointing and indicating \u201cmatahari bagitu,\u201d taking himself as noon, behind his back as A.M. and in front of him as P.M.\n\n**Numbers.**\n\n\u201c*L\u0113kor*\u201d a score is in common use to describe numbers in the twenties. One never hears *dua puloh tujoh* naturally from a Kelantan Malay but *tujoh l\u0113kor*.\n\nAgain the use of *t\u0113ngah* is commoner than on the other side: *Tengah ampat puloh*, not *tiga puloh lima*.\n\n*Sa\u2019*, abbreviated from *satu* is common: *tiga puloh sa\u2019*, *korang sa\u2019 ampat puloh*.\n\nIn expressing sums which fall short of a round sum by 50 cts. use is made of *sa\u2019mas*, e.g. *korang sa\u2019mas $50, = $49.50 cts.*\n\n**Personal Pronouns.**\n\nThe most remarkable use is that of *kita* for \u201cyou.\u201d This is rather a polite use, or rather *kamu* is ruder. *Kita* (pron. *kitaw*) is the usual word.\n\nIt is also often used for \u201cI.\u201d\n\n*D\u0113ma* is often heard for \u201cthey.\u201d It is really a corruption of *dia sumua*, but illogically enough it is sometimes used for *dia*, \u201che,\u201d singular, and even for \u201cyou.\u201d\n\n*Achap Kali.* Often.\n\n*Ambo.* Pronounced \u2019mbu. Elephant language: said by the driver to make a kneeling elephant get up.\n\n*Anchak.* Drying fish screens.\n\n*Andor.* The cry of ploughman to his lembu to urge it to go to the left, pronounced *No No*: to the right is *cha chi chi*.\nANGIN BESAR. The great wind which swept Kelantan from shore to ulu about 30 years ago, tearing up houses and trees, lifting boats out of rivers and depositing them on dry land.

The judge then came out of the balai followed by the Court Officials, the parties to the case, and a crowd of spectators. Proceeding to the river bank, the judge ordered the Court Officials to catch hold of two male passers by, who were not in any way connected with the matter. The Judge allotted one as champion to the plaintiff and the other to the defendant, and ordered them both to dive under water 5 or 6 feet deep, holding fast to the posts which had been fixed in the river bed. The party, whose champion rose to the surface first lost the case.\n\n\"Another time two wrong doers were arrested for theft by the Budak Raja,\" who did the work of Policemen now-a-days. These two men accused each other of the crime, and both were willing to swear or do whatever the judge ordered. The judge called the Imam, who wrote something on a piece of metal, which was placed in a big pan full of coconut oil. The oil was then heated until it boiled, and the two men were then ordered, in front of the guards and the assembled people, to plunge their hands in and take out the piece of metal.\n\n\"It is wonderful to relate that by some magic in the metal the one who succeeded in seizing and drawing it out escaped scalding, and he was declared innocent. But the other, who was adjudged to be the culprit, had to suffer the consequence of plunging his hand in the boiling oil.\n\n\"This method of deciding a case, called \"Berchelor\" was often employed.\"\nINDEX.\n\nA\n\nAbortion by Derris, 129\nAcanthus ebracteatus, 155, 261\nilicifolius, 155, 261\nAcheen throne, 150, 155, 172, 175\nAcrotrema, 228\ncostatum, 242\nAdinandra dumosa, 244\nsylvestris, 244\nAegiceras majus, 190, 257\nAerides suavissima, 174, 266\nAeschynanthus grandiflora,\n228, 233, 259\nradicans, 237, 259\nvulubilis, 237, 259\nAfzelia retusa, 186, 249\nAgathis loranthifolia, 184, 265\nAgelaea vestita, 197, 248\nAglaia odorata, 189, 220, 247\nsp., 247\nAglaionema oblongifolium, 174\nmarantifolium, 268\nAgricultural Society of Bencoolen, 211\nAlepas gigas, 298\nmalaysiana, 290\nAleurites triloba, 139, 265\nAllomorpha exigua, 252\nAlpinia assimilis, 160, 266\ncapitellata, 234, 266\nelatior, 225, 266\nnutica, 160, 162\npunicia, 160, 162\nsp., 266\nAlsodeia, 219, 243\nAltingia excelsa, 183\nAmomum biflorum, 266\nAnanas sativa, 266\nAnisophyllae trapezoidalis, 250\nAnnandale, N., On Barnacles, 281\nAnoectochilus sp., 266\nAnplectrum divaricatum, 253\nglaucum, 234\nviminale, 253\nAntidesma frutescens, 264\nAraliaceae, 254\nArchyt\u00e6a vahlii, 181, 244\nArdisia divergens, 196, 219, 257\nhumilis, 175, 178\njavanica, 257\npunctata, 219\nArenga saccharifera, 244\nArgostemma humile, 255\nAristolochia hastata, 263\nArtictis Binturong, 200\nArum, 174, 268\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, 186\nAuber, Captain, 234\nAvicennia resinifera, 220\nsp., 262\n\nB\n\nBaccaurea bracteata, 264\nmalayana, 265\nmotleyana, 158, 264\nBali Straits, barnacles from, 281\nBannerman, Colonel J.
