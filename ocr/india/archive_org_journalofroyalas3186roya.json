I.\u2014Contributions towards a Glossary of the Assyrian Language. By H. F. Talbot.\n\nI think it may be of some utility to the Students of the Assyrian Language to bring together in the form of a Glossary a certain number of words of which the meaning appears to be established with a reasonable amount of probability. I have here presented to the Society the commencement of such a work, to be continued, as I hope, on a future occasion. I have not followed any alphabetical order, but have numbered the words, so that in the event of their becoming sufficiently numerous, an alphabetical index referring to these numbers may be added. I have been very careful to refer to passages in which the words are found, so as to enable any one to verify their accuracy. I have used some typographical abbreviations, the principal of which are the following:\n\nL. . . . First Vol. of British Museum Inscriptions. Edited by Layard, 1851.\n\nR. . . . Second Vol. of British Museum Inscriptions. Edited by Rawlinson, 1861.\n\n2 R. . . . Third Vol. of British Museum Inscriptions. Edited by the same, 1866.\n\nR. A. S. . .

Ana Marduk ilu bani-ya, \"Unto Marduk the god my creator (or, my father).\" The same as the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4, Deus. In 2R31, line 11 of col. 2, we find another spelling of the word, viz. \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 Ili, which is explained by \ud808\udd97 the usual symbol for a god. The same is repeated in line 20. But No. 754 of the Syllabary explains \ud808\udd97 by \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 Ilu. The plural is sometimes Ilim \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97, as in the name of King Ashur-resh-Ilum \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 father of Tiglath Pileser I. His name signifies \"Ashur is the chief of the gods.\"\u2014See R15, line 42.\n\n2. **Shamie.** \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97, Heaven.\u2014B.N. 1, 13. Agrees exactly with the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05dd.\n\n3. **Irtsit.** \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97, Earth.\u2014B.N. 1, 13. The same as Heb. \u05d9\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05dd.\n\n4. **Sarru.** \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97, a King.\u20142R2, No. 330, where it is explained by \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 which is the usual symbol for a king. The same spelling and explanation is also found in 2R31, line 9 of col. 2. The same is again repeated in line 17. This is the Heb. \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e8 Prince, which is also written \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e8. In Daniel viii. 25, \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 is rendered in the authorised version \"Prince of princes.\" The word was pronounced simply Sar. Indeed the single letter \ud808\udd97 S\u0101r expresses \"King\" in R9, line 1, Ashur Sar kushat ilim; Ashur, King of the races of the gods.\n5. **Sarrat.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54, a Queen.\u20142 R 48, line 34. Many examples in 2 R 60, viz. lines 3, 14, 17, 24, 25, 26.\n\nWe read on the Tablet 100\u2014\"Ishtar, queen of heaven and of the stars.\" \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 Ishtar sarrat shamami u (....); the last word being of doubtful sound. Perhaps however shamami is an adjective, meaning \"heavenly.\" It occurs also in R 69, col. 3, line 54:\u2014\"The worship of San, chief of the gods, do thou establish in the hearts of the people\"\u2014where \"hearts\" have the epithet \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 shamami, meaning either \"heavenly\" or \"pious.\"\n\n(I took tribute from) Samsi, queen of the Arabians \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54.\u2014Inscription of Sargon at Khorsabad.\n\n6. **Sarrut.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54, a Kingdom, Royalty.\u20142 R 38, line 45. Guza sarruti su \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 his royal throne. See R 59, line 64.\n\n*Sarrut-sin*, their Kingdoms, \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54.\u20142 R 67, line 4, which says \"he conquered all the lands and ruled their kingdoms;\" ebusu sarrut-sin.\n\n7. **Sarrut.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd54, Elementary Instruction. Concerning this word I formerly wrote as follows:*\u2014\"Sarrut, in this sense, has, I believe, nothing to do with the common word sarrut (kingdom). It here means \"elementary instruction,\" and is derived from the Chaldee \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0, inchoavit. However different these two meanings of sarrut may seem, yet they had a common origin, to which the Latin language offers an exact parallel. On the one hand we have princeps, principatus, &c., implying royal power (the first in rank), while on the other hand we have principium, the beginning of a thing (the first in time), and principia, the first principles of a science, its very elements. So a child's primer is his \"premier livre.\" These remarks referred to an inscription\n\n* Transactions of the R.S.L., Vol. 8, p. 107.\noften found on the grammatical tablets in the British Museum, saying that \"King Ashurbanipal caused these dippi sarruti\" to be written for the promotion of learning\u2014which no king had ever done before him\"\u2014dippi sarruti meaning \"tablets of instruction.\"\n\nIn this word as in many others the Chaldee changes \u0219 into \u0219, having taruta (instruction at school) for sarrut.\n\nI have since found a remarkable confirmation of this explanation on a tablet 2 R 2, No. 370, where Dip Sarru is explained to mean Dippi Rish, \"tablet of the commencement.\" In 2 R 60, line 34, the god Nebo, who was, like Hermes, the god of eloquence and learning, has the title Banu sitri dip sarruti.\n\nAuthor of the writings on the Tablets of Primary Instruction.\n\n8. Kha, and Khu. are the well-known symbols for a Fish and a Bird. They are very often coupled together by way of contrast. Those were probably their names in the Proto-Chaldean language. These words occur together in 2 R 40, lines 17 and 18 of col. 2, accompanied by an Assyrian version, as follows:\n\n9. Nuni. a Fish (oblique case), explained by Kha. This agrees perfectly with the Heb. nun, a fish.\n\n10. Itsuri. a Bird; explained by Khu. This is the oblique case; the nominative case or simple form of the word is Itsur. Numerous examples occur in the inscriptions, ex gr.\n\n11. Ini Itsuri. Bird's Eye; the name of a stone. This name is found in a long list of stones 2 R 40. The corresponding Proto-Chaldean term is of which the first sign means \"Eye,\" the second \"Bird,\" and the third is the syllable na, which I\ntake to be a case ending. Modern languages have similar names for stones, such as Cat\u2019s Eye, &c.\n\n12. **Itsurish** (adv.). Like a Bird. *Itsurish ipparas* \u201che fled like a bird,\u201d \u2014R39, 57. For this in other passages we find *kima itsuri* (like a bird). For instance, in the Annals of Esarhaddon, line 45 of col. 1, \u201cSanduarri fled to the mountains, but I caught him like a bird,\u201d *kima itsuri*; which is contrasted with another statement in line 17, \u201cKing Abd-Astarte fled over the Sea, but I caught him like a fish,\u201d *kima nuni*. See also 2R19, line 40 of col. 2, *kima itzuri*, which phrase is accompanied by a Proto-Chaldaean translation, The last sign is *kim* (like unto), which always follows in this language, whereas in Assyrian *kima* always precedes.\n\n*Nunu itsuru*, Fish and Birds, R65, 19, where it is said these were offered to the gods. Thus written\n\nMany birds are named on the Tablet 2R37, some of which I will add here.\n\n13. **Kuku.** probably the Cuckoo, 2R37, line 4, and again line 54. This bird has not changed its note since the days of Aristophanes:\n\n\\[ \\chi\\omega\\pi\\theta' \\ \\delta\\ \\kappa\\kappa\\kappa\\upsilon\\ \\varepsilon\\iota\\pi\\omega\\iota\\ \\kappa\\kappa\\kappa\\upsilon! \\&c. \\]\n\nOpv. 505.\n\n14. **Laklak.**, the Stork, 2R37, line 8; rendered in the other column, which is probably in a different dialect, *laklakku*. This bird was so named from the clattering of its bill. It is an onomatopoeia or imitation of a natural sound. The Stork has that name in many eastern languages, which have been carefully brought together by Pott and R\u00f6diger in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. 4, page 31 (Bonn 1841), from which I will make the following extract:\n\n\u201cThe Stork is called in Kurdish *l\u00e9gh l\u00e9gh*; in Bucharian\nand another language *lagh lagh* (see Burnes's Travels, II. 148, of the German translation), so also in Tartarian (see Klaproth's Tour in Caucasus, II. 275): in Persian *legleg*: Arabic *leg leg*, ex sono quem rostro crepitante edit. Hindi *laka laka*; Albanian \u039b\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03b5. See Bochart's Hierozoicon, III. 88.\"\n\n15. **Ummi Mie.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97, literally \"Water Mother,\" probably what we call the Water Hen, 2R37, line 56. It is also written \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 (Mother of Waters), same plate line 6; and in the Proto-Chaldaean version it stands thus: \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97, which has the same meaning, since the first sign means mother, the second water, and the third bird.\n\n16. **Itsur Mushi.** \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 i.e. Bird of Night, probably the Owl, 2R40, line 29; and again 2R37, line 31, spelt the same.\n\n17. **Itsur rabi.** \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 (literally \"the Great Bird\"), 2R37, line 10, explained pazpaz or patch-patch. This is unknown, unless it be the Hindi *petcha* or *p\u00eatscha*, an Owl, which Pott mentions in the same page of the Zeitschrift.\n\n18. **Itsur titsi.** \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97.\u20142R37, line 40. This may mean a Bird of Omen; for *titsu* is used for luck, lot, fortune. The Proto-Chaldaean translation is \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 which means bird, followed by \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 *gizi*. This Proto-Chaldaean or Accadian word \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \"a bird\" also occurs in lines 41, 48, and 49, besides lines 32, 33, in which the commencement is broken off. It may therefore be considered as well established.\n\n19. **Nashru.** \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97, probably the Eagle.\u20142R37, line 9. Heb. \u05d0\u05b2\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 aquila, Arab. id. Syriac nashra.* This word is\n\n---\n\n* The Coptic has *nasher* (Tattam's Egyptian Dictionary, p. 315). Is this an ancient Egyptian word?\ntranslated in the other language by \u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03b3\u03b7, or using Hebrew letters \u05d9\u05b5\u05e8\u05b0\u05e2\u05b4\u05d9 (for \u05d9\u05b5\u05e8\u05b0\u05e2\u05b4\u05d9 often replaces the Hebrew \u05d9). Now it is very interesting to observe how closely this corresponds to the old German Aro, an Eagle (see Graff's Alt-hoch-deutsch Dictionary, p. 432). He compares also the Gothic ara and Nord. ari. But the word Aar still exists in modern German, and its compounds Fisch-aar, a fishing eagle (falco halicetus); Huhner aar, the hen-harrier. And it is well known that Adel-are (the noble eagle) has become Adler.\n\nAs regards Eastern languages, Pott says* that the Kurdish and two other tongues have Alt\u014d, an eagle.\n\nSince writing the above I have found that \u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03b3\u03b7 Eru is a Chaldee word for some kind of Eagle. \u03b3\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2 gryphus; avis rapax.\u2014Schindler, p. 1379.\n\n20. Agammi. \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Reeds. Also a Marsh where reeds grow.\u2014Bell. line 7. Heb. \u05d0\u05b8\u05d2\u05b8\u05dd agam; palus, arundo: plur. \u05d0\u05b8\u05d2\u05d5\u05b9\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd.\n\n21. Apparati. \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Rushes.\u2014Bell. line 7. This is the Chald. aparat, \u05d7\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0, a rush (see Buxtorf, p. 197).\n\n\"He hid himself kireb agammi u apparati, among the reeds and rushes: and his lurking place could not be found.\" (Account of the escape of Merodach Baladan, on Bellino's Cylinder.)\n\n22. Shanat. \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, a Year.\u20142 R12, line 14. Also R16, 27, spelt in the same way; where \"the harvest-time of the year\" is spoken of. Another spelling is Sanna, \u03a3\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1, a year, Bell. line 49, which passage I have translated \"during sixteen years,\" &c. The Heb. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05df annum agrees exactly.\n\n23. Arakh. \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f0d\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, a Month.\u20142 R12, line 15. This word agrees entirely with the Heb. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05da\u05b0 irakh or yarakh, a month.\n\n* Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, p. 31.\nAnother spelling is *Arkhu*, 2 R 40, line 41, and again 2 R 1, No. 85, which is rendered , the usual symbol for a \"month.\"\n\n24. **Tamu.** , a Day; plur. *tami*, , Days.\u2014Phil. 1, 16: Bell. 35. An extremely common word.\n\n25. **Lilat.** The Night. This word seldom occurs. It is very interesting as being exactly the same with the Heb. \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4. In 2 R 32, line 18, after certain phrases in which the word *tamu* occurs, such as *tamu pani* and *tamu makhri* (the day before, or a former day), we read:\n\n*Lilatu.* , Night: which is explained , Sakhar tami, \"the dark part of the day,\" from Heb. \u05e9\u05d7\u05e8 obscurus, niger.\n\nIn 2 R 25, line 25, the word *tamu* (day) is immediately followed by its correlative *Lilatu*, night (spelt as before). And it is observable that *tamu* is explained by two Hebrew words, viz., by *immu* , which is the Heb. \u05d9\u05d5\u05de dies, and by *urru* , which is the Heb. \u05dc\u05b5\u05d1\u05b6\u05ea lux.\n\nIn a long list of the gods on the Tablet K 220 the god of day and the god of night, *tamu* and *lila*, stand next each other, and . It is doubtful whether the words as *lilatti* (R 32, 18) signify \"in the night,\" that passage containing mystical praises of the god Ninev.\n\n**Observation.**\u2014Herodotus says (III. 8) that the Arabians worshipped only two gods, Dionysus and Urania. These were undoubtedly the Sun and Moon (see the notes of Commentators on the passage). Herodotus adds that the Arabians called the moon *Alilat*. But it is more probable that they called her *Sarrat ha lilat*, Queen of the Night; which would easily be mistaken by a foreigner for a proper name, Queen Halilat.\n\nThere is, however, another explanation possible, viz., that *\u0391\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4* may have meant the planet Venus. The morning\nstar is called \u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 in Isaiah xiv. 12. Considered as a goddess, her name among the Arabians would be \u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4, which is nearly identical in sound with \u0391\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4.\n\nHerodotus adds, that the Arabians called the sun Orotal. With respect to this important passage I have a conjecture to offer, which perhaps is new. I think that Orotal is undoubtedly the Chaldee word \u05d0\u05b2\u05d2\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc \u201ca dish of gold\u201d (Ezra i. 9). If the G in this word were pronounced gutturally it would sound as nearly as possible Orotal. But in order to make this clearer I will add, that the Greek \u0394\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (whence the English dish and A. Sax. disk; and Swedish diskar, dishes) meant originally a round plate; but afterwards came to mean anything flat and circular, as a quoit, a disc, the disc of the sun. So in Persian the same word (\u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0647) signifies a round dish, cup, saucer, &c., and also the disc of the sun or moon. The word tasht in the same language possesses the same two meanings. On this subject I will make a short quotation from a former work of mine (English Etymologies, p. 211). \u201cSeveral nations seem to have remarked an analogy between the light of the two great luminaries and the colour of the two precious metals, gold and silver. This is partly, no doubt, fanciful and poetical, but nevertheless it is remarkable enough that it should exist at all: such a coincidence being entirely casual and fortuitous in its nature. The silvery light of the moon is quite proverbial. For this reason the moon in India is chandra, from chand, silver. And in Persian poetry she is \u201cthe silvery orb,\u201d tasht-i-simin. The sun is sometimes called in Persian Zartushti or tasht-i-zer, the golden orb (zer, gold; tasht, a disk). And in honour of the sun, I conceive, was named the celebrated philosopher Zerdusht, whom the Greeks have called Zoroaster, retaining the first part of his name, but altering the second into \u0391\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd, equivalent in their language to the Persian tasht, an orb or disk.\u201d\n\nSupported by these analogies, it does not seem a rash supposition that the Arabians may have called the sun Orotal, with the meaning of \u201cthe golden disc.\u201d\nIt may be added, that the first Zoroaster was evidently mythical (probably a mere name for the sun himself). Berosus informs us (as quoted by Syncellus) that Zoroaster was the first king of the Babylonians (Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, Vol. I, p. 195). And so also the Sun was fabled to have been one of the prim\u00e6val kings of Egypt.\n\n26. **Tahu** or **Tahhu.** Darkness. This translation is only offered as *probable*. It rests on the following grounds: On the Tablet 2 R 32, line 19, *Lilatu*, the night, is rendered by the word *Tahu* (written as above). This is further confirmed by the Tablet 2 R 25, line 25, where *lilatu* is rendered *tahatu* or *takhatu*, which only differs from the former word by the addition of the servile *n* so usual in Hebrew. Now I think that this may possibly be the word *\u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05d7\u05b2\u05d5*, which is found in Gen. i. 2, where it is said \"the Earth was *tahu* and *bahu*,\" or \"*tohu* and *bohu*.\" If so, the meaning would be \"the Earth was darkness and emptiness.\"\n\n27. **Abnu.** Stone.\u2014Birs N. 20. The other cylinder has the variant spelling *Abnam* This word agrees exactly with the Heb. *\u05d0\u05d1\u05df*, a stone.\n\n28. **Kaspa.** Silver.\u20142 R 58, line 67 of col. 2. This agrees entirely with the Chald. *\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e1\u05b5\u05e3* silver.\n\n29. **Khurassu.** Gold. This follows the preceding word, *ibid.* The oblique case is Khurassi, as in the phrase \"a sceptre of gold.\"\u20142 R 19, line 27.\n\nThis word is evidently the original of the Greek *\u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2*. It also agrees entirely with the Heb. *\u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05dd* gold.\n\n30. **Zamat.** The name of a stone exceedingly prized by the Assyrians. It is mentioned continually, but it is very difficult to say what it was. Various conjectures have been offered, but I do not see that any proofs have been\nbrought forward, and therefore I shall venture to suggest a different solution. The first difficulty is found in the transliteration of the word, for the sign \u1f00\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 has so many different values that they cause perplexity. I find a passage in 2 R 19, line 27, which says \"In my right hand I held a sceptre of gold and \u1f41\u03ba\u03bd\u03af stone;\" while the P.C. translation in line 24 has, \"in my right hand a sceptre of gold and \u1f41\u03ba\u03bd\u03af stone.\" Now if we turn to the reverse of the tablet, lines 47 and 48, we read \"I took possession of a quarry (or mine?) of three (specified) sorts of stone.\" The third is the \u1f41\u03ba\u03bd\u03af in Proto-Chaldean, which is translated \u1f41\u03ba\u03bd\u03af in Assyrian, the same as before. Therefore I think there is considerable probability that \u1f41\u03ba\u03bd\u03af was the true Assyrian name of the stone. Now we find in Hebrew a word not unlike this, namely, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d4 or in Syriac \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d4, also \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d4 (Buxtorf), which has the signification of phiala, crater, scyphus, &c., according to Schindler and others. The LXX render it \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2. Now supposing for an instant that this may be the same word with the Assyrian \u1f41\u03ba\u03bd\u03af, let us consider of what kind of stone which could be \u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, or shaped by the turner's art, cups, goblets and vases, were ever made by the ancients? The answer will perhaps be\u2014the onyx stone; for that precious stone was much used for the smaller kind of vases, insomuch that onyx is used absolutely for a \"vase\" for that reason. Nardi parvus onyx (Hor.). Uuguentum quod onyx modo parva gerebat (Martial).\n\nCommentators are agreed that onyx (when large masses are spoken of) means alabaster.* Pavements were even made of it by the wealthy and luxurious Romans:\n\nTot\u0101que effusus in aul\u0101\nCalcabatur onyx.\u2014Lucan.\n\nEt tua centenis stat porticus alta columnis,\nCalcatusque tuo sub pede lucet onyx.\u2014Mart.\n\n* The vase of the ancient king Naram Sin, found at Babylon, was of alabaster. See the article Alabaster in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, with the figures of Vases.\nThis precious material \u03bf\u03c5\u03be\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf\u03c5\u03be\u03bf\u03c2, unguis, is said to have been so called from its being transparent like the nail. This may be so, and yet, perhaps, such a name for the stone may have been suggested to the Greeks and Romans by the native name ukn\u00ee, which is not unlike ungue. Admitting, however, that such conjectures are uncertain, let us proceed to enquire what was the Hebrew name for the onyx, the value and great estimation of which are sufficiently shown by the passage in Genesis ii. 12, \u201cThe river Pison compasseth the whole land of Havilah. The gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\u201d The original Hebrew is \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05df \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05de\u05b6\u05df. It is probable that this was pronounced sam, sama; or else sham, shama; and if we add the usual feminine ending, the letter \u05e0, it will become samat or shamat. My conjecture therefore is, that this was the precious zamat stone.\n\nWe have seen that the Bible calls Havilah \u201cthe land of the onyx stone.\u201d There is a passage in the Annals of Esarhaddon (R46, col. iv, 10) which greatly resembles this in character: \u201cThe land of Bikni, which is the land of the zamat stone.\u201d This land, according to the same inscription, bordered on the further Media.\n\n31. Bul. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc, Life.\u2014Ex. Vallanu-ya as bul sar makhri: Before my time, during the life of the late king.\u2014R50, col. i. 7. Marduk rahim bul-su; Marduk who loves (or cherishes) the king\u2019s life.\u20142 R38, col. iv. 53.\n\n32. Bullut. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc \u05dc\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9, Life.\u20142 R16, line 44 of last col. In this passage, bullut the life (of the king) is opposed to mat sarri his death (in line 42). The Proto-Chaldaean translation is curious: (king) is rendered bel, lord. Death is rendered durga, and Life, tili. The latter is frequent in Assyrian.\n\nBulthut signifies \u201calive.\u201d Beh. line 67, in the account of a battle, \u201cI captured 4182 of them alive,\u201d bulthut nzzabbit.\n33. **Bullu\u0101.** (plural), Living.\u2014Used only in the Achaemenian inscriptions. \"Ormuzd made the Earth ... and the lot of all men living therein;\" nisi as libbi bullua. See the Art. Tuki, No. 39.\n\n34. **Bullul.** , to Live.\u20142 R 38, line 48. Bul-su as tuki lu-bullul; may he live a life of good fortune!\n\n35. **Bul.** , a Year.\u2014Occurs frequently on the Obelisk. *Ex. gr.* \"In my fifth year.\" The plural of this word seems to be *palie*, \"Grant, O Sun, labar palie-ya; that my years may be prolonged!\"\u2014R 51, col. ii. 20, of the Senkereh Inscription.\n\n36. **Balat.** , Life.\u2014Senk. col. ii. 18. \"Grant me balat tami rukuti, a life of prolonged days!\" Birs N. col. ii. 20, \"Grant me baladam dara a long life!\" Another spelling of this word is Balathu. Nabonidus says (R 68, 22) \"Grant me balathu tami rukuti; a life of long days!\" From this form of the word the adjective bulthut \"alive\" is easily derived. We also find the participle Bal \"living,\" for some remarks on which see the end of the article Mut.\n\n37. **Napishtu.** , Life.\u2014Bell. line 7, Napishtu ekhir; he saved his life. It also means the Soul. Bell. line 19, Napishtu val etzib; \"Not one soul escaped.\" On one of the bulls this phrase is changed for \"Edu val etzib,\" not one escaped. Chald. unus. In other passages also I think that napishtu signifies one or alone. Napishtu is the Hebrew anima.\n\n38. **Zi.** , Life.\u2014The plural is always written Ana suzup zi-su, to save his life.\u2014Obel. 79 and in many other passages. There is an inscription (R 35) on the statues of Nebo, which some great officers of state presented to the temple of that god, pro salute domini regis. In line 8 we\nread that they were dedicated \"ana ti (for the health) of the King; and ana ti (for the health) of Queen Semiramis his wife; ana ti zi-su (for the happiness of their lives) the happiness of their years, the tranquillity of their House and of their people.\" The word ti I have translated \"health,\" but perhaps it is the abbreviation of some longer word.\n\nZi (life) seems a non-Semitic word; it greatly resembles the Doric Greek \u03b6\u03b7\u03bd to live, \u03b6\u03b7 he lives.\n\n39. Tuki. Fortune, Good Luck (in the oblique cases; the nominative case is tuku).\u2014I have already (see No. 34) given an example of this word\u2014bul-su as tuki lubbullul; may he live a life of Good Fortune!\u20142 R 38, col. ii. 48.\n\nSo in the Inscription of Nabonidus (R 69, col. ii. 50) where the King says the long sought-for \"foundation stone\" of the temple was at last found \"partly through my good luck (tuki), and partly through my ardent zeal.\"\n\nBut the very important and frequent use of this word in the Achaemenian inscriptions induces me to make a short extract from a former paper of mine on one of those inscriptions (R.A.S. Vol. 19, page 264). It begins\u2014\"Ilim rabu Ahurmasda, sha shamie u kiti ibnu; sha nisi ibnu; sha tuki ana nisi iddinnu; sha ana Dariaus sar sha sarin madut ibnu.\" Of which I gave the following Latin translation:\u2014\"Deorum summus Oromasdes qui calum et terram creavit; qui homines creavit; qui fortunam cujusque hominibus dedit; qui Darium regem regum multorum creavit.\" And then, in order to justify my translation of tuki as \"fortunam cujusque,\" I added the following note:\u2014Tuki. A great many conjectures have been offered respecting this unknown word. Some have translated \"qui vitam hominibus dedit,\" but this differs too little in meaning from the preceding phrase \"qui homines creavit.\" Others render it \"who hath given food to men.\" And many other things might be suggested.\nBut if we consider the sequence of ideas we shall see that they are:\n\n1. Ormuzd is the greatest of the gods.\n2. He created Heaven and Earth.\n3. He created Men.\n4. All their various fortunes are dependent on his will.\n5. And he has willed that Darius should be king of the world.\n\nThus there is nothing superfluous in this solemn exordium, as the mention of \"food\" would assuredly be.\n\n*Tuki* much resembles the Greek word *Tu\u03c7\u03b7*. I am in doubt whether the resemblance is accidental or not. There is some difficulty in supposing that this Greek word could be adopted into the Assyrian language; but on the other hand, there had been intercourse between the two nations long before the age of Darius.\n\nThere is a curious variation of this word in an inscription of Xerxes (Westergaard's C), where the phrases are exactly the same, but instead of *tuku* we find *dunku*.\n\nBut so also in Greek: compare *Tu\u03c7\u03b7* with *Tu\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd*.\n\nWestergaard's H has \"Oromasda, who made Heaven and Earth and the Waters; who gave all their various fortunes to the men that dwell therein;\" sha tuki gabbi iddimnu nisi as libbi bullu\u0101.\n\nWestergaard's E says, \"who gave their lot (*tuku*) to men, and gave royalty (*sarruti*) to Xerxes.\"\n\nThe inscription of Darius at Hamadan varies from the rest, and says \"who gave all prosperity to men;\" sha gabbi nukhsu ana nisi iddimnu. The form *duku* appears to occur R59, line 66, where the king says that he was Marduk's vicegerent upon earth. \"Thou hast made me ruler of all men, to watch over them all, like thy own exalted providence;\" kinna dukn-ka billu, which is written , *duku*.\n\n40. Naru. , a River.\u20142 R50, col. iv. 5. It is there explained , which is the usual symbol for a\nriver. This word is found in Hebrew, \u05d0\u05b8\u05de\u05b5\u05df Amen. The oblique case is nari \u05e0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9, 2 R16, line 19, as nari tabbali, to immerse in the river; perhaps from Hebrew \u05de\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05dc immersit. Ana naru; into the river.\u20142 R10, line 6, spelt \u05e0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05df.\n\n41. Idikkur. \u05d0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8 (though possibly this should be read Idiklat), the River Tigris.\u20142 R50, col. iv. 7. It is there explained \u05d0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8, which is the usual name of the Tigris. Idikkur (or Idiklat) is the biblical Hiddekel, in the original Hebrew \u05d7\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d3\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc. This was one of the four rivers of Paradise. The LXX render it \u03a4\u03c5\u03b3\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, in which almost all commentators have followed them. (See Gen. ii. 14.) According to Rawlinson in R.A.S. Vol. 11, page 159, the Tigris was called in ancient Persian Tigr\u00e1, and in the accusative case Tigr\u00e1m. He says: \u201cAccording to the consentaneous testimony of the Greek and Latin authors, the term signifying in the old Persian language \u201can arrow\u201d was applied to the river in consequence of the rapidity of its current... and it is, no doubt, the same term which has been softened in modern Persian into tir.\u201d\n\nHe observes further, that the Chaldee name of the river is \u05d0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8, but that Onkelos and Jonathan write \u05d0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8.* He justly rejects Gesenius\u2019s opinion, that Hiddekel was a Hebrew word unconnected with Tigris.\n\nIn the Behistun Inscription, line 34, the Tigris has its usual name \u05d0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8, but in the very next line it is called the Diklat \u05d0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8.\n\nStrabo says that Tigris meant \u201can arrow\u201d in the Median language: \u039c\u03b7\u03b4\u03b1\u03bd \u03a4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03be\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1.\u2020 Pliny says \u201cqu\u00e0 tardior fluit Dighito; unde concitatur, \u00e0 celeritate Tigris incipit vocari; ita appellant Medi sagittam.\u201d\n\n* I may observe in passing, that this \u05d0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8 diglat, in the sense of \u201carrow\u201d or \u201carrows,\u201d forms the first part of the name of Tiglath Pileser.

**Zida.** (in P.C.), the Right Hand.\u2014Hence Beth Zida (spelt as above), a splendid temple (or rather class of temples) continually mentioned in the inscriptions.\n\nThe name means literally *domus fortunata*, because the right hand was always esteemed fortunate. *Zida* is probably the Arabic \u0641\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064f\u0647\u064f Fortuna bona: felicitas: fatum (and I believe the goddess of good fortune had that name). Schindler (p. 1231) also gives the adj. \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9, which he transcribes *said*, and renders *felix, beatus, fortunatus*.\n\nI now return to the phrases quoted in No. 46, from 2 R 19. \"In my right hand\" is translated in Proto-Chaldee, *It zida mu* ; and \"In my left hand\" is translated, *It itbu mu* . It signifies \"hand,\" as in Assyrian, and in Heb. \u05d9\u05b7\u05d3 manus; *mu* is an affixed pronoun, \"my.\" *It mu*, my hand. See 2 R 10, line 20, where the P.C. it bi (his hand) is rendered in Assyrian *idi-su* . It will be observed that the P.C. word for the \"left hand\" commences with the sign , which is *it* or *id*. I therefore read it *itbu*. But Oppert, page 339, line 5, gives the value *kap* to this sign. If so, the \"left hand\" would be *kabbu*, which may be the word \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7 infirmus (Sch.), therefore meaning \"the weak hand.\"\n\nThis new word *Zida* (the Right) may possibly help to explain the obscure Chaldee adverb *adar zida* \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b6\u05d6\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05d4, which occurs in Ezra vii. 23. Gesenius translates it rect\u00e9. He says it is a non-Semitic word, probably borrowed from the Persian or some other foreign language. Our authorised translation has \"diligently.\" \"Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven.\"\n\nIf the word comes from *Zida*, I think there are two ways in which it may be explained:\n\n(1) It may mean \"very rightly,\" giving to \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b6\u05d6\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05d4 the sense of very or greatly. For, so we find from gazrin \u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05d6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05df judges, the compound *adar-gazrin* \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b6\u05d2\u05b0\u05d6\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05d4 chief judges\n(Dan. iii.; see Gesenius, p. 18); and from \u05de\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 king, \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9 \u05de\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \"great king,\" the god of Sepharvaim.\n\n(2) Another supposition is that \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8 in this word was originally \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8, which root signifies ordinare, to set in order; so that adar zida would be \"in right order.\" \"Whatsoever is commanded by the Lord, let it be done in right order for the house of the Lord.\"\n\n48. **Annama.** \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05dd, a Treaty of Peace.\u20142 R 65, 4. A word formed per metathesin* from the Heb. Amana, a treaty. Gesenius says \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05dd fidelus. The root is \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05dd, as a subst. fides; veritas; as an adj. fidus (see the next No.).\n\n49. **Mamitu.** \u05de\u05b7\u05de\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05bc, a Promise, Faith.\u20142 R 65, 4. Mamitu as eli mitsri annama ana akhati iddinu; they gave a promise (or pledged faith) to one another, to make a firm treaty of peace. This word mamitu (pledge, promise) is easily derived from the Heb. \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05dd fides.\n\nIn line 7 we read that the above \"promise\" was duly performed, and that the kings of Assyria and Babylonia (or rather their successors) annama ukinu, established a firm treaty of peace.\n\n50. **Shabati.** \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9, Conspirators (lit. \"sworn men\").\u2014R 50, col. ii. 8, where it is said that the Babylonian conspirators were chained together in gangs. From Heb. \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1 jurare. (Lat. conjurati, conspirators.)\n\n51. **Akkhar.** \u05d0\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05d7\u05b8\u05e8, Foreign.\u2014Alius, alienus. Heb. \u05d0\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05d7\u05b8\u05e8 aliust. All the Achaemenian kings style themselves \"the great king, the king of kings, the king of nations of every foreign tongue;\" sha akkhar lishan gabi. In their inscriptions the word is spelt \u05d0\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05d7\u05b8\u05e8 or \u05d0\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05d7\u05b8\u05e8 or \u05d0\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05d7\u05b8\u05e8 in the inscription of Hamadan.\n\n* Such transpositions are common in Hebrew, for instance, \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05df fo Vestis.\u2014Gesen.\n52. **Ilu sha akkhari.** \\( \\text{\u5076\u50cf} \\), an Idol, a God of the Foreigners.\u20142 R 4, No. 729. This is a remarkable gloss, inasmuch as it agrees exactly with the Hebrew phrase so frequent in the Old Testament \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd Elohim akharim, Idols; literally \u201cother gods\u201d or \u201cforeign gods.\u201d\n\nThe P.C. translation is G\u00fa \\( \\text{\u5076\u50cf} \\), which, therefore, signifies an idol in that language.\n\nFor *Ilu* see No. 1, where it is spelt in a similar manner.\n\n53. **Kharran.** \\( \\text{\u9053\u8def} \\), a Road (the full form is Kharranu \\( \\text{\u9053\u8def} \\)).\u20142 R 38, line 25. Ana mat Illipi azzabit kharranu illamu-ya; I took the road straight before me to the land of Illipi.\u2014Bell. l. 28. This phrase \u201cazzibit kharran,\u201d I took the road, becomes in the *sha* or causative conjugation \u201cushazbit kharran\u201d I made (another person) take the road. Of this I will give an example: R 40, 32\u2014They had fled over the sea to the land of the Susians . . . I brought back the fugitives in Syrian ships, and *I made them take the road* to Assyria; ushazbit kharran Ashur-ki.\n\n54. **Darag.** \\( \\text{\u9053\u8def} \\), a Road.\u2014Agrees exactly with the Heb. \u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 derek, via: iter.\u20142 R 38, line 25. I opened ways over lofty mountains and amira duruk-sun, I made with labour their roads \\( \\text{\u9053\u8def} \\).\u2014Opp. Khors. plate 1, line 15. I deduce amira from the very common word mir \u201cwork,\u201d which is found in such phrases as \u201cana epish miri suati\u201d to finish this work.\n\nAnother example of the Hebrew words \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 a road, and \u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 a road, is the following, from the inscription of Tiglath Pileser, R 12, 56: Arkhi ittuti by lofty roads; durgi la pituti through paths not opened (or not made practicable), ushatik I marched. Thus written: \\( \\text{\u9053\u8def} \\), arkhi, and \\( \\text{\u9053\u8def} \\), durgi.\n\nThe printed text of the above passage has tapituti, but I think this must be a mistake (perhaps of the original scribe)\nfor la pituti, since the inscription of Sennacherib (R40, 4) has urkhi la pituti.\n\n55. Urkhu. L\u8239\u53ea B\u963f\u6839, a Road.\u20142 R38, line 24, where it is made equivalent to Kharran. This word seems to occur in R59, col. ii. 21, where the king says \"I traversed Kharanam naraza, dangerous roads; and urukh zuma, paths that were (...)(perhaps arid or thirsty, from \u05de\u05d9\u05dd sitilundus, thirsty).\n\nThis word Uruk agrees well with the Heb. \u05d9\u05d0\u05e8\u05ea via, semita; which is only used in Hebrew poetry. It is remarkable to observe how many common Assyrian words are poetical in Hebrew. The resemblance is perhaps still closer with the Chaldee \u05d9\u05d0\u05e8\u05ea\u05d0, Syriac \u05d9\u05d0\u05e8\u05ea\u05d0, a way, road, journey.\n\nI will give some additional examples of the word. In R40, 4, urkhi la pittuti roads not opened.\n\nOpp. Khors. 11, line 110: The king of Ethiopia fled from the battle and took the road to a place of safety. Here \"the road\" is expressed by urukh _look_ but the verb \"he took\" is lost by a fracture. Ashar la hari, \"a place of safety,\" occurs also on the Taylor Cylinder (R37, 18). Another example is found in Opp. Khors. 12, line 114, zzzzurukh-su, which Oppert translates \"secutus sum viam ejus.\" In the same plate, line 118, is a remarkable passage: \"Dalta, king of Illipi, my faithful servant, had died,\" which is expressed by illika urukh muti, \"had gone the road of death.\" Oppert also translates it \"iverat viam mortis,\" except that he takes the verb for a plural.\n\n58. Nisi. L\u8239\u53ea/library, Men.\u2014R59, line 64. Thou hast given me sarruti kisha nisi, sovereign power over the races of men, _look_. Same plate, col. ii. 29, _look_in nisi_; among men. In the great E.I.H. Inscription, col. i. 44, Ana sutishur nisi _look_, \"for the government of men.\"\n\nThis word answers, though not very closely, to the Syriac \u05d0\u5b8f\u5927 homo: \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05d4 filius hominis, i.e. homo. It agrees, however, more nearly with the Chald. \u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9 homines.\n57. **Ashat.** \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4} \\), a Wife.\u2014Agrees exactly with the Hebrew *ashat*, uxor, \u05d0\u05e9\u05d4.\n\n*Ashat-zu*, his wife \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4} \\) is rendered in P.C. *dam bi* \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4} \\), *Dam* signifying \u201cwife,\u201d and *bi* \u201chis.\u201d\u20142 R 8, line 28.\n\nIn 2 R 36, line 43, \u201ca wife\u201d is expressed by the usual words *khirat* \\( \\text{\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4} \\), and *khirta* \\( \\text{\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea} \\), and to these is added *ashata* \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4} \\).\n\nSome tablets contain divine lists, and when the name of a god is followed by that of a goddess, *dam bi* \u201chis wife\u201d is frequently added (2 R 56; 2 R 59, &c.). But sometimes the scribe uses the Assyrian form, *dam zu*; thus, Zarpanita is said to be \u201chis wife;\u201d but the name of the god (probably Marduk) is effaced.\u20142 R 59, line 50.\n\n58. **Shallut.** \\( \\text{shallot} \\), Women.\u2014In 2 R 65, line 42, \u201cmen and women\u201d are expressed by \\( \\text{shallot} \\). But in 2 R 38, line 28, and again line 40, by \\( \\text{shallot} \\).\n\n59. **Saklat.** Women, Wives.\u20142 R 38, line 42. Here \u201cmen and women\u201d are expressed by \\( \\text{saklati} \\). This word is evidently the Chald. *sagla*, \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d2\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05d0, conjux; uxor. \\( \\text{\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d2\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05d0} \\) \u201chis wives.\u201d\u2014Dan. v. 2.\n\n60. **Lubusta.** \\( \\text{\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05e9\u05ea} \\), Dress.\u2014Agrees entirely with the Heb. *levis*, but especially (see Gesen.) *vestis splendida*. In 2 R 38, 34, the king says: I gave (*addinu*) four* talents (*tikun*) for a dress for Marduk and Zarpanita. Then with a noble dress (*lubusta rabito*), a dress of gold (*lubusta khurassi*) Marduk and Zarpanita I adorned them (*lu-rabbi sunuti*). He then names a great number of precious stones, which cannot easily be identified, such as *ini Milukha* (eyes of Ethiopia), &c. &c. Altogether I think nine kinds are enumerated, and then he adds \\( \\text{\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05e9\u05ea} \\)\n\n---\n\n* The commencement of this passage is somewhat injured.\nu abni il sha mu-su nashku; \"and other stones whose names I have forgot.\" The last word is from Heb. \u05e0\u05b8\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd to forget. The termination in ku is like kaptaku, I am strong; and many other verbs (see Annals).\n\nAfter mentioning the precious stones, he says (line 47): I gave them (addinu) for the ashrat \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e4\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0. He then says: Lu-zahin (I adorned?) mukkhi lubusti (with woven dresses) iluti-sun rabiti (their great divinities). The verb zahin occurs frequently; always in the sense of adorning a temple: perhaps it is the Arabic \u0632\u064e\u0647\u0650\u0646\u064e, which Schindler, page 497, renders \"extulit laudibus.\" Mukkhi I would derive from \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 to weave (Buxtorf, 1186). The rest of the passage relates to the crowns the images wore, and is of somewhat doubtful construction (line 52). Agie garmi tsirati (crowns of lofty...); agie billuti (crowns of royalty); simat ilu (crowns of divinity); sha salimati malati (for complete dresses, or, to complete their dresses). Salimati is probably the Heb. \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\u05dd vestis (Ges. 964). Malati, Heb. \u05de\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9 to complete.\n\n61. Ashrat. \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e4\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0, Divine Images, plural of Heb. ashra \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e4\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0.\u2014Gesenius says (p. 112) Idolorum simulacra. The word occurs in the preceding article: \"I gave these splendid dresses to the ashrat (images) of Marduk and Zarpanita\".\n\n62. Ini. \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b4\u05d9, the Eyes. Singular inu \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b4\u05d9.\u2014But in tablet K, 214, it is written \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5, in the phrase enu namirtu, a far-seeing eye. In E.I.H. col. vii. 35, Nebuchadnezzar calls Babylon \"Ir nish ini-ya sha aramu; the city, the delight of my eyes, which I have made glorious.\" Here \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b4\u05d9 are eyes. But in same column, line 16, we are told that \"former kings built palaces in the cities which were the delight of their eyes; nish ini sun.\"\n\nIn this second passage ini \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b4\u05d9 \"eyes\" shows how the Assyrians pronounced the symbol \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b4\u05d9, which they borrowed from the ancient P.C. language, but altered it by adding\ntwo vertical strokes to signify the two eyes. So also they added two strokes to the P.C. signs meaning ears, hands, and feet.\n\n*Nish ini* in the above passage is, I believe, \"scopus oculorum;\" something on which the eyes are steadfastly fixed. It is the Heb. *scopos*: also a flag, to draw the eyes: vexillum; signum lat\u00e8 conspiciendum (Ges.). There is a curious Litany in 2 R 17, prayers for protection against all manner of evils, including the \"evil eye,\" *inu limutta*; see line 31. Here the P.C. Version renders *inu* by and \"evil\" by . *Ini* agrees exactly with the Heb. \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9 the eyes.\n\n63. **Elib.** , a Ship.\u2014The full form is Elibbu \u20142 R 2, No. 280, where it is explained by , which is the usual symbol for a ship. *Elibba* is evidently the Syriac word \u05e0\u05b8\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9 n\u0101vis.\n\nThere are several examples of the word in 2 R, plates 46 and 62.\n\n*Elippi Ili* , ships of the gods (which probably means the Arks of the gods), is rendered in P.C. , by which we see that was the plural of a god, in that language.\u2014See 2 R 46, 16.\n\nI would call attention to the elib or ark of one of these gods in particular (see line 2 of the same plate), viz. that of the god , whom I believe to be a Syrian god, concerning whom there is a very curious tablet inscription, showing how his ark, or perhaps his image, was found floating down the river Euphrates.\n\nBy siddi elippi , 2 R 62, 57, I understand \"the side of a ship\" (see article Sidi). In the same plate are mentioned the deck, and many other parts of a ship as yet uncertain. Also the various sizes of ships, varying from 60 gur down to 5 gur.\n64. Babylon.\u2014The well-known name of this city is introduced here in order to attempt to explain the construction of the name as it is given in the Cuneiform writing. It is admitted very generally that Bab-ilu signifies \"the gate of god, or of the gods;\" but it has been a great stumbling block to the Assyrian students to find the syllable Ra in the name, which is inconsistent with any reading of the word \"Babylon.\"\n\nNow we see from the preceding article (Elib) that the old Accadian or Proto-Chaldaean plural of a god, was gods; consequently \"the gate of the gods\" was written in that language, which the Semitic Babylonians pronounced Bab-ilu.\n\n65. Suanna. , the name of one of the principal parts of the City of Babylon.\u2014E.I.H. col. vii. 25.\n\nIn 2 R 50 there is a list of the towers (ziggurat) of Babylonia. Suanna is named first; Borsippa second. In the same plate there is a list of the duru (fortresses, fine buildings, royal residences, &c.). Suanna is again named first, and explained to be the same with Imgur Bel, a well-known fortress or fortified quarter of the city of Babylon. Next comes the often mentioned building Nibit Bel, which is explained to be the Shalkhu of Suanna: the word shalkhu often occurs in those inscriptions which treat of the king's great public works. In the third place comes the Dur, or palace, of the city of Borsippa. Now Babylon is not mentioned at all, which shows that it was identical with the preceding.\n\nIn Bell. line 14, Belibus is said to be the son of the (high priest?) of the temple of the seven planets in Suanna city.\n\n66. Immu. , Day.\u2014This is the Heb. dies. In 2 R 25, 25, it is explained by the more common word tamu, a day. The word occurs again in a very important passage concerning the Sacred Bulls, carved in stone, which stood at the gates of the palaces (Opp. Khors. 21,\nline 190): \"May the guardian bull, the protecting deity (ilu musallimu) watch over them by day and night!\" Immu u musha kireb-sun lishtapru, This is said of the palaces, which were thus supernaturally protected. Or it may be thus translated: \"May they keep guard within them day and night!\" Other copies of this passage, instead of \"day and night,\" have darish, \"for ever,\" or \"continually.\"\n\nLishtapru is the optative of the T conjugation of the verb \u05e9\u05d1\u05e8 to watch, ex.gr. Psalm cxlv. \"The eyes of all watch thee, and thou givest them their food.\" Nehem. ii. 13, \"And I was looking intently, at the walls of Jerusalem.\"\n\n67. Mushi. Night.\u2014This important word was discovered by Dr Hineks in a very curious little tablet K, 15, which some palace functionary, perhaps the chief astronomer, sent to the king to inform him of the exact day of the Equinox. It runs as follows:\u2014\"On the sixth day of the first month, the day and night are equally balanced: twelve hours of day, and twelve hours of night. May Nebo and Marduk be propitious to my lord the king!\" Thus written: tamu u mushi, the day and night, meshkulu, are balanced (Heb. \u05e7\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05dd).\n\n, 6 kasbu tamu.\n\n, 6 kasbu mushi.\n\nIn the Annals of Ashurakbal we read (see R 21, 48): \"Hence I departed, and I marched past the city of Nispi. I rode all night kal mushi artedi, and reached a fortress far beyond the city of Nispi, which the man called Zab-Yem had made his stronghold.\" In the next plate (R 22, 104) there is a very similar passage: \"I crossed the river Tigris\u2014I rode all night kal musit artedi, and I reached the fortress of Pitura.\" And R 21, 53, gives an account of the nocturnal surprise of the fortress of king Arastu. Musu adi namari\nartedi, I rode all night, until the dawn of day; naru Thurnat etibir, I crossed the river Thurnat; as bikhar sahati, with the early dawn, I reached the city Ammali, the stronghold of Arastu, &c. &c.\n\nHere we have night; the dawn; early morning. Heb. \u05d1\u05bc\u05e7\u05b6\u05e8 man\u0113, prima lux. Heb. \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4, diluculum, Aurora.\n\n68. Musish. adv. by Night.\u2014In the war between Sargina and Merodach Baladan, the latter monarch, struck with a sudden terror, fled by night from Babylon to the city of Ikbi-Bel, like a zudinnna bird. What bird that is we are left to conjecture. The words are \u201cKima zudinni ipparas musish.\u201d\n\nThe verb ipparas will be found in a former article, No. 12, \u201citsurish ipparas,\u201d he fled like a bird. It comes from expandit (sc. alas.). The plural ipparsu occurs on the Taylor Cylinder, col. i. 18, where the chiefs defeated in battle are compared to the same kind of birds: \u201cKima zudinni khu nigitsi,\u201d like frightened zudinni birds, ipparsu they flew away, ashar la hari to a place that was undisturbed.\n\nThe word nigitsi is, I think, a niphal form from the Arabic root \u05d9\u05b8\u05d2\u05b7\u05e2 to be much frightened, of which Schindler gives a good many examples, ex.gr. anima mea turbata est valde; Psalm vi. \u201cI heard thy voice walking in the garden and I was afraid,\u201d\n\n69. the Stars (pronunciation uncertain).\u2014In the old Hieratic character this is written . This fact was communicated to me by Mr. Norris. The nation who invented cuneiform writing appear to have worshipped the stars as their gods. Hence the symbol for \u201ca god,\u201d which is nothing else than the primitive image of a star simplified. In R24, 43, we read \u201cI captured such vast flocks of sheep that, like the stars of heaven, no one could count their number; sha kima minuta la isu; see R19, 88. On tablet 100, \u201cIshtar, queen of the stars,\u201d sarrat .\n70. **Arda.** (\u0710\u072a\u0715\u0710), a Servant.\u20142 R 10, col. ii. 15.\n\n71. **Ardut.** (\u0710\u072a\u0715\u0718\u072c\u0710), Homage, Prostration.\u2014This and the preceding word are probably derived from the Heb \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2 to fall down. *Epish arduti-ya* to do homage to me.\u2014R 45, 36. *Imisu ardut*, he refused to do homage.\u2014Opp. Khors. 8, 73. This is from the Chaldee verb \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2 rejecit, repulit, sprevit, contempsit.\u2014Schindler, 969.\n\n72. **Malku.** (\u0721\u0720\u071f\u0718), a King.\u2014Malku banu-sun, the king their builder.\u2014Opp. Khors. 21, 191. This word agrees entirely with the Heb \u05de\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0, Rex.\n\n73. **Malkat.** (\u0721\u0720\u071f\u072c\u0710), a Queen.\u2014This word occurs very seldom. On tablet 100, line 5, the goddess who was one of the greatest in the Assyrian Pantheon, has the titles *Khira Ashur* (wife of Ashur) and queen of all the gods, *malkat*. The last syllable *kat* is not unfrequent; it occurs in R 20, 6, where the other copy reads *ka at*. *Malkat* is the Chaldee \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea (Esther i.). In 2 R 66, 4, the goddess Beltis is called *Shurbat malikat* of the gods, spelt which corresponds to the title of Nebo in tablet 142, last line, *Shurbu malik ili rabi*, spelt . Also in R 17, 2, the god Ninev is called *malik ili*, king of the gods (spelt in the same way).\n\n74. **Nirarut.** (\u0722\u071d\u072a\ufe81\u072a\u0718\u071b), Assistance.\u2014A very common word. Ana niraruti-su allik; I went to his assistance.\u2014Opp. Khors. 8, 71.\n\n75. **Asti.** (\u0710\u0723\u071b\u071d), a Throne.\u2014R 18, 44. \u201cIn my first year I sat proudly on a royal throne;\u201d *as asti sarti*. The other copy reads *as guza sarti*, which is the usual word for \u201cthrone.\u201d Also in 2 R 46, 52, a tablet explains *asti* by the same word *guza*.

In Opp. Khors. 16, 143, \u201cCedars and cypress trees all cut down in the mountains of Hamana, whose woods are excellent;\u201d sha erit-zun dabu \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd. This word was first explained by Oppert. It is the Heb. \u05d9\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 sylva, which the Assyrians appear to have shortened into \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea. The formative T is added, as in irtsil, from \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b0\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc \u201cearth.\u201d The phrase is a common one, and is sometimes written sha erit-zun khiga, using the P.C. word khiga \u201cgood\u201d instead of the Assyrian dabu.\n\n84. **Ashlish.** \u05d0\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1, adv. like a Tree.\u2014From ashal, a tree.

In Opp. Khors. 14, 131, we read of the destruction of the king\u2019s enemies, ashlish unakkish, I cut them down like trees. This resembles the curse in Tiglath Pileser\u2019s inscription, R16,75, \u201cMay the gods itzish likilmu su! cut him down like a tree! (\u05d0\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1 arbor)\u201d \u05d0\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd.\n\n85. **Nabatsi.** \u05e0\u05b7\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d8\u05b0\u05e1\u05b4\u05d9, Logs of Wood, Broken Sticks, or anything broken with violence.\u2014This is the Heb. \u05e0\u05b7\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d8\u05b0\u05e1\u05b4\u05d9, to break and smite a thing. To dash in pieces (like a potter\u2019s vessel), Psalm ii. 9, &c.\n\nR12, 21: \u05de\u05b7\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 (mati or pagri), the dead bodies, kuradi-su of their soldiers, kima nabatsi like logs of wood, lu-ashrup I burnt.\n\nWe read in Opp. Khors. 14, 130, a somewhat different passage. \u05d0\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd the waters; nari-su, of his rivers; izrubu \u05d0\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05e8\u05bb\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05e8\u05bb\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc, were choked; pagri kuradi-su, with the bodies of his soldiers; nabatsish, as if they were logs of wood (floating on the water). Oppert has trunci arborum. Izrubu appears to be the Hebrew zereb \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 coarctavit, and also passive coarctatus fuit. In the book of Job this verb is also applied to rivers, which get choked and narrow during the summer season, \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e2\u05b5\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e2\u05b5\u05ea \u201cat what time;\u201d izrubu \u05d9\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05e8\u05bb\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc \u201cthey get narrow.\u201d\u2014Job. vi. 17. Hence it is probable that when Sargina uses the\nsame verb izrubu concerning rivers, it means that \"they grew choked or narrow.\" The Aunals of Ashurakbal, R 18, 53, and again R 20, 17, use the form napatsi. The passage is, their bodies, kina napatsi like logs or fragments, shadu (a great heap of them), lu-ashrup I burnt. The parenthesis occurs in other passages where the multitude of the enemy's slain is spoken of. Ex.gr. R 24, 41, rikhta-sun, their bodies, (a heap of them) I flung into the river Euphrates.\n\n86. Solomon. The name of the great King of Israel has not yet been found on the tablets. But the same name was borne by a king of Moab, who was contemporary with Tiglath Pilcser II, and paid tribute to him. This was about 750 B.C., and, consequently, two centuries after the death of the great Solomon. See the interesting list of tributary kings in 2R67. The name of Solomon occurs at line 60.\n\n87. Moab. \u20142R67, 60; see the preceding article. The Hebrew spelling is , in which name the appears to have sounded ha (Mohab). Since writing the above I have found that Oppert (Trait\u00e9 Babylonien, p. 5) has already pointed out that the name of Moab occurs R38, 53, in the inscription of Sennacherib; at which time Kammuzu-natbi was king of the country. And, as he judiciously remarks, the first portion of this name contains the name of Cam\u00fas, the god of the Moabites. He has not explained the second part; but I think the name certainly means \"Cam\u00fas spoke a prophecy,\" from the Hebrew verb to prophecy.\u2014Sch. 1115. Gesen. gives several examples from Amos, Ezekiel, &c. Such a name may mean that Cam\u00fas uttered a divine oracle at the time of this prince's birth; for we find similar names in Chald\u00e6a, such as Ikbi-Bel, \"Bel spoke;\" Nebo-titsu-ikbi, \"Nebo spoke good luck\" (gave a lucky oracle), &c.\n\nMoreover, Oppert has found the interesting name\nCam\u00fasu-sar-usur \"Cam\u00fasu protect the king!\" on a brick which he has published.\u2014(Trait\u00e9 Babylonien sur brique. Extrait de la Revue Arch\u00e9ologique; Paris, 1866.)\n\nI had, on my side, observed the name of this deity on another document (see the next article, Udumaia). I should observe that the name Moab is spelt exactly in the same way in the inscriptions of Sennacherib and Tiglath Pileser. The name of King Kammuzu-natbi proves, I think, that the Moabites spoke the Hebrew language. At least, it renders it probable. Has this argument been previously brought forward? In Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, art. Moab, I find the following: \"Of the language of the Moabites we know nothing, or next to nothing. In the few communications recorded as taking place between them and the Israelites, no interpreter is mentioned. And from the origin of the nation and other considerations we may, perhaps, conjecture that their language was more a dialect of Hebrew than a different tongue.\"\n\n88. Udumaia. the Idum\u00e6ans, or People of Edom.\u2014In 2 R 67, 61, the king of this nation pays tribute to Tiglath Pileser. His name is a remarkable one, Cav\u00fas-malaka. Does not this mean \"Cav\u00fas is king?\" Cav\u00fas being probably their great deity Camos (in the authorized version Chemosh). In Numbers xxi. 29, we read: \"Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh!\" where the Targum has \"People who worship Camos.\" LXX, \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2, Vulg. Chamos.\n\nModern researches into the Phoenician language have shown that malka often means \"a god\" in that language. Hence the name Cav\u00fas-malka may mean \"Cav\u00fas is the true god.\" Or perhaps it may be composed of two separate divine names, Cav\u00fas and Malka, the latter being identical with the Malkam (sometimes called Milcom) of the neighbouring Ammonites.\n89. **Abdumilik.** (A proper name.)\u2014Opp. Trait\u00e9 Bab. line 24. may mean \"servant of the king;\" but more probably \"servant of the god,\" according to the Phoenician use of . And since this man named his own son Abd-Hammon, it is likely that by he understood Hammon. This fact is not without importance, since it makes it probable that the Ammonites, whose great idol was Moloch (always with the article ), took their name from Hammon, the great deity of the Egyptians. I have not found the Hebrew \"servant\" in Assyrian, except in proper names. The Assyrian verb is .\n\n90. **Abdi milkutti.** the name of a King of Sidon.\u2014R 45, line 50, and also line 40 in the margin. \"servant of the queen.\" By the \"queen\" is meant the great goddess of the Sidonians. The name is differently given in the other copy, and I have given reasons elsewhere for the conjecture that this second name of the king was Abd-Ishtari, \"servant of Astarte.\" The Greek author Menander mentions a king of Tyre of that name. See p. 14 of my translation of the Inscription of Esarhaddon, in R.S.L., and the articles malku, malkat, in this Glossary, Nos. 72 and 73.\n\n91. **Subibulti.**, a Necklace.\u2014Subibulti sha tzuri-sha, the necklace of her neck (tablet 162).* Derived from the Hebrew subab , to encircle. For example, in Gen. ii. 13, the river Gihon is said \"to compass the whole land of Ethiopia,\" while in line 11 the river Pison \"compasseth (\u05e1\u05d1\u05d1) the whole land of Havilah.\" Gesenius renders \u05e1\u05d1\u05d1 by circumedit: cinxit. The same sentence of the tablet contains the next word, tzuri.\n\n* When I made my translation of this curious tablet in the Transaction of the R.S.L., I was not acquainted with this word.\n92. **Tzuri.** \\( \\text{tzur} \\), the Neck.\u2014This is the Hebrew \\( \\text{tzur} \\), collum; also written \\( \\text{tzor} \\). I will add another example from the Michaux inscription (R, plate 70): \"May the gods impose grievous burdens upon his neck!\" \\( \\text{tzuri-su} \\). Here the second letter is rendered \\( \\text{uv} \\) by Rawlinson (No. 70) and by Oppert (No. 57). It is often, however, a simple \\( u \\). Another example is found in 2 R 18, col. ii. 45. As \\( \\text{tzuri-su} \\), around his neck, let him hang holy images; (last part doubtful) written \\( \\text{tzuri-su} \\). We also find 2 R 51, 6, \\( \\text{ana tzuri-su} \\), upon his neck (spelt the same).\n\n93. **Gadu.** \\( \\text{gadu} \\), Good Fortune.\u2014Although this word is at present doubtful, yet it is worth while to propose it as an explanation of the passage R 64, col. x. 4, where the king says: \"In thy name, O supreme Marduk, I have built this temple; may its Good Fortune never grow old! Bit ebusu; gadu val lulibur!\" The last word is in other passages written \\( \\text{lilbur} \\); it is the optative of the verb \\( \\text{labar} \\), to grow old. Gesenius says: \"Gad, fortuna: Fortun\u00e6 numen \u00e0 Babyloniis cultum; i.e., Jovis sidus in toto Oriente pro fortun\u00e6 auctore habitum.\u2014Isaiah lxv. 11.\" Which verse of Isaiah is to this effect: \"Ye have forsaken the true religion of Jehovah, and have prepared a table for Gad (\\( \\text{gad} \\)) and a drink offering for Minni (\\( \\text{minni} \\)).\" There is also another well-known passage in Gen. xxx. 11: \\( \\text{\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d2\u05b8\u05d3} \\) or \\( \\text{\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05df} \\). The LXX follow the first reading, and render it \\( \\text{\u03b5\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7} \\). Gesenius says \"ben\u00e8 LXX \\( \\text{T\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7} \\).\"\n\n94. **Lala.** \\( \\text{lala} \\), or sometimes \\( \\text{lalas} \\), Splendour, or perhaps Good Fortune.\u2014In Neriglissar's inscription, R 67, col. ii. 33: \"In thy name, O Marduk! I have built this temple; may its splendour endure! Bit ebusu: lala-su lusbu!\" Perhaps from the Hebrew \\( \\text{lalas} \\) splenduit. But considering the similar passage quoted in the last number from Nebuchadnezzar's great inscription, R 64, col. x. \"Gadu val lulibur!\"\nlala-sha lusbim,\" these two phrases, put in apposition, would rather incline me to translate lala as \"good fortune,\" and as connected with \u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, the morning star (\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d7\u05b9\u05e8, son of the dawn, Isaiah xiv. 12), which was emblematic of good fortune, and is itself to be derived from \u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd splenduit.\u2014Ges.\n\n95. Mut. \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd, a Man, a Husband.\u2014This word was first detected by Dr. Hincks (Grammar, p. 519). The whole of his remarks in this part of his grammar are important. It is a pity that he did not give a complete translation of all that remains of this \"fragment of the ancient laws of Assyria,\" as he terms it. I will attempt, however, to explain a portion of it. See 2 R 10, the first twelve lines of col. ii.:\u2014\n\n| Takma. | A Penalty. |\n|--------|------------|\n| Ashata mut-zu iziru | If a woman shall repudiate her husband |\n| \"Val mut-i atta\" iktabi, | And shall say to him, \"Thou art not my husband,\" |\n| Ana naru inaddu-su. | He shall drown her in the river. |\n\n| Takma. | A Penalty. |\n|--------|------------|\n| Mut ana ashati-su | If a husband to his wife |\n| \"Val ashat-i atta\" iktabi, | Shall say, \"Thou art not my wife,\" |\n| mana kaspa ishaggal. | He shall pay half a mina of silver. |\n\nSome of these words require explanation. Iziru, repudiavit, is here written \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd. I am fortunately able to give another example of this word, from Oppert Khors. 10, 95. \"I deposed Hazor, King of Ashdod, who refused to pay tribute, and I raised his younger brother, Akhimiti, to the\nthrone. But the Syrian people rose in insurrection and repudiated his dominion.\u201d The verb in this passage is iziru \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfa3\ud800\udfa7. Oppert translates it repudiavit. This agreement is very satisfactory. Iktabi is the T conjugation of ikbi dixit; locutus est. Ishaggal from Heb. \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05b7\u05bc\u05d7 to pay money.\n\nThe spelling is \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfa3\ud800\udfa7 muti, my husband. \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfa3\ud800\udfa7 mutzu, her husband. The former of these is of special importance, since the pronoun is contained, or hidden, in the last syllable, and does not, as usual, form a separate syllable \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa2 (the vowel i). Concerning this, Dr. Hincks says (p. 518), \u201cthe affix of the first person attached to a theme which ends in a consonant is generally i. This affix is not represented by a separate character but by a change of the last character of the theme, which with this affix is the same as the second or third case. Examples are very numerous, but they appear to have been overlooked or set down as mistakes by others.\u201d\n\nI will now give another example of the word Mut, from 2R10, col. iv. 4. Ana matina mut libbi-su ikhutzu; if any man shall think in his heart. . . .\n\nConcerning ana in the sense of \u201cif,\u201d see that article.\n\nMut agrees well with the Heb. \u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4, which Gesenius explains Vir, peculiariter Maritus. Example: Deut. ii. 34, \u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9\u05dd, viri et mulieres. I think that this word originally meant a mortal, as in Greek and Latin we have \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 a mortal; \u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 an immortal. And Callimachus says, \u1f10\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u201cwe mortals built cities.\u201d In fact, as Buttmann has shown, \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 became \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 because \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 would have been unpronounceable to a Greek.\n\nNow \u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 signifies mortalis in Arabic (Sch. p. 987), but in Hebrew \u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 and \u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 signify mors, mortuus. Something similar is seen in the connection between the old Persian martiya, homo, afterwards mard, and the Latin maritus = vir.\nShould the above remarks be correct they afford an explanation of a very obscure passage in the inscriptions, which is repeated several times, in which one of the principal gods is described as \"living in heaven like a mortal,\" which can only mean, I think, possessing the human shape; as the Greeks figured to themselves the Homeric gods the inhabitants of Olympus. I will annex some of these passages.\n\nIn R35, No. 2, line 2, Nebo is described as Bal annu kima mut. In 2R67, 67, some god is described as \"chief of one hundred gods\" (a common title), and also annu kima mut; spelt exactly the same as before, except the first sign instead of bal, which I cannot explain.\n\nIn R17, 2, the god Ninev is described as bulat annu kima mut. Bulat means \"living:\" see Nos. 31 to 36 for other similar words compounded of Bul.\n\nI will now give a rather doubtful example of the word Mut, from Opp. Khors. 14, 131. The king having taken the city of Dur Yakina and put many people to death, says, \"imat muti aslukha.\" If imat is an erroneous reading for mat (land), the sense may be \"I despoiled or stripped the land of all its inhabitants.\" Aslukha is Ch. spoliavit, denudavit, ex. gr. Targum on Gen. xxxvii., \"they stripped Joseph of his tunic,\" islukhu.\n\n96. Takma, a Sentence or Penalty.\u2014This word occurs four times in 2R, pl. 10, and has evidently been broken off in three other places. It seems to be always followed by the mention of some punishment inflicted. I therefore think it is derived from the root hakim, in the sense given by Schindler, p. 571, judicavit: dixit sententiam: condemnavit: multavit. And as a substantive, judicium: condemnatio: sententia.\n\nThe social offences for which these penalties are inflicted\nappear to be the following; but it is probable that many others followed, and of a more varied nature:\n\n1. If a wife should repudiate her husband (line 4 on the left).\n2. Or a husband his wife (line 10 on the left).\n3. Or a son his father (line 23 on the right).\n4. Or a son his mother (line 29 on the right).\n5. Or a father his son (line 34 on the right).\n6. Or a mother her son (line 41 on the right).\n\nThe latter ones are much mutilated; but their meaning may be inferred from the analogy of the rest. The following one is, however, different:\n\n7. If a master shall maltreat his hired servant (line 13 on the left).\n\n97. Baru. \u0712\u072a\u0718, a Son.\u2014I propose this word with some hesitation, because I have only met with it once; but that is in so clear a passage that I think I can hardly be mistaken. Besides, the word Bar, a son, is so very common a word in Syriac that it may reasonably be looked for in the Assyrian language, as likely to occur under certain circumstances. Now it will be seen by reference to the preceding article Takma, that Sec. 3 inflicts a penalty, \u201cIf a son \u0712\u072a\u0718 shall say to his father \u0710\u072c\u072c\u0710 (atta) \u0712\u072a\u0718 \u0710\u072c\u072c\u0710 \u0722\u0718 (min?) thou art not my father.\u201d This is the P. C. version, and I have corrected the last sign to make it agree with the other texts. The Assyrian version is slightly fractured, but can be easily restored as follows: Takma (penalty). Baru ana abu-su, \u201cVal ab-i atta,\u201d iktabi; \u201cIf a son shall say to his father, \u2018Thou art not my father.\u2019\u201d . . . . (The next lines are fractured and illegible). 2 R 10, col. iv. 23.\n\nIn this passage the important word is \u0712\u072a\u0718 Baru, which admits of no other meaning than \u201cSon.\u201d In line 36 we find the corresponding penalty (though in a fractured\nstate), \"If a father (atta) shall say to his son 'thou art not my son,' &c. &c.\n\n98. Elmi, or Ilmi. an Eclipse.\u2014This interesting word is probably derived from the Chald. elma, occultatus fuit: absconditus fuit (Schindler, p. 1328). The character frequently has the value El or Il, as in Babel. Arba-ol (the city of Arbela), R45, 6. Hazael King of Syria, R46, 19. I have found some unpublished tablets in the British Museum which throw some light upon this word. The first of these which I will mention is marked as 88, and also as 67A. It bears an inscription of only two lines, very clearly written: Sin elmi itsakan, \"The moon is eclipsed.\" I conjecture that this was a notice sent by the chief astronomer to be delivered to the king immediately, while there was yet time for his majesty to witness the phenomenon himself. King Ashurbanipal seems to have felt interest and curiosity in all matters of science and literature; witness the tablet which Dr. Hiucks discovered, and which I have referred to under the article Mush\u00ee, in which the astronomer informs the king, with courteous compliments, on what day of the month the vernal equinox will fall. (These two tablets are, I think, from the same hand.)\n\nThe next evidence which I will produce is the inscription published by Rawlinson, 2R52, 7, which he describes as \"date of solar eclipse.\"\n\nIn the third month of the year, \"the sun was eclipsed.\" Shemesh elmi ishkan. The sign represents the syllable ashk or ishk (but I believe only in this verb). Examples of this usage are very numerous.\n\nMy third example shall be from the unpublished British Museum tablet 154, also marked 122b (it formerly bore the mark K 131):\n\n\"To the King of the World, my lord! Thy servant\nKukuru (sends this). May Ashur, the Sun, and Marduk be propitious to my lord the king (in his journey) from his kingdom unto the land of Egypt! I inform his majesty that in the month of Su there was an eclipse.\" elmi ishkunnu. (It will be observed that the same verb is employed in all the three inscriptions. It therefore requires examination. My opinion is that it expresses the Chald. agrotavit valde, vel periculose. Periclitatus est).\n\nI now proceed to the remaining part of this last tablet. The writing becomes indistinct; but after the words \"there was an eclipse,\" follows \"Five portions of the full orb\".... (perhaps \"lost their light\"). (five parts were obscured) ana malathu-sha, \"upon its fulness,\" i.e. \"upon the full orb,\" from Heb. , to be full. I cannot make out the two next lines, but then comes \"Sar lishalumi: sha elmi sha arakhi Su kishar ana pani Sar....\" \"Let the king be at peace (i.e. of tranquil mind) since the eclipse of the month of Su portends good fortune to the king!\" where I read kishar, and compare the Heb. words in Gesenius, p. 508, ben\u00e8 cessit: prosperavit, prosperitas, Psalm lxviii. 7. Syriac successus prosper. A more complete study of this curious tablet is desirable. It is in one sense, however, very defective, since it does not state the day of the month. Nor does it say whether the eclipse was solar or lunar. There is a slight probability, however, that it was solar, because the writer invokes the sun to be propitious to his sovereign.\n\nThe month Su was, according to my reckoning, the fourth month of the year. I now come to the three lunar eclipses, which were first noticed by Dr. Hincks in 2R39, col. iv. 43, 52, 58, and upon which he wrote a short memoir, printed in the Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Berlin. I do not think that much can be deduced from them. In each case the eclipse is expressed by . There is no\nindication of the year in which the events happened, and there is no reason to suppose that it was during the reign of Ashurbanipal. The account is evidently copied from a more ancient record, as we see by the occurrence of the sign meaning \"it is illegible,\" which the scribe often used when he found the ancient tablets injured or effaced. Moreover the notice of the eclipses is interspersed with irrelevant matter, apparently copied from other tablets, and inserted here without any fixed intention. Certain unusual verbs occur, and if their meaning could be established it would give some help. Among these I notice Shakanu, in line 56, which we have seen to be often employed in accounts of eclipses, and probably to mean \\( \\text{aegetavit} \\); in periculo fuit, &c. &c. \"In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds.\"\u2014Milton. And so the Latins say, Deliquium solis, &c. Cicero has, lune defectibus, \"during eclipses.\" Virgil says, Defectus solis varios, lunaeque labores.\n\nIf this is the meaning, it seems likely that the other verbs in line 56 are synonyms of it. These are ikhmu, and shurru or shurrulu, to which in line 54 is added hamathu; and there were, it seems, two more in line 54, which the original scribe found illegible. I would, therefore, suggest that ikhmu may be the Chald. occultavit, abscondit: see Sch. 595, where we see that and were used as synonyms. This verb, he says, is also written in Chaldee, and is related to the root niger. The verb shurrulu may be related to Heb. obscurus vel niger fuit. As to the verb hamathu, it seems only a cognate form of Should these synonymous verbs have this meaning, line 53 may possibly be translated \"Eclipse of the moon. At sunrise it was hidden in that eclipse\" (as ellim suata). The expression \"sunrise\" is used very vaguely in these tablets. It only means that the morning light was visible, and does not indicate the time more precisely. The sense may be, \"After\ndaybreak, or shortly before sunrise, the moon was quite darkened by that eclipse.\" But I understand that this passage is inaccurately printed in the lithograph; so that it must remain doubtful for the present. In the large tablet, 229b, otherwise K 270, the word \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) occurs so often that it cannot mean \"an eclipse,\" but some other kind of darkness.\n\n99. Zunah. \\( \\text{\u2600} \\), Cold.\u2014This is the Heb. \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) frigus. We read in Prov. xxv. 13, \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) \"as the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so . . . refresheth the soul.\"\n\nThis word is found but rarely in the inscriptions. An example occurs in the Taylor inscription of Sennacherib, col. iii. 76 and following lines. The king is at war with the Tocharri, and marching through rugged mountain paths. He says: \"In places that were dangerous for my palanquin (ashar ana guza rusuku), I alighted on my feet, and then like a mountain goat I clambered up the lofty cliffs. Where my knees inclined to rest, I sat down upon some mountain rock; and waters, cold even unto freezing, I drank to quench my thirst.\" This graphic description stands thus in the original (line 78): \"Ashar birka-ya manakhtu ishaha, tsir abni shadi usibu. Mie, zun adi kassuti, ana zumi-ya lu-ashti.\" A few observations on these words may be requisite:\n\nAshar, locus: but here it is an adverb (quo loco=ubi); birkaya my knees; ishaha declined or sunk down; manakhtu for repose. The verb ishaha is \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) \"se inclinavit.\" Manakhtu is \"repose,\" from Heb. \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) ques, which is from the root \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) requiescere. Tsir \"upon,\" is a frequent preposition. Mie \"waters,\" \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) in the original. Zun adi kassut: \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) \"Cold, even unto freezing.\" The last word comes from the Chald. \\( \\text{\u2600} \\) durus fuit: rigidus fuit. Schindler gives a great number of examples of this word. The first part of this explanation I have taken from a paper of Dr. Hiucks in the Atlantis, which he kindly communicated to me. The king says\nhe shared all the hardships of the common soldier. Cold water was his beverage, a rock his seat. He fared like an Alpine traveller in the present day, when thirsty and tired with climbing. Buxtorf, p. 1927, gives good examples of the word Zuannu.\n\n100. **Shalgu.** \u261e \u261e, Snow.\u2014R40, 77, and R43, 43. Heb. \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc nix. This word was pointed out by Mr. Norris.\n\n101. **Parna.** \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e, a Median word, apparently signifying a Chief.\u2014The Behistun inscription speaks of a Median general whose name was Vinta-parna (or Intaphernes). The Persian text has Vidafrana (Norris, R.A.S. Vol. xv. p. 192). Now the inscription of Esarhaddon, col. iv. 13, names two chiefs \u201cof the distant Medians,\u201d Sirep-parna and E-parna. This coincidence renders it probable that the so-called Scythian text at Behistun is really written in the Median language. The names Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes probably contain the same word; to which we may add Artaphernes, son of Hystaspes, and another of the same name, who fought at Marathon.\n\n102. **Ephar.** \u261e \u261e \u261e, Dust.\u2014Heb. \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7 pulvis. In 2R67, 27, the king conquers the tribes inhabiting the coasts of the Persian Gulf, who, he says, had never submitted to any of his predecessors. They now submit, and offer tribute of precious articles, the produce of their own land \u261e \u261e. First and most precious was the gold dust of their country, \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e. Such I believe to be a probable rendering of this passage.* Then they make an offering of their Pearls, for which the Persian Gulf has always been famous. These are called nisikti stones; and that pearls are meant is evident from the epithet added of binut parti, \u201cproductions of the sea\u201d \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e.\n\n* Is it certain that when gold of Ophir is mentioned in the Bible, Ophir is always the name of a country? May it not sometimes at least have meant gold dust \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7? Job xxviii. 6, says \u201cthe Earth has \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7 of gold\u201d (dust of gold).\n103. **Ashmar.** \u1e24\u0101m\u0101r, a Spear.\u2014In R, plate 7, the king slays a lion. \u201cWith my ashmar in my hand I deprived him of life (ashkul zukhar-su).\u201d The verb *ashkul* is doubtful; if correct it may be the Heb. \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05dc\u05b5\u05da\u05b0 privavit. The word *Ashmar* occurs again in the Nakshi Rustam inscription, line 28: \u201cThen learn! that the spear of the Persian soldier reaches far!\u201d Sha amilu Parsaya ashmar-su ruku illik!\n\n104. **Ru.** \u1e62\u016br, a Sword.\u2014R7, inscription C. Here the king says: \u201cI killed another lion \u1e25\u0101m\u0101r with a sword of iron \u1e63\u016br mibi-ya, in my hand? Compare this with the account of the death of Ursa, King of Urarda, Opp. Khors. 9, 77: \u201cWhen Ursa heard that his city was captured, and that the image of Mazdia his god was carried off, \u201cwith a sword of iron in his hand he destroyed his own life\u201d (napishta-su usuti). The words and the spelling here employed are exactly the same as those I have quoted from R, plate 7.\n\nIn R18, 49, we read: \u201cThe mountain rose up like a sharp-pointed upright sword of iron; even a bird of heaven could not have flown so high.\u201d In this passage, *zikip* Heb. \u05e6\u05b4\u05e7\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 is a sharp-pointed stake fixed upright in the ground. The next word is \u1e62\u016br \u201ca sword of iron,\u201d which completes the similitude. A modern traveller gives a not very different account of perhaps the same range of mountains. Compare this with the much earlier inscription of Tiglath Pileser (R11, 43): \u201cGreat mountains (shakuti) which rose straight up like pointed swords\u201d sha kima zikip ru uthu \u1e62\u016br \u1e62\u016br \u1e62\u016br \u1e62\u016br \u1e62\u016br. Here the letter *kip* is the same as before, but with a different disposition of the wedges, \u1e62\u016br instead of \u1e62\u016br. The verb *uthu* is interesting: it appears to come from a root \u05e2\u05b8\u05ea\u05b7\u05e2, whence Heb. \u05e2\u05b8\u05ea\u05b7\u05e2 Stylus, and \u05e2\u05b8\u05ea\u05b7\u05e2 acuminatus,\nEzek. xxi. 15, where it is an epithet of a sword. Nearly the same passage is repeated in R12, 14.\n\n105. Mitgar. \\( \\text{mitgar} \\), Good Luck.\u2014Tamu mitgar\u012b, on a lucky day. Opp. Khors. 19, 167, and very frequently in other inscriptions. I deduce this word from the Chald. and Syr. verb tagar \\( \\text{tagar} \\) lucrificet: lucratus est negociando, &c. Sch. 1962. N.B. The word \"luck\" is probably related to lucrum.\n\n106. Laban. \\( \\text{laban} \\), a Plain, a Flat or Level District.\u2014R11, 45. The king says, \"I advanced through an arduous country. Lofty mountains rose up before me, through which no chariots could pass. So I left my chariots in the plain, and then marched up the mountains.\" In labani lu-emid, I left them in the plain, \\( \\text{emid} \\) is the Heb. \\( \\text{stetit} \\) the Hiphil of \\( \\text{stetit} \\), and signifies stare fecit or statuit (see Gesen.). This word laban \"flat\" seems very important, as showing us the true etymology of the Hebrew laban \\( \\text{laban} \\) a tile or brick. It has hitherto been most unsatisfactorily derived by Gesenius and others from \\( \\text{laban} \\) \"white,\" as if bricks and tiles were always white! It may be said they are sometimes \"light coloured;\" but it may be replied that a thing could not reasonably have received its name from laban unless it were conspicuously white, and that were one of its principal qualities. The Moon is well named Labnah \\( \\text{labnah} \\) \"the white,\" and the epithet is often applied by Hebrew writers to \"milk\" and \"snow,\" and they use the comparison \"whiter than snow.\" But since, as I think, no writer ever said \"whiter than a brick,\" I think we must reject that etymology of \\( \\text{laban} \\).\n\nI am of opinion then that \\( \\text{laban} \\) \"a brick or tile,\" was so called from its flatness.\n\nBabylonian bricks are described and figured in Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, Vol. iii. page 393: \"The finest quality of brick was yellow. Another very hard kind was blue,\napproaching to black; the commoner and coarser sorts were pink or red. The shape was always square, and the dimensions varied between twelve and fourteen inches for the length and breadth, and between three and four for the thickness.\" Hence we see that their thickness was only about a quarter of their length and breadth. They were broad and flat, like the stone flags of a modern pavement. Such a form the French would call une plaque, which is the same word as the English flag (=paving stone) and the German flach (flat), whence Oberflache, a surface (viz. extension with little thickness).\n\nThese are only two or three of a whole host of words which in Greek, Latin, and modern languages express more or less the mixed idea of broadness and flatness, such as latus, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2, flat, platform; Germ. platt, &c.\n\nI now proceed to inquire further whether we cannot, by analogy from this word \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7, arrive at the true etymology of the Latin luter, \"a tile?\"\n\nIt appears to me to come from latus and \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2, being intermediate between them. Latus and \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2 are the same word; a similar change is seen in planus, Spanish llano, old provincial Latin lanus (whence the city Mediolanum, \"Middle of the plain,\" now Milano). Also pluvia, Span. lllover, and many other words.\n\n107. Shabu. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, the Foot, plur. Shapi.\u2014This meaning is quite clear from the passage in 2R17, col. iv. 69, which says: \"their heads unto his head: their hand unto his hand: their feet unto his foot.\" Here the P.C. \ud808\udc97 is rendered by the Assyrian \ud808\udc97 kati. Both are well known to signify the hands. And the P.C. (the feet) is rendered by the Assyrian \ud808\udc97 shapi, which, therefore, must signify \"feet.\"\n\nThis is fully confirmed by a phrase which frequently occurs: iknusu shabu-a \"they fell down at my feet;\" \"they did homage to me, by prostration at my feet:\" written\nR38, 44. *Ushaknis shabu-a* \"I caused them to fall down at my feet.\" As to the origin and affinities of the word *shabu*, it seems evidently to come from the Chald. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8 calcavit, also written \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8.\n\n108. **Hakkada.** \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9, the Head.\u2014This is a word of considerable obscurity; but I think that it is too important to be omitted, for several reasons, and therefore I propose it for consideration. In 2R19, col. ii. 14, some mythological creature, probably a serpent, is spoken of as having seven heads, *si'ba hakkada*. In the P. C. translation the numeral is expressed by \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9, and *hakkada* is translated \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 Shak, which signifies \"head\" in that language.\n\nThe same sign is employed for \"head\" in the Assyrian, and consequently assumes the phonetic power of *resh* or *rish*, Heb. \u05e8\u05b6\u05e9\u05c1. The creature spoken of is called \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 tsir makkhi in both languages, except that the P. C. omits the final \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9. The last word signifies \"great,\" \"finely grown,\" or \"powerful,\" in Assyrian, where it is frequently employed as an epithet of bulls and timber trees, *ga makkhi*, *shar makkhi*, and *ur makkhi* \"lions\" (for I suppose a lion was simply *ur*, as in Hebrew \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc leo). Omitting the epithet *makkhi*, the name of the mythological creature will be \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 (probably Tsir); but I am not aware what it is. Returning now to the consideration of the word *hakkad*, I find a strong confirmation in 2R17, col. iv. 66, where the P. C. column has \"their heads\" \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 reshdu or sakdu, and the Assyrian column has \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 (the last sign being broken off). Again, in 2R17, col. ii. 24, we find *hakkadi* \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 answering to the P. C. \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 shak or \"head.\" Another very clear example of this word is found in 2R46, 45, where reshdu (head) is explained hakkadu \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9. Now with respect to the origin of this word *hakkad*, it seems that the Hebrew anciently possessed the word \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 kad \"the head,\" but at present we only find the\n\nVOL. III.\u2014[NEW SERIES].\nderived form kad-kad \"top of the head\" vertex capitis. Gesenius gives the following texts: Job ii. 7; Ps. vii. 17; Gen. xlix. 26; Deut. xxxiii. 16; Ps. lxviii. 22. But the verb to bow the head, occurs frequently, and is reduced to in the tenses; he bowed his head: ex. gr. 1 Sam. xxiv. David bowed down with his face to the earth.\n\nI now find that Oppert also (Commentary, page 188, &c.) gives kakkadi as the Assyrian for \"heads,\" expressing by kak, with a point under each k. The sound is likely to have been hak.\n\nWe have not proved Tsir (which means \"long\") to have in this passage the meaning of \"serpent;\" but should we eventually be able to prove that point, we should see that the Assyrian mythology contained \"a serpent with seven heads.\" It is very remarkable that a seven-headed serpent is the ruling symbol of the great ruined temple lately discovered in Cambodia, whose folds extend over the roofs and pillars, and prove him to have been the Genius Loci; but in what age was that temple erected?\n\n109. Haggar. , the Earth.\u2014I have placed this article next to the last on account of their both beginning with the unusual syllable ak or hak. Oppert agrees with me in giving this value to it in some words. It is No. 49 of his list. Nakshi Rustam, line 5: \"I am Darius, sar haggar rukta rabita, king of the vast and wide world.\"\n\nBell. 61: \"My aqueduct extended kasbu hakkari over a league of land.\" Mishakti hakkari \u20142 R 67, 69. The word is very common.\n\n110. Ishazzu. , Men call it (or call them).\u2014On l'appelle: on les appelle. \"Are called.\" An impersonal verb of great importance, very commonly used as a parenthesis. \"I built before the gates Bit Appati like those of a Syrian palace, and which, in the language of Ph\u0153nicia, they call Bit Khilanni: Sha in lishan Martu-ki Bit Khilanni\nishazzu-su.\" Opp. Khors. 19, 162. I was the first who gave a translation of this remarkable passage (Journal of Sacred Literature for 1856, Vol. iii. page 190).\n\n111. Diklat. This word means, in the first place, the river Tigris (see No. 41). But it also appears to mean a kind of boat peculiar to that river, and so named after it. We read in the Behistun inscription, line 34, that on the advance of Darius the enemy crossed the Tigris: \"as eli diklat usuzzu anakullua nari Mastiggar mali,\" i.e. \"they fled on diklat (as people call them) to the other side of the river Tigris. \"Upon which,\" says Darius, \"we crossed (nitibir) the river Tigris, and defeated the enemy in a great battle, fought on the 26th day of the month Kan.\" This passage requires a few observations. Mali is the Heb. verb \u05e0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 elapsus est: ausfugit.\u2014Ges. 577. The parenthesis usuzzu \"they call them,\" or \"men call them,\" Lat. (ut vocant) is very frequent. It only occurs when a foreign, or at least unusual, word is employed. I have treated of it in the last article (110). It is here written \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9 \u05e2\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d5\u05b8\u05d0. Anakullua is contracted from ana aku ullua \"to\u2014bank\u2014opposite.\" The two latter words are not unfrequent, and \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 is very frequently na, though often confounded with ma, which has nearly the same form, and the scribes were not very careful to distinguish them. With the phrase ana aku ullu compare that used in R40, 31 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \"to the other side\" (of the sea, I carried them). Compare also the seventeenth line of the Nakshi Rustam inscription. The Cimmerians who dwelt on the other side of the sea, \"sha akhi ullua sha marrata,\" written \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0, pronounced probably akhullua. Rawlinson also translates this phrase by \"ultr\u00e0 mare.\"\n\n112. Nu. Not.\u2014A Proto-Chaldaean word, exceedingly common in that language, but very rare in the Assyrian.\u2014The\nfollowing are, however, a few instances of it: Sargina\u2019s Palace had the name \u201cGabri nu isha,\u201d \u201chas not a rival;\u201d equivalent to the modern name Sanspareil or Nonpareil. Opp. Khors. 18, 159. In the invocation to Ninev, R17, 1, it is said, \u201cSha as takhazi nu ishananu tibu-su,\u201d \u201cwhom in battle none could resist his onset.\u201d Here the other copy changes nu into the usual Assyrian negative la \u201cnot.\u201d In the Michaux inscription, R70, col. iii. 13, we read \u201cMarduk bel rabu, aga nu bila,\u201d which may mean king without end, or, king everlasting. Agu is \u201ca crown\u201d (plur. agie); hence aga may be \u201ca king.\u201d\n\n113. Nin. No One.\u2014Annals of Esarhaddon, R47, 34. \u201cA great building . . . which among the kings my fathers who went before me none had ever made, I accomplished;\u201d sha as sarrin alikut makhri abi-ya nin la ebusu, anaku ebus. And in the tablet given by Oppert (Exp. cn Mes. page 360), \u201csha as sarrin alik makhri-ya nin miru suatu ikhutzu,\u201d \u201cwhich among the kings who went before me, none showed solicitude for this useful work\u201d (See my translation in the Transactions of the R.S.L.). This word nin, nullus, and the preceding word nu, non (see No. 112), appear to have been borrowed from some Indo-Germanic language.\n\n114. Tansil. Resembling.\u2014This word occurs R36, 54. Bit Khilanni tansil haikal Khatti; \u201cI constructed bit-khilanni resembling those of a Syrian palace.\u201d Other texts repeat this passage with some variations, having instcad of tansil. Opp. Khors. 19, 161, reads tam-sil, which is probably correct, for I think sometimes sounded tam (for instance, when it meant \u201ca day\u201d). Tamsil is evidently the Arabic tamsil \u201ca resemblance.\u201d It is a verbal substantive from the root to resemble, which is of common occurrence in Heb. and Chald. as well as the substantive similitudo.\nIshbi. \u1f38\u03c3\u03b2\u03af, Herbs.\u2014There is an interesting passage in the inscriptions of Khorsabad, where Sargina receives tribute from Ithamar, King of the Sabaeans. The first article presented to him is gold. The second, Ishbi kutra. Oppert translates ishbi, in my opinion correctly, by \"herbs,\" regarding it as the Heb. \u05e2\u05e9\u05d1 herba. Chald. \u05e2\u05e9\u05d1 (Khors. 3, 27, and Commentary, page 78). But of the next word \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 he only says \"groupe difficile \u00e0 d\u00e9chiffrer.\" My conjecture is, that we should read \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 kutra, frankincense; for I find that frequent mistakes have been made between \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9, otherwise \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9, which is kut, and the much commoner letter \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 kur. Kutra may be compared with the Heb. \u05e7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05dd incense offered to the gods. Gesenius and Schindler translate the verb by suffivit: adolevit: and the substantive by suffimentum: thymiama. The same verb in Arabic means \"to be fragrant.\"\u2014Ges.\n\nThis offering of \"gold and frankincense\" reminds us of that which the Magi offered at Bethlehem, \"gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.\"\u2014Matthew ii. 11. The tribute of the King of the Sabaeans, which he brought to the King of Assyria, is most appropriate and consonant to the testimony of history\u2014India mittit ebur: molles sua thura Sab\u00e6i (Virgil).\n\nSo, three centuries earlier, the Queen of the Sabaeans, commonly called the Queen of Sheba, brought a great tribute to Solomon. 1 Kings x. 1; \"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones.\" And again: \"She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.\"\n\nNearly related to this word is the Assyrian kutar, the smoke of something burning, which is the Heb. \u05e7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05dd.\n\nIf, however, the present reading of the text \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 kurra should eventually prove to be correct, I still think that it may be the same word as kutra \u05e7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05dd. For we see that the letter T is absorbed and disappears before R in innumerable instances, as pater, p\u00e8re: mater, m\u00e8re: frater, fr\u00e8re, &c. &c.\n116. **Sarrut.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40, the Foundations of a Building.\u2014Probably of same origin with No. 7 of this Glossary, *sarrut* \"commencement.\" All from the Chald. \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 to begin. In R69, 20, Nabonidus dedicates several temples with the prayer \"May their foundations \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udd40 \ud808\udd40 last as long as Heaven itself!\" \"kima Shamie sarrut-sun likun!\" where the meaning of the word *sarrut* is determined by other passages which use the common word *ishda* \"foundation,\" Heb. \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3. For example, in same plate, col. iii. 53, \"kima shamie ishda-sun likuunu!\" which also occurs on the previous plate 68, col. ii. 17.\n\n117. **Shurru.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40, the Beginning.\u2014This word seems to be another derivative from the same root \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 *inchoavit*. R9, 62. \"In shurru sarti-ya,\" in the beginning of my reign.\n\n118. **Sirikta.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40, a Gift, or Recompense.\u2014From an Assyrian verb \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 \"to give,\" whence we have the very common words *ishruku*, he gave; *ishrukuni*, they gave.\n\nThe word *sirikta* is found several times in the Babylonian inscriptions. R69, col. iii. 39: The king Nabonidus, having constructed many temples, prays thus: *Ana shatti* (on this account) may the gods grant me abundant years \"ana sirikta\" as a recompense. Here \"years\" are expressed by \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40.\n\nIn R68, 23: *Surkam*, grant me; *balathu tamu rukuti*, a life of long days; *ana siriki*, as a recompense. Again, in R52, col. ii. of Rich's cylinder: *As shatta* (on that account) *surkam*, grant me; *baladam dara*, long life; *labar palie*, and prolonged years of reign; *ana siriki*, as a recompense. Again, in a short inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, published by Oppert, page 274, which is very like the last example.\n\n119. **Sapari.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40, Shavings.\u2014From Chald. \u05e1\u05b8\u05e4\u05b8\u05e8 to shave or clip. \"The tribe of the Bukudu I swept away like shavings,\" *kima sapari ashkhup.*\u20142R67, 13. He goes on\nto say, line 15, \"I swept the whole land of Chaldea\" khukarish \nwhich seems to mean \"very closely,\" or \"in a searching manner,\" from Chald.\n\n120. **Dikha.** , the Front: also adv. in Front of:\n\"I cut down (akush) the fine trees which grew in front of his palace, dikh dur-su. Not one of them was left!\"\n\u20142 R67, 24.\n\nValtu tami tsiri dikhi haikali ibakhu \"from extreme old age the front wall of the palace was split and rent.\"\u2014Bellino, line 48. In the remarkable escape of Merodach Baladan (which was probably in the night time) from the besieged city of Dur Yakina, we read (Opp. Khors. 15, 132): Edish ipparsidu, he escaped alone; dikhi dur-su izbatu, clinging to the front wall of his palace; kima suratsa, like a lizard (or reptile); eruba misussu, and reached a place of refuge.\n\nA few remarks on some of these words.\u2014Dikhi is spelt . Izbatu, this verb is frequently used in the sense of clinging closely, or embracing; as \"they embraced my feet;\" \"I embraced, or clung to, the knees (?) of the statue of Marduk,\" &c. Misussu for mis\u00fa-su \"his refuge;\" su (his) being an enclitic without any accent, which is thrown on the preceding word. or means discessit: remotus fuit (Sch. 984). Eruba pervenit: a frequent verb. Pervenit locum remotum.\n\n121. **Suratsa.** , a Reptile.\u2014In Opp. Khors. 15, 132, it is probably a lizard; which runs up and down walls with amazing agility. See the preceding article. Heb. saratsa, a reptile.\n\n122. **Shurus.** , the foundation-tablet of a Palace or City.\u2014To carry off this as a trophy was considered a great exploit of a conqueror. The meaning of the word seems identical with timin, as Oppert was the first to point out\nWhen Sargina took the city of Dur-Yakina, he says (Opp. Khors. 15, 134): *Timin-su assukha*, I carried off the foundation-tablet. But where the same event is alluded to in the inscription on one of the bulls, Sargina is called *Nasikh shur\u00fas ir Dur-Yakini*, he who dug up the foundation-tablet of the city of Dur-Yakina. The verb *nasikh* as Oppert has well pointed out, is the Chald. *eruit, extirpavit* (Sch. 1128): and *assukha* is the first person of the preterite of the same verb. The same phrase is used on another occasion, namely, in the barrel inscription, R36, 25, where Sargina is called *Nasikh shur\u00fas Hamatti*, he who dug up the tablet of the city of Hamath. It was, therefore, probably his usual practice when he conquered a city of celebrity. Oppert thinks *shurus* is the Heb. *radix*. It may, however, be a word derived from *shurru* \u201cthe beginning\u201d (See No. 117). In that case, *shurus* will stand for *shuru-su*, \u201cthe first stone of it,\u201d by a very common abbreviation, and the syntax will be as usual, \u201cI carried off its first stone (of) the city Dur-Yakina.\u201d\n\n**123. Dahututi.**\n\nAppurtenances of a thing; all that belongs to it.\u2014Opp. Khors. 5, 39. Vallutzun, King of Manna, made a treaty with Ursa, King of Urarda, and ceded to him twenty-two cities, *ki dahututi*, \u201cwith all that belonged to them.\u201d Another spelling appears to be *tihuti*. On a very ancient stone in the British Museum, one hundred pieces of silver are named as the price of a chariot \u201cwith all its appurtenances,\u201d *adi tihuti*. The origin of the word may be seen in Schiudler, page 352: *etiam vel* \u201chabens; possidens rem aliquam, et ea praeditus:\u201d plur. fem. *habentes.* Hence we may translate \u201ccities *ki dahututi* (with their possessions),\u201d Oppert has \u201ccum omni possessione,\u201d which appears to me correct. And hence also *dahut* is a \u201cgift,\u201d being something offered to a person for his own possession, as in the following example:\n\"He cut off the gold and silver from the temples, and sent it to the King of the Susians as a gift,\" ushabila's dahut \u2014R41, 22.\n\n124. Amir. au Envoy, or a Spokesman.\u2014 \"Ishbur amiri-su,\" he sent his envoy to me.\u2014Opp. Khors. 4, 31. Apparently from the Heb.amar, to speak. This, however, is uncertain. It may perhaps be the word mentioned by Buxtorf, page 1178, a substitute, vicegerent, or representative. Schindler omits the word. Perhaps the verb emiru (see the article No. 77) may be derived from Amir. Emiru ana shahal salmi, \"he sent a message to implore peace.\"\n\n125. Simta. the End.\u2014This word is somewhat uncertain. There is a passage in Opp. Khors. 4, which says: \"Sanzu, King of Manna, died at that time, and I placed on the throne his son Aza.\" \"He died\" is expressed by the words \"simta ubilu-su,\" which Oppert renders \"sors abstulit eum.\" But I see no evidence that simta means \"sors\" or \"fatum,\" and the verb ubilu means \"attulit\" and not \"abstulit,\" as when the king says \"attulerunt mihi dona,\" ubiluni. There is a very similar passage in the Annals of Esarhaddon, R46, 19, which says \"Arka Hazael simta ubil-su,\" after the death of Hazael (I placed Iahu-luhn his son on the throne). I think we have here, in both passages, the Chaldee word finis. Schindler, page 1204, says: terminavit: finivit. Ex. from the Rabbinic Chaldee, \"This Psalm begins with the word , and ends ( ) with the same word.\" And again: \"Where Moses ends ( ) David begins.\" We find also the substantive finis. We may translate literally \"When Hazael his end came to him.\" In the text concerning Hazael, ubil-su is written .\n\n126. Nish. Work.\u2014\"May the gods exalt (or perhaps 'love') the work of my hands!\" viz. the temple which\nI have made for them: *nish kati-ya liramu!*\u2014R16, 25. The Hebrew word corresponding is *misha* \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4, as in Exodus v. 4; \"Wherefore do ye hinder the people from their *works*?\" and in Ezek. xlvi. 1, \"The six days of *work*,\" as opposed to the Sabbath. \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05b5\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05dd \"the work of men's hands.\" Both *mish* and *nish* are legitimate derivations from \u05d9\u05b8\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d9\u05dd, to make.\n\nIn R63, 35, Nebuchadnezzar calls Babylon \"*nish ini-ya sha aramu*.\" Considering that the same verb, *rama*, is employed in both passages (*aramu* and *liramu*), I think that *nish* \u05e0\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1 must have the same meaning in both, and, therefore, \"*nish ini-ya*\" (the work of my eyes) must be a phrase, meaning the work in which my eyes delight: or, which I cherish as my eyes: or, doat upon: or some equivalent phrase. Sometimes \u05e0\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1 means \"carved work,\" or \"sculptured images,\" as in R70, 21, \"He carved on this stone tablet the images of the great gods.\" Perhaps, however, this is the Syriac *nisha* \u05e0\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1, Heb. \u05e0\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1 signum.\n\n127. **Lanni.** \u05dc\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9, Residence.\u2014In Latin, *commoratio*; as when one dwells for a time in a city not his own. This obscure word occurs in Opp. Khors. 15, 135, and I will attempt an explanation of it. It appears that certain inhabitants (probably merchants) of Babylon, Borsippa, &c., were dwelling in Dur-Yakiu, the capital of Merodach Baladan's kingdom, when that city was taken and burnt by Sargina, who treated these foreigners with kindness. The passage is: *Sha in lanni-sun in girbi-su kamu tsibitta-sun*, who in dwellings (or offices, hostels, places of business, lodgings, &c.), within that city, had placed their affairs.\n\n*Lanni* is from the Heb. *lun* \u05dc\u05b8\u05df to reside, generally for a short time; but in other passages, for an indefinite time: *ex gr.* Isaiah i. \"Justice will dwell in it\" \u05d9\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05df. Job. xli. \"In collo ejus manebit robur\" \u05d9\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05df. Psalm xlix. 13, \"Homo in honore non permanebit\" \u05d9\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05df. Hence also \u05de\u05b4\u05dc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05df an inn: a lodging, a lodge (in a garden of cucumbers).\nThe remainder of the phrase, *kamu tsibitta-sun*, merits attention. *Kamu* \u201cthey had placed,\u201d from the same root as the Arabic *makam* \u201clocus;\u201d *tsibitta-sun* their affairs. This is the Chald. and Syriac word *tsibut* \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05ea res, negocium (Schindler, 1513).\n\n128. **Nabali.** \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9 (plur. of Nabala), a kind of Harp.\u2014Greek *Na\u03b2\u03bb\u03b1*. Lat. *nablium*. Heb. \u05e0\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 nabla, which occurs frequently in the Psalms and other parts of Scripture, conjoined with the \u05db\u05b9\u05bc\u05e8 lyre? lute? It seems to have had ten strings (decachordon), but Josephus says twelve.\n\nThis interesting word occurs in the list of tribute received by Tiglath Pileser II. from the Kings of Syria and Palestine.\u20142 R67, 63.

The name Iahu-khazi signifies \"Iahu is my possession (or my treasure),\" from Hebrew \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9 \"a possession.\" The final vowel i should not be overlooked, since it is the pronoun \"my.\" Iahu = \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 of the Greeks,* which is the same as Jah or Jehovah. In 2R67, 61, this King Iahu-khazi (who is there called the King of Judah), is named as one of those who paid tribute to Tiglath Pileser II. But we know from 2 Chronicles, xxviii. 20, that Ahaz was the king who paid tribute to Tiglath Pileser; therefore Iahu-khazi was Ahaz. No doubt the name Jeho-ahaz (who was a different king) corresponds more nearly to the Assyrian name. Indeed it agrees with it exactly. But I am disposed to conjecture that Ahaz was originally named Jeho-ahaz, and that the Assyrians knew him by that name only; but that when Ahaz lapsed into idolatry, and no longer worshipped Jehovah, he dropped that holy name, being reluctant to bear it \"while making molten images for\n\n* See Diodorus, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Hesychius.

Baal. \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\), the name of a great deity of the Syrians.\u2014He is distinguished from the Bel \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82} \\) of the Assyrian mythology by the aspirate \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82} \\) which always occurs in his name. So the Hebrews have both \\( \\text{\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b5\u05dc} \\) and \\( \\text{\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b5\u05dc} \\). Examples of the name: In 2R67, 56, the king elevates a man named Idi Baal to be nigab (sovereign? or perhaps high priest?) over the land of Egypt. The name means \u201cBaal is with me.\u201d Idi \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82} \\) is \u201cmy hand,\u201d but Gesenius has explained that \\( \\text{\u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9} \\) (in manu me\u00e2) is merely a Hebraism for \u201cmecum.\u201d In this name Baal is written \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\).\n\nIn the next line to the above-named Idi-Baal we have Sibitti-Baal the King of Gubal (the Byblos of the Greeks). The latter part of his name is written \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\). The meaning of Sibitti-Baal is perhaps \u201cHost of Baal,\u201d i.e. the starry firmament, or the heavenly host, or perhaps the angels. Heb. \\( \\text{\u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05d1\u05b6\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05de\u05b6\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4} \\) or \\( \\text{\u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05d1\u05b6\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05de\u05b6\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4} \\) meaning the sun, moon, and stars.\u2014See Gesen. 851, for a copious account of this subject. Sibitti is spelt \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\). In R 38, 44, we have a King of Sidon named Tu-Baal \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\). In R 48, 2, we have a King of Tyre called simply \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\) or Baal. In line 6 of the same plate a King of Arvad called Kilu-Baal \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\) which may also mean \u201cHost of Baal,\u201d or \u201cArmy of Baal;\u201d Heb. \\( \\text{\u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05d1\u05b6\u05e8} \\) exercitus. Here it is important to observe that the name of Baal has the sign for \u201cdivinity\u201d prefixed to it. So it has also in 2R67, 60, where a King of Arvad bears a name which is possibly Nidinta-Baal (gift of Baal), but the first two syllables are broken off. The name of the god is written \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\). The name of Baal was very ancient; for we find in the Annals of\nAshurakhbal, two hundred years earlier than Sennacherib, the name of a certain prince called Ammi-Baal, or \"Baal is with me\" \u2014See R 20, 12. Here the name of Baal is written in one copy, but in the other the last letter is li.\n\n137. Ishtar. , the name of the great goddess of the Assyrians.\u2014It has also the general meaning of \"a goddess.\" The plural is ishtarat \"goddesses.\" Opp. Khors. 20, 176, the gods, and, the goddesses, asibut Ashur-ki who dwell in Assyria. This word ishtarat is plainly the Heb. \u05e2\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea eshtarot or ashtaroth, \"goddesses;\" as in Judges x. 6, \"And the Children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim \u05d1\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd (false gods) and Ashtareth \u05e2\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8\u05ea goddesses), and forsook the Lord and served not Him.\"\n\nBut when \u05e2\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d4 was used in the singular, it meant the great goddess of the Phoenicians and Philistines, Astarte, in Greek \u0391\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7. Her statue had horns, to signify that she was the moon. From hence a city received its name and was called Ashtaroth Karnaim \"the horned Astarte.\"\u2014Gen. xiv. 5. But she had also the simpler name of Ashtara \u05e2\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d4 whence the city called \"the temple of Ashtara\" \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e2\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d4, contracted into \u05d1\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, took its name (see Gesenius); it was a city of the Levites in the tribe of Manasseh beyond Jordan, and is named in Josh. xxi. 27, which in 1 Chron. vi. 71, is changed for the more usual Ashtaroth. This circumstance proves that Ashtaroth is the same goddess with Ashtara \u05e2\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d4, and the latter name is clearly identical with the Assyrian Ishtar. In Bellino 35, Nineveh is called \"the city beloved by Ishtar;\" and in the very same line, ishtar with a plural sign (to be read ishtarat) means \"goddesses\" in general.\n\n138. Assurita. , a Ship of Assyria.\u2014The word has this meaning in 2 R 46, col. iv. 2. The symbol for\n\"a ship\" is added. In the same passage, ships of other nations are mentioned in the same way, for instance, Milukhita, explained \"a ship of Milukha = Ethiopia.\"\n\nSecondly. Assuriti means \"the Assyrian goddess.\" This can hardly be doubtful when it is considered that the word is written the same as the \"ship\" above mentioned (see the passage from K 223, at the end of this article). Lucian has a treatise \"de de\u00e2 Syria;\" and it is probable that he so called the goddess, not merely because the Syrians worshipped her, but because he had heard her invoked by the name of Assuriti (Syria and Assyria being often viewed as the same name by the ancients). This interesting name of a goddess, Assuriti, occurs in the very ancient inscription of Tiglath Pileser I.\u2014R12, 36. The king relates how he captured twenty-five foreign idols, and then he says: \"I gave (ashruk) these deities to various temples of the gods in my own country;\" naming, among others, the temple of Ishtar Asuriti or \"Ishtar of Assyria.\" This goddess is named once more in the inscriptions of Tiglath Pileser, R14, 86, where the king relates how he built and dedicated several new temples in the city of Ashur which was his capital. The first he names is the temple of \"Ishtar Assuriti, my lady;\" the spelling is somewhat different from the former passage, being A slight doubt remains whether the name means \"Ishtar of Assyria,\" or \"Ishtar of Ashur\" (that is, of Ashur city). For we know from other inscriptions that there was an \"Ishtar of Nineveh\" and an \"Ishtar of Arbela,\" who were not viewed as absolutely the same divine persons, but rather as rivals.\n\nOn the tablet K 223, we read: \"of his god Ashur,\" \"and his goddess,\" Assurita (the last sign being almost effaced). Here is used in the general sense of \"goddess.\"\n\nDimu. Repose, Tranquillity.\u2014\"They dedicate this statue to Nebo, for the health of the king and queen, the\nhappiness of their days, the length of their years, and the tranquillity of their house and of their people.\u2014R35, No. 2, line 11. The Assyrians make a very important use of this word, having chosen it to express \"sunset.\" The Mediterranean Sea is called by them \"the great sea of the setting-sun,\" and \"sunset\" is expressed by dimu shemsi \"the repose of the sun\" or \"his rest.\" It was the popular belief that when the Sun set, he reposed during the night, and awoke in the morning \"like a giant refreshed.\" The deities of Olympus also required sleep:\n\n\"Th' immortals slumbered on their thrones above;\nAll, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.\"\n\nA conclusion of great importance seems to follow from this Assyrian phrase dimu shemsi, namely, that we have the same verb in the famous passage of Joshua x. 12, \u05e9\u05de\u05e9 \u05d3\u05d5\u05dd Shemesh dum! Sun, stand thou still! a phrase of which the Hebrew lexicons give but an imperfect account, because the verb \u05d3\u05d5\u05dd is nearly lost in Hebrew except in the sense of silence; insomuch that certain modern commentators have proposed to translate \"Sun, be silent!\" that is (as they maintain), the oracle of the Sun on Mount Gibeon was commanded to be silent; an explanation quite untenable, and opposed to the author of the book of Jasher, who, writing about the time the book of Joshua was written, understood that \"the Sun stood still in the midst of heaven.\" But we now see that the verb \u05d3\u05d5\u05dd was applied to the Sun by the Assyrian writers with the sense of rest or repose.\n\nEND OF THE FIRST PART.\nPart of Inscription at Labong.\n\n...(text in Lao script)\n\nat Sukkhotay\n\n...(text in Lao script)\nART. II.\u2014Remarks on the Indo-Chinese Alphabets.\n\nBy Dr. A. Bastian.\n\nIn the Ultra-Indian peninsula different layers of nationalities may be distinguished, being successive arrivals from different quarters. In most cases it is difficult to determine with exactitude the time of their respective settlements; but, as a general rule, the later conquerors have driven the former possessors of the soil into the hills, appropriating to themselves the more fertile lands on the banks of the rivers; and it may be readily assumed that the inhabitants we now find in the valleys of the Menam and Irawaddi are the most recent immigrants. History shows this to be the case. Whenever, in the course of events, the empires stretching along the great rivers became weakened by luxury or broken up by internal dissensions, the rude and warlike tribes of the surrounding mountains, watchful of the growing weakness of their former masters, and the decay of their defences, have burst from their forests and made slaves of the populations of the towns. This phenomenon, not unknown in other parts of the world, has been frequently repeated in the histories of Assam and Burmah, of Siam and of Kambodia; and it is by keeping before our eyes these continual revolutions that we may collect the disjecta membra of arts and sciences from the different quarters to which they have been scattered, and arrange them under one comprehensive aspect, where each of them occupies its natural position.\n\nApart from the people of the mountains, among whom savage aborigines are mixed up with refugees from oppressed kingdoms, we may divide the Indo-Chinese nations, according to the languages spoken by them, into four or five main branches\u2014the Thai (Siamese), the Myammas (Burmese), the Annamese (Tunquinese and Cochin-Chinese), the Mon (Talaing and Peguan), and the Khmer (Kambodian).\n\n1. The Thai race constitute the most important stock in\nthe very heart of the peninsula. All the different tribes, known as Shans by the Burmese, or as Laos by the Siamese, belong to it; and they have, through the Ahom, extended their influence as far as Assam. The Siamese themselves are only a sub-division of the Laos, their nearest relations; and during the reign of the old princes of Mogoung, the Shans were rulers in many of those provinces which afterwards formed the nucleus of the Burmese empire.\n\n2. The Burmese and Arracanese, the chief representatives of the Myamma race, are allied to the Singpho, the Kachars, the Manipuris, and the majority of those tribes which inhabit the countries extending to Bengal and North-western India.\n\n3. The Tunquinese and Cochin-Chinese, in their geographically secluded country, stand in a nearer connexion with the Chinese than with the other nations of the peninsula, from whom they are separated by the mountainous barrier which is washed by the Mekhong, and filled with an unknown multitude of various tribes, designated by the general name of Kha in Siamese and of Prom in Kambodian.\n\n4. The Mons or Talains, who line the coast opposite to Kalinga and Telengana, formed the ancient channel by which Indian arts and institutions found their way into Pegu.\n\n5. The Kambodians (the Khmer, Khom or Khamen) are still considered by the surrounding nations as their original teachers in religion and science.\n\nWith the exception of the people of Annam, who follow the Chinese, all the other Indo-Chinese nations have received their alphabets from India, and have adapted them to their monosyllabic tongues by the introduction of the tones or accents, which are so remarkable a characteristic of the Chinese language. Most of these alphabets have adopted in their arrangement the Sanskrit divisions into the several classes of gutturals, palatals, cerebrals, dentals, and labials. In the forms of the letters they have adopted a cursive and more flowing character, which imparts an external resemblance to the alphabets of Southern India, the Tamil and the Telinga, and more especially the Singhalese.\n\nThe Pali alphabet of the Trai-Pidok is used everywhere in\nthe peninsula in writing the sacred books; and the variations which the letters have undergone among the different nations who have adopted them, do not deviate much from their primary form. The Mon possess only this one alphabet in their literature; but among the Thai tribes, another class of alphabets has been formed for ordinary use, which is traceable more directly to Sanskrit than to Pali influence. The prototype of these alphabets is that of the Siamese, who use it for all the common purposes of their vernacular idioms, and make use of the Pali letters only in their religious books. The Shans, although they speak a dialect cognate to the Siamese, have given preference to the Burmese alphabet, which is the only one they use; but they experience much difficulty in its application, because of its unfitness for expressing the sounds of the language. The Southern Laos have therefore imitated the Siamese in adopting, together with their sacred alphabet, another for common use; and this common alphabet has been brought to greater perfection by the Laos Pung-dam (the black-bellied Laos), than among the white Laos (the Laos Pung-khao). But in Zimmay or Xiengmai, from its proximity to the Burmese frontier the Pali alphabet is chiefly used, even for ordinary purposes. In Viengchan the letters of the vulgar alphabet are called Akson (Akshara) Lao-xai (letters for missives), to distinguish them from the Akson Lao-khom. The Kambodian alphabet claims to be the common source from which all the different forms in the peninsula took their origin; and in Siam, as well as through the whole of Laos, the religious books are mostly known by the name of Nongs\u00fc-khom (Khamen or Khmer), as having been brought by the earliest missionaries who issued from the convents of ancient Kambodia. But even among the Kambodians there are traces of another alphabet, which at present has nearly become obsolete, giving way to Pali forms, or supplanted by the alphabet now used in Siam. The alphabets of the Burmese and Peguans are nearly identical, and differ only in the methods of spelling. The Peguan alphabet appears to be anterior to that of the Burmese, and is based on that of the Toungthoo (or at least on that of\nthe former possessors of Tathung). According to the Rev. Dr. Mason, the Toungthoo speak at present a dialect nearly allied to that of the Pwo-karen. In an old book which I saw at Bangkok, and which pretended to give the veritable Xieng of King Phra Ruang, the Peguan letters had even at that early date attained very nearly their present shape, whereas the Burmese alphabet bore a greater resemblance to the so-called Khom alphabets, which (according to Leyden) recall the Sinhala Pushp\u00e2kshara of Ceylon. These have preserved (even in writing the vernacular) the reduplication and subscription of consonants, to teach the rules of which the Pali letters are represented in the primers under two aspects\u2014first as unconnected, and then as joined with the abbreviated forms. On the decline of learning, the illiterate readers, forgetting the right application of these consonants, jumbled them together, and many Pali words, which at first sight are unintelligible, become quite clear when the consonants and vowels are placed in their right positions.\n\nA peculiar alphabet was in use among the Tsiampa before their once flourishing kingdom was destroyed by the Cochin-Chinese. The race is now almost extinct; and as European travellers had never previously visited the country, nothing of their literature has become known. I happened to fall in with a colony of fugitives, settled near Lawek, the former capital of Lower Kambodia, and I had the good fortune to see their vernacular alphabet, of which they gave me a copy at my request. As they have been converted to Islam, all their productions on religious subjects are written, as a matter of course, in the Arabic character; and this is the case generally with their ordinary writings. These people have been often mistaken for Siamese (both being called Siem by the Chinese, although their names are written with different characters), and this error has given rise to much confusion in the conclusions drawn by European writers from the Tonquinese records. The Arabic letters of their sacred books they call Akson Chwea or Xava, because they have received them from the Malays or Khek. Their vernacular books are sometimes written on palm-leaves, but the more modern ones\non a rough kind of paper. The Cham, settled at Battabong, showed me printed books in their peculiar alphabet, purchased from Cochin-Chinese traders, who bring them for sale, although they themselves do not understand them. An alphabet given to me by a Shan of the Yuns, who live at K\u00fcntun, near the frontier of Yunan, may probably resemble that of the Quanto, the ancestors of the Tunquinese, before the wild Yiaochi were civilized by the Chinese colonists. The old Ahom character, which has been supplanted by the Burmese alphabet, is now intelligible only to Pandits.\n\nDuring my stay in Further India, I took from the very first a particular interest in the Brahmans, who are frequently met with in Burmah as well as in Siam and Kambodia, partly wandering about as cowherds or begging alms, partly employed as astrologers and diviners in the royal courts. In visiting their houses, I soon got sight of books peculiar to them, and easily obtained copies of the alphabets in which they are written. Of the different Laos alphabets, some were collected by missionaries, who allowed me to copy them; and others I had written down for me by Laos priests, who, for the benefit of their travelling countrymen, live in convents at Bangkok and other towns of Siam and Kambodia.\n\nThe Kambodians pretend to have received their alphabet by direct importation from Langka, on the arrival of Buddhaghosa; but the same claim is raised by the Arracanese or Rakaing, who allege that the famous apostle brought it to their shores. Another candidate for that honour is the ancient town of Thatung, in the country afterwards called Pegu, when Hongsavadi was built by the Talaings or Raman. The rock inscription at Ramree mentions not only the arrival of Buddhaghosa, but also of still earlier missionaries; and the Burmese themselves acknowledge that they built the pagodas in Pagan after the model of those they saw at the conquest of Thatung.\n\nThe Indo-Chinese nations have mostly borrowed philosophical and scientific expressions from the Pali, with which language the era of their civilization commenced; but for such terms the Siamese frequently possess two words, one of\nwhich appears to have been directly taken from the Sanskrit, and the other to be derived through the medium of Pali, in the same way as in the modern languages of Europe we find technical terms still retaining distinctly their Greek origin, and others which came to us after passing through the Latin. As it is not so easy for monosyllable languages to assimilate the complex Sanskrit words as the simplified forms of the Pali, these are naturally preferred in speaking Siamese; but the Sanskrit root will be recognised in writing, as those words are generally encumbered by a long tail of mute letters, which have been \"killed\" by the sign of Thanthakhath written over them, but which, if pronounced, would give the sound as it exists in Sanskrit.\n\nThe common numeral figures are called Lek-vat by the Siamese, to distinguish them from the more elegant forms of the Lek-pachong. When used in calculations, the tua-lek (full-bodied numerals) are shortened to the hong-lek (the tail of the numerals), in which nothing remains of the full body (tua) but the extreme lines, drawn in different directions. The principal arithmetical rules are contained in the book Sut-lek (the accomplishment of numbers), which boasts of an august origin, having been composed by Phrom (Brahma) in the Pathomma-klab (the first or Lotus-kalpa). The mathematical work of Tamrah-lek or Chot-lek, which treats of land-measuring, is jealously kept from the common people by those magistrates who have got possession of a copy. The Burmese have borrowed all their ordinal numbers from the Pali, whereas the Siamese have formed their ordinals from their own cardinals. But in some cases, when a ceremonial language is employed, the latter also use the Pali terms, not only for the ordinals but also for the cardinals. It is always observed among the Siamese, that men of any education affect to have forgotten the terms of the vulgar tongue, and employ Pali expressions in preference; and in course of time words really get quite lost by this fondness for pedantic phraseology. The language of the present Kambodians is so rapidly getting intermixed with Siamese words by the people affecting to imitate the speech of their\nSiamese masters, that it has often been mistaken for a dialect of Siamese.\n\nThe Indo-Chinese people, in writing out their alphabets, usually begin by the well-known invocation, \"Namo Phutthaya,\" \"Namo tassa bhagavato,\" etc. etc., followed by an enumeration of the short and long vowels. The latter are, therefore, styled the Namo, whereas the series of consonants is called the Ka-kha after the first letters of the alphabet. The alphabetical arrangement of the letters is followed by the combinations of consonant and vowel, as in Devanagari alphabets. In Siamese the different combinations of vowels and consonants are distributed over nine tables, the last of which is the longest, and rather difficult for beginners. In the Khyoungs a separate spelling-book is added for those who wish to study Pali.\n\nThe peculiar Siamese mode of denoting the vowels has been developed gradually; in the oldest rock inscription, that of Sukkhothay, the vowels are still written in a line with the consonants on the same level. The accentuation also can be shown to have passed through different phases, till it arrived at its present complicated arrangement, which is due to grammarians of the last century. In the Kamphi-hon (the text-books of astrologers), the vowels are converted into a kind of diacritical signs, being no longer written as distinct letters on a line with the consonants. The chief, and almost the only difference, between the spoken tongues of the Laos and of the Siamese consists in the circumstance that the former know nothing of the tones,\u2014the artificial display of which constitutes the delight of a Siamese speaker. The number of influential Chinamen in Siam may have contributed to bring them into fashion. Next to the Chinese, the Siamese language is richest in tones; whereas they are more sparingly used by the other Indo-Chinese nations, the Burmese, for instance, having only two tones,\u2014the light and the heavy. In the native Hokk\u00eben (Fo-kien) pronouncing dictionaries, the Chinese characters are classed under eight sections, in accordance with the number of tones. Of the Cambodian language, neither grammar nor dictionary has ever been\npublished, but in a manuscript grammar which I found at the house of a missionary in Battabong, it was said: \"Lingua Camboica sat facilis est ad loquendum, utpote plane est carens tonis, ut sunt in Sinica, Annamitica et Siamitica, attamen paullisper dura videtur et agrestis in pronunciacione.\" In a Siamese book, which celebrates the discovery of the holy Phrabat on the rock near Naphaburi, and which was probably written about that time (1601), accents very seldom occur, and my moonshee, who pointed out the fact, stated the same to be the rule in the works of that period.\n\nA natural consequence of the elaborate system of accentuation is the accumulation of euphonic and expletive particles, because our oratorical or emphatical intonation must necessarily be inadmissible in the speech of a Siamese or a Burmese, where the modulation of voice will at once change the meaning of any particular word, instead of giving a colouring to the spirit of the entire sentence. In a lucid treatise on the tones, which circulates in manuscript at Bangkok, the late Rev. Mr. Caswell says in regard to this:\u2014\"In Siamese, difference of orthography without change of sense occurs more frequently than change of tones without change of sense.\" We, on the contrary, often intentionally, change the orthography to distinguish to the eye two words of like sound (such as beech and beach), but we leave the tone entirely at the option of the speaker. In Siamese the emphasis influences the prosody.\n\nThere is a great variety of secret modes of writing both among the Burmese and the Siamese. Some of these may have been employed for political purposes or in the mysteries of religion; but most of them are nothing more than an idle game with letters and ciphers, without use or meaning. A Burmese savant gave me a list of sixty-six of these ciphers with long names attached to them. Sometimes the rounded forms of the Burmese letters have been made angular to give them a strange look, after the manner of the kyouk-tsa or the so-called square Pali, which is, in fact, merely a graphic variation of the ordinary writing. This square alphabet is employed in writing the Kammav\u00e2cha, and it may be seen in Lassen and Burnouf's \"Essai sur le Pali,\" and in Latter's\nGrammar. The square form of the letters arose, no doubt, from attempts made to engrave the Burmese letters on stone, when it was found more easy to cut them in straight lines than in circles. In this way the character would get its name of kyouk-tsa (stone-writing); but now, being found only in the ancient inscriptions of ruined pagodas, it has acquired an odour of sanctity, and is looked upon by the people as something peculiarly sacred and mysterious. In like manner the alphabet of the Siamese stone-inscriptions, which are supposed to embody the mysteries of the Sinlaprasat (various sciences) has an aspect of stiffness, which is naturally lost when the characters are traced on a softer material.\n\nThe Sanskrit is at the head of a long array of occult languages in Burmah, and the first who spoke to me about it (a young scholar in Prome, just returned from the high school of Mandalay,) assured me that any one who was well versed in this wonderful tongue would have no difficulty whatever in understanding the language of birds. The specimens which he gave me were composed in a corrupt style of Sanskrit, and full of orthographical blunders.\n\nThe favourite and the simplest method of secret writing consists in replacing the letters by numerals, of which kind a specimen is found in Latter's Grammar, under the name of D\u00fb:-ga\u00f1an, where the consonants, with the exception of the third or fourth class, are represented by the first nine numerals. The substitution of vowels by numerals, instead of their usual symbols, occurs not only in the Kyouktsa-ga\u00f1an, but also in other modes of occult writing. The Paliga\u00f1an, which is used in Burmese, also means a numerical figure, and it occurs in Siamese in the form ganan, \"to keep accounts.\" My informant, in giving me copies of these alphabets, added, that the D\u00fb:-ga\u00f1an was used in correspondence by persons who wished to conceal their meaning; and that the Kyouktsa-ga\u00f1an was placed on the foundation-stones of pagodas to indicate in what direction the treasure lay buried. A more complicated illustration of the Ga\u00f1an-myo is that called Pun\u00f1\u00e0:-yeik-ga\u00f1an (the arithmetical writing of Brahmans), in which not only the\ntwenty principal letters, but all the thirty-three which compose the Burmese alphabet were represented by different combinations of numerals. Of the other sixty kinds, I will only mention two species of the Thinghya-ganan, one of which was said to represent the letters of the Ka-d\u00fb: and the other was the Tsun-katha-ganan, or the supposititious alphabet of the Kakhyns, north of Burmah.\n\nIn Siamese, the occult modes of writing, called Kho-labl\u00fck (profound objects) are mostly based on the same principles of replacing the letters by numerals, and the knowledge of them may become useful in deciphering inscriptions, because the dates, when written with letters (as is also frequently the case in Java) do not always possess their usual numeral powers, but sometimes those which they have acquired by the artificial arrangement of their substitutes. In the writing called Fon-sen-ha (rains in great abundance), the consonants are replaced by regular combinations of numerals, but the vowels retain their usual form. The Sala-lek, on the contrary, replaces the vowels by certain combinations of numerals, leaving the consonants untouched. In the R\u00fcsi-pleng-san (the mutations in the epistles of hermits), the writer transposes the letters of words according to a regulated system, which can only be read by one possessed of the key. A similar modification of the alphabet is that called Ko-kho-phalat-kan (the alternate changes of the letters in the alphabet); but the Thai-nabsam and the Thai-long follow a method of their own, which consists in multiplying the arithmetical powers of the letters by a number previously agreed upon. To this class belongs a vast variety of riddles, puns, rebuses, and anagrams, which form an inexhaustible source of amusement for the Siamese youths. A punster is highly valued among them, and still more by the Burmese girls, who are in the habit of putting their lovers to very severe tests of witticism. Another fund of equivoques exists in the different modes of accentuation; and the Siamese find a rich store of jokes and quibbles by intermixing the rude dialects of the peasantry with the polished pronunciation of the townspeople. The Siamese never lose an opportunity for a laugh at the people of Ligor (Nakhon Srithamarat or\nMyang Lakhon), who speak the Siamese language with an even delivery, without any regard to the tonic accents. Nevertheless, it is Ligor that produces most of the actors in theatrical representations at Bangkok; but the intonation in the Lakhon (dramas) is in itself so peculiar that the irregularities of the provincial idiom become indifferent. In Burmah, also, the language of the stage is a language of its own, changing frequently the meaning of words and employing high-sounding and far-fetched synonyms, although not to the same extent as the language of poetry, or the Linga-tsaga. Whimsical vagaries, which it would be difficult to reduce to a system, are found in the style of books professing to teach the art of gold-making, which are mostly ascribed in Siam to a great adept in that science named Maha-thay. In Burmese translations of the Pitakat-thon-pon, sentences in Pali are regularly followed by the Anet or explanation in the vulgar tongue. Most of the Siamese translations have likewise a copious sprinkling of Pali; but Pali forms are carefully avoided in the Mon or Mantras, which consist of prayers for the use of women, because it would be a great sin (bab) if a female eye should fall upon the sacred character of the Nongs\u00fc-khom. They might even be injured and die by the innate power (Rith) of these holy symbols.\n\nThose Kambodian priests who occupied themselves with reading (of whom, it is true, there are only a few) told me that originally letters had been divided into three kinds,\u2014the Akson-xieng or xrieng, Akson-m\u00fbl, and Akson-m\u00eeng. Xieng means inclined, and the Akson-xieng were described as angular letters, in contradistinction to the Akson-m\u00fbl or khlom of the present day,\u2014khlom being the Siamese, and m\u00fbl the Kambodian word for \"round;\" the Akson-m\u00eeng are the large-headed letters, which are now extant in the inscriptions of Lalai and Vat-ek. In the Siamese history of the Phongsavadan-myang-nya, it is related that Phra Ruang, or Phra Lung, the mythical king of Sukkhothay, invented the Xieng-phama, Xieng-mon, Xieng-khamen, Xieng-thay, etc.; and characters formed of straight lines were used in several parts of the Archipelago, among the Rejang, the Wugi (Bugis),\nthe Batta, etc. etc. The authentic forms of these ancient letters have been lost, and are of course unknown to the Siamese; but the Siamese still give the value of \"ancient\" to the word Xieng, and employ it to denote several kinds of antiquated alphabets. Most of these are supposed to have been devised by Maharaxakhru, which name, however, is no patronymic, and only means the King's great Guru, or teacher. In Kam-bodia, the word Chieng serves to distinguish the letters in ordinary use from the sacred letters. The Laos allude directly to Phra-maha-anon (Rahanda or Ananda) as the inventor of their modes of writing; and they place Phra-phuttha-khosachan (Buddhaghosa) only in a second line among the later reformers and improvers of the Akson-lao-xai. Some innovations are attributed to N\u00e2gasena, known as N\u00e2g\u00e2r-juna in his discussions with Milinda, king of the Yonas or Janaka; and the Laos claim for themselves the name of Janaka, in accordance with their fancy of transferring the names of Western India to the transgangetic peninsula.\n\nOn entering the convent, the Laos boys are first taught the invocation of Buddha, the so-called Namo. After having learned the ten Sila, or precepts, they begin to read the Akson-lao-khom, and when these are mastered the Akson-lao-xai. The last finish is given by instruction in some cursive kinds of writing and by lessons in arithmetic, unless they prefer, by assuming the yellow robe, to enter upon the long and dreary road of Buddhistic theology.\n\nIn the Temple-court of the royal palace at Bangkok, three stone-inscriptions have been placed, which had been discovered on the sites of ancient cities. These have recently been copied by order of the king. They have not yet been translated. The oldest of them is that of Sukkhothay, which celebrates the auspicious reign of king Ramkhamheng, his deeds and institutions, with many details relative to the description of the capital and the extent of the kingdom. In my endeavours to decipher it, I applied to all those natives who were pointed out to me as particularly sagacious; and although my questions were often asked in vain, I received from some of them valuable aid, and was able to avail myself of their sug-\ngestions and corrections. Among the missionaries residing at Bangkok, I am greatly indebted to Mr. Chandler and his learned lady for the identification of the alphabet. The letters bear a more ancient type than that of the other two inscriptions, which have rather a religious than a political purport.\n\nAccording to the inscription brought from Labong, in Laos, Somdet-bophit-maha-raxa-chao, king of Xiengmai, buried many relics enclosed in an iron chest, which was to last the 5000 years of the Phuttha-s\u00e2sana (Buddha's religion), invoking Phra-In (Indra) and Phrahm (Brahma), and founding the holy period. He made his parents partakers of the merits distributed, and accumulated thereby merits in such abundance that even oxen, elephants, and horses could profit by the opportunity, and proceed direct to Niruphan (Nibban).\n\nThe inscription found at Kampheng-phet (the city of the diamond-wall), near Rahaing, contains many details, which I hope may be useful in bringing some order into Siamese chronology, but I have not yet succeeded in making out the whole reading to my satisfaction; I therefore limit myself to a short summary. Phra-l\u00fcthai-rat, who, on his coronation in the town of Srisatxanalai-sukkhothay, received the title of Sri Suriya Phra Maha Thammar\u00fbx\u00e2thir\u00e2t, buries in several places some holy relics which had been brought from Langka-thavib (the island of Ceylon), together with the seeds of the Phra-sri-maha-phot (the great Bodhi tree of felicitous blessedness). At the time of Phra-phutth (Phra-pen-chao, or the lord, who is the master), the life of man reached a hundred years; the king enters into a calculation how many years had elapsed to shorten it to the seventy years of the period of the inscription; and then being continually importuned, as he says, by questions about the duration of the religion of Phra-phutth on earth, he tries to satisfy the inquirers: he tells them that, after ninety-nine years, the knowledge of the Phra-pidok-trai will become imperfect; after a thousand years the observance of the precepts will be discontinued; in another thousand years there will be nobody left wearing yellow garments (not so much yellow cloth will be found as would suffice to be placed behind the ear), and after a thousand years more all the holy relics will fly through the air to\nLangka, and having been collected there, will be burnt in the flames which rise up to Phrohmalok. Thenceforth all beings will go to Naraka until the arrival of Phra-sri-arimatheia, the believers in the Phra-phuttha-s\u00e2sana having died already after the second thousand. But the precise time of these events cannot be fixed, because nobody can compute the exact amount of merits accumulated by the pious actions of king Phra Maha Thammar\u00e2x\u00e2thir\u00e2t. These continual changes of the era make all historical events in ultra-India matters of much doubt and uncertainty unless they can be subjected to a certain control by counting them both ways, forwards and backwards.\n\nKing Ramkambheng, who records on the stone-pillars of Sukkhothay the invention of the letters now called Nongs\u00fc-tch-boran (writings of old) by the Siamese, is often identified with one of the representatives of Phra Ruang, a favourite name of frequent recurrence in Siamese history. Phra Ruang is to the Siamese the founder of their nationality, to him all their proud romances are referred, when the name of Thay, the \"freemen,\" was acquired, and the yoke of the Kambodians was broken; but there are also some obscure traditions, considered as the most ancient, which are never written, but only handed down orally; and in these it is said that Phra Ruang belonged to the Khot Phrahmana, was of Brahminical descent, and that he reigned over the Lava. I must leave the reconciliation of these conflicting statements for another opportunity, and will only remark that the Siamese critics themselves distinguish generally two different personages as bearing the title of Phra Ruang. The first of these resided at Savankhalok, and abolished the era, introducing in its stead the Chunlo-sakkharat. He was the son of a N\u00e2ga or Nakh (a subterraneous serpent in dragon-like form), an expression which in further India, as once in Attica, expresses relationship to the aborigines of the soil. The second Phra Ruang is known also in Peguan history as the father-in-law of Chao-farua, who expelled the Burmese governor of Martaban, and founded an independent kingdom in that town. The date of Ramkhamheng must be assigned to a period anterior to the time of the latter king, so that his reign falls between the\ntwo Phra Ruangs. The true history of the Siamese race in the valley of the Menam commences with the building of Ayuthia, and the modern part of the annals is therefore called the history of Ayuthia. Between this city and Pechaburi is situated the most ancient pagoda of Siam, the Pathomma-chedi, which the Siamese themselves acknowledge to have been erected before their arrival in that country. On its restoration by the now reigning king, some curious inscriptions were found in an old kind of Devanagari, resembling the stone records which exist in the province of Ligor and in other parts of the Malayan peninsula. At present the kings do not go so far as to record their actions on stone. They follow the general practice, and are satisfied with writing them on paper, at least in Siam, where the first king has become an author, and has composed books on Buddhism, history, and grammar. In Mandalay I saw one of the courtyards in the palace converted to a dwelling for stonemasons, some dozen of whom were engaged in cutting the Praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101 of the Abhidhamma on massive stone-posts, which the king intended to place in lines along the highways of his kingdom. As it is not unusual, however, in those parts of the world to see many things begun with much parade which are never expected to come to an end, I fear that such has been the fate of this project also, which would have threatened Asoka\u2019s fame with a rival. The King of Siam has invented an alphabet, the letters of which he thinks adapted to the Indo-Chinese languages as well as to those of the Arian family; he has called it therefore Aryaka (Arekyamatthu). Some books have been printed in this character at Bangkok at the King\u2019s own press, and it was at one time studied eagerly by all those who wished to court royal favour. This same king, who holds the first rank in his kingdom, not only by his birth but by his learning, has composed a Pali Grammar, in which he abandons Kachch\u0101yana for the system of Latin Grammar, which he has been taught by the French missionaries. It is written in usum Delphini for the princes entering the priesthood.\n\nThe alphabets collected in my travels are the following:\u2014\n\n1. Alphabet of the Thounghtoo or Pa-au.\n2.

III.\u2014The Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, Arragonese.\n\nBy the Hon. H. E. J. Stanley.\n\n[Read January 9th, 1866.]\n\nMohamed Rabadan was a native of Rueda on the river Xalon, one of those Moriscoes who were driven out of Spain, chiefly on the ground that they would not and could not amalgamate with the Spaniards, and that they clung to the Arabic language and customs, and were, and always would remain Arabs, foreigners in Spain and enemies of its people. It is possible that at the time of the expulsion some of the Moriscoes did not know Spanish, but it is yet more probable that the great majority of them knew nothing of Arabic; and the best proof of this is the volume written by Rabadan.\n\nThe Manuscript upon which these remarks are written is in the collection of the British Museum. It was brought to England by Mr. Morgan, H. M. Consul at Tunis, who wrote on the MS., \"I bought this MS. in the town of Tessatore, about fifteen leagues westwards from the city of Tunis, sold me by Hamooda Bussesa Tabib. Septr. 27, 1719.\" Mr. Morgan says that there were twelve villages or towns in the province of Tunis where the people spoke Spanish, and in one of them Catalan, and that there were two old men who could read it. He says that these people knew by heart, and were in the habit of reciting, the poems of Rabadan. He also mentions another Spanish MS., dated 1615, by Abdul Kerim bin Aly Perez, which he had in his hands for a few days, and of which, unfortunately, he preserved no copy. However, he translated a portion of it, a most eloquent invective against the Inquisition. Mohamed Rabadan wrote in 1603 in Spanish for the instruction of the Moriscoes, who understood no other language. This fact, and the pertinacity with which the Moriscoes continued to use the Spanish language a hundred and twenty years after arriving in Africa, in the midst of an Arab population, show how ill-founded was one of the pleas for their expulsion.\n\nMr. Morgan published a translation of all of Rabadan's poems in two volumes in 1723, under the title of \"Mohamed-\nanism Unveiled; or, Discourse of the Light and Lineage of the Prophet Muhammad.\u201d His translation is not good; for besides shirking all the difficult passages, he is a very unfaithful translator, constantly adding words not in his text, and giving too English a form to the ideas of his author: he has, however, added some very good notes and interesting anecdotes in various parts of the work. He was the author of other works, one of which, on Barbary, deserves especial mention and praise. It is singular that these two books of Morgan\u2019s should have so completely fallen out of sight: it is owing probably to the smallness of the edition. Rabadan\u2019s poems were published by subscription, and most of the names in the list of subscribers seem to be extinct.\n\nThough Rabadan describes himself as a cultivator, one who himself had followed the plough, his verse is pronounced by a most competent judge, Don P. Gayangos, to be composed in very elegant Spanish; and he frequently uses classical metaphors, and occasionally Latin terms, which show that he must have been familiar with good Spanish authors. Some of these, not common at the present time, are frequently used by Alonzo Azevedo in his poem on the \u201cCreation,\u201d printed at Rome in 1615. At the same time the Arabic words, of which several are used which are now lost from the Spanish language, are so defaced that it is difficult to recognize them: the letter *jim* seems to have lost its pronunciation, and is never represented by *j* or *g*, but by the softer *eh*, as, for instance, *alehana* for *aljannat*, *chahana* for *jehenum*. Nearly all the Arabic substantives are employed with the Arabic article prefixed to them, and in addition to that the Spanish article *el*. In two places a fragment of Arabic construction has been preserved in the phrases, *conseguid lalehanesa*, instead of *conseguid al alehanesa*, \u201cfollow the funeral procession;\u201d and *obedeceed lallhalifa*, instead of *obedeceed al alhalifa*, \u201cobey the khalif.\u201d In these two instances, the Arabic preposition *J* to has been preserved instead of using the Spanish preposition; the *fathah* of the article has not, however, been changed as it should have been to *kesrah*, which seems to show a great disuse of Arabic as a spoken\nlanguage. These poems are not only interesting to the philologist on account of the Arabic words scattered over them, but also on account of some old Spanish words now obsolete, and some words from Catalan, such as vegada for vez, \"a time.\" The correctness of the relation of Mohamed Rabadan is very remarkable, considering the difficulties under which he laboured, and his complaint that he had \"to seek for MSS. and papers in different parts of the kingdom, where from fear of the Inquisition, they were already lost and dispersed.\"\n\nThe principal portion of these poems is a history of the prophets, beginning with the Creation of the World, and going on to describe the Deluge. The cantos describing the Creation have an additional interest from the passages in it which are parallel to Milton; some of these are necessarily similar, from the subject matter, such as the explanation of Man's Free Will; in other cases there may be a common Rabbinical origin of the ideas of both poets. Rabadan frequently refers to the Hebrew commentary. In his description of the Universal Deluge, Rabadan sometimes uses the same words and phrases as in his description of the laying waste of the world before the Great Judgment, and he appears to draw a parallel between the two. A very large space is devoted to the history of Abraham, to vindicating \"his purity and chastity,\" and to setting right the genealogies of Ishmael and of Isaac, which Rabadan says had become confused and intermingled in the minds of the Moriscoes, \"on account of the common voice and opinion of the Christians, which with such certainty and assurance represented the just Ishmael, and all his family and lineage as null, depriving him of the palm of the sacrifice and giving it to Isaac, and making an imputation against the good Abraham and our leader by saying that on account of his lineage being bastard he could not be a prophet.\" The lives of the other prophets are then slightly sketched, and the poet enters more into detail in the history of Hashim, Abdul Muttalib, and the Prophet. One of the best cantos in the book is one describing the death of Muhammad, and the last time he appeared before the companions in the mosque at Medina: the scene in which\nMuhammad asked if he owed any man anything, or had done any one an injury, in order that he might make restitution for it, so touchingly described by M. de Lamartine, is here related a little differently; but it is a proof how closely Rabadan has adhered to the texts or to the tradition, that the Newab of Oude, Ikbal ed-Dowlah, related the story of Uquexar to me, and to another member of the Society, almost in the very words of the Spanish poet.\n\nThere is a MS. copy of Rabadan in the Biblioth\u00e8que Imperiale of Paris, which does not appear to be as old as that in the British Museum. Many words in the Paris MS. are spelt in a more modern way than in the London MS., such as perfecto for perfeto, Gibril for Chebril, lanzadle for lanzalde, etc. etc. It is in some cases more correct, and contains some passages which are wanting in the London MS.; also Spanish words have in some cases been substituted for the Arabic words used in the London MS. The Paris copy does not contain the poem on the months of the year.\n\nNearly all the Arabic words to be found in this MS., and which are no longer used in Spanish, are either religious or legal terms, such as almalaque, \"an angel;\" aleursi and alarx, \"the Divine throne;\" aleafara, \"expiation;\" acidaque, \"dowry;\" alguali, \"a woman's legal deputy.\" These words supply a further proof that amongst the Moriscoes the Spanish grammar and idiom had taken the place of the Arabic, for we find halecar, \"to create,\" and instead of makhluk, \"a creature,\" halecado, and \"creation,\" halecimiento; so also azachdado, \"prostrated;\" taharado, \"purified;\" alhijantes, \"pilgrims.\"\n\nHere follows the \"History of the Day of Judgment;\" or, as it may be called, a Morisco Divina Commedia: and a canto containing an account of the death of the Prophet. The account of the Creation and of the Deluge may appear in the next number of the Journal. It will hardly be necessary to give a translation of Rabadan's prose Introduction in the Journal, since the substance has in part been stated here, and the translation is to be found in Morgan, whilst the original is printed in the Spanish translation of Ticknor's History of Spanish Literature by D.

B\u00edbel muy llorando,\nY como di\u00f3 la respuesta\nSe levant\u00f3 un alarido\nQue en la mesquida retruena;\nAl cielo suben las voces,\nLos gemidos y querellas,\nPidiendo al Se\u00f1or remedio\nPara su santo profeta.\nEra el sentimiento grande\nLa vozer\u00eda y las quexas\nQue las oy\u00f3 el anabi;\nY le dieron tanta pena,\nAquello amargos lloros\nQue sus compa\u00f1eros echan,\nQue suplic\u00f3 \u00e1 su Se\u00f1or,\nPor su piadad le conceda\nGracia para ver su gente,\nLa desdichada postrera.\nSinti\u00f3 el alivio postrero,\nY luego en pie se endereza,\nAfirmando sobre Ali\nQue estaba \u00e1 su cabezera\nQue hab\u00eda venido \u00e1 verle,\nCuando B\u00edbel di\u00f3 la nueva,\nEntr\u00f3 en la casa de All\u00e1h\nHaciendo tres reverencias\nCumplidas, que

hechas.\nEl segundo, se humillaba\n\u00c1 la tumba do se encierra\nEl muy honrado alcoram;\nY la tercera obidencia,\nHacia la alta bondad,\nQue le d\u00e9 salud y fuerzas.\nCuando lo vio su Suh\u00e1ba,\nNo hay lengua que decir pueda\nEl alegria y contento\nQue les caus\u00f3 su presencia,\nTeniendo por muy creido\nSer pasada su dolencia;\n\n\u00b9 \u062f\u064a\u0646 religion,\n\u00b2

IV.\u2014Catalogue of the Oriental Manuscripts in the Library of King's College, Cambridge. By Edward Henry Palmer, B.A., Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge; Member of the Royal Asiatic Society; Membre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique de Paris.\n\nThe books in the accompanying list are either in\u2014I. Persian; II. Arabic; III. Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed; or IV. Hind\u00ed and Hind\u00fa\u00ed; and they are described in strict alphabetical order under each of those heads.\n\nThe following letter gives an account of the way in which the books came into possession of the College:\n\nKing's College, 12th November, 1866.\n\nDear Mr. Palmer,\u2014The manuscripts, of which you have been good enough to draw up the list, which I trust the Asiatic Society will print, came to us at the end of last century. The donor, Edward Ephraim Pote, was a son of Mr. Pote, of Eton, and was elected a scholar of this College in 1768. He took his degree in 1773, and seems to have entered the Civil Service of the East India Company very soon after that.\n\nIn his letter to the College, dated \"Patna, 6th February, 1788,\" he says: \". . . from the time of my arrival in the East I have exerted my utmost endeavours to obtain some Asiatic writings worthy the acceptance of our societies; and have the pleasure to inform you that at length I have acquired a collection of Persian Manuscripts amounting to more than 550 volumes. I propose doing myself the honor of presenting one-half of these books to our College and the other half of them to the College at Eton. . . . . I have been disappointed in my hopes of sending you these manuscripts by the ships of this season, yet I cannot restrain my desire of communicating the acquisition I have made . . .\"\nThe collection, contained in eight chests, arrived in England in 1790; and by an agreement made between the Provosts of the two colleges, the chests marked A, B, C, D, were allotted to King's College, and the remaining four were sent to Eton.\n\nA glance at your list will show that the books were arranged roughly in alphabetical order according to their titles, and in that order packed in the chests; so that, with very few exceptions, we have at Cambridge the first half of the alphabet, while those which fall into the latter half may be looked for at Eton.\n\nI only mention these details with a view of showing that the responsibility of this mode of division (which has been the cause of amusement to many persons) does not rest with the donor; and that, therefore, if an examination of the two collections, such as that to which you have subjected ours, should make it appear desirable that some of the volumes might with advantage change places, there could be no possible difficulty in adjusting the matter.\n\nBut the most interesting circumstance about the collection is one which is not generally known. The books bought by Mr. Pote evidently formed part of the Oriental library of Colonel Polier, who is known as the first person who brought to Europe a complete copy of the Vedas. His seal, \"Major Polier, A.H. 1181,\" occurs, as you remember, in a large number of the volumes, and his autograph, \"Ant. Polier,\" in several. A full account of Polier and of his family is given by MM. Haag in La France Protestante, derived chiefly from information supplied by M. Dumont, the librarian at Lausanne.\n\nBorn at Lausanne, in 1741, Polier entered the service of the East India Company at an early age. He won the confidence and respect of Lord Clive and of Warren Hastings; but, through a great portion of his thirty years' stay in India, he was enabled to devote himself to Indian literature, solely by reason of that illiberal spirit of English jealousy which first resented and then cancelled the appointment of a foreigner to a post of military authority.\n\nHis biographers mention the fact of his return to Europe in 1789; and they further mention the choice collection of\nmanuscripts which he brought home: the Vedas, which he presented to the British Museum, and (besides a few others) forty-two volumes of Arabic, Persian, and Sanscrit manuscripts which were obtained from his heirs, and are now in the Imperial Library at Paris. No mention, however, is made of the bulk of his library; but putting the facts side by side, there seems no doubt that the collection acquired by Mr. Pote in 1788 contains a large portion of Polier's library as he left it; and as such, as the collection of one of our earliest orientalists, it merits examination.\n\nOne advantage of the books having been thus early brought together is apparent; namely, that there are to be found here many small historical pieces which may serve to unravel the intricacies of Indian history during the sixty or seventy years before the rise of the English power, which it is almost hopeless to look for in any other collection. It is from this point of view especially that I hope to see good results arise from the publication of your catalogue. Yours very truly,\n\nHENRY BRADSHAW.\n\nE. H.

V.\u2014Description of the Amravati Tope in Guntur. By J. Fergusson, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nHitherto our knowledge of ancient Buddhist architecture in India has been derived mainly from the rock cut examples. These, though most valuable for the purpose, from their number and immutability, have the defect of being all interiors, and we obtain little or no knowledge from them of what the external appearance may have been of the structural buildings which they represent. It is doubtful whether we ever shall know, in so far as the Vih\u00e2ras or monasteries are concerned. These seem, like those of Burmah at the present day, to have been principally constructed of wood, and have perished by fire or decay; but our knowledge of the Topes or Sth\u00fbpas is daily extending, and we may hope soon to understand them and their arrangements with tolerable completeness.\n\nOne of the most valuable contributions towards this end was the publication by General A. Cunningham, in 1854, of his volume on the Bhilsa Topes: these being, so far as is now known, the oldest and most extensive group in India. Next in importance to them are the Topes at Manikyala, combined with those around Jalalabad. Of this group our knowledge is less complete; but those at Jam\u00e2lgiri\u00b9 and Takht i Bashai\u00b2 are certainly anterior to the Christian era, and strongly impregnated with the feelings of Greek, or rather Bactrian, art. The great Tope at Manikyala itself took its present form apparently about the seventh century, and is therefore beyond the limits of our present inquiry.\n\nOf the Magadha Topes, that at Sarnath is now almost the\n\n\u00b9 The sculptures from this place were deposited by Mr. Bayley, of the Bengal Civil Service, in the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, and unfortunately perished in the fire there in December last. Imperfect representations of them will be found in the Journal Asiatic Society Bengal, November, 1852. These are so badly done as to be of little use as a means of comparison, which is to be regretted in this instance, as their similarity to some of those found at Amravati is most striking.\n\n\u00b2 These sculptures are deposited in the Lahore Museum. Photographs of them were kindly furnished to me by Donald Macnabb, Esq., Beng. C. S.\nonly representative, and it is more modern than the last named. Besides this there is one small tower-like fragment in the Giriyek hill, in Behar, but of what age or what form is by no means clear.\n\nThe only other important group in India is that which forms the subject of the present paper. It is found at a place called Amravati, or more correctly Amar\u0101vati, on the river Kistnah, about sixty miles from its mouth. It has only been as yet imperfectly explored, but from what we now know of it, there can be no hesitation in asserting that its sculptured details are more extensive and more interesting than those of any other Buddhist monuments in India, and of a higher class of art than has yet been found anywhere else.\n\nThe principal Tope at this place first attracted the attention of Colonel Mackenzie when on a tour of duty in the district in the year 1797. It seems that some two or three years previous to his visit the Rajah of Chintapilly, attracted by the sanctity of a temple dedicated to \u015aiva, under the title of Amare\u015bvara, determined to erect a city on the spot, and on looking for building materials for his new capital opened this and several other mounds in the neighbourhood, and also utilized the walls of the old city of Durnacotta or Dharanikott\u0101, which stood about half a mile to the westward of the site of the new city. Many of the antiquities perished in the process, and large quantities of the stones were used by the Rajah in building his new temples and palaces, but several sculptured slabs still remained in situ. These attracted the Colonel\u2019s attention so strongly that he subsequently communicated an account of them to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and afterwards returned to the spot in 1816. Being now Surveyor-General of Madras he employed all the means at his disposal during the two following years\n\n---\n\n1 Hence the full-length name of the place is Amare\u015bvarapuram. Anglice, Amesbury.\n\n2 These and many other historical particulars in this paper are gleaned from two letters communicated by Col. Mackenzie to Mr. Buckingham, published by him in the \"Calcutta Journal,\" in March, 1822. They were afterwards reprinted in \"Allen's Asiatic Journal,\" in May, 1823, and as the latter publication is generally accessible while the former is not, all my references to these letters will be taken from it.\n\n3 See Asiatic Researches, vol. ix. p. 272, et seq.\nto the elucidation of the principal temple, which he now styles Dipaldinna, and translates as meaning \"Hill of Lights.\" The result of his labours are careful plans of the building and maps of the surrounding country, together with eighty very carefully finished drawings of the sculptures. These were made by his assistants, Messrs. Hamilton, Newman, and Burke, and are unsurpassed for accuracy and beauty of finish by any drawings of their class that have ever come under my inspection. Three copies were made of all these drawings. One was sent to the Asiatic Society of Calcutta; another was deposited in Madras, and the third sent home to the Court of Directors, in whose library it still remains. Unfortunately no text or description accompanies these drawings; and they have attracted but little attention, probably because of this deficiency, and the consequent extreme difficulty of understanding the form of the monument, or the position of the fragments.\n\nAt the same time, Colonel Mackenzie sent several specimens of the sculptures to the three museums just mentioned, and they have remained their principal ornaments to this day. But, except an attempt to translate two of the inscriptions, which appeared in Prinsep's Journal in 1837,\u00b9 very little notice seems to have been taken of them.\n\nFortunately, however, when Mr., now Sir Walter Elliot, was Commissioner in Guntur, in 1840, he determined to follow up what Colonel Mackenzie had so well begun. He excavated a portion of the monument which had not before been touched, and sent down to Madras a large collection of the sculptures, where they lay exposed to the sun and rain for fourteen years,\u00b2 till they were ultimately sent home to this country about the year 1856. Unfortunately they arrived here in the troublous times of the Indian Mutiny, and just in the interval between the death of the old East India Company and the establishment of the new Indian Council. There was no proper place for their reception, and the greater part of them were consequently stowed away in the coach-\n\n\u00b9 Journal Asiatic Society Bengal, vol. vi. p. 218.\n\u00b2 Selections from the Madras Records, 2nd series, vol. xxxix. p. 195.\nhouse of Fife house, where they remained buried in rubbish, till, accidentally, I heard of their existence in January last. By the zealous co-operation of Dr. Forbes Watson and the officers of his establishment, they were all brought out into the open air and photographed to a scale of one-twelfth the real size, and this was done so exactly that the photographs can be fitted together almost as well as the real stones could be. With these materials I set to work to restore the building; but though I had considerable knowledge of similar buildings, both older and more modern, I should not have succeeded had it not been that among the sculptures themselves there are numerous miniature representations of the building itself and of the different parts, quite sufficiently correctly drawn to be recognized. With all these aids I believe I can now assign the true place and use to at least nine-tenths of the 160 fragments the India Museum possesses, and feel very little doubt of eventually being able to recognize the position of all; but the process is slow and difficult, and requires more time and study than perhaps the value of the additional information now to be obtained would justify.\n\nThe Dipal dinna, or Doop Mogasala\\(^1\\) of Mokunti Maharaja, as it is more popularly called, consists principally of two concentric circular enclosures (Fig. 1). The outermost of these, measuring 195 feet in diameter, consisted of upwards of 100 pillars of octagonal shape, each of one stone, and about nine feet to nine feet six inches in height above ground and three feet in breadth. Over these was a lintel or cornice varying from two feet eight inches to three feet in depth; and below the columns\u2014externally at least\u2014a sculptured basement two feet high, making the total height over fourteen feet.\\(^2\\) It is impossible\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mogasala, in the Telinga language, signifies a court for public affairs, and the distribution of justice. \"Doop,\" is Hindostani for sun, or rather sunshine; translated into architectural language this would be \"Hypethral Basilica.\" This would perhaps be the best term that could be applied to it: but it involves a theory it is as well to avoid at present. See Asiatic Journal, vol. xv. p. 469.\n\n\\(^2\\) As a means of comparison it may be mentioned that the dimensions of the outer circle at Amravati are exactly double those of the outer circle at Stonehenge. The Indian example being 195 feet, the English 97\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The height of the outer rails are nearly the same\u2014the Indian, 14ft. 6in., the English rail is about one foot higher, and of a more megalithic character, but of course infinitely ruder.\nto be very precise, as the stones vary considerably in dimension in different parts of the building. Between each pillar were three intermediate rails, about three feet in height and width, and placed about two inches apart, as shown in the woodcut (Fig. 2) from a representation of it on the monument itself. Externally each pillar was ornamented with\n\none circular lotus rosette in the centre, and a half circle at top and bottom. Between these lotus discs there were occasionally sculptured scenes of devotional objects above, and \"Ga\u1e47a\" or dwarfs below. Each of the rails be-\nbetween the pillars was adorned with a full circular rosette. The upper rail had on it a sculptured frieze representing men bearing a great roll made up apparently of cloth or paper.\\(^1\\) The animal frieze of the basement is as remarkable as anything connected with the monument,\u2014the bulls, elephants, and winged lions being represented with a degree of vigour and of truth seldom or ever seen elsewhere in similar situations in India.\n\nInternally this screen or rail was much more elaborately ornamented than on the outside. All the central medallions\u2014more than two hundred in number\u2014were ornamented with sculpture, each compartment containing from twenty to thirty figures representing some scene from the life of Buddha; some act of devotional ceremony, or some event in local history. The octagonal parts above and below the centre were likewise ornamented with sculpture, each compartment containing from twelve to fifteen figures. The annexed elevation of one of the pillars, apparently from one of the gateways, presents\n\n\\(^1\\) A similar ornament occurs in the Jam\u0101lgiri sculptures, J. A. S. B., vol. xxi. p. 606, and I believe such are still exhibited in Burmah on the occasion of great ceremonials.\na combination of the modes in which the outer and inner surfaces were ornamented. It has, or had, the three lotus discs of the exterior, but this pillar being narrower, they are smaller, and the sculptured decoration between richer than those in similar portions on the inner face. It is a fair specimen of the quasi-classical character of the decoration of the whole monument. The frieze above was one continued succession of scenes similar to those depicted on the pillars, and contained twenty to forty figures to each intercolumniation,\u2014but here intermixed with elephants, horses, and palanquins, besides representations of buildings and other objects of art. Altogether there probably were not less than 100 or 120 figures to each intercolumniation, or upwards of 10,000 to 12,000 figures altogether, exclusive of the gateways, which were also as richly adorned, and equal in extent to one-fourth of the whole external rail.\n\nThe inner rail at Amravati was only about half the internal height of the outer, and 165 feet in diameter; the space between the two being paved with slabs of slate thirteen feet in length. It was solid throughout, and, if possible, more richly ornamented than the outer rail. Its principal ornaments were some forty-eight or fifty representations of Dagobas covered with sculptures and all the ornaments which these monuments possessed in the palmy days of Buddhism. These are particularly interesting, as they are the only pictures now known to exist that enable us to realize what the appearance of these monuments really was as they were originally erected. One of these is reproduced in the woodcut on the following page (Fig 5); and if my calculations are correct, twelve such representations adorned each quadrant of the rail, making forty-\n\n---\n\n1 The original form of the rail will be easily understood from the annexed elevation and section of that at Sanchi (Fig. 4). As will be seen, it consists of plain pillars with a plain architrave above. Between each pillar are three rails similar in section to those at Amravati, but wholly devoid of ornament. This rail is probably anterior to the Christian era. Most of the steps by which this unadorned form passed into the extreme elaboration of Amravati can be easily traced in India.\neight altogether. In this instance the principal figure in front is Buddha seated on the great N\u0101ga snake, with a double snake hood over his head, and the bassi-relievi are scenes from the life of Buddha. On two other Dagobas Buddha is represented as preaching: he has a glory round his head only, without the snake hood, but the people who are listening to him are N\u0101gas. In two more instances, at least, the principal object is the Chakra, or wheel of the law. On others it is the feet of Buddha encircled by the folds of the great snake, or a relic-\ncasket on a throne worshipped by people adorned with the snake hood of seven heads. In one instance, a scene, in which a horse is the principal object, over another circular bas-relief, in which Buddha is represented seated. This is repeated four times; and the sculptures on these four Dagobas are so similar, that, but for the different state of preservation in which they exist, it would be difficult to distinguish the one from the other. These and other indications incline me to believe that each subject was repeated four times. In other words, that there were only twelve different designs or types of the building on the inner rail, one set for each quadrant.\n\nOn each side of the principal subject, the wall of these Dagobas was ornamented with emblematic devices to the height of the rail. From other fragments we learn that these were the Sacred Tree; the Chakra, or wheel emblem; the Dagoba, with the snake in front; and other similar objects, more particularly to be described further on. Above this were two ranges of sculptured bas-reliefs, and over these on the dome were richly sculptured wreaths and architectural details interspersed with medallions containing scenes from the life of Buddha. Combined with the bas-reliefs on the outer rail they make up a wonderful pictorial Bible of Buddhism as it was understood at the time of the erection of the monument.\n\nOne of the peculiarities these Dagobas present, which is new to us, is the existence of five steles on each face, twenty in all, which are found on all these Dagobas. Whether they symbolize the five Dhyani, or the five earthly Buddhas, or the five virtues, or five moral powers, or what, can only be determined by future investigations. Whatever they represent, they are not only curious but very ornamental. All the Dagobas are, of course, surmounted by a Tee and umbrella, and generally ornamented with flags. Ten of these Dagoba slabs, each about four feet in height, are in the Indian Museum, and about as many more are represented in the Mackenzie collection.\n\nBetween the Dagobas of the inner rail were slabs containing various sacred devices, such as the wheel emblem\u2014representations of tree and serpent worship, steles with devotional emblems upon them, and some large figures of women were\ninterspersed here and there. The whole of this inner rail was surmounted by a sculptured frieze about one foot six inches in height, but not less than five hundred feet in length, which is one of the most marvellous repertories of Buddhist legendary history to be found anywhere. The top of the slabs of all the stones forming this frieze is pierced with a number of small circular holes, evidently intended for the insertion of pins to support some crowning ornament of metal. What this was must be left to conjecture. Most probably it was a brazen serpent, or some emblem peculiar to N\u0101ga worship. Such, at least, is the conclusion we arrive at from an examination of the temple at Ongcor in Cambodia, where similar holes exist along the ridge of every roof, apparently to support a great brazen serpent. If it was not a serpent, the most probable conjecture is that it was the \"trisul\" ornament, to be described further on, that these holes were designed to support. From the general character of the ornamentation of the Dagobas, this last would seem the most probable finish if it were of an architectural character. It is possible, however, that the crowning member may have been formed of wood, supported on metal pins. If this were the case its disappearance is only too easily accounted for.\n\nBesides all this, each of the four gateways of the external enclosure was adorned with two or four figures of lions seated, and each more than three feet in height, exclusive of the pedestal, and beyond these were two detached monolithic pillars. As all these have fallen, however, we do not know what they originally carried.\n\nWhen we consider that the outer rail was, with its gateway, at least 700 feet in extent and the inner rail 500 feet, and the whole ornamented to the extent just described, it will probably be admitted that it is one of the most remarkable monuments of human industry as applied to sculptural decorations that is anywhere to be found. The only two monuments now known to exist in India which rival it in this respect are the temples of Halabeed and Ongcor. They are as elaborate, but their sculptures are\nneither of so high a class, nor so interesting as those at Amravati.\\footnote{For particulars of these temples, see \"History of Architecture,\" vol. ii. pp. 612, \\textit{et seq.}, and 713 \\textit{et seq.}. We must not, however, assume that even more magnificent temples may not yet be discovered. Not one of these three temples were known or had been heard of in Europe ten years ago.}\n\nSufficient fragments exist, and have been drawn or brought home, to enable us to speak with certainty with regard to the two outer enclosures; but when we come to ask how the central area was occupied, we at once are met with difficulties and uncertainties. These arise from the fact that the Chintapilly Raja first plundered the Tope of all the loose stones and bricks\\footnote{The bricks measure 20 inches by 10, and 4 inches thick.} that were available for his building purposes.\\footnote{The whole of the inner circle has been dug up, and the stones removed for building purposes. They have been chiefly applied to the repair of Pagodas, and a great many were put to form a flight of steps to the square tank of Shivagunga.\u2014Col. MacKenzie in Asiatic Journal, p. 469.} He then dug down in the centre in search of treasure, and only found a small relic casket, now in the Madras Museum;\\footnote{The following extract from a letter of 12th June last, from Sir Walter Elliot, contains all the information available on this subject:\u2014\"They found in the centre of the mound a stone casket, with a lid, on opening which a crystal box was found, containing a small pearl, some gold leaf, and other things of no value. The Raja sent the relics to his tosha khanah, and there they remained. At a later period I succeeded in securing them for Government, and they are now in the Museum at Madras.\"} but having made a large excavation in this pursuit, he determined to utilize it by forming it into a tank for water. These spoliations and alterations have so completely changed the appearance of the place that no local indications remain to assist in determining its original state. The destruction had been effected before Colonel Mackenzie visited the spot at the end of the last century, and he does not seem at the time to have been aware of the importance of the enquiry. He had at that time no knowledge of the usual form of such buildings, and when he revisited the spot twenty years afterwards the required information was probably not available.\\footnote{In the present state of the mound it is impossible to form any conjecture whether there was any or what sort of building standing in the centre, or for what purpose it was intended.\u2014Asiatic Journal, vol. xv. p. 469.}\n\nThere would, however, be no great \\textit{\u00e0 priori} improbability in the assumption that it was left entirely void. The Dagoba\nis avowedly a copy of a sepulchral tumulus, and a similar analogy would suggest that the Amravati circles might be in like manner copies of the sepulchral circles of which such numbers exist in the neighbourhood. In Colonel Mackenzie's maps they are represented as extremely numerous, both to the eastward and westward of the city. One, thirty-two feet in diameter, is shewn in the annexed woodcut (Fig. 6). Others are smaller (twenty-four feet), but all seem alike in plan and appearance.\n\nUnfortunately there is no history to help us much in our researches. Hiouen Thsang, however, in describing the buildings\\(^1\\) of Dhanakacheka, which seems undoubtedly to have been our Durnakota or Dhara\u1e47ikot\u1e6da, mentions two convents which he calls Sangh\u0101r\u0101mas, or places of assembly, but makes no allusion to relics or Topes or Sth\u016bpas, though so particular in recording their existence wherever else he found them. From this indication I was long inclined to believe that the centre\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Histoire de Hiouen Thsang, translated into French by Stanislas Julien. Paris, 1853. Page 188.\nmight have been occupied by a Chaitya hall\u2014like the Carlee Cave\u2014but being constructed of wood, as was the custom at that time, that it had perished. On looking carefully, however, through the fragments, I recognized certain stones which were found in the central area, which were so different both in size and in style of execution from those belonging to the rails, that they could not possibly have formed any part of the outer enclosures. These, when pieced together, made up a Dagoba about eight or ten times as large as those represented on the inner rail, and I am now convinced that such a Dagoba\u2014say forty or fifty feet in height, and thirty to forty feet in diameter\u2014did really at one time occupy the centre of the area.\n\nOne curious circumstance connected with the central building is that the sculptures belonging to it are inferior both in design and execution to those of the enclosures, so much so as to appear to place some centuries at least between them; but there are some few fragments so good\u2014if they belonged to the central Tope\u2014as to prevent this assertion being made too positively. Either it may be that the whole central Tope is considerably more modern than the enclosure, or that it has been repaired or rebuilt at some subsequent period; or it may possibly be that in ascending the stream of time we have, in the Amravati rails, reached the point when art culminated in India, and before which it was ruder and less perfect. Hitherto we have been accustomed to consider that in India one building was older than another in the ratio in which its sculpture or its art excelled the example with which it was compared; but it may be that in this instance the rule ceases to hold good, and that before the time when they were erected ruder and less perfect forms prevailed. If this be so, the central building may be as old as the Christian era, or older. The rails may have been added subsequently.\n\nA careful examination of the remains on the spot can alone determine these questions now. No record of either Colonel Mackenzie's or Sir W. Elliot's excavation having been preserved, it is extremely difficult to recognise the position of the fragments; and, fortunately for our present purpose, it is not\nvery important. The circular enclosures must always have been the most important parts of the monument. Their arrangement is easily understood, and a sufficient number of fragments exist to enable us to restore them with certainty.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThe Amravati Tope is so important a monument, whether we regard it with reference to its architectural forms, or the light it throws on the religious faith of India at the time of the erection, that it is extremely desirable its history should be ascertained and its date fixed if it is possible to do so. My impression is that this can be done with very fair approximate certainty.\n\nThere seems no difficulty with regard to a final date before which it must have been erected. When Hiouen Thsang visited Dhanakacheka in 645, he describes the principal monument in the following terms, which I quote at length because of the many interesting points the description contains: \"Un ancien roi de ce royaume l'avait construit en l'honneur du Bouddha et y avait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 toute la magnificence des palais de Tahia\u2014(de la Bactriane). Les bois touffus dont il \u00e9tait entour\u00e9 et une multitude des fontaines jaillissantes en faisaient un s\u00e9jour enchanteur. Ce couvent \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par les esprits du ciel, et les sages et les saints aimaient \u00e0 s'y promener et \u00e0 y habiter. Pendant l'espace des mille ans qui ont suivi le Nirv\u00e2na du Bouddha on voyait constamment un millier de la\u00efques et de religieux qui venaient ensemble y passer le temps de la retraite pendant la saison des pluies.\u2014Mille ans apr\u00e8s (le \"Nirv\u00e2na\"), les hommes du si\u00e8cle et les sages vinrent y demeurer ensemble. Mais depuis une centaine d'ann\u00e9es les esprits des montagnes ont chang\u00e9 de sentiments et font \u00e9clater sans cesse leur violence et leur col\u00e8re. Les voyageurs justement effray\u00e9s n'osent plus aller dans ce couvent. C'est pour cela qu'aujourd'hui, il est compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sert et l'on n'y voit plus ni religieux ni novices.\"\n\n1 Histoire de Hiouen Thsang, p. 188. No reliance can be placed on the date of 1000 years twice repeated in this passage. The author is evidently speaking in round numbers, and we do not know when he placed the Nirvana. According to the Ceylonese epochs it would bring it to 457 A.D.\nFrom this it seems evident that about the middle of the sixth century Buddhism had suffered such a blow as to prevent any such work being undertaken. Even if it is contended that Dhanakacheka may not be Dharanikotta, the facts remain the same. From what our author says of Kalinga on the one hand and Djourya\\(^1\\) on the other, it is evident that, in the century before his visit, war, pestilence, and famine had swept over the three Kalingas, and nearly obliterated the original population. We know, too, that in Orissa the Ke\u1e63ari family, worshippers of \u015aiva, had raised themselves before that time (A.D. 473) on the ruins of the Buddhist dynasty;\\(^2\\) and we also know that in the year 605 the Ch\u0101lukyas conquered Venga,\\(^3\\) the country in which Dhara\u1e47ikott\u0101 was situated, and they were neither Buddhists nor snake worshippers. We may therefore fairly assume that it was some time before the middle of the sixth century at all events that the Tope was erected.\n\nAt the other end of our history we find that Col. Mackenzie collected a considerable number of coins about Durnacota. Some of these were Roman, others of the Bactrian Kadphises type,\\(^4\\) showing that the place was probably of some importance about the Christian era; but as none of these were found in the Tope itself they have no direct bearing on our investigation. Those coins which were found in the Tope were all of lead, but none of them having been drawn or published they at present afford us no assistance in our enquiry.\\(^5\\)\n\nColonel Mackenzie also collected a number of traditions referring to a Mokunti Maharaja who, among the Hindus on the spot, is the reputed builder of the Tope.\\(^6\\) On examination, however, these are found to refer either to Rudra Deva of Warangal (A.D. 1132), or more probably to Prat\u0101pa Rudra of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Histoire de Hiouen Thsang, p. 185 and 189, and Memoires, vol. ii. p. 116.\n\n\\(^2\\) Stirling's Account of Cuttack, Asiatic Researches, vol. xv. p. 264.\n\n\\(^3\\) Journal R.

Like most Puranic traditions they are foolish and fabulous in the extreme, and refer to a persecution, when the last feeble remnants of the Buddhas, here called Jainas, were finally expelled from India. It is curious to find Buddhists in India as late as the beginning of the sixteenth century, but that has no reference to our present enquiry.\n\nTurning to the monument itself, we find upon it a great number of inscriptions, and my friend General Cunningham has kindly undertaken to investigate this branch of the subject, and will no doubt give the result of his labours to the society. Unfortunately, however, no date has yet been found among them, nor any name which can be identified with any known historical personage whose epoch is known. They merely record that the pillar, or bas-relief, or object in which they are found, is the gift of some piously-disposed person whose name is given; but these names are, unluckily for our purpose, all unknown to fame. At present, therefore, it is only from the form of the characters that the inscriptions aid in ascertaining the date of the monument. Generally this may be described as the Gupta alphabet, as used either before or after A.D. 319. No trace of the L\u00e2t character occurs, though that was used at Sanchi on the northern limits of the province certainly after the Christian era.\u00b9 The inscriptions in which the form of the letters most closely resembles that found at Amravati are those of the Kenheri and Nasick Caves. If Dr. Stevenson\u00b2 is right in ascribing these to the first half of the fourth century, and I see no reason to doubt his correctness in this respect, this evidence, \"valeat quantum,\" would assign to the Amravati Tope the same epoch.\n\nAt a more modern age it might be possible, by a comparison with buildings of known date, to approximate very nearly to the time when the monument must have been erected. In the early ages however, to which it certainly belongs, the examples are few and far between, and those that do exist have not been examined with the care necessary for the purpose of comparison. There is, however, so much of Greek or\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, Bhilsa Topes, p. 264. \u00b2 J.B.B. R.A.S., vol. v. p. 39, et seq.\nrather Bactrian art in the architectural details of the Amravati Tope that the first inference is that it must be nearer to the Christian era than the form of the inscriptions would lead us to suppose. On the other hand we do not know how long the classical influence prevailed, and how much it may have been nourished by intercommunication with the West. Down to the time of Constantine, Rome seems to have maintained its intercourse with India, and we must pause before we draw a line as to the time when classical feeling may have ceased to exert an influence on Indian art. Certainly, in this instance, the expression of Hiouen Thsang, that this Tope was ornamented with all the art of the palaces of Bactria, is borne out to the fullest extent; but there seems no reason to suppose that this classical influence may not have endured till the break down of the Roman Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries, though it could hardly have lasted beyond that time.\n\nThe one point which it seems necessary to insist upon at this stage of the inquiry is the strong Bactrian influence which is manifested in all the details of the monument. As will be afterwards explained, the sculptures, with scarcely an exception, refer to a N\u00e2ga people and to a N\u00e2ga worship; and as Taxila and Cashmeer were the head quarters of that faith, at this age,\\(^1\\) that circumstance alone would almost suffice to point out the north-west as the source from which we must expect information regarding its origin. But, again, how long did the Bactro-Parthian kingdom exist? and how long did it continue to influence the politics and arts of India proper? These are questions to which no very definite answer can be given in the present state of our knowledge; my own impression is that the influence continued to a much later date than has hitherto generally been supposed; but there is nothing in all this sufficiently definite to enable us to found on it any argument as to the date of the Amravati Tope.\n\nAlthough, therefore, neither these classical influences nor\n\n\\(^1\\) To prevent repetition, I must refer the reader to my \"History of Architecture,\" vol. ii. book vi. for the traditions of N\u00e2ga worship and N\u00e2ga art in Northern India and Cambodia. Unfortunately I knew nothing of Amravati when it was written, or I could have made that chapter much more complete than it is.\nthe Mackenzie traditions seem to throw much light on our subject, the information collected by Mr. Stirling, and published in his invaluable history of Cuttack, does seem to bear on its origin.\n\nThe following extracts from his memoirs\\(^1\\) are those which seem most to the point:\u2014\"In the reign of Bajra Nath Deo the Yavanas are said to invade the country in great numbers from Babul Des\u2014explained to mean Iran and Cabul\u2014but are finally driven back.\" \"In the reign of Huns or Hangsha Deo (query, Huska) the Yavanas again invade in great force from Cashmeer, and many bloody battles ensue.\" In the reign of Bhoja, the Yavanas from Sindhu Des invade the country in great force, but are driven back. Then follows Vikram\u0101ditya. If, therefore, the dates are to be depended upon, these invasions took place before the Christian era. Other Yavana invasions occur in the next four reigns; but the most important of all occurred in the reign of Subhan Deo, who ascended the throne 318 (one year before the Ballabhi era). In the ninth year of his reign a Yavana, Rakta B\u0101hu invades the country by sea, and conquers it. The king escapes with the image of Juggernath, which he buries under a ber tree, and flies farther into the jungle, where he dies. His son succeeds to the title, but is murdered by the invaders. \"A Yavana dynasty then ruled over Orissa for a space of 146 years, or down to A.D. 473.\"\n\nThis account, being derived from Brahmanical sources, would hardly help us much; but, fortunately, we have two Buddhist accounts of the same transaction, which are much more complete and detailed, and which do, I fancy, throw great light on our researches. The first is contained in the Dalad\u0101 Wanso, partially translated by the Hon. G. Turnour, and published in the J.A.S.B. vol. vi. p. 856, et seq.; the other is abstracted by Col. Low from the Siamese Phr\u0101 Pat\u2019hom, and published in the same journal, vol. xvii. part ii. p. 82, et seq. Unfortunately, neither work has been completely translated, and the extracts having been made with reference to other objects, do not give us all the information we want. The\n\n\\(^1\\) Asiatic Researches, vol. xv. p. 254, et seq. J.A.S.B. vol. vi. p. 756, et seq.\nfollowing abridgment of the story will however suffice for present purposes:\n\nThe left canine tooth of Buddha had been preserved in Dantapura, the capital of Kalinga, probably at or near Udayagiri, for 800 years, when G\u00fbhas\u00eewo, the king, early in the fourth century, was converted to Buddhism from the Brahmanical faith, which he had professed up to that time. With the zeal of a convert he dismissed and persecuted the Brahmans, who had hitherto enjoyed his favour. They repaired to P\u00e2t\u00e2l\u00eeputta (Patna) to complain of this to the paramount sovereign, here called P\u00e2ndu, but who, as it appears from the context, most probably was the Gautama Putra of the Satkarn\u00ee dynasty. He orders G\u00fbhas\u00eewo to repair to his court, bringing the relic with him. It is then subjected to every sort of trial. It is smashed on an anvil, thrown into the gutter, and everything conceivable done to destroy or dishonour it. It comes triumphantly out of all its trials. The king is converted, and finally devotes himself to a religious life.\n\nWhile all this is going on, a northern King\u2014it is not quite clear whence he came\u2014named Kh\u00eer\u00e2dh\u00e2ro, attacks the capital, in order to possess himself of the wonder-working relic. He was defeated and killed in battle, and G\u00fbhas\u00eewo returned, it is said, with the sacred tooth to his capital. Some time afterwards the nephews of Kh\u00eer\u00e2dh\u00e2ro, allying themselves with other kings, march against G\u00fbhas\u00eewo. He, though seeing that resistance is hopeless, prepares for defence; but, before going to the combat, he enjoins on his daughter Hemachal\u00e2, who was married to a prince of Oujein, called Danta Kum\u00e2ra, that in the event of his falling, they should take the relic, and escaping by sea, convey it to Mah\u00e2sena, king of Ceylon, who had been for some time negotiating for its purchase.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Some years ago Dr. Bird opened a small tope in front of the Kanheri Caves in Salsette. In it he found a copper plate recording that a canine tooth of Buddha had been deposited there. The plate is dated in the year 245. From the expression \"Samvat\" being used, Dr. Stevenson (J. B. B. R. A. S., vol. v. p. 13,) assumes that it must be from the era of Vikramaditya. I believe, however, it is correct to assert that no Buddhist inscription is dated from the era of the hated opponent of their religion. If on the other hand we assume the era of Salivahana it brings the date to almost the exact time\u2014A.D. 324\u2014of these events on the east coast; and though it is not directly stated in the inscription, it seems that the tooth was deposited there by Gotami-putra, the very king who played\nThe prince and princess fly from the city before its fall, bury the relic in the sand, in the same manner as the image of Juggernath is said to have been concealed in the Brahmanical account, and, afterwards returning, the princess conceals it in her hair, and escaping to the coast, they take ship apparently at Tamralipi or Tamlook, and sail for Ceylon. Half-way between the place of embarkation and Ceylon they are shipwrecked, at a place called the Diamond Sands.\u00b9 From the context I do not think there can be much hesitation in fixing this locality on the banks of the Kistnah. First, from its position half-way;\u00b2 next because here only, so far as I know, are those diamond\u00b3 mines near the coast; but more because it was the residence of the N\u00e2ga R\u00e2ja.\n\nThe N\u00e2ga R\u00e2ja steals the relic from the princess, when she is asleep. He is forced by the power of a Thero, from the Himalaya, to restore it, and the wanderers again embark, and after various adventures, reach Ceylon in the year 312.\u2074\n\nso important a part in the narrative just recorded, and what is more, it seems extremely probable that the Kanheri tooth was, or was supposed to be, the identical one which performed so many miracles in P\u00e2taliputta.\n\nThis might seem paradoxical had not the same thing happened to the same relic in similar circumstances, more than twelve centuries afterwards. When the Portuguese conquered Ceylon, Constantine de Braganza seized the Dalad\u00e2 and conveyed it to Goa. The king of Pegu sent an embassy after it, and offered any amount of ransom for it. But the bigotry of the priesthood was proof against any such temptation. The tooth was consumed by fire in presence of the Archbishop and all the notables, and the ashes cast into the sea. The result was peculiar. The Ceylonese pretended that the one so destroyed was a counterfeit. A true one was discovered and sold to the king of Pegu, and as soon as he was gone and had paid for it, another true one was found concealed in Ceylon, and is probably the crocodile's tooth that is now so honoured in that country. To complete the parallelism, both the Burmese and the Concani teeth have disappeared, and only their empty chaityas remain. The Ceylonese tooth still remains with the oldest pedigree of any such relic that the world possesses.\n\nThe particulars of this second great attempt to destroy the Dalad\u00e2 will be found well stated in Sir E. Tennent's Ceylon, vol. ii. p. 199. Translations of the original authorities are there given also.\n\n\u00b9 Dinne means sand bank in Telugu. This may be the origin of the name D\u00eepal dinne, which certainly does not mean \"Hill of Lights.\" Can D\u00eepal, by any synonym, be assumed to mean diamond?\n\n\u00b2 The Siamese, as Colonel Low points out, wishing to make their own country the scene of these events, have lengthened the periods of the voyage preposterously. They make it three months from Cuttaek to the Diamond Sands, and three more from thence to Ceylon. J.A.S.B., vol. xvii., pages 86 and 87.\n\n\u00b3 One of the objects of Col. Mackenzie's surveys was to mark the Diamond mines in the locality. He plots the diamond district as extending to about eight miles north of Amravati, but it seems there are no mines elsewhere.\n\n\u2074 It does not seem quite clear how far the Ceylonese dates are to be relied upon as quite correct about this time. Avowedly there is an error to the extent of at least 60 years in the date their annals assign to Asoka. This has subsequently\nMah\u0101sena had been dead nine years, but the fugitives are received with open arms by Meghavarna,\\(^1\\) the reigning sovereign; a brick and mortar Chaitya is made, and the relic brought by the prince and princess enshrined with great solemnity (Col. Low, p. 86).\n\nThe narrative then proceeds:\u2014\u201cThree years had passed away, when the king of Lanka perceived from an ancient prophecy, that in seven years from that date, a certain king Dhammasoka Raja would erect a temple on the Diamond Sands; and he likewise recollected that there were two Donas of relics of Buddha still concealed in the country of N\u0101ga R\u0101ja. He therefore directed a holy person to go and bring these relics.\u201d The N\u0101ga R\u0101ja\u2019s brother swallows the relics, and flies to Meru, but they are taken from him and brought back. \u201cSoon after this N\u0101ga R\u0101ja arrived, in the form of a handsome youth, and solicited a few relics from his majesty, which were bestowed upon him accordingly.\u201d\n\nHis majesty now ordered a golden ship to be made. It was one cubit long, and one span broad. The relics were put into a golden cup; this was placed in a vase, and the whole put into the golden ship. A wooden ship was next built, having a breadth of beam of seven long cubits.\n\nDanta Kum\u0101ra and Hemachal\u0101 being desirous of revisiting their country, the king of Lank\u0101 sent with them ambassadors to one of the five\\(^2\\) kings who now ruled there, requesting him to show them every attention. The vessel reached the Diamond Sands in five months, and the prince and princess went on shore accompanied by the priests. An account is then given of the building of the temple, and the mode in which the relics were placed. The vessel now set sail for Dantapura, which it reached in little more than three months. The ambassadors of the king of Lank\u0101 landed with the prince and princess. They were treated with much distinction, and remained in the country.\n\nbeen adjusted, to some extent, by Mr. Turnour, but not, so far as I can judge, in such a manner as to inspire entire confidence. My impression is that the dates in the fourth century are all from ten to fifteen years too early.\n\n\\(^1\\) Is not this the Varaja of the Western-cave Inscrip., J.B.B. R.A.S., vol. v. p.42?\n\n\\(^2\\) Those who, according to the Dalad\u0101wanso, had combined with the nephews of Kh\u012br\u0101dh\u0101ro and conquered the country.\nAfter this follows a third tradition of a king, like the last-named, Dhammasoka\\(^1\\) who ruled the country of Arvadi, apparently Avanti (Ougein) with strict justice, but is forced by a famine to emigrate with his followers, amounting to 31,000 able-bodied men. The wanderers proceeded southward for seven months. After various adventures they reach a place where water and fish were abundant. Next day the king mounted his horse and reached the Diamond Sands. Here he meets the N\u00e2ga R\u00e2ja, builds a Chaitya, and founds a city.\n\n\"Dhammasoka reigned here quietly for seven years, but mortified and unhappy because he could not reach the relics. His Majesty accordingly offered a high reward to any one who should find the relics and disinhume them. But this proved of no avail. It so happened that, in the dilemma, a Putra of the king of Rom or Roum, named K\u00e2kabh\u00e2sa, who happened to be trading to the country of Takkasila, encountered a violent storm. He had 500 souls on board, who, supplicating the gods, were rescued from death. The ship, with much difficulty, reached close to the Diamond Sands, and observing signs of population cast anchor with a view to refit.\"\n\nThe Prince of Rom\\(^2\\) assists the N\u00e2ga R\u00e2ja to recover the hidden treasure, and to build a wonderful nine-storied Chaitya over it, many particulars of which are given; but as they are too long to extract, and either are imaginary or do not refer to the particular building we are engaged upon, it is hardly necessary to quote them here. These quotations might be multiplied to almost any extent; but enough has probably\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is evidently a title, though from the similarity of the name Col. Low confounds him with the great Asoka, and places him 321 B.C.\n\n\\(^2\\) It would be absurd to found any serious theory on the mention of the name of Rome, if it stood alone and unsupported. The circumstance mentioned in the narrative of the strangers being white men, and coming by sea, is a small confirmation that the people here mentioned were really Europeans. My impression, however, is that few who are familiar with the arts of Rome in Constantine's time, and who will take the trouble to master these Amravati sculptures, can fail to perceive many points of affinity between them. The circular medallions of the arch of Constantine\u2014such as belong to his time\u2014and the general tone of the art of his age so closely resemble what we find here that the coincidence can hardly be accidental. The conviction that the study of these sculptures has forced in my mind is that there was much more intercommunication between the east and the west during the period from Alexander to Justinian than is generally supposed, and that the intercourse was especially frequent and influential in the middle period, between Augustus and Constantine.\nbeen adduced to show that, in the beginning of the fourth century\u2014about the time when the struggle for the tooth relic was convulsing all India\u2014Buddhist tradition points most distinctly to the Diamond Sands, on the banks of the Kistnah, as the place where a great temple was being built. The kingdom of the N\u00e2ga R\u00e2ja certainly was there; and so far as can be judged from every indication as to the locality, if it was not at or near Amravati, it could not possibly have been far from the spot.\n\nThough all this tends to confirm the idea that the building referred to is the Amravati Tope, the inference rises almost to certainty when we come to examine the sculptures with which it is adorned. In one bas-relief a ship is represented with two persons on board, bearing relics, and is being welcomed by a N\u00e2ga king on approaching the shore. In another an ark, in the form of a ship, like that described above, is being borne in state on men's shoulders; and in numerous scenes there are conferences between the N\u00e2ga king and a prince or king accompanied by a lady, neither of whom nor any of whose suite are N\u00e2gas. Of course these scenes may represent other similar scenes which have happened to other people; but a careful examination of the whole presents so many points of coincidence that I hardly think they can be accidental. One point which the sculptures undoubtedly reveal is that Amravati was the capital, or, at least, residence of the N\u00e2ga R\u00e2ja. In all the sculptures which do not relate to the life of Buddha, and in many of these, the N\u00e2ga king appears with his hood of a seven-headed snake, and all his women have also single snakes at the back of their heads. As will be presently shown, N\u00e2ga worship almost supersedes Buddhism in the religious representations, so much so, indeed, that it is sometimes difficult to say to which religion the temple is dedicated.\n\nIt may be quite true that no single part of this evidence is sufficient to prove the case, but, taking the whole of it together, I think it must be admitted to be sufficient to justify the conclusion that the outer rails, at least, are part of the Temple at the Diamond Sands, which, according to the Ceylonese com-\nputation, was commenced in the year 322. Judging from its elaboration, it may have taken fifty years to complete. If this be so the date of the completion may be about the year 370 or 380 of our era, and it may have remained complete for 150 or 200 years after that time, before it was deserted, as mentioned by Hiouen Thsang. That it was afterwards repaired and used for Buddhist purposes as late as the twelfth or thirteenth centuries seems also clear;\u00b9 but the particulars of this restoration are less interesting, and further explorations on the spot are necessary before they can be made intelligible.\n\nSCULPTURES.\n\nAlthough extremely remarkable from an artistic point of view, perhaps the most interesting peculiarity of the Amravati Tope is the picture the sculptures afford of the religious faith and the manners and customs of the inhabitants of Mah\u00e2 Andhra\u00b2 in the beginning of the fourth century. In this respect they are fuller and more complete than the sculptures of the gateways at Sanchi or than the frescoes of the Caves at Ajunta, and occupy an intermediate position between the two, being, apparently, about three centuries more modern than the first, and as many centuries older than the latter.\n\nThe main theme of the sculptures is of course Buddhist, and the subjects of most of them are easily recognised by any one familiar with the fables of the Lalita Vistara. The subject most often represented is M\u00e2y\u00e2\u2019s dream and the white elephant.\n\n\u00b9 It is to be regretted that the Dalad\u00e2wanso has not been completely translated, for it appears that in the twelfth or thirteenth century, the tooth relic was taken back to India at a time apparently, when (1187) a Kirti Nissanga, a prince of Kalinga, was one of the many Indian princes who held sway in Ceylon. It is said to have been conveyed to the banks of the Ganges (Upham\u2019s History of Buddhism, p. 32), but as Landresse suggests (Fo\u00eb Kou\u00eb Ki, p. 345) this more probably was the Godavery, or, in other words, the Kistnah. From some particulars furnished me by Sir Walter Elliot it seems that the part of the monument he dug into was a chapel formed of old slabs arranged unsymmetrically by some prince about that time, so as to form a chapel for some unexplained purpose. It may have been to receive this relic.\n\nThe inscription translated by Prinsep (J. A. S. B. vol. vi. p. 218) shows that Buddhism was flourishing at Amravati in\u2014say the twelfth century. Altogether nothing would surprise me less than to find that the tooth relic sojourned here for seventy-six years before its recovery by the Ceylonese, about 1314 of our era. The materials exist for settling this question, but they have not yet been made available.\n\n\u00b2 Histoire de Hioen Thsang, p. 187. M\u00e9moires, vol. ii. pp. 105 and 395.\ndescending to her; her asking permission of her husband Suddhodana to visit her father when she felt the term of her pregnancy approaching; the birth of Buddha as she stood holding the branches of a tree in the Loumbin\u00ee garden; the reception of the infant by Indra, etc.\u00b9 In some of the sculptures the prince Siddh\u00e2rtha is represented riding out in state and enjoying the pleasures of his rank before he forsook the palace to become an ascetic. In others he is represented as preaching and teaching: he seldom appears seated or in the usual cross-legged position in which he is usually represented when an object of adoration. In one or two instances he does appear in this attitude at Amravati, but then he is always seated on the coils of the great snake N\u00e2ga, and with the snake-hood of seven or fourteen heads as a canopy over him (Fig. 5). The most remarkable peculiarity of these sculptures, indeed, is that the N\u00e2ga is of equal if not of greater importance in them than Buddha himself. In the fragments or representations that have reached this country the five-headed N\u00e2ga occurs oftener in the place of honour on the Dagoba than Buddha; this may be accidental, but certainly the N\u00e2ga king, with his seven-headed hood, and N\u00e2ga people, are more important in the sculptures than the other kings or people who have not this strange accompaniment.\n\nAny one familiar with Buddhist literature, especially after the time of N\u00e2g\u00e2rjuna, who lived about the Christian era, knows how constantly the doings of the N\u00e2ga king are mentioned, and how important a part the N\u00e2gas or N\u00e2ga people play in all Buddhist tradition. Hitherto, however, nothing could well be more vague than the idea attached to these people, or the place of their residence, or who and what they were. For the first time we meet them face to face\u2014\u201cpeints par eux-m\u00eames\u201d\u2014in the sculptures at Amravati; and when these are properly investigated they will probably throw more light on these hitherto mysterious people than anything\n\n\u00b9 The most succinct account of these events is found in Asiatic Researches, vol. ii. p. 383, et seq. On all these occasions, whenever a cloth is represented, it is stamped with the feet of Buddha, sometimes one pair only, at others several. It will be recollected that cloths stamped with feet were the cause of a war between Cashmeer and Ceylon, about 150 years before this time.\u2014Asiatic Researches, vol. xv. p. 27.\nthat has yet been brought to light.\\(^1\\) A good deal may also be learned no doubt from the N\u0101ga temples of Cambodia, but it has not yet been ascertained how far their builders were, strictly speaking, of Indian race, or to what extent they may have been a native population converted to an Indian form of faith.\n\nAfter Buddha and the N\u0101gas, the Dagoba itself may perhaps be marked as next in importance as an object of worship. It is represented in every form and of every conceivable variety of elaboration, and generally as an object to be adored even when quite plain, so that the worship cannot be said to be addressed to the sculptures or ornaments upon it. Generally it only is employed as a symbol, like the cross of the Christians, to recall the memory of the relic shrine, to which the Buddhists in all ages attached such supreme importance.\n\nNext in importance, perhaps even more so than the last, is the Chakra, or wheel. It occurs everywhere and with every possible degree of elaboration, but is always honoured and generally placed above the other emblems. It occurs also in the place of honour on the gateways at Sanchi.\\(^2\\) It probably is the \"Wheel of the Law,\" enumerated as one of the seven precious things necessary for a Chakravart\u012b king, so described in detail in the Lalita Vistara.\\(^3\\) As before mentioned it occurs occasionally in the place of honour on the front of the Dagoba; but, in fact, it appears everywhere and in almost every conceivable conjunction, and always as an object of worship, or at least of benediction. From the frequency of its recurrence and the honour in which it is held, as well as its representing the Wheel of the Law, I would suggest that it is the symbol of Dharma.\n\n\\(^1\\) At Badamce, about 300 miles due west of Amravati, there exists a series of caves of more modern date. They may be the ninth or tenth century, but I have not the materials necessary to enable me to speak positively on the point. They belong to the Brahmanical religion, with a slight admixture of Jainism; but throughout them N\u0101ga people with the N\u0101ga hood appear everywhere. Three hundred miles north of Badamce, in the sculptures at Ajunta (not in the paintings), the same thing appears, and my impression is that the N\u0101gas will be found everywhere when the triangular section of the country, of which these three places mark the angles, comes to be examined.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bhilsa Topes, by Gen. Cunningham, p. 351, pl. xxxi. Gen. Cunningham considers it an emblem of Buddha. I am sorry to differ from him, but I can find no authority for this interpretation. My impression is that the Amravati sculptures quite contradict it.\n\n\\(^3\\) Lalita Vistara. Paris, 1847, p. 14, et seq.\nNearly coequal in importance with this is the Bo-tree. It probably occurs more frequently than the Chakra, but not quite so prominently; but both here and at Sanchi it is one of the principal objects of adoration. We have been so long familiar with the Tree worship of the Buddhists that there seems nothing surprising in this. It has long been known that each of the three preceding Buddhas had a special Bo-tree; and it is generally admitted that the great Tree at Buddh Gya in Behar was reverenced as the Bo-tree of the present Buddha before the time of Asoka, B.C. 250. The Mah\u00e2wanso has made us familiar with the importance that was attached to the transport of a cutting of that tree to Ceylon in the middle of the third century B.C., and we all know that it\u2014or its lineal descendant\u2014is still reverenced at Anar\u00e2dhapura, and has been worshipped on that spot for the last twenty-two centuries, at least. Once, at least, the Tree occurs in front of the Dagoba in the place of honour; but generally speaking, though as frequently represented, it seems to take a lower rank than either the Dagoba or the Chakra.\n\nThese four combined, in the manner shewn in the annexed woodcut (Fig. 7), may be considered as the shorter confession of Amravati faith. The Serpent, the Dagoba, the Tree, and the Wheel, combined together in different manners and with different degrees of importance, make up by far the greatest part of the emblematic decoration of the Tope.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The following is a curious instance of the irradicability of local forms, even\nNext, after these, are either one, or more frequently two, objects like cushions, which are very frequently represented as placed on a throne, and always as objects of worship. I am not aware of any such objects occurring anywhere else in any paintings or sculptures in India, and the only reasonable conjecture that occurs to me is that they contain relics. Are they the two Dona of relics mentioned in the previous narrative?\n\nBelow the throne in which these objects are placed are impressions of Buddha\u2019s feet. These are very frequently represented in the sculptures, sometimes with great elaboration, and adorned as in the annexed woodcut (Fig. 8), with the Chakra, the Trisul, the Swastika, and other emblems familiar to Buddhist hierogrammy.\n\nOnce, at least, the feet occur in the front of the Dagoba, resting on the folds of the sacred snake which surround them; but more frequently they appear on the upper part of the Dagoba, and then surmounted by the umbrella of state. Wherever they appear, however, both here and at Sanchi, they seem always to have been objects of special adoration and reverence.\n\nAll these will be found combined in the woodcut (Fig. 9),\n\nlong after the religion to which they belonged may have perished. During the festival of Navar\u00e2tri, in honour of Siva as Amreshwar, the immortal lord, on the third night a brazen tree is carried round the town in procession; on the fifth night a ten-headed serpent in brass. At the close of the festival the worshippers go in great pomp to a tree called Shemmu Veerchum, where the god is made to exercise in shooting an arrow at the sacred tree, followed by a discharge of fire arms in the air, which closes the ceremony. In the festival called Siva Mah\u00e2r\u00e2tri, the procession to the same tree is the culminating point, to which all previous arrangements are subordinate, and thus the festival closes.\u2014See Asiatic Journal, vol. xv. p. 472 and 473.\nrepresenting one of the slabs of the inner rail, and may be called the longer confession of Amravati. At the bottom are the feet, above these the relics on the throne. The tree is above these, then the Chakra, and above all the Dagoba with its rail, and the N\u0101ga with his five heads in the place of honour.\n\nThere is still one emblem (Fig. 10) that very frequently occurs, both here and at Sanchi, and is found on coins and at the beginning of inscriptions, but the meaning of which still remains to be explained.\\(^1\\) At Amravati it is generally used as an architectural ornament,\u2014most frequently as the crowning member of the decoration of the perpendicular part of the Dagoba, where it is repeated in each sculptured representation twenty or thirty times. In these instances, however, it is certainly an architectural decoration and not an object of worship. It hardly ever occurs in combination with the great emblems above enumerated, except on the\n\n\\(^1\\) General Cunningham, in his work on the Bhilsa Topes, considers it the emblem of Dharma, p. 58, pl. xxxii.\nsoles of the feet of Buddha, as in Figure 8, and never occurs as an object of adoration except in such a combination as to make it doubtful whether it is really the object of worship or only an accessory. In many instances it occurs as in Fig. 8, as an ornament to the periphery of the Chakra, but when so used is evidently very subordinate. The instances in which it seems most prominent are like that represented in the accompanying woodcut (Fig. 11). Here the altar has nothing upon it, which is unusual; and the feet, which always accompany the symbol when used in this form, are very subordinate. Then the pillar and the flame or tree which accompany it may be important. On the whole I\nshould be inclined to fancy it was a monogram or symbol of Buddha; but I dare not affirm this, and prefer being content at present in calling it the Trisul ornament, feeling very little doubt that it is the original of \u015aiva's emblem.\\(^1\\) Till some ancient P\u0101li work is discovered, in which these various symbols are figured and their meaning explained, it will be impossible to feel quite certain that we know what their meaning really was, and it must be comparatively useless to speculate when so little exists to guide the enquirer. The emblems, however, are so frequently repeated at Amravati, and their relative importance so clearly defined there, that I cannot help thinking that it will be found that the tree with its myriad leaves is there used as the emblem of Sangha or the congregation; that the Chakra or wheel is the emblem of Dharma or the law; and that the Trisul is the monogram of Buddha, and, when combined with the feet, his emblem.\n\nThe meaning of the Dagoba is not doubtful; it either represented a relic shrine, or a Sth\u016bpa, to mark a sacred spot, in either of which capacities it always was the principal object of Buddhist adoration. It is not clear whether any such objects existed in India before Asoka's time, or B.C. 250; but from shortly after this period to the present day the series is complete and uninterrupted.\n\nAnother peculiarity of these sculptures which is worth remarking, is the continual presence of a horse,\u2014not as a beast of burthen, but as an animal to be reverenced if not worshipped. Sometimes he is represented as issuing from a portal with an umbrella of state borne over his head; at others he occupies the place of honour in front of the Dagoba; and he is introduced as an actor or spectator in many of the groups. The first impression is that this may have reference to some Aswamedha, or horse-sacrifice, performed by some Chakravarti king, who may have been the builder or a benefactor to the sanctuary; but, on the whole, it seems more\n\n\\(^1\\) Is it not the original of the symbol of the planet Mercury? Buddha, Mercury, and Woden gave their names to the middle day of the week, and astronomically the same sign might serve for the three.\nprobable that it is a remnant of the Scythian faith of this people before they migrated into India.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhen properly investigated it is probable that the Amravati sculptures will prove as interesting from the light they throw on the ethnography, and the manners and customs of the people of India in the fourth century, as from any other circumstance. Originally they were painted,\\(^2\\) and, had the colour remained, it would have been easy to distinguish the different races, but this having, in all instances, been washed off, its having originally been relied upon is rather against their identification now.\n\nAs it is, there seems no great difficulty in discriminating, at least, three races of people who are represented in these sculptures. First, the N\u00e2gas; easily distinguishable by their emblems. Next, a race who, from the mode of dressing their hair, and the enormous bangles their women wear, closely resemble the J\u00e2ts, or the people we now know as Brinjarees. The third may be either Gonds or some cognate Tamil race. All this, however, can only be determined by some one who is familiar with the distinctive features of the people now inhabiting the spot; but I have little doubt that anyone residing there could point out without difficulty which people were intended in every instance.\n\nThe costume of the people represented in these sculptures hardly helps us much in this enquiry, for, generally, neither men nor women wear clothes in the sense in which we understand the term. A narrow belt round the waist, with a knot in front, and a necklace and a pair of anklets, compose the costume of the women.\\(^3\\) The men sometimes wear a dhoti, but rarely.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In some papers by the Rev. Mr. Hislop, Missionary at Nagpore, edited by Sir R. Temple, he describes the religion of the Gonds in the following ten words: \"Religion\u2014All introduce figures of the horse in their worship.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) Asiatic Journal, vol. xv., p. 468.\n\n\\(^3\\) \"On the east of the Chanda district (the Gond district nearest Amravati) the men wear no covering for their heads or the upper part of their bodies. The women deck themselves with thirty to forty beads, to which some add a necklace of pendant bells. Bangles of zinc adorn their wrists, and a chain of the same metal is suspended from the hair, and attached to a large boss stuck in the ear. But the greatest peculiarity connected with their costume is the practice that prevails, in more remote districts, of the women wearing no clothes at all; instead\nBuddha is always clothed in his long robes, and occasionally strangers appear wrapped in dresses that could only be tolerable on the north side of the Himalayas.\n\nBe this as it may, the real interest of the sculptures centres in the N\u0101gas. They are the principal people represented, and the handsomest, though naturally in the scenes in which \u015a\u0101kya Muni appears, either as Siddh\u0101rtha, or as Buddha, the same elegance of form and beauty of feature everywhere prevails.\n\nThese N\u0101gas appear also on the sculptures of the gateways at Sanchi, and are distinguished in the same manner\u2014the men with a five or seven-hooded snake at the back of their heads, the women with a single-headed snake to each. There, however, they are very subordinate, and never apparently mixed up with the other governing races as at Amravati; and, so far as can be made out from such representations as exist, only one instance of snake worship is found at Sanchi, and that not very distinct.\u00b9\n\nTaking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, it appears to me more than probable that these N\u0101gas are the same people as the so-called Yavanas, who play so important a part in the history of Orissa during the fourth and fifth centuries; and, if this be so, it seems equally clear that they really did come from Cashmeer, or rather from Taxila,\u00b2 which\n\n\u00b9 A very beautiful set of drawings of the sculptures of the Sanchi Tope exists in the East India Library in Canon Row. They were made in 1854 by Lieut. now Lieut.-Colonel Maisey. They are most interesting as far as they go, but unfortunately only represent a small portion of the sculptures. A beautiful set of photographs of the Sanchi Tope is now in course of publication by Lieutenant Waterhouse, R.E.\n\n\u00b2 In the Western Cave inscriptions, the name Yavana Dhanaka cheka frequently occurs, either as a benefactor or an artist, but whether as one person or several is by no means clear. Dr. Stevenson translates the name as the \"Greek Xenocrates.\" General Cunningham, with much more appearance of truth, as a \"Yavana of Dhanaka cheka!\" The first reading we may safely reject, but it will be very interesting if it should be proved that our Dhanaka cheka was then so important as to furnish artists and funds for the Western Caves. That the Yavanas came from the North-west can hardly be doubted, and these land-marks seem to point to a path of migration which may prove invaluable to future explorers.\nseems to have been the head quarters of N\u00e2ga worship in the early centuries of the Christian era.\\(^1\\)\n\nThis being so, we naturally turn to the R\u00e2ja Tarangin\u00ee\\(^2\\) to see what light it may throw on the subject. We find there an invasion of Ceylon under the king Mihirakula in the second century. Another under Meghav\u00e2hana of a more authentic character, in the fourth century; and a king of Cashmeer, called Ran\u00e2ditya, marrying a daughter of the Chola king, and assisting him in various undertakings apparently before the end of the fifth century.\n\nAll this is not very distinct or definitive, but such events would hardly have been recorded in such a work unless there had been some intimate intercourse either of a warlike or peaceful nature between the north and south of India at the period within which the erection of the Amravati Tope has been fixed in the previous part of this paper. What farther light may be thrown on the subject will probably come from Siam. The extracts above given from Col. Low's paper are invaluable as hints to its history, and many of the extracts published by Dr. Bastian\\(^3\\) can now be understood from the light the sculptures of the Amravati Tope throw on the subject. It was apparently by the Diamond Sands and across the Isthmus of Ligor that the communication was kept up between Cashmeer and Cambodia, and gave rise to the erection of the wonderful N\u00e2ga temples of Ongcor Wat with their Indian epic sculptures.\n\nThere are so many novelties\u2014so much that is interesting and important in the Amravati Tope that it would be easy to continue these remarks to almost any extent. It would, however, be difficult to make the matter intelligible without more illustrations than are admissible in this journal. In the present instance this is of the less consequence as I am not without hopes of seeing representations of all the Amravati marbles in the India Museum published in sufficient\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Strabo, lib. xv., p. 698.

Meanwhile I feel convinced that there is nothing known to exist in India which is so beautiful in an artistic point of view as these sculptures, and nothing which is likely to throw so much light on one of the darkest periods of Indian history. If ever we are to understand how far the arts of Europe influenced those of the East, or what amount of intercommunication of ideas took place between the East and West during the early ages of Christianity, it will probably be from the study of the sculptures of the Amravati Tope that we shall derive the clearest impressions on this most interesting subject.\n\nPostscript.\n\nSince this paper on the Amravati Tope was in type, arrangements have been completed with the Indian Government for the publication of the work alluded to in the last paragraph. It is intended to consist of, at least, fifty plates, small folio size; thirty-five of these will contain photographs of nearly one hundred examples of the sculptures, printed by the Carbon process, and therefore as permanent as engravings. The remainder will be lithographs from the drawings in the MacKenzie collection of subjects not represented in the marbles in the East India Museum.\n\nIt is intended that the text shall contain an Essay on Tree and Serpent Worship and an architectural history of Buddhist Rails, in addition to the subjects treated of in the foregoing paper.\n\nThe whole of the plates are in active course of preparation in the department under the superintendence of Dr. Forbes Watson, and it is hoped the work may be ready for publication in the spring of next year.\n\nLangham Place, October, 1867.\nART. VI.\u2014Remarks on Professor Brockhaus' Edition of the Kath\u0101sarit-s\u0101gara, Lambaka IX.-XVIII. By Dr. H. Kern, Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Leyden.\n\nAll Sanskrit scholars must feel obliged to Professor Brockhaus for his edition of Somadeva's Kath\u0101sarit-s\u0101gara, the last part of which, from Lambaka ix.-xviii., was published last year. To copy a work containing 21526 \u015blokas, to select the best readings from a great number of manuscripts, in short, to publish, for the first time, a work in such a manner that the whole affords an almost undisturbed pleasure to the reader, is a heavy task. Indeed, the editor might well say in his preface: \"I may say in good conscience that the text, as given by me, is more complete and correct than it is found in any of the MSS. I used. I have corrected faults in orthography, grammar, syntax, and prosody by thousands; there remain, however, many passages which need further correction, partly on account of the condition of the MSS., partly on account of my deficient knowledge.\" I willingly subscribe to these words, except the last, in which the editor has scarcely done justice to himself. In so extensive a work the sharpness of the eyes and mind becomes so blunted that it ought not to be ascribed to deficiency of knowledge if some faults are to be met with. Professor Brockhaus would certainly judge less severely of the performance of others than of his own.\n\nIn perusing the last volume of the edition of the Kath\u0101sarit-s\u0101gara, I have found some unintelligible passages which I saw no means of restoring satisfactorily without the aid of MSS.; but there are also not a few of them which need only a slight change, or in which the separation of the words in Sandhi by the editor has to be corrected, in order to become perfectly clear. Having no MSS. at hand I shall try to discuss only passages of the latter kind.\nEvery one who knows MSS. will, I suppose, agree with me that no MS. can be an authority as to whether we have to read, for instance, \u090f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f or \u0910\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f. If the meaning be, \u201cI shall go,\u201d we have to read eshy\u0101mi, even if all known MSS. had the contrary; but wherever the context requires \u201cI shall come,\u201d we know the author to have written aishy\u0101mi. I need not explain why cti, eshy\u0101mi, etc., gets confounded with aiti, aishy\u0101mi, etc., whereas, in verses at least, gacch\u0101mi remains distinct from \u0101gacch\u0101mi. There are a pretty considerable number of passages where the editor has erroneously put eshy\u0101mi instead of aishy\u0101mi.\n\nFor instance, p. 64, 17\u00b9:\n\nTad aham b\u0101lak\u0101v etau nitv\u0101 trat-pitri-ve\u00e7mani\nSth\u0101pay\u0101mi; trami \u0101sra \u2019iha, \u00e7ighram eshy\u0101my aham punah.\n\nThe meaning is obviously, \u201cI'll soon come back,\u201d not \u201cI'll go back.\u201d\n\nThe same error occurs 72, 202; 80, 368; 91, 100; 109, 148; 165, 79; 178, 88; 283, 240; 293, 113; 331, 34; 457, 83; 504, 31; 505, 36; 539, 126; 564, 25.\n\nA mistake of the same kind, but in a contrary direction, is the reading Gautama, 139, 319, which ought to be Gotama, for the R\u1e63hi himself is meant, not one of his descendants or followers.\n\nAgain, 249, 328, we find tad-anyair devatair, read daivatair, there being a word derat\u0101 but no devatam.\n\nIf these and similar mistakes must be ascribed to the MSS., or rather, most probably, to some of them, in other instances it is but justice to absolve them wholly; e.g. 461, 85:\n\nTena \u2019udr\u0101ha-vidhim yukty\u0101 praudh\u0101 s\u0101 niravartayat;\nSamkalpaika-pradh\u0101n\u0101 hi diry\u0101 n\u0101ma khil\u0101h kriy\u0101h.\n\nThe second half-sloka is perfectly meaningless; the N\u0101gar\u012b had:\n\n\u0938\u0902\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u0948\u0915\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0939\u093f \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u0916\u093f\u0932\u0903 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964\n\nwhich, in Roman characters, is:\n\nSamkalpaikapradh\u0101n\u0101 hi diry\u0101n\u0101m akhil\u0101h kriy\u0101\u1e25.\n\n\u00b9 The first number here and in the sequel denotes the page, the second the sloka.\ni.e. \"all the actions of heavenly beings depend only upon their own will.\"\n\nA similar correction has to be applied at 417, 22:\n\nKim, deva, niti-tattraj\u00f1o 'py aj\u0101nann iva muhyasi?\nSva-par\u0101ntaram apr\u0113kshyam; ata\u1e25 kasya 'iha vikramah?\n\nI fear no contradiction if I assert that \u091a\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u092e\u0903 is to be rendered, in Roman characters, through apr\u0113kshya? mata\u1e25; the sign of interrogation after muhyasi has to be changed into a semicolon, by those at least who see any use in the introduction of European interpunction into Sanskrit texts. For my part I regard this system as an intrusion. The translation runs nearly thus: \"How can you, my Prince, who are so well versed in politics, indulge in illusions, as if you were ignorant of them, not taking into consideration the difference between yourself and the foe? Who would think here of violence\" (i.e. who would approve of it)?\n\nJustice is also due to the MSS. 376, 119:\n\nSa tam \u0101lokay\u0101m\u0101sa, jihray\u0101 'asrik-ka\u1e47\u1e6d\u1e6di lihan.\n\nThe N\u0101gar\u012b text has \u091c\u093f\u0939\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f, rightly, or may be \u0936\u094d\u0932\u094b\u093d, wrongly, but, at all events, the meaning is: jihray\u0101 \u015brkkani (or rather \u015brkvani) lihan, \"licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue.\"\n\nThe foregoing examples may show that some errors may be cleared without the aid of MSS. I shall now proceed to point out some more of the kind in regular order, and at the same time notice some typographical errors likely to puzzle the reader.\n\nPage 14, 36: Here and elsewhere, e.g. 153, 39; 280, 169, etc., the editor writes abruvam. It may be that some MSS. have it, but that is no reason why it should be Sanskrit. In many copies \u0905\u0903 and \u0905\u0903 are scarcely to be distinguished; hence we find at least a dozen times \u0905\u0903\u0935\u0903 in print against once in the MSS. Whether the editors thought of \u0905\u0903\u0935\u0903, or thought nothing at all, does not matter. That form abruvam is as preposterous as a form advisham or abruvit.\n\n22, 189: For janmabh\u016bmih par\u0101-priy\u0101 read parapriy\u0101.

VII.\u2014The Source of Colebrooke's Essay \"On the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow.\" By Fitzedward Hall, Esq., M.A., D.C.L. Oxon.\n\nIn the second volume of his Chips from a German Workshop, p. 34, foot-note,\u00b9 the distinguished Professor Max M\u00fcller adverting to the above-mentioned dissertation, the earliest of the invaluable series which we owe to the most illustrious of English Sanskritists, makes the remark: \"This Essay, I find, is a literal translation from Gagann\u00e2tha's 'Viv\u00e2dabhang\u00e2rnava,' MS. Wilson, 224, vol. iii., p. 62.\"\n\nWhy, it may be asked, did not Professor M\u00fcller refer, in a popular work, to Colebrooke's Digest,\u00b2 a translation of the Viv\u00e2dabhang\u00e2rnava, rather than to an unprinted Sanskrit text, and one of which there are but three MSS. in Europe? Had he so referred, a clue would have been afforded to mere English readers for determining, independently, whether the Essay in question has, or has not, been correctly represented in his description of it.\n\nIn the introduction to his primary Essay, Colebrooke says, with all explicitness: \"Should the following authorities from Sanscrit books be thought worthy of a place in the next volume of the Society's Transactions, I shall be rewarded for the pains taken in collecting them.\"\u00b3\n\nThis is not the language of a man who is simply rendering into his own tongue what he finds laboriously compiled ready to his hand by another. Colebrooke, as Professor M\u00fcller justly observes, was \"the most accurate and learned Sanskrit scholar we [who read English] have ever had.\" With equal\n\n\u00b9 This foot-note originally formed no part of the article, first published in 1856, to which it is now attached; and, it must, therefore, be considered as the outcome of later and riper researches.\n\u00b2 A Digest of Hindu Law, on Contracts and Successions, etc., Calcutta, 1797, 1798, 4 vols. folio; London, 1801, 3 vols. octavo.\n\u00b3 Asiatic Researches, Vol. iv., p. 209 (1795); or Miscellaneous Essays, Vol. i., p. 114.\ntruth, it may be added, that he was most scrupulously candid, and the last of men to appropriate the due of another.\n\nWhoever chooses to be at the slight trouble of comparing the Essay On the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow with the corresponding chapter in Colebrooke's Digest, will see much in each that is not in the other. Both are made up, mostly, of extracts from the Hindu sacred works, and comments thereon. That the extracts should, even in large measure, be the same, was unavoidable; just as is the case where, for instance, any two or more writers discourse, dogmatically, on the subject of the Eucharist.\n\nThe very first quotation in the Essay, and the longest it contains, should have sufficed to keep Professor M\u00fcller from the assertion he has hazarded. For it is not in the Viv\u0101da-bhang\u0101r\u1e47ava.\n\nAgain, the two stanzas which Colebrooke, without more definite specification, designates, respectively, as \"from the Rigveda,\" and as \"a Paur\u0101\u1e47ic mantra,\" are, likewise, not in the original of the Digest.\n\n---\n\n1 Vol. ii., pp. 451\u2013465 (London edition).\n2 This quotation gives the widow's sankalpa, or 'declaration of resolve' to burn with her deceased husband, that was used in Bengal. A formula extremely like it may be read in Raghunandana's Suddhitattva; one less like it, but of corresponding purport, in the \u0100ch\u0101rachandr\u012bka. Out of Bengal, the formula prescribed is widely different in expression.\n3 \"Om! Let these women, not to be widowed, good wives, adorned with collyrium, holding clarified butter, consign themselves to the fire. Immortal, not childless, nor husbandless, excellent, let them pass into fire, whose original element is water.\" (From the Rigveda.)\nWhere this is reprinted in the Miscellaneous Essays, \"excellent\" is exchanged for \"well-adorned with gems.\"\n\nIt was prior to April 18, 1794, that Colebrooke's first Essay was presented to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. The revered author, in one of the latest of his Essays, read in 1826, speaking of various modes of suicide, formerly or still in use among the Hindus, remarks, that \"they are not founded on the Vedas, as that by burning is.\" And his context shows, that he intended, no less than the self-cremation of males, the concremation of females. Essay On the Philosophy of the Hindus, Part iii. (Min\u0101s\u0101), Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. i., p. 458; or Miscellaneous Essays, Vol. i., p. 321.\n\n4 \"Om! Let these wives, pure, beautiful, commit themselves to the fire, with their husband's corpse.\" (A Paur\u0101\u1e47ic mantra.)\n\n\"Wives\" is amended into \"faithful wives,\" in the Miscellaneous Essays.\n\nThe passages quoted in the last note and in this are introduced and followed, in the Essay, by such sentences as one would reckon on meeting with in any Directory of Concremation. They correspond, almost literally, to sentences in the Suddhitattva and elsewhere.\n\n5 The Suddhitattva adduces them, one just after the other, in this form, as printed:\nOnce more, there is, in the *Digest*, a stanza which Colebrooke there translates as follows: \"The faithful widow is\n\n\u0907\u092e\u093e \u0928\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u0935\u093e: \u0938\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0930\u091c\u0928\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0928\u0941\u0903\u0964\n\u091e\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u094b\u093d\u0928\u092e\u0940\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0932\u093e \u0906\u0930\u094b\u0939\u0928\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947\u0965\n\n\u0907\u092e\u093e: \u092a\u0924\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093e: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e: \u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b \u092f\u093e \u092f\u093e: \u0938\u0941\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0928\u093e:\u0964\n\u0938\u0939 \u092d\u0942\u091a\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0947\u0923 \u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0928\u0941 \u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u0941\u092e\u0965\n\nThis is from Raghunandana's *Institutes of the Hindoo Religion* (Serampore, 1834, 1835), Vol. ii., p. 136. I have no access to any earlier or later edition.\n\nAs to the first of these stanzas, we here find a substitute for \u0906\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0928\u093f\u0928\u094d, the ungrammatical \u0905\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0903, the unmeaning \u0905\u0928\u092e\u0940\u0930\u093e, and the immetrical \u091c\u0928\u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947.\n\nIn the written Bengalee characters, l and n, differing by only a dot, as \u0928 and \u0928, are easily confounded. Hence, with the omission of a syllable, which some ignorant meddler struck out, as an erroneous repetition, \u091c\u0928\u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u0928\u094d, for \u091c\u0928\u092f\u094b \u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u0928\u094d, the true reading.\n\nColebrooke's MS. of the *Suddhitattwa* exhibits these variations: \u0938\u0941\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940:, \u0906\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0928\u093f\u0928\u094d, \u0905\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0903, \u0905\u0928\u092e\u0940\u0930\u093e:, and \u091c\u0928\u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947.\n\nInstead of the foregoing, the late Raja R\u0101dh\u0101k\u0101nta Deva published, in this Journal (Vol. xvii., p. 213), the following reading, professedly taken from the *Suddhitattwa*,\u2014as printed, likely enough, with exceptions that will be specified:\n\n\u0907\u092e\u093e \u0928\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u0935\u093e: \u0938\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0930\u091c\u0928\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0928\u0941\u0903\u0964\n\u091e\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u094b\u093d\u0928\u092e\u0940\u0935\u093e: \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0932\u093e \u0906\u0930\u094b\u0939\u0928\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u092f\u094b \u092f\u094b \u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947\u0965\n\nAt the end of the second line there is, it may be surmised, one typographical error, if there are not two; for even \u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947 would be nonsense. The Raja's argument necessitates \u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947; and the hint of this lection, with \u0905\u0928\u092e\u0940\u0935\u093e: and \u091c\u0928\u092f:, was borrowed, I suspect, from Professor Wilson.\n\nThe reading of the Raja, as copied above, is the only one that has been edited from his manuscript.\n\nThe *Rigveda* (x., xviii., 7,) really has:\n\n\u0907\u092e\u093e \u0928\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u0935\u093e: \u0938\u0941\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0930\u091c\u0928\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0928\u0941\u0903\u0964\n\u091e\u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u094b\u093d\u0928\u092e\u0940\u0935\u093e: \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0932\u093e \u0906 \u0930\u094b\u0939\u0928\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u092f\u094b \u092f\u094b \u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947\u0965\n\n\"Let these women, unwidowed, having good husbands, and with anointing butter on their eyes, enter their houses. Let the mothers, untearful, unmiserable, possessed of excellent wealth, go up to the house first.\"\n\nI have here followed S\u0101yana, save in not rendering \u0906 \u0930\u094b\u0939\u0928\u0941 by \"approach,\" \u0906\u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0928\u0941. What is meant by \u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u0928\u094d, S\u0101yana's \"house,\" is not obvious.\n\nAt all events, widows are not here addressed. In the next stanza, the object\npronounced no suicide by the recited text of the Rigv\u00e9d\u00e1: when three days of mourning are passed, she obtains legal\n\nof address is changed: it is no longer a plurality of living women, but one woman, and that a widow, who is exhorted to \"come to the world of life.\"\n\n\"If the custom of widow-burning had existed at that early period, there would have been no vidhav\u00e1s, no husbandless women, because they would all have followed their husbands into death. Therefore the very name indicates, what we are further enabled to prove by historical evidence, the late origin of widow-burning in India.\" \u2014 Chips from a German Workshop, Vol. ii., p. 34.\n\nScarcely so. Suppose that the self-immolation of widows had had place in the days of the Rigv\u00e9d\u00e1: if it had been optional, as it has long been among the Hindus, there would have been vidhav\u00e1s, all the same. As to \"the late origin of widow-burning in India,\" if Diodorus Siculus may be relied on, it must have antedated the third century before the Christian era.\n\nSir T. E. Colebrooke has been so good as to bring to my notice what were, presumably, the originals, barring a single word, of the two passages in question, as known to his father. The verses are entered, in Mr. II. T. Colebrooke's handwriting, in the margin of a copy of the Asiatic Researches, Vol. iv., p. 211, opposite the translations of them. A punctual transcript is subjoined:\n\nIm\u00e1 n\u00e1ri\u015b avidhav\u00e1\u1e25 supatnir anyan\u00e9na sarpi\u015bha\nSamvisantu vibhavasum\nAnasaro' narirdh suratna \u00e1r\u014dhantu jalay\u00f3nim agn\u00e9.\n\nThis is written at the top of the page. At the side follows:\n\nIm\u00e1h pativrat\u00e1 *\npuny\u00e1h striy\u00f3 *\nya yah sus\u00f3bhha * * *\nsaha bhartrisarir * * *\nsameisanantu vib *\nvasum.\n\nAsterisks have been supplied, to show how many letters have been cut off by the bookbinder.\n\nWith regard to the stanza from the Rigv\u00e9d\u00e1, it is tolerably clear, from several facts, that Colebrooke took it from no book, but was indebted, for it, to private communication. A learned Hindu would not readily admit into his work a passage containing a word destructive of all metre, as \u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u0941 here is. \u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u0941 is an interpolation; and, apparently, it was suggested by a remembrance of the \"Paur\u00e1\u0144ica mantra,\" which ends with that vocable. Again, anasaro, as uttered by a Bengalee, might easily be mistaken for anaswaro, which Colebrooke, as he interprets it \"immortal,\" no doubt thought an error for ana\u015bwaro (\u0905\u0928\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094b), supposed to be an irregular plural, instead of the ordinary \u0905\u0928\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e.\n\nFurther, Colebrooke's \u0905\u0928\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e, expanded into \"not childless, nor husbandless,\" is much the sort of venture that an indifferent Pandit would make, as a presumed safe emendation, in lieu of the archaic and strange \u0905\u0928\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e; especially as the letters \u0935 and \u0930 differ, in the local characters, in \u0935 and \u0930\u094d or \u0930, by only a dot or a bar. The inflection \u0905\u0928\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e, \"fire,\" if not mentally read \u0905\u0928\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e, must have been accounted an anomalous accusative; for just before it stands what was, to Colebrooke's mind, its epithet, \u091c\u0932\u092f\u094b\u0917\u093f\u0928\u093f, \"whose original element is water.\"\n\nNor, with \u091c\u0932 to dispose of, would the case have been in the least bettered by reading \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0903. This, it has been unquestioningly affirmed by Professor Wilson, and implied by Professor M\u00fcller, Colebrooke did read; and, in turn, they translate the words by \"to the place of the fire\" and \"to the womb of fire.\"\nobsequies.\u201d Dealing with the same passage, he had previously written, in his Essay: \u201cObsequies for suicides are\n\nProfessor M\u00fcller will have it, however, but quite gratuitously, that the Brahmans read, concurrently with the sophisticate \u091a\u0948\u0928\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f:, the uncorrupted \u091c\u0928\u092f\u0903. Colebrooke\u2019s \u201cwater,\u201d and the fact that the words he had translated were known to his above-named successors by divination only, should have precluded such categorical positiveness. See this Journal, Vol. xvi., p. 203; and Chips from a German Workshop, Vol. ii., p. 36: also, Elphinstone\u2019s History of India, edition of 1856, p. 50, note 8; and Chambers\u2019s Encyclop\u00e6dia, Vol. ix., (1867), article Sutte.\n\nThat the two learned Professors had no guidance from Raja R\u0101dh\u0101k\u0101nta Deva is proved by a comparison of dates. Professor Wilson, as just adduced, wrote in 1834; Professor M\u00fcller, in 1856; the Raja, in 1858. Nor, for reasons already given, and still to be produced, can I look upon the Raja\u2019s evidence as of weight to corroborate the view of the other two.\n\nColebrooke, as has already been stated, dissatisfied with the term \u201cexcellent,\u201d discarded it for \u201cwell-adorned with gems,\u201d an expression which answers to \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0932\u093e:. Previously he may have had some other word before him, and one indicating that his first text of the passage was even more incorrect than the second. On the whole, it appears conjecturable, that, subsequently to printing his Essay, being desirous, from the unappealable authority of the stanza, of preserving its original, he recovered the words, by the aid of some Brahman, and nearly as they had before been given to him. Moreover, taking account of the time and circumstances, it is not improbable, that, when Colebrooke commenced Sanskrit student, his Brahman assistants were unwilling, or unable, to point out a Vaidik text to him in a book, and that he was, therefore, obliged to rely on their memory, such as it was. More than one of the corruptions dwelt on above is such as we might expect from a person recalling what is unfamiliar.\n\nColebrooke\u2019s text is, doubtless, a depravation based on one resembling Raghnandana\u2019s. And what was Raghusundana\u2019s? Raja R\u0101dh\u0101k\u0101nta Deva\u2019s reading of it differs, as edited, most essentially from that printed in Raghusundana\u2019s Institutes. The former would have had no pertinency whatever to Raghusundana\u2019s context, as not containing even an allusion to fire or burning; and nothing in favour of cremation can be wrested from the lection \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0940:, which, for the rest, as I have pointed out, is not the word that was supplied to Colebrooke, nor that in his M.S. of the Sudhittattva.\n\nProvided with a less vitiated text than that of Colebrooke, the Rev. William Ward, conceiving, apparently, that he could improve on his translation, has offered the following, of his own: \u201cO Fire, let these women, with bodies anointed with clarified butter, eyes (coloured) with stibium, and void of tears, enter thee, the parent of water, that they may not be separated from their husbands, but may be in union with excellent husbands, be sinless, and jewels among women.\u201d A View of the History, Literature, and Mythology of the Hindoos, London edition of 1822, Vol. iii., p. 308.\n\nOn the licences which pervade this it is needless to descant. But Mr. Ward surely had before him \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0940:, \u201cin union with excellent husbands,\u201d and \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935: \u201cvoid of tears;\u201d and his \u201csinless,\u201d hypothetically, answers to \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0940\u0935\u093e:. What is of much greater importance to us, \u201cthe parent of water\u201d presupposes \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093f: and \u201cO fire,\u201d \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0928\u093f,\u2014a vocative, and that only, in correct grammar.\n\nA translation varying but very slightly from Mr. Ward\u2019s, and palpably filched from it, is given in the London Asiatic Journal, Vol. xxvi., (1828), p. 536.\n\nAvowedly receiving the passage from the Rigveda as represented in the Sudhittattva, Mrityunjaya, in his elaborate opinion on widow-burning, quoted to the following effect, if we may trust the fidelity of Sir W. H. Maenaghten: \u201cLet these women, not to be widowed, good wives, adorned with collyrium, with dry\nforbidden; but the Rigv\u00e9da expressly declares, that 'the loyal wife [who burns herself] shall not be deemed a suicide.\n\neyes, devoid of affections, and well-ornamented, ascend the fire.' Much of this, no question, is simply copied from Colebrooke. At the same time, it comes out, on the faith of Mrityunjaya, that MSS. of Raghunandana know the readings \u0938\u0941\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0903, \"good wives,\" and \u0905\u0928\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0903, \"with dry eyes.\" \"Devoid of affections\" is, possibly, a guess at the meaning of \u0905\u0928\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0903; and, though the end of the stanza is only partially interpreted, we can trace the acceptance of a word for \"fire,\" taken to be in the accusative, or else in the locative.\n\nBut it signifies very little on what minor points the text accepted by Raghunandana was right or wrong. That he saw, in the stanza, something about fire, in connexion with the suicide of a widow at her husband's death, is what I have been chiefly concerned to prove. And he, like many after him, was, with little of unlikelihood, satisfied with the gross misleotion \u091c\u0932\u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f.\n\nLet us revert to Professor M\u00fcller. \"It is true,\" he says, \"that, when the English Government prohibited this melancholy custom [widow-burning], and when the whole of India seemed on the verge of a religious revolution, the Brahmins appealed to the Veda as the authority for this sacred rite; and, as they had the promise that their religious practices should not be interfered with, they claimed respect for the Suttee. They actually quoted chapter and verse from the Rig-veda; and Colebrooke, the most accurate and learned Sanskrit scholar we have ever had, has translated this passage in accordance with their views:\n\n\"'Om! Let these women, not to be widowed, good wives, adorned with collyrium, holding clarified butter, consign themselves to the fire. Immortal, not childless, not [Colebrooke has 'nor'] husbandless, well adorned with gems, let them pass into the [Colebrooke has no 'the'] fire, whose original element is water.' (From the Rig-veda).\n\n\"Now, this is, perhaps, the most flagrant instance of what can be done by an unscrupulous priesthood. Here have thousands and thousands of lives been sacrificed, and a fanatical rebellion been threatened on the authority of a passage which was mangled, mistranslated, and misapplied. If anybody had been able, at the time, to verify this verse of the Rig-veda, the Brahmins might have been beaten with their own weapons; nay, their spiritual prestige might have been considerably shaken. The Rig-veda, which now hardly one Brahman out of a hundred is able to read, so far from enforcing the burning of widows, shows clearly that this custom was not sanctioned during the earliest period of Indian history.\" Chips from a German Workshop, Vol. ii., pp. 34, 35.\n\nThis has just been literally reprinted from the Oxford Essays of 1856, p. 22.\n\nProfessor M\u00fcller would have insurmountable difficulty in fastening the appeal that he speaks of on any Brahmins save a very few. \"They actually quoted chapter and verse from the Rig-veda.\" I must be allowed to doubt this exceedingly. In so doing, they would have done as Brahmins very seldom indeed do. It would have been most singular, too, if some one, with the aid of so suicidal a procedure, had not turned to the passage in the Rigveda, made known its genuine wording, and shown that no plea could be based thereon for burning widows. \"If anybody had been able, at the time, to verify this verse of the Rig-veda,\" etc. Was not even Colebrooke able to do so; the Brahmins having \"quoted chapter and verse,\" and he having S\u0101yana's commentary at his elbow?\n\nSo far as has been ascertained, the adulterated passage is traceable to Raghunandana, and no further. This writer, who flourished at the beginning of the sixteenth century, is, according to Colebrooke, \"the greatest authority on Hindu law, in the Province of Bengal.\" His authority is, however, of secondary rank beyond those limits, and in at least one part of Bengal itself, Tirhoot. That he may have been unconversant with the Veda is quite compatible with his deserved celebrity as a lawyer. His date is so recent, and his works have had such fame and currency, that there seems no good reason to disbelieve that he read, if not\nWhen a mourning of three days has been completed, the \u015ar\u0101ddha is to be performed.' This appears from the prayer\n\n\u091c\u0932\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0938\u0930\u0923\u0947, at least \u091c\u0917\u0928\u0947. To this conclusion all the trustworthy evidence that I have collected points well-nigh unequivocally. The presumption, to my mind, is, that he took \u091c\u0917\u0928\u0947 for what it really is, a vocative; and the difference between this and \u091c\u0917\u0928\u0947, the true reading, is scarcely greater in the written Bengalee characters than it is as here printed. Where Raghunandana picked up the passage in its depraved form it would be idle to speculate.\n\nAt the same time, it is, I maintain, manifestly unjust to charge this textual corruption on \"an unscrupulous priesthood.\" India has its full share of priestcraft; but I am convinced that conscious falsification or misattribution of isolated texts has been very rarely practised by the Brahmans, notwithstanding the extent of their pseudonymous literature. As a sacred dictum can be ferreted out in support of almost any conceivable modification of received usage, and as one such is quite enough for the nonce, the dissuasives from dishonesty are maximized.\n\nEspecially in Indian commentaries and legal treatises, we constantly come upon quotations widely deviating from correctness, or credited to a wrong source. To give a single instance, out of several that I have noticed, the topic being the concremation of widows; in the Jatamalla-vitasa, a Tirhoot authority, there occurs, as Manu's, the following line, to be addressed to a damsel at her marriage, reminding her to accompany her husband in life and in death:\n\n\u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0938\u0939\u091a\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0943\u092f\u093e \u091c\u0940\u0935\u0924\u093e\u091c\u0940\u0935\u0924\u093e\u092a\u093f \u091a\u0964\n\nThis verse\u2014not in Manu\u2014is quoted, I think, in a work which I have not at hand, the Dampati-siksha; but, unlike a Pandit, I scruple to recollect as whose.\n\nThe truth, as to these and a thousand citations similarly misascribed, is, I believe, that they were recorded without reference to book. The quantity of memorial matter that even a second-rate Pandit will deliver himself of, on demand, connected with any subject that he has made a specialty of study, would astonish a person unacquainted with the peculiarities of studious Hindus.\n\nTo say, as Professor M\u00fcller says, that Colebrooke translated the false stanza of the Rigveda in accordance with the views of the Brahmans, is language that may easily mislead. It was not that he tied himself to any one's views in translating, but that he translated an adulterated text, identical, in its essence, with one that has been accredited, without suspicion of its true character, by the most learned Brahmans of Bengal. Nor was the appearance of this translation subsequent to the prohibition of sutteeism,\u2014as we should naturally infer from Professor M\u00fcller's phraseology,\u2014but antecedent thereto by thirty-five years. Nor, again, with due adverence, would one speak, without accompanying explanation, of anything in Colebrooke's first Essay, a novitail and\u2014absit verbo invidia\u2014immature performance, in terms so construable as to convey the impression that we have, therein, a sample of the scholarship of \"the most accurate and learned Sanskrit scholar we have ever had.\"\n\nWhether in his utterances or in his reticences, Professor M\u00fcller, with most infrequent exceptions, displays, greatly to his credit, such anxiety of circumspection, and so constant a presence of purpose, that to try him on the weigh-bridge of ordinary judgment, in company with the herd of the uncritical, would simply betray a lack of all proper appreciation. That he can be inexact is the most that I here insist on. His eloquence, learning, and eminent success in popularizing oriental and linguistic studies, one must be ignorant to gainsay, and ungenerous not to applaud.\n\nTo Professor M\u00fcller's thinking, Raghunandana's mislection has borne fruit in most dire disaster. But let us examine the matter a little closely. Out of Bengal, widow-burning was considered as sufficiently justified apart from Vaidik warrant. And we may be sure that the same was the case in Bengal. There, notoriously, the Vaidik tradition was, for many centuries, virtually in abeyance,\nfor the occasion, directed in the Rigv\u00e9da.\u201d Of the source of\n\nand has only very recently undergone a galvanized resuscitation. Of this position we have satisfactory proof in the writings of Bengal Pandits. How many among them have commented on the Veda, or expounded the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101? Until very recently, the learned of Bengal have long been satisfied, substantially, to do without the Veda. They were ignorant of it, and they valued it lightly, and they seldom appealed to it. As they set little store by it, so did the commonalty; and it seems entirely unwarranted to imagine that the spiritual prestige of the priesthood would have been affected in the least degree, or that a single widow would have escaped an untimely end, had it been evulgated, ever so widely, that R\u0101ghunanda had mistaken a false text of the Rigveda for a true one. It would have been quite enough in Bengal, just as it actually was quite enough in parts of India where the Veda was held in higher esteem, to be able to name, in support of widow-burning, such venerable sages as Angiras, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Vy\u0101sa, and \u015aukra, or even the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. Nay, in default of all these, a Hindu would fain content himself with the proverbial Paur\u0101\u1e47ik line,\u2014incidentally quoted, with approval, by Mrityunjaya, in his famous placitum on widow-burning,\u2014which imports, that \u201cthe very convention of the good is authority like that of the Veda:\u201d\n\nAccording to Professor M\u00fcller, in consequence of the Government prohibition of widow-burning, \u201cthe whole of India seemed on the verge of a religious revolution.\u201d Was it indeed so?\n\n\u201cThe apprehensions which had been entertained of the probable evil consequences of the abolition of the Suttee, and of the violent resentment and tumultuary resistance which it was likely to provoke, were singularly falsified. Some few attempts to evade or defy the law were at first tried, and with occasional success; * * * * and the people quietly submitted to the law. Enactments of a similar tendency were promulgated at Madras and at Bombay, and with the like result as in Bengal. Some feeble attempts were made, in Bengal, to obtain a reconsideration of the measure; and petitions were presented against it by a number of Hindus, chiefly persons of opulence, both in the interior and in Calcutta. * * * * As the application to the Governor-General, by the votaries of the ancient superstition, proved unavailing, the petitioners had recourse to the remaining legal source of redress, an appeal to the King in Council. Their cause was deliberately and dispassionately argued before the Privy Council in June, 1832; and, after hearing the arguments of the appellants, and of the advocates of the Court of Directors, as respondents, the Council recommended that the petition should be dismissed; and it was dismissed accordingly. The rejection of the petition was not followed by any excitement. An uneasy and sullen suspicion of the objects and intentions of the British Government continued, for a while, to pervade a considerable portion of the Hindu population; but it never assumed the form of popular agitation: and the progress of time, and the continued caution with which the British Government has abstained from further interposition, have dissipated any alarm and apprehension that might have been generated by its conduct in the prohibition of the Suttee.\u201d Professor Wilson, History of British India from 1805 to 1835, Book III., Chapter vi.\n\nFrom a foot-note on the above: \u201cOne case of serious resistance occurred in 1835, in a dependency of the Bombay Presidency, where, upon the death of the Raja, five of his wives were forcibly burned, in defiance of the efforts of the Assistant Political Commissioner to prevent it. Although he had a force of 300 men at his command, a still larger body of armed men was assembled, who were not dispersed without loss of life, and the necessity of calling in regular troops.\u201d\n\nIn 1828, Professor Wilson had written: \u201cI should be one of the warmest advocates for the abolition of so inhuman a rite, if I was not strongly impressed with the apprehension that serious evil may attend any measures proposed for its absolute suppression. The attempt, whilst it will be attended with but partial\nthis passage Colebrooke was, as yet, unaware; and he mistook a substantive part of it for commentatorial introduction, or else he would have begun his quotation immediately after the word \"forbidden.\" Like the Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101r\u1e47ava, Raghu-\n\nsuccess, will, in my opinion, inspire extensive dissatisfaction and distrust, will alienate, in a great degree, the affections of the natives from their rulers,\" etc.\n\n* * * \"The people will not regard the prohibition.\" * * * \"If, then, it should be resolved to prohibit sutt\u00e9es, the Government must be prepared to let the prohibition remain inoperative, or to enforce it by measures which will partake very much of the nature of religious persecution, and which, whilst they confirm the adherence of the Hindus to their national superstitions, will diffuse a very extensive dread and detestation of the British authority.\"\n\nMr. Marshman, in his History of India, just completed, says, likewise: \"Not the slightest feeling of alarm, still less of resentment, was exhibited in the army, or in the country. * * * Lord William Bentinck was enabled, within a twelvemonth, to assure the Directors that there never was a greater bugbear than the fear of revolt. The only circle in which the abolition created any sensation was that of the rich and orthodox baboos of Calcutta, who resented the decision of Government, and, more especially, the promptitude with which it had been carried into execution, as it deprived them of the gratification of obstructing it. They drew up a petition to the Government, * * * * * demanding the restoration of the rite, as part and parcel of Hindooism, with which Parliament had pledged itself not to interfere. The native organ of the party, in his weekly journal, affirmed that the signatories to the petition for restoring the 'sacred rite of Suttee' included 'the learned, the wealthy, the virtuous, the noble, the polite, and the mild.'\"\n\nVol. iii., pp. 55, 56.\n\nSee, further, Mr. Kaye's Administration of the East India Company, pp. 540, 541; and Mr. Marshman's Life and Times of Carey, Marshman, and Ward, Vol. ii., pp. 417, 418.\n\nThe cremation of widows has no warranty in the extant Rigveda; and it seems most likely that the Hindus, in the earliest ages, did not burn even their dead, but buried them. Still, sutt\u00e9eism has been more or less in vogue, in India, during the past two thousand years and upwards. For some time before its abolition, Lower Bengal was its favourite theatre. In Central India, however, it must have been, formerly, very prevalent. There, not far from the banks of the Nerbudda, I have counted, within the radius of a single mile, several hundred sutt\u00e9e-stones, with their suggestive symbols of obstestation,\u2014an uplifted hand, the sun, the moon, and a group of stars. To these are added the figures of a man and woman. In some representations, the pair stand hand in hand; in others, the wife shampoos her husband's legs. In some instances there is a horse, also. The sculptures are, generally, executed in bass-relief. The oldest of these monuments, bearing dates, that I have examined, were erected in the tenth century.\n\n1 For, in the article of indicating his ancient authorities, so far as they were known to him, though it might be only at second-hand, no one could be more invariably punctilious than Colebrooke.\n\n2 The original words are as follows:\u2014\n\n\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0927\u0940 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940 \u0928 \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092c\u0927\u093e\u0924\u093f\u0928\u0940\u0964\n\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917\u094c\u091a\u0947 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0941 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0924\u0965\n\nAs will have been perceived, Colebrooke might have corrected his first Essay by his Digest; and, while engaged on the latter, he must, of course, have noticed the misapprehension which he laboured under, concerning these verses, when preparing the other. His collected Essays were published during his last illness, when he was disabled, by blindness, from scrutinizing them anew. It might not, else, have been left to others to observe on the very venial defects of his preliminary effort as an orientalist,\u2014a mere \"task,\" as he himself has called it.\nnandana\\(^1\\) refers this stanza to the *Brahma-pur\u0101\u1e47a*,\\(^2\\) to which also he refers the \"*Paur\u0101\u1e47ica mantra*\" \\(^3\\) spoken of above; facts unknown to Colebrooke, when he composed his Essay. \"The prayer for the occasion,\" as Colebrooke calls it, Raghu-nandana, further, finds\\(^4\\) in the stanza \"from the *Rigveda*.\"\n\nIt is seen, thus, that, when Colebrooke wrote on the duties of a Hindu widow, he could not have availed himself of the *Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*. Neither, as has been evinced in passing, could he have been indebted to the *\u015auddhitattva* of Raghu-nandana; for Raja R\u0101dhak\u0101nta Deva, anticipating Professor M\u00fcller in precipitancy of statement, has pronounced\\(^5\\) that therefrom Colebrooke derived the materials of his first Essay. In both works the subject of widow-burning is despatched within the compass of a few pages. Those pages, we may be assured, Colebrooke, if he had read them at all, would have read through; and, in that case, his Essay would, in several particulars, here pointed out, have been different from what it is.\n\nNovember, 1867.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Institutes*, Vol. ii., p. 132.\n\n\\(^2\\) Assuming that the stanza actually appertains to this Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the alternative question arises, whether allusion is made, in it, to the corrupted stanza of the *Rigveda* which we have had under consideration, or whether to a like passage that belonged to some recension of the *Rigveda* now lost.\n\n\\(^3\\) *Institutes*, Vol. ii., p. 133. This is the first of the two places where Raghu-nandana quotes the stanza referred to.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ibid., Vol. ii., p. 132.\n\n\\(^5\\) In this Journal, Vol. xvii., p. 213.\nSUPPLEMENT.\n\nFurther Detail of Proofs that Colebrooke's Essay \"On the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow\" was not indebted to the Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava.\n\nIf the crucial instance which has already been adduced and laboured, for the intent indicated above, should be regarded as anywise inconclusive, the ensuing particulars will be found to complete my argument.\n\nAs for the passage referred to, Colebrooke, in his first Essay, presents us with a rendering of it in a decapitated form, and, instead of noting its source at the end,\u2014after his usual custom,\u2014premises that we have, in it, an express declaration of the Rigveda. In the Digest, the passage is rendered in its integral shape, and is attributed to the Brahma-pur\u0101\u1e47a, where it actually occurs. Colebrooke, with his heedful and conscientious eye, would not, here or anywhere else, have overlooked the specification of an authority; and, if the specification had been noticed, but considered to be doubtful, he would have made mention of the doubt. This may safely be taken for granted. Again, the original of the Digest leaves no room for question where the extract, a single stanza, begins; whereas Colebrooke was grievously misled, on this point, at the time he compiled his Essay. Nor is an error of the press to be presumed here; for Colebrooke never paraphrased, where he professed to translate. The words Rigvedo, as being taken for no constituent part of the extract, but for introduction to it, he preferred to paraphrase, rather than translate, and represented them, without inverted commas, by \"but the Rigv\u0113da expressly declares, that;\" his subsequent translation, when he came to look upon those words as a portion of the extract, being \"by the recited text of the Rigv\u0113da.\" Most of this I have said before; and the rest could be gathered by the attentive reader. Simply for clearness, it has here been stated afresh.\n\n1 Vide supra, pp. 187\u2013189. 2 Vide supra, pp. 185\u2013187.\nAmong the first Hindu law-books read by Colebrooke was the \u0100ch\u0101rachandrik\u0101, in his MS. of which are numerous marginal notes, in pen and pencil. For example, on folios 60 and 62, he has written: \u201cWidow\u2019s burning with the corpse,\u201d \u201cWater given after burning,\u201d \u201cHiatus valde deflendus,\u201d etc., etc.\n\nNow, the stanza under discussion is often quoted, along with one or more constituting its previous context; as in the Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava, the \u015auddhitattva, etc. In the \u0100ch\u0101rachandrik\u0101, too, it is meant to be quoted, with the stanza immediately preceding it, which is announced by the words Yath\u0101 Br\u0101hmye. The first of these two stanzas is translated by Colebrooke, in his Essay, and is referred to the Brahma-pur\u0101\u1e47a. The passage that follows, which, also, should be metrical, is read, in his MS. of the \u0100ch\u0101rachandrik\u0101, Rigved\u0101t, etc. That Colebrooke, during the preparation of his Essay, came upon a better reading than the one there given, his translation clearly evinces. But it is almost demonstrably certain that his view respecting the words Rigved\u0101t\u2014namely, that they were no corruption, and no part of a stanza,\u2014was due to his MS. of the \u0100ch\u0101rachandrik\u0101; for it is scarcely to be supposed that he found this mislection of a well-known metrical passage in any second work. It is now patent, furthermore, why he did not assign this extract to the Brahma-pur\u0101\u1e47a, in his Essay, where it is disjoined from the stanza that comes just before it, which he interprets further on. We should not have had these results, if he had been subsidizing the Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnara.\n\nThough I could accumulate kindred justifications of my general position, I shall hold my hand, after bringing forward three more. In his Essay, Colebrooke translates, as anonymous, a stanza to which is tacked the prose addition: \u201cSo said N\u0101reda to the mother of Sagara.\u201d The same\n\n1 Raghunandana\u2019s Institutes, Vol. ii., p. 132.\n2 Miscellaneous Essays, Vol. i., p. 120.\n3 For the true form of the passage, vide supra, p. 191, note 2.\n4 \u091a\u094d\u091b\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0964 \u092f\u093e \u0928\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0902 \u0928 \u092d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092a\u093e\u0924\u0915\u0902 \u091a\u094d\u091b\u0939\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u094c\u091a\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f-\u092a\u093f \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u093d\u0938\u093f \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0964\n5 Rigvedav\u0101d\u0101t is required, prosodially; and Rigved\u0101t is unidiomatical.\n6 Miscellaneous Essays, Vol. i., p. 120.\nstanza is translated in the *Digest*;\u2014there, as in the *Suddhitattva*, purporting to be taken from the *Brihan-n\u0101radiyapur\u0101\u1e47a*;\u2014and annexed to it is a gloss from Raghunandana: \u201c\u2018Princess\u2019; addressing the mother of Sagara.\u201d The *Digest*, thus, is, here, both fuller and less full than the Essay. It states whence the passage came; and it does not state who addressed Sagara\u2019s mother. These facts certainly make for the conclusion, that the Essay was not beholden to the *Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*.\n\nAgain, there occurs, in the Essay, an extract entitled \u201cThe Sm\u1e5bti,\u201d in which are the words \u201cShe shall eat no other than simple food.\u201d But the *Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*\u2014with which the *Suddhitattva* coincides,\u2014authorizes Colebrooke\u2019s later rendering: \u201cShe must not again use perfumed substances.\u201d It cannot be contended that Colebrooke had, on both occasions, the same Sanskrit words before him. In the Essay, he borrows, in a foot-note, one of the comments on this extract, from the *Madana-p\u0101rij\u0101ta*. Whether he copied it directly, or indirectly, it is impossible to decide.\n\nOnce more, the Essay contains the translation of a stanza and its relative comment, the whole as from Brihaspati. In the *Digest*, the text and the explanation are duly distinguished; and the latter, which is in prose, is there assigned to Raghanandana. It was by something very wide, in point of distinctness, from the *Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava* that Colebrooke was betrayed into the errors of commission and omission just pointed out.\n\n---\n\n1 Vol. ii., p. 456.\n2 Raghunandana\u2019s Institutes, Vol. ii., p. 132.

Common-sense has dictated to the Hindu law-writers what has become, to some extent, an established, as being the most advantageous, disposition of their stock material; and Colebrooke only made good his soundness of judgment, if he respected a precedent, where he saw no reason for setting it aside. We can, therefore, draw no certain inference from the fact, that, here and there, the passages which the Digest and the Essay cite in common appear in the same order in both. Among Colebrooke's extracts\u00b9 are, in one place, three which the Viv\u00e1dabhang\u00e1r\u00f1ara\u00b2 exhibits\u2014with intercalations,\u2014in like sequence to his own; but this sequence is, just as strictly, that of the \u015auddhitattva,\u00b3 also, and of other works, very likely. In the case of three other extracts,\u2074 his arrangement of them is, again, as we find it\u2014with textual insertions,\u2014in the Digest.\u2075 These extracts are in the \u015auddhitattva,\u2076 too, but ordered otherwise; and, for two,\u2077 out of the three, the Viv\u00e1dabhang\u00e1r\u00f1ava could not have been laid under contribution, as I have made out a little higher up.\n\nThe aggregate quotations in the Essay take up one hundred and fifty lines, whole and broken. Out of this total, sixty-five lines are common between the Essay and the Sanskrit Digest; and these sixty-five, not one excepted, are, likewise, in the \u015auddhitattva.\u2078 Even if we had no other evidence than this fact, it would, then, be hazardous to maintain that Colebrooke derived them from the Viv\u00e1dabhang\u00e1r\u00f1ara.\u2079\n\n\u00b9 Miscellaneous Essays, Vol. i., pp. 117, 118. These extracts are from Vish\u1e47u and Prachetas, and \"The Sm\u1e5biti.\" Colebrooke's reading of the last varies, as has been shown, from that of the Viv\u00e1dabhang\u00e1r\u00f1ava.\n\u00b2 Digest, Vol. ii., pp. 459-461.\n\u00b3 Raghunandana's Institutes, Vol. ii., pp. 131, 132.\n\u2074 Respectively given as anonymous, from Brihaspati, and from Gotama. See Miscellaneous Essays, Vol. i., pp. 119, 120.\n\u2075 Vol. ii., pp. 456-458.\n\u2076 Raghunandana's Institutes, Vol. ii., p. 132.\n\u2077 That really from the Brihan-n\u0101r\u0101diya-pur\u0101\u1e47a and that from Brihaspati and Raghunandana combined.\n\u2078 In writing thus positively, I only expect it to be conceded that the identity of a passage is not destroyed by slight various readings.\n\u2079 Inasmuch as, against sixty-five lines of citation common between the Essay\nTo recapitulate, Colebrooke, in putting together his Essay on the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow, could not have been acquainted with the corresponding section of the *Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*; else he would not have given, in it, extracts unaccompanied by those particulars which he was most careful to note to the best of his power, while the Sanskrit work states who wrote those extracts, or from what books they are taken. Nor would he have passed unheeded the readings of passages there inserted; above all, when consideration of them would have enabled him, in one place, to avoid undeniable error, and, in another place, to distinguish text from commentary. Why, further, if he levied drafts on that work, should he have declined to avail himself of it to render his Essay more complete than it is? For it contains more than one passage that, if impressed, would have conduced to enrich the Essay perceptibly. And what is here urged touching the *Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava* may, with much the same pertinency, be urged touching the *\u015auddhitattva*, which, likewise,\u2014as I have evidenced in my former paper, and, in passing, in this,\u2014Colebrooke cannot have explored for the purposes of his Essay. Finally, with reference to quotations common between the Essay and the *Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*, where Colebrooke\u2019s readings of them, in the Essay, are peculiar, it may not be surmised that such readings were in some copies of the *Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*, and not in others. The Sanskrit Digest was compiled at the instance of Sir William Jones; it is not known to have been recast, or amended; its authorities, with few reservations, are familiar legal commonplaces; and neither age nor currency has affected its text with variants. If copies of it differ, their differences are wholly attributable to mere clerical inadvertence.\n\nColebrooke seems to have begun the study of Sanskrit about 1792. In a letter written Oct. 22, 1794, he first mentions his enterprise of translating the *Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*; and and the *Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*, there are at least ninety lines common between the Essay and the *\u015auddhitattva*, one might, in ignorance of the truth, be disposed to substitute this work, as the main promptuary of the Essay, in place of the *Vir\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava*; especially as the other was, probably, quite as accessible to Colebrooke, if not more accessible.\nat that time he had not been in Calcutta for five years and a half. Writing under date of Aug. 11, 1795, he speaks of his translation as undertaken \"a year ago;\" and the task was completed before Jan. 3, 1797. His first Essay was read before the Asiatic Society of Bengal, in April, 1794. The death of Sir William Jones took place, at Calcutta, in the same month. Sir William was to have dressed the Sanskrit Digest in English; and there is no proof that, during his life-time, Colebrooke's attention was directed to it.\u00b9\n\nHow Colebrooke came by the quotations in his Essay it would be idle to speculate at large. Of course, he had not read through all their original sources, among which is the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Very likely he had not read through any one of them. As almost anybody would have done in his circumstances, it is not improbable that he took them, at second-hand, from some of the scores of treatises in which they are adduced. No one can say that he did not assemble them from volumes as numerous as themselves. At all events, we are quite safe in accepting the implication of his words, where he speaks of \"the pains taken in collecting them.\" That from two certain quarters he did not collect them must, by this time, be accounted as pretty evident.\n\nIn the year 1854, I toiled from end to end of the voluminous Viv\u0101dabhang\u0101rnava, with Colebrooke's translation at my side, entering in Professor Wilson's Sanskrit Dictionary some twenty-five thousand supplementary words and meanings. At the same time I compared Colebrooke's Essay with the Digest, on the subject of widow-burning, and also the \u015auddhitattva. All these I scored over with references, cross-references, and other notes; and, but for a repugnance to composition, I should have worked up those materials years ago. I was recently led to glance at them; and the product of that glance is now before the reader.\n\nF. H.\n\nMarch, 1868.\n\n\u00b9 See this Journal, Vol. v., pp. 16-26.

This hymn begins with a somewhat abrupt description of a sunrise. Indra is taken as the god of the bright day, whose steed is the sun, and whose companions the Maruts, or the storm-gods. Arusha, meaning originally red, is used as a proper name of the horse or of the rising sun, though it occurs more frequently as the name of the red horses or flames of Agni, the god of fire, and also of the morning light. In our passage, Arusha, used as a kind of substantive, has taken bradhna as an adjective,\u2014bradhna meaning, as far as can be made out, bright in general, though, as it is\nespecially applied to the Soma-juice, perhaps bright-brown or yellow. Names of colour are difficult to translate from one language into another, for their shades vary, and withdraw themselves from sharp definition. We shall meet this difficulty again and again in the Veda.\n\nThe following passages will illustrate the principal meanings of arush\u00e1, and justify the translation here adopted:\n\n**Arusha as an Adjective.**\n\nArusha is used as an adjective in the sense of red:\n\nvii. 97, 6.

There we read:\n\nix. 8, 6. Arush\u0101h h\u0101rih.\nix. 71, 7. Arush\u0101h div\u0101h kav\u012bh vr\u012bsh\u0101.\nix. 74, 1. V\u0101g\u012b arush\u0101h.\nix. 82, 1. Arush\u0101h vr\u012bsh\u0101 h\u0101rih.\nix. 89, 3. H\u0101rim arush\u0101m.\nix. 111, 1. Arush\u0101h h\u0101rih. See also ix. 25, 5; 61, 21. In\nix. 72, 1, arush\u00e1 seems used as a substantive in the sense of red horse.\n\nThere are some passages where it is doubtful whether arush\u00e1 should be taken as an adjective or as a substantive. Thus we read:\n\nvii. 71, 1. \u00c1pa sv\u00e1suh ush\u00e1sah n\u00e1k gih\u00eete rin\u00e1kti krishn\u012bh arush\u0101ya p\u00e1nth\u00e2m.\n\nThe night retires from her sister, the dawn; the dark one yields the path to the red.\n\nHere the most natural explanation would be to take arush\u00e1 as a name of the sun. For though arush\u00e1 by itself does never exactly mean the sun in the Rig-veda, it comes very near to it in passages like i. 6, 1. It is possible, however, that arush\u0101ya, the dative masculine, might be intended for arush\u0101yai, the dative feminine, and then it would be the red sister, the dawn, in opposition to the dark sister, the night.\n\nArusha as a Substantive.\n\nArush\u00e1 is used as a substantive, and in the following senses:\n\n1. The one red horse of the Sun, the two or more red horses of Agni.\n\ni. 6, 1. Yu\u1e45g\u00e1nti bradhn\u00e1m arush\u00e1m.\nThey yoke the bright red-horse (the Sun).\n\ni. 94, 10. Y\u00e1t \u00e1yukth\u00e2h arush\u00e3 r\u00f3hit\u00e2 r\u00e1the.\nWhen thou (Agni) hast yoked the ruddy red-horses to the chariot.\n\ni. 146, 2. Rih\u00e1nti \u016bdhah arush\u00e3sah asya.\nHis (Agni\u2019s) red-horses lick the udder.\n\nii. 10, 2. Sruy\u0101h agn\u00edh\u2014h\u00e1vam me\u2014sy\u0101v\u00e3 r\u00e1tham vahatah r\u00f3hit\u00e2 v\u00e2 ut\u00e1 arush\u00e3.\nMayest thou, Agni, hear my call, whether the two black, or the two ruddy, or the two red-horses carry you.\n\nHere three kinds of colours are distinguished, and an intentional difference is made between r\u00f3hita and arush\u00e1.\n\niv. 2, 3. Arush\u00e3 yug\u0101n\u0101h.\nAgni having yoked the two red-horses.\niv. 6, 9. T\u00e1va ty\u00e9 agne har\u00edtah\u2014r\u00f3hit\u00e1sah\u2014arush\u00e1sah vr\u00edshan\u00e1h.\n\nTo thee (Agni) belong these bays, these ruddy, these red-horses, the stallions.\n\nHere, again, three kinds of horses are distinguished\u2014Harits, Rohitas, and Arushas.\n\nviii. 34, 17. Ye rigr\u00e1h v\u0101ta-ramhasah arush\u00e1sah raghusy\u00e1dah.\n\nHere arush\u00e1 may be the subject and the rest adjectives; but it is possible, too, to take all the words as adjectives, referring them to \u00e1su in the next verse. The fact that rigra likewise expresses a peculiar red colour is no objection, as may be seen from i. 6, 1; 94, 10.\n\nvii. 16, 2. S\u00e1h yogate arush\u00e3 visv\u00e1-bhogas\u00e2.\n\nHe (Agni) yokes the two all-nourishing red-horses.\n\nvii. 42, 2. Yu\u1e45kshv\u00e1\u2014har\u00edtah roh\u00edtah ka y\u00e9 v\u00e1 s\u00e1dman arush\u00e1h.\n\nYoke (o Agni) the bays, and the ruddy horses, or the red-horses which are in thy stable.\n\n2. The cloud, represented as the enemy of Indra, as retaining like Vritra, the waters which Indra and the Maruts wish to liberate.\n\ni. 35, 5. Ut\u00e1 arush\u00e1sya v\u00ed syanti dh\u00e3r\u00e2h.\n\n(When you go to the battle, o Maruts), the streams of the red enemy flow off.\n\nv. 56, 7. Ut\u00e1 sy\u00e1h v\u00e1g\u00ed arush\u00e1h.\n\nThis strong red-horse,\u2014meant for the cloud, as it would seem; but possibly, too, for one of the horses of the Maruts.\n\n\u00c1rush\u00ee as an Adjective.\n\n\u00c1rush\u00ee, like arush\u00e1, is used as an adjective, in the same sense as arusha, i.e. red:\n\ni. 71, 1. Sy\u00e1vim \u00e1rush\u00edm\u2014ush\u00e1sam.\n\nThe dark, the red dawn (i.e. the gloaming or the twilight).\n\niii. 55, 11. Sy\u00e1vi ka y\u00e1t \u00e1rush\u00ee ka sv\u00e1s\u00e2rau.\n\nThe dark and the red sisters.\n\ni. 92, 1 and 2. G\u00e1vah \u00e1rush\u00eeh and \u00e1rush\u00eeh g\u00e1h.\n\nThe red cows of the dawn.\ni. 92, 2. R\u00faasantam bh\u00e2n\u00fbm \u00e1rush\u00eeh as\u00eesrayah.\n\nThe red dawns obtained bright splendour. Here ush\u00e1sah, the dawns, occurs in the same line, so that we may take \u00e1rush\u00eeh as an adjective, referring to the dawns, and not as a substantive, as a name of the cows.\n\ni. 30, 21. \u00c1sve n\u00e1 kitre arushi.\n\nThou bright, red dawn, thou, like a mare. Here, too, the vocative arushi is to be taken as an adjective.\n\nThe same in iv. 52, 2.\n\n\u00c1sv\u00e2-iva kitr\u00e2 \u00e1rush\u00ee m\u00e2t\u00e2 g\u00e1v\u00e2m rit\u00e2var\u00ee s\u00e2kh\u00e2 abh\u00fbt asv\u00eenoh ush\u00e2h.\n\nThe dawn, bright and red, like a mare, the mother of the cows (days), the never-failing, she became the friend of the Asvins.\n\nx. 5, 5. Sapt\u00e1 sv\u00e1sr\u00eer \u00e1rush\u00eeh.\n\nThe seven red sisters.\n\n\u00c1rush\u00ee as a Substantive.\n\nIf used as a substantive, \u00e1rush\u00ee seems to mean the dawn. It is likewise used as a name of the horses of Agni, Indra, and Soma; also as a name for a mare.\n\nIt means dawn in x. 8, 3, though the text points here so clearly to the dawn, and the very name of dawn is mentioned so immediately after, that this one passage seems hardly sufficient to establish the use of \u00e1rush\u00ee as a recognized name of the dawn.\n\n\u00c1rush\u00ee means the horses of Agni, in i. 14, 12: yukshv\u00e1 h\u00ed \u00e1rush\u00eeh r\u00e2the harit\u00e2h deva rohit\u00e2h.\n\nYoke, o god (Agni), the red horses to the chariot, the bays, the ruddy.\n\ni. 72, 10. Pr\u00e1 n\u00eek\u00eeh agne \u00e1rush\u00eeh ag\u00e2nan.\n\nThey knew the red horses, Agni, coming down.\n\nIn viii. 69, 5, \u00e1rush\u00ee refers to the horses of Indra, whether as a noun or an adjective, is somewhat doubtful:\n\n\u00c2 h\u00e1rayah sasrigir\u00e9 \u00e1rush\u00eeh.\n\nThe bay horses were let loose, the red horses; or, possibly, thy bright red-horses were let loose.\n\nSoma, as we saw, was frequently spoken of as arush\u00e2h h\u00e1rih.\nIn ix. 111, 2, tridh\u0101tubhi\u1e25 \u00e1rushibhi\u1e25 seems to refer to the same red horses of Soma, though this is not quite clear.\n\nThe passages where \u00e1rush\u00ee means simply a mare, without any reference to colour, are viii. 68, 18, and viii. 55, 3.\n\nVr\u012bshan.\n\nAs some of the meanings assigned to Arush\u00e1 are more or less dependent on the exact signification of vr\u012bshan when joined with arush\u00e1, it becomes necessary to ascertain, as far as possible, the real import of that word. In vr\u012bshan we have one of those words which it is almost impossible to translate accurately. It occurs over and over again in the Vedic hymns, and if we once know the various ideas which it either expresses or implies, we have little difficulty in understanding its import in a vague and general way, though we look in vain for corresponding terms in any modern language. In the Veda, and in ancient languages generally, one and the same word is frequently made to do service for many. Words retain their general meaning, though at the same time they are evidently used with a definite purpose. This is not only a peculiar phase of language, but a peculiar phase of thought, and as to us this phase has become strange and unreal, it is very difficult to transport ourselves back into it, still more to translate the pregnant terms of the Vedic poets into the definite languages which we have to use. Let us imagine a state of thought and speech in which virtus still meant manliness, though it might also be applied to the virtue of a woman; or let us try to speak and think a language which expressed the bright and the divine, the brilliant and the beautiful, the straight and the right, the bull and the hero, the shepherd and the king by the same terms, and we shall see how difficult it would be to translate such terms without losing either the key note that was still sounding, or the harmonies which were set vibrating by it in the minds of the poets and their listeners.\n\nVr\u012bshan, being derived from a root vrish, spargere, meant no doubt originally the male, whether applied to animals or men. In this sense vr\u012bshan occurs frequently in the Veda, either as determining the sex of the animal which is mentioned,\nor as standing by itself and meaning the male. In either case, however, it implies the idea of strength and eminence, which we lose whether we translate it by man or male.\n\nThus \u00e1sva is horse, but vii. 69, 1, we read:\n\n\u0100 v\u0101m r\u0101thah\u2014vrishabh\u012bh y\u0101tu \u00e1svaih.\n\nMay your chariot come near with powerful horses, i.e. with stallions.\n\nThe H\u00e1ris, the horses of Indra, are frequently called vr\u00edshan\u0101.\n\ni. 177, 1. Yukta h\u00e1ri(iti) vr\u00edshan\u0101.\n\nThe bay stallions are yoked.\n\nVrishabha\u1e25, though itself originally meaning the male animal, had become fixed as the name of the bull, and in this process it had lost so much of its etymological import that the Vedic poet did not hesitate to define vrishabh\u00e1 itself by the addition of vr\u00edshan. Thus we find, viii. 93, 7:\n\nS\u0101h vr\u00edsh\u0101 vrishabh\u0101\u1e25 bhuvat.\n\nMay he (Indra) be a strong bull.\n\ni. 54, 2. Vr\u00edsh\u0101 vrisha-tv\u0101 vrishabh\u0101\u1e25.\n\nIndra by his strength a strong bull; but, literally, Indra by his manliness a male bull.\n\nEven vrishabh\u00e1 loses again its definite meaning; and as bull in bull-calf means simply male, or in bull-trout, large, so vrishabha is added to atya, horse, to convey the meaning of large or powerful.\n\ni. 177, 2. Y\u00e9 te vr\u00edshanah vrishabh\u0101sah indra\u2014\u00e1ty\u0101h.\n\nThy strong and powerful horses; literally, thy male bull-horses.\n\nWhen vr\u00edshan and vrishabh\u00e1 are used as adjectives, for instance with s\u00fashm\u0101, strength, they hardly differ in meaning:\n\nvi. 19, 8. \u0100 na\u1e25 bhara vr\u00edshanam s\u00fashmam indra.\n\nBring to us thy manly strength, o Indra.\n\nAnd in the next verse:\n\nvi. 19, 9. \u0100 te s\u00fashm\u0101\u1e25 vrishabh\u0101\u1e25 etu.\n\nMay thy manly strength come near.\n\nV\u00e1msaga, too, which is clearly the name for bull, is defined by vr\u00edshan, i. 7, 8.\n\nVr\u00edsh\u0101 y\u016bth\u0101-iva v\u00e1msagah.\n\nAs the strong bull scares the herds.\nThe same applies to var\u0101ha, which though by itself meaning boar, is determined again by vr\u012bshan.\n\nx. 67, 7. Vr\u012bshabhi\u1e25 var\u0101hai\u1e25.\nWith strong boars.\n\nIn iii. 2, 11, we read, vr\u012bsh\u0101\u2014n\u0101nadat n\u0101 simh\u0101\u1e25.\nRoaring like a male lion.\n\nIf used by itself, vr\u012bshan, at least in the Rig-veda, can hardly be said to be the name of any special animal, though in later Sanskrit it may mean bull or horse. Thus if we read, x. 43, 8, vr\u012bsh\u0101 n\u0101 kruddh\u0101\u1e25, we can only translate like an angry male, though, no doubt, like a wild bull, would seem more appropriate.\n\ni. 186, 5. Y\u0113na n\u0101p\u0101tam ap\u0101m gun\u0101ma manah-guva\u1e25 vr\u012bshanah y\u0101m v\u0101hanti.\nThat we may excite the son of the water (Agni), whom the males, quick as thought, carry along.\n\nHere the males are no doubt the horses or stallions of Agni. But, though this follows from the context, it would be wrong to say that vr\u012bshan by itself means horse.\n\nIf used by itself vr\u012bshan most frequently means man, and chiefly in his sexual character. Thus:\n\ni. 140, 6. Vr\u012bsh\u0101-iva p\u0101tni\u1e25 abh\u012b eti r\u014druvat.\nAgni comes roaring like a husband to his wives.\n\ni. 179, 1. \u0100pi \u016bm(it\u012b) n\u016b p\u0101tni\u1e25 vr\u012bshanah gagamyuh.\nWill the husbands now come to their wives?\n\nii. 16, 8. Sakv\u012bt s\u016b te sumatibhi\u1e25\u2014s\u0101m p\u0101tnibhi\u1e25 n\u0101 vr\u012bshanah nasimahi.\nMay we for once cling firmly to thy blessings, as husbands cling to their wives.\n\nv. 47, 6. Upa-praksh\u0113 vr\u012bshanah m\u014ddam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 div\u0101\u1e25 path\u0101 vadhv\u0101\u1e25 yanti \u0101kkha.\nThe exulting men come for the embrace on the path of heaven towards their wives.\n\nIn one or two passages vr\u012bshan would seem to have a still more definite meaning, particularly in the formula s\u016bra\u1e25 dr\u012b\u015bike vr\u012bshanah ka pa\u016bmsye, which occurs iv. 41, 6; x. 92, 7. See also i. 179, 1.\n\nIn all the passages which we have hitherto examined vr\u012bshan\nclearly retained its etymological meaning, though even then it was not always possible to translate it by male.\n\nThe same meaning has been retained in other languages in which this word can be traced. Thus, in Zend, arshan is used to express the sex of animals in such expressions as aspah\u00e9 arshn\u00f4, gen. a male horse; var\u00e1zahe arshn\u00f4, gen. a male boar; g\u00e9us arshn\u00f4, gen. a male ox; but likewise in the sense of man or hero, as arsha husrava, the hero Husrava. In Greek we find \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd and \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd used in the same way to distinguish the sex of animals, as \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f35\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9, \u03b2\u03bf\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1. In Latin the same word may be recognised in the proper name Varro, and in varo and bario.\n\nWe now come to another class of passages in which vr\u00edshan is clearly intended to express more than merely the masculine gender. In some of them the etymological meaning of spar gere, to pour forth, seems to come out again, and it is well known that Indian commentators are very fond of explaining vr\u00edshan by giver of rain, giver of good gifts, bounteous. The first of these meanings may indeed be admitted in certain passages, but the others are more than doubtful.\n\ni. 181, 8. Vr\u00edsh\u00e2 v\u00e2m megh\u00e2h may be translated, your raining cloud.\n\ni. 129, 3. Dasm\u00e2h hi sma vr\u00edshanam p\u00ednvasi tv\u00e1kam.\n\nThou art strong, thou fillest the rainy skin, i.e. the cloud.\n\nSee also iv. 22, 6; and possibly v. 83, 6.\n\nIt may be that, when applied to Soma too, vr\u00edshan retained something of this etymological meaning, that it meant gushing forth, poured out, though in many places it is impossible to render vr\u00edshan, as applied to Soma, by any thing but strong. All we can admit is that vr\u00edshan, if translated by strong, means also strengthening and invigorating, an idea not entirely absent even in our expression, a strong drink.\n\ni. 80, 2. S\u00e2h tv\u00e2 amadat vr\u00edsh\u00e2 m\u00e1d\u00e2h, s\u00f3mah\u2014sut\u00e2h.\n\nThis strong draught inspirited thee, the poured out Soma-juice.\n\ni. 91, 2. Tv\u00e1m vr\u00edsh\u00e2 vr\u00edshatvebh\u00eeh.\n\nThou, Soma, art strong by strength.\n\ni. 175, 1. Vr\u00edsh\u00e2 te vr\u00edshne \u00ednduh v\u00e2g\u00ee sahasra-s\u00e2tam\u00e2h.\nFor thee, the strong one, there is strong drink, powerful, omnipotent.\n\nIn the ninth Mandala, specially dedicated to the praises of Soma, the inspiriting beverage of gods and men, the repetition of vr\u00edshan, as applied to the juice and to the god who drinks it, is constant. Indo vr\u00edsh\u00e2 or vr\u00edsh\u00e2 indo are incessant invocations, and become at last perfectly meaningless.\n\nThere can be no doubt, in fact, that already in the hymns of the Veda, vr\u00edshan had dwindled away to a mere epitheton ornans, and that in order to understand it correctly, we must, as much as possible, forget its etymological colouring, and render it by hero or strong. Indra, Agni, the Asvins, Vishnu, the Ribhus (iv. 35, 6), all are vr\u00edshan, which means no longer male, but manly, strong.\n\nIn the following passages vr\u00edshan is thus applied to Indra:\n\ni. 54, 2. Y\u00e1h dhrishn\u00fam\u00e1 s\u00e1vas\u00e2 r\u00f3das\u00ee(\u00edti) ubh\u00e9(\u00edti) vr\u00edsh\u00e2 vrishatv\u00e3 vrishabh\u00e1h ni-r\u00edng\u00e1te.\n\n(Praise Indra) who by his daring strength conquers both heaven and earth, a bull, strong in strength.\n\ni. 100, 1. S\u00e1l y\u00e1h vr\u00edsh\u00e2 vrishnyebhih s\u00e1m-ok\u00e1h mah\u00e1h div\u00e1h prithivy\u00e1h ka sam-r\u00e2t satin\u00e1-satv\u00e2 h\u00e1vyah bh\u00e1reshu mar\u00fatvan nahi bhavatu \u00edndrah \u00fatii.\n\nHe who is strong, wedded to strength, who is the king of the great sky and the earth, of mighty might, to be invoked in battles,\u2014may Indra with the Maruts come to our help!\n\ni. 16, 1. \u00c1 tv\u00e2 valhantu h\u00e1rayah vr\u00edshanam s\u00f3ma-p\u00edtaye, \u00edndra tv\u00e2 s\u00fara-kakshasa\u1e25.\n\nMay the bays bring thee hither, the strong one, to the Soma-draught, may the sunny-eyed horses (bring) thee, o Indra.\n\niv. 16, 20.

In the Veda, varshisht\u00e1ha still means excellent,\nbut in later Sanskrit it is considered as the superlative of\nvridha, old, so that we see vrishan, from meaning originally\nmanly, vigorous, young, assuming in the end the meaning of\nold. (M. M. Sanskrit Grammar, \u00a7 252.)\n\nYet even thus, when vrishan means simply strong or hero,\nits sexual sense is not always forgotten, and it breaks out, for\ninstance, in such passages as:\n\ni. 32, 7. Vr\u00edshnah v\u00e1dhrih pratim\u0101nam b\u00fabh\u00fbshan puru-\ntr\u00e1 vritrah asayat v\u00ed-astah.\n\nVritra, the eunuch, trying to be like unto a man (like unto\nIndra), was lying, broken in many pieces.\n\nThe next passages show vrishan as applied to Agni:\n\niii. 27, 15, Vrishanam tv\u00e1 vay\u00e1m vrishan vrishanah s\u00e1m\nidh\u00eemah\u00ed.\n\nO, strong one, let us the strong ones light thee, the\nstrong!\n\nv. 1, 12. \u00c1vok\u00e2ma kav\u00e1ye m\u00e9dhy\u00e2ya v\u00e1kah vand\u00e2ru vrisha-\nbh\u00e2ya vr\u00edshne.\n\nWe have spoken an adoring speech for the holy poet, for\nthe strong bull (Agni).\n\nVishnu is called vrishan, i, 154, 3.\nPr\u00e1 v\u00edshnave s\u00fash\u00e1m etu m\u00e1ntma giri-ksh\u00edte uru-g\u00e2y\u00e1ya vr\u00edshne.\n\nMay this hymn go forth to Vishnu, he who dwells in the mountain (cloud), who strides wide, the hero.\n\nRudra is called vr\u00edshan:\n\nii. 34, 2. Rudr\u00e1h y\u00e1t va\u1e25 marutah rukma-vakshasah vr\u00edsh\u00e2 \u00e1gani pr\u00edsny\u00e2h sukr\u00e9 \u016bdhani.\n\nWhen Rudra, the strong man, begat you, o Maruts with brilliant chests, in the bright bosom of Pr\u00ed\u0161ni.\n\nThat the Maruts, the sons of Rudra, are called vr\u00edshan, we have seen before, and shall see frequently again (i. 165, 1; ii. 33, 13; vii. 56, 20; 21; 58, 6). The whole company of the Maruts is called vr\u00edsh\u00e2 gan\u00e1h, the strong or manly host, i.e. the host of the Maruts, without any further qualification.\n\nHere lies, indeed, the chief difficulty which is raised by the common use of vrishan in the Veda, that when it occurs by itself, it often remains doubtful who is meant by it, Indra, or Soma, or the Maruts, or some other deity. We shall examine a few of these passages, and first some where vr\u00edshan refers to Indra:\n\niv. 30, 10. Apa ush\u0101h \u00e1nasah sarat s\u00e1m-pisht\u00e2t \u00e1ha bibhy\u00fa-sh\u00ee, n\u00ed y\u00e1t s\u00eem sisn\u00e1that vr\u00edsh\u00e2.\n\nUshas went away from her broken chariot, fearing lest the hero should do her violence.\n\nHere vr\u00edshan is clearly meant for Indra, who, as we learn from the preceding verse, was trying to conquer Ushas, as Apollo did with Daphne; and it should be observed that the word itself, by which Indra is here designated, is particularly appropriate to the circumstances.\n\ni. 103, 6. Bh\u016bri-karmane vrishabh\u00e3ya vr\u00edshne saty\u00e1-sush-m\u00e2ya sunav\u00e2ma s\u00f3mam, y\u00e1h \u00e0-dr\u00edtya paripanth\u00e3-iva s\u00fbrah \u00e1yagvanah vi-bh\u00e1gan \u00e9ti v\u00e9da\u1e25.\n\nLet us pour out the Soma for the strong bull, the performer of many exploits, whose strength is true, the hero who, watching like a foot-pad, comes to us dividing the wealth of the infidel.\n\nHere it is clear again from the context that Indra only can be meant.\nBut in other passages this is more doubtful:\n\niii. 61, 7. Rit\u00e1sya budhn\u00e9 ush\u00e1s\u00e2m ishany\u00e1n vr\u00edsh\u00e1 mah\u00ed (\u00edti) r\u00f3das\u00ed (\u00edti) \u00e1 vivesa.\n\nThe hero in the depth of the heaven, yearning for the dawns, has entered the great sky and the earth.\n\nThe hero who yearns for the dawns, is generally Indra; here, however, considering that Agni is mentioned in the preceding verse, it is more likely that this god, as the light of the morning, may have been meant by the poet. That Agni, too, may be called vr\u00edshan, without any other epithet to show that he is meant rather than any other god, is clear from such passages as:\n\nvi. 3, 7. Vr\u00edsh\u00e1 ruksh\u00e1h \u00f3shadhishu n\u00fbnot.\n\nHe the wild hero shouted among the plants.\n\nIn vii. 60, 9, vr\u00edshanau, the dual, is meant for Mitra and Varuna; in the next verse, vr\u00edshanah, the plural, must mean the same gods and their companions.\n\nThat Soma is called simply vr\u00edshan, not only in the ninth Mandala, but elsewhere, too, we see from such passages, as:\n\niii. 43, 7. \u00cdndra p\u00edba vr\u00edsha-dh\u00fatasya vr\u00edshnah (\u00e3 y\u00e1m te syen\u00e1h usat\u00e9 gabb\u00e1ra), y\u00e1sya m\u00e1de kyav\u00e1yasi pr\u00e1 krish\u00f1h y\u00e1sya m\u00e1de \u00e1pa gotr\u00e1 vav\u00e1rtha.\n\nIndra drink of the male (the strong Soma), bruised by the males (the heavy stones), inspirited by whom thou makest the people fall down, inspirited by whom thou hast opened the stables.\n\nHere S\u00e2yana, too, sees rightly that the male bruised by the males is the Soma-plant, which, in order to yield the intoxicating juice, has to be bruised by stones, which stones are again likened to two males. But unless the words, enclosed in brackets, had stood in the text, words which clearly point to Soma, I doubt whether S\u00e2yana would have so readily admitted the definite meaning of vr\u00edshan as Soma.\n\ni. 109, 3. M\u00e1 khedma rasm\u00edn \u00edti n\u00e1dhham\u00e2n\u00e2h pitr\u00een\u00e2m sak-t\u00edh anu-y\u00e1kkham\u00e2n\u00e2h, indr\u00e1gn\u00edbh\u00fd\u00e2m k\u00e1m vr\u00edshanah madanti t\u00e3 h\u00ed \u00e1dr\u00ec (\u00edti) dhish\u00e1n\u00e2y\u00e0h up\u00e1-sthe.\n\nWe pray, let us not break the cords (which by means of the sacrifices offered by each generation of our forefathers unite us with the gods); we strive after the powers of our\nfathers. The Somas rejoice for Indra and Agni; here are the two stones in the lap of the vessel.\n\nFirst, as to the construction, the fact that participles are thus used as finite verbs, and particularly when the subject changes in the next sentence, is proved by other passages, such as ii. 11, 4. The sense is that the new generation does not break the sacrificial succession, but offers Soma, like their fathers. The Soma plants are ready, and, when pressed by two stones, their juice flows into the Soma-vessel. There may be a double entendre which Sanskrit scholars will easily perceive.\n\nWhen vrishan is thus used by itself, we must be chiefly guided by the adjectives or other indications before we determine on the most plausible translation. Thus we read:\n\ni. 55, 4. S\u0101h it v\u0101ne namasy\u016bbh\u012bh vakasyate k\u0101ru g\u0101neshu prabruv\u0101nah indriy\u0101m, vrish\u0101 kh\u0101nduh bhavati haryat\u0101h vrish\u0101 ksh\u0113mena dh\u0113nam maghav\u0101 y\u0101t \u012bnvati.\n\nIn the first verse the subject is clearly Indra: \"He alone is praised by worshippers in the forest, he who shows forth among men his fair power.\" But who is meant to be the subject of the next verse? Even S\u0101yana is doubtful. He translates first: \"the bounteous excites the man who wishes to sacrifice; when the sacrificer, the rich, by the protection of Indra, stirs up his voice.\" But he allows an optional translation for the last sentences: \"when the powerful male, Indra, by his enduring mind reaches the praise offered by the sacrificer.\"\n\nAccording to these suggestions, Wilson translated: \"He (Indra) is the granter of their wishes (to those who solicit him); he is the encourager of those who desire to worship (him), when the wealthy offerer of oblations, enjoying his protection, recites his praise.\"\n\nBenfey: \"The bull becomes friendly, the bull becomes desirable, when the sacrificer kindly advances praise.\"\n\nLanglois: \"When the noble Maghavan receives the homage of our hymns, his heart is flattered, and he responds to the wishes of his servant by his gifts.\"\n\nAs far as I know, the adjective kh\u0101ndu does not occur\nagain, and can therefore give us no hint. But haryat\u00e1h, which is applied to vr\u00edshan in our verse, is the standing epithet of Soma. It means delicious, and occurs very frequently in the ninth Mandala. It is likewise applied to Agni, P\u00fashan, the Haris, the thunderbolt, but wherever it occurs our first thought is of Soma. Thus, without quoting from the Soma-Mandala, we read, x. 96, 1, haryat\u00e1m m\u00e1dam, the delicious draught, i.e. Soma.\n\nx. 96, 9. P\u00edtv\u00e1 m\u00e1dasya haryat\u00e1sya \u00e1ndhasah, means, having drunk of the draught of the delicious Soma.\n\nviii. 72, 18. Pad\u00e1m haryat\u00e1sya nidh\u00e2ny\u0101m, means the place where the delicious Soma resides.\n\niii. 44, 1. Haryat\u00e1h s\u00f3mah.\nDelicious Soma.\n\nii. 21, 1. Bhara \u00edndr\u00e2ya s\u00f3mam yagat\u00e1ya haryat\u00e1m.\nBring delicious Soma for the holy Indra.\n\ni. 130, 2. M\u00e1d\u00e2ya haryat\u00e1ya te tuv\u00ed\u0161tam\u00e2ya dh\u00e1yase.\nThat thou mayest drink the delicious and most powerful draught, i.e. the Soma.\n\nIf, then, we know that vr\u00edshan by itself is used in the sense of Soma, haryat\u00e1h vr\u00edshan can hardly be anything else, and we may therefore translate the second line of i. 55, 5, \u201cthe strong Soma is pleasing, the strong Soma is delicious when the sacrificer safely brings the cow.\u201d\n\nThat Indra was thirsting for Soma had been said in the second verse, and he is again called the Soma-drinker in the seventh verse. The bringing of the cow alludes to the often mentioned mixture with milk which the Soma undergoes before it is offered.\n\nThat the Maruts are called vr\u00edshan, without further explanations, will appear from the following passages:\n\ni. 85, 12. Ray\u00edm nah dhatta vrishanah su-v\u00edram.\nGive us wealth, ye heroes, consisting of strong men.\n\nviii. 96, 14. \u00cdshy\u00e1mi vah vrishanah y\u00fadhyata \u00e2ga\u00fa.\nI wish for you, heroes (Maruts), fight in the race!\n\nIn all the passages which we have hitherto examined, vr\u00edshan was always applied to living beings, whether animals, men, or gods. But as, in Greek, \u1f00\u03c1\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd\u03c5 means at last simply\nstrong, and is applied, for instance, to the crash of the sea \u03ba\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, so in the Veda vr\u00edshan is applied to the roaring of the storms and similar objects.\n\nv. 87, 5. Svan\u00e1h vr\u00edsh\u00e2.\n\nYour powerful sound (o Maruts).\n\nx. 47, 1. Gagribhm\u00e1 te d\u00e1kshinam indra h\u00e1stam vasu-y\u00e1vah\nvasu-pate v\u00e1s\u00fbn\u00e1m, vidm\u00e1 h\u00ed tv\u00e1 g\u00f3-patim s\u00fara g\u00f3n\u00e2m asm\u00e1-\nbhyam kitr\u00e1m vr\u00edshnam ray\u00edm d\u00e2h.\n\nWe have taken thy right hand, o Indra, wishing for trea-\nsures, treasurer of treasures, for we know thee, o hero, to be\nthe lord of cattle; give us bright and strong wealth.\n\nShould kitr\u00e1 here refer to treasures, and vr\u00edshan to cattle?\n\nx. 89, 9. N\u00ed \u00e1mitreshu vadh\u00e1m indra t\u00famram vr\u00edshan\nvr\u00edsh\u00e1nam arush\u00e1m sis\u00eehi.\n\nWhet, o hero, thy heavy strong, red weapon, against the\nenemies.\n\nThe long \u00e1 in vr\u00edsh\u00e1nam is certainly startling, but it\noccurs once more, ix. 34, 3, where there can be no doubt that\nit is the accusative of vr\u00edshan. Roth takes vr\u00edshan here in\nthe sense of bull (s.v. tumra), but he does not translate the\nwhole passage.\n\niii. 29, 9. Kr\u00edn\u00f3ta dh\u00fbm\u00e1m vr\u00edshanam sakkh\u00e2yah.\n\nMake a mighty smoke, o friends!\n\nStrength itself is called vr\u00edshan, if I am right in translating\nthe phrase vr\u00edshanam s\u00fashmam by manly strength. It occurs\niv. 24, 7. T\u00e1smin dadhat vr\u00edshanam s\u00fashmam \u00edndrah.\n\nMay Indra give to him manly strength.\n\nvi. 19, 8. \u00c1 nah bhara vr\u00edshanam s\u00fashmam indra.\n\nBring to us, o Indra, manly strength.\n\nvii. 24, 4. Asm\u00e9 (\u00edt\u00ed) d\u00e1dh\u00e1t vr\u00edshanam s\u00fashmam indra.\n\nGiving to us, o Indra, manly strength.\n\nSee also vi. 19, 9. S\u00fashm\u00e1h vrishabh\u00e1h, used in the same\nsense.\n\nThis constant play on the word vr\u00edshan, which we have\nobserved in the passages hitherto examined, and which give\nby no means a full idea of the real frequency of its occurrence\nin the Veda, has evidently had its influence on the Vedic\nRishis, who occasionally seem to delight in the most silly and\nunmeaning repetitions of this word, and its compounds and derivatives. Here no language can supply any adequate translation; for though we may translate words which express thoughts, it is useless to attempt to render mere idle play with words. I shall give a few instances:\n\ni. 177, 3. \u0100 tishtha r\u0101tham vr\u012bshanam vr\u012bsh\u0101 te sut\u0101h s\u00f3mah p\u0101ri-sikt\u0101 m\u0101dh\u016bni, yuktv\u0101 vr\u012bshabhy\u0101m vr\u012bshabha k\u1e63hitin\u0101\u1e41 h\u0101ribhy\u0101m y\u0101hi pra-vat\u0101 \u00fapa madrik.\n\nMount the strong car, the strong Soma is poured out for thee, sweets are sprinkled round; come down towards us, thou bull of men, with the strong bays, having yoked them.\n\nBut this is nothing yet compared to other passages, when the poet cannot get enough of vr\u012bshan and vr\u012bshabhas.\n\nii. 16, 6.

I, the strong, call thee, the strong, thou holder of the thunderbolt, with manifold blessings; for thou hast desired our praise; our call is strong.\n\nThere are other passages of the same kind, but they are too tedious to be here repeated. The commentator, throughout, gives to each vrishan its full meaning either of showering down or bounteous, or male or bull; but a word which can thus be used at random has clearly lost its definite power, and calls forth no definite ideas in the mind of the listener. It cannot be denied that here and there the original meaning of vrishan would be appropriate even where the poet is only pouring out a stream of majestic sound, but we are not called upon to impart sense to what are verba et praeterquam nihil. When we read, i. 122, 3, v\u0101tah ap\u0101m vrishan-v\u0101n, we are justified, no doubt, in translating, \u201cthe wind who pours forth water;\u201d and x. 93, 5, ap\u0101m vrishan-vas\u016b s\u016bry\u0101n\u0101s\u0101 means \u201cSun and Moon, givers of water.\u201d But even in passages where vrishan is followed by the verb vrish, it is curious to observe that vrish is not necessarily used in the sense of raining or pouring forth, but rather in the sense of drinking.\n\nvi. 68, 11. \u012andr\u0101varun\u0101 m\u0101dhu-mattamasya vrishanah somasya vrishan\u0101* \u0101 vrisheth\u0101m.\n\nIndra and Varuna, you strong ones, may you drink of the sweetest strong Soma.\n\nThat \u0101vrish means to drink or to eat, was known to S\u0101yana and to the author of the Satapatha-br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who paraphrases \u0101 vrish\u0101yadhvam by asn\u012bta, cat.\n\n---\n\n* The dual vrishanau occurs only when the next word begins with a vowel. Before an initial a, \u0101, i, the au is always changed into \u0101v in the Sanhit\u0101 (i. 108, 7\u201312; 116, 21; 117, 19; 153, 2; 157, 5; 158, 1; 180, 7; vii. 61, 5). Before u the preceding au becomes \u0101u in the Sanhit\u0101, but the Pada gives au, in order to show that no Sandhi can take place between the two vowels (vii. 60, 9; x. 66, 7). Before consonants the dual always ends in \u0101, both in the Sanhit\u0101 and Pada. But there are a few passages where the final \u0101 occurs before initial vowels, and where the two vowels are allowed to form one syllable. In four passages this happens before an initial \u0101 (i. 108, 2; vi. 68, 11; i. 177, 1; ii. 16, 5). Once and once only it happens before u, in viii. 22, 12.\nThe same phrase occurs i. 108, 3.\n\ni. 104, 9. Uru-vy\u0101k\u0101h gath\u0101re \u0101 vrishasva.\nThou of vast extent, drink (the Soma) in thy stomach.\n\nThe same phrase occurs x. 96, 13.\n\nviii. 61, 3. \u0100 vrishasva\u2014sut\u00e1sya indra \u00e1ndhasah.\nDrink, Indra, of the Soma that is poured out.\n\nIn conclusion, a few passages may be pointed out in which vr\u00edshan seems to be the proper name of a pious worshipper, i. 36, 10; vi. 16, 15 (p\u00e2thy\u00e1).\n\nVerse 1, note 2. A similar expression occurs iii. 61, 5, where it is said of Ushas, the dawn, that she lighted the lights in the sky, pr\u00e1 rokan\u0101 ruruke ranv\u00e1-samdrik.\n\nVerse 2, note 1. Although no name is given, the pronoun asya clearly refers to Indra, for it is he to whom the two bays belong. The next verse, therefore, must likewise be taken as addressed to Indra, and not to the sun, spoken of as a horse in the first verse.\n\nVerse 3, note 1. The vocative mary\u0101h, which I have translated by O men, had evidently become a mere exclamation at a very early time. Even in our passage it is clear that the poet does not address any men in particular, for he addresses Indra, nor is mary\u0101 used in the general sense of men. It means males, or male offspring. It sounds more like some kind of asseveration or oath, like the Latin meherele, or like the English, O ye powers, and it is therefore quoted as an nip\u0101ta or particle in the V\u00e2g. Pr\u00e2tis. ii. 16. It certainly cannot be taken as addressed to the Maruts, though the Maruts are the subject of the next verse,\n\nVerse 3, note 2. Ush\u00e1dbh\u012bh, an instrumental plural which attracted the attention of the author of the V\u00e2rttika to P\u00e2n. vii. 4, 48. It occurs but once, but the regular form, ushobh\u012bh, does not occur at all in the Rig-Veda. The same grammarian mentions m\u0101s, month, as changing the final s of its base into d before bhis. This, too, is confirmed by Rv. ii. 24, 5, where m\u0101dbh\u012bh occurs. Two other words, svavas, offering good protection, and svatavas, of independent strength, mentioned together as liable to the same change, do not occur with bh\u012bh in the Rig-Veda, but the forms svavadbh\u012bh and svatavadbh\u012bh probably occurred in\nsame other Vedic writings. Svatavadbhya\u1e25 has been pointed out by Professor Aufrecht in the V\u0101gasan. Sanhita, xxiv. 16, and svatavobhya\u1e25, in Satap. Br. ii. 5, 1, 14. That the nom. svav\u0101n, which is always trisyllabic, is not to be divided into sva-v\u0101n, as proposed by S\u0101kalya, but into su-av\u0101n, is implied by V\u0101rttika to P\u0101\u1e47. viii. 4, 48, and distinctly stated in the Siddh\u0101nta-Kaumud\u012b. That the final n of the nom. su-av\u0101n disappeared before semi-vowels is confirmed by the S\u0101kala-pratis\u0101khya, S\u016btra 287; see also V\u0101gasan. Pr\u0101tis. iii. S\u016btra 135 (Weber, Ind. Stud. iv. p. 206). On the proper division of su-avas, see Aufrecht, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft, vol. xiii. p. 499.\n\nVerse 4, note 1. Svadh\u0101, literally one\u2019s own place, afterwards, one\u2019s own nature. It was a great triumph for the science of Comparative Philology that, long before the existence of such a word as svadh\u0101 in Sanskrit was known, it should have been postulated by Professor Benfey in his Griechische Wurzellexicon, published in 1839, and in the appendix of 1842. Svadh\u0101 was known, it is true, in the ordinary Sanskrit, but there it only occurred as an exclamation used on presenting an oblation to the manes. It was also explained to mean food offered to deceased ancestors, or to be the name of a personification of M\u0101y\u0101 or worldly illusion, or of a nymph. But Professor Benfey, with great ingenuity, postulated for Sanskrit a noun svadh\u0101, as corresponding to the Greek \u1f11\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 and the German sitte, O.H.G. sit-u, Gothic sid-u. The noun svadh\u0101 has since been discovered in the Veda, where it occurs very frequently, and its true meaning in many passages where native tradition had entirely misunderstood it, has really been restored by means of its etymological identification with the Greek \u1f11\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 or \u1f21\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2. See Kuhn\u2019s Zeitschrift, ii. 134; xii. 158.\n\nThe expressions, \u00e1nu svadh\u0101\u1e41 and svadh\u0101\u1e41 \u00e1nu are of frequent occurrence. They mean, according to the nature or character of the persons spoken of, and may be translated by as usual, or according to a person\u2019s wont. Thus in our passage, we may translate, The Maruts are born again, i.e., as soon as Indra appeared with the dawn, according to their\nwont; they are always born as soon as Indra appears, for such is their nature.\n\ni. 165, 5. \u00cdndra svadh\u00e1\u1e41 \u00e1nu h\u00ed n\u0101h babh\u016btha,\nFor, Indra, according to thy wont, thou art ours.\n\nviii. 20, 7.

U\u015bha\u1e25 \u00e1nu svadh\u00e1\u1e41 ava.\nDawn, help! as thou art wont.\n\ni. 33, 11. \u00c1nu svadh\u00e1\u1e41 aksharan \u0101pa\u1e25 asya.\nAs usual, or according to his nature, i.e. his strength, the waters flowed.\n\ni. 88, 6. \u00c2s\u0101\u1e41 \u00e1nu svadh\u00e1\u1e41.\nAccording to the nature of these libations.\n\nvii. 56, 13. \u00c1nu svadh\u00e1\u1e41 \u016byudhaih y\u00e1kkham\u0101n\u0101\u1e25.\nAccording to their nature, stretching forth with their weapons.\n\niii. 51, 11.

Yet the history of these words in Sanskrit and Greek has not been exactly the same. First of all we observe in Greek a division between \u1f11\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 and \u1f11\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, and whereas the former comes very near in meaning to the Sanskrit svadh\u0101, the latter shows in Homer a much more primitive and material sense. It means in Homer, not a person\u2019s own nature, but the own place, for instance, of animals, the haunts of horses, lions, fish; in Hesiod, also of men. Svadh\u0101 in the Veda does not occur in that sense, although etymologically it might take the meaning of one\u2019s own place. (Cf. dh\u0101-man, familia, etc.) Whether in Greek \u1f11\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, from meaning lair,\nhaunt, home, came, like \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 and \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, to mean habit, manner, character, which would be quite possible, or whether \u1f21\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 in that meaning represents a second start from the same point, which in Sanskrit was fixed in svadh\u00e2, is impossible to determine. In Sanskrit svadh\u00e2 clearly shows the meaning of one's own nature, power, disposition. It does not mean power or nature in general, but always the power of some one, the peculiarity, the individuality of a person. This will appear from the following passages:\n\nii. 3, 8.

In vi. 2, 8, svadh\u00e2 looks like an adverb, instead of svadh\u00e1y\u00e2, and would then refer to p\u00e1rigm\u00e2.\n\nBut svadh\u00e2 means also food, lit. one\u2019s own portion, the sacrificial offering due to each god, and lastly, food in general.\n\ni. 108, 12 Y\u00e1t indr\u00e2gn\u00ee (\u00edti) \u00fat-it\u00e2 s\u00fbryasya m\u00e2ndhye div\u00e2h svadh\u00e1y\u00e2 m\u00e2nd\u00e2yethe (\u00edti).\nWhether you, Indra and Agni, delight in your food at the rising of the sun or at mid-day.\niii. 4, 7.

The expression garbhatvam \u0101-\u012brire, is matched by that of iii. 60, 3, Saudhanvan\u0101sah amrita-tv\u0101m \u0101 \u012brire, the Saudhanvanas (the Ribhus) obtained immortality. The idea that the Maruts assumed the form of a garbha, lit. of an embryo or a new-born child, is only meant to express that the storms burst forth from the womb of the sky as soon as Indra arises to do battle against the demon of darkness. As assisting Indra in this battle, the\nMaruts, whose name retained for a long time its purely appellative meaning of storms, attained their rank as deities by the side of Indra, or, as the poet expresses it, they assumed their sacred name. This seems to be the whole meaning of the later legend that the Maruts, like the Ribhus were not originally gods, but became deified for their works.\n\nVahni.\n\nVerse 5, note 1. S\u0101yana explains vahnibhih in the sense of Marudbhik, and he tells the oft-repeated story how the cows were carried off by the Panis from the world of the gods, and thrown into darkness, and how Indra with the Maruts conquered them and brought them back. Everybody seems to have accepted this explanation of S\u0101yana, and I myself do not venture to depart from it. Yet it should be stated that the use of vahni as a name of the Maruts is by no means well established. Vahni is in fact a most difficult word in the Veda. In later Sanskrit it means fire, and is quoted also as a name of Agni, the god of fire, but we do not learn why a word which etymologically means carrier, from vah, to carry, should have assumed the meaning of fire. It may be that vah, which in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin means chiefly to carry, expressed originally the idea of moving about (the German be-wegen), in which case v\u00e1h-ni, fire, would have been formed with the same purpose as ag-n\u00ed, ig-nis, fire, from Sk. ag, \u1f04\u03b3\u03c9, ag-o. But in Sanskrit Agni is so constantly represented as the carrier of the sacrificial oblation, that something may be said in favour of the Indian scholastic interpreters who take v\u00e1hni, as applied to Agni, in the sense of carrier. However that may be, it admits of no doubt that vahni, in the Veda also, is distinctly applied to the bright fire or light. In some passages it looks very much like a proper name of Agni, in his various characters of terrestrial and celestial light. It is used for the sacrificial fire.\n\nv, 50, 4.

But, for that very reason, vahni may here have the meaning of priest, which, as we shall see, it has in many places, and the translation would then be more natural: He, the chosen minister, came near and sat down, Agni, the priest.\n\nviii. 23, 3.

(See x. 11, 7: v\u00e1ham\u00e1nah \u00e1svai\u1e25.)\n\nii. 37, 3. M\u00e9dyantu te v\u00e1hnayah y\u00e9bhi\u1e25 \u016byase.\n\nMay thy horses be fat on which thou goest.\n\nii. 24, 13.

Vaky\u00e1nt\u0101m te v\u00e1hnayah sapt\u00e1-gihv\u0101\u1e25.*\n\nMay thy seven-tongued horses be called. Here v\u00e1hnayah is clearly meant for the flames of Agni, yet, I doubt whether we should be justified in dropping the simile, as the plural of v\u00e1hni is nowhere used in the bald sense of flames.\n\nIn one passage v\u00e1hni is used as a feminine, or at all events applied to a feminine subject:\n\nviii. 94, 1. Yukt\u0101 v\u00e1hni\u1e25 r\u0101th\u0101n\u0101m.\n\nShe is yoked as the drawer of the chariots.\n\nThe passages in which v\u00e1hni is applied to Soma in the 9th Mandala throw little light on the subject. (x. 9, 6; 20, 5; 6; 36, 2; 64, 19; 89, 1; x. 101, 10.)\n\nInstead of vis\u0101\u1e41 visp\u0101tih, lord of men (vii. 7, 4), we find ix. 108, 10, vis\u0101\u1e41 v\u00e1hni\u1e25 n\u00e1 vis-p\u00e1ti\u1e25. One feels inclined to translate here v\u00e1hni\u1e25 by leader, but it is more likely that v\u00e1hni is here again the common name of Soma, and that it is inserted between vis\u0101\u1e41 n\u00e1 vis-p\u00e1ti\u1e25, which probably forms one phrase.\n\nIn ix. 97, 34, tisr\u00e1\u1e25 v\u0101k\u0101\u1e25 \u012brayati pr\u00e1 v\u00e1hni\u1e25, we may take v\u00e1hni as the common appellation of Soma. But it may also mean minister or priest, as in the passages which we have now to examine. Cf. x. 11, 6.\n\n* Cf. i. 58, 7: sapt\u00e1 guhv\u0101\u1e25.\nFor besides these passages in which vahni clearly means vector, carrier, drawer, horse, there is a large class of verses in which it can only be translated by minister, i.e. officiating minister, and, as it would seem, chiefly singer or reciter.\n\nThe verb vah was used in Sanskrit in the sense of carrying out (ud-vah, ausf\u00fchren), or performing a rite, particularly as applied to the reciting of hymns. Hence such compounds as ukth\u00e1-v\u00e2has or st\u00f3ma-v\u00e2has, offering hymns of praise. Thus we read:\n\nv. 79, 4. Abh\u00ed y\u00e9 tv\u00e2 vibh\u00e2-vari st\u00f3ma\u00efh grin\u00e1nti v\u00e1hnayah.\nThe ministers who praise thee, splendid dawn, with hymns.\n\ni. 48, 11.

S\u00e1h v\u00e1hnibhih r\u00edkvabhih g\u00f3shu s\u00e1svat mit\u00e1-g\u00f1ubhih puru-kr\u00edtv\u00e1 gig\u00e2y\u0101.\nHe (Indra) was victorious often among the cows, always with celebrating and suppliant ministers.\n\nI have placed these two passages together because they seem to me to illustrate each other, and to show that although in the second passage the celebrating and suppliant ministers may be intended for the Maruts, yet no argument could be drawn from this verse in favour of vahni by itself meaning the Maruts. See also viii. 6, 2; 12, 15; x. 114, 2.\n\niv. 21, 6. H\u00f3t\u00e1 y\u00e1h nah mah\u00e3\u1e41 sam-v\u00e1raneshu v\u00e1hnih.\nThe Hotar who is our great priest in the sanctuaries.\ni. 128, 4.

Tuvi-gr\u00e1ye v\u00e1hnaye.\nTo the strong-voiced priest.\nThe fact that v\u00e1hni is followed in several passages by uktha\u1e25 would seem to show that the office of the v\u00e1hni was chiefly that of recitation or of addressing prayers to the gods.\n\niii. 20, 1. Agn\u00edm ush\u00e1sam asv\u00edn\u00e2 dadhi-kr\u0101\u1e41 v\u00ed-ushtishu havate v\u00e1hni\u1e25 uktha\u1e25.\nThe priest at the break of day calls with his hymns Agni, Ushas, the Asvins, and Dadhikr\u0101.\n\ni. 184, 1.

This \u00e1s\u0101 is the instrumental singular of \u00e1s, mouth, and it is used in other phrases also of the mouth as the instrument of praise.\n\nvi. 32, 1. Vagr\u00edne s\u00e1m-tam\u00e1ni v\u00e1k\u00e2msi \u00e1s\u0101 sth\u00e1vir\u00e2y\u0101 taksham.\nI have shaped with my mouth blesseed words to the wielder of the thunderbolt, the strong Indra.\n\nx. 115, 3. \u00c1s\u0101 v\u00e1hnim n\u00e1 sokish\u0101 vi-rapsinam.\nHe who sings with his flame as the poet with his mouth. See also i. 38, 14. Mimil\u012b sl\u00f3kam \u00e1sy\u0113, make a song in the mouth.\n\nThus we find v\u00e1hni\u1e25 \u00e1s\u0101 in the same place in the sixth and seventh Mandalas (vi. 16, 9; vii. 16, 9) in the phrase v\u00e1hni\u1e25 \u00e1s\u0101 vid\u016bh-tarah, applied to Agni in the sense of the priest wise with his mouth, or taking v\u00e1hni\u1e25 \u00e1s\u0101 as it were one word, the wise poet.\n\ni. 129, 5. V\u00e1hni\u1e25 \u00e1s\u0101, v\u00e1hni\u1e25 nah \u00e1kkha.\nIndra, as a priest by his lips, as a priest coming towards us. From the parallelism of this passage it would seem that\nProfessor Roth concluded the meaning of \u0101s\u0101* to be near, or coram.\n\ni, 76, 4. Prag\u0101-vat\u0101 v\u0101kas\u0101 v\u0101hni\u1e45 \u0101s\u0101 \u0101 ka huv\u00e9 n\u00ed ka satsi ih\u00e1 devai\u1e25.\n\nWith words in which my people join, I, the poet, invoke, and thou (Agni) sittest down with the gods.\n\nvi, 11, 2. P\u0101vak\u0101y\u0101 guhv\u0101 v\u0101hni\u1e45 \u0101s\u0101.\n\nThou, a poet with a bright tongue, o Agni!\n\nThe question now arises in what sense vahni is used when applied without further definition to certain deities. Most deities in the Veda are represented as driving or driven, and many as poets or priests. When the Asvins are called vahni, viii, 8, 12; vii, 73, 4, it may mean riders. But when the Visve devai\u1e25 are so called, 1, 3, 9, or the Ribhus, the exact meaning is more doubtful. The Maruts are certainly riders, and we can even prove that they were supposed to sit on horseback and to have the bridle through the horse\u2019s nostrils (v, 61, 2). But if in our verse 1, 6, 5, we translate vahni as an epithet, rider, and not only as an epithet, but as a name of the Maruts, we cannot support our translation by independent evidence, but must rely partly on the authority of S\u0101yana, partly on the general tenour of the text before us, where the Maruts are mentioned in the preceding verse, and, if I am right, in the verse following also. On the other hand, if\n\n* \u0100s, mouth, the Latin os, oris, has been derived from a root as, to breathe, presented in the Sanskrit as-u, spirit, asu-ra, endowed with spirit, living, the living god. Though I agree with Curtius in admitting a primitive root as, to breathe, from which as-u, breath, must have sprung, I have always hesitated about the derivation of \u0101s, and \u0101\u015bya, mouth, from the same root. I do not think, however, that the lengthening of the vowel in \u0101s is so great a difficulty as has been supposed (Kuhn, Zeitschrift, xvii, 145). Several roots lengthen their vowel a, when used as substantives without derivative suffixes. In some cases this lengthening is restricted to the Anga base, as in anadv\u0101\u1e25; in others to the Anga and Pada base, as in visav\u0101\u1e6d, visav\u0101\u1e0dbhi\u1e25 etc.; in others again it pervades the whole declension, as in tur\u0101sh\u0101\u1e6d. (See Sanskrit Grammar, \u00a7 210, 208, 175.) Among ordinary words v\u0101k offers a clear instance of a lengthened vowel. In the Veda we find vitish\u0101ham, vi, 14, 4, and vitish\u0101ham (Sanhit\u0101), i, 64, 15. We find v\u0101h in apsu-v\u0101\u1e25 (S\u0101m. Ved.), indra-v\u0101\u1e25, hayya-v\u0101\u1e25. Sah at the end of compounds, such as nri-sah, prit\u0101na-sah, bh\u016br\u012b-sah, satr\u0101-sah, vibh\u0101-sah, sad\u0101-sah, varies between a long and short a. (See Regnier, \u00c9tude sur l\u2019idiome du V\u00e9das, p. 111.) At all events no instance has yet been pointed out in Sanskrit showing the same contraction which we should have to admit if we derived \u0101s from av-as, or from an-as. From an we have in the Veda \u0101n\u0101, mouth or face, i, 52, 15. From as, to breathe, the Latin omen, originally, os-men, a whisper, might likewise be derived.\nvahni can be thus used as a name of the Maruts, there is at least one other passage which would gain in clearness by the admission of that meaning, viz.,\n\nx, 138, 1. T\u00e1va ty\u00e9 indra sakhy\u00e9shu v\u00e1hnayah\u2014v\u00ed adardi-\nruh val\u00e1m.\n\nIn thy friendship, Indra, these Maruts tore asunder the cloud.\n\nVerse 5, note 2. I have translated v\u00edlu by stronghold, though it is only an adjective meaning firm. Dr. Oscar Meyer, in his very able essay Qu\u00e6stiones Homeric\u00e6, specimen prius, Bonnae, 1867, has tried to show that this v\u00edlu is the original form of \u1f38\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, and he has brought some further evidence to show that the siege and conquest of Troy, as I pointed out in my Lectures on the Science of Language, vol. ii. p. 470, was originally described in language borrowed from the siege and conquest of the dark night by the powers of light, or from the destruction of the cloud by the weapons of Indra. It ought to be considered, however, that v\u00edlu in the Veda has not dwindled down as yet to a mere name, and that therefore it may have originally retained its purely appellative power in Greek as well as in Sanskrit, and from meaning a stronghold in general, have come to mean the stronghold of Troy.\n\nVerse 5, note 3. The bright cows are here the cows of the morning, the dawns, or the days themselves, which are represented as rescued at the end of each night by the power of Indra, or similar solar gods. Indra\u2019s companions in that daily rescue are the Maruts, the storms, or the breezes of the morning, the same companions who act even a more prominent part in the battle of Indra against the dark clouds; two battles often mixed up together.\n\nVerse 6, note 1. The reasons why I take g\u00edra\u1e25 as a masculine in the sense of singer or praiser, have been explained in a note to i. 37, 10.\n\nVerse 6, note 2. Y\u00e1th\u0101 mat\u00edm, lit. according to their mind, according to their heart\u2019s desire. Cf. ii, 24, 13.\n\nVerse 7, note 1. The sudden transition from the plural to the singular is strange, but the host of the Maruts is frequently spoken of in the singular, and nothing else can here\nbe intended. It may be true, as Professor Benfey suggests, that the verses here put together stood originally in a different order, or that they were taken from different sources. Yet though the S\u0101ma-veda would seem to sanction a small alteration in the order of the verses, the alteration of verses 7, 4, 5, as following each other, would not help us much. The Atharva-veda sanctions no change in the order of these verses.\n\nThe transition to the dual at the end of the verse is likewise abrupt, not more so, however, than we are prepared for in the Veda. The suggestion of the Nirukta (iv. 12) that these duals might be taken as instrumentals of the singular, is of no real value.\n\nVerse 7, note 2. Dr\u012bkshase, a very valuable form, a second person singular conjunctive of the First Aorist \u0100tmanepada, the termination \"sase\" corresponding to Greek \u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, as the conjunctive takes the personal terminations of the present in both languages. Similar forms, viz., prikshase, x, 22, 7, mamsase, x, 27, 10; Ath. Veda, vii, 20, 2-6, and possibly v\u00edvakshase, x, 21, 1-8, 24, 1-3, 25, 1-11, will have to be considered hereafter. (Nirukta, ed. Roth, p. 30, Notes).\n\nVerse 8, note 1. Arkati, which I have here translated by he cries, means literally, he celebrates. I do not know of any passage where arkati, when used, as here, without an object, means to shine, as Professor Benfey translates it. The real difficulty, however, lies in makha, which S\u0101yana explains by sacrifice, and which I have ventured to translate by priest or sacrificer. Makha, as an adjective, means, as far as we can judge, strong or vigorous, and is applied to various deities, such as P\u016bshan, i, 138,1, Savitar, vi, 71, 1, Soma, xi. 20, 7, Indra, iii. 34, 2, the Maruts, i. 64, 11; vi. 66, 9. By itself, makha is never used as the name of any deity, and it cannot therefore, as Professor Roth proposes, be used in our passage as a name of Indra, or be referred to Indra as a significant adjective. In i. 119, 3, makha is applied to men or warriors, but it does not follow that makha by itself means warrior, though it may be connected with the Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 in \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2. (See Curtius, Grundz\u00fcge, p. 293; Grassmann, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, xvi, 164.)\nThere are two passages where makha refers to an enemy of the gods, ix. 101, 13; x. 171, 2.\n\nAmong the remaining passages there is one where makha is used in parallelism with vahmi, x. 11, 6. v\u00edvakti v\u00e1hni\u1e25, svapasy\u0101te makh\u0101\u1e25. Here I propose to translate, The poet speaks out, the priest works well. The same meaning seems to me applicable likewise to the phrase makh\u00e1sya d\u0101v\u00e1ne, to the offering of the priest,\n\ni. 134, 1. \u0100 y\u0101hi d\u0101v\u00e1ne, v\u0101yo, makh\u00e1sya d\u0101v\u00e1ne.\nCome, Vayu, to the offering, to the offering of the priest.\n\nviii. 7, 27. \u0100 nah makh\u00e1sy ad\u00e1v\u00e1ne\u2014d\u00e9v\u00e1sah \u00fapa gantana.\nCome, gods, to the offering of our priest.\n\nProfessor Roth proposes to render makh\u00e1 in these passages by \u2018attestation of joy, celebration, praise,\u2019 and he takes d\u0101v\u00e1ne, as I have done, for a dative of d\u0101van, a nomen actionis, meaning, the giving. But although d\u0101v\u00e1ne may thus be taken as a dative singular of d\u0101van, I doubt whether it can be so interpreted in every passage in which it occurs. There seem to me to be certain passages where we have to admit a noun d\u0101vana, and to take d\u0101v\u00e1ne as a locative sing.\n\nvi. 71, 2. Dev\u00e1sya vay\u00e1m savit\u016b\u1e25 s\u00e1vimani\nSr\u0113\u015b\u1e6dhe sy\u0101ma v\u00e1sunah ka d\u0101v\u00e1ne\n\nMay we be in the favour of the god Savitar, and in the best award of his treasure.\n\nHere sr\u0113\u015b\u1e6dhe, though it might be drawn back to s\u00e1vimani, is more naturally joined with d\u0101v\u00e1ne, while, if we took d\u0101v\u00e1ne as a dative, the parallelism of the two lines would be destroyed. We should then have to translate: May we be in the best favour of the god Savitar, and for the giving of treasure.\n\nI should prefer the locative likewise in ii. 11, 1, sy\u0101ma te d\u0101v\u00e1ne v\u00e1sun\u0101m, and ii. 11, 12, sady\u0101\u1e25 te ray\u0101\u1e25 d\u0101v\u00e1ne sy\u0101ma, though I am aware that the majority of passages* where d\u0101v\u00e1ne occurs favours Professor Roth\u2019s explanation.\n\nVerses 9 and 10, note 1. Although the names for earth, sky, and heaven vary in different parts of the Veda, yet the\n\n---\n\n* Rv. i. 61, 10; 122, 5; 134, 2; 139, 6; ii. 1, 10; iv. 29, 5; 32, 9; v. 59, 1, 4; vi. 65, 3; viii. 25, 20; 45, 10; (92, 6); 46, 25; 27; 63, 5; 69, 17; 70, 12; ix. 93, 4; x. 32, 5; 44, 7; 50, 7.\nexpression div\u00e1h rokan\u00e1m occurs so frequently that we can hardly take it in this place in a sense different from its ordinary meaning. Professor Benfey thinks that rokana may here mean ether, and he translates \"come from heaven above the ether;\" and in the next verse, \"come from heaven above the earth.\" At first, every reader would feel inclined to take the two phrases, div\u00e1h v\u00e2 rokan\u00e2t \u00e1dhi, and div\u00e1h v\u00e2 p\u00e2rthiv\u00e2t \u00e1dhi, as parallel; yet I believe they are not quite so.\n\nThe following passages will show that the two words rokan\u00e1m div\u00e1h belong together, and that they signify the light of heaven, or the bright place of heaven.\n\nviii. 98, 3. \u00c1gakkhah rokan\u00e1m div\u00e1h.\nThou (Indra) wentest to the light of heaven.\ni. 155, 3. \u00c1dh\u00ed rokan\u00e9 div\u00e1h.\nIn the light of heaven.\niii. 6, 8.

See also i. 105, 5; viii. 69, 3.\n\nThe very phrase which we find in our verse, only with hit instead of v\u00e2, occurs again, i. 49, 1; viii. 8, 7; and the same sense must probably be assigned to viii. 1, 18, \u00e1dha gm\u00e1h \u00e1dha v\u00e2 div\u00e1h brihat\u00e1h rokan\u00e2t \u00e1dhi.\n\nEither from the earth, or from the light of the great heaven, increase, o Indra!\n\nRokana also occurs in the plural:\ni. 146, 1.

The cosmography of the Veda is, as I said before, somewhat vague and varying. There is, of course, the natural division of the world into heaven and earth (dyu and bh\u016bmi), and the threefold division into earth, sky, and heaven, where sky is meant for the region intermediate between heaven and earth (prithivi, antariksha, dyu). There is also a fourfold division, for instance,\u2014\n\nviii. 97, 5.

The fourth verse of the same hymn throws no light on the subject, and I should feel inclined to take divy\u0101-p\u0101rthivasya as one word, though even then the cosmic division here adopted is by no means clear.

At all events there is no passage in the Rig-Veda where p\u0101rthiva is joined as an adjective with dyu. P\u0101rthiva as an adjective is frequently joined with ragas, never with dyu.

IX.\u2014Sassanian Inscriptions. By E. Thomas, Esq.\n\nSo long ago as the year 1847, during a temporary absence from my duties in India, I volunteered to undertake the classification of certain imperfectly determined and but partially deciphered series of coins in the East India House collection\u2014in continuation and completion of Professor Wilson's comprehensive description of the more popular departments of Central-Asian Numismatics already embodied in his Ariana Antiqua. Among the subdivisions so treated may be cited the Kufic Mintages of the Ghaznavides, a detailed notice of which was inserted in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1848 (vol. ix.),\u00b9 as well as a second article, bearing more immediately upon the subject under review, on \"the Pehlvi Coins of the early Muhammadan Arabs,\" which appeared in the twelfth volume of that Journal. In entering upon the examination of the available specimens of the latter class of national representative currencies, I found myself called upon to encounter a novel and very difficult branch of Oriental Palaeography, the study of which, indeed, had but recently been inaugurated by the publication of Professor Olshausen's most instructive work \"Die Pehlwie-Legenden:\"\u00b2 while it was manifest that the obscure language, of which this imperfect alphabet constituted the graphic exponent, was dependent for its elucidation upon still more fragmentary and defective grammatical or lexicographical means: obstacles which the since accelerated progress of modern ethnography has, up to this time, failed to remove. Under these conditions I\n\n\u00b9 A further paper on the same subject will be found in vol. xvii. J.R.A.S. for 1858.\n\u00b2 Die Pehlwie-Legenden auf den M\u00fcnzen der letzten Sas\u00e2niden, etc. Kopenhagen, 1843. A translation of this work is to be found in the London Numismatic Chronicle, vol. ix., 1848.\nnaturally approached this new investigation with sufficient diffidence, and sought to secure the critical soundness of any suggestive deductions that might present themselves, by a decisive appeal to every arch\u00e6ological test within reach. Foremost among these were the monumental writings of the earlier Sassanian kings, who, in traditional imitation of the Ach\u00e6menians, from whom, indeed, they boasted a but temporarily obscured descent\u2014indulged ostentatiously in mural sculpture and attendant lapidary epigraphy. The Rock Inscriptions of Ardash\u00edr B\u00e1bek\u00e1n and his proximate successor are couched in duplicate versions, varying dialectically, and written in mere modifications of the same normal alphabet; the one ordinarily employed to define the Pehlvi of Eastern Persia, and out of whose literal elements modern Zend was elaborated, is now conventionally termed \"Sassanian:\" its counterpart transcript, which adheres more closely to Chald\u00e6an literal forms, was once designated \"Parthian,\" from its occasional official employment under that intrusive dynasty, but has latterly been known as Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi. The parallel versions of the original inscription of Sapor I. in the H\u00e1j\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d Cavern, which had been secured many years ago in the form of direct plaster impressions by Sir E. Stannus, sufficed to furnish a thoroughly trustworthy outline of the manipulative type of each letter of the concurrent alphabets; these forms were separately compared, selected examples copied, and, finally, the duplicate series were incorporated into a classified table, which may be cited with still undiminished confidence, as freely representing the epochal current forms of the joint Pehlvi characters, and as furnishing an efficient illustration of the divarications from a given standard gradually introduced in succeeding ages.\n\nOn a later occasion, following up the same subject, I availed myself of another hopeful source of pal\u00e6ographic data, afforded by the signets and seals of the Persian nation at large, fabricated during the period of the Sassanian rule,\n\n---\n\n1 The original impressions are now in Dublin; secondary casts are to be found in the Assyrian Room in the British Museum, and the Royal Asiatic Society possesses parallel reproductions. It is from the latter that the illustrative Photograph has been derived.\nthe identificatory legends of which almost uniformly followed the Eastern type of the concurrent systems of writing. I had scarcely, however, arranged my materials for the elucidation of this branch of the enquiry, when I was called upon to return to the scene of more important avocations; but desiring that the various Antiquarian remains I had succeeded in bringing together should be placed at the disposal of those who might, perchance, have both greater leisure and ability to do justice to the study, I published a cursory notice, pretending to be little more than an introductory explanation of the contents of the three plates of gem and other legends already prepared, which figure in the thirteenth volume of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe leading object of the present notice, as confessedly preliminary and tentative as its predecessors, is to draw the attention of resident European officials or chance travellers in the East to an elaborate biliteral inscription, originally engraved along the face of the terrace of the Fire Temple at P\u0101\u2019i K\u016bl\u012b\u00b9 (lat. 35\u00b0 7' 16\" N., long. 45\u00b0 34' 35\" E.), eye transcripts of which were made, under considerable disadvantages, by Sir H. Rawlinson and Mr. Hector in 1844, and from whose pencil facsimiles the modernized version now printed has been derived.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson describes the present condition of the engraved slabs as anything but promising for the acquisition of a full and complete copy of the ancient writings. The inscribed stones, which formed the terrace-wall supporting the edifice, are stated to have become displaced, and to have mostly rolled down the slope of the hill at hazard, so that their relative continuity would with difficulty be re-established, even if in the majority of cases the beginnings and ends of the lines of each block had not seemingly suffered extensive damage and abrasion. But, with all this, there is so\n\n\u00b9 \"At the northern extremity of the district of Zoh\u0101b is the little plain of Sem\u012br\u0101m, a natural fastness of the most extraordinary strength, which is formed by a range of lofty and precipitous mountains extending in a semicircle from the river Diy\u0101l\u0101h, here called the 'Abi-Shirw\u0101n, and enclosing an area of about eight miles in length and four in breadth.\" . . . \"I searched eagerly for ancient monuments, and though I failed to discover any in the plain itself, yet across the river, at a distance of about three farsakhs, on the road to Suleim\u0101nfyah, I heard of sculptures and statues which would well merit the attention of any future traveller in this country. The place is called P\u0101\u2019ikal\u2019ah, the foot of the castle, or But Kh\u0101mah, the idol temple,\"\u2014Rawlinson, Jour. R. Geog. Soc., ix. pp. 28\u201330.\nmuch to excite interest in the broken sections we are already in possession of, that I confidently make the appeal to those who may happen to be in a position to improve our existing copies by means of photography, impressions, rubbings, new hand-tracings, or, better still, by intelligent transcripts in modern Pehlvi\u2014for aid in the cause, towards which the portions of the text, now printed, will contribute something in the way of a first proof; and for the encouragement otherwise of future Pal\u00e6ographers, we may hope that, under a closer examination, the duplicate legends may aid each other both in defective passages and in the correction of the present disjointed order of sequence: while, as the first investigation was necessarily hasty, new discoveries of materials may happily reward more deliberate explorers, even as we can now appeal to the immense advance upon the imperfect transcripts of Niebuhr and Morier, achieved by the less hurried and amplified facsimiles of M.M. Flandin and Coste.\u00b9\n\nIn order to bring the entire subject under one view, I have collected together all the fragmentary inscriptions of the Sassanid\u00e6 at present known, commencing with those interpreted by De Sacy, which I simply reproduce in their corresponding literal equivalents in modern Hebrew and Persian type. The same course has been pursued with the highly interesting bilingual inscription of Sapor, from H\u00e1j\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d. Sir H. Rawlinson\u2019s unpublished copies of the P\u00e1i K\u00fal\u00ed legends, as well as his improved transcripts of the T\u00e1k-i-Bust\u00e1n epigraphs have, however, been more exactly imitated in modern Pehlvi type, which has been made so far competent to resume its primitive duty by the introduction of three letters of the earlier alphabet, which have been lost in the degraded writing of the extant MSS., and finally a similar plan has been followed in the representation of the legible portions of two long and, for the present, most tantalizing inscriptions of Sapor: artists\u2019 designs of which have\n\n\u00b9 Ker Porter remarks (i. p. 574), M. de Sacy \u201chas followed Niebuhr's copy, which, strange to say, having been made so many years anterior to mine, exhibits an inscription much more defaced than I found it. This may be seen by comparing the large letters in my copy on the drawing with the large letters in M. de Sacy's Greek transcript.\u201d [Mem. sur div Ant. p. 31].\nbeen given in Flandin's great work,\\(^1\\) though I am not aware that any attempt has hitherto been made to decipher or explain these singularly comprehensive documents. I am indebted to the same publication for the unique inscription of Narses, at Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, which, together with the legends from the Royal signets of Varahr\u00e1n Kirm\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h have equally been admitted to the honours of the adapted semblance of their contemporary Pehlvi.\n\nNone of the original drawings or published engravings of the more important inscriptions are sufficiently exact or continuously complete to recommend them for imitation in facsimile engravings, and even the plaster-casts from H\u00e1j\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d, however well they reproduce portions of the associate inscriptions, as exhibited in the Photograph, would not, in their present state, suffice to form an unbroken or perfect copy. The expedient has therefore been again adopted of recognizing these absolute impressions from the sculptured rock as a basis for the construction of standard alphabets of either class. In each case, the best examples of the normal character have been selected from the often-varying outlines of the same letter as fashioned by the local mason, and regard has always been paid to the corresponding outline of the given letter in other monuments of the period, whether lapidary, numismatic, or sigillary. The result has been embodied in the double column of alphabets engraved on wood, arranged with the ordinary type in the accompanying table; and, as in the absence of all other positive examples of lapidary writing, these letters have to play a conspicuous part as representative types of their several pal\u00e6ographic systems, no effort, short of cutting the individual letters, has been spared on my part to secure a true and effective rendering of the special characteristics of each symbol.\n\nThe primary derivation of these alphabets may obviously be traced to Ph\u0153nico-Babylonian teachings. Specimens of that form of writing occur, so to say, in situ, as early as the time\n\n\\(^1\\) Voyage en Perse, M. M.

Let Hieroglyphics and Cuneiform retain their ancient fame; but the question succeeds, as to how close upon their earliest traces did other systems of writing assert themselves, more facile in materials and more suitable for the purposes of commercial and private life than the formal sculptured figures of the Egyptian temples, or the complicated arrow-headed syllabary of Mesopotamian Palaces, which latter mechanism, however, in its transitional variations, so firmly retained popular favour in virtue of its applicability to the ever-ready clay, the comparative indestructibility of which had been established by many ages of local use.\u00b9\n\nEgyptologers, on their part, concede a very archaic date for the use of parallel systems of writing, and the age of Phoenician, with our present information, need no longer be narrowed within the limits defined by its surviving monuments, the majority of which must be held to have disappeared with the perishable material chiefly used for their reception. It it is clear that some form of Ph\u0153nician, constituting a kind of current hand, was in official use under the Assyrian kings, as the authoritative definition of the lion-weights in the letters of that alphabet sufficiently declares; and we are further justified in assuming, in all cases where two Scribes are represented in the royal sculptures, that in intentional contrast to the Cuneiform manipulator, the second amanuensis, who uses a reed and a parchment\n\n\u00b9 Rawlinson, J.R.A.S. x, pp. 32, 340, and vol. i.

Mr. Layard, in his admirable description of his own discoveries at Koyunjuk, interested his readers in an unusual degree by an account of the still surviving association of the hieroglyphic signet of Subaco, with that of the Assyrian king on a lump of clay, which was supposed to have formed the connecting attestation of the less permanent substance upon which some royal treaty or compact had been engrossed. In the same closet were found several impressions of smaller seals on suitably-sized bits of clay, which at the time attracted no attention; these, however, on closer scrutiny, seem to bear four varying letters, which can scarcely represent anything but ancient Ethiopian characters; at least two, if not three out of the four letters are readily identifiable with certain corresponding characters of the modern alphabets.\\(^1\\) It is not necessary, for the purpose of proving the currency of this form of writing, that we should be able to detect any of the leading names, either of Subaco, his relatives, or ministers. The importance of the identification consists in the very unexpected determination of the definite antiquity of the writing of the Ethiopian and cognate nationalities, and the very close bearing this date has upon the alphabetical schemes of the\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Layard\u2019s account of the discovery of these seals is as follows:\u2014\u201cIn a chamber or passage [leading into the archive chamber] in the south-west corner of the palace of Kouyunjik, were found a large number of pieces of fine clay bearing the impressions of seals, which, there is no doubt, had been affixed, like modern official seals of wax, to documents written on leather, papyrus, or parchment. Such documents, with seals of clay still attached, have been discovered in Egypt, and specimens are still preserved in the British Museum. The writings themselves have been consumed by the fire which destroyed the building or had perished from decay. In the stamped clay, however, may still be seen the holes for the string or strips of skin by which the seal was fastened; in some instances the ashes of the string itself remain, with the marks of the fingers and thumb. The greater part of these seals are Assyrian; but with them are others bearing Egyptian, Ph\u0153nician, and doubtful symbols and characters. But the most remarkable and important of the Egyptian seals are two impressions of a royal signet, which, though imperfect, retain the cartouche, with the name of the king, so as to be perfectly legible. It is one well known to Egyptian scholars as that of the second Sabaco, the \u00c6thiopian of the twenty-fifth dynasty. On the same\nIndian Ethiopians,\u00b9 and the kindred nations to the southeastward, in which many points of constructive identity have already been recognized.\n\npiece of clay is impressed an Assyrian seal, with a device representing a priest ministering before the king, probably a royal signet.\"\n\nThe annexed woodcut outlines represent six of the Ethiopian seals, copied from the extant clay-impressions of the original signets, that have survived both \"Nineveh and Babylon.\" My object in this, and I trust in all similar cases, is not to force identities, but to place before my fellow labourers coincidences that may perchance elicit new truths. It is not pretended that the literal symbols here found associated with Egyptian hieroglyphics and Assyrian cuneiform will tally or accord exactly with the transmutations incident to the alphabetical developments of the once powerful, but for many centuries obscure, nationalities that in the interval must have remained more than ordinarily indebted to the advancing world around them. Under this latitude of identification, we may freely appeal to the later forms of Ethiopic, Amharic, or other cognate conservators of traces of the ancient writing, though it is more to the general palaeographic configuration than to absolute and complete uniformity of outline that any test must be applied.\n\nIt may be said in regard to the seals now presented, that they convey in all but five independent letters; the most marked of the number is the , which occurs with sufficient clearness on three occasions. There can be little hesitation in associating this form with the modern Himyaritic sh or the Ethiopian sh, especially when the subjunct vowel i is added, which is so distinctly seen in a varied form, even under possible repetition, in the ancient example.\n\nThe second figure of special mark is the , which offers a more dubious range of identification among the derivative Ethiopic forms of bi, b\u00eb, extending even to the Amharic kha, and many other possible renderings; but the most curious coincidence is in the near connection of the sign with the Sanskrit of Northern India (Prinsep's Essays, ii. p. 40, pl. xxxviii.).\n\nThe third character, which almost seems to have been in a transition stage at the time these seals were fashioned, may be reduced in the modern alphabets to the Ethiopic ta or ma; but of the prevailing coincidences of formation under the general Ethiopic scheme there can be little question.\n\nThe imperfect outline , which recurs on four occasions, may be an Amharic j\u00e0, or other consonantal combination of j, with a different vowel: an approximate likeness is also to be detected to the Coptic j; or the old figure may, perchance, constitute the prototype of the modern Himyaritic m.\n\n\u00b9 Herodotus, ii. 94; vii. 70.

The seemingly more archaic structure of the Chaldaeo-Pehlvi clearly carried with it the reminiscence of Babylonian teachings, in which the formation of the letters was largely influenced by the obvious facilities of delineation. The ancient scribes of the Assyrian sculptures are represented as making use of a reed, or other description of pen, with which they wrote upon a flexible leather or parchment scroll, employing the indicator or, possibly, the first and second fingers of the left hand, to support the material at the point of contact of the pen in the ordinary line of writing; under these conditions the most obvious tendency would be towards down strokes, and thus it is found that almost every letter of Sargon's Phoenician consists primarily of a more or less perpendicular line, the minor discriminations being effected by side strokes more varied in construction but of less thickness and prominence; as time went on, the practice developed itself of forming as many letters as possible after one and the same process of manipulation, the essential difference between the characters being marked by scarcely perceptible variations in the leading design; hence arose the perplexing result of the general sameness and uniformity, and consequent difficulty of recognition of the imperfectly contrasted letters so marked in Chaldaeo-Pehlvi, and still so troublesome in modern Hebrew.\n\nThe course followed by the pen in the Chaldaeo-Pehlvi\n\n\\(^1\\) Parthian coin of Sanabares, dated 313 (A.D. 2), in the British Museum, with a Parthian \\(D\\) and a Sassanian \\(a\\) on the obverse field.

Arsaces XXX.\ncaligraphy was singularly repetitive, starting from a given point at the top of the line of writing, it proceeded slightly downwards with a backward sweep, more or less prolonged; from this angle the characteristic perpendicular curve commenced, to be supplemented by the concluding turn of the pen which so often constituted the effective definition of the value of the letter. This formation is followed in the letters \ud802\udf60, \ud802\udf61, \ud802\udf62, and less obviously in \ud802\udf63. The letters \ud802\udf60, \ud802\udf61, and \ud802\udf62 commence with similar leading lines, but have discriminating marks added by a second application of the pen; in like manner \ud802\udf63 is distinguished from \ud802\udf64 by a separate foot crescent, a sign which finds its parallel in the dot of the Syriac \u0700. The remaining letters also had much in common, but in these instances the initial point of the character was thrown slightly backwards on the head-line of the writing, and the down-stroke proceeded more abruptly, finishing with a minute and nearly uniform curve to the left; under this heading may be classed the simple forms \u0700 and \u0700, and the combined outlines \ud802\udf60, \ud802\udf61, \ud802\udf62 (\ud802\udf60), \ud802\udf63, and \u0700. Even the letter \ud802\udf64 probably consisted originally of an inclined duplication of the \u0700, with a prolonged foot-line connecting the two down-strokes. The single exception to the descending curves is afforded by the letter \u0700, which must be supposed to have been constructed like the upward arch of the associate \ud802\udf60, which in the Syriac \u0718\u0710\u0719 grew into a round \u0718, the Chaldeo-Pehlvi form of which, passing through the Sassanian \u0719, finally settled itself into the Arabic \u0719.\n\nThe variation in the configuration of the letters of the Sassanian Pehlvi, as compared with its fellow alphabet of more determined Semitic aspect, may be attributed to the simple action of a different method of manipulation, involving a less restrained movement of the hand, and greater freedom in the onward or backward sweep of the pen than was compatible with the conventional restrictions of the caligraphy of Western Asia. There is every reason to believe that the ancient races to the east of the Tigris, in common with the partially civilized populations ranging over Central Asia and the Himalayas, very early in the world\u2019s history, appreciated\nthe utility of birch-bark, and, even in the infancy of letters,\\(^1\\) its applicability to the purposes of writing would readily have suggested itself. At all events, we have direct and independent evidence of its use in Afgh\u00e1nistan some centuries B.C.,\\(^2\\) and we can cite very credible and unconstrained testimony to the fact that much of the sacred literature of the Ancient Persians was engrossed upon this substance;\\(^3\\) con-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) To show how forms of writing in early times must have been determined by circumstances and accessible materials, it may be noted that even so late as the days of Muhammad, when there were civilized teachers from the many nations around them, the Arabs had still to engross the stray sayings of their Prophet upon stones and other strange and readily available substances. Sir Wm. Muir tells us, \"after each passage was recited by Muhammad before the Companions or followers who happened to be present, it was generally committed to writing by some one amongst them upon palm-leaves, leather, stones, or such other rude material as conveniently came to hand.\" Life of Mahomet.

This portion of the Pehlvi text is admitted to have been added and incorporated only on the final rearrangement of the scattered materials of the ancient books. Nor does Dr. Haug himself seem quite satisfied with his own interpretation, which, considering the degraded character of the text, is scarcely to be wondered at.\n\n1. \"The book 'Dinkard' is a book on the religion, that people may obtain (a knowledge of) the good religion.

Certain it is that to this day, among the Bhoteahs and other natives of the Himalaya, birch-bark maintains its ancient uses, and many a petition and other documents engrossed on its surface find their way among the \"stamped papers\" and the like civilized records of the Courts of the British Government in those mountains. It is then to the enhanced freedom of penmanship incident to the employment of birch-bark that I am disposed to attribute the leading peculiarities of this style of writing. The material in question secured to the amanuensis an unchecked power of forming curves and an unrestrained action of the pen in any given direction; but its ultimate effect upon the identity of the Sassanian character was mainly due to the gift of continuous onward movement in the line of writing, which eventually developed itself into the Kufic scheme, where a single line drawn from right to left constituted the basis of the entire alphabet in its conjunct form,\\(^1\\) and the innate contrast between the two styles of writing maintains itself to the last, and may be detected at the present day in the pervading descending stroke of the Hebrew finals, and in the prolonged sweep, in the general line of writing, of certain Arabic terminal letters; while, under the larger and more comprehensive view of the same question, we may trace in the contrasted formation and relative location of the short vowels, a practical and conclusive illustration of the original caligraphic type of either system.\n\nThe ruling ideal of this Pehlvi scheme of writing proceeded upon a groundwork of curves, the leading model of which declares itself in the letter \\(z\\), which commenced towards the top of the general line of writing, being extended slightly upward and continued backwards and downwards,\n\n\\(^1\\) I do not know whether the singular identity of the employment of a central leading-line, in our own Oghams, has as yet been the subject of notice.\nafter the fashion of a reversed Roman C. This formation enters more or less into the composition of the letters \u0686, \u0698, \u062f, \u0633, \u0634, \u06a9, \u0644, \u0645, \u0648, \u06cc, and \u06cc long. In process of time, as the writing became more cursive, the initial point of the \u06cc, and of those letters which more immediately followed its tracing, was thrown higher up and further back in the ordinary line, while the concluding turn of the curve was prolonged and occasionally run into other letters. The single character in this alphabetical series that was discriminated in its final form, from its normal initial or medial representative, was the short \u06cc; and the manner in which this was effected would almost imply that it was intended in the very act to check the onward flow of the writing in the way of an upward stop, as the final was made to commence even below the middle of the horizontal line of letters and the concluding point of the three-quarters of a circle was not allowed to reach the ordinary foot lines [\u06f2].\n\nIt remains for me to notice more particularly a few of the letters of either alphabet with reference to their derivation and values, and their relative bearing upon the corresponding signs of other systems. First in order presents itself the independently-organized symbol for ch, a letter of considerable importance in Aryan tongues, but which the Greeks and Romans, in servilely following Semitic originals, so strangely failed to provide a literal representative for. The Chaldaeo-Pehlvi contented itself with a like deficiency, and supplied the place of the ch by sh. The Sassanian character \u0686 ch was clearly based upon the \u0686 h of its own alphabetical scheme, the additional power being given by the foot-stroke backwards, which was one of the leading peculiarities of this style of writing. The letter in its adapted form bears a faint, but not impossibly an intentional, resemblance to the Bactrian \u0686 ch.\n\nThe Sassanian alphabet, again, is itself defective in the Semitic aspirate \u06af kh, which the Greeks converted into \u0397, a sound that fell short of the compound \u06af hu in Sassanian,\nwhich was, perhaps, the best equivalent that the latter writing admitted of. It is to be remarked that, in spite of Indian influences, the Bactrian \\(kh\\) itself did not, for some time, assume a very definite or constant form.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe greatest obstacle, without any exception, to a satisfactory and positive interpretation of the early Sassanian inscriptions is incident to the inconvenient identity of the sign which has to answer for the sounds both of \\(r\\) and \\(w\\). The Chaldaeo-Pehlvi forms of \\(r\\) and \\(w\\), like the Bactrian \\(r\\) and \\(v\\), have something in common, and the association survives in the modern Hebrew \\(r\\), \\(v\\); but in all these cases there is a distinct, though not very marked, means of discrimination. Whereas, in the Sassanian-Pehlvi, there is not only no aid to the determination of whether the symbol \\(2\\) stands for \\(r\\) or \\(w\\); but in many cases, where it is clearly the former, it has often to be read by the light of modern interpretation, as \\(J\\). Moreover, whenever two of these signs occur together, thus \\(22\\) they present all the above alternatives, and, in addition, may chance to represent an oft-recurring malformation of the letter \\(2\\) due either to imperfect execution in the original, or, more frequently, to faulty copying by the modern draftsman; but in some cases the double \\(22\\) constitutes the authorised and constant formation of the \\(w\\), altogether apart from any possible errors of original designers, contemporary engravers, or travellers from the West, who have in later days made these inscriptions known to us. The alphabet had not yet arrived at the equally perplexing transformation whereby the letters \\(w\\) and \\(n\\) came to hold a single literal representative in common in the \\(=w\\) and \\(=n\\) of the Arabico-Pehlvi coins and modern MSS. writing;\\(^2\\) but this latter, the \"grand Schiboleth du Pehlvie\" of Joseph M\u00fcller,\\(^3\\) is far\n\n\\(^1\\) Prinsep's Essays, ii. 147.\n\n\\(^2\\) The eventual complication or conglomeration of signs under which the \\(2\\) as \\(w\\) fell into community and association with the symbol \\(I\\), the ancient \\(w\\), is still an enigma; but as it does not come within the range of the writing of the Sassanian Inscriptions, I commend it to the attention of those who still find a difficulty in reconciling the Parsi \"Anhoma\" with the proper Anharmma of earlier date. (See, for instance, Oim Yak, p. xxvii.)\n\n\\(^3\\) Journal Asiatique, 1839. \"Essai sur la langue Pehlvie.\" J.R.A.S. xii. 269.\nless obstructive in practice than the earlier association of r and w. In order to meet this peculiarity in the Sassanian writing, I have had the letter 2 cut in fac-simile and prepared for use with the modern Pehlvi type.\n\nThe s of the joint alphabets demands a passing comment, as in its near identity in both systems, and the complete dissimilarity of either outline to any archaic or other derivative form of the letter in Ph\u0153nician, it would seem that its origin must be sought for elsewhere; it is singular that the Bactrian symbol for \u00a7 in 250 b.c. \u03a0 (in Aryan Indian \u03a0), and the Armenian correspondent of s \u03b4 in b.c. 189, should so nearly accord, and that their general formation should be preserved so completely in the Pehlvi alphabets of the Sassanians. The following are the gradational representatives of each class \u03a0 \u03a0 \u03a0 \u03a0. The concluding example is taken from the Sassanian section of the H\u00e1ji\u00e1b\u00e1d sculpture, and its configuration is aptly illustrative of the method in which the normal letter was formed, namely, by a second application of the pen to the leading design. In the present instance the body of the character is composed of the often-recurring z with a reduced z supplemented to it. The accelerated penmanship of more practised scribes gradually transformed the letter first into \u03a8 and eventually into \u03a8 and \u03a8, whence it finally progressed into the Pehlvi \u03c8, the Zend \u03c8, and the Arabic \u03c8.\n\nI have still to advert to two very serious difficulties in the decipherment of these alphabets; the one dependent upon the great similarity existing between the signs for e and z in the Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi, which often renders them hopelessly indistinguishable; this is the case even in the positive reproduction of the inscription at H\u00e1ji\u00e1b\u00e1d, so it may be imagined what amount of reliance is to be placed upon the drawings of mere copyists. As a general rule the letter e is simple and direct in its downward course, while the z is more curved in its sweep, and more marked in the initial and final points.\n\nThe second obstruction to assured interpretation consists more in the oral sound to be attributed to the several letters 2 = r and \u03b2 = l in the Sassanian writing. At times it would\nseem that these letters were knowingly used indifferently; on other occasions ignorance of or insensibility to the true force of the Semitic may have prevailed; though in some instances, again, discrimination in their contrasted employment is evident, especially in words in which a complication already exists, arising out of the community of the sounds of r and w inherent in their common sign \\( \\text{\u0632} \\). If, in addition to these constructive difficulties, we add the imperfect phonetic aptitude or the want of system in the use of the symbols for \\( \\text{\u062f} \\) and \\( \\text{\u062a} \\), \\( \\text{\u06af} \\) and \\( \\text{\u06a9} \\); and more important than all, the authorised dialectic interchange of \\( \\text{\u0628} \\), \\( \\text{\u067e} \\) (\\( \\text{\u0641} \\)), and \\( \\text{\u0648} \\), \\( \\text{\u0648} \\), we have offered a goodly list of reasons why European interpreters have made such scant progress in Pehlvi readings.\n\nOne of the most curious questions in the whole range of this enquiry is presented in the history of that strangely influential vowel in the Persian tongue, the letter \\( \\text{i} \\); we have already seen the important part played by the normal form of that character in the supplementary definition of the concurrent signs of the Chaldeo-Pehlvi, and attention has been drawn to a somewhat parallel fundamental influence exercised by the typical curve of the Sassanian \\( \\text{i} \\), among the other letters of its own alphabet; it is further clear that neither of the very differently-fashioned letters of the joint Pehlvi systems of writing can be referred to corresponding Semitic originals as the latter are ordinarily determined; all of which adhere with more or less fidelity to a vague reminiscence of the archaic \\( \\text{\u0646} \\). A singular evidence of the community of Aryanism in alphabets suggests itself in these facts, though I am not prepared to claim any Noachian antiquity for the coincidence, but merely desire to show that the various branches of the Aryan pastoral races, as they are known to the modern world, only began to understand and appreciate the value of\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u062a\u064a\u0647\u0627\u062a-\u0641\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a-\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0643}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u062a\u064a\u0647\u0627\u062a-\u0641\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a-\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0643}\n\\]\n\nIt is a curious fact that all the early Numismatic legends use \\( \\text{\u0632} \\) both for r and w. \\( \\text{\u0632} \\) does not appear till later, and then only irregularly.

Fran\u00e7ois Lenormant has devoted a lengthy article in the Journal Asiatique of Ao\u00fbt-Septembre, 1865 (pp. 180\u2013226), to \"\u00c9tudes Pal\u00e9ographiques sur l'Alphabet Pehlevi, ses diverses vari\u00e9t\u00e9s et son origine,\" in which he has done me the honour to quote largely from my first paper on Pehlvi writing which appeared in the twelfth volume of this Journal, 1849, as well as from a parallel notice on Arsacidan coins, etc., inserted in the Numismatic Chronicle of proximate date, without seemingly having been aware of the publication of my second contribution on the same subject, which was printed in our Journal for 1852 (vol. xiii. p. 373). M. Lenormant has not been altogether fortunate in the passages\nattended the maturation of this literal sign in the parallel alphabet, which, though in the retention of its primitive forms, claiming so much more of a Semitic aspect, provided itself, from other sources, with a short \\( z \\), and lost all trace of the proper Semitic \\( \\aleph \\) of Sargon\u2019s time, and hence had to invent anew the long \\( i \\) required for the due expression of the language it was eventually called upon to embody. The process by which this was effected is instructive, and may be said, in its\n\nof my Essay which he has selected for adverse criticism,\u2014a licence, however, I must confess he has been wisely chary of indulging in.\n\nM. Le Normant is mistaken in supposing that Sir H. Rawlinson ever designed to insert a long \\( \\aleph \\) final in the word Baga, so that his over-officious attempt at correction, in this instance, proves altogether superfluous (J.R.A.S. x. pp. 93, 94, 187), but the implication, in the general run of the text, is, that I myself had attributed this error to Sir Henry, which I certainly never contemplated doing, nor, as far as I can gather from anything I have printed, did I give any colour for a supposition that I desired so to do (J.R.A.S. xii. 264; Numismatic Chronicle, xii. 74). Sir Henry undoubtedly suggested that the group of letters ordinarily following the king\u2019s titles in the Sassanian coin legends and inscriptions should be resolved into the letters \\( b \\), \\( g \\), and hence he inferred, most correctly, that the term in question was Baga, divine (Sanskrit \u092d\u0917), supposing that, in the ordinary course of Aryan tongues, the several consonants optionally carried the inherent short vowel \\( a \\). My correction merely extended to the separation of the character composing the second portion of the group into the since universally accepted \\( g \\), \\( i \\).\n\nM. Lenormant has gone out of his way to assert that \u201cLe savant anglais a pr\u00e9tendu, en effet, que le pehlevi ne poss\u00e9dait pas de \\( D \\).\u201d This is not quite an accurate statement of the case. If I had not recognised the existence and frequent use of an \\( s \\), which letter duly appears in my alphabets (J.R.A.S. xii. pl. i.), I could have made but very little progress in Pehlvi decipherments. The question I did raise with regard to the origin of the earliest form of the Sassanian \\( s \\) (xii. 266), as found in the H\u00e1j\u00edtab\u00e1d sculptures, was not only perfectly legitimate and fairly and frankly stated, but there is even now no resisting the associate facts that the Chaldee-Pehlvi version of Inscription No. vi. infr\u00e0, makes use of the \\( l \\) in the penultimate of \\( \\text{\u0628\u0644\u0627} \\), and that the corresponding \\( s \\) of the Sassanian text \\( \\text{\u0628\u0644\u0627} \\) is susceptible of being resolved into the typical elements of \\( \\text{\u0628\u0644\u0627} \\). Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the Chaldee-Pehlvi \\( D \\) was still unidentified, though I even then suggested the attribution which has since thrown new light upon the entire question (N.C. xii. 78). In short, the point of interest at that time was to determine the course and progress of the discrimination and graphic expression of the approximate sounds of \\( z \\) and \\( s \\) in the alphabets under discussion.\n\nAs regards my proposed rectification of M. De Sacy\u2019s \\( \\text{\u0628\u0644\u0627} \\) in \\( \\text{\u0628\u0644\u0627} \\) Boman, which M. Lenormant confidently designates as \u201cinutilement contest\u00e9 par M. Edward Thomas\u201d (J.A. p. 193), I am sanguine that the ample data adduced below will satisfy more severe critics that the mistaken interpretation M. Lenormant insists upon sharing, in common with so many of Anquetil\u2019s ancient errors, may be safely left to find its own correction.\n\nFinally, I am bound to place on record a distinct protest against the general accuracy of M. Lenormant\u2019s illustrative facsimiles. I imagined, in the first instance, that the French artist had reproduced in a crude and clumsy way the conscientious originals of the English engraver; but I see that M. Lenormant claims whatever credit is due upon that score for himself, in the declaration, \u201cnous avons relev\u00e9 nous-m\u00eame les figures que nous donnons sur les pl\u00e2tres offerts \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique de Londres par M. Rawlinson\u201d (J.A. p. 188).\nvery mechanism, to add an independent proof of the true value attaching to the fellow character \u03c1. The configuration of the \u03c1 clearly proceeded upon the duplication of the simple or short i (i); and in order to avoid the possible confusion of the new compound with the ordinary \u03c1 a concluding curve was carried upwards and backwards from the second i through its own down-stroke and into the leading letter.\n\nIn course of time both these double letters disappear from public documents, but the Sassanian letter is preserved in the Parsi alphabet,\u00b9 and is but little changed in its Zend form \u03c1. While the short i was subjected to considerable modifications, till, on the Arabico-Pehlvi coins it appears as \u03c1 in its independent definition, or in the latest introductory stage towards the Naskhi \u201cKasrah-i-Iz\u00e1fat.\u201d\n\nAs regards the true force of the fellow letters, though we may, for simplicity sake, designate them as long or double i\u2019s, it is clear that the duty they had to perform in the less matured orthography of the third century A.D. will be represented by a very extended range of optional transcriptions when reduced into the elaborated characters of the present day, leaving the Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi letters to answer for their parallel power in the double \u03c1. The Sassanian counterpart must clearly be admitted to stand, according to the context, for \u064a, \u064a, \u064a, \u064a or \u064a, and their several medial correspondents.\n\nAn apt illustration of the difficulty the limited characters of the Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi had to contend with in the definition of the mixed Aryan and Semitic speech they had to respond to, has lately been contributed, on the occasion of the natives of Persia having been called upon to reconstruct an alphabet suitable for the expression of their modern tongue out of the self-same literal elements they had abandoned so many cen-\n\n\u00b9 Spiegel, Grammatik der P\u00e2rsisprache.

The excellent series of Numismatic Ph\u0153nician was cut for the Duc de Luynes, for the illustration of his work on the Satrapies. The outlines are chiefly derived from the forms of the Ph\u0153nician alphabet in use on the coins of Cilicia and Cyprus.\n\nThe old Syriac may be useful in the present instance among the associated Pehlvi alphabets for the purposes of comparison, in its near proximity in point of date and local employment. This font was prepared under the supervision of the late Dr. Cureton, whose account of the sources from whence it was derived is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"It was principally copied from MSS. of the sixth century, and represents the earliest form of the character known to us. It is identical with that of the most ancient MS. in the British Museum\u2014date A.D. 411; but the forms of the letters are made a little more carefully than they were written by the person who copied that MS., and imitate more closely those of some better scribe, although about a century later.\"\n\nThe modern Pehlvi was engraved by Marcellin Legrand of Paris, under the direct superintendence of M. Jules Mohl, and to my understanding offers the best and closest imitation of the ancient writing as yet produced. I have so far departed from the primary intention of the designers as to employ the letter \u1e0d, to which they had assigned the value of a kh, as the more appropriate representative of the simple h, in order to avoid the confusion incident to the use of the unpointed \u1e0d, which in the original scheme was called upon to do duty indifferently for either a or h.\nIn order to complete the alphabetical illustrations connected with the later history of Sassanian writing, I append a comparative table of the Pehlvi and Zend characters, which in itself demonstrates the direct derivation of the latter series from its more crude model, and enables us to trace the amplification and elaboration of the earlier literal forms to meet the wants of the more refined grammar of the Zend, a reconstruction which seems to have been aided by the high degree of perfection already reached in the alphabetical definitions of cognate Aryan languages.\n\n**PEHLVI AND ZEND ALPHABETS.**\n\n### VOWELS.\n\n| Short Vowels, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| a                     | a    |\n| i                     | i    |\n| u                     | u    |\n\n| Long Vowels, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|---------------------|------|\n| ai                  | \u00e1    |\n| i                   | i    |\n| \u00fa                   | \u00e9    |\n| \u00e9                   | \u00e9    |\n\n### CONSONANTS.\n\n| Gutturals, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|--------------------|------|\n| k                  | kh   |\n| hu                 | q    |\n| g                  | gh   |\n\n| Palatals, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|------------------|------|\n| ch               | ch   |\n| j                 | j    |\n\n| Dentals, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|-----------------|------|\n| t                | th   |\n| d                | dh   |\n\n| Labials, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|-----------------|------|\n| p                | f    |\n| b                | b    |\n\n| Semi-Vowels, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|---------------------|------|\n| i or y              | r    |\n| (med.) y            | r    |\n| v or w              | h    |\n| (med.) v            | h    |\n\n| Sibilants, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|-------------------|------|\n| s                 | sh   |\n| z                 | z    |\n\n| Nasals, Pehlvi | Zend |\n|----------------|------|\n| n               | n    |\n| an              | \u011f    |\n| m               | m    |\nInscription No. 1.\n\nThe first inscription of the series under review is engraved upon the most prominent of the Sassanian sculptures at Naksh-i-Rustam, wherein Ormazd is represented as bestowing a second or Imperial cydaris upon Ardashir Babekan on the occasion of his final victory over the last of the Arsacid\u00e6, whose prostrate body is exhibited on the battle field beneath the feet of the equestrian group, and whose individuality is distinctly marked by the snake-crested helmet of the Mede.

No. 1). Ormazd is frequently represented in other compositions amid these sculptures. For instance, in plate 44, Flandin, at Firuzabad, where he again appears in the act of presenting a cydaris to Ardashir. This bas relief is remarkable for the subsequent addition of a modern Pehlvi legend, which is only dubiously intelligible in Flandin's copy. Ormazd is depicted in a new and modified form in the bas-relief at Tak-i-Bustan (pl. lxvi. Ker Porter, vol. ii.; Malcolm's Persia, vol. i. p. 259; and pl. 14, Flandin, vol. i.), where he is introduced as apparently sanctioning the final abdication of Ardashir and the transfer of the Sassanian diadem to Sapor.* Ormazd in this case stands at the back of the former monarch, with his feet resting on a lotus flower; he holds the peculiar baton or sceptre in the usual position, but this time with both hands; and instead of the hitherto unvarying mural crown, the head seems uncovered, but closely bound with the conventional diadem, with its broad pendant fillets, while the head itself is encircled with rays of glory, after the Western idea of a nimbus.\u2020\n\n* The association of Sapor in the government, or perhaps only his recognition as heir apparent, is illustrated by the coins of the period.

Chron. xiv. p. 181.\n\n\u2020 A similar form is given to Ormazd's head-gear in the coin of Hormisdas II., quoted p. 42 post.\nhis right he extends towards the conqueror a circlet, to which are attached the broad wavy ribbons so exaggerated in their dimensions at this period.\n\nArdeshir wears a close-fitting skull-cap shaped helmet, from the centre of which ascends a globe-like balloon, which is supposed to typify some form of fire or other equivalent of our Western halo. The head-piece is encircled with a diadem, from which depend the Dynastic flowing fillets, and the helmet is completed for defensive purposes by cheek-plates and a sloping back-plate. The beard seems to have been injured if we are to trust Ker Porter's copy; but Flandin represents it as ending in a tied point, a fashion seemingly only introduced by Sapor. The hair is disarranged, possibly to indicate the recent combat. The remaining details of the sculpture are unimportant in their bearing upon the present inquiry, but it must be noted that the inscriptions, in either case, are cut upon the shoulder of the horse bearing the figure each of the triple legends are designed to indicate, so that there can be no possible doubt about the identification of the persons, or the intentional portraiture of the contrasted divinity and king; the former of which is of peculiar interest in disclosing the existing national ideal of the form and external attributes of Ormazd, so distinctly defined as \"the god of the Arians\" by Darius himself in his celebrated Cuneiform record at Behistun, iv. 12, 13 (J.R.A.S. xv. 130, 144),\n\nThe style of the legend embodying the monarch's titles, though tinged with ever-prevailing Oriental hyperbole, is modest in regard to the extent of his dominions, which are confined to Ir\u00e1n proper; and the like reserve is maintained in the epigraphs upon both Ardeshir's money, and many, if not all, of Sapor's coins;\u00b9 though the inscriptions at P\u0101i K\u016bl\u012b, if they are found hereafter to have emanated from the founder of the dynasty, about which there may still be some vague doubt\u2014would seem to prove that the An Ir\u00e1n, or countries other than Ir\u00e1n, in modern speech, associated as Ir\u00e1n and\n\n\u00b9 Varahran I. seems to have been the first to record the An ir\u00e1n on his currency, but want of space in the field of the coins may well have counselled previous omissions.\nTur\u00e1n, had already been comprehended in Ardesh\u00edr\u2019s later conquests.\n\nInscription No. 1.\u2014Ardesh\u00edr, Babek, A.D. 226, at Naksh-i-Rustam.\n\nI is a transliteration, in modern Hebrew letters, of the original Chaldaeo-Pehlevi Lapidary Text.\nII is a transliteration, in modern Persian characters, of the associate Sassanian-Pehlevi Text.\nIII is a transcript of the original Greek translation, which is appended to the duplicate Oriental epigraphs.\n\n\\[ \\text{\u05d4\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05d6\u05d3\u05d9\u05d0\u05df \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05de\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0zm} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{\u067e\u062a\u06a9\u0631\u06cc \u0632\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0632\u062f\u06cc\u0633 \u0628\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u062a\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{III. \u03a4\u039f\u03a4\u03a4\u039f \u03a4\u039f \u03a0\u03a1\u039f\u03a3\u03a9\u03a0\u039f\u039d \u039c\u0391\u03a3\u0394\u0391\u03a3\u0395\u039d\u039f\u03a4 \u0398\u0395\u039f\u03a5 \u0391\u03a1\u03a4\u0391\u03a7\u03a3\u03a1\u039f\u03a5 \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{\u039c\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u0397\u03a1 \u039c\u039d \u0399\u039f\u03a4\u0397\u039d \u0392\u03a1\u0399 \u0391\u039b\u0397\u0391 \u03a0\u0391\u039d\u0393\u03a1 \u039c\u039b\u039a\u0391} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{\u039c\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u0397\u03a4\u03a1\u0399 \u039c\u039d \u0399\u0396\u03a4\u0391\u039d \u0392\u03a1\u0399 \u0392\u0393\u0399 \u03a0\u0391\u0392\u039a\u0399 \u039c\u039b\u039a\u0391} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u039d \u0391\u03a1\u0399\u0391\u039d\u03a9\u039d \u0395\u039a\u0393\u0395\u03a5\u039f\u03a4\u03a3 \u0398\u0395\u03a9\u039d \u03a4\u0399\u039f\u03a4 \u0398\u0395\u039f\u03a5 \u03a0\u0391\u03a0\u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a4 \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3.} \\]\n\nImage of the person of [Or]mazd-worshipper, divine Artahshatr, King of Kings of Ir\u00e1n, of celestial origin from god, the son of divine P\u0101rak, King!\n\nNo. 1a.\n\n\\[ \\text{\u05d4\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4\u05d5\u05de\u05d3 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d0} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{\u067e\u062a\u06a9\u0631\u06cc \u0632\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0645\u0632\u062f \u0632..\u06cc} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{III. \u03a4\u039f\u03a4\u03a4\u039f \u03a4\u039f \u03a0\u03a1\u039f\u03a3\u03a9\u03a0\u039f\u039d \u0394\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u0398\u0395\u039f\u03a5.} \\]\n\nImage of the person of Ormazd, God!\u00b3\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The debased C = Z, \u03b5 = E, and \u03c9 = \u03a9, of the original inscription, have been replaced by the ordinary modern type forms of the several letters.\n\n\u00b2 The reading of Ormazd\u2019s name in the Chaldaeo-Pehlevi is doubtful in the later copies (De Sacy, p. 27; Ker Porter, Pl. xxiii.; and Flandin, Vol. iv. Pl. 180); but it is obvious, as above given in Flower\u2019s reproduction, A.D. 1667 (Hyde, p. 547); and in Chardin\u2019s facsimile of 1674 (Pl. lxxiii. vol. ii.)\n\n\u00b3 Most of the linguistic details of this, or, perhaps, a less curt translation, have for long past been comparatively uncontested. The Zanii I have not as yet had an opportunity of fairly or fully submitting to public criticism. The Mazd-Ya\u00e7na elements of the compound it has been the custom of late to recognise as \u201cOrmazd-Worshipper,\u201d may perchance require re-examination when discovered to be associated with the full and direct definition of the name of Ormazd, in apparent contrast to the abbreviated form, on one and the same stone. Bagi, with its palpable context of the Semitic Alh\u0101, has from the first been accepted in its true purport, though doubts and difficulties remained in regard to the correct definition of the final gi, which are now, I imagine, fully disposed of. Minu Chatri (and \u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5) were freely interpreted by De Sacy with the aid of the Greek transcript, and all that more recent philology has been called upon to contribute has been the more exact determination of the roots and incidental formation of the compound in the now recognised \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u201cMundus superior,\u201d and the Chitra of such constant recurrence in the Cuneiform inscriptions and in the nominal combinations of the archaic Persian speech.\nInscription No. 2.\n\nThis inscription is engraved on an unfinished tablet, to the left hand, and immediately outside of the area of the bas-relief at Naksh-i-Rajab (Ker Porter, xxvii. No. 2; Flandin, 192 B), embodying one of the many representations of Ardeshir's receiving the cydaris from Ormazd: but there is nothing in the absolute relation of the two sculptures to show that the inscription in question was intended to refer to this particular group of the dynastic memorials graven on the surrounding rocks, though the probabilities are greatly in favour of such a supposition. Ker Porter does not seem to have been aware of the existence of this side compartment;\u00b9 and although Morier\u00b2 alludes to the single figure who is portrayed in the act of engrossing the identical record, he does not appear to have detected the inscription itself. It was left for M. Flandin\u00b3 to repeat, in all innocence, a discovery which, in earlier times, had already been placed on record by Ouseley;\u2074 but to the former artist we are indebted for the only full copy known in Europe, which has evidently been most carefully traced on the spot and elaborately engraved in his work; but however meritorious as a studied and conscientious drawing, it is that and nothing more: had M. Flandin been but in the smallest degree acquainted with the crude forms of the eighteen letters of the alphabet employed in the text, the value of his labours would have been infinitely enhanced, possibly with far less patient toil to himself. As it is, this epigraph, the most full and perfect of the entire series, is disappointing in the extreme; and it is only by very bold guesses (such as no professed savant would adventure), that any recon-\n\n\u00b9 Ker Porter, i. 573.\n\u00b2 Morier, \"Persia, Armenia, etc.\" p. 138.\n\u00b3 Dans le coin \u00e0 gauche, et en haut du rocher, en dehors du cadre o\u00f9 est sculpt\u00e9 le bas-relief, est une figure dont le buste seul a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.

Je crois pouvoir affirmer que cette inscription \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement inconnue, car il n'en est fait mention par aucun voyageur. C'est donc une heureuse d\u00e9couverte, non-seulement pour l'\u00e9tude de la langue pehlvi, mais encore pour l'intelligence de ce monument sur lequel elle jettera certainement un jour nouveau.\u2014Text, vol. ii. p. 135.\n\u2074 \"Travels in Persia in 1810, 1811, 1812.\" vol. ii. pl. xlviii. No. 3.\nstruction of the purport of the original can be extracted from the distorted and disjointed characters in the French publication.\n\nThe inscription seems to have been originally executed in well-defined letters; but as far as M. Flandin's copy enables us to judge, no effort was made towards the separation or division of the words, nor are any of those very useful discriminative final i's to be detected in its lines. A large amount of independent synonyms may, nevertheless, be readily identified, though much concession has to be made for the uncertainty of the orthography of the period, and its manifest and startling contrast to the mode of spelling accepted in modern Persian: and in this consists almost the sole advantage of the inscription at this moment, in that even if one half of the terms now mechanically transcribed may be safely introduced into the meagre vocabulary of Sassanian Pehlvi hitherto authoritatively ascertained as opposed to the dubious and composite infiltrations of the ancient Pehlvi accepted in Bombay, some definite advance in this obscure study will be fairly established. I do not propose to enter into any analysis of this inscription, as I have but little faith in the trustworthiness of the text even in its now partially amended form. I may mention that the modern Pehlvi version here given adheres as scrupulously as possible to the engraved facsimile, while the Persian transcript is avowedly suggestive, and, as such, has been inserted more for the secondary purpose of aiding those who may need an introductory gloss upon the rarely-seen Pehlvi type, rather than for any authority that can be claimed for it. Indeed, in certain cases where the meanings of words were sufficiently obvious, I have departed from the limitation of mere reproduction, and modified the Persian correspondents in defiance of the imperfection of the Pehlvi original, in order to dispense with needless tests and references; but in many instances, where obscure passages recur in the Pehlvi, I have designedly changed the Persian equivalents assigned in the first instance, in the hope that one or the other of the optional modernised versions may hereafter lead to a correct determination of the value of the doubtful constructive elements of this, for the time being, obscure mediaeval text.\nThe most curious question, however, relating to the inscription in its available form is, that in spite of its length and apparent completeness, as well as the free legibility of a portion of its contents, there are no means of determining, with absolute precision, the monarch in whose laudation it was composed. The natural impression suggested by the position in which the epigraph is placed points primarily to Ardeshir Babek\u00e1n, and several times in the text itself lend support to such a conclusion, the word \u06a9\u06cc\u062a\u0648\u0645\u0631, from \u0647\u062f\u06cc\u062f, a crown (in line 27) more immediately connects the inscription with the bas-relief it may be supposed to explain; and, singular to say, it is not at all improbable that the missing name of Ardeshir may after all be hidden amid the obscure cross strokes of the broken letters in the first line of the facsimile, the artistic imperfection of which, however, I have hesitated to correct in my Persian transcript, but which may fairly be converted, with very scant violence to probabilities, into \u0647\u0633\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u06cc\u0631 \u0628\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u062a\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631, a reconstruction that would sufficiently accord with the general tenor of the context, which concludes the current line with the conventional titular \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646.\n\nThe unusual title of Mir Shahinshahi, the latter a term specially affected by Ardeshir, also connects the record with that monarch; as in like manner does the singular designation of \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0627 \u0632\u06cc \u0634\u0647\u067e\u0648\u0631\u0647\u06cc, \u201cKing of the King\u2019s sons,\u201d or what in modern days would be \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0646, a name or title indicative of royal origin, and so directly identified with the family intitulations, that Sapor retained the \u0634\u0647\u067e\u0648\u0631 intact as his Imperial epithet.\n\nOf the ordinary titles occurring in the course of the writing, some are highly instructive in regard to the comparative nomenclature of the period, such as \u0647\u0631\u0628\u0631\u0633\u062a, \u201cfire-worshipper\u201d [priest] (2), \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u06cc\u0631 (23), \u0627\u06cc\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062a (28, 30, 31), \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u062a (28) the Persian synonym\\(^1\\) of the Greek \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, which latter term, however, when quoted from Western sources,\n\n\\(^1\\) The German philologists endeavour to identify the Greek \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 with ishird \u201crobust.\u201d But a more simple association seems to present itself in the various words for fire, Pehlvi \u06cc\u0650\u060c Persian \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u060c Sanskrit \u0907\u0936\u093f\u0930.\nwas transmuted into the aspirated (Inscription V. 4). In addition to which may be cited (24), \u067e\u0627\u062a\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc, \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u0647, etc.\n\nThis inscription, even in its partially intelligible form, is also valuable as exhibiting so many of the essential characteristics of true Persian speech, in the multiplicity of the final i\u2019s, and in the dominance of the inevitable verb \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646, which even in this brief space crops up in all manner of moods and tenses.\n\nThe following passages from the classic authors and other external sources, bearing upon the pompous intitulations affected by the successive ruling dynasties in Persia, are calculated to throw light upon the inquiry more immediately in question, as to the terms likely to be found in the original manifestoes embodied in the court language and composed under official supervision, we have now to deal with.\n\nArsaces I.\n\n\"Certatimque summaturum et vulgi sententias concinentibus, astris (ut ipsi existimant) ritus sui consecratione permistas est omnium primus.

3.\u2014P\u0101\u012b K\u016bl\u012b Inscriptions\u2014Sassanian.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson has most disinterestedly entrusted me with his own private note-books containing his original sketches of the P\u0101\u012b K\u016bl\u012b Inscriptions, as well as with an earlier Cuneiform copy-book, in which I find Mr. Hector\u2019s independent tracings of the epigraphs on four of the slabs.\n\nI have intentionally avoided submitting any of my tentative readings to Sir Henry, as not only has his time been of late fully occupied by more important duties, but I have been anxious that he should not be in the least degree compromised by any of my errors or imperfect interpretations derived from the fragmentary materials he has so amiably supplied me with.\n\n1. The first inscription among Sir Henry Rawlinson\u2019s sectional copies is, perhaps, the most interesting of the whole series, giving, as it does, the name of Ardash\u012br B\u0101bek\u0101n, coupled with his title of King of Kings (\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634\u06cc\u0631). The third line, like so much of the entire text, seems to continue his laudatory intitulation, \u201cof Ir\u0101n King.\u201d The succeeding line proceeds, \u201cLord of the Fire Temple\u201d (on whose terrace the inscription is engraved). The Fram\u0101ta is here seen to retain its place in the official speech from the anterior date of the Cuneiform manifestoes of Darius, while its modern counterpart perseveringly reaches our ears in the oft-cited Firm\u0101ns of the Porte. The conclusion of the record on this stone is obscure, and it is only by supposing extreme laxity of orthography in the original, and claiming, under such shelter, a momentary excuse for very hazardous suggestions, that the words may be rendered\n\n---\n\n1 Persian version, x. 286, 310; Scythic, xv. 146; Persian (Oppert) J.A. 1852, p. 152. The grand Vizier of Persia, in later times, was called \u06cc\u0632\u06cc\u0631\u06a9 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631, in Armenian, Vzourk-Hramanatar.

The Hirbad (\u03a0\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), Fire-Priest of the Seythian Namri,\u00b3 a nomad tribe of ancient celebrity, possibly by this time permanently settled in close proximity to the kingdom of Armenia, with which their name is here associated.\n\n(3) The third stone carries on the lines of a previous sentence in the title \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0627 [\u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0627] \u2014 \u064a\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0644\u0627 [\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0644\u0627] in Mr. Hector's copy], which is followed, perhaps connected with, the succeeding word \u0641\u0644\u0643\u064a, which admits of varying renderings from \u0641\u0644\u0643, \"heaven,\" \u0641\u0644\u0643, \"a fire-worshipper\" [\u0628\u0644\u0643, \"fire\"], etc., according to the short vowels it may be necessary to supply, supposing always that even the three leading Pehlvi letters are assured in the modern Persian form in which they are here reproduced. The word occurs again in section 12, and in a questionably modified form in 21. The \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc in line four answers to the province of Persia, and the \u0648\u0644\u064a, \"Dominus,\" will be found to recur frequently in this and other inscriptions. (No. 14, etc.).\n\n(4) The opening \u0647\u0633\u0643\u06cc \u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc in section 4, like so many imperfectly defined and, dubiously complete names, necessarily attracts attention without contributing in its isolated form the means of a positive identification; \u064a\u0632\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u064a is fairly legible, and, with a continuous context, ought to present no difficulties. \u0631\u0627\u0645\u06cc, supposing it to be an undivided word, is\n\n\u00b9 (?) \u03a0\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Chald. \"beautiful.\"\n\u00b2 \"Tuma,\" Tau'm\u00e1 (Rawlinson, J.R.A.S. x. pp. 101, 178, 196, etc.); Scythic, takma (Norris, xv. 114, 134, etc.); \"Takman, fortis\" (Fox Talbot, xix. 155); Takhma (Takhmuras; Haug, 194). Oppert, J.A. xvii. 565. The superlative Tama may have something in common with the term (Haug, 89), or possibly may after all be merely an imperfect rendering of \u062a\u0647, \"race, seed, origin.\" Cf. \u03a4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c7\u03c9, \u03a4\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, \u03a4\u03ad\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd.\n\n\u00b3 Darius's Cuneiform Inscriptions, J.R.A.S.

The name of Sak\u00e1n is well defined,\nand the \u064a preceding the designation is carefully marked as a\nfinal.\\(^2\\) The word \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646 is of frequent occurrence (v. 3, 6).\n\n(6) The contents of No. 6 offer but little matter for safe\nspeculation, with the exception of the concluding \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u062a\u0631.\n\n(7) No. 7 presents nothing remarkable beyond the \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064b\u0627\nwhich may be a mistake for \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064b\u0627, owing to the mason,\nperchance employed indifferently on the duplicate epigraphs\u2014\nhaving made use of a Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi \u03a7, a letter which is\nnearly identical in outline with the ordinary Sassanian \u0392 of\nthese inscriptions.\n\n(8) The commencement of the third line seems to retain the\nconclusion of the name of \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0634\u062a\u0631. The title of \u0628\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u062a\u0627\u0646 in\nline four also recurs frequently, and is readily identifiable\nwith Anquetil\u2019s Barbita = \u201cSalar en chef\u201d (Z.A. ii. 486).\n\n(9) The ninth tablet contains a title or, perhaps, a name\nof some interest, which may be read conjecturally, as \u0647\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648 or\n\u0647\u0631\u06af\u0648\u0628\u062a; the designation occurs again in the sixth line, where\nit is preceded by the definite title of \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0644\u06a9 Hierarch. The\n\u0647\u0631 probably stands for \u0647\u06cc\u0631, \u201cfire,\u201d as it is thus written in\n\u0647\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u062f Hirbad; but the determination of the compound\n\u06af\u0648\u0628\u062a is more open to question, unless it may be associated with the\nSanskrit Gupta \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 from \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u201cto protect\u201d (see also Nos. 17,\n18, etc.). The word \u0644\u0628\u0627 which follows is possibly incomplete,\nbut the obsolete Semitic \u0644\u0628 or \u0644\u064a\u060c \u201clion,\u201d so largely\nidealized and so consistently retained by the ancient kings in\nofficial seal devices and sculptured illustrations, and affectedly\nreproduced by the Sassanians in bas-reliefs and in titular com-\nposition as \u0644\u0628\u0627 \u0643\u0648\u0634\u0627\u0646\u060c \u201clion slaying,\u201d\\(^3\\) might claim a leading\ndominance in this place, but it may be better to revert to the\n\n\\(^1\\) J.R.A.S. xiii. pp. 395, 399.\n\\(^2\\) \u201cSaka,\u201d J.R.A.S., xii. 468; \u201cSacan,\u201d xv. 150.\n\\(^3\\) This term occurs on a beautiful gold coin of Hormuzdas II. (303-310 A.D.),\nterm \"heart,\" (from \"to be fat\"), which would more nearly accord with the general tenor of the inscription, and explain the frequent recurrence of the allied \u0646\u063a\u0634\u064a.\n\nAmong other words on this stone may be detected the important pronoun \u0632\u06a9, \"he,\" \"who,\" \"that,\" the original Persian Cuneiform si, \"qui, que,\" also \"quod, quia,\" which is associated with the Chaldee \u05d9, the relative pronoun and sign of the genitive. The Hebrew \u05d6\u05d4, \"this,\" the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a, \"who,\" and \u0630\u0644\u0643, \"that,\" have all to be considered in their bearing upon the word, as the duties the Pahlvi had to be answerable for were manifold. Anquetil was obliged to allow the term a very extended range of meanings in his single specimen page of Pahlvi translations of the Bun-dehesh (p. 341, vol. ii.); but in his vocabularies he rather limits it to \"cela, celui-l\u00e0,\" the modern Persian \u0622\u0646 (pp. 496, 504).\n\nThe \u0632\u06cc in these early Pahlvi readings seems to have been the contrasted form reserved for the sign of the genitive, which eventually settled itself into the j of the Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah and later Persian writings: while the \u0632\u06a9, which was probably pronounced zaka, subsided into the present \u06a9.\n\nThe \u0634\u0631\u06cc in line five is critically doubtful, as I have substituted, on the authority of the very indubitable form of brought from Persia by Sir H. Rawlinson, and now in the British Museum. The following is a description of the piece: Obverse\u2014King's bust, to the right; the head is covered with a lion's skin, after the classical precedent on the coins of Alexander the Great; this is again surmounted by flames of fire (?), at the back of which float the broad Sassanian fillets.

This is the Khoda, \"Roi,\" of Anquetil (ii. 442, 515), and the conventional Pehlvi term for \"king.\"\u00b9\n\n(10) The tenth detached portion of the original mural record, among other words which need not be dwelt upon, concludes with \u0648\u0647\u0645\u0643\u064a \u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u06af\u0628\u0631. It would be unwise to insist upon \u06af\u0628\u0631, as, however appropriate, it appears in too unconnected and broken a form to be fairly relied upon.\n\n(11) The eleventh stone is remarkable for the preservation of the name of Hormazd (\u0627\u0648\u0647\u0648\u0645\u0632\u062f\u06cc=\u0627\u0648\u0647\u0644\u0645\u0632\u062f\u06cc).

Preface, Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah) has suggested a very original but scarcely conclusive explanation of the disuse of this term in its proper and archaic meaning, by assuming that when the word \u062e\u062f\u0627 came to be accepted by the followers of Muhammad in the sense of \"God,\" that they were able to obliterate all ancient memories of the linguistic import of the designation, and to raise their Allah to the exclusively divine title, heretofore so simply affected in the ordinary acceptation of \"king\" by common mortals. It would, perhaps, be a more satisfactory way of explaining the difficulty, to infer that men of old, in the East, on attaining royalty, were given to advance a simultaneous claim to divine honours, and with this notion to assume the designations and attributes of their local gods; but as the world grew older, the words so employed reverted to their proper and normal linguistic import, which had been thus temporarily and conditionally misapplied; terms which, in the case in point, had already in a manner ceased to convey any exceptional mundane distinction. See a note on the subject of the Armenian god H'aldia in the Numismatic Chronicle, vol. vii. N.S. (1867) p. 151. Masudi tells us a good deal about the origin and use of the term; among other passages, in chap. xxiv. (vol. ii. p. 237, Paris edit.), he remarks\u2014\"Les rois perses, depuis l'origine des temps jusqu'\u00e0 la naissance de l'islamisme, sont divis\u00e9s en quatre dynasties. La premi\u00e8re, qui s'\u00e9tend de Keyomert \u00e0 Af\u00e9ridoun, est celle des Khodahains (\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0646), mot qui a le sens de rebb (\u0631\u0628) \"ma\u00eetre,\" comme on dit rebb-el-met\u00e0 \"ma\u00eetre d'un bien,\" rebb-ed-dar, \"ma\u00eetre de maison.\" In the time of Khusr\u00fa Parv\u00edz the State Seal for Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n still retained the title in \u062e\u062f\u0627 (p. 228), Aryan philologists propose to derive the word from \u062e\u0648\u062f, \"self-coming\" (\u062e\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0645\u062f), while the Sanskrit authorities suggest Swadatta (\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0926\u0924\u094d\u0924), \"self-given,\" or preferably Swadh\u00e1 (\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0927\u093e), \"self-generated.\" (Benfey).\nline four may be another form of \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0626\u06cc, which is a frequent adjective in the Sassanian inscriptions.\n\n(12) No. 12, though much defaced, retains some indications of value in the possible restoration of line two, in the form of \u067e\u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0648\u0631\u06cc. The word \u0647\u0648\u0631\u06cc is not necessarily and exclusively \"the Sun,\" but also applies to \"fire, light,\" though the former interpretation is preferable in this place, as \u0647\u0631 only occurs as the abbreviated form for fire in combination.\n\n(13) The term \u067e\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627 again appears in No. 13, and is to be met with in various forms in the counterpart Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi version.\n\n(14) The words \u0627\u0641\u06a9\u06cc and \u067e\u0627\u062a\u06a9\u0631\u0633, if we could but rely upon their correct isolation in the general and undivided continuity of the writing, would claim a passing notice, while the \u0646\u0641\u0634\u064a as a standard expression identifies itself with \u0646\u0641\u06cc\u0634, \u0646\u0641\u06cc\u0634, \"life,\" \"the vital spirit;\" but the interest in this tablet centres in the conclusion, which, though greatly defective in the original, or its reproduction, seems to contain the word \u0633\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u06cc. The Soshyanto of the Parsis were \"the ancient prophets\" of the Zoroastrian creed.\u00b9 I must repeat that the divisions in the modern Pehlvi representation of Sir H. Rawlinson's fac-simile are purely arbitrary, and that I have no reserve whatever in altering or re-arranging the connection of the letters.\n\n(15) No. 15 contributes a more ample legend than its fellows, and has the additional merit of being reported by its English transcribers as \"very plain\" in its writing; the words \u0634\u062a\u06cc\u0632\u06cc, \u0634\u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc are fairly legible towards the commencement; \u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0646 and \u067e\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646,\u00b3 followed by \u0645\u0644\u0627\u06a9\u0627, appear in the third line; but the point of the highest interest in the whole inscription from first to last is the mention of the name\n\n\u00b9 Haug, Language of the Parsees, pp. 219, 196, 164. A far more serious and critical examination of the earlier chapters of the Zend Avesta, by Dr. Cajetanus Kosowicz, (Paris, 1865), gives 'Sasgyand' as \"Salvator.\"\n\n\u00b2 I am doubtful about this word, as the copy reads preferentially \u06af\u062f\u06cc.

In line three may be read, with every reserve, but under a different arrangement of the words and a rejection of the dubious \u0634, the Pehlvi letters will equally correspond to \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0647\u06cc \u067e\u0627\u0646. The fourth line commences with a name optionally \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0634 (\u0645\u06cc) \u0627\u0628\u0634, which is followed by the titles of \u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc and \u06af\u06cc\u0627\u0644\u06a9, \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, Hierarch. Sir H. Rawlinson notices that there is a blank space at the bottom of the inscribed face of this stone, as if the last line of writing had formed a portion of the conclusion of the main inscription.\n\n(21) The twenty-first tablet is considerably damaged and defaced; but the fourth line runs continuously \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0627 \u0648 \u0627\u0641\u06cc\u06a9 \u0634\u062a\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631.\n\n(22) No. 22 is the last of the Sassanian series copied by Sir H. Rawlinson. In the first line may be seen the personal pronoun \u0647\u0648\u064a (\u0647\u0648), Chald. \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1, Zend, ava, \"he or she,\" the Cuneiform Persian Haava, and the modern Persian \u0627\u0648, \u0627\u0648. The second line gives the frequently-recurring \u0631\u0627, with a word which may be rendered \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0645\u06cc, a transliteration, however, that can scarcely be accepted in this place. The several terms \u0632\u062f\u06cc, \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u064a, \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u06cc, \u0646\u0627\u0645 may be tentatively modernized, and the concluding line may be restored under protest in regard to the original copy of the final \u0628\u06cc\u062a \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u06a9 \u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0647\u0631\u06cc\u062a.\n\n1 An apt illustration of the difficulty of expressing these and other gradational sounds in the imperfect Pehlvi alphabet is contributed by the anomalous state of the power of the literary definition in Kurdistan at the present day:\u2014\"Les Kurdes lettr\u00e9s sont, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les gens qui ne savent qu'imparfaitement leur langue maternelle.

Si parfois ils se voient oblig\u00e9s d'\u00e9crire en kurde, ils le font \u00e0 l'aide de l'alphabet persan. En effet, toutes les consonnes persanes sont identiques avec celles des kurdes, du moins pour ce qui concerne le dialecte de Sol\u00e9mani\u00e9; mais celui-ci contient beaucoup de voyelles et de diphtongues qu'il serait impossible de reproduire au moyen de l'orthographe en usage chez les Persans. Comment, par example, figurer en persan les articulations ae, ee, oo, dou, eou, dou, aoue, etc., qui se rencontrent si souvent et se suivent les unes les autres, sans l'intervention des consonnes, dans les mots kurdes?\"\u2014J. A. 1857, p. 302.\nP\u0101\u012b K\u016bl\u012b Inscriptions in Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi.\n\nSir H. Rawlinson's eye appears to have been less trained to the peculiarities of the Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi than to an appreciation of the outlines of the more simple letters of the fellow or Sassanian alphabet, so that while his transcripts in the latter character are, as it were, written, the former are elaborately but mechanically copied, and in some instances (Nos. 24, 27, 30, and 32), so great was the desire of accuracy, that the letters are traced in double lines, as is usual in exact engraving. The writing itself, as I have already pointed out (p. 251 ante) presents great sameness in the different alphabetical signs, and in many cases a very slight inflection constitutes the essential discriminative mark of the given letter. There are no obvious finals, and the words do not seem to have been separated, as is effected to a great extent in portions of the H\u00e1ji\u00e1b\u00e1d Inscription. Under these circumstances my conjectural restorations must necessarily partake, perchance even in a larger degree, of the imperfection of the materials at command: which of themselves appeared to promise and may, perchance, eventually afford a better text and a greater amount of information than their more voluminous counterparts in the Sassanian character.\n\nIn the ordinary course of the arrangement of the present article, under the conception of retaining in full prominence a systematic discrimination between the contrasted forms of the associate alphabets, I have reserved the closely-identical modern Hebrew type for the representation of the since-severed and now obsolete outlines of the Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi originals, while devoting the current Persian of our days to the embodiment of the Sassanian Pehlvi, from whose archaic elements it claims so much of direct descent. But on this occasion, where, in default of positive facsimiles, I have been obliged to elevate the Hebrew into a leading text, I resort to the less classic Nashkhi type for my commentary, not only for the purpose of giving a second and possibly more suggestive identification of the true Persian original, in its now conven-\ntional alphabet, but also as affording a readier means of comparison with the gloss upon the more ample materials available in the less ephemeral Sassanian characters, which almost intuitively fell into the literal signs of that since amplified alphabet.\n\nNo. 23. The first of Sir H. Rawlinson's Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi Inscriptions, though carefully copied, is so imperfect in what remains of the original writing, that it would be useless to speculate upon any matter simply dependent on contexts. The word \u0644\u0628\u0627, so frequent in the Sassanian series, occurs twice either in its full integrity or as a portion of other words, under the confessedly optional re-arrangement of the letters now presented, amid which it may be again remarked that no discriminative finals are to be detected.\n\nNo. 24 exhibits a more extended range of subjects for legitimate speculation. In the second line \u0632\u064a\u0627\u0632\u062a\u0646 \u0631\u0628 \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0631 seems to be fairly assured in transliteration and simple in interpretation; the aspirated \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0631, \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0631, the Sanskrit \u091a\u091a, from \u091a\u093f, \"to rule,\" corresponds with the concurrent Sassanian \u0634\u062a\u0631; while the Pati\u1e63a in line three recalls the ancient Cuneiform orthography. The preceding words \u0648\u0698\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u06a9\u0648\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0646 may, under very slight modifications, chance to carry new significance, as Ionians (Greeks, etc.), and enemies \u062f\u0648\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0646, with the Chaldean plural termination and the long \u016b, which is rejected in the modern orthography. The same remark may be applied to \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u0645\u0646 \u06a9\u0645\u0627 \u0648 \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u062a\u064a in line four; and \u064a\u0627\u0632\u062a\u0646 \u0648\u0647\u0645\u064a \u06a9\u0634\u06af\u0643\u064a \u0627\u0633\u0628\u062a\u0645, with much that is already intelligible awaits but little extraneous aid for satisfactory interpretation. In line six the oft-recurring \u067e\u062a\u064a is succeeded by Y\u0101xtan Shamei, \"God of Heaven,\" which brings the whole tenor of the inscription back to Semitic regions; or, if a more distinctly Pehlvi rendering be sought in the \u0634\u0645\u064a (the Pehlvi \u067e\u0631 \u0634\u0645\u064a \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0631, \"in the name of Almighty,\" the Giver of the Zoroastrian prayer), the context of the succeeding word may be improved into \u0647\u0645\u06a9 \u0634\u0645\u062a.\n| No. 24 | No. 23 |\n|--------|--------|\n| \u05db\u05d3\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0 | \u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 |\n| \u05e4\u05d5\u05e9\u05d5 \u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d6\u05df \u05e8\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d6\u05de\u05e8 | \u05e4\u05d0\u05e1\u05e0\u05db\u05e0 |\n| \u05d5\u05d5\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0 \u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05df \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05e1\u05d0 | \u05dc\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d0\u05ea |\n| \u05d0\u05d9\u05d1 \u05de\u05d5\u05df \u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d5\u05db\u05d4\u05d5 | \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05e8 |\n| \u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d6\u05df \u05d5\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e1\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05de\u05d5 | \u05dc\u05d1\u05d0 \u05e4\u05e8\u05d4\u05e9 |\n| \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d6\u05df \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05ea | |\n\n| No. 26 | No. 25 |\n|--------|--------|\n| \u05d9\u05e0\u05e1\u05d1 \u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d6\u05d0 | \u05db\u05d3\u05e8\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1 |\n| \u05d0\u05d0\u05db \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05e0 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05e0\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05d9 | \u05d9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05e1\u05e0\u05e0\u05d3\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1 |\n| \u05d4\u05d7\u05d0\u05dd \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 | \u05e0\u05d7 \u05d5\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e9\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9 \u05de\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e8 |\n| \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05de\u05df \u05d5\u05de\u05e0 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e4\u05d8 \u05d0 | \u05d0\u05df \u05d7\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05ea\u05d7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9 |\n| \u05dc \u05db\u05de\u05d0\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9\u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05ea | \u05d7\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e0\u05d5 |\n| \u05d5\u05d5 \u05de\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e4\u05e0\u05d8\u05dc\u05d9\u05d0 \u05ea\u05df \u05e0\u05d0\u05e9\u05d0 | \u05e9\u05d9\u05d7\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d3 \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d0 \u05db\u05d0\u05d5\u05e9\u05e8 |\n\n| No. 28 | No. 27 |\n|--------|--------|\n| \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05df \u05d5 | \u05e8\u05d0\u05dd \u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d7\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 |\n| \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9 \u05d5 | \u05de\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05df \u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05e8 |\n| \u05d9\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05df \u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d5 | \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d6\u05df \u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05d7 \u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 |\n| \u05d4\u05ea \u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u0631\u0628 \u05d1\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea | \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05df \u05e4\u05d5\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 |\n| \u05d4\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5 \u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0\u05ea\u05e8\u05e9 | \u05db\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d5 \u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e0\u05d9\u05df \u05e4\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9\u05df |\n| \u05d5\u05d5\u05d3\u05db\u05d0\u05e8\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 | \u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d6 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea\u05e0 |\nNo. 25 exhibits in the second line the full constituent elements of the word \"Sakandar,\" but the name seems out of place, and the isolation of the letters is altogether arbitrary.

The \u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u06a9\u06cc\u0646 of line two is followed by the Arabic \u0627\u0644 (Pehlvi \u0648\u0644), and the name of \u0646\u0645\u06cc (perhaps \u0646\u0645\u0631) is succeeded by the oft-recurring \u0646\u063a\u0634\u06cc.

Line two continues from a preceding tablet \u067e\u06cc\u062a\u06cc \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u0647\u0631\u062a\u0644\u06cc\u0646. Line three, to judge from the copy, must be much damaged, \u067e\u062a\u06cc at the beginning and \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 at the end are all that can be relied upon. The letters decipherable in line four contribute the following possible combination: \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u067e\u0631\u0634\u0631\u06a9\u0631\u062a: \u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u0646. The \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 in line five, if correct, is exceptional, as the ever-recurring verb \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 of the Sassanian system has not hitherto been met with in this Chaldeo-Pehlvi transcript. The \u0633\u0628\u0648\u0644 in line six may equally well be converted into \u067e\u062a\u0648\u0644\u060c \u0633\u062a\u0648\u0644, or other new combinations; for among the originally fully-contrasted forms of the ancient letters I can extend no certain faith to Sir H. Rawlinson's copies of the \u067e and the \u0646, as discriminated from one another: and worse still, the \u067e, which, at the time his copies were made, was unknown, or rather unproven,\u2014may so easily be taken for either of the approximated outlines of the first-named more common letters, that the natural difficulties of a right interpretation of the damaged writings of P\u0101\u012b K\u016bl\u012b are almost hopelessly enhanced! The apparently isolated words which stand at the foot of this tablet seems to afford a second example of a derivation of the verb \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 in the form of \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u06cc.\nIn No. 31 the previous reading of \u0641\u0631\u0633\u064a\u062a in No. 26 is fully confirmed by its definite repetition in this place. Line two suggests many uncertain details, though the best version seems to be \u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0631\u06a9\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0648\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u062f\u0647\u0648. But the interest of this tablet centres in line three, where, if we could rely upon our standard text, we might transcribe freely the words \u0648 \u067e\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u06a9\u0646\u06cc \u067e\u062a\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u06a9\u06cc\u0627\u06a9 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0648\u0634; a variant of the \u0627\u06a9\u06cc\u0627\u06a9 has been met with before in No. xxvi., but the \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0648\u0634, if it could be assured, would throw additional light upon this apparently religious manifesto of the Zoroastrian creed. The \u067e\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u0633\u0647 (possibly the \u067e\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u0633\u0627 of No. xxiv.) commences line four, followed by \u06a9\u0646\u0647\u06cc\u062a \u0648 \u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0644\u0646 \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u062a. The \u0647\u0648\u067e\u06cc of the printed text in line five may require correction into \u0647\u0631\u06cc\u062a\u06cc. The \u0627\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u0645\u0648\u062f at the end of the line is a word to be compared and commented on hereafter. \u064a\u0627\u0632\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc \u0648 \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0631 complete all that remains of the last line.\n\nThe 32nd and last tablet is the most curious of the whole broken series, and in the seeming completeness within itself, as judged by its remaining fragments, must have either constituted a portion of a summary or recapitulation apart from the rest of the inscription, otherwise any preconceived idea of the absolute continuity of the text from stone to stone in the ordinary line of writing must be altogether at fault. Though it is by no means improbable that the record of the original manifesto of Ardeshir was finished after the accession of Sapor, even if it was not supplemented by him with independent tablets devoted to his own glorification. Such an inference would accord well with the frequent appearance of Sapor's name, as associated with the full honors of royalty, in certain passages whose consecutive order it is, at present, impossible to determine. The five letters still extant in the first line resolve themselves almost naturally into the Aryan \u0646\u06af\u0631 (\u0928\u0917\u0930), but the long vowels tend to cast a doubt about the identity of the word. After some obscurities, line two presents us with the word \u0633\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0646, which, adverting to the sub-\nsequent associations, may possibly stand for the country of Syria, but which I prefer to consider as the ancient, much-esteemed title of Surena, a name the Romans learned to know but too well in the course of their Persian wars.\\(^1\\) The country of Persia seems clear enough; presents a\n\n\\(^1\\) Plutarch in Crassus; Strabo, xvi. c. i. \u00a7 24; Ammian.

The title was possibly derived from \"\u0633\u0631\", \"King\" (\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc).

Armin\u00ee, in line four, may reasonably be corrected into Armin\u00ee, especially in its direct conjunction with The name of is confessedly a restoration out of the very imperfect tracing of the original pencil copy, but the letters are sufficiently assured to justify the insertion of the missing after the initial, and the needful termination before The concluding line is nearly illegible.\n\nSir H. Rawlinson has favoured me with the subjoined Note on the locality and surroundings of P\u00e2i-K\u00fbli, which unfortunately reached me after the preceding pages had been set up in type.\n\nThese ruins which I first heard of in 1835 whilst employed in the neighbouring district of Zohab (see Journal of the Royal Geograph. Soc., vol. ix. p. 30), I had an opportunity of examining in some detail during a two days' visit which I paid them in 1844, in company with Mr. Alexander Hector, on a return trip from Sulimanieh to Baghdad. They are situated at the South-Eastern extremity of the rocky ridge of Scghermeh, at the distance of about four miles from the right bank of the river Shirw\u00e1n or Diyal\u00e9h, and just beyond an easy pass which crosses the shoulder of the hill from the Karadagh valley. The hill which intervenes between the ruins and the river, and which is a lower and less rugged continuation of the Scghermeh range, is named G\u00fbl\u00e1n. The district on the river is called Bani-Khil\u00e1n, and is well known from the ford of that name by which the river is crossed on the high road from Zohab to Sulimanieh. The exact position of the ruins is in latitude $35^\\circ 7' 16''$, and longitude $45^\\circ 34' 35''$. With these indications any traveller may succeed in finding the locality, but to enable him to inspect the ruins at his leisure it will be indispensable that he should be attended with a suitable escort, as the districts along the river, being a sort of debatable ground between the Persian and Turkish empires, are overrun with marauding Kurds who pay no respect to either Prince or Pasha.\n\nThe ruins, which are called indifferently P\u00e2i-K\u00fbli (\"the\nfoot of the pass\u201d), and *But-Khaneh* (\u201cthe idol temple\u201d), crown the summit of a shoulder which runs out from the range towards the East and thus presents a sloping declivity circling round from N.E. to S.E. It is difficult to determine the design of the original edifice, so completely has it been ruined, but it may be conjectured to have been a quadrangular construction, about one hundred feet square, formed of rubble and brick and faced with large blocks of grey stone of which the exterior surface was smoothened; and probably the building itself was crowned with a cupola. At present indiscriminate heaps of brick and mortar, rubble and stone, cover the entire summit of the hill, and nowhere is any portion of the wall in its original state to be recognized. Scattered along the brow, however, and at different points on all three sides of the steep slope, which extends perhaps 150 yards from the ruins to the plain below, are to be seen at least 100 blocks of hewn stone, the d\u00e9bris apparently of the building above; and as a considerable number\u2014perhaps half\u2014of these blocks are engraved on their smoothened face with writing, and the inscribed blocks would all seem to have fallen from the Eastern wall of the building, I conceive that it was on that face only, facing the rising sun, that the commemorative record was placed. This record, like most of the other memorials of the early Sassanians, was engraved in two different characters and languages, which used to be called Parthian and Sassanian, but which it is now proposed to distinguish as Chald\u00e6o-Pehlevi and Persian-Pehlevi. I copied the inscriptions on thirty-two blocks of stone, ten of these inscriptions being in Chald\u00e6o-Pehlevi and twenty-two in Persian-Pehlevi; and these were all the fragments of writing which were exposed and which were tolerably legible; but there are, I doubt not, an equal number of fragments still to be recovered by any traveller who has the means and the leisure to turn over the many blocks lying with their face downwards, and also to disinter those which are now half imbedded in the soil, or covered over with the rubbish, on the summit of the hill. Amongst this rubbish I further observed one slab about four feet square, rudely sculptured with\nthe head and shoulders of a Sassanian king, the figure being intended in all probability for Ardashir Babegan; and it is very possible other similar slabs would be found if the ruins were thoroughly examined. I always, indeed, cherished the idea of being able, on the occasion of some future visit, to take an exact paper-cast of the inscribed surface of every block throughout the ruins, by which means I might succeed in reconstructing the work, after the manner of a child's puzzle; and I am still of opinion that this reconstruction might be partially, if not completely, effected,\u2014notwithstanding that the edges of the blocks are in many cases chipped and worn;\u2014since it would be assisted, not only by the coincidence of the lines of writing, but by the identifications of the different words and phrases as the general tenour of the inscriptions became gradually intelligible.\n\nIt only remains that I should say a word as to the purport of the original building. In popular tradition the place is known as the But-khaneh (or \"idol-house\"), probably from the figure of Ardashir, which is still the prominent feature of the ruins; but I found that the educated Kurds\u2014and there are many such at Sulimanieh\u2014considered P\u00e1\u00ef-K\u00fal\u00ee to be the site of a Fire-Temple of the Magi; and such I believe to be a true explanation of this really interesting spot, although I have never met with a notice of the locality among the many copious descriptions of Sassanian antiquities that are found in the early Arabic Historians and Travellers, and although the inaccessible position of the ruins and the present desolate and inhospitable character of the surrounding country are singularly inappropriate to a great scene of popular pilgrimage. In all probability, however, the country has very much altered in appearance since the Sassanian period. At present there are no permanent villages or fixed inhabitants between the Turkish frontier at Khannik\u00edn and Sulimanieh, but along the course of the Diy\u00e1leh, throughout this interval of space, are to be seen on both banks numerous traces of ancient populousness and prosperity. On the Persian side of the river, for instance, the ruins of Sheikh\u00e1n, of Hur\u00edn, and Hershel have been already described by me (see Geograph.\nJournal, vol. ix. p. 30), while in following the P\u0101\u012b-K\u016bl\u012b route from Sulimanieh to Khannik\u00edn, I now found a series of ancient remains which convinced me that the old road conducting from Ctesiphon to the Atropatenian Ecbatana must have followed this line. The road in question is mentioned by many of the early Arab geographers (by Ibn Khurdadbeh, for instance, and by Mos\u00e1er, as quoted by Yac\u00fat in the Mo\u2019ejem-el-Bald\u00e1n); it left the great Persian road at Ka\u1e63r-i-Shir\u00edn, and proceeded north to D\u00e9r K\u00e1n, now called Housh Kerek, where there are some extensive and very remarkable Sassanian ruins; it crossed the Diy\u00e1leh at Binkudra, a corruption of the old Syriac title of Ba-Nihudra, and led from thence to Shirw\u00e1nch, a place which has given its name to the river and where there is a magnificent artificial mound, that would be well worth excavating. Further on there are the remains of an extensive city near the river, now called Shar-i-Ver\u00e1n (\"the ruined city\"), but which I cannot identify in ancient geography. An easy stage conducts from Shar-i-Ver\u00e1n to P\u0101\u012b-K\u016bl\u012b, and from that point the old road crossed the Goura Kileh (\"Gueber\u2019s fort\") range, which is a S.E. prolongation of the Karadagh hills, direct to Yass\u00edn Teppeh, the ancient Shahriz\u00far, leaving the modern town of Sulimanieh at least fifteen miles to the left hand. This route was of great importance under the Sassanians. An ancient custom, dating probably from the time of Ardashir, required that each king should on his accession proceed from Ctesiphon along this road to be crowned in the Fire-Temple of Azerakhsh at Sh\u00edz; and in connection with such a line of pilgrimage Shahriz\u00far itself acquired such celebrity that it was popularly named Nim-r\u0101h, or \"the half-way house,\" the distances respectively from Ctesiphon to Shahriz\u00far by the P\u0101\u012b-K\u016bl\u012b route, and from Shahriz\u00far to Sh\u00edz (or Takht-i-Sulim\u00e1n), being about 185 miles, as explained by me in my examination of the march of Heraclius on Ganzaca in the tenth volume of the Geographical Journal, p. 101. I think it very probable, then, that the Fire-Temple at P\u0101\u012b-K\u016bl\u012b was instituted in connection with this route from Ctesiphon to Ganzaca, and that the legend, the fragments of which are\nhere published, may contain some allusion to the royal progresses.\n\nH. C. Rawlinson.\n\nInscription No. 4.\n\nThe bas-relief at Naksh-i-Rajab,\u00b9 which the subjoined inscription is intended to illustrate, consists of a group representing Sapor heading a procession on horseback, while around and behind him are ranged the nobles of his court with his guards on foot. The face and head-dress of the monarch have been intentionally damaged, but the slope of the coronet of the latter can be traced in outline, and seems to accord with the low mural crown depicted in other sculptures and ordinarily in use upon his coins; this is surmounted by the customary globe of fire or ether; side masses of bushy curls, with the national fillets fluttering lightly at the back, complete the details the iconoclast has suffered to remain.\n\nOne of the peculiarities of Sapor\u2019s costume as contrasted with the more simple garments of his father, which hang heavily and formally over his limbs,\u00b2 is that his vestments seem to be composed of silk or linen of the finest texture, and fall wavily and lightly in their folds, with their loose ends floating freely in the air. The inscription, as in an earlier example (No. 1), is engraved as far as space permitted on the shoulder of the charger. The immediate attendants wear various forms of the Parthian helmet,\u00b3 with distinguishing devices on the right side of the casque, the subordinate guards who fill in the rear of the design wear uniform but unadorned helmets of the Parthian pattern, and stand with their hands crossed over the hilts of the long straight sword in use at the period.\n\n\u00b9 Niebuhr, ii. pl. xxxii. p. 125; Ker Porter, pl. xxviii; Flandin, bas-relief A, pl. 189, and enlarged engraving, pl. 191; De Sacy, p. 31; Ouseley, Travels, pl. lv.; Rich.

At D\u00e1r\u00e1bgr\u00edd (plates 31 and 33, Flandin), Sapor places his left hand on the head of Cyriades, as if in commendation, or confirmation of the position he was about to bestow upon him, in supersession of the kneeling Valerian. Sapor's helmet is, in this instance, similar to the skull-cap ordinarily appropriated to his father, but the tied point of the beard continues to mark his special identity.\n\nIn plate 48 of Flandin (bas-relief B, at Sh\u00e1hp\u00far), we have a single kneeling figure before the horse of the conqueror without the usual incidental accompaniments. In plate 49, bas-relief A, also sculptured at Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, the positions of the parties are greatly changed; and if we may judge by the seemingly elaborate drawings, the younger man is now kneeling, possibly awaiting investiture, while Sapor places his right hand on the arm of Valerian, who is clearly in fetters, as if in the act of exhibiting him to the assembled troops. Sapor's crown in this bas-relief follows the usual mural pattern. A novelty is to be noticed in this composition in the introduction of a winged figure descending from the sky and presenting to Sapor a second diadem, which floats in unbound and open folds. See also Morier's plate xiii. p. 91, Persia, Armenia, etc. London, 1812.\n\nPlate 53 is indistinct in the definition of the persons forming the general group, but Valerian is seen kneeling with hands outstretched in the ordinary attitude, while a standing figure behind him, in the garb of a Roman, presents a circlet to Sapor. The outline of the figure standing by the side of Sapor's charger\nparts of Persia, devoted to the commemoration of Sapor's successful capture of the Emperor Valerian in 260 A.D. The general arrangement of Sapor's dress in this instance is similar\n\nis imperfect, but from the size it would seem to be designed to represent a youth. The angel with the Sassanian bandeau appears above, and in the side compartments are figured a Roman biga, an elephant, a horse, etc.\n\nI am unable to recognise in plate 51, bas-relief D (Morier, pl. xi.) at Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, any association with Sapor's triumph over Valerian, but understand the general design to refer to some other boasted success of the Persian monarch, perchance over the Syrian king Sit\u00e1r\u00fan (Masa'udi, cap. lxviii.) or possibly over Odenathus himself, who, under western testimony, is affirmed, on the other hand, to have gained advantages over Sapor in the war undertaken to avenge the humiliation of the Romans. Sapor's portrait in this sculpture is more artistic in its treatment than usual; and if Flandin's copy, here reproduced, be a true rendering of the original we may fairly admit the traditional perfection of that monarch's form and features.\n\nHead of Sapor I.\nFrom a Bas-relief at Sh\u00e1hp\u00far.\n\nThe head dress is changed from the ordinary mural crown into a close-fitting cap, from the sides of which rise eagles' wings, and the whole is surmounted by the conventional globe. This style of head-gear is used by Sapor in the bas-relief Ker Porter, xxiv.; Flandin, plates 187, 188; but it does not appear on the coins of the dynasty till the reign of Varahran II. (279\u2013296), who employs it throughout. Among the other head-dresses of Sapor may be noticed a sort of Parthian cap or helmet coming to the front in the head and beak of an eagle. (Numismatic Chronicle, xv. p. 180, fig. 3).\nto that already adverted to under the notice of No. 4 bas-relief, but the face and head-dress are here admirably preserved; the former exhibits much of the manly beauty for which Sapor was so famed,\\(^1\\) with a delicate though well-formed moustache, closely-curled or partially-grown whiskers, passing into a well-trained beard, which is retained in a quaint tie below the chin, so as to create a small prolonged imperial below the ring or binding which checked its natural flow, a fashion which, even in Sapor\u2019s own time and afterwards, merged into a jewelled drop, constituting a terminal completion of the beard itself, and whose exaggerated dimensions formed so marked a peculiarity in the medallic portraiture of later sovereigns! Sapor has the usual bushy side-curls, and still adheres to the mural crown surmounted by the conventional globe,\u2014the Sassanian fillets float freely at the back, and similar small fillets or barred ribbons are attached to his sword hilt, his ankles, and even to his horse\u2019s head and tail.\n\nValerian is fitly represented in the Roman costume, with the laurel chaplet on his brow, kneeling in front of Sapor\u2019s charger, with both hands outstretched, in the obvious attitude of supplication; a young man, also in Roman garb, wearing an identical chaplet, and who is supposed to be intended for Cyriades, stands by his side and receives from the hand of Sapor the circlet and wavy bands, which other sculptures indicate to be the accepted insignia of royalty.\n\nThe inscription itself, which fills in the space behind Sapor\u2019s horse, was partially copied by Niebuhr;\\(^2\\) and a few lines were sketched but not published by Ker Porter.\\(^3\\) M. Flandin\u2019s\\(^4\\) transcript is a most marked advance upon the early tracings of Niebuhr in the amplitude of the text, though only questionably improving upon the legibility of the selected sections contributed by his predecessor.

On one occasion only, in the entire series of sculptures, is Valerian represented in chains, and the anklets, in this case, may well be taken to be merely figurative. The few Persian authors, indeed, who notice this but little appreciated episode in the history of their own country, relate that Sapor wisely took advantage of the engineering skill of his captive, and employed him, together with free artizans obtained from Rome, in the construction of the celebrated irrigation dam, and in the general embellishment of the new city of Shuster. Tabari, it is true, reports that after completion of these works, Sapor marked and disfigured his prisoner, but the statement bears but little semblance of truth, and the Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah, in its version of the details, makes no allusion to any such barbarity. It is singular that in no one instance is there to be found any sign of the strictly western form of the name of Valerian, the Persian word *shatri*, in two several instances, precedes the other designations applicable to the dignity he was supposed to hold; and on the second occasion (line 11), this local title is connected with an outlying final or possibly directly initial *ul*, which, under the free licence of interpretation, the crude orthography of the associate texts fully invites, may be held susceptible of conversion into *Val shatri*,\\(^2\\) which perchance, may have conveyed to the indig\u00e9nes\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Eutropius, ix. c. 6; Zosimus, i. c. 36; Agathias, iv. 23; Trebellius Pollio in Hist.

but it might be better in the present state of our knowledge, and the defective context of this inscription, to limit the attribution of the designation to the Hormuzdas, the son of Sapor, who eventually succeeded to his father's throne, notwithstanding that the titular honors here conceded equal those of the reigning monarch.\n\nThere is very much else in this inscription calculated to invite comment under the linguistic and philological aspects, with so many words that may be reduced into their simplest modern forms by, so to say, the merest turn of the pen: but my object, in transliterating these primarily conscientious though necessarily deceptive reproductions of a nearly obliterated lapidary text, is accomplished in affording more ready means of comparison to future copyists, and determining a certain number of words for the illustration and confirmation of my leading text.\n\nWith regard to the restored modern Pehlvi version now printed, I may remark that I have adhered as closely as possible to the very letters given in the servile engravings from which it has been drawn.\n\nIn the case of the ordinary Persian transcript, I have allowed myself occasional latitude in suggestive modifications;

I was shewn a piece of antiquity in one of these caves, which I believe has not hitherto been noticed. It lies about a mile, nearly north, from the village. The entrance is exceedingly lofty; and within, the cavern is still more so. We see that nature originally formed it of an immense height and depth; but not satisfied with her amplitude, manual labour has added fifty yards of excavation in the vaulted roof. Along the right side, we found several square places hewn in the rock; two, nearest the entrance, at about six or seven feet from the floor of the cave, were filled with inscriptions, both were in the Pehlvi character, not much injured, but widely differing from each other; one consists of sixteen lines, the other of fourteen. I copied them with all the accuracy in my power, being much impeded by the height and darkness of their position. One portion of the three upper lines I could not make out in the least. Each inscription occupies a whole excavated tablet of about four feet in width.\"\n\nSir Ephraim Stannus's direct plaster casts of these inscriptions, taken from the face of the living rock, were brought to Europe and published in the form of jumbled and imperfect engravings, among the Transactions of the Royal Society of Dublin in 1835. The former obviously authentic reproductions of the original very early attracted the attention of Mr. Norris, who promptly devoted himself to their decipherment, for which De Sacy's essays on kindred texts had already in a measure paved the way. The interpretation of these new\ndocuments, however, proved a more serious task than had been anticipated, and Mr. Norris, in the self-denying hope\\(^1\\) that some of the then more advanced Zend students might be in a condition to supply us with tentative translations, prepared with his own hand accurate pentagraph copies of the biliteral texts, which were eventually prefixed by Westergaard to his edition of the Bundehesh,\\(^2\\) but no analysis or preliminary commentary was attempted on this occasion; nor has that author, in his subsequent introduction to the Zend Avesta,\\(^3\\) made any seeming advance in satisfying himself of the meaning or contents of these writings, beyond the detection of the single word \\(\\text{\u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646}\\),\\(^4\\) which Anquetil had already determined from other sources. A similar reserve has been maintained by Dr. F. Spiegel, who has given us so excellent a work on the P\u0101rsi language,\\(^5\\) as well as a series of Essays, of far higher pretensions, on the Huzv\u0101resch-Sprache.\\(^6\\) Dr. Martin Haug, indeed, was the only one of the prominent Zend scholars of that day who attempted to face the real difficulties of the interpretation, or who dared to venture beyond the safe limits, which the parallel Greek translations secured for the explanation of the opening passage, detailing the conventionally verbose titles and descent of the king.\n\nDr. Haug's first effort appeared in 1854.\\(^7\\) A more extended analysis is to be found in his work published in Bom-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I myself had very much to thank Mr. Norris for in these early days of our joint interest in Pehlvi decipherment. See J.R.A.S. (1849), vol. xii. p. 263; Num. Chron. (1849), xii. p. 72.\n\nI do not seek the slightest reserve in alluding to my own limited objects and contracted application of the documents in question in 1849. My studies, at the moment, merely extended to a definition of the normal forms of the lapidary letters with a view to aid the determination of the contrasted outlines of the cognate characters on the coins I happened to be engaged upon. See J.R.A.S. (1849), vol. xii. pp. 263\u20135\u20136, etc.; Num. Chron. (1849), p. 73, et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Bundehesh. N. L. Westergaard. Copenhagen, 1851.

Stannus\u2019s casts of the Sassanian version stop short with the sixth out of the total of sixteen lines. The Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi text is complete in its full fourteen lines, but the plaster impressions have been taken in four separate squares, which have, as a rule, suffered greatly on the edges, and supply a very imperfectly connected line either at the horizontal or cross perpendicular points of junction (see the Photograph). The British Museum copies are in better condition than those of the Royal Asiatic Society, while we may reasonably infer that the Dublin impressions are the best of all. Ker Porter\u2019s artistic facsimiles are of great use occasionally, and M. Flandin\u2019s more labored reproductions, at times supply the correct forms of dubious letters. I have also at my disposal a worn and nearly obliterated pencil copy of the entire Sassanian text made by Sir H. Rawlinson, who, however, omitted to secure a new facsimile of the counterpart Chald\u00e6an.\n\n\u00b9 Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings, and Religion of the Parsees.

In the present instance, the text must be supposed to advert to the general series of illustrations of Sapor's deeds delineated in the bas-reliefs in immediately proximate localities; or, probably, to some special mural representation of the mundane and higher powers more directly referred to in the text, which may have been either only preliminarily designed, partially executed, or afterwards intentionally destroyed.\u00b9 The duplicate legends in parallel cases commence severally with \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05e8 and \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9. In this epigraph \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9 the Chaldaean plural is found in one version, and \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05e8 in the other, which seemingly represents a vague definition of the corresponding modern Persian neuter plural \u0647\u0627, with the connecting iz\u0101fat attached. The specific term itself has, for long past, been identified with the modern \u067e\u06cc\u06a9\u0631, S. \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930, Armenian and Aramaean, Patkar, \"imago.\"\n\n\u0632\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a appears to connect itself with the Persian cuneiform zan\u0101,\u00b2 the modern Zan, \"a woman,\" but which in early times retained its leading signification as directly derived from a\n\n\u00b9 It is not easy to determine, with the limited information available, in what condition the three other tablets, ranging in line with these inscriptions within the cave, were found. There is nothing to show whether the rough surface was merely levelled and prepared, the tablets actually sculptured in relief or engraved in letters; or, on the other hand, whether the finished work was finally damaged or destroyed. M. Flandin's account of the walls of the interior is as follows:\u2014\"Ils se trouvent au Nord-ouest des monticules qui indiquent le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de l'ancienne ville d'Istakhr et pr\u00e8s du village d'Hadj\u0131-abad. Dans une gorge de la montagne on aper\u00e7oit des cavernes naturelles. Dans l'une d'elles sont dispos\u00e9es, sur sa paroi m\u00eame, cinq tablettes dont deux sont rev\u00eatues d'inscriptions pehlvis bien conserv\u00e9es.\"\u2014Flandin, p. 135, folio, texte; octavo, texte, vol. ii., p. 138.\n\n\u00b2 Rawlinson, J.R.A.S. x. 320; xii. 432.

But it must be borne in mind that the local alphabet was altogether deficient in the several Hebrew letters \u05db, \u05d9, \u05e4, \u05e8, and \u05e9.\n\nThe parallel Persian type embodies the Sassanian Pehlvi text, or the counterpart inscription in the old Pehlvi character, the sixteen lines of which have been arranged to accord as nearly as possible with the associate sentences of the fourteen lines of the Western writing. In this case also, in applying any test of modern languages, it must be understood that the old Sassanian alphabet consisted of eighteen signs in all, one of which represented both \u05db and \u05d5; while another, the double \u05d9, has been superseded in more advanced systems. The several forms of \u05db, \u05e9, \u05d3, \u05d2, \u05e4, \u05d5, \u05d7, \u05d7, \u05e4, \u05d2, \u05e4, \u05d5, \u05d7, \u05d7, \u05e4, \u05d5, \u05d7, \u05d7, \u05e4, \u05d5, \u05d7, have therefore altogether non-existent in the then developed power of expression of this alphabet.\n\n1. \u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05ea\u05b0\u05d2\u05b6\u05dc\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9

The next words, \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df, clearly stand for the Arabic \u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e, \u201ccoetus, multitudo\u201d (the obsolete Hebrew \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df, \u201cto collect,\u201d \u201cto congregate\u201d), which aptly falls in with the succeeding \u0632\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650\u064a. The adventitious \u0644\u0650\u0651 of the Western version is possibly the ordinary \u0644\u0650\u0651 affected by Pehlvi leanings towards superfluous n\u016bns.1\n\n1 For many years past I have been in the habit of representing these superfluous \u0644\u0650\u0651s, or final Pehlvi n\u016bns, by the modern Arabic sign of suk\u016bn \u2014, \u201ca pause,\u201d or an indication that no short vowel existed in the preceding consonant, under the impression that these mute finals in Pehlvi had something essentially in common with the characteristic home-speech of the Aryans, which originated the Cuneiform\nearlier and continuously existent forms of the Pehlvi \u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u060c King, the \u062d\u06a9\u0645 of the later writings, which eventually reverted to its primary signification of the name of the Almighty among the Muhammadans, each and all of which terms seem to have a derivation in common with the Cuneiform \u1e24aldia (H\u2019aldia).\u00b9\n\nBut a more ample and extended identification of the divergent varieties of the same designation may be followed in \u0391\u03bb\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 and \u0396\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 \u0391\u03bb\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2) on the one part,\u00b2 and the \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd unus, \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05d3, \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05d3, \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d3, \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05e8, \u05d7\u05b9\u05d3\u05b6\u05d3\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05df, \u05d7\u05b9\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05b6\u05d0\u05b7\u05df, on the other: in the latter case it is proved from independent sources that the original name of the Sun (God) descended to the King in an almost natural course as the highest of earthly authorities.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 or \u201csign of disjunction\u201d (J.R.A.S. x. 173), that so distinctly declared itself the Archemanian amalgamation of the literal signs and subsidiary adaptation of the clay-penmanship of Mesopotamia. Viewed under the former aspect the Pehlvi n\u00fcn would seem to hold duties in common with the Sanskrit \u0928\u0941\u0928\u094d vir\u0101ma, which indicated, in that grammatical system, a suppression of the short vowel a otherwise inherent in all ordinary consonants.\n\nAs far as I have been able to detect amid the mists of Pehlvi epigraphy there is no apparent grammatical purpose in the irregular addition of this concluding n\u00fcn among the coin legends; its employment, indeed, seems to have been simply phonetic and curiously arbitrary in its application. It may, perchance, have had something to do with the ancient notion of emphasis, which the more definite isolation of a word would itself in a manner secure (see Oppert, J.A. (1857), pp. 143\u20134). At times these n\u00fcn\u2019s were clearly used for the simple purpose of barring a possible conjunction of letters that were not intended to be coupled or run into each other, as in\n\n\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0632\u06cc\u0628\u06cc \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0633\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u0622\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u0648\u0633 \u0648\u062f\u0648\u0633 Abdulaziz-i-Abdula.\u2014J.R.A.S. xii. 304.\n\nMuhammad-i-Abdula.\u2014J.R.A.S. xiii. 411.\n\n\u00b9 J.R.A.S. ix. 388, 405\u20136, 410, 413; Jour.

The Semitic from may, perhaps, be understood in the higher sense of the recipient of service, rather than in the later acceptation of the word, as \"service.\" We may here pause for a moment to mark the contrasted dialects of the joint versions in the use of the Semitic genitive prefix in the one case and the employment of the Persian Izafat in the other.\n\nThe series of words line five, line seven, and in lines eight and fourteen, have clearly a common origin in the root \"to be exalted.\" Abundant parallels of the same ruling idea are to be found in the Bible phraseology in (from , \"to ascend\"), (from , \"to be high\"). While the derivative examples are familiar to our ears in \"Rimmon, Ramah, Ramoth-Gilead,\" etc.\n\nThe and in their absolute identity of head had equally a fair analogy with and a simultaneous teaching in the conventional use of the mundane term for king, which was so often applied in its higher sense to the Divine power in the patriarchal ages.

Beyond this, there are otherwise grave difficulties in the way of reconciling the run of the passage with the preceding sentence, if Anahit or other local Deities are to conclude the list of the mundane officials subject to the reigning King, which sense I conceive the leading \u0647\u062a\u064a\u0645\u0627 must, of necessity, carry in this place. Though it is no easy matter to decide positively where the change from the enumeration of the titles of the Monarch to the invocation of the Divinity is effected, especially as the term \u0647\u062a\u064a\u0645\u0627 is applied in common to both; but it would seem that concurrence of the parallel \u0648\u0648\u0627\u0648\u0633 (\u0648) and (\u0648) at this point marks the want of continuity, which the \u0644\u064a\u0646 of the Sassanian is possibly designed to indicate in other parts of the inscription,\u00b9 and under such a view of the tenor of the epigraph, we might be justified in accepting \u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 as an imperfect reproduction of the Chaldean \u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 (Syriac \u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4) \"Ye,\" in which case a translation might be suggested of \"Ye Powerful\" (Thou, O Lord), the plural form of the pronoun being designedly employed, as in \u064a\u0632\u062f\u0627\u0646, and in the conventional pluralis excellentive of the Hebrew and other Oriental tongues.\n\nNext in order follow the words:\n\nwhich, taking the Sassanian as the clearest text, may be rendered \"also of joy among the people of the world promoting\" (\"and on earth peace, good will towards men,\" Luke ii. 14: Isaiah lvii. 19).\n\n\u00b9 The particle \u0648 is irrespective of order: \u0641 on the contrary distinguishes it.\nThe word may be taken to correspond with \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4, \"rejoicing, gladness\" (from \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc or \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc, \"to move in a circle\").\u00b9\n\nThe of the Sassanian is replaced by \u05e0\u05b0\u05d2\u05b5\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9 (or, as some copies make it, \u05e0\u05b0\u05d2\u05b5\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9) in the other version, but as the reading of \u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc is pretty well assured, we may disregard the defect of the initial \u05dc in the second text, as that letter so frequently interchanged with \u05dc.

The parallel term in the Sassanian Pehlvi is \u0647\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0646, which I suppose to be the participle present of the obscure verb \u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631\u062a\u064a, the modern \u0646\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0633, \"to place,\" and under such a continuative action of \"placing, or who places,\" the meaning would be clear, as well as in the causal verb of the counterpart writing.\n\nThe joint texts proceed:\n\nAlso of the God of Might, the Lord\u00b2 of the creator, the heavenly creator, the beloved.\n\nThe Chaldaeo-Pehlvi version varies in the substitution of\n\n\u00b9 Isaiah xxix. 19.\u2014\"Joyful even unto rejoicing.\" Job iii. 22.\n\u00b2 \"The Lord said unto my Lord.\"\u2014Ps. cx. 1.\nin place of PROVIDENTIA DEI. The may either be a very imperfect transcript of the Providentia Dei, from potuit), or it may be an independent quotation of the justice, another of the attributes of God, with the final Arabic corresponding with the Pehlvi.\n\nOne of the nearly parallel terms in these conjoint inscriptions, the root of which it is more particularly desirable to determine, is lines 7, 9, line 11, and in line 13, and in line 13. The last of which derivatives in its textual correspondence with sufficiently indicates the sense of the entire series of doubtful words, and justifies what might otherwise be considered to be an improper manipulation of the materials of the original, with a view to suit preconceived ideas of its possible interpretation; and, indeed, but few commentators would care to hazard an approximate meaning to words so similar in form but belonging to such opposite systems of speech as and , when occurring in one and the same inscription; but those who would encounter mixed Aryan and Semitic records must hold themselves prepared for similar responsibilities at every turn.\n\nOur latest authorities have already associated with the Zend Khsha\u00e9ta (\u091a\u092f\u0924\u093f-\u0924\u0947) \u201cto rule,\u201d hence \u201csplendens, dominus, rex.\u201d\u00b9 The initial as represented by the associate Aryan is quite in accord with the then existing practice, as may be seen in the concurrent , and in the name of Zoroaster, in the fifteenth tablet of the Pa\u00ef K\u00fal\u00ed Inscription. The short i is also in favour of the identification proposed, and the occurrence of in preference to the modern is alike typical of the earlier notions of orthography.\n\nThe Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi accords identically with the Sassanian\n\n\u00b9 Vullers, sub voce.

The former word is optionally rendered as Dominus on ordinary occasions, but the associate in this place and the recurrence of the same word in the next sentence in the Sassanian version seems to point to origin rather than to rank. Under such an interpretation of the passage would revert to its leading meaning of \"Valde Propinquus fuit alicui.\"\u00b9\n\nThe associate has already been noticed (p. 280), and attributed to a source in common with the Aryan , the Zend taokhma, Sanskrit \u0924\u094b\u0915\u094d, and Cuneiform Tum\u00e1, \"granum, semen, radix.\"\n\nThe Creator of heaven and earth\u00b2 is described by about the meaning or derivation of which terms there can be little question.\u00b3\n\nThe next sentence contains the words\n\nThe Anu Haddi\u00e1n I propose to connect with the (a confessedly irregular form of the nominative of the pronoun ), \"I,\" in the exalted sense of ego, as denoting the First Cause, which is symbolized in the Scriptures as \"I am that I am.\" \"I am hath sent you.\" (Exod. iii. 14).\u2074 In the present combination the words would read, \"God of other Gods.\" The of course, conveys some nearly identical meaning, and it becomes necessary to define, as far as may be, the force and origin of the frequently-recurring .

The word has been associated by some of our late Cuneiform Expositors with the meaning of \"race, family,\" etc., but without insisting upon an identification which would so singularly accord with the parallel version in this case, it may fairly be quoted as one of the possible divarications from the severe import of the original root, which is only doubtfully determined by our Lexicographers as \"to be smooth,\"\u00b3 \"to escape,\" hence \"to survive,\" and \"to live;\" also \"to let escape, to deliver,\" and inferentially, \"to bring forth.\" In another sense the derivatives carry the idea of \"life,\" while the word signifies \"whom Jehovah makes distinguished.\" The concluding \"of him,\" sufficiently declares itself.\n\n\u00b9 Compare Sanskrit \u090f\u0915 \"one,\" \u090f\u0915\u0924\u093e \"unity\" (oneness in theology).\nPersian \"unus,\" \"unus, unicus,\" \"unitas,\" \"unitas Dei,\" \"God,\" etc. A curious example of the definition of the first cause or supreme universal spirit, occurs on a coin of Mahmud of Ghazni, struck at Mahmudpur\u2014in the Sanskrit translation and reproduction of the Muslim by the word \"the invisible one.\" The provincial version of \"the indiscrete, the invisible one,\" J.

It will have been noticed that the parallel texts of the Inscription are careful to avoid the use of the term \"Son\" in reference to Our Lord, though Sapor is freely defined as \"Son,\" and \"Son's Son;\" but the \u0648\u0644\u064a\u060c \u062a\u0647\u064a\u060c and \u05e4\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d4, which appeared, at first sight, to be undue shortcomings, seem to have been, in reality, guarded and designed limitations, which consistently coincide with the idea of direct and special \"creation by the Almighty,\" without entering too definitely into the mode or method, which would be incomprehensible to and far beyond the range of average local thought.\n\nThere are serious obstacles in the way of any conclusive determination of the value of the word \u05d3\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9, which it will\n\n1 Here is a statement of the case as given by Tabari: \"Quand la religion de J\u00e9sus fut tr\u00e8s-repandue, Eblis fit son apparition, et un jour de f\u00eate, lorsqu'un grande nombre d'hommes, sectateurs de J\u00e9sus, \u00e9tait r\u00e9uni dans le temple de J\u00e9rusalem, il s'y pr\u00e9senta accompagn\u00e9 de deux Divs\" (saying) \"nous avons voulu entendre ce que vous dites concernant J\u00e9sus.

Je pense que Dieu est le p\u00e8re de J\u00e9sus. L'un des Divs dit : Cette parole est un non-sens, car Dieu n'a pas d'enfants et n'a pas commerce avec une femme; mais J\u00e9sus c'est Dieu m\u00eame, qui est descendu du ciel et est entr\u00e9 dans le sein de Marie; il en est sorti pour se montrer aux hommes, sous la forme d'un homme, puis il est retourn\u00e9 au ciel, car Dieu a le pouvoir d'\u00eatre o\u00f9 il veut et de montrer aux hommes ce qu'il veut.

So also Abgar, in his letter to Our Saviour, evidently leant to the first conception, \"either that thou art God, and having descended from heaven,\" in preference to the alternative, \"or else doing them, thou art the Son of God.\" Eusebius, Eccl.

In the first place it is not by any means beyond possibility that they may both be verbs, the one from the Chaldaean \u0647\u0648\u064a and \u0647\u0648\u064a \"to be,\" the other from the Persian \u0647\u0648\u064a \"to be.\"\n\nAn objection likewise exists to a too ready acceptance of the \u0647\u0648\u064a in the sense of \"ye,\" as it would appear that another form of the second person plural of the pronoun had already been used in an earlier portion of this inscription (line 6); however this argument need not unconditionally condemn the identification, as either one form or the other is sufficiently irregular, as is the nominative \u0647\u0648\u064a itself, and the inscription in its several parts varies considerably in its current provincialisms. But singular to say, the evidence to sustain the proposed interpretation is contributed by a second inconsistency in the very body of the text, where (in line 11) we find the word \u0647\u0648\u064a, associated with the same \u0647\u0648\u064a\u2014the former of which obviously suggests the Arabic \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064e \"thou\" as the \u0647\u0648\u064a seems to fall into some vernacular adaptation of the Arabic (feminine) plural \u0623\u0646\u062a\u064e \"you\" (\u0647\u0648\u064a \"you\").\n\nC. Pehlevi.\u2014The powerful... of the chosen Jews ye (are).\nSassanian.\u2014The Supreme Lord of the Jews outside the (ancient) rites, he (is).\n\nThe opening word in this sentence requires both comment and justification, the crude \u0627\u062f of the text I suppose to represent the now conventional \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629, \"custom, usage, rite,\" etc. In most of the modern facsimiles the final \u062a has been resolved into two independent letters (\u062a), which would convert the original into the word \u0623\u062f\u064a\u0646; but this severance of the component elements of a single letter is an error of frequent and almost natural recurrence among those who were either ignorant of the true forms of the character, or set themselves to trace\n\n1 E.g. especially in the conjunctions \u0627\u062f\u060c \u0627\u062f\u060c \u0648. There are other indications, likewise, of an interval having occurred between the endorsement or preparation of the introductory portions and the conclusions of these proclamations.\nwords to which they could not assign a meaning. The present rectification is, however, sufficiently supported by Flandin's design.\n\nIt is scarcely possible to be mistaken in the Persian individuality of the word \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0646, \"outside, exterior,\" which in its multifarious combinations enters so largely into the homespeech of the land of which Persepolis was once the metropolis; and within whose local circuit, in secluded crypts and caverns, the present epigraphs have been so strangely preserved.\n\nThe \u067e\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u0627\u0644\u06a9 is a title of more doubtful allegiance; its value, in connexion with the frequent reiteration of one of its compound terms, within the limits of this brief record, should fully suffice to determine its second element, while the ever present \u067e\u06cc\u062a of the contemporary Inscriptions in less adulterated Pehlvi, establishes a priori, a definite suggestion and understanding of the Eastern Pati (\u092a\u0924\u093f). A somewhat similar compound under our Western adaptation is well-known and uniformly identified with the Patriarchs of the Christian Church. I do not seek to decide upon either one or the other derivation. I have only to reconcile in this place the possible want of discrimination by either party of the true origin of such closely approximating sounds; but it is singular that Masaudi should have affirmed that the Christians derived all their clerical titles and designations from the Sabaeans of Harran (\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0626\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0631\u062b\u064a\u064a\u0646), though he honestly retains the dubious r in \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0637\u0631\u06a9, which alone creates any difficulty in the present\n\n---\n\n1 French edition, vol. i., p. 198. \"Les Sab\u00e9ens de Harran, qui ne sont que les disciples grossiers des Grecs, et la lie des philosophes anciens, ont \u00e9tabli dans leur temples une hi\u00e9rarchie de pr\u00eatres qui correspond aux neuf sph\u00e8res; le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 porte le nom de Ras Koumra (chef des pr\u00eatres, \u0631\u0623\u0633 \u0643\u0648\u0645\u0631\u0629).

In this instance the designation responds, in the order of sequence, to the \u05d7\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b4\u05d9 of the conjoint Sassanian version. Immediately following the former of these words, in its own lapidary context, we find in clear and definitely-formed letters, and in full integrity and isolation, on the surface of the recent plaster casts of the still extant original, the three letters constituting the name of Our Saviour.\n\nOf these three literal signs, the two quasi vowels, or, properly, mere carrying consonants of the Semitic system, are entirely dependent upon the true vowel sounds appropriate to the written word; but in these periods of undeveloped grammar such subduced but highly important elements of speech were altogether unprovided with definite graphic exponents.\n\nUnder such reservation as regards later and more elaborated schemes of orthography, many versions of the test letters \u05d1\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9 might be suggested, but the most simple and obvious of them would still revert to a very exact counterpart of the name of Jesus, whether out of its many declared varieties we select the Hebrew or the Greek series of definitions. Amid all the various adaptations of the old \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9, whether Joshua, Jeshua, Josue, Jesu, or \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, there is still the same basis in\n\n\u00b9 The Armenian der, \u201cMouratzan-der\u201d Seigneur des M\u00e8des.\u2014Mos.

But Flandin's facsimile, which has evidently been traced with a scrupulous desire for accuracy, indicates the existence of a fissure or disintegration of the surface of the rock, just at this very point, and extending downwards through the succeeding lines, while the tracing equally indicates by the distance between the two words as nearly as possible the space required for the three missing letters.\n\nThe \u0645\u064f\u0646\u0652\u0648\u0650\u062f\u0650\u064a\u064c of, so to say, both epigraphs, seems clear enough, though it may be needful to explain the preference here assigned to the translation of \"aid\" over the more common rendering of \"hand.\" Persian Dictionaries draw a very nice, but seemingly just discrimination, being the singular and plural forms of one and the same word: \u064a\u064e\u062f\u064c is essentially \"a hand,\" but in the sequent rationale of \"power,\" the subordinate combinations extended over a very enlarged range of significations: in the Hebrew the derivatives were comparatively restricted, but in the Arabic these divarications concentrated sooner or later, in the Persian vocabularies, into the plural \u064a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u064a\u064c in the leading sense of \"aid, assistance, succour,\" and in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the adapted alphabet of the Persian Jews, made use of in the Bible Society's New Testament, the name is written \u064a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u064a\u064c. It is as well that all objections to the apparent absence of an initial \u05d9 or \u05d9od in this unquestionably important name in the present text, should be answered in anticipation by a citation of the \u05d9\u05b5\u05d3\u05b6\u05d9 of line ten, where the expressed *alif* initial clearly defines a simple \u05d9 or a *Jod* of Hebrew Grammar. See also the prosthetic in \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0 and in \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0. On the other hand, there need be no reserve in admitting that, under the licence claimed above, the name may be converted into many other modified forms, but notably into \u0639\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0635\u064c, \"a sign,\" (or possibly \u0639\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0635\u064c uz, or even \u0639\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0646\u064c, \"refuge\"). However, it is the essentially Christian characteristics and general tenor of the document that chiefly recommends the reading advocated in the text.\nsome cases even to the signification of \"repentance\" (\"Poenitentia\" Freytag). The \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05d9 of the parallel version might be quoted in support of the duplication of the final in \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 only that this would not be altogether a safe argument in the presence of the exceptional (emphatic) \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05d9 of the Chaldaean vernacular in Daniel v. 5, 24, though probably any such heritage had been subdued by contact with the mixed dialects of more Southern latitudes.\n\nThe word \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0 Naba would at first sight naturally suggest the obvious interpretation of \"Prophet,\" but taken in connexion with the \u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9 of the counterpart transcript it will be necessary to elevate its meaning into \"Lord,\" or a later adaptation of the ancient \"Nebo,\" as derived from the root \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9, \"Editus, elatus fuit,\"\u00b9 \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0, \"to be prominent,\" and not as having any direct connexion with \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0, \"to pour forth.\"\n\nThe article \u05d4\u05b7 the prefixed to the \u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9, which gives force to the parallel term, would altogether remove the joint titles far above the grade of a mere \u05d5\u05b6\u05ea\u05b6\u05e1 or \"prophesier.\" The effect of the double letters of the current speech \u05e8\u05b5\u05d1 and \u05e8\u05b5\u05d1 seems to have been sought in graphic expression by the lengthening the vowel sound of \u05e8\u05b5\u05d1 into \u05e8\u05b5\u05d1, as in the analogous case of \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05b5\u05d9, which was the substitute for the dominant Arabic \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0643\u064e (the modern Persian \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0643\u064e).\n\nThe texts next reiterate the passages from lines 6, 7.\n\n\u05e0\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9 \u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 \u05d3\u05b0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\n\nC. Pehlvi.\u2014... well sustaining joy among the people of this world.\n\nSassanian.\u2014... well upholds joy among the people of the earth.\n\nIt will be noticed that there is an addition in this line to the previous formula, in the introduction of two new words, which are expressed in mere letters as \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 and \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9 respectively, to which I myself have but cautiously, and, at last, of very necessity, admitted a perhaps over simple meaning.\n\n\u00b9 Arabic lexicographers bring the whole series of parallel terms for Prophet under the common root \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9.\nBut having reached thus much of the conventionality of the then local speech, so marked *in situ*, and so singularly preserved in the dependent ramifications of the more advanced vernacular in its ultimate spread, I feel that but few will be found to contest the data the rock records of the middle of the third century A.D. so strangely reproduce as specimens of the crude prayers and invocations of a new faith, neither the matter nor manner of which was fully understood by the compiler of the inscription.\n\nBut of all the quaint problems that have presented themselves during the course of this rather tedious development of a complicated and obscure bilingual manifesto, no single item has afforded so much of a surprise as this *Hip* of the Chaldaean texts, which even the most daring ingenuity would scarcely have ventured to coerce into the modern Persian conversational and sonorously aspirated *Kh\u00fcb*; unless the fellow version had contributed both the first hint and the simultaneous proof of the correctness of the assignment; even now, many critics may refuse to see the Greek *\u03b5\u1f50* in the *\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd* of the Sassanian writing, especially as the meaning, in either case, so oddly accords with the general tendency of the translation which I may be supposed to be too hastily advocating.\n\nC.

However, as any possible divarication from the leading intention of these epigraphs must, after all, revert to the general tenets of the Christian faith, we have only to accept this singular Eastern paraphrase of portions of our own authorised version, and, under such a concession, frankly to test and compare its very limited departure either in words or ideas from the Greek of the New Testament, on which we base our own interpretation.\n\nThe first of the remaining difficulties consists of a question of grammar, which was at this time, necessarily, but little subject to fixed laws; and even had the parts of speech been in any way reduced to a recognised and defined system, the eccentric intermixture of words, phrases, and constructive identities of this Camp language,\\(^1\\) would release a modern interpreter from any reserve in dealing with doubtful or exceptional terms of minor significance.\n\n\\(^1\\) The direct effect of Sapor's campaigns to the westward upon the Court language of Persia has been for long past fully recognised and understood (Mohl, Preface to Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah), but we could scarcely have anticipated its resulting in so incoherent a polyglot as these Bilingual texts present us with. It is true that Persepolis was peculiarly situated in regard to conterminous languages, both old and new, and Sapor's freshly imported Arama\u00efsms may have added to the normal difficulties; but much of the imperfection of these writings is undoubtedly due to the novelty of the subject, and to the impossibility of rendering whatever may have been the peculiar form of the recognised sacred text, into degraded Persian vernaculars, with even a remote chance of its essential meaning ultimately reaching the understanding of the less educated masses. And this, indeed, is the fatal obstacle to all Christian teaching in India at the present day,\u2014not that we English are unfaithful, or unwilling, but that Eastern and Western thoughts and deductions start from different bases of symbolical ideals. Though the whole question only amounts to this, after all, that our Western instruction in Christianity commenced later in the world's history, and under the influence of comparatively advanced knowledge and more or less purified teaching. Europe at large received the Gospel in its best form, but every step it went Eastward, it had from the first to encounter hostilities and to submit to concessions of a character calculated to degrade its sublimity,\u2014it was, in effect, the going back to old and self-willed races, instead of carrying welcome tidings to simple but intelligent, though undeveloped peoples.\nUnder the most simple and ordinary processes of critical analysis of an epigraph freely abounding in both Hebrew and Arabic terms, it might almost be taken for granted that the word \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0652} \\), in lines twelve and thirteen, merely reproduced the established \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0652} \\), \\( \\text{\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0652} \\), \"all,\" of the authorized speech of those confessedly leading Semitic authorities; and though, with some straining, it might be possible to connect the word, in a vague way, with a suggestion of \"universality,\" it is far preferable to let it down into the quietude of its more direct associations, and to suppose that \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0652} \\) is nothing more than a local reflex of the Arabic article \\( \\text{\u0627\u0644\u0652} \\), \"the.\" It is quite true that in this very version the corresponding Hebrew \\( \\text{\u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9} \\) (for \\( \\text{\u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9} \\)) has been recognised in its proper and correct form; but in so strangely composite a manifesto as the present, simplicity, or a reduction to primitive elements, is the only true safeguard towards ultimate elucidation; and as we know, on the other hand, that the Persian tongue was then (as it is now) altogether deficient in any representative of our ever-recurring definite article \"the,\" which, in these combinations of languages, it had to borrow with more or less sonal aptitude from neighbouring nations; can it then be felt strange that the severe \"l\u00e1m, of definition,\" with its prosthetic \\( \\text{\u0644\u0652} \\), at this time only colloquially developed, should have been so readily merged into the Sassanian \\( \\text{\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0652} \\) or the but faintly removed Chald\u00e6an \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0652} \\) now under discussion.\n\nThe leading derivation and ample duties of \\( \\text{\u0643\u064e\u0645\u0652} \\); have already been referred to (p. 282), and the \\( \\text{\u0647\u064e\u0648\u064e} \\), \\( \\text{\u0643\u064e\u0645\u0652} \\), \"he,\" of the associate text, scarcely admits of doubt.\n\nThe single word that still remains to be noticed is the \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e} \\), which seems to resolve itself into the Arabic interjection \\( \\text{\u0625\u0650\u064a} \\) (Persian \\( \\text{\u0627\u06cc} \\)) \"oh,\" prefixed to the word \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e} \\) (here written \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e} \\)), \"increase, addition,\" etc. (from \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e} \\), \"increvit\"). This combination may appear strange and the exclamation somewhat out of place; but in regard to \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e} \\), it must be remembered how constantly the exact synonym \\( \\text{\u0645\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e} \\), \"increase,\" was in use,\u2014to such an extent, indeed, that the Pehlvi\ncame to hold the place of honour on the obverse field of the later Sassanian coins, and was retained intact by the Arabs in their imitative coinage, and only disappeared with the latest Pehlvi mintage of Taberist\u00e1n in A.H. 138.\\(^1\\)\n\n**Parallel Translations of the H\u00e1j\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d Inscription.**\n\n*(For text see page 314 and the Photograph.)*\n\n**Chaldeo-Pehlvi Version:** Representations of the person of the Sassanian Version: Representations of the person of the Zoroastrian divinity,\\(^2\\) Sapor, King of Kings of Arians and Anarians, astrian divinity, Sapor, King of Kings of Ir\u00e1n and Anir\u00e1n, of divine origin from God, son of the Zoroastrian divinity, Ardesh\u00edr, divine origin from God, son of the Zoroastrian divinity, Artahshatr, King of Kings of Arians, of divine origin from God, grandson of divine King of Kings of Ir\u00e1n, of divine origin from God, grandson of divine Papak, King.

As far as honest criticism extends, I court and desire it; but I would suggest to those who may propose to make capital for themselves out of my treatment of this record, to beware of the many pitfalls existing in so incoherent and singularly mixed a text, the limited extent of which forbids the application of any such comprehensive tests as its confessedly polyglot nature would demand; and in this sense I do not invite future commentators to wander over other applicable roots, or to suggest variations in the derivatives above cited; but I simply ask them to produce some more consistent and convincing version out of the given fourteen lines here reconstructed from the confessedly imperfect materials at present within reach.\u00b9\n\nIt is of importance to fix as nearly as possible the period of\n\n\u00b9 It may, perhaps, prove an inducement and an encouragement to those who might otherwise feel diffident in entering upon a free and independent analysis of future improved versions of the leading texts\u2014to learn that Sir H.

I have already remarked (pp. 328, 337) upon the change in style and modification of certain expressions to be observed in the concluding part of the document; but further than this, a close examination of the original writing discloses, most distinctly, a parallel variation in the general run of the letters themselves; for, whereas, the first five lines of the Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi text\\(^1\\) are, so to say, compact in the ordinary sequence of the characters, the remaining portion, and notably, the conclusion of the inscription, is not only less closely filled in, but the words are designedly and effectively separated from one another,\u2014a condition of things that would imply not only that the original surface of the rock had been prepared for a longer legend than it now bears, but that the commencement and conclusion of the existing epigraph pertain to different epochs, even as their tenor, at first sight, seems inconsistent and conflicting within such brief limits; but, singular to say, these apparent anomalies conduce to a most reasonable explanation of what would otherwise undoubtedly have constituted a serious difficulty in the completeness of the proposed interpretation. As it is, I suppose the introductory section, containing the formal enumeration of the King's titles and descent, with his claims to divine honors, extending, inter alia, to a subdued profession of Zoroastrianism itself, to have been endorsed at some early period of his reign, after he had discarded the use of the Greek translations, in the addition of which he had at first followed his father's lead (Inscrip. No. iv.); but before he had altogether abandoned the employment of the accustomed Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi duplicate version, and confined himself to the use of simple Persian-Pehlvi, which survived as the sole Court and official method of epigraphy among his successors. Under such a theory, I should associate the abrupt change in the tenor of the body of the document with the Western influences to which Sapor was subjected after his conquest of Valerian, a period which oddly coincides with the commencement of the teaching of Manes.\n\n\\(^1\\) The sixth line of the Sassanian Pehlvi likewise presents a perceptible but less obvious modification of the forms of letters employed in the opening sentence.\nIt is possible that this individual, who\u2014though born a Persian\u2014had graduated as a Christian Presbyter in Babylonia, may have been the direct means of converting the victorious monarch of his own land to the true faith; while the disruption of the association and the precipitate flight of Manes from Persia may have been due to a premature attempt on his part to compromise his Sovereign by lowering Christianity to the dead level of the masses, or by too facile concessions to the dominant Zoroastrianism, but lately so powerfully reconstructed under Ardeshir Babag\u00e1n. However, be this as it may, it is clear that Sapor was an oddly-confessed convert,\u2014no subject, high or low, under an Eastern despotism, would have dared to add such sentences as are to be found in this inscription without the sanction of the reigning Monarch; nor can we suppose that if Sapor had ever reverted to the newly defined creed of his fathers, he would have allowed this formal record of his adhesion to a more enlightened religion to have remained undisturbed till his death. The return of Manes after the decease of Sapor, and the favour with which he was received by Hormuzdas I., are both significant; for, if the new king had been a confirmed Fire-worshipper, he would scarcely have tolerated even the scant measure of debased Christianity Manes to the last professed to expound.\n\n1 It has for long past been known and acknowledged that Sapor had abandoned the creed of his fathers, though it was supposed that he had accepted the tenets of Manes. The following is Masaudi's notice on the subject:\u2014\"Ce fut sous son r\u00e8gne que parut Man\u00e8s, l'auteur du dualisme. Sabour abjura la religion des mages pour embrasser cette secte et les doctrines qu'elle professait sur la lumi\u00e8re et le moyen du combattre le principe des t\u00e9n\u00e8bres; mais il revint plus tard au culte de ses anc\u00eatres, et Man\u00e8s, pour des motifs que nous avons rapport\u00e9s dans nos r\u00e9cits pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, dut se r\u00e9fugier dans l'Inde.\"\u2014Masaudi, cap. xxiv. vol. ii., p. 164, Paris \u00e9dit.\u2014\"C'est du vivant de Man\u00e8s que fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 le mot zendil, qui a donn\u00e9 naissance au zendekeh (manich\u00e9isme). En voici l'explication: Zeradecht fils d'Espiman, ... avait apport\u00e9 aux Perses le livre Bestah, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans leur ancienne langue.

(Narses.)\n\nThis unique inscription of Narses is engraved on one of the bas-reliefs at Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, which represents the young monarch in the act of receiving the conventional investiture of the cydaris from Ormazd. The figure of the latter is but little varied from the ordinary portraiture of prior date. He wears the recognised mural crown, with the closely twisted curls rising above it, and similar curls, arranged in the Sassanian fashion, appear on the sides and back of the head. The beard is squared in the ancient style, and the flowing fillets expand at the back of the figure. He has, however, in this instance, no baton, and the folds of the dress have more of a feminine guise than usual. Narses appears as a fair and comely youth, with a light moustache and incipient beard, which, however, is tied determinedly towards the point, after the manner affected by Sapor I. The hair is curled in full and smooth ringlets. His dress, like that of Ormazd, and the trappings of both horses, are unusually plain. He wears a pointedly-spiked crown of a form not yet met with in the sculptures, but which is seen to have been previously in use with Varahran I. on the coinage of the country. The authorized balloon-crest and floating fillets complete the picture.\n\nThis inscription was first published by Morier, in his work upon Persia, Armenia, etc., but the copy there given is truncated in the completion of the lines, two of which (Nos. nine and ten) are wholly omitted, and the letters are so badly formed that it offered but little promise to the decipherer. M. Flandin\u2019s reproduction of the original is far more satisfactory, and leaves but little to be filled in by a fairly confident interpreter.\n\nIt will be seen that in the inscription Narses describes himself as the son of Sapor and grandson of Ardesh\u00edr, whereas\n\n1 Flandin, \"Inscription du troisi\u00e8me bas-relief sur la rive droite de la rivi\u00e8re.\" Plan, plate 45, bas-relief E.

By a critical examination of these writings, Sir Henry has been enabled to rectify the constituents of the much-canvassed \"Vohiya\" of previous translators, and to establish the true value of the word, in the more natural \u0634\u06cc\u0627, a correction of considerable importance, in that, while demonstrating the authorized provincial or epochally progressive substitution of two 22's for the legitimate archaic form of 22 sh, and thus adding to the general ambiguity of Pehlvi interpretation on the one hand, it extends a new latitude to the optional reconstruction of many obscure passages, which had hitherto been circumscribed by the already sufficiently dubious phonetic powers of the leading basis here duplicated 2, which, under ordinary circumstances, had to respond alike for the powers of r and w, and to meet the manifest incertitudes involved in the technical licence of subordinate convertibilities.\n\nThese lapidary epigraphs have also proved of service in contributing a modified form of the ordinary ch, in the shape of , a contour of the letter frequently met with on gems, and which was otherwise liable to be mistaken for a simple h. The intentionally final i's are also very carefully defined, in marked contrast to the ordinary initial and medial vowel, a practice which is also scrupulously observed in the majority of the signet legends.\n\nThe statues of the two Sapors, father and son, in this bas-relief, are strangely alike, a similarity extending even to the minor details of their garments. In Ker Porter's copy, the father, who stands to the right, seems to be the larger man; but the difference in Flandin's sketch is not so apparent. The former author represents the faces of both kings as having been completely destroyed; but Flandin, having possibly cleaned the surface of the stone more effectually, reconstructs their features after the ordinary Sassanian physiognomy, with the curiously tied beards and bushy hair. Both monarchs stand to the front, with their hands crossed on the\nhilts of their straight swords, and the only difference to be detected between them is the half-moon which, in Flandin's drawing, figures as a frontlet on the crown of Sapor III.\n\nThe sculptured figures of the two kings in their near identity of treatment would seem to imply that they must have been executed almost simultaneously, and the juxtaposition itself may possibly have been designed to mark in one and the same field the father's recognition of the heirship of this particular son, who eventually succeeded to his throne in the ordinary course.\n\n**Inscription No. 8.\u2014Sh\u00e1hp\u00far II.

Le premier \u00e9tait un anneau (\u062e\u0627\u062a\u0645) de diamant dont le chaton \u00e9tait form\u00e9 d'un rubis rouge sur lequel on avait grav\u00e9 le portrait du roi ; la l\u00e9gende portait les titres du roi ; on l'apposait sur les lettres et les dipl\u00f4mes. Le second \u00e9tait un anneau (\u062e\u0627\u062a\u0645) d'or surmont\u00e9 d'une cornaline sur laquelle \u00e9taient grav\u00e9s les mots Khora\u00e7\u00e1n Khudah (\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0635\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u062f\u0627). Il servait aux archives de l'\u00c9tat. Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tait orn\u00e9 d'un onyx repr\u00e9sentant un cavalier au galop ; l'anneau (\u062d\u0644\u0642\u0629), qui \u00e9tait d'or, portait pour l\u00e9gende : c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9. Ce cachet \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 la correspondance des postes. Le quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tait un anneau d'or dont le chaton, form\u00e9 d'un rubis rose, avait pour l\u00e9gende : la richesse est la source de la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9. C'\u00e9tait le sceau des dipl\u00f4mes et des lettres de gr\u00e2ce. Le cinqui\u00e8me, orn\u00e9 d'un rubis bahremdin, . . . portait les mots khourch wa khorrem (\u062e\u0648\u0631\u0634 \u0648 \u062e\u0631\u0645) \"splendeur et f\u00e9licit\u00e9.\" Ce cachet \u00e9tait pos\u00e9 sur le tr\u00e9sor des pierres pr\u00e9cieuses sur la cassette royale, la garde-robe et les ornements de la couronne. Le sixi\u00e8me, repr\u00e9sentant un aigle, servait \u00e0 seeller les d\u00e9p\u00eaches adress\u00e9es aux rois \u00e9trangers ; son chaton \u00e9tait en fer de Chine (\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0635\u064a\u0646\u064a). Le septi\u00e8me, surmont\u00e9 d'un b\u00e9zoard sur lequel on avait grav\u00e9 une mouche, \u00e9tait pos\u00e9 sur les mets servis au roi, sur les m\u00e9dicaments et les parfums. Le huiti\u00e8me, dont le chaton \u00e9tait form\u00e9 d'une perle, avait pour effigie une t\u00eate de porc (Journal Asiatique, 1863, p. 304) ; on posait cette empreinte sur le cou des condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 mort et sur les arr\u00eats emportant la peine capitale.

We learn from Captain Montgomerie's report of the great Tibetan road from Lhasa to Gartokh (Times, 2nd March, 1868) \"that the couriers go continuously, stopping neither night nor day except to eat and change horses, and, after an 800 miles' ride, are haggard and worn . . . to make sure that they shall not take off their clothes they are sealed over the breast, and none may break the seal save him to whom the messenger is sent.\"\n\nFor confirmation of these facts, see also the \"Friend of India\" (Calcutta), 23rd March, 1868. \"The moment a man is selected as a courier, and his coat is sealed, he has no choice in the matter.\"\nclad multitudes, they were simply suspended round the neck, while the better classes seem to have worn them either on the wrist or as an armlet.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe first of these seals is engraved on the highly-prized amethyst belonging to the Duke of Devonshire. The second is now known only by its reproduction in a work of the last century, entitled \"Tassie's Gems.\" It would seem to have proved from the first a mere artist's failure both in the portrait and in the imperfection of the legend, and to have been superseded by the more elaborately engraved design, giving the accepted likeness of the Prince, with his style and contrasted royal titles encompassing it in the Pehlvi character. The portrait, in this instance, presents a remarkable specimen\n\n\\(^1\\) This arrangement is shown to have been in immemorial acceptation in the far East, by numerous passages in the Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah; among the rest, when Rustam takes leave of his wife Tahminah, the daughter of the king of Samang\u00e1n, we are told\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u0628\u0627\u0632\u0648\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u062a\u0645 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0647\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0646\u0641\u062a\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u06af\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u062a \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u06af\u0627\u0631}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{\u0628\u06af\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u06af\u06cc\u0633\u0648 \u0627\u0648 \u0628\u0631 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u0646\u06cc\u06a9 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0627 \u0641\u0627\u0644 \u06af\u06cc\u062a\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0632}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0632 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0627 \u067e\u0633\u0631 \u0628\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0634 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0633aran \u0628\u062f\u0631}\n\\]\n\nMohl.

The inscription, however, breaks off abruptly, though the introductory portion follows the arrangement of the lines of the legend above given, while the which follows in line after the \u0633\u0644\u06a9\u0627, and the reduced size of the letters of the name of Varahr\u00e1n, sufficiently establish that the first published design is not a mere vague copy of the more finished seal.

The signet we have now to deal with as clearly declares its associations, though in a less formal manner, inasmuch as the style of head-dress borne by the chief figure typifies the conventionally distinguishing crown of Varahr\u00e1n IV. as \"king of kings,\" or after his accession to Imperial honors.\n\nThe seals of the deceased Sassanian princes were, without doubt, religiously preserved in the Jewel Treasuries of the family, who, as we have seen, were sufficiently jealous and punctilious in these matters; so that nothing short of a total disruption of dynastic ties would be likely to have scattered abroad such cherished symbols of ancestral domination; but precisely such an extreme convulsion took place some 250 years\n\n---\n\n1 Tassie's Gems (London, 1791), pl. xii. fig. 673, vol. i. p. 66. See also Ouseley's \"Medals and Gems\" (London, 1801).\n2 The date of this event is not very exactly determined, but it may be placed in 389 A.D., with a reign of ten years, extending to 399 A.D.

Cunningham, to whom I am indebted for my present knowledge of it, as well as for many recent obligations of the same nature.\n\nThe seal is sunk into a dark onyx, upon whose upper surface a milk-white film has been allowed to remain. It is stated to have been obtained from R\u00e1wal P\u00edndi, in the Punj\u00e1b.\n\nOn the first cursory inspection of the device, a suggestion arose as to whether the standing figure might not represent the oft-recurring Sapor I. with the prostrate Valerian at his feet? But it was felt that, as a general rule, the coin portraiture of each Sassanian king had been intentionally reduced to a definite typical model in respect to the form of the crown,\u2014which suffices, even in these days, to determine, with almost invariable precision, the individual monarch to whom any given piece should be assigned, however obscure or defaced the descriptive legends may chance to be.\n\nArdeshir Babeg\u00e1n, and more notably Sapor I., as we have seen, varied with the progress of their arms the forms and representative devices of their crowns; but their successors\n\n---\n\n1 After the battle of Kadesia, the spoils, after deducting one-fifth for the Khalif, were divided among the sixty thousand horsemen at the estimated rate of 12,000 din\u00e1rs each!\u2014Price, Muhammadan Hist. i. 117, 120, 121.\n\n2 There are odd tales, alike, of the Conquerors, from the desert, offering gold for the better-known silver, and of their being unable to distinguish camphor from salt, etc.; but in regard to the number of precious stones stored up and partially adapted to the purposes of Oriental display, there can be no question. The carpet of \"Cloth of Gold,\" of 60 cubits square, had its pattern fashioned of jewels of the highest value. This was cut up into small pieces, \"one of which, of the size only of the palm of a man's hand,\" was afterwards sold for 20,000 dirhams; or, as others say, for the same number of din\u00e1rs.\"\u2014See Price, 117, 121, 122, etc.\nnecessarily exercised less licence in this respect, though the sculptured representations were not always bound by Mint laws. The first monarch who adopted, on the public money, the design of head-dress introduced by Sapor I. (as figured in page 62), was Varahr\u00e1n II., at least to this particular one of the several kings of the name, are all coins distinguished by this style of head-gear, by common consent, attributed; and to Varahr\u00e1n IV. are assigned, by the equally arbitrary decisions of Numismatists, all those pieces that are marked by the subsidiary modification upon the earlier form; comprised in the introduction of the projecting front of the mural crown, in advance of the established eagle\u2019s wings; and it is this peculiarity alone that, in the present state of our knowledge, determines the attribution of the seal to the last-named ruler.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe subordinate prostrate figure is evidently designed to represent a Roman warrior, but the semblance of the \u201clau-reated\u201d Valerian of the sculptures is altogether abandoned; and though it may be freely admitted that the helmet, with the flowing plume, here depicted, is identical with the design adhered to in the leading Imperial mintages of his period,\\(^2\\) yet it must be remembered that there were many such western casques left behind in Persia, to serve as models for artistic\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Some of the local historical authors pretend to give descriptions of each Sassanian king\u2019s costume in succession, from a book of portraits, which was supposed to carry considerable authenticity.

The description of the crown in the original text is couched in the following terms:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0648 \u062a\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u062e\u0636\u0631 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u062b\u0644\u062b \u0634\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u0645\u0627\u0632\u0631\u0686 \u0630\u0647\u0628} \\]\n\nThe \u0634\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a may possibly refer to the three projections of the mural crown (\u0634\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0629 Pinna arcis vel muri).

Varahr\u00e1n reproduces a similar idea, but replaces the lion by the type of the normal national adversary. There is no record, as far as can be ascertained, of Varahr\u00e1n having personally encountered the Romans after his accession,\\(^2\\) but it is not impossible that he may have fleshed his maiden sword during the campaigns of his father, Sapor II., against Constantius, Julian, and Jovian, or on later chance occasions; and hence may have adopted this emblematic device on his seal, as Sulla adhered to the gem which depicted his early success against Jugurtha.\\(^3\\)\n\nI conclude this r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the extant Sassanian inscriptions by a reference to two mural epigraphs at Persepolis, copied by Sir Wm. Ouseley in 1811,\\(^4\\) which, as far as I am aware of, have not been reproduced by any other traveller.\\(^5\\) The original writing does not seem to have afforded a very favourable text, and the coarse and straggling lithographed copy inserted in \"Ouseley's Travels,\" is anything but encouraging\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, 154; Ker Porter, ii., pl. 54, etc.; Flandin, iii., pls. 121 bis, 122, 123, etc.; G.

I have given a few broken specimens of the more legible portions, from which it would seem that the one inscription refers to Sapor II., and the other to Sapor III. The style of the associated inscriptions varies considerably, both in words and letters.

The word \\( \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0634 \\) occurs once if not twice in those portions of the text in which I have not as yet succeeded in tracing a running context sufficient to justify even a suggestive restoration.\n\nIt will be noticed that the genealogy of Sapor III., as given in No. xii., differs from that recorded at T\u0101k-i-Bust\u0101n: here he is represented as the great-grandson of Varahr\u0101n, while in the Northern inscriptions (Nos. viii. x.), where his own descent is carried up two generations, and extended in his father\u2019s official pedigree to a common ancestor, the great grandfather would appear to have been Narses. But even supposing Sir W.

A.)\n\nInscription No. xiii.\n\nIn order that I may not be supposed to have neglected any of the materials for the illustration of my subject, within reach, I devote a momentary notice to the seven lines of comparatively modern Pehlvi that have been engraved upon the bas-relief (B) at Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The subject of this sculpture is one of the many repetitions of the investiture of Ardeshir Babeg\u00e1n by Ormazd, and in itself presents little worthy of comment beyond the greater simplicity of the garments of the persons represented, and the peculiarity that Ormazd\u2019s baton is exchanged for a pointed saw-edged sword. Of the purport of the inscription, it may be as well to attempt to say nothing, as Flandin\u2019s copy is more than usually illegible, a difficulty, perhaps, inherent in the more complicated writing. The letters, where decipherable, present undoubtedly modern forms of the normal types. The epigraph has been cut in the vacant space between the Divinity and the King, and reads upwards, perpendicularly, instead of horizontally, as in the established usage. We may conclude that the inscription has been added at a period considerably later than the first execution of the sculpture, to record for posterity the interpretation put upon the tableau, while Pehlvi still continued the current language of the country.\n\n1 Flandin, plate 44.\nThe marginal engraving of a Carnelian Seal lately acquired by the British Museum (No. 12 3) is inserted for the purpose of illustrating the use of the word \u0628\u0644\u0643 (p. 40; Hyde, p. 358, \"Bilagh, quorum hoc ultimatum magis peculiariter Flammam notare videtur\"). The woodcut has been executed in Germany, but it must be confessed that much of the strange presentation of the device is due to the conventional treatment of the original gem, rather than to the shortcomings of the modern artist. The stone, moreover, has suffered from a fracture, which runs entirely across its surface, and is especially damaging to the forehead of the profile. The legend is as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0632\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0631\u064a \u0632\u064a \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0644\u0643 \u067e\u062a\u064a} \\]\n\n\"Attestation of Shahpur, Fire-priest of the Iranians.\"\n\nThe only word in this epigraph which presents any difficulty is the \u0648 \u0647\u0648, which I suppose to be a Pehlvi modification from the Hebrew root \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8, \"to return,\" \"to say again and again,\" hence \"to testify.\" But looking to the unusual size of this and of the second seal here noticed, which may be supposed to indicate the exalted position of their owners, it might be possible to interpret the original Pehlvi word by some indication of acceptance, recognition, or confirmation of a compact,\n\n---\n\n1 The font of Pehlvi here employed has lately been commissioned from Vienna, with a view to render Mr. Austin's Printing Establishment independent of the single case of Pehlvi type in this country, heretofore made use of in this essay, in regard to the loan of which some difficulty has been created. It will be seen how very inadequately the former fulfils the duty of representing the ancient character, which is far more legible and exact in its powers of definition than the modern production which sufficed for the obscure knowledge of the Parsees of Bombay. Immediate steps will be taken for engraving discriminating letters for 2, 3, and 4, and likewise for marking the difference between 1 and 8, which at present are both dependent upon the simple 4.\nor other graduated expression of sanction on the part of an Oriental superior, and thus to refer the \u0648\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f, \"promise-sum\" (from \u0648\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f), the Indian \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0939\u093e, \"promise, agreement.\" Though the curtailed \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062f\u064c = \u092f\u0942\u0903 \"a witness,\" on the Paris gem, No. 1339, seems directly to support the former interpretation.

Rawlinson (at p. 234, J.R.A.S. i. N.S.), in confirmation of the parallel antiquity of the Ethiopian writing noticed at pp. 247, 248, of this Essay. My reason may be given in but few words. I am not satisfied that the Himyaritic legend was engraved simultaneously with the rest of the device; indeed the more closely the design is examined the more it becomes evident that the device and the legend are the work of different artists, and unless it may be assumed that they were engraved contemporaneously, it would scarcely be safe to rely upon the device as determining even proximately the date of the writing.\n\n1 See also J.R.A.S. vii. pl. 6, and Sir H.

X.\u2014Account of an Embassy from Morocco to Spain in 1690 and 1691. By the Hon. H. E. J. Stanley.\n\n[Read July 1, 1867.]\n\nThe following notes are taken from an account of his journey to Spain, written by an Ambassador of Muley Ismail, a copy of which is preserved in a library at Lisbon: the MS. ends abruptly, and does not contain the author's name. From the narrative it appears that the Ambassador came to treat of the exchange of prisoners, and to ask for some of the Arabic works preserved at the Escurial: he appears, however, to have imagined that these were remnants of the libraries of Cordoba, whereas they proceeded from the library of a former Emperor of Morocco, which was captured at sea whilst being transported from one port to another. The Ambassador was told that the books had been destroyed by the fire which took place about twenty years before in the Escurial, where, in fact, the greater part of the Sultan's library was burned; but about two thousand were saved, of which nothing was said to the Ambassador, and these form the actual collection of Arabic works preserved in the Escurial. M. Chenier, in his Histoire du Maroc (Paris, 1787), states that Muley Ismail took L'Arrash from the Spaniards in 1689, and that the Spanish garrison of that place was exchanged at the rate of ten Moors for each Christian: he also states that, in 1681, Hajj Themim, Governor of Tetuan, and Cassem Menino, brother of the Governor of Sallee, went to Paris in the end of December as Ambas-\nsadors, so that it is possible one of these was also employed in this Embassy ten years later. It is evident from his narrative that he was a man of talent and observation, and he appears to have made a very favourable impression upon King Charles II.\n\nThe Ambassador came in a Spanish vessel from Kasbah Afrag (\u0642\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0623\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c) near Ceuta to Gibraltar, and thence to Cadiz, where he was met by a large number of the Moorish captives, who were much cheered by his arrival and announcement of the Sultan\u2019s intentions with regard to them. He also was informed in Cadiz, by a Christian priest in Constantinople, of the victory of Sultan Suleyman, who had reconquered Belgrade, and that its walls were destroyed, and that the Sultan had already set twelve thousand workmen to restore the walls.\n\n[The Turks laid siege to Belgrade on the 1st October, 1690, and exploded the magazine on the 8th, by which a thousand of the besieged were destroyed, and the besiegers entered the place. Mr. Stanhope writes from Madrid, December 6, 1690, \u201cThe Marocco Ambassador landed at Cadiz the 23rd past, was received on the water-side by the Governor, and saluted with thirty pieces of cannon. He lodged there only that night, and went next day to Port St. Mary\u2019s.\u201d Lord Mahon\u2019s Spain under Charles II.]\n\nFrom Cadiz the Ambassador went in a row-boat to Santa Maria, where he describes a large house, looking towards the sea, with the chief entrance door walled up, and this was the house in which lodged the Sultan and Sheikh, son of a Sultan, Ahmed Al-Dhahiby (\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0647\u0628\u064a), when he came to Spain; and no one lives in this house, for it is the custom of the Christians to honour the house in which a king has dwelt, and they wall up the door, as they did at Madrid with a house in which Charles the Fifth lodged his captive, the French king. [At the present time it is a custom and a right to suspend chains over the entrance of a house in which a Sovereign has lodged.] Between Xeres de la frontera and Utrera the Ambassador passed a night at a town called Alberijah (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u062c): in this place some of the inhabitants gave him to understand\nby secret signs that they were descended from the Arabs of Spain, for they could not communicate except by secret discourse. In Utrera he says he saw the daughter of the Governor and the daughter of the Judge, who were extremely beautiful; and these two were of the blood of the last king of Granada, known amongst the Spaniards as el rey Chico. Here he relates that at Madrid he knew a Don Albeniz, a descendant of Musa, brother of the conquered king of Granada, and a relation of the two damsels of Utrera, who was one of the first knights in Spain, and much esteemed by the Christians, yet he had much inclination towards any of the Muslims whom he might meet, and related to them his genealogy, and admired what he heard from them of El Islam and its people; and he told the Ambassador that when his mother was bearing him she had a desire to eat kuskusu, and that her father said to her, \u201cPerhaps the burden you are bearing is of the race of the Muslims.\u201d In saying this he was joking, for they did not fear to make known their genealogy, and that they were of the king\u2019s house. From Utrera he passed through Marchena to Ecija, the beauty and elegance of which he praises very much, and quotes the following verses in praise of Wady Ash and Ecija from \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0629, the poetess Hamdah, the Andalusian:\n\n\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631\u064a \u064a\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a\n\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0628 \u064a\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a\n\u0641\u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0647\u0631 \u064a\u0637\u0648\u0641 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0631\u0648\u0636\u064a\n\u0648\u0633\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0636 \u064a\u0637\u0648\u0641 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a\n\u0633\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0628\u0649 \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0633\u0644\u0645\u062a \u0641\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a\n\u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0647\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0631\u0645\u0644\n\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u062d\u0638 \u062a\u0631\u0642\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631\n\u0648\u0630\u0627\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u064a\u0645\u0646\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0631\u0642\u0627\u062f\u064a\n\u0631\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0631\u0641\u064a \u062c\u0646\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0631\n\n1 Al-Makkari says she is also named Hamdunah, the daughter of Zeyad:\n\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0629 \u0648 \u064a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u062a \u0632\u064a\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0630\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0622\u0633\n\u064a\u0631\u0641 2 Al-Makkari, Leyden edition, ii. 93.

He says that the horses in the neighbourhood of Cordoba were the best in Spain, and that on that account the King had prohibited breeding mules from asses and mares under pain of imprisonment and confiscation, and that mules were bred in La Mancha. He mentions a village called Alkaraby (\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a) at fifteen miles distance from Cordoba, near the Guadalquivir, and twenty-one miles from Andujar: this place seems to have disappeared. At Andujar he found the greater part of the inhabitants to be descendants of the Abenserrages, who had gone over to the Christians after some of that family had been put to death at Granada. He says that the highest dignity to which those of this race can attain is the right of wearing a cross upon the shoulder embroidered on their coats,\n\n1 added, not in the text. 2 Al-Makkari. 3 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0644. 4 The text of these lines appears not to be entirely correct.\nand that they fill the offices of clerks, ushers, the government of small towns, and other offices of small importance. And in these districts there are a great many of them: some of them relate their lineage, others shun the mention of it, and fear it, and attribute their origin to the mountains of Navarra and boast of it; and those of this race who hold an office, or are employed in collecting the revenue, do not fear relating their lineage. The Ambassador met a man in Madrid, whose name he had forgotten, in a coach with some ladies, old and young, who stopped and made many salutations, and he and the ladies were much pleased, and greatly welcomed the Ambassador, and on taking leave of him gave his name, and said we are of the race of the Muslims of the lineage of the sons of Al-Serraj; and the Ambassador inquired about him afterwards, and learned that he was one of the Secretaries of the Council, and the one who read out the petitions and memorials presented to the Council. There were also a number of Granadines who held employments in Granada and lived in Madrid, and came with Don Alveniz to see the Ambassador, and they attribute their origin to the Granadine Arabs. (And misery prevailed over them, and our refuge is with God.) And these people used to question about the faith and customs of El-Islam, and when they heard the Ambassador's answers as to its faith and ordinances, they admired what they heard, and approved and gave thanks for it in the presence of the Christians, and were not ashamed on account of those that were present; and they did not cease to come and see the Ambassador several times during his stay in Madrid, and to show him great marks of friendship and affection. \"We pray the Most High to direct them into the right path and guide them to the true faith.\"\n\n[This account is curious in conjunction with what the Ambassador relates further on of the power and activity of the Inquisition.]\n\nAt Linares the Ambassador speaks of the lead mines and of a convent of women which he visited by invitation: he gives a long account of the life of the nuns, and of the various motives for which they enter. His account is very fair, and\nhe refers to two other convents which he visited at Seville and Carmona. From Linares he passed through Torre Juan Abad, whose inhabitants and their singing he states were different from the other Spaniards, and compares them with the Berbers of the mountains of Alfahsiyah (\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0635\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629), and stopped at Segalana (\u0634\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0629) at the foot of a mountain and off the road. Here he describes inns and the dangers of the road from brigands. One of these he met when returning from Madrid who lived at Cozera . . . . miles from Torre Juan Abad: the king had sent three hundred archers against him, and they took him, but he escaped, and now he lives in Cozera without fear of anybody, only he wishes for a safe conduct from the King; and he said to the Ambassador that if he were ready for the journey he would go with him to Muley Ismail to beg of him a letter to the King of Spain to ask for a safe conduct to give him tranquillity. The Ambassador then describes the administration of the post couriers, and mentions the arrival of letters from Madrid at San Lucar in three days. He next stopped at the Venta San Andres, and mentions the fair held at four miles distance from that place [the fair of Almagro]; from San Andres, through Membrilla to Manzanares, and from there to Mora [six leagues from Toledo]; between these two towns he passed an enormous quantity of vines, but no other trees. From Mora he crossed the Tagus on a raft, leaving Toledo on one side, to Pintos (\u067e\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0633) a small village; from there to Getafe (\u062c\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0627\u0641\u064e\u0629), six miles from Madrid, a large town, which formerly was larger until the Government came to Madrid, when it became deserted. [This village is now the first station on the railway south of Madrid.] At this place he was met by a grandee in one of the King's coaches, named Count Carlos de Castilla, whose office it is to receive all who come from other kingdoms, for which he receives three thousand reals a year; and he took the Ambassador with him in the coach after welcoming him in the King's name. At a mile from Madrid many people came out in coaches and riding and walking to meet the Ambassador. They crossed the Manzanares, which the Ambassador says has a great deal of water after the snow falls in the moun-\ntains: he mentions two bridges, one of these had lately been destroyed by a flood, and was then rebuilding, and the coaches passed over a wooden scaffolding. Within the town he was again met by Moorish prisoners of war, who rejoiced greatly at his arrival. He was conveyed to a house near the palace, disposed for the reception of those who come from distant countries and not of Christian nations, and they rest there three days, and look out for a residence if they intend remaining in the capital.\\(^1\\) So it happened to the Turk who came to Spain forty years before; they believe that he was from Constantinople, but the truth is that he came on behalf of some seditious people who desired to disturb the kingdom of Constantinople. Also three years before this there arrived an envoy from Muskovia, which is a distant country in the parts about the North Pole, and he came to the Sovereign of Spain and begged in marriage from his mother (Do\u00f1a Mariana of Austria), a daughter of a sister of hers who was in Germany, and the King of Muscovy desired to be married to her. And since her family did not desire that she should marry him, they entrusted her business to her aunt (the Queen mother of Spain), and got rid of the Ambassador to Spain. And this was the object of the arrival of the Muscovite embassy to this king, according to what they say here.\n\n[According to the history of Russia of Ernst Hermann, tom. iv., p. 14, Hamburg, 1849, this Ambassador was the Kniaz Feodorovitch Dolgorouky, who was envoy to France and Spain during the regency of the Arch-Duchess Sophia in the years 1682-1689. According to a Russian authority he was Prince James Fedorovitch, who went on an extraordinary embassy to Paris and Madrid in 1686: he was removed from the Russian Court by the Regent Sophia, who feared in him too zealous an adherent of the young Tzar: and the real object of the Embassy was to seek the assistance of France and Spain against Turkey, but it was unsuccessful.]\n\nThe Marocco Ambassador arrived at Madrid in the after-\n\n\\(^1\\) \"The French Ambassador has demanded to have his Hospedage, that is, to be treated nine days in a house designed for that purpose at the King's charge. This is a custom that has been many years antiquated here except with Turks, Moors, and Muscovites.\" Mr. Stanhope, Madrid, September 3, 1698.\nnoon of Saturday, the 7th of Reby al Evvel, 1102 (equal to December 9, 1690): twelve days later he was received in audience by the King. During that time the Count who had charge of him came to inquire what manner of salutation the Ambassador would use, since the king had not yet received any one of the religion of the Ambassador. And the Ambassador gave him an account of the salutations used amongst Muslims and of those used by them to others not of their religion, and that is to say, \"Peace be upon him who follows the Direction,\" without adding anything to this. And the Count informed the King of it, and his Majesty declared his admiration of this salutation which was related to him, since he was not prepared for it, and he could not do otherwise than accept it. And the Count returned with a written programme of the reception. The next day the Ambassador went to the Palace, where he was received by the Mayordomo, and then by the Secretary of the Great Council and many Dukes and Counts: he then entered the presence chamber, and found the King standing, with a gold chain round his neck, and at his right hand a table embossed with gold, prepared in order to place upon it the Sultan's letter. [At the beginning of this century the King of Portugal still had a table at his side covered with a gold embroidered cloth at audiences to receive ambassadors.] And on the right of the table was a minister called the Condestable, and on his right the wife of the King, and her ladies and the daughters of the nobles, and on the left hand of the King the other ministers. When the Ambassador entered the King welcomed him and smiled, and expressed his satisfaction, and inquired about the Ambassador's Sovereign, el Mansur b'Illahi, several times, and when he mentioned him he took off the hat (sombrero) which he had on his head, to respect and honour him. And the Ambassador replied that he was well, praise be to God,\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Stanhope wrote to the Earl of Nottingham, January 10, 1691: \"Our Marocco Ambassador is at last fallen to an envoy. I saw him go to audience, where was an extraordinary concourse of people to see him, for the rarity of the thing and the oddness of the dress, as little known here as with us. His business is only to treat about the redemption of the prisoners taken at Larache. It is adjusted he is to have ten Moors a-piece for a hundred officers, and the common men to be exchanged man for man.\"\nand presented his letter to the King, who took it, raised it to his forehead, and kissed it, and placed it on the table prepared for it; after that he also raised what he had on his head. Then he asked the Ambassador after his own health and about his journey, and the Ambassador expressed his thanks for his treatment of him, and for the treatment which he had met with from the King's officers. And the King was pleased and approved, and after the Ambassador had spoken, said, \"Thanks be to God for your health, and on another occasion we will return an answer to that which you have brought.\" And the Ambassador withdrew, and those who were with the King came out also and took leave of the Ambassador.\n\nThe Ambassador then mentions that Carlos II. was not of the ancient family of kings who warred with the Muslims, but of Flemish origin: he then relates the discovery of America and its conquest, and the riches acquired by Spain from those possessions, and says, \"So much so that pomp and luxury have prevailed over them, and none of their race can be found who carries on commerce, or travels to other countries for that purpose, as is the custom of other Christian nations like the Flemings, and the English and French and Genoese and others. And in the same way this nation rejects all the despised employments which poor people follow, and esteems itself more excellent than any of the other nations of the Messiah. And the greater number of those who follow those employments which are despised in Spain are Frenchmen, because their country is poor, and they have become very numerous in Spain for the sake of service and acquiring and heaping up property, which they are able to do in a short time.\" The Ambassador then says that very many Spaniards desire to acquire dignities, and that these are not granted to persons in trade, though they may obtain them for their heirs. And dignity or greatness consists in a cross embroidered on the breast, and can only be obtained by those who are of ancient Christianity, and can count seven ancestors who have always professed Christianity, without suspicion of Judaism or of anything other than the faith of the Messiah. After establishing that, he may receive the order to wear a cross,\nand then he gives money to the people of the Council, and to the friars, who also give their license. The Ambassador then gives a short account of the royal family of Spain, beginning with Philip el Hermoso of Flanders: he speaks of Charles the Fifth\u2019s expedition to Algiers, and of Don Sebastian of Portugal\u2019s disaster at Alcazar Kebir in Morocco, where very few of his army escaped. The Ambassador says, \u201cThe number of the Christians, according to what is known amongst us, was eighty thousand; and the Christians say that Don Sebastian\u2019s army was eighteen thousand; that there were twelve thousand Portuguese and three thousand English; they brought succour on account of the peace and treaty of friendship which existed between them; and there were three thousand Spaniards whom Philip II. lent to the son of his sister; and the truth as to the number is that which is established amongst the Muslims.\u201d\n\n[A detailed account of this battle, 1578, was lately published in Portugal, and a French translation appeared in the Biblioth\u00e8que Universelle Suisse, tom. 17, Geneva, 1863, which mentions an Italian and a German regiment, but no English.]\n\nThe Ambassador says of the expulsion of the Moriscoes, that it was not possible to discover them all, on account of their being confounded with the rest of the inhabitants, and their having forgotten El Islam. He also says that, \u201cOn account of the advice which the Minister (the Duke of Lerma) gave to the King to expel those who were expelled, who were Christians and had entered the Christian faith in such numbers, the Spaniards accuse him (the Duke of Lerma) of Judaism, because his counsel was not in accordance with their religion in the matter of expelling this multitude after they were reckoned as Christians.\n\n[Whether this opinion mentioned by the Ambassador were general or not in his time, it is certain that all those who wrote in favour of the expulsion quoted from the Jewish wars as freely as did the Puritans, and in that sense the charge of Judaism might be sustained against the Duke of Lerma and Fray Bleda.]\n\nThe Ambassador continues: \u201cAs some of the Christians\nare accused of Judaism there is a tribunal in Madrid called the Council of the Inquisition:\" he then describes it, and says that whilst he was at Madrid the Inquisition seized one of the favourites and ministers of the King and put him in prison at Toledo, and another man also employed in the collection of the King's rents, and the King could do nothing for them.\n\nThe Ambassador gives a long account of the insurrection of Portugal and struggle against Spain in Philip the Fourth's reign, and of the troubles caused by Don John of Austria and Don Fernando Valenzuela, the \"Duende,\" or Ghost of the Palace, in the beginning of the reign of Charles II. He describes the old Moorish Castle of Consuegra, which was then used as a state prison: [this castle is now in ruins, it is said to have been the last place held by the French in the war of Independence.]\n\nThe Ambassador then returns to the subject of his embassy, and says that the Sultan's letter was given to an Aleppo Christian to translate. And when it was translated, and the King read what it contained, and the request of the Sultan for five thousand volumes and five hundred captives, the royal consent became difficult and the King did not know how to meet this request, and he understood that this was the firm intention of the Sultan, and that he could not hesitate in the matter. So the King held a consultation with his councillors, and they were of opinion to listen favourably to the request of the Muley and Imam; and they debated about it several days, and said that the Muslim books had been burned in a town in Spain, and that as the Sultan had in his letter left the option in case of the books not existing or being damaged of giving up a full thousand of the Muslim captives, they wished to omit a part of the thousand. And they did not find it possible to do this, and they could only end the business by conceding it; and when the Sultan on his side accepted this, they set to work to seek for and collect the captives, during which time the King was very friendly to the Ambassador.\n\nThe Ambassador saw all the great houses at Madrid and\nthe King's palaces and gardens: he describes skating on the water in the Retiro, and says this art was introduced by the Flemings. He says that mares in foal were brought to see the horse of the bronze equestrian statue of Philip IV. in the Retiro, and that a sound was made to come from the statue like neighing; and the breed of the foal was supposed to be improved thereby, and that it was likely to become like the horse of that statue. He was invited to shoot in the Pardo, a permission which excited great surprise, since it had been asked for by the Ambassadors of France and Germany and had been refused to them. He then describes a great ceremony in the Plaza Mayor; this was for the canonisation of San Juan de Dios: here the Ambassador was placed in a seat in a gallery opposite to the King's gallery, and treated with great kindness and consideration by the King. San Juan de Dios was the founder of many hospitals in Spain; and the Ambassador gives the following description of many of fourteen hospitals of Madrid which he visited: \"In each of these hospitals there are magazines full each one of what belongs to it, oil, vinegar, remedies and potions, etc., and a kitchen; and I have found in these flesh of sheep, of chickens, of rabbits, partridges, and of swine, and the rest of what is wanted for the sick. And when the doctor enters to visit the sick he feels his hand and informs himself of his state, and writes upon a tablet, and gives this tablet to the person charged with the sick, and he gives it to the official of the kitchen, and they prepare for the sick man what the doctor has ordered. And I have seen in the hospital another building, in which were the clothes of the sick. This is when the sick man enters the hospital, they take away all the clothes he wears and deposit them in the building disposed for this purpose, and they write on them upon a tablet, to recognise the clothes and their owner; and clothe him with other garments prepared for the sick, and the property of the hospital endowment. They give him a bed, with a mattress, pillow, and sheet, and every week they wash the clothes he wears and give him others. And if he rises up from his sickness they dress him in the clothes he brought with him,\nand he goes his way; and if he dies they shroud him at the expense of the hospital, and take information of his family, and return to them the clothes which he left. And for each of these hospitals there is a doctor, who has a house appointed for him close to the hospital, and its rent is paid from the hospital endowment, and all the provisions of the doctor and of his assistants and their necessaries proceed from the endowment, so that they may be always present and not absent, and not occupied with the cares of their maintenance. And this order of monks dedicated to San Juan serve the sick more than any other men do, and they do so with faith and belief. In truth, one of our friends fell sick when we were staying in the city of San Lucar, and this religious order used to visit us every day, and when they saw the sick man they begged our leave to carry him to their place to cure him and occupy themselves with his affair. And we did not permit it; and they came again, and said, we love to do good, and do not believe you will prevent us from doing it; and they made great entreaty, but it was not granted to them in this case. And they did not cease to visit him until he was convalescent. And men love them for their good faith, and for the goodness of their disposition, and their poverty and humility: indeed, if they were in the straight path, they would be the best of the race by their disposition; and the greater number of them are poor. And God directs whom he pleases into the true path.\"\n\nThe Ambassador then describes the Post-office and the lists for letters poste restante, and says the payment for letters was their own weight in silver from beyond Spain; and that a courrier came from Rome in February with a weight of 53 arrobas of letters, upon which 13 cwt. and a quarter of silver was levied. The Ambassador then speaks of another invention better than the Post-office for spreading news. \"There is a building containing moulds of letters under one man who for this gives a sum of money to the King, which is fixed at the beginning of each year; and all the news that can be collected is put into the mould, and with that they print a thousand of papers and sell them at a very low price. And\na man carries a great number of these papers, and cries them, and says, Who buys the news of such a country, and the news of such a country? Then whoever wishes to inform himself about this buys one of these papers, and they call it Gazeta; and by means of them a man acquires much news. Nevertheless there is in them much exaggeration and falsehood, which is introduced by evil passions.\" [Regularly published newspapers began in England in 1695; Macaulay, vol. iv. 602.]\n\nThe Ambassador then mentions the death of the late Pope, and the long time that elapsed before a new one was named, and says a courier arrived from Rome with news of the election of the new one when he was at San Lucar on his return from Madrid, which fixes that date at the end of July, 1691, as this Pope (Innocent XII.) was elected July 12, 1691: he then describes minutely the mode of election.\n\nSpeaking of the rights of the Dukes of Medina Celi [several of which still exist], he says these Dukes in saluting the King always said, \"We after your Majesty,\" meaning that they held the succession after the King if he left no posterity; and that nine years before, when he was minister, Charles II. having no children, this form of greeting vexed the King's heart, and he begged of him to abandon and give it up, and not express the hope, \"You, and there is no posterity after you,\" upon which the Duke left it off. The Ambassador mentions as present at Madrid the Nuncio, and Ambassadors from Germany and England, also from Portugal and Valencia: he speaks of the two latter as established and domiciled with their children and business. [The agents or deputies from Catalonia were till a late time called ambassadors.] The French Ambassador had gone away on account of the general war. Here he states that some time before \"there was an English Ambassador who fell in love with a lady, and what he felt for her increased so much that he became a Christian and followed the religion of the people of the Cross, for the English nation do not adore the Cross; and when the English had news of his having become a Christian, they changed him, and sent another in his stead; and he remained in Madrid, married. And the King gave\nhim an office with which he might live, and which might amount to twelve thousand reals each year; but he lost all that he possessed in his own country, so that there was no covetousness in him in this business.\u201d [This ambassador was Sir Wm. Godolphin; see Lord Mahon\u2019s Court of Charles II., pp. 90, 96.]\n\nThe Ambassador then gives a very fair account of the causes of the war in Europe, of the French differences with the Duke of Savoy, with the Pope [Innocent XI. with respect to the Ambassadorial Asylums in Rome for thieves and assassins], of the demands of the German Emperor to France to break the truce with the Turks, and of the Augsburg League. This is how he describes the situation of England: \u201cWhen the King of the English died during the period of enmity between the Christians, he left no son to succeed him on the throne, and a brother of his succeeded him named James. This James and his wife believed secretly in the Christian religion without anyone of their nation knowing it; and when his brother died, and the disposition of the government belonged to him, and he had no doubt as to the succession, and of entering upon the dignity of his brother, and they asked him to reign over them, he refused, and declined feignedly and with cunning; and whilst they were discussing it, he said, I do not consent to what you ask of me unless you do according to my desire, which is not to your injury, and that is, that each one who loves his religion may be able to follow it;\u00b9 and they agreed to this, and consented, and set on him the crown and made him king. And he did not alarm them until he and his wife arose one morning with crosses hung round their necks, and they allowed the friars to be seen publicly who were with them, and they entered the churches and performed the prayers of the Christians. All those who were in the secret followed them, and those also who desired to conduct the people of their nation to follow their religion which the King had suddenly manifested. And when the English nation saw what had happened to them of the difference of the King\u2019s religion and\n\n\u00b9 Declaration of Indulgence, April 4, 1687.\ntheir, and because he followed the religion of the people of\nthe Cross, they feared that this would be an injury to their\ncommunity, and that they would not be able to find a remedy\nfor this business: and they protested against the King and\nhis acts respecting religion; and they assembled their council\nand made haste to kill him. When the King knew their\nintentions, he fled to the French King, he and his wife, and\ntook refuge with him. And the French made haste to pro-\ntect and defend him, from their enmity to the English, and\nto spite them.\u00b9 And they disputed about it, and there were\nwords between them, and the rupture between them happened\nwhen the French King said, You are all as much my enemies\nas the other Christians, and expect war from me until I shall\nhave restored the fugitive to his house and kingdom in spite\nof you. And when there happened to the English, what\nhappened in the matter of the departure of their king, and of\nthe war which was lighted up between them and the French,\nthey took for their king the Prince of Orange, the adminis-\ntrator of the Flemish nation, for these two were following\nthe same religion in the difference which exists between them\nand the people of the Cross,\u201d etc. etc.\n\nThe Ambassador speaks of the taking of Mons by Louis\nXIV., and says there were twelve thousand Spanish troops\nthere. [Henry Martin says, \u201cThe Governor of Mons gave\nup the place on the 8th April, and came out of it on the 10th\nwith four thousand eight hundred men. There ought to\nhave been twelve thousand men, and the Governor had assured\nWilliam III. that he had that number. King William was\nirritated when he knew he had been deceived, and wrote to\ncomplain of it to Charles II.\u201d From the Marocco Ambassador\u2019s\nstatement it would appear that the Court of Madrid in general\nhad been equally misled by the Governor of Mons.] The\nAmbassador goes on to relate the state of the war between\nFrance and Spain, and mentions two occurrences which I\nhave not been able to find mentioned elsewhere. He says\n\n\u00b9 The Parisians could talk of nothing but what was passing in London. Na-\ntional and religious feeling impelled them to take the part of James,\u201d etc. etc.\nMacaulay, vol. ii. p. 594.\nthat when the French bombarded Barcelona, the people of Barcelona rose up against all the Frenchmen living in their country, and expelled all the single men, and allowed to remain only those who were married: and \"when the French ships left Barcelona, they came before Alicante and levelled with bombs more than six hundred houses; and the people of Alicante also laid hold of the Frenchmen who were amongst them, and killed them, for not one escaped. And they say that the number of those who were killed in Alicante was three thousand souls.\" [Henry Martin says, \"The French threw eight hundred shells into Barcelona and two thousand into Alicante (in July, 1691), these cities having refused to pay ransom: they thought to make Barcelona rise by bombarding it; they only succeeded in blotting out what might exist of the ancient sympathy of Barcelona for France.\" tom xiv. p. 147.]\n\nThe Ambassador then relates the state of affairs in Italy, and the movements of the Turkish and Tatar armies, and the conduct of Tekely in Hungary; he describes the alliance of Louis XIV. with the Turk, but attributes it solely to the interests of French commerce in the Levant; and he says [referring to the policy of Colbert], that in this reign men of commerce were for the first time taken into the councils of the French monarchy. When speaking of the probability of the succession to the throne of Spain going to the French royal family by inheritance through a female, he says that on account of that expectation the Spaniards were learning French and teaching it to their sons. He then again alludes to the slaughter of Frenchmen this year as likely to increase the enmity between the two nations.\n\nFrom Louis the Fourteenth's disputes with the Pope the Ambassador goes back to explain the origin of Protestantism, and describes the fasts and Easter ceremonies: he gives a detailed account of the washing of the feet of thirteen poor people by the King and by the Queen and Queen-Mother, and of the dinner served to them before that by the King in the presence of the Nuncio and Archbishop: he presented to each poor man thirty dishes. The Ambassador says the poor\nmen carry away all the dinner in their vessels, and sell it in the streets to crowds of people, as they believe there is a blessing on this food.\\(^1\\) He then quotes the Gospel of St. John in explanation of this ceremony. In describing the processions he says, \u201cThere are Christians who represent the crucified personally, and veil their face not to be recognised, but a servant of his or a friend follows him to take care that he does not faint by the way from the number of stripes he receives on his shoulders, and the blood runs down his legs.\u201d He says that on Easter day a number of pieces of paper are scattered in the air, on which are printed pictures of Saints and the word Hallelujah in Hebrew letters: [this is the origin of the name Haleluia given in Spanish to a sort of doll on a stick, and to pictures with verses and mottoes.]\n\nAfter the description of the Easter ceremonies he gives an account of Rome, of his discussions with friars, and then an invective against some of their abuses. Apropos of these, he relates that \u201ca handsome woman at Seville came to see him with her mother and two sisters, and many Christians were present, and they began to talk of the friars and clergy. And the young woman said, He who trusts to the friars is accursed. And he asked her why she said this, and she answered, I know them all, and have no need to give more explanations. The Ambassador was much surprised at her speaking in that way whilst some of the clergy were present, and considering the great rank they hold amongst the Christians.\u201d However the Ambassador says, notwithstanding this, he had seen a great number of very good monks, especially an old man, the head of the church in the Escurial. [From the register of the Escurial this man would be Fray Pedro Reynoso, a Catedratico, or Professor, who succeeded Fray Luis de San Pablo on the 5th December, 1690.] This leads to a description of the Escurial: speaking of the college there, and of the study of Latin, he says Latin is equivalent to the study of syntax amongst the Arabs. When the Ambassador was at the Escurial the damage done by the fire in 1671 had not yet been entirely repaired.\n\n\\(^1\\) This is still the practice at the present day.\nAfter this the Ambassador went to Aranjuez, where he took leave of the King, and was received by him and the Queen and a great number of ladies. The King gave him a letter for the Sultan, and charged him with presenting his salutations to the Sultan, and with requesting from him his favour for the captives in Marocco, and expressed his readiness and desire to comply with any representations which the Sultan might make. The Ambassador, though in a hurry to return to his country, was persuaded to remain a day at Aranjuez, to go out shooting with one of the King's confidants: he then returned to Madrid, and left it for Marocco on the 1st of Ramazan (or the 29th of May, 1691), and journeyed to Toledo; of this he gives a long description, and follows it with several passages from the history of the Arab conquest. [Some of these are taken from Ibn Adhary, others are contained in Al Makkari, and some seem to come from works which are not at present known. The Ambassador's narrative breaks off abruptly, after concluding with a defence of the character of Musa bin Nosayr. Some of these extracts of Arab history have been published in M. Dozy's Recherches, and others in a memoir of Mr. Gayangos on the Chronicle of the Moor Rasis.] [The following passage is not, I think, so well known.]\n\n\"Abdul Malik Ibn Habib said, and he attributes it to some of the Tabis who entered Spain, the Khalifs of Beny Umeyah had disposed that when the produce of the taxes arrived, there should present themselves with it ten of the principal and best of the inhabitants of each place; and neither dinar nor dirhem entered into the treasury of these taxes until the deputation had sworn by God, there is no other deity but He, that there was not amongst that money any dinar or any dirhem which had been taken otherwise than lawfully, and that this money was only the produce of what had been given by the people of the country for their families and children. There arrived a deputation from Afrikiyah with its taxes in the last days of the Khalif Suleyman; and when they were ordered to take the oath, eight of them swore, and two men abstained, these were Ismail bin Abid Allah, a client of the\nBeny Mahzum, and As-Samh bin Malik Khaulany. And Omer bin Abdul Aziz was surprised at what they had done, and when he succeeded to the Califate, he drew them near to him, and experienced in them good faith and good conduct. And he set Ismail bin Abid Allah as governor over Afrikiyah, and As-Samh bin Malik as governor over Spain.\"\n\nTwo Turkish words, boghaz, straits, and sanjak, a flag, are used in this MS., also \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u064a, which is not to be found in the dictionary, and is Maghriby for hillal, the crescent, or pinnacle of a mosque. There is also the word \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u064a, which I have been unable to find the origin of, it must mean a sun-dial or clock.\nART. XI.\u2014The Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, of Arragon.\n\nBy the Hon. H. E. J. Stanley.\n\nThe history of the Day of Judgment, and the canto of the death of the Prophet Muhammad, by Rabadan, were published in the preceding number of the Journal of the Asiatic Society. These two poems were received with much enthusiasm at Barcelona. With the exception of the history of Hexim and Abdulmutalib, none of Rabadan's poetry has been before published. It may be as well to remind the reader that Rabadan wrote in 1603. The following notes are given here, as it would have been inconvenient to give them as foot notes.\n\nComo quieres encerrarme\nEn este vaso asqueroso?\n\nCompare with this expostulation of the soul of Adam the following passage from the Zohar:\n\n\"At the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, willed to create the universe, the universe was already present in His thoughts; then He formed also the souls which later were to belong to men, they were all before Him, exactly in the form which they were to have later in the human body. The Eternal looked at them one after the other, and saw several which would corrupt their ways in the world. When its time is come, each of these souls is summoned before the Eternal, who says to it: Go to such a part of the earth and animate such a body. The soul replies: O Lord of the universe I am happy in the world in which I am, and do not desire to leave it for another where I shall be subjected and exposed to all pollutions. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, answers: From the day on which thou wast created thou hadst no other destination than to go into the world whither I am sending thee. Seeing that it must obey, the soul with grief takes the road to earth and comes down amidst us.\"\u2014La Kabbale, p. 241, by Ad. Franck. Paris, Hachette, 1843, Rue Pierre Sarrasin, 17. B.M. 1363, d.\n\nQuen amor vienen \u00e1 ser\nUna carne y una sangre.\n\n\"Our Prophet has declared to us the reason why the first man\nwas composed of so many kinds of earth from such distant spots, since on this account knowledge of mankind is communicated to men, and by it men of all parts know one another,\u2014those of the West recognise those of the East, and on only seeing one another they contract friendships, and through love are of the same flesh and blood.\"\n\nThis refers to the law laid down by Muhammad that all men are equal, and that there is no difference between the white and black or the red and yellow among the children of Adam. This declaration was proclaimed in the midst of a nation second to none in pride of birth and pride of race; and this doctrine is that of interdependence, which modern philosophers are attempting to establish. Mr. Congreve writes:\n\n\"Under whatever divisions man exists,\u2014races, national aggregates, tribes, empires, states, families, all are but integral parts, practically, of one whole; branches of one great family, each with its proper functions; each able to minister to the welfare of the others and of the whole\" (International Policy, p. 5).\n\nM. Renan also, whilst discrediting the Mosaic Revelation, insists on the necessity of clinging to the belief in one first man and a common origin of mankind, as necessary to all civilization and progress.\n\nMr. Deutsch has been so kind as to give me the following extracts from the Talmud with respect to the unity of the human race:\n\n\"Man was created alone, to show you that he who destroys one human life destroys as it were the whole world... and further, that one man might not say to another: my father was greater than yours... and further, that every single human being might be equally entitled to say, the world has been created for my sake... and in order to destroy family pride. See now, since there is only one progenitor of our race, how they squabble about their lineage, what would they do if there were two? Let them also remember that man was created last, that even the gnat may boast of a more ancient lineage... [Adam was created from the dust gathered together from the whole earth.]\"\u2014(Talmud, Sanhedrin, 37.a; 38.a.)\n\nIt is, perhaps, from this Rabbinical lesson that a Spanish\nstory is derived of a black Marquis who was derisively asked about his genealogy, and who replied that he descended from the second Adam: on being reproached with his supposed ignorance, as there was no such person, he answered: then why inquire into my genealogy since we are both descended from a common ancestor.\n\nEra el pavo, y esto viendo.\n\n\"The Porter of Paradise excused himself, who, as the Ulema say, was the peacock.\" See D'Herbelot\u2014art. Adam, and Note at p. 175 of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar, Hakluyt Society, respecting the association of the peacock with Satan. This tradition is still current in Spain. Pavo is from the Paris MS., the London MS. has pago, an error, which Mr. Morgan has not attempted to translate.\n\nDebaxo sus paladares.\n\nOne of the most remarkable of the frequent coincidences in sense and expression between Milton and Rabadan, is where they both represent Satan as entering the mouth of the serpent:\n\n\"in at his mouth\nThe Devil enter'd, and his brute sense,\nIn heart or head, possessing, soon inspir'd\nWith act intelligential;\u2014\u2014\"\n\nThis coincidence is probably owing to a tradition followed by both poets, since it would have been more natural to represent Satan as taking the form of the serpent, and Milton twice refers to the transformation of Satan and his angels.\u2014V. Book i., 423, and iii., 634.\n\nNo relumbrante como antes.\n\nAccording to Rabbinical tradition, Adam's stature was diminished after his fall.\n\nCon una vedriera clara.\n\nMr. Morgan translates this line thus: \"This was covered with most clear and transparent glass,\" and he puts a sarcastic note as to their having glass in those ages; but the fact is vidriera is a very good equivalent for the word used in Genesis\nvi. 16, which we translate window: \\( \\text{tsohar} \\) signifies clear and bright, Symmachus translates it \\( \\delta\\alpha\\phi\\alpha\\varsigma \\), a transparency, and a Rabbinical commentary says it was made from a transparent stone brought by Noah from the river Pison. This tradition also is still current in Spain.\n\nYa no habia mencion dellas.\n\nHere and elsewhere Rabadan uses the same words as in his description of the destruction of the world before the Judgment, and it is clear that he is drawing a parallel between the universal deluge and the end of the world.\n\nEste (Tareh) fue padre de Ezar.\n\nWith regard to this, Mr. Morgan gives the following note:\n\n\"It is generally concluded that Moses' Tareh was the Azar of the Arabs, because, according to the Hebrew text of Genesis, that Patriarch was the son of Tareh; for in all Mahometan histories, Abraham is called the son of Azar: yet it appears that the Arabs do not mean the same person by those two names, since Tareh is by them made Abraham's grandfather. Had our chronologists, who have taken so much pains to reconcile the epochs of Abraham's transmigration, with the years of his age and the death of Tareh, been acquainted with this genealogy of the Arabians, perhaps they would not have needed to fly to a second transmigration of the Patriarch, not mentioned in Scripture; and they might easily solve all their difficulties by admitting of two Tarehs, one of whom, called also Azar, was father, and the other grandfather, to Abraham; which is not repugnant to Scripture.\"\n\nThe next number of the Journal will contain the history of Abraham, and of the prophets in the line of Isaac.\nBIZM\u00cd YLLAH\u00cd ARRAHMEN\u00cd YRRAHIM.\u00b9\n\nCANTO PRIMERO EN QUE SE DEDICA ESTE LIBRO A SOLO ALLAH CRIADOR DE TODA COSA.\n\nA ti, monarca

XII.\u2014Materials for the History of India for the Six Hundred Years of Mohammadan Rule previous to the foundation of the British Indian Empire. By Major W. Nassau Lees, LL.D., Ph.D.\n\n[Read January 20, 1868.]\n\nEvery inquiry which can elucidate the history, the laws, the institutions, or the characteristics of the people of India, ought to have a very practical interest for the people of England, and especially for that small section of them which is entrusted with her government, either more directly as connected with the India Office, or less so as members of the British Parliament. Nor can it be said that information acquired by personal inquiry from people living on the spot is the most satisfactory for the purpose, or can be considered sufficient. Such is not the case. Englishmen in India, as a rule, never mix in social intercourse with the natives. They may receive friendly visits from a few; but, in ordinary, the relations between Englishmen and the higher classes of the natives of India are either purely official or purely of a business nature, and with the lower orders those of master and servant. Again, the few natives of India who have received an English education have been effectually isolated from the great body of their fellow-countrymen, with whom they have as little real sympathy as with their English rulers. In the former case, sometimes from fear, but more often from a desire to coincide with and to please or flatter his superiors, as the Hindu historians did in the reigns of Akbar and his successors,\u2014and in the latter, sometimes from ignorance, but sometimes also from interested motives,\u2014the opinions of natives with which Europeans are likely to be favoured are not always a safe guide. On the contrary, in some respects, the greater the progress that is made in educating the upper classes of the natives of India, on the English model up to our own\nstandard, the greater will be the necessity most cautiously to guard against the tendency that will arise, and naturally so, to depend for our knowledge of the feelings, prejudices, and wishes of our native subjects on native public opinion, as expressed through the medium of that section of the native community which we have separated from the mass of their fellow-countrymen.\n\nAnd the reason why I have so far transgressed the rules which ordinarily should guide contributors to a learned Society or Journal, as to discuss these matters from a material point of view, is this,\u2014I desire to show how deeply interested the Government, the Legislature, and the people of Great Britain are in the researches of any Society whose object is to investigate the social and political history and the antiquities of India, and I am quite certain that my best chance of success is to combine the practical with the literary and scientific.\n\nIt is true, I admit, and it is very gratifying that it is true, that the spirit of enquiry regarding the history and the traditions of the Hindus which has sprung up in Europe within the last few years has awakened a deep interest in this ancient people, their institutions, and their languages. This interest, moreover, has extended far beyond the boundary limits of that comparatively small section of European communities which is connected with India, and which may be said to be directly interested in the welfare of her peoples; or that fraternity of literary and scientific men who occupy themselves with old stones and bones, foot-prints of ages long since passed away. Not only the antiquity of the Aryans, and their influence and that of their language on the peoples and languages of the West, but the brotherhood of the race have been fully recognized.\n\nBut if the study of the literature of the Hindus makes us acquainted with ancient India, and the modes of thought, the institutions, and the degrees of civilisation attained by the peoples of India in former times, it is not until we are brought in contact with the Moslim in India that we are enabled to assign accurate dates to kings, or that the sequence of events\ncan be recorded with that guarantee for their accuracy which is necessary for the requirements of history. Even here we are sadly at fault; for, regarding the early Moslim conquests in India, little reliable evidence has been recorded, some of that little has been lost, and much of that which remains is still unavailable to the public, being locked up in MSS. which are daily becoming more scarce from the ravages of time, climate, and moths, insects, and worms, upon whom nature imposes the necessity of sustaining life.\n\nMany able men have occupied themselves with the history of India, and each and all of them have contributed in their degree to dispel the mists of ignorance which cloud the knowledge of even the best informed persons in England on this subject. The Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone has written, perhaps, the most generally approved history of India. Still how very incomplete it is, and how very incomplete is every history of India that has yet appeared! Yet the materials for a history of the Mohammadan period, if incomplete for the whole, exist in abundance for a great if not the greater part; and it does not reflect credit on the English name or nation, that having been the paramount power in India now for upwards of a century, and having been for upwards of half that period in complete possession of the greater portion of it, no efficient effort has been made to collect and consolidate these materials in such a manner as to make them available for the service of the future historian and for the instruction of the patient student, or of those who come to India to rule, to trade, to travel, or for any other purpose of business or pleasure. True it is, as just stated, that the materials for the compilation of a history of India for the six hundred years of Mohammadan dynasties are not so complete for all portions of that period as could be wished; indeed, for some they are very scant. True it is that the great mass of Mohammadan historical works partake more or less of the character of biographies, and are rather chronicles of the deeds of kings than of the events of the period, the institutions of the people, the progress of civilization, and the results of policy and contemporaneous opinions regarding them, and are deficient in\nmany of those characteristics which enable posterity to derive valuable lessons from the experiences of the past. More true still is it that most of the historians were for the most part court chroniclers who wrote to order, and whose business it was to employ their eloquent language to draw a veil over the vices of those whose virtues they were hired to extol. Still, I do not coincide in opinion with those who estimate as of little worth the large body of historical works which has been bequeathed to posterity by the many very able writers who flourished at intervals within the period above mentioned. Where are the historians from the ages of the Greeks and Romans down to our own time, to whose writings many and grave objections may not be taken? You might almost count them on the fingers. In reading Oriental histories, moreover, all due allowance must be made for the influences of despotism, bigotry, love of flattery, and personal vanity, which is peculiarly characteristic of the men and the times of which they wrote; but though exaggeration may sometimes have been resorted to, a main peculiarity of Mohammadan writers\u2014which is of the essence of all sound history\u2014is regard for truth. Nor are we altogether dependent upon court chroniclers; we have in some instances contemporary and independent historians; besides which, writers have never failed to comment freely upon the histories of those authors who have preceded them, and their testimony in such cases may be considered impartial. Where, again, is the Emperor in modern times who would so truthfully and so frankly record his own follies and vices as the Emperor Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr has done in his memoirs or auto-biography, commonly called the T\u00fazak-i-Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr? Where is now-a-days the empire in which an author could dare to write of his despot ruler in the unmeasured terms in which \u2019Abd al K\u00e1dir of B\u00e1d\u00e1on has written of the Emperor Akbar? Where in the whole range of the literature of that period of the world\u2019s history can we find a more valuable and complete compendium of the political, religious, social, commercial, and agricultural institutions of a nation than is contained in the Institutes of Akbar compiled by Abul Fazl? That much valuable information is to be acquired,\nand that many useful deductions may be drawn from the facts and events found recorded in the pages of the Mohammadan historians of India there can be little doubt; and it is the more to be regretted that though attention was called to this subject now nearly twenty years ago, and a beginning was made, since then little has been done towards rescuing from destruction what the moths and insects have left behind.\n\nThe person who first drew attention to this important subject was Sir Henry M. Elliot, late Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and one of the ablest public officers and most accomplished scholars who ever adorned the Indian Civil Service. But the death of the author at the early age of forty-five not only put an end to the immediate completion of his original design, but the idea seems to have been abandoned by the Government, for whom, and on whose account, this lamented scholar prepared the materials which are now going through the press. This design was, to print or lithograph a \"Uniform Edition of the Historians of India.\" The proposal, it is true, was not accepted by the Government of the North-West Provinces of India, to which it was addressed, on the grounds that the education funds at the disposal of Government were not sufficient to defray the expense of such an undertaking. It was intimated, however, that it was desirable that an index should be prepared so that the MSS. should be sought for, and the works deposited in some College Library, \"to be printed or lithographed hereafter should circumstances render it expedient, and should the public taste, at present lamentably indifferent, show any inclination for greater familiarity with the true sources of the Mohammadan History of India.\"\n\nSir Henry Elliot published the first volume of his \"Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Mohammadan India\" in 1859; but neither then nor since, as far as I am aware, has any search been made for the MSS. therein indexed, which were to be placed in the College Library, to await that future favorable moment when they could be printed or lithographed. Whether it is to the inexpediency of \"circumstances,\" or the \"indifference of public taste,\" we are indebted for this unfor-\ntunate result, I cannot say; but, be that as it may, it is now too late to make the attempt.\\footnote{Since the above was written, Mr. Edward Thomas, the distinguished savant to whom the public are most indebted for the continuation of the papers of Sir H. M. Elliot, has brought to my notice that, under Mr. Colvin's orders, much search was made by Mr. Hammond, of the Bengal Civil Service, and that a number of MSS. were collected, but they were lost or destroyed in the mutiny. I remember the search made by Mr. Hammond, for he was in communication with me for some years; but I was not aware that his labours had resulted in the recovery of any MSS., or that they were lost. It would be interesting to have some record of what MSS. these were, so that, if possible, they might be traced. Possibly they may be amongst the Delhi prize MSS. (See Appendix to this Paper. Ed.)} With the overthrow of native dynasties, and the general break-up of Mohammadan society consequent on the mutiny and rebellion of 1857-58, all prospect of obtaining many rare or valuable MSS. in India disappeared; and though a good book may now and again be picked up, they are, in these days, seldom to be met with.\n\nA circumstance occurred, however, about eight years ago, which, if it proved mischievous in some respects, was fortunate for the design of Sir H. M. Elliot. The Bibliotheca Indica, a series of Oriental works, liberally patronized by the late Court of Directors to the extent of \u00a3600 a year, had some time contained a large number of Arabic works. Indeed, the character of the works which, from time to time, appeared in this publication, was influenced by the acquirements and predilections of the editors. During the incumbency of Dr. R\u00f6er, or from the year 1847 to 1852, the majority of the works it contained were Sanskrit. During the incumbency of my learned and esteemed friend, Dr. Aloys Sprenger, activity was shown chiefly in the publication of Arabic works. It was during this period that those grand works, the Kashifu 'z-zun\u00fan, or, \"Dictionary of the Technical Terms used in the Sciences of the Mohammadans,\" and the I\u1e63\u00e1bah fi tamyiz\u012b \u1e0d-\u1e62ih\u00e1bah, or, \"Biographical Dictionary of the Companions of Mohammad,\" were commenced. The value of such works as these to the students of Arabic philosophy and science, and the history of the first period of Isl\u00e1m, is incalculable. But a Sanskrit scholar, Professor H. H. Wilson, could not bear to see so much of the Honourable the Court's grant expended in publishing Arabic works. At his instance the noble old Court of Directors ordered that no work other\nthan works relating to India should be printed in the *Bibliotheca Indiae*, under pain of the grant being withdrawn; and it was under these circumstances that the Asiatic Society of Bengal conceived the idea of devoting the funds hitherto expended in the publication of Arabic works, to a Persian series, which should contain chiefly works on the History of India. Dr. Sprenger having returned to Europe, the task of the selection of the histories to be printed, subject to the approval of the Council of the Society, devolved upon me; as also their superintendence while passing through the press. I may, therefore, give my own explanation of the objects of the publication, as addressed to the Society from the Chair, at the general meeting for August, 1864, which was as follows:\u2014\"The present object of the Society in regard to the Persian series of the *Bibliotheca Indiae*, is to aid in working out an idea which originated with the late distinguished Sir Henry Elliot, viz., to place in the hands of the future historian the best original materials for compiling a history of this country; and the plan proposed for accomplishing our task is, to publish texts of the most trustworthy authors, giving the preference, when possible, to writers contemporary with the events their histories chronicle.\"\n\nI have underlined the last passage in the above extract, because it has been the guiding principle which I have kept before me in my selection of the histories which have been printed, and those which remain to be printed\u2014to obtain, if possible, the evidence of eye-witnesses of the events narrated; failing this, that of contemporary writers; and failing this, to obtain as near a view of the history of each period as possible; always assuming the authors selected to be considered trustworthy by their contemporaries, or by subsequent writers of note. That this principle is sound will not be questioned; but it has not, of course, been practicable to meet the first two conditions very often. Up to the reign of Akbar, we have not much contemporary history; nor have we any histories that were not available to the Mohammadan historians of later periods; but, still, when it is remembered that all European histories of India have been compiled from works written\ncenturies after the events they record, it will be a great stride in advance to get our materials first hand. One of the greatest faults of a large proportion of Mohammadan historians is their ambition to eclipse all writers of history who preceded them. Each historian seems to have set himself to write a history that would render all other histories obsolete.\n\nHence, the great number of universal or general histories, commencing with the birth of Adam, and brought down to the period of the author. Now it is plain that an author's version of events which occurred one or two hundred, or one or two thousand, years before he lived, could be useful only in the event of his having had access to works no longer extant, or which are not now easily procurable. When we had to deal, moreover, with so extended a period as six centuries, and had very limited funds at our disposal, it became necessary to consider whether it would be possible, within reasonable limits of time, to publish complete editions of all the works whose author's histories of their own times, and of those immediately preceding them, it was desirable to publish. I was of opinion that it would not; and that we should confer greater benefits on the public by adding, as soon as we could, as many missing links to the chain of the historical record as our search for good MSS. would enable us. It was not intended, however, to leave what may be termed standard works incomplete. Such works, it was always my opinion, should be completed as soon as the immediately pressing want was supplied and funds were available for the purpose. And an additional reason for this arose when it was found that the natives of India did not approve of incomplete histories, and would not readily purchase them. On financial grounds then the completion of certain histories is desirable, though the contents of the previously suppressed portions may not add much to the information already available to the future historian.\n\nThe first work of the new Persian series published in the Bibliotheca Indica, was Ab\u00fa'l Fazl Baihaki's history of Mas'\u00fad, the son of Mahm\u00fad of Ghaznin, edited by the late W. Morley, to whom was originally entrusted the task of\nediting Sir Henry Elliot's posthumous papers. This work he styled the *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Baih\u0101k\u012b*, but it is simply a portion of a very much larger work in several volumes entitled the *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-d\u012bl-i-Subuktagin*, or \"History of the descendants of Subuktagin,\" the father of Mahm\u016bd the Great, and nominally the founder of the dynasty commonly called the Slave.\\(^1\\) This is a great work, and a standard work for that period; and I was in hopes that more volumes of it might be found; but after much search I have not been able to hear of another volume, nor can I find even a complete notice of the work anywhere, nor that any late author has had access to it. I fear, therefore, that the remaining portion of this very valuable history has been lost. Shams-i-Sir\u0101j, the author of the *Tabak\u0101t-i-N\u0101qiri*, had a copy of it; and he has taken a great portion of his account of the kings of this family from its pages, quoting Baih\u0101k\u012b often in preference to any other author, which gives an additional value to those portions of his work which treat of times anterior to his own.\n\nMas'\u016bd, however, was not one of the kings of India, or, as they were in earlier times styled, kings of Delhi. But the history of the kings of Ghazn\u012bn and the Princes of the house of Subuktagin, from the time of Mahm\u016bd up to the final subjugation of Hindustan and the establishment of the Mohammadan power at Delhi, are so interwoven with campaigns and incidents connected with the foundation of the empire which the Path\u00e1ns succeeded in creating, that any history of India without some account of the rise, progress, and decline of the kingdoms of Ghazn\u012bn and Ghor would be incomplete. I doubt much, however, materials being found to give a very full account of this important period of history. Sir Henry Elliot has given a long list of authorities for a history of the kings of Ghazn\u012bn, but many of these books he had not seen, and his lists in great part are made up of the authorities he found referred to in the prefaces of Mohammadan histories. In his notices of authors and their books he has invariably stated what works he had himself seen and consulted, and those he had derived information of from others;\n\n\\(^1\\) Shams-i-Sir\u0101j, in his *Tabak\u0101t*, calls the work the *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-N\u0101qiri*.\nbut the notices which have been published are very few. The celebrated poet 'Unquri wrote a history of the life of Mahm\u00fad, and copies of it were extant about a century and a half ago, for it was consulted by the author of the Khul\u00e1qat-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh, one of the most carefully compiled general histories of India I know of. The author commences with the Pandus, and brings his narrative down to the end of the year 1107 A.H. It was continued for some years later by another hand; and here I may mention, as an instance of how desirable it is to print the texts of all the valuable histories of India compiled in former times we can, that the author of the well known Siyar ul Mutaakhhkharin, who wrote his history when Lord Hastings was Governor-General, has transferred almost the whole of this work to his pages verbatim, without ever once mentioning the author's name. A more glaring instance of plagiarism it would be impossible to conceive, yet the author of the Siyar has a great reputation, especially amongst European writers, and the name of the modest Subh\u00e1n Rai, the real historian, is probably wholly unknown.\n\nTo make matters worse, this dishonest copyist says, in the preface of his book, that he found a few pages of an old book prepared by some Munshi for one of the Mohammadan Emperors, which he made use of, but it was full of mistakes, which he corrected. This is nothing else but a barefaced falsehood; for if there are mistakes in Subh\u00e1n Rai's history he has copied them all, and made very many of his own besides. Another dishonest writer translated the same history into Hindustani, and giving it a new name, the Ara\u00edsh-i-Mahfil, passed it off as an original composition. He was, however, more honest than the other, as, though he denies that his book is a translation, he acknowledges some obligation. He deceived Mr. Shakespeare, however, the author of the Hindustani Dictionary, who always mentioned him as the author; and also Professor Dowson,\u00b9 the able editor of Sir H. M.\n\n\u00b9 The author seems to have been under some misapprehension on the subject. Mr. Shakespear heads his selections from the Ara\u00edsh-i-Mahfil with the statement that this work \"is for the most part founded on the Khul\u00e1qat-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh.\" Professor Dowson himself has on no occasion entered into the question of the authorship of this work, having merely quoted the work by name.\u2014Ed.\nElliot's History of India, now going through the press. A great portion of the remainder of the *Siyar* is copied, though not verbatim, from *Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n*. This author I suppose was too well known to admit of the perpetration of so disgraceful a fraud upon the public without the certainty of detection.\n\n'Un\u00e7ur\u00ed was a contemporary of Ma\u1e25m\u00fad, and, from his high reputation as a scholar, a history of this king from his pen would be very valuable; but I fear the book has been lost. We have a history, however, by a contemporary writer, also a very accomplished scholar and distinguished poet, Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r Mo\u1e25ammad bin \u2019Abd al-Jabbar al \u2019Otbi, the author of the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Yamini*. He wrote his history in the year 410 A.H., and it has always been considered in India a masterpiece of style and Arabic composition. It is consequently very difficult to understand; and having been written at the time the events it chronicles occurred, or when they were not only fresh in the memory of all, but the talk of half the continent of Asia, the facts related can be depended upon. Still as a history it would have been more acceptable had it been written in a simple narrative style. The consequence has been that the history has been overcome by the rhetoric, and what the author has gained in reputation as an elegant scholar he has lost as a truthful historian. Several commentaries have been composed on this work, one by \u1e32\u00e1sim bin al-Husain al-Khw\u00e1razm\u00ed, who died as early as 555 A.H.; and one by Ab\u00fa \u2019Abdallah Ma\u1e25m\u00fad bin \u2019Omar an-Naj\u00e1t\u00ed an-N\u00edsh\u00e1p\u00far\u00ed, entitled the *Bas\u00e1tin al-Fuzal\u00e1 wa Ri\u0101\u1e25in al\u2019Ukal\u00e1*, in 704 A.H., who says in his preface that he had consulted five previously written commentaries. A translation of the work in Persian was also made by Ab\u00fa\u2019 sh-Sharf Na\u1e63\u012b\u1e25 bin Zafar.\u00b9\n\nThe book is very highly esteemed, especially in India, and was lithographed at Delhi by Dr. A. Sprenger in 1847, and was formerly one of the test books in the Oriental Colleges in Upper\n\n\u00b9 (An English translation of the Persian text, by the Rev. J. Reynolds, was published under the auspices of the Oriental Translation Fund, in London, in 1853.) See also N\u00f6ldeke's article on the *Kit\u00e1b Yamin\u00ed* in \"Sitzungs-Berichte der Wiener Academie der Wiss,\" vol. 23 (1857).\u2014Ed.\nIndia; yet I do not think it has ever been used by any European historian. For some years copies have not been procurable; but I have lately extracted and reprinted the portion relating to Mahmud's conquests in India in a test book which I compiled for the Calcutta University B.A. examination; and as the Asiatic Society of Bengal are precluded from publishing it in their Bibliotheca, I intend printing and publishing a complete edition of this work at my own risk if I can obtain good MSS.\n\nBut the most remarkable author, perhaps, of all those who wrote upon India at this period was Ab\u00fa Raih\u00e1n al-B\u00edr\u00fan\u00ed (430 A.H.), of whom Rash\u00edd ud-d\u00edn, who wrote before and after 700 A.H., expresses the following opinion:\u2014\"He was the servant, the philosopher, and astronomer of Mahmud, son of Subuktagin; he lived for forty years in India,\u00b9 and has related everything connected with the religions, astronomy, laws, and psychology of the people, the height and density of their mountains, their deserts, rivers, cities, manners, customs,\" etc. But al-B\u00edr\u00fan\u00ed was a traveller, and his book is valuable for the elucidation of the Hindu rather than the Mohammadan period of Indian history. There are two copies of his work in Europe, and we were promised an edition of it by Professor W\u00f6pcke, but since the death of this distinguished scholar there is every reason to fear that the idea has been abandoned. Rash\u00edd ud-d\u00edn's history, or the J\u00e1m\u00ed'ut-T\u00e1rc\u00edkh-i-Rashidi, has a great reputation amongst European scholars. The greater portion of it was supposed to be lost, and the discovery of the missing portions was welcomed with great rejoicing in Paris, London, and Calcutta. But except in so far as concerns the history of the reigns of Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n Olj\u00e1it\u00fa and of Rash\u00edd ud-d\u00edn's own times, for which it may be considered a standard work, and in the sense before mentioned, it is of little value. The whole of the T\u00e1rc\u00edkh-i-Yamini has been transferred by the author to his pages; and the same in regard to other works, may be said of the remainder of his history down to about 650 A.H. It is unnecessary, however,\n\n\u00b9 This, I think, must be a mistake, otherwise Ab\u00fa Raih\u00e1n must have left Khorasan too young to gain the high reputation he acquired in his own country.\nhere to go into this question. I have discussed it fully in the fragmentary materials for a treatise on the \"Principles of Historic Criticism as applied to the writings of Mohammad\u00e1n Historians,\" which I have for some years been collecting, but which I have not had time to attend to.\n\nBut to return to Al 'Otbi, who has been so long neglected by the Oriental literary world, and to my humble effort to restore to him that merit of which, though justly his due, he has been deprived. I am unable to say how far the distinguished and undoubtedly very able and accomplished Rash\u00edd ud-d\u00edn is responsible for the disingenuousness involved in the suppression of Al 'Otbi's name, because I am not certain\u2014rather, I should say, I have grave doubts\u2014that we have his history in the form in which he wrote it; and because I do not know whether or not he made use of Sharf ud-d\u00edn's Persian translation of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Yamini, or the work of some other author who had previously appropriated things not his own without due acknowledgment. Writers in Persian are unfortunately extremely unsatisfactory on all points of this nature, and this is especially noticeable when we have to deal with translations into that language. (Compare the Persian translation of Tabari by Bal'am\u00ed with the original in Arabic.)\n\nBut with all this I have no concern just now. The translation of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Yamini to be found in the T\u00e1rikh-i-Rashidi is extremely free, and, though in substance accurate, contains in the MSS. which I have consulted a good number of omissions. Still the author or translator would not seem to have availed himself of any fresh materials. He begins his narrative where Al 'Otbi began his; and although writing about three centuries later, he leaves off where Al 'Otbi has concluded. And as Rash\u00edd ud-d\u00edn, at the present day, has a very great reputation, and Al 'Otbi is comparatively unknown, for the satisfaction of all who may be interested in the matter, I give the headings of the chapters of both authors, premising that while Rash\u00edd ud-d\u00edn has followed the narrative of Al 'Otbi throughout, he has not thought it necessary invariably to adopt his division into chapters.\n| T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Yam\u012bn\u012b of Al \u2019Otib\u012b | Page |\n|-------------------------------|------|\n| Of the times of the late Amir Ab\u016b Mans\u016br Subuktag\u012bn and of his life. | 16   |\n| The Conquest of Bust.        | 19   |\n| The Conquest of Ku\u1e0d\u0101r.       | 22   |\n| Of the causes which enticed the Turks into the country of the Amir Ab\u016bl K\u0101sim N\u016bh b.

I have not been able to ascertain the date of his birth. It was probably about 400 A.H.; and as he wrote his history apparently between the years 450 A.H. and 460 A.H.,\nhe may be considered a contemporary author for the first sixty years of the fifth century. In speaking of Subuktag\u00edn he generally says, \"I heard so and so from my father.\" During the reign of Mahm\u00fad's son Mas'\u00fad, Baihak\u00ed's master, Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r Mishk\u00e1n, who also wrote a history, which is lost, was head of the Government Secretariat Department, and, according to Baihak\u00ed, was a very elegant letter writer. Baihak\u00ed was his chief assistant or secretary, and had frequent interviews, on business, with the Sultan. On the death of Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r, not having been appointed to succeed him, he considered himself slighted, and placed his resignation in the hands of the king. Mas'\u00fad, however, would not accept it; and although he acknowledged Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl's fitness for the office, he said he was somewhat too young for so important a post. The portions of his history published, although they are chiefly devoted to the biography of Mas'\u00fad, which is brought down to his imprisonment in 431 A.H., treat also of matters connected with the reigns of Subuktag\u00edn, Mahm\u00fad, Mohammad, and, incidentally, of events of the reigns of Furrukhz\u00e1d and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, who ascended the throne, according to Baihak\u00ed, in 451 A.H. This latter king reigned forty-one years; and Baihak\u00ed died in the middle of this reign, so his work cannot contain a complete history of the dynasty founded by Subuktag\u00edn, which terminated with Khusraw Malik Khusraw Sh\u00e1h, who was killed by Mu'izz ud-d\u00edn S\u00e1m, the Ghorian, 598 A.H.\n\nAl Baihak\u00ed has also given some account of the kings of Khw\u00e1razm, which he has extracted from a work by Rash\u00edd ud-d\u00edn's oracle, Al-B\u00edr\u00fan\u00ed, who was a contemporary, though forty years his senior. His whole history is confused, and presents the appearance rather of a rough draft than of a revised text. That which he has related, however, is accurate, and can be accepted as truthful history; for we have not only his own statement, viz., \"I have recorded nothing that I have not myself seen, or have not received on the most trustworthy authority,\" but the internal evidences of truth and honesty his history affords, and the high testimony borne to his character by other writers of note. Regarding the con-\nfused style of his history, moreover, it is only doing him common justice to record here his own pathetic lament for the loss of the official documents which would have enabled him, he says, to make his history so much more worthy of posterity. In speaking of a despatch sent by Mas'ud to the Khal\u00edfah at Bagdad he makes the following remarks:\n\n\"My master B\u00fa Naqr made a draft of the letter in a style that he knew so well how to do, for as a letter writer he was the first man of his age (Im\u00e1m-i-rozg\u00e1r dar dab\u00edr), I who am Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl copied this letter. All letters to the Khal\u00edfah, the Kh\u00e1ns of Turkistan, and the kings of the neighbouring countries, were in my handwriting, and I had charge of the office copies; but, intentionally, they made away with them (na chiz kardand). Alas! many times alas! that that garden of Paradise is gone, for had it been otherwise, this history would have been very different from what it now is. But I am not hopeless that through the grace of God I may yet obtain these papers, and thus be able to publish them all. The public will then be in a position to judge of the worth of that high official (B\u00fa Naqr).\"\n\nThe poor fellow seems to have been sadly distressed by the loss of these papers, though how they were kept from him his remarks do not make clear. He refers to them again further on in his history, and repeats the above lament, adding that he had asked the sons of B\u00fa Naqr for the copy of a letter without result. He mentions in very high terms a contemporary, Mahm\u00fad Warr\u00e1k, who, he says, had written \"the history of a few thousand years (chandia haz\u00e1r s\u00e1l),\" bringing his narrative down to 409 A.H.; and adds, \"he there stopped, because I had commenced my history from that year. And this Mahm\u00fad,\" he continues, \"is accurate and trustworthy. I have seen about ten or fifteen of his works on various subjects of great merit, and I wished to write a long eulogy upon him, and to quote much from him, but as soon as his sons heard of it they said to me, 'We who are his sons are not willing that you should take more than you have already taken from our father.' Being helpless, therefore, I desisted.\" What foolish children those of Mahm\u00fad Warr\u00e1k? Who now knows anything of their father? Where are the ten or fifteen works on various subjects of this able writer\nand no doubt learned man? Where are the numerous works of Ab\u00fa Naqr Mishk\u00e1n; of At-T\u00e1lab\u00ed, of \u2019Im\u00e1d al-K\u00e1tib; of Aq-\u00c7\u00e1b\u00ed, the author of the T\u00e1ji; of Ab\u00fa Raih\u00e1n al-B\u00edr\u00fani, the philosopher and astronomer royal of Ma\u1e25m\u00fad; of \u2019Al\u00ed al-Bust\u00ed, Subuktag\u00edn\u2019s K\u00e1tib; of Ibn al-Mastauf\u00ed, and hundreds of other authors of this period, who were contemporaries with Al-Baihaqu\u00ed or immediately preceded him, and of those whose names even are no longer known? Where is the Nasab N\u00e1mah-i Sal\u00e1\u1e6din-i Ghor, compiled in verse by Fakhr ud-d\u00edn Mub\u00e1rak Sh\u00e1h, and dedicated to \u2019Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn Hosain Jeh\u00e1n Soz, and the abridgement of Baihaqu\u00ed\u2019s own work, which Minh\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn tells us was made by one of the illustrious men of Ghaznin in the times of Mu\u2019izz ud-d\u00edn Mo\u1e25ammad S\u00e1m (602 H)? Al \u2019Otbi mentions the names of nine or ten poets of celebrity of his time, scarcely one of whom Ibn Khallik\u00e1n or others have given us any notice of whatever; besides a whole host of other authors might be mentioned whose works have been involved in the general destruction of MSS. which has been steadily progressing with the revolutions of the seasons and the wars of Isl\u00e1m. If anything is to be done in India it must be done quickly, for our climate is very different from that of the dry climate of Arabia, where neither the worm nor the moth abound. But I wander somewhat from the immediate subject in hand.\n\nThere are other special histories of the kings of Ghaznin, and perhaps of the kings of other dynasties, which it would be desirable to publish in a series devoted to the history of India; but as I see no present prospect of obtaining materials in India for giving editions of them, I may pass on to the histories of those sovereigns of the house of Ghaznin who may legitimately be styled kings of Delhi. The first on the list is the T\u00e1j ul-Ma\u00e1sir, by Hasan Niz\u00e1mi,\u00b9 who wrote the history of the times of Kutb ud-d\u00edn Aibak and Shams ud-d\u00edn Ailtimash, the first Mohammadan conquerors of Delhi, with whom he was a contemporary, and at whose courts he resided. Contemporary historians of this early period are very scarce;\n\n\u00b9 Haji Khalifah calls the author \u00c7adr ud-d\u00edn Mo\u1e25ammad bin Hasan-i-Niz\u00e1mi; Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed calls him Kw\u00e1jah \u00c7adr Niz\u00e1mi.\nand although Hasan Niz\u00e1mi\u2019s history, in regard to style, is open to the same objection as Al \u2019Otbi\u2019s, it will be published as soon as a sufficient number of good copies can be obtained. I have at present only one copy, but other copies are procurable in India. The author\u2019s preface breathes the same spirit as that of Al \u2019Otbi, that, indeed, of the times in which he liyed\u2014the true spirit of Isl\u00e1m, \u201cuniversal dominion.\u201d We find in it also the same complaint of want of appreciation of learning and learned men, which scholars have been making from the earliest ages down to our own times, and considerably more egotism and vanity than could well be tolerated at present. Still he was an accomplished scholar, and he has so truthfully given expression to the Mohammadan \u201cidea,\u201d that I think it worth while to make a short abstract of a portion of his remarks:\n\n\u201cBe it known,\u201d says he, \u201cthat in accordance alike with the canons of the law and the dictates of the understanding, to wage war with the enemies of religion is both desirable and incumbent. The virtue of a religious war (jih\u00e1d) has been made evident by many very clear texts, viz., \u2018Fight in the path of God the righteous fight.\u2019 Again, \u2018Fight the unbelievers in God and the last day.\u2019 Again, \u2018Fight the polytheists (mushrikin) every one of them.\u2019 All persons of intelligence and understanding very well know that the stability of religion and good government, and the maintenance of the integrity of the law, are dependent upon jih\u00e1d; and that the prosperity and vigour of the Church and State are bound up with it. The administration of the affairs of a State without the intervention of the sword is impossible; and although the government of a country without the instrumentality of the pen or the civil power is equally so, still until the foundations of empire have been laid and strengthened by the sword, and the boundaries about and around the frontiers of Isl\u00e1m are cleared of the enemies of religion; until laws and regulations of justice and right are enforced for the protection of the cultivators and the poor,\u2014who are a sacred trust bequeathed (to kings) by the Creator,\u2014and the hand of oppression and persecution is stayed from the shedding of blood, and the rapine and plunder of the property of the Moslims; until all this has been accomplished by the sword, the orders and legal decisions of the learned, who are the inheritors of the laws of the Prophets, can meet with neither honour nor respect, nor\ncan the affairs of a kingdom be well administered.\u201d The author then goes on to say that \u201cproof of his position lies in the fact which is fully borne out by history, that in every age some one \u2018defender of the true faith\u2019 has arisen to fulfil the requirements of this theory; as, for instance, in the time of Mu'izz ud-d\u00edn Abu'l-Muzaffar Mohammad bin S\u00e1m bin al-Husain, Ab\u00fa'l H\u00e1r\u00e1th Kutb ud-d\u00edn Aibak,\u00b9 who having cleared Hindustan of the enemies (of Isl\u00e1m) by the sword, has left us the evidences and signs of his greatness and prowess to be the ornament of history.\u201d\n\nRegarding the author himself, we glean from his work that he was born at N\u00edsh\u00e1p\u00far, whence he came and settled at Ghaznin. He was a man of considerable attainments, and writes with much elegance, according to the Oriental idea, and consequently with great verbosity. He has devoted no less than fifty-seven pages to a recital of his objects and reasons for setting out from Ghaznin for Delhi, the objections his friends raised to it, and the circumstances which induced him to write his history. I can therefore only give a pr\u00e9cis of his remarks. He says\u2014\n\n\u201cI, Hasan Niz\u00e1m\u00ed, although it is desirable to abridge my remarks, yet since elegant writing hath charms which dispel weariness, before commencing on my subject, I may as well acquaint my readers with certain misfortunes which befell me, and a few of the events of the times. And, first, I would observe that I had never before travelled, or even contemplated travelling, until wars and rebellion in Khorasan became the rule, and no one any longer paid the slightest attention to persons of learning or erudition. Then, certainly, I resolved firmly to get out of the country. My friends opposed my intention, and this caused me to waver. At last, however, I left N\u00edsh\u00e1p\u00far, and, following the advice of Shaikh Muhammad K\u00faf, I went to Ghaznin, where I had the distinguished honor of kissing the feet of Shaikh Muhammad Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, and through the kindness of the Lord Chief Justice, Majd al-Mulk, my lucky star became in the ascendant. Some time I spent very pleasantly with him, but afterwards I was so unfortunate as to be separated from the companionship of these two most exalted personages. I, then, with a party of learned men and scholars, set out for\n\n\u00b9 Aibak means finger-cut; Kutbudd\u00edn the finger-cut, as we say Taim\u00far lang or Taim\u00far the lame. He had lost his little finger.\nand arrived at Delhi, which is the seat of honor and the centre whence liberality radiates. The fatigues of the journey caused me to fall sick, but my illness was not very serious, and after a little I recovered. Sharf al-Mulk,\u00b9 the Lord Chief Justice of Delhi, was very kind to me, and showed me, as his father had done before him, great attention. Other dignitaries also, seeing this, showed me the attention due to a stranger. Soon afterwards some of my intimate friends hinted to me that \u2018if a work in Persian,\u2014because the inclination of the people of the times either from want of ambition or deficiency in scholarship is more partial to that [language than to Arabic],\u2014were prepared, having a few couplets in praise of the men of the age interspersed throughout it, it would be very opportune at the present moment; it would remain as a memento of my scholarship for future ages, and the undertaking would certainly not be without some profit.\u2019 I naturally felt annoyed at this suggestion; lost my temper to such an extent that my sensitive understanding deserted me. I said to myself, is it not passing strange that the men of these times should think the highest result of education and the ripe fruit of hard and laborious study is the compilation of a book in Persian and the writing of a few verses? Nevertheless, reflecting upon the following words of the holy text, \u2018When the ignorant address ye, agree with them, or assent to what they say;\u2019\u00b2 and after many and extreme arguments I said to myself, after all the meaning of the proverb, \u2018a man is known by his parts,\u2019\u00b3 will not be hid from the observant. More especially, since I had been instructed to write an account of the victories of the king, it did not seem to me that I had the power longer to refuse, and that I ought to comply with the royal order, and relate the events and victories of his imperial reign, and at the same time do so in a composition which by its language and style would lead captive the hearts of all who should read it, while rendering\n\n\u00b9 The words I have translated are Qadr-i-Adli. Sharf al-Mulk is a title similar to Majid al-Mulk of Ghaznin. The Chief Justice was generally known by his title and not by his name. Sadr-i-Jih\u0101n was not common. From Taimur\u2019s time they were more generally known by the designation of K\u0101z\u012b al-Kuz\u0101t, though this title is also used in India earlier, as Akz\u0101l-Kuz\u0101t in Arabic.\n\n\u00b2 Koran 9th S. 3 v.: \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0637\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064c \u201cthey say, peace be unto them,\u201d and the meaning is precisely, \u201ckeep the peace with them, do not get into arguments or quarrels with the ignorant.\u201d\n\n\u00b3 A hadith \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0631\u0650 lit. \u201cby his heart and tongue.\u201d The author apparently means to imply that whatever he writes, men of understanding will easily perceive that it bears the impress of genius.\nconspicuous the eloquence and rhetorical power of the author. I commenced to write my work in one of the months of the year 602 A.H.\"\n\nThe headings of the chapters of the T\u00e1j al-Ma\u00e1sir are as follows: \"An account of the march [of \u1e32utb ud-d\u00edn Aibak] to conquer Hindustan and the battle of Ajm\u00edr in the year 585 A.H.; of the consignment of the Governorship of Ajm\u00edr to the son of Rai Pithora; of the conquest of Delhi, may God protect its good fortune, and perpetuate its glory; of the Governorship of Kahr\u00e1m and S\u00e1m\u00e1nah; of the defeat of Khun-w\u00e1n? and the killing in battle of the Rai; of the rebellion of Harr\u00e1j, brother of the Rao of Ajm\u00edr; of the march of his Highness towards Ghaznin; of his march towards Kol (K\u00f6il or Alighur) and Banares; of the battle of Banares; of his march towards Kol, and the consignment of its Government to M\u00e1l\u00edk al-Umar\u00e1 His\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn Ughlabak; of Ajm\u00edr again; of the consignment of the Government of Thankar to Bah\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn Tughral; of the conquest of Kal\u00e9war (Gualior); of the battle of Nahrivalah, and the defeat of the Rao; of the consignment of the Fort of Kalingar to Huzab ud-d\u00edn Hasan Arnab; of the return of the Emperor (Sult\u00e1n us-Sal\u00e1\u1e6din) from Khw\u00e1razm and the battle of Kokar; of the martyrdom of the Emperor Mu\u2019izz ud-d\u00edn Mohammad bin S\u00e1m; of the resignation of the neighbouring Princes and of the acceptance of Isl\u00e1m by the kingdoms of Hindustan; of the death of his Majesty the Emperor S. S. \u1e32utb ud-d\u00edn; of the accession to the throne of his Majesty the Emperor Shams ud-d\u00edn, may his reign last for ever; of the defeat of the army of Ghaznin, and the capture of Malik T\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn (Yaldoz); of the fight with, and defeat of, N\u00e1\u00e7ir ud-d\u00edn, and the conquest of L\u00fah\u00far (Lahor); of the consignment of the Government of Lahore to his Majesty\u2019s son N\u00e1\u00e7ir ud-d\u00edn.\"\n\nThe book is brought down to the year 614 A.H., but having but one copy I am not certain that it is complete throughout. The above is sufficient to show that the author was a competent chronicler of the events of his own times, and that his history contains matter of interest; in short, that the selection is a fit one. It will be observed that Hasan Niz\u00e1m\u00ed\nomits all mention of \u00c1r\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who has been included by later historians amongst the Sovereigns of Delhi, between \u1e32utb ud-d\u00edn Aibak and Shams ud-d\u00edn Ailitimash. The truth appears to be that one party set up \u00c1r\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h and another Ailitimash, and the latter was victorious; and of those who admit him to the honours of sovereignty, some say he reigned less than a year and others accord him only two or three days. None of his coins I believe are known to exist.\n\nAnother work which I have had before my mind\u2019s eye, and which should be published in this series, if materials can be obtained for an edition, is the Jam\u2019i ul-Hik\u00e1y\u00e1t wa lam\u2019i ur-R\u00faw\u00e1y\u00e1t of Jam\u2019ul ud-d\u00edn Mohammad Al \u2019Auf\u00ed, who also wrote in the time of the Emperor Shams ud-d\u00edn Ailitimash, and by order of his Waz\u00edr Niz\u00e1m ul-Mulk. It is in Persian, and was translated into Turkish by Ahmad bin Mohammad, commonly called Ibn \u2019Arab Sh\u00e1h (d. 854). Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed, Khwandahm\u00edr and others quote it; but as I have not seen the work I say nothing more about it, except that if any one has a copy I hope he will lend it to me. A copy is in the Paris Library, and copies could possibly be obtained elsewhere if they were sought for. These two works, the T\u00e1j ul-Mu\u00e1sir and Jam\u2019i ul-Hik\u00e1y\u00e1t, will give us a very near view of the events of the reigns of\u2014I. \u1e32utb ud-d\u00edn Aibak. II. Shams ud-d\u00edn Ailitimash.\n\nThe next work of importance on the list, and which has already been published under my editorship in this series, is the \u1e6caba\u1e33\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1\u00e7iri, by the Lord Chief Justice Ab\u00fa \u2019Omar Minh\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn \u2019Othman bin Sir\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn al Jauzj\u00e1n\u00ed. He was born at F\u00edrozkoh, in Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, 590 A.H., and came to India in the year 624 A.H., where he was made Principal of the College of Uchh, in Sindh. This was very shortly after Hasan Niz\u00e1m\u00ed, the author of the T\u00e1j ul-Mu\u00e1sir, died. We subsequently find him in Oudh, at Lakhnaut\u00ed, and at Gualior, always holding the highest legal and ecclesiastical offices; and finally at Delhi, first in the reign of Bahr\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, and afterwards in that of N\u00e1\u00e7ir ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, as Chief Justice. His work, as its name imports, is rather a book of dynasties than a history of any particular dynasty or number of reigns;\nand owing to the number of Emperors, Kings, and Princes, he has given us notices of in the portion which I have printed, viz., ninety-seven, many of them are extremely brief. Indeed, with the exception of the reign of Na\u1e63ir ud-din, in whose honour he compiled his work, and in the fifteenth year of whose reign he wrote it (658 A.H.), most of his biographical notices contain a mere outline. It must be borne in mind, however, that in Minhaj-i-Siraj's time Mohammadan India was divided into four kingdoms, the three minor ones acknowledging but a very nominal subordination to the Central Government, and that only under powerful Sovereigns. These were Hindustan, Bengal, the Punjab, and Sindh, each having their seats of Government at Delhi, Lakhnauti, Lahore, and Uchh. Now the peculiar and most important feature of the Tabakat-i-Nasiri is that it gives us a biographical sketch of the contemporary rulers of all these kingdoms, as also of the Kings of the countries beyond the Indus, as well as of the Emperors of Delhi. An objection to the Tabakat-i-Nasiri, however, is, that in the author's treatment of his subject he has generally applied his kingdoms to his kings instead of the reverse; and we therefore find Kings of Bengal mixed up in the same chapter, or tabakah, with Emperors of Delhi, and vice versa, because they were of the same lineage. Another very unsatisfactory point about his work is that he seldom names his authorities, contenting himself with that abominable habit, so sparingly adopted by good Arabian authors, of commencing a passage with \"trustworthy persons relate.\" The brevity of the notices too, even of many of the Emperors under whom Minhaj-i-Siraj himself held office, excludes them from the category of history. Still, short though they be, they are of the utmost importance as a means of checking the accounts of later and less trustworthy authors; and, looking to the comprehensive scope of the work and the very scanty remnants of the manuscript histories of the dynasties of which he has given us an account, the Tabakat-i-Nasiri is certainly the most valuable historical record of the period which has been preserved.\n\nMinhaj-i-Siraj, in the preface, gives the following statement\nof the objects and reasons for compiling his work. He says, briefly:\n\n\"I found a chronological table of historical events which had been compiled by certain learned men in the times of the successors of Na\u1e63ir ud-din Subuktagin with the view of enlightening posterity regarding the history of the Prophets, Khalifahs, and Kings, and their descendants in times past; and in the preparation of which they had indented on every available source of information. After treating of the affairs of the prophets and their pure descendants and the Khalifahs of the Bani Umayyah, and the Bani l-Abb\u00e1s, and the Kings of Persia and the Khusrocs, they concluded with an account of the affairs of the house of the auspicious Sultan Mahmud Subuktagin, excluding the history of other Kings, and Emperors, and their collateral branches, anterior and contemporary. I therefore desired to enlarge this abridgement so as to include the history of all the Mohammadan Sultans of Arabia and Ajam, both in earlier and later times; and throw some light on the affairs of each separate house and family, such, for instance, as the Tobb'as of Yaman, and the Himyarite Kings; and after treating of the Khalifahs, recount also the affairs of the Al-i-Boyah, and the Tahirian, Saffarian, the Samanian, Saljukian, Rumian, Shansbani\u00e1n, who were the Sultans of Ghor, and Ghaznin, and Hind, and the Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1hian, and the Kings of Kurd, who were the Sultans of Syria, and the Kings and Salatin-i-Mo'izziyah, who sat on the thrones of Ghaznin and India down to the auspicious times of the present reigning Sovereign Na\u1e63ir ud-din Abu'l-Muzaffar Mahmud bin us-Sult\u00e1n, who is of the dynasty of Ailtimash, and who has inherited the throne by regular succession. I wrote this history and adorned it by entitling it after this auspicious Sovereign, 'The Tabak\u00e1t-i-Naqiri.' Minhaj-i-Siraj continues in the introduction to his chapter on the Ghaznavi Kings: 'The Im\u00e1m Ab\u00fa l-Fazl al-Husain Baihaki in the T\u00e1rikh-i-Naqiri relates on the authority of the Sultan Sa'id Mahmud, that he (Mahmud) had heard from his father Subuktagin,' etc.; 'and the Im\u00e1m Mohammad 'Al\u00ed Ab\u00fa l-K\u00e1sim Hamm\u00e1di, in the chronological or historical table (T\u00e1rikh-i-Majadwal) relates as follows,' etc. He also quotes the T\u00e1rikh-i-Mukaddasi, and a work by\n\n1 Literally, \"from every garden a flower, from every ocean a drop, they had collected. It is a pity Minhaj-i-Siraj did not mention the names of these authors or the name of their book. Possibly it was Mahmud Warrak of whom Baihaki speaks.\"\nAb\u00fa 'l-Hasan al-Haidham an-N\u00e1bi (?); but generally, as before mentioned, he has not given his authorities.\"\u00b9\n\nHe concludes his chapter of the biographies of the Emperors of Delhi with an account of the events of the fifteenth year of N\u00e1gir ud-d\u00edn\u2019s reign (658 A.H.), or up to the date of his writing his book; and he there expressed a hope that if he lived he would be able to continue his history; but he does not seem to have done so. He wrote another work, however, named the N\u00e1giri-n\u00e1mah, but I have no information of it except that it contains an account of the siege of the Fort of Nandanah, near Kinnouj, by General Balban, then styled Ulugh Kh\u00e1n, and afterwards Emperor, and of the capture and imprisonment of Dalk\u00ed and Malk\u00ed.\u00b2\n\nTaking up the history where the author of the T\u00e1j ul-Ma\u00e1sir lays it down, Minh\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn has given us an account of the reigns of the following Emperors of Delhi:\n\nII. Shams ud-d\u00edn Ailtimash.\nIII. Rukn ud-d\u00edn F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h.\nIV. R\u00e1dhiyah, the Queen.\nV. Mu\u2019izz ud-d\u00edn Bahr\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h.\nVI. \u2019Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn Mas\u2019\u00fad Sh\u00e1h.\nVII. N\u00e1gir ud-d\u00edn Ma\u1e25m\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, first 15 years.\n\nFollowing in the wake of Minh\u00e1j-i-Sir\u00e1j, but about half a century later, Z\u00ed\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn Barn\u00ed wrote a standard history of very great merit, which has already been published in this series, under its title, the T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi. The author was born about the year 684 A.H. At least he says in his history that in the year 758 A.H. he was then 74 years of age. He frequently says throughout his book, \u201cI heard so and so from my father;\u201d and taking dates, and the standing and position of the authorities, I think I am authorised in including these two histories in the historical chain without any connecting link.\n\nThe preface of the T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi is rather long and somewhat bombastic. The author enters into a long dis-\n\n\u00b9 [A full list of the contents of the Tabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1giri is to be found in Mr. Morley\u2019s Catalogue of the MSS. of the Royal Asiatic Society (1854).\u2014Ed.]\n\u00b2 The copulative has puzzled Orientalists, as it is plain from the context that one individual only is meant.\nquisition on the value of history, and has given at length seven reasons for its superiority over other branches of knowledge, and why very few are competent to undertake the task of writing a history, and why he himself was possessed of peculiar fitness for it. I give a few extracts from it and his book below; but I may mention here, that my main object here is to show that the works selected for publication in the Persian series are the best available sources for the history of Hindustan under the Mohammadan Sovereigns of Delhi, and that the authors of them are trustworthy, and have been considered so by their contemporaries and those Mohammadan historians of celebrity who followed them.\n\nZ\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed mentions four historians of Delhi, who, he says, were trustworthy. \u00c7adr Niz\u00e1m\u00ed, the author of the T\u00e1j ul-Mu\u00e1s\u00eer; \u00c7adr ud-d\u00edn Au\u0161\u00ee, the author of the J\u00e1mi\u2019 ul-Hik\u00e1y\u00e1t; K\u00e1dh\u00ed \u00c7adr-i-Jih\u00e1n, Minh\u00e1j Jauzj\u00e1n\u00ed, compiler of the Tabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1\u00e7iri; and Kab\u00edr ud-d\u00edn, son of T\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn \u2019Ir\u00e1ki, who, in the times of \u2019Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn, wrote his victories with great elegance. \u201cAll four,\u201d he says, \u201cwere trustworthy, honourable, and illustrious. And be it known that whatsoever trustworthy historians have written, others have accepted; but whatsoever upstarts and unknown people have written, wise men have treated with inattention and rejected, and the histories of such worthless writers having lain for years in the shops have been handed over to the manufacturers, and become again fine white paper.\u201d He adds an important condition as affecting the character of an author, viz., that he ought to be a man of sound and orthodox religious principles, as many writers from excessive bigotry have been induced to tell lies. He refers also to the precautions he has taken to state nothing but the truth; and further on (p. 237) he says, \u201cI, who am the compiler of the T\u00farikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi, have in my preface made this agreement, that whatever I shall write in this history shall be the whole truth (r\u00e1sta r\u00e1st). Of the persons whose history I relate I shall relate both their good and bad (actions). To publish men\u2019s good actions and to conceal their bad is what I shall not do; for if I should carelessly overlook (their bad actions) and\nrecount solely their excellent deeds, and shut my eyes to their evil deeds, then my writings in the auspicious eyes of my readers would be distrusted, and I myself should not be absolved by God.\u201d This is introduced in the midst of a passage in which he gives an account of the murder of Jal\u00e1l ud-d\u00edn F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h, in which he has anathematized all who had a hand in this foul deed, including his own uncle, \u2019Al\u00e1 ul-Mulk, who was a Kotw\u00e1l, or Governor of Delhi,\u00b9 and \u2019Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn, the Emperor, and calls them K\u00e1firs and other epithets, which sound equally elegant and polite in the ears of Moslims.\n\n\u201cHaving in this preface before laid down the rules, etc., which should regulate the writing of history, and having treated of the excellence, etc., of this branch of literature in a manner which no historian, or writer of history in the Persian language, has ever done before, by intending in this lengthy treatise to show the great pleasure and profit I had derived from the study of this subject, I, Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed, the compiler of the T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1h\u00ed wished to write a history myself, beginning with the birth of Adam and his two sons, etc., etc. After recounting the events of the times of the Prophets, etc., to that, I wished to take up the reigns of the Khal\u00edfahs and Sultans of Isl\u00e1m, down to the king of my own time, with whose name I have adorned the title-page of this history. While fully occupied with this intention, however, I recalled to mind the T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i-\u1e6cabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1qiri, which Minh\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn Jauzj\u00e1n\u00ed had compiled with such wonderful ability. This work he compiled at Dehli, and included in it an account of the Prophets, Khal\u00edfahs, Sultans, from N\u00e1qirud-d\u00edn, son of Shams ud-d\u00edn Ailtimash, and the Kh\u00e1ns of the Shams\u00ed and N\u00e1qiri families, the whole being contained in twenty-three tabakahs. Now I said to myself, that if I should copy that which this illustrious and revered historian has written, the readers of my history who had already read his history would derive no profit; and if, on the other hand, I should write an account that should differ from his, or enlarge or abridge his history, then I should be accused of rashness and want of respect, besides which, the readers of the \u1e6cabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1qiri would be involved in doubt. I, therefore, thought it wise to exclude every thing to be found in the \u1e6cabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1qiri, and to confine myself to relating the\n\n\u00b9 Kotw\u00e1l in these days means a city or town magistrate. In those days it was a very high office, as we read of Ghiy\u00e1s ud-d\u00edn Balban having made the Kotw\u00e1l his representative when he left Delhi.\nhistory of the later kings of Dehli, not treated of by K\u00e1dh\u00ed Minh\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn, etc., etc.\"\n\nZ\u00eda ud-d\u00edn brings history down to the sixth year of the reign of F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h, who was the son of Rajab S\u00e1l\u00e1r, the brother of Ghiy\u00e1s ud-d\u00edn Tughlaq Sh\u00e1h, and his commander-in-chief. His tomb is in Baraich, in Awadh. Rajab S\u00e1l\u00e1r, strange to say, and another Mohammadan Bad\u00ed' ud-d\u00edn Mad\u00e1r, whose tomb is near Kinnauj, are held in great veneration by the sweeper-caste throughout Hindustan, by whom they are called S\u00e1l\u00e1r-o-Mad\u00e1r. In the T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi we have the history of eight Emperors of Dehli, commencing with Ghiy\u00e1s ud-d\u00edn Balban, and ending with F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h. He has excluded from imperial honours Shams ud-d\u00edn Kaiomurth bin Kai Kob\u00e1d bin Baghr\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, bin-i-Balban, who was only a few days on the throne; Rukn ud-d\u00edn Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm bin Jal\u00e1l ud-d\u00edn F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h Khalji, who was a few months on the throne; Shah\u00e1b ud-d\u00edn 'Omar bin 'Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn and N\u00e1\u00e7ir ud-d\u00edn Khusrau Kh\u00e1n, who sat on the throne\u2014the one for three months and a few days, and the other for four months.\n\nSome discrimination, perhaps, is necessary in ranking as sovereigns all who have taken advantage of the absence from Dehli of the rightful heir or the successful usurper to don the regal purple. Thus Kaiomurth sat on the throne but for a very few days; and though Rukn ud-d\u00edn occupied it for some months, what were the circumstances? 'Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn had invited the king to Allahabad, nominally to tender his submission, but really for the purpose of murdering him; and, having accomplished his wicked purpose, he at once assumed the reins of power. The Queen, who was at Dehli, hearing of the King's murder, set up his son in his stead, and wrote letters to all the nobles and governors north of Dehli to come to his support; but on 'Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn marching to Dehli he defeated the troops she was able to bring against him, and took possession of the capital. Rukn ud-d\u00edn Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm and Shah\u00e1b ud-d\u00edn, though short-lived, were king's sons; but Khusrau Kh\u00e1n was simply a king's murderer, and not having popular suffrage even in his favour, is looked upon\nby Mohammedans as a rebel. The first act of all such temporary kings no doubt was to assume the umbrella, to have the Khutbah read in their names, and to coin money, which are the principal insignia of royalty; and these facts are worthy of notice by numismatists, who might otherwise be puzzled at finding the coins of two kings of the same date. Still although an established and recognized ruler may lawfully be considered the sovereign as long as he holds his capital, it is questionable whether the accidental presence at the capital and the occupation of the throne by the lawful heir or a usurper, for a few days, weeks, or months, as the case may be, can give an aspirant to the throne a claim to descend to posterity as the emperor of a great nation, when he has not had the power to retain it against a competitor then in the field, nor has ever been acknowledged beyond the limits of a very small division or district of the empire.\n\nZi\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed undertook to continue his history to the close of F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h\u2019s reign, but he seems to have been disappointed in his expectations and hopes, and to have abandoned his task. He retired to a village in the suburbs of Delhi. This place was afterwards the burial place of many saints and distinguished men, and to the present day is celebrated as containing the shrine of the holy and revered Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn Ouli\u00e1. In his latter days Zi\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn was reduced to such extreme poverty that no more costly shroud than a piece of coarse matting could be furnished for his funeral obsequies. He was the friend of the poets Am\u00edr Khusr\u00fa and Mir Hasan, the former of whom he quotes often in his history, and whose tomb is not far from his.\n\nThe portion of F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h\u2019s history which Zi\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn left uncompleted, was finished by Shams-i-Sir\u00e1j \u2019Uff\u00ed, who also entitled his book the T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi. This work is often confounded with the history of Zi\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed, and is generally supposed to be a continuation of it; but it is in itself a complete history of the life and reign of F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h, and may therefore more appropriately be entitled the T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi than the work of Zi\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn, which contains so much of the reigns of other monarchs, and so little of that\nof Firoz Sh\u00e1h. I have selected this work also for the series; but copies of it are more rare even than of the T\u00e1rikh of Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed. One copy is in General Hamilton\u2019s library, and I have heard of another at Delhi, in the possession of Naw\u00e1b Z\u00ed\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn Loh\u00e1r\u00fa, of which General Hamilton\u2019s is perhaps a transcript, but I have not seen the work, nor yet the little work styled the Fut\u00fah\u00e1t-i-Firoz-Sh\u00e1hi, said to be written by Firoz Sh\u00e1h himself, and inscribed on the walls of his Masjid, which have long since been destroyed. It is contained in eight chapters, one of which Ferishtah has reproduced, copied apparently from the Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbari, and very incorrectly (see Bombay edition, p. 271).\n\nThese two Tav\u00e1r\u00edkh-i-Firoz-Sh\u00e1hi will give us the connected history of the following Emperors of Dehli:\n\nVIII. Ghiy\u00e1s nd-d\u00edn Balban.\nIX. Mu\u2019izz ud-d\u00edn Kai Kub\u00e1d.\nX. Jal\u00e1l nd-d\u00edn Firoz Sh\u00e1h, Khalji.\nXI. \u2019Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn, Khalji.\nXII. \u1e32utb ud-d\u00edn Mub\u00e1arak Sh\u00e1h.\nXIII. Ghiy\u00e1s ud-d\u00edn Tughla\u1e33 Sh\u00e1h.\nXIV. Ab\u00fa\u2019l-Fath Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h.\nXV. Ab\u00fa\u2019l-Muzaffar Firoz Sh\u00e1h.\n\nBut here I regret to say that there is a hiatus of about sixty years, which I fear there will be very great difficulty in closing up with the aid of contemporaneous historians. The period alluded to is that between Firoz Sh\u00e1h, 790 A.H., and Bahlol Lod\u00ed, 854 A.H., and the kings who reigned during this interval are as follows:\n\nXVI. Tughla\u1e33 Sh\u00e1h II.\nXVII. Ab\u00fa Bakr Sh\u00e1h.\nXVIII. N\u00e1\u1e63ir ud-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h.\nXIX. Sikandar Sh\u00e1h Hum\u00e1y\u00fan.\nXX. N\u00e1\u1e63ir ud-d\u00edn Ma\u1e25m\u00fad.\nXXI. Dawlat Kh\u00e1n S\u00e1di.\nXXII. Khizr Kh\u00e1n, the Saiyid.\nXXIII. Mu\u2019izz ud-d\u00edn Mub\u00e1arak Sh\u00e1h.\nXXIV. Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h.\nXXV. \u2019Al\u00e1 ud-d\u00edn bin Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h.\nHistories are mentioned, such as the *Jaw\u00e1hir ul-Akhb\u00e1r*, the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Mub\u00e1rak-Sh\u00e1h*, etc., but I do not know where to seek them. Information may incidentally be obtained from the several histories of Taim\u00far and his conquests, and some general histories. I only mention those histories, however, which have been printed in our series, and those special histories which I have selected, and of which I see a probability of obtaining materials upon which to found a tolerably accurate text. Nor do I think it at all probable that much contemporaneously written history will be discovered for this period, for I find that subsequent authors, and not of a very recent date, have lamented its absence.\n\nThus, in the next work which I have selected and already recommended for publication in this series, viz., the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Af\u00e1ghanah*, it is stated, as will be seen in the extract given below, that since the publication of the *Tabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1g\u00edri* and the *T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi* no history of merit has been written, and hence this history was compiled. The name of the author is Ahm\u00e1d Yadg\u00e1r. I do not find a biographical notice of this historian, but in his preface he has given an account of the origin of his work, from which it is clear that he was attached to the Court of D\u00e1\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, by whose order he wrote it. He says:\n\n\"One day, when in the presence of the king, Ab\u00fa'l-Mozaff\u00e1r D\u00e1\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, the history of Hanzah '\u00c1q\u00edf Kh\u00e1n was produced, and the conversation turned on this subject. The king said to me, 'Minh\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn Jauzj\u00e1n\u00ed compiled and dedicated a book to Sult\u00e1n N\u00e1g\u00edr ud-d\u00edn, son of Salt\u00e1n Shams ud-d\u00edn Ailtimash, embracing a history of the world from Adam to the time of the Sult\u00e1n alluded to, and in truth he executed a noble work. After him Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed wrote his history, styled the *T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1hi*, including an account of the times from Ghiy\u00e1s ud-d\u00edn Balban to those of F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h, thus giving the history of eight kings. But no one has written a history of the Afghan kings who after Am\u00e1nat Kh\u00e1n (P) sat on the throne of Delhi. It would be a good thing, therefore, if you would undertake to relate some of the events which took place during the sovereignty of the Afghans.' Since I have been a servant of this monarch for a long time, I see no alternative but to undertake the history of six of these kings,\"\nand relate the events which happened during their reigns, fully, completely, and in the order in which they occurred, so that the memory of the departed may remain, and may the beloved Allah aid me in my task. And since this dynasty began with Bahlol Lod\u00ed, I commence my history with his reign.\"\n\nIn the same strain the author of the T\u00e1rikh-i-D\u00e1\u00fadi says:\n\n\"History is not simply information regarding the affairs of kings who have passed away; but it is a science which expands the intellect and furnishes the wise with examples. Since this humble individual has spent a considerable portion of his life in studying historical works pregnant with instructive examples, and has examined the conditions of things under many sovereigns; and it appeared that the records of the reigns of the Afghan kings (of Hindustan), who were one of the dynasties of the times, existed only in a scattered form, I involuntarily conceived the design of collecting them, with the aid of the Almighty, in one volume.\" I therefore undertook the work, and in a very short time completed it. \"I commenced with the reign of Bahlol Lod\u00ed, who was the first king of the Afghan dynasty, and brought my history down to the (end of) the reign of Muhammad 'Adl\u00ed S\u00far D\u00e1\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, who was the last ruler of this race, and I entitled it the T\u00e1rikh-i D\u00e1\u00fadi.\"\n\nAhmad Yadg\u00e1r quotes the T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1mi and the Ma'dan al-Akhb\u00e1r; but the former was not written till the year 1001-2 A.H., and D\u00e1\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, in whose time the T\u00e1rikh-i-Af\u00e1ghanah was compiled was killed 984 A.H. Sir H. Elliot includes the latter in his list of authorities for this period, but whether or not he had ever met the work, I cannot say. Ahmad Yadg\u00e1r commences his history with Bahlol Lod\u00ed (854 A.H.), and concludes it with '\u00c1d\u00edl Sh\u00e1h (965 A.H.), giving the history of six kings.\n\nThere has been, apparently, a little confusion in the titles of some of the histories of this period. The authors of the Khul\u00e1\u00e7at ut-Taw\u00e1rikh mentions a history called the T\u00e1rikh-i-Af\u00e1ghanah, by H\u00e1san\u00ed Kh\u00e1n Afgh\u00e1n, which I do not know. Sir H. Elliot gives two histories under the title of Makhzan-i-Afgh\u00e1n\u00ed, and only one entitled the T\u00e1rikh-i-Af\u00e1ghanah. Sir H. Elliot is, probably, right; but I have only met with one Makhzan, and later authors, it appears to\nme, confound all. Ahmad Yadg\u00e1r does not make mention of the name of his book in his preface; and in my copy the book is styled the T\u00e1rikh-i-Sal\u00e1tin-i-Af\u00e1ghanah on the fly leaf; I have a copy of the Makhzan-i-Afgh\u00e1n\u00ed, by Ni'mat Ullah, and he names it in his preface T\u00e1rikh-i-Kh\u00e1n wa Makhzan-i-Afgh\u00e1n\u00ed. He calls himself Ni'mat Ullah bin Khw\u00e1jah Hab\u00edb Ullah al-Haruwi, and says that he compiled his work in the year 1020 A.H., by order of Kh\u00e1n Jih\u00e1n Lod\u00ed, who was high in the favour and also in the service of the Emperor Jih\u00e1ng\u00edr and the conqueror of the Deccan. He is thus a later author than Ahmad Yadg\u00e1r by some forty years. He has divided his book into seven chapters, but two only are of interest for this period, viz., the third and fourth. The first treats of Saul and the children of Israel, from whom the Afghans trace their descent; and the second of the first four Khal\u00edfahs, and of the conquest of Kh\u00e1lid bin al-Walid, in Syria and \u2019Ir\u00e1k. The third treats of the reigns of the Lod\u00ed\u2019s\u2014Bahlol, Sikandar, and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm; and the fourth of the S\u00fars and \u2019Adl\u00ed Sh\u00edr Sh\u00e1h, Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, and Mu\u1e25ammad \u2019\u00c1dil Sh\u00e1h, and the arrival of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan in India for the second time and the extinction of this dynasty, as he brings his history down to a later period than Ahmad Yadg\u00e1r; these two chapters might be published in an appendix to the T\u00e1rikh-i-Af\u00e1ghanah, if materials for editions of the Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm-Sh\u00e1hi of Mahm\u00fad bin Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Katw\u00e1n\u00ed, or the other valuable authorities he quotes cannot be obtained. These are the T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1mi of Khw\u00e1jah Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn Bakhsh\u00ed; the T\u00e1rikh Shir-Sh\u00e1hi of Shaikh \u2019Abb\u00e1s of Serdanah, and a work by Mawl\u00e1na Musht\u00e1k\u00ed, of Delhi, the name of which he does not give; or better, perhaps, would be a portion of the Zubdat ut-Tav\u00e1r\u00edkh, by N\u00far al-Hakk, son of the celebrated \u2019Abd al-Hakk of Delhi, especially that based on the T\u00e1rikh-i-Bah\u00e1dur-Sh\u00e1hi, which is written in a clear style. If any one has good copies of any of the above-mentioned books, I hope they will send them to me. Of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1mi I have two copies, but none of the Tav\u00e1r\u00edkh Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, Sh\u00e1hi Bah\u00e1dur-Sh\u00e1hi, and Shir-Sh\u00e1hi.\n\nThe times subsequent to the reign of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lod\u00ed were\ntroubulous, and the record of them unsatisfactory. The authors mentioned, however, will give us the history of the following six kings, the two last of whom, however, can hardly be said to have obtained complete possession of the dominions over which they nominally ruled. Indeed, after the memorable defeat of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lod\u00ed by B\u00e1bar, with the exception of the interval of the reign of Sh\u00edr Sh\u00e1h, one of the least honoured of the Mohammadan sovereigns of India, though one of the most worthy of honour, there was little settled government in India. The glory of Delhi was gone, and the nominal sovereigns resided chiefly in Bengal; their power was broken, and the prestige of the empire had disappeared.\n\nXXVI. Bahlol Lod\u00ed.\nXXVII. Sikandar Sh\u00e1h Lod\u00ed.\nXXVIII. Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h Lod\u00ed.\nXXIX. Sh\u00edr Sh\u00e1h bin Hasan S\u00far.\nXXX. Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h.\nXXXI. \u2019\u00c1d\u00edl Sh\u00e1h \u2019Adl\u00ed.\n\nMr. Erskine\u2019s translation of the memoirs of B\u00e1bar, and his History of India for the conquests and sovereignty of B\u00e1bar and Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, throw much light on the events of these epochs, and, though his materials were scant, he has provided fairly for this eventful period of Mohammadan rule in India. It cannot be said, however, that either B\u00e1bar or Hum\u00e1y\u00fan founded a dynasty in India,\u2014that honour in my judgment being the right of Akbar, whose generals, on Hum\u00e1y\u00fan\u2019s death, had to defeat \u2019Adl\u00ed and Sikandar S\u00far, and to retake Agra and Delhi. Though quite a youth, it was he who conceived the idea of cementing the heterogeneous elements of the various nations of India into one whole, and of consolidating the empire; and it was he, with the able administrators he called to his aid, who accomplished the task. And amongst all the sovereigns of Asia, it is of him we have the fullest information.\n\nOf histories of this period, general and special, we have such an abundance that we may exercise a choice. We have first the Akbar-n\u00e1mah of Ab\u00fa\u2019l-Fazl pronounced by all com-\npetent judges to be an admirable history of the great Emperor\u2019s reign, but from the most favourable point of view,\u2014a mirror, in short, warranted to reflect only his virtues. Next we have the grand history styled *Alfi*, or the history of a thousand years, in the compilation of which Akbar employed \u201call the talents\u201d of his Court, and which is no doubt a work of very great merit, but unfortunately copies of it are very scarce. Thirdly, we have the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1m\u00ed, Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbar-Sh\u00e1hi*, compiled by Khw\u00e1jah Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn Ahmad Bakhsh\u00ed, which is the basis of all the Mohammadan histories of this, and many of the preceding periods. Again we have the great work of Moh\u00e1mmad K\u00e1sim, the *Gulz\u00e1r-i Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u00ed*, commonly called the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Ferishtah*, which has served European historians as usefully as the work of Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn Bakhsh\u00ed has served Oriental writers. Fourthly, we have the *Muntakhab ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh* of \u2019Abd al-K\u00e1dir, of Bad\u00e1on, a work which, as a history, is second to none in the whole range of historical works by Mohammadan authors. These, with the exception of the *Akbar-n\u00e1mah*, are all general histories, but special of course for the period of the author\u2019s own times, which are those of the period under notice. Besides them there are a number of special histories, none of which, however, deserve mention along with the important works above given, and several by late compilers. I exclude from these remarks of course the *A\u00edn*, or Institutes of Akbar, compiled by Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl, which some consider simply the third volume of the *Akbar-n\u00e1mah*, but which is a large work in three volumes complete in itself.\n\nThe *Akbar-n\u00e1mah* I had recommended for publication in this series, but it has just been published at Lakhnau. The *T\u00e1rikh-i-Alfi* contains the history of Akbar and his predecessor\u2019s times up only to the year 1000 A.H., or thirteen years before the great monarch\u2019s death. Of the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Ferishtah* two editions have been published, one at Bombay in 1832 A.D., and one at Lakhnau about two years ago. The Bombay edition, though not free from errors, is the best. The work has also been translated into English. The *T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1m\u00ed* or *Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbar-Sh\u00e1hi* is brought down\nto only two years later, or the thirty-eighth year of Akbar's reign, but this history seems to have been recognized by all contemporary historians as a standard history, and was held in the greatest estimation by all subsequent writers of note. The author died at the early age of forty-five. 'Abd al-K\u00e1dir-i-Bad\u00e1oni passes the highest encomium upon him, both as a man and an author, and says that there were \"few either high or low at his funeral who did not shed tears over his loss, and bit the hands of remorse.\" Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl, also, in the Akbar-n\u00e1mah, alludes to the general mourning that followed the death of this distinguished author; and says that the emperor was deeply affected by it and offered prayers for his soul. 'Abd al-K\u00e1dir's history professes to be simply an abridgement of Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn's; and Ferishta states that of all the histories he consulted it is the only one he found complete. I recommended it for publication in 1864, but it has not, I regret to say, yet been commenced. The following extract I take from a report of mine to the Council of the Bengal Asiatic Society on that occasion:\n\n\"The history of the greater portion of the earlier periods we shall already have placed in the hands of the public, in the histories of Minh\u00e1j ud-d\u00edn and Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed, far earlier and possibly far better sources of historic evidence than many of those consulted by 'Abd al-K\u00e1dir-i-Bad\u00e1oni. We have thought it therefore undesirable to go over the same ground while the history of other periods remained uncompleted. I think it well worth consideration, however, whether in conjunction with this work we should not publish in lieu thereof certain portions of the Tubak\u00e1t-i-Akbari, which 'Abd al-K\u00e1dir professes only to have abridged, and which all later historians have made such good use of. Sir H. Elliot in his Muhammadan Historians (I. p. 178) says that 'notwithstanding that Ferishta pronounces this work defective, he has borrowed from it very freely.' But Sir H. Elliot's translator (for he generally marked his passages, and gave them to others who had more time for translating than he had), has misinterpreted the passage; for what Ferishta does say has quite the opposite sense. He says, 'Of all the histories of Hindustan that have come into my hands, I have not found a single one complete, except the history of Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn\nAhmad-i-Bakhshi,' meaning this 'Tabakat;' the only thing wanting, according to Ferishta, being the additional information which he himself possessed, and which we may assume he supplied in his own large work.\n\n\"It would seem hardly fair, also reviewing the question of character from that even, disinterested, and unbiased point, and with that jealousy proper to the honest and truthful historian\u2014to publish a history, the greatest value of which consists in correcting by its prevalent tone of censure and disparagement the fulsome eulogium of the Akbar-namah; without, at the same time, supplying the panegyric, the more especially as I find in Badoni's history abundant proof that his religious bigotry was such as to render it difficult for him to give an unbiased and impartial sketch of the character, or to draw right conclusions from the actions of so tolerant a monarch as Akbar. No recommendation has yet been made on this subject to the Society, but I hope soon to bring it forward.\n\n\"We will then have to consider the reigns of the three great successors of Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jehan, and Aurangzeb, during which, including the reign of Akbar himself, the glory of the Muhammadan power in India may be said to have attained its zenith. But for this and the fourth period, which we may call the decline of the Muhammadan power, no arrangements have as yet been made.\"\n\nSince the above remarks were made, the Akbar-namah, as before mentioned, has been published; but it is inconceivable to me why so erroneous an estimate seems to have been formed of the Tabakat-i-Akbar-Shahi, that it has not attracted more attention. It is the history which joins on to the Tarikh-i-Firoz-Shahi, and is admitted by all contemporary and subsequent authors to be the standard history in continuation of those authorities. Unquestionably then the thread of the narrative as given by Nizam ud-din Ahmad should be taken up where the authors of the Tarikh-i-Firoz-Shahi have dropped it, giving him the preference to 'Abd al-Kadir of Badoni, or any other author however excellent. The following extract from his preface fully bears out what I have so often repeated on the authority of almost all good Muhammadan authors, that Minhaj ud-din, and Zia-i-Barni, were the great historians of the early Muhammadan\nperiod, and that after their times up to the times of Akbar, however diligently we may search, few valuable historical works of a comprehensive nature will be found. The author of the *Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbar-Sh\u00e1hi* says:\n\n\"I, Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn Ahmad, son of Mohammad Muk\u00edm al-Haraw\u00ed, who am one of the favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the Court of His Imperial Highness, the increasing shadow of the most True, and the vicegerent of the Almighty, etc., Ab\u00fa'l-Fath, Jal\u00e1l ud-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h Gh\u00e1z\u00ed,\u2014I, Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn, beg to represent that from my youth, according to the advice of my father, I devoted myself to the study of works of history, which are the means of strengthening the understanding of men of education, and of affording instruction by examples to men of observation; and by continually enquiring into the affairs of the travellers on the high road of life, which is to make the tour of realities: I thus removed the rust from my inert disposition. Now in the wide plains of Hindustan, which is an empire of vast extent, composed of several geographical divisions of the earth, (*chand ak\u00e1l\u00edm*),\u00b9\u2014and the surveyors of the plains of the world have described it as a fourth of the earth's surface,\u2014many times in every division of this great country sections of the governing classes, obtaining an ascendancy, have assumed the title and discharged the duties of rulers, and the authors of their times having written histories of the affairs of their government, have bequeathed them as memorials to posterity. Such, for example, as the histories of Delhi, Guzerat, M\u00e1lwa, Bengal, and Sindh, and similarly all the divisions and frontier provinces of the kingdoms of Hindustan have formed the subject of separate histories. It is most extraordinary, therefore, that not a single work containing a complete compendium of the affairs of that division, the historical events of which it professed to chronicle, has yet been written by any historian; neither have the events connected with the centre of Hindustan, the seat of government of this empire, the capital of Delhi, been collected in one book. The work which is best known is the *Tabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1\u1e63iri*, which Minh\u00e1j compiled, commencing with the Sult\u00e1n Mu'izz ud-d\u00edn Ghor\u00ed, and concluding with N\u00e1\u1e63ir ud-d\u00edn bin Shams ud-d\u00edn: from thence to the time of Sult\u00e1n F\u00edroz is written in the history of Zi\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed; but from that time to to-day,\n\n\u00b9 This is rather loosely expressed; India comprises nearly two *Aklims* according to Mohammadan geographers. (See *Kazw\u00edni*, ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, page 84.)\nbecause, for the greater portion of the time, there was much disturbance in India, and the people had the misfortune to be deprived of a powerful Imperial Government, I have only met with a few detached and incomplete compilations. I have not heard of a single history that comprises an account of the whole of India, and now, since the whole of the inlying and outlying provinces of Hindustan have been conquered by the world-subduing sword of God's vicegerent, and all the fractions of the empire have been united in one grand whole, and many kingdoms, beyond the confines of Hindustan, which none of the great sovereigns who preceded his Majesty had ever acquired, have been included in his empire, and it is to be hoped that the seven climes will yet come under the shade of the standard of the good fortune of that illustrious personage, and thus be protected, and secure peace and prosperity, I conceived the idea of compiling, in a simple style, a history which should embrace an account of the affairs of all the kingdoms of Hindustan, from the times of Subuktag\u00edn 367 A.H. (which is the date of the introduction of Isl\u00e1m into Hindustan), up to 1001 A.H., or the 37th year of the Il\u00e1h\u00ed era (which commenced with the accession of His Imperial Highness), dividing it into chapters according to the several dynasties which reigned, closing each chapter with an account of the conquest, by His Imperial Highness, of the particular province under notice. This abridgement of all the victories of His Imperial Highness will be given in the proper place; the account of these victories, in full detail, being found in the Akb\u00e1r-n\u00e1mah, which All\u00e1mi Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl has compiled with so much ability.\"\n\nNext in order to the \u1e6cubak\u00e1t-i-Akbar-Sh\u00e1hi is the Muntakh\u00e1b ut-Tauc\u00e1rikh, compiled by \u2019Abd al-K\u00e1dir bin Mul\u00fak Sh\u00e1h of Bad\u00e1on. For that portion of the history of India anterior to his own times, his work cannot be placed before those histories which formed the basis of his own work, viz., The T\u00e1rikh-i-Mub\u00e1rak-Sh\u00e1hi and the T\u00e1rikh-i-\u1e6cubak\u00e1t-i-Akbar-Sh\u00e1hi. Its great value lies in its giving us a view of the character of the great Emperor from an opposition point, which is a somewhat rare qualification to find in contemporary Mohammadan writers of history, and the ability of its author and his superior qualifications for the task he undertook. He was a very bigotted Moslim, and the true spirit of Isl\u00e1m which so largely leavened his composition,\nbecame enflamed and blazed forth at the conduct of Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl and his brother Faiz\u00ed, and the extremes of toleration to which they not only permitted the Emperor to go, but in which they actually encouraged him. He has, however, unquestionably allowed his bitterness to impair his judgment and impartiality; and as pointed out by me in the extract from my report to the Philological Committee of the Bengal Asiatic Society, it would be the grossest piece of injustice to the dead Emperor to present the public with 'Abd al-K\u00e1dir's review of his character and no other. In my humble judgment it behoves the honourable historian of past ages to be most sensitive on the point of character; and I would far prefer to give hastily an unfavourable review of the character of a king who was living, or one who had friends living to defend him, than I would of one who lived a thousand years ago. And while I greatly admire the high qualifications of 'Abd al-K\u00e1dir as a recorder of events, I think that his statements taken alone are calculated to give generally a very erroneous impression of the character, and particularly of the motives which actuated the greatest Sovereign that has ever ruled the destinies of India, in many of the measures of his Government. Europeans are too apt, and Englishmen far more so, I fear, than people of other nationalities, to take a disparaging view of the character of all Asiatics, and especially of Asiatic Sovereigns; and although I freely admit that any comparison between the Government of India under British and Mohammadan rule would be absurd, I cannot but think that it is equally as absurd as it is unfair of those who love to make such comparisons, to make them with British rule as it is and not with British rule here or elsewhere as it was two hundred and eighty or three hundred years ago. Considerations of this nature induced me to recommend the publication of the Akbar-n\u00e1mah and portions of the \u1e6caba\u1e33\u00e1t-i-Akbar-Sh\u00e1hi along with the Muntakhab-i-Tav\u00e1r\u012bkh, as with both the eulogistic and the disparaging review of the character before it, the public would be in a position to form its own conclusions, or, in other words, to take the mean of the two extremes. And the same instruction I\nfancy was intended to be conveyed, though perhaps it is not quite so clearly expressed, by Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n, when he said in the preface to his history of Akb\u00e1r\u2019s times, \u201cIf any one wishes to record in detail the events of the fifty-one years of that Emperor whose good fortune was like unto that of Alexander the Great, the account would not be contained in one volume. Whoever wishes to be accurately informed regarding the affairs of that world-conquering Khusrau, he should attentively read the Akbar-n\u00e1mah and the T\u00e1rikh-i-Bad\u00e1oni of \u2019Abd al-K\u00e1dir.\u201d Further on, in regard to this author, he says:\n\n\u201c\u2019Abd al-K\u00e1dir, the compiler of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Bad\u00e1oni, who was long one of the confidential courtiers, the Chaplain Royal, and one of the special councillors in attendance on the Emperor, in common with other learned men of the time, differed openly regarding the tenets of the faith from Shaikh Faiz\u00ed and Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl, the sons of Shaikh Mub\u00e1arak, who were special courtiers and in the secret confidence of the Emperor. He consequently imputed to the two brothers, and to those of their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who had access to the Emperor, many acts contrary to the tenets of Isl\u00e1m. Similarly he has said many things regarding the Emperor himself which are quite incredible, and which it would be improper to repeat or commit to writing. Indeed, if I should retail one hundredth part of them it would be disrespectful (to his memory); nevertheless, \u2018by repeating the heretical sayings of others one does not himself become a heretic.\u2019 I extract some passages from the work of \u2019Abd al-K\u00e1dir, etc., etc.\u201d\n\nThere is no question, however, of the great value of \u2019Abd\n\n---\n\n1 In another copy of Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n, which differs materially from the copy from which the above extract is made, it is stated that, \u201cSome of these passages having been brought to the notice of the Emperor Jeh\u00e1ngir, he ordered \u2019Abd al-K\u00e1dir\u2019s son to be imprisoned, and his house to be plundered. He further took an agreement from the booksellers of the capital that they would not sell the book; nevertheless this book was found in their shops in greater numbers than any other. In consequence, however, of the well-known anger of the Emperor on the subject, Ferishtah and M\u00edr al-H\u00e1kk, the compiler of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Zubdah and another (?), who were the three contemporary authors at the commencement of Jeh\u00e1ngir\u2019s reign, made no mention whatever of this matter. But since the writer of this history, having nothing to do with princes and wazirs, has no occasion to suppress the truth, and since a person by repeating the heretical sayings of others does not himself become a heretic, such extracts as with much research he has collected from Bad\u00e1oni and others he has written down.\u201d The same story is told by the author of the Mir\u00e1t ul-\u00c1lam with this difference, that he says nothing about \u2019Abd al-K\u00e1dir\u2019s son being imprisoned or his house pillaged. He simply states that the Emperor sent for his descendants (Aul\u00e1d) and took an agreement from them, etc.\nal-K\u00e1dir's work for the history of this period, and Kh\u00e1f\u00ed Kh\u00e1n admits it; but while he states that the author of the *Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbari* is not so correct in his account of the affairs of the Deccan, he seems to think that his history of the life and times of Akbar, as far as it goes, is the most accurate; and as his opinion on a point of this nature is important to the future historian, I quote his remarks:\n\n\"Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn Haraw\u00ed, who was in the Paymaster General's department of Akbar's government, wrote a history containing an account of the Kings of the twenty-one Subahs of the Deccan, called the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1mi*. Generally his account of the kings of the Deccan is not to be trusted; and with the exception of Mohammad K\u00e1sim Firishtah, no writer has compiled a history of the kings of the Deccan which can be fully credited. But since Niz\u00e1m ud-d\u00edn spent his life in the service of the Emperor Akbar, his history in all that relates to the reign of that sovereign can be implicitly relied upon.\"\u00b9\n\nAs Sir H. Elliot has given very copious extracts from 'Abd al-K\u00e1dir's work, it is unnecessary to allude to it further. The work is divided into three parts\u2014the first containing the history of Ghaznin and Hindustan from the times of Subuktag\u00edn to Hum\u00e1y\u00fan; the second is devoted to the reign of Akbar up to the 40th year; and the third to notices of the learned men and poets who flourished in his time. The first portion of his work,\u2014which, excepting the addition of some verses, is simply an abridgement of the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1mi*, and not free from the defects attributable to all reproductions in manuscript,\u2014it was not originally intended to publish at present. With a view, however, to meet the wishes of the native community, it has been put in the press, and will appear in two or three months. The second part has already been printed, and the third will follow in due course.\n\nWith the *Akbar-n\u00e1mah*,\u00b2 the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Niz\u00e1mi* or *Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbari*, the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Firishtah*, and the *T\u00e1rikh-i-Bad\u00e1oni*, not to mention the works of later authors, such as the\n\n\u00b9 This is a proverbial saying with Moslims.\n\u00b2 This work has been translated into English, but the translation has never been published, and I cannot say how it has been done. Elphinstone has used it.\nKhul\u00e1\u00e7at ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh (apud the Siyar-al Mutaakhh\u00e1r\u00edn), Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n, etc., etc., the materials for the history of India for the reign of Akbar will be as complete as it is possible to make them.\n\nFor no other period of the history of India, anterior or subsequent, can we expect to find such perfect and complete materials as for the reign of Akbar; while, in some instances, the period subsequent to Akbar is, if possible, more difficult of illustration than that which preceded it. For illustrating the reign of his son, the Emperor Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, I had suggested, and the Council of the Asiatic Society had approved and accepted, the Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr-n\u00e1mah, or autobiography of this monarch, and the Ik\u00e1b\u00e1l-n\u00e1mah; but before we could put our design in practice, the Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr-n\u00e1mah had been published in India by a native gentleman.\u00b9 This freed the Society from half their obligation, and the Ik\u00e1b\u00e1l-n\u00e1mah of Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u00e1n only was published. Some discussions arose regarding the merits of this work; but they were very conclusively disposed of by a \"note\" of mine, read at the July meeting of the Society in 1865. No writer of the period was more competent or more favourably circumstanced for writing a history of the reign of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr than Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u00e1n. He was his amanuensis, and a large, if not the greater portion of the Emperor\u2019s memoir was written by him. He would seem, moreover, to have been in the confidence of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, for the Emperor, at the point of his memoirs when he ceased to record the events of his life, says:\n\n\"By reason of the weakness which for two years I have experienced, and which still afflicts me, my brain and heart did not support me in drafting the events and occurrences [of my life]. About this time Mu\u2019tamad Kh\u00e1n returned from service in the Deccan, and had the good fortune to make his obeisance, and since he was one of those servants who best understood my temper, and one of my most intelligent pupils, and, in addition, had formerly been employed in the performance of this service, and the recording of these events\n\n\u00b9 I stated at a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal that this work was published by a native Society, but the whole credit is due to Sayyid Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, of Alighur. The work was edited, printed, and published at his own expense.\nappertained to the duties of his office, I gave him my commands that, from the date up to which I had written (my memoirs), he should continue them, and add to them my draft; and whatever occurrences should take place subsequently, these he should enter in a diary, which, having submitted to me for correction, he should afterwards write out fairly.\"\n\nThis passage is sufficient, I think, to define the position of the author of the *Ikb\u00e1l-n\u00e1mah-i-Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr\u012b*, both as to his qualifications and the resources at his disposal for compiling a history of the reign of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr. Regarding the autobiography, however, questions have been raised which have afforded a field for discussion for the last seventy or eighty years, or since Mr. James Anderson first translated some extracts from it in the \"Asiatic Miscellany,\" in 1785. In 1788 Gladwin published other portions of the work in his History of Hindustan, and in 1829 Major Price published, in the series of the Oriental Translation Fund, the translation of a work which he entitled \"The Memoirs of the Emperor Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, written by himself,\" and which the critical Baron de Sacy at once detected to be a different work to that which Anderson and Gladwin had made use of. Further investigations of the subject by Mr. Morley, when engaged on the preparation of his Catalogue of the MSS. of the Royal Asiatic Society (1850-54), led to the discovery of two texts of the \"Memoirs.\" Several later authors quote the *Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr-n\u00e1mah*; but their quotations do not help the solution of the difficulty as to the identification of the Emperor's own edition of the work called his autobiography; but rather point to the conclusion that there were more than two editions of the work. I myself have seen four that differ so widely as to warrant the supposition that they are distinct editions, if not separate works. It may be mentioned, and the fact is interesting, that, after the Emperor had completed the record of twelve years of his reign, he distributed copies of the book to the members of his family, and his principal officers of State; as was done by Her Majesty the Queen with the early life of the late Prince Consort. The passage in which this is\nrecorded is placed at the end of the history of the twelfth year, and is as follows:\n\n\"I ordered that this twelve years' Record should be bound up in a volume and several copies made of it; that I should present it to my confidential servants, and send it to all the Provinces of the Empire, so that the great officers of the State and my trusty servants should make it the rule of their conduct.\"\n\nThe *Ikb\u00e1l-n\u00e1mah-i-Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr* has been published, and this History and the *Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr-n\u00e1mah* seem to have afforded the basis of the accounts given of this Emperor's reign by subsequent historians. The *Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr-n\u00e1mah* is doubtless open to the objection to all autobiographies, and they will apply with almost equal force to the *Ikb\u00e1l-n\u00e1mah*, because the relationship of the author was that of private or literary secretary. But M\u00edrza K\u00e1mg\u00e1r, who wrote in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n, three years after the death of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, has transferred a great portion of the *Ikb\u00e1l-n\u00e1mah* to his pages, the first portion indeed being copied verbatim from it. Kh\u00e1f\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, while giving praise to Mu'tamad Kh\u00e1n, reasonably objects that he and other contemporary historians were precluded by the circumstances of their position from being so free and outspoken on certain points as the independent and truthful historian ought to be; and as the future historian should be guarded on these points, I quote the passage:\n\n\"Let it not be concealed from the intelligent that Muhammad K\u00e1sim Ferishtah, and other historians who were contemporary with the Emperor, out of consideration and regard for his Majesty, were content with slightly glancing at his rebellion when a prince; and did not enter into detail on the subject. But M\u00edrza K\u00e1mg\u00e1r, who was entitled Ghairat Kh\u00e1n, the nephew of Ham\u00edd Ullah Kh\u00e1n, who wrote a history of the life of Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr, and who has been less guarded in concealing the truth than Mu'tamad Kh\u00e1n, has mentioned something about the rebellion of Prince Sal\u00edm (Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr).\"\n\n1 I'm not certain whether this author is K\u00e1mg\u00e1r Husain\u00ed, the author of the *Mad\u00edsir-i-Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr*, or not. If not, both the book mentioned by Kh\u00e1f\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, viz., the *Jehang\u00edr-n\u00e1mah*, and the author, are new to me. Possibly the four *Jehang\u00edr-n\u00e1mahs* purporting to be from the pen of the Emperor, are by different amanuenses. One copy I have seen is styled the *Sal\u00edm-Sh\u00e1hi* on the fly-leaf.\nThere are other special works in which something of the history of this reign may be found; the *Haft-Fath-i-Kangr\u00e1*, *Bai\u00e1dh-i-Jeh\u00e1ngiri* and the *Tuhfat-ush-Sh\u00e1h-i-Jeh\u00e1ngiri*. These are mentioned by Sir H. M. Elliot; and there are one or two other works quoted by Mohammadan historians, of which I find no mention. Kh\u00e1f\u00ed Kh\u00e1n gives extracts from the *Minh\u00e1j-u\u1e63-\u00c7ad\u00edk\u00edn*, by Mu\u1e25ammad \u00c7ad\u00edk-i-Tabr\u00edz\u00ed, and the author of the *Mir\u00e1t-i-Aft\u00e1b-num\u00e1*, who wrote in the times of Sh\u00e1h \u2019\u00c1l\u00e1n, quotes a work called the *M\u00e1k\u00e1l\u00e1t-i-Jeh\u00e1ngiri*, but by this latter I rather think the author means the \u201cMemoirs,\u201d to one of the editions of which he has perhaps given another name.\n\nFor the reign of the Emperor Sh\u00e1hjeh\u00e1n, the principal authorities are the *B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah* of \u2019Abd al-\u1e24am\u00edd-i-L\u00e1hor\u00ed and its continuation by Mu\u1e25ammad W\u00e1ris, and the *\u2019Amal-i-\u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh* of Mu\u1e25ammad \u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh. There are other works, but none of very great value. There is a copy, for example, in the Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s Library of the *Sh\u00e1h-Jeh\u00e1n-n\u00e1mah* by Mu\u1e25ammad T\u00e1hir, commonly called \u2019In\u00e1yat Kh\u00e1n, son of Zafar Kh\u00e1n, some time Waz\u00edr to Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr; but Mr. Morley says the author professes simply to have abridged the *B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah*. He adds that the style is simple; but the extract given by Major Price in his Catalogue is taken verbatim from \u2019Abd al-\u1e24am\u00edd\u2019s work.\n\nAnother *B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah*, by M\u00fansh\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad Am\u00edn is mentioned by Mu\u1e25ammad \u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh in the *\u2019Amal-i-\u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh*, a copy of which is also in the Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s Library. It only embraces, however, an account of the first ten years of the emperor\u2019s reign, and according to Mr. Morley contains nothing that is not to be found in \u2019Abd al-\u1e24am\u00edd\u2019s book. Elliot and others mention some other works, such as the *Mu\u1e33addima-i-B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah*, *La\u1e6d\u00e1iful-Akhb\u00e1r*, *T\u00e1rikh-i-Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1*, *Sh\u00e1h-Jeh\u00e1n-n\u00e1mah* of T\u00e1lib K\u00e1l\u00edm, *Ma\u00e1sir-i-Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n*, but contemporary and subsequent authors do not seem to have considered any of these histories of importance, or to have made any use of them. A copy of the *La\u1e6d\u00e1if ul-Akhb\u00e1r* is in the Bengal Asiatic Society\u2019s Library. (See also Stewart\u2019s Catalogue, No. 43.) It is devoted to an account of\nthe expedition of D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shakoh to the relief of Kandahar. There is a copy, or a portion of a copy, of a third B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah amongst the MSS. taken at Delhi, by Jal\u00e1l ud-d\u00edn Tab\u00e1tabai. It is styled the \"B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah-i-Sh\u00e1h-Jeh\u00e1n-i-ta\u1e63n\u012bf-i-ust\u00e1d ul \u2019A\u1e63r Maul\u00e1n\u00e1 Jal\u00e1l ud-d\u00edn Tab\u00e1tabai.\" The MS. begins abruptly with the fifth and concludes with the eighth year of the emperor\u2019s reign, and is written as if the author was contemporary with the events he chronicles. It contains 586 pages of seventeen lines, in a small and closely written hand; and to embrace the entire reign would extend to at least ten or twelve volumes. I find no mention of this history anywhere. \u2019Abd al-Ham\u00edd mentions amongst the doctors or learned men of this reign one Saiyid Jal\u00e1l, who was an author, an elegant writer, and a poet, and who had two or three interviews with the emperor; but there are no grounds to suppose that this apparently distinguished man is this author. I know of no histories then for this reign equal to the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah and its continuation, by W\u00e1ris Kh\u00e1n and the \u2019Amal-i-\u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh. All three authors were contemporary, though Mu\u1e25ammad \u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh was the youngest of the three. He speaks in the highest terms of the other two; and an equally good proof that, in selecting these works, no mistake has been made, is that Kh\u00e1f\u00ed Kh\u00e1n has followed the order of the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah as far as it goes, and seems to have based his history for the first twenty years of Sh\u00e1h-Jeh\u00e1n\u2019s reign almost entirely on this work. The greatest objection to the work is the author\u2019s style which is of that adulterated kind of Persian introduced into India apparently by the brothers Ab\u00fa\u2019l-Fazl and Faiz\u00ed.\n\nThe two parts of the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah of \u2019Abd al-Hamid have been printed, forming together two bulky volumes of 1662 pages 8vo.; but copies of the continuation of the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah, by W\u00e1ris Kh\u00e1n, have not been procured,\u2014so the publication is stopped for the present. The copy of the second part of the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1mah which has been used for this edition is the finest MS. I have ever seen. It is written by Mu\u1e25ammad \u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh Kamb\u00fa, the author of the \u2019Amal-i-\u00c7\u00e1l\u00edh, and bears on the margin the autograph of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h-Jeh\u00e1n.\nNext in order of the Mughal Emperors comes 'Ab\u00fal-Muzaffar Mu\u1e25\u00ed ud-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Aurangzeb '\u00c1lamg\u00edr. The special authorities for this monarch's reign are not numerous. Elliot mentions no less than fifteen; but most of them are of little value; some relate but remotely to history, and a few, as far as I know of, are not procurable anywhere. In the Royal Asiatic Society's Library are some papers (No. 133) relating to this reign, which may contain some materials of value, and also some general histories. One cause of the paucity of good materials for this reign is that the Emperor himself in the eleventh year of his reign issued strict injunctions that no one should write the record of his times. The reason for this injunction is attributed to a bigotry similar to that which caused the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, but it is not very plainly stated. It is more than probable that it is to be found in the fact that from this year dates the commencement of the disruption of the great empire Aurangzeb inherited from his father. The history of the reign of Aurangzeb is of singular importance for the British Government in India, and cannot be too fully elucidated, for in this reign the latest attempt was made to reorganize the Government and to re-settle the whole country. For this period I selected the '\u00c1lamg\u00edr-n\u00e1mah of M\u00fanshi Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00e1sim, the Ma\u00fas\u00edr-i '\u00c1lamg\u00edr\u00ed of Mu\u1e25ammad S\u00e1ki Musta'\u00edd Kh\u00e1n, and the latter half of the Muntakhab-i-Lub\u00e1b, commonly called the T\u00e1rikh-i-Kh\u00e1f\u00ed Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThese three works, I believe, will give a tolerably clear and comprehensive view of the history of the period, in spite of the Emperor's prohibition to write. The first is a Court Chronicle, and consequently open to the objections before alluded to. It was written by order of Aurangzeb himself. It comprises only ten years of his reign; but for that\n\n---\n\n1 *Makt\u00e1bat-i-Sult\u00e1n\u00ed*; *Roz-n\u00e1mah-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edri*; *'\u00c1lamg\u00edr-n\u00e1mah-i-'\u00c1kil Kh\u00e1n*; *'\u00c1lamg\u00edr-n\u00e1mah-i-Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00e1z\u00edm*; *T\u00e1rikh-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edr-i-Mir Hash\u00edm*; *Ma\u00fas\u00edr-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edr*; *T\u00e1rikh-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edr* 'Abd ul-H\u00e1d\u00ed; *Futuh\u00e1t-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edr*; *W\u00edk\u00e1y\u00e1-i-N\u00ed'\u00e1mat Kh\u00e1n 'Ali* (printed repeatedly); *T\u00e1rikh-i-Bindr\u00e1ban*; *Ruka'\u00e1t-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edr* (printed repeatedly); *T\u00e1rikh-i-Dilkushd\u00ed*; *T\u00e1rikh-i-Mulk-i-Asham* (printed at Calcutta); *W\u00e1k'\u00ed\u00e1t-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edr*; *Azam ul-Harab*?\n\n2 The Bengal Asiatic Society, I believe, proposes to publish the whole, as so much objection is raised by the natives to mutilated editions.\nperiod it is the most complete chronicle we have, though it was not commenced till the thirty-second year of Aurangzeb's reign. Subsequent authors do not express any very decided opinion upon the qualifications of Mu\u1e25ammad K\u0101sim as a historian. The author of the *Mir\u0101t ul-\u02bf\u0100lam*, however, speaks of him as an author of great erudition, the author of the *Ma\u02bf\u1e63ir-i-\u02bf\u0100lamgiri* has made an abridgement of his work the first portion of his history; and Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, the author of the *Khul\u0101\u1e63at ut-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh*, has made the *\u02bf\u0100lamgir-n\u0101mah* a chief authority. The *Ma\u02bf\u1e63ir-i-\u02bf\u0100lamgiri* is a small work, but the author had good opportunities of consulting the records of Government, and of obtaining information regarding the events of this reign. \u02bfAbd ur-Rahm\u0101n Bakht\u0101war Kh\u0101n (a eunuch), the distinguished author of the *Mir\u0101t ul-\u02bf\u0100lam*,\u00b9 was for about thirty years in the service of Aurangzeb, and when he died (1095 A.H.), was Controller of the Household or held some such office (*d\u0101roghah-i-khur\u0101c\u0101n*). Mu\u1e25ammad S\u0101k\u012b was his secretary or head-clerk (*muns\u012b-i-diw\u0101n*). After the death of Bakht\u0101war Kh\u0101n, some changes were made in the household, by which Mu\u1e25ammad S\u0101k\u012b was appointed keeper of the daily record (*i.e.* of the Emperor's proceedings). His book, therefore, short though it be, as also that portion of the *Mir\u0101t ul-\u02bf\u0100lam*, which treats of this reign, are valuable authorities for the period.\n\nBut the most comprehensive of these histories is the history of Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n. This history has been used freely by Elphinstone and other European historians, and is so well known that I might be excused from noticing it in detail; but my object, as before mentioned, is not to catalogue indiscriminately all the authorities for each particular epoch of the Mohammadan period which are extant; but rather to discriminate, if possible, between those authors who had good opportunities of acquiring information about the events they recorded whilst they were actually taking place, and of testing, by personal enquiries from eye-witnesses, the truth of\n\n\u00b9 This author also wrote a work which he entitled *Chah\u0101r X\u012bna*, giving an account of Aurangzeb's four great campaigns; and abridged the *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Alfi*, and the *Kauzat ul-A\u1e25b\u0101b*, and many other works, which are probably lost.\ncurrent reports, and those who were mere transcribers of what they found in the writing of others. Now Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n\u2019s history is a very important work. There can be no doubt that he was a historian of very great merit, and had singular capabilities for the task he undertook. He was contemporary moreover with Aurangzeb for the greater portion of his reign; and a story is current that he wrote his history during the lifetime of the Emperor, and concealed it until after his death. As far as I can ascertain, there is no truth whatever in this fable, but it has been put forth with so much apparent substantiality, that it is proper to notice it; as there can be no question that a record of events made at the time is of more value than one compiled from memory thirty or forty years after the events occurred, unless such record be supported by some documentary evidence. Mr. Morley, in his catalogue of the MSS. of the Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s Library (No. 98, page 100), says:\n\n\u201cThe author was of good family, and resided at Delhi in the latter part of Aurangzeb\u2019s reign; he composed his history during this period, but owing to the well-known prohibition of this monarch, he concealed his work, and, from some other causes, did not publish it till 1145 A.H. (1732 A.D.). The book was well received on its publication, and from the circumstances of it having been so long concealed (Kh\u00e1fi) the author received the title of Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n.\u201d\n\nMr. Morley would hardly make this statement without some authority, but he has not stated it. I think I have seen it somewhere else, and I have no doubt it had its origin in an imperfect and somewhat ludicrous misinterpretation of what Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n himself says, to which has consequently been given a sense the very opposite of its true meaning. Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n certainly says that he kept all these things locked up in a box; but it was the box of his \u201cmemory.\u201d The passage I allude to is as follows:\n\n\u201cAnd, whatsoever, after arriving at the years of intelligence and perception, I had for thirty or forty years seen with my own eyes, and laid up in the strong box of my\n\n1 See also Note 3, p. 125.\nmemory, that I have written. And since I heard that Bindr\u00e1ban D\u00e1s Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h\u00ed, who was long a Muta\u1e63addi of Sh\u00e1h \u2019\u00c1lam during the time he was a prince, had compiled a history, and had included in it an account of upwards of thirty years, being exceedingly anxious to see it, I made great search for it. Subsequently when, after great trouble, I obtained a copy, and examined it carefully from beginning to end, in the hope that I might gather the rich fruits of his labours, I discovered that his work did not contain one half of what I had included in my own history.\u201d\n\nThere might be some apparent reason for Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n concealing his work for a year or two after the death of Aurangzeb; but there seems no sound nor apparent reason for his concealing his work for nearly thirty years after that event. If such an assertion can with truth be made of any historian of the period, whose work is extant, it is of the author of the Ma\u0101sir-i-\u2019\u00c1lamgiri, Musta\u2019id Kh\u00e1n. Of him Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n says\u2014and his statement affords pretty good proof of the correctness of my opinion\u2014\n\n\u201cAfter the expiration of ten years authors were forbidden from writing the events of that just and righteous Emperor\u2019s reign; nevertheless some competent persons [did so], and particularly Musta\u2019id Kh\u00e1n, who secretly wrote an abridged account of the campaign in the Deccan, simply detailing the conquests of the countries and forts without alluding at all to the misfortunes of the campaign [and Bindr\u00e1ban, who wrote an abridged account of the events of some years of the second and third decades]. I have neither seen nor obtained any history that contains a full and detailed account of the forty remaining years of this reign. Consequently, from the eleventh to the twenty-first year (22nd) of the Emperor\u2019s reign, I have not been able to relate the events in the order in which they occurred, giving the month and year; but after this year, with very great labour and pains, I collected information from the papers in the public offices, and by enquiry made from truthful persons, the confidential and old servants of the Emperor and old eunuchs, and what-\n\n1 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062f\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e \u062d\u064f\u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u064a\u0650\u0632\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e\u0646\u064e \u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\u062a\u0650 \u0633\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0651 \u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0633\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u06cc\u0650\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629 \u0646\u0645\u0648\u0630\u062c \u0628\u0635\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0642 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0633\u0631\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0642\u064a\u062a \u0642\u0644\u0645 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\nsoever, etc., I saw with my own eyes, I laid up in the strong box,\u201d etc., etc. (Vide supra).\u00b9\n\nI would here observe that in editing the T\u00e1rikh of Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n considerable difficulty will be experienced. Copies are very numerous; but, strange to say, no two copies that I have met with\u2014and I have compared five apparently very good MSS.\u2014are exactly alike, while some present such dissimilarities as almost to warrant the supposition that they are distinct works, some passages being quite accurate and others again entirely dissimilar. In the copies to be found of Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl's A'in-i-Akbar\u00ed and other well known MSS., which have been copied and re-copied repeatedly, we find omissions, and a variety of readings, but not such broadcast discrepancies as I have found in some of the copies of Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n which I have consulted. From this cause and the general ignorance and carelessness of the\n\n\u00b9 This passage is confused; but I think I have given the author's meaning. The passage is as follows:\n\nThe passage between brackets is in two of the copies I have consulted, but not in a third, nor in the copy of this extract given in the Siyar al-Mutaakhhkarin, which differs from all three in many respects. The word \u062c\u0644\u0633\u0648 for \u0647\u062c\u0631\u06cc occurs in three copies. Kh\u00e1fi is a patronymic from Khw\u00e1fi, a district near Nish\u00e1p\u00far; the author's name was H\u00e1shim 'Ali Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1fi. The patronymic is a very common one about this period, as Khw\u00e1jah-i-Jih\u00e1n Khw\u00e1fi; Saiyid Amir Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1fi; Shaikh Mir Kh\u00e1fi; Cal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n Khw\u00e1jah Mir Khw\u00e1fi, etc. Authors write Kh\u00e1fi and Khw\u00e1fi indiscriminately.\ncompilers of the only catalogue there is of the MSS. in the valuable library of the Bengal Asiatic Society, two copies of portions of Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n (Nos. 181 and 382) have been styled the Tav\u00e1r\u00edkh-i-B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h\u00e1n\u00ed-Hind wa Dakhan, and the T\u00e1rikh-i-'A'lamg\u00edr\u00ed.\n\nIt is proper also to mention another work as an authority to be consulted for the history of this period, as the author stands on the same footing with Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n as a contemporary historian. With limited funds, however, the publication of the one history must suffice. I allude to the Tazkirat-us-Sal\u00e1t\u00edn-i-Chaghat\u00e1 of Mu\u1e25ammad H\u00e1d\u00ed, styled K\u00e1mw\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n.\n\nI do not know the exact limits of the period within which this author flourished; but it is evident that he was contemporary with Aurangzeb for a considerable portion of his reign, and, for some portion of the time at least, had good opportunities of obtaining accurate information. I find that in the forty-fifth year of this reign he went in company with the Paymaster-General Kif\u00e1yat Kh\u00e1n bin Arshad Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1fi to Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d; and as he has brought down his history only to the sixth year of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h\u2019s reign or A.H. 1136,\u00b9 and Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n has continued his to the fourteenth year of the same reign, or 1144 A.H., we may conclude that K\u00e1mw\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n was not the later of the two. He opens his history modestly, stating that he commenced it after he had completed the compilation of the Haft Gulshan, which treats of the Kings of Delhi, Bengal, M\u00e1lwa, Dakhan, Mult\u00e1n, Thathah, Kashm\u00edr, and the other provinces of Hindustan; and after stating that he commenced this work, the history of the life of Taim\u00far, he continues:\n\n\"I humbly crave the students of history, regardless of the impropriety of the words I have used or the want of elegance in my style, to take into their consideration, and do me the justice to remember, that without any royal order, and without the aid or assistance of any of the nobles of the times, which in an undertaking of this\n\n\u00b9 So far the Bengal Asiatic Society\u2019s copy. Mr. Morley says, the Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s copy is continued for another year; and I think the Bengal Asiatic Society\u2019s wants a page, though the loss has been ingeniously repaired.\nimportant nature is very necessary, how many nights I have turned into days and vice versa, and what anxiety of mind I have suffered, in communicating the information contained in this history in a new form.\"\n\nThe author was appointed Controller of the Household of Prince Mu\u1e25ammad Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and received an increase of pay and the title of K\u0101mw\u0101r Kh\u0101n in the second year of the reign of Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h Sh\u0101h \u2019\u0100lam; and he received a Khilat from the king the following year. He was in a position then to know what was going on; and the apparently straightforward manner in which he has written his history inspires the confidence of the reader.\n\nThere is another history with a very similar name, which compiled about the same time, viz., the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Chaghat\u0101i, by Mu\u1e25ammad Shaf\u012b\u2019-i-Tahr\u0101n\u012b whose poetical sobriquet was W\u0101rid. The book is in one volume, and that not very large (668 pages, royal 8vo. 15 lines to a page of large Nastal\u012bk). It is a very elegant composition, and the record for about twenty or thirty years may be considered that of a contemporary writer. The author says:\n\n\"From the year 1100 A.H., the greater portion of what I have recorded I have myself seen, and that which I heard from trustworthy persons I took the utmost pains in sifting and inquiring into, and whatever statements I had the slightest doubt about I discarded. But from the commencement of the war of the late Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad \u2019Azam, up to the present time, or for twenty-two years, I have seen everything with my own eyes.\"\n\nHe closes his work with the following statement:\u2014\n\n\"In short, after the departure of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, a Royal order was issued by Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h to the following effect: \u2018All public officers should occupy themselves in the discharge of their ordinary duties, except the historians. These should refrain from recording the events of my reign, for at present the record cannot be a pleasant one. The reins of Imperial or Supreme Government have fallen from my hands. I am now the Viceroy of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h\u2019; and notwithstanding that, the nobles and great officers of the Court, hearing these melancholy reflections of the Emperor, in many complimentary and flattering speeches recommend him to withdraw this order. His Majesty would not be satisfied. Conse-\nquently, being helpless, all the historians obeyed the royal mandate and laid down their pens.\"\n\nI mention this work as, in consequence of the title, it might be mistaken for the *Tazkirah-i-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bni-Chaghat\u0101i*, which is much better known. Elliot, I observe, mentions it amongst the general histories of the House of Taim\u016br, but as he has not mentioned the *Tazkirah* at all, I assume that that is the work he means. The *Ma\u02bf\u1e63ir ul-Umar\u0101*, by Sams\u00e1m-ud-Daulah Sh\u0101h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n (the later edition by his son \u2019Abd al-Haij\u012b) affords some valuable information; but this, and latter portions of the *Tazkirat us-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn-i-Chaghat\u0101i*, the *T\u0101rikh-i-Chaghat\u0101i*, and the *T\u0101rikh-i-Kh\u0101fi Kh\u00e1n*, belong to a later period. Kh\u0101fi Kh\u00e1n brings his history down to the fourteenth year of the reign of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, 1144 A.H. (A.D. 1731), so that his history gives us a contemporary record of the history of the reigns of seven kings after Aurangzeb, viz., \u2019Azam Sh\u0101h, Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h, Sh\u0101h \u2019\u0100lam, (\u2019Azim ush-Sh\u0101n), Jih\u00e1nd\u0101r Sh\u0101h, Mu\u1e25ammad Farrukh Siyar, Raffi ud-Daraj\u0101t, Raffi ud-Daulat, Raushan Akhtar, commonly called Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h (fourteen years). For the period subsequent to this, I have as yet taken no thought; and I fear it will not be very easy to add many very valuable works. Sir Henry Elliot gives a very long list of histories, but most of them are of little value.\n\nThe historians, however, which have been mentioned as completed, and in course of completion, will give as good an account of the reigns of the following sovereigns as can well be obtained from any materials likely to be procured elsewhere, viz.:\n\nXXXII.

He ascended the throne on the 10th Zi-l-hijjah, A.H. 1118, and was killed in battle 18th Rab\u012b\u2019 ul-Awwal, A.H. 1119.\nXXXVI. \u1e32utb ud-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Mu\u2019azzam Sh\u00e1h \u2019\u00c1lam Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h.\n\nXXXVII.

He ascended the throne on the 19th Mu\u1e25arram, and was drowned on the 19th Safar, A.H. 1124.\nIn addition to the above works, there are available for the purposes of the future historian of India other works which have been published in India and in Europe, many of which I have mentioned in this paper: in the T\u00e1rikh-i-Yamini, or Life of Mahm\u00fad of Ghaznin, in Arabic, by Al-'Otib\u00ed, lithographed at Delhi; the Travels of Ibn But\u00fatah, published in Arabic, with a translation in French, by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique of Paris; the T\u00e1rikh-i-Tim\u00fari, or Life of T\u00edm\u00far Lang, in Arabic, by Ibn 'Arabsh\u00e1h (Calcutta, 1818); the Akbar N\u00e1mah of Ab\u00fa'l-Fazl (Lucknow, 1867); the T\u00e1rikh-i-Firishtah (Bombay, 1832, and translations by Briggs, Dow, and Scott); Mir\u00e1t-i-Ishandar\u00ed, or an account of the Kings of Guzerat, by Mu\u1e25ammad Iskandar, (Bombay, 1831); the Hab\u00edb us-Siyar (Bombay, 1857); Rauzat u\u1e63-\u1e62af\u00e1 (Bombay, 1848); Tuzak-i-Jeh\u00e1ng\u00edr\u00ed (Allyghur, 1865); Wik\u00e1y\u00e1-i-N\u00edmat Kh\u00e1n 'Ali (class book in schools); T\u00e1rikh-i-A'sh\u00e1m (Calcutta, 1849); T\u00e1rikh-i-N\u00e1dir\u00ed (Bengal Asiatic Society, 1845); Durra-i-N\u00e1dir\u00ed (Bombay, 1863); Siyar ul Mutaakkhkhar\u00edn (Calcutta, 1836); Im\u00e1d us Sa'\u00e1dat (Lucknow, lately printed, no date); Gul\u00edst\u00e1n-i-Ruhmat; Zuldat ul-Tav\u00e1r\u00edkh, in Urd\u00fa (Calcutta,); Karnama-i-Haidari; George-n\u00e1mah, or account of the Conquest of India by the English, from the earliest times, in heroic verse (Bombay, 1837).\n\nDoubtless some other works have been printed which I have not got, and which I do not recollect at present; leaving them, however, out of the question we have here a large number of texts containing a vast amount of valuable information regarding the history and people of India, which, if it has been rescued from the dangers incidental to a manuscript literature is still as much a sealed book to the English public as it was before. These books may remain for years on the shelves of the Bengal Asiatic Society's Library, and no one, with the exception of the few German Oriental scholars who make Oriental languages the study or the recreation of their lives, will know any more of them than if\n\n---\n\n1 I have no copy of this work to refer to. It contains the history of H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, and an account of his war with Subad\u00e1r of Oudh, assisted by the English, in 1774. The last two or three works all relate to the history of modern times.\nthey never had been printed. Many of these works, and especially those printed and published by natives of India, may go out of print and be lost. Looking to the supercession of the native classical languages in India by the English language, and the gradual disappearance of men brought up in that school in which Oriental literature was appreciated and cultivated for its own sake, there is little chance of any of them being reprinted.\n\nIt seems to me, then, that unless some measure be adopted to secure English translations of these works, our labour will in great part be lost. The books, it is true, will be available for the Orientalist, and will occasionally be dipped into by savans to illustrate papers written for literary and scientific journals; but Orientalists are not often historians, and the chief end aimed at in these publications will not be attained. Many of these works are ably written, and most of them contain much that would be read with interest even by the general reader in England if it were available in a European language. But how, by whom, or under whose auspices, are these translations to be made? The \"Oriental Translation Fund,\" which for so many years supplied Orientalists throughout Europe with the means of publishing the Oriental works they translated, and which has bequeathed to posterity such noble monuments of its usefulness, has expired, and I am told for want of support.\u00b9 Much has been done certainly to render the literary treasures of the East more accessible to European scholars, but the mine is by no means exhausted; and it seems to me strange indeed that the more familiar the English become with India and the East the less they seem disposed to drink deep at that fountain of knowledge a draught from which is absolutely necessary to a thorough understanding of the people. But if the Oriental Fund has ceased to exist, there must be very many in England still who are deeply interested in bridging the gulf of ignorance which divides the sympathies of the races which are brought in contact on the plains of India. I cannot but believe that they would sup-\n\n\u00b9 [The unfinished translations of Ibn Khalikan and Tabari are still in course of publication.\u2014Ed.]\nport a fund formed to co-operate with the Asiatic Society of Bengal in this good work; and what learned Society more competent or more fit to inaugurate such a movement than the Royal Asiatic Society? Competent Oriental scholars now-a-days are more plentiful in Europe than in India; the greater portion of the texts which are published in the Bibliotheca Indica are edited by natives. All Europeans in India, moreover, are overworked; and consequently the few who have the ability have not the leisure to make translations from Persian works. Even the abstracts of the works which the rules of the Society require, have never been written; and if the public look to India for translations, it may be centuries before they see them. If the Royal Asiatic Society, then, would entertain the proposition, and undertake the translation of all the works which are published in the Bibliotheca, much profit would be gained.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nMr. Hammond has drawn up the subjoined memorandum of the works adverted to in note, page 419, supra.\u2014Ed.\n\nIn 1855 the late Mr. Colvin, then Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces of India, at the suggestion of Mr. Edward Thomas, of the Bengal Civil Service, entrusted to me the task of collecting and collating MSS. of the Mohammedan Historians of India, in continuation of the late Sir Henry Elliot\u2019s work.\n\nAccordingly the following MSS. were purchased or borrowed by me:\n\n| Title                                      | Number of MSS. |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1h\u00ed of Z\u00ed\u00e1 Barn\u00ed           | 6              |\n| T\u00e1rikh-i-F\u00edroz-Sh\u00e1h\u00ed of Shams Sir\u00e1j \u2019Aff\u00ed   | 3              |\n| Ikb\u00e1l-n\u00e1mah-i-Jih\u00e1ng\u00edr\u00ed of I\u2019tim\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n    | 6              |\n| T\u00fazak-i-Jih\u00e1ng\u00edr\u00ed, by the Emperor Jih\u00e1ng\u00edr | 3              |\n| Ma\u00e1s\u00edr-i-Jih\u00e1ng\u00edr\u00ed, of Hasn\u00ed                | 1              |\n| Siyar al-Mutaakkhar\u00edn                      | 3              |\n| T\u00e1rikh-i-Ferishtah                          | 3              |\n| Khal\u00e1\u00e7at ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh                       | 2              |\nZubdat ut-Taw\u00e1\u0159\u00edkh of M\u00edr al-Ha\u1e33\u1e33, from Mu\u2019izz ud-d\u00edn to Akbar .......................................................... 1 MSS.\nZubdat ut-Taw\u00e1\u0159\u00edkh of \u2019Abd al-Kar\u00edm, from Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h to E.I.

He disappeared during the mutinies, and I never could ascertain any particulars regarding his fate. In collating the MSS. he was assisted by two competent Moonsh\u00eds. One copy of Z\u00ed\u00e1 Barn\u00ed\u2019s history, belonging to Sayyid A\u1e25mad, was\nprepared for press, and (I believe) formed the basis of the text lately printed from in Calcutta. This and one other MS. of Zia Barni alone escaped. All the others were placed by me in a strong chest on leaving India in 1856, and were deposited in the Record Office of the Board of Revenue at Agra, which edifice was burnt during the mutinies. There were in the same box some MSS. of Arabic and Persian Dictionaries.\n\nThe MSS. of Shams-i-Siraj 'Aff's history were also collated, and some others commenced upon. I defrayed from my private means all expenses of collection or collation of the MSS. herein referred to. I have no idea whether any grant for purposes of publication was subsequently made by the Government of India.\n\nH. W. Hammond,\nLate Bengal C.S.\n\nPriston, 27th July, 1868.\nART. XIII.\u2014A few words concerning the Hill People inhabiting the Forests of the Cochin State. By Capt. G. E. Fryer, Madras Staff Corps, M.R.A.S.\n\n[Read March 30, 1868.]\n\nThe hill people, regarding whom I purpose saying a few words, inhabit the hill tracts of the States of Travancore and Cochin, and the base of the Annamully hills in the district of Coimbatore. They go by different names in different localities, such as Kardars, Mulliyars, Vaisharvars, Kannekarens, all of which signify \"foresters,\" and they are also called Mulchers or outcasts, which is probably a corruption of the Sanskrit word \u092e\u0932\u094d\u0939 Mlechchha, meaning a barbarian or outcast.\n\nBut although they are regarded as outcasts by the inhabitants of the plain, they by no means consider themselves as inferior to them, for they address every one by \"thou,\" which, as in German, is only used by superiors to inferiors or by equals.\n\nThey are of true aboriginal type, distinct in appearance and manners from the fairer population of the plains. They are exceedingly small in stature, though not disproportionately so, having lithe and active frames capable of enduring great exposure and fatigue.\n\nThey are very wild and indolent, ignorant of agriculture, subsisting on such jungle produce as arrowroot, berries, honey, and are subject to all the privations of a savage life. A small rude knife is their only implement. They use bows and arrows, but they have neither bill-hook, hoe, nor any other native tool, however rude. Their conceptions of the deity are of the vaguest description. They possess no letters. Their dialect, which is a broken Malayalam, is simply colloquial.\nNevertheless they exhibit many nice traits of character. They are gentle to their wives and children, faithful to their conjugal vows, rarely (excepting upon good grounds, such as proved barrenness, or manifest infidelity) marrying more than one wife, or more than once, unless death occurs. Mr. Kohlhoff, late Conservator of Forests in the Cochin State, to whose kindness I am indebted for the statistics contained in Statement A., informed me that widows of any age frequently marry men younger than themselves, and he quoted the case of a young man having married a buxom widow of forty with five children to boot. As regards gentleness in their domestic relations, then, these people resemble the Bodo and Dhimal tribes in Sikkim, who are stated by Mr. Hodgson to be \"good husbands, good fathers, and not bad sons;\" but beyond this they do not bear out Mr. Hodgson's conclusion that \"those who are virtuous in these most influential relations are little likely to be vicious in less influential ones,\" for in 1856 the Collector of Coimbatore informed the Madras Government that their propensities for highway robbery were so strong that they were \"becoming a terror and nuisance\" in that district.\n\nTheir collections of hill produce consist chiefly of cardamoms, soapnut, ginger, honey, wax, deer's horns, ivory, and dammer. They are also employed by Government and timber merchants to point and mark valuable trees for timber.\n\nThey neither value nor care for money. On shooting excursions, when employed as beaters, remuneration is given to them in the shape of bundles of dried tobacco, pan supari, rice, etc. They are excessively fond of spirituous liquors.\n\nWhether being accustomed from earliest infancy to the pestilent vapours which surround their dwellings, or whether the inspissated juices of the roots they use in any way protect them from the morbific influences of malaria, it is a well-known fact that these hill people are capable of wholly withstanding the effects of the frequent changes of temperature and of the heavy mists at night which prove so fatal to other people. Moreover they assert that the climate\nof the open plains gives them fever. Small-pox is the chief disease among them and commits the greatest havoc. They do not practise infanticide.\n\nThe marriage ceremony is a very simple affair. When a damsel is sought in marriage the circumstance is made known to the head of the clan, who merely delivers over the maiden to the man, and the ceremony closes with feasting and rejoicings. They bury their dead. Their square huts are constructed of bamboo uprights and cross-posts with a grass roof and walls of bamboo matting.\n\nStatement A. gives the measurements and weight of ten adult male Mulchers, the first six of whom appear in the accompanying wood-cut. I can testify to the accuracy of the figures, for they were recorded by the late Mr. Kohlhoff, in the presence of the late Captain Barwise and Lieutenant (now Captain) Beauchamp of the 45th M.N.I.\n\nAssuming that the mean stature of the male at the time of maturity is 5ft. 8in. English measure, we find the tallest among the ten to be $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches short of it.\\(^1\\)\n\nAs regards girth round the chest, Koongen, the tallest, at $65\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, has only a girth of 31 inches, while for infantry recruits at 65 inches the chest measurement is 33 inches.\n\nIn No. VII. of the Madras Quart. Jour. Med. Soc. 1862. Dr. Shortt gives some interesting comparative tables of measurement between individuals of races of the plains and two hill tribes of Orissa. In Statement B. I have used his figures and added, by way of extending the comparison, the average measurement of the English recruit and that of the ten Mulchers. Excluding the English recruit, then, we note that the Brahmin weighs heaviest and is larger round the head. The Hindoo is larger round the neck, and, though taller, has the same chest girth as the Pathna. The Pathna has the thickest thigh and arm, though only 61.30 inches high. The half-savage Mulcher, on the other hand, is conspicuous only for general diminutiveness.\n\n\\(^1\\) It should be borne in mind that the height of a skeleton is less than that of the individual during life by about one inch.\nJudging from the photographs, Professor Huxley detects in these people a striking resemblance to the aboriginal Australians. They have the same contour, the beetle brow, the smooth black shining hair; in fact, he says, divest them of their clothing and the Australian is before you.\n\nI might here refer to Dr. Shortt's \"account of some rude tribes, the supposed aborigines of Southern India,\" Trans. Ethnol. Soc., vol. iii. p. 373. These are Yenadies, Villees, Iroolers, and Dombers. He gives the measurements of twenty-five men and twenty-five women of the first, fourteen male Villees, nine male Dombers and three females. He has omitted to calculate averages, but they are as follows:\u2014Yenadies, males, 64\u00b78, females, 54\u00b76; Villees, males, 65\u00b75; Dombers, males, 66\u00b75, females, 61. General averages, males, 65\u00b76; females, 57\u00b78. In another paper, \"A contribution to the Ethmol. of Jeypore,\" Ethnol.

XIV.\u2014Notes on the Bhojpuri Dialect of Hindi, spoken in Western Behar. By John Beames, Esq., B.C.S., Magistrate of Chumparun.\n\n[Read February 17, 1867.]\n\nThe Bhojpuri dialect is spoken in the British districts of Chumparun, Sarun, Shahabad, Ghazipoor, Azingurh, and Goruckpore, by a population which probably amounts to five millions. It is not, of course, the same in all these districts; but through all its variations it preserves the same general features, such as the use of the substantive verb bh\u00e1 or b\u00e1, the perfect in il, and other points of difference from the classical or literary type of Hind\u00ed. It is largely used as a written medium of communication by native merchants, and in all the transactions of the rural population, such as village accounts, leases, receipts, and so forth. The character is a variation of the Devan\u00e1gari, formed by omitting the horizontal top line, and is strikingly similar to the Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed character, so much so that a work printed in that language can be read by a native of Chumparun. In the following remarks, however, I shall use the Devan\u00e1gari character as more generally understood in Europe.\n\nIt is expected of one who writes on the modern Indian dialects that he should trace the origin of the forms from Sanskrit through the Prakrit, and I shall endeavour as far as I can to do this; but it must be remembered that the subject of Prakrit is involved in much obscurity, and that in India the difficulty of procuring books is very considerable. The greater part of the literary treasures of India is now in London and other European capitals; and we are constantly, in our search for manuscripts and copies of celebrated works, told by natives that they are not now to be procured. As an instance of this, I lately endeavoured to obtain a copy of the whole or part of the Prithi Raja Rasa of Chand. After vainly inquiring in Calcutta, Benares, and other large\ncities, I found that only one manuscript was known to be in existence in the whole of the Bengal Presidency, and that was in the Library of St. John's College at Agra. Whereas, therefore, we in India possess an advantage over scholars in Europe, in being able to hear the various dialects in the mouths of the people, and thus have a great command of facts, we are far behind them in the matter of apparatus criticus. The learned researches of German scholars seldom reach us, except by accident,\u2014we are, necessarily, ignorant of the progress of philological science, and it is therefore safer for us to establish a division of labour, and to confine ourselves to supplying facts for the information of our more fortunate fellow-labourers in Europe. Certain salient points, however, exist which may be noted with advantage, and to these I shall confine myself.\n\nThe name Bhojpuri, usually applied to this dialect, is derived from the ancient town of Bhojpur, in the district of Shahabad, situated a few miles south of the Ganges, and about sixty miles west of Patna. It is now a mere village, but was formerly a place of great importance, as the headquarters of the large and powerful clan of Rajpoots, whose head is the present Maharaja of Doomraon, and who rallied round the standard of the grand old chief Ku\u00f1war Singh in the mutiny of 1857. Readers of the entertaining \"Sair-ul Mutakherin\" will remember how often the Mahomedan Soubas of Azimabad (Patna) found it necessary to chastise the turbulent Zemindars of Bhojpur, and how little the latter seemed to profit by the lesson. It is remarkable that throughout the area of the Bhojpuri language a spirit of bigoted devotion to the old Hindu faith still exists, and that the proportion of Mahomedans to Hindus is very small. Rajpoots everywhere predominate, together with a caste called B\u00e1bhans (\u092c\u093e\u092d\u0928) or Bhuinh\u00e1rs (\u092d\u0942\u0907\u0902\u0939\u093e\u0930=landleute), who appear to be a sort of bastard Brahmins, and concerning whose origin many curious legends are told. The Maharaja of Bettiah in the Chumparun district is of this caste, though he is pleased to call himself a Brahmin.\n\nI consider that the purest form of the Bhojpuri is to be\nfound in Chumparun and Eastern Goruckpore. The Sarun people clip their words, and the Shahabad folk have been exposed to constant contact with other people, so that they have in many respects assimilated their speech to that of the townsmen and educated classes. Chumparun, lying far from the great highways of India, has remained in comparative obscurity. The valour of the Rajpoots has protected their country from Musulman invasion, and as its name (Chumparun \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923 = \"the forest of the Champak tree\"), implies, it was probably for many years a vast tract of almost impenetrable forest. Indeed, even in the present day, there are dense jungles in many parts of the district. From these causes the ancient speech has preserved its purity more in Chumparun than elsewhere; and the remarks I shall make will have reference chiefly to this district, though I shall also note any peculiarities in the dialects of other districts which may be known here, or seem deserving of mention.\n\nThe use of the compound consonants is unknown, and in writing the words of the language I shall therefore insert a vir\u00e1ma wherever there is any risk of obscurity, but in general the rules observed in Hind\u00ed may be applied, remembering that in some cases, e.g. the second person singular future, the final inherent vowel is distinctly heard (karba or k\u00f6rb\u00f6), while in the first person of the same tense it is mute (karab). In such cases as these the vir\u00e1ma will be used.\n\nI may also call attention to the fact that the proper name for the vernacular of the valley of the Ganges when unmixed with Persian words is not Hindv\u00ed, nor Hind\u00fa\u00ed, nor Hindoui, nor Hindavi, but plain and simple Hindi \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940, and that all the distinctions drawn by some writers between the words Hind\u00ed and Hind\u00fa\u00ed are purely imaginary. Both words mean the same thing, but those forms which contain the v are more used by the illiterate and by Mahomedans.\n\nI.\n\nThe sounds are in general the same as those in Sanskrit, and are expressed by the same letters, the vowels \u0905 and \u0906, however, are unknown, and the compound or Gu\u1e47a vowels \u090f and \u0913 are preferentially written \u0914 and \u0914; so also the V\u1e5biddhi vowels \u0910 and \u0914 are\nexpressed by \u0905\u0908 or \u0906\u0908 and \u0905\u090a or \u0906\u090a; but generally very little difference is observed between these two classes of sounds. This habit of writing the compound vowels by their elements is probably attributable to the fact that they are, as in Prakrit, derived by the elision of a consonant, and that a half-obscured memory of their origin tends to retain for them a separate existence in writing, and to a certain extent in speaking. It is not uncommon, for instance, to hear the word kaisan (Hindi kais\u0101) pronounced ku-isan, and it is generally written \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0928.\n\nWith regard to the consonants, it is noticeable that their regular elision in the middle of a word, leaving a hiatus, is one of those characteristics of the Mahar\u00e1sh\u1e6dr\u012b and Saurasen\u00ed Prakrits, especially of the former, which seems to militate against the supposition that the Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Hind\u00ed were derived from Sanskrit through them. For instance, the mutilated form \u0928\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u094b\u0913 ni-o-o for the Sanskrit \u0928\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u094b\u0917\u0940 niyogo, can never be the parent of the Hind\u00ed \u0928\u093f\u091c\u094b\u0917 njog. A fact observable in Bhojp\u00fari, however, seems to me to throw some light on this point; it is this, that many words are written with their full complement of consonants, but in speaking only a few can be heard. Thus the word ind\u00e1ra, \u201ca well,\u201d sounds in\u2019\u00e1ra; and even the few Persian words in use have not escaped, bandishw\u00e1r, \u201can opium contractor,\u201d sounds regularly ban\u2019sw\u00e1r. So also in the infinitive dh\u00f3\u2019e w\u00e1s\u1e6de, delh\u2019e j\u00faet, are heard for dhone ke w\u00e1s\u1e6de, dekhne ko j\u00e1t\u00e1; sa\u2019ak for \u0938\u0921\u093c\u0915 sarak, \u201ca road,\u201d and many others. We conclude, then, that the Prakrit of the plays is written more according to sound than etymology, and that the letters so frequently dropped represent the blurred inarticulate pronunciation of the peasantry, half-contemptuously mimicked by the Sanskrit playwrights. In Pali we do not find these numerous hiatus and droppings of consouants; and in the M\u00e1gadh\u00ed, from which it is derived, even the Prakrit grammarians notice that the elision of consonants is less frequent than in the principal dialect. Owing to religious influences, the modern Mar\u00e1th\u00ed has in so many instances borrowed the old pure Sanskrit words again that we cannot reason upon the Mahar\u00e1sh\u1e6dr\u012b Prakrit from it.\n\nAnother peculiarity in Bhojp\u00fari is its tendency to substitute medials for tenues. Thus we hear \u092d\u0940\u0917\u0928\u093e for the Hind\u00ed \u092b\u0947\u0915\u0928\u093e \u201cto throw,\u201d \u092d\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0928\u093e for \u092b\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0928\u093e \u201cto return,\u201d \u0917\u0941\u0917\u093e \u201ca parrot,\u201d for \u0917\u0941\u0915\u093e, etc.\n\n\u0930 is constantly substituted for \u0932. Thus \u0915\u0930\u093f\u091a \u201cblack,\u201d for \u0915\u093e\u0932\u093e; \u0939\u0930 \u201ca plough,\u201d for \u0939\u0932; \u092c\u0930\u0926 \u201ca bull,\u201d for \u092c\u0932\u0926; \u0939\u0930\u0926\u0940\n\"turmeric,\" for \u0939\u0932\u094d\u0926\u0940; \u0915\u0947\u091f\u093e \"a plantain,\" for \u0915\u0947\u0932\u093e; \u092a\u0930\u0935\u0930 \"a small sort of gourd,\" for \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0932; \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0926\u0948 \"a radish,\" for \u092e\u0942\u0932\u0940; \u091a\u0902\u0917\u0941\u0930\u0940 \"finger,\" for \u091a\u0902\u0917\u0941\u0932\u0940; and very many others. A dissyllabic word containing two open long syllables, like the word \u0915\u093e\u0932\u093e quoted above, generally takes an incrementary syllable,\u2014\u0907\u091a\u094d\u091b or \u0907\u091a\u094d\u091b (more frequently the latter), which increment has the effect of shortening the first syllable, as we have just seen in \u0915\u0930\u093f\u0936\u094d\u092e\u093e. Thus they say \u0905\u0938\u0941\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e \"a mango tree,\" for Hind\u00ed \u0906\u092e, \u092c\u0947\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0906\u092e for \u092c\u0947\u0921\u093c\u093e, \u0918\u0930\u0941\u0906 for \u0918\u0930, \u0916\u0947\u0924\u0941\u0906 for \u0916\u0947\u0924, \u0918\u0941\u0938\u0941\u0906 for \u0918\u093e\u0938, etc. In the first and third of these words the e is pronounced short, as in English, reminding one of Lassen's discovery that e and o are short as well as long in Prakrit. There is an unchecked license in this respect which gives a singular type to the language. Some men always add the u\u00e1, others rarely. In Shahabad it sounds i\u00e1 more than u\u00e1; but so confirmed is this habit that even mardu\u00e1, for the Persian mard, \"a man,\" is heard; and the English \"box\" becomes \u092c\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0941\u0906 baksu\u00e1. This habit is evidently of great antiquity, as it is seen in names of towns and villages; thus R\u00e1mp\u00far becomes in Chumparun R\u00e1mp\u00farw\u00e1; Tirk\u00fala (Sanscrit \u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0932\u093e) Tirku\u00ed\u00e1 and Tirkulu\u00e1, and even Mahu\u00e1 is called Mah\u00fawuwa, a word almost unpronounceable, and yet I know five or six villages of this name.\n\nSh is invariably pronounced s both in Hind\u00ed and Persian words. This agrees with Vararuchi xi. 2 (Lassen, p. 391), as far as \u0918 goes, and would be a M\u00e1gadh\u00ed type. I am unwilling, however, to admit the connection of Bhojp\u00far\u00ed with M\u00e1gadh\u00ed\u20141st. Because there exists another dialect called Magadh or Magarh (\u092e\u0917\u0927) spoken in Gya and Patna which differs from Bhojp\u00far\u00ed, and has the best claim to the title. 2nd. Because I think there is evidence of great changes having taken place in the localities of certain tribes and classes since the days of Prakrit. Roughly speaking, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtr\u00ed should be the parent of the modern Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Saurasen\u00ed that of Hind\u00ed proper, M\u00e1gadh\u00ed of Magadh, Pais\u00e1ch\u00ed of Nepalese, Apabhra\u1e43\u015bi of Sindhi; but in taking up any dialect now spoken in India it is impossible to avoid being struck by the mixture of types from all the Prakrit dialects that meets the eye. It would take me too far from the limits of this sketch to work out this point thoroughly, nor have I the machinery nor the ability for the task; but I mention it as a fact patent to the most cursory observer.\n\nThe above are the chief points of note in the pronunciation of this dialect. I proceed to the various parts of speech.\n\nThe noun is declined precisely as in Hind\u00ed, with the usual affixes k\u00fa,\nke, ki, ko, etc.; but there is a tendency to confusion of forms. Thus we hear ke used where the accusative or dative is evidently intended, and occasionally ko for ka of the genitive. In ordinary conversation in Bhojpuri, and often in other dialects of Hindi, the distinction between ka, ke, and ki is lost sight of, all three forms being merged in an obscure \u0915\u093f ki. For \u0938\u0947 se \u0938\u094b\u0902 son is commonly used, as also \u0925\u094b\u0902 thon; and for \u092a\u0930 pari. The plural is preferentially expressed by adding \u0932\u094b\u0917 l\u014dg or \u0938\u092c sab to the singular; and in all nouns except those ending in \u0906 nom. and \u090f oblique, there is generally no distinction of form between the two numbers. In the oblique cases of the plural, however, we occasionally find the termination \u092c\u0928 corresponding to the \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 of Hindi, thus \u0932\u094b\u0917\u0915\u093e \u201cof people;\u201d also, when with more emphasis, \u0932\u094b\u0917\u0928\u0940\u0915\u093e. This is similar to the old Hindi form.\n\nThe pronoun affords, on the contrary, great varieties of form, and it is in it that some of the most striking peculiarities of this dialect are exhibited. I give the personal pronouns in full.\n\n**FIRST PERSON.**\n\n| SINGULAR | PLURAL |\n|----------|--------|\n| I, \u0939\u092e | We, \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0940 |\n| Of me, \u0939\u092e\u0930 \u0939\u092e\u0930\u093e \u0939\u092e\u0930\u0947 \u0939\u092e\u0930\u094b | Of us, \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930 (also \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u093e). |\n| To me, \u092e\u0947, \u0939\u092e\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 | To us, \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0947, \u0939\u092e\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 |\n| From, \u0907\u0938\u0947, \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u0907\u0938\u0947 | (and \u0915\u0940). |\n| on, etc., \u0939\u092e\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0947\u0902, \u092e\u0947\u0902, etc. | From, \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u0947\u0902, etc. \u0939\u092e\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0947\u0902 |\n| me. | etc., us, |\n\n(Shahabad \u092e\u094b\u0902\u0939 \u0938\u094b\u0902)  \nmonh son.\n\n**SECOND PERSON.**\n\n| Thou, \u0924\u0941\u0939 | Ye, \u0924\u094b\u0939\u0928\u0940, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0928\u0940 |\n| Of thee, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0930 \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0930\u0947 | Of you, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u093e\u0930, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u093e |\n| To thee, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 | To you, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0947 |\n| thee | you, |\n| From thee, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0947\u0902 | From you, \u0924\u0941\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0947\u0902-\u0924\u0941\u0939\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u0947\u0902 etc. |\n\nIn the first person the true singular (\u092e\u0947\u0902 of the Hindi) does not exist. The form \u0939\u092e is used for both singular and plural, and the plural form\n\n1 Analogous to this is the use of the affix ko for the usual ke or karke in the Maithil dialect (Tirhut), where they say \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0915\u0930\u0915\u094b, \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0915\u094b, for the ordinary \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0915\u0947 and \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0915\u094b\u0908, \u201chaving seen.\u201d\ngiven above is only used when the notion of plurality requires to be distinctly enforced, and even then the forms \u0939\u092e \u0938\u092c, \u0939\u092e \u0932\u094b\u0917 (or frequently \u0939\u092e\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0917), are commonly heard. The only true plural form is that of the genitive, which, together with its analogue \u092c\u0941\u0939\u093e\u0930, exhibits a near approach to classical Hindi. The ablative form \u092e\u094b\u0902\u0939 \u0938\u0940\u0902 is the only one which recalls the Hindi singular, but I cannot say I have ever heard it in Chumparun. In the second person the singular is used in a familiar or half-contemptuous way. The respectful method of address corresponding to the Hindi \u0906\u092a is \u0930\u0909\u0930\u093e or \u0930\u094c\u0930\u093e, raur\u00e1, with a plural \u0930\u0909\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0939, rauranh, which is declined regularly as a noun. The oblique cases of the second person may also be written \u0924\u094b\u0930\u093e, \u0924\u094b\u0939\u0930\u093e, etc. Of course, in a language which is so seldom committed to writing in a serious way (for in writing accounts and the like every one seems to follow his own ideas), much diversity of spelling must exist; and as I am recording the forms of this dialect only from what I hear around me every day, I must confess to being very much in doubt about the correct spelling of many words.\n\nThe form \u0930\u0935\u093e\u0902 rava\u1e41 is also heard for \u0930\u0909\u0930\u093e, and suggests a possible connection with the Sanskrit \u092d\u0935\u093e\u0902, perhaps with an incorporation of the particle \u0930\u0947 or \u091a\u094d\u0930\u0947 in some way. This is a mere conjecture, however, and I can offer no certain clue to the origin of the word.\n\nThe pronoun of the third person is of two kinds,\u2014the proximate \u0908, \u090f, or \u0939\u093f; the remote \u091c\u093c, \u091a\u094b, or \u0939\u094b: here the old rule of the palatal sounds expressing nearness, and the labials, distance, comes out clearly as in the Hindi \u092f\u0939 and \u0935\u0939, and so many other languages. The declension is as follows:\u2014\n\n**Singular,** \u090f this (he).\n\n| N. | \u090f or \u0939\u093f (raro \u0908), this. |\n|----|--------------------------|\n| G. | \u090f\u0915\u0930 (Shah. \u0907\u0915\u0930), of this. |\n| Acc. | \u0907\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 and \u0907\u0915\u0947, this. |\n| Ab. | \u090f \u0938\u0940\u0902, from this. |\n\netc. etc.\n\n**that (he).**\n\n| \u091a\u094b or \u0939\u094b (raro \u091c\u093c), that. |\n|----------------------------|\n| \u0909\u0915\u0930 (Shah. \u091a\u094b\u0915\u0930), of that. |\n| \u0909\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 and \u091a\u094b\u0915\u0947, that. |\n| \u091a\u094b \u0938\u0940\u0902, from that. |\n\netc. etc.\n\n**Plural.**\n\n| N. | \u0907\u0939\u0947\u0902, these. |\n|----|-------------|\n| G. | \u0907\u0928\u0915\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u0947, of these. |\n| Acc. | \u0907\u0928\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947, \u0907\u0928\u0915\u0947, these. |\n| Ab. | \u0907\u0928\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0940\u0902 \u0907\u0928 \u0938\u0940\u0902, from these. |\n\netc. etc.\n\n| \u0909\u0939\u0947\u0902, those. |\n|-------------|\n| \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u0947, of those. |\n| \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947, \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0947, those. |\n| \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0940\u0902 \u0909\u0928 \u0938\u0940\u0902, from those. |\n\netc. etc.\nIt will be observed that the post-positions can be added either to the direct base, i.e. nominative, or to the secondary, i.e. inflected base; in the former case, being mere signs of inflection; in the latter, true post-positions, as in Latin or Greek. The latter form is more used when emphasis is required. The Hindi dialects are in an unsettled and transitional condition in respect of these particles. Thus we find that in the singular the particles are always appended to the direct base, while in the plural they are attached to an inflected base. Thus we say \u0646\u06cc\u0644 \u06a9\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0644 \u06a9\u0648, etc., in the singular, but \u0646\u06cc\u0644 \u06a9\u0648 \u0646\u06cc\u0644 \u06a9\u0648, etc., in the plural. In nouns ending in \u0627, we have, even in the singular, an inflected base for the post-position; thus from \u063a\u0648\u0631\u06c1 ghor\u00e1 we have \u063a\u0648\u0631\u06c1 \u06a9\u0627 gho\u0159\u00e9 k\u00e1. Thus, at least, the grammarians tell us, though \u063a\u0648\u0631\u06c1 \u06a9\u0627 gho\u0159\u00e9 k\u00e1 is a not uncommon vulgarism.\n\nThe several series of pronouns and pronominal adverbs are not quite so perfect as in Hindi. They are as follows:\n\n1.

For the present, the verb substantive \u092c\u093e, for the past, \u0930\u0939\u0932\u094d, and for the future, \u0939\u094b\u0907. In an uncultivated dialect like this, however, refinement of speech cannot be looked for, and consequently the Bhojpuri peasant as a rule confines himself to the three simple tenses given in the paradigm above. The use of \u092c\u093e, however, is very frequent, and its variations very great. First we have \u092c\u093e (in Shahabad \u092d\u093e), then \u092c\u091f\u0947 or \u092c\u093e\u091f\u0947, \u092c\u093e\u0930\u0941 and \u092c\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0906; and, lastly, a declinable form (the others being indeclinable), which, though the same for both singular and plural, varies for the persons, thus\u2014\n\n1st person, \u0939\u092e \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0924 \u0935\u093e\u0930\u0940; I am, we are looking.\n2nd ,, \u0924\u0941\u0939 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0924 \u0935\u093e\u0930 (b\u0101ra), thou art, ye are looking.\n3rd ,, \u0909\u0939 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0924 \u0935\u093e\u0930\u0928, he is, they are looking.\n\nI generally hear this form used in asking questions and in replying to them; in narrative the other indeclinable forms are used.\n\nFor the Hindi \u0925\u093e, which is unknown, the past tense of the verb \u0930\u0939\u0928\u093e\u0902, \u201cto stay,\u201d is in use; and the future exhibits \u0939\u094b\u0907, the regular future of \u0939\u094b\u0907\u0928\u093e\u0902, \u201cto be,\u201d the conjugation of which will be given hereafter.\n\nThere are also some fragmentary forms in use. The dialect being an expressive one, in its rude way, indulges much in enclitics (\u1e6dheg\u0101, \u1e6de\u1e45\u0101, as they call them, Anglice, tags). Thus we hear \u0915\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093f, \u201cI say,\u201d probably a corruption of \u0915\u0939\u0924 \u0935\u093e\u0930\u0940, as I do not remember to have heard this particular tag used with any other verb.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Since writing the above I have heard the words \u091c\u093e\u0907\u0924\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0902, \u201cI am going,\u201d and \u092c\u093e\u0932\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0902, (ban'tarin) for \u092c\u093e\u0901\u0927\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0902, \u201cI am tying,\u201d so that probably the phrase is a common one.\nfavourite is \u0928\u0942\u0902, which is added to the end of a sentence, however long, and gives a certain accent of conviction or energy, as we should say, \"Don't you see?\" Take for example the following sentence: \u0924\u094b\u0939\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0941\u0908 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 \u0906 \u0938\u0939\u0940\u0928\u093e \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0924 \u0935\u093e\u0902, which means, \"Well, but you get two rupees a month you know, recollect that.\" The words in italics are all expressed by \u0928\u0942\u0902, accompanied by a certain turn of the voice and gesture with the hands and shoulders, which must be seen to be appreciated. \u0939 (pronounced ha! or ho!) is also added to commands, as \u091c\u093e\u0939\u093f j\u0101ha! \"go! go!\" Others are \u0939\u0940 (Sansk. \u0939\u093f), \u0939\u094b\u0902 (id.), \u0928\u0940 and \u0928\u094b\u0902, etc.\n\nIt is expedient to exhibit the conjugation of a verb whose root ends in \u0906, as such verbs deviate in some points from others.

In Urdu this tense is generally used as a vague present, in contrast to the definite present in t\u00fa:\u2014wuh kah\u00e1n j\u00e1c, \"where is he going?\" but abhi j\u00e1t\u00e1 hai, \"he is going at once.\" Such a delicate distinction is beyond the comprehension of our simple peasantry. The only time I am sensible of the existence of a sort of aorist is when a man says, \"May I take leave?\" = ab hum j\u00e1l\u00edn, \u091a\u092c \u0939\u092e \u091c\u093e\u0907\u0901, which is literally, \"now I go,\" said with a questioning tone. If there be any such tense it differs only from the Hindi in sounding \u0908\u0902 for \u0908 in the first and third persons of the plural; and here, again, I half suspect copying from the Hindi.\n\nThe prohibitive particle \u092e\u0924\u094d of the Hindi imperative is not in use; \u0928 is used.\n\nIt must further be noted that the utmost confusion exists in the application of the above rules, so that you hear, e.g. \u092a\u0940\u091f\u093e\u0930\u094d as the future of \u092a\u0940\u091f\u0928\u093e\u0902, \"to beat,\" \u0915\u0941\u091a\u093e\u0935\u0924 \u0930\u0939\u0932\u094d, as the imperfect of \u0915\u094c\u091a\u093e\u0928\u093e, \"to steal,\" and the like. I have endeavoured, however, with the aid of the best-informed natives, to select and exhibit the most accurate and widely used forms.\n\nIn this place should be noticed the form of a verbal noun in \u092c\u0947\u0902 or \u092c\u0947\u0902. Examples of this form are \u0938\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0902 \u0928 \u0915\u0948\u0932\u0928 sunbe na kailan, \"they would not give me a hearing;\" \u0906\u0935\u0947\u0902 \u0928 \u0915\u0930\u093f\u0932\u0902 \u00fbbe na karila, \"you would not\n(even) come,\" \u0939\u094b\u0935\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u093f \u0910\u0938\u0928 hove kari aisan, \"it will probably be so,\" \"it may be expected to be so.\" On comparing this form with Beng\u00e1li expressions, such as \u0915\u0930\u093f\u092c\u093e\u0930 \u091c\u094b\u0902 k\u00f6rib\u00e1r j\u00f6ny\u014d, \"for the sake of doing,\" and the Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed infinitive which ends in \u0932\u0942 as \u0932\u0942 \u0932\u0942 \u0932\u0942 karvun, levun, etc.; and again with the two infinitives in Mar\u00e1thi, one of which ends in \u0932\u0942 as \u0915\u0930\u0942 karun, the other in \u0932\u0942, as \u0915\u0930\u0942\u0902 karnen; and taking further into consideration the old Braj infinitive in \u0935\u0940\u0902, as \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0902 jalvaun, we are forced to regard this form also as a true infinitive, or perhaps a gerund, with a substantive power, similar to that of the inflected infinitive in \u0928\u0940; and its preservation in the local dialects, after it has been lost from the classical tongue, supplies an additional link between the Hind\u00ed and other neo-Aryan dialects. Further, the form of the Beng\u00e1li future, as \u0915\u0930\u093f\u092c k\u00f6rib\u014d, etc., and the same tense in Bhojpuri, as \u0915\u0930\u0942, etc., gives us in connection with the Latin forms amabo, amabis, etc., a clue to its origin in the substantive verb \u092d\u0942 \"to be,\" which has lost its aspirate equally in the neo-Aryans and in the Latin.\n\nThe peculiar value of this and similar formations in the local dialects consists in this, that Urd\u00fa has in many respects alienated itself from the sister languages owing to foreign influences, and the existence of such forms as these helps us to restore and establish the fundamental unity of the whole class, even though on a surface view many links might seem to have been lost.\n\nThe substantive verb \u0939\u094b\u0928\u093e, \"to be,\" though in many respects quite regular, possesses, however, some forms of a peculiar nature. The chief noticeable point is the presence of \u0916 kh. Thus we have\u2014\n\n| Bhojpuri | Hindi |\n|----------|-------|\n| \u0939\u094b\u0935\u0924 | \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e | being. |\n| \u0939\u094b\u0935\u0938 | \u0939\u090f | they have been. |\n| \u0939\u094b\u0935\u092c | \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0939\u0902\u0917\u093e | I shall be. |\n| \u0939\u094b\u0935\u092c\u0939 | \u0924\u0942 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e | thou shalt be. |\n| \u0939\u094b\u0935\u0940\u0939\u093f (\u0939\u0940\u0902) | \u0924\u0941\u0939 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e | he shall be. |\n| \u0939\u094b\u0935\u0940 | \u0939\u094b\u091c\u0940\u091a | be thou (respectful). |\n\nThese forms arise from the incorporation of the substantive verb \u0939\u0948. This verb, except in the combinations given above, is not declinable, though the single form \u0939\u0948 with its negative \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 is common. As we go further east into Tirlut the form \u0939\u0948 is universally employed for \"is;\" quite superseding \u092c\u093e. \u0939\u0948 is heard as far east as the Hind\u00ed language goes, viz., as far as 87\u00b0 45', where it merges into the Beng\u00e1li \u0906\u091b\u0947\ufffd achhe. Inasmuch as this last word is clearly a corruption of the\nSanskrit \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f, we have a chain of forms whose relative geographical position is analogous to their philological. Beginning in Bengal, the region, par excellence, of well-preserved Sanskrit forms, and going steadily westwards, we pass in order through the following forms:\u2014 \u0906\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0947 achhe, \u0908 chhe, \u0916\u0947 khe, and \u0939\u0948 hai. I am disposed, however, to place \u0939\u0948 between \u0908 and \u0916\u0947, and to regard the latter as sprung from a hardening of the aspirate, something similar to what takes place regularly in the termination s h of Persian words, which spring from a Sanskrit visarga, and become in Armenian \u0572 g, as \u0583\u0565\u0580\u057d pretas, \u0583\u056b\u0577\u057f\u0561 fishta, \u0583\u056b\u0577\u057f\u0561 hrieshdag.\n\nThe word \u092c\u093e is pronounced in Shahabad \u092d\u093e bh\u00e1; and that this is the more correct pronunciation is shown by the form of the past tense, which is in Chumparun \u092d\u0947\u0932 bhel, in Shahabad \u092e\u0948\u0932 or \u092d\u094b\u0932. It is also evidently derived from the Sanskrit \u092d\u0942. The form \u092d\u093e is found in old Hind\u00ed, but in a past sense (Garcin de Tassy, Gram. Hind. p. 37); the most usual form is \u092d\u092f\u0940, and \u092d\u092f\u093e is common in modern Hind\u00ed for \u0939\u0906 all over India.\n\nThe form in \u0938 of the perfect is of frequent use, and in some constantly recurring words, as \u0930\u0939\u0928\u093e, it loses its \u091c and sounds \u0930\u0939\u0938\u094d, as in the phrase \u0924\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0930 \u0909\u0939 \u0930\u0939\u0938 \u0915\u093f \u0928\u093e, \u201cwas he there at the time or not?\u201d This clipping is a characteristic of the Sarun district.\n\nI now proceed to make a few remarks on the origin and general relations of the forms of the Bhojpuri verb.\n\nThe infinitive retains the anusw\u0101ra, which appears originally to have existed in the Hind\u00ed. I may mention that even in Urd\u00fa at the present day I have met many educated natives who always write \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0646 hon\u00e1n, karu\u00e1n, etc., for \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0646 hon\u00e1, kar\u00e1.\n\nThe presence of this anusw\u0101ra leads me to the conclusion that the infinitive is derived from the neuter form of the verbal substantive in Sanskrit, and not from the masculine as suggested by Professor Bopp (Comp. Gram. vol. iii. p. 1233, Eng. ed.) Taking the forms in order of antiquity, we have first the Sanskrit in am, e.g. \u091c\u0935\u0932\u0928\u0902 or \u091c\u0935\u0932\u0928\u092e\u094d. (This use of the anusw\u0101ra is merely a compendium scripturae and not a pure nasal as in \u0935\u0928\u094d\u092e; or the like.) Next we find the \u092e resolved into its two elements, the labial and the nasal. The former element in its vowel form amalgamates with the inherent short vowel of the preceding \u0928 and forms \u0928\u094b; the latter becomes a pure anusw\u0101ra with nasal intonation, and the weakening of the \u092e into these two feebler exhibitions of each of its component elements is compensated for in the ever sensitive\nHindi by lengthening the \u0928\u094b to \u0928\u0940\u0902; thus we get the Braj form \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940\u0902. The next stage is the Bhojpuri \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0902 which follows the rule by which all words in Braj ending in \u0928\u0940 change this vowel into \u0928\u0940\u0902; lastly, we get the Hindi and Urdu form \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e. In support of this view I may allege\u2014Firstly, that in the cognate languages the infinitive has always a neuter form, that is to say, the Gerundial or Noun-infinitive. Thus the Marathi has \u0939\u094b\u0908\u0902, \u0932\u0947\u0908\u0902, which is shown to be a neuter form by the neuters of the participles and adjectives, as \u091a\u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947, etc.; also the pronouns \u0939\u0948\u0902, \u0924\u0948\u0902, etc. Similarly the Gujarati exhibits \u0932\u0941\u0902 as \u0932\u0941\u0902 karvun, \u201cto do,\u201d \u0932\u0947\u0935\u0941\u0902 levun, \u201cto take,\u201d etc., in comparison with the neuters of participles in \u0917 and the possessive pronouns \u0905\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0902 am\u0101run, \u0924\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0902 tam\u0101run. So also the Bengali gives \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0928 dekhan, \u201cto see,\u201d \u092c\u0938\u0928 basan, \u201cto sit,\u201d etc., true neuters. The Sindhi inf. similarly ends in \u092f\u0941\u0902 and the Uriya in \u0928. Secondly, the dissolution of final \u092e into its elements, and the working up of the dissolved elements, as in the infinitive, is exemplified in such words as \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940\u0902 from \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e, \u0928\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940\u0902 from \u0928\u093e\u092e, \u0938\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940\u0902 from \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093f; in the last instance, however, the palatal vowel has overcome the labial left by the \u092e.\n\nThe form of the present in \u0924\u0942 is a truer present than the ordinary Hindi in \u0924\u093e, which is really the agent of the Sanskrit. The Braj form \u091c\u093e\u0932\u0942 leads us to the Sanskrit agent base in \u0924\u0942 rather than to the form of the nominative in \u0924\u093e, and the feminine form \u091c\u093e\u0932\u0940 points to the Sanskrit feminine in \u0924\u0940\u0902. It is, however, possible to imagine that the Hindi forms in \u0924\u093e and \u0924\u0940 arose also out of the present participle in Sanskrit in this way. The Prakrit form of this participle ends in \u091a\u0932\u0928, from which we get the Sindhi form in \u0907\u0902\u0926\u094b as \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0902\u0926\u094b; a closely allied form is that in use in the southern parts of the Punjab and as far north as the boundary of the Barr, \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0902\u0926\u094b marendo or \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e marend\u0101, \u201cbeating.\u201d A step further brings us to the Panjabi proper, which has two forms; that which is used with a verb ending in a vowel retains the nasal, as \u091c\u093e\u0909\u0902\u0926\u093e j\u0101u\u1e47\u1e0da, \u201cgoing,\u201d but in a verb which ends in a consonant the nasal is of necessity dropped, and we hear \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e kard\u0101, \u201cdoing,\u201d \u0918\u0932\u094d\u0926\u093e ghal\u1e0d\u0101, \u201csending,\u201d etc. This latter form brings us naturally to the Hindi \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e. If this supposition be the true one, the Bhojpuri would seem to have kept itself outside of the whole of this process, and to have retained the simple and original Sanskrit form in \u091a\u0932\u0928 unchanged. I am not yet in a position to give an opinion as to which of the two suppositions is the more correct. The solution of the question depends on the relative antiquity of the\nvarious dialects, and we have yet to settle whether it is likely or possible for the Hind\u00ed to have borrowed from so obscure a source as Panj\u00e1b\u00ed. In fact there is much that requires clearing up in the relation between the Sauraseni, Braj, and the modern Hind\u00ed dialects, and until we know more of the colloquial forms of early Prakrit, the mist cannot be dispelled. The Prakrit of the poets is clearly not a dialect that was ever spoken. How far it represents the characteristics of any spoken dialect is a question. It is, however, clear that each dialect of Hind\u00ed has had an independent existence for centuries, and I think an independent origin. It cannot be supposed that the Bhojp\u00far\u00ed ever arose out of classical Hind\u00ed, or Hind\u00ed out of it. The next form that we have to notice is of itself sufficient to refute any such supposition. I allude to the past tense with its characteristic \u0932. The generally received theory concerning this widely-spread form, which is found in Beng\u00e1li, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Gujar\u00e1ti, and in one at least of the Hind\u00ed dialects, is that it is derived from the Sanskrit past participle in \u0924 by a change of \u0924 into \u0930, thence through \u0930 and \u0930 to \u0932. This theory has received the support of the highest authorities, including Bopp and Lassen. My objections to it are these. In the first place, though the possibility of such a change cannot be denied, yet the probability is slight. So great a change must have been gradual and must have left some landmarks. Yet we find the form in \u0932 existent in Prakrit at the same time as forms in \u0930 and \u0930 (vide Lassen, Inst. Prak. p. 363), and in the modern languages no traces of the two latter forms exist. Again, the dialects which use the form in \u0932 have no examples of the form in \u0924 except in such Sanskrit words as they have resuscitated in their old dress in comparatively modern times. The argument insisted upon by both Bopp and Lassen of the existence of a parallel form in the Slavonic languages militates against their theory, for the Slavonic people separated themselves from the general stock at a period when Sanskrit, as we know it, was hardly formed, and could have taken away with them nothing more than the common family wordstems, and the general birth-need, or inherent tendency to form their language according to the common Indo-Germanic canons. The existence among them, therefore, of such a form, seems to shew that it must have a higher antiquity than is secured for it by supposing it to be a mere later Prakrit corruption, and I am therefore inclined to suppose it to be an original and independent form for past time as ancient as that in \u0924, and existing side by side with it, but one which for reasons we cannot\nyet fathom has not asserted itself in written Sanskrit, unless it be there represented by the participle in \u0928 or \u0923, a supposition supported by the known convertibility of the two letters \u0928 and \u0923 as exhibited in the modern Beng\u00e1li pronunciation, as also in the form of the Armenian infinitive in _l_ l as in _uhplL sirel_, _plplL bieril_, and other words. Besides, it may be urged that though the transit of \u0930 into \u0932 is a fact supported by some good examples, yet as far as the Bhojp\u00fari is concerned the tendency is quite the opposite; \u0932 migrates into \u0930 freely and frequently, but I cannot adduce any instances of \u0930 changing into \u0932.\n\nI would here further observe that the written Sanskrit has unfortunately attracted the attention of scholars too exclusively. No one who lives long in India can escape having the conviction forced on him that the written language is quite inadequate to account for many forms and facts observable in the modern dialects. These dialects assert for themselves a high antiquity, and are derived, one cannot doubt, from an ancient Aryan speech, which is as imperfectly represented in Sanskrit as the speech of the Italian peasantry of their day was represented by Cicero or Virgil. The process of selection which led the polished Roman to use only stately and euphonious words\u2014a process which is abundantly exemplified in the pages of modern English writers\u2014was doubtless at work among the ancient Brahmins; and the fact that the cognate Indo-Germanic languages preserve words not found in Sanskrit, but which can be matched from the stores of humble and obscure Hind\u00ed or Beng\u00e1li dialects, is another proof of this fact. The line taken by Professor Lassen, in his valuable Prakrit Grammar, of treating all Prakrit words as necessarily modifications of Sanskrit words, is one which he has borrowed whole from Vararuchi and Hemachandra, and however excusable in those ancient commentators, seems unworthy of an age of critical research. The elaborate torturing of a Sanskrit word to make it serve as the etymon of a Prakrit word is a false and strained proceeding. If we approached the Prakrit from the side of the modern vernaculars we should, I think, arrive at a truer view of its position. But I am wandering from the subject of the present notice into a very wide field indeed.\n\nThe future appears to be formed of remains of two separate systems; the first and second persons belonging to one, and the third person to another. That of the first and second persons is clearly a combination of the stem with the substantive verb \u092c\u093e, which recalls the Latin future\nin bo, bis, etc.; also the prefixed \u0686 of the Persian and the \u0686 of the Beng\u0101l\u012b. The reason why the first person is pronounced in two syllables while the second person has three, is to be found, I believe, in the original existence of an \u0686 in the latter (\u092d\u0935\u0938\u093f\u0938), which modulated into o and thence into a short \u014d. The third person resembles some of the forms of the present given in Lassen's paradigms of the Mah\u0101r\u0101sh\u1e6dr\u012b Prakrit, and points to the existence of two futures,\u2014one compounded with the root \u0686, the other with \u0686; the two first persons are remnants of the first verb as the third person is of the second. The reason for this it is difficult to discover; but I may mention that the respectful form of the imperative, which sounds in classical Hind\u012b j\u0101iye, is often pronounced, even beyond Bhojp\u016br\u012b limits, j\u0101ih\u016b \u091c\u093e\u0907\u0939\u0942, which is identical in form with the third person plural of the future; and as the plural is used in most Aryan languages as a mark of politeness and respect, it is not improbable that the respectful form of the imperative arose from the same sentiment, and the final \u0939\u0942 of the plural may be nothing more than the emphatic particle. Beyond this I cannot at present offer any safe conjecture. The formation of futures, as a rule, in modern Aryan languages proceeds upon analytical principles, the inflectional characteristic being more readily lost in this than in other tenses. Just as we have in the Romance languages a future formed by the auxiliary \"to have,\" so in the modern Indo-Aryans we see that recourse is had, in the absence of a possessive verb, to the verbs \"to be,\" \"to go,\" and the like. Thus in the Hind\u012b the forms g\u0101, g\u0101i, g\u0113, g\u0113h\u016b, of the future are recognizable as connected with some now lost relative of the Sanskrit \u0917\u092e\u094d; probably there existed a form \u0917\u093e,1 which would be intermediate between the existing roots \u0917\u092e\u094d and \u092f\u093e, and thus we should have a series of roots meaning \"to go,\" gradually modulating from the guttural into the palatal varga; thus \u0917\u092e\u094d, \u0917\u093e, \u092f\u093e, \u0907, of which \u0917\u093e has left no trace in classical writings. My suggestion that the third person of the Bhojp\u016br\u012b future points to the verb \u091a\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0941 rests upon the Hind\u012b form \u0939\u0942, which in ordinary conversation is apt to sound little more than \u0907, especially in Eastern Hindust\u0101n\u012b.\n\nIn the pronouns the most remarkable feature is the formation of the cases. Here, again, we find scholars trying to recall the forms in use in the modern dialects to some connection with the Sanskrit, and I fear with very bad success. I hazard with much diffidence some remarks which point in a fresh direction. In the first place it is noticeable that\n\n1 Westergaard gives \u0917\u093e, but only as a Vedic word. Rad. Sanscr. p. 2.\nwe have in the majority of these languages the same system of genitive formation with a different class of consonants.\n\nHindi, \u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0947\nPunjabi, \u0926\u093e \u0926\u0940 \u0926\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u0902\nMarathi, \u091a\u093e \u091a\u0940 \u091a\u0947 \u091a\u093e \u091a\u0902, etc.\n\nThe effect of these particles, as has been observed from the first, is to make the governed substantive into an adjective agreeing in its accidents with the governing substantive, so that instead of saying patris equus we say virtually paternus equus, and so forth.\n\nIn the next place, the \u0915 of the Hindi might, by known laws, modulate into the \u091a of the Marathi, if we could safely assign to Hindi, as Hindi, a higher antiquity than to Marathi. This is a question which must be investigated quite apart from any considerations as to the relative position of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtr\u00ed and Sauraseni Prakrits, because the locale of the plays being chiefly at Ujjayin, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtr\u00ed probably acquired undue prominence. It is not possible, I think, to suppose upon known laws any phonetic connection between the \u0926 of the Panjabi and the \u0915 of Hindi. The Punjabi \u0926, however, can be legitimately connected with the \u0930 of the pronouns of all the languages, and we may here throw in the \u0930 or \u090f\u0930 of the Bengali. Thus we have two groups. The Hindi and Marathi noun, on the one hand, and the Panjabi and Bengali noun, with all the pronouns, on the other. A third element occurs in the Gujarati \u0928\u094b, which again is found as an accusative in the Panjabi \u0928\u0941, while the \u0915 of the Hindi re-appears in the accusative of the Bengali \u0915\u09c7 ke. The Nepalese genitive sign is \u0915\u094b, which is identical in form with the sign for the Hindi accusative; but, in origin, is doubtless a relic of the old Hindi form \u0915\u094c, which has in modern Hindi been softened still further into \u0915\u093e. The Sindhi \u091c system is a still further softening of the Marathi \u091a.\n\nWith the \u0926 of the Panjabi agrees the prefixed \u0913 d of the Pushtu, and perhaps the \u0566 of the Armenian accusative. It is further noticeable that at one period of its history Hindi possessed both the \u0915 and the \u0926 system, as the latter is found in the poems of the early Hindi bards generally, and a series with \u0930 is shewn in a quatrain given by M. Garcin de Tassy in a note to his valuable \"Grammaire de la langue Hindou\u00ef.\" That distinguished scholar attributes the presence of these forms to Panjabi influence, and his view is doubtless correct. In the M\u00e1rwar\u00ed dialect of Hindi the genitive is regularly formed by \u0930\u0940 and \u0930\u0947 m. \u0930\u0940 fem. This \u0930 type also occasionally occurs in the Prithv\u00ed\nr\u00e1ja, R\u00e1sa of Chand, which is written in the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00ed dialect of Hansi and Sirsa. The facts may be thus summed up:\n\n1. The machinery for expressing the genitive is identical in nature in the majority of the languages.\n\n2. The said machinery differs by the employment of separate characteristics in each language.\n\n3. These characteristics may be reduced into two groups\u2014a linguo-dental and a gutturo-palatal.\n\n4. In the first group are found Panj\u00e1b\u00ed, Beng\u00e1li, and the pronouns of the two first persons in all the Neo-Aryan languages, and those of all three persons in Bhojp\u00far\u00ed. In the second, Hind\u00ed, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, and Sindh\u00ed.\n\n5. The characteristics of the genitive in some languages re-appear as characteristics of other cases in other languages.\n\nThe modern languages of the Indo-Germanic family reject as a rule the inflectional construction, and adopt an analytical construction by means of pre- or affixed particles. In the European languages these particles are words which in the inflectional period were prepositions\u2014de, ad, per, super, of, out, to, etc. For the genitive relation the preposition which in the former period expressed \u201cseparation\u201d and \u201cderivation from,\u201d is de, of, von.\\(^1\\) Another method of expressing genitive relation is by the use of relative pronouns. This is one of the Semitic methods (for instance, also and ?). On this principle we should expect a system of palatals from the Sanskrit \u092f\u0903; and although it is in Hind\u00ed a common vulgarism to use \u091c\u0940\u0938\u093e for \u091c\u0940\u0938\u093e and so forth, yet we are not prepared to take the interrogative \u0915\u0903 for \u092f\u0903; though by this means the \u0915\u0903 system would receive an appropriate solution. Nothing, however, among the relative pronouns of Sanskrit furnishes an origin for the linguo-dental system. \u0938\u0903 might, it is true, be adduced; but the real radical of the \u0938\u0903 series of pronouns is \u0928\u0903, and if we took this we should have to work backwards through the Panj\u00e1b\u00ed \u0930\u0903 and an imaginary \u0930\u0903 to the pronouns in \u0930\u0903, which would hardly be consistent with the universally higher antiquity of pronouns, or account for their unanimous use of the \u0930\u0903 in languages which use the \u0915\u0903 system in their nouns.\n\n\\(^1\\) Von has a genitive relation, though a dative construction; auf and of have got sundered.\n\n\\(^2\\) Such as we probably have in the Persian iz\u0101fa. There is a good Essay, by Garnett, on the subject of genitives: it is published in the collected volume of his Essays, which I have not at hand while I write.\nDr. Trumpp's suggestion of \u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f for the \u0915 system, and B\u00e1b\u00fa R\u00e1jendra L\u00e1l Mittra's of the affirmative \u0915 of Sanskrit nouns, both fail to meet the necessities of the case, as they do not embrace the whole group of languages, and the uniformity of the machinery leads us to look for one general explanation which will satisfy all the members of the class.\n\nThere remains only the method adopted by the European languages, that of using prepositions as signs of case, and this is manifestly inapplicable to the genitive, whatever may be said of other cases. None of the Sanskrit prepositions can have furnished the elements of the \u0915 system, or of the \u0930 system.\n\nIt is here that the Bhojpuri throws a new light on the problem. In the forms \u0926\u0915\u0930, \u0926\u0915\u0930\u093e, etc., we find both the \u0915 and the \u0930 element combined, and the supposition immediately occurs that this is the oldest and most genuine form. There is a known tendency in languages of the Aryan family to sunder compound consonants, so that while one language preserves one of them a second will preserve only the other. May not this tendency have been at work in the present instance? If we assume that the original affix of personality was \u0915\u094d\u0930 kr, we have in the older and more widespread \u0930 system a rejection of the \u0915, and in the more recent \u0915 system on the other hand a rejection of the \u0930, which latter would be in consonance with the Pali and Prakrit rule of assimilating an \u0930 when it is the second member of a compound to the first member, e.g. \u092a\u094d\u0930 for \u092a\u094d\u0930. As to the origin and meaning of this affix \u0915\u094d\u0930 kr, I cannot here dilate, but its existence is hinted at by Greek forms like \u1f21\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, etc. If it could be asserted that the root \u0915\u094d\u0930 (\u0915\u094d\u0930) were in any way connected with this affix, Dr. Trumpp's theory would not be altogether out of harmony with mine; but I am far from being prepared to admit this point at present.\n\nIII.\n\nTo return to the Bhojpuri dialect.

It, and in fact the whole of this article, would have been more complete had I not been appointed to another district in quite a different part of the country, and thus obliged to leave Chumparun before I had completed my researches. I trust, however, that, slight as they are, these remarks may suffice to show how much valuable information, and what an amount of new light on doubtful subjects, may be expected from a fuller investigation of the rural dialects of Hindi. In the Bhojpuri we have a dialect spoken by a numerous population in one of the most fertile and accessible parts of India, one which counts more speakers than any other dialect of Hindi, and which yet has remained entirely uncultivated and uninvestigated. The Braj having attracted the attention of the Musulman invaders, and having been adopted by them and made to serve as a basis for their copious, beautiful, and all-pervading Urdu, has usurped the honors due to its sister dialects, and is in return deprived of the light which they might throw on its otherwise obscure formations.\n\nIf at a future time I should have further opportunities of investigating the Bhojpuri, I shall endeavour to collect ballads and old songs, sunnuds and title deeds, in the hope that the older forms of the dialect may thus be brought to light. I do not, however, think much is likely to be done in this way, as I observe that the wording of ballads is apt to get modernized, when they are not reduced to writing, and from the fact that Chumparun was so long a jungle, there are not likely to be many old title deeds in existence. It is, however, pre-eminently a district for archaeologists. There is a large Buddhist tope at Kesarea (called by the people Raja Bhim's house); two Asoka pillars at places named after them Louria (laur = \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2); the vast ruins of the ancient city of Simraon;\u00b9 and many old temples. Mud forts exist in the northern part of the district, and in one place there is a re-\n\n\u00b9 In 1835 the remains of walls, a large reservoir, ditches, a brick causeway, palace, citadel, and temple of richly carved stone, were still standing. Simraon was founded by Manyupa Deva in A.D. 1097, his sixth successor, Hari Singha Deva, was defeated by Toghlaq Shah in 1322, and fled to Kathmandu, where he established his throne. Simraon has been in ruins since that time. The kingdom when at its height extended from the Kosi to the Gandak, and from the foot of the hills to the Ganges. See Journal Asiatic Society, Bengal, March, 1835. The ruins have been much diminished since that date; a few fine sculptures still remain, and the mounds marking the old line of walls enclose an immense area.\nmarkable collection of them, called B\u00e1wan Garh\u00ed or the Fifty-two forts. In all these places, as well as in the strange tower-like mounds which exist here and there, there might be found old copper plates of grants of land and so forth. In short, there is much to be done in the way both of linguistic and arch\u00e6ological enquiry and discovery in this interesting district; it is to be hoped that some one will one day or other take up the task. It is also to be hoped that we shall soon cease to hear the modern languages of India sneered at as rude and unworthy of attention. This way of talking was originated by the Orientalist school of English in India forty years ago, who enchanted with the discoveries which were being made at that time in Sanskrit, and not yet emancipated from the frigid classicality of the last century, could spare no time for the examination of the living vernaculars. It is now considered ridiculous to speak of Italian and French as miserable modern jargons; and consistency demands that we should not treat Hind\u00ed or Mar\u00e1th\u00ed with contempt either, or consider that time as wasted which is spent in investigations into the arcana of their structure and origin.\nINDEX.\n\nAl-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, 425.\nAl-'Otbi, 424 ff.\nAmravat\u012b Tope, Description of, 132 ff.\nArusha, Arushi, 201 ff.\nAssyrian Language, Glossary of, 1 ff.\nB\u0101dsch\u0101h-n\u0101mah, 462 ff.\nBastian, Dr. A., Remarks on the Indo-Chinese Alphabets, 65\u201380.\nBeames, John, Esq., Notes on the Bhojpuri Dialect of Hindi, 483\u2013508.\nBhojpuri Dialect, 483 ff.\nCatalogue of Oriental Manuscripts in King's College, Cambridge, 105 ff.\nColebrooke's Essay \"On the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow,\" on the Sources of, 183 ff.\nFergusson, James, Esq., Description of the Amravat\u012b Tope in Guntur, 132\u2013166.\nFryer, Capt.

In consequence of the privilege of foreign travel being now extended to all Japanese subjects, many of these have lately visited the chief capitals of Europe on diplomatic or scientific missions, or for the purpose of studying European\nmanners and institutions. In the meantime, the old restrictions to the free intercourse of Europeans with natives have gradually given way to a more enlightened policy, whereby every facility is afforded for the study of that remarkable people.\n\nIn China, the recent establishment of two colleges at Pekin for the instruction of educated Chinese in Western science and languages, bodes well for the zeal of the Chinese Government in trying to secure for the nation some of the most palpable advantages of European civilization. It is also a matter for rejoicing that the noble example of patronage which was set by the East India Company fifty years ago, in bearing the whole expense for printing Morrison's Chinese Dictionary, has recently been followed by the Hon. Joseph Jardine, an English merchant at Hongkong, by whose munificence Dr. Legge has been enabled to undertake his splendid edition of the Chinese Classics.\n\nThe discovery of the gigantic Naga Temples of Cambodja, by which quite a new chapter in the history of Indian civilization has been opened, may, it is hoped, lead to further archaeological and ethnological researches in the remoter parts of Ultragangetic India, into whose mysterious seclusion European travellers are at length beginning to penetrate: while the steady advance of the Russians in Turkistan, and the reluctant extension of English influence beyond the Karakorum and Kuenl\u00fcn mountain ranges, must facilitate scientific investigations in Central Asia.\n\nThe transfer of the Straits Settlements to the more direct administration of the Colonial Office might perhaps be made a fitting opportunity for reviving the magnificent scheme, projected by Sir S. Raffles nearly half a century ago, of making Singapore not only an emporium for the commerce, but also a centre for the cultivation of the Arts and Sciences of the Far East; and it is with this view that the Council desire to draw attention to the new arrangement.\nWith regard to India, in whose material and literary progress this Society takes a more immediate interest, the Council have the gratification to report that the Committee for the publication of the architectural antiquities of Western India, which was formed two years ago under the presidency of Sir Bartle Frere, the then Governor of Bombay, have brought out within the past year four magnificent volumes of photographs with descriptive letterpress,\u2014the very considerable expenses of these publications being exclusively defrayed by wealthy natives.\n\nAnother subject of great literary importance to which this Society gave the first impulse, is the Bill lately passed in the Legislative Council of India for the compulsory registration of all printed matter,\u2014books, pamphlets, and pictures. Under the provisions of this Act, which applies to the whole of British India, and extends not only to works published, but also to those privately printed, of which there is a large and important body, three copies of everything printed must be deposited within one month, and will be paid for by Government. One will be kept in the new India Museum, another be sent to the Secretary of State, and the third retained in case of loss. A catalogue raisonn\u00e9 will be published quarterly in the Gazette. This regulation, tending as it does towards the formation of a correct estimate of the actual condition and progress of native literature, and calculated to enable the Council to carry out their long-cherished scheme of annually reporting upon the most prominent productions of the native presses of India, may, it is hoped, exert a most salutary influence also on the tone and character of the publications themselves, and to act as a powerful stimulus to native authors, editors, publishers, and patrons.\n\nThe Council have also heard with satisfaction of the interest in scientific enquiries concerning the institutions, customs, and superstitions of India, which has been awakened in the minds of intelligent natives through Mr. Long\u2019s \u201cQuestions,\u201d\nprinted in the second number of the current series of the Journal. Such enquiries, sure to prove beneficial to those who conduct them, cannot fail to furnish valuable materials for a better understanding of the social character and habits of the various races inhabiting that country, which must demand the especial attention of this Society, under whose auspices those questions originated.\n\nWith regard to the progress of the Society's labours, the Council need only refer to the part of the Journal published at the commencement of the present year, as a proof of the range and depth of oriental research which the Society has been anxious to maintain. The forthcoming number of the Journal will contain the following papers:\n\n1. The first instalment of an Assyrian Glossary, by Mr. H. Fox Talbot, consisting of words \"of which the meaning appears to be established with a reasonable amount of probability.\" These words are not arranged in alphabetical order, nor on any obvious plan of grouping; but they are carefully numbered, and the author would add an alphabetical index, in case they should become numerous enough hereafter to require it. The Council are of opinion that in general the explanations given are correct, though there are some which will hardly command assent; at any rate, the Glossary will be useful to a student until a more comprehensive and systematic work may be had, which will probably not be for many years. A complete work cannot be expected until successive generations of scholars shall have laboured at the task. Even in a language so much studied as Hebrew, with existing translations made before it had wholly died out, the accumulated studies of twenty centuries have still left a good deal to\n\n---\n\n1 Since the above went to press, a letter has been received from the Rev. J. Long, dated Calcutta, May 18, stating that a Social Science Association has been formed at Calcutta, that frequent meetings are held, and papers of enquiry have been issued, founded mainly on his 500 questions, and that similar associations have been formed at Bombay, Lucknow, and various other places. \"It is surprising,\" he says, \"what a vast unwrought mine there is on this subject in India, and one which opens up a great and new field for the Asiatic Society.\"\naccomplish. There is only one advantage possessed by the Assyrian student, and that is one of great value, that he can in all cases appeal to the original documents without encountering any of the difficulties of a corrupt text. In Mr. Talbot's paper there is evidence that he has well considered Semitic analogies, and carefully collated the published inscriptions in search of any passages which might throw light on the word under investigation. It may be added that a large field of fresh materials for study will soon be opened out to the public in a third volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, which the Director of the Society is now employed in editing at the expense of the Trustees of the British Museum, to whom the Treasury has granted a further subvention of \u00a31,500 for the purpose. This volume will contain thirteen plates of historical inscriptions, including the hitherto unedited annals of Sardanapalus (Asshur-bani-pal), and the records on the recently-discovered monoliths from Kurkh, near Diyarbekir; together with twenty plates of astronomical observations and astrological formul\u00e6, and twenty plates of legal documents and other miscellaneous legends. The volume will, it is hoped, be completed and published during the spring of 1868.\n\n2. A paper, by Dr. A. Bastian, on the Indo-Chinese Alphabets. During his sojourn in different parts of Trans-gangetic India, the author collected twenty-five ancient and modern alphabets, which he has communicated to this Society, together with notices concerning their origin and history. A comparative table of the most important of those alphabets that have not yet been described, as well as facsimiles of several ancient inscriptions, will accompany the paper.\n\n3. A paper, by the Hon. H. E. J. Stanley, on the poems of Mohammed Rabadan, a Spanish Morisco, written in the Tunis territory, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, for the instruction of his countrymen, who, even at that time, 120 years after arriving in Africa, continued to use the\nSpanish language. Apart from the intrinsic merit of Mohammed Rabadan's poetry, and the interest attaching to this much neglected chapter of Mohammedan literature, the two poems, communicated by Mr. Stanley, in the Spanish original, from a MS. in the British Museum, are valuable to the philologist on account of the Arabic words scattered over them, and various other peculiarities.\n\n4. A Catalogue of the Persian, Arabic, and Urdu MSS. in the Library of King's College, Cambridge, by Mr. E. H. Palmer. The MSS., about 550 in number, were collected by Mr. Pote, who divided them between the Libraries of Eton College and King's College. They appear to have been part of the Oriental library of Colonel Polier. Mr. Palmer's catalogue forms a very desirable complement to the late Mr. N. Bland's account of the Eton half of Mr. Pote's collection, in the eighth volume of the Society's Journal.\n\n5. A paper, by Mr. J. Fergusson, \"On the Amr\u00e2vati Tope,\" a great Buddhist monument on the banks of the river Kistnah, near its mouth. The building first attracted the attention of Colonel Maekenzie in 1801, and was afterwards more fully explored by him in 1816-17. At this time plans were made, and a volume containing eighty-seven elaborate drawings of its sculptures, with specimens of the actual remains sent home to this country, and now existing in the possession of the Government. Subsequently Sir W. Elliot sent home upwards of one hundred and fifty slabs of marble from this monument. From these Mr. Fergusson has been able to restore the Tope and show its arrangement. It is of circular form, 195 feet in diameter, and is richer in sculptured decorations than any other relic of Buddhist architecture known to exist in India. These, besides being of greater beauty in themselves, afford a complete picture of the religious practices of the Buddhists in that part of India in the fourth or fifth century, and illustrate the legendary history of Buddha more fully than is done anywhere else. The paper will\nbe accompanied with woodcuts as well as a plate of inscriptions.\n\n6. Remarks on Professor Brockhaus' edition of the Kath\u00e2-sarit-s\u00e2gara, Lambaka ix\u2013xviii., by Dr. Kern.\n\n7. A paper, by Mr. E. Thomas, on \"Sassanian Inscriptions,\" embracing a series of ten mural and other records of the earlier monarchs of that family, with an introductory notice of the ancient alphabets in use at this period. Some of these inscriptions extend to a considerable length, and being now printed in the modern Pehlvi character, may readily be compared with and completed from the originals, for the facsimiles of which we have hitherto had to rely upon eye-copies, in many instances the work of those ignorant alike of the ancient or modern forms of the bilingual writing. Mr. Thomas' main object, in the present paper, is to draw public attention to a most interesting series of now broken inscriptions of Ardeshir B\u00e1bek, which Sir H. Rawlinson had an opportunity of partially copying from the fallen slabs which originally formed the face of the terrace of the ancient Fire Temple of P\u00e1\u00ef Kuli, and to enlist the aid of future travellers towards the development of the linguistic monuments of Persia, by placing in their hands such preparatory materials as may enable them to secure more reliable transcripts of this and other ancient inscriptions in the same character to be found in the less accessible parts of Persia.\n\n8. A paper by Professor Goldst\u00fccker on the date of K\u00e2ty\u00e2yana, the author of the V\u00e2rttikas on P\u00e2\u00f1ini. From passages occurring in Patanjali's Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2shya, Professor Goldst\u00fccker proves, that K\u00e2ty\u00e2yana was a cotemporary of Patanjali, and probably being the teacher of the latter, therefore lived in the beginning of the second century before Christ. The important inference to be drawn from this result Professor Goldst\u00fccker proposes more fully to point out in the second edition of his \"P\u00e2\u00f1ini,\" preparing for the press.\n\nAnother very important paper by the same scholar, which\nhe read at the first meeting in the present year, will commence the next following number. It is entitled \"on the Veda of the Hindus and the Veda of the German School,\" and was called forth by Mr. Muir's article \"on the Interpretation of the Veda,\" in the last published part of the Journal. In that article Mr. Muir had endeavoured to show, by a selection of instances from Y\u00e2ska's Nirukta and from S\u00e2yana's commentary, \"the unsatisfactory character of the assistance which those works afford for explaining many of the most difficult passages of the hymns, and the consequent necessity which exists, that all the other available resources of philology should be called into requisition to supply those deficiencies.\" His object more particularly was to point out either\u20141, that Y\u00e2ska and S\u00e2yana are at variance with one another in regard to the sense of particular terms; or 2, that they have each given one or more alternative explanations of many words, and cannot, therefore, be supposed to have had, in such cases, any positive knowledge of the real signification; or 3, as regards S\u00e2yana, that he expounds numerous words differently in different places, and must, therefore, in some of those instances at least, be held to have interpreted them wrongly. Though fully admitting that the Indian commentators have been of the utmost service in facilitating the comprehension of the Veda, Mr. Muir had stated it as the conclusion at which he had arrived, that there is no unusual or difficult word in the hymns in regard to which their authority should be received as final, unless it be supported by probability, by the context, or by parallel passages.\n\nOn the other hand, Professor Goldst\u00fccker shows that S\u00e2yana's principles of Vedic interpretation are based on the tradition which connects the hymns of the Veda with the Br\u00e2hma\u1e47as, and these with the subsequent religious and philosophical literature of India,\u2014a fact which he considers to be borne out by the contents of the Vedas.\n\nWith regard to the three charges brought by Mr. Muir\nagainst the trustworthiness of native interpretation, he endeavours to prove\u20141, that S\u0101yana is not at variance with Y\u0101ska, though in passages also explained by the latter he sometimes offers other renderings besides those given by Y\u0101ska; 2, that the circumstance of optional explanations occurring in the exegesis of the native commentators might, and probably must, be accounted for by the differences which existed between the various Vedic \u015a\u0101kh\u0101s or schools, inasmuch as such differences not merely related to various readings, but also to different renderings, of the Vedic texts; and 3, that it is well known that in every language words may have different meanings in different passages, and the merely individual impression derived by a scholar from the context of what may constitute to his mind a justification of such a variation, is far too unsafe a criterion to be made the basis for narrowing the meaning of words. In discussing the value of the principle that \u201cthe sense of the Vedic words must be derived from a juxtaposition of all the passages cognate in diction or contents,\u201d in which such words may occur, Professor Goldst\u00fccker points out, in conclusion, that the determining of cognateness of Vedic passages in diction, which can only mean grammatical cognateness, is one of the most difficult problems of Vedic philology, which has as yet not even been propounded; and that the above method of interpretation can be called scientific only on the assumption that all the Vedic hymns are the work of the same author, or at least belong to the same period of time, whereas it is certain that they are the production of a large number of poets, and that they belong to different periods of time, separated by intervals which, in the present condition of Sanskrit philology, it is not possible to estimate even approximately.\n\nThe principles of Vedic interpretation, advocated severally by Mr. Muir and Professor Goldst\u00fccker, representing as they do the two opposite schools of Vedic exegesis, must be held to involve some of the most important questions within the\nSociety's investigations; the Council, therefore, have felt justified in reporting upon them somewhat more in detail.\n\nIn addition to the articles about to appear in the Journal, the following papers have been read during the session:\n\n1. By Dr. Birch, \"on some Rubbings of an ancient Inscription found by the Rev. J. Edkins, at Pekin, dating from the Kin dynasty, about 700 years from the present day.\" The inscription is partly Chinese, partly Sanskrit in the Devanagari character. Dr. Birch furnished a translation of the former, recording the foundation of the temple of Hwa-yench\u00f6, at the time of the Han dynasty, and expressed a hope that the latter would engage the attention of Sanskrit scholars, and be eventually also deciphered.\n\n2. By Mr. J. d'Alwis, \"on the J\u00e2takam,\" one of the canonical books of the Southern Buddhists. The author gave his reasons for doubting the genuineness and authenticity of this work, in the form at least in which it now exists, as the word of Buddha, and for attributing also the commentary, or Aththakath\u00e2, upon it, which is generally believed to be the work of Buddhaghosa, to some Buddhist priest who lived after the ascendancy of the Mahinsaka sect in Ceylon.\n\n3. By Sir H. C. Rawlinson, \"Remarks on a paper by the late Dr. Hincks on ancient Lunar Eclipses,\" which had appeared in the Berlin \"Monatsbericht\" for September-October 1866. The Doctor believed he had found, in a cuneiform fragment recently published by Sir H. Rawlinson, a record of three lunar eclipses which were observed at Nineveh B.C. 701-699; and he proposed, from these observations, to correct the lunar tables in modern use. Sir Henry, however, regarded the inscription as a gloss, or commentary, of an Assyrian writer on an ancient astrological formula, the principal object being to explain expressions which belonged to another race, and had become unintelligible at Nineveh in the time of Sardanapalus, or about B.C. 660, which might be\nassumed as the date of the tablet. There were several hundreds of fragments in the British Museum similar to those few that Dr. Hincks had seen, and it was to be hoped that, from a careful examination and comparison of these fragments, a correct idea might be ultimately obtained of the system of solar, lunar, and stellar movement, upon which the primitive Chald\u00e6ans, and their imitators, the Assyrians, founded their astrological science.\n\n4. By the Rev. D. Sanderson, \"on the Jaimini Bh\u00e2rata.\" The author of this most famous work in Canarese literature was Lakshmi\u015ba, a Vish\u1e47uquite Brahman, who is stated to have lived a little more than two hundred years ago. The subject of his poem, of which Mr. Sanderson gave an analysis, is the horse-sacrifice described in the A\u1e63vamedhika parvan of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata, and this the poet amplifies and makes the occasion of introducing a variety of details, on which he lavishes all the ability and ingenuity so characteristic of the finest oriental poetry. Mr. Sanderson quoted a variety of stanzas, both in the old Canarese, and in a literal translation into English, as specimens of the exuberance of imagination displayed by the poet, and of the ease and beauty of his language.\n\n5. By Dr. A. V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, \"on the Ou\u00efgour language and literature.\" Of all the Muhammedan-Turkish dialects, as distinguished from the non-Muhammedan, he considered, he said, the Ou\u00efgour as the most important from a philological point of view, it being the oldest dialect and the one least influenced by the Arabic and Persian languages. After passing in review the labours of previous Orientalists in the same field of enquiry, and detailing some of the difficulties attending the deciphering of the Ou\u00efgour written character, he proceeded to give an account of the scanty Ou\u00efgour literature as represented by the few manuscripts existing in the libraries of Europe, more especially of the Kudatku Bilik, or Blessed Science, which was the oldest known Ou\u00efgour book, having\nbeen written eight hundred years ago. Dr. V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry proposed to prepare for publication an Ou\u00efgour Chrestomathy on the plan followed in his work on the Jagata\u00ef language, a copy of which he laid on the table, comprising an anthology (with translation), grammar and dictionary, and he solicited for this undertaking the Society's countenance and support.\n\n6. By the Rev. S. Beal, \"Legends selected from a Chinese Buddhist work, called Tah-kai-ngan-lih-to,\" which is a systematic treatise on the character of the Buddhist universe, and is especially valuable as containing numerous extracts from original Sanskrit works of much importance, and now either lost or unknown. The legend which was read at the meeting as a specimen, gives a detailed account of the war between the Asuras and Devas, and is accompanied by the Chinese editor with moral reflections, somewhat after the fashion of the symbolical application in the \"Gesta Romanorum\" and similar favourite story-books of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Council cannot close this survey of their labours without adverting to an event which, in itself, is of much interest to Oriental scholars, and must be so more especially to this Society whose exertion and influence have mainly brought it about. Early in 1863, a memorial signed by the President and Council of the Royal Asiatic Society was presented to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, setting forth the advantages that would accrue to the University from the institution of a professorship of Sanskrit, in reference, not only to the interests of literature and science, but also to the public service of this country, and urging upon his attention the claims which this department of learning, left heretofore unrepresented by a separate professional chair, possessed to be included in a course of academical instruction. The Council have now the gratification to state that the recommendation made by them four years ago has not been lost sight of by the University authorities, and that the Council of the Senate have recently made a proposition to the effect that a Sanskrit\nProfessorship shall be established in the University, and that \"it shall be the duty of the Professor to teach the principles of the Sanskrit language, to explain its bearing upon the Greek and Latin and other kindred languages, including the vernacular dialects of India, and generally to apply himself to the advancement of the knowledge of the Sanskrit language and literature, and to the promotion of their study in the University.\"\n\nIn the face of these evidences of literary exertion and increased usefulness on the part of the Society, it is with regret that the Council announce that the number of elections has been so much below, and that of the losses by death, and more especially by retirement, in excess of, the average during the session. The losses by death have been twelve, including one Honorary, one Corresponding, and one Foreign Member, and nine Resident and two non-Resident Members have retired; whereas only the names of five Resident and eight non-Resident Members have been added to the roll.\u00b9 But it is well-known that these withdrawals are principally attributable to the same especial causes that have temporarily affected the prosperity of various similar institutions connected with the East. The Council, therefore, far from seeing in the present accidental diminution of the effective status of the Society any cause for alarm or discouragement, are confident that, as the value and excellence of its investigations becomes more widely known and more deservedly appreciated, new mem-\n\n\u00b9 Elections.\u2014Resident: Lord W.

Foreign: Professor Reinaud.\nbers will not fail to be enrolled among its ranks\u2014men of learning and ability to co-operate in its work, and men of wealth and influence to add to its strength.\n\nOf the deceased Members the following are entitled to special notice:\n\nBenjamin Guy Babington, M.D., F.R.S., was the third son of the late William Babington, M.D., F.R.S., a member of the Irish branch of the ancient family of Babington, which was settled at the Conquest in Northumberland, and afterwards, for centuries, at Rothley Temple, in Leicestershire. He was born on the 5th of March, 1794, in Guy\u2019s Hospital, of which institution his father was then resident medical officer. The subject of this notice was educated at the Charterhouse from 1803 to 1807. He then went to sea as a midshipman in H.M.\u2019s Frigate la Sybelle, and was on the second expedition to Copenhagen, when all the Danish fleet was brought away in 1807, and in the Bucephalus Frigate on the Walcheren expedition in 1809. He left the navy in 1810, having obtained from his connexion in the East India Direction, Mr. Hudleston, a writership. He then went to Haileybury College; stayed there two years, and in the spring of 1812 sailed for India, arriving at Madras in August of that year. He remained at Madras two years, during which time he acquired a thorough knowledge of the Tamil language, so that he was made deputy translator to Government in that language. He also acquired some knowledge of Sanskrit, which enabled him to decipher and translate the inscriptions at Mah\u00e1malaip\u00far, thirty miles from Madras, which were previously supposed to be in an unknown lost character and language (see Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s Transactions, II. 258, ff., where the Doctor\u2019s paper on the above-mentioned inscriptions, with alphabets, drawings, etc. is published.) In 1814, after paying a few weeks\u2019 visit to his elder brother Stephen, then in the Bombay Civil Service, Dr. Babington started with the traveller Buckingham, who\nwas then at Bombay, to go home via the Red Sea and Egypt. The whole journey from Bombay to England, including a stay of three or four weeks at Cairo, occupied thirteen months. The Doctor stayed in England less than a year; married Anna Mary, daughter of Mr. Fayle, a London merchant, and returned to Madras with his wife in 1817, performing the voyage round the Cape. After a few months' stay at Madras he was appointed on a Revenue mission as secretary to Mr. H. S. Gream; and, leaving his wife at Madras, went with him to Calicut. They had only been there two months when they were ordered by Government to the Province of Canara, to investigate charges against a civilian, who was accused of taking bribes from the natives. This enquiry occupied several months, and was not finished, when the Doctor's health gave way, and he was obliged to return to Madras, whence, with his wife and a son Benjamin, he proceeded on sick leave to England. Such had been the nature and degree of his attack, and so affected by the climate had also been his wife, that he made up his mind never to return to India; and having resolved, by the advice of his father, to adopt the medical profession, he entered as a student at Guy's Hospital, and went through a complete course of professional education there. At the end of the year 1819 he entered as a fellow Commoner at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He graduated there in medicine, and at the end of four years took the degree of M.B. Two years afterwards he commenced practice, having passed the Cambridge Examination for license to practice. At the end of thirteen years he took his final degree of M.D., and was admitted in due course to the London College of Physicians as an inceptor candidate, a candidate, and ultimately as a fellow.\n\nIt would be beyond the limit of this report if more than a brief mention were made of his long career as one of the leading physicians of the metropolis, and of the various posts of honour in his profession which he successively filled to the\ntime of his death, on the 5th of April, 1865. They were stated in detail in the medical periodicals soon after his death.\n\nDr. Babington was an excellent linguist, combining with his oriental scholarship a thorough acquaintance with various European languages, especially French, German, and Italian, all of which he spoke fluently.\n\nIn the year 1826 he undertook the office of Honorary Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, but was obliged to resign it in December of 1828, on finding that it interfered too much with his professional engagements.\n\nWhile in India Dr. Babington contributed to the *Oriental Herald* various articles on subjects connected with Tamil literature. In 1822 his English translation of Beschi\u2019s Grammar of the High Dialect of the Tamil Language was printed at Madras, which is, by all competent authorities, considered to be a very correct and scholarlike edition of a masterly work. In the same year he brought out \u201cThe adventures of the Gooroo Paramartan,\u201d a tale in the Tamil language, accompanied by a translation and vocabulary; together with an analysis of the first story. This was the first Tamil text printed in London, and together with Mr. Anderson\u2019s Grammar, served for a long time to facilitate the study of that language in this country. Lastly, his translation of the \u201cVed\u00e2la Cadai,\u201d which is the Tamil version of the well-known popular Sanskrit story-book, called the \u201cVet\u00e2la panchavinsati,\u201d was printed for the Oriental Translation Fund in 1831, and forms part of its first volume of \u201cMiscellaneous Translations.\u201d\n\nSir George Everest, C.B., was born at Gwernvale, Brecon, on the 4th July, 1790. On the completion of his scientific education at Woolwich, he passed such a brilliant examination that he was declared fit for a commission, though he had not yet attained the proper age. In 1806 he sailed for Bengal, and was, after about a year\u2019s ordinary military duty, posted to a detachment in the island of Java, and selected by\nSir S. Raffles to execute a reconnoitring survey of the country. The varied experience which he gained in the performance of this duty must have tended to enlarge his geographical views, and to prepare him for the great works on which he was subsequently so successfully engaged. On his return to India, in 1816, he was employed in various engineering operations, and was selected by Government, two years after, to be chief assistant to Colonel Lambton, the celebrated founder of the great Trigonometrical Survey of India, whom he eventually, in 1823, succeeded in the office of superintendent. Captain Everest now proceeded at once to concentrate the resources at his command for the extension of the great arc series, and succeeded, in spite of formidable difficulties of every kind, in carrying the measurement at length to the latitude of $24^\\circ$, when it was terminated by the Sironj base line.\n\nDuring his temporary sojourn in England, Colonel Everest made himself acquainted with the English Ordnance Survey system and with every modern improvement in geodetical matters, and returned to India in 1830, liberally provided, by the munificence of the Hon. Court of Directors, with geodetical instruments and apparatus of every description, which were superior to any in the world. In addition to his ordinary duties, he had now to perform also those of Surveyor-General of India. At the end of 1832, after an interval of seven years, the great arc was recommenced, and the work was terminated in 1841 with the measurement of the Beder base line, executed by his chief assistant and astronomer Captain (now Major-General Sir) Andrew Scott Waugh, C.B., and the whole Indian arc from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya mountains, forming the main axis of Indian geography, was thus completed. The Asiatic Society of Bengal, in nominating him one of their Honorary Members, laid particular stress on this splendid achievement. \"By the light it throws on researches into the figure and dimensions of the earth, it forms one of the most valuable contributions to that branch\nof science which we possess, whilst at the same time it constitutes a foundation for the geography of Northern India, the integrity of which must for ever stand unquestioned.\u201d After Sir George Everest\u2019s departure from India, in December, 1843, his successor, Sir A. S. Waugh, paid him a well-deserved compliment by naming after him the highest mountain measured in the Himalayas\u2014Mount Everest. Sir George died in London, 1st December, 1866.\n\nHis contributions to the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, between the years 1832\u201340, are valuable and numerous. He also presented some important papers to the Royal, the Royal Astronomical, and the Royal Geographical Societies. His two great works, containing the results of his operations connected with the great Trigonometrical Survey of India, appeared, the former in 1830, the latter in 1847.\n\nMr. Richard Haughton was the eldest son of Dr. Haughton, a branch of the ancient family of Haughton, of Haughton Tower, in Lancashire, and was born the 27th March, 1782, in the County of Wicklow. Much of his early life was spent with a relation, who possessed landed property in the county of Wicklow, and having no children, expressed a wish to make him his heir, and in consequence requested his parents not to give him a profession. Nevertheless, gifted as he was with considerable taste for literature and the fine arts, there were few branches of study which his active mind did not embrace. Even surgery and medicine were followed up to a certain point, but painting and the study of languages were his favourite pursuits. For the former he evinced so much talent that some of the first artists of the day tried to induce him to follow it as a profession, feeling sure of his success.\n\nOn the death of his relative, Mr. Haughton, finding the estate had not been left to him, devoted himself to the study of the Oriental languages, and, with considerable difficulty, obtained permission to reside at Paris, where he remained for a period of four years, to enable him to profit by the lectures\nand teaching of the Oriental scholars there. Among these he formed several lasting friendships, more especially with the late Baron de Sacy, with whom he maintained a correspondence for a very long time afterwards, also with M. La Grange, M. Ch\u00e9zy, and others. As early as the year 1826, Mr. Haughton had collected materials for the compilation of a Persian Grammar and Dictionary, but was compelled to abandon the project from a threatening of paralysis of the nerve of the left eye. He was appointed Professor of Oriental Languages at Addiscombe, in 1820, where he was much beloved and respected. In the midst of his labours, in 1851, he was afflicted with loss of sight. The most celebrated oculists were consulted, and pronounced that the malady arose from over-work, and that the evil could only be mitigated by perfect rest. Mr. Haughton immediately sent in his resignation to the Court of Directors, but, from an over-sensitive regard to what he considered his duty, remained at his post until a suitable successor could be found. This delay was most unfortunate, as it precluded all hope of recovery. Broken health soon succeeded, and obliged him to pass the remaining sixteen years of his life in seclusion, surrounded by children and grandchildren, to whom his beautiful patience and resignation were a daily example; while his truly capacious mind was a rich storehouse of knowledge ever at their command. Mr. Haughton died at Ramsgate on the 5th April of the present year.\n\nThe Rev. Edward Hincks, D.D., was born at Cork, the 19th August, 1792. He was educated by his father until 1807, when he entered Trinity College, Dublin, as pensioner; he was elected Scholar in 1810, took his degree of A.B. in 1811, and received the Gold Medal. He was appointed rector of Killyleagh in 1825, and resided there constantly till his death on the 3rd December of last year. Dr. Hincks has, through a long life, been distinguished by a peculiar talent for decipherment, and many years before entering upon the field of\nEgyptian and Cuneiform discovery, he gave a remarkable proof of his extraordinary power. R. Chenevix, Esq., in the year 1821, in a paper on Secret Writing, printed in the tenth volume of the \"Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and Art,\" proposed a cipher which he believed could not possibly be read, and, in proof of the sincerity of his convictions, he concluded his paper by declaring that the first person, of any country whatever, who should read this cipher, and would communicate his reading, through the Journal of Science, by the end of 1822, should receive a prize of \u00a3100. Dr. Hincks answered this proposal by a paper \"on Secret Writing, in reply to Mr. Chenevix's Challenge,\" printed in the same Journal in 1822, and which proved so satisfactory that Mr. Chenevix at once forwarded him a cheque for the sum offered, accompanied by a very handsome letter to the sagacious decipherer, who, it is said, occupied but a few days in getting at the solution of the problem.\n\nDr. Hincks' first essay in antiquarian decipherment was directed to the Egyptian Hieroglyphics, and his first paper was addressed to the Dublin University Review, in 1833. The remoteness of his residence from any place where access could be had to collections of papyri or monuments of any sort, precluded the possibility of his following up this study as he could have desired; but his interest in this branch of palaeography is shown by near a dozen papers printed in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, from 1838 to 1854; and the reality of his knowledge may be estimated by the statement of Dr. Brugsch, printed in the third volume of the German Oriental Society's Journal, that previously to his own more complete researches, prosecuted in the midst of the papyri in the Berlin Museum, Dr. Hincks was the first man who had followed the true methods of enquiry.\n\nAbout 1846, Dr. Hincks appears to have first turned his attention to the Cuneiform records of Western Asia\u2014a subject more immediately interesting to a Society whose Journal has\nbeen the channel of communicating to the learned of Europe the acute investigations and important discoveries of Sir H. C. Rawlinson, from their commencement in Persia, now thirty years ago, to the present moment. Dr. Hincks broke ground in this branch of the investigation by contributing to the Royal Irish Academy's Transactions of 1846 a paper upon the so-called Persian and Median Inscriptions, and soon after others upon those of Babylonia; the Assyrian inscriptions being then almost wholly unknown. The first paper of Dr. Hincks, printed in this Society's Journal, was read at the close of 1847, and printed in its ninth volume. This was an elaborate paper, investigating the alphabet and language of the inscriptions copied by the unfortunate Schulz, at Van, in Armenia, and printed in the Journal Asiatique for 1840. The Doctor endeavoured to prove that the language of these inscriptions was of the Indo-Germanic class, and that the alphabet was essentially the same as that employed by the Babylonians; in the latter view he was no doubt perfectly right. The former view has been controverted, and was afterwards modified by himself, though it was probably correct in the main; but as the inscriptions of Van had been too incorrectly copied to be the object of severe critical investigation, the subject has not, to our knowledge, been since resumed. The paper exhibited strongly the peculiar analytical powers of the author, and has been useful to investigators into the values of the Assyrian characters.\n\nThe discovery of the true vowel system of the Persian Cuneiform alphabet, showing that each consonant had its own inherent vowel \\(a\\), \\(i\\), or \\(u\\), which made a diphthong when followed by a different vowel, was made independently by Dr. Hincks and Sir H. Rawlinson, the one at Killyleagh, printed in the 21st volume of the Royal Irish Academy's Transactions; the other at Baghdad, which reached England in October, 1846, and was printed at p. 175 of the memoir in the 10th volume of the Society's Journal. This seemingly\nunimportant discovery was really of great value to the scientific philologer. It enabled him to explain many seeming anomalies in the grammatical structure of the language, bringing it into direct analogy with Sanskrit, and got rid of some letters of the alphabet, such as the double forms of n, r, m, g, t, etc., which were inconsistent with the character of the language, or at least superfluous.\n\nShortly after the publication of Sir H. Rawlinson's memoir on the Behistun Monument, it was reviewed by Dr. Hincks in an excellent paper, which was printed in the Dublin University Magazine for January, 1847, under the title \"some passages in the life of King Darius, the son of Hystaspes, by himself.\" This was a learned, and at the same time popular and interesting review, giving a succinct history of the decipherment and interpretation of the Persian inscriptions from Grotefend, in 1802, through Rask, Jacquet, Beer, Burnouf, and Lassen, to its culmination under the Director of this Society, and containing criticisms upon all concerned, which were unsparingly, but, on the whole, justly apportioned.\n\nDr. Hincks' activity continued unabated to the last, and he posted with his own hands, the day before his death, a paper relating to a supposed record of eclipses printed in the \"Monatsbericht\" of the Berlin Academy for September-October, 1866.\n\nAmong his discoveries mention may be made of those of the name of Nebuchadnezzar on the great East India House slab, printed in the Literary Gazette of 27th June, 1846; of Sennacherib in his memoir on the Khorsabad inscription, in the Royal Irish Academy's Transactions for 1849; the identity of a fragmentary inscription published by Ker Porter in 1820 (pl. 78) with parts of the Hieratic Inscription on the East India House slab (Literary Gazette, July 1846) which afforded a fair basis for the decipherment of Hieratic writing; and lastly the first determination of dates\nof any Assyrian inscription, that of King Sargina, in a letter to the Literary Gazette in the year 1848.\n\nOne of the most valuable papers of Dr. Hincks was a treatise \"on the Assyrian verbs,\" printed in the Journal of Sacred Literature for July and October, 1855, and April and July, 1856. This is a systematic and detailed treatise on Assyrian grammar, so far as relates to the triliteral verbs, with incidental notices of the imperfect verbs, comparing their forms with those of all the other Semitic languages, and largely illustrating them by reference to passages in the inscriptions. The sole drawback on the value of this treatise is purely typographical, the printer not possessing a font of the cuneiform types required for the work, found it necessary to supply the defect by numerals, of which no list is printed, so that it is very troublesome and difficult to find, in any case, what word is intended. Every student, however, who may have taken the pains to render these numerals in the ordinary cuneiform character will find his labour fully repaid; and a reprint, with this transcription, would be welcome to every Assyriologist. But for the decease of the author he would, probably, have done this himself in the grammar, of which the first portion is printed in the last issued part of the Society's Journal. It appears now certain that no continuation of this grammar can be expected; Dr. Hincks' papers have been sent to London for the examination of a member of this Society, who has read every sheet very carefully, but has found in them nothing whatever on this subject, except a few unimportant notes relative to matter already printed; and it would appear that Dr. Hincks, in his compositions, trusted to a retentive memory, and threw off, without any preliminary preparation, the valuable results of his unwearied labours.\n\nThe Library has, in addition to continuations of the Transactions of learned Societies at home and abroad, and various other donations, been enriched by the liberality of the committee of the Architectural Antiquities of Western India,\nwith a copy of the four magnificent volumes as yet published for them. Each of the first three volumes illustrates a separate and distinct phase of Eastern architecture, and is accompanied with a double introduction, one on the history, and the other on the architecture, of the locality and period represented in the photographs. They thus form most valuable contributions towards a complete history of the Hindu and Muhammedan styles of art. Among the photographs from which the materials to these three volumes were selected, there were found about sixty inscriptions in both the ancient Gupta and more modern characters, which have been collected in a fourth volume, with a view to stimulate further researches in the vast field of Indian record to which they belong.\n\nFrom the report of the Sanskrit Text Society, which will appear in one of its next publications, we are happy to learn that its appeal has been liberally responded to by many distinguished Maharajahs, Rajahs, and gentlemen of influence in India, and that the Society is likely, therefore, to realize the hopes which all those interested in the propagation of the best works of Sanskrit literature entertain of its merits. As in the beginning of its existence much time is required by the editors of the Society for their preparatory labour, the Society, in order to commence its operations, was especially glad to avail itself of a work, the printing of which had been already commenced by Professor Goldst\u00fccker many years ago, and will now be probably completed at the end of this year\u2014the Jaimin\u00eeyany\u00e2yam\u00e2lavistara by M\u00e2dhav\u00e2ch\u00e2rya, which, according to the judgment of Colebrooke and all competent scholars, is \"the most improved introduction to the study of the M\u00eem\u00e2ms\u00e2\" philosophy, and a knowledge of which is the more requisite in the present condition of Vedic studies, as it is indispensable for a proper understanding of the celebrated Vedic commentaries of the same author, where it is constantly referred to with more or less detail. The next works\nintended for publication by the Society are the Yoga S\u00fbtras, with the Commentary of Vy\u00e2sa, which is far advanced in preparation by Mr. Edward B. Cowell; the K\u00e0sik\u00e2vritti, and the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2shya of Patanjali with the Commentaries of Kaiyya\u1e6da and N\u00e0gojibha\u1e6d\u1e6da. With the edition of the latter works, the materials for which have been collected and prepared for upwards of 25 years by Professor Goldst\u00fccker, it is his intention to combine a full commentary of his own, embodying the substance of the principal other grammatical works of Sanskrit literature.\n\nAuditors' Report.\n\nYour auditors having examined the accounts of the past year, and compared them with the vouchers, find them correct. They have also formed a careful estimate of the income and expenditure for the ensuing year, and anticipate that the income will suffice to meet the outgoings without trenching on the balance in the Bankers' hands at the beginning of the year.\n\nNEIL B. E. BAILLIE, Auditor for the Council.\nJ. FERGUSON,\nH. LEWIS,\n\nAuditors for the Society.\n\nThe reading of the Report being concluded, Sir H. C. Rawlinson moved, and Mr. E. C. Ravenshaw seconded, the first resolution, which was carried nem. con.: \"That the Report of the Council and of the Auditors be received and adopted, and that the best thanks of the meeting be presented to Sir Edward Colebrooke for his constant attention to the affairs of the Society, and his unwearied exertions to promote its interests.\"\n\nSir Edward Colebrooke, the President, returned thanks for the compliment conveyed to himself in the motion which had just been made. He accepted it in the same spirit in which he had originally undertaken the honourable office which he had been invited to hold, rather as a mark of\nrespect for a name which was so intimately associated in the mind of every scholar with the history of Asiatic research, and with the foundation of this Society, than on account of any claim he could himself possess to hold a position of such dignity. He had indeed felt it a privilege to preside during the past three years over their meetings, and had the highest satisfaction, now that his term of office was about to expire, to be able to render on behalf of the Council a Report which, on the whole, was favourable to the Society's finances, and still more so in regard to the proofs of literary activity recorded both in the proceedings of their meetings and in their published Journal. He spoke of it as the Report of the Council, though it would be just to say that it was, with little variation from the original sketch, the work of their valuable secretary. It differed in one respect from that of last year. While giving a full account of the labours of this society it took no survey of those of kindred societies, both in Europe and in the East, which were reviewed in our last Report. It was thought that such a review would prove more interesting when given at certain intervals, as it might be rendered more comprehensive and convey a clearer view of the general progress of Eastern literature. Sir E. Colebrooke thought there was an advantage in this course, and he adverted to it on the present occasion to satisfy the members of the Society that the Council had not lost sight of this useful and, indeed, important object, which had occupied their attention in former years.\n\nOf the subjects embraced in the Report, few, he thought, would prove more gratifying than those which gave evidence of the appreciation, on the part of the public, of the ancient and modern literature of India. The liberal endowment of a Professorship of Sanskrit at the University of Cambridge was in itself a most important event, as it was the first occasion on which there had been an independent recognition by one of our great seats of learning of this branch of study.\nHe need not remind the Society that the endowment of the Professorship at Oxford had been wholly, and that in Edinburgh had been primarily, acts of private munificence.\n\nThe progress of the labours of the Sanskrit Text Society afforded another subject of congratulation; the more so as so large a portion of the funds contributed to its support came from the natives of India. Lastly, that important act of the Indian Government, also referred to in the Report, and which this Society might claim a share in promoting, if not originating, would ensure to this country what was much wanted, a perfect record of the literature and science of modern India, and enable men of letters to measure their progress. Great advantages could not fail to accrue from this measure to India itself. In proportion as the whole of the modern as well as the ancient literature was brought under one view, would the labours of students be facilitated, and an incentive be applied to our fellow labourers in the East.\n\nReverting to the labours of this Society, though the sketch which the report gave of the proceedings at our meetings might not prove attractive to those who on such occasions expected popular or exciting discussions, they showed equally with our published transactions an active spirit of research, and he thought fully maintained the high standard at which the Society had aimed. On this subject he spoke as one jealous for the reputation of this Society and on national grounds. Our countrymen had taken a lead in promoting the study of Eastern literature and science, and we owe the public support we receive to the belief that we labour not unworthily in the same field. Have we fully maintained the position we once held? The reflection was suggested to him on reading a letter of his father's which came with many others recently into his possession through the kindness of the family of the late Professor Wilson. It was addressed to that gentleman by Mr. Colebrooke nearly forty years since, and was not without application in the present day. It was\nwritten towards the close of his literary career, and in a few striking sentences commented on the want of appreciation which their joint labours had met with on the part of their countrymen, and pointed significantly to the continent of Europe as the quarter to which the public was to look for their successors. The passage was as follows:\n\n\"I rejoice to learn that your great work on the Indian drama may be so soon expected by us. I anticipate much gratification from the perusal. Careless and indifferent as our countrymen are, I think nevertheless you and I may derive some complacent feelings from the reflection that following the footsteps of Sir W. Jones, we have, with so little aid of co-laborators and so little encouragement, opened nearly every avenue, and left it to foreigners, who are taking up the clue we have furnished, to complete the outline of what we have sketched. It is some gratification to national pride that the opportunity which we English have enjoyed has not been wholly unemployed.\"\n\nOn reading this two reflections would naturally suggest themselves. Has this outline been filled up? and has England taken its full share in the labour? A partial answer to the first of these questions was to be found in some of the papers which appeared in our recent transactions. It was certainly discouraging to find a growing opinion among Sanskrit scholars that we were on the very threshold of a critical interpretation of some of the ancient records regarding which we had hoped to have arrived at some certain knowledge. It could not be denied that there were grounds for this opinion, more especially when we consider that our main reliance for guidance rests on a modern commentary, of which we may almost speak as belonging to our own time, when we compare the interval by which we are separated from its author with the whole period which has elapsed since the\nappearance of the more ancient Vedic writings. It must be admitted, too, that the multiplied instances which have been adduced by Dr. Muir, in his late paper, in proof of the inconsistent interpretations which have been attached to the same words and expressions by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, are calculated to raise the gravest doubts whether we are yet in a position to measure critically the value of some branches of Vedic literature. It is, therefore, with interest we must look forward to the appearance of Dr. Goldst\u00fccker's paper, which was read at a recent meeting, and will appear in our next number, and in which an able effort has been made to restore our confidence in those commentaries which were the leading guides of early Vedic students.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Sir Edward Colebrooke thought that we had before us a sufficient body of facts to reassure us on the main points of literary interest which were involved in the controversy.\n\nIt was to be observed that the doubts which have been expressed apply chiefly to one branch (to us certainly a most important one) of the ancient literature, viz., the hymns. It was admitted with regard to the ritualistic and doctrinal works that there was evidence of critical study and research applied to them on the part of their commentators which justified the confidence that had been placed in the traditional interpretation. The acuteness displayed in unravelling the intricacies of the ceremonial law and doctrine might therefore serve the interests of history in dealing with those branches of the old literature which throw light on the civil antiquities of the Aryan race. Again, with regard to the hymns themselves, it was admitted that a large portion of them were capable of being rendered without any further labour than of necessity belong to so obsolete a dialect, joined to the imperfect knowledge of the early events which they refer to. It was interesting to observe that while the controversy is in progress we have been favoured with a specimen of Vedic\ninterpretation, and with some remarks on the questions involved, from the pen of one of the most accomplished of modern scholars. The paper which appeared in our last journal should be read in connection with those already adverted to. In it Professor Max M\u00fcller's statements as to the difficulties which belong to this study, and especially as to the bounds within which, according to his views, our doubts should be allowed to have sway, ought to carry the greater weight, because his opinion and authority have been appealed to by either party in the controversy. No one has more emphatically declared that in many cases \"the work of interpretation becomes really a work of deciphering, and that the obscurity which belongs to words and phrases in these ancient hymns is so perplexing, that the labours of Sanskrit scholars have as yet done little to clear our way.\" Indeed, he affirms that \"for many years a really satisfactory translation of the whole of the Rig-veda will be impossible.\" But other passages in the same article, though dwelling in equally strong terms on the errors and corruptions of the text, give most important testimony to the value of Vedic tradition as represented by modern commentators, especially where he says that he is impressed as strongly as ever that \"all interpretation of the Vedic hymns must begin with an examination of the traditional explanations collected by S\u0101ya\u1e47a.\"\n\nThese, indeed, are words of encouragement, and justify the hope that no real danger can arise from the critical study which is advocated by German scholars. Indeed, Sir Edward Colebrooke would express a hope that these apparently opposite views might admit of being reconciled, and that we might at the same time uphold the credit of this body of commentaries, and find an inexhaustible field for the most profound and critical learning.\n\nAnother topic of even greater interest at the present day, on account of the light which had been thrown on some of the most ancient seats of civilization, called for a brief notice,\nand Sir Edward Colebrooke adverted to it chiefly with the view of inviting some remarks from our accomplished Director. He must, in the first place, however, congratulate the Society upon the exertions made by its members who had laboured in this field to reduce to scientific order what was known of the ancient language of the Assyrians. He could not but feel the liveliest interest in what had already appeared from the pen of Mr. Norris and the late Dr. Hincks on this subject. In the absence of some scientific analysis of the language which was the vehicle of the ancient inscriptions, the interpretation which had been offered to the world must be open to some of the doubts against which Assyrian students have had to contend. The contributions to our knowledge of grammar and the commencement of vocabularies or dictionaries offered a fair challenge to sceptics to examine and judge for themselves, and he thought justified the confidence which the Society had placed in the result of their labours. Of the importance of such aids to students it would be unnecessary to speak.\n\nReferring to the labours of Sir Henry Rawlinson, though a long promised paper on the traces of Chaldean astronomy, which are to be found in the Assyrian tablets and inscriptions, was still wanting to our journal, we were the more readily reconciled to this, as a larger and more important work, on which he had been so long engaged, was shortly to appear. He must advert on this occasion to an interesting letter which had appeared in a recent number of the Atheneum announcing a very important discovery, which he thought would prove of the highest value as connected with the chronology of the period to which it referred. In it Sir Henry had laid before us strong grounds for supposing that the solar eclipse, of which he found a notice, could be identified with one known to astronomers, and as it was found in one of a series of tablets which formed a sort of official calendar, it might serve to fix an epoch which would regulate\nthe series. There were great advantages in announcing a discovery of this importance in a popular paper of considerable circulation; but, for the benefit of science, it was to be wished that they could appear in publications where they could be more fully developed and have a permanent record. The facts now before us were too briefly stated to enable us to give a critical opinion of their importance; and Sir Edward Colebrooke trusted that on this and other matters on which Sir Henry Rawlinson had been recently engaged he would favour us with his views at the present meeting.\n\nSir Edward Colebrooke concluded his address by saying that though he was now about to retire from the chair which he had, owing to the favour of this learned body, occupied during the past three years, he should continue to take a deep interest in the labours of the Society, and trusted he should never be wanting in exertions to promote its prosperity.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson, in obedience to the invitation of the President, proceeded to explain how, in the course of his recent Chaldaean studies, he had been enabled, amongst other results, to identify a certain solar eclipse observed at Nineveh in the eighth century B.C., and had thus succeeded in fixing, on a determinate basis, the chronology of the Assyrian and Jewish kingdoms to as early a date as 910 B.C. He stated that a very considerable number of the clay tablets contained in the Nineveh collections of the British Museum, referred to celestial phenomena, and that among these phenomena eclipses occupied a prominent place. So strangely crude, however, were the notions of the early Babylonians, from whom the Assyrians seemed to have derived their knowledge on the subject of the nature and movements of the heavenly bodies, that very rarely could the record of their observations be made available for any useful or scientific purpose. They certainly noted and registered the rising and setting of the stars, and were acquainted with the paths both of the sun and moon in the heavens, but so far as could be ascer-\ntained from the Assyrian transcripts of the old Registers, or from the Observatory Reports and other astronomical data recorded at Nineveh, the object of all the so-called science of the Chald\u00e6ans\u2014with the solitary exception, perhaps, of regulating the calendar\u2014was to determine the influence of the heavenly bodies on sublunary matters, and thus to furnish hand-books for popular use, entirely analogous to the modern takwims. It thus happened that, although eclipses of the sun and moon were commonly referred to on the astronomical and astrological tablets of Nineveh, in no one case had it been possible as yet to identify the observation from which the prognostics were derived, so as to bring the record within the pale of modern science. That result had been obtained through the incidental notice of a solar eclipse in a document of an entirely different class, a document belonging to the chronological and not to the astronomical series of Cuneiform Tablets. It had been long known and had been, indeed, frequently noticed in the Reports of the Royal Asiatic Society, that the Assyrians dated their years from certain annual officers called Lim\u00fas,\u2014as the Athenians dated from Archons, and the Romans from Consuls; and that from many fragments of tablets referring to these Lim\u00fas, or \u201cEponymes,\u201d it had been possible to construct an almost complete list of names\u2014or, in fact, a chronological table\u2014arranged according to the duration of the successive reigns of the Assyrian kings, and extending for about 270 years, between the limits of the close of the tenth century and the middle of the seventh century B.C. As this table, or Assyrian Canon as it had been called, could be compared in its later portion with the Babylonian Canon of Ptolemy, its place in the history of the world had been already approximately fixed, but exactitude and verification were still wanting; and it was of great importance therefore to the science of chronology, that upon a fragment in the Museum, which had long been a puzzle to Assyrian scholars, but which now turned out to be a portion of an\nannotated copy of the Canon, the record of a solar eclipse should have been found in the third month of the eighteenth year previous to the accession of the Biblical Tiglath-Pileser; this notice exactly agreeing with the calculations of modern science, which showed that the eclipse of June 15, 763 B.C. was almost total at Nineveh, and the means being thus afforded, through the lining of the Eponyme Tables or \"Canon,\" of determining, on a basis of mathematical precision, the date of all these salient events of Jewish history which were mentioned in the Assyrian annals, or which coincided with fixed points in Assyrian history. Sir Henry had published in the Athen\u00e6um of May 20th a skeleton table of such dates, from which the Biblical Chronology between Ahab and Josiah would have to be reconstructed, and he still hoped to give the details of his calculations and the text of the passages on which they were founded in a paper on the Assyrian Canon, which for some years past he had been engaged in preparing for publication in the Society's Journal.\n\nSir Henry further explained that he was now employed in printing in the third volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, and at the expense of the Trustees of the British Museum, a tolerably extensive series of astronomical and astrological tablets from Nineveh. It was much to be regretted that these tablets were for the most part in a very mutilated and imperfect condition; for the information they contained, though of no scientific value, was certainly curious in revealing to us the first glimmerings of that astronomical knowledge, which afterwards, in the hands of the mathematicians of Greece, bore such noble fruits. Sir Henry had collected a list of the Babylonian and Assyrian names of some three hundred of the fixed stars, a considerable number of which admitted of identification; and there were also several hundred notices of the position of the moon in reference to these stars, or to the sun and planets. Many of the technical terms were very difficult of explanation, depending probably on notions of astral mythology, which were now\nentirely lost to us; but still Sir Henry believed that a conscientious and exhaustive examination and comparison of the tablets would yield some positive results, in showing us at any rate what the Proto-Chaldeans and their Assyrian imitators thought generally of the movements of the heavenly bodies, as well as of their nature and properties. Sir Henry had been now for several years engaged in such an examination, and had only partially overcome its difficulties; but he was not discouraged, and would undertake to lay the result of his labors before the Society as soon as he had anything worthy of its acceptance.\n\nIt was then moved by M. P. Edgeworth, Esq., seconded by Dr. Birch, and unanimously carried:\n\n\"That the thanks of the Meeting be given to the Director, Vice-President, Council, and Officers of the Society, for their zeal in the discharge of the duties of their several offices.\"\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Hoole and the Hon. W. E. Frere having been requested to act as scrutineers, the ballot was had recourse to for the election of a new President, two Vice-Presidents, and five Members of Council: and the result was declared as follows:\u2014President: The Right Hon. Lord Viscount Strangford. Vice-Presidents: Sir T. E. Colebrooke, Bart., M.P.; the Right Hon. Holt Mackenzie. Treasurer: E. Thomas, Esq. Honorary Secretary and Librarian: Edwin Norris, Esq.

R. Spence Hardy, R\u00e2j\u00e2 R\u00e2dh\u00e2k\u00e2nta Deva, and Colonel Hamilton are entitled to particular notice.\n\nProfessor Francis Bopp was the last survivor of twelve distinguished Oriental scholars whose names were enrolled as Foreign Members of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 7th of June, 1823.\u00b9 His reputation in England at that time was mainly founded on his \"Analytical Comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Teutonic Languages,\" which was contributed to the \"Annals of Oriental Literature,\" (Vol. I., 1\u201365,) in 1820, and was itself a new edition in an expanded form of his former book, \"Das Conjugationssystem der Sanskritsprache in Vergleichung mit jenem der griechischen, lateinischen, persischen und germanischen Sprache,\" published at Frankfort, under the auspices of F. Windischmann, in 1816. These treatises formed the nucleus, round which all his subsequent researches were grouped, and their aim and object was to prove that the Indo-Germanic languages have sprung from one common source now lost, and that by a critical and analytical intercomparison of the several languages and groups of languages, a clearer view may be obtained of the most ancient forms of each respectively, and some conception of the original and primitive signification of a great part of the grammatical inflexions common to all. It was not, however, till the year 1833, that Bopp commenced, in his \"Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit, Zend, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Litthauischen, Gothischen und Deutschen,\" to record the more comprehensive results of his linguistic investigations, and to point out the method by which he had\n\n\u00b9 The others were Professor Eichhorn, of G\u00f6ttingen; Professor Gotthelf von Fischer, of Moscow; Baron Joseph von Hammer, of Vienna; M. A. L. de Ch\u00e9zy; M. Jaubert; M. Julius von Klaproth; M. L. Langl\u00e8s; M. Abel Remusat; Baron S. de Saey, of Paris; Professor Reinward, of Leiden; and Professor W. A. Schlegel, of Bonn.\narrived at them. While even the first part of this Comparative Grammar clearly evinced his more matured judgment, expanded views, and sagacious insight into the organism of language, each subsequent part\u2014the last appeared in 1852\u2014added to the consolidation of the science which he had made it the task of his life to establish. Zend and Litthuanian were the first to be included in the range of languages under analysis; they were followed by the Slavonian class with their chief representative, the Old Bulgarian; and in succession by the old Prussian and the Celtic languages. On the second edition, which appeared in three volumes in 1857-61, and was entirely re-written, he brought to bear all the new lights which his own unwearied studies and the researches of fellow-labourers in the new science had called forth; more especially he incorporated in it the results of a searching examination of the Armenian. To some languages which he had included in the range of his investigations, as well as to some special questions of Comparative Grammar, he devoted separate treatises. Among these may be mentioned his monographs on the Celtic languages (1839), on the Caucasian members of the Indo-European class of languages (1847), the Old Prussian (1853), the Albanian (1855), on some demonstrative stems (1830), on the influence of the pronouns on the formation of words (1832), on the Old High German vowel system (1839), and on the accent in Sanskrit as compared with the accent in Greek (1854).\n\nIn all his works on Comparative Grammar, Bopp assigned to Sanskrit the chief place, and a great part of his time and labours was spent\u2014and most successfully spent\u2014in encouraging and facilitating the study of that language. His Sanskrit grammars have passed through several editions (1827, 1832, 1834, 1845, 1863), and it was but a few months before his death that the third edition of his \"Glossarium linguae Sanskritae,\" originally published in 1840, appeared. The episodes from the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata which he chose as text books, Hidimbabadha, Br\u00e2hma\u00f1avil\u00e2pa, Sunda and Upasunda, In-\ndralok\u00e2gamana, Nala, Arjunasam\u00e2gama, Matsyop\u00e2khy\u00e2na, S\u00e2vitr\u00ee, Draupadiharana), could hardly have been selected with greater tact and discrimination.\n\nBorn at Mentz on the 14th September, 1791, Bopp received at Aschaffenburg, under Professor K. J. Windischmann, the celebrated Oriental scholar, the greater part of his education, and the early stimulus to linguistical studies. With a view to devoting himself exclusively to these pursuits, he went in the autumn of 1812 to Paris, where he was enabled, through an annual stipend from the King of Bavaria, to spend five years chiefly in the study of Sanskrit, and enjoyed the privilege of friendly intercourse with A. de Ch\u00e9zy, S. de Sacy, and A. W. Schlegel. After a year's sojourn in London (1817), he settled at G\u00f6ttingen, and was appointed, in 1821, to an Extraordinary Professorship of Oriental Literature and General Philology at the University of Berlin, which was converted in 1825 to an ordinary Professorship, and held by him till his death, October 23, 1867. He was a prominent member of the Royal Society of Berlin, in whose Transactions most of his monographs are contained.\n\nThe \"Comparative Grammar\" was translated into English by Mr. E. B. Eastwick, and published under the auspices of Professor H. H. Wilson, in 3 volumes, 1845-50. A French translation by M. Br\u00e9al, made from the second edition, is passing through the press.\n\nAmiability of temper, simplicity of character and habits, and singular modesty, endeared him to all who knew him, while the gentleness of judgment pervading all his writings, and their entire freedom from acrimonious controversy or presumptuous dogmatism, must have gained him many friends. He had the gratification of seeing, fifty years after he made public the main principles of Comparative Philology, the establishment of a fund intended to be a tribute of gratitude to his revered name from the numerous votaries of the new science, and to find that this science, both in its method and its results, had carried conviction wherever it found its way.\nHonor\u00e9-Th\u00e9odoric-Paul-Joseph d'Albert, Duc de Luynes, was born in Paris on the 15th December, 1802. He was enabled by his princely fortune fully to gratify his antiquarian and artistic tastes, not only by forming a rich collection of treasures of art, but also by according his friendship and liberal patronage to savants and artists, and generously aiding literary enterprises. In 1864 he placed himself at the head of an archaeological expedition to Palestine, fitted out at his own expense, with the object of instituting arch\u00e6ological and geodetical investigations; the results of these have been recorded by Vignes and Lartet. The valuable collection of antiquities which the Imperial Library in Paris owes to his munificence, includes, among the rare gems secured by him in the Holy Land, the celebrated sarcophagus of Eshmunazer, King of Sidon, which has supplied Semitic philology with the most important Ph\u0153nician inscription yet discovered. That he himself was a learned man and vigorous writer, is testified by his published works (Description de quelques vases peints, 1840; Essai sur le numismatique des satrapies et de la Ph\u00e9nicie, 1846; M\u00e9taponte, 1163). The Duke was a grand seigneur of the good old type, generous, chivalrous, reserved. Foremost in all works of charity, he established schools for the poor, workshops for necessitous girls, and made good roads through his extensive lands. Death met him at Rome, on the 19th December of last year, whither he had proceeded to tend his sick countrymen who had joined the Papal army.\n\nBy the death of the Rev. Robert Spence Hardy, which took place at Headingley, near Leeds, on Thursday, April 16th, a useful and laborious life has been brought to a close. Mr. Hardy was a native of the city of York, of good family. In the year 1825 he was appointed to the Wesleyan mission in the island of Ceylon, where in the early part of his career he was associated with D. J. Gogerly and B. Clough, both of whom were at that time deeply engaged in the study of the sacred records of the Buddhists in the original Pali. In the year 1833, he returned to England for two years, and on\nhis way home visited Palestine, and was present, when at Jerusalem, at the foundation of the first Protestant mission in the Holy City. The results of his observations were subsequently gathered up in a volume entitled \"Notices of the Holy Land, and other places mentioned in the Scriptures.\" Soon after his return to the mission in Ceylon, in 1835, he commenced a more methodical study than he had previously pursued of the authentic sources of the Buddhistic religion, with the aim of publishing the results of his researches for the benefit of missionaries in Buddhistic countries, as well as for the instruction of the general reader. In the years of comparative leisure which followed his second return to England in 1847, he worked up the ample materials collected in Ceylon into two volumes, published severally in 1850 and 1852, in the first of which, entitled \"Eastern Monachism,\" he has given us, from original documents, an account of the history, laws, sacred writings, practices, and present condition of the priesthood in Ceylon. The second contains, under the title \"Manual of Buddhism,\" a careful and detailed description of the Buddhistic system of cosmogony, philosophy, and ethics, as well as the legendary history of Gotama Buddha.\n\nThese volumes earned for Mr. Hardy a well-merited reputation as an authority on the southern branch of Buddhism; and the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society conferred on him as a mark of their appreciation of his distinguished services to Oriental literature, the degree of honorary membership, Feb. 2, 1856.\n\nMr. Hardy paid a third visit to Ceylon in 1863, when he took charge for three years of the South Ceylon mission, as General Superintendent. While there, he wrote a third work of smaller compass, and a more controversial character, on \"the sacred books of the Buddhists compared with history and modern science,\" a second edition of which appeared in London in 1866. Sir Emerson Tennant's volumes on Ceylon were also indebted to his pen for some valuable portions of their contents.\nMr. Hardy was an earnest, hard-working missionary, of singularly retiring habits, who knew how to combine with the pursuit of his practical calling those valuable literary researches which have secured for him an honourable name among oriental scholars.\n\nR\u0101j\u0101 \u015ar\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101k\u0101nta Deva Bah\u0101dur, K.C.S.I., descended from the ancient family of the Maulika Kayastha Devas of Chitrapura, was the son of R\u0101j\u0101 Gopimohana Deva Bah\u0101dur, who himself was a nephew and adopted son of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Navakrishna Bah\u0101dur. He was born on the 1st of the month Chaitra, of the year 1705 \u015a\u0101ka (A.D. 1783), at his maternal uncle's house at Simla, where he also received his early education. He subsequently acquired a very good knowledge of English at Mr. Cumming's Academy at Calcutta, and applied himself with great zeal and success to the study of the Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian languages. At a very early period he became an earnest promoter of native education, and took henceforth a prominent part in all public movements for the general welfare of the people. Among the public institutions in Calcutta in whose foundation or early prosperity he had an efficient share, may be mentioned the Hindu College, the Government Sanskrit College, the Calcutta School-book Society, the Agricultural and Horticultural Society, the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and the British Indian Association. Besides various papers contributed to the Journal of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Bengal, and an English translation of a Persian work on Horticulture, printed in the second volume of \"Miscellaneous Translations,\" (Oriental Translation Fund), he compiled in 1820 a Bengali Reader, on the European system, which has been the model of almost all the numerous school-books of this class that have been published since. But his chief reputation as a scholar rests on his great Sanskrit Encyclopaedia, the \u015aabdakalpadruma (8 vols. 4to., 1822-58) to the publication of which he devoted nearly forty years of his life and a considerable portion of his fortune, and which earned for him\nthe most honourable recognition, not only in all parts of India, but also in America and throughout Europe. A full account of the testimonials and diplomas which the Raja received from almost all the foreign academies and many learned societies, is contained in a small volume entitled \"A rapid sketch of the life of Raja Radhakanta Deva Bahadur,\" Calcutta, 1859. An analysis of volumes 1-3 of his work, by the late Dr. Lenz, will be found in the second volume of the R. A. S. Journal, pp. 188-200. The Raja was beloved and respected both by English and Hindus for his unblemished character, suavity of disposition, and urbanity of manners. His death took place in one of the sacred groves of Brindavan, on the 19th April, 1867.\n\nColonel George William Hamilton, son of Daniel Hamilton, Esq., of Gilkers, Lancashire, born on the 17th May, 1807, in Edinburgh, was educated at the Glasgow High School, and appointed as a cadet to the Bengal Infantry in the year 1824. He was appointed to the old 17th N. I. (which was afterwards changed to the 34th). In 1829 he was appointed Interpreter to that regiment. He always paid great attention to the native languages, not merely the vernaculars, but also to the Arabic and Persian, and gradually collected a good oriental library, but he did not publish any result of his reading.\n\nIn 1842 he was appointed to civil duties in the commission of the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, in which he continued in various posts, till in 1849 he was transferred to the Punjab. There he distinguished himself by his able defence of the rebel ruler of Multan, Mul-raj, having been appointed to act as his advocate at the state trial at Lahore. He then was Deputy-Commissioner, first at Pind Daden Khan, then at Jhung and Multan; then he was promoted to the Commissionership of Multan in 1854, where he was during the mutiny, and where he marvellously held his ground and kept the soldiery from breaking out into violence. Subsequently he was transferred to Delhi, where he was enabled to complete his valuable library, a portion of which has since his\ndeath been purchased for the British Museum. Unfortunately, he continued at his post at Dehli too long, and was carried off on Feb. 28th of the current year, by a long and painful illness shortly after he returned to this country. His fine collection of arms and some of his MSS. were exhibited in the French Exposition, and others in the Museum at Edinburgh.\n\nIt is very sad that we have lost him before he had an opportunity of bringing the result of his studies before the public.\n\nIn proceeding to lay before the Meeting a brief account of the principal literary events bearing upon the East, which have left their mark upon the past year, the Council would in the first place advert to the increasing facilities now afforded for the study of the Japanese language by the simultaneous publication, at Yedo and Paris, of two Japanese dictionaries, and by the free importation into Europe of Japanese books, as well as to a large and important accession of helps for the study of Chinese. The issue of such works as a new edition of the second part of Dr. Morrison's Dictionary, and Mr. Lobscheid's great English and Chinese Lexicon, with a number of translations of standard works from the one language into the other, is a gratifying proof of the zeal of both nations in seeking for a right understanding and appreciation of their mutual interests, and of the extent to which they have carried their intentions into effect. The Council are especially interested in the new impetus thus given to Chinese studies, inasmuch as these labours have been prominently advanced by two gentlemen who are members of our own society. Mr. Secretary Wade, favorably known already as the author of an important handbook on the Pekin dialect (published in 1859), has recently issued a similar work, but on a more expanded plan, which, though intended to be only an elementary help for the acquisition of the colloquial language, and the language of business and diplomacy, is likely to prove more useful to our young officials and merchants in that country\nthan any previous publication. Mr. W. F. Mayers, H. M. Consular Agent at Canton, started at the beginning of last year a monthly periodical, called Notes and Queries on China and Japan, and intended as a medium of inter-communication between professional and literary men in the far East, which under its unpretending name has been the means of bringing to light a vast amount of curious and valuable information concerning those countries, and of stimulating literary enquiries in relation thereto which would otherwise have remained dormant. As the Society's Hong Kong Branch is not likely to be revived for the present, and its Shanghai Branch is temporarily suffering from the vicissitudes to which all similar institutions in the East are liable, the Council cannot but wish every success to such a useful local auxiliary in the Society's own investigations. They also desire to draw attention to a volume of \"Notes on Chinese Literature,\" by Mr. A. Wylie, the translator of Euclid into Chinese, and author of a valuable article on the Neu-shih Inscription in the Society's Journal. This is a work of vast research, and indispensable to all who wish to possess an experienced and competent guide to the various departments of the rich literature of that empire. The Council have not neglected opportunities of evincing their interest in China, and recently they have availed themselves of the kindness of the Rev. E. W. Lyle, who delivered on the 16th of March an interesting and instructive lecture \"On the music and musical notation of the Chinese,\" on which occasion the meeting was honoured by the presence of a larger number of Sinologues than have perhaps ever been assembled in the rooms of any oriental society out of China.\n\nNor will Chinese and Japanese philology any longer remain unrepresented in the pages of our Journal. The Rev. Joseph Edkins, at Peking, our honorary associate, has promised a paper on the old form of Chinese, with illustrations from cognate languages, and Mr. F. V. Dickens, whose graphic account of his \"Ride into the Aino country,\"\nread at the last meeting, will be fresh in the recollection of the members, is now engaged on two essays, one on the linguistic position and affinities of Japanese, and the second being a sketch of the history of Japanese literature.\n\nIn reference to Western China, the Council have fully shared the interest which has been evinced in political and commercial circles in England and France, with regard to the steps taken for opening up the trade with that country, and they trust they may be able at the next Anniversary to communicate to the Society some of the results of the expeditions undertaken for this object, so far as they bear upon our own investigations. In the meantime the Council would advert to two valuable works to which the French occupation of Cochin China has given rise; one a Code of the Laws of Annam, translated from the original Chinese by Captain Aubaret, and the second a Grammar and Dictionary of the Annamite language by the same author. For copies of both these works the Society is indebted to the liberality of the French Colonial Office.\n\nThe Council also desire in this place to record their recognition of the eminent services rendered to the history of early European travel to Eastern Asia, by two publications which supplement each other. The one is Mons. Pauthier's elaborate edition of Marco Polo, a copy of which has been presented to our library by the author; and the second a collection of medieval notices of China and Central Asia, translated and edited by our learned associate, Colonel H. Yule, C.B., under the title \"Cathay and the way thither.\" This collection, comprising the records of travel of Friar Oderic, John de Marignolli, Benedict Go\u00ebs, Ibn Batuta, and others, which bear to Marco Polo \"some such relation as the collections of the lesser Greek geographers bear to Ptolemy,\" will speedily be followed by a new English edition of that \"prince of medieval travellers,\" and, to judge by the scrupulous care and thorough mastery of the subject with which the minor travellers have been edited and elucidated\nby Colonel Yule, an edition of the great traveller's \"Book\" may be expected from him which will be a landmark in the history of geographical science in England.\n\nIt was the intention of the Council to have commenced in this year's Report to give an account of the state and progress of literature in India, as they had hoped to be supplied with the materials for doing so under the provisions of the new Act for the compulsory registration of all printed matter. There has, however, been much delay in carrying the Act into effect in parts of India; and, moreover, the catalogues received, the Council have good reason to believe, are so imperfect, that from an examination of them alone, or of the books sent to the India Office, no just estimate could be formed of the present condition of native literature in India. But this slowness or reluctance on the part of the more obstructive portion of native publishers to comply with the regulation may be expected to give way to more enlightened views, when they see that it will be their own interest to have their work properly registered, and the Council will then not fail to redeem the promise given last year. Though the Society will not, as a rule, derive any direct benefit from the operation of the Act, the Council intend to apply from time to time to H. M. Secretary of State for India on behalf of our library, for a grant of any of those publications that are likely to be of special value and interest to the Society.\n\nThe Meeting will be glad to learn that a measure of equally great if not of greater importance than the before-mentioned Act, is now engaging the attention of the Government of India, viz., the institution of a system whereby the most valuable remains of ancient Indian architecture may be catalogued, measured-photographed, and otherwise fully delineated and described. On this subject the Council hope to be in a position to report more in detail at the next Anniversary. They will only advert now to a great desideratum in connection with it, viz., a manual or guide to Indian archaeologists, which should state for each district of India both what has been done in the\nway of arch\u00e6ological enquiry, and what remains to be done. \"There are,\" in the words of a valued Indian correspondent, \"an infinity of places in which researches might be made, and there are many local observers who would be glad to help if they had any idea of what to look for and where to look.\" Little help for carrying out a comprehensive plan for the compilation of such a manual can be expected from persons in India, who are far too busy with professional duties, or from the combined action of the local societies. But there are many members of both services now in England, men of ability and experience in such matters, who could employ their leisure, each in working out the part of the scheme most familiar or congenial to himself; and the Council would only perform a duty they owe to India and to oriental science by organizing a system for the composition of such a handbook, and superintending its preparation for the press, so soon as they can be assured of the assistance of a staff of willing and competent coadjutators.\n\nThey are also happy to refer to the increasing appreciation of the aid derivable by the student of Hindu philology from a fuller investigation of the rural dialects, and they specially mention as deserving of every recognition and encouragement, the grammatical sketches which have lately been presented of two interesting dialects, one belonging to the Dravidian, the other to the Hindi group, by two members of this Society, viz.:\u2014Captain Cole's Grammar of the Coorg language, and Mr. Beames' paper on the Bhojpuri dialect of Hindi, in the forthcoming number of the Journal. There are many other dialects and local variations both in Northern and Southern India which have never yet been grammatically fixed, but would probably yield under a like careful treatment as valuable results. The Council therefore direct attention to this desideratum in the wide and varied domain of Indian philology.\n\nIn the meantime they have the gratification to report that a member of our Society, Mr. W. W. Hunter, of the Bengal\nCivil Service, is engaged upon a comparative vocabulary of the Non-Arian languages of India, to be succeeded in due course by a series of grammars. The plan of this work is very comprehensive, inasmuch as it is intended to give the equivalents for about two hundred English words in nearly one hundred and twenty-five languages and dialects arranged in groups. In the compilation of this comparative vocabulary, Mr. Hunter is availing himself of very extensive materials, both printed and manuscript, and especially of Mr. B. H. Hodgson's collections, and he will enhance its value and usefulness by a preliminary dissertation. Such an important contribution to Indian glossology, coming as it does from a writer who, by his recent publication entitled \"The Annals of Rural Bengal,\" has shown his thorough competency to deal with questions concerning the races and languages of India,\u2014will not fail to be especially welcome also to Sanskritists, among whom the opinion is gaining ground that the Non-Arian languages of India have exercised a palpable influence on the Sanskrit, and not in its vocabulary only.\n\nOf the affiliated Societies the Ceylon Branch is the only one of whose proceedings for the past two years any tidings have been received. But the contents of its Journal are in themselves sufficient to make up in interest for the total silence of the other Societies. Besides a posthumous paper by the late Dr. Gogerly, containing a translation of the Dhamma-chakka-ppavattana-sutta, the first and most important discourse delivered by Buddha, and an essay by Mr. James d'Alwis on the origin of the Singhalese language, the Journal brings under the title, \"On Demonology and Witchcraft in Ceylon,\" by Dandris de Silva Guneratne Modliar, one of the most valuable contributions to the history of superstition in the East. The Council are of opinion that similar enquiries might profitably be instituted on the continent of India, both among the Hindu and non-Hindu population, with a view to the tracing of that indelible under-structure of superstitious practice and belief upon which the prevailing\nsystem of Hindu rites, faith, and philosophy has been raised.\n\nIt may perhaps be in the recollection of some members, that no small curiosity was created among Oriental scholars about twenty years ago, by the intelligence that the Hindu population of the small island of Bali had been found to be in the possession of many ancient Sanskrit works, including one out of the eighteen Pur\u00e2nas. Unfortunately Dr. R. Friederich, to whom we owe this discovery, was obliged to leave the island in the midst of his investigations, and it was with the view of stimulating further research on the state and condition of Hinduism in Bali, that in the year 1862 our valued associate, General G. Legrand Jacob, with his wonted liberality, deposited MS. copies of six Pur\u00e2nas in the Society's library, and entrusted copies of six others to the custody of its Bombay Branch, with the understanding that these MSS. were to be handed over to Dr. Friederich or any other scholar on his furnishing the Society with a copy and translation of the sole Pur\u00e2na (the Brahmanda) said to be known to the Hindus of Bali. The Council have now the gratification to announce to the meeting, that in the room of Dr. Friederich, who will not return to Bali, Dr. H. N. van der Tuuk has recently sailed for that island to resume and complete Dr. Friederich's labours; and they are confident that, if a rare combination of oriental scholarship, as regards both Hindu and Javanese antiquities and philology, with a long experience of eastern life and modes of thought, and with conciliatory habits and a total absence of bigotry, can ensure success in such a delicate and difficult mission, he will in due course be able to submit to this Society the results of his enquiries, and be awarded the prize set upon the successful solution of some interesting problems in the history of ancient civilization.\n\nThe appearance of the first instalment of Mr. Norris' Assyrian Dictionary will be welcomed by the Society and orientalists generally with more than a passing interest.\nMr. Norris' long association with the Director of the Society in the publication of the Assyrian documents, has been well calculated to fit him for these lexicographical labours, which require a large amount of patient research and of familiarity with the cuneiform records. Semitic scholars were enabled, by the specimen printed in the Journal two years ago, to judge of the general plan and arrangement which Mr. Norris is following in his larger work. No one could be better aware than himself of the difficulties of his task, or speak with greater reserve of his success in overcoming them, nor would the Council ignore the shortcomings which in a first and tentative work of the kind are unavoidable. But they wish to express their full approbation of the courage with which Mr. Norris has undertaken so late in life a work of such extent for the benefit of Assyrian students, in the hope of bringing more labourers into the field\u2014a hope in which the Council heartily concur.\n\nSir H. Rawlinson has been occupied during the past year in preparing for publication, with the assistance of a very promising young student, Mr. G. Smith, a third volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia. This volume will contain all the extant portions of the Annals of Assur-pani-pal, the son of Esar-Haddon, who in the seventh century, B.C., overran Egypt and all Western Asia, and was known to the Greeks, then first rising into power as the great Sardanapalus. It will also comprise a number of fragments recently found among the Museum tablets, which fill up many blanks in the earlier history of Assyria, and thus place the general chronology of the empire on a surer basis. The remainder of the volume will be devoted to a series of minor legends, selected from the legal, astrological, and miscellaneous tablets of the Nineveh Library. Many of these legends are very curious, and are believed to date from an enormous antiquity, the Nineveh tablets of the seventh and eighth centuries B.C. being mere copies of earlier documents which were then crumbling from age, and the language of\nwhich had become antiquated and unintelligible. It is expected that this volume will be issued by the trustees of the British Museum during the summer.\n\nOn the occasion of the Sultan's visit to London in the August of last year, the President and Council presented an address to H. I. Majesty, to express to him on behalf of the Society and all other scientific bodies in this country, their gratitude for the \"unreserved permission afforded to the operations of European explorers and antiquarians in all parts of the Ottoman dominions.\"\n\nThe Council are aware that the Society has some claim on them for an explanation concerning the long period which has been allowed to elapse up to the publication of the Journal now on the table. Several of the papers contained in it were in type at the last Anniversary, and it was then settled that it was also to comprise two articles on ancient Sanskrit literature, and a paper by Mr. Thomas on Sassanian legends, which was to conclude the number. Mr. Thomas in the progress of his enquiry found so much matter of increasing interest in his subject, that he availed himself to the utmost of the delay in the printing of the other papers. And hampered as he has been to the very last by typographical difficulties of every kind, the Council trust that the Members of the Society will accord their indulgence to him the more readily, as the delay will be compensated by the quick succession of the next following two numbers. For the contributions which have come to hand in the meantime will offer no technical difficulties to the printer, so that he will be able to complete the third volume in the summer, and proceed with the fourth forthwith. These contributions are:\u20141. On the Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, by the Hon. H. Stanley (continued from the preceding number); 2. Account of an Embassy from Morocco to Spain in the years 1690 and 91, translated from an Arabic MS. by the same; 3. Materials for the History of India for the six hundred years of Mohammedan rule previous to the foundation of the British\nIndian Empire, by Major W. N. Lees; 4. On the Bhojpuri dialect of Hindi, by Mr. J. Beames; 5. On the Hill people inhabiting the Forests of the Cochin State, by Captain G. Fryer; and 6. The Mohammedan Law of Evidence, and its connection with the Administration of Justice in India, by Mr. Neil B. E. Baillie. In addition to these, besides the three mentioned above under the head of China and Japan, the following have been promised:\u2014On the Antiquities of Diyarbekr, by Mr. Consul J. G. Taylor; On the Pongal Festival of Southern India, by Mr. C. E. Gover; and Bengali Proverbs, as illustrative of the social condition of the people, by the Rev. J. Long.\n\nThe library has continued during the past year to receive valuable accessions, presented by authors or publishers, and other friends and patrons, among which the Society will acknowledge with particular gratitude, the fifth volume of Mohl\u2019s edition of the Shahnameh, the third volume of Lane\u2019s Arabic Lexicon, ten volumes of Reports of the Dutch Missionary Society, the second volume of Dr. Land\u2019s Anecdota Syriaca, Dr. Trumpp\u2019s Sindhi Literature, the first volume of Mr. Chenery\u2019s translation of Hariri, the first volume of Lassen\u2019s Indische Alterthumskunde, new edition, the first volume of Professor Dowson\u2019s edition of Sir H. Elliott\u2019s History of India, and two valuable Pali MS., which were presented by Mr. Childers.\n\nThe Council have not for many years been in a position to set apart even a small portion of the Society\u2019s annual income for the purpose of gradually completing to a certain extent its collection of standard works of reference on oriental subjects. But they believe that, if the Members of the Society were enabled to see what books in our library are wanting or incomplete, many might feel induced to supply at least some of the deficiencies. With this view, the Council contemplate having a book of desiderata placed on the library table, open to the inspection of members and visitors, in which the titles of any desirable additions to the library shall\nfrom time to time be entered, and they hope that in their endeavour thus to provide for the greater efficiency of the Society's collections they may meet with the ready and liberal support of its members and friends.\n\nAUDITORS' REPORT.\n\nYour Auditors beg leave to report that, having examined the accounts and compared them with the vouchers, they find them perfectly correct. They have also formed an estimate for the ensuing year, and anticipate that the income will suffice to meet the expenditure without trenching on the balance at the bankers', which they are happy to observe is nearly \u00a380 in excess of that of the previous year.\n\nThe reading of the Reports being concluded, it was proposed by M. P. Edgeworth, Esq., seconded by Capt. G. Fryer, and carried nem. con., \"that the Report of the Council and of the Auditors be approved and adopted, and that the thanks of the meeting be given to the President, Director, Vice-Presidents, Council, and other officers of the Society for the efficient manner with which they have discharged the duties of their offices during the past year.\"\n\nThe Chairman, after expressing his acknowledgments for the resolution which the meeting had done him the honor to pass, said that the Report just read entered so fully into the details of the progress of Oriental studies during the past year that it relieved him of the necessity of offering to the meeting more than a few supplementary remarks. They might, perhaps, recollect that some years ago it was considered desirable to incorporate in the annual report a detailed account of the progress of every branch of literary and scientific research in relation to Asia. But this scheme had been found too comprehensive to be practicable. With regard to Oriental literature generally, he was of opinion that the lucid surveys annually presented to the French Asiatic Society by M. Jules Mohl were calculated to make any attempt on our part at a similar scheme superfluous. But he was glad to observe that\nthe Council's Report for the past year had this distinctive character, that it made especial reference to the work done by English Orientalists in all parts of the globe, and particularly by members of this Society. Many of the works not mentioned in the Report, such as the valuable books by Major E. Bell, were political, and on that account he had no business to go into the consideration of them here; but they showed the great interest which was taken in the affairs of Asia; and some of them might be referred to as coming from members of the Society. Of purely literary works, he considered that Mr. Chenery's classical translation of Hariri, and Mr. Hunter's Annals of Rural Bengal, by which quite a new domain of Oriental enquiry had been opened up, were deserving of especial mention.\n\nAnother subject which it was right to notice was the growing interest in Asiatic matters as evinced by the increasing number of the members of our Society: they, too, might, indeed, be congratulated, not only on the number but on the quality of these new accessions, who were exactly those they would like to see joining them,\u2014practical Orientalists like Mr. Beames and Mr. Hunter.\n\nReference must also be made to the three recent appointments at Oxford and Cambridge in which the Society was particularly interested. He had read to-day that Professor M. M\u00fcller, after wandering amongst the Chairs like Leto in the \u00c6gean before she arrived at the island of Delos, had been definitely appointed to a Professorship of Comparative Philology. Previous to this he had been teaching everything, and this he had done, not by right of his professorial duties, but by right of being Professor M. M\u00fcller. Then a Professorship of Sanskrit had been established at Cambridge, where this study was heretofore joined to that of Hebrew, and was practically in abeyance. The Professor appointed\u2014their distinguished associate Professor Cowell\u2014had the work of three strong men upon his hands, for he would have to teach Sanskrit, Persian, and Comparative Philology. But if any one could do it, Mr. Cowell could. The third was the appointment of Mr. Chenery as Professor of Arabic at Oxford,\nwhere Arabic heretofore had hardly been taught at all. Mr. Chenery's name was a guarantee that vitality would be put into Arabic studies in that University, and the Society might confidently look forward to important results from the raising up of young men well acquainted with a language and literature to which in England too little attention had been paid.\n\nWith regard to instruction in the Oriental languages, there was one thing in which we in England were not only deficient, but in reference to which we almost stood alone, and that was the learning of the living languages. We were under a twofold responsibility to the East, for we were not only in possession of a magnificent Eastern empire, but were brought by that possession into more immediate contact with Western Asia than were the other nations of Europe. We saw what importance the French attached to Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, of which so little cognizance was taken here; and he thought we might hope to see some scheme concerning the establishment of a school for the living Oriental languages, similar to the one in Paris, brought in some tangible shape before the Legislature. If Arabic were taught as it should be in the Bombay Presidency, it would be of the greatest possible service to us, brought into constant contact as we were with tribes speaking either Arabic or kindred languages. But then it was of the first importance that the vernacular Arabic should be taught as well as the Arabic of literature. The noble Chairman hoped the members would excuse him for not entering more fully into these topics, as he had to vacate the chair, being, with Sir H. Rawlinson, under an engagement to meet Sir S. Northcote at the India Office. The subject of the interview had reference to Asia, and if they were successful it would bring grist to the Society's mill. As Mr. Thomas had kindly consented to fill his place during the rest of the meeting, it remained for him only, in conclusion, to thank the members for their courtesy in listening to his observations.\n\nSir John Bowring said he was pleased with the admirable observations which had fallen from the noble Lord, the President, relative to the study of the Oriental languages in the\nvernacular. He had been much struck in the East by the want of knowledge of this kind on the part of officers employed by the Government, which was humiliated by the ignorance of its subordinates, while the natives were led to form very erroneous notions of us and of our position in the world. When he was in China, there were only six individuals with whom he came in contact who were able to hold intercourse with the Mandarins. That was an unfortunate position, and he ventured to suggest to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs the importance of giving attention to the subject, and that suggestion led to the establishment of a class of student interpreters; these had rendered services that showed the extreme importance of bringing into the field persons qualified to come directly into intercourse with the native officials. This led him to refer to a matter having direct reference to the subject. They were aware that considerable funds had been left by Dr. Gilchrist, and the trustees of those funds were determined to apply them, so as to assist education as much as possible. Their object was to bring the best of Indian minds into contact with the best of European minds; and they thought that if they could come to an arrangement with the different Presidencies, to select young men to be educated at Oxford and Cambridge, and afterwards taken back to India, they would be pursuing a course most likely to accomplish their end. The Gilchrist trustees first submitted this scheme to Lord Cranbourne, and afterwards to Sir Stafford Northcote; and the result of it all was that they would shortly have sent to this country, for the purpose of being educated here, two natives from each of the Presidencies of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. The Gilchrist fund would provide a sum of \u00a3100 per annum for the maintenance of each of these students for five years; and the belief of the trustees was that if they could educate these young men here, and send them back to India, they might be eminently serviceable to the country (hear, hear.) The Government had undertaken to provide a passage to England and back again to India, to the individuals selected. He mentioned this, because he thought the members of this Society would\nhear with some sympathy of what was about to take place. In conclusion, he begged to say that the Gilchrist trustees would be delighted to receive any suggestions which might help them to carry out their object, which was to infuse into the highest minds in India what was highest in the mind of England (cheers).\n\nAfter a few observations from Major-General G. Legrand Jacob in reference to that part of the Report in which mention was made of the revival of the researches into the antiquities of the Island of Bali, the Chairman proceeded to inform the meeting that a new impression of the Society's Regulations having become necessary, the Council had considered it expedient to propose a few alterations which had become requisite in the course of time, and he invited the members present to declare their adhesion or otherwise to the proposed alterations as they were read out to them by the Secretary. The amendments approved of and passed were thereupon ordered to be entered in the new issue of the Regulations.\n\nThe ballot was then had recourse to for the election of Council and Officers of the Society for the ensuing session, when the result was declared as follows:\n\nDirector: Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., M.P.\nTreasurer: E. Thomas, Esq.\nHonorary Secretary and Librarian: E. Norris, Esq.\nSecretary: Dr. R. Rost.\nCouncil: Major E. Bell; C. P. Brown, Esq.; Professor T.

Nicholson, Bart.; A. J. E. Russell, Esq., M.P.; P. B. Smollett, Esq., M.P.; D. J. Forbes Watson, M.D.; General Sir A. S. Waugh, C.B.\n\nMr. E. Norris having proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Thomas for his conduct in the chair, which was seconded by Captain Fryer, and unanimously carried, the meeting was adjourned to June the 15th.\nABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1867.\n\n| 1867. | RECEIPTS. | \u00a3 s. d. | Expenditure. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|-------|----------|--------|--------------|--------|\n|       | 133 Resident Members, at 3 guineas | 418 19 0 | House Rent for the Year | 250 0 0 |\n|       | 66 Non-Resident Members, at 1 guinea | 63 0 0 | Assessed Taxes ditto | 19 0 2 |\n|       | 6 Original Members, at 2 guineas | 12 12 0 | PAROCHIAL Rates ditto | 12 4 2 |\n|       | Arrears paid up | 27 6 0 | Water Rate ditto | 5 19 0 |\n|zo       | Commissions | 2 - - - | Fire Insurance ditto | 5 12 0 |\n|Major J.

I cannot promise a translation of all the hymns, for the simple reason that, notwithstanding S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s traditional explanations of every word, and in spite of every effort to decipher the original text, either by an intercomparison of all passages in which the same word occurs, or by etymological analysis, or by consulting the vocabulary and grammar of cognate languages, there remain large portions of the Rig-Veda which, as yet, yield no intelligible sense. It is very easy, no doubt, to translate these obscurer portions according to S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s traditional interpretation, but the\nimpossibility of adopting this alternative may be judged by the fact that even the late Professor Wilson, who undertook to give a literal rendering of S\u0101yana\u2019s interpretation of the Rig-Veda, found himself obliged, by the rules of common sense and by the exigencies of the English language, to desert, not unfrequently, that venerable guide. I need hardly repeat what I have so often said,\u00b9 that it would be reckless to translate a single line of the Rig-Veda without having carefully examined S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s invaluable commentary and other native authorities, such as the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the \u0100ranyakas, the Pr\u0101tis\u0101khya\u015b, Y\u0101ska\u2019s Nirukta, \u015aaunaka\u2019s B\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101, the S\u016btras, the Anukrama\u1e47is, and many other works on grammar, metre, nay, even on law and philosophy, from which we may gather how the most learned among the Brahmins understood their own sacred writings. But it would be equally reckless not to look beyond.\n\nA long controversy has been carried on, during the last twenty years, whether we, the scholars of Europe, have a right to criticise the traditional interpretation of the sacred writings of the Brahmins. I think we have not only the right to do so, but that it is the duty of every scholar never to allow himself to be guided by tradition, unless that tradition has first been submitted to the same critical tests which are applied to the suggestions of his own private judgment. A translator must, before all things, be a \u201csceptic,\u201d a man who looks about, and who chooses that for which he is able to make himself honestly responsible, whether it be suggested to him, in the first instance, by the most authoritative tradition or by the merest random guess.\n\nI offer my translation of such hymns as I can, to a certain extent, understand and explain, as a humble contribution to\u2014\n\n\u00b9 This subject and the principles by which I shall be guided in my translation of the Rig-Veda have been discussed in an article lately published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, New Series, vol. ii., part 2, \u201cThe Hymns of the Gaup\u0101yana\u015b and the Legend of King Asam\u0101ti.\u201d The same volume contains two valuable articles on the same subject by Mr. J. Muir, D.C.L.\nwards a future translation of the whole of the Rig-Veda. There are many scholars in England, Germany, France, and India who now devote their energies to the deciphering of Vedic words and Vedic thoughts; in fact, there are few Sanskrit scholars at present who have not made the Veda the principal subject of their studies. With every year, with every month, new advances are made, and words and thoughts, which but lately seemed utterly unintelligible, receive an unexpected light from the ingenuity of European students. Fifty years hence I hope that my own translation may be antiquated and forgotten. No one can be more conscious of its shortcomings than I am. All I hope is that it may serve as a step leading upwards to a higher, clearer, truer point of view, from which those who come after us may gain a real insight into the thoughts, the fears, the hopes, the doubts, the faith of the true ancestors of our race;\u2014of those whose language still lives in our own language, and whose earliest poetical compositions have been preserved to us for more than three thousand years, in the most surprising, and, to my mind, the most significant manner.\n\nMAX M\u00dcLLER.\n\nOxford, January, 1867.\n\nThe present publication is intended to form eight volumes, of about twenty-five sheets each, containing an English translation, notes, and explanatory essays. A transliterated text (in the original Pada form) will be added in order to obviate the necessity of quoting a whole passage again and again in the various notes on the same verse. The first volume will be published as soon as a sufficient number of subscribers has been obtained. Not more than two volumes to be published in each year.\n\nTerms of Subscription before publication, 10s. 6d. per volume\u2014the price to Non-subscribers after publication will be 12s. 6d. per volume.\n\nTR\u00dcBNER & Co., 60, Paternoster Row, London.\nHymn to the Maruts (the Storm-gods), ascribed to Kanva, the son of Ghora.\n\n1.

Wilson translates anarv\u00e3nam by without horses, though the commentator distinctly explains the word by without an enemy. Wilson considers it doubtful whether arvan can ever mean enemy. The fact is, that in the Rig-veda anarv\u00e1n never means without horses, but always without hurt or free from enemies; and the commentator is perfectly right, as far as the sense is concerned, in rendering the word by without an enemy, or unopposed (apraty-rita). Anarv\u00e1n is not formed from \u00e2rvat, horse,\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nOF\n\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND:\n\n5, NEW BURLINGTON STREET, LONDON.\n\nCORRECTED TO JULY, M.DCCC.LXVIII.\n\nLONDON:\nTR\u00dcBNER AND CO, 60, PATERNOSTER ROW, E.C.\n1868.\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nPATRON:\nHER MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\n\nVICE-PATRONS:\nHIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE HON.
