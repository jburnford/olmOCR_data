Neither, however, of the above-mentioned three authors have attempted anything like classification; Pr\u00e9mare and Gon\u00e7alves having mixed up Figures of Rhetoric with Figures of Syntax, indiscriminately, while Watters in his otherwise scholarly and valuable *Essays* seems to have included all figures of similarity and contiguity under the one head of metaphor. For instance, Gon\u00e7alves gives under *Syntaxe Figurada* (p. 179) Climax, Metaphor, and Metonymy, as well as a whole host of such figures as Polysyndeton, Epanadiplosis, Antanaclasis, etc., etc., legacies from the schoolmen of ancient Greece, who by their pedantic refinements would have reduced the art of rhetoric to the level of a mechanical toy. And Watters (*China Review*, V., p. 215) speaks of \u201cthat kind of metaphor by which the part is made to represent the whole or the individual the species,\u201d this being of course the separate figure of synecdoche; while of the three illustrations adduced, namely, \u540d for person or individual, \u9580 for sect or school of philosophy, and \u8089 for pork, only the last one falls under the head of synecdoche, the two first being excellent examples of metonymy.\n\n**CLASS I.**\n\n1. **Simile.**\u2014This figure consists simply in likening one thing to another. The things compared must, however, be different in kind; and the comparison must not be pushed to excess, or it degenerates into hyperbole (*q. v.*).\nThe choice of similes by Chinese writers presents but few points of special interest, being in fact, with due allowance for difference of environment, almost identical with that dictated by the canons of western literary taste. Life is compared with a dream, death with sleep, rosy cheeks with peach-blossoms, etc., etc.\n\nE. G. \u77b3\u4eba\u5982\u6f06: eyes as black as lacquer.\n\n\u8f3b\u8f33\u5982\u96f2: spokes and axles like clouds (in number); sc. many chariots. See synecdoche.\n\n\u5634\u4f3c\u5200: a mouth like a knife; sc. cutting in speech.\n\n\u6dda\u5982\u96e8\u4e0b: her tears fell like rain.\n\nA tipsy man is said to be \u9189\u5982\u6ce5 \"as drunk as mud,\" in reference to a certain marine creature which when taken out of the water lies like a lump of mud, thus affording an instance of a simile within a simile.\n\nThe poet Li T'ai-poh likened man in his mortal state to the dust on the high road, blown hither and thither at the caprice of every changing wind:\n\n\u4eba\u751f\u7121\u6839\u8482\n\u98c4\u5982\u964c\u4e0a\u5875\n\nHe likened the moon-beams playing on the floor round his bed to hoar-frost lying on the ground:\n\n\u5e8a\u524d\u6708\u660e\u5149\n\u7591\u662f\u5730\u4e0a\u971c\n\nHe also compared the human face with the flowers of the garden, and found that neither yielded in beauty or expression to the other:\n\n\u82b1\u9762\u4e0d\u76f8\u9952\n\nSo, too, we read in the Hung-lou-m\u00e9ng (ch. VI.) of P'ing-'rh, that \u82b1\u5bb9\u6708\u8c8c she was as beautiful as a flower and as bright-looking as the moon.\n\n2. Metaphor.\u2014Some readers may possibly be glad to be reminded that a metaphor is simply a simile in a word, the\nmetaphorical application of the word being altogether foreign to that in which it is commonly employed.\n\nOf all figures of speech this is the one most constantly to be met with in Chinese literature, a fact to be ascribed in a great measure to the peculiar nature of the written language. For instance, the Chinese say \u9435\u8b49 \"iron proofs\" for the more expanded \"proofs as irresistible as iron,\" reducing the simile to a metaphor by a process of condensation which is the alpha of success in every department of Chinese composition. Thus we have\n\n\u67f3\u8170: a willow waist.\n\u6a31\u6843\u5507: cherry lips.\n\u96de\u808b\u4eba: a \"fowl's sinew\" man; sc. a very thin man.\n\u8805\u982d\u4e8b: a \"fly's head\" affair; sc. tiny, much as we say \"pin's head.\"\n\u5c71\u811a: the foot of the hill.\n\u4e8b\u4e43\u585e: and so the matter slept; sc. dropped.\n\u7236\u6bcd\u5b98: \"father and mother officials\"; sc. magistrates who are entrusted with the more immediate welfare of the people at large.\n\u5076\u6709\u6240\u6b32\u610f\u4e00\u840c\u800c\u5a62\u5df2\u81f4\u4e4b: whenever he wanted anything, the thought would hardly sprout before the maid had brought it to him.\n\u514d\u8d3b\u7b11\u67c4: so as to leave no handle for ridicule.\n\u6c90\u96e8\u68b3\u98a8: washed by the rain and combed by the wind (said of the hardships of travel).\n\u6597\u5ba4: \"a bushel room\"; sc. a small room, no bigger than a bushel measure.\n\u6597\u5b57: \"bushel characters\"; sc. enormous characters, as big as a bushel measure.\n\nMixed metaphors are to be found in Chinese as in other languages, occurring sometimes in the works of the best authors. The following example is taken from the writings of Lan Lu-chow:\u2014\n\u5e73\u5730\u8208\u7121\u98a8\u4e4b\u6ce2: to stir up windless waves upon a level ground; so. to make needless trouble.\n\n3. Personification.\u2014This figure is also known as prosopopoeia. It consists in attributing life and mind to inanimate things. Thus, \u5929 \"heaven,\" which was originally nothing more than the blue \u00e6ther overhead (cf. the Taoist form \u9f8d), has become endowed under the influence of superstition with the form and attributes of a human being. The people speak of \u8001\u5929\u723a \"the old gentleman of the sky,\" and Han W\u00ean-kung in the most famous of all his polished essays writes\n\n\u4e0a\u5929\u9452\u81e8: I call God to witness.\n\nAnd \u00e0 propos of a story in the Liao Chai narrating the total destruction by thunder of a virtuous family, the commentator remarks that he thought it was only wicked people who were thus visited, adding \"Truly the muddles of God Almighty are many indeed!\" \u5929\u516c\u4e4b\u61a4\u61a4\u4e0d\u5df2\u591a\u4e4e. In another passage, however, referring to the preservation of a notably filial son out of the wreck of seventeen or eighteen entire cities destroyed by an earthquake, the same writer says \"After this who will say that God Almighty does not know black from white?\" \u8ab0\u8b02\u5929\u516c\u7121\u7682\u767d\u8036.\n\nEarth is not unfrequently personified in a similar manner; e.g. \u7d42\u65e5\u88ab\u4eba\u6b3a\u795e\u660e\u5929\u5730\u77e5 \"and if after all men do oppress you, the spirits will see it and Heaven and Earth will know it.\" Hence too such phrases as \u540e\u5730 \"queen Earth,\" to which may be added \u61f7\u795e the \"God of Hail,\" \u761f\u795e or \u761f\u9b3c the \"Angel of Pestilence,\" and \u6d77\u9f8d\u738b \"Neptune\" (sc. the sea) also used in the slang sense of \"Davy Jones' locker.\"\n\n4. Allegory.\u2014An allegory is simply a metaphor expanded and sustained through all its parts. It is impossible here to do more than indicate where specimens of Chinese allegories may be found in translation. The \u99ac\u8aaa of Han W\u00ean-kung appeared in the Shanghai Courier of 12th July, 1879; \"Sleep-\nland,\u201d \u7761\u9109\u8a18, by Su Tung-p\u2019o, and \u201cHunger-land,\u201d \u9913\u9109\u8a18, by Lan Lu-chou, were given in vol. VI., No. 6, of the China Review, and several good examples will be found in the Liao Chai, notably \u201cThe Wolf Dream,\u201d \u5922\u75d5. It may not be uninteresting, however, to note here the Chinese equivalents of \u201cmetaphor,\u201d \u201callegory,\u201d etc.; more especially as considerable confusion has prevailed hitherto among sinologues as to the proper employment even of their own native terminology. For instance, Dr. Williams in his Syllabic Dictionary, p. 1128, translates \u5bd3\u8a00 \u201cmetaphorical, by metonymy,\u201d thus attributing to a single term the meanings of two quite distinct rhetorical figures. On pp. 973 and 1129 he further renders \u501f\u610f \u201cmetaphorically, in a figure,\u201d and \u8ad6\u8a00 \u201ca metaphor etc.,\u201d respectively.\n\nAs regards \u501f\u610f, lit. \u201cto borrow the sense,\u201d there can be but little doubt that it is in every way a most apt analogue of \u201cmetaphor,\u201d to which figure its use would seem to be exclusively confined, and it matters little that I have no quotations ready to hand in support of this statement.\n\nAs regards \u8ad6, abundant proofs are to be found showing that when employed by competent writers it has invariably the sense of \u201cillustration.\u201d\n\nE. G.: \u8acb\u4ee5\u6230\u8ad6 \u201cLet me take an illustration from war\u201d (Mencius).\n\n\u4ee5\u8821\u6e2c\u6d77\u55bb\u4eba\u4e4b\u5c0f\u898b \u201cTo measure the sea with a gourd is a phrase illustrative of persons with small mental capacity\u201d; sc. those who would attempt the impossible. See the \u5e7c\u5b78.\n\n\u6b64\u8a00\u96d6\u5c0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u55bb\u5927\u77e3 \u201cThis proverb, although trivial in itself, may be used in illustration of important matters.\u201d See T\u2019ang M\u00eang-lai\u2019s preface to the Liao Chai.\n\n\u7279\u5047\u6b64\u4ee5\u55bb\u5927\u9053\u8033 \u201cspecially availed of in order to illustrate the Great Doctrine.\u201d See\npreface to the \u897f\u57df\u8a18, with reference to Hs\u00fcan Chuang and his travels.\n\n\u5384\u4e4b\u55bb\u66f0\u9b5a\u904a\u91dc\u4e2d: a state of danger is illustrated by the phrase \"a fish in a frying-pan.\"\n\n\u601d\u6155\u55bb\u66f0\u4e00\u65e5\u4e09\u79cb: a state of longing is illustrated by the phrase \"one day like three autumns.\"\n\n\u6025\u4e4b\u55bb\u66f0\u6367\u6f0f\u6c83\u8549: a state of haste is illustrated by the phrase \"carry a colander to water bananas.\"\n\nTo these examples may be added the use of \u610f\u62fe\u55bb\u8a00 as a translation of \"\u00c6sop's Fables,\" by the learned Mun Mong. Scientifically speaking, a fable is a short allegory; but the Chinese have never classified so accurately as that, and are content to regard fables simply as anecdotes of fiction, without reference to their strictly allegorical character.\n\nAs regards \u5bd3, we may safely write it off as the correct translation of \"allegory,\" as witness the following instances:\n\n\u5357\u82b1\u591a\u5bd3\u8a00\u4e4b\u85f7: the Nan-hua (by Chuang-tz\u016d) is full of abstruse allegories. See preface to the \u897f\u57df\u8a18.\n\n\u8003\u57ce\u968d\u5bd3\u8a00\u4e5f: the story of K\u2019ao Ch'\u00eang-huang is allegorical. See comment on story No. 1 of the Liao Chai,\n\nand a final example in which both \u55bb and \u5bd3 occur in the same sentence:\n\n\u9be4\u9d6c\u4e4b\u55bb\u6258\u7269\u5bd3\u8a00: in the illustration of the leviathan changed into a roc, these creatures are employed allegorically. See commentary to the Nan-hua-ching (ad init.).\nCLASS II.\n\n1. Metonymy.\u2014By this figure one word is put for another; the word substituted being, in general terms, an understood accompaniment of the other, or having some existing connection with it.\n\nE. G.: \u5149\u9670 \u201clight and shade\u201d; sc. time.\n\u87d2\u888d \u201cdragon robes\u201d; sc. the office of State to which the right of wearing such robes belongs.\n\u767d\u9996 \u201cwhite head\u201d; sc. an old man. Cf. \u201cgray-beard.\u201d\n\u934b\u958b \u201cthe pot boils\u201d; i.e. the water in it boils.\n\u65bc\u662f\u5c65\u6613\u4ea4\u932f \u201cthereupon ensued a great hurrying to and fro of shoes and slippers\u201d; sc. \u201cof persons.\u201d\n\u767d\u7cb2 \u201cthe white food\u201d; sc. rice.\n\u5b54\u65b9 \u201cthe round and square\u201d; sc. the cash, which is round, with a square hole in the middle.\n\u6625\u942e \u201cthe pound and hoe\u201d; sc. the paddy-bird, so called from the peculiar movements of its head and neck when searching for food in the fields.\n\u9ed1\u751c \u201cthe dark and sweet\u201d; sc. sleep.\n\nThe following is an example of the matter put by metonymy for the materiate:\n\n\u7121\u534a\u5bf8\u9632\u8eab\u4e4b\u9435 \u201cwithout half an inch of iron to defend ourselves with\u201d; precisely as in English we often speak of the steel, meaning of course weapons made of that metal.\n\nEuphemism, which consists in veiling offensive subjects with polite phraseology, is a sub-head of metonymy; and so also is that nameless figure by which words are employed in a sense only to be understood by reference to some historical fact, some quotation either in poetry or in prose, or other similar key. Of the latter, the following are examples:\u2014\n\u5927\u592b \"great officer\"; sc. the pine-tree, so called because the First Universal Emperor (B.C. 221) once sheltered himself from a storm under a group of five pines, and in recognition of their services conferred upon them the title of the \"five great officers.\"\n\n\u6b64\u541b \"this prince\" or \"this gentleman\"; sc. the bamboo, so called because when an ancient worthy was asked why he planted so many bamboos around his dwelling, he replied \u4f55\u53ef\u4e00\u65e5\u7121\u6b64\u541b \"How can one be a single day without this gentleman?\" in allusion to the extended use of the bamboo in almost every department of Chinese everyday life.\n\n\u4ee5\u81e5\u9f8d\u81ea\u4efb \"offered himself for the post of sleeping dragon\"; sc. as commander-in-chief, the famous general Chu-ko Liang having lived in his youth at a place called Sleeping Dragon Hill.\n\nOf euphemism, instances occur most frequently in connection with death and burial. Thus \"to die\" is \u8b1d\u4e16 to excuse oneself from the world, or \u51b3\u6ba4 to burst the tumour; \"grave-clothes\" are \u58fd\u8863 clothes of old age; \"the grave\" is \u591c\u81fa the terrace of night on \u4f73\u57ce the beautiful city, etc., etc. Of the same class are \u5927\u8f9f and \u6b63\u6cd5 for capital punishment, and such others as \u6e29\u67d4\u9109, \u7834\u74dc, \u76f8\u516c, \u5927\u4fbf, \u5c0f\u4fbf,* \u51fa\u606d, \u884c\u623f, \u6566\u502b,\u2020 \u6a31\u6885\u91d8, \u5b50\u5b6b\u5147, \u5b50\u5b6b\u5802, etc., etc., the name of which is legion.\n\n* Hence, a petty official is never spoken of as \u5c0f\u5f01, from the awkward identity of sound.\n\n\u2020 I have once before drawn attention to the unfortunate selection of these two characters to express the sounds Lon-don in the Chinese designation of the London Missionary Society.\n2. **Synecdoche**.\u2014This figure appears under various forms and in various disguises of language. Generally speaking, it may be defined as a rhetorical trope by which the part is put for the whole, or the species for the genus, and *vice versa*.\n\n*E. G.*: \u7121\u4e00\u693d\u4e00\u4eba \u201cnot a rafter (*sc. house*) nor a man left.\u201d Said of a deserted site.\n\n\u98df\u6307\u65e5\u5343\u8a08 \u201ca thousand fingers (*i.e.* one hundred persons) eating daily [at his table].\u201d *Cf.* \u201cso many mouths to feed.\u201d\n\n\u99ac\u5343\u8e44\u7f8e\u4eba\u767e\u8882 \u201ca thousand hoofs of horses and a hundred sleeves of girls\u201d; *sc.* 250 horses and 50 young ladies. *Cf.* \u201cso many head of cattle.\u201d\n\n\u6c60\u9e9f\u7686\u9f8d\u65cf \u201cthe scales (*sc. fish*) in that pond were all of the dragon family.\u201d\n\n\u6bdb\u7fbd\u540c\u985e \u201csame species as hair or feathers,\u201d *i.e.* an animal or a bird\u2014a brute beast.\n\n\u767e\u59d3 \u201cthe hundred names\u201d; *sc.* the people.\n\n\u74dc\u65af\u4ee5\u5f85 \u201cwait until next melon season\u201d; *sc.* next year.\n\n\u4e09\u79cb \u201cthree autumns\u201d; *sc.* three years. *Cf.* \u201ca youth of twenty summers.\u201d\n\n\u5341\u516d\u5bd2\u6691 \u201csixteen colds and hots,\u201d *i.e.* winters and summers; *sc.* sixteen years.\n\nIt is by synecdoche that we apply numbers to things in themselves \u201cnot estimable with numerical precision.\u201d\n\n*E. G.*: \u4e03\u5206\u559c\u4e09\u5206\u4e0d \u201cseven parts glad, three parts not\u201d; *sc.* more glad than sorry.\n\nBy synecdoche, too, the names of celebrated personages are often substituted for the particular qualities by which they acquired their reputation. Thus, the names of \u6bdb\u5b0c Mao Ch\u2019iang and \u897f\u5b50 Hsi Tz\u016d, two famous beauties of antiquity, are frequently put for loveliness in the abstract.\n\nThe following sentence aptly exhibits the facility with which\nin the Chinese language a number of figures may be crowded into a small space:\n\n\u9cf3\u9b03\u96f2\u9b1a\n\nHere we have two distinct metaphors and two examples of synecdoche, all within the compass of four words. These characters mean literally \"wind manes clouds reins,\" or in a more expanded form \"[swift as the] wind manes [used by synecdoche for horses, and countless as the] clouds reins [used by synecdoche for chariots]\"; that is, \"swift horses and countless chariots.\" Similar examples are common enough in Chinese literature, and are easily understood by the general reader. Compare such a sentence as \"Le vin rit dans le cristal,\" an instance of metaphor and metonymy occurring in the short space of six words.\n\nCLASS III.\n\n1. Antithesis.\u2014This figure consists in the institution of a contrast. It enters very largely into all kinds of Chinese composition.\n\nE. G.: \u8ca7\u800c\u6a02: poor but happy.\n\nThe above is an expression of contrast under its simplest form; a more elaborate example would be\n\n\u541b\u53d7\u865b\u8a5b\u6211\u88ab\u5be6\u50b7: you got unsubstantial curses, but I received a real wound,\n\nin which sentence each of the last four words are directly opposed either in form or sense to the corresponding character of the first four.\n\nAs a specimen of secondary antithesis, i.e. where the antagonism of the parts opposed is weaker than in the examples given above, we may take\n\n\u4ee5\u98df\u6108\u98e2\u4ee5\u5b78\u6108\u611a: cure hunger with food; ignorance, by study.\n\nChinese proverbs and household words derive much of their point from the skilful use of this figure.\nE. G.: \u751f\u52de\u4e0d\u5982\u6b7b\u9038: it's better to be dead and happy than living and miserable.\n\n\u6c11\u53ef\u4f7f\u7531\u4e4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u4f7f\u77e5\u4e4b: the people may be led, but they cannot be made to understand.\n\n\u5148\u5230\u70ba\u541b\u5f8c\u5230\u70ba\u81e3: he who arrives first is prince, he who follows is minister only.\n\n\u5148\u708a\u5148\u9910: first at the fire, first with his food, i.e. first come first served.\n\nThese last two sayings, the first of which is of very varied application, exemplify the antithesis (1) expressed and (2) understood, the contrast being in both cases between \u5148 and \u5f8c \"first\" and \"afterwards,\" though in the latter instance the actual antithesis is not visible in the text. To rhetorical antithesis, it may be mentioned en passant, an antagonism is necessary which in merely structural antithesis often almost entirely disappears.\n\nAs an instance of tersely-elegant antithesis of a structural character, the following are selected from a long list:\n\n\u756b\u540c\u51e0\u591c\u5171\u69bb: the same table by day, the same bed at night.

G.: \u4f86\u5f80: lit. \"come go,\" signifies the mutual inter-\ncourse of friends, or any similar form of correspondence.\n\n\u591a\u5c11: lit. \"many few,\" is used for \"number\" in the abstract.\n\nThe following examples will be sufficient to illustrate the use of antithesis in Chinese poetry:\n\n\u6709\u5fc3\u683d\u82b1\u82b1\u4e0d\u767c\n\u7121\u610f\u63d2\u67f3\u67f3\u6210\u9670\nYou may set with all care,\u2014yet the flow'ret will fade,\nWhile the chance-planted willow throws o'er you its shade.\n\n\u842c\u6642\u4e0d\u5982\u676f\u5728\u624b\n\u4eba\u751f\u5e7e\u898b\u6708\u7576\u982d\nThe cup's in the hand: seize the hour ere 'tis fled;\nHow seldom in life is the moon overhead!\n\nDisarrangement of the strictly antithetical order of words is comparatively rare.\n\nE. G.: \u6211\u4e0d\u4ee5\u8ca7\u5bcc\u70ba\u6709\u7121: I am not talking about what the rich can afford and the poor can not.\n\n\u898f\u77e9\u65b9\u5713\u4e4b\u81f3\u4e5f: the compasses and the square are the embodiment of the rectangular and the round.\n\nThere exists one single sentence in the Chinese language for which, like silver with regard to rhyme, no corresponding antithesis can be constructed. It is\n\n\u7159\u9396\u6c60\u5858\u67f3: smoke envelops the willows by the pond.\n\nIn the characters here employed all the five elements are already present, thus leaving according to Chinese rules no field from which to draw corresponding antithetical terms.\n\n2. Epigram.\u2014Epigram is a term which, like several others in rhetorical use, has been modified by lapse of time. It seems to have been originally applied to inscriptions, and from that to have developed into \"a short poem containing some single\nthought pointedly expressed,\" taking in on its way all kinds of titles, advertisements, superscriptions, etc., etc., which might afford scope for the play of epigrammatic wit.\n\nAn epigram need not of course be a poem, though it should be short; and it should be, strictly speaking, of such a nature as to rouse the mind by some \"conflict or contradiction between the form of the language and the meaning really conveyed.\" Thus it will be seen that the boundary-line between Epigram and Antithesis is not very clearly defined; unless we confine ourselves, in common with the best authorities, to such specimens as are distinguished by brevity and some play on words therein contained. That Chinaman was of an epigrammatic turn of mind who announced some years ago that\n\nIn K'ang Hsi's dictionary there is a word wrong, setting all the literati of Kiang-su by the ears until some one discovered that the word \"wrong\" was the word in question.\n\nIt may be mentioned in parentheses that the Pun is a sub-head of Epigram; and for want of a better example we may take the old joke of the man who declared he was what sounded like \u9053\u58eb chin shih \"a graduate of the highest degree,\" but which he afterwards explained to be \u8fd1\u8996\u773c chin shih yen \"near-sighted\"; or that of the bashful young man who was likened to a country carpenter because he had only \u4e00\u9336 \"one saw,\" which has precisely the same sound in Chinese as \u4e00\u53e5 \"one sentence,\" sc. nothing to say for himself.\n\nIt was decidedly epigrammatic to say that men mostly prefer\n\nTheir own compositions, but their friends' wives.\n\nSo also it was an epigram by which a certain gentleman notified the newly-engaged tutor for his son that he should not squeeze the hand of the waiting-maid who brought him breakfast and dinner:\n\nThe tutor's reply was in a similar strain:\n\n\u4eba\u8a00\u70ba\u4fe1,\u6771\u5bb6\u4ee5\u5f8c\u52ff\u4fe1\u4eba\u8a00.\n3. Hyperbole.\u2014\u9ed1\u5b50\u5f48\u4e38\u6975\u8a00\u81f3\u5c0f\u4e4b\u9091: \u201ca black speck,\u201d or \u201ca pill\u201d; these are hyperbolical expressions for a very small District. (See the \u7d04\u5b78.)\n\nHyperbole is the figure by which anything is excessively magnified or diminished, beyond the limits of truth. Of such a kind is the phrase \u6597\u5ba4 (see Metaphor) for \u201ca house no bigger than a bushel measure.\u201d Examples are common enough.\n\nE. G.: \u50cf\u82e5\u5c71\u5cb3\u5982\u5169\u65e5: he was as tall as a mountain, and his eyes were like two suns.\n\n\u99ed\u5982\u5929\u964d: as scared as if the sky had fallen.\n\u75be\u82e5\u4e58\u98a8: swift as if riding on the wind.\n\u9f3e\u547c\u96f7\u52d5: he snored with a noise like thunder.\n\u50be\u570b: a nation overthrower; sc. a very beautiful woman.\n\n\u842c\u91cc\u9577\u57ce: the 10,000 li rampart; sc. the Great Wall.\n\nApropos of 10,000 li (say 3,000 miles) the landscapes of the celebrated painter Wang Fei were said to have been so artfully executed that the eye could wander over scenery to this extent (\u842c\u91cc\u70ba\u9060) all within the narrow area of an ordinary fan.\n\nThe Chinese delight in hyperbole. They speak of their children as \u201cdogs,\u201d of their friends as \u201cprinces,\u201d of the Heir Apparent as \u201ca thousand autumns,\u201d of the Emperor as \u201cLord of Ten Thousand Years,\u201d and of China as \u201call beneath the canopy of the sky.\u201d The records of their antiquity teem with examples; while the records themselves go back to a period of 2,269,360 years ago.\n\nMencius, on one occasion, took the trouble to point out that hyperbole was a figure of rhetoric, and that its terms should not be literally construed. \u201cWe must not understand,\u201d said he, \u201cthat passage in the Odes\u2014\u2018of the black-haired people of Chow, not a single one was left \u5468\u9918\u9ece\u6c11\u9761\u6709\u5b50\u907a\u2019\u2014in its literal sense.\u201d\n\n4. Climax.\u2014Of this, the \u201cladder\u201d figure, so called because the mind is carried, as it were rung by rung, up an ascending\nscale until the final point is reached, the \u5927\u5b78 Ta Hs\u00fco furnishes no inconsiderable number of examples. E. G.:\u2014\n\n\u6b32\u6cbb\u5176\u570b\u8005\u5148\u9f4a\u5176\u5bb6\uff0c\u6b32\u9f4a\u5176\u5bb6\u8005\u5148\u4fee\u5176\u8eab\uff0c\n\u6b32\u4fee\u5176\u8eab\u8005\u5148\u6b63\u5176\u5fc3\uff0c\u6b32\u6b63\u5176\u5fc3\u8005\n\u5148\u8aa0\u5176\u610f\uff0c\u6b32\u8aa0\u5176\u610f\u8005\u5148\u81f4\u5176\u77e5\n\n\"The ancients\" desirous of good government in the State, began by good order in the family; to attain good order in the family, each began by attending to his own personal demeanour; to attain to proper personal demeanour, it was necessary to rectify the heart; to rectify the heart, it was necessary to refine the thoughts; and to refine the thoughts, it was necessary to extend knowledge.\"\n\n5. Interrogation.\u2014This figure, employed to surround a proposition with extra rhetorical force, is commonly employed by Chinese authors. The very first chapter of the Confucian Discourses opens with three good examples. The first is\u2014\n\n\u5b78\u800c\u6642\u7fd2\u4e4b\u4e0d\u4ea6\u8aaa\u4e4e\n\nLit. To learn, and from time to time to practice (what is learnt), is not that pleasant?\n\nThe two following quotations are in a lighter style:\u2014\n\n\u53d7\u4eba\u6578\u91d1\u4fbf\u7576\u6df9\u7981\u6b7b\u8036: because I have taken a few pieces of a man's money, is he to shut me up to death, eh?\n\n\u6211\u867d\u8ca7\u56fa\u66ff\u7e2b\u4e4b\u8cab\u5f7c\u4ee5\u57f7\u97ad\u767c\u8de1\u4f55\u6562\u9042\u5ee2\u6575: though poor, I am descended from a noble family, and shall this carter fellow presume to take my daughter for his concubine?\n\nFor two further examples, see Personification.\n\n6. Exclamation.\u2014Of this figure one example will doubtless suffice.\n\"Alas!\" said Confucius, \"there is no one who appreciates me.\"\n\nMany similar instances are to be found (e.g.) in the \u66f8\u7d93, where they are usually introduced by some such words as \u9cf4\u547c. So also the proverbial saying\u2014\n\n\u9cf4\u547c\u54c0\u54c9\n\u4eba\u6b7b\u96e3\u731c.\n\n7. Apostrophe.\u2014This figure consists in suddenly addressing somebody, or something, absent, as if they were present. Of such kind are invocations to deities and devils, which are common enough and are generally prefaced by \u795d\u66f0, or \u79b1\u66f0.\n\nE.G.: \u98f2\u5247\u9179\u5730\u795d\u66f0\u6cb3\u4e2d\u6eba\u9b3c\u5f97\u98f2: and when he drank, he would pour out a libation on the ground and utter the following invocation:\u2014\"Drink, too, ye drowned spirits of the river!\"\n\nFor further examples, see the \u66f8\u7d93 passim.\n\n8. Innuendo.\u2014When one Chinaman says that another reminds him of the fan used by the ruler of the Infernal Regions, he avails himself of an innuendo; for tradition has it that the fan in question is black inside, and black-heartedness has much the same signification in China as elsewhere. So also when he speaks of people or things as \u5edf\u8ca8 \"temple wares\" (i.e. the miscellaneous articles sold at stalls in temples on religious festivals), he is suggesting that they cannot be depended upon \u9760\u4e0d\u4f4f. A paragraph in the Shanghai Courier recently noted the destruction by fire of an ice-house, and the writer very naturally remarked that it was the last place where he should have expected a fire to break out. Now the Chinese frequently use as an innuendo the phrase \u706b\u71d2\u51b0\u7a96 \"an ice-house burnt down,\" as applied to events which seem to be a special manifestation of the will of Heaven \u5929\u610f, or destiny. It is also an innuendo to liken a man to a lamp on the top of an 18-foot pole \u4e08\u516b\u7684\u71c8\u53f0. Such a lamp\nthrows indeed its light to a distance, but leaves its own immediate neighbourhood in gloom \u7167\u9060\u4e0d\u7167\u8fd1; and the sous-entendu is that the individual in question throws more light upon the faults of others than upon his own. It is an innuendo to call a man an \"earthenware cock\" \u78c1\u516c\u96de, the implication being that you can't pull a hair out of him \u4e00\u6bdb\u4e0d\u62d4, sc. that he is a stingy fellow. Degeneration in a family is hinted at by the phrase \"a swan hatching ducks\" \u4ed9\u9db4\u990a\u9d28\u5b50, and a cruel mandarin is often spoken of as a \"blacksmith official\" \u9435\u5320\u4f5c\u5b98 whose only thought is to strike \u53ea\u662f\u6253.\n\n9. Irony.\u2014It is well known that the sense now attached to this term is of comparatively modern date. Irony, in the time of Aristotle, signified \"saying less than was meant,\" whereas we now understand by it \"saying the opposite to what is meant,\" a figure known to the ancients as Litotes.\n\nE. G.: \u55ce\u59bb\u5b50\u5df2\u5927\u60e0 \"that you should sell your wife and child was already very kind of you,\u2014\u201d which words are spoken by an angry wife to whom her dissolute husband is about to do some further injury.\n\nThe above is irony direct; as an example of the indirect I may quote the following story from the Liao Chai. A virtuous young man goes to visit his elder brother who holds office in a distant part of the empire, and while residing in his yam\u00ean becomes aware of a very extensive system of bribery and corruption which is daily practised there, to the utter exclusion of anything at all like justice or impartiality. With tears in his eyes he reports what he has seen and heard to his brother, who however only laughs at him and says, \u5f1f\u65e5\u5c45\u8861\u8305\u6545\u4e0d\u77e5\u4ed5\u9014\u4e4b\u95dc\u7aca\u8033\u9edc\u965f\u4e4b\u6b0a\u5728\u4e0a\u81fa\u4e0d\u5728\u767e\u59d3\u4f55\u8853\u5fa9\u4ee4\u4e0a\u81fa\u559c\u4e5f... \u201cMy brother, your life has been spent in a cottage, and therefore you do not know the ins and outs of official life. We look for our advancement or dismissal to our superior officers, not to the people; hence, he who\ngratifies those in authority over him is the good public servant. But if a man were to occupy himself with the interests of the people, how could he at the same time cause gratification to his superior officers?\"\n\nThe irony in this passage is of course that of the author and not of the speaker in the dialogue.\n\nADDENDUM.\n\nEllipsis.\u2014This figure belongs, strictly speaking, to the province of Grammar, though some writers have given it a place in treatises nominally confined to Rhetoric alone. The written and spoken languages of China teem with interesting examples. To begin with a simple instance: we generally find \u67e5\u7167 in place of the full expression \u67e5\u8003\u7167\u5c0d. So \u897f\u5546 is an ellipsis which might at first sight be understood as applying to European merchants, and not, as is the case, to the native bankers of Shansi, who are also familiarly known as \u8001\u897f\u5152 or \u897f\u8001. Passing on to more recondite examples, oft-times difficult of expansion and occasionally even of explanation, we have\n\n\u738b\u77e2\u4e0d\u4ed6: lit. Wang-arrow-not-he; i.e., Wang swore he would never marry anybody else.\n\n\u9ce5\u7a93\u6d2a\u6848: lit. fowl-window-Hung-table; i.e., she made a very good wife, the full expansion being, as given by a writer in the China Mail, \"For many years she rose at cockcrow, as soon as dawn first glimmered through the window. She was as faithful as M\u00eang Kuang, the wife of Liang Hung, who, when eating, would raise the table up to her brow as a token of respect.\"\n\n\u59be\u671b\u541b\u5982\u6b72: lit. concubine-long-prince-like-year; i.e., \"Every day has seemed a year to\nme since you left,\" being of course an address from a wife to a husband.\n\nA beginner might fairly stumble over \u98df\u5feb, but the insertion of \u99ac between the two characters makes the phrase easily intelligible as \"ordered the constable.\" So also \u7dbf\u9ec3 \"dark-yellow\" is no mean puzzle, until its expansion into \u7dbf\u8863\u9ec3\u51a0 \"dark robes, yellow caps\" points at once to the priests who are thus specially distinguished. But of all examples of ellipsis pure and simple, i.e. where the knowledge of no allusion \u5178\u53e4 is necessary to elucidate the sense, commend us to an example quoted in the China Review by Mr. Parker: \u5165\u4e00\u80fd\u4e4b\u5df2\u767e\u4e4b \"If [any other] man can [do] it [in] one [day], [then] I [will give a] hundred [days to] it [rather than fail].\"\nERRATA.\n\nPage 4 Line 2 for 'that' read 'the sense.'\n,, 7 ,, 13 ,, 'Mun Mong' read 'Mun Mooy.'\n,, 10 ,, 8 from below, for \u5206 read \u5206.\n,, 11 ,, 3 for \u98a8 read \u98a8.\n,, 11 ,, 12 from below, for \u5bec read \u5bec.\n,, 16 ,, 16 for 'employed' read 'intended.'\n,, 16 ,, 8 from below, for \u866b read \u866b.\n,, 17 ,, 12 ,, ,, ,, \u8ca7 ,, \u8ca8.\n,, 18 ,, 4 ,, ,, before \u4f55\u8853\u5fa9\u4ee4\u4e0a\u81fa\u559c\u4e5f insert \u4e0a\u81fa\u559c\u4fbf\u662f\u597d\u5b98\u611b\u767e\u59d3.\nARTICLE II.\n\nNOTES ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NAGASAKI.*\n\nBy H. B. GUPPY, M.B.,\nSURGEON, R.N.\n\nThe remarkable manner in which this part of the island of Kiusiu is cut up by its several gulfs into the three extended peninsulas of Simabara, Nagasaki, and Omura, is a feature in its surface-geography, which bears especial reference to the configuration of the region at no distant geological period. Although it is an elevated district, considered as a whole,\u2014the hills in the more immediate vicinity of Nagasaki varying between 500 and 1,500 feet in height, while Mount Unzen in the Simabara peninsula rises to about 4,700 feet above the sea;\u2014yet there are low-lying regions situated at the base of the peninsulas, which a depression of the land to the extent of about two hundred feet would completely submerge. That there has been an elevation of this amount at some recent period, is demonstrated by the occurrence of a loose bed of water-worn rock fragments, which is exposed at the top of a deep cutting, through which the Nagasaki road descends to the village of Tokeets; and the following description of the transformed topography of this region at that period is not a mere speculation of my own, but is founded on numerous observations made in the several localities concerned.\n\nAt such a period the Gulfs of Omura and Simabara by uniting would isolate a large region, extending from the present\n\n* Read before the Society on the 31st March, 1882.\nnarrow entrance to the Gulf of Omura to the southernmost extremity of the Simabara Peninsula, and forming an island about forty miles in length. This would be again divided into four smaller islands in the following manner:\u2014by the submergence of its low-lying isthmus the Simabara Peninsula would be transformed into a mountainous island; whilst the sea, by occupying the line of the present road between Tokeets and Nagasaki, would completely disconnect the peninsula which forms the western side of the Gulf of Omura; and the Nagasaki Peninsula would in its turn form the southern prolongation of another island, produced by the formation of the Tokeets channel on west, and by the junction of the Gulf of Omura and Yagami Bay on the east, somewhere along the line of the present road between Yagami and the village of Isahaye; lastly, a fourth, though smaller, island would be formed by the Simabara strait on the east and by the Isahaye and Yagami channel on the west. In such a manner would this region now continuous be transformed into a group of large islands; and, that this was the actual condition of this region at a very recent geological period, I have not the slightest doubt.\n\nBefore treating of the subject proper of this paper, I must premise by observing that I shall limit myself to the more prominent geological features of this region; which, on account of the complexity of detail which it presents, requires for its more thorough examination a greater time than I was able to devote to it. Forming the axis or backbone of the base of the Nagasaki Peninsula, are beds of mica-schist and allied schistose rocks; which, whilst they are for the most part concealed on the hill-sides overlooking the town by masses of trachyte occasionally porphyritic, a dark felsitic trap, and agglomerate, are freely exposed to view on the eastern slope of the peninsula, more particularly in the vicinity of the village of Mogi. On crossing the harbour and ascending the hills on the western side, the same agglomerate and trachytic rocks are found; and although I was unable to find the mica-schist in situ, yet detached fragments of this rock gave evidence of its vicinity.\nTurning to the district north of Nagasaki, we observe that the road from that town to Tokeets, as it skirts round the head of the harbour to cross the narrow isthmus of the Omura Peninsula, follows a line of cliff formed of agglomerate overlying a light-coloured friable trachyte; and long after the harbour is left behind, for a distance of from two to three miles, the road continues to skirt the base of this inland cliff, following in truth the line of the ancient channel already referred to in this paper. As one proceeds towards Tokeets, the trachyte assumes a more compact texture; and at a point where the road, which has previously been confined to a level plain, enters the hills, about four miles from Nagasaki, this rock exhibits a spheroidal structure, each spheroid being about three feet in diameter and enclosing within its concentric coats a nucleus of the size of a 32-lb. shot. A few steps further on, one observes an intrusion of trap, probably a phonolite: and from this point the trachyte, as exhibited in a slight declivity which has been carved or hewn out into niches for the reception of stone figures, assumes a darker colour. When about a mile and a half or two miles from Tokeets, the road, which has by this time reached its highest elevation from 175 to 200 feet above the sea, dips down into a deep cutting, at the top of which occurs the bed of water-worn rock-fragments which has been alluded to above. About half-way down the cutting, extensive dikes of a dark trap-rock\u2014probably diabase\u2014protrude through a quartz-porphyry; whilst near the foot of the cutting, occurs another small dike of blue basalt: all these dikes, which trend in an east and west direction, are vertical protrusions. On approaching Tokeets, the trachyte again appears; and near the bend in the road which suddenly displays to view the picturesque bay of this village, this rock exhibits a porphyritic structure. Two huge masses of this porphyritic trachyte, which overlook the road, have received the name of \"The Giant's Head\" from the Japanese, on account of the rude resemblance which they present to a human head and bust.\n\nAbout half a mile to the east of the Tokeets road, lies the\nhamlet of Meecheno, where exists a thermal spring. When I visited this spring in November 1879, I found its temperature, which was $74^\\circ$ F., to be $12^\\circ$ above that of the surrounding air: it had no odour, was quite clear, and, as the villagers informed me, was fit for drinking purposes: it contains, as I subsequently found, a moderate amount of lime in solution. To its existence the hamlet of Meecheno probably owes its being; and the inhabitants by conducting the water to a neighbouring bath-house employ artificial means to raise it to a temperature for bathing.\n\nThe rock in the vicinity of the spring appears to be an \"altered\" argillite: whilst a very tough mottled phonolite occurs at the base of a hill to the eastward of Meecheno,\u2014a granitic rock destitute of mica forming the summit,\u2014and an \"altered\" argillite intervening between the two. In the bed of the stream, which flows from the lower end of the valley and crosses the Tokoets road about a mile and a quarter from the head of the harbour, I observed a highly calcareous and siliceous rock, followed in the lower portion of the stream by basaltic and trachytic porphyries.\n\nAn interesting traverse may be made along the road from Yagami to Isahaye,\u2014a distance of eight or nine miles,\u2014following the line of the original channel that once united the Gulf of Omura with Yagami Bay. The road between the villages of Heemi and Yagami displays in its cuttings agglomerate and beds of a fine-grained sandstone and shale which dip about $50^\\circ$ to the west. Proceeding by the road to Isahaye, one observes a light-coloured eurite to be the prevailing rock as far as the hamlet of Koga, about two and a half miles from Yagami. Beyond Koga, a region of trachytic porphyry begins;\u2014specimens of this rock which I obtained exhibited fine crystals of glassy felspar. This trachyte is followed by a speckled sandstone* dipping to the north-west at an angle of $40^\\circ$. On approaching the shore of the Gulf of Omura, beds of sand-\n\n---\n\n* This same speckled sandstone is to be observed in the hamlet of Koga, dipping about $45^\\circ$ to the eastward.\nstone and shale are observed dipping $35^\\circ$ to the north-west: and as the road passes through the village of Kaieesa, about two miles from Isahaye, a dislocation of these beds is displayed in a cutting, which exhibits not only an alteration in the dip but a twisting round of the line of strike. I traced the sandstone and shale as far as the village of Isahaye. Striking off to the north-west in the direction of the town of Omura, about seven miles distant, the road for the first two miles lies along the same low-lying country, with fragments of a dark phonolite lying on the surface. It then crosses a hill elevated between 600 and 700 feet above the waters of the Gulf; a sandstone dipping gently to the south-south-east forms the lower two-thirds of this hill; whilst its summit displays a dark grey phonolite. Before reaching Omura the road crosses a succession of low hills, which exhibit at rare intervals a decomposed felspathic rock; whilst a dark pitchstone is to be observed in the hill overlooking the town.\n\nNot the least interesting locality of the region to which this paper refers, is that of the Simabara Peninsula. This rugged promontory attains in the cloud-topped peaks of Unzen an elevation of not less than 4,700 feet above the sea* (measurement by aneroid). Tradition has located an active volcano on the summit of this mountain: and, that a similar belief is current at the present day, the following testimony will be sufficient to cite. The China and Japan Sea Directory, for as recent a period as 1873, refers to an active volcano in the centre of the peninsula, \"over which a dark cloud of smoke usually rests;\" whilst Dr. S. W.

The only estimate I have been able to find is that of 3,500 feet, which I have derived from a \"Lecture on Japan,\" by S. W. Williams, LL D., published in the Journal of the N.-C. B. of the Royal Asiatic Society for May 1859: it is greatly under-estimated.\nwriter in the \"Treaty Ports of China and Japan\" describing the town of Simabara (Minato) as \"backed by a huge mountain whence the hidden fires still send up a gentle stream of smoke on a cloudless day.\" There would appear to be some facts which explain this current belief: and history in truth relates, that in 1792 or 1793 (the date varies in different accounts) there was a violent volcanic eruption in this mountain, which, being attended by a most disastrous earthquake, not only devastated the neighbouring country, destroying 53,000 of the inhabitants, but is said to have been felt through the whole of Kiusiu, and to have permanently affected the adjacent coast-line and territory of the province of Higo. There is little doubt, but that the striking resemblance, which Unzen presents to a truncated cone, often capped by clouds, when viewed from the hills overlooking the village of Mogi, affords an explanation of the persistence of this popular error as to its present activity. For loth as I am to detract from the romance which has been vulgarly attached to the volcano of Simabara, I grieve to write, that not only did I observe that this mountain loses its volcanic profile when regarded from other points of view, but that having stood on one of Unzen's highest summits and having crossed the peninsula from west to east, I failed to find any signs of the existence of an active volcanic vent. Yet I may urge, that the occurrence on the western flanks of this mountain of the hot springs of Wobama, Kojeego, and Unzen, which are probably intimately connected in their past history with the disastrous earthquake of last century, does not entirely divest this mountainous Peninsula of Simabara of its claims to be included within the present dominion of Vulcan.\n\nCommencing the ascent from the fishing-village of Wobama on the western shore of the peninsula, the path led me up through the zone of trees, which extends up the mountain slopes to a height of about 1,100 feet above the sea.* Rising gra-\n\n* In the vicinity of Nagasaki the upper limit of the zone of trees is very marked when viewed from the town; its level being from 900 to 1,000 feet above the sea.\ndually from a height of 1,700 feet to a level of 2,500 feet, the higher portion of the peninsula may be best described as an extended plateau, from which springs the double peak of Unzen which attains another 2,000 feet or more of elevation. Such are the more conspicuous physical features of this region.\n\nWith regard to its more strictly geological characters, I may remark that a sanidine-trachyte, rendered porphyritic by the fine crystals of glassy felspar embedded in its matrix, is the prevailing rock on both the eastern and western slopes of this mountainous peninsula; and that it extends from the sea-level up to the eastern summit of the double peak. This porphyritic trachyte varies somewhat in its characters: on the east slopes, the matrix appears to be more felspathic and is of a lighter colour than in the rock of the opposite side of the mountain; whilst regular crystals of hornblende are often associated with those of the sanidine, particularly in the neighbourhood of Minato: on the west slopes, the matrix is of a light bluish colour, and becomes strangely altered in the vicinity of the hot springs of Kojego and Unzen,\u2014a subject to be immediately considered.\n\nOverlooking the populous town of Minato which is situated on the eastern shore of the Simabara Peninsula, there rises an abrupt desolate-looking hill which is completely detached from the main mountain-mass. The \"why-and-wherefore\" of its precipitous sides, the explanation of its peculiar form and of the strangeness of its situation, must have often afforded subjects for speculation to the casual visitor, if not to the inhabitants of the locality. It is in truth one of those hills, which\u2014to employ the figurative language of Dr. Macculloch\u2014\"seem as if they had tumbled from the clouds.\" Tradition avers\u2014and tradition generally has something to say in these matters\u2014that during one of the earthquakes which have devastated the district of Simabara, this hill was detached and parted asunder from the parent-mass. But whether this explanation is a satisfactory one, I had neither the time nor the opportunity to determine.\nBy far the most attractive localities for the mere sight-seer, are those of the hot sulphur-springs of Wobama, Kojuego, and Unzen. The hot springs of Wobama, a fishing village to which I have already alluded as being situated on the west shore of the peninsula, occur close to the water's edge. A series of stone bathing-pools has been built around the springs;\u2014the water of which evolves a large quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen, its unpleasant odour tainting the air of the neighbouring streets. Most of the bathing-pools are accessible to the sea at certain heights of the tide; and these are the baths most frequented by both real and imaginary invalids: their temperature I found to be $82^\\circ$ F., about $8^\\circ$ above the temperature of the surrounding air. On placing the thermometer in a bath which was inaccessible to the sea, it rose to $112^\\circ$ F., a temperature which appeared to be too high to permit of its general use amongst the frequenters of the springs.\n\nI may best describe the sulphur-springs of Kojuego, which are elevated rather more than 2,000 feet above the sea, as bubbling up briskly at a temperature of $182^\\circ$ F. into a pool about fifteen yards across. The water, which is milky in appearance from the deposit of sulphides and the other products of the decomposed trachyte, exhales a powerful sulphureous odour: and after it has been allowed to run down into some baths in the hamlet of Kojuego, which is situated immediately below the springs, it becomes sufficiently reduced in temperature to allow of its being used for the purposes of bathing. The surface of the ground in the vicinity of the springs is warm, and often undermined; and I was informed that fatal accidents have sometimes occurred from the ground giving away beneath the feet.\n\nA walk of about twenty minutes from Kojuego will bring the visitor to the hot springs of Unzen, where these phenomena are exhibited in their grandest form. Some time before arriving there he will have noticed dense clouds of white vapour ascending in the distance, and that the milky-looking streams over which he has to cross retain a portion of their original\nwarmth. His first impression of these hot springs of Unzen will hardly be a favourable one; and he will carry away with him a vivid recollection of \"the dismal situation waste and wild\" which was there presented to his view. Bubbling up furiously over a whitened and sterile surface of some acres are several boiling springs; whilst the atmosphere in their vicinity is powerfully impregnated with sulphureous vapours. The whitened crust which forms the surface is often so hot that even with a thick pair of boots on the feet it is necessary to be constantly changing one's ground; whilst it is pierced in many places by small holes, from which issue jets of steam that now and then remind the visitor rather sharply of their proximity. A thermometer, which I placed in one of the springs, rose to $202^\\circ$ F.; but as this locality is elevated about 2,200 feet above the level of the sea, this observation represents an actual amount of heat of $6^\\circ$ below the boiling-point of this elevation\u2014$208^\\circ$ F.\u2014, a temperature which is probably attained at a short distance from the surface. The undermining of the ground has proceeded to such a degree in some places that there is a danger of the thin crust yielding underfoot; and to avoid a somewhat awkward introduction into the realms of Tartarus, it would be advisable to procure the services of an old Buddhist priest who resides in an adjacent temple.\n\nThe manner in which the sanidine-trachyte of the district has been decomposed and altered by the chemical and thermal influence of these hot springs,\u2014a phenomenon exhibited on a lesser scale at Kojuego,\u2014is worth a moment's consideration; and the visitor who may have previously stood in the midst of the Solfatara of Naples will be particularly impressed by the similarity in the appearance of the two localities, a resemblance which is due in both cases to the influence of sulphureous vapours on trachytic rocks. By the decomposition of the felspathic constituents and especially of the crystals of glassy felspar, the trachyte has become whitened and often laminated; and the most advanced degree of these changes may be observed in the thinned surface-crust around each spring, in the\nmasses of pure white rock much resembling the Cornish Kaolin which lie on the ground, and lastly in the whiteness of the adjacent cliffs and hill-slopes. Mr Darwin in his \"Geological Observations\" describes a very similar change produced in a trachytic rock in the island of Terceira, one of the Azores, by the action of steam issuing from fissures.\n\nBefore leaving the subject of Simabara, I should refer to the long and narrow isthmus which connects its peninsula with the mainland of Kiusiu. The eastern half of this isthmus, which consists of a low and level tract of land well cultivated and dotted over with numerous hamlets and villages, is formed of the material arising from the degradation of the trachytic porphyry of Simabara; and in some cliffs, at present removed a short distance from the high-water line, I observed the same material to be occasionally stratified. But a small amount of depression would be required to submerge this low-lying portion of the isthmus; and doubtless there was a time, geologically recent, when the elevated peaks of Unzen formed a lofty island-mountain in the midst of the Gulf of Simabara,\u2014a period when the extensive tracts of low-land which fringe the eastern and northern shores of the present peninsula were also covered by the waves. On the other hand, the surface of the western half of the isthmus is broken by groups of low hills, generally from 300 to 400 feet in height. Walking along the southern border of this neck of land, I observed the prevailing rock in this portion of the isthmus to be a dark trap finely speckled with felspar.\n\nI will conclude this paper with a description of the geology of Mogi Bay,\u2014a locality which affords, in my opinion, a key to the geological history of the whole neighbourhood of Nagasaki. Whilst the southern border of the bay is composed of the schistose rocks of the district which extend down to the sea, the observer will meet with formations of a very different character on the opposite side. The point immediately north of the village of Mogi is formed of a large dike of columnar\nbasalt, which must have been originally protruded in an easterly direction at an angle of 15\u00b0 with the horizon. Adhering to the upper surface of the basalt are fragments of a curious quartzose rock, probably an \"altered\" mica schist. On rounding this point one enters a small cove, on the northern side of which beds of fawn-coloured shale and fine-grained sandstone, and of a rock intermediate in character, appear in the cliffs dipping to the N.W.\u2014W.N.W. at an angle of from five to seven degrees.\n\nIn these recent beds the leaves of dicotyledonous plants are beautifully preserved, the venation in particular being retained in a very perfect condition. In some places I observed the fine layers of the shale to be curiously contorted,\u2014an indication of their having been subjected to some disturbance previous to their consolidation. At the base of the sedimentary beds occurs a thin layer of conglomerate, which is composed of fragments of schistose rock and of the \"altered\" rock before alluded to. Overlying and conformable to these shales and sandstones are a series of bedded volcanic agglomerates, formed of fragments of a porphyritic trachyte and occasionally of a schistose rock embedded in a matrix of volcanic tuff, which varies in colour from white to grey. Thin seams of this tuff are interstratified with the sandstone and shale previously described: and the same agglomerate and tuffs, bedded and inclined 15\u00b0 to the north-east, are to be observed forming the steep cliffs on the northern border of Mogi Bay. It is worthy of note that some hand-specimens of the porphyritic trachyte from this volcanic agglomerate appear to me identical in their characters with the trachyte of the Simabara Peninsula.\n\nFrom the foregoing description of the leading features presented by the district of Mogi Bay, it will be manifest that we find there some important circumstantial evidences of the order of succession of the different formations, which will be of some service in unravelling the geology of the other portions of this region. First in order of age must be placed the schistose rocks\nof the Nagasaki Peninsula; and I opine that the extensive series of the felsitic traps, and of the trachytes of Nagasaki and of Simabara, with the associated igneous rocks, are the work of a succeeding age of volcanic activity. Then followed the intrusion of such basaltic dikes as we see at Mogi and in the cutting above Tokeets; the formation of which was probably succeeded by a period of partial abatement of the volcanic forces. At such a time were deposited the sandstones and leaf-bearing shales of Mogi Bay, with the other sedimentary beds of the district: and amongst these, we must include the fossiliferous limestone and calcareous sandstone\u2014also fossiliferous\u2014of Iwosima, an island at the entrance of the Bay of Nagasaki; together with the coal-bearing sandstones of Takosima, another adjacent island.* But that the subterranean forces were not completely at rest during the deposition of these sedimentary formations, we have a sufficient demonstration in the occasional contortion of the shale at Mogi Bay, and in the intercalation now and then amongst these beds of thin seams of volcanic tuff, and\u2014I may also add\u2014in the crushed condition of many of the fossil shells embedded in the calcareous strata of Iwosima. At a yet later period the volcanic forces seem to have resumed their former sway; and we now behold, in the great thicknesses of agglomerates and tuffs which overlie the shales of Mogi Bay, the accumulated effects of their operations. And lastly, there ensued that general upheaval of the whole region, which, whilst it transformed an archipelago into a group of peninsulas, gave to Omura a gulf, to Simabara a bay, and to Nagasaki her far-famed harbour.\n\n* For some further information with regard to the coal-fields of Takosima vide a paper by Mr. T. W. Kingsmill, published in the Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for December, 1868.\nARTICLE III.\n\nNOTES ON THE SOUTH COAST OF SAGHALIEN.*\n\nBy GEO. C. ANDERSON.\n\nOKUI-KOTAN BAY\n\nIs an anchorage on the South Coast of Saghalien and is used as a station for collecting and drying seaweed. The shore is fronted by terrace-like cliffs, with out-crops of shale and probably coal, which I had no time to examine closely. Behind the land rises in wooded ridges, presenting the usual Saghalien aspect. A few miles further east there is a lofty mountain range with several fine peaks which are useful landmarks in making the anchorage, here and at the Convict Station Karsakof, which is about six miles further to the westward, round Cape Endouma.\n\nA fine stream of fresh water runs into the sea at Okiu-Kotan and ships' boats can water with great ease, there being a deep hole close to the beach and water sufficient to float any ship's boat close up to it. Trout were observed at the mouth of the stream. The Bay is sheltered from west round by north to S.E., but the bottom is rock. The rise and fall of tide appears to be about 4 feet by the marks on the rocks. I made a hasty rough survey of the Bay and found the water shoal gradually to 3 fathoms, and then rather suddenly to 13 feet. The best plan is to stand in with the hut bearing about N.N.W., and anchor in 4 fathoms; a vessel is then quite far enough in. The\n\n* Read before the Society on the 26th September 1881.\ntrend of the valleys on this part of the coast is north and south, while round Cape Endouma it is east and west. The Russians have constructed a tolerably good road from Karsakof round to a village called Poran Tomarie, and I heard that this road was to be carried on to Boussie on the east-side of Aniwa Bay, and will probably pass close to Okui-Kotan and Chupisani.\n\nThere is good wild-fowl shooting to be had at the mouth of the large river to the westward of Karsakof, but the musquitoes are very troublesome in the summer. Hazel grouse* are found in the woods, and deer have been seen. Bears are numerous according to the Russian officers. Sea-lions, seals, and whales I have seen myself.\n\nA number of Japanese junks come here in the summer and take away salmon and herrings. There is a Japanese consul or commercial agent at Karsakof, to whom all Japanese arriving must report.\n\nIt may perhaps be worth mentioning that the Shirum-sha, a species of wild leek, reputed to be a certain cure for scurvy, is found all over Saghalien and is largely used by the Russians and natives all over the north. The Russian soldiers on the Amoor are very fond of it, and detachments are sent specially to procure supplies of it for winter use. The smell of it is much worse than garlic. I was told by an old Okhotsk whaling captain that he has often, after having lived weeks at sea on salt provisions, run for the island of Shantar, with himself and crew almost helpless from scurvy, and after using the Shirum-sha for a single week they invariably got perfectly well. He also told me that in the vicinity of the Shantar islands there is a rise and fall of 24 feet in the tides, with very strong tidal currents in Shantar Strait. It was on Shantar island that the unfortunate crew of the Nellie perished from scurvy, with plenty of wild berries and Shirum-sha within reach, had they known their use and value.\n\n* Bonasia betulena.\nCHUPISANI BAY\n\nIs a tolerably good anchorage about fourteen miles to the eastward of Cape Endouma, South Coast of Saghalien.\n\nIt is sheltered from west round by north to S.S.E. The water shoals gradually, and the lead is a safe guide in taking up a berth. Inside the four-fathom line the bottom is sand, and further to the eastward the sandy bottom extends for some distance off shore. To the westward of the Bay the shore and bottom are alike rocky.\n\nThere is a settlement of Russian peasants here, who seem well off and contented; they raise cattle principally. Fine salmon-trout, clams, eggs, and milk were procured from them. The place is sometimes used as a seaweed station, but none is being collected this year. Fresh water can be procured with some little trouble from a small stream which runs into the sea close to Pinnacle Point; also at another stream close to the village. There is an out-crop of coal close to the beach; the surface layers are little better than shale, but doubtless better coal would be found further in. The Russian peasants stated they made use of coal which burns well, from a seam three versts inland, which I was unable to visit. I saw large quantities of what appeared to be iron ore, but it did not feel very heavy when taken in the hand.\n\nThere are some curious Aino graves to the east of the village, with quaintly carved posts and the remains of small canoes near them. There are no Ainos here now. I believe these gentle, honest, but dirty savages to be quite untamable, and destined to disappear before the advance of the white man. In Yezo saki is doing the work for the Japanese. They cannot be got to take to agriculture. The Ainos on the West Coast of Saghalien are pretty well looked after and taken care of by the traders, as they are of great value to them; but sooner or later vodka will find its way among them, and then the end of this interesting race may be calculated; for drinking to the gods, i.e. getting dead drunk when opportunity offers, is part\nof their religion, if so it may be called. Beyond the graves the shore is bordered by low, swampy forest, extending a considerable distance to the eastward, behind which the N.E. ridge rises; and still further away are seen lofty peaks with patches of snow on them. To the west all is closed in by a range of mountains, with a high sharp peak to the north-west.\n\nThere is a slight rise and fall of tide here, not more than four feet, which seems greatly dependant on the winds; our stay was too short to ascertain exactly about the tides.\n\nFrom July 9th to 13th, when in Aniwa Bay, we had two days of light airs and calms. Highest reading of thermometer 69\u00b0 dry bulb; wet bulb 62\u00b0. Barometer 29\u00b7896 and steady. The rest of the time the wind was from E. and S.E., greatest force 4. Highest reading of thermometer 65\u00b0 dry, 59\u00b0 wet. Lowest reading 48\u00b0 dry, 47\u00b0 wet, at 4 a.m. The sea water was about 57\u00b0 average. I have observed that on the coast of Saghalien in the early part of the season, say from April to June, the winds are generally from the south-eastward, with more or less fog; the nearer east the wind the denser the fog; but there is generally a belt of two to three miles off the west coast which is clear of fog. If the barometer falls suddenly with a S.E. wind, the wind will freshen and blow hard for a few hours, and then fall light, probably finishing at N.W., when there will be a day or two clear weather.\n\nIn July, northerly and N.E. winds prevail in the Gulf of Tartary. On the Saghalien coast the wind generally comes off the land at night. In August the fogs clear away. Storms of a revolving character are experienced as far north as the Amoor. On the 19th of last August it blew with hurricane force at the mouth of the river, the wind beginning at south and finishing at N.W., with the low rapid scud so well known. From 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. the gale was at its height, the barometer falling all the time. After 10 p.m. the barometer began to rise, and the weather rapidly improved. August however is about the finest month for weather in the year. In Sep-\ntember the weather breaks up, and heavy gales may be expected from anywhere between N.E. and west. Easterly winds bring snow and rain. Vessels have no business to be on the west coast of Saghalien between the 15th and 26th of September, as the weather is very uncertain just before and after the equinox. October is considered a fine month, but liable to N.W. gales, which however generally give good warning. With the close of October winter fairly sets in.\n\nHEIGHTS OF MOUNTAINS ON SAGHALIEN COAST.\n\n(By TRIANGULATION.)\n\nWestern Peak of Kaitsiska Range.

TODA.\n\nPART I.\n\nI.\n\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\n\nSince the year 1858 the Kingdom of Annam has ceased to be an unknown country, for Missionaries now travel freely in every direction, and the ports of Haiphong, Hanoi, and Quinhon are open to foreign trade. Bold explorers, either in the interest of science or gain, have gone through the country to China, to Siam, or to Burmah, following the course of the rivers or the mountain paths, sometimes peaceably, at other times armed as conquerors and fighting their way through the land. Finally, the occupation of Lower Cochinchina by the French has done more than anything else to throw light upon this country, which, if it does not occupy so important a position historically amongst Orientals as China and Japan, yet from its favourable geographical situation and from the interest Europe takes in the surrounding countries, will be obliged sooner or later to enter the comity of nations, and change the condition of its people, at present probably the most miserable in the world.\n\nAnnam became known to the civilized world through the Catholic Missionaries who went there during the sixteenth\n\n* Read before the Society on the 15th December, 1881.\ncentury, though their works on the subject did not have a large circulation; some never having been even published, and all being very scarce at the present time. Father Marini wrote at the end of the seventeenth century a relation of Tunquin, and the Jesuit priest Alexander of Rhodes also published a history of that country. In the Lettres \u00e9difiantes et curieuses \u00e9crites des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res there will be found many references by Father Gaubil and others to the history of Annam, and with reference to the religious aspect of the kingdom also in the Chronicles published during the last century by the Dominican and Augustinian Fathers of the Philippines. John Barrow, a well-known traveller, has likewise published a narrative of a voyage to Cochinchina made in 1793.\n\nBooks relating to Annam have considerably increased in number during the last thirty years; most of these have been issued in Saigon and in France, and treat of the Annamese, their history, laws, customs, etc. It is to be regretted, however, that in these works the Chinese characters have not been used for the names of people and places; and this has caused more or less confusion in their identification. In their attempts to avoid this inconvenience, the French and Spanish Missionaries have introduced a system by which Roman letters with various dots and signs are made to represent Annamese words phonetically; but this is useful only to Annamese who wish to write their own language in Roman characters. In these pages an endeavour has been made to give the Chinese characters for all names which it has been possible to identify.\n\nThe literature of Annam is very poor. Except the Annals, written by order of the King Thanh-tong in 1477 by Ngo-si-lien, and continued at later periods, and other compilations of laws, such as the Hoang-viet-luat-le published with an introduction by the King Gia-long in the 11th year of his reign, all the books found in the country are of Chinese origin, the literature taught in the schools being\nalso Chinese. Nothing else could be expected from a country which has no real civilization of its own, but is only a reflex of China in everything relating to art, religion and government.\n\nIn China numerous works on Annam are to be found, but few of them can be looked upon as trustworthy. For instance the Chinese do not reckon as proper kings of Annam those who did not receive their investiture from the Emperor. Again, a deplorable confusion exists as regards names and dates. Finally, from the fact that the relations of China and Annam have frequently been of a hostile nature, and that many or all the works on Annam were written by Chinese officials employed to fight against that country, it is easy to see how their narratives would be of a very partial character and many facts grossly misrepresented.\n\nThe study of the numismatics of this country is completely new to Europeans. Several Chinese who have written on coins have published in their Catalogues lists of Annamese coins, and half of the 17th volume of the \u53e4\u4eca\u92ad\u7565 Ku-kin-ts'ien-lieh deals entirely with them. However, all the coins alluded to form but an incomplete list of those issued by the last \u9ece Le Dynasty, and the notices of them are certainly neither better nor worse than those in other Chinese books. As there exists thus no trustworthy basis on which to found this notice, it must not be expected that the work will either be complete or correct; but the greatest possible care has been used in the endeavour to make it so. Much information has been obtained from Father Miguel Portell, now in Tunquin, and from the distinguished Annamese savant Petrus Truong-vinh-ky, whose aid is indispensable to all Europeans who require any information concerning Annam. From his work, Cours d'histoire annamite, the historical notices which precede the description of the coins themselves have been partially taken.\n\nIn order to tone down the dryness of a long numismatical list, we insert some general introductory remarks explanatory\nof the periods when coins were made, the laws relating to them, the working of mines, the issue of paper-money, etc., which referring to a country so little known as Annam, will probably not be without interest.\n\nII.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTICES.\n\nThe situation of the Annamese Kingdom on the southeast of the great Indo-malayan peninsula is well known. This state consists at the present day of the two Kingdoms of Tunquin and Cochinchina, of the Kingdom of \u5360\u57ce Chiem-thanh or Ciampa, and of a part of the Kingdom of Khmer or Cambodia. Ciampa, a Malayan state, and during six centuries the abode of thieves and pirates, was conquered in 1471 by the Annamese army. The Kingdom of Khmer also lost vast territories successively up to the last century and was only able to keep its national independence by the \u897f\u5c71 Tay-son rebellion which upset the feudal constitution of the country. Annam herself was divided between the families \u9ea5 Mac, \u912d Trinh, and \u962e Nguyen, who, having entirely put aside the royal authority, contested among themselves the supreme power over the kingdom. The French colony of Lower Cochinchina is situated within the territories of the kingdom of Khmer annexed by Annam in 1758.\n\nMr. Chaigneau, one of the French officers who in the last century accompanied the Bishop of Adran during his first expedition in aid of Gia-long, estimated the population of Annam at between 20 and 25 millions of souls. These figures are evidently exaggerated, at least so far as can be judged at present, as certainly the present population does not exceed 12 millions.\n\nThe division of the two Kingdoms of Tunquin and Cochinchina is still existing as a matter of fact. The former, which is also the richer and more populated, consists of the following thirteen provinces:\u2014\nANNAM AND ITS MINOR CURRENCY.\n\nLang-son.  Hai-duong.\nCao-bang.  Bac-ninh.\nThai-nguyen.  Ha-noi.\nTuyen-quang.  Hung-yen.\nSon-tay.  Nam-dinh.\nHung-hoa.  Ninh-binh.\nQuang-yen.\n\nCochinchina has twelve provinces, namely:\n\nThanh-hoa.  Quang-nam.\nNghe-an.  Quang-ngoai.\nHa-ninh.  Binh-dinh.\nQuang-binh.  Phu-yen.\nQuang-tri.  Khanh-hoa.\nQuang-duc.  Binh-thuan.\n\nThese geographical divisions were made during the recent reign of the King Minh-mang, and the three provinces of Thanh-hoa, Nghe-an, and Ha-ninh, formerly part of Tunquin, were added to Cochinchina. Previously the above two kingdoms were separated by a wall which ran along the shores of the Phu-luong-giang, called in vulgar Annamese and on our maps the Song-coi river. The provinces do not range all alike, for as far as population and wealth are concerned each of them is under a different authority; in general, however, the public administration in Annam is very similar to that in China.\n\nOriginally the territories which formed the Kingdom of Annam were called Giao-chi, which name together with that of Giao-nam prevailed till 225 B.C., when they became a Chinese province under the appellation of Siang-kiun.\n\nWhen the Han came into power in China, Tunquin was called Nam-viet, and its interior division underwent various changes at different intervals. In 502 A.D. we see the country for the first time called Annam, which name lasted up to 940 A.D., when it was declared independent. During the succeeding dynasties up to the present time the names used for the designation of the state and the different capitals of the kingdom have been as follows:\u2014\n| Dynasty | Name of the King | A.D. | Name of the Kingdom | Name of the Capital | Remarks |\n|---------|-----------------|------|---------------------|--------------------|---------|\n| Dinh    | \u5148\u7687 Tien-hoang. | 968  | \u5927\u8d8a Dai-viet.      | \u5927\u90fd Dai-la.       |         |\n| Ly      | \u592a\u7956 Thai-to.    | 1010 | \u53d8\u8dbe Giao-chi.      | do.                |         |\n| do.     | \u8056\u5b97 Thanh-tong. | 1055 | \u5927\u8d8a Dai-viet.      | do.                |         |\n| do.     | \u9ad8\u5b97 Cao-tong    | 1176 | \u5b89\u5357 Annam.         | do.                |         |\n| Tran    | \u5c11\u5e1d Thien-de.   | 1399 |                    | \u897f\u90fd Tay-do.        |         |\n| do.     | \u592a\u7956 Thai-to.    | 1424 |                    | \u6771\u4eac Dong-kinh.     |         |\n| Le      | \u838a\u5b97 Trang-tong. | 1545 |                    | \u7d39\u83ef Thien-hoa.     |         |\n| do.     | \u4e16\u5b97 The-tong.   | 1598 |                    | \u6771\u4eac Dong-kinh.     |         |\n| Nguyen  | \u5609\u9686 Gia-long.    | 1803 | \u8d8a\u5357 Vietnam.       | \u8d8a\u5357 Dainam.       |         |\n| do.     | \u8083\u5fb7 Tu-diep.    | 1862 |                    | Hu\u00e9.               |         |\n\nNow \u6cb3\u5167 Hanoi called also \u6607\u9686 Thang-long.\n\nHu\u00e9, called also \u5ee3\u5316\u5e9c Thuan-hoa-fu, and \u627f\u5929\u5e9c Chau-thien-phu.\n\nHanoi called before \u6771\u90fd Dong-do.\n\nProvince of \u6e05\u83ef Thanh-hoa.\nThe mythical history of Annam, although derived from China, is much less complicated than that of the latter country. \u5e1d\u660e De-minh, the great-grandson of the Chinese Emperor \u795e\u8fb2 Shen-nung, while travelling in the South of China married a daughter of the race of immortals, by whom he had a son called \u6df5\u967d\u738b Kinh-duong-vuong. This son began the series of kings known as the \u9d3b\u9e97\u6c0f Hong-ban-thi, or family of immeasurable greatness. This family gave birth to twenty rulers, eighteen of whom had the same name, viz., \u96c4\u738b Hung-vuong, and continued on the throne up to 252 B.C.\n\nLet us leave aside here any description of the history of Annam during this remote period. Doubtless it was formed by Chinese and Malayan colonists who settled there and mixed among themselves, a fact paralleled by the present race of the Sang-ley, or half-casts of Chinese and Tagals now populating the Philippine islands. Each colony was under a chief and lived as in China, by agriculture and fishing.\n\nThe first dynasty mentioned in the Annamese annals is that of \u8d8a Thuc, the rulers of a small kingdom situated in the north-east of Annam, where afterwards its capital city \u9ad8\u5e73 Kao-bang was built. This kingdom, founded 252 B.C., lasted only 50 years, when internal contests between the different tribes broke out, victory and supremacy continually changing between them, until the Chinese interfered, and at last occupied the country, remaining in possession till 940 A.D.\n\nAbout the year 600 A.D. China organised Annam in a regular manner by dividing the country into 13 chou, at the head of each one of which a governor was placed. A regular tribute was also instituted for the first time, gold and silver appearing at the head of articles to be offered.\n\nIn 940 A.D. Annam rose in rebellion against China, and the family \u5433 Ngo occupied the throne during 28 years. How Annam since that time has been able to maintain her independence is a mystery. The first three dynasties followed\neach other with marvellous rapidity; the kings fell under the strokes of assassins or by military conspiracy, and rebellions prevailed in all the provinces; later on the feudal chiefs became so powerful that the kings could not even maintain the shade of their sovereignty. Up till lately, to the time of Tu-duc, Annam sustained its existence solely by its passive policy, which is the only strength of Oriental countries.\n\nBefore entering on the description of the coins a historical account of the epoch during which they were cast will first be given. This is done for the special purpose of clearing up the dark period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, during which Annam was ruled simultaneously by three or even four rulers.\n\nIII.\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLES OF THE ANNAMESE DYNASTIES.\n\nThe Annamese have a chronological system identical with that of the Chinese, and they use the same characters of cycles and years as the Chinese. The twenty two cyclical characters which occur sometimes on Annamese coins, are herewith given:\n\n\u7532 Giap. \u5b50 Ti.\n\u4e59 At. \u4e11 Suu.\n\u4e19 Binh. \u5bc5 Dan.\n\u4e01 Dinh. \u536f Meo.\n\u620a Mau. \u8fb0 Thinh.\n\u5df1 Ky. \u5df3 Ti.\n\u5e9a Canh. \u5348 Ngo.\n\u8f9b Tan. \u672a Mui.\n\u58ec Nham. \u7533 Than.\n\u7678 Qui. \u9149 Dau.\n\u4ea5 Hoi.\n\nThe present year in Annam, as in China, is \u58ec\u5348 Nham-ngo. The kings of Annam have a Nien-hao which is changed\naccording to their pleasure. These designations of reign are, of course, also changed after the death of their bearer, with the Miao-hao. I subjoin a list of both designations and the time corresponding to the reign of each king.\n\n**Chronological Tables of the Annamese Dynasties.**\n\n**\u9d3b\u9f90\u6c0f Hong-ban-thi.**\n\n| Accession. |\n|------------|\n| B.C.       |\n\n- \u6deb\u967d\u738b Kinh-duong-vuong.\n- \u99f1\u9f8d\u541b Lac-long-quan.\n- \u96c4\u738b Hung-vuong.\n\nReigned during 2622 years. 2874\n\n**\u8700\u6c0f\u2014Thuc-thi.**\n\nThe Thuc Family.\n\n\u5b89\u967d\u738b An-duong-vuong. 252\n\n**\u8d99\u6c0f\u2014 Trieu-thi.**\n\nThe Trieu Family.\n\n\u6b66\u5e1d Vo-de. 202\n\u6587\u738b Van-vuong. 190\n\u660e\u738b Minh-vuong. 178\n\u54c0\u738b Ai-vuong. 177\n\u885b\u967d\u738b Thuat-duong-vuong. 176\n\n**\u5c6c\u897f\u6f22\u2014Thuoc-tay-han.**\n\nChinese rule in Annam from B.C. 106 to A.D. 39.\n\n**\u5fb5\u5973\u6c0f\u2014Trung-mi-thi.**\n\nThe Trung Family.\n\n\u5fb5\u5074 Trung-trac.

always been tributary to China, and, from the time of its becoming a self-governed state, has occasionally sent presents and tribute to the Son of Heaven. Whenever she has not done so, a war with China has been the inevitable result. China, on her side, has attached great\nimportance to this tribute, and has fixed not only the dates on which it was to be paid, but also the nature of the presents to be made to her by Annam.\n\nIn 1252, China being under Mongol rule, Annam had to pay tribute every three years. Under the Ming Dynasty the regulations for payment of tribute by Annam were altered, and those now in force are to be found in Mr. Dev\u00e9ria's work *Histoire des Relations de la Chine avec l'Annam-Vietnam, du XVIe au XIXe si\u00e8cle*. (Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1880.)\n\nThat Annam is a country under the sovereignty of China, is still more clear by the fact, that, on an Annamese king coming to the throne, he has to ask for investiture at the hands of the Emperor, in the same way as in the Middle Ages monarchs of Catholic countries had to obtain this confirmation of power from the Pope. Moreover, although in his relations with his subjects and in treaties with western powers the King of Annam is designated \u5927\u7687\u5e1d Dai-hoang-de, or Supreme Emperor, the characters \u56fd\u9577 Kuo-tchang, or Chief of a Kingdom, are applied to him in China when soliciting investiture; and he is afterwards simply called \u738b Wang, meaning King or Prince. In addressing the Emperor, the King of Annam makes use of the form \u8868 Piao, i.e. statement presented to the Emperor; and in replying to him the form \u52c5\u66f8 Tche-chu, or letter sent by special command of the Emperor, is used.\n\nWhen in 1790 the \u897f\u5c71 Tay-son rebel \u962e\u60e0 Nguyen-Hue, already invested as king of Annam by \u4e7e\u9686 K'ien-lung, came to China to salute the Emperor on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of his reign, he took part in the ceremonies of the palace in company with the Tartar Princes of the first and second rank, performing with them the various court rites, such as kneeling three times and bowing nine times before His Imperial Majesty.\n\nThis state of affairs would seem to have been changed by the treaty signed at Saigon on the 15th March 1874\nbetween the French Rear-Admiral Dupr\u00e9, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Lower Cochinchina, and the Annamese Ambassadors \u9ece\u9806 Le-thuan and \u962e\u842c Nguyen-van. Article II. of that treaty states that the President of the French Republic, recognising the sovereignty of the King of Annam and his entire independence of all foreign powers whatsoever, promises him aid and assistance, and engages to give him, on his demand and gratuitously, the necessary means for maintaining order and tranquility in his state, to defend it against all attacks, and to destroy the piracy which desolates a portion of the coasts of the kingdom. In recognition (Art. III.) of this protection, His Majesty the King of Annam engages to conform his foreign policy to that of France, and in no way to change his present diplomatic relations.\n\nThe independence of Annam cannot be stated in more explicit terms than those given above; nevertheless, three years later, in 1877, King \u8ad6\u5fb7 Tu-duc suddenly recalled to his mind that he was still a vassal of China and sent an embassy to Peking bearing tribute. The Peking Gazette of the 31st March 1878 publishes a Memorial from \u6d82\u5b97\u701b Tu Tsung-ying, Governor of Kuang-si, reporting the arrival of this mission on its way back to Annam. The report says that the members expressed themselves profoundly grateful for the generous and liberal treatment they had received from the hands of His Majesty the Emperor, who, they informed the memorialist, had been graciously pleased to grant them an audience, and bestow upon them some complimentary scrolls. His Majesty had also given them an Imperial Letter for the King of Annam, with presents of silks, satins and other articles. After resting a few days at the provincial capital, they were sent on under escort to their own country.\n\nThis political constitution of a double character, which in European states would lead to endless warfare, does not seem to affect to any great extent the authority of eastern monarchs. In Annam, for instance, the king yields to outside\npressure only when obliged to do so by force of arms; within his own territories his rule is absolute and despotic; he neither takes into consideration his state of vassalage to the Emperor of China, nor does he hold himself bound by treaties signed by him with other Powers.\n\nV.\n\nMINES.\n\nTo get nearer the subject of this work, i.e. the currency of Annam, we must first throw a glance at the mines and the mining industry of the country.\n\nAnnam is very rich in mines, though poor in metals, on account of the Government making the working of the mines a monopoly, or rendering it unprofitable to work them by the imposition of restrictions and by oppressive measures of every kind.\n\nNearly all the mines are situated in the mountainous districts of the kingdom, namely, in High Tunquin, with the exception of one gold mine in the province of \u5317\u5be7 Bac-ninh. Metals of every kind are abundant, as proved by the following official list of mines paying royalties to the Government; and yte this list does not comprise the names of all mines worked at the present day.\n\nGOLD MINES.\n\nProvince of \u5317\u5be7 Bac-ninh.\n\n1.\u2014\u7164\u8c50\u6046 Moi-phaong-hang.

Makes an annual payment of six hundred pounds of tin.\n\nThe working of mines in Annam was first begun when the country was still a part of the Chinese Empire, and before the coming into power of the \u5434 Ngo Dynasty, but it has been impossible to obtain any reliable information relating to this period.\n\nIn the Annals of Annam it is mentioned that in King \u5927\u884c Dai-hanh's palace the throne room, called \u767e\u5b9d\u5343\u94b1\u6bbf, was fitted up with gold and silver; and that the roof of a pavilion called \u94f6\u955c\u6bbf was composed of silver tiles. In 1010 King \u592a\u7956 Thai-to of the \u674e Ly Dynasty, when going to a place called Co-phap, made presents of silk and silver to the aged people of the villages. In the accounts of the accession of some of the later kings we read of similar presents of precious metals being made to the people.\n\nThe various savage tribes inhabiting the mountains of the Tunquin frontier and the range of hills lying parallel with the Eastern coast have been from a very early period in the habit of working the mines and bringing down the metals in their rough state, in exchange for different articles. This is still done by the Moi, the Muong, and other tribes who thus bring to the Annamese markets considerable quantities of gold, silver, iron, and lead.\n\nAt the time of the occupation of Annam by the Chinese under the \u660e Ming Dynasty, in 1414, the Annamese were forced to work the gold and silver mines, without pay, and the metals extracted were sent to China as compensation for the\nwar expenses. Later on, King \u592a\u7956 THAI-TO of the \u9686 Le Dynasty gave a great impulse to the extraction of large quantities of metals, the work being carried on under Government supervision and on its account. The first king who allowed mines to be worked by private individuals was \u88d5\u5b97 DU-TONG. In 1708 he established a scale of royalties to be paid by each mine, and this scale or tariff exists to the present day in the form given above, with but little variations.\n\nThe Chinese were the only people who availed themselves of this permission, and King DU-TONG, in order to avoid too great a concourse of miners and the troubles that might thereby ensue, gave orders that the number of Chinese working in each mine should be limited to three hundred, and that they should be under the supervision of Government officials, who were entrusted also with the collection of all dues.\n\nIn 1729, King \u6c38\u6176\u5e1d VINH-KHANH-DE issued a curious decree ordering the closing of all mines in the royal province of \u6e05\u83ef Thanh-hoa, the reason for this being that he did not wish to disturb the \"veins of the earth that had produced the royal race of the Le Dynasty.\"\n\nSince that time the mines in Annam have been worked solely by Chinese, who have no doubt made very considerable profits therefrom, inasmuch as, quite recently, the Mandarins of Tunquin complained to the king that the country was being ruined by the exportation to China of all the gold and silver obtained from the mines. It is hard to convince eastern nations that the exportation of precious metals from a country does not affect its resources in any way.\n\nTo open up a new mine in Annam it is necessary to obtain the sanction of the Government; and any one venturing to do so without this permission is punished with death by decapitation.\n\nUnder the Penal Code thefts in the mines are also punished very severely. This Code says that any one working in gold,\nsilver, copper, tin or mercury mines and appropriating any of the mineral, shall be punished as having stolen money; he who offers resistance to those coming to arrest him shall be deported, and should he wound or kill any officer arresting him, he shall be decapitated. The crime of stealing minerals is still more severely dealt with if committed by a company of thirty or more people.\n\nThe Code also punishes overseers of mines allowing fraudulent extraction of metals.\n\nVI.\n\nManufacture of Coins.\n\nNearly every kind of metal has been used in Annam in the manufacture of coins, and there are now in circulation coins made of gold, silver, copper, zinc, and lead; and up to within a short time ago there were also coins made of iron.\n\nGold and silver coins were not made except under the last dynasty, and in a very limited number; but the kings of the present dynasty have given a greater impulse to their mintage. According to the laws for casting coins in those metals, those used for paying Mandarins are to be round, and in lingots for payment to the troops in time of war. There exists also a large number of gold and silver medals with inscriptions and allegories relating to the \u4e94\u5b9d Ngu-bao or Five Precious Things; and these are distributed by the king in return for services to the state. These medals, however, pass into circulation and are taken as currency according to weight. The classification of these gold and silver coins and medals would take up too much space in the present work and we therefore leave it for future consideration.\n\nThe minor currency of Annam is identical with that of China; in fact nearly all the coins which were in circulation\nup to the 15th century were actually cast in the provinces of Kuang-tung, Kuang-si, and Fu-kien, and brought direct to Annam in Chinese junks. The coins thus imported were smaller than the ordinary Chinese cash; they bore the Nien-hao or name of reign of various Emperors of the Sung Dynasty of China, and are still to be found in large numbers. In Annam coins were cast only under a few of the kings of the dynasties Dinh, former Le, Ly, and Tran, who reigned before that period. The description of these coins will be found further on.\n\nIn early days, the casting of cash was the prerogative of the king, according to rules contained in the Uniform Laws for the Nine Phu. The text is rather obscure, but we gather from it that the cash were either cast at nine mints or stored in nine magazines in order to prevent an excessive circulation, in the following nine places: Thai-phu, Vuong-phu, Noi-phu, Ngoai-phu, Tuyen-phu, Thien-phu, Chuc-noi, Chuc-kim, and Chuc-te.\n\nIn the time of King Hien-tong of the Le Dynasty (1740-1786) mints were established in the capitals of some provinces, and it was ordered that on the reverse of the coins the name of the place whence they came should be indicated. At the present day two mints exist in Annam, where cash are cast for the use of the Government: one in Hue, the ancient capital of Cochinchina and now the capital of the whole kingdom; and the other in Hanoi, the ancient capital of Tunquin. Besides these, private speculators are allowed to cast cash with the permission of the Government who send deputies to inquire into the number of furnaces used and the monthly quantity of cash made, on which a contribution is levied. This contribution is usually paid twice over by the manufacturers on account of the exactions of the Mandarins.\n\nCoins are also cast in Macao for circulation in Annam; and from a very recent report addressed by the Governor of that\nColony to the Portuguese Government it would appear that there exist at the present moment six manufactories of Annamese coins, employing twelve furnaces and three hundred and twenty workmen, and producing daily 700,000 cash.\n\nIn 1528 iron coins began to come into circulation in Annam. The Annals state that, when the usurper Mac Dang-Dung proclaimed himself king under the name of Minh-Duc, he wished to have coins cast, and having no copper made use of iron. This is the only occasion on which we see iron employed in the casting of Annamese coins.\n\nZinc coins appeared for the first time during the reign of the King Hien-Tong (1740.) They were also made by Nguyen-Nhac, chief of the Tay-son rebels, who was proclaimed king in 1764. This example was followed by the King Gia-Long in consequence of the great scarcity of copper in the kingdom. This king was the first who had coins made out of lead. The reasons which led to the use of these different metals, as well as the different amalgams of copper, tin, lead, and zinc, will be explained afterwards.\n\nVarious laws were passed at different times with reference to the circulation of the currency. In 1230 the King Thai-Tong of the Tran Dynasty regulated the value of the cash, ordering that each string or tien which the peasants had to pay to the Treasury should contain seventy cash, and only sixty those which dwellers in the cities paid in. The founder of the Le Dynasty reduced the tien to fifty cash; but its value was very soon raised by his successor, who in 1435 ordered all collectors of taxes to accept the old copper cash so far as it could be put in strings, and increased the tien to sixty cash. At the present day the tien is still composed of sixty zinc cash; and ten tiens make one quan-tien.\n\nWe have searched in vain for any law relating to the different standards of copper, zinc and lead coins. Their value depends altogether on the market, which in the ports open to\nforeign trade is regulated by the price of the Mexican Dollar. At present, one copper cash or \u9322 Dong is equal to ten zinc cash; and one quan-tien (600 zinc cash) is worth a little more than fifteen cents of a dollar. A box large enough to hold four hundred strings of zinc cash, equal to sixty Mexican Dollars, would have to be three cubic feet in size! The value of lead coins is still smaller than those of zinc, but they are fortunately very little used.\n\nIn payments to the Government six hundred and four zinc cash are counted to the tien, the four extra cash being required in compensation for the expense of transport of this cumbersome coinage.\n\nVII.\n\nFalse Coinage, and Penal Laws relating thereto.\n\nWhen speaking of false coinage we do not refer to coins issued by the rebels, who continually devastated the provinces, as these coins circulated in small quantities along with those issued by Royal authority. Many of the coins made by rebels were of so fragile a nature, that in the course of time they have entirely disappeared.\n\nIt seems rather improbable that, considering the very small value of Annamese cash, any one should be able to forge them and still make a profit on the operation. But, as in other parts of the world, makers of base coin prospered like some other flourishing industries in Annam, the manufacture being in the hands of Chinese.\n\nBook 3rd, Part 6th, Section 5th of the \u7687\u8d8a\u5f8b\u4f8b Hoang-viet-luat-le, or Penal Code of the Annamese Kingdom, prescribes the penalties to be inflicted upon persons forging the coins of the realm. Any one concerned in the making of false coins is liable to the punishment of death by strangulation. Those who knowingly buy false coins are\nliable to perpetual banishment to a distance of three thousand li from their residence, and to one hundred blows. The informer receives a reward of fifty taels of silver. A mandarin who permits the manufacture of false coins is liable to a penalty of one hundred blows. Any one reducing the size of the current cash for the sake of the metal, receives one hundred blows. Those who attempt to make foreign gold or silver coins out of copper, lead, or quicksilver are punished by being kept three years in irons and receiving one hundred blows; and any person dealing in such coins is liable to a punishment of two years and a half in irons and ninety blows.\n\nBesides these laws, there are two supplementary statutes, which lay down the penalties for new forms of forgery. By the first statute the punishment of three years in irons and one hundred blows is prescribed for the following offences: (1) making holes in silver coins and filling up with copper or lead; (2) making shoes of sycee of which the interior consists of copper or lead; (3) employing copper or lead mixed with silver in the proportion of not more than two, three, four or five tenths of silver in the whole coin.\n\nThe second statute imposes the same punishment upon those who make coins with the name and title of deceased kings.\n\nNotwithstanding these severe penalties, false coinage is practised on a very large scale, not only in Annam, but also in China and Hongkong. Not long ago a considerable quantity of false cash was discovered in the colony of Hongkong, the makers of which were brought before the Courts. They were allowed to go free on their shewing that the cash were intended for Annam; and it was fortunate for the credit of the Annamese officials that the investigations were not pushed any further, as the very cash in question were taken to Annam by the \"Bouranne,\" one of King \u9806\u5fb7 Tu-duc's gunboats then in Hongkong for the purpose of being repaired.\nVIII.\n\nMagazines for Coins, and Laws Referring to Them.\n\nThere are two kinds of magazines for coins belonging to the Government: one the regular Treasury, and the other where superabundant coins are kept.\n\nIn the Treasury is received the produce of the taxes, which are collected by the Huong-than, or chief of each Municipality, assisted by two elders called Quan-vien. When the taxes are all paid, the amount is taken to the provincial Treasury, and there the coins and ingots of silver are tested by the chief of the guild of goldsmiths, who answers by all he is worth for the accuracy of his judgment. In the case of zinc coins, as it is quite impossible to be deceived in the material, it is only necessary to arrange them in parcels consisting of strings of 604 cash.\n\nEach provincial Treasury is under the charge of a minor official called Chu-thu-thuong-vieu, or \"Superintendent of the Magazine,\" assisted by one Doi, or Captain of the military guard, who also controls the receipts and expenditure of the coins.\n\nThe Treasurer sends each month his balance to the Minister of Finances, and his accounts are also examined at stated times by Inspectors sent from the court of Hu\u00e9.\n\nRobberies from these magazines are by the Annamese Code subject to the following scale of punishments:\n\nFor the theft of 1 tael ...... 80 Blows.\ndo. 2\u00bd taels ...... 90 do.\ndo. 5 \" ...... 100 do.\ndo. 7\u00bd \" ...... 60 do. and 1 year in irons.\ndo. 10 \" ...... 70 do. and 1\u00bd years do.\ndo. 12 \" ...... 80 do. and 2 do.\ndo. 15 \" ...... 90 do. and 2\u00bd do.\ndo. 17\u00bd \" ...... 100 do. and 3 do.\nFor the theft of 20 taels ......100 Blows and banishment to 2000 le.\ndo. 25 ,, ......100 do. and banishment to 2500 le.\ndo. 30 ,, ......100 do. and banishment to 3000 le.\ndo. 40 ,, ......Decapitation.\n\nThe above scale is applicable to robberies committed by any of the employ\u00e9s of the Magazine. For common thefts the penalty is not so severe, as only a robbery of 80 taels or more is punished with death by strangulation.\n\nThere are also storhouses where small coins are kept when there is a great abundance in the market. Such storehouses also exist in China, and have been of great utility in times of public calamities. In the Annamese Annuals mention is frequently made of the opening of such storhouses, either for assistance to the poor, or for rewards to the people. The first notice of such an occurrence dates as far back as the year 1028, when the King \u592a\u5b97 THAI-TONG of the \u674e Ly Dynasty, on coming to the throne, ordered a distribution amongst the people of the coins in those magazines. In the fourth moon of the year 1074, in consequence of a great drought which destroyed the crops, the granaries, as well as these storhouses were opened for the succour of the needy.\n\nOther distributions were made at later periods, one being recorded in the 6th moon of the year 1448, when there was a great famine in the provinces of Tuyen-quang, Qui-hon, Giao-hung and Da-giang. The last of those donations was made by King \u5609\u9686 GIA-LONG, in 1801, after the pacification of the country, when he had destroyed the \u897f\u5c71 Tay-son rebels. On that occasion he remitted to the people one year's taxes, distributing to his troops one thousand taels of gold, ten thousand taels of silver, and thirty thousand strings of cash. To the auxiliary army of Cambodia he also gave thirty taels of gold, three hundred of silver, and three thousand strings.\nIX.\n\nCustoms and superstitions connected with coins.\n\nThe Annamese have the same ideas as the Chinese concerning the efficacy of hanging coins round the necks of children, or over the beds of sick people, &c.; but no further explanation is required here, the fact being well known to those at all acquainted with the numismatics of these countries.\n\nWhen dealing with the different kinds of metal employed in the manufacture of cash, it was mentioned that the Annamese Government had several reasons for employing the most fragile materials. An explanation of this is given in an excellent work published in Manila in 1858 by the Dominican Missionary Manuel de Rivas, entitled Idea del Imperio de Anam. The following extract from page 103 of that book is here translated:\n\n\"It is a common belief on that in the Annamese Kingdom gold and silver exist in great abundance, hidden in the bowels of the earth; and for that reason, when the rice harvest is good, and there is an influx of money into the country, it at once disappears without any one knowing where it has gone; because what is imported is of little value, whilst the quantity exported is much larger. In the period of 1844-1846 it entered into my mind to take an account of the number of Chinese junks which went to Tunquin to load clean rice; and in the port of Hoa-phaong (Haiphong) alone I saw more than three hundred. Calculating that each junk carried away on an average five hundred quintals each, this would represent a total of $60,000 received at one port alone. At that time there was a large circulation of silver at that port, one bar of the nominal value of fifteen dollars being then only equal to forty-five strings of cash. In the other ports of the middle provinces, and in Hanoi, the exportation of grain was still\nlarger, and so was the silver brought into the country; but three months later the silver had all disappeared, and a similar bar cost from seventy-five to eighty strings of cash, by which fluctuation many people made considerable profits. In olden times the currency of Tunquin and Cochinchina consisted of circular coins with a square hole in the middle, called Dong-thien, which were much smaller than the Chinese cash. Without being exported, these coins disappeared entirely from circulation a few months after they had been issued by the mints in large quantities. The Government then ascertained that the people were in the habit of burying all cash that came into their possession, in consequence of which the laws relating to the currency were altered; and the coins, which were previously of copper, were afterwards made from zinc mixed with lead and tin. As this material was of so much more fragile a nature and decomposed rapidly, if buried, the abuses resulting from the old custom were stopped and also the calamities arising from a deficient circulation.\"\n\nThe custom of burying treasure was not new in Annam, and is explained by the want of security existing at all times. In the fourteenth century this custom was accompanied by a very barbarous one, which was the invention of the \"Spirit protectors of treasures.\" It is said that TRAU-CANH, a famous doctor of the Palace, having accumulated immense wealth and wishing to secure it, buried it in a deep cave under the guard of the Spirits. To that end, he buried near the treasure a young virgin, with a root of ginseng in her mouth to preserve her from hunger and thirst, and lighted the cave with a large jar full of oil.\n\nThe Chinese who accumulated money in Annam and could not take it to their own country, also buried it in secret places, putting it under the guard of the innocent victims converted by superstition into Spirit protectors. This custom was a universal one, all classes of society following it, as King PHE-DE of the TRAN Dynasty, wishing to\npreserve his riches from the hordes of Ciampa who had invaded the kingdom, ordered them to be buried in a cave in the Thien-kien mountain, where the people say they still remain, the secret of the position of the cave having been lost.\n\nX.\n\nPAPER-MONEY IN ANNAM.\n\nShortly after the introduction into China by the Mongols of paper-money, it also circulated in Annam. In 1397 General \u80e1\u69ae\u5b63 Ho Qui-Ly, the real ruler of Annam under King \u5c11\u5e1d Thieu-De, prohibited the circulation of copper coins and ordered that paper-money only, called \u901a\u5bf6\u6703\u9214 Thong-bao-hoi-sau, should be used. This paper-money had a design, peculiar to each different class, indicating its exchange value for the copper coins which it had just supplanted.\n\nThe paper-money of the value of 10 cash was marked with the design of grass.\n\nThat of 30 cash with waves.\n\u201e 60 \u201e \u201e clouds.\n\u201e 120 \u201e \u201e turtle.\n\u201e 180 \u201e \u201e unicorn.\n\u201e 300 \u201e \u201e ph\u0153nix.\n\u201e 600 \u201e \u201e dragon.\n\nThe Government made great efforts to ensure the circulation of this paper-money, and impose it on the people. To that end it was ordered that all copper coins in circulation should be taken to the Treasuries, where the value of one string and two tien of paper-money was given for one string of cash. The forgery of paper-money was punished with death by decapitation, and there were also severe penalties imposed on those who had copper coins in their possession.\nBut in spite of those orders and restrictions, paper-money soon fell into discredit and the old copper coins circulated freely. In fact the very General Ho Qui-ly ordered copper cash to be cast when he rebelled and usurped the Royal authority.\n\nPART II.\n\nHistory of the Coinage.\n\nXI.\n\nThe \u8d8a Ngo Family. The twelve \u4f7f\u541b Su-quan. The \u5357 Dinh Dynasty. The former \u9ece Le Dynasty.\u2014940-1010 A.D.\n\nThe \u8d8a Ngo Family.\u2014940-948.\n\nNgo-guyen, an Annamese of the state of Ai-chao, was the founder of this family, which held the reins of power for eighteen years. Ngo-guyen took the name of \u524d\u738b Tien-ngo-vuong, governing for six years, which were passed in continuous wars.\n\nHe left the crown to his son, a minor, under the regency of \u4e09\u54e5 Tam-ca, who usurped the throne, proclaiming himself king under the name of \u5e73\u738b Binh-vuong. Tam-ca, however, was soon defeated by another son of Ngo-guyen, called \u5f8c Hau, who in an expedition against the rebels of \u592a\u5e73 Thai-binh was killed by an arrow in 958.\n\nDuring this period there is no record of the issue of any coins in Annam.\n\nThe twelve \u4f7f\u541b Su-quan.\u2014958-968.\n\nAt the time of the death of Hau the country was divided into twelve \u5dde Chau. Their Governors refused to recognize the authority of the Ngo Family, and each of them proclaimed himself king in his own district. This state of things lasted for ten years.\nThe Dinh Dynasty.\u2014968-981.\n\nOne of the above-mentioned Governors took into his service Dinh Bo-lanh, an Annamese, who fought against, and finally conquered the other eleven Governors, and in 968 proclaimed himself king under the name of \u5148\u7687 Tien-hoang, giving to his kingdom the name of \u5927\u8d8a Dai-viet.\n\nHis reign lasted 25 years and was very glorious. He made a commencement in the work of organizing the country, passed good laws which were fairly administrated, kept up a regular army, and coined cash. At his death the country again fell into a state of anarchy. He had nominated as his successor his third son Han-lang, but this prince was murdered by his elder brother. The second brother Trieu, aged six years only, then reigned for a short time, under the regency of a General of the palace; but soon this General found it more convenient to proclaim himself king, thus putting an end to the Dinh Dynasty.\n\nNo. 1.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u5927\u5e73\u8208\u5bf6 Thai-binh-hung-bao.\n\nReverse.\u2014The character Dinh, the name of the Dynasty.\n\nNo. 2.\u2014Obverse, same as before.\n\nReverse, plain.\n\nCoins made by the king \u5148\u7687 Tien-hoang.

This prince, whose conduct was extremely cruel and bad, soon afterwards proclaimed himself king and committed\nevery kind of excess and crime, inventing new tortures and ruining the country in every way.

They were made principally of white copper, and are rather smaller than the ordinary Chinese cash.\n\nXII.\n\nThe \u674e Ly Dynasty.\u20141010-1225.\n\nAnother general of the palace, LY CONG-UN, proclaimed himself king, and was afterwards known by the name of \u592a\u7956 THAI-TO. At this time the kingdom of Annam became known by the name of \u4ea4\u8dbe Giao-chi, given by the Chinese Emperors; and the capital was established in \u6cb3\u5167 Ha-noi. Thai-to found the necessary elements for the consolidation of the royal authority, and made good use of them, giving birth to the first of the three great dynasties which ruled Annam prior to the present century. During his reign regular taxation was established upon fisheries and agriculture, such taxes being paid in rice and cash. The civil administration and the army were also re-organized; and for the first time the king received solemn investiture from the Emperor of China, thus admitting the right of sovereignty which the Chinese Empire pretends to hold over Annam. It is from this time that the Chinese claimed tribute, and later on, to enforce those claims, their armies invaded and occupied the country.\nThai-tong was succeeded in 1028 by his son \u592a\u5b97 Thai-tong, who during his reign of twenty-eight years had to fight only against the rebels who rose in arms in the frontier provinces. In 1036, having restored peace on the frontiers of China, he received from the Emperor the title of \u5357\u5e73\u738b Nam-binh-vuong. The most important of these rebellions was that under \u6cbb\u9ad8 Tri-cao, who, defeated in 1050, revolted again in 1052, invaded the Chinese provinces of \u5ee3\u6771 Kuang-tung and \u5ee3\u897f Kuang-si, and with the Annamese province of \u5ee3\u539f Quang-nguyen founded the kingdom called \u5927\u5357 Dai-nam, in which he was proclaimed king by his followers under the name of \u4ec1\u60e0 Nhon-hue. In the early days of his reign success attended him, and he defeated the various Chinese armies sent against him; but finally he was beaten, and his kingdom disappeared with him in 1054.\n\nDuring the reign of Thai-tong, Buddhism made great progress in Annam, the king ordering in 1031 the construction of nearly one thousand monasteries.\n\nIn 1055 \u5723\u5b97, Thanh-tong, son of Thai-tong, came to power, and his first act was to change the name of the kingdom to that of \u5927\u8d8a Dai-viet, used during the DINH Dynasty. His reign was peaceful, and in 1072 he was succeeded by his son \u4ec1\u5b97 Nhon-tong, notorious for his wars against the Chinese. The Emperor \u771f\u5b97 Chin-tsung of the Northern \u5b8b Sung Dynasty had decided to conquer Annam, and to that end he sent a numerous army, which, however, did not pass the \u5ee3\u539f Quang-nguyen frontiers. The army was detained for several months on these frontiers, and suffered great loss in every engagement it had with the Annamese, till at length peace was signed, and the invaders returned to their own country.\n\n\u795e\u5b97 Than-tong, a nephew of the last king, occupied the throne in 1128, and reigned until 1139; the only notice taken of him in the Annals was that he was mad. He was succeeded at his death by his son \u82f1\u5b97 Anh-tong, during whose reign\nthe port of Hai-phong was opened to trade with Siam, the Malay Peninsula, and Burmah. In 1142 a bronze called \u6649\u5229 THAN-LOI raised a rebellion, and was proclaimed king under the name of \u5e73\u738b BINH-VUONG. He was, at first, successful, collected numerous forces, and went to besiege the capital; but, routed on the way to Hanoi, he sought refuge in the mountains of Tunquin, where he was made a prisoner, taken to the capital, and decapitated.\n\nIn 1176 \u9ad8\u5b97 CAO-TONG, son of Anh-tong, came to power, and ten years afterwards he received his investiture from the Emperor of China, being called for the first time \u5b89\u5357\u738b Annam Vuong, or King of Annam. He was corrupt and addicted to vice, and was dethroned by a military rebellion in 1211. His son \u60e0\u5b97 HUE-TONG, supported by his father-in-law \u9673\u674e TIEN-LY, succeeded to the throne. The kingdom was in a very disturbed state: the \u674e Ly Dynasty had already lost the prestige acquired by its first kings, and the fear of imaginary or real dangers which surrounded the life of the king made him lose his reason and his throne. He became mad and abdicated in 1225 in favour of his daughter \u662d\u76db CHIEU-THANH. The \u9673 Tran family did not lose such a good opportunity to obtain the crown; one of its members \u9673\u666f TRAN-CANH married the queen, and, on her abdicating in favour of her husband, the Ly family, the true founders of the Annamese kingdom, disappeared from power.\n\nNo. 5.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u9806\u5929\u5927\u5bf6 Thuan-thien-dai-bao.\n\nReverse: plain.\n\nCoin issued during the reign of \u592a\u7956 THAI-TO, the first king of this dynasty, (1010 to 1028).\n\nThe two following kings issued no coins.\n\nNo. 6.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u4e7e\u7b26\u5143\u5bf6 Can-phu-nguyen-bao.\n\nReverse: plain.\n\nThis coin was issued during the reign of the Emperor \u592a\u5b97 THAI-TONG.

The Chinese traders immediately took advantage of this circumstance, and had Chinese cash recast into smaller ones, exporting them from their own country into Annam. In consequence of the abundance of coins caused by this proceeding the manufacture of cash was suspended by the Annamese government for a period of fifty years.\n\nNo. 7.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u5929\u7b26\u5143\u5bf6 Thien-phu-nguyen-bao.\n\nReverse: plain.\n\nDiminutive coin made during the reign of the Emperor \u4ec1\u5b97 Nhon-tong in his seventh nien-hao.

He was requested by his courtiers to return to the capital, but as the Chinese were then invading the kingdom, he went to the frontier with his army and drove them back to their own country.\n\nTired however of the throne, Thai-tong abdicated in 1258 in favour of his son \u8056\u5b97 Thanh-tong, who had to fight and drive away the Mongols then invading Annam for the first time. But he ultimately had to agree to pay a triennial tribute to China, which has been continued to the present day. The rest of his reign was peaceful; following his father's example, he abdicated in 1279 in favour of his son \u4ec1\u5b97 Nhon-tong.\n\nWhen this king ascended the throne, an order was received from the Emperor Kublai that he should personally appear at his court. The king refused to accede to this demand, and thus originated the second Mongol invasion of the country, in 1285, by an army of 500,000 men commanded by O Manhi. A brother of the king, called Tran ICH-TAC, took the side of the Mongols, and together they defeated the Annamese\narmy, driving the king to the mountains of the Thanh-\nhoa province. Once masters of the country, the invaders\nraised the treacherous Tran Ich-tac to the throne, but the\nloyal Annamese very soon gathered a fresh army which defeated\nthe Mongols in several battles, and compelled them to recross\nthe frontiers. In 1286 another Mongol expedition came to\nAnnam, but was also defeated and driven back to China. In\n1288 peace was signed. Four years afterwards the King\nNhong-tong abdicated in favour of his son Anh-tong.\nNothing particular is mentioned about him in the Annals,\nexcept that he abolished the custom followed by his predecessor\nof tattooing on the legs the picture of a dragon as a mark of\nnobility and sign of valour.\n\nAnh-tong also abdicated in 1314 in favour of his son Minh-tong,\nwhose reign was peaceful and devoted to the\norganization of the country. Following the rule established\nby his predecessors, the king ceded the throne in 1330 in\nfavour of his son Hien-tong. This king died after a\nreign of twelve years without leaving a direct heir, so his\nyounger brother Du-tong was made king under the\nregency of his father, the King Minh-tong.\n\nDuring the reign of Du-tong the kingdom was on several\noccasions desolated by droughts and floods, which necessitated\nfrequent distributions of rice and cash to the needy. There\nwas also a considerable number of rebels and thieves in the\nprovinces, which were taken prisoners and beheaded. At\nthis time the export trade of Annam was largely developed,\nand the number of foreign vessels arriving at its coasts became\nquite important.\n\nKing Du-tong died in 1368 without leaving a direct heir,\nand on this account there is an interregnum of two years in\nthe history of Annam, passed in fights and quarrels between\nthe members of the Royal family. At last, in 1370, Nghe-tong\nwas proclaimed king; at first he had to maintain\nhis rights against another Royal Prince, and three years later\nhe was driven from his capital by the hordes of Ciampa who invaded the country. The king then abdicated in favour of his younger brother \u9732\u5b97 DUE-TONG, who in 1378 was killed in a war against Ciampa.\n\nThen came to power a nephew of the King Nghe-tong, called Prince KIEN, and designated by the name of \u5ee3\u5e1d PHE-DE, who, after a reign fraught with disturbances and rebellions, was dethroned and succeeded in 1390 by \u9806\u5b97 THUAN-TONG. It was at this period that the decline of Annam's power set in. The kings were unable either to repress the rebellions which broke out in the provinces, or to resist the invasions of neighbouring tribes. The people lived in a continual state of war, and this contributed to the rise, above their ordinary sphere, of the more fortunate generals. The result was the same as in every country in the world: the military prestige gained by the victories of those generals increased their ambitious views and made them anxious to place the crown on their own heads, either by palace intrigues, or by a rebellion of the soldiers under their command. Thus, during the reign of Thuan-tong, it was easy to predict the course of events. His power was altogether in the hands of General \u80e1\u5e79\u5b63 Ho Qui-LY, whose influence during the last reign had already been paramount. In the same year in which Thuan-tong was proclaimed king, General Ho had the good fortune to defeat the mobs of a rebel bonze who had revolted in the province of Thanh-hoa under the name of \u660c\u7b26 XUONG-PHU; and to bring to a successful close a long campaign against the armies of Ciampa. Peace was restored in the country, and its real ruler Ho Qui-LY devoted himself to its administration, instituting the laws relating to Paper-money, as we have already seen. He also ordered the construction of a new city which was to be made the capital of the kingdom. This town, built in the province of \u6e05\u83ef Thanh-hoa, was called \u897f\u90fd Tai-do or Western Capital, and the Court took possession of it in the 11th moon of 1398.\nFour months later Ho Qui-ly forced the King Thuan-tong to resign in favour of \u5c11\u5e1d Thieu-de, a boy three years old. During the ceremonies of his proclamation, Ho Qui-ly nearly became the victim of a conspiracy against his life by the Lords and Mandarins; but they had to pay dear for it, as nearly four hundred of them lost their heads in consequence. At last this general became weary of supporting mock kings, and in 1402 took the throne for himself. His history will be continued later on when dealing with other rebels. He was dethroned in 1407 by the intervention of the Chinese army, and the Annamese proclaimed \u7c21\u5b9a\u5e1d Gian Dinh-de as their king, and proceeded to fight in the \u5b89\u5357 Nghe-an province against the customary invaders of the country. But another \u9673 Tran Prince raised his banner against him, and having assembled a numerous army, proclaimed himself king in 1410 under the name of \u91cd\u5149\u5e1d Trung Quan-de. This political division of the country was only favorable to the Chinese invaders, as was soon seen by the two Annamese parties, who in consequence joined hands under the supremacy of Trung Quang. But it was already too late, as the Chinese had made great progress, and at last, in 1414, made Trung Quang prisoner, subdued Annam, and caused it to become a province of the Chinese Empire.\n\nNo. 16.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u5143\u8c50\u901a\u5bf6 Nguyen-phong-thong-bao.

When that king died, Nhut-le, supported by his mother and by some officials of the palace, was proclaimed king in the capital and took \u54b8\u7d39 Cam-thieu for the name of his reign.

The first act of the new king was to try to obtain investiture from the Emperor of China, and to this end he sent several embassies announcing that the Royal Tran family was extinct. The Court of Nanking ordered exact information to be furnished of what had happened in Annam, and for this purpose sent to that country the Imperial Commissioner \u5b63 Li, who on his return from his journey to Annam made a report to the Emperor in which he stated that both Ho Qui-ly and Ho Han-thuong were only common rebels. In 1406, the Chinese decided to occupy the country, taking advantage of the great confusion existing at the time, and passed the frontiers in great numbers. After several battles between the Chinese armies and the troops of the rebels Ho, in which victory remained with the former, in the 5th moon of 1407 both Ho Qui-ly and Ho Han-thuong were made prisoners by the Chinese in the province of \u6e05\u83ef Thanh-hoa, and were murdered by the guard escorting them to China.\n\nThe Chinese remained in Annam, fighting against the followers of the Tran Dynasty who had revolted and proclaimed king \u7c21\u5b9a\u5e1d Gian-dinh-de.\n\nNo. 35.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u6f22\u5143\u901a\u5bf6 Han-nguyen-thong-bao,\nor original coin of Han-nguyen, the name of the reign of Ho Han-thuong.\n\nReverse, plain.\n\nCoin cast of red copper.\n\nNo. 36.\u2014Same as before, but having the characters \u5723\u5bf6 Thanh-bao, or holy coin, instead of \u5143\u5bf6 Nguyen-bao.\n\nRebel \u5929\u5e73 Thien-binh.\n\n1405-1406.\n\nThien-binh was an Annamese who had taken refuge at the Chinese court at Nanking when the throne of his country was usurped by Ho Qui-ly.

His followers proclaimed him king under the name of \u5929\u5e73 Thien-binh, but, in default of the aid promised to them by the Chinese, they were defeated in 1406 by the troops sent against them by Ho Han-thuong.

He was then proclaimed king of Annam, and took the name of \u6c38\u5be7 Vinh-ninh as the designation of his reign.

But this domination was never consolidated, and did not last very long, on account of the coming to the front of the Annamese hero \u9ece\u5229 Le-loi.\n\nTo pay the numerous troops sent to Annam, the Chinese Commander-in-Chief Ly-ban ordered in 1419 the following cash to be cast.\n\nNo. 39.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u4ea4\u8dbe\u901a\u5bf6 Giao-chi-thong-bao, or public currency of Giao-chi (Annam.)\n\nReverse, plain.\n\nThe metal employed for the casting of these cash was very bad and mixed with a great quantity of lead and sand.

His good fortune was by no means continuous, and he suffered several defeats; but his personal valour and his power over the Annamese armies kept up the movement and enabled him to inflict severe losses upon the Chinese army, and to force it to retire from the country.\nIn 1426 Le-Loi proclaimed a descendant of the Tran Dynasty king of Annam under the name of \u5929\u6176 Thien-Khanh, but his power was always eclipsed by that of Le-Loi, who in 1428, when Annam was freed from the invader, proclaimed himself king, giving birth to the second \u9ece Le Dynasty.\n\nDuring Le-Loi's rebellion several coins were cast for the payment of his followers.

He expelled the invading army from the country, and, on the 15th day of the 4th moon of 1428, proclaimed himself king in \u6cb3\u5167 Ha-noi, giving rise to the dynasty which governed Annam for a long period. The reign of Le-loi was comparatively a quiet one, and all his army had to do was to subdue some wild tribes of \u592a\u539f Thai-nguyen and \u5fa9\u79ae\u5dde Phuc-le-chau. Le-loi obtained investiture from the Emperor of China, by the payment of 50,000 taels of gold; he devised good administrative laws, which, however, were no sooner published than they were, unfortunately, altogether lost sight of.\n\n2nd King.\u2014\u592a\u5b97 Thai-tong. 1434-1443.\n\nThe reign of Prince \u5143\u9f8d Nguyen-long, younger son of Le-loi, was a peaceful one. He contributed materially to the development of the interests of the country, but made several mistakes in his policy, one of the greatest being the sentence of death passed upon General \u9ece\u5bdf Le-sat, a colleague of Le-loi. In 1437 he obtained investiture from the Emperor of China, receiving a gold seal in the form of a camel, weighing one hundred taels.\n\n3rd King.\u2014\u4ec1\u5b97 Nhon-tong. 1443-1459.\u2014The Prince \u90a6\u7fa9 Bang-ki, son of the last-mentioned king, ascended the throne when he was only two years old. He had some difficulties with China about the kingdom of Ciampa, but these were soon settled by his yielding to the Imperial will, and giving liberty to the king of Ciampa, who had been detained in An-\nnam as a prisoner. In the 10th moon of 1459 Bang-ki was murdered by the followers of his elder brother Nghi-dan, who proclaimed himself king, and reigned during eight months. His name is not included in the list of sovereigns in the Annals, as he was considered a rebel.\n\n4th King\u2014Than-tong. 1460-1498.\u2014Nghi-dan having disappeared, his brother Tu-thanh, fourth son of Thai-tong, was proclaimed king. During his reign the kingdom of Ciampa was destroyed, and its territories incorporated with Annam. The Annals are loud in the praise of this king, who evidently raised the country to its highest degree of splendour and wealth.\n\n5th King\u2014Hien-tong. 1498-1505.\u2014Out of thirty-four sons left by the last monarch, the crown passed to the elder, called Tang, who devoted himself to the organisation of the army, although the kingdom had the good fortune of remaining in a peaceful state during his reign.\n\n6th King\u2014Tu-tong. 1505.\u2014The Prince Tuan, third son of the last king, only occupied the throne during six months. His history may be briefly summed up by stating that as soon as he had performed the burial rites over the remains of his father, he died himself.\n\n7th King\u2014Oai-muc-de. 1505-1509.\u2014This Prince was the second son of king Hien-tong. Proclaimed king by a palace intrigue, he immediately showed his cruel nature by ordering the murder of the Queen Dowager and of the Minister of Rites. During his reign the Mac family began to assume the first position in the kingdom. The disorderly conduct of this monarch very soon disgusted the mandarins as well as the people; and the army, which then began to be of first importance in the country, revolted under the command of General Le-ninh. The king, being incapable of putting down this rebellion, committed suicide by taking poison, on the 1st day of the 12th moon of 1509.\n\n8th King\u2014Fuong-duc-de. 1509-1517.\u2014During this rebellion General Minh had proclaimed as king of Annam\nhis own brother \u5b97 Tong, whose history will be found with that of the rebels. When Tong died, Minh seized the throne for himself in the last moon of 1509, taking \u6d2a\u9806 Hong-\nTHUAN for the name of his reign. The example of his revolt and success was contagious, rebels appearing in all the provinces, and in 1511 the king very nearly lost his throne, being saved by the personal valour of General \u912d Trinh. This king did not attend to the well-being of his people, but devoted himself entirely to his own pleasures. He ordered the construction of boats to be manned by naked women, and invented many other ways of pandering to his lustful desires. To the mild remonstrances made on this subject by General Trinh, the king replied by ordering him to be bamboozled. The General revenged himself by revelling with his troops, and he murdered the king in 1517.\n\nTrinh, being then master of the country, took advantage of this to proclaim as king a boy of eight years called \u5149\u6cbb Quang-tri, who reigned only three days, and was later on strangled in the province of \u6e05\u83ef Thanh-hoa.\n\nAnother general called \u962e Nguyen appeared in arms against the General Trinh, and he proclaimed as king the Prince \u8ad6 Y. At that time the rebels had in their power more than half the kingdom, and allusion will subsequently be made to their struggles. Then began the rivalry between the two families of \u912d Trinh and \u962e Nguyen. Their power increased to such an extent that they ended by abolishing the royal authority altogether. The Nguyen family were soon compelled to retire to \u5ee3\u5357 Quang-nam, where they became independent, giving birth to the kingdom of Cochinchina, which two hundred years afterwards conquered Tunquin.\n\nThe Trinh, being Lords of the Palace, except on very rare occasions, always lived at the royal court of the L\u00ea kings. They were at the head of the army, they appointed successors to the kings, and they governed the country under the veil of a king who was made to disappear when he did not serve the\ninterests of the Lords. This great authority at length became hereditary, and thus called forth another dynasty side by side with the Royal L\u00ea.\n\nAnother family of successful Generals then appeared on the scene, and ultimately becoming more powerful than the two last-named, drove out the L\u00ea Dynasty and usurped the throne. This was the \u83ab Mac family, whose real power began in 1508, when one of its members was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the \u5929\u6b66 Thien-vo, the king's guards. The history of this family will be treated in chapter XVIII.\n\n9th King.\u2014\u662d\u5b97 Chieu-tong. 1517-1523.\u2014Was the Prince \u8af1 Y, who practically neither reigned nor governed. He had no personal history, and that of his country is reduced to a record of the contests between the Generals Trinh, Nguyen, and Mac. The latter had the advantage for a time, and \u83ab\u767b\u5eb8 Mac Dang-dung had the good fortune of overcoming not only his rivals, but also the rebels who existed in the provinces. He obtained from the king the appointment as Lieutenant-General of the kingdom, and his power was so great, that the king himself tried to escape from it, and one night quietly ran away from the palace to General Trinh's camp to obtain assistance. Mac at once took advantage of the situation, and after having appointed as king the Prince \u6625 Xuan, pursued the fugitive monarch as far as the Laos frontier, where he was made a prisoner, kept in captivity for five years, and finally murdered.\n\n10th King.\u2014\u6cf0\u7687 Cung-hoang. 1523-1527.\u2014The Prince \u6625 Xuan mentioned above was proclaimed king under the name of \u7d71\u5143 Thong-nguyen, and led a happy life to the end of his reign. He was relieved of the duties of his position by Mac Dang-dung, who enlivened his days with every sort of pleasure up to the 4th moon of 1527, when the king was forced to abdicate in favour of his first general, who lost no time in signing the king's death sentence. Then Mac Dang-dung proclaimed himself king of Annam under the\nname of \u660e\u5fb7 Minh-Duc, and occupied the whole country until 1533, when he had to retire to the North.\n\n11th King.\u2014\u838a\u5b97 Trang-Tong. 1533-1549.\u2014One son of the Prince \u798f Y, called \u5b81 Ninh, came down from the Ai-lao, where he had taken refuge, in company with General \u962e\u91d1 Nguyen-cam, and with an army of ten thousand followers began the work of reconquering his kingdom from the usurper. His first act was to send an embassy to China to explain to the Emperor \u5609\u9756 Kia-Tsing the political occurrences which had taken place in Annam. In consequence of this, an Imperial Commissioner was appointed in 1536, and supported by a strong army, passed over the frontier from the province of Kuang-si. On the strength of the Commissioner's report to the Emperor, the sovereignty over Cochinchina was given to the descendant of the Le family, and Tunquin was left to be occupied by the Macs. But Prince Ninh, who reigned under the name of \u5143\u548c Nguyen-hoa, continued the war against the Macs, taking from them the provinces of \u6e05\u83ef Thanh-hoa and \u5c71\u5357 Son-nam.\n\n12th King.\u2014\u4e2d\u5b97 Trung-Tong. 1549-1557.\u2014During this reign began the supremacy of the Trinh family, to whom all the Le kings were soon subordinate. General \u962e\u91d1 Nguyen-cam the restorer of the Le, had died of poison, and as his two sons were still of tender years, his position was occupied by General \u912d\u6aa2 Trinh-Kiem. The whole of this reign was passed by this general in making war against the Macs, and fearing the power that might be exercised by the two sons of Nguyen-cam on arriving at majority, he made them feudal lords of the provinces of \u9806\u5316 Thuan-hoa and \u5ee3\u5357 Quang-nam then occupied by the Macs. The history of the principality thus formed, and from the rulers of which the present dynasty descended, will be found in chapter XIX.\n\n13th King.\u2014\u82f1\u5b97 Anh-Tong. 1557-1572.\u2014Trinh-Kiem followed up the war against the Macs, and with an army of fifty thousand men entered the province of \u5c71\u5357 Son-nam where he\nwas defeated. He soon, however, got men together again, and in 1560 reached the neighbourhood of Ha-noi, the capital of the Macs. In 1569 he transferred his power to his son Trinh-tong, who was unable to occupy his position until he had fought against one of his brothers. He continued the war against the Macs in the province of Thanh-hoa, and for the first time, in 1572, sent the royal troops to fight against the Nguyen in the Quang-nam; but they were defeated.\n\nThe power and authority of Trinh-tong in the palace were so great that the king was practically put aside. Desirous of ending this thraldom, Anh-tong ran away secretly to the province of Nghe-an. Trinh-tong acted as the Macs had done previously; he appointed another king and went to Nghe-an where he made Anh-tong prisoner, and murdered him.\n\n14th King The-tong. 1572-1599.\u2014This king, who was proclaimed by Trinh-tong, was naturally under his tutelage. The wars against the Macs went on, the king sometimes having to protect his territories against their invasions, and at other times invading Tunquin from the provinces of Ninh-binh, Nam-dinh, and Hung-hoa.\n\nTrinh-tong's good fortune carried him as far as the walls of Hanoi, which capital he took by storm in 1592, burning and destroying it, and capturing Mau-hiep, the Mac king. The same fate befell Mac Tuyen and Mac Kinh-chi, and after some diplomatic negotiations with the Emperor of China, Trinh-tong was allowed to exercise royal authority over the new provinces conquered from the Macs, who had only one small state left on the frontier. Then (1599) Trinh-tong was appointed Binh-an-vuong, or Peaceful Prince. The king being sick he nominated his successor to the throne.\n\n15th King Kinh-tong. 1599-1619.\u2014He was made king by the will of his father, but by the authority of Trinh-tong. This powerful Lord had to quell several military rebellions, and at one time he was very seriously menaced by\na conspiracy in which one of his own sons and the king had taken part. The conspiracy was discovered in time, and Trinh-tong, having made the king prisoner, hanged him in his own palace.\n\n16th King.\u2014\u795e\u5b97 Than-tong. 1619-1642.\u2014This king was also nominated by Trinh-tong, who was now growing old and feeble. He tried to secure the succession to his power by dividing it between his two sons, in order to avoid dissensions. But jealousy broke out in his family even before his death, as not only both his sons but also one of his brothers tried to secure his power. Trinh-tong was taken ill to his brother's house and there his younger son was murdered. The elder, called \u912d\u838a Trinh-tang, hearing of this, ran away to the province of Thanh-hoa, taking with him the king and the royal family. Trinh-tong was then driven away from his brother's place, and abandoned by the servants who had carried him away in a sedan chair, died alone on the road. So ended the statesman who had more capacity and energy than any other man mentioned in the whole of Annamese history, and who for the prosperity of the kingdom, as well as for his own protection, severed the heads of five kings and gave to the old L\u00ea dynasty a territory to govern.\n\nTrinh-trang succeeded his father on the throne, and seeing the power of the Macs reduced to the small state of Cao-bang, directed his activity to subdue the Nguyen; but the royal armies were repulsed in every expedition they made against the Quang-nam.\n\nIn 1642 King Than-tong abdicated in favour of his son \u7950 Huu.\n\n17th King.\u2014\u771f\u5b97 Chon-tong. 1642-1648.\u2014Nothing worthy of notice occurred during his reign, except an expedition against the Quang-nam principality, where the L\u00ea troops again had to take to flight. The king died in 1648, and his father Than-tong ascended the throne for the second time.\n\u795e\u5b97 THAN-TONG (2nd time) 1648-1662.\u2014TRINH-TANG was attacked in 1653 by the NGUYEN armies, which took possession of the province of \u5b89\u5357 Nghe-an, after having annihilated the royal troops sent against them. He died of grief in 1654 and was succeeded by his son \u912d\u78a9 TRINH-THAC, who at once despatched an army against the Nguyen, but was likewise defeated. In 1662 the king died.\n\n18th King.\u2014\u7384\u5b97 HUYN-TONG. 1662-1673.\u2014During his reign foreigners were forbidden to live in Annam, either for purposes of trade or religion. The king had still less power, if possible, than his predecessors, as Trinh-thac claimed the right of writing to and saluting him on equal terms, and of taking a seat on his left side at official receptions. In 1667 the Macs were finally driven away from Cao-bang.\n\n19th King.\u2014\u5609\u5b97 GIA-TONG. 1672-1675.\u2014During his reign Trinh-thac organized a formidable expedition against the Quang-nam principality, where he made war for seven months. But unable to obtain possession of the citadel of \u8d8a\u5be7 Tran-ninh, which he had besieged, and his army suffering great losses, he retired again to Tunquin.\n\n20th King.\u2014\u7199\u5b97 HI-TONG. 1675-1705.\u2014He was a brother of the last king, and his reign was a more peaceful one than that of many of the former kings, as all he did was to quell some small rebellions and to fight against an invasion made from China by the Macs in 1677.\n\nIn 1683 TRINH-THAC died, leaving his position to his son \u912d\u5e72 TRINH-CAN, who was able to devote himself to the organization of public affairs in Tunquin and made several good laws, one of them forbidding gambling, for instance.\n\n21st King.\u2014\u88d5\u5b97 DU-TONG. 1705-1727.\u2014He was the son of the last king, who was forced to abdicate by Trinh-can. But this Lord had but little time to use this new and serviceable instrument, as he died in 1708 leaving his authority to his son \u912d\u77dc TRINH-CANG. The latter passed many good laws, some of them relating to mining and\ncoinage, of which mention has already been made. He persecuted the Christian missionaries without mercy, and in 1723 passed sentence of death upon one European, which sentence was duly carried out. In 1727 he forced the king to abdicate in favour of one of his sons, but some time afterwards both the king and himself died within a short space of time of each other.\n\n22nd King.\u2014\u6c38\u6176\u5e1d Vinh-Khanh-De. 1727-1731.\u2014The new Lord, son of Trinh-Giang, and called \u912d\u6c5f Trinh-Giang, was very active, and took great pains for the good administration of the country. But like his predecessors, he wanted to govern as an absolute ruler, and not finding Vinh-Khanh so servicable as he desired, he degraded and imprisoned him in a fortress, where he was murdered four years afterwards.\n\n23rd King.\u2014\u7d14\u5b97 Thuan-Tong. 1731-1735.\u2014During his short reign no important event took place, with the exception of the printing of Annamese official books by order of the Government.\n\n24th King.\u2014\u61c7\u5b97 Y-Tong. 1735-1750.\u2014Trinh-giang was still the absolute master of the government, but the extent of his authority was the cause of his ruin. He indulged in every kind of vice, and to obtain money for his pleasures put the public offices up for sale. He obtained from the Emperor of China the title of \u5b89\u5357\u4e0a\u738b An-nam-thuong-vuong, or Supreme King of Annam, and this was the signal for the rushing to arms of the adherents of the Le Dynasty. It was then seen that the real king of Annam had no power as compared with the Trinh Lords. Rebels appeared in every part of the kingdom, and to hasten the destruction of the Trinh family, its representative Giang handed over his power to a favorite eunuch. He was relieved of it in 1739, and \u912d\u71df Trinh-Dinh took his place. In the following year the king abdicated.\n\n25th King.\u2014\u986f\u5b97 Hien-Tong. 1740-1786.\u2014The rebellions which broke out in Tunquin during this period, were almost\nwithout number. Princes belonging to the Royal family, generals, civil mandarins, common people, and out-casts from the hills, all rose in the provinces against the tyranny of the Trinh, as well as for their personal interests. Hien-tong was no more king than his predecessors, and Trinh-dinh bore up bravely against the weight of so many wars, which were at last subdued through the good organization of his army, and owing to the rapidity with which he moved from one province to the other. He died in 1765 and was succeeded by his son Trinh-sum, who, having restored peace in Tunquin, availed himself of the troubles in Cochinchina caused by the Tay-son rebellion, to invade that country with an army of thirty thousand men, who soon occupied Hue, the capital of the Nguyen. Trinh-sum received there the submission of the rebel chief and handed over to him the government of the Quang-nam province. Hearing that rebels had made their appearance in Tunquin, Trinh-sum hurried back to Ha-noi, having king Hien-tong still with him. He died in 1781 and was succeeded by his son Trinh-giai, who, seeing his power seriously endangered by a rebellion among his own troops, committed suicide in 1785, to avoid falling alive into the hands of the Tay-son chief Van-hue. King Hien-tong was ill in his palace, when the rebel entered it and submitted at once to the royal authority. The king died in the 9th moon of 1785.\n\n26th King.\u2014\u662d\u7d71\u5e1d Chieu-thong-de. 1785 \u2014The chief Tay-son, who perhaps at that time thought of reigning over Cochinchina only, consented to the proclamation of this king, and returned to his own country. But Chieu-tong made the same mistake as his predecessors in calling back the Trinh family and allowing them to resume their hereditary title of Lords. On receiving this news, Hue came at once to Tunquin, and in the 11th moon of the same year again took Ha-noi, the king escaping to Bac-ninh. But Chieu-tong did not receive help from any quarter, and hiding himself in the\nmountains, awaited the Chinese intervention which his wife and son went to seek from the Emperor K'ien-lung. His reign ceased from that date, although he still continued to rank as king in the Chinese army. However, his power and authority were gone, and when the Chinese army was defeated, he had to fly to Pekin, where he was appointed a Chinese mandarin of the fourth rank and was inscribed under the Tartar banners. His family also remained in China, and from that date the inhabitants of Tunquin, who had not lost their hatred for the Nguyen invaders, expected to find in every rebel who raised the flag of rebellion in their country a descendant of the old royal race. The last of these insurrections was that of the Brigade General Li Huang-tsa\u00ef in 1878.\n\nNo. 51.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u9806\u5929\u5143\u5bf6 Thuan-thien-nguyen-bao.\n\nReverse plain.\n\nCopper coin issued by King \u592a\u7956 Thai-to, founder of the \u9ea5 Le Dynasty.\n\nThe political convulsions which disturbed Annam at the beginning of the fifteenth century, prevented the casting of any legal coin by the last seven kings of the \u9673 Tr\u00e2n Dynasty.

For some years, in consequence of disastrous inundations, there was a remission of taxation on the Annamese, the loss to the revenue caused thereby being made good by increased taxation on the Chinese. In 1737 the treasury became so empty that to fill it the officials put up honorary titles for public\nsale. A mandarin could gain a step in rank by the payment of six hundred strings of cash, and the commonest man in the kingdom was able to obtain the highest rank by the payment of two thousand eight hundred strings.\n\nIn 1740 King Hien-tong ascended the throne, and during his reign a larger quantity of cash were cast than during that of any former king.

Having been excluded from the succession to the crown by the nomination of his younger brother \u90a6\u8b70 Bang-ki in 1443, he conceived the design of murdering him and ascending the throne. Nghi-dan set about his plans with great caution, endeavouring to gain over to his cause several mandarins, and at last, on the third day of the 10th moon of 1459, he secretly penetrated into the palace and ordered the king and his own mother to be killed.\n\nProclaimed king under the name of \u5929\u8208 Thien-hung, his first care was to send an embassy to China asking for the imperial investiture; but another palace intrigue put an end to his reign on the 6th moon of 1460.

The war was carried on with great rapidity, and the rebels soon invaded Tunquin after defeating the royal troops in several engagements. King Oai-muc-de, who had detained in his palace the prince of Cam-giang, ordered him and two of his younger brothers to be murdered.

General \u912d Trinh was despatched against him by the court, but his army was defeated, and Tran-tuan laid his plans for besieging the capital.

He soon gathered a numerous army, his soldiers being all dressed in black and having their heads shaved. After twice besieging Hanoi, he took it by storm in 1517, and then proclaimed himself king under the name of \u5929\u61c9 Thien-ung. He soon had to leave the capital, however, as the royal troops gathered round it in great numbers, and Thien-ung took refuge in the provinces of \u6717\u539f Lang-nguyen and \u6d77\u694a Hai-duong, transferring his authority to his son \u6155 Cung and finally becoming a priest.\n\nCung took \u5ba3\u548c Tuyen-hoa as the name of his reign and succeeded in establishing a small kingdom consisting of the provinces of \u6717\u539f Lang-nguyen and \u4eac\u5317 Kinh-bac.

Rebels without number revolted against their rule, and one of these was Quang-thieu,\na member of the royal L\u00ea family. In 1531 he assembled an army of loyal followers in the province of Thanh-hoa. Having defeated the troops commanded by Mac Dang-dung in person, he hastened to besiege the city of Tay-do (Hu\u00e9). His first successes were the cause of his ruin, just as it had happened before to many other rebel chiefs, for he allowed himself to be ignominiously surprised by General Mac-quoc, and being made a prisoner, he was transferred to Hanoi and sentenced to death by cutting to pieces.

Although numerous bands of rebels rose up in arms against him in nearly every province, he at first reigned over the whole of Annam, having his capital at Hanoi.\n\n\u83ab\u767b\u701b Mac Dang-dinh (1530-1537) succeeded in 1530 through the abdication of his father Mac Dang-dung. In 1536 the Emperor of China sent a commission to study the political status of Annam, and in consequence of the report received he declared war against the Mac. Mac Dang-ding died at the\nvery time that the Chinese armies passed the frontiers of the kingdom in 1537, and his father, resuming the management of affairs, hurried to submit to the Imperial will, and declared himself to be a vassal of China. The Emperor then divided the territories of Annam into two kingdoms, giving that of Cochinchina to the Le family, and declaring Tunquin to be a feudatory state of China under the government of the Mac.\n\n\u83ab\u798f\u6d77 Mac Phuoc-hai. 1541-1546.\u2014As already shown, on the death of Mac Dang-ding, his father Mac Dang-dung again took up the reins of government. He died in the second moon of 1541, and his grandson Phuoc-hai succeeded him. This prince at once asked for the confirmation of his power, which was granted him on the payment of a valuable tribute. He was very unfortunate in his wars with the Le rulers in the south, and lost several provinces in Tunquin.\n\n\u83ab\u798f\u6e90 Mac Phuoc-nguyen. 1546-1561.\u2014Was the son of Phuoc-hai, and to hold the throne, he had to fight against his younger brother \u4e2d Trung, who aspired to that position.\n\n\u83ab\u8302\u6cbb Mac Mau-hiep. 1561-1592.\u2014Was the son of the last-named ruler. In his wars against the Le he lost his capital Hanoi, which he however reoccupied in 1573. Forgetting to take a lesson by his past misfortunes, he gave himself up to pleasure, and paid no attention to the great invasion of Tunquin which Trinh-tong was then preparing. In 1592 he again lost his capital, and was made a prisoner by the Le troops. Carried to Hanoi, Mau-hiep was condemned to be exposed to the sun in an iron cage for three days, and he was afterwards sentenced to be put to death by being slowly cut to pieces.\n\n\u83ab\u5b9c Mac Tuyen. 1592.\u2014His father Mau-hiep had abdicated in his favour sometime before having been made a prisoner. Tuyen was not less unfortunate, however, for his troops were defeated by the Le armies. Soon after his accession he was made a prisoner and murdered.\nThis prince came to power by the death of Tuyen. He assembled the dispersed bands of his troops and formed in Dong-trieu an army of seventy thousand men, with whom he defeated the forces sent against him by Trinh-tong. But fortune soon turned against him, and in the first moon of 1593 his army was utterly defeated, and he himself made a prisoner by the royal Le troops.\n\nThe rest of Mac's army retired to the North of Tunquin, establishing the court and their camps in Van-ninh. Thence they began to devastate the territories of the Le, and became so troublesome that the king had to appeal to the Lord Nguyen for help. With his aid the royal troops defeated the Mac several times, but the power of these Lords becoming very feeble, they appealed to the Emperor of China, accusing the Lords Trinh of having usurped the royal authority and making use of the name of the Le Dynasty merely to screen their position as real rulers' of the country. The Emperor again despatched a Commission to Annam, and after hearing its report in 1598, he gave to the Mac family the sovereignty over the two provinces of Thai-nguyen and Cao-bang.\n\nFrom this time the Lords Mac lost all their importance, and could only maintain themselves in their small territory by the help they received from China. They attempted the invasion of Tunquin on several occasions, but were always defeated, and in 1667 they were finally driven away from Cao-bang by Trinh-tac. They reappeared as invaders of Tunquin in the same year, but their army, composed of undisciplined Chinese bands, was completely routed; and the Emperor of China put an end to their last hopes by ordering them away from the Annamese frontiers.\n\nNo. 170\u2014Obverse\u2014Minh-duc-nguyen-bao.\nReverse plain.\nIron coin issued by Mac Dang Dung.\nNo. 171\u2014Obverse\u2014\u660e\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6 Minh-duc-thong-bao.\n\nReverse.

The elder of the two brothers, known under the name of \u962e\u7687 Nguyen-hoang, and under the title of \u4ed9\u738b Tien-vuong, was considered the chief of the principality. He went to Cochinchina in 1562, establishing himself in the provinces of Quang-nam and \u9806\u5316 Thuan-hoa, where he passed ten years, occupied in the work of subduing the native chiefs who would not submit to his authority. In 1572 the Lords Mac, who then pretended to be the real sovereigns\nof these states, sent against the Nguyen an army of ten thousand men, which was defeated. The Lords Trinh likewise sent some royal troops to fight against the Nguyen, but they also were repulsed by Hoang, whose authority was much strengthened by these victories. Nevertheless, the Lords Nguyen did not consider themselves sufficiently strong to resist openly the royal power of the Le rulers, still maintained with great vigour by the iron hand of the Lords Trinh. In 1593 the chief Hoang went personally to the court of King The-tong, bringing with him a tribute from his provinces, and an army to be employed against the Lords Mac.\n\nIn 1622 the Nguyen declared themselves in open rebellion against the Le Dynasty and the Lords Trinh, and refused to pay any more tribute, or to send any more soldiers. At that time they were able to resist several invasions of their territory by the royal armies.\n\nIn 1637 a Dutch settlement, which existed till 1700, was founded on the coast of Quang-nam.\n\nIn 1653 the Nguyen armies invaded Tunquin for the first time, and after defeating the royal troops, occupied the province of Nghe-an, but had to give it up again in 1660, owing to the rivalry existing between the two generals in command. They also enlarged the principality on its Southern and Western frontiers by occupying the whole of Cambodia and annexing it to Cochinchina.\n\nThe division of the kingdom was then practically made, and the name of Annam was applied to Tunquin only in the possession of the Le family. Cochinchina formed another kingdom under the name of Dong-nai, with its capital at Hu\u00e9.\n\nThen followed a long period of peace which was employed by the Lord Ngai-vuong and his successors in reorganizing the country, exhausted and tried by so many wars. However, the faults to be found in the constitution of any Annamese power were soon revealed in the government of\nthe Quang-nam Principality. To the first Nguyen rulers, good and intelligent men, had succeeded others, full of vice and ready to commit any kind of crime. Thus was the way prepared for the great rebellion of the Tay-son, which overthrew all the old institutions of the kingdom. This rebellion is perhaps the most important event in the whole history of Annam.\n\nXIX.\n\nThe \u897f\u5c71 Tay-son Rebellion.\n1764-1801.\n\nAnnam is certainly the country in which there have been the greatest number of rebellions, and the most important one is without doubt that of the Western Mountaineers, who rebelled in 1764 in the province of \u5e73\u5b9a Binh-dinh, and soon afterwards became the masters of the whole Annamese territory.\n\nThere exist two different versions of the origin of this great rebellion. According to the Annamese version, as given by Mr. Petrus Vinh-ky, there lived in the country of Binh-dinh a Tunquineese family of prisoners of war who had formerly inhabited \u53cb\u5b89 Nghe-an, and who were taken down to Cochinchina by the Nguyen armies during the reign of \u795e\u5b97 Than-tong. One of the members of this family, called \u962e\u6587\u5cb3 Nguyen Van-nhac, rose to the position of Bien-lai or Treasurer of the Customs station at Van-don. This Nguyen Van-nhac lost heavy sums by gambling, and to pay these amounts he embezzled Government money under his charge. Fearing discovery, he fled to the Tay-son mountains, and there soon collected around him about three thousand criminals, thieves and pirates. He appointed his two brothers \u6587\u60e0 Van-hue and \u6587\u7de3 Van-lu lieutenants of this army, whose first operations were to attack and plunder the Customs stations on the frontier and to pillage the rich families in the country. The men of that army took the name of \u897f\u5c71 Tay-son, and the revolt is known by the name of the Rebellion of the Western Mountaineers.\nThe Tay-son rebels successfully resisted the armies sent against them, emboldened by the victories they obtained, until they seized the citadel of Binh-dinh, having entered its walls by a stratagem somewhat similar to that of the famous wooden horse of the siege of Troy. The rebel chief however soon found himself hard pressed on the North by the royal troops of the L\u00ea Dynasty, under the command of Trinh-sum, and on the South by those of the Lords Nguyen. Van-nhac thought it prudent to cast in his lot with that of the Lords Trinh, by whom he was soon employed to expel the Nguyen from the country. This end being obtained, he was created Trinh-thanh Vuong, in 1775, and appointed by royal authority Governor of Quang-nam. In 1776 the war against the Nguyen was continued and their last King Duc-tong and his son were made prisoners and beheaded in Saigon. In 1777 Van-nhac took advantage of the royal armies having returned to Tunquin to proclaim himself king of Cochinchina under the name of Thai-duc.\n\nBut at the same time a nephew of King Duc-tong, the last representative of the Nguyen family, raised his standard against the Tay-son rebels, and after many contests in which success and reverses were equally divided, he put an end to the rebellion, and in 1801 occupied the throne of Annam, taking Gia-long as the name of his reign and founding the present Dynasty of the country.\n\nThe Chinese version of the Tay-son revolt is that the Lords Trinh, in order to take advantage of every possible way of destroying the power of the Nguyen, bribed two of their officials, Van-nhac and Van-hue, and commanded them to revolt and take the capital Hu\u00e9, and thus annihilate the race of their rulers. It is easy to perceive that this version is not a correct one, as it was Lord Trinh himself who took Hu\u00e9 and subsequently received the submission of the Tay-son.\n\nWe have seen that in 1777 Van-nhac proclaimed himself king and appointed his brother Hue commander-in-chief.\nRivalry soon broke out between the two brothers, and a fight ensued between their two armies, but a common danger brought them together again. In order to prevent such differences for the future, they divided, in 1785, the territories already conquered into three kingdoms, each kingdom to be governed by one of the brothers. The following table will give an exact idea of this division.\n\n**First brother.**\n\n| Name          | Accession | Name of Reign | Year of Adoption of Name of Reign |\n|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Nguyen Van-nhac | 1764      | Thai-duc      | 1777                              |\n\n**Second brother.**\n\n| Name          | Accession | Name of Reign | Year of Adoption of Name of Reign |\n|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Nguyen Van-hue | 1785      | Quang-trung   | 1786                              |\n| Nguyen Van-toan | 1791     | Canh-thanh   | 1791                              |\n|                |           | Bao-hung     | 1800                              |\n\n**Third brother.**\n\n| Name          | Accession | Name of Reign | Year of Adoption of Name of Reign |\n|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Nguyen Van-lu | 1785      | Dong-dinh    | 1785                              |\n\nVan-nhac took the title of \u5927\u7687\u5e1d Dai-hoang-de or Emperor, and occupied the territories of the \u5ee3\u5b89 Quang-nam to the South of \u5e73\u5b9a Binh-diuh, his capital being at the port of Quinhon. He died in 1792 leaving as successor his son \u601d\u671d Tu-trieu, who was immediately deposed and some time afterwards murdered by his uncle Hue.\n\nVan-hue occupied the whole of Tunquin and a part of Cochinchina, having his capital at first in Hu\u00e9 and afterwards in \u4e2d\u90fd Trung-do, in the province of \u4ea4\u5b89 Nghe-an. In December of 1789 he received his investiture and seal from\nthe Emperor of China, and being thus recognized as king of Annam, he sent to Peking the amount of two tributes. He died in 1791, and in the following year his son and successor Van-toan incorporated with his kingdom the territories belonging to the son of Van-nhac.\n\nVan-lu was a bonze and his reign but a short one. Proclaimed king of Binh-thuan and lower Cochinchina in 1785, he established his capital at Saigon, whence he was soon driven away by the army of Gia-long, which in 1788 conquered the whole of Lu's kingdom.\n\nThe above notices will be sufficient to give an idea of the importance of the Tay-son rebellion. These rebels occupied in fact the whole of Annam, and the Chinese Emperor K'ien-lung, after having invaded that country and failed to restore the throne of the last Le Prince, recognized Van-hue as king, in 1789, and received him in his summer palace at Jehol.\n\nThe story of the contest between the armies of the Tay-son and those of Gia-long is a long one, and of no special interest, as it merely consists of a long list of battles in the Annamese style, in which appears as victor the very same chief who the day before had been defeated. Gia-long had the good fortune of being assisted by the Bishop of Adran who caused the French Government to interfere for the first time with the affairs of Annam. In 1801 Quinhon, the last stronghold of the rebels, fell into his hands, and thus ended the most formidable rebellion that has ever devastated Annam.\n\nNo. 177.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u6cf0\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6 Thai-duc-thong-bao.\nReverse plain.

Another Chinese army commanded by General \u70cf\u5927\u7d93 Hu Ta-king invaded Annam from Yunnan. They were joined by the irregular Annamese troops who had remained faithful to the fallen dynasty, and after several easy victories following each other in rapid succession, the Chinese commander-in-chief entered Ha-noi in December of the same year and re-instated King Chieu-tong on the throne.\n\nA month afterwards, however, the rebel chief Hue entered Ha-noi by stratagem, and having come upon the Chinese unawares, completely routed them and forced the Viceroy and the Annamese king to re-cross the frontier into China.\n\nThe court of Peking degraded the Viceroy Sun and gave the supreme command of the army to \u5bcc\u7db1\u5b89 Fu Kang-ngan, Viceroy of the \u96f2\u8cb4 Yun-Kuei (Yunnan and Kuei-chao). The new commander-in-chief re-entered Annam without delay, concluded a truce with Hue, and wrote a long report to the\nEmperor in support of the rebellion. Thereupon K'ien-lung issued the following edict, published in the \u5927\u6e05\u6703\u5178 Ta Tsing Vui-tien in 1789.\n\n\"In consequence of a revolution King \u9ece\u662d\u7d71 Le Chieu-tong lost his royal seal and became a fugitive. The Annamese then recognized as head of the Government \u962e\u5149\u5e73 Nguyen Quang-binh (\u5149\u4e2d Quang-trung, or Hue) who now submits to our authority and craves permission to come to Peking to gaze upon our august Majesty. The provincial judge of Kuang-si, \u6210\u6797 Tch'eng-lin, is hereby commanded to invest him with royal power in our name, and to bestow upon him a gilt silver seal in the shape of a camel.\"\n\nAfter the promulgation of this edict the Chinese armies were ordered to retire from Annam, and thus closed the war.\n\nNo. 212.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u4e7e\u9686\u901a\u5bf6 Can-long-thong-bao.\n\nReverse. \u5b89\u5357 An-nam.\n\nWhite Copper. Cast in Yunnan for the payment of the Chinese troops.\n\nThe \u962e Nguyen Dynasty.\n\nFrom 1776 to the present time.\n\nKing \u5609\u9686 Gia-long was the nephew of King Due-tong, the last sovereign of Cochinchina, and being gifted with an active mind and with great powers of organization, he determined to reconquer the territory which had been taken possession of by the Tay-son rebels.\n\nHis luck was at first a very changeable one, for at one time he reigned in the South of Cochinchina with absolute power, and at another he found himself alone, persecuted, without an army, and forced to take refuge in Siam. At last success favoured him. With the help of the French, secured through the direct intervention of the Bishop of Adran, and assisted by the Siamese and Cambodian armies, he not only re-occupied the former territory of the Quang-nam Principal-\nity belonging to his family, but also took possession of the whole of Tunquin. Out of these conquests he formed the kingdom of Annam, and in 1801 proclaimed himself king, thus founding the Nguyen Dynasty, which is still in power at the present day.\n\nSince then four kings have ascended the throne. The history of their reign contains but little worthy of note; moreover, it is still of too recent a date to be dealt with impartially. These four kings are principally remarkable for their hatred towards foreigners and for their persecution of the Christians. It is only through the pressure of European armies that they have consented to open several ports to foreign trade, and at this very moment the country seems to be passing through a crisis, menaced as it is by the intervention of the French in Tunquin, who may possibly annex it in the same way as they annexed Lower Cochinchina twenty-five years ago.\n\nNo. 213.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u5609\u9686\u901a\u5bf6 Gia-long-thong-bao.\n\nReverse plain.\n\nThree kinds of cash, made of copper, lead, or zinc.\n\nNo. 214.\u2014Same as before, but of larger size.

(1831-1834). The Nung Rebellion. (1832-1835.)\u2014Doubtful Coins. (1600 to date.)\nThe Nguy-khoi Rebellion.\n\nKhoi was an officer of high rank in the employ of the Government in Lower Cochinchina. He was accused of holding ambitious views and of wishing to assert his independence, and therefore was called to the court of Hu\u00e9 to give an account of his actions. Afraid to appear, he raised the standard of rebellion in the province of Saigon, and very soon became master of the Mytho, Bien-hoa, Baria and Mo-xai districts.\n\nKing Minh-mang became seriously alarmed at the proportions of this rebellion, and sent troops by land and sea to quell it. The royal army slowly regained possession of the disturbed districts, with the exception of Saigon, which became the centre of the insurrectionary movement, the inhabitants offering serious resistance. The town was besieged, and had it not been for the treachery of one of the rebel chiefs who opened the gates of the citadel, the royal troops would have been kept in check for a considerable time.\n\nKhoi was made a prisoner, taken to Hu\u00e9, and condemned to death by being slowly cut to pieces. About the same time nearly two thousand of his followers were put to the sword at Saigon and were buried in the place known to this day as the Field of Graves.\n\nNo. 240.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u6cbb\u5143\u901a\u5bf6 Tri-nguyen-thong-bao.\n\nReverse.

His fortunes\nwere checkered, and although he twice gained possession of the city of Cao-bang, on each occasion he had soon to retire before the royal troops sent against him.\n\nFor three years he kept the troops at bay in the mountains to which he had fled, but having suffered severe defeat at Bao-lac, he found himself compelled to seek refuge in China. On his arrival he was persecuted by the mandarins to whom the Annamese had applied for his extradition, and fearing to be caught, he re-entered Annam and tried to hide himself in the An-quang-xa woods. He was discovered, however, by the Annamese, who, fearing that he might again escape, surrounded the woods and set fire to them. On the following day the charred body of Nung Van-van was found near some rocks.\n\nNo. 241.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u5143\u9686\u901a\u5bf6 Nguyen-long-thong-bao.

Their Annamese origin is well established, but owing to the want of precise information regarding the history of the country, it has been\nfound impossible to place them under separate and distinct headings. It has therefore been considered best to class them as doubtful until the researches of others shall have supplied the means of determining the respective periods to which they belong.\n\nAmong them there are doubtless many from the Quangnam Principality, the rulers of which were kings de facto and issued coins at various times. But in making up the chronological tables of the different Annamese dynasties, the name used by these rulers in their own territory could not be traced, and it has therefore been found impossible to classify the coins issued by them.\n\nThe classification of other doubtful coins cast by certain rebels presents still greater difficulties owing to the shortness of time during which some of those chiefs were in arms, and to the fact that the names under which they fought, or the titles they assumed when in revolt, have not as a rule been recorded in Annamese books.\n\nThe following is a list of these coins:\n\nNo. 245.\u2014Obverse.\u2014\u7d39\u8056\u5143\u5bf6 Thieu-thanh-nguyen-bao.\n\nReverse.

M.S. Avec quantit\u00e9 de marques et caract\u00e8res Chinois.\"\n\nI at once wrote for the book and got it. It is a manuscript written on old Dutch paper, in English spelt as words were spelt towards the close of the last century. The writer apparently takes some trouble in writing \"the,\" but every now and then falls back into the 's' of his school days.\n\nThe first ten pages contain \"an explanation of the Custom House books.\" They throw some light on the method followed then (in 1753) by the Canton authorities in levying dues and duties upon shipping and goods. No author's name is given. The book was probably written by some factory merchant or a factory employ\u00e9 who collected all available information regarding the taxation of trade at Canton for the benefit of a friend or employer at home. The author quotes an account of the matter given him by a Mr. Lockwood while he was at Limpo (sic) in 1756. It appears therefrom that he was at that place, probably a Chinese place, in that year. Mr. Lockwood had procured the information given by him together with a Mr. Pigod. It appears not impossible that the last named gentleman be identical with a Mr. Pigou mentioned as a factory chief in the gunner's case of 1784. (See Davis, The Chinese, p. 57 in vol. I of the edition of\n\n* Read before the Society on the 29th August, 1882.\n1857.) No mention is made throughout the book of Mr. Flint who had been acting as interpreter to the factories in 1747 and just at the time when our manuscript was draughted must have been at the height of his reputation as a Chinese scholar and a judge of Chinese commercial and fiscal matters.\n\nThe second and greater part of the book consists of copies of the three Chinese tariffs then in force (the fixed tariff, the tariff of values and the comparative tariff.) The Chinese text of this part is apparently written by a Hsien-sh\u00eang, who did his work faithfully from beginning to end, whereas the English version is but partially entered in the spaces left blank for it. The translator did apparently not know Chinese, but made his entries with the assistance of a linguist. He confines his renderings to the names of articles in the tariff with the duty fixed for them. Sentences and other more complicated expressions are left untranslated. One cannot help being struck by the quality of the ink used in the Chinese portion of the tariffs; these characters look as if they were written yesterday, both in shape and in colour; we would have never credited them with a hundred and twenty years ago but for the quaint pale English writing they are mixed up with.\n\nThe division of the tariff is very much the same as that of the present Chinese one. The goods are brought into certain categories; the tariff units being generally the same as nowadays (100 catties, piece, etc.) Imports and Exports are not distinguished. The duties themselves appear low, though not so if we consider the great difference existing in the value of money then and now. It appears that five kinds of taxes were then levied on foreign trade, viz:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014An Import Duty, payable on merchandize imported by a fixed Tariff.\n\n2.\u2014An Export Duty, payable on all exports, irrespective of origin (i.e., including foreign goods re-exported to other Chinese provinces, say to Ningpo, to which place foreign ships\nresorted under exceptional circumstances), and consisting of a Tariff charge plus a six per cent ad valorem duty.\n\n3.\u2014Extra-charges on merchandize imported or exported, for\n\na.\u2014Remitting the duty to Peking,\nb.\u2014Sundry small charges for weighers, Linguists, \"Hoo-poo houses,\" etc.\n\nThese, it is stated, amounted in the case of Imports to nearly half the Tariff duty.\n\n4.\u2014The Measurage.\n\n5.\u2014The Present.\n\nCopies of the three Tariffs communicated in this manuscript are no doubt procurable at Canton, Peking, or elsewhere, as the Chinese text has been professedly copied \"from the Emperor's printed books.\" To us, however, the remarks made by a Foreign Merchant at those times, with details it is notoriously difficult to procure even as applied to the present day, are of greater interest than the official document. They contain quite a treasure of facts regarding the levy of duties upon goods and shipping which, not being mentioned by other writers of those times, may prove valuable to the student of Foreign and Chinese relations during the middle of the 18th century, and may be regarded a welcome supplement to the accounts of factory trade contained in the first volume of Sir John Davis' \"China,\" in Osbeck's voyage and the Chinese Repository. They read as follows:\n\nAn Explanation of the following Custom-house books, translated anno 1753, with the Manner of settling the duties on all goods imported and exported at the Port of Canton.\n\nThe Chinese have three books relating to the duties on all goods imported and exported at Canton, which have been examined and authorised by the Court of Hoo-poo, or Superintendence of Duties, Tributes, &c. at Peking, and are as follow:\u2014\n1st Ching Heang Ts\u00e9 L\u00e9, or the book of true and fixed duties.\n\n2nd P\u00e9 L\u00e9, or the book of Comparison.\n\n3rd Coo Ke\u00e0, or the book of Valuation.\n\nThe first of these books was made in the very beginning of the European trade to China, and finished as it now stands, in the 25th year of the Emperor C\u00e0ng H\u00e8 A.D. 1687, and was ordered never to be altered, or added to; on which account it is call\u2019d the book of true and fixed duties.\n\nUpon the increase of the trade to that place it was soon found impossible to do without either adding to the first book, or making a new one; great variety of different goods and toys being brought every year. The way they hit on was to make a second book, called the book of Comparison, in which all new articles are compared with some of the things in the first book of true and fixed duties, and the duty fixed according to the proportion they bear to them. For instance, in folio 3 of the second book, is the following article; Large Wax figures, one, compared with five pieces of Jasper Trifles manufactured, one piece four candareens.\n\nThat is to say, Wax figures (being things not mentioned in the book of fixed duties) one compared with five pieces of Jasper (that is; one figure by comparing it with Jasper which is in the first book, is thought equitable to pay equal to five pieces of that Jasper) one piece four candareens, (that is, one piece of Jasper pays four candareens) by which account it will be found, that one Wax figure pays the same duty as five pieces of Jasper, or two mace. To show what little care has been taken in this book, to compare things that have some analogy one to the other, and by that means to fix the duty with some appearance of equity; one need only turn over to the folios 3, 4, 9 and 18, where Tweezar cases, Swords, Hand organs, and Watches, are compared with Spying glasses; and\nat folio 50, Mariners compasses with Spectacles, with many others equally improper.\n\nThis book with about 150 articles collected together in it, was first sent to the Court of Hoo-poo at Peking for their approbation, in the end of the 11th year of the late Emperor Yong-ching A.D. 1733; and as there is something or other new coming continually to China, the same method is now used every two or three years, of sending the new articles to Peking, to be approved of there; so that this book which seems invented only to puzzle, will be increasing continually, while the first book which is put in an easy plain form, will be kept as it was above sixty years ago.\n\nThe third book is a Valuation price, set upon all goods that are, or may be exported from Canton, on which 6 per cent is drawn, and added to the other duty on such exports.\n\n* To select a few additional examples, a large Foreign musket paid as a Spying glass; a pair of Spectacles was the head which covered also a Foreign small knife, a pair of scissors, a set of knives and forks, etc.\n\n\u2020 These values may in some respect be compared to the \"valeur officielle\" as opposed to the \"valeur commerciale\" made use of in the trade statistics of several European countries. They were not subject to the fluctuations of the market, but fixed once for ever. We must assume that the prices contained in the Tariff of values appended to the manuscript were at the time of its being framed, based upon the actual condition of the market, though some of the rates there given strike us now as almost incredibly low. We should not forget, however, that money had quite a different value even in England a hundred years ago, and that the value of commodities may have been lower still in the Far East. We are astonished to read that in 1755 a picul of Silk could be valued at Tls. 100, one of Tea at Tls. 8; that White Sugar was worth Tls. 1.50, Brown Sugar Tls. 1, Sugar Candy Tls. 2.50; Rhubarb Tls. 1.50 per picul, Musk Tls. 1.50 and Opium (called Ya-pen) only 5 mace per catty. The value of a chest of opium would therefore, have amounted to not quite a hundred dollars. The existence of opium as an article of trade at Canton is certainly beyond doubt; opium is also mentioned in Kang-hsi's Tariff of 1687, and there pays a duty of 3 candareen per catty, constituting exactly six per cent of the fixed value appearing in the Ku-chia Book. There is nothing to show, however, whether the opium then sold at Canton is of foreign or of native origin. The fact of its being mentioned in the \"Book of values\" proves that it was in the habit of being exported; but this is also the case with many other articles of clearly foreign origin, and it appears that exports and re-exports were then treated alike. Some kind of re-export trade has probably existed from Canton to certain coast ports (we know that trade with Ningpo was constantly aimed at by the factory merchants); this may be concluded from the fact, that amongst the special rules appended to Kang-hsi's Tariff a restriction appears prohibiting the export to Fukien and Chekiang of spelter, foreign satin (Yang-tuan) and Cantonese Chinaroot (Tu-fu-ling).\nBesides the duty specified in these books, which is to be paid in Sisee, or pure silver; there is another, for charges in carrying the money up to Peking, to be paid in Sisee also: besides which are sundry small charges for Weighers, Linguists, Hoo-poo houses, &c.; making altogether on the Imports, which have no valuation, near half as much as the fixed duty. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain these charges exactly, as the Merchants, who at present pay the duties, and settle all the Custom House business, are obliged to comply with small encroachments, and are cautious of being too stiff in asserting their right, since those very people who receive it, have it in their power to be very troublesome, and greatly impede their business. The usual method they take is to pay the duties pretty much in the gross, yet if care be taken to get the account of the charges from proper people, they will not differ enough to be of any consequence in trade, not making above six or eight cash difference in a picul of goods; as the following examples of the duty on a picul of Bohea tea, procured from two different people will show.\n\nThe 1st Example.\n\nThe small charges, called the Peculage, are as follow:\n\n| Description                                      | m. c. c. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Fan-tow Coo\u00e8-li or pecul custom                  | 0 3 8    |\n| Chong-soon-quan, or the 1st Custom house going   |          |\n| from Canton to Whampoa                           | 0 0 8    |\n| S\u00e9-p\u00e1n Ch\u00ecng-chew, or the Weighers               | 0 0 2    |\n| Ts\u00e9-p\u00e1n Qu\u00e0n-tow, or the Writers                 | 0 1 6    |\n| Hoo\u00e8-quan, or the Joss house                     | 0 0 4    |\n| Tong-s\u00e9, or the Linguist                         | 0 2 0    |\n|                                                  | 0 8 8    |\n\nThe fixed duty, as per 1st Book, on one pecul of Bohea tea ........................................... 2 0 0\n\nKea-how, or charges for remitting the money to Peking being 10 per cent on the fixed duty .................................................. 0 2 0\n\nEight per cent to make the Dollars Sisee ............ 0 1 8\n\nCarried forward ........................................... 2 3 8\nBrought forward 2 3 8\nThun-fang, or the account of 2 per cent ......................... 0 0 4\nPeculage duty as above ........................................... 0 8 8\nCoo-ke\u00e1, or the valuation price of Bohea tea, being 8 Taels per pecul, as by that Book, 6 per cent.

Thus of Chinaware, which was not put to the scale, every ten pieces were considered to make one picul, and a barrel (t'ung) of it was also passed as \"a hundred catties,\"\u2014old China being always excepted. Iron Fans, Samshu, and several other articles were similarly treated. Of Chinese Spectacles 2,000 went on a picul, of Paper Fans, 1,600.\nis above 14 per cent. Of late years indeed since the company have imported large quantities of Cloth, and bought a good deal of Raw Silk, both which are packed in bales, on which there is a considerable advantage; the Merchants, with respect to the English trade, have been nearly on a par as to this allowance.\n\nThe Chinese measure all ships that come into their ports to trade, in order to calculate a duty, which ought in strictness (though not now always observed) to be paid before any business is begun. This has been a customary Port charge, ever since the Europeans have traded to China. They reckon three sizes or rates of ships, viz:\n\n| Covids | Covids | Tael Decs. |\n|--------|--------|------------|\n| A first rate is 75 Log. 23 Bro. or upwards and pays 7777 per Covid. |\n| A second rate is 70 \" 21 \" an on to a 1st rate pays 7143 do. |\n| A third rate is 60 \" 20 \" and on to a 2nd rate, and pays 5000 do. |\n\nBut it has been always found that when the rate was under a first and above a second, they have reckoned at that rate it was nearest, or else computed the measurage at an average.\n\nTo compute the measurage, the length (taken from the center of the fore mast, to the center of the Mizen mast) must be multiplied by the breadth, (taken from inside to inside of the middle Deck\u2014just before the Main mast) and that sum by the price, according to the rate of the ship. The produce is the Measurement, but the Emperor allows a deduction of 20 per cent. The remainder is the Emperors' real duty, on which the Hoo-poo has 10 per cent, and the Yng-fang, or the officers that attend him, 2 per cent; but the sum due to the Emperor and the Hoo-poo must be paid in pure silver. As our dollars have always been esteemed full $\\frac{3}{8}$th or Touch, we compute the difference at 7 per cent; but according to the present encroachments in the Emperor's Treasury, the merchant, or Linguist, to whom we pay this money is forced to make it 8 per cent; as in the above accounts of the duty on tea, and that sometimes passes with difficulty.\n\nBesides the measurage, every ship whether great or small, is charged with 1950 Tales, in lieu of all presents. This imposi-\ntion took its rise from an old custom among the Europeans, of giving small sums of money to different people in the Hoo-poo's Office. An evil of this sort once begun, increased yearly; till a Tsong-too (not many years ago) being appointed Hoo-poo, or custom master general of the port, finding that presents were given at his office, from eighteen hundred to two thousand Tales per ship, made a regular demand of 1950 Tales, and annexed the major part of it to the Emperor's duties, after having got it confirmed at Peking. The French, for what reason I don't know, pay 2050 Tales.\n\n| Length of the ship | 78.1 |\n|-------------------|------|\n| Breadth           | 24.2 |\n\nExample of a first rate.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1562 \\\\\n3124 \\\\\n1562 \\\\\n\\hline\n1890.02 \\\\\n7777 \\\\\n\\hline\n1323014 \\\\\n1323014 \\\\\n1323014 \\\\\n1323014 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis sum to be multiplied by the price of a first rate.\n\nThe measurage \\[1469,868554\\] \\[293,973710\\]\n\nfrom which deduct 20 per cent.\n\non which the Yng-fang has 20 * per cent and the Hoo-poo 10 per cent to be paid in Sisee for which add 7 per cent in Sisee for the Yng-fang paid in dollar money.\n\nThe Emperor's Duty \\[1175,894844\\] \\[117,589484\\]\n\nEmperor's and Hoo-poo's Duty \\[1293,484328\\] \\[90,843902\\]\n\nEmperor's and Hoo-poo's Duty \\[1384,328230\\]\n\nReckon 2 per cent on Emperor's Duty \\[23,517896\\]\n\nThe total measurage \\[1407,846\\]\n\nThe present \\[1950,000\\]\n\nTotal Port charge \\[3357,846\\] of the measurage and present. \u2020\n\n* This should read \"2 per cent.\" as the calculation shows.\n\u2020 An error in calculating the 7 per cent levied for Sisee payment (which should read 90,543,902 instead of 90,843,902) makes the total too high by 3 mace.\nThe Chinese characters, in these books, are copied exactly as they stand in the Emperor's printed books; and I have put just as many articles, and the same number of columns in every page, for the easier settling any of the particulars with the Chinese. Under each character is its pronunciation written in European letters; and in the columns next to the characters is the explanation of each article in English.\n\nThe articles left unfinished up and down in many places, are chiefly such linen cloths, stuffs, and silks as are made only for the use of the Chinese; and also of Herbs, Druggs, &c. of which very few of the names, if any, are known in Europe.\n\nThe last 39 pages in the Book of true and fixed duties not translated, consist of the Measurage of the Chinese and European ships; the 10 per cent to be taken from all goods in favour of the Merchant; the mixing good and bad sorts of goods together, and making an average duty on them; that good and spoiled things are not to pay alike; the Custom House passes for Chinese ships; the duties on greens and provisions for ships; the duties on fishing boats; with many other things of the same kind. The 10 per cent and the Measurage have been taken notice of above, and the rest are of little use; for as to the mixing of good and bad sorts of goods together and making an average duty on them, these are not above ten articles specified, (which are translated) and in other instances, when a plea is made that spoiled and good things are not to pay alike; the Hoo-poo himself is always the Judge, and settles it according to his own fancy and inclination.\n\nThe following account of the Duties and Impositions of a Ship at Canton, which is a very clear and distinct one, I received in a letter from Mr. Lockwood, while I was at Limpo in the year 1756.\n\n\"Enclosed you have an account of the Customs and every other charge on a ship at this Port that is procurable, which Mr. Pigod and I have found great difficulty in getting; and I\nflatter myself it is tolerably correct.

Von GEORG VON DER GABELENTZ.\n\nOf all the Chinese grammars so far published this is the most perfect, inasmuch as it unites with the fulness of Premare's work * the scholarly clearness of Schott's \"Chinesische Sprachlehre.\" Its author is the son of a renowned Chinese and Manchu scholar and now occupies the Chinese chair at the University of Leipsic; he has for a considerable number of years made the analysis of ancient written Chinese his chief study, and appears thus to have been specially qualified for the work he has given us. In writing this exhaustive work he meant it to become a detailed scientific hand-book for the classical and post-classical language, embracing all the material the present state of sinology furnishes; one of its main purposes would appear to be to enable the student to read and understand Chinese without the assistance of either teacher or translation, and to express his thoughts correctly in the language thus learned.\n\nThe Grammar is divided into three books. The first of these contains a sort of introduction to the study of the language and all that had to be said about sounds, tones and characters; also a chapter, quite new to Chinese grammatical literature, regarding the problems connected with the ancient sounds and etymological features of the language. In the introductory chapter a review is given of the history of the language as regards its various literary styles, its dialects and its relation to the languages of neighbouring countries,\n\n* It contains in all about 4,000 examples.\nalso some interesting remarks on the method to be applied to the study of the language. As regards the chapter following the introduction, the \"Laut-und Betonungslehre,\" i.e. the study of sounds and tones, it is to be regretted that the author has never had an opportunity to make studies on the spot; a year spent in different provinces of the Empire would have furnished him with ample material for scientific research in connexion with the dialects, the comparative study of which would constitute almost a science in itself. The first book closes with a chapter on the fundamental principles of the language. This subject, it must be clear to all who have watched the progress of sinology, is von der Gabelentz's own province. Since the pioneering work of Schott, the nestor of living sinologues, no one has contributed so largely as von der Gabelentz towards the building up of a regular system of Chinese grammar. I am well aware that there is no lack of scholars who do not believe in any system; who, like the Chinese themselves, have succeeded in grasping the sense of a Chinese text by a sort of intuition, and who judge of the correctness of a sentence, instinctively, as it were, by the routine of reading. Many will not admit any other but the imperfect method adopted by the Chinese themselves, who, with their Hs\u00fc-tze theory, are as ignorant of the grammatical structure of their language as they are ignorant of the science of logic. This is by no means to be wondered at. The Iliad was written generations before the existence of anything like an \\textit{ars grammatica}, and yet Homer has probably not written a line which is not consistent with the rules of his style. He may have been unconscious of these rules, but he was instinctively guided by them. A similar process takes place with those who, without rules, write and read Chinese correctly. No language would be intelligible without a certain conventional regularity in the use of sounds or signs. To discover the rules unconsciously followed by speakers or writers of a language is the object of the\nscience called grammar. The grammarian who, by means of analogy, lays down the terms upon which, in a language, human thought is expressed (whether by sounds through the ear, or by signs through the eye), performs work not absolutely necessary, for language was understood before him and would continue to be understood without him; but he performs work highly useful, inasmuch as those previously unconscious may, through him, become conscious of existing rules, which may be a help to those whose instinct in submitting to the rule is not that of the majority, and is thus likely to lead them into mistakes; while, on the other hand, those previously ignorant of the language may, through him, at once become acquainted with the rule without having to wait till habit enables them instinctively to follow it. To the latter class of students, especially, the grammarian furnishes a considerable short-cut in acquiring a language.\n\nIt is the special merit of von der Gabelentz to have not only added considerably to the stock of rules discovered by his predecessors from Pr\u00e9mare down to Julien, but to have made a successful attempt to construct a complete system of Chinese grammar. The following results, being the substance of the fourth chapter of Book I., may be considered the basis upon which his detailed work has been built up. With regard to words we distinguish:\n\n(a.) their fundamental meaning: whether they designate individuals, or classes, qualities, numerals, actions, or conditions, etc. It is from their fundamental meaning that we derive the categories of words which we are accustomed to call noun, adjective, verb, etc.; and\n\n(b.) the function they perform in a sentence, upon which it depends whether they be used as nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc., or whether we have to take them as representing the case of a noun, the comparative degree of an adjective, gender, mood, or tense of a verb, etc. Thus we consider \u5927 ta, great, as coming within the category of adjectives, whether it may or may not\ntemporarily perform the functions of a noun, meaning \"greatness,\" of an adjective, meaning \"in a great measure,\" or of a verb, meaning to \"magnify.\"\n\nWe consider the category as permanently attaching to the word, though the functions it performs may change.\n\nThe whole grammar which follows is based upon syntax, which again consists of a few rules, more or less obligatory, of position. The construction of a sentence is at once the first object of analytical research and of the synthetical use of the language.\n\nI. Subject and predicate are essential parts of a grammatical sentence; the expression of the copula (or substantive verb) is not essential. *The subject precedes the predicate:* \u738b wang, king, \u8a00 y\u00fceh to speak\u2014wang y\u00fceh the king said; \u6c11\u5b89 min an, the people (are) quiet.\n\nII. *A verb precedes its object.* Prepositions are verbs both as regards their origin and their syntactic treatment. \u6cbb\u570b chih-kuo, to govern the country; \u8ab0\u80fd\u77e5\u4e4b shu n\u00eang chih chih, who may know it? \u6b62\u65bc\u4ec1 chih y\u00fc j\u00ean, to have a firm stand in humanity. This rule is not without exception.\n\nIII. A grammatical part of a sentence (Satztheil) may consist of two or more words placed together co-ordinate to each other. Co-ordination may be either cumulative, as \"A and B,\" or alternative, as \"A or B.\" \u5c71\u6d77 shan hai, hill and sea; \u5167\u5916 nei wai, within and without, within or without; \u662f\u975e shih fei, to be or not to be, right and wrong; \u4e8c\u4e09 \u00e9rh san, two or three.\n\nIV. *A word by which another word is determined precedes the latter:*\n\n(a.) Genitive: \u5fc3 nai hsin, your heart; \u5929\u5b50 t'ien tz\u016d, the son of heaven.\n\n(b.) Adjectives: \u8056\u4eba sh\u00eang j\u00ean, holy man; \u5927\u592b ta fu, great man, dignitary.\n\n(c.) Numerals: \u56db\u65b9 ss\u016d fang, the four quarters.\n(d.) Adverbs: \u4e0d\u77e5 \\(pu\\) chih, not to know; \u4f55\u4e0d\u4f86 'ho p\u016b lai, why not coming? \u543e\u65e5\u4e09\u7701\u543e\u8eab \\(wu\\) jih san sh\u00e9ng \\(wu\\) sh\u00e9n, I daily thrice examine my person (myself).\n\nV. Apposition is formed by simply placing words together. \u5e1d\u582f ti Yao, the Emperor Yao; \u6587\u738b w\u00e9n wang=Wen rex, i.e. Wen, who was then king.\n\nVI. It seems natural and is as necessary to the Chinese mind, as it is to ours, to begin a sentence with that part of it which is to form its subject. * In connexion with this point it has to be borne in mind that the first thing we mean to speak of in a sentence, the psychological subject, is not always identical with the grammatical subject (our nominative case), as it may fall together with any other part of speech, such as a word denoting time or place, or even the grammatical object, a genitive belonging to the latter, etc. Such words have to be considered as standing outside the syntactical connexion and must be given an absolute position. Chinese in this respect resembles French in a phrase like \"votre fr\u00e8re, j'ai de ses nouvelles,\" etc.\n\nIn narrative speech time is as a rule mentioned first; place, follows and then the subject of the action done. \u79cb\u4e03\u6708\u8f9b\u9149\u53d4\u8001\u5352 ch'in ch'i-y\u00fceh hsing-yu shu-lao-tsui, in the autumn during the seventh month, at Sing-yu, Shu-lao died. Ch'un-ch'i IX, 12, 3.\n\nVII. If two or more words combine to form one part of a sentence they are to be treated syntactically, as one word, (generally a noun), though in their relation to each other they retain their mutual dependence. Thus even a complete sentence may be made dependent of a certain preposition, or be dependent as a genitive of a following word: \u4ee5\u7fa9\u6545 \\(i\\) chi y\u00fc li \\(i\\) ku, by cause of \"their being bound by rule and law.\" This capacity of sentences performing as it were the functions of words, is one of the most important\n\n* China Review, Vol. V, 1877, p. 386.\npeculiarities of the language, and a most powerful agent in the expression of thought, both as regards strength and elegance.\n\nVIII. Sentences frequently close with certain particles having an affirmative, interrogative, etc., force: \u53ef\u4e4e k'o-'hu? potest-ne? licet-ne? \u53ef\u4e5f k'o-yeh, potest (licet) sane.\n\nIX. In other respects the position of words in a sentence is not influenced by its relation as a simple or compound, affirmative, interrogative, imperative, etc., clause.\n\nThe following remarks will be endorsed by many who have been attempting to parse Chinese sentences, especially in modern documentary prose.\n\n\"As a matter of importance in Chinese syntax, we have to mention the frequent suppression of the grammatical subject, in lieu of which, according to circumstances, a personal pronoun has to be supplied. Such sentences, though logically complete (and therefore intelligible), are grammatically incomplete, and many difficulties arise from this contradiction. The words \u4e0d\u6562 pu-kan, not to dare, may, as they stand, be translated as implying the first, second, or third person, singular or plural, or any mood of the verb. The translator who renders them by \"I do not dare,\" or by \"he did not dare,\" or indeed in any other manner, adds some accidental element; he introduces the grammatical relation though it be not contained in the expression. The same remark may be made with regard to the translation of most other grammatical examples considered apart from the context to which they belong.\"\n\nIn the two divisions following the introductory one, Books II. and III., an exhaustive system of Chinese grammar is constructed on a two-fold basis. The author calls it the Analytical and Synthetic system. In the former an attempt is made to construct an organic building by defining the grammatical\n\n* China Review, Vol. V, 1877, p. 387.\nphases of the language, inasmuch as they can be derived from the principles upon which the language is based. These chiefly consist in the rule of position, assisted by auxiliary words the meaning of which is again dependent upon position. The Synthetic system, on the other hand, forming Book III. of the work, may be called the synonymical part of the grammar, inasmuch as it shows what means are at the disposal of the language to express certain ideas.\n\nIt would take us too long to enumerate even the main chapters of these two divisions, the methodical arrangement of which, quite apart from the exhaustive material contained in them, throws considerable light on the scientific study of Chinese. In the Analytical part one chapter treats of the position of words and of auxiliaries; another on the definition of the parts of speech. This latter chapter abounds with new ideas and plausible remarks. The principle explained by Julien as the elasticity of Chinese words is detailed in a really scientific manner. A Chinese word may be used as\n\n(a.) A noun, when it represents either the subject or the object in a sentence;\n\n(b.) A verb, when it represents the predicate,\n\n(c.) An adverb, when it is added as a determinative to either a verb or an adjective;\n\n(d.) An adjective (\"adnominal\" word), when it appears as the attribute of a noun or of a part of speech corresponding to a noun.\n\nAnother chapter of importance is that on \"the division of sentences and clauses,\" including remarks on the use of rhythm, antithesis, and parallelism for purposes of division. The peculiarity of the written language, the absence of all punctuation causes this point to be of the greatest value to those who wish to understand a Chinese text. Quite a number of words which we are accustomed to treat as empty signs (Hs\u00fc-tze) perform indeed no other service than that of dividing sentences. Thus \u4e5f, \u77e3, \u8005, \u7109, etc., are always found at the close of a\nsentence; \u5219, \u53c8, \u51b5, \u6545, \u662f\u4ee5, \u4eca\u8005, etc., are generally placed at the head. I may add that in modern documentary Chinese, many characters may almost be regarded as marks of punctuation. Besides those mentioned by von der Gabelentz, we find as taking the place of quotation marks:\u2014\u4e91\u4e91, \u7b49\u56e0, \u7b49\u7531, etc.; that of a period, all the characters found at the end or at the beginning of a sentence only. The well-known \u67e5 of despatches may in many cases be said to express what printers call a \"new paragraph.\" All the adversative particles such as \u8a00, \u8a00, \u4e0d\u671f, \u4e0d\u6599, \u4f46, \u60df, etc., naturally imply what we would often mark by a comma or a semicolon; this applies also to the words separating the main clause from the bye-clause in conditional, causal, concessive, etc., periods, such as \u5982, \u4ecd, \u518d, \u800c, (after a concessive clause), \u8f14, and others.\n\nToo much stress cannot be laid upon what we may call a special idiom of the Chinese language,\u2014the power of expressing logical divisions by rhythm, antithesis, and parallelism. Rhythm, which in Western languages is confined to the poetical style, plays, in Chinese, a great part even in the prosiest of prose. An ordinary notice, found on the street corners of a city in Fukien, the most trivial communication to the public, reads like a poem on account of the rhythmical arrangement of its characters. Every clause has a fixed number of characters, say four, five, six, or seven, which is an important assistance in the logical division, coinciding, as a matter of course, with grammatical pauses. Rhythm, antithesis, and parallelism are in many cases the only key to open up passages otherwise quite unintelligible. \"By knowing the rules of position,\" says von der Gabelentz, * \"I know what I have to look for at the head, in the middle, and at the close of a sentence. But where can I find the beginning and the end of a sentence? Occasionally certain particles will serve as a\n\n* \"Beitrag zur Geschichte der chinesischen Grammatiken,\" in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, Vol. XXXVII. p. 605.\nguide. But what am I to do, if there are none\u2014which often happens? In such cases I run my eye over the text, not caring how many unknown characters it may contain; I discover here a parallelism, there an antithesis, begin to count the number of characters being followed by the same word, and soon find the key is in my hands. You see, the proceeding is as superficial and formal as possible; the sifting of its material part follows afterwards. But what have I done, then? I have simply discovered the stylistic pattern the author has had before his mind when writing; I am beating the time before knowing the tune.\"\n\nBook III., containing the synthetic system, is mainly built up on the grammatical heads of Western languages, though in a manner widely different from the superficial way in which some writers have attempted to force the Chinese language into the forms of German or French. Unfortunately, such attempts to decline Chinese nouns and to conjugate Chinese verbs (a mistake into which even the great Morrison has fallen in his \"Chinese Grammar,\" the only feeble work he has produced,) has brought the application of a Western method to the study of Chinese into discredit with many. Nevertheless it is, if applied in the general philosophic manner of von der Gabelentz's synthetic system, best adapted to introduce into the secret of Chinese construction all those who have no reason to look back with regret to the grammatical lessons of their college. The terms of Western grammar, it is true, will often mislead by not covering exactly what we wish to say in using them. This is a deficiency which to a small extent applies even to our own languages. The grammatical categories as they were made the basis of our present method of analysing language by the philosophers of the stoic school are in many cases no more than names of accidental phases of the languages. Everybody imagines he has a clear idea of what the term Genitive means, and yet it seems to be only the symbol for some kind of dependency in which one word\nmay be in relation to another; in *amor filii* and *amor dei* we see genitives of two very different kinds, and yet nobody questions the right of the language to express both by the same form. We are therefore quite free to comprise dependence of different kinds, expressed in Chinese by ante-position, as one phase of the language, and to compare this to the Western genitive, because some or most of the relations expressed by it may, in some or all the languages of Europe, be rendered by that case. It is quite natural, apart from the logical necessity which often suggests comparison with our traditional grammar, that the student trained in Western terminology should declare with Julien that \"sans ce langage de convention, il lui serait impossible de traiter, \u00e0 son point de vue, de la Grammaire chinoise.\" Western terminology, it must be admitted, does in many cases fail to describe the real logical relation of certain phases of the Chinese language; but this is a deficiency which, on fathoming the bottom of grammatical philosophy, may be said to be inseparable from the English as from any other Western language. It is, however, a great convenience, and indeed, to us the only handle by which we can get hold of certain idioms. It may be as fictitious and may as much depend on a special standpoint as the terminology of constellations is fictitious with regard to the real position of the stars; but it is quite as necessary to the writer on grammatical subjects as such terms as Orion, Centaurus or Ursa are to the astronomical student.\n\nF.

James Morrison, Esq., President.\n- Rev. W. Muirhead, Jos. Haas, Esq., T. S. Southey, Esq., Hon. Sec. & Treasurer.\n- Max Slevogt, Esq., Hon. Librarian.\n- D. C. Janssen, Esq., Hon. Curator.\n- Thos.

Stripling, Esq.,\n\nThree vacancies occurred in the Council during the year, viz.: Messrs. Vissi\u00e8re, Buttles, and P. G. von M\u00f6llendorff who left Shanghai; these vacancies were filled by Messrs. C. Imbault-Huart, F. Hirth, Ph. D., and K. J. Streich, respectively.\n\n* Re-elected.\nFour General Meetings of the Society were held during the year and the following papers were read:\n\n1.\u201427th January, \"A Report of the third International Congress at Venice,\" by Lieut. Kreitner.\n\n2.\u201431st March, \"Notes on the Geology of the Neighbourhood of Nagasaki,\" by H. B. Guppy, M.B., Surgeon R. N.\n\n31st March, \"On fresh water on sand banks,\" by Capt. F. W. Schulze.\n\n3.\u201429th August, \"The Hoppo Book of 1753,\" by F. Hirth, Ph. D.\n\n4.\u20147th November, \"On Soochow and the neighbouring country, by C. Imbault-Huart.\n\nSeventeen Ordinary Members were elected during the year. Five ordinary members resigned. There were on the list of the Society on the 31st December, 1882, fourteen Honorary, twenty-six Corresponding, and one hundred and thirty-five Ordinary Members.\n\nThe revised Rules were passed at a General Meeting held on the 7th November and came into force forthwith.\n\nThe second part of the Society's Journal for 1881 was issued in March and the first part of the Journal for 1882 in October.\n\nMention was made in last year's Report of a proposal to re-publish the older Journals now out of print; although a considerable number of members subscribed, the work could not have been undertaken, but for the liberality of Sir Robert Hart, Inspector General of Chinese Customs. It is expected the publications will be issued at an early date.\n\nAn appeal made during the course of the year for contributions of articles, was readily responded to by various of the most prominent sinologues. It is to be hoped that this supply will increase and that the learned circles of Peking and Hongkong will not fail to continue to send us the valuable results of their painstaking and highly interesting sinological researches.\nThe report of the Treasurer and a List of the Members are appended.\n\nShanghai, 27th February, 1883.\n\nTreasurer's Report.\n\nTo the President and Council of the\n\nChina Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn accordance with article 20 of the Society's Rules I have now the pleasure of rendering to you an account of the financial condition of the Society.\n\nFrom the enclosed 'Statement of Accounts' it will be seen that on the 1st of January, 1882, the Society was credited with the sum of \u00a3218\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), and that during the year the receipts amounted to \u00a31,050\\(\\frac{6}{10}\\), and consisted of the usual annual subscriptions mentioned in detail on the appended lists, and the income from the sale of Journals. I may mention that \u00a3130\\(\\frac{0}{10}\\) has been received for duplicate volumes of the Chinese Repository sold to the German Legation at Peking.\n\nSubscriptions collected represent the sum of \u00a3780 against \u00a3650 received on the previous year. Taking into consideration the movements and shifting about of resident and non-resident members this is very encouraging, as it shows the interest taken in the welfare of the Society.\n\nAlthough the income has been in excess of former years, yet on the other hand the expenditure has been unusually heavy, amounting as it does to \u00a31,148\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), and of this sum \u00a31,053\\(\\frac{4}{10}\\) has been paid out, showing a balance of \u00a3120\\(\\frac{6}{10}\\) which has been duly lodged in the Hongkong & Shanghai\nBank; but it must be understood that out of this credit balance, the sum of $94.75 has to be deducted in payment of Messrs. Noronha & Sons' outstanding account.\n\nThe cost of printing Reports, circulars &c. has amounted to $133; but perhaps I should explain that the printing of Lieut. Kreitner's paper has been included under this heading, and that we have a sufficient number of copies of the revised rules to supply new members for some years yet to come.\n\nRemittances from the Booksellers, for sale of Journals, have not up to moment, come to hand.\n\nUncollected subscriptions from non-resident members amount to $290.00, but it is not anticipated that these arrears will bring in more than about $150.00.\n\nAfter this date the Society will receive a rent of Tla. 100 per annum from the Shanghai Library.\n\nIn accordance with the revised rules which came into force during the year under review, the institution for Life membership has been introduced.\n\nYour Treasurer has to regret that at the present time none of the paying members have availed themselves of that benefit, which perhaps may be accounted for by the short time that has elapsed since the Rules have been issued.\n\nWith regard to the Museum, the accounts will show a credit balance of $100.25 on 31st December 1882, which sum has been lodged in the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank.\n\nThe receipts have consisted of the usual liberal grants made by the English and French Municipal Councils and of the very acceptable donation of \u00a320 from Mgr. Delaplace.\n\nThe expenditure has been greater than in previous years, chiefly in consequence of higher wages paid to the Taxidermist.\n\nDuring the month of February the Council have decided to increase his salary to $10.00 a month, provided that he devotes the whole of his time solely for the benefit of the institute: heretofore the Taxidermist had been allowed the privilege of undertaking outside work.\nThe Treasurer has to regret that he has been unable to pay interest on the money borrowed from the Committee of the Recreation Fund in 1875, but it is hoped the funds will admit of interest being paid at the end of the present year.\n\nI am, Gentlemen,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nT.

B. Drew, Esq., President.\nJos. Haas, Esq.,\nF. Hirth, Esq., Ph. D. \\{ Vice-Presidents.\nT. S. Southey, Esq., Hon. Sec. and Treasurer.\nE. Robinson, Esq., Hon. Librarian.\nH. L. Smith, Esq., M.D., Hon. Curator of Museum.\nG. James Morrison, Esq.,\nTho. W. Kingsmill, Esq.,\nM. Slevogt, Esq.,\nC. Deighton-Braysher, Esq., \\{ Councillors.\n\nDuring the month of November, Dr. H. L. Smith resigned the curatorship of the Museum, owing to his departure from Shanghai; the vacancy was filled by Mr. J. W. Wilson.\n\nSix general meetings of the Society were held during the year, and the following papers were read:\n\n1.\u20149th January, \"What did the Ancient Chinese know about Rome and Greece?\" By Dr. J. Edkins.\n\n2.\u201427th February, \"A Corean Manuscript of the 17th Century, relating to the manners and customs of that Country.\" Translated by Monsieur F. Scherzer.\n3.\u201417th April, \"Researches into the Physical Geography and Geology of Formosa.\" By Mr. G. H. J. Kleinw\u00e4chter.\n\n4.\u20148th November, \"The Relative Claims of Buddhism and Confucianism to be considered the Religion of China, and the number of Buddhists in the World.\" By the Rev. A. P. Happen, D.D.\n\n5.\u201422nd November, \"Some Notes of a trip to Corea in July and August, 1883.\" By Mr. G. James Morrison.\n\n6.\u20143rd December, \"Notes on a recent journey to Szechuen, and on the leading geological features of the Yangtse Valley.\" By Mr. A. J. Little.\n\nOne corresponding member, and nine ordinary members were elected during the year; six members resigned.\n\nThere were on the list of the Society on the 31st December 1883, 14 honorary, 27 corresponding, and 138 ordinary members.\n\nThe Council regret having to record the death of two members, viz: Mr. A. Sim who died at Shanghai on the 18th January, and Mr. E. P. Hague who died at Cannes on the 8th December.\n\nIt is worthy of note that the meetings of 1883 were better attended, and greater interest evinced in the papers that were read than has been the case for some time past.\n\nOf the three volumes to be re-printed, one is completed and will be sent out to subscribers and exchanges immediately. The re-printing of the remaining two volumes has not yet been commenced, as the printers were fully occupied with the Journal for 1883, but the Council are now endeavouring to make such arrangements as will enable them to complete at an early date the re-publication of the two volumes out of print, without interference with the publication of the annual volumes. The Council have to apologise for the late appearance of the Report for 1882, which is now ready for distribution. The first part of the Journal for 1883 is nearly completed and\nthe Council are glad to report that they have sufficient papers in hand to commence at once with the printing of the Journal.\n\nSubjoined are the Treasurer's, and the Librarian's Reports.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9.\u2014A Report by the Curator, prepared in September 1884, will also be found subjoined to the reports named above.\u2014Editorial Committee.\nTreasurer's Report.\n\nTo the President and Council of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have much pleasure in rendering an account of the financial condition of the Society for the year 1883 now ended.\n\nFrom the enclosed \"Statement of Receipts and Expenditure,\" it will be seen that on the 1st January 1883, the Society was credited with the sum of $120.66, and that during the year the receipts amounted to $861.29, and were derived from the usual annual subscriptions, sale of Journals, rent from the Shanghai Library, etc. The expenditure amounted to $723.52; and the balance added to the amount brought over from last account leaves the sum of $258.43 in favor of the Society on the 31st December 1883.\n\nI may mention that under the heading \"Expenditure\" the sum of $94.70, paid to Messrs. Noronha & Sons for printing, stood over from last year's account, and that $96.41 have been paid out in repairs to the premises.\n\nThe cost of re-printing Journal Vol. V., of 1868, which amounted to $379.60 is a large item in the expenditure, but a portion of this sum will be refunded later on or as soon as the Hon. Librarian has collected the subscriptions for re-printing those journals now out of print.\n\nWith regard to the Museum, the accounts will show that the sum of $106.62 stands to its credit on the 31st December 1883. I regret that the funds have admitted of only one year's interest on the loan borrowed from the Recreation Fund being paid, as the interest to date is still three years in arrears.\n\nI am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant,\n\nT.

KINGSMILL.\n\nSHANGHAI, 31st January 1884.\nLibrarian's Report.\n\nTo the President and Council of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThere has been little to call for remark in the position of the Library during the year 1883. I regret that I have not found it possible to continue the work of indexing, ably begun by my predecessor Mr. Max Slevogt.\n\nDuring 1883 the following Societies have entered into correspondence with this one on the terms of interchange of publications:\n\n1.\u2014The \"Ornithologischer Verein in Wien.\" Address: Gustavus von Hayek, M. A., Ph. D., 1st Secretary Vienna, Marokkanergasse, 3.\n\n2.\u2014The \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00c9tudes Indo-Chinoises de Saigon.\"\n\n3.\u2014The \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie de Rochefort.\"\n\nThe Journal of the Society is printed to the end of 1882, being volume XVII; volume XVIII (1883) is half finished, and will probably be published before May 1st, while the materials for volume XIX (1884) are well in hand.\n\nEd. ROBINSON,\nHon. Librarian for 1883.\n\nShanghai, March 14th 1884.\nCurator's Report.\n\nTo the President and Council of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThe last Report was published in 1882, but I am unable to carry it on from that date, having only assumed charge of the Museum in February last. During the present year our collection has not been increased to any great extent, but we have to thank numerous friends for sundry contributions, among which may be mentioned as of special interest some large snakes, including a Cobra from Wenchow presented by Count D'Arnoux, and also a small Alligator from Wuhu, now alive at the Museum, presented by Mr. B. C. G. Scott.\n\nA full account of this interesting reptile, the *Alligator Sinensis*, will be found in a former number of this Journal, published in 1878, Vol. XIII, p. 1.\n\nAbout half a dozen new species of birds have been added, and also a specimen of the rare Michie's Deer (*Lophotragus Michianus*) from Ningpo.\n\nThe collection of birds, I regret to say, I found in a far from satisfactory condition, many of them being in a hopelessly dilapidated state; in this climate skins require constant care and attention to preserve them from the attacks of insects and damp, and without such care they speedily become ragged and unsightly objects of no interest or value.\n\nMost of the spare skins were in such a state as to be perfectly useless, and it was necessary to throw them away: but\n\n---\n\n1.\u2014This report, it will be observed, was made at a later date than those which precede it in the present volume; it is published here, however, to afford readers of the Journal the latest information possible respecting the condition and needs of the Museum.\u2014Editorial Committee.\narrangements have now been made to keep all such in tightly closed boxes, where they may safely remain any length of time, besides which they are all dressed with a special preservative which infallibly protects them from the attacks of moths.\n\nAmong the specimens exhibited in the cases a gradual process of renewal is being carried out, and all old and poorly mounted skins are being replaced by others as opportunity offers; some 70 have thus been changed, and during the coming winter it is hoped that all the commoner kinds may be renewed. A careful revision of the names has also been made, and each specimen labelled. A list is annexed, which though subject to modification will I trust be found in the main correct; it is intended to form the basis of a full and detailed catalogue, and in the meantime will serve to point out not only what species we possess, but also those which we still lack.\n\nThe arrangement of the species is based upon the order followed by the Zoological Society of London in its latest published catalogue.\n\nThe collection, in which something over three hundred species appear, is undoubtedly of much value, and contains many good specimens; the group of Game Birds is of great interest, that of the Herons is almost perfect, and the Wild-fowl and Birds of Prey are also well represented,\u2014but there is a marked lack of warblers and other small birds, which, not coming under the head of sport, are seldom shot and presented.\n\nIt will be seen that we have already the nucleus of what might become the most valuable collection of the birds of this country that exists; and it is hoped that members of this society may be induced to lend their assistance in rendering it as complete as possible.\n\nResidents at many of the outports have frequent opportunities of securing local birds which never visit the Shanghai district, and doubtless if this were brought under their notice they would be glad to forward specimens of such for the benefit of the Museum.\nThe main difficulty of course lies in having the specimens sufficiently well skinned to be of any use for mounting; many skins have been received in a state which renders them perfectly useless, owing to the flesh not having been thoroughly removed.\n\nChinese taxidermy is of a very primitive nature, but anyone who understands the work himself can readily teach a native to skin birds as neatly as possible; in the case of birds sent from ports within a few days of Shanghai during the winter it would be unnecessary to have the skins removed, so long as they were exposed to the air and kept in shade; they should be hung up by the legs, and the very simple precaution taken of stuffing the mouth with wool, tow, or something soft, to prevent blood soiling the feathers; if possible, a little white dust such as powdered chalk or plaster of Paris, should be placed in the mouth and nostrils and on any wounds.\n\nIn conclusion I cannot do better than echo the words of a former Curator,\u2014\u201cWe want everything, Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, in fact every description of the Natural History of this country.\u201d The commonest kinds will be gratefully received, and it should be remembered that no Museum should be without a large supply of duplicates, and that such duplicates are always open to inspection by visitors, who wish to make use of them for comparison or study.\n\nF.

There is little doubt though he has said this, that Dr. Bretschneider will consent to the opinion that the two great historical writers of the Han dynasty, that of Si-ma-chien and that of Pan-ku, have conferred an unfading glory on the Chinese scholarship of that period. These authors did the best they could with the knowledge they had, and we Europeans can now reap the benefit to be derived from the study of their works, although they contain inexact descriptions.\n\n* Read before the Society on the 9th January, 1883.\nOne name by which the Roman empire was known was Ta T'sin \u5927\u79e6. The reason is said to be that the inhabitants of that empire resembled the Chinese in stature, erectness and upright conduct.\n\nMay there not be another reason for this name? The Chinese may have compared the Tsin dynasty with the Romans on account of the rapidity and success of their military expeditions, and the fact that they subjugated all the surrounding kingdoms. The name first occurs in the Hou-han-shu, the work of Fan-ye, himself an author of the fifth century. It is found only in the histories written after the time of Pan-ku, the historian of the early Han dynasty, and the brother of Pan-c'hau who subdued Turkestan. But this may be regarded as a reason for thinking that, it was the Buddhists who entered from China to teach their religion that gave the Romans this name. It was in the time of Nero A.D. 64, that they first entered China coming from Afghanistan, then called the country of the Getae. When in the reigns of Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus the next Buddhists are mentioned, it was from Afghanistan and Parthia that they came, remaining in China from A.D. 147 till about A.D. 180. The embassy from Marcus Aurelius arrived A.D. 166 by Canton. In the biography of the earliest of the Parthian missionaries it is said that he went to Canton. He was also an excellent translator on account of his good knowledge of the Chinese language. We may conclude then that the name Ta-t'sin \u5927\u79e6 for Rome was adopted through the Buddhists, and that the reason of its adoption is to be found probably in some national designation for Rome, in some language current at that time in Afghanistan and India.\n\nReferring to the earlier accounts, Rome can only be detected under the name \u9ece\u8ed2 Li-kan. In the Shih-chi we are told under the heading Parthia (called there \u5b89\u606f an sik or as pronounced at Shanghai Ersik, the Arsacidae) that west of Parthia lay Syria \u689d\u679d Dio-ti, and north of Parthia lay the Alans and the country of Likan. Fan-ye identifies Likan with Rome. The Shih-ki was written about B.C. 95, before\nthe Romans under Pompey conquered Syria, which was in B.C. 65, while Greece was divided into Roman provinces about B.C. 146, so that in the time of the Sh\u012b-ki the powerful nations of the west were Parthia, Syria, Rome and Egypt. The author knew of all these except Egypt, and he designated them by names current in Afghanistan and Bactria at the time. Unfortunately we do not know the name by which the Parthians called the Romans. If we did we might get light on the origin of the term Li-kan. We may speculate on its resemblance to the word regnum, or Hellenikon or some other word, but with no very satisfactory result. We need more knowledge of names current after the time of Alexander the Great in Persia and India before we can determine this point. Before the Chinese made their way to the countries known as Bactria and Sogdiana, the Greeks under Alexander had gone there and left behind them flourishing colonies, which had existed through revolutions, wars and intervals of peace for nearly two centuries.\n\nThe conquest of Bactria and Sogdiana by Alexander the Great, B.C. 328, was followed after sixteen years by the consolidation of the kingdom of the Seleucidae. Bactria was the most distant province of that empire and remained so for about sixty years. At this time the last Cheu emperors were reigning feebly. The time was not favourable for foreign intercourse, or the Chinese and the Greeks might have learned to respect one another as having at about the same time a school of political philosophy and morals, and a literature of history and poetry.\n\nAfter sixty years the eastern dependencies of the Syrian Kingdom were snatched away by insurgent chiefs. The kingdom of Ansi, or Arsic, as the Chinese name was probably pronounced nineteen centuries ago, appeared in the history of the western nations as Parthia. Bactria was left in peace by Arsaces, and the presence there of Greek colonies, flourishing through the fineness and fertility of the climate and soil, had a little before rendered it possible for Deodotus to change the title and position of a satrap under the Seleucidae into that of an independent king. His son made a treaty with Tiridates,\nking of Parthia, and joined him in fighting against Syria. He began to reign about B.C. 250, others say B.C. 255.\u2014See Bayer, Historia Regni Graecorum Bactriani.\n\nEuthydemus, a native of Magnesia, effected a revolution in the Bactrian kingdom B.C. 220 and became king. He caused Greek coins to be cast for use in his kingdom as had been done before by the dynasty of Diodotus. After eleven years Antiochus, the great king of Syria, came eastward with an army to reconquer his old possessions and destroy the new kingdoms, Parthia and Bactria, which had sprung up there. He defeated Euthydemus in battle at the river Arius, in the year B.C. 207, a peace was soon made on the submission of Euthydemus, who pleaded that Antiochus would do well to leave him the title of king, because he was surrounded by powerful tribes, who would respect him the more on account of it. Antiochus gave one of his daughters in marriage to the son of Euthydemus. A treaty of alliance was made, and in the invasion of India by Antiochus he was helped by the king of Bactria.\n\nThe capital of Bactria was Zariaspa, a city on the Oxus.\n\nEuthydemus died B.C. 196 and was succeeded by Menander, who conquered the Penjaub and called himself on his coins king of India and Bactria. He was therefore a powerful king. In the year B.C. 181 he was followed by Eucratides. The kingdom of Parthia was now increasing in size, and B.C. 152 Mithridates, king of that country, added to his possessions Media, Hyrcania and Elymais. In conquering Hyrcania, which is on the south-east of the Caspian sea, he became a more dangerous neighbour than before to the Bactrians and the Dahae. Coins of Eucratides of the date B.C. 148 have been found, eight years earlier than the visit of the Chinese traveller Chang-c'hi'en to Bactria, when China obtained her first knowledge of the Greeks. On the coins which have been found on both sides of the Paropamisus, the mountain chain which separates the waters of the rivers Indus and Oxus, this king is called Eucratides the Great. Bayer believed that he was succeeded by his son Eucratides the second, but this view is contested. According to Wilson Eucratides was succeeded by his son Heliocles. Coins have been found with Greek and\nArian inscriptions associating the two names in the sovereignty.\n\nThe Greek Bactrian kingdom was destroyed B.C. 127, thirteen years after the visit of Chang-ch'ien and twenty-six years before the successful war waged by the Chinese against the native dynasty, which followed the Greek.\n\nThe Chinese name for the country in Si-ma-t'sien and Pan-ku is \u5927\u5b9b Ta-wan. The prefix ta \"great\" is not properly part of the name. The word is then Wan, and this is probably the Indian Yavan, the name for the Greeks, borrowed by the Hindoos from the Persians. From the time of Alexander and during the reigns of the Seleucidae, the Greeks are known to the Indians by no other name than Yavana. The v in this word is w, and the sound agrees accurately enough with that of the Chinese so far as we know it, which was probably Yon. The modern Persian taken from the Arabic is Yunan. The Hebrew in Zechariah IX, 13, \"when I have raised up thy sons O Zion, against thy sons O Greece\" is yawan agreeing exactly with the Sanscrit.\n\nAmong the reasons for identifying Bactria with Ta-wan are the customs of the people as described by the Chinese. For example Chang-ch'ien found in Bactria the art of wine-making from grapes flourishing, and says that the rich men of the country stored it to the extent of thousands of piculs. After being kept for several tens of years it was still good. They also paid unusual honour to women, consulted them in important matters and adopted their views.\n\nThe Ta-wan country was so important that the historian gave all his information respecting western countries under this name. In the work of Si-ma-c'hi'en* it is the heading of the entire section which treats of western countries. This historian would not have classed all western countries under this title, if Chang-ch'ien and Li-kwang-li had not in their accounts described Ta-wan as specially interesting and important.\n\n* Si-ma-t'sien died about B.C. 85. Li-kwang-li conquered Ta-wan B.C. 101. Mayers identifies Ta-wan with Ferghana, de Guignes with Sogdiana. Perhaps both of these authors mean Kho-kand. Remusat makes Ta-wan, Ferghana. The city of Kho-kand is 200 miles N.E. of Sa-mar-kand, Ferghana is the N.E. neighbour to Bochara.\nIn the identification of ancient Chinese names of countries, the names themselves ought to be well considered. For example when the country of the Dahae is called Ta-hia it should be well weighed whether the characters \u5927\u590f were not formerly called Da-hae. The use of one national designation for a race or kingdom is more common than the use of two. Many races have two names, but there are not a few instances where one principal name is predominant in usage over any other.\n\nBy examining the ancient sounds of Chinese characters we may identify old names with much more confidence than otherwise. The name Ta-yue-shi \u5927\u6708\u6c0f for the Massagetae does not, when spelled in this way, suggest the western name as known to the Greeks. But, if we adopt the sound Get-ti which we are obliged by correct reading of the Chinese old sounds to do, we arrive at an orthography which may well inspire us with some hope, that other names may also, when carefully reduced to a self consistent orthography, be proved to be identical in ancient China and in ancient European geographers.\n\nWhen Alexander the Great, in B.C. 328, followed in the footsteps of the fugitive Darius, he found the Da-hae living in the reign known as Hyrcania on the south-east of the Caspian sea. He crossed with his army the first home of the Parthian empire, and the provinces of Aria and Drangiana to the modern Ilerat, then called Arachosia. From this point turning northwards he crossed the Hindoo Coosh mountains, then called Paropamisus, into Bactria. The Bactriani are called by Quintus Curtius a very warlike race. Their capital Zariaspa was situated on the Oxus.\n\nThe Oxus then flowed into the Caspian and was much used for navigation. Now it is an affluent of the Aral lake. It is called in old Chinese accounts the \u5a01\u6c34, Kwei-shui. In Wei-yuen's map, prefixed to Lin-tse-s\u00fc's geography, the Oxus is so named.\n\nIn the year B.C. 162 the Massagetae were then living at Tun-hwang on the east of Lake Lob. The Hiung Nu Turks attacked them and killed their king. They then left for a\nmore western residence, and we hear of them between the Dahae and the nation called Kang-ku.\n\nThe road, by which the Chinese diplomatic agent Chang-c'hien reached the country of the Dahae, is described by S\u012b-ma-t'sien as circuitous. He went to Ta-wan first; thence to the country of the Kang-ku nation; from this point to the Massagetae, and from them to the Dahae.\n\nThe position of the Dahae is known. They were a peaceful trading race on the shores of the Caspian. Kang-ku is placed by Remusat and Klaproth in Sogdiana. Wei-yuen places it far north in the Kirgis country.\n\nIt may well be doubted if Ta-wan was Sogdiana, because in the later Han history the So-ku kingdom, which from the sound should be Sogdiana, was at war with Ta-wan, which may surely in that case have been Bactria. This point however is less important because Sogdiana was a Greek province in earlier times.\n\nChang-c'hien therefore will have gone by the southern route to Bactria (Ta-wan) and then to Sogdiana at that time occupied by the Kang-ku race. From thence he went south across the Oxus, which at that time flowed into the Caspian and would support a population on its banks, whom I suppose to have been the Massagetae. The Kang-ku king had a winter residence at Pidan, which was the chief city of the Lakinik country. As this was due west of the Chinese residency and 5550 li distant, I suppose it to be in Sogdiana. The Chinese Viceroy's residence would be in Ili.\n\nThe Massagetae shortly before the time of Christ removed to the south side of the Oxus, as shown in Wei-yuen's map, and remained there during the Wei period. This would be possibly on account of the unruly action of the Oxus, destined afterwards to flow to the Aral Sea, causing dryness in the soil or destructive floods and rendering the country unproductive.\n\nFrom the Massagetae Chang-c'hien arrived among the Dahae and staid there more than a year. He had lived ten years with the Hiung-nu and therefore was familiar with\nTurkish. In this new region he would probably also learn Persian, which would be necessary for the commercial transactions of the Dahae with India, a part of the produce of which passed by the Oxus into the Caspian.\n\nAs the Massagetae, a century afterwards, conquered the Penjaub, their language would affect somewhat the formation of the Penjaubi language. The Massagetae became then more powerful than they had ever been. In the Fa-yuen-chu-lin they are named among the three most flourishing races in the world, the others being China and Rome.\n\nOn account of the word Massa being rendered \"Great\" in the Chinese name I suppose the language to be Indo-European. But common consent calls them Scythians according to the usage of the early classical authors, who described the Massagetae as being like the Scythians. Remusat thinks they are the Goths.*\n\nThe Massagetae, B.C. 529, lived north of the Araxes on the western shores of the Caspian sea. For it was in that year that they killed Cyrus in battle. Queen Tomuris sought his body on the battle field, had his head cut off and placed it in a skin filled with human blood in order to shew her indignation for his love of conquest and wholesale destruction of human life.\n\nAt the time of the expedition of Alexander the Massagetae are mentioned as a tribe in the Chorasmian region, which is on the east of Sogdiana and south of the Aral sea. It is said of them that they were always ready to make war when they saw a prospect of plunder. They caused trouble to Alexander while he was in Bactria, by attacking his garrisons and some detached bodies of his cavalry.\n\nThis was previous to the time when the Massagetae, east of Lake Lob, moved westward. The Chinese accounts, in saying that the Massagetae went to the country of the Dahae, omit mentioning the fact that they had tribes of their own nation residing close. This would permit them with a reason for seeking a home in that region, and a junction with kindred clans would strengthen them greatly, found as they are, on the\n\n* Foe Koue Ki, p. 78.\neast and west of the Caspian and on the east and west of Lake Lob, they occupied portions of a tract of country embracing nearly 50 degrees of Longitude and, if we include the Getae of Thrace, a much larger area.\n\nThe Chinese account may be used to correct Malte Brun's view respecting the Oxus. He argues in his 34th Book that Strabo and Pliny were wrong in saying that the Oxus flowed into the Caspian. Remarkably enough the Han history shows that Strabo and Pliny were right. This appears from the fact that there is no difference of opinion about the position of the Dahae, who however are found south of the Oxus in the Chinese account and at the same time on the shores of the Caspian. Strabo and Pliny then were right.\n\nThe physical description of the Ta-wan people ought to be considered by us, when we wish to determine the question if they were Greeks. They had, say the ancient Chinese, deep eyes and much beard and whisker. That description will suit almost any Indo-European or Semitic race. It will therefore suit the Greeks or the Persians.\n\nThe Persian occupation of Bactria, which lasted for about two centuries, must have caused many Persians to settle there permanently. The Persian and Greek element together have given an Indo-European aspect to a portion of the people, which has never been since lost.\n\nAlexander's efforts were still more definitely fixed on colonization than the Persian kings had ever been. He founded many cities and left a very considerable number of colonists in Bactria and Sogliana.\n\nQuintus Curtius tells a sad story of the fate of a Greek colony, which dated from the time of Xerxes. The Milesians, called Branchidae, in charge of a certain rich temple, had, at the period of the invasion of Greece by Xerxes, taken the spoils of the temple and given them to Xerxes. This was in the eyes of Greece a crime that could not be forgiven. They were transferred by Xerxes from Miletus to Bactria. Alexander passed their town with his army. They joyfully welcomed the Macedonians. A consultation was held as to what\nshould be done with them. The result was a merciless slaughter of the whole colony by command of Alexander.\n\nThus we learn that Persia had planted in that fruitful and inviting region, not only settlements of her own people but even of the more distant Greeks.\n\nAlexander during his stay, extending over 18 months, left there indelible marks of his genius not only for war but for imprinting on the nations he conquered solid features of the Greek civilization.\n\nIt was by this road that something of the influences of European thought and Greek art penetrated through Chinese Turkestan to China.\n\nIt was in B.C. 106 that the Emperor Han Wu-ti sent an army to take vengeance on Ta-wan for the murder of a Chinese Ambassador, despatched by him a short time previously.\n\nLi-kwang-li was the general who was sent. He failed to conquer Ta-wan and returned with only two-tenths of his army. His expedition had met with nothing but disaster, the cities on the way had been closed against him, and provisions denied him. When he reached Ta-wan, he was unable with the feeble remnant of his army to cope with the forces that met him, he sustained a severe defeat and returned. The Chinese emperor withheld his permission for him to enter China, and refused his consent to the abandonment of the enterprise. In the year B.C. 101 he went again at the head of a large army. The chief people of Ta-wan killed their king Muko, and submitted to superior force. The expedition was successful.\n\nThe chief people of the state appear to have had at that time a greater power than the king, and the government would seem to have been in part aristocratic.\n\nThough Ta-wan, when conquered, was no longer the Greek kingdom founded by Diodotus, it was not long after the close of the Greek rule that the Chinese army was there. The Chinese may in conquering Ta-wan have had to do with many Greeks remaining from the Bactrian kingdom, subverted twenty years before.\n\nPan-ku tells us that the Massagetae had for their capital\nthe city Lamti, which was distant from the Chinese metropolis 11,600 li. They had 100,000 soldiers. In the Sh\u012b-ki, this city is called Lam-ji \u84dd\u5e02, and is said to be the capital of the Dahae.\n\nIn Bayer's history of the Greek kingdom of Bactria the dates of the accession and death of the successive kings are given in the following manner:\u2014Diodotus B.C. 255 to 243, Diodotus the younger B.C. 243 to 220, Enthydemus of Magnesia, B.C. 220 to 196, Menander king of India and Bactria, B.C. 196 to 181, Eucratides B.C. 181 to 146, Eucratides the younger B.C. 146 to 134. This last should be Heliocles.\n\nBayer gives the impression of a coin of Eucratides, B.C. 148, and another of Diodotus of unknown date.\n\nSogdiana and Bactria both belonged to the Greeks for a time. They divided these countries into satrapies. Sogdiana is described by Strabo as lying between the Oxus and Jaxartes. The latter river separated it from the Nomades or Scythians, with whom Alexander fought a successful battle. Some old writers speak of Sogdiana and Bactria as separate provinces of one country, which was regularly settled and cultivated as far as the river Jaxartes, now called by the Persians the Sihun. Ptolemy speaks of the Chorasmian country lying between Sogdiana and the Caspian as also belonging to Bactria.\n\nOn the east Sogdiana was bounded by the high grounds, which formed the source of the Jaxartes, and which were occupied by the Sacai, who are called Sak by the Chinese. Beyond them to the east, across the mountains, Ptolemy places the Seres in the country, where Yarkand is now the chief city. By the Seres he means the Chinese, then as now masters of that country.\n\nSogdiana was the modern Bokhara. Khokand was then occupied by the Sakai, Khiva was then the country of the Chorasmians. Kunduz was Bactria with Tocharistan on the east.\n\nThese identifications are not exact, but they are an approximation to the truth.\nBayer has discussed the geography of this whole region with minute particularity, paying careful attention to all that the ancient geographers have said. But he has scholarship without eloquence, and he has not attempted to draw, even in a single instance, a vivid picture in light and shade of the long departed past. Yet he calls his book a history.\n\nYet his book is most valuable as possessing quotations from a great variety of authors, who wrote respecting the affairs of Asia in the time of Alexander and his successors.\n\nI place here the following facts from this book. The country of the Dahae, among whom the Chinese Ambassador Chang-c'hien lived for more than a year, reached that of the Bactrians and the Chorasmians on the east and north, while it stretched to the Caspian on the west.\n\nArsaces, the founder of the Parthian Empire, lived in early life among the Dahae, and belonged to some nomade tribe. He is called a Scythian. In his wars with Seleucus he was partly held in check by the military power of the Bactrian king, Diodotus. With the help of Diodotus a few years later he was victor in a battle fought with Seleucus.\n\nDiodotus was succeeded by his son of the same name B.C. 243. During his reign extending to B.C. 220 there were three Greek kingdoms in Western Asia\u2014Bactria, Syria, and Pergamos. Pergamos in Asia Minor did not hold its place very long as a powerful state. Syria I suppose to be the Chinese Tiau-chi, as Bactria was Ta-wan, and Parthia, An-sik.\n\nThe Chinese accounts of the coinage of Parthia say that it bore the king's countenance on its face: on the back was the face of a woman. In the history of Fan-ye, the capital of Parthia, is stated to have been \u548c \u69cd Ho-tu, old sound Wadok. This should be the city Artacoana. It is said to be 25,000 li distant from Loyang. This city was also called Aria. It was the chief town of the province of Aria, and lay about 360 English miles to the south-east of the Caspian southern shore. In the year A.D. 87, Parthia sent an embassy to China with a present of lions and an animal called Bubat without horns. In A.D. 97, the governor-general of the Turkish provinces of China, Pan-c'chau, sent Kan-ying on\nan embassy to Rome. He arrived at the great sea in the territory of Syria, but the sailors of the west border of Parthia, which we must suppose to be the Persian gulf, told the Chinese envoy that the sea was wide and would require three months with a fair wind to cross it. With adverse winds sometimes two years were required. On this account sailors on leaving provided grain for three years, so long a voyage made people think of home and not a few died on the way. Kan-ying hearing this concluded not to proceed.\n\nThis conversation I suppose to have taken place on the shore of the Mediterranean. But it may have been on the Persian gulf. The Chinese text is ambiguous.\n\nIn the year A.D. 101, the Parthian king Pacorus, known as Arsaces the 24th, sent an embassy to China. He is called \u6f22\u5c48 Mank'ut. The letter t was probably then pronounced when final as r. He sent lions and a great bird from Syria, probably the Ostrich. The name \"bird of Parthia\" was given to it from this time forward. From Parthia travelling 3,400 li west you come to Aman. From Aman proceeding west for 3,600 li you arrive at the kingdom of Si-pin. Here, if you go south and cross the river, you reach the kingdom of Ula after travelling 960 li. Here you are at the extreme limit of Parthia. From this proceeding south by sea you can go to the Roman empire, a country abounding with remarkable and valuable productions.\n\nThe historian says of Rome that the empire contained more than 400 cities, and had several tens of subject kingdoms. City walls were built of stone. The post houses on the roads were plastered with lime. He describes the precious stones, woven fabrics and silver and gold coinage. He also mentions that trade is carried on by Rome with Parthia and India by sea. The intervention of Parthia prevented intercourse till the year A.D. 166, when an embassy from Marcus Aurelius Antoninus* penetrated to China by way of Cochinchina with presents of tortoise-shell, ivory and rhinoceros horn. This probably meant that the embassy arrived by way of Can-\n\n* Antoninus is written \u5b89\u6566 An-ton.\nton. At that time Cochinchina was a part of China. The same historian in his account of India mentions the trade that existed between India and the Roman Empire, and the import into the ports of India of valuable articles from that Empire. In the reign of the Emperor Ho-ti, A.D. 84 to 106, many embassies were sent to China by the land route. But, when the Turkish provinces of China revolted, travelling by this route was stopped. In the year A.D. 159 and subsequently, embassies from India came by the China sea. About A.D. 222 a Roman called Tsin-lun arrived at Nanking, and there saw the Wu Emperor Sun-c'hiuen, the same who figures conspicuously as a general in the \"Three kingdoms.\" Later in the third century, about A.D. 285, a third Roman embassy came. This may have been from Diocletian or from his predecessor. The former in 222 might be from the Emperor Alexander Severus or from Heliogabalus.\n\nThe information obtained by the Chinese respecting the Roman empire was chiefly from the Buddhists, who came to Loyang in the first, second and third centuries.\n\nThe embassies came by sea, and the trade in the Indian seas for the supply of civilized Europe with Oriental products, carried on by the Persian gulf and the Red sea, was not small. The Buddhist missionaries came from the Penjaub, Afghanistan and Parthia to China. Ships from the city of Berenice (the modern Suez) came then to the mouths of the Indus, and carried on trade there at the Buddhist island of Pattala, the sacred home of Kwan-yin, an antitype of the Chinese Puto in the Chu-san Archipelago. From this point the Egyptian ships proceeded to the Malabar coast and the pearl fisheries of Ceylon to obtain the products of those regions. Of all articles of commerce the Romans valued pearls the most. But India also sent to Europe silks and other textile fabrics, as well as precious stones, and the pepper and spices, for which she has always been famous. The Buddhists spoke the language of the Penjaub and the Pali of the region watered by the Ganges. They also had among them speakers of Persian, at least this was probably the tongue with which the Parthian missionaries were most familiar. It was in A.D. 64 that T'sai-an and\nT'sin-king were sent to India to bring Buddhist books and teachers to China. They met in Afghanistan (country of the Getae) with Kashiapmadanga and took him back with them. In him and his companion Chu-fa-lan they had translators, who could tell the Chinese statesmen what they knew of western countries. A native of Afghanistan lived at Loyang translating from the year 147 to 186, and another translator, a native of Parthia, a prince of the royal family of the Arsacidae, was in China from A.D. 148 to A.D. 170. He could not fail to know much of Rome and western Asia, and what he knew he would tell. His name was An-shi-kau. Another Parthian, named Ubaso Kan-yon, was at Loyang from A.D. 168 to 190, and was also a translator. These foreign translators were followed by others during the decline of the Han dynasty to about the year A.D. 207.\n\nAfter the establishment of the three kingdoms, Hindoo and other foreign Buddhists resided at Loyang under the dynasty of T'sau-t'sau. Contemporaneous with them there was at Nanking, under the patronage of Sun-c'hiuen's dynasty, a still more numerous band, attracted there by the flourishing condition of Buddhism in the country, of which Nanking and Sucheu were the chief cities. During 60 years about 190 Buddhist books were translated there by five foreign translators. One of these had come to China near to the close of the Han dynasty with a colony of several hundred persons from the country of the Getae (Afghanistan etc.,) and had grown up with a familiar knowledge of the language of China as well as his own. He studied Chinese at ten years of age and Sanscrit at 13. He knew in all six languages. At the time when the Han dynasty was falling, he took his departure with several tens of his countrymen, and went from Loyang to the Nanking country. He translated into Tibetan as well as into Chinese, at least his knowledge of the Yung language is mentioned as a qualification for his duties. Enough has been said to show that the knowledge of the western world, acquired during the Han dynasty and the three kingdoms, B.C. 140 to A.D. 260, by the Chinese was derived in the first instance by their own people, when they had travelled far enough to learn\nforeign languages sufficiently well to obtain information respecting important geographical facts. This knowledge was greatly increased, when missionaries from the Ganges, the Penjaub, the Parthian kingdom and countries near came to China to teach Buddhism. It was by means of these men that several embassies by sea, arriving from Europe at Canton during the period mentioned, were able to hold intelligible communication with the Chinese court at Loyang and at Nanking.\n\n---\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT.\n\n(Reprinted from the \"North-China Herald\" of the 14th March, 1883.)\n\nTo the Editor of the\n\n\"North-China Daily News.\"\n\nSir,\u2014To what was said in my paper on this subject, read on the 9th January at a meeting of the Asiatic Society, may I add here the following statements?\n\nConsiderable difficulty has been felt by investigators in identifying places by the number of Chinese miles recorded in the dynastic histories. But much may be learned from them notwithstanding. M. Vivien de St Martin has done the most in this department of inquiry. He finds it safe to take five Chinese li as the equivalent for an English mile in laying down the route of Hiuen Tsang in the Tang dynasty. At that time Ch'ang-an, in 109 degrees east longitude, was the capital. In the early Han period the capital was also there. In the later Han it was removed to Lo-yang, in 112 degrees. In the distances given in the How Han Shu we must therefore subtract about 900 li to make the numbers given harmonize with those of Pan-koo and Si Ma-chien. In the Wei period the capital was in Shansi, at the present Ta-t'ung-fu. This is four degrees east of Si-an, and we must subtract 1,200 li from the distances of the historians mentioned.\nSuch is the principle. But if we proceed to compare the longitudes of places which are known, such as Samercand, Bokhara or Artocoana, one of the old capitals of Parthia, we shall find that even to divide by five in order to find the English miles is not enough. Artacoana, in 61 degrees, was distant from Loyang 25,000 li. The difference in degrees is 51, or 3,600 miles. Eight li to a mile is, then, the rate for the How Han-shu. The route would be that which leads from Kashgar to Badakshan, across the Imaus mountains. In the same way Khoten, with a longitude of 80 degrees, is given as 11,700 li from Loyang, and the quotient is $6\\frac{1}{2}$ li per English mile. The diminution of the quotient is accounted for by the direction of the road, which is generally straight till it turns south when near Kashgar. In the Wei-shu, which gives distances from the new capital, then in northern Shansi, the extent of the journey to the Parthian capital, there called Wei-su, is given as 21,500 li. This city, not yet identified, was the capital of a kingdom which bordered on Persia, and lay to the north-west of the Tochari or Massagetae. The distance, as given in the same history, of the capital of the Massagetae, Lukamti, from the Chinese metropolis, is 14,500 li. It lay to the west of Badakshan, \u5f17\u6575\u6c99, which has the longitude of 70\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees. This yields about six li to the mile. Soon afterwards the Getae removed the capital of their nation to what may be Balkh, in longitude 67. The name is given Bokla, and also looks like Bokhara, which is in 65 degrees, but this is too far to the north, and the account says that the Scythian king moved westward on this occasion a distance of 2,100 li. If the city meant is Balkh, the number of li to the mile is only four. It was this Scythian King who conquered India.\n\nIn the Wei-shu, the capital of the Roman Empire is stated to be Antu. The Wei dynasty lasted from A.D. 386 to 532. Can this city be Byzantium, the seat of the Emperors? Or Antioch the Asiatic capital? Or is it Rome? It is said to be 10,000 li westward across the sea from Syria (Tiau-chi) by a winding route, and no less than 39,400 li from the Chinese metropolis. Taking the difference of longitude at 113, less 29, or eight-four degrees, we obtain a quotient of eight li per mile, supposing the city to be Constantinople. \"The Roman Empire is,\" says the historian, \"called the Ta-t\u2018sin because the people resemble the Chinese in height, upright conduct, clothes, carriages and flags. They have in their country the five cereals, hemp, and the\nmulberry. They tend silkworms and cultivate the ground. On the south-east they have commercial intercourse with China through Cochin China, and by water they also communicate (by the modern Yunnan) through the department of Yung-c'hang in Yi-chow.\"\n\nHow the traders of the Roman Empire communicated with China by way of Yunnan is not stated. It may have been by Birmah, through the site of the modern Bhamo and the river Irawaddi, or it may have been by the Cambodia river, or the S'angkoi, running through Tung-king to the sea. Of these the S'angkoi is the most likely.\n\nThe conquest of Cochin China and of Yunnan was made by the Chinese in the reign of Han Wu-ti, about a century before the Christian era, and cities were then founded in those regions which became trading centres. Here commerce flourished so long as the empire was powerful. It was thus made possible, by means of the S'angkoi, the Cambodia river and the Irawaddi, to have commercial intercourse with the Indian Ocean, and so with Europe. In the Wei-shu we are told that the Roman Empire had intercommunication with China by this route as well as by Cochin China. The city Yung-c'hang is mentioned, and this was the modern Yunnan Fu. We therefore seem to be shut up to the Cambodia river and the S'angkoi. The chief object sought by European traders would be silk robes for the rich inhabitants of western cities, and the reason of these routes being chosen would be that the Canton river was not known at that time to the traders.\n\nThe Golden Chersonese of Ptolemy is believed to be Cambodia. What he calls the Magnus Sinus beyond it may be the China sea. After the victorious expedition into Parthia by Trajan in the second Christian century, the eastern trade of the Roman Empire became more adventurous than before, and merchants travelled farther in the direction of China. They went to Cattigara, which was a port leading to the interior capital of Thinae. Marinus described a voyage from the mouth of the Ganges to the farthest point of Cattigara. The first portion of this voyage was south-west; the second portion was north-west. It may well be supposed therefore that the ship referred to passed the island on which the modern Singapore stands, and reached the mouth of the Cambodia river, and then perhaps the mouth of the S'angkoi, ten degrees farther north on the coast of what was then China. The port he calls Sada would be somewhere near Singapore. Marinus\nalso describes a voyage of twenty days by a navigator named Alexander, from the Chersonese to Zaba, in a northerly direction.\n\nSince the common Buddhist name of China is Chi-na, \u652f\u90a3, the Hindoos in the Birmese peninsula would use this name for China. But the Chinese residents in Cambodia would pronounce it tina, because to this day in Annam the initials s and ch of Chinese words take usually the form t. Hence the name learned by Ptolemy and Marinus was the Sanscrit name of the Chinese, modified by local Chinese pronunciation.\n\nThe Chinese settlements in Cochin-China are described in the after Han history in the following manner. Kiauchi the old Tonquin, had twelve cities under it. The chief city was 11,000 li from Loyang. In one of the cities boats were made by melting copper. The last of the twelve was constituted a city A.D. 43. South of Kiauchi was Cochin, \u4e5d\u771f, at a distance of 11,580 li south of Loyang. Of houses there were 46,513. Of inhabitants there were 209,894. In all there were five cities in the jurisdiction of this department. The southernmost was Jinan (Nitnam). It is 13,400 li distant from Loyang. It was first included in the Chinese Empire in the latter part of the third century before Christ. The department embraced five cities, 18,263 houses, and 100,676 inhabitants. In the neighbourhood of one of the cities, called Luyung, gold was found.\n\nThe distances require us to count about ten li to a mile at sixty to the degree, assuming the road to be straight.\n\nIn the times of Ptolemy, European traders on arriving at the Cambodia river, or in Annam, were already in China, and from the account in the Wei Shu it appears that facilities existed for conveying imports and exports to west China by the Yunnan route, and to central China by that of Annam. By this second route the Roman embassy of A.D. 161 must have come, which reached the Emperor's court on the banks of the Yellow River.\n\nJ. Edkins.\n\nDISCUSSION ON DR. EDKINS'S PAPER.\n\nIn regard to Dr. Edkins's conjecture in respect of the words Li-kan and regnum, Dr. Hirth said that at the time Li-kan (or\nLi-k\u00fcen (Li-giwn?) as the pronunciation is handed down for this name) was used by the Chinese, regnum was a forbidden word with the Romans; no Roman would have dared to speak of regnum after the expulsion of the kings, a period which coincided with the beginning of history in China\u2014the end of the mythological period of the Chow dynasty. Rome was called \"res publica\" at one time, and \"imperium\" later on, but not regnum or kingdom. He thinks the late Mr. Taintor's conjecture, though no more than a guess either, of the name Li-k\u00fcen being connected with the word \"legiones,\" the word which represented the conquering power of the Roman Empire, being more natural. He remarked upon the difficulty of finding copies in Shanghai of the Chinese works required for investigation of the subject treated in Dr. Edkins's paper, such as de Guignes' Histoire des Huns, Pauthier's \"M\u00e9moire sur l'authenticit\u00e9 de l'inscription de Si-ngan-fu,\" and the various Chinese histories, all of which were conspicuous by their absence from the Library of the Asiatic Society and which, though procurable in Chinese book shops would be an expensive article for a private student. The only place where such studies could be made with success was Peking, as had been shown by the able essays on the subject of Dr. Bretschneider. It was therefore altogether very difficult to form an opinion on the identification of the names of countries mentioned in Chinese works. Next to the travels of Marco Polo, he thought the early relations of the Chinese with western countries, were one of the most interesting questions for Europeans in Asia. He then described the method followed by the Chinese historians in treating of western countries; the manner in which their chapters were subdivided, and the grouping of facts connected with the respective countries. He suggested that it would form a very interesting study to take the distances given in Chinese books, and work them out to see if any definite conclusions could be arrived at in the identification of the countries. In every case the Chinese historian gave the distance of the place, in so many thousand li, from the capital of China; in some cases it was given in round numbers, say 10,000 li, and in others they give it more definitely, such as 22,300. To determine the distances, they had to ascertain whether, at the date the historian wrote, the capital of China from which he measured his distances was Si-r gan-fu, Loyang or Nanking; and they would also have to place the capitals of the foreign countries described. The distances were evidently calculated by days' marches, by one or\nother of three overland routes. Then as to the facts stated in Chinese books in reference to foreign countries, they would have to be satisfied if out of a series of 12 facts or statements of products of the country, &c., they could get half a dozen to tally with what was known to be produced in any given country. It was mentioned in some of the ancient Chinese books, that Ta-tsin produced lions; but he did not think lions were produced in Italy.\n\nMr. Haas\u2014Yes.\n\nDr. Hirth\u2014Were they not imported from the African colonies? They were not \"growing wild.\"\n\nMr. Haas\u2014At the time of the Greek colonies, the country was infested with lions.\n\nDr. Hirth thought that no one coming from Rome to China would have mentioned lions as one of the special productions of that country, seeing that on his way to China he would pass through countries where lions were more common.\n\nDr. Hirth concluded his remarks by expressing his high appreciation of Dr. Edkins's paper, which had added some important facts to our information in regard to the Chinese knowledge of western countries especially inasmuch as it had drawn attention to a new source of information from which the Chinese may have derived their knowledge of western countries. Hitherto we believed that the chapters on this subject contained in the various dynastic histories were based on the reports of tribute bearers and special embassies as well as those of Kan-ying, the military explorer who reached the coast of one of the western seas. Dr. Edkins's paper points to the probability of Bactrian, Indian and other \"translators and missionaries\" who were engaged in the translations of Buddhist books at the court of China, having communicated their own knowledge of the west to the Chinese historians in the east.\n\nThe Chairman said, that in considering this question there were two ways which suggested themselves to him of arriving at the connection between China and the West in ancient times\u2014they would have to look at what China said with regard to the West and what the West said with regard to China. In modern times China had excluded itself from other nations, and Pliny said that such was the case in his time; and yet Pliny mentioned a variety of articles, in the form of luxuries of high value, in use among the Romans, as having come from the land which Dr. Edkins had identified with the North of China, and if this were\nso it was a very remarkable coincidence. They knew that certain productions of some distant eastern country, in which the Greeks and Romans very greatly delighted, abounded in a very special manner in China at the present day. He was not aware of these articles being produced in any other countries to anything like the extent and value to which they were found in China. But apart from this hypothetical course of reasoning they knew that early in the Christian era the imperial power of Rome greatly extended itself in the direction of Central Asia, and countries were mentioned in the course of the paper before them which they could identify very clearly. Was there not a possibility of Chinese representatives having met with representatives of Rome in these parts? They had evidence of the clearest character that there were military expeditions from China to the far west, and they would be safe in assuming that no small amount of information would, by means of these expeditions, reach China, with regard to the great empire of Rome. If any western countries were known in Central Asia or in the places mentioned, they might be sure Rome was in particular; and whether Ta-tsin might be considered as descriptive of Rome or not, he had no doubt that in these countries as much information was obtained in regard to China on the one hand and in regard to Rome on the other as was possible under the circumstances. He had been led to believe that in early times there was a mutual knowledge between the east and the west which they were apt to overlook. There could not have been the interchange of products which they knew to have existed without this mutual knowledge.\n\nDr. Hirth observed, with regard to the parallel which Mr. Muirhead had drawn between the knowledge of China possessed by Rome and the knowledge of Rome possessed by China, that if Ta-tsin was actually identical with Ancient Rome, and if Fu-lin was Byzantium of the middle ages there seemed to be no doubt that the ancient Chinese knew a great deal more about Rome than the Romans had ever known about China. The Seres whether quoted in Horace or Virgil had been to the best instructed Roman only a name, the name of a silk producing nation who were at home at some distance beyond the terminus of Alexander's campaign; but there their knowledge of China was at an end, whereas the information about the countries of Ta-tsin and Fu-lin, such as it is recapitulated in the work of Ma-tuan-lin for instance, is quite as full of details as is the store\nof notices regarding China possessed by many a well educated European even now-a-days.\n\nThe Chairman said the undoubted fact of the existence of the Suez Canal in ancient times proved that there was a greater amount of intercourse between the West and the East than was generally recognised. They ought to express their indebtedness to Dr. Edkins for his valuable paper on a subject of great interest.\nARTICLE II.\n\nCOREA.*\n\nExtracts from Mr. F. Scherzer's French translation of the Chao-hsien-chih, and Bibliographical Notice. Translated into English by Charles Gould.\n\nI.\u2014BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTICE.\n\nThe Coreans possess two kinds of writing: the one, devoted to literary works and reserved for editing certain official documents, is in the Chinese character; the other, that is to say the Corean writing properly so called, is alphabetic, and permits of the exact representation of the sounds of the spoken language; this is especially employed by the lower orders and in printing popular editions.\n\nThe memoir on Corea of which I offer a translation is written in Chinese, and bears the title Tchao-sien-tche \u671d\u9bae\u5fd7 with the intimation \u4e0d\u8457\u624d\u4eba\u540d denoting an anonymous author; it figures in the vast collection known as Y-hai-tchou-tchen \u85dd\u6d77\u7403\u5875 which comprises no less than 165 different works. This important collection was compiled in the middle of the last century by Ou-chen-lan \u5433\u7701\u862d and corrected by Shu-y-yuen \u5f90\u4ee5\u57a3. This work was described for the first time by Mr. A. Wylie in his valuable \"Notes on Chinese literature\" as follows\u2014\"Chao-sien-che is an account of Corea including Geography and Customs, by a native of that country, whose name has not been preserved; but it appears to have been written in the latter part of the Ming dynasty.\"\n\nAll that I myself can affirm is that this memoir is subsequent in point of age to the first year of Shuen-te \u5ba3\u5fb7 that is to say, to 1465, and prior to the conquest of China by the Tartar Manchus in 1616.\n\n* Read before the Society on the 27th February, 1883.\nMy translation has been made from a manuscript which I had copied from the original text during my stay in Pekin, its accuracy being verified by a collation, (for which I am indebted to the kindness of the much lamented Archimandrite Palladius,) with the example of the Y-hai-tchou-tchen existing among the treasures of the fine library of the Russian mission in Pekin.\n\nII.\u2014Customs.\n\nThe Coreans profess a profound reverence for virtue; they hold literary studies in honor, and show a great inclination for them. An amiable urbanity is common, and they preserve the traditions of an exquisite politeness. At the death of one of the literati or of a functionary his relatives conform to the family rites of \"Tchou-ouen-koiung\" in the carrying out of the obsequies, mourning and sacrifices. Most of the Coreans, upon the death of their father, or mother, construct over the tomb a small house which they inhabit for three years. Those who fail in the duties of filial piety, lose all consideration in the eyes of the educated (literati) who cease to regard them as belonging to their order. During the whole time of mourning, some take only boiled rice, and abstain entirely from salt and cooked meats, others prepare with their own hands their food as well as the sacrifices offered on their relative's tombs. Marriages are arranged through the medium of a go-between, and sending presents. No alliance can be contracted between two persons of the same family. All the literati and functionaries have in their houses altars where they sacrifice in honour of their ancestors at the four periods of the year. Sons and grandsons abstain from rich food on the anniversary of their parent's death. They offer sacrifices before their tablets placed in the centre of a kind of altar in the form of niche.\n\nFunctionaries of the sixth rank and upwards sacrifice to their ancestors up to the third generation.\n\nThose of the seventh rank and below it sacrifice to theirs up to the second generation.\n\nOrdinary people only sacrifice to their defunct fathers and mothers.\nIf the oldest son of the principal wife has no male children, she adopts one of her other sons, and in case none of these has male posterity she adopts one of the sons which her husband may have by a secondary wife, whom she makes heir to the name in place of the eldest son.\n\nThe Coreans also offer sacrifices in honour of those of their relatives who may have died without posterity.\n\nIn case neither the principal wife, nor either of the second ones have born male children, they register an act of adoption of one of the younger sons of some member of their family.\n\nAmong the families of the literati, the wives upon the death of their husband take a vow of perpetual widowhood.\n\nOne of the literati or a functionary, on losing his principal wife, must wait three years before he can marry again, unless he has exceeded forty years in age without having a male child. In which case he can, on the order of his parents, contract a second marriage, after a year has elapsed from the death of his first wife.\n\nThe king annually offers a sacrifice in honour of Sien-nong, and proceeds in person to the ploughing of a consecrated field, whose products are destined to serve as offerings at the time of the principal sacrifices.\n\nThe Queen also offers a sacrifice in honour of Tien-tsan, she raises silkworms in the gardens situated at the end of the palace. She presides at the labours of the women who live in the Royal residence.\n\nAnnually, at the end of the autumn, the king invites the old men to a banquet, and profits by the occasion to raise, by one step, the rank of each of the functionaries charged with overlooking its preparation.\n\nThe king also gives a banquet, of which he personally does the honours to the sons and grandsons who have distinguished themselves by filial piety.\n\nThe Queen, on her part, offers a banquet, in the inner palace, to which are invited widows faithful to the memory of their husbands, and on the occasion makes a general distribution of presents.\nOnce a year the king sends rice as a present to centenarian old men.\n\nEach month he causes wine and meats to be served from his own table, to great dignitaries over seventy years of age, and to the father, mother, and wife of those of his subjects who may have distinguished themselves by service and also to the wives of great dignitaries. In spring and autumn, the king gives a banquet to officials of the highest rank, who having arrived at an advanced age, may enjoy a reputation for unquestionable virtue. This banquet is called the banquet of merit tested by age.\n\nTo those of his subjects who have distinguished themselves by filial piety, fraternal affection, fidelity to the memory of a defunct spouse, or by distinguished acts of virtue the king accords, according to the circumstances, a promotion or presents, or even an honorific tablet, or a dispensation from statute labour? [Corv\u00e9es.]\n\nThe king decrees, during their life time, public eulogies to officials who have made themselves conspicuous by integrity, and on their death, he sees to the employment of their sons and grandsons.\n\nThe sons and grandsons of subjects who have died upon the field of battle also receive assistance and are nominated to enter the public service.\n\nOn the death of a high dignitary related to the king mourning is general at the court, and the conduct of business is suspended. The king appoints a master of ceremonies, to convey his condolences, to offer sacrifices and preside at the funeral.\n\nThe king likewise sends a master of ceremonies to preside at the obsequies of his subjects who may have deceased at a distance from their families and in the fulfilment of their duties.\n\nThe king defrays the cost of the obsequies of members of the Royal family of inferior station, but related at least in the second degree.\n\nThe king contributes towards the cost of the funerals of members of the Academy, and of censors without distinction\nof rank as also to those, upon the occasion of the death whether of father or mother, of one of those functionaries. The king has constructed a magazine called Hoei-heou-chou which contains coffins for the use of poor families.\n\nThe names of individuals of bad reputation, of those possessing ill-acquired wealth, as also of widows who have married a second time, are inscribed on the registers of three tribunals. The children and grandchildren whose names figure on these registers are excluded from the society of the literati.\n\nWhen five children of any family attain literary grades the king distributes rice to their parents each year, and on the death of these latter sends an officer to assist at their funerals and decrees them an honorific title.\n\nThe king invites the civil and military graduates to a banquet called Ngeun-jong-yeu [Banquet of subjects distinguished by the Sovereign] and orders the authorities to give their relatives \"aubades\" (alms?) and to carry them wine in his name. This ceremony is called Jong-tsin-yeu [Banquet of relatives of subjects distinguished by the Sovereign.] The king likewise sends officer to offer sacrifices on the tombs of their parents (relatives)? This ceremony is called Jong-fenn [Honorable Burial.]\n\nThe king makes presents of rice to those of his subjects who are classed first in the examinations.\n\nHe grants assistance in money to all people whose poverty prevents them from marrying, or establishing their children opportunely, or from burying their dead within the period demanded by the rites.\n\nThe king provides the material for clothes for those of his subjects, who, being deprived of family, have not the wherewithal to cloth and provide for themselves, and for old men who are without means of sustenance.\n\nThe members of the Houng-ouen-kouan [College of high literature] go every other day in turn to pass the night at this college. The king goes there daily and assists at the readings. Where the ministers of state and censors are present by turns, it even happens that the conferences are prolonged throughout the night, until all obscure points have been elucidated.\nOfficers of the first rank who have arrived at the age of seventy, are refused permission to retire when their concurrence is deemed indispensable for the service of the state and the king presents them as a mark of his good will, with books, a table and a baton of old age. (Note,\u2014the batons of old age were terminated by a cross ending in a turtle dove head, this has been replaced later on by a dragon\u2019s head.)\n\nThe king decrees honorific titles to the ancestors up to the third generation of high dignitaries and of officials of the two first classes.\n\nWhen the father and mother of one of the literati or of a civil or military officer have reached the age of seventy years, one of their sons receives an order to return to the family home to take care of them. When they have reached the age of eighty, two of their sons are sent back, but when they arrive at ninety all the children are ordered to rejoin them, in order that they may surround them with the most careful attention.\n\nAnnually, during the summer months, a distribution of ice is made among the members of the Royal family and the high civil or military dignities. This is extended to those high dignitaries who are aged and past work, to the sick in the Houo-jeu-chou and to prisoners. Under the most ancient dynasties, equally with the present, it has been the practice to record in a repertory called San-kang-sin-ch\u00e9, all fine deeds by which faithful subjects have rendered themselves illustrious, pious sons, and widows who have preferred not to survive their husbands. This book is translated in all tongues [Note,\u2014\u65b9\u8a00 Fang-yen which signifies local languages or patois, the Corean pronunciation varying exceedingly according to the province], and is universally distributed both within and without the capital; so that from the most tender age the children of both sexes may not be ignorant of the fine traits of virtue which are related in it.\n\nThe Government has founded two establishments called Tchang-kun-kouan and Yang-sin-kou where five hundred doctors and batchelors are entertained as boarders, whose sole occupation is the study of literature and morality. Those of them who arrive at the age of fifty without having suc-\nceeded in their examinations, are granted employment by special favour of the king.\n\nThe king also nominates to a position in one of the four colleges of the North, South, East, or West, where the sons and brothers of officials are brought up, those of the literati who, having failed in their examinations for Batchelor or Doctor, prove themselves to possess a perfect acquaintance with one of the following works, the Siao-hio or the Tse-chou.\n\nThe king has installed the professors of Tong-meung \u7ae5\u8499, [note.\u2014these characters signify children less than twelve years old], whose duties are to instruct common people children more than eight years old, whose parents have insufficient resources to send them to school. In each sub-prefecture and in each district there is established a school having four divisions exactly on the model of Tchang-kun-kouan.\n\nThe inspector, [note.\u2014\u89c0\u5bdf\u4f7f, Kouan-tcha-che, an office corresponding with that of Tao Tai \u9053\u53f0], makes a round of these establishments, he inspects both professors and pupils, makes them explain the text in his presence, and gives them subjects of composition, keeps an exact account of their application or work and rewards or punishes them according to their zeal or indolence.\n\nIn spring and autumn a sacrifice is offered called Tche-tsai. The Inspector, the prefects and the sub-prefects proceed there in person and invite all the pupils to a great banquet.\n\nTwice a year, in spring and autumn, the high dignitaries of Y-tchang-fou, of the six ministries and of the different administrations give out subjects for composition to the pupils of Tchang-kun-kouang\u2014after having corrected the written themes they class them in order of merit. The names of the authors of the three first compositions are transmitted to a commission which proceeds to a new examination of the compositions and verifies the exactitude of the award.\n\nThe pupils of Tchang-kun-kouan who have satisfied the examiners occupy public positions.\n\nThose who study in the four colleges are examined on a stated day in the sixth moon of each year. They follow\nmoreover a daily course where they are questioned, and assist in the explanation of the texts.\n\nAt the close of these examinations fifty of the pupils are nominated pupils of the first class and have to compete again to obtain the degree of Batchelor or Doctor.\n\nThe same rules are observed in each province. The king's sons go daily to inform themselves of the condition of their father's health, and are present at his meals. Three times a day they assist at conferences where they both read, and discuss the text with their professors and the guests of the palace. They go to meet their professors, and reconduct them to the foot of the steps.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of each month they join together for a common reading preceded by a banquet. Each time that they have terminated the reading of one of their canonical books, a great banquet is given, a distribution of presents made.\n\nFunctionaries of inferior rank recently promoted ought, within ten days from the time of their nomination, to visit the members of Y-tchang-fou, the minister of officials, and of the administration to which they belong.\n\nThere is a palace called Tchong-y-kien, which serves for the residence of the descendants of kings of former dynasties who receive a subsidy consisting of rice and the revenue of certain territories devoted to their maintenance.\n\nThere is a formal prohibition to cultivating the area of the sepulchres of the kings of the former dynasties of Sin-lo, of Po-tsi and of Kao-ku-li.\n\nTemples have been erected in honour of the founders of the ancient dynasties, and of persons who have rendered themselves illustrious by lofty actions and virtues. The local authorities repair to these in the spring and autumn of each year to offer sacrifices.\n\nOutside the capital on the north, may be seen an uncovered altar where in the spring and autumn annual sacrifices are offered by the official of Han-tchang-fou for souls without an asylum. The same ceremony is performed in each prefecture, and in each district.\nDuring the winter season, the king causes mat-coverings to be distributed among the prisoners, during the summer, he has their prison cleaned, and their cangue and their irons moistened, so that these wretches may not suffer too much from the rigour of the cold, or from the intensity of the heat.\n\nThe king nominates an official expert in the act of healing, to whom he gives supplies of medicine appropriated for the treatment of sick prisoners.\n\nThe government distributes clothing and rice among those prisoners whose poverty prevents them from maintaining themselves.\n\nOutside the capital there is a granary called Tchang-ping-tchan, [note,\u2014or granary of uniform price, this institution goes back so far as the Han dynasty. It is due to the sagacity of the Emperor Ou Ti.\u2014Vide Sze-tche-tong-kien, k. 6. f. 29] where rice can be purchased when the price of cereals has augmented. The directors of this granary buy up rice when it has reached its lowest value, which permits of their reselling it cheaply to poor people during times of scarcity.\n\nThere also exists a granary whose directors make loans in the spring to cultivators of the quantity of grain necessary for sowing their fields; this is made good to the granary in autumn, and remains there till the following spring when it is again lent out; by this means the sowing is renewed annually.\n\nWhen inundations or drought have produced scarcity the king opens establishments throughout the kingdom called Tchen-t'si-tchang, [note,\u2014establishments of public assistance like the institutions founded in 1879 in Chantung, Honan, Chan-si and Tchili] where assistance is distributed to the population.\n\nEach year, in spring and autumn, the heads of the district and the sub-prefects proceed, conformably with the rites, to the ceremony of Siang-yu-tsiou [note,\u2014literally the libations of the village. This custom dates from the highest antiquity, and recalls the love feasts of the ancients. Vide.\u2014The Li-ki, k. 10 f. 45.]\nIn the provinces, the village people elect a chief to whom each one must remit a contribution of rice and cloth.\n\nIn the spring and autumn, the inhabitants assemble at a banquet prepared at the common cost with a view to strengthening the bonds of mutual affection, and of affirming the concord uniting them.\n\nWhen an illness or unforeseen catastrophe happens the people assist one another, and when one of them happens to die they assess themselves to provide the cost of the funeral, and of a double coffin, and ground for a grave. Upon the death of an official belonging to the third class or who may have exercised the functions of censor or of academician his sons and grandsons receive promotions, and in the first month of each year submit to examinations which permit of their attaining employment proportionate to their talents.\n\nIf the children of the defunct have not yet obtained any step, the officials of the third rank, and upwards, are authorized to interest themselves for the most studious of them, and to recommend them to the minister of public employment who examines them in the canonical books, and gives them employment proportionate to their talents. In the event of their giving, after their promotion, proofs of incapacity, the official who has recommended them incurs severe blame.\n\nThe competition for the degree of licentiate takes place every third year. The examination is divided into three trials: the first consists of two dissertations upon the books of Confucius; the second in a poetic composition and the historical resum\u00e9 of a reign; the last comprises a series of questions to which the candidate must reply in writing.\n\nThe competition for the degree of doctor is divided into three parts: first the candidate must present a dissertation upon the Sse-chou and the Ou-king.\n\nWhen this trial has been undergone in a satisfactory fashion the candidate is admissible for the second examination, consisting in a poetic composition and the historical resum\u00e9 of a reign.\n\nTo satisfy the last trial the candidate must answer in writing questions based on all possible matters.\nThe king personally interrogates the candidates who have fulfilled this series of examinations and proceeds to definitively class them.\n\nAn extraordinary examination session can be held on the anniversary of the king's birth.\n\nAt the time of great f\u00eates, the king proceeds to Hio-kouan, assists at the lessons which are given there and finds the opportunity of granting extraordinary promotions, and of making an exceptional examination of those whom he judges worthy of a literary degree.\n\nThe king is in the habit of offering frequent sacrifices in honour of Confucius, and of visiting different colleges to assist at lessons and conferences, where the professors and pupils are admitted or even to examine these latter in the rendering of difficult passages of the classics, as to their skill in shooting with the bow, or to give them subjects for composition.\n\nAt the close of the examination, the list of successful candidates is proclaimed in the Throne Chamber.\n\nThe king makes them presents consisting of wine, gilded flowers, and a parasol of honour, makes them assist at a theatrical representation, and then has them reconducted to the sound of music which escorts them for three days as a mark of honour.\n\nThose pupils who have distinguished themselves upon the occasion of a visit of the king to the royal college see their names proclaimed on the very day itself in the throne chamber. They receive by order of the king a saddled horse, a court robe, and an ivory tablet. This distinction is of a degree more elevated than that granted in the preceding case.\n\nAt the commencement of the year, as well as of that of the great cold, and at the principal anniversaries, the king accompanied by the Princes, his sons, and by the body of officials, proceeds to the ceremony of the Ouang-k\u00fce-li [note,\u2014that of the three kneelings and nine prostrations]. On each of these occasions he sends an embassy to carry a letter of homage to the Emperor of China. The king, always followed by the princes, his sons, and by the body of officials, makes the\nsalutation of the four prostrations in honour of the Imperial throne.\n\nThe king kneeling takes the letter which he places in the hands of his envoy, then makes three salutations, and accompanies outside the chamber the letter addressed to the throne, enclosed in a yellow box and preceded by bearers of emblems.\n\nThe king observes the same ceremonial when he goes to meet ambassadors returning from China; he receives them beneath a tent decorated with silks of five colours.\n\nThe king presides personally over the choice of presents to form the tribute destined for the Emperor of China.\n\nThe members of the royal family, as soon as they have arrived at the age of fifteen years, go to study at the college Tsong-hio. They daily decide by lot the duties which they should complete in order to merit a note (mark?) of satisfaction.\n\nThe minister of rites has the pupils of the four colleges interrogated monthly upon the matters which have formed the subject of their studies.\n\nThe names of pupils from the Capital, and from the province, the works which they have studied day by day, the names, titles, and qualities of their professors are registered in the archives of this minister.\n\nPromotion is granted the Professor, if three among his pupils have been classed first in the competition for the degree of Doctor, or even if more than ten have obtained the degree of Batchelor or of licentiate.\n\nThe costume worn at the celebration of sacrifices, the costumes of the court, the official costumes are in all points similar to the Chinese costumes, [note,\u2014this passage clearly shows us that the memoir was written before the Manchu conquerors had modified the Chinese costume, i.e. before 1616.] At the four great epochs of the year, at the eight great festivals, and at the end of each quarter, the people renew the hearth fire.\n\nWhen a child is abandoned by its parents, the Han-tchang-fou or local authority, takes it, feeds it, clothes it, receives it under its protection, and charges itself henceforward with its maintenance.\nRead before the Society on the 17th April, 1883.\nsalutation of the four prostrations in honour of the Imperial throne.\n\nThe king kneeling takes the letter which he places in the hands of his envoy, then makes three salutations, and accompanies outside the chamber the letter addressed to the throne, enclosed in a yellow box and preceded by bearers of emblems.\n\nThe king observes the same ceremonial when he goes to meet ambassadors returning from China; he receives them beneath a tent decorated with silks of five colours.\n\nThe king presides personally over the choice of presents to form the tribute destined for the Emperor of China.\n\nThe members of the royal family, as soon as they have arrived at the age of fifteen years, go to study at the college Tsong-hio.

Names have been given to the most prominent peaks and their heights have been ascertained or estimated; but beyond that nothing is known of the outlines of these mountain ranges or the valleys between them; and of the physical aspects of the East coast we are still less able to judge, it being closed to our view. This is however not astonishing. Those whom their vocation leads to this island, have other pursuits to attend to and those, who did spend a few days in the interior, went there out of curiosity or for Ethnological studies.

The\n\n* Read before the Society on the 17th April, 1883.\nattraction of the Savages naturally led to a neglect of the country they live in, hence few observations of a geographical and none whatever of a geological nature have ever been made or brought to notice, at least as far as the South and centre of Formosa are concerned.\n\nWant of time has also prevented me from making long travels of exploration and obliged me to confine myself to South Formosa only, i.e. to that part of the Island which lies between the 22nd and 23rd degrees of latitude.\n\nThe following are the results of my investigations:\n\nThe southernmost end of Formosa on an average 5 miles broad, is protected against the waters of the ocean by two hill ranges, which run along the east and west coast; the one, called the Gooswa Promontory extends from the South West Cape in a straight line 7 miles northwards, its two highest points in the middle and towards the end being 538 feet and 627 feet high, respectively. The other range commences with the South Cape, runs gradually rising towards northwest, opens into a broad plateau and turning to N.E. terminates at the Savage village Shamalee. Four miles to the north west of the South Cape is a peculiarly rugged hill, 1,035 feet high, from which the land slopes gradually towards the east range forming another plateau. From Shamalee westward extends a double peaked ridge, and south of this the land is further divided by two parallel ranges, rising to more than 2,000 feet, one of which terminates in a cone shaped mountain,\u2014Remarkable Peak,\u20141,083 feet above the level of the sea. East of the Gooswa Promontory and Bay hill, which is a small isolated hill, south of Expedition Bay, lies a level tract of land, at its widest part 3 li broad. In the middle of this, at the foot of the Shamalee range is the District Capital H\u00eang-ch\u2019un-hsien, and in its northwest corner at the mouth of a broad river lies Ch\u00ea-ch\u00eang sive Langchiao. A mountain vis \u00e0 vis to this walled village and bearing the same name forms the link between the hills south and north, divided from the one by a deep chasm and from the other by the Langchiao river.\n\nTurning now to the composition of all these capes, moun-\ntain and hill ranges, we find in the cliffs at South Cape abundant remains of corals, which make up almost the entire mass. The crest of the east range is a series of limestone rocks with fractures and fissures, and the west range shows the same towards the seaside, but its top and inland slopes, as well as the surface of South Cape and the eastern slope of that range are covered with calcareous sand. The beach round Kualiang Bay consists of fine coral sand, and numerous recent Zoophytes red and white are found. The other mountains are thickly wooded in luxuriant tropical vegetation, the trees and shrubs which cover them up to the summits, have protected their surface from the wasting influence of atmospheric agencies, their underlying formation therefore is not so apparent to cursory observations. At one spot, however, the waters of an extensive spring have laid it open and disclosed strata of limestone. This spring, by the way, is situated in the territory of the Kualuts in a beautiful forest. Women and children of the savage tribe were sitting around it and filling their bamboo tubes with water, when I approached on the way to their village. As my escort informed me, this spring has high qualities in curing wounds and smallpox. It belongs probably to the class \"Earthy waters\" of which the chief contents are sulphate and carbonate of lime. The cone of Remarkable Peak is of compact limestone, limestone rocks reach out of the water at several places along the shore of Kualiang Bay, and within the walls of Heng-ch'un-hsien I again found a large pile of Limestone Rocks. The soil which forms the upper layers in this district is throughout of argillo-calcareous nature, varying from soft earthy shale at the foot of Remarkable Peak to fine yellow clay exposed by the rivulets of the plain.\n\nOn the mountains between Langchiao and the Pacific Coast \"bright flames\" have often been seen \"jutting out of the hard-baked earth,\" a statement which, as I have not been there myself, must at present suffice for our researches into the composition of that region, though all details as to the height at which this phenomenon was seen and as to the nature of she ground are wanting. The hardbaked earth probably was\nthale or mudstone, similar to that, which I found on Sugar loaf hill (see further on). The flame may be caused by the ignition of sulphuretted hydrogen, which would point to volcanic action, or by the ignition of the vapours of a petroleum spring, which would point to underlying strata of coal or bituminous shale and sandstone cavities. On the whole I think the latter explanation more probable. Coal indeed has been shown to me by the District Magistrate as having been found within the limits of his jurisdiction. The Langchiao river finally gives evidence of Sandstone by the reddish fragments which it contains.\n\nLet us now follow the military road, which connects this southernmost part of Formosa with the great plain. Immediately after leaving Langchiao it passes over the east side of a low hill, apparently a sanddune, which forms Langchiao point, goes along the bay of the same name on a strand of coral sand and ascends the slopes of a sugar loaf shaped hill, 411 feet high, which fall steep to the sea and consist of mudstone containing iron. From here stretches the Liliang ridge 6 miles northward, the two southern summits of which rise to the heights of 2,263 and 2,437 feet, and the northern one, near the town of Hongkong, to 3,365 feet.* The gentle slopes of this range form a \"raised beach,\" below which a second one has formed, covered with large sandstone pebbles, d\u00e9bris of the formerly surfworn upperterrace. Some of these are red, others variegated, showing yellow, bluish, reddish and purple lines, some show streaks of quartz, all of them sparks of mica. Corals and coralsand do not reach beyond Langchiao Bay. At one spot, among others, where a spur reaches the sea, the road was cut through the solid rocks and disclosed dark red breccia. Horizontal lines and Tideripples were visible at different places on the sandstone cliffs at a height of about 50 feet. Further on the strip of land, which runs between the sea and the mountain range, gradually widens into a sandy tract, on which a few acres have been cultivated with rice and sugar. The cliffs are overgrown with brushwood; but where torrents break over them, white sandstone rocks (quartzites)\n\n* These figures are taken from the \"China Sea Directory.\"\nare uncovered, and a section showing huge boulders of the same material covered by gravel and sand was also laid open to the eye.\n\nThe town of Hongkong is beautifully situated, 30 li from Langchiao, on an alluvial tract of dark sand covering strata of flagstones, which extend to the sea and form a bar round the shallow harbour. They are deposits from the two mountains, which here meet the Li-liang Sua. The coast line northwards shows shingle of a similar nature; houses and walls are built of these dark-grey sandstones; they are less micaceous than the before mentioned red ones but are mostly traversed by veins of quartz; of the specimens collected one shows crystalization, the other both this and slaty texture. 5 li north of Hongkong another mountain torrent enters the sea, its banks are precipitous and at its mouth a dark cliff rises, which from its shape is called \"Saitou,\" i.e. Lion's head.\n\n2 miles further on, on similar ground as Hongkong, also pierced by a small river and surrounded by a stonebar, lies the village of Chetonka. The same may be said of Namchieh, the next station on the road. Except at these points the coast is bold and steep, the hills in some places descending almost to the water's edge. On one of these projections, where a fort has been built on the rocks, I met with traces of coralline limestone; otherwise this part of the coast consists of white sandstone cliffs like those before Hongkong.\n\nFrom Namchieh I made an ingress among the mountains. After crossing the alluvial plain, I arrived at a gorge through which a river flows; from its entrance a level terrace extends towards the seashore, and at the other side a narrow valley opens to the left and right, partly cultivated. I followed the river eastward and ascended one of the hills, where I had opportunity to observe the physical aspects of the neighbouring mountains: this district is made up of detached rounded hills and short anticlinal ridges, whilst parallel ranges striking from North to South are the general character of the southern system. The scenery here is also wilder and more picturesque.\n\nThe specimens collected near Namchieh belong to the Clayslate group, of various description and different gradation of metamorphosis.\n1. Hard and compact, sub-crystalline fine grained slate, splitting into plane layers.\n\n2. Somewhat arinaceous rough feeling shale, not very fissile, rather friable.\n\n3. Shining, foliating schist.\n\nThe last named was by position the lowest having been detached from the rocky bank of the river, which washes these schistose strata.\n\nFrom Namchieh the road winds around the Chao Shan, 1,340 feet high, and enters the great plain. The ground becomes darker and the beach presents a deep black sand, which continues all along the coast as far as Takow. The mountains here recede and stretch in a North-North-East direction to the foot of the Kucilei Shan (i.e. Punch and Judy Mountain) which is the backbone of the southern central range.\n\nThe hills northwest of this I have examined. They are throughout a mass of black shale of slaty, not schistose structure, much like, though inferior to the so-called roofing slates found in European primary districts. What the bamboo is to the Chinese, the slate is in many respects to the Savages, who live on the steep flanks of these rugged and barren mountains. The walls and roofs of their houses and granaries are composed of slate, slate plates are the shutters placed in front of the openings which do service as windows and doors, blocks of slate serve as seats, on slate again they crush the millet. This millet and a kind of potato, called \"Wassa\" in the Gali language, are the only produce of these regions, the one growing in the valleys, the other on thin layers of dark soil, which cover the lower hills.\n\nAbout 2 miles North of Bankimsing a mountain stream has broken through the outskirts of the Kueileishan; a terrace of clay of about the same height as that of the Namchieh shows also here the former level of the river; the rocks at one side of the pass consist of purple coloured shale and nearly horizontal strata dipping from West to East are visible crossing the strike of the hill. Past this gorge valleys open towards the North and South; the latter turns Eastward and reaches to\nthe foot of the Kueilei mountain, which here rises abruptly to a height of 9,050 feet. The ranges flanking this valley and resting on or issuing from the mainmass, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet, partly slope at an angle of about 25\u00b0, forming terraces at some places, and partly fall abruptly. The river bed, at the season I visited it, in February, contained but little water, as all the other streams of a similar nature, which in summer, however, are furious and almost impassable torrents. This river bed, when seen from the heights, looks like a white band wound through the brushwood. The stones which cover it and which extend far out into the plain, till hidden from sight by the overlying clay, are particularly interesting, because they give us a clue to the mineralogical composition of the principal mountain from which they come. Besides Black Slates, I found the following fragments:\n\n1. \u2014 Hornblende-schist, with flakes of mica, traversed by quartz veins, coated with iron and waterworn crystals of felspar;\n\n2. \u2014 Felstone-Porphyry, hard and compact veined and covered with white felspar, which shows an uneven and splintery fracture and is highly crystallized.\n\nIt remains to add, that throughout these masses of Sandstones and Slates I have found no organic remains except a stem of wood inclosed in a nodule of ironstone which I picked up somewhere near Hongkong. Although this does not prove that there are no fossils embedded, they are certainly rare, as may well be expected, considering the nature and age of these rocks.\n\nThe above notes and observations, though they may seem scanty, nevertheless enable us to draw the following deductions:\n\n1. \u2014 The highest central mass of mountains in South Formosa is of primary age, consisting of crystalline schists, broken through by igneous rocks, such as Porphyries.\n\n2. \u2014 The mountains flanking the highest central mass to the North-west, West, and South West as far as Namchieh are made up of Silurian Slates and Shales.\n\n3. \u2014 The hill ranges from Namchieh to H\u00eangch\u2019unhsien are\ncomposed of the following alterations of strata, traversed in some places by veins of quartz:\n\na. Arinaceous shale, which is apparently a transition from the clayslate to \u2014\u2014\n\nb. Darkgrey micaceous flagstone;\n\nc. Grey sandstone;\n\nd. White sandstone (quartzite);\n\ne. Red breccia (conglomerate);\n\nf. Red Sandstone.\n\nAll these rockmasses except the white sandstone (Silurian) which is found lowest on a level with the sea, are probably Devonian deposits, lying on Silurian strata and overspread by the Carboniferous System which contains seams of coal and ferruginous shale and ironstone.\n\n4. The district south of Hengch'un-hsien was originally a Coral Island.\n\nSo much for the mountainous part of South Formosa. The plain, however, so important and well known from an economical point of view is not less interesting geologically. It extends from Pangliao northward through the whole western part of the island; a series of hillranges, which approaches the seashore near the city of Taiwanfu, divides it into two parts, the southern of which only falls within the boundary of this paper. This, the most fertile district in the whole island, is an alluvium of posttertiary origin, a rich loam derived partly from the shales of the Central Mountains partly from the Sandstones south and partly from the Limestone hills, which here and there reach above the level of the lowland. These are the great and small Kangshan, the Whale back, Apeshill, Saracen's head, Fengshan, and, still surrounded by water, but belonging to the same category, Lambay Island near Tangkang.\n\nApeshill or Taku Shan (beat the drum-hill, so called because of the rocks dangerous to navigation, which lie at its foot and which make the junkmen appeal to the Gods by beating the gong) has been very well described by Dr. Guppy in his paper\n\"Notes on the Geology of Takow\"* and correctly characterised. It remains for me but to determine the period, in which it originated, therefore it is necessary to particularize the various kinds of Limestone and allied rocks found, and the fossils, they contain. We have:\n\n1.\u2014Compact Limestone, a hard smooth fine grained rock, generally of bluish grey colour;\n2.\u2014Saccharine or Statuary Marble, fine grained, white, resembling loafsugar in texture;\n3.\u2014Oolite, composed of grains connected by a calcareous cement;\n4.\u2014Marl, friable compound of lime and clay;\n5.\u2014Chalk or rather indurated carbonate of lime;\n6.\u2014Red clay.\n\nTo Dr. Guppy's List of Fossils only one specimen is worth adding, but an important one, namely the coinshaped, foraminiferal, shell Nummus laevigata, which however is not so much developed that I could speak here of Nummulitic Limestone. But it serves us as a guide in fixing the time of the last great upheaval of Apeshill, i.e. the beginning of the Tertiary Period. There are traces of the cretaceous system, but the main composition of Apeshill, the plateau and its fringes are decidedly Oolitic, while I am inclined to think that the summit of Apeshill and the fundamental rocks reach as far back as the Carboniferous epoch. The characteristic features of the Mountain Limestone: subcrystalline, intersected by joints and thus breaking up in large tabular masses\u2014as well as the fragments of older corals (Lithostrotia are abundant) which are spread about below and form part of the earthy varieties, point to it. Examination of the caverns and fissures, which Dr. Guppy recommended to any resident at Takow, did not bring forward anything particular, so far as I have been in them. The fissures form a labyrinth of subterranean passages of varying width, as much as 30 feet deep, and the caves reach down to an immeasurable depth; in fact Apeshill is a vast cave, to which access would be easy enough, were not an amount of\n\n* Journal N. C. B. of R. A. S. vol. XVI, 1880.\ncuriosity required that would surpass wisdom. Some of the smaller caverns, which I entered, presented stalagmites and stalactites, also columns, but none very extraordinary. The floor deposit consists of calc-tuff. Bones of goats and cattle, which fell down and died there are to be met with; of living beings large spiders, lizards and monkeys have their abode here.\n\nWhaleback Hill is the sea bottom tilted up by subterranean force. One half of the broken crust remained standing at angles of 25-30\u00b0, while the other half tumbled together. The rocks present the petrified bottom of the ocean with its shells in situ; but it is impossible to determine by the fossils, with which of the three (not only two) traceable upheavals of Apeshill, Whaleback simultaneously arose.\n\nF\u00eangshan (Phoenix-mountain, so called from its birdlike shape) is also limestone formation; it lies 6 miles South of Takow, near the Coast and its rocks reach into the sea. From F\u00eangshan North-east a low line of hills continues which has at one time most probably been a line of Sanddunes as the Takow spit is at the present day.\n\nAt the mouth of the Tangkang River, 9 miles S.W. from the town of the same name, lies the small island Hsiao Liu chiu (a name referring to the Chinese idea that Formosa in ancient time formed part of the kingdom of Liuchiu). Lambay Island, as foreigners name it, is of similar origin to Apeshill, but of more recent age, not older than tertiary. The fossil shells embedded in its limestone differ not at all from species at present in existence. The island is surrounded by living coral reefs, which at ebb-tide are visible above the surface and extend far into the sea, where they shimmer through the waves from a depth of 10 to 20 fathoms, so clear is the water here. The beach at the Eastside of this little isle is covered with white coralsand and the greatest variety of Cockles and shells is found, a remarkable contrast to the black shore of the opposite mainland, on which no trace of living beings is met, save crustacea burrowing in the sand. At the Southwest point of the island are some not very extensive caverns. The islanders informed me, that when they, or rather their grand-\nfathers, settled there (120 years ago), they found human bones in them and a table of stone. Chinese, it appears, prefer to keep away from caverns: on Apeshill they fear the monkeys and here, the ghosts.\n\nIn crossing from Lambay Island to Tangkang which town lies on indurated mudflats, the material of which was carried down from the Slate mountains by the same river, which they now embank, one sails over a depth of more than 300 fathoms. Such an extraordinary depression is most singular in the Formosa channel, which on an average is only about 20 fathoms deep, so much so, that the Commander of a British gunboat, who first discovered it, may be excused for taking this spot for the submerged water of a vulcano. The geological condition of the surrounding land speaks against this assumption, and we cannot, with due regard for the local circumstances explain it otherwise than as a chasm, which is gradually filling up.\n\nFrom what I have said up to the present, it would almost seem as if the popular idea, \"Formosa is a volcanic island,\" was altogether wrong. There is in truth no trace of recent volcanic eruption in the districts above described, but very close by, only 3 miles Northeast of the port of Takow is a tract of land, the peace and quiet of which has never been suspected by Takow Residents as hiding the recent seat of action of the subterranean forces, and it was not until in reading the \"Taiwan fu chih,\" I came across a passage recording the last eruption, that I myself visited those hills. They are the \"Chih Shan\" known to foreigners as the Pineapple hills, where the most delicious fruit grows, that Formosa produces. The chapter of historical events says: \"In the 61st year of Kang-hsi (i.e. 1722) in summer Chihshan opened 8 chang (80 feet) long and 4 chang (40 feet) wide; black earth (mud) came out; on the 2nd day, by night, fire came out, several feet high;\" and the Mountain and River chapter notes with reference to Chih Shan, the name of which is also explained as derived from the colour of the ground, that \"sometimes fire is rising.\"\n\nThere we have an accurate description of a volcanic outburst from a Chinese record and quite in accordance with the theo-\nries of foreign science. The fire was, of course, only visible by night because it was not fire, but simply the glowing light of the ejected material, and this, described as black earth ('hei tu') was hot mud, which in the usual course would afterwards assume the reddish brown colour of iron dust. This was the case here; for on my exploring visit I found the hills to consist of a light and porous reddish yellow earth, very much like clay, but being in reality tufa, the chemically transformed volcanic mud, and on the surface at some places thin layers of tuffstone, the loose tufa cemented. The district covers about three square miles and includes a small lake; it is the outcrop of not one only, but frequent small eruptions at different places. One spot, where an outburst of mud had taken place, I have traced on the extreme western hill, 3 miles East of Whaleback, and there are several points which render it probable that this is the one alluded to in the records. Where the vent was, is now a pool of water, and on the south side, where the accumulation is higher than on the northern, a thin crust of scoriae is found. Not far, S.E. from the supposed vent, I noticed a vertical cutting of a dyke, which shew the following interesting sequence of layers, from the top downwards.\n\n| SOFT GROUND, |\n| --- |\n| SCORIAE, |\n| YELLOW TUFF, |\n| GREY TUFF, |\n| BLUISH BLACK TUFF, |\n| DARK YELLOW TUFF, |\n| LIGHT YELLOW TUFF, |\n| A DARK YELLOW LINE (HARDER), |\n| WHITISH TUFF, |\n| DARK YELLOW TUFF, |\n| SCORIAE, |\n| &c., &c., &c. |\nI am unable to explain the variation of the colours otherwise than that the different materials deposited contained different proportions of lime and silica. Among the fragments thrown up I have especially to mention a large piece of rock-crystal and one of white sandstone, which indicate the deeper strata.\n\nHot Springs are also said to exist in this district according to the \"Taiwan fu chih;\" but I have not found any. A river called Liu 'huang chiang (Sulphur River) rises here and runs into the Lagoon at Takow; but its name may be derived from the Sulphursprings at the foot of Apeshill.\n\nNortheast of Chihshan commence the outrunners of the mountains, which, as above-mentioned, bisect the Formosan plain. My stay in Takow, however, has not been long enough to allow of my exploring them and the climate of the 22nd degree of latitude is not in favour of outdoor-exercise.\n\nFrom this description of the geological condition we may now deduce the following series of evolutions to have taken place, which together make up the Geological History of South Formosa and to some extent of the whole island.\n\n1.\u2014First in order must be placed the deposition of the crystalline schists, which probably correspond with F. von Richthofen's Sinian System. By folding of these, the central mountain ranges originated.\n\n2.\u2014A period of volcanic activity succeeded, to which the falsitic traps owe their existence.\n\n3.\u2014Then followed abrasion of the primary mountains from which fresh clayey deposits at their base, the slates and shales of the present day were derived; sediments of a sandy nature were washed on, and while the sea was rising more and more during the Silurian and Devonian periods, all those strata were accumulated, which now form the mountainous district of South Formosa. The fissile sandstones and arinaceous shale near Namchieh show where the two substances, sand and clay, joined.\n\n4.\u2014At the end of the Devonian Period the land appears to have risen again. The red conglomerates which occur at the\nheight of about 200 feet above the present level are the remains of a then gravel or pebble beach.\n\n5.\u2014At that time also vegetation flourished and the surface of the ground was overgrown with plants. The sandy shore was studded with that low kind of Palmtree, Cycadeae, which we now find along the sandy bank of the plain; for an iron-pyrite has preserved us a piece of the trunk showing the same organic structure.\n\n6.\u2014Periodical inundations and gradual submergence of the land followed; new sediments accumulated and covered that primary and subsequent vegetation, which compressed altered and mineralized we now find as seams of coal.\n\n7.\u2014Earth movements or Crust motions seem to coincide with this, the Carboniferous period. Vulcanic action had long since ceased on the Formosa as it then existed, but manifested itself at the sides, giving origin to the basaltic Pescadores in the West, the Pinnacle group, Tiau-su Island in the North East, and Harp Island, which in 1853 was still in a violent state of eruption, on the East Coast. The volcanic districts near Tamsui and North-east of Taiwansoo are also proofs of the volcanic activity, which developed at the foot of the Central Mountain ranges, at first under and afterwards above water. Under these the subterranean forces worked by upheaving the mass, too strong to be disrupted, and while the island thus more and more rose above the waves, which surrounded it at the end of the Carboniferous period, its sides gradually subsided, thus contributing to the receding of the sea and subsequent denudation.\n\n8.\u2014Meanwhile corals had commenced their structures on the sedimentary bottom and built their reefs around the land. Thus in the South, for instance, Remarkable Peak originated, which now as a compact limestone cone points into the air, and a series of reefs extended around it. Simultaneously with a general rising of the island those first reefs as well as the ground, to which corals had attached themselves, rose above the surface of the ocean. The coral growth continued not on the original rocks, but around them, forming a new series of reefs, till after again rising the whole formed a coral island\ncorresponding in all its characteristics with the coralline islands existing in the Pacific Ocean, at the present day. There, a fringing reef of coral is often found immediately attached to the land, whilst in many other cases the reef surrounds a volcanic island, the intervening space of irregular, but nowhere of great width, forming a lagoon or channel of still water, protected by the reef from wind and waves. The reefs very often form an arc, the convexity of which is towards the prevailing wind, and a straight line of reef not generally rising above the reach of the tide, forms the chord of the arc. Here at the South end of Formosa we have two Mountain ranges, Coral-reefs built up by generations of zoophytes, now raised high above the sea, solidified by age and chemical agency and transformed into compact limestone. They form an arc open towards the South, whence for six months during the year the South West monsoon blows and evidently has blown for ages, and as the reef which formed the cord of this arc, we may identify the plateau between the South and South-west ranges, which, except in the middle is lower than the other hills and was at one time still below the level of the sea, whilst the higher reefs already surpassed it. The hill ranges within the circuit may be looked upon as the sedimentary bottom, raised by previous earth movements, answering to the volcanic rocks to which the corals attached themselves and around which their fringes extended. The navigable passage spoken of as leading through the reef into the inclosed lagoon is found at Langchiao, but it is by no means accidental, that this opening should be there; for as the convexity of the arc is towards the wind prevailing in summer, so this passage has been kept open by the North-east monsoon which during the winter months was driving the waters of the Formosa channel into the lagoon within the reefs. In consequence of a third upheaval, the lower reefs also rose to the surface and the channels of still water which were between the reefs and the land emptied themselves leaving behind layers of mud, clay and sand as proof of their past existence and as a foundation for the fertile valleys that are now under cultivation.\n\nThe second great Limestone formation, Apeshill, is of a somewhat different nature. It seems to be a link in a series\nof barrier-reefs, which stretched along the whole South-west Coast of Formosa. Like the oldest rocks of the South Cape district it also was built up during the time of subsidence (Carboniferous period), hence its great height of about 1,000 feet, not reckoning the probable depth under the surface, and upheaved at three consecutive times. It stands witness to the different periods, which intervene between the Carboniferous and the Tertiary, bearing traces of the clayey and cretaceous sediments which were deposited during that time in the Formosa Channel.\n\n9.\u2014While the denudation of the mountains went on, and afterwards by torrents of rain, which deepened the channels, widened the valleys and broke through the rocks, forming those gorges, through which now rivers rush into the sea, d\u00e9bris were carried down and gradually filled up the shallow sea between the land and the outlying islands; fresh sediments were washed on to these, attached themselves and gradually connecting, formed the outline of the present plain.\n\n10.\u2014At the time of the Dutch, towards the middle of the 17th century, new Formosa was so far formed that only shoals and flat islands, Anping for instance, were still unconnected with the mainland. South of F\u00eangshan a large shallow Bay existed. The land generally was so marshy that the Dutch laid their roads on artificial dykes. The plain extended more and more into the sea: the city of Kushia, built on the seashore (North-east of Apeshill) 150 years ago, now lies a mile away from the tidal waves; shallow lagoons have taken the place of former expanses of water; on former islands sugar cane is now planted, and the sportsman finds almost every year more of his snipeground turned into ricefields and new marshland consoles him for his loss. The almost visible elevation of this Formosan plain is, of course, not due alone to alluvial accumulation, but the subterranean forces, which already have begun to alter the surface of the plain, by throwing up hills (mud-volcanoes) have their share in this useful work of extending the land, as the slight crust motions, which accompany the frequent earthquakes, tend to raise it. Suppose that the present conditions continue, in from 50 to 100\nyears, the inner harbour at Takow will no longer exist as such; besides having become too shallow for vessels of even the lightest draught, it may possibly be closed altogether by the masses of rock which tumble down from the sides of the narrow entrance, and although the outer harbour may replace it, it will not offer the same shelter as is found now within the precincts of Apeshill and Saracen's head. The open roadstead of Anping, already 2 miles away from the port, will be pushed out to sea more and more, and Tangkang, situated at the mouth of a powerful and for native craft navigable river, which rather deepens its bed, and already an important mart and centre of the junktrade between this part of the island and the continent of China, is likely to become the most suitable harbour and the principal seat of the Export Trade of South Formosa.\nARTICLE IV.\n\nFRAGMENTS\n\nD'UN VOYAGE DANS L'INTERIEUR DE LA CHINE.\n\nPAR\n\nC.

Le Vou-soung Kiang se jette \u00e0 Changha\u00ef dans le Houang-pou et est d\u00e9cor\u00e9 par les \u00e9trangers du nom de Crique de Sou-tch\u00e9ou (Soo-chow creek) parce qu'il y conduit.\npour tranquilliser notre bateau qui, comme tout bon l\u00f4da, se refusait \u00e9nergiquement \u00e0 naviguer la nuit, de peur d'\u00eatre d\u00e9trouss\u00e9 par des pirates d'eau douce ou des revenants imaginaires sortis de son cerveau f\u00e9cond. Apr\u00e8s une nuit relativement paisible, troubl\u00e9e seulement par le gong que nos turbulents voisins frappaient de temps \u00e0 autre pour effrayer les voleurs, nous repartions aux premi\u00e8res blancheurs de l'aube et continuions notre route vers Sou-tch\u00e9ou.\n\nCette grande ville s'annonce par le nombre toujours croissant des jonques et barques qui sillonnent le canal; au fur et \u00e0 mesure que nous avan\u00e7ons nous percevions de plus en plus distinctement dans le lointain, \u00e0 travers la brume du matin, un amas \u00e9tendu de maisons \u00e9clair\u00e9es par le soleil levant et domin\u00e9 par une haute pagode, sp\u00e9cimen classique de l'architecture chinoise, puis de grises murailles dont les cr\u00e9neaux se d\u00e9coupaient sur l'azur du ciel: c'\u00e9tait Sou-tch\u00e9ou. Au dessus, fermant l'horizon et \u00e0 peine visibles derri\u00e8re un voile de brouillard, se dessinaient une cha\u00eene de hautes collines. Ces hauteurs bordent le \u592a\u6e56 T'ai-hou ou Grand lac dont la plaine liquide se d\u00e9veloppe \u00e0 l'ouest de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, et, se continuant dans le lac m\u00eame, y forment quelques grandes \u00eeles et un grand nombre d'ilots.\n\nApr\u00e8s deux heures environ de navigation, nous atteignions les faubourgs: \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e se voyaient les ruines d'un pont d\u00e9truit par les rebelles t'a\u00ef-p'ing; partout on retrouve encore aujourd'hui les traces du passage de ces vandales chinois. On dirait que le gouvernement laisse subsister \u00e0 dessein ces vestiges pour servir d'enseignement aux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations futures. Le long des rives, \u00e0 droite et \u00e0 gauche, de nombreux trains d'arbres \u00e9quarris sont rang\u00e9s sym\u00e9triquement tout contre les immenses chantiers o\u00f9 la scie doit les diviser en planches de toutes dimensions.\n\nLes faubourgs travers\u00e9s nous entrions dans la ville par la porte de Lou (\u5a41\u9580 Lou-meun), appel\u00e9e aussi \u6771\u9580 toung-meun, porte de l'est: celle-ci se compose de trois forts bastions dont le premier est coiff\u00e9 d'un pavillon \u00e9lev\u00e9 qui sert de corps-\nLA MONTAGNE DE LA TERRASSE DIVINE.\n\nDessin\u00e9 par A.

Voici ce que les Annales rapportent sur\nson origine:\n\n\u00c0 l'\u00e9poque de l'ancienne dynastie des \u5468 Tch\u00e9ou, la princ\u00e9-\npaut\u00e9 de \u5433 Vou, qui occupait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame pays,\nd\u00e9sign\u00e9 aujourd'hui sous le nom de province du Kiang-sou,\n\u00e9tait sous la domination d'un prince appel\u00e9 \u95a9\u95a9\u738b 'H\u00f4-lu\nouang, le roi 'H\u00f4-lu. Ce souverain r\u00e9gna de l'an 514 \u00e0 l'an\n416 avant notre \u00e8re. En 484, 'H\u00f4-lu, dont la capitale \u00e9tait\nalors \u00e0 \u6885\u91cc Mei-li, non loin de l'actuelle \u5e38\u5dde\u5e9c Tch'ang-\ntch\u00e9ou-fou, voulut transporter sa r\u00e9sidence dans un endroit\nplus favorable et plus au centre de son \u00c9tat. Sur les conseils\nde son c\u00e9l\u00e8bre ministre \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5 Vou Tseu-siu, il fit choix de\nl'emplacement o\u00f9 s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent Sou-tch\u00e9ou et y fit b\u00e2tir\nune ville. Cette cit\u00e9 eut huit portes, autant de portes d'eau\net quarante sept li de tour. H\u00f4-lu y fit \u00e9lever une tour\nimmense du sommet de laquelle on apercevait toute la princi-\npaut\u00e9 de Vou : c'est du nom de cette tour \u59d1\u8607\u81fa Kou-sou-\npai, Terrasse de Kou-sou, qu'est d\u00e9riv\u00e9 l'ancien nom de\n\n---\n\n1.

Par cons\u00e9quent il faut 8 li pour\nfaire une de nos lieues fran\u00e7aises.\n3. Cette tour fut construite en neuf ans (\u7d93\u71df\u4e5d\u5e74\u59cb\u6210) : elle\navait 300 tchang de haut ; du sommet on pouvait voir \u00e0 plus de 300 li. Pour\ny monter on avait fait un chemin sinueux (\u4f5c\u4e5d\u66f2\u8def\u4ee5\u767b\u4e4b).

Plus tard, deux des portes furent condamn\u00e9es, mais, pour en perp\u00e9tuer le souvenir, on en grava les noms sur le mur qui les rempla\u00e7a. Les murs furent r\u00e9par\u00e9s en 1662.\n\nLa Sou-tch\u00e9ou de nos jours a une \u00e9tendue moins consid\u00e9rable : elle n'a que quarante-cinq li de circonf\u00e9rence ; les murs ont 5605 *tchang* de longueur : ils ont deux *tchang* huit *tch'e* de haut et un *tchang* huit *tch'e* d'\u00e9paisseur.

Sauf la petite porte de l'ouest, toutes ont des *chouei-lou*, passages pour les eaux ou portes d'eau. Chacune d'entre elles est surmont\u00e9e d'un grand kiosque ou pavillon o\u00f9 sont casern\u00e9s quelques soldats sous le commandement d'un mandarin militaire. Les murailles ont 57 bastions, 3051 cr\u00e9neaux et 157 tours.\n\nSou-tch\u00e9ou, capitale ou chef-lieu de la province du Kiang-sou, est le si\u00e8ge du gouvernement provincial.

Aujourd'hui elle est bien d\u00e9chue de son ancienne splendeur et le vieux proverbe tant de fois cit\u00e9 \"En haut est le temple du ciel (le paradis); ici bas sont Hang-tch\u00e9ou et Sou-tch\u00e9ou\" 1 a\n\n1. \u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\u4e0b\u6709\u8607\u676d Chang g\u00e9ou fien-t'ang, hia g\u00e9ou Sou \"Hang,\"\ncess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre vrai. Sou-tch\u00e9ou n'est plus le paradis terrestre des temps pass\u00e9s et la pointure qu'en faisaient au dernier si\u00e8cle nos missionnaires (lesquels la comparaient \u00e0 Venise) diff\u00e8re notablement de ce que l'on voit \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. La derni\u00e8re r\u00e9bellion des Hommes \u00e0 grands cheveux, d'une part, qui en a d\u00e9truit une partie (rus in urbe) et br\u00fbl\u00e9 ses faubourgs, et d'autre part, la proximit\u00e9 de Changha\u00ef, ce Paris de l'Extr\u00eame Orient, ont port\u00e9 un coup mortel \u00e0 la splendeur de Sou-tch\u00e9ou. Maintenant, c'est \u00e0 Changha\u00ef que les jeunes gens de qualit\u00e9 vont d\u00e9vorer leur fortune, que les mandarins retrait\u00e9s vont jouir des \u00e9cus amass\u00e9s durant leur administration : la pr\u00e9sence et la conduite des europ\u00e9ens les excite et les stimule. Nombre d'entre eux imitent les \"diablos \u00e9trangers\" et, tout habill\u00e9s de soie et de satin, le nez orn\u00e9 d'une large paire de lunettes \u00e0 monture en \u00e9caille ou en or, conduisent \u00e0 grandes guides leur dog-cart ou leur hansomette sur la route de Bubblingwell, \u00e0 l'instar des chefs ou employ\u00e9s des maisons de commerce anglaises et am\u00e9ricaines.\n\nA l'heure qu'il est, Sou-tch\u00e9ou est d\u00e9sert, triste et morne : ses canaux, jadis encombr\u00e9s, ne sont plus parcourus que par un petit nombre de jonques de passage. Les fameux \u82b1\u8239 Hou\u00e1-tch'ouan ou bateaux de fleurs \"qui, au dire du P. Martini, ne sont destin\u00e9s que pour le seul plaisir et divertissement, tous enrichis d'or et peints des couleurs les plus vives, plus semblables \u00e0 des maisons magnifiques qu'\u00e0 des vaisseaux\" sont loin d'\u00eatre aussi nombreux qu'au temps jadis. \u00c0 peine en voit-on encore quelques uns, \u00e0 sculptures finements dor\u00e9es, \u00e0 lanternes multicolores qui semblent errer \u00e7a et l\u00e0 comme des \u00e2mes en peine, mais les belles personnes fleuries (\u82b1\u5a18 'hou\u00e1-niang) qui les habitent ne voient plus, au son de leurs instruments ou aux modulations de leurs chants, accourir une foule de jeunes gens aussi nombreuse et aussi distingu\u00e9e qu'auparavant.\n\nLes femmes de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, dont la beaut\u00e9 est proverbiale dans toute la Chine, sont encore les plus belles chinoises de l'empire. Il nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 d'en voir qui, toutes fard\u00e9es qu'elles fussent, pourraient plaire \u00e0 des europ\u00e9ens. Ces\nh\u00e9ta\u00efres ont quelque chose en soi de gracieux et d'original qui ajoute un certain charme \u00e0 leur personne. Elles savent toujours s'habiller avec go\u00fbt : elles portent de jolies robes de soie ou de satin \u00e0 couleurs voyantes, recouvertes d'un caraco non moins riche ; leur chevelure, orn\u00e9e de fleurs vari\u00e9es, s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve dans les airs, selon l'expression du po\u00e8te chinois, \"semblable \u00e0 un amas de nuages\" ; leurs sourcils sont l\u00e9g\u00e8rement noircis et allong\u00e9s en forme d'arc ; leurs yeux sont \"plus purs que l'eau des rivi\u00e8res en automne\" et leur voix est douce \"comme la brise l\u00e9g\u00e8re du printemps.\" Une mince couche de fard et de carmin recouvre leurs joues et leurs l\u00e8vres ; de longues boucles d'oreilles d'or ou d'argent font fl\u00e9chir leurs oreilles, et des bracelets cisel\u00e9s ornent leurs fins poignets. Leur d\u00e9marche m\u00eame, rendue balanc\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de leurs petits pieds (d\u00e9formit\u00e9 cach\u00e9e sous d'\u00e9l\u00e9gants souliers brod\u00e9s), ne laisse pas d'\u00eatre fort gracieuse : \u00e0 les voir marcher on dirait un fr\u00eale bambou secou\u00e9 par la brise. Tel est en peu de mots le crayon des beaut\u00e9s de Sou-tch\u00e9ou.\n\nMais le r\u00e8gne de ces h\u00e9ta\u00efres ne sera peut-\u00eatre plus de longue dur\u00e9e : du moins leur pouvoir sur les chinois raffin\u00e9s semble s'affaiblir. Ces derniers ne sont pas insensibles aux charmes de quelques dames europ\u00e9ennes ou am\u00e9ricaines, de m\u0153urs faciles et de commerce agr\u00e9able, qu'ils ont pu admirer \u00e0 Changha\u00ef, et l'engouement pour les beaut\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res tend \u00e0 se propager parmi les chinois de qualit\u00e9. Encore que leur type diff\u00e8re notablement de celui des chinoises, il semble qu'il ait un certain attrait pour les habitants du C\u00e9leste Empire. On a racont\u00e9 qu'un riche mandarin quiaida le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre commissaire imp\u00e9rial Ki-Yng \u00e0 conclure avec M. de Lagren\u00e9e le trait\u00e9 franco-chinois de 1844, Pan Tseu-tchen, avait voulu se passer la fantaisie d'avoir une femme europ\u00e9enne, mais que le prix qu'on lui demandait pour une jeune br\u00e9silienne \u00e9tant trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour sa bourse, il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit \u00e0 faire confectionner et rev\u00eatir de v\u00eatements europ\u00e9ens un mannequin de carton ayant les traits d'une europ\u00e9enne.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9.

Le mandarin tomba en admiration devant elle et en suivit avec plaisir tous les mouvements : puis, comme elle sortait, il dit au mari :\n\n\u2014 Combien donn\u00e2tes-vous pour votre femme ?\n\u2014 Oh ! r\u00e9pliqua le mari souriant \u00e0 l'erreur singuli\u00e8re du visiteur, deux mille dollars !\n\nIl pensait que notre mandarin se r\u00e9crierait.\u2014Eh bien! r\u00e9partit celui-ci d'un air grave tout en feuilletant son portefeuille, donnez-la moi et je vous donnerai cinq mille dollars.\n\n\u00c9tonnement du mari qui refuse naturellement : le mandarin va jusqu'\u00e0 sept mille dollars. Le n\u00e9gociant se d\u00e9cide alors \u00e0 lui dire que les europ\u00e9ens n'avaient pas coutume de vendre ainsi leurs femmes : le mandarin se retira tout d\u00e9confit.\n\nLes beaut\u00e9s de Sou-tch\u00e9ou n'\u00e9taient pas toutes confin\u00e9es dans les bateaux de fleurs : elles avaient surtout, et c'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l'on peut principalement les voir aujourd'hui, des maisons particuli\u00e8res orn\u00e9es de tout le luxe chinois, d'o\u00f9 elles se r\u00e9pandaient dans les c\u00e9l\u00e8bres jardins de plaisir.\n\nAu temps de la splendeur de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, ces fameux jardins, actuellement encore les plus beaux ornements de cette cit\u00e9, \u00e9taient le rendez-vous de la jeunesse dor\u00e9e de la province. Au bord des \u00e9tangs factices ou dans les kiosques \u00e9l\u00e9gamment perch\u00e9s sur des amas de rocs fantastiques, on dressait des tables servies avec luxe, et une foule de jeunes gens, les gommeux de l'endroit et de l'\u00e9poque, tout v\u00eatus de soie et de satin, venait s'y divertir, discourir, boire en compagnie le vin et le th\u00e9 que leur offraient des jeunes filles d'une s\u00e9duisante beaut\u00e9, et admirer les saules pleureurs \"dont le feuillage, baignant dans l'onde, ressemblait, lorsqu'il \u00e9tait secou\u00e9 par un coup de vent, \u00e0 la longue chevelure qu'une na\u00efade, au sortir des ondes, agiterait autour d'elle en faisant jaillir une nu\u00e9e de perles.\" D'autres, se tenant par la main, se promenaient dans les all\u00e9es tortueuses, devaient ensemble ou badinaient d'une mani\u00e8re aimable avec les jeunes filles ; d'autres encore, assis \u00e0\nl'ombre des bosquets, faisaient entendre des chants et jouaient de la fl\u00fbte, ou bien, anim\u00e9s par la verve po\u00e9tique, se livraient des joutes de po\u00e9sies sur les m\u00eames rimes et tra\u00e7aient avec gr\u00e2ce et l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 de beaux caract\u00e8res qui rappellaient, comme parlent les chinois, \"le vol du dragon et l'agilit\u00e9 du serpent.\" Le son des instruments alternait avec les brillantes modulations des oiseaux cach\u00e9s dans le feuillage.\n\nH\u00e9las! les temps sont bien chang\u00e9s: o\u00f9 sont les neiges d'antan? Il vint un jour o\u00f9 les autorit\u00e9s de la ville, prises subitement d'une rage d'aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de vertu, d\u00e9fendirent aux \"irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res\" de venir planter leurs tentes dans les jardins. Ceux-ci perdirent tout attrait et ne furent plus fr\u00e9quent\u00e9s par les \u00e9tudiants qui, au lieu de s'enfoncer dans la lecture et l'\u00e9tude des monuments litt\u00e9raires chinois les plus inintelligibles, accouraient s'y livrer \u00e0 de joyeux \u00e9bats. Puis arriva la redoutable r\u00e9bellion aux mains de vandales qui br\u00fbla les faubourgs, d\u00e9vasta les palais, renversa les jardins, massacra ou enleva la population, et, derri\u00e8re elle, l'arm\u00e9e imp\u00e9riale imitant dans la victoire la conduite sanglante des vaincus. \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, les jardins renomm\u00e9s, r\u00e9par\u00e9s tant bien que mal, existent encore; mais la vogue a disparu: ils sont d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s, ils sont morts. Le r\u00e8gne des h\u00e9ta\u00efres est fini, et quelques curieux viennent seulement visiter de temps \u00e0 autre ces lieux de d\u00e9lices pass\u00e9es.\n\nEncore que bien diff\u00e9rents des n\u00f4tres, ces jardins ont un cachet d'originalit\u00e9, un charme singulier et sui generis. Du reste, le chinois est n\u00e9 paysagiste et sait, m\u00eame dans un espace restreint, imiter la nature. Ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 y trouver, comme dans les n\u00f4tres, de longues all\u00e9es bord\u00e9es et ombrag\u00e9es de grands et beaux arbres, bien ratiss\u00e9es et sem\u00e9es de sable fin, ni des pelouses verdoyants encadr\u00e9es d'une corbeille de fleurs multicolores, ni des bassins o\u00f9 des cygnes se baignent sous la ros\u00e9e perl\u00e9e d'un jet d'eau, ni encore des statues plus ou moins mythologiques, plus ou moins v\u00eatues, qui semblent narguer les promeneurs: non, rien de tout cela; rien qui rappelle les Tuileries, les Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, le Bois de Boulogne ou les Jardins de\nVersailles. Allez dans les plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres jardins de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, le \u62d9\u653f\u5712 Tchou\u00f4-tcheng yuan, le \u6ec4\u6d6a\u4ead Ts\u2019ang-lang-t\u2019ing, le \u7345\u5b50\u6797 Che-tseu-lin, vous y verrez de petits \u00e9tangs garnis de n\u00e9nuphars, au centre desquels s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent, sur des pyramides de rochers factices, d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9gants kiosques \u00e0 toits recourb\u00e9s dont les colonnes peintes et les poutres sculpt\u00e9es sont orn\u00e9es de dragons aux couleurs \u00e9clatantes.\u2014Dans ces kiosques se trouvent des tables de marbre poli et des chaises en bois de fer : c\u2019est l\u00e0 que les lettr\u00e9s aiment \u00e0 prendre le th\u00e9 en fumant, en devisant, ou en composant des vers inspir\u00e9s par la vue de l\u2019eau, des poissons ou des saules agit\u00e9s par le vent. Ces kiosques sont reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres par de petits chemins \u00e9troits et rocailleux, qui prom\u00e8nent leurs m\u00e9andres \u00e0 travers l\u2019\u00e9tang : quelques uns sont en mosa\u00efque repr\u00e9sentant des animaux fantastiques. Vous verrez tout autour du jardin des galeries couvertes bord\u00e9es de saules, puis, \u00e7a et l\u00e0, des pavillons avec ou sans \u00e9tage dont les salles sont orn\u00e9es d\u2019inscriptions, de vieilles peintures ou d\u2019objets d\u2019art europ\u00e9ens, des petits ponts de bois ou de rochers jet\u00e9s hardiment d\u2019un kiosque \u00e0 l\u2019autre, des grottes \u00e0 rochers fantastiques (qui sont cens\u00e9s repr\u00e9senter des dragons, des ph\u00e9nix, des \u00e9l\u00e9phants et autres animaux extraordinaires) quelque fois des arbres microscopiques \u00e0 qui la main du jardinier a donn\u00e9 une forme \u00e9trange.\n\nLes jardins chinois sont aussi enfantins que le peuple qui les a imagin\u00e9s : le coup d\u2019\u0153il en est fort gracieux et l\u2019on est tout \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 avec laquelle le Le N\u00f4tre chinois est parvenu \u00e0 amonceler tant de choses dans un si petit espace ;\u2014on se figure le jardin beaucoup plus grand qu\u2019il n\u2019est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 : gr\u00e2ce aux chemins sinueux et aux galeries serpentines dont on est oblig\u00e9 de suivre tous les d\u00e9tours, c\u2019est un trompe-l\u2019\u0153il perp\u00e9tuel.\n\nLe premier jardin que nous visitons est le \u62d9\u653f\u5712 Tchou\u00f4-tcheng-yuan, le jardin de la lente administration : il est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 peu de distance de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 nous avons jet\u00e9 l\u2019ancre et donne sur la rue c\u00f4toy\u00e9e par le canal qui traverse la ville de l\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019ouest. C\u2019est l\u2019un des plus grands et des mieux entre-\ntenus : \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e est un bureau o\u00f9 chaque visiteur donne une douzaine de sap\u00e8ques. On exige cette modique somme, d'abord pour subvenir \u00e0 l'entretien du jardin, puis, disent les chinois, pour emp\u00eacher d'entrer toute autre personne que des lettr\u00e9s et des gens distingu\u00e9s.\n\nIl s'y trouve plusieurs kiosques \u00e0 tables de marbre et quelques pavillons \u00e0 parois tapiss\u00e9es de nombreuses curiosit\u00e9s : plaques de marbre de \u5927\u7406\u5e9c T\u0101-li-fou, (ville du Yun-nan renomm\u00e9e pour cette production), dont les veines naturelles repr\u00e9sentent des paysages vari\u00e9s ; grandes glaces europ\u00e9ennes achet\u00e9es \u00e0 Shanghai et portant encore l'\u00e9tiquette du marchand \u00e9tranger qui les a fournies ; pendules \u00e9galement \u00e9trang\u00e8res qui, mal remont\u00e9es, battent la campagne ; laques du Japon, etc.\n\nAu centre d'un petit lac s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve sur des rochers un kiosque \u00e9l\u00e9gant : quatre ponts de rocailles y aboutissent. On lit sur le fronton l'inscription suivante :\n\n\u8377\u98a8\u56db\u9762\nLe parfum du lotus s'exhale de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s.\n\nUn grand pavillon, \u00e9galement au milieu d'un \u00e9tang, porte le nom de \"Pavillon d'o\u00f9 l'on voit les montagnes;\"\u00b9 au premier \u00e9tage sont les tablettes de plusieurs anciens hauts dignitaires de la province. Un b\u00e2timent sp\u00e9cial, le \u7b46\u82b1\u5802 Pi-hou\u00e1-t'ang, Salle des pinceaux et des fleurs, est destin\u00e9 aux inscriptions : les murs en sont tapiss\u00e9s. Dans la pi\u00e8ce du centre on lit l'inscription suivante due \u00e0 un pr\u00e9fet de Sou-tch\u00e9ou de la dynastie actuelle ;\n\n\u6c42\u901a\u6c11\u60c5\n\u9858\u805e\u5df2\u904e\nJe d\u00e9sire p\u00e9n\u00e9trer les sentiments du peuple ;\nJe veux entendre parler de mes propres fautes.\n\nDans une autre salle sont appendus au mur deux \u9762\u5b50 touei-t'seu ou pancartes dont les caract\u00e8res se r\u00e9pondent mutuellement l'un \u00e0 l'autre ; en voici la traduction :\n\n1. \u898b\u5c71\u6a13 Kien chan lou.\nIl existe encore de bons principes dans les familles; Ceux qui exercent des charges doivent les prendre pour guide. Une galerie couverte fait tout le tour du jardin; c'est le \"chemin \u00e0 l'ombre des saules\" (\u67f3\u9670\u8def\u66f2).\n\nDans un des angles est une petite grotte compos\u00e9e de rochers fantastiques: quelques orchid\u00e9es poussent entre les fissures. Partout des arbres, des arbustes, des fleurs, des plantes de toute nature.\n\nPar une petite porte ronde perc\u00e9e dans le mur \u00e0 l'angle sud-est, on passe dans un petit enclos annexe. C'est le \u6787\u6777\u5712 pi-pa-yuan, jardin des Pi-pa. Le pi-pa, en dialecte du pays bi-b\u00f4, est la n\u00e8fle du Japon, Eriobotrya japonica. Il y a dans cet enclos un certain nombre de ces arbres charg\u00e9s d'excellens fruits: les chinois pr\u00e9tendent que l'on peut en manger autant que l'on veut sans inconv\u00e9nient \u00e0 la seule condition d'en avaler la peau.\n\nSur le mur, un fac\u00e9tieux lettr\u00e9, sans doute apr\u00e8s l'absorption de quelques tasses de vin \"\u00e0 l'ombre des bambous\", a trac\u00e9 les quatre lignes suivantes qui renferment un calembourg. Celui-ci roule sur ce que le nom de la guitare et celui de l'Eriobotrya japonica se prononcent \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s de m\u00eame p'i-pa encore qu'ils s'\u00e9crivent diff\u00e9remment.\n\n\u6787\u6777\u4e0d\u662f\u9019\u7435\u7436 \u82e5\u662f\u7435\u7436\u80fd\u7d50\u679c \u53ea\u70ba\u7576\u5e74\u8b58\u5b57\u5dee \u6eff\u57ce\u7c2b\u9f13\u76e1\u958b\u82b1\n\n\"Le P'i-pa (l'Eriobotrya japonica) n'est pas la m\u00eame chose que le p'i-pa (guitare): ce n'est qu'un lapsus commis jadis par quelqu'un qui a confondu les caract\u00e8res. Si le p'i-pa (guitare) pouvait avoir des fruits, les flageolets et les tambours se couvriraient de fleurs dans toute la ville.\"\n\nEn face du Tchou\u00e9-tcheng yuan, mais de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du canal, est le \u7345\u5b50\u6797 che-tseu-lin, For\u00eat du Lion, jardin qui\n\n1. Notons en passant que les chinois appellent ce genre de portes \u6708\u4eae\u9580 yu\u00e8-l\u00e9ung meun, porte en forme de lune.\nm\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre visit\u00e9. Sous la dynastie mongole il y avait sur son emplacement un petit temple o\u00f9 un bonze c\u00e9l\u00e8bre de la province enseignait la Loi (\u6cd5 Fa-dharma) aux fid\u00e8les. L'Empereur K'ang-hi, dans ses excursions dans le sud de la Chine, le visita plusieurs fois. Sous le r\u00e8gne de K'ien-loung, il fut achet\u00e9 par un fonctionnaire qui en fit un jardin de plaisir avec kiosques, lacs, pierres fantastiques. Il s'y trouvait cinq vieux pins, d'o\u00f9 le nom vulgaire donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jardin : le jardin des cinq pins (\u4e94\u677e\u5712 ou-soung-yuan).\n\nEn suivant la rue parall\u00e8le au canal nous arrivons au \u5929\u540e\u5bae T'ien-h\u00e9ou-koung, Palais de la Reine du Ciel. La Reine du Ciel, ou, comme l'appellent encore les Chinois, la M\u00e8re c\u00e9leste aux bons pr\u00e9sages, est la divinit\u00e9 bouddhique M\u00f4li-tch\u00e9 tien-pou-s\u00e2, c'est \u00e0 dire le Bodhisatva Maritchi d\u00e9va. Dans la mythologie indienne, c'est la personnification de la lumi\u00e8re. La statue de la d\u00e9esse est plac\u00e9e sous verre : c'est une grande femme ayant huit bras, dont deux tiennent en l'air les embl\u00e8mes du soleil et de la lune. De chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 sont des statues \u00e0 l'air effroyable, peintes de vives couleurs, qui semblent servir de garde d'honneur \u00e0 la d\u00e9esse. Devant l'autel que la statue surmonte, trois br\u00fble-parfums en bronze ancien. Tout aupr\u00e8s, comme les marchands de cierges dans nos \u00e9glises, se tient un marchand de chandelles parfum\u00e9es, de petits b\u00e2tons en \u00e9corce d'\u00e9rable broy\u00e9e et de bateaux de papier argent\u00e9 qu'on a coutume de br\u00fbler en l'honneur de la divinit\u00e9.\n\n\u00c0 un quart d'heure de l\u00e0, nous d\u00e9bouchons sur la place du \u5317\u5bfa\u5854 Pei-sseu-t'a, Pagode du temple septentrional. Cette pagode, l'une des plus belles qui existent en Chine, a neuf \u00e9tages ; chose curieuse ! elle est encore presque intacte, elle semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e par les rebelles et les imp\u00e9riaux qui d'ordinaire faisaient bon march\u00e9 de semblables monuments. Par contre, le grand temple et la bonzerie ont fort souffert du\n\n1. \u5409\u7965\u5929\u6bcd Ki-siang tien-mou.\n2. \u6469\u5229\u652f\u5929\u83e9\u8428\nLA GRANDE PAGODE DE SOU-TCHEOU.\n\nD'apr\u00e8s un dessin chinois.\nsi\u00e8ge de 1863 et sont rest\u00e9s tels quels depuis cette \u00e9poque. Moyennant quelques sap\u00e8ques, un vieux bonze, cass\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e2ge et les austerit\u00e9s, nous ouvre la porte de la pagode : nous entrons avec quelques provinciaux venus \u00e9galement pour visiter Sou-tch\u00e9ou et d\u00e9sireux de contempler la ville du haut du monument \u00e9lev\u00e9, comme \u00e0 Paris nos provinciaux vont admirer la Babylone moderne du sommet des tours Notre-Dame ou de la Colonne Vend\u00f4me.\n\nAu-dessus de la porte de l\u2019escalier on lit Young-chien-pa\u00f4-kouang, Aur\u00e9ole \u00e9tincelante qui brille d\u2019un vif \u00e9clat. \u00c0 chaque \u00e9tage, des niches pratiqu\u00e9es dans le mur int\u00e9rieur renferment des figures assises du Bouddha. L\u2019escalier a 218 marches.\n\nDu sommet de la pagode on jouit d\u2019une vue splendide sur Sou-tch\u00e9ou et les environs. \u00c0 nos pieds s\u2019\u00e9tend une vaste mer brune de tuiles verniss\u00e9es, de toitures heriss\u00e9es de toits recourb\u00e9es et de chim\u00e8res fantastiques, d\u2019o\u00f9 \u00e9mergent les mats de pavillon des Yamen avec leurs longues banderolles flottant au gr\u00e9 des vents, et quelques petites pagodes tout honteuses \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la n\u00f4tre : \u00e7a et l\u00e0, des \u00eelots de verdure entrecoupant la monotonie du paysage, et des espaces vides o\u00f9 pousse l\u2019herbe inculte, cach\u00e9e sous des amas de briques ou des monceaux de tuiles bris\u00e9es. C\u2019est la ville immense avec ses jardins, ses pelouses et ses ruines. Pr\u00e8s des remparts, surtout au sud, sont encore de vastes emplacements couverts de d\u00e9bris de maisons et de palais, souvenirs vivants du si\u00e8ge.\n\nAu temps de sa splendeur, Sou-tch\u00e9ou comptait une population de plusieurs millions d\u2019habitants : \u00e0 peine aujourd\u2019hui renferme-t-elle dans ses murs deux cent \u00e0 deux cent cinquante mille \u00e2mes. C\u2019est du moins ce que l\u2019on peut pr\u00e9juger \u00e0 la vue de la ville.\n\nLe temps toujours clair nous permet de distinguer tous les d\u00e9tails du panorama que nous avons sous les yeux : \u00e0 travers une d\u00e9licate fum\u00e9e bleu\u00e2tre qui s\u2019\u00e9chappe des chemin\u00e9es en bouillonnant et qui se fond lentement avec le brouillard du\nmatin non encore dissip\u00e9 par le soleil, nous apercevons la campagne Sou-tch'ouienne, si l'on peut dire ainsi, et, \u00e0 l'ouest, parfaitement dessin\u00e9es, les hautes collines des bords du T'ai-hou. Une l\u00e9g\u00e8re brise vient secouer les petites clochettes suspendues aux angles du toit de la pagode et les fait tinter doucement et \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers.\n\nNous redescendons : on nous conduit pr\u00e8s de l\u00e0 \u00e0 une \u00e9cole d'enfants ; c'est un spectacle curieux \u00e0 voir mais assez \u00e9tonnant. Ne vous figurez pas une classe muette, pench\u00e9e sur des classiques et attentive aux explications d'un professeur : rien de tel. Au contraire, imaginez-vous une \u00e9cole turbulente, assourdissante, o\u00f9 chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve r\u00e9cite sa le\u00e7on \u00e0 haute et intelligible voix, chacun de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, ce qui forme le concert le plus discordant que l'on puisse entendre, tandis que le docte ma\u00eetre, aux larges lunettes sur le nez, relit avec d\u00e9lices, sans para\u00eetre se soucier de tout ce tapage, quelque vieil et incompr\u00e9hensible auteur. Le ma\u00eetre d\u00e9signe \u00e0 chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve le passage que celui-ci doit confier \u00e0 sa m\u00e9moire et lui donne la prononciation et le ton des caract\u00e8res qui s'y trouvent : l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve retourne \u00e0 sa place, et chante sa le\u00e7on de sa voix nasillarde ; puis, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, quand il la sait ou croit la savoir, il va se placer devant la table du ma\u00eetre en tournant le dos \u00e0 ce dernier qui a son livre en main, et la r\u00e9cite au milieu du vacarme de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nAu contraire de ce qui se passe chez nous, jamais le professeur, dans les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d'\u00e9cole, n'explique un ouvrage aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves. L'instruction et la m\u00e9thode d'enseigner des chinois sont bien diff\u00e9rentes des n\u00f4tres : en Chine, les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de l'enfance se passent \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter \u00e0 haute voix et \u00e0 apprendre par c\u0153ur sans en savoir en aucune fa\u00e7on le sens, les phrases de deux livres \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires tr\u00e8s difficiles par eux-m\u00eames, apr\u00e8s que le sien-cheng ou professeur a donn\u00e9 seulement la prononciation et le ton de tous les caract\u00e8res, et \u00e0 \u00e9crire ceux-ci sur des petits carr\u00e9s de papier s\u00e9par\u00e9s pour les retenir plus ais\u00e9ment et s'appliquer \u00e0 manier\nle pinceau. Il n\u2019est pas d\u2019enfant, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s plusieurs ann\u00e9es de classe, qui puisse vous expliquer une seule phrase des volumes qu\u2019il sait r\u00e9citer; les canoniques sont \u00e9tudi\u00e9s de m\u00eame: on ne fait appel qu\u2019\u00e0 la m\u00e9moire des \u00e9l\u00e8ves sans jamais d\u00e9velopper leur intelligence. Le mot de Montaigne: \u201cLa m\u00e9moire est l\u2019\u00e9tui de la science\u201d est bien plus vrai encore chez les chinois que tout autre peuple. Au d\u00e9but, la m\u00e9moire est tout, l\u2019intelligence, rien. C\u2019est seulement au bout de quatre ou cinq ans en moyenne, apr\u00e8s que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, au prix d\u2019efforts prodigieux, est parvenu \u00e0 retenir int\u00e9gralement, sans en comprendre une seule ligne, les ouvrages les plus inintelligibles de la litt\u00e9rature chinoise, que le professeur explique et commente alors ces derniers.\u00b9\n\nTelle est la m\u00e9thode ennuyeuse et peu intelligente que les jeunes chinois sont oblig\u00e9s de suivre: elle a au moins pour r\u00e9sultat de d\u00e9velopper leur m\u00e9moire d\u2019une fa\u00e7on prodigieuse: \u00e0 force d\u2019exercer cette facult\u00e9 les lettr\u00e9s arrivent \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter des tours de force vraiment remarquables, comme par exemple de r\u00e9citer des ouvrages entiers quelquefois dix ou vingt ans apr\u00e8s les avoir appris.\n\nEn sortant de l\u2019\u00e9cole nous traversons le canal; sur la rive gauche, presque vis-\u00e0-vis de la grande pagode, nous visitons le \u8ab2\u6851\u5712 K\u014d-sang-yuan, Jardin des M\u00fbriers, \u00e9tabli par un mandarin nomm\u00e9 Fan. On y voit des plantations de m\u00fbriers et une certaine quantit\u00e9 de grandes jarres en terre brune de Ningpo, enfonc\u00e9es en terre jusqu\u2019au bord, qui servent d\u2019aquariums. Des poissons de mille esp\u00e8ces diff\u00e9rentes, aux formes et couleurs plus ou moins extraordinaires, s\u2019y livrent \u00e0 des jeux fol\u00e2tres. Nous regrettons notre ignorance profonde en pisciculture qui ne nous permet pas de d\u00e9signer ces citoyens de la gent aquatique par leurs noms scientifiques, ni de reconna\u00eetre s\u2019il en est parmi eux qui soient inconnus en Europe.\n\n\u00b9 Voir notre traduction du \u6731\u67cf\u5eec\u5bb6\u8a13 Tchou P\u00f4-lou Kia-hiun, Instructions famili\u00e8res du Dr. Tchou P\u00f4-lou, P\u00e9king\u2014Paris 1881, pr\u00e9face.\nDe l\u00e0 nous traversons la ville enti\u00e8re du nord au sud; nous suivons, au milieu d'une foule demi-nue, bousculante, curieuse, une rue assez droite que flanquent de nombreuses boutiques: restaurants, th\u00e9s, chapeliers, tailleurs, marchands de soieries, ferblantiers, etc. Plusieurs parties de la rue sont couvertes de nattes, et garnies d'\u0153toffes et d'enseignes pendantes au dessus de la t\u00eate des passants. Il y r\u00e8gne une atmosph\u00e8re \u00e9touffante et une odeur particuli\u00e8re qui rappellent assez la fameuse rue des pharmaciens \u00e0 Canton. Nous voyons beaucoup de librairies \u00e0 rayons surcharg\u00e9s de volumes non reli\u00e9s, pos\u00e9s \u00e0 plat, d'o\u00f9 \u00e9mergent de petites bandes de papier portant le titre de l'ouvrage. Il se publie beaucoup de livres \u00e0 Sou-tch\u00e9ou: aussi y sont-ils \u00e0 bon march\u00e9. Les \u00e9ditions de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, connues des amateurs sous le nom de Sou-pan, planches de Sou (tch\u00e9ou), sont tr\u00e8s estim\u00e9es: elles sont fort nettes, et exemptes de fautes d'impression qui fourmillent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans les livres peu co\u00fbteux. Apr\u00e8s celles du palais de P\u00e9king, ce sont les meilleures de tout l'Empire.\n\n\u00c0 peu de distance du rempart m\u00e9ridional nous apercevons le Ouen-miao ou Temple de Confucius dont \"les murs d'enceinte brillent de l'\u00e9clat du vernillon.\" Il est semblable \u00e0 tous les autres: m\u00eame construction, m\u00eame salle, m\u00eames tablettes, m\u00eames inscriptions, et m\u00eame solitude. Dans les cours beaucoup d'herbes poussant entre les interstices des pav\u00e9s: partout un manque de soin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Du reste les autorit\u00e9s locales et les lettr\u00e9s n'y viennent que rarement pour y accomplir quelques c\u00e9r\u00e9monies, notamment quand il s'agit de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'illustre Saint les lettr\u00e9s re\u00e7us aux derniers examens.\n\nNon loin de l\u00e0, presque vis-\u00e0-vis le yamen du Siun-fou ou Gouverneur de la province, est le grand jardin appel\u00e9 \u6ec4\u6d6a\u4ead\n\n1. \u85cd\u677f\nTs'ang-lang-t'ing, Pavillons de Ts'ang-lang. Au dessus de la porte on lit : \u4e94\u767e\u540d\u8ce2\u7960 ou p\u00e0i m\u00edng hi\u00ean sseu, temple des cinq cents c\u00e9l\u00e8bres sages. Nous entrons moyennant une r\u00e9tribution d'une dizaine de sap\u00e8ques : comme ceux que nous avons vus, le jardin de Ts'ang-lang est rempli de jolis kiosques entour\u00e9s d'eau, de rochers fantastiques (notons une grotte factice form\u00e9e par ces rocs), de pavillons, de galeries, etc. Une grande salle contient les portraits des cinq cents sages accompagn\u00e9s de notices biographiques : le tout grav\u00e9 en blanc sur fond noir.\n\nEn face d'une autre jolie salle, \"le Temple de l'\u00e9clatante doctrine,\" se trouve un pavillon pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'une sc\u00e8ne : il para\u00eet que l'on y joue parfois la com\u00e9die.\n\nEn quittant le Ts'ang-lang-t'ing nous nous dirigeons \u00e0 nouveau vers le nord et, par un d\u00e9dale de petites rues,\n\n1. Ce nom de Ts'ang-lang est une allusion classique. Confucius, se promenant un jour avec ses disciples sur les bords d'un cours d'eau appel\u00e9 t'sang-lang (dans le Chan-toung, au dire des commentateurs), entendit un enfant qui chantait :\n\n\u6ec4\u6d6a\u4e4b\u6c34\u6e05\u516e\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u6fef\u6211\u7e93\n\u6ec4\u6d6a\u4e4b\u6c34\u6fc1\u516e\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u6fef\u6211\u8db3\n\nL'eau du Ts'ang-lang est elle pure ?\nJe pourrai y laver les franges de mon chapeau.\nL'eau du Ts'ang-lang est elle trouble ?\nJe pourrai y laver mes pieds.\n\nConfucius dit alors : \"Disciples ! Ecoutez cette chanson : si l'eau est pure, alors il y lavera les franges de son chapeau ; si l'eau est trouble, alors il y lavera ses pieds ; c'est lui-m\u00eame qui en d\u00e9cidera\" (Meng-tseu, \u4e0b\u5b5f Hi\u00e2-meng chap. I \u00a7 8.)\n\nLes po\u00e8tes ont vant\u00e9 la beaut\u00e9 du jardin de Ts'ang-lang ; voici quelques vers \u00e0 ce sujet :\n\nLe jardin de Ts'ang-lang est un endroit convenable pour inviter des amis :\nL'eau qui y coule est plus pure que celle des lacs et des sources.\nTous les fonctionnaires doivent la regarder pour devenir dignes et int\u00e8gres (aussi purs qu'elle).\n\nLorsqu'on se repose ici il faut penser au nom m\u00eame du jardin.\n\n2. \u660e\u9053\u5802 Ming-ta\u00f4 t'ang.\nd\u00e9bouchons sur une grande place \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de laquelle s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve le \u4e09\u6e05\u6bbf San-ts'ing-tien Temple des Trois Pures.\n\nCette grande et belle place est l'agora de Sou-tch\u00e9ou : l\u00e0 se donne rendez-vous en quelque sorte une foule m\u00e9lang\u00e9e, grouillante, bruyante, ondul\u00e9e en tous sens. Le paysan condoie le lettr\u00e9 ; le couli, le fonctionnaire. Tous vont et viennent, s'arr\u00eatent un instant aux devantures des petites boutiques, semblables \u00e0 celles qu'au jour de l'an l'on voit garnir les boulevards de Paris, ou se courbent pour examiner les \u00e9talages install\u00e9s par terre. Une vraie foire des environs de Paris. On y trouve tout ce qu'on d\u00e9sire : vaisselle neuve et ancienne, poteries, bibelots, bronzes, jouets, sucreries, vieux galons, tout git p\u00eale-m\u00eale sur de vieilles \u00e9toffes d\u00e9teintes par la pluie et le soleil. Ici, un marchand de vieux habits, install\u00e9 au centre de ses guenilles empil\u00e9es, rumine en silence en fumant sa pipe et daigne \u00e0 peine r\u00e9pondre aux questions de ceux qui lui demandent le prix de ses marchandises. L\u00e0, un autre exhibe de son \u00e9talage un collier de mandarin qui, peut-\u00eatre apr\u00e8s avoir orn\u00e9 le cou d'un vice-roi, est venu s'\u00e9chouer entre ses crasseuses mains. Voici un souan-ming-ti, diseur de bonne aventure, qui d\u00e9bite ses oracles embrouill\u00e9s \u00e0 la foule r\u00e9unie au tour de sa petite table : avec sa faconde habituelle il annonce \u00e0 celui-ci qu'il r\u00e9ussira \u00e0 tous ses examens, \u00e0 celui-l\u00e0 qu'il obtiendra un fils, ce desideratum de tous les chinois, \u00e0 cet autre il promet honneurs et fortune. On le consulte sur le choix d'un jour propice pour un mariage : aussit\u00f4t il sort d'un tiroir un petit volume rouge \u00e0 titre jaune et le feuilleta. Ce livre est le \u6642\u61b2\u66f8 che-chien-chou, Almanach Imp\u00e9rial compos\u00e9 par l'Observatoire Imp\u00e9rial de P\u00e9king : il indique les jours propices pour toutes les actions de la vie, les jours nefas pendant lesquels il est d\u00e9fendu de faire de la musique, de donner des festins, de se marier, d'aller au th\u00e9\u00e2tre, etc. Vient ensuite la liste des f\u00eates de l'ann\u00e9e, des jours o\u00f9 l'on peut b\u00e2tir une maison, puis des vingt-quatre termes solaires avec le lever et le coucher du soleil pour chaque jour de l'an suivant.\nla latitude de chaque place. Jusqu\u2019ici le volume est imprim\u00e9 en rouge, couleur d\u2019heureux augure. Suit, en noir, le calendrier m\u00eame donnant la liste des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies qu\u2019il faut accomplir chaque jour. Enfin, une liste de cycles et des animaux symboliques \u00e0 l\u2019usage des chiromanciens clot l\u2019ouvrage.\n\nTout \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, une foule compacte, bouche et yeux b\u00e9ants, admire un faiseur de tours qui, nu jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la ceinture, fait jaillir une pluie de petits morceaux de bambou de son nez, de ses yeux et de ses oreilles, ou bien avale cinq petites tasses et, une seconde apr\u00e8s, en fait sortir six de son gosier. Les mots \u6975\u602a\u6975\u602a k\u2019i-kouai, k\u2019i-kouai, c\u2019est extraordinaire, courent de bouches en bouches. Les chinois sont tr\u00e8s forts pour le \u53d8\u620f\u6cd5 pien-chi-f\u00fb, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire l\u2019escamotage : leurs tours ne d\u00e9paraient par la sc\u00e8ne de Robert Houdin.\n\nDevant un th\u00e9 dont les tables prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par des nattes regorgent de consommateurs qui hument une tasse de th\u00e9, d\u00e9cortiquent des graines s\u00e8ches de past\u00e8que, et tirent quelques bouff\u00e9es d\u2019une pipe \u00e0 eau, un m\u00e9decin ambulant, vendeur de drogues, a \u00e9tabli son \u00e9choppe. Il a des rem\u00e8des pour tous les maux, mais se garde bien de vous en indiquer la composition, ce sont autant de \u201csecrets de famille.\u201d Souffrez-vous des dents ? Il vous fait prendre une certaine poudre dont vous vous frottez la m\u00e2choire, puis vous enjoint de la cracher dans un bol plein d\u2019eau : l\u2019op\u00e9ration finie il retire triomphalement du bol un petit ver qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre la cause de votre mal. Avez-vous une jambe cass\u00e9e ? il vous donne une pommade infaillible qui ressoudera les parties disjointes, fera repousser l\u2019os broy\u00e9 et vous remettra sur pied comme si rien n\u2019\u00e9tait. Bien plus, il vous promet que vous marcherez m\u00eame mieux qu\u2019avant. La dysenterie la plus opini\u00e2tre vous couche-t-elle sur le flanc, vite, m\u00e2chez une racine sp\u00e9ciale, et vous serez gu\u00e9ris ! En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la plupart de ces drogues sont form\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments h\u00e9t\u00e9roclites, de dents de rhinoc\u00e9ros broy\u00e9es, d\u2019os fossiles r\u00e9duits en poudre, de mousse s\u00e8che, de peaux de serpents, etc. Quelquefois elles ont des effets surprenants, exag\u00e9r\u00e9s par la populace i-\ngnorante qui accorde toute confiance au m\u00e9decin ambulant.\n\nMais ce sont les conteurs qui attirent et retiennent autour d'eux le plus de badauds.\n\nDe m\u00eame qu'au Moyen \u00c2ge, chez nous, les troubadours allaient chanter leurs ballades de ch\u00e2teaux en ch\u00e2teaux, de m\u00eame aujourd'hui, en Chine, les conteurs, appel\u00e9s \u8aaa\u66f8\u7684 ch\u00f4-chou-ti, discours d'histoires, vont narrer leur r\u00e9pertoire de ville en ville, de province en province. Ces conteurs prennent leur bien un peu o\u00f9 ils le trouvent, dans les recueils de nouvelles ou de contes fantastiques, aussi bien que dans les annales dont ils arrangent \u00e0 leur mani\u00e8re les \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Ce genre de litt\u00e9rature est particuli\u00e8rement estim\u00e9 des chinois et, par suite, le narrateur est toujours s\u00fbr d'avoir nombreux auditoire; d'ailleurs les chinois y excellent. Dans l'art de raconter, a-t-on dit avec beaucoup de raison, ils ont une sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 qui ne semble pas contestable.\n\nLe conteur installe devant lui une petite table o\u00f9 il pose son \u00e9ventuil, sa pipe et sa tasse de th\u00e9, ins\u00e9parables compagnons de ses p\u00e9r\u00e9grinations, puis range autour, en rectangle ou en carr\u00e9, plusieurs rangs de longs bancs crasseux, luisants de graisse, o\u00f9 viennent s'assoir les auditeurs. Avant de commencer, il fait une collecte et chacun donne selon ses moyens, cinq, dix ou vingt sap\u00e8ques: il retrousse alors ses manches et attaque son r\u00e9cit, qu'il souligne de grimaces effrayantes ou accompagne de gestes path\u00e9tiques, selon les circonstances. Il tient ainsi son auditoire sous le charme pendant des heures enti\u00e8res. Sans quitter des yeux le narrateur, les uns bourrent leur pipe, aspirent quelques bouff\u00e9es, d\u00e9cortiquent des graines s\u00e8ches de past\u00e8que ou des noyaux de p\u00eaches, ou bien se livrent sous leurs habits \u00e0 une chasse g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fructueuse; les autres hument avec d\u00e9lices la tasse de th\u00e9 qu'un marchand ambulant leur tend pour deux sap\u00e8ques, ou d\u00e9vorent un petit pain cuit \u00e0 l'\u00e9tuv\u00e9e.\n\nIl y a souvent autour de ces conteurs une foule nombreuse que l'on peut \u00e9valuer sans exag\u00e9ration \u00e0 deux cents personnes. Sur les larges trottoirs des vastes et poudreux boulevards de\nP\u00e9king nous avons vu plus d'une fois des assistances encore plus consid\u00e9rables dont il ne serait pas agr\u00e9able de s'approcher trop pr\u00e8s; les gens du nord sont en effet plus sales que ceux du midi: si ceux-ci se lavent quelquefois, ceux-l\u00e0 ne le font jamais. Jugez de la r\u00e9pulsion que l'on \u00e9prouve, si on a un nerf olfactif tant soit peu d\u00e9licat, lorsqu'il faut longer une de ces cohues naus\u00e9abondes. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit que le bruit est l'atmosph\u00e8re des chinois: on pourrait dire avec autant de rait son que la salet\u00e9 est leur vie m\u00eame.\n\nComme nous nous approchons d'un de ces groupes populeux, nous voyons le conteur terminer sa collecte, retrousser ses manches et prendre place derri\u00e8re sa petite table. Ainsi qu'un orateur, il avale une gorg\u00e9e de th\u00e9 (le verre d'eau sucr\u00e9e antique et solennel) et commence son r\u00e9cit: nous l'\u00e9coutons avec attention, et, charm\u00e9 par sa diction, traduisons st\u00e9nographiquement le joli conte qu'il nous d\u00e9bite:\n\nYen-tche ou une cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre en Chine.\n\nSous le r\u00e8gne de l'empereur K'ang-hi (1662-1723) vivait dans la ville de Toung-tch'ang, province du Chan-toung, un certain Docteur Pien qui exer\u00e7ait la profession de v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire et avait pour sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 la gu\u00e9rison des maladies de l'esp\u00e8ce bovine. Pien avait une fille aussi intelligente que belle qu'il adorait jusqu'\u00e0 l'idol\u00e2trie: il aurait voulu lui trouver un mari de bonne extraction et de r\u00e9putation sans tache, mais malheureusement les notables et les lettr\u00e9s de la ville m\u00e9prisaient le docteur \u00e0 cause de sa pauvret\u00e9 et de son vil m\u00e9tier, et ne voulaient pas s'allier \u00e0 sa famille. Yen-tch\u00e9, tel \u00e9tait le nom de cette jeune beaut\u00e9, avait donc atteint l'\u00e2ge du mariage sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fianc\u00e9e.\n\nOr, en face de la maison de Pien, demeurait Madame Ouang, femme du nomm\u00e9 Si, personne peu honn\u00eate et de joyeuse vie, qui venait souvent dans le gyn\u00e9c\u00e9e du docteur discourir avec Yen-tch\u00e9. Un jour que cette derni\u00e8re reconduisait son amie jusqu'\u00e0 la porte de la maison, elle aper\u00e7ut un jeune homme\nd'une beaut\u00e9 peu commune v\u00eatue de blanc des pieds \u00e0 la t\u00eate, qui passait dans la rue. \u00c0 sa vue, la jeune fille fut comme frapp\u00e9e par la foudre et le suivit longtemps des yeux : le jeune homme, la t\u00eate baiss\u00e9e, continua rapidement sa marche sans voir qu'il \u00e9tait l'objet d'un examen si attentif. Il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 loin que Yen-tch\u00e9 le regardait encore et ne pouvait d\u00e9tourner les yeux de sa personne.\n\n\u2014Vous \u00eates si belle, dit \u00e0 la jeune fille Madame Ouang qui avait subrepticement observ\u00e9 ce qui se passait, que vous pourriez vous unir \u00e0 un si beau jeune homme : de la sorte vous n'auriez rien \u00e0 vous reprocher l'un l'autre.\n\nUn flot de carmin monta au visage de la jeune fille qui ne r\u00e9pondit point.\n\n\u2014Connaissez-vous ce monsieur ? lui demanda Madame Ouang.\n\n\u2014Non, r\u00e9pliqua Yen-tch\u00e9.\n\n\u2014Eh bien ! continua son amie, c'est le bachelier A\u00f4 qui demeure dans la rue M\u00e9ridionale : c'est le fils du licenci\u00e9 Tsi-\u00e9ou 'Hou\u00f4. Je le connais beaucoup, avant \u00e9t\u00e9 autrefois sa voisine. Il n'est aucun homme en ce monde qui ait un air aussi agr\u00e9able ; il porte actuellement des v\u00eatements blancs parceque le deuil qu'il porte \u00e0 cause de la mort de sa femme n'est pas encore termin\u00e9. Si vous voulez l'\u00e9pouser, il faut charger quelqu'un d'aller le trouver et lui dire d'envoyer un entremetteur.\n\nYen-tch\u00e9 ne r\u00e9pondit pas et laissa partir Madame Ouang riant de sa plaisanterie. Quelques jours s'\u00e9tant \u00e9coul\u00e9s sans qu'elle en eut des nouvelles, elle pensa que son ami n'avait pas en le temps d'aller voir le bachelier, ou que celui-ci, descendant d'un noble famille, ne voulait pas s'abaisser jusqu'\u00e0 elle. Elle \u00e9tait plong\u00e9e dans la plus compl\u00e8te incertitude : elle ne cessait de penser \u00e0 ce jeune lettr\u00e9. Elle en perdit peu \u00e0 peu le boire et le manger et tomba v\u00e9ritablement malade.\n\nSur ces entrefaites, Madame Ouang vint la voir et s'enquit de la cause de sa maladie.\n\n\u2014Je n'en sais rien moi-m\u00eame, r\u00e9pliqua la jeune fille, si ce n'est que depuis le jour o\u00f9 vous vintes me voir, et apr\u00e8s que\nnous e\u00fbmes pris cong\u00e9 l'une de l'autre, je me suis sentie mal \u00e0 mon aise. Maintenant je n'ai plus qu'un souffle de vie et sens que je vais bient\u00f4t expirer.\n\n\u2014Mon mari est parti pour les affaires de son commerce, dit Madame Ouang \u00e0 voix basse, et comme il n'est pas encore de retour, je n'ai eu personne sous la main pour avertir M. A\u00f4; n'est-ce pas l\u00e0 la cause de votre maladie?\n\nYen-tch\u00e9 rougit pendant tr\u00e8s longtemps et ne dit mot.\n\n\u2014C'est \u00e9videmment cela qui vous rend malade, continua en badinant Madame Ouang; qui vous arr\u00eate encore? Il faut le faire venir un soir pourquoi vous voie: s'y refusera-t-il?\n\n\u2014Ah! dit la jeune fille en soupirant, puisqu'il en est ainsi, oui, je ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de l'aimer. Je serais gu\u00e9rie certainement si, ne m\u00e9prisant pas ma condition obscure et ma pauvret\u00e9, il envoyait un entremetteur; mais jamais, jamais je ne lui accorderai de rendez-vous secret.\n\n\u2014Soit, r\u00e9partit Madame Ouang, et elle s'en alla.\n\nDans sa jeunesse, Madame Ouang, avait eu des relations avec un de ses voisins nomm\u00e9 Sou Ki\u00e9; celui-ci \u00e9piait le d\u00e9part du mari et, ce dernier parti, venait voir sa belle. Cette nuit l\u00e0 m\u00eame, Sou vint trouver Madame Ouang qui, pour plaisanter, lui raconta ce qu'avait dit Yen-tch\u00e9 et lui enjoignit en badinant d'aller avertir le bachelier A\u00f4. En entendant cela, Sou, qui depuis longtemps connaissait la beaut\u00e9 de Yen-tch\u00e9, se r\u00e9jouit secr\u00e8tement: il voyait l\u00e0 une occasion dont lui-m\u00eame pourrait profiter. Il allait faire part de son projet \u00e0 Madame Ouang, mais, se souvenant que celle-ci \u00e9tait excessivement jalouse et craignant d'amener une sc\u00e8ne, il se contenta de dire quelques mots en l'air et s'enquit avec soin de la situation de l'appartement de Yen-tch\u00e9 et des portes qui y donnaient acc\u00e8s.\n\nLa nuit suivante, il p\u00e9n\u00e9tra par escalade dans la maison du docteur et alla droit \u00e0 la chambre de la jeune fille: il frappa du doigt \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre.\n\n\u2014Qui est-l\u00e0? demanda Yen-tch\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9rieur.\n\n\u2014C'est moi, le bachelier A\u00f4, r\u00e9pondit Sou.\n\u2014Ah! dit la jeune fille, je pensais \u00e0 vous, et d\u00e9sirais, non pas vous voir une seule fois, mais \u00eatre unie \u00e0 vous pour toujours. Si vous m'aimez r\u00e9ellement, il faut que vous fassiez venir un entremetteur: je n'oserais vous accorder de rendez-vous secret.\n\nSou acquies\u00e7a \u00e0 ce qu'elle venait de dire mais la supplia instamment de lui permettre de serrer sa main en guise de gage: Yen-tch\u00e9 ne voulait pas qu'il entr\u00e2t, mais il parvint \u00e0 ouvrir la porte de force et p\u00e9n\u00e9tra dans la chambre. Il saisit la jeune fille dans ses bras: celle-ci, incapable de r\u00e9sister, tomba \u00e0 terre presque sans souffle...\n\n\u2014D'o\u00f9 vient ce m\u00e9chant homme? s'\u00e9cria-t-elle quand Sou voulut l'attirer \u00e0 lui. Vous n'\u00eates certainement pas M. A\u00f4: lui au moins a de bonne mani\u00e8res et est bien \u00e9lev\u00e9; me sachant malade, il me traiterait plus doucement. Pourquoi me rudoyer ainsi? si vous me touchez de nouveau, j'appelle au secours imm\u00e9diatement: on ne manquera pas d'accourir et votre r\u00e9putation en souffrira aussi bien que la mienne.\n\nCraignant que son d\u00e9guisement ne f\u00fbt d\u00e9couvert, Sou n'osa pas employer la violence \u00e0 nouveau, mais supplia Yen-tch\u00e9 de lui accorder un autre rendezvous. La jeune fille lui ayant r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne la reverrait que le jour de leur mariage, il r\u00e9pliqua que c'\u00e9tait une \u00e9poque encore bien lointaine et la pressa de nouveau. Yen-tch\u00e9, affaiblie, lui dit alors qu'il pourrait la revoir lorsqu'elle serait gu\u00e9rie, mais refusa de lui donner un gage quelconque; Sou lui saisit pour lors un des pieds, d\u00e9noua le soulier brod\u00e9 et allait l'emporter quand Yen-tch\u00e9 l'arr\u00eata par ces paroles:\n\n\u2014Que ne pourrais-je encore vous donner, puisque je me donne moi-m\u00eame \u00e0 vous? Mais je crains que l'on ne suppose ce qui n'est pas et qu'on ne jase sur notre compte. Je crois que vous ne me rendrez pas le vil objet que vous m'avez ravi: sachez qu'il ne me reste plus qu'\u00e0 mourir si vous ne m'\u00eates pas fid\u00e8le.\n\nSou sortit et alla demander g\u00eete \u00e0 Madame Ouang. Tout en reposant, il n'oubliait pas la pantoufle dont il s'\u00e9tait empar\u00e9 et il t\u00e2ta secr\u00e8tement la manche de sa tunique o\u00f9 il l'avait cach\u00e9e: elle n'y \u00e9tait plus!... Il se leva sur-le-champ et\nalluma une lampe : il chercha dans tous ses habits, mais en vain. Il ne r\u00e9pondit pas aux questions de Madame Ouang et soup\u00e7onna que celle-ci avait cach\u00e9 la pantoufle : ce soup\u00e7on \u00e9tait presque confirm\u00e9 par le sourire qui errait sur les l\u00e8vres de cette derni\u00e8re. Enfin, ne pouvant plus cacher ce qu'il avait fait, il se d\u00e9cida \u00e0 avouer tout. Quand il eut tout racont\u00e9, Madame Ouang et Sou prirent chacun une lampe et firent de nouvelles recherches aussi bien dans la chambre qu'au dehors, mais sans pouvoir rien trouver : chagrin de son action, Sou revint se coucher ; il esp\u00e9rait qu'il avait perdu la pantoufle en chemin et que, comme il faisait nuit, personne ne la trouverait. Le lendemain matin il reprit ses investigations, mais elles furent inutiles comme les premi\u00e8res.\n\nOr vivait dans la m\u00eame rue un nomm\u00e9 Ma\u00f4, l'ain\u00e9 de plusieurs fr\u00e8res, vaurien et vagabond qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 maintes fois, mais sans succ\u00e8s, poursuivi Madame Ouang de ses obsessions. Comme il savait que Sou avait des relations avec elle, il voulut profiter de ce que le mari \u00e9tait absent pour aller surprendre les deux amans en flagrant d\u00e9lit et forcer dans la suite Madame Ouang \u00e0 ne plus lui tenir rigueur. Le soir m\u00eame o\u00f9 Sou avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chez Yen-tch\u00e9, il mit son projet \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution : il poussa la porte de l'enclos de l'habitation de Madame Ouang et le verrou n'en ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9, s'introduisit facilement dans le jardin. \u00c0 peu de distance de la chambre de Madame Ouang il marcha sur un objet mou comme du satin : il le ramassa et vit que c'\u00e9tait une pantoufle de femme envelopp\u00e9e d'un mouchoir. Il se baissa pr\u00e8s de la fen\u00eatre pour \u00e9couter ce que disaient les deux amans, et entendit toute leur conversation : cela lui sugg\u00e9ra un plan nouveau ; il sortit content de l'enclos sans faire le moindre bruit.\n\nQuelques jours plus tard il s'introduisit le soir dans la maison de Yen-tch\u00e9 en franchissant le mur, mais, ne connaissant pas les lieux, alla frapper par erreur \u00e0 la chambre du docteur Pien. Celui-ci, r\u00e9veill\u00e9, regarda par la fen\u00eatre, et, voyant un homme, se douta d'apr\u00e8s son air et ses apparences qu'il devait \u00eatre venu pour sa fille : il se sentit transport\u00e9 de col\u00e8re, se saisit d'un\ncouteau et alla droit sur lui. Ma\u00f4, effray\u00e9, prit la fuite, mais au moment o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait sur le point de franchir le mur, serr\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s par Pien qui l'avait poursuivi, ne sachant o\u00f9 fuir, il se retourna tout-\u00e0-coup et arracha le couteau des mains du docteur. \u00c0 cette vue, la m\u00e8re de Yen-tch\u00e9, qui avait suivi son mari, poussa un cri terrible : Ma\u00f4, ne pouvant plus \u00e9chapper, plongea le couteau dans la t\u00eate de Pien . . . . . . .\n\nLa jeune fille, dont la sant\u00e9 allait un peu mieux et qui s'\u00e9tait lev\u00e9e en entendant du bruit, accourut sur ces entrefaites; sa m\u00e8re et elle \u00e9clair\u00e8rent le lieu de la sc\u00e8ne: le vieillard avait le cr\u00e2ne ouvert et ne pouvait plus parler. Un instant apr\u00e8s il rendait le dernier soupir. La m\u00e8re trouva au pied du mur une pantoufle brod\u00e9e et la reconnut comme appartenant \u00e0 sa fille: elle pressa celle-ci de questions. Yen-tch\u00e9 raconta en pleurant ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9: toutefois elle ne voulut pas compromettre Madame Ouang et dit que le bachelier A\u00f4 \u00e9tait venu de lui-m\u00eame.\n\nLe jour venu, on fit pr\u00e9venir le Tch\u00e9-hien ou Magistrat de district qui fit arr\u00eater A\u00f4: celui-ci, \u00e2g\u00e9 de dix-neuf ans, ne savait pas s'exprimer et rougissait comme un enfant \u00e0 la vue d'un \u00e9tranger. Il eut une peur \u00e9pouvantable et, amen\u00e9 au pr\u00e9toire, ne sut que dire. Ces apparences indispos\u00e8rent le magistrat contre lui: il le fit mettre \u00e0 la torture. Un lettr\u00e9 ne peut supporter un traitement aussi douloureux: aussi A\u00f4 avoua-t-il qu'il \u00e9tait coupable. Il fut conduit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9fecture o\u00f9 il subit les m\u00eames tortures. Toutes les fois qu'il \u00e9tait confront\u00e9 avec Yen-tch\u00e9, celle-ci l'accablait d'invectives et de mal\u00e9dications: A\u00f4, interdit, avait la langue pour ainsi dire li\u00e9e et ne savait que dire pour sa d\u00e9fense: il fut condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 mort.\n\nTous les magistrats qui examin\u00e8rent l'affaire furent du m\u00eame avis et crurent A\u00f4 coupable. Enfin l'affaire fut port\u00e9e en dernier ressort \u00e0 Tsi-nan-fou, capitale de la province du Chantoung, devant le tribunal du Gouverneur Vou Nan-tai, magistrat connu pour son intelligence et son int\u00e9grit\u00e9. D\u00e8s que Vou Nan-tai eut vu A\u00f4, il remarqua que celui-ci n'avait pas\nl'air d'un assassin : il envoya des gens l'interroger secr\u00e8tement et parvint peu \u00e0 peu \u00e0 lui faire dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Il vit bien que le bachelier A\u00f4 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement condamn\u00e9 et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit m\u00fbrement \u00e0 toute l'affaire pendant plusieurs jours. Il se d\u00e9clara \u00e0 recommencer les interrogatoires : il commen\u00e7a par Yen-tch\u00e9.\n\n\u2014 Quelqu'un a-t-il su, demanda-t-il, que vous aviez fix\u00e9 un rendez-vous avec le bachelier A\u00f4 ?\n\n\u2014 Personne, r\u00e9pondit la jeune fille.\n\n\u2014 Y avait-il d'autres personnes avec vous quand vous avez rencontr\u00e9 A\u00f4 ?\n\n\u2014 Personne, r\u00e9pliqua encore Yen-tch\u00e9.\n\nVou fit alors venir A\u00f4 et lui adressa quelques bonnes paroles pour l'encourager.\n\n\u2014 Lorsque je suis pass\u00e9 devant la porte de la maison, dit de lui-m\u00eame A\u00f4, je n'ai vu qu'une de mes anciennes voisines, Madame Ouang, qui sortait avec une jeune fille. J'ai march\u00e9 rapidement devant elles et ne leur ai pas adress\u00e9 une seule parole.\n\n\u2014 Vous venez de dire, s'\u00e9cria Vou en se tournant vers Yen-tch\u00e9, qu'il n'y avait personne avec vous ! Comment se fait-il qu'il y avait une voisine ?\n\nIl allait faire mettre la jeune fille \u00e0 la torture quand celle-ci, effray\u00e9e :\n\n\u2014 Oui, il y avait bien avec moi Madame Ouang, mais l'affaire ne la concerne en rien.\n\nVou renvoya les deux personnes confront\u00e9es, et ordonna d'aller qu\u00e9rir Madame Ouang ; celle-ci arriva quelques jours apr\u00e8s et, sur l'ordre du juge, fut mise dans une cellule \u00e0 part pour qu'elle ne communiqu\u00e2t pas avec Yen-tch\u00e9. Elle fut amen\u00e9e devant le tribunal.\n\n\u2014 Quel est le meurtrier ? lui demanda d\u00e8s l'abord Vou Nan-tai.\n\n\u2014 Je n'en sais rien, r\u00e9pondit Madame Ouang.\n\u2014Cependant Yen-tch\u00e9 a dit que vous connaissiez parfaitement celui qui a tu\u00e9 son p\u00e8re : pourquoi le nier ?\n\n\u2014C'est un mensonge ! s'\u00e9cria Madame Ouang ; cette fille perdue ne pensait qu'\u00e0 se marier : j'ai bien, il est vrai, parl\u00e9 d'entremetteur, mais c'\u00e9tait uniquement pour rire ; comment puis-je savoir quel est l'amant qu'elle a introduit elle-m\u00eame chez elle ?\n\nInterrog\u00e9e plus minutieusement, elle raconta dans tous les d\u00e9tails ce qu'elle avait dit en badinant.\n\n\u2014Vous avez dit, s'\u00e9cria Vou en col\u00e8re en s'adressant \u00e0 la jeune fille, que cette personne ne savait rien : pourquoi donc avoue-t-elle elle-m\u00eame qu'elle voulait vous r\u00e9unir \u00e0 celui que vous aimiez ?\n\n\u2014J'ai mal agi, s'\u00e9cria la jeune fille en pleurant, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de la mort de mon pauvre p\u00e8re ! sait-on quand cette affaire sera finie et combien d'autres personnes y seront encore impliqu\u00e9es ? ah ! vraiment je ne puis supporter tant de chagrins !\n\nVou interrogea de nouveau Madame Ouang.\n\n\u2014Une fois que vous e\u00fbtes fini de plaisanter, parl\u00e2tes-vous \u00e0 quelqu'un de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ?\n\n\u2014\u00c0 personne.\n\n\u2014Cependant, dit Vou, lorsque les \u00e9poux sont ensemble il n'est point de chose qu'ils ne se disent : comment pouvez-vous dire que vous n'en avez parl\u00e9 \u00e0 personne ?\n\n\u2014Mon mari est depuis longtemps absent et n'est pas encore de retour.\n\n\u2014Les esprits moqueurs, dit le juge, se rient de la b\u00eatise des autres pour faire briller leur propre intelligence : qui pensez-vous donc tromper en disant que vous n'en avez souffl\u00e9 mot ?\n\nIl ordonna de comprimer les doigts de Madame Ouang : celle-ci, ne pouvant supporter la souffrance, avoua qu'elle en avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Sou. L\u00e0-dessus, Vou fit mettre A\u00f4 en libert\u00e9 et arr\u00eater Sou. Ce dernier, \u00e0 peine arriv\u00e9 devant le juge, d\u00e9clara qu'il ne savait rien. \"Ceux qui vivent chez une femme ne peuvent \u00eatre d'honn\u00eates gens, d\u00e9clara Vou,\" et il le fit mettre \u00e0\nla torture la plus dure. Sou avoua qu\u2019il avait tromp\u00e9 la jeune fille, mais affirma que depuis qu\u2019il avait perdu la pantoufle il n\u2019avait pas os\u00e9 retourner chez le docteur, et qu\u2019il ignorait r\u00e9ellement comment le meurtre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Le juge lui dit qu\u2019un homme qui escaladait les murailles \u00e9tait capable de tous les crimes et le fit de nouveau torturer: Sou fut forc\u00e9 d\u2019avouer que c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui avait commis le crime. Condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 mort, il dut attendre en prison l\u2019\u00e9poque des grandes ex\u00e9cutions d\u2019automne. L\u2019habilet\u00e9 de Vou en cette circonstance fut vant\u00e9e et exalt\u00e9e par tout le monde.\n\nCependant Sou, encore que d\u00e9prav\u00e9 et de moeurs perdues, n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas moins un lettr\u00e9 c\u00e9l\u00e8bre de la province. Sachant que l\u2019Inspecteur de l\u2019universit\u00e9 Ch\u00e9 \u00e9tait un homme tr\u00e8s capable et d\u2019une intelligence peu commune et avait de la commis\u00e9ration pour les lettr\u00e9s, il r\u00e9digea en un style triste et lamentable une p\u00e9tition o\u00f9 il expliquait l\u2019injustice dont il souffrait. Ch\u00e9 examina longtemps le dossier de l\u2019affaire et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit attentivement au cas qui se pr\u00e9sentait: subitement il frappa d\u2019un coup de poing la table sur laquelle il \u00e9tait accoud\u00e9 et s\u2019\u00e9cria: \u201cCe bachelier a certainement subi une injustice.\u201d Il fit donc compara\u00eetre de nouveau Sou devant le gouverneur de la province pour instruire derechef l\u2019affaire. Il demanda d\u00e8s l\u2019abord \u00e0 Sou o\u00f9 il avait perdu la pantoufle: ce dernier r\u00e9pondit qu\u2019il l\u2019ignorait, mais qu\u2019en tout cas il l\u2019avait encore dans sa manche lorsqu\u2019il avait frapp\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte de Madame Ouang. Ch\u00e9 interrogea alors celle-ci:\n\n\u2014Outre Sou Ki\u00e9, quels autres amans aviez-vous?\n\u2014Aucun, r\u00e9pliqua Madame Ouang.\n\u2014Est-il admissible, continua Ch\u00e9, qu\u2019une femme qui se livre \u00e0 la d\u00e9bauche n\u2019ait qu\u2019un seul amant?\n\u2014Sou Ki\u00e9 et moi, r\u00e9pondit Madame Ouang, nous avons eu des relations d\u00e8s notre jeunesse, et nous n\u2019avons pu les rompre plus tard. Il y a certainement eu des gens qui m\u2019ont poursuivi de leurs obsessions, mais je ne leur ai jamais c\u00e9d\u00e9.\n\u2014Indiquez-nous l\u2019un de ces individus!\n\u2014Il y avait entre autres mon voisin Ma\u00f4, que j'ai toujours repouss\u00e9, dit Madame Ouang.\n\n\u2014Il n'est pas croyable que vous soyez devenu aussi chaste que cela, reprit le juge. Personne n'a-t-il profit\u00e9 de l'absence de votre mari pour venir vous voir?\n\n\u2014En effet, r\u00e9pondit Madame Ouang, un tel et un tel sont venus une ou deux fois \u00e0 la maison, soit pour emprunter de l'argent, soit pour m'offrir des pr\u00e9sens, mais, encore que ces gens eussent des vues sur moi, ils ne les ont pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9es.\n\nCh\u00e9 fit prendre en note les noms de ces individus et envoya des shires les arr\u00eater. Quand ils furent tous arriv\u00e9s, il se rendit avec eux au temple du dieu tut\u00e9laire de la cit\u00e9 et les fit mettre \u00e0 genoux devant l'autel.\n\n\u2014J'ai vu l'autre jour en r\u00eave, leur dit-il, ce G\u00e9nie qui m'a assur\u00e9 que le meurtrier \u00e9tait l'un de vous. Nous voici maintenant en pr\u00e9sence du G\u00e9nie, vous ne pouvez mentir : si le coupable veut avouer lui-m\u00eame son crime, je pourrai peut-\u00eatre avoir encore de l'indulgence pour lui; sinon, il n'aura \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer aucune piti\u00e9.\n\nTous r\u00e9pondirent qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas coupables.\n\nCh\u00e9 les fit mettre \u00e0 la torture: tous, la queue roul\u00e9e autour de la t\u00eate, dans la nudit\u00e9 la plus compl\u00e8te, criaient qu'ils \u00e9taient innocents.\n\n\u2014Eh bien! dit Ch\u00e9 en ordonnant de les d\u00e9lier, puisque le coupable ne veut pas se d\u00e9clarer, c'est le G\u00e9nie lui-m\u00eame qui va le d\u00e9signer.\n\nSur ses ordres, les fen\u00eatres furent calfeutr\u00e9es avec des nattes et des tapis pour que le jour ne p\u00fbt p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le temple, puis les accus\u00e9s, rev\u00eatus uniquement de leur pantalon, furent laiss\u00e9s dans l'obscurit\u00e9.\n\nOn pla\u00e7a devant chacun une cuvette o\u00f9 ils durent se laver les mains: puis, cela fait, ils furent attach\u00e9s au pied du mur. Ch\u00e9 leur ordonna de tourner le visage vers la muraille et de ne plus bouger: \"le Genie, dit-il, viendra \u00e9crire quelques mots sur le dos du coupable.\"\nIl sortit et fit fermer la porte du temple. Quelques instants apr\u00e8s il la faisait rouvrir et examinait les accus\u00e9s les uns apr\u00e8s les autres; quand il eut vu Ma\u00f4, il s'\u00e9cria: \"voici le vrai meurtrier.\"\n\nCh\u00e9 avait enjoint de couvrir le mur de cendres et de boue et avait fait mettre dans les cuvettes de l'eau noire comme le charbon. Le coupable, craignant que le G\u00e9nie ne vint \u00e9crire sur son dos, s'\u00e9tait adoss\u00e9 \u00e0 la muraille et s'\u00e9tait ainsi sali; puis, au moment de sortir, il avait prot\u00e9g\u00e9 son dos avec ses mains noires de charbon et s'\u00e9tait encore noirci.\n\nLes soup\u00e7ons de Ch\u00e9 sur la culpabilit\u00e9 de Ma\u00f4 furent ainsi confirm\u00e9s; l'Inspecteur ordonna de mettre le meurtrier \u00e0 la plus dure torture : celui-ci avoua alors toute la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n\nLe jugement de Ch\u00e9 fut ainsi con\u00e7u: \"Que Sou Ki\u00e9 soit mis en libert\u00e9; ce lettr\u00e9, tout pervers, tout dissolu qu'il est, n'en a pas moins eu piti\u00e9 des g\u00e9missemens de Yen-tch\u00e9 malade et n'agit pas \u00e0 son \u00e9gard comme un \u00e9pervier: il avait donc encore des sentiments dignes d'un lettr\u00e9. Il eut le tort de prendre la pantoufle comme gage de l'hymen et de la perdre: il repassa la muraille comme un papillon, mais quelqu'un cach\u00e9 dans l'herbe entendit ce qui se disait sur la route.1 Il a souffert de terribles tortures et a failli avoir la t\u00eate tranch\u00e9e: nous prenons cela en consid\u00e9ration et usons d'indulgence \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, mais comme il a sali, par sa conduite, son bonnet de lettr\u00e9, nous le d\u00e9gradons pour un temps, lui laissant ainsi ouverte la voie du repentir et de la r\u00e9formation.\n\n\"Quant \u00e0 Ma\u00f4-t\u00e2, homme pervers et vagabond, qui, repouss\u00e9 par une femme sa voisine n'a pu ma\u00eetriser ses mauvais penchants, s'est introduit par escalade dans la maison de la jeune fille et, comme le li\u00e8vre qui, pris dans son g\u00eete, se retourne pour mordre le chasseur, a tu\u00e9 le p\u00e8re de Yen-tch\u00e9 afin de se sauver,\n\n---\n\n1. Allusion au proverbe bien connu: \u8def\u4e0a\u8aaa\u8a71\u8349\u88e1\u6709\u4eba\u807d Lou-chang ch\u00f4-houa, ts'au-li y\u00e9ou jen ting, quand on parle sur la route, il y a des gens cach\u00e9s dans l'herbe qui entendent. C'est l'\u00e9quivalent du n\u00f4tre: \"les murs ont des oreilles.\"\nqu'il ait la t\u00eate tranch\u00e9e en ch\u00e2timent de ses crimes et de sa conduite!\n\n\"Yen-tch\u00e9 est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge du mariage : elle n'aspire qu'\u00e0 trouver un mari. Il faut lui chercher un \u00e9poux beau comme le jade. Que le magistrat de son district soit lui-m\u00eame l'entremetteur du mariage et se mette en qu\u00eate d'un mari digne d'elle.\"\n\nCe jugement fut universellement lou\u00e9. Les coll\u00e8gues de Ch\u00e9 vinrent f\u00e9liciter celui-ci d'avoir tir\u00e9 au clair une affaire si embrouill\u00e9e.\n\nOr, d\u00e8s que le juge eut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 A\u00f4 innocent, la jeune fille \u00e9tait revenue \u00e0 ses premiers sentiments : elle ne voyait plus le bachelier avec horreur puis-qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas l'auteur de la mort de son p\u00e8re. Un jour, l'audience finie, comme ils sortaient tous deux du pr\u00e9toire, la jeune fille fondit en larmes : les sanglots lui d\u00e9chiraient la poitrine, et l'emp\u00eachaient de prononcer une seule parole. Le bachelier fut \u00e9mu de sa douleur et touch\u00e9 de sa beaut\u00e9 : d\u00e8s lors il ne cessa plus nuit et jour de penser \u00e0 elle ; il aurait bien voulu la prendre pour femme, mais, songeant \u00e0 la condition humble de Yen-tch\u00e9 et au vil m\u00e9tier qu'avait exerc\u00e9 son p\u00e8re, il craignait de devenir la ris\u00e9e du public. Il ne savait quel parti prendre, ni \u00e0 quel dessein s'arr\u00eater. Enfin, quand le jugement eut \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 et rendu public, il se d\u00e9cida \u00e0 l'\u00e9pouser ; il alla trouver le magistrat de district qui fut l'entremetteur du mariage : les \u00e9poux furent, suivant l'usage, conduits \u00e0 leur nouvelle demeure au son des fl\u00fbtes et des tambours.\n\nSon r\u00e9cit termin\u00e9, notre conteur s'essuyait le front, avalait une tasse de th\u00e9, tire une bouff\u00e9e de tabac et, infatigable, recommence une nouvelle collecte avant d'entamer une autre histoire. Imitant plusieurs auditeurs que leurs affaires appellent sans doute ailleurs, nous sortons du cercle dont le narrateur est entour\u00e9.\nNous allons visiter le San-tsiing-tien, Temple des Trois Purs, qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 nord de l'agora. Le plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bre de ces trois pure ones est le grand philosophe La\u00f4-tseu, fondateur de la doctrine du Ta\u00f4 ou de la Raison (logos). Nous entrons dans la grande salle; elle est orn\u00e9e de hautes statues en bois dor\u00e9: c'est \u00e0 leur pied que les fid\u00e8les viennent se prosterner et br\u00fbler des b\u00e2tons parfum\u00e9s. Les ailes de l'\u00e9difice sont occup\u00e9es par des marchands de peintures sur papier, images \u00e0 couleurs voyantes qui rappellent les produits de l'imagerie d'Epinal. L\u00e0 on est coudoy\u00e9 par une foule houleuse, s'arr\u00eatant un instant pour lire les l\u00e9gendes ou pour discuter le prix d'une peinture avec le marchand: celui-ci, arm\u00e9 d'une longue perche, d\u00e9croche avec patience toutes celles qu'on d\u00e9sire voir de plus pr\u00e8s, et les raccroche avec non moins de patience. Une peinture entre autres attire nos regards: elle repr\u00e9sente une \u00e9cole enti\u00e8re dont les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, profitant de l'absence du ma\u00eetre, mettent tout sens dessus dessous et font les cent coups. L'un s'est assis \u00e0 la place du professeur et a mis ses larges lunettes d'\u00e9caill\u00e9: il est en train de barbouiller \u00e0 tort et \u00e0 travers un texte de Confucius oubli\u00e9 sur la table; un autre, mont\u00e9 sur les bancs accumul\u00e9s dans un coin, d\u00e9clame avec force grimaces quelque po\u00e9sie populaire; un troisi\u00e8me s'est empar\u00e9 de la th\u00e9i\u00e8re du ma\u00eetre et l'emploie \u00e0 un tout autre usage que celui auquel elle est destin\u00e9e; tous les autres courent \u00e7a et l\u00e0, crient, se bousculent, s'arrachent leurs queues, se flanquent des horions, etc. C'est vraiment une fort jolie peinture o\u00f9, chose extraordinaire dans un dessin purement chinois, les lois de la perspective sont assez bien observ\u00e9es. Nous remarquons plusieurs autres peintures passablement \u00e9tudi\u00e9es: un groupe de jeunes femmes sous un arbre, les portraits des \u516b\u4ed9 p\u00e2-hien ou Huit Immortels,\u00b9 etc. Malheureusement, le peintre chinois se contente d'imiter les anciens: il n'innove pas, ou bien, quand il le fait, c'est pour accoucher d'un ridiculus mus. Il faut le laisser suivre toujours la m\u00eame orni\u00e8re: le moindre \u00e9cart le ferait verser.\n\n\u00b9 Voir W. F. Mayers, Chinese reader's Manual, p. 338.\nDerri\u00e8re le grand temple se trouvent un certain nombre de petits \u00e9difices religieux : l\u2019un porte le nom de Toung-yu t\u00e2 tien, le temple de l\u2019enfer oriental. Dans le vestibule, deux grandes statues de bois peint, g\u00e9nies terribles aux yeux flamboyants : de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019autel, deux rang\u00e9es de statues \u00e0 l\u2019air \u00e9galement formidable. Les bas-c\u00f4t\u00e9s sont remplis de statuettes au dessus desquelles pendent des inscriptions dans le go\u00fbt de celle-ci : \u201cSi vous demandez quelque chose aux dieux, ceux-ci vous r\u00e9pondront certainement.\u201d\n\nEn remontant vers le nord, nous voyons, pr\u00e8s des murailles occidentales et non loin d\u2019une maison europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 un \u00e9tage (la r\u00e9sidence de missionnaires protestants), un camp retranch\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, comme \u00e0 Song-Kiang, dans l\u2019int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame de la ville. A la porte du sud, un soldat frappe avec deux baguettes sur un grand tambour, tandis que deux autres, embouchant de longues trompettes, font entendre des sons aigus et discordans : il para\u00eet que c\u2019est l\u2019heure de l\u2019exercice. Voici les soldats qui sortent p\u00eale-m\u00eale de leurs baraques, prennent nonchalamment leurs pistons et se rangent en d\u00e9sordre dans la cour : arrive le commandant, un gros mandarin joufflu, tenant d\u2019une main un parasol de papier huil\u00e9 pour se garantir du soleil et de l\u2019autre un \u00e9ventail qu\u2019il agite tout en inspectant la ligne peu r\u00e9guli\u00e8re des guerriers : \u00e0 son commandement un caporal sort des rangs et, se pla\u00e7ant devant le front, crie . . . en fran\u00e7ais : droite, gauche, etc. et la colonne de s\u2019\u00e9branler tant bien que mal. Ce sont les restes de l\u2019instruction militaire donn\u00e9e par nos sous-officiers aux troupes franco-chinoises du Kiang-sou.\n\nA la porte du camp s\u2019\u00e9tale une grande proclamation orn\u00e9e du sceau rouge officiel : c\u2019est un ordre du jour du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral commandant la place qui d\u00e9fend aux soldats de s\u2019adonner \u00e0 l\u2019opium : \u201cL\u2019opium, y est-il dit, est nuisible \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la constitution de ceux qui le fument, et les soldats, plus que\n\n1. \u6709\u6c42\u5fc5\u61c9.\n2. Voir l\u2019article que nous avons publi\u00e9 dans le No. d\u2019Avril-Mai-Juin 1882 du Journal Asiatique, Une excursion \u00e0 la ville de Song-Kiang.\ntous les autres, doivent s'abstenir de se laisser aller \u00e0 ce vice. D\u00e9j\u00e0 le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent vice-roi a s\u00e9v\u00e8rement interdit aux troupes de fumer l'opium, mais voici que le vice-roi actuel a entendu dire que si les soldats ne fumaient plus dans les camps, ils trouvaient moyen de le faire dans des maisons particuli\u00e8res, et il croit de son devoir de promulguer de nouveaux ordres \u00e0 ce sujet. Outre les mesures pr\u00e9ventives d\u00e9j\u00e0 prises, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral annonce que dor\u00e9navant tous les hommes seront p\u00e9riodiquement inspect\u00e9s un \u00e0 un, qu'on renverra imm\u00e9diatement ceux dont le visage trahirait l'usage de l'opium et qu'on les remplacera par d'autres.\"\n\nNous retournons \u00e0 notre bateau par des enfilades de petites rues s'entrecroisant \u00e0 tout bout de champ, v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9dale dans lequel nous nous \u00e9garions ais\u00e9ment si nous n'\u00e9tions conduits par notre batelier, n\u00e9 natif des environs de Sou-tch\u00e9ou et \u00e0 qui les rues des villes sont aussi famili\u00e8res que les canaux et rivi\u00e8res du d\u00e9partement. Nous passons devant de nombreux ateliers de broderies (celles de Sou-tch\u00e9ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnues de tout temps) o\u00f9 des m\u00e9tiers sont mis en mouvement par de jeunes gar\u00e7ons.\u00b9\n\nNous arrivons au logis \u00e0 la nuit tombante : nous ne pouvons\n\n---\n\n\u00b9. Il existe \u00e0 Sou-tch\u00e9ou une manufacture imp\u00e9riale de soieries : l\u00e0 sont fabriqu\u00e9es de belles \u00e9toffes qui sont envoy\u00e9es ensuite au Palais Imp\u00e9rial et enfouies dans le tr\u00e9sor imp\u00e9rial ; les eunuques et les gens du palais les soustraient de cet endroit et les revendent aux marchands de soieries de P\u00e9king. C'est ainsi qu'un grand nombre de rouleaux d'\u00e9toffes magnifiques et de robes brod\u00e9es ou tiss\u00e9es (Sou-tch\u00e9ou a la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 des \u00e9toffes \u5254\u7d72 K\u016b-sseu, tiss\u00e9es) se trouvent annuellement mis dans le commerce. Lors de l'exp\u00e9dition de Chine, nos soldats mirent la main sur les magasins o\u00f9 \u00e9taient renferm\u00e9s tous ces rouleaux et en prirent en si grand nombre qu'ils en firent des liti\u00e8res pour leurs chevaux.\n\nUne autre production importante de Sou-tch\u00e9ou qu'il faut noter, ce sont les belles laques rouges dites de P\u00e9king : en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elles sont toutes faites \u00e0 Sou-tch\u00e9ou mais pour l'usage du Palais seulement, et, comme l'on n'en rencontre qu'\u00e0 la Capitale (mises dans le commerce comme les soieries) les \u00e9trangers ont pris l'habitude de les d\u00e9signer sous le nom de laques de P\u00e9king. Il y a de ces laques, surtout celles qui ont une certaine antiquit\u00e9, qui sont tr\u00e8s finement travaill\u00e9es et fort jolies ; on sait que plus elles sont lourdes et plus elles sont anciennes : nous en avons vu une, grande comme le creux de la main, datant de la dynastie des Ming, qui pesait pr\u00e8s de deux livres.\nplus songer au d\u00e9part et sommes r\u00e9duits \u00e0 passer la nuit sur le canal.\n\n... A peine sommes-nous plong\u00e9 dans le premier sommeil que des oscillations soudaines et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de notre bateau nous r\u00e9veillent en sursaut. En m\u00eame temps nous entendons des bruits de pas et un fr\u00f4lement le long de la cabine, puis une, deux, trois ch\u00fbtes lourdes sur le rivage et autant de mouvements de recul de la barque : c'est \u00e9videmment notre \u00e9quipage qui d\u00e9file et saute en h\u00e2te \u00e0 terre. \u00c0 cet instant, ces chocs et reculs r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s ayant fait virer de bord le house-boat, une soudaine clart\u00e9 rouge p\u00e9n\u00e8tre vivement par la fen\u00eatre et \u00e9claire toute la cabine, tandis que des cris confus parmi lesquels nous percevons ceux de *ts\u00e9ou chou\u00ef*, allez chercher de l'eau ; *ki\u00e9ou-ming*, au secours ! se font entendre ; en un bond nous sommes sur le pont : un incendie venait d'\u00e9clater pr\u00e8s de la rive, en amont de notre ancrage.\n\nDeux boutiques flambaient : l'une \u00e9tait celle d'un fabricant de cercueils ; le feu y avait pris dans un amas de copeaux, et avait rapidement atteint et attaqu\u00e9 les lourdes et \u00e9paisses auges de bois blanc qui constituent les cercueils chinois : en ce moment tous les cercueils flambaient avec rage ainsi que les planches \u00e9quarries dress\u00e9es le long du mur. Le vernis de Ningpo cr\u00e9pitait dans les r\u00e9cipients. Au milieu de la flamme s'aper\u00e7oit l'autel du dieu des richesses que poss\u00e8de tout boutiquier chinois : les deux chandeliers sont rougis \u00e0 blanc sur la tablette incandescente ; l'image enlumin\u00e9e du dieu, l\u00e9ch\u00e9e par la flamme, vient de prendre feu : la figure grotesque du Plutus chinois se tord dans de comiques convulsions.\n\nL'autre boutique, attenante \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rapidement atteinte : c'\u00e9tait un restaurant. Le feu y avait trouv\u00e9 des aliments et avait broy\u00e9 en peu d'instants les tables, les bancs, le comptoir, les \u00e9tablis ; les fen\u00eatres \u00e0 petits carreaux d'\u00e9caille d'hu\u00eetre se fendaient dans la fournaise.\n\nLe ravage s'\u00e9tendait. Une maison situ\u00e9e derri\u00e8re \u00e9tait la proie de l'incendie : nous en voyons sortir plusieurs femmes chinoises, r\u00e9veill\u00e9es par les cris des passans et les yeux encore\nbouffis de sommeil, mais qui ne sont malheureusement pas dans le simple appareil d'une beaut\u00e9 qu'on arrache au sommeil.\n\nattendu que les chinois et chinoises se couchent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tout habill\u00e9s sur des nattes et ne connaissent pas l'usage des draps.\n\nLa foule \u00e9tait devenue consid\u00e9rable : de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s accourent des badauds agitant au bout d'un b\u00e2ton leur lanterne \u00e0 caract\u00e8res rouges, \u00e9toiles mobiles dansant une sarabande effr\u00e9n\u00e9e dans leur course rapide. Parmi les assistants ce ne sont que cris, ce n'est que confusion : les malheureux boutiquiers, aid\u00e9s de quelques voisins, sauvent ce qu'ils avaient de plus pr\u00e9cieux, leurs enfans mi-endormis, quelques meubles d\u00e9j\u00e0 noircis... affol\u00e9s, ils tentent d'arracher \u00e0 l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment destructeur des d\u00e9bris de leur fortune qui s'en va en feu et en fum\u00e9e. Des maisons voisines sortent des gens qui d\u00e9meublent, un certain nombre de spectateurs s'est arm\u00e9 de sceaux et jettent sur le foyer des pot\u00e9es d'eau puis\u00e9e dans le canal, ce qui contribue bien plus \u00e0 l'alimenter davantage qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9teindre.\n\nAussi l'incendie fait-il rage : les poutres et les solives des toits, attaqu\u00e9es par les flammes bouillonnantes du foyer, craquent dans le moment tout \u00e0 la fois, oscillent un instant dans l'espace, puis tombent avec fracas dans le brasier, en faisant jaillir des flamm\u00e8ches qui retombent comme des fl\u00e8ches sur les assistants : \u00e0 leur suite le toit s'ab\u00eeme avec un craquement sinistre. Un mouvement se produit dans la foule qui semble s'\u00e9carte pour faire place \u00e0 un cort\u00e8ge : c'est, le tchefou ou Pr\u00e9fet de Sou-tch\u00e9ou accompagn\u00e9 de son escorte de porteurs de pancartes et de lanternes, de bourreaux et d'aides de camp d\u00e9guenill\u00e9s, en un mot de tous les satellites d\u00fbs \u00e0 un astre de cette grandeur. Il juge sans doute sa pr\u00e9sence n\u00e9cessaire pour calmer le courroux du G\u00e9nie du feu. Sa chaise \u00e0 porteurs est entour\u00e9e de mandarins subalternes pressant leur marche pour la suivre ; comme dit un po\u00e8te moderne :\nTous les mandarins ont rev\u00eatu leurs habits de combat,\net courent pour \u00e9teindre cet incendie comme si c'\u00e9tait une r\u00e9bellion :\nLe pr\u00e9fet de Sou-tch\u00e9ou d\u00e9passe les autres par sa bravoure,\net s'\u00e9lance en avant-garde \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'une troupe de soldats.\nIls vont et viennent au milieu de la noire fum\u00e9e : on ne les voit plus.\nOn n'entend plus que le bruit de leurs voix qui pressent d'envoyer de l'eau :\nCent pompes lancent en l'air des gerbes d'eau semblables \u00e0 des fl\u00e8ches.\u00b9\n\nVoyant ses efforts infructueux et l'eau insuffisante, le pr\u00e9fet ordonne de faire la part du feu et de le couper en d\u00e9molissant les maisons voisines. Plus de huit maisons br\u00fblaient alors et le feu mena\u00e7ait de s'\u00e9tendre sur tout le quartier : toutes les maisons \u00e9tant en bois de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9, on ne sait o\u00f9 le ravage se serait arr\u00eat\u00e9. Circonscrit, le feu se contente de d\u00e9vorer le groupe de maisons dont il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 ma\u00eetre : au matin, l'embrasement finissait faute d'aliments, et il ne restait plus de huit maisons ou boutiques que des d\u00e9combres fumantes et des murs noircis : quelque chose comme les traces d'un combat.\n\nOrdinairement, deux ou trois jours apr\u00e8s un incendie de ce genre, il n'y para\u00eet plus rien : en effet, apr\u00e8s avoir patiemment tamis\u00e9 la cendre pour en extraire tout ce qu'il est possible, les habitans font venir un ma\u00eetre-charpentier qui, en vingt-quatre heures, leur \u00e9l\u00e8ve une nouvelle demeure, plus jolie et surtout plus propre que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Nous avons vu \u00e0 Shanghai un exemple de la rapidit\u00e9 avec laquelle des quartiers entiers peuvent \u00eatre construits : le 15 ao\u00fbt 1879 un vaste incendie d\u00e9vorait tout le quartier de l'est de la Concession Fran\u00e7aise, plus de douze cents maisons : en trois mois \u00e0 peine \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Voici le texte de ces charmants vers d\u00fbs \u00e0 \u8881\u5b50\u624d Yuan Teeu-tz'at qui v\u00e9cut de 1716 \u00e0 1797 :\n\n\u6587\u6b66\u4e00\u8272\u7686\u620e\u88c5\n\u5954\u524d\u6ec5\u706b\u5982\u6ec5\u8cca\n\u8607\u5dde\u592a\u5b88\u6c23\u5c24\u96c4\n\u7368\u9818\u4e00\u968a\u7576\u5148\u92d2\n\u51fa\u6c92\u9ed1\u7159\u4eba\u4e0d\u898b\n\u4f46\u805e\u4fc3\u6c34\u8072\u9a30\u9a30\n\u6c34\u9f8d\u767e\u9053\u6a6b\u7a7a\u5c04\nun nouveau quartier, plus brillant, plus propre, plus populeux que l'ancien.\n\nDans les villes chinoises les incendies sont presque incessants, et comme les chinois n'ont pas de vrais pompiers ni de vraies pompes, et qu'il y a toujours des gens malintentionn\u00e9s qui augmentent l'incendie et le d\u00e9sordre pour p\u00eacher en eau trouble, il en r\u00e9sulte que le moindre feu est un vrai d\u00e9sastre. Les chinois ne manquent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas de les attribuer \u00e0 l'influence maligne ou *foung chouei* (litt. vent et eau) de quelque objet voisin : une corniche peinte en rouge trop saillante, une chemin\u00e9e trop haute, un montant de porte plus haut que l'autre, etc. Peu de jours avant notre passage \u00e0 Sou-tch\u00e9ou on avait d\u00e9couvert, apr\u00e8s un incendie, que la cause n'en pouvait \u00eatre autre que la pr\u00e9sence d'une boule rouge plac\u00e9e au bout d'une perche en dehors de la porte situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la rue. La boule fut aussit\u00f4t peinte en noir pour ne plus attirer en ces lieux le redoutable et irascible G\u00e9nie du feu.\n\nOn a cit\u00e9 plusieurs des moyens employ\u00e9s par les chinois pour se mettre en garde contre cette influence maligne, comme les italiens ont certaines amulettes contre la jettatura. \u00c0 P\u00e9king ils n'ont imagin\u00e9 autre chose pour prot\u00e9ger le Palais Imp\u00e9rial contre la pr\u00e9sence mena\u00e7ante des deux hautes tours de la cath\u00e9drale catholique (*Pe\u00ef t'ang*), qui le domine presque, que d'\u00e9lever vis-\u00e0-vis un grand mur blanc. Ce que nous avons vu de plus curieux en ce genre c'est \u00e0 Changha\u00ef m\u00eame : une maison europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9tages surplombant de toute sa hauteur une bicoque chinoise, le propri\u00e9taire de celle-ci n'avait rien trouv\u00e9 de mieux \u00e0 faire, pour se mettre \u00e0 l'abri du *foung chouei* de l'immense construction \u00e9trang\u00e8re, que de disposer sur son toit, le goulot tourn\u00e9 vers l'\u00e9difice mena\u00e7ant, plusieurs bouteilles europ\u00e9ennes vides !\n\nLe peuple chinois est un peuple superstitieux par excellence, na\u00eff et cr\u00e9dule, et les moindres id\u00e9es fantastiques et surnaturelles suffisent pour l'affoler : aussi chez lui les chiromanciens et devins sont-ils en honneur. Pour la moindre action on les\nconsulte, et leurs paroles sont autant d'oracles. Que l'on nous permette de traduire ici un article publi\u00e9 gravement par le \u7533\u5831 Chen-pao, ou Gazette de Changha\u00ef, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es; on y verra jusqu'o\u00f9 peut aller parfois la b\u00eatise et la simplicit\u00e9 de cette nation de grands enfans. Il ne faut pas oublier que des histoires extraordinaires comme celle qui suit pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des troubles et des voies de fait contre les \u00e9trangers, que cette effervescence est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l'oeuvre occulte des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s secr\u00e8tes qui minent la Chine et que ce sont les chr\u00e9tiens et nos missionnaires qui, par suite des dispositions peu favorables dont ils sont d'ordinaire l'objet, sont plus expos\u00e9s que tous autres aux violences d'une population ainsi exalt\u00e9e:\n\n\"Un de nos amis nous \u00e9crit de Sou-tch\u00e9ou qu'une grande agitation r\u00e8gne en ce moment parmi la population. On r\u00e9pand le bruit que des \u00eatres diaboliques oppriment la poitrine des gens, et, de toute la nuit, personne n'ose fermer l'\u0153il. Dans la nuit du 23 de ce mois, peu apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me veille, au pied des remparts et le long du foss\u00e9 sud de la ville, soudain retentit dans l'espace un bruit semblable \u00e0 celui de plusieurs centaines de cavaliers en marche, et bient\u00f4t apr\u00e8s l'on croit ou\u00efr les pas de plusieurs milliers de chevaux. Au milieu de ce vacarme on distingue des vocif\u00e9rations, des sons de gongs, des chocs d'armes de guerre. Aussit\u00f4t les mariniers du nord de la rivi\u00e8re se r\u00e9unissent et, brandissant des lanternes, et frappant sur des gongs, chassent ce bruit insolite qui se dirige alors de la porte du sud-est vers la porte du nord-est. \u00c0 son origine, le bruit semblait flotter dans l'air; on l'entendait courir de l'est \u00e0 l'ouest et r\u00e9ciproquement. Les amateurs de choses extraordinaires s'empress\u00e8rent de courir du nord au sud et du sud au nord pour rechercher d'o\u00f9 partait tout ce tapage, mais ce fut en vain. Chacun alors de frapper sur les gongs, les tambours, les plats et les assiettes et de battre des mains: les coqs poussaient leurs coquericos, les chiens aboyaient, les femmes et les enfans criaient et pleuraient: charivari extraordinaire. Mais le bruit diabolique avait cess\u00e9.\n\n\"Dans la nuit du 24 courant, un ouvrier, employ\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cor-\ntiquer le riz dans la maison Ta-y\u00e9ou, r\u00eavait en dormant, quand il crut sentir soudain quelqu'un qui lui marchait sur les pieds: effray\u00e9, il se r\u00e9veille, crie au secours: on accourt et l'on croit apercevoir un enfant de six \u00e0 sept ans et une boule de feu emport\u00e9s comme dans un tourbillon. La terreur est \u00e0 son comble quand d'autres voisins frappent \u00e0 la porte avec violence: on leur ouvre, mais l'enfant et la boule de feu avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 disparus. On leur demande le motif de leur venue: \"nous avons entendu le bruit d'un mur qui s'\u00e9croulait, et, voyant de la fum\u00e9e et des flammes qui s'\u00e9chappaient de la porte du magasin de riz, nous avons cru \u00e0 un incendie et venons au secours.\"\n\nLe 25 du m\u00eame mois, \u00e0 la nuit tombante, comme deux servantes demeurant dans la ruelle San-ma\u00f4 (les trois chats), allaient prendre le frais dans une chambre situ\u00e9e tout au fond de la maison, un vent glacial frappe tout-\u00e0-coup l'une d'elles qui tombe \u00e9vanouie et dont les pieds seuls s'agitent. Paralys\u00e9e par la peur, sa compagne ne peut faire autre chose que frapper le sol du pied. Le ma\u00eetre de la maison accourt et aper\u00e7oit la servante \u00e9tendue, la bouche \u00e9cumante: il comprend qu'elle est poss\u00e9d\u00e9e, et lui fait avaler une potion chaude gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 laquelle elle reprend ses sens. Apr\u00e8s cela il saisit le couvercle de la chaise perc\u00e9e et le brandit dans tous les sens: on entend dans l'espace un \u00e9clat de rire qui va en s'affaiblissant; le fils d'un ouvrier demeurant \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la maison du marchand de riz, \u00e2g\u00e9 de huit ans, a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 les m\u00eames sympt\u00f4mes que cette servante: on a asperg\u00e9 l'air avec de l'eau sale et l'enfant est revenu \u00e0 la vie. L'\u00e9clat de rire s'est \u00e9galement fait entendre et s'est chang\u00e9 en un grand vacarme qui a fini par s'\u00e9teindre.\n\n\"En un mot on ne parle plus depuis quelques jours \u00e0 Sou-tch\u00e9ou que de diableries et de choses surnaturelles: les esprits sont frapp\u00e9s de crainte. Les magistrats des districts de Tch'ang-tch\u00e9ou, Yuan-'h\u00f4 et Vou, de concert avec le mandarin militaire Tchong Tchoun, ont publi\u00e9 une proclamation destin\u00e9e \u00e0 mettre fin aux histoires qui circulent et mena\u00e7ant de\npunir ceux qui s\u2019affolent sans raison.\n\n\u201cLes habitants de Vou-si affirment l\u2019existence de ces \u00eatres surnaturels. Selon eux ils ont la forme d\u2019un chat ou d\u2019un rat d\u2019un pied et demi de long; ils font du bruit en arrivant et en partant, ils grimpent des pieds au ventre et \u00e0 la poitrine de ceux qu\u2019ils ont choisi comme souffre-douleur. Leur poids est \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui d\u2019un demi picul de riz. Celui qui a la conscience pure doit, d\u00e8s qu\u2019il sent sur ses pieds l\u2019\u00eatre en question, se mettre sur son s\u00e9ant et asperger l\u2019air avec une eau sale; les diables en papier tomberont d\u2019eux-m\u00eames et resteront sans mouvement. Que sans retard il pose le couvercle sur sa chaise perc\u00e9e et se rende, \u00e0 cent pieds environ de sa demeure, dans un endroit \u00e9cart\u00e9 couvert d\u2019herbes ou d\u2019arbustes; il trouvera l\u00e0 un brigand \u00e9tendu comme un cadavre, sur la t\u00eate et la poitrine duquel sont coll\u00e9s des papiers rouges orn\u00e9s de caract\u00e8res magiques. L\u2019\u00e2me de ce brigand qui s\u2019est rendue avec le diable en papier dans la maison est enferm\u00e9e dans la chaise perc\u00e9e et ne peut r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le corps de son propri\u00e9taire. Le brigand une fois saisi, on n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir la chaise perc\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e2me retourne dans le corps du brigand qui retrouve alors l\u2019usage de la parole. A Vou-si on a arr\u00eat\u00e9 cinq individus de cette fa\u00e7on. Ces gens sont pay\u00e9s par le chef des brigands pour se coller sur la t\u00eate et l\u2019estomac des signes cabalistiques et opprimer la poitrine des habitans pendant la nuit; on saisit plus difficilement ceux qui \u00e9crivent ces caract\u00e8res cabalistiques, car ils se cachent soigneusement.\n\n\u201cChaque oppression est accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une lueur: elle rapporte tant \u00e0 ceux qui la font; l\u2019homme en papier qui a opprim\u00e9 trois fois une personne acquiert par cela m\u00eame la facult\u00e9 de se mouvoir; il s\u2019est en quelque sorte empar\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e2me de sa victime et il est presque insaisissable. Apr\u00e8s avoir op\u00e9r\u00e9 quatre oppressions, l\u2019homme de papier est capable d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter tous les ordres qu\u2019on lui donne. Celui qui en a subi quatre meurt, et une prime est accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019opresseur. L\u2019esprit qui accompagne l\u2019homme de papier a toutefois beaucoup de peine \u00e0 p\u00e9n\u00e9trer chez les gens, et quelquefois l\u2019homme de papier tom-\nbe \u00e0 terre. Ainsi l\u2019autre jour un paysan prenant le frais est saisi par le froid et rentre chez lui : \u00e0 sa porte git un homme de papier de cinq \u00e0 six pouces de long ; il le prend, le cloue au mur et les voisins viennent le contempler. Non loin de l\u00e0 est \u00e9tendu un vicillard ayant l\u2019aspect d\u2019un p\u00eacheur. Le paysan l\u2019interroge : \u201c\u00eates-vous malade ?\u201d \u2014 \u201cje souffre au coeur,\u201d r\u00e9pond le vieillard.\u201d Le paysan retourne chez lui, fiche deux clous dans les pieds de l\u2019homme de papier et va de nouveau interroger le vieillard qui d\u00e9clare souffrir aux pieds. Continuant son exp\u00e9rience, le paysan coupe la t\u00eate de l\u2019homme en papier et quand il revient pr\u00e8s du vieillard, il trouve celui-ci sans t\u00eate.\n\n\u201cSelon nous, l\u2019homme de papier choisit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence les maisons \u00e9cart\u00e9es, et ne s\u2019attaque gu\u00e8re aux maisons serr\u00e9es les unes contre les autres, et dont les portes sont solides. Il a m\u00eame besoin de s\u2019informer de l\u2019\u00e9tat des lieux pendant le jour ; et, \u00e0 notre avis, ce sont l\u00e0 des diableries anodines dont on peut se pr\u00e9server si l\u2019on a les yeux ouverts. Ainsi \u00e0 Vou-si, le peuple s\u2019est organis\u00e9 en gardes nationales : on surveille les nouveaux venus ; on fait des patrouilles nuit et jour ; on se rend r\u00e9ciproquement garant l\u2019un vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019autre et les brigands, ne pouvant plus faire leurs mal\u00e9fices, se sont retir\u00e9s \u00e0 Sou-tch\u00e9ou.\u201d\nII.

Nous atteignons ainsi le Si-meun, Porte de l'ouest, sous laquelle nous passons. En dehors, sur le bord du canal obstru\u00e9 par un prodigieux amoncellement et un va-et-vient continu de bateaux de toutes formes et de toutes grandeur, se trouve situ\u00e9 un bourg populeux, turbulent,\nagit\u00e9. D'\u00e9normes jonques \u00e0 riz \u00e0 la poupe jouffue orn\u00e9e des quatre mots d'heureux augure: \u98a8\u5927\u5409 choun foun g\u00e2 ki, vent propice et grand bonheur, sont sym\u00e9triquement rang\u00e9es c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te perpendiculairement \u00e0 la rive, ne laissant entre elles qu'un \u00e9troit chenal. L\u00e0, un bac permet, moyennant quelques sap\u00e8ques, de passer d'un bord \u00e0 l'autre \u00e0 travers l'agitation du canal.\n\nNon loin de l\u00e0 nous d\u00e9bouchons dans le fameux et c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Grand Canal Imp\u00e9rial. Comme on sait, ce canal, appel\u00e9 par les chinois \u904b\u6cb3 yun-h\u00f4, rivi\u00e8re de transport, ou \u904b\u7ce7\u6cb3 yun-l\u00e9ang h\u00f4 rivi\u00e8re pour le transport des grains (tribut en nature qui doit \u00eatre envoy\u00e9 annuellement \u00e0 P\u00e9king), part de Hang-tch\u00e9ou, capitale du Tch\u00e9-kiang, remonte vers le nord, longe les murs de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, traverse le Yang-tse-kiang \u00e0 Tchen-kiang, puis le Houang-h\u00f4 ou Fleuve Jaune et aboutit au Pei-h\u00f4 \u00e0 Tientsin. Ce canal a pu \u00eatre autrefois d'une grande utilit\u00e9, mais le triste \u00e9tat dans lequel il est maintenant laisse supposer qu'il ne sert plus \u00e0 grand'chose: mal entretenu, il s'est ensabl\u00e9 en divers endroits; les digues s'effritent peu \u00e0 peu et ne sont plus r\u00e9par\u00e9es; dans certaines parties de son cours, notamment dans le Chan-toung, le canal n'est plus navigable. Les \u00e9cluses sont abandonn\u00e9es \u00e0 elles-m\u00eames de sorte que, par les temps de s\u00e9cheresse, il n'y a presque plus d'eau dans le canal, et qu'au contraire, par les temps de pluie, l'eau regorge et se r\u00e9pand dans les campagnes. Pour remettre le yun-h\u00f4 en \u00e9tat de navigabilit\u00e9, il faudrait que son lit fut dragu\u00e9 en mains endroits, que les digues fussent r\u00e9par\u00e9es, qu'un syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9cluses bien compris fut organis\u00e9, et que des d\u00e9versoirs et des r\u00e9servoirs fussent construits. Un ing\u00e9nieur anglais, M. G. J. Morrison, qui a parcouru presque tout le canal, a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la d\u00e9pense n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cinq millions de taels environ c'est \u00e0-dire \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de trente cinq millions de francs, somme qu'\u00e0 son dire on pourrait faire rentrer ais\u00e9ment en exigeant des droits de chaque bateau au passage de chaque \u00e9cluse. \"L'avantage d'avoir un bon canal\nserait si grand que les bateliers auraient les moyens de les\nacquitter et pourraient encore transporter des marchandises \u00e0\nplus bas prix qu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent et r\u00e9aliseraient de plus grands b\u00e9n\u00e9-\nfices. Le propri\u00e9taire de la cargaison y gagnerait, les bateliers\ny gagneraient, le gouvernement y gagnerait, ce serait un\ntravail d'un bon rapport et le gouvernement qui l'effectuerait\naurait droit aux remerciements des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations pr\u00e9sentes et\nfutures.\" Dans l'\u00e9tat actuel des choses, on peut affirmer que\nle Canal Imp\u00e9rial est enti\u00e8rement hors de service (unserviceable).\n\nCe canal, qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 primitivement construit que pour en-\nvoyer le tribut en nature annuel (riz) \u00e0 P\u00e9king, ne sert d\u00e9j\u00e0\npresque plus \u00e0 cet usage: il y a beau jour que l'on a song\u00e9 \u00e0\ny renoncer et \u00e0 prendre la voie de mer. On prit cette voie\npour la premi\u00e8re fois sous le r\u00e8gne du dernier empereur de la\ndynastie Mongole, en l'an 1353 de notre \u00e8re: les bateaux\n\u00e9taient petits alors, chacun ne pouvait porter qu'une centaine\nde piculs; ils naviguaient le long de la c\u00f4te. Au commence-\nment de la dynastie des Ming, on employa \u00e0 la fois les deux\nvoies, mais le canal ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9par\u00e9 en 1415 on s'en servit de\nnouveau. Ce ne fut que plus tard, sous Young-tcheng (1723-\n1736) et Kia-ts'ing (1796-1820) que divers m\u00e9moires furent\npr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au tr\u00f4ne demandant la permission d'envoyer une\npartie des grains par mer: mais on objecta que la construction\nde navires pour cet usage et l'\u00e9tablissement de surveillants\nco\u00fbteraient trop cher. Cependant, le canal s'\u00e9tant trouv\u00e9 de\nnouveau impraticable en 1825, on reprit la voie de mer: sur\nl'ordre de l'empereur, le gouverneur du Kiangsou s'\u00e9tablit \u00e0\nChangha\u00ef m\u00eame pour surveiller l'op\u00e9ration et se fit assister par\nle Taota\u00ef de cette ville. Le riz \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 sur des bateaux\nappartenant \u00e0 des particuliers mais fr\u00e9t\u00e9s par le gouvernement\nchinois. Dans l'hiver de cette ann\u00e9e et au printemps de l'an-\nn\u00e9e suivante, 1562 jonques transport\u00e8rent 1,429,000 piculs de\nriz grossier (coarse rice), et 81,000 piculs de riz fin (fine rice).\nPeu apr\u00e8s on se servit de nouveau de la voie canalis\u00e9e, mais\npas pour longtemps, car le Fleuve Jaune ayant chang\u00e9 de lit\nen 1847 on dut revenir \u00e0 la voie de mer pour transporter les\nriz des provinces du Kiang-sou et du Tch\u00e9-kiang. Les rebelles d\u00e9vastant les provinces centrales de l'empire, on ne put de longtemps se servir du canal. Lorsque fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 sous les auspices du c\u00e9l\u00e8bre vice-roi du Tch\u00e9-li, Li Houng-tchang, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, la Grande Compagnie chinoise de navigation \u00e0 vapeur, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Compagnie aurait le monopole du transport du riz : depuis lors tout le riz des provinces m\u00e9ridionales est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 Tientsin par les vapeurs indig\u00e8nes.\n\nDans la partie du Canal Imp\u00e9rial que nous traversons, nous faisons la rencontre d'un grand nombre de jonques destin\u00e9es \u00e0 transporter le riz du Tch\u00e9-kiang et du Kiangsou \u00e0 Changha\u00ef. Ces bateaux sont r\u00e9quisitionn\u00e9s d'ordinaire par le surintendant du riz (lequel a le rang de ta\u00f3-tai ou intendant de cercle). R\u00e9cemment, des rixes qui auraient pu devenir sanglantes, si l'on n'e\u00fbt coup\u00e9 le mal dans sa racine, s'\u00e9taient \u00e9lev\u00e9es entre les propri\u00e9taires de ces jonques : en effet la plupart sont chr\u00e9tiens de p\u00e8re en fils, et, comme il est d'usage qu'une retenue de douze saqu\u00e9ques (environ dix centimes) par picul soit faite sur le montant du fr\u00e9t pour contribuer \u00e0 l'\u00e9dification ou \u00e0 l'entretien des pagodes (en chinois cette contribution est appel\u00e9e \u795e\u798f ch\u00e9n-fou, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 des G\u00e9nies), les chr\u00e9tiens avaient protest\u00e9 contre cet imp\u00f4t comme \u00e9tant incompatible avec les principes de leur religion. Cela fit toute une affaire dont les autorit\u00e9s locales et consulaires furent saisies ; gain de cause resta \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res qui demand\u00e8rent et obtinrent l'exemption de cette contribution pour les chr\u00e9tiens en s'appuyant sur une circulaire explicite du Prince Koung de 1862.\u00b9 De l\u00e0, jalouxie\n\n\u00b9 Cette circulaire ou proclamation (\u8ad6\u55ae yu-tan) du Prince Koung, est dat\u00e9e du mois de janvier de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e \u540c\u6cbb T'oung-tche (f\u00e9vrier 1862). Apr\u00e8s avoir dit que l'Empereur regarde du m\u00eame \u0153il et avec la m\u00eame bont\u00e9 (\u4e00\u8996\u540c\u4ec1) les chr\u00e9tiens et les non-chr\u00e9tiens, le prince ajoute : \"La religion catholique a pour principe d'exhorter les hommes au bien ; sa base est la m\u00eame que celle des doctrines confuc\u00e9ennes, bouddhiques ou tao\u00efstes ; aussi \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de K'aug-Hi il fut permis de la pratiquer. Cependant, les catholiques ne peuvent pr\u00e9texter leur religion pour demander \u00e0 \u00eatre exempt\u00e9s des imp\u00f4ts l\u00e9gitimes, et s'il y a des corv\u00e9es (\u5dee\u5fad) ou des contributions utiles au bien public, ils doivent y contribuer absolument com-\ndes propri\u00e9taires non chr\u00e9tiens qui, furieux d'\u00eatre soumis seuls \u00e0 la retenue, voulaient faire un mauvais parti \u00e0 leurs camarades mieux partag\u00e9s. Il fallut publier une proclamation s\u00e9v\u00e8re pour les engager \u00e0 se tenir tranquilles et \u00e0 ne pas causer de d\u00e9sordres. Pour jouir de la m\u00eame exemption ils auraient pu faire comme leurs compatriotes qui faisaient partie en 1862 du corps franco-chinois : les soldats chr\u00e9tiens ayant une haute paye de neuf piastres par mois (45 francs), tandis que les non chr\u00e9tiens n'en avaient que six (30 francs), nombre de ces derniers s'empress\u00e8rent d'embrasser la religion catholique pour \u00eatre mieux pay\u00e9s.\n\nNous laissons bient\u00f4t le Grand Canal pour en prendre un plus petit qui se dirige vers les montagnes dont les flancs et les cimes d\u00e9coupent \u00e0 l'ouest l'horizon.

Ce dernier, excit\u00e9 par un de ses familiers, Tchouan Tchou, r\u00e9solut de se venger : un jour, il cacha des hommes arm\u00e9s dans une chambre obscure, puis invita le roi L\u00e9a\u00f4 \u00e0 venir assister \u00e0 un festin. L\u00e9a\u00f4 arriva chez son fr\u00e8re avec une suite nombreuse et bien arm\u00e9e qui fit la haie sur son passage et se rangea autour de la salle du festin. Au milieu du repas, Kouang se plaignit de souffrir \u00e0 un pied et se retira en boitant. Il envoya alors Tchouan Tchou porter au roi un poisson recherch\u00e9 dans le ventre duquel \u00e9tait cach\u00e9 un poignard. Arriv\u00e9 devant son souverain, Tchouan Tchou ouvrit tout \u00e0 coup le poisson, saisit le poignard et en frappa L\u00e9a\u00f4 : celui-ci tomba expirant. Tous les assistants fondirent imm\u00e9diatement le sabre en main sur le meurtrier et le mirent en pi\u00e8ces : le tumulte \u00e9tait \u00e0 son comble, lorsque Kouang sortit de sa cachette avec ses gens, attaqua les partisans de L\u00e9a\u00f4, les d\u00e9f\u00eet et les passa tous au fil de l'\u00e9p\u00e9e.

Apr\u00e8s sa mort \"on versa dans son cadavre de l'argent liquide (mercure)\" c'est-\u00e0-dire on l'embauma, puis on pla\u00e7a le cercueil dans trois sarcophages en cuivre : le tout fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque distance de la porte de l'ouest de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, et cent mille hommes, pris dans cette ville, furent employ\u00e9s \u00e0 couvrir le tombeau de terre qu'ils all\u00e8rent prendre sur les bords du Grand lac. On \u00e9leva ainsi une sorte de colline. Trois jours apr\u00e8s l'inhumation, un tigre blanc \u00e9tant venu s'asseoir au sommet de ce monticule, on donna \u00e0 cette \u00e9l\u00e9vation le nom de Colline du Tigre. Dans la suite on b\u00e2tit \u00e0 mi-c\u00f4te un petit temple o\u00f9 fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le poignard qui avait servi \u00e0 tuer le roi L\u00e9a\u00f4.\n\nLorsque, bien des ann\u00e9es plus tard, le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Tsin ch\u00e9-houang, celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui ordonna de br\u00fbler tous les anciens livres et de mettre \u00e0 mort les plus doctes lettr\u00e9s de ses \u00c9tats, arriva \u00e0 Hou-ki\u00e9ou pendant un voyage qu'il faisait dans les provinces m\u00e9ridionales de son empire, il demanda \u00e0 voir ce fameux poignard : comme \u00e0 ce moment, rapporte l'histoire, le tigre \u00e9tait encore assis au sommet de la colline, l'empereur lan\u00e7a cette arme contre lui mais ne l'atteignit pas. Le poignard alla frapper un rocher, l'\u00e9ffleura et disparut dans le sol. Le tigre, effray\u00e9, se sauva dans la direction de l'ouest et cessa d'\u00eatre visible. Tsin ch\u00e9-houang fit faire des fouilles l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il croyait le poignard enseveli : on ne le retrouva pas. On creusa profond\u00e9ment jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'on eut mis \u00e0 jour une source dont l'eau filtrait jadis \u00e0 travers les rocs de la colline et qui, depuis ce jour, s'\u00e9pancha dans un bassin. On appela cet endroit l'\u00c9tang du Poignard.\u00b9\n\nTsin ch\u00e9-houang fit \u00e9galement faire des fouilles pour rechercher le cercueil m\u00eame de H\u00f4-lu, mais on ne parvint pas \u00e0 le d\u00e9couvrir.\n\nLa nappe rocheuse qui s'\u00e9tend devant l'\u00e9tang, est appel\u00e9e la roche des mille, (\u5343\u4eba\u77f3 ts'ien-jen-ch\u00e9) parce que mille\n\n\u00b9.

On raconte \u00e0 ce sujet la l\u00e9gende suivante:\n\n\"\u00c0u Ve si\u00e8cle de notre \u00e8re, un certain bonze nomm\u00e9 Tchou Ta\u00f4, originaire de la province du Tch\u00e9-li, se rendit \u00e0 Tch'ang-an (alors capitale de l'empire, la Si-an-fou de nos jours) pour \u00e9tudier sous le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre bonze Che mi l\u00f4. Peu apr\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e, on apporta de l'Inde les six livres du Ni\u00e9-pan-king (\u6d85\u69c3\u7d93 Nirv\u00e2na Soutra): il y \u00e9tait dit \"Tous les hommes ont de bons sentimens (ceux de F\u00f4 ou du Bouddha) sauf les hommes vicieux (tch'an-t\u00ee).\" Tchou Ta\u00f4 critiqua cette doctrine et affirma que tous les hommes, m\u00eame les vicieux, avaient naturellement de bons sentimens. L\u00e0 dessus on cria \u00e0 l'h\u00e9r\u00e9sie, on chassa Tchou Ta\u00f4, on le honnit de partout. Le bonze, quittant la capitale, fit le serment suivant: \"Que la l\u00e8pre couvre mon corps si la doctrine que je soutiens n'est pas d'accord avec l'esprit des King bouddhiques (\u7d93\u2014Soutra); qu'au contraire ma vie soit courte si elle y est conforme!\" En disant ces mots il secoua la poussi\u00e8re de ses habits et partit. Il voyagea dans diverses provinces: arriv\u00e9 dans celle du Kiang-sou, la Colline du Tigre lui plut; il s'y arr\u00eata et ayant rassembl\u00e9 autour de lui un certain nombre de rochers qui lui form\u00e8rent comme un cercle d'auditeurs, il leur expliqua le Ni\u00e9-pan-king: quand il en fut \u00e0 l'endroit qu'il critiquait, il exposa sa propre doctrine et termina en disant: \"Est-ce que ma pens\u00e9e est conforme \u00e0 celle du Bouddha?\" \u00c0 ces paroles, toutes les pierres s'inclin\u00e8rent en signe d'assentiment. Quelque temps apr\u00e8s, on re\u00e7ut de l'Inde la grande \u00e9dition du Ni\u00e9-pan-king: la doctrine soutenue contre tous par Tchou Ta\u00f4 y \u00e9tait tout au long. Ce livre \u00e0 la main, Tchou Ta\u00f4 parcourut alors l'empire. Se trouvant \u00e0 Lou-chan en l'an 435, il venait de terminer son explication du Nirv\u00e2na, quand tout-\u00e0-coup son chasse-mouches lui tomba des mains, et lui-m\u00eame, s'appuyant sur la petite table o\u00f9 se trouvait sa tasse de th\u00e9, resta sans\nmouvement : il \u00e9tait mort.\"1\n\nA mi-c\u00f4te \u00e9tait jadis la tombe d\u2019une beaut\u00e9 de Sou-tch\u00e9ou qui avait refus\u00e9 de se remarier apr\u00e8s la mort de son mari et dont les po\u00e8tes ne cess\u00e8rent pendant longtemps de vanter les charmes et la vertu : c\u2019\u00e9tait le \u8c9e\u5a18\u57fa Tchen-niang-mou, Tombeau de la Chaste Epouse.2 Une vieille description de Hon-ki\u00e9ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la dynastie des T\u2019ang rapporte que les voyageurs venaient faire un p\u00e8lerinage \u00e0 ce tombeau et y inscrivaient quelques vers en l\u2019honneur de la d\u00e9funte. Mais un beau jour, un po\u00e8te de ce temps composa une pi\u00e8ce de vers si admirable que nul n\u2019osa d\u00e9sormais plus rimer sur le m\u00eame sujet.\n\nDe l\u2019esplanade un bel et large escalier conduit au temple actuel : ainsi que de coutume, il s\u2019y trouve plusieurs statues dor\u00e9es du Bouddha devant lesquelles br\u00fblent des chandelles\n\n---\n\n1.

Il faut dire que, tout en ayant refus\u00e9 de se marier en souvenir de son mari, cette beaut\u00e9 devint une \u201cirr\u00e9guli\u00e8re\u201d et, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses chants et \u00e0 sa danse, fut class\u00e9e parmi les plus renomm\u00e9es courtisanes de Sou-tch\u00e9ou.

Un po\u00e8te de la dynastie des T\u2019ang qui visita Hon-Ki\u00e9ou rapporta que le tombeau \u00e9tait couvert d\u2019herbe et de fleurs et que le soir, quand une l\u00e9g\u00e8re brise soufflait et qu\u2019une fine pluie tombait en forme de ros\u00e9e, on entendait le \u201cbruit des instruments et le son des chansons.\u201d Ce tombeau a exerc\u00e9 la verve de nombreux po\u00e8tes : on nous permettra de citer ici les jolis vers que \u767d\u6a02\u5929 P\u00f4 L\u00f4-t\u2019ien, un des plus fameux po\u00e8tes de l\u2019\u00e9poque des T\u2019ang et aussi amoureux de la divine bouteille que son illustre contemporain \u674e\u592a\u767d Li T\u2019ai-p\u00f4, a compos\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet :\n\nLe tombeau de la Chaste Epouse est situ\u00e9 sur la route de Hon-Ki\u00e9ou :\nJe n\u2019ai pas vu la Chaste Epouse se regarder dans le miroir,\nJe vois seulement son tombeau couvert d\u2019herbes.\nDe m\u00eame que les fleurs du p\u00eacher et du prunier sont d\u00e9truites par le givre,\net les n\u00e9nuphars sont rompus par le vent,\nDe m\u00eame la Chaste Epouse est morte encore \u00e0 la fleur de l\u2019\u00e2ge.\nLongtemps ne peuvent durer une peau douce et une main blanche :\nEn ce monde rien n\u2019est si difficile que de t\u00e2cher de conserver quelque chose si pr\u00e9cieux (i.e. une belle femme) :\nCar rien ne s\u2019alime aussi facilement et aussi rapidement :\nComme les fleurs dans les pays du nord et la neige dans ceux du sud.\nparfum\u00e9es. Laissant cet \u00e9difice \u00e0 droite nous gravissons la derni\u00e8re \u00e9minence: c'est l\u00e0, au milieu de d\u00e9combres et de ruines, que s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve la pagode de Hou-ki\u00e9ou. Elle est aujourd'hui dans un triste \u00e9tat: \u00e9corn\u00e9e, trou\u00e9e par des projectiles, vestiges de la guerre civile, elle penche dangereusement d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, comme la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre tour de Bologne. Les petits toits \u00e0 clochettes qui devraient exister \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tage sont d\u00e9truits, les parois s'\u00e9ffritent lentement et de longues herbes poussent dans les fentes: une l\u00e9gion de corbeaux habite le sommet.\n\nNous trouvons l\u00e0 trois bonzes, gardiens et habitans de la tour: en les saluant nous disons \u00e0 la chinoise:\n\n\u2014Ta-sse-fou, nin fa-'ha\u00f4? Grand ma\u00eetre, quel est votre nom en religion?\n\nUne fois entr\u00e9s dans les ordres les bonzes n'ont plus de sing, de nom patronymique; ils prennent un surnom sous lequel ils sont d\u00e8s lors connus: ayant quitt\u00e9 totalement ce monde, ayant renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ses pompes, ils ne doivent plus avoir rien de commun avec lui. Ce surnom ou fa-ha\u00f4 a son \u00e9quivalent chez nous: on prend un nom de saint quand on entre en religion.\n\nCes pauvres bonzes nous re\u00e7oivent avec amabilit\u00e9 et politesse: ils nous donnent le nom de yang-si\u00e9-seng, Monsieur l'europ\u00e9en; ils nous invitent \u00e0 nous asseoir, \u00e0 prendre du th\u00e9. Nos gants les intriguent fort: ils croient d'abord que c'est notre peau qui a cette couleur mais nous les d\u00e9trompons vite, \u00e0 leur ahurissement, en les \u00f4tant; notre canne, dont ils ignorent l'usage, est prise par eux pour une longue pipe: ces bonzes sont log\u00e9s au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e de la pagode, dans des niches autrefois occup\u00e9es par des statues bouddhiques: leur mobilier se compose d'une mauvaise natte \u00e9tendue sur la pierre nue, d'un escabeau boiteux, d'un brasero en bronze rouill\u00e9, de l'indispensable pipe-\u00e0-eau et de la th\u00e9i\u00e8re de fer-blanc. Ils subviennent \u00e0 leur existence en allant qu\u00eater dans les bourgs et villages voisins.\n\nNous aurions d\u00e9sir\u00e9 monter jusqu'au sommet de la pagode\npour contempler le panorama des environs de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, mais malheureusement l'escalier vermoulu et branlant s'arr\u00eate au premier \u00e9tage et est obstru\u00e9 par des d\u00e9combres : au dessus logent des l\u00e9gions de corbeaux qui, au moindre bruit, sortent par les fen\u00eatres d\u00e9chiquet\u00e9es et d\u00e9crivent pendant longtemps de longs cercles noirs autour du sommet.\n\nMille oiseaux effrayans, mille corbeaux fun\u00e8bres,\nde ces murs d\u00e9sert\u00e9s habitent les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres.\n\nAu moment de prendre cong\u00e9 de ces d\u00e9guenill\u00e9s anachor\u00e8tes, l'un d'entre eux nous pr\u00e9sente un livre \u00e0 couverture rouge en nous priant de vouloir bien donner quelques sap\u00e8ques pour la reconstruction du temple, et d'y inscrire notre nom \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ceux qui en ornent les pages. Nous sommes oblig\u00e9s de d\u00e9lier les cordons de notre bourse, bien certains cependant que notre don servira, non pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9dification d'un nouveau temple, pas plus peut-\u00eatre qu'aux frais du culte, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l'entretien des bonzes m\u00eame.\n\nL'un d'eux, vieillard \u00e0 face rid\u00e9e et \u00e0 bonne humeur, nous reconduit \u00e0 travers les ruines. Il nous raconte que, jadis, les coteaux aujourd'hui si d\u00e9sol\u00e9s \u00e9taient embellis de magnifiques temples et de gracieux pavillons o\u00f9 la jeunesse de Sou-tch\u00e9ou venait de temps \u00e0 autre festoyer en partie de plaisir et composer des po\u00e9sies \u00e0 l'ombre des saules. \"Il y avait, nous dit-il, le Pavillon des fleurs de prunier, le Pavillon de la vaste plaine et le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Temple de la colline nuageuse qui fut visit\u00e9 par l'empereur K'ien-loung et inspira \u00e0 ce souverain nombre de pi\u00e8ces de po\u00e9sie. C'est l\u00e0 que l'on conservait un tr\u00e9pied en bronze de la dynastie des Tch\u00e9ou (IX\u1d49 si\u00e8cle avant notre \u00e8re) : transmis de famille en famille, et de g\u00e9n\u00e9rations en g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, un bonze l'avait achet\u00e9 vers la fin du XVIII\u1d49 si\u00e8cle et en avait fait don au temple. On l'y gardait pr\u00e9cieusement dans une salle dont il ne sortait jamais. Pour le rendre intranportable, on l'avait rempli de cendres et de poussi\u00e8re. Malheureusement quand les imp\u00e9riaux d\u00e9truisirent le temple dont les rebelles avaient fait une citadelle, il disparut.\"\nEn ce moment le bronze nous montre un canon en bronze rouill\u00e9, sans aff\u00fbt, gisant \u00e0 terre.\n\n\u2014Tenez, dit-il, voil\u00e0 encore un des canons dont les Hommes \u00e0 long cheveux avaient arm\u00e9 la Colline du Tigre. Figurez-vous que lors de la prise de Sou-tch\u00e9ou par les imp\u00e9riaux et de la dispersion des rebelles dans les environs du Grand Lac, un certain nombre de ces derniers, command\u00e9s par un de leurs plus braves officiers, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral M\u00e2, poursuivis de pr\u00e8s par les troupes du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral imp\u00e9rial Tch'eng, se r\u00e9fugi\u00e8rent dans le bourg de Hou-ki\u00e9ou et dans les temples et \u00e9difices qui occupaient \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque toute la colline. Sous la direction active de M\u00e2, les rebelles fortifi\u00e8rent en un instant le bourg et la colline, y plac\u00e8rent quelques pi\u00e8ces de canon qu'ils avaient pu entra\u00eener dans leur d\u00e9route, et Hou-ki\u00e9ou, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa situation naturelle, devint une redoute r\u00e9ellement formidable. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral M\u00e2 attendit les imp\u00e9riaux de pied ferme : il avait sous ses ordres une femme digne des temps antiques qui, c\u00e9l\u00e8bre par sa beaut\u00e9 autant que par sa cruaut\u00e9 et sa sauvage \u00e9nergie, conduisait au combat une troupe de Cantonnais et de Fokiennais.\u00b9 D\u00e8s leur arriv\u00e9e, les imp\u00e9riaux s'empar\u00e8rent du bourg mollement d\u00e9fendu, mais, quand ils arriv\u00e8rent au pied de la colline, ils furent accueillis par une si chaude fusillade qu'ils recul\u00e8rent en d\u00e9sordre ; ils cern\u00e8rent alors la redoute, puis, mettant en batterie quelques canons, d\u00e9molirent les murs des temples : la br\u00e8che faite, ils se lanc\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'assaut, mais, \u00e0 la place d'une muraille renvers\u00e9e ils trouv\u00e8rent un mur humain ; les rebelles, arm\u00e9s de fusils europ\u00e9ens, de lances, de gaffes, brandissant des \u00e9tendards de diverses couleurs, les attendaient de pied ferme : ce fut une m\u00eal\u00e9e effroyable. Le ciel \u00e9tait obscurci par la fum\u00e9e de la poudre, et l'air \u00e9tait rempli du bruit de la\n\n\u00b9 L'histoire de la r\u00e9bellion mentionne plusieurs amazones de ce genre : la fille de Tch\u00e9ou Li-tch'oun, l'un des chefs de l'insurrection locale de Chang-hai en 1854, conduisait un bataillon contre les Imp\u00e9riaux qui assi\u00e9geaient la ville ; plusieurs autres se distingu\u00e8rent de m\u00eame lors du si\u00e8ge de Nanking par les Imp\u00e9riaux en 1864. Ce furent ces femmes, vraies furies, qui se battirent avec le plus d'acharnement et de cruaut\u00e9.\nfusillade et des cris sauvages que poussaient les deux partis. Deux fois les imp\u00e9riaux tent\u00e8rent de passer, deux fois ils furent repouss\u00e9s. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral M\u00e2, arm\u00e9, d\u2019une main, d\u2019un \u00e9ventail, et de l\u2019autre, de son parasol, encore que le chaleur ne fut plus tr\u00e8s forte \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, se portait sur les points les plus menac\u00e9s, donnait des ordres avec calme, et encourageait les siens du geste et de la voix au milieu d\u2019une gr\u00eale de balles qui trouvait son ombrelle et semait la mort \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s le second assaut, il y eut plusieurs heures de r\u00e9pit pendant lesquelles les canons imp\u00e9riaux eurent la parole : ceux-ci tonn\u00e8rent avec rage, achev\u00e8rent de d\u00e9truire les temples et constructions en y mettant le feu. Ce que voyant, Tch\u2019eng donna l\u2019ordre de tenter un nouvel assaut ; les rebelles, \u00e9puis\u00e9s par leur premi\u00e8re d\u00e9fense, d\u00e9cim\u00e9s, sur le point de manquer de munitions, ne purent r\u00e9sister \u00e0 cette nouvelle attaque. Les imp\u00e9riaux, furieux d\u2019une si longue r\u00e9sistance, p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e8rent dans les temples et pass\u00e8rent au fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e tous ceux qu\u2019ils prirent : \u00e0 la faveur de la nuit qui survint, pendant le carnage, quelques rebelles purent s\u2019\u00e9chapper, mais, reconnus par les paysans \u00e0 cause de la longue chevelure qu\u2019ils portaient comme signe de ralliement, ils furent \u00e9charp\u00e9s par eux dans les campagnes. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral M\u00e2 p\u00e9rit en combattant et quelques jours plus tard on trouva son cadavre, perc\u00e9 de coups et de balles, presque d\u00e9figur\u00e9, au pied m\u00eame de la pagode.\n\n\u201cNous autres, pauvres bonzes, nous nous \u00e9tions enfuis d\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des rebelles et \u00e9tions all\u00e9 nous cacher dans l\u2019un des temples du bourg qui, n\u2019ayant pas fait de r\u00e9sistance, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9pargn\u00e9. Le lendemain de la prise de Hou-ki\u00e9ou nous sortimes de bonne heure pour voir ce qui restait de notre temple. Le soleil venait de se lever sur le champ de bataille de la veille : on apercevait \u00e0 travers le brouillard, lent \u00e0 se dissiper, les retranchements couverts de cadavres amoncel\u00e9s ; les murailles des temples \u00e9taient presque toutes d\u00e9truites ; les temples eux-m\u00eames, abattus par la mitraille, gisaient en ruine et les toitures \u00e0 demi-carbonis\u00e9es fumaient encore ; la pagode, elle, \u00e9tait encore debout, mais hach\u00e9e et cribl\u00e9e de projectiles : elle sem-\nblait contempler d'un air morne et triste cette sc\u00e8ne de d\u00e9sola-\ntion. La colline \u00e9tait jonch\u00e9e de cadavres mutil\u00e9s ou \u00e0 demi-\nd\u00e9vor\u00e9s par les flammes : les rebelles, sauvages dans leur h\u00e9ro-\nisme, s'\u00e9taient bravement fait tuer \u00e0 leur poste par les imp\u00e9ri-\naux et m\u00eame par leurs propres canons : plusieurs de ceux-ci,\nen effet, de mauvaise qualit\u00e9 ou trop charg\u00e9s, avaient \u00e9clat\u00e9 et,\nau lieu de r\u00e9pandre la mort parmi l'ennemi, l'avaient sem\u00e9e\nalentour, dans les propres rangs des Hommes \u00e0 longs cheveux.\nIl ne restait plus des courageux d\u00e9fenseurs de Hou-ki\u00e9ou qu'un\namas confus de morts, de bless\u00e9s et d'agonisants, et d'un beau\nlieu de plaisance, qu'un monceau indescriptible de ruines\nfumantes . . .\n\nEn revenant \u00e0 bord nous visitons le temple \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00e9-\nmoire d'un haut fonctionnaire de la dynastie des Ming \u5f35\u7389\u7b25\nTchang Yu-sseu (ou \u5f35\u516c Tchang Koung), qui, nous dit\nl'inscription plac\u00e9e au sommet de l'arc-de-triomphe debout sur\nle bord du chemin, a couvert de bienfaits les populations de la\nprovince \u5357\u6771\u88ab\u6fa4. Ce temple se compose de plusieurs\nconstructions assez jolies et bien entretenues ; un des kiosques\nporte le nom de \u8336\u6a13 fou-l\u00e9ou, Pavillon des plantains : au\nsecond \u00e9tage, appendue \u00e0 la muraille, ou lit toute la biographie\nde Tchang.\n\nApr\u00e8s un d\u00e9jeuner consistant surtout en excellents petits\ngoujons p\u00each\u00e9s dans le canal de Hou-ki\u00e9ou, nous levons l'an-\ncre : nous prenons un canal qui se dirige vers le sud-est et qui,\n\u00e0 peu de distance de l\u00e0, aboutit \u00e0 un carrefour de \"ces chemins\nqui marchent et qui portent o\u00f9 l'on veut aller,\" comme Pascal\nappelle les rivi\u00e8res. Nous entrons dans la rivi\u00e8re de gauche\net, apr\u00e8s quelques lis de navigation, arr\u00eatons notre maison\nflottante pr\u00e8s du village de Ts'a\u00f4-menn. Sur la rive gauche\nse trouve un petit temple appel\u00e9 \u897f\u5712\u6212\u5e62\u5bfa Si-yuan kie-\ntoung sseu, assez peu int\u00e9ressant par lui-m\u00eame du reste : rien\nde particulier \u00e0 voir, sinon une grand mare, o\u00f9 une belle tor-\nture d'un m\u00e8tre de circonf\u00e9rence prend ses \u00e9bats. Plus loin,\ns'\u00e9tend le \u7559\u5712 L\u00e9ou-yuan, jardin L\u00e9ou, o\u00f9 l'on entre, comme\ntoujours, moyennant quelques sap\u00e8ques. C'est un des plus beaux jardins que l'on puisse voir dans cette partie de la province : kiosques, pavillons sur rochers, all\u00e9es couvertes, galeries aux mille d\u00e9tours, labyrinthes \u00e9troits, roches fantastiques, lacs \u00e0 n\u00e9nuphars, rien ne manque. Il y a de plus un groupe d'arbres de fort belle taille. Les salons des pavillons sont richement meubl\u00e9s : canap\u00e9s laqu\u00e9s, chaises incrust\u00e9es de plaques de marbre de T\u00e2-li-fou, tables de marbre blanc, pancartes \u00e0 beaux caract\u00e8res, pendules venues de Paris en passant par Changha\u00ef, etc. Un joli kiosque domine tout le jardin : il porte l'inscription suivante :\n\n\u958b\u6728\u6a3a\u9999\u8ed2\n\n\"Cabinet o\u00f9 l'on respire le parfum de l'olea fragrans \u00e0 fleurs rouges.\"\n\nDans une cage, \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e, deux magnifiques paons au brillant plumage, venus de l'Annam.\n\nNous recommandons ce jardin, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement peu connu, aux excursionistes dans cette partie de la province du Kiang-sou.\n\nRevenus \u00e0 bord, nous tournons le dos \u00e0 Ts'a\u00f4-meun, continuons le canal jusqu'\u00e0 un village dont le nom nous \u00e9chappe et prenons \u00e0 gauche. Sur notre chemin, les ponts, coup\u00e9s par les rebelles, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconstruits, et des amas de pierres, gisant de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 du cours d'eau, en indique l'ancien emplacement. Cette route est assez fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e : on y rencontre de nombreux trains de bois se dirigeant sur Sou-tch\u00e9ou, ainsi que des barques de plaisance, orn\u00e9es de petits rubans rouges et de lanternes de papier, pleines de joyeux lettr\u00e9s jouant aux \u00e9checs ou \u00e0 la mourre pour \u00e9gayer la lenteur du voyage, qui se dirigent vers les montagnes et le Grand Lac.\n\nVers les deux heures nous entrons dans une jolie rivi\u00e8re, ombrag\u00e9e par deux rang\u00e9es d'arbres touffus et dont les branchages s'unissent en arcades au dessus de l'eau. Nous nous ancrons bient\u00f4t au pied de trois ou quatre chaumi\u00e8res et non loin d'un vieux pont rompu dont les tron\u00e7ons disparaissent aujourd'hui sous la mousse et des plantes grimpantes. D\u00e9barquant aussit\u00f4t nous suivons le chemin rocailleux qui so\nd\u00e9roule \u00e0 travers champs, comme un reptile, tout en s'allongeant vers les montagnes. Au pied m\u00eame de la cha\u00eene, le chemin fait place \u00e0 un escalier dont les marches ont bien quatre m\u00e8tres de long sur trois de large; il est encaiss\u00e9 entre deux versans couverts de pins et de bambous. Au sommet de la montagne, que les chinois d\u00e9nomment Kouan-yn-chan (Kou-yn-sui), Montagne de la D\u00e9esse Kouan-yn (Avalokite\u015bvara) le chemin dall\u00e9 passe sous une sorte de pont en rocs \u00e9quarris qui relie les hauteurs de droite \u00e0 celle de gauche et forme un passage vo\u00fbt\u00e9 de quelques m\u00e8tres; lorsqu'on sort de ce passage, la vue s'\u00e9tend sur une grand vall\u00e9e: devant soi, le chemin descend en pente rapide; \u00e0 gauche, des hauteurs abruptes; \u00e0 droite une grande masse rocheuse dont les rocs pointus semblent, selon l'expression chinoise \"vouloir percer le ciel\"; \u00e0 son flanc on aper\u00e7oit suspendu, \u00e0 travers de beaux et grands arbres qui en cachent une partie, un joli temple bouddhique entour\u00e9 de verdure. Le soleil, se faufilant par des \u00e9chapp\u00e9es de branchages, miroite sur les tuiles verniss\u00e9es du toit; ses rayons \u00e9clairent lumineusement les chim\u00e8res dor\u00e9es et les dragons fantastiques des corniches et des cheneaux. Les rochers noirs, aux pointes ac\u00e9r\u00e9es, \u00e9pars sur les flancs et le sommet de la montagne, s\u00e9par\u00e9s ici et l\u00e0 par des arbustes ou des \u00eelots de verdure, font le plus bizarre effet: on dirait les arbres d'une for\u00eat p\u00e9trifi\u00e9e.\n\nLe paysage est vraiment joli et pittoresque; un artiste pourrait faire l\u00e0 un tableau des plus gracieux: la nature chinoise dans toute sa beaut\u00e9. Mais les artistes ne viennent pas en Chine: les peintres de sujets orientaux parcourrent toujours les chemins rebattus de l'Egypte, de la Syrie, de la Turquie, en qu\u00eate de sujets nouveaux, et sont souvent r\u00e9duits \u00e0 revenir au tableau classique de ces pays d'Orient: un d\u00e9sert, un ciel bleu, un chameau, et un arabe accroupi. Que ne viennent-ils en Chine? ils trouveraient l\u00e0 des sujets de tableaux bien plus vari\u00e9s, bien plus originaux, et ayant en outre l'attrait de la nouveaut\u00e9. Mais ce mot de Chine les effraye, et ceux qui n'ont jamais quitt\u00e9 leurs foyers croient qu'on ne revient pas du C\u00e9-\nl'interieur de la Chine.\n\nleste Empire: ils ne savent pas qu'en quarante jours, sans fatigue, sans soucis, on est \u00e0 Changha\u00ef, et qu'en six mois un artiste pourrait faire la plus belle moisson de croquis, d'\u00e9tudes, et de tableaux que l'imagination la plus active d'un futur Poussin ait pu jamais r\u00eaver!...\n\nCette montagne porte le nom de \u5929\u5e73\u5c71 T'ien-p'ing-chan, Montagne qui est au m\u00eame niveau que le ciel: c'est l'une des plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres de la province. Un po\u00e8te de la Dynastie des Sung (XIe si\u00e8cle de notre \u00e8re) a dit:\n\nLe royaume de Vou est entour\u00e9 de nombreuses montagnes:\nIl est impossible de les compter toutes;\nparmi elles il en est une qui s'appelle T'ien-p'ing-chan,\nc'est de toutes la plus grande et la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\n\nLe temple situ\u00e9 \u00e0 mi-c\u00f4te est appel\u00e9 \u767d\u96f2\u5bfa P\u00f4-yun-sseu, Temple des nuages blancs, mais on lui donne plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement celui de \u5929\u5e73\u5bfa t'ien-p'ing-sseu, Temple de t'ien-p'ing.\n\nApr\u00e8s avoir descendu rapidement la pente qui longe le mur d'enceinte du parc de T'ien-p'ing-sseu, nous arrivons devant une large br\u00e8che creus\u00e9e dans le mur \u00e0 peu de distance de la grande porte: par l\u00e0 nous entrons dans le parc. Abrit\u00e9 par de grands et beaux arbres, un grand \u00e9tang \u00e0 demi cach\u00e9 sous de larges feuilles de n\u00e9nuphar pr\u00e9c\u00e8de l'entr\u00e9e du temple: cet \u00e9tang est divis\u00e9 en deux bassins, pour ainsi dire, par une petite chauss\u00e9e en pierres moussues qui d\u00e9crit des contours gracieux en s'acheminant vers le temple. Sous les n\u00e9nuphars, des arm\u00e9es de petits poissons argent\u00e9s et dor\u00e9s se jouent dans les minces rayons de soleil filtrant \u00e0 travers les feuilles; quelques grenouilles \u00e9meraudes, r\u00e9veill\u00e9es de leur sommeil paresseux, sautent tout \u00e9perdues et vont se cacher au fond de l'eau; tout autour, dans le feuillage, des insectes bruissent avec force.\n\nLe temple est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'un perron auquel plusieurs degr\u00e9s donnent acc\u00e8s: on trouve d'abord une salle ouverte appel\u00e9e \u9ad8\u7fa9\u5712 Ka\u00f4-y-yuan, Jardin de la Haute justice, garnie de tables et de banc. C'est l'empereur K'ien-loung qui lui a donn\u00e9 ce nom lors de la visite qu'il fit en 1756 au T'ien-p'ing-chan. Un bonze vient \u00e0 notre rencontre et nous prie fort poliment de nous assoir \u00e0 une table: pendant ce temps, un autre\napporte une tasse de th\u00e9 et une pipe qu\u2019il place devant nous, enfin un troisi\u00e8me vient nous tendre un grand plateau rond divis\u00e9s en plusieurs compartiments dans chacun desquels s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent, sur de petites assiettes, des pyramides de tranches de pommes, de poires, d\u2019olives sucr\u00e9es, de confitures s\u00e8ches, de segments d\u2019orange, de g\u00e2teaux feuillet\u00e9s, etc. Repos\u00e9s de notre marche, un bonze va, \u00e0 notre demande, ouvrir une porte au fond \u00e0 gauche : elle donne acc\u00e8s aux autres constructions du temple. Le bonze, ayant re\u00e7u une enfilade de sap\u00e8ques pour reconna\u00eetre ses bons offices, referme la porte derri\u00e8re nous ; nous gravissons un certain nombre de degr\u00e9s et atteignons le vrai Temple des Nuages Blancs. Ce temple se compose de plusieurs pavillons reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres par d\u2019\u00e9troits couloirs \u00e0 niches de Bouddhas : une odeur agr\u00e9able, due aux bougies parfum\u00e9es qui br\u00fblent devant les autels, se fait sentir en ces lieux. Au centre, une source sourd entre les rochers ; on lit grav\u00e9 sur le roc :\n\n\u5433\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e00\u6c34\n\nLe premier cours d\u2019eau de la province du Kiang-sou.\n\nVis-\u00e0-vis, une petite salle orn\u00e9e d\u2019une statue du Bouddha aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de laquelle pendent les deux inscriptions suivantes :\n\n\u5dba\u4e0a\u96f2\u5bb9\u539f\u53ef\u6085\n\u5c71\u4e2d\u6cc9\u60c5\u81ea\u7136\u6e05\n\nL\u2019aspect des nuages sur la montagne est agr\u00e9able (\u00e0 voir) ; l\u2019eau de la source de la montagne est naturellement limpide.\n\nCe temple des Nuages Blancs fut primitivement construit en 827 sous la dynastie des T\u2019ang : les anc\u00eatres du c\u00e9l\u00e8bre ministre d\u2019Etat \u8303\u4ef2\u6df9 Fan Tchoung-yen, de la dynastie des Soung, y \u00e9tant enterr\u00e9s, ce dernier obtint de l\u2019empereur de l\u2019appeler \u529f\u5fb7\u5bfa Koung-t\u00f4-sseu, Temple de la Vertu et du M\u00e9rite. Cet \u00e9difice fut d\u00e9truit par un incendie vers la fin de la dynastie mongole, puis reconstruit d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es du r\u00e8gne de Houng-vou, fondateur de la dynastie des Ming.\n\nLes bonzes nous paraissent assez hospitaliers : ils n\u2019ont pas l\u2019air de s\u2019\u00e9tonner de voir des europ\u00e9ens dans leur sanctuaire.\nCeux qui nous rencontrent s'inclinent l'air b\u00e9at, les mains crois\u00e9es sous leurs longues manches rabattues, et nous saluent d'une l\u00e9g\u00e8re r\u00e9v\u00e9rence. D'aucuns, accroupis dans des encoignures, pr\u00e8s d'une statue dor\u00e9e du Bouddha, marmotent des pri\u00e8res dont sans doute ils ignorent le sens et qu'ils r\u00e9p\u00e8tent par habitude.\n\nDel\u00e0, circulant entre les hauts rochers fantastiques, tout habill\u00e9s de mousse, qui se dressent les uns \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des autres, nous gravissons la montagne : le chemin est abrupte et la mont\u00e9e fatigante. Jadis le sommet \u00e9tait surmont\u00e9 d'un \u00e9l\u00e9gant kiosque appel\u00e9 \u671b\u6e56\u53f0 Ouang-'hou-t'ai, Terrasse d'o\u00f9 l'on regarde le lac, mais il a disparu ; il n'en reste m\u00eame plus de vestiges. De l\u00e0 on jouit d'une fort belle vue sur la campagne avoisinante : on est en quelque sorte r\u00e9compens\u00e9 de la peine que l'on s'est donn\u00e9e.\n\n\u00c0 l'ouest on aper\u00e7oit le Grand Lac (\u592a\u6e56 t'ai-'hou) avec sa vaste \u00e9tendue, ses \u00eeles parsem\u00e9es comme autant de taches noires, et ses esquifs microscopiques qui viennent de faire voile d'une anse de la c\u00f4te ou de l'une des \u00eeles. Autour du T'ien-p'ing-chan, de hautes collines dont notre batelier devenu cicerone nous donne les noms : \u00e0 l'est, la montagne de la cage \u00e0 poulets ; au sud, la colline du boyau de mouton, etc. \u00c0 nos pieds, s'\u00e9talant jusqu'au bas des hauteurs, la plaine chaudement \u00e9clair\u00e9e par le soleil : quelques rares maisons ou cabanes \u00e9mergent des champs ; ici et l\u00e0, une petite agglom\u00e9ration de chaumi\u00e8res entour\u00e9es de verdure, apparaissant comme des \u00eelots au milieu d'un lac ; des canaux \u00e9tincelants, semblables \u00e0 de longs sillons d'argent aux m\u00e9andres capricieux. \u00c0 l'est s'aper\u00e7oivent distinctement les maisons, les murs et la haute pagode de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, puis, plus loin et confus\u00e9ment, la ville de K'oun-chan dont la pagode, perch\u00e9e sur sa colline solitaire, ressemble \u00e0 une fine aiguille fich\u00e9e solitairement dans une pelote.\n\nComme nous ne voulons pas revenir par le m\u00eame chemin nous redescendons la montagne de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, descente qui\nn\u2019est pas sans danger, car nos bottines clou\u00e9es glissent sur les rochers gluans et sans l\u2019aide de notre cicerone dont les souliers de paille se fixent mieux sur le roc, nous aurions roul\u00e9 dans l\u2019ab\u00eeme b\u00e9ant. De roc en roc, d\u2019arbuste en arbuste, nous arrivons \u00e0 une petite route encaiss\u00e9e qui circule le long de la montagne. Quel ne dut pas \u00eatre l\u2019\u00e9tonnement des braves bonzes du temple des Nuages Blancs en ne voyant pas les \u201cdiables \u00e9trangers\u201d redescendre de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9! peut-\u00eatre crurent-ils que le Bouddha leur avait ouvert son paradis?\n\nLe chemin remonte \u00e0 mi-c\u00f4te de la montagne voisine, appel\u00e9e, nous dit notre cicerone, le mont \u652f\u7834 Tche-yng. \u00c0 chaque pas l\u2019on rencontre des maisons en ruines dont les murs sont noircis par l\u2019incendie. Ce sont les traces encore vives du passage des Hommes \u00e0 longs cheveux. Des ruisseaux descendent en clapotant du sommet de la montagne et se pr\u00e9cipitent vers la plaine en d\u00e9chaussant quelques rocs sur leur passage ou en creusant leur lit \u00e0 travers. Non loin de l\u00e0 est le \u4e2d\u5cf0\u53e4\u5239 Tchoung-foung kou-tcha, Ancien Temple du Pic du Milieu que la r\u00e9bellion a presque enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9truit: \u00e0 terre git la partie sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019un superbe Bouddha de pl\u00e2tre peint. \u00c0 quelques pas on reconstruit un nouveau temple le \u652f\u7834\u53e4\u5239 Tche-yng kou-tcha, ancien temple de Tche-yng. \u00c0 la porte, un d\u00e9bit de th\u00e9 o\u00f9 sont attabl\u00e9s des campagnards qui viennent de ramasser des pommes de pin sous les arbres r\u00e9sineux des coteaux. Dans le sanctuaire se trouve une belle statue de la D\u00e9esse Kouan-yn, et un autel orn\u00e9 d\u2019un bouddha au-dessus duquel on lit \u9748\u5c71\u798f\u5730 Ling-chan Fou-ti, terre heureuse de la montagne intelligente. Au pied, un panier rond avec ces mots:\n\n\u82b1\u9999\u9322\u529f\u5fb7\u7121\u91cf\nQuand vous d\u00e9pensez votre argent \u00e0 faire br\u00fbler des parfums, les r\u00e9compenses que vous m\u00e9ritez n\u2019ont pas de limites.\n\nSur les colonnes on voit l\u2019inscription suivante qui rappelle le \u201ctake care of pickpockets male and female\u201d de Londres:\n\n\u9999\u5ba2\u8863\u5305\u7269\u4ef6\u5404\u81ea\u7167\u7ba1\nQue les fid\u00e8les veillent eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 leurs paquets et objets.\nIl y a partout des volcurs, mais, en Chine, le vol a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 la hauteur d'une institution.\n\nPlusieurs autres salles sont remplies de statues toutes neuves, ruisselantes de dorures et \u00e9clatantes de couleurs vives : dans l'une pontifie le fameux et terrible \u95bb\u7f85\u738b Yen-l\u00f4-ouang (Y\u00e2ma r\u00e2dja), le Roi des Enfers. Devant, un kiosque mobile pouvant tourner sur pivot, \u00e0 niches garnies de petits Bouddhas.\n\nQuand nous sortons de ce temple il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 tard et le soleil rougit le sommet du T'ien-p'ing chan et du Tche-yng chan : \u00e0 travers champs nous regagnons notre bateau o\u00f9 nous passons la nuit.\n\nLe lendemain matin, \u00e0 l'aube, un bruit de cha\u00eenes secou\u00e9es et de pas pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9s nous r\u00e9veille : c'est le branle-bas du d\u00e9part. L'\u00e9quipage l\u00e8ve l'ancre et largue les amarres. Bient\u00f4t notre bateau reprends sa route et glisse sur l'eau encore endormie. La brume du matin se dissipe peu \u00e0 peu : sur la rive, des campagnardes arrivent en se dandinant sur leurs petits pieds, portant, qui du linge et des habits pour les laver dans la rivi\u00e8re, qui des sceaux et des paniers de riz, pour les r\u00e2cler et les balayer au bord de l'eau. Des enfants \u00e0 peine \u00e9veill\u00e9s, les yeux encore bouffis de sommeil, apparaissent demi-nus aux portes des chaumi\u00e8res ; d'affreux chiens chinois au museau allong\u00e9, v\u00e9ritables chacals, aboyent contre nous et se r\u00e9pondent l'un \u00e0 l'autre ; des buffles levant la t\u00eate pardessus les arbustes de la rive et reniflent en grognant sourdement, contre les \u00e9trangers qui troublent leur qui\u00e9tude. De ce c\u00f4t\u00e9, la campagne est presque nue : des buissons, des arbustes ornent les rives. Au del\u00e0, des champs \u00e0 perte de vue.\n\nApr\u00e8s une heure et demie de navigation nous arrivons \u00e0 \u6728\u6f23 Mou-t\u00f4 (M\u00f4-d\u00f4), grand entassement de maisons qui, n'\u00e9tant pas enceint de murailles, porte le nom de \u93ae tchen, bourg, et n'a pas le droit d'avoir celui de \u57ce tch'eng, ville fortifi\u00e9e. Audessus s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent le M\u00f4-d\u00f4 san et sa haute pagode : rien de particulier \u00e0 voir. Notre cic\u00e9rone nous dit gravement dans le patois du pays :\n\u2014M's\u00e2 'hu\u00f4 p\u00e9-siang, il n'y a pas d'endroit bon pour aller se pronener, il n'y a rien \u00e0 voir.\n\nAu del\u00e0 du pont de M\u00f4-d\u00f4 on nous montre une tour rectangulaire cr\u00e9nel\u00e9e, aujourd'hui abandonn\u00e9e, mais autrefois citadelle de M\u00f4-d\u00f4.\n\nLaissant derri\u00e8re lui le bourg de M\u00f4-d\u00f4, notre bateau profite d'un vent favorable, cingle d'abord vers l'ouest puis prends un cours d'eau dirig\u00e9 vers le nord : un heure environ apr\u00e8s, il fait halte au village de Cho-ni dia\u00f4 baign\u00e9 par la rivi\u00e8re.\n\nA notre aspect, une foule d'indig\u00e8nes, hommes et femmes, accourent en portant des chaises suspendues \u00e0 deux longs bambous : ils viennent nous demander de leur faire l'honneur de prendre leurs engins pour nous laisser transporter jusqu'au sommet de la haute montagne que nous apercevons non loin de l\u00e0.\n\nCette montagne est le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u7a79\u7abf\u5c71 K'ioung-loung-chan, Montagne C\u00e9leste (tel est le sens des mots K'ioung-loung), renomm\u00e9e par son temple ancien et sa situation pittoresque. Refusant les services de nos villageois (car une excursion p\u00e9destre, encore que plus fatigante, est toujours bien plus int\u00e9ressante), nous suivons une route dall\u00e9e, large de pr\u00e8s de trois m\u00e8tres, d\u00e9cor\u00e9e du nom de Grande route de la Montagne C\u00e9leste, ainsi que nous l'apprend une inscription plac\u00e9e \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 la route commence \u00e0 monter se trouve un grand kiosque debout au milieu du chemin : un toit ordinaire sur quatre colonnes de granit. On y lit: \u76f4\u4e0a\u96f2\u9704 Tche-chang-yun-sia\u00f4, on monte droit aux nuages, i.e. l\u00e0 on commence \u00e0 gravir la montagne.\n\nIci, le chemin est fort pittoresque : de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, les versans de la montagne sont couverts de jolis bois de pins et de sapins qui embaument l'air d'un parfum r\u00e9sineux ; \u00e0 leur ombre, des paysans s'occupent \u00e0 la r\u00e9colte de pommes de pins ; \u00e0 gauche, \u00e0 demi cach\u00e9 sous des bambous entrelac\u00e9s et des mousses chevelues, un ruisseau coule \u00e0 flots press\u00e9s sur le co-\n\n1. \u7a79\u7abf\u5c71\u5927\u8def.\ncher qu'il polit tout en s'\u00e9purant lui-m\u00eame : il semble murmurer contre les obstacles qu'il rencontre sur son chemin et qui retarde sa marche pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9e. Sa vue nous rappelle deux vers du po\u00e8te allemand Haller :\n\nL'\u00e9l\u00e9ment qui vivifie la nature et fertilise les campagnes,\nS'offre de lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'homme et court \u00e0 sa rencontre.\n\n\u00c0 mi-c\u00f4te, on a \u00e9lev\u00e9 un petit reposoir : au dessus de la porte se lit la phrase bouddhique bien connue : \u6709\u6c42\u5fc5\u61c9,\nPriez et l'on vous exaucera ! Dans la niche du centre, une statue, avec tablette : elle repr\u00e9sente le Prince C\u00e9leste \u5218 L\u00e9ou :\nCe g\u00e9nie tient d'une main un marteau et de l'autre un clou \u00e9norme qu'il va enfoncer ; un terrible et hideux serpent s'enroule autour de son cou et touche le sol de sa queue.\n\nDe l\u00e0, le chemin se dirige l\u00e9g\u00e8rement vers la gauche ; \u00e0 droite, en \u00e9tages, sont les d\u00e9bris de plusieurs grands tombeaux :\nce sont les tombes des anciens abb\u00e9s (\u65b9\u4e08 Fang-tchang) du temple de K'ioung-loung. Nous copions sur l'un d'eux l'inscription suivante :\n\n\u7a79\u7abf\u7b2c\u5341\u56db\u4ee3\u65b9\u4e08\u6708\u5c71\u9858\u516c\u795e\u57fa\nTombeau du v\u00e9n\u00e9rable Kou, en religion Yu\u00e9-chan (Montagne de la Lune), sup\u00e9rieur, \u00e0 la quatorzi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, du monast\u00e8re de K'ioung-loung.\n\nNous sommes arriv\u00e9s devant le premier portique de l'enceinte du temple ; il est surmont\u00e9 d'un kiosque rectangulaire rempli de Bouddhas et orn\u00e9 de quatre caract\u00e8res : \u6d1e\u5929\u52dd\u5883, Bel endroit semblable \u00e0 un autre ciel. Ici, le chemin tourne \u00e0 droite et conduit \u00e0 la porte principale du temple ; on y lit : \u7a79\u7abf\u798f\u5730 Terre fortun\u00e9e de K'ioung-loung.\n\nCe grand temple, dont la majeure partie, d\u00e9truite par les rebelles, est encore en ruines, se compose d'une s\u00e9rie de pavillons dispos\u00e9s en \u00e9tages sur le versant de la montagne et reli\u00e9s par des couloirs tortueux, v\u00e9ritables labyrinthes o\u00f9, fort heureusement, les bonzes obligent nos pas.

D'apr\u00e8s les annales de la province cet \u00e9difice fut construit primitivement en l'an 504 de notre \u00e8re. Un bonze c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, Ya\u00f4 Kouang-chia\u00f4, y avait \u00e9tabli sa demeure: cet anachor\u00e8te, un original sans doute, avait un chapeau de bonze, un v\u00eatement de lettr\u00e9 confucien et des souliers de tao\u00efste. Redevenu propri\u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re sous les Ming, ce temple ne fut rendu au culte qu'en 1641. Il fut visit\u00e9 en 1703 par l'illustre empereur K'ang-Hi qui fit cadeau au sup\u00e9rieur de plusieurs pancartes orn\u00e9es chacune de quatre caract\u00e8res tomb\u00e9s de son pinceau de jade. Conserv\u00e9es pieusement en souvenir de cette auguste visite, ces pancartes exist\u00e8rent jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la r\u00e9bellion: \u00e0 ce moment les bonzes furent brutalement chass\u00e9s et traqu\u00e9s dans les montagnes par les Hommes \u00e0 longs cheveux, soi-disant propagateurs du christianisme en Chine, et les pancartes disparurent. Les bonzes les recherch\u00e8rent avec le plus grand soin lorsque la tranquillit\u00e9 fut r\u00e9tablie, mais ne parvinrent pas \u00e0 les retrouver: ils en d\u00e9plorent la perte encore aujourd'hui.\n\nD'apr\u00e8s l'histoire et la tradition, c'est sur l'emplacement m\u00eame o\u00f9 se trouve maintenant le temple de K'ioung-loung que v\u00e9cut, un si\u00e8cle avant J\u00e9sus-Christ, un pauvre b\u00fbcheron nomm\u00e9 Tchou Ma\u00ef-tch'en, qui, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance dans l'\u00e9tude, parvint aux richesses et aux honneurs. On nous permettra de narrer ici l'histoire de ce b\u00fbcheron qui a sa place au Panth\u00e9on chinois.\n\nTchou Mai-tch'en,\nou la pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance dans l'\u00e9tude conduit \u00e0 la richesse et aux honneurs.\u00b9\n\nSous le r\u00e8gne de l'empereur Vou des Han ant\u00e9rieurs\u00b2 (140\n\n\u00b9. Tchou Ma\u00ef-tch'en est un personnage historique. Sa biographie se trouve dans le Ts'ien Han-chou, annales des Han ant\u00e9rieurs, Livre LXIV, 1re partie, et renferme en substance les faits que l'auteur du r\u00e9cit que nous traduisons ici a mis en \u0153uvre.\n\n\u00b2. \u6f22\u6b66\u5e1d 'Han Vou-ti.\n\u00e0 86 avant J.C.), vivait dans le d\u00e9partement de Kouei-tsi\u00b9 un individu nomm\u00e9 Tchou Ma\u00ef-tch'en, et surnomm\u00e9 Oueng-tseu.\u00b2 Il \u00e9tait pauvre et n'avait pas encore pu faire son chemin dans le monde; il habitait avec sa femme une mis\u00e9rable chaumi\u00e8re b\u00e2tie sur le flanc de la montagne K'ioung-loung, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve aujourd'hui le temple de ce nom. Chaque jour, il allait couper du bois dans la montagne et portait ses fagots au march\u00e9 de la ville pour les vendre: c'est ainsi qu'il subvenait p\u00e9niblement aux d\u00e9penses du m\u00e9nage. Il aimait d'instinct l'\u00e9tude et avait toujours un livre \u00e0 la main; encore qu'il port\u00e2t des fagots sur l'\u00e9paule, il lisait \u00e0 haute voix ou r\u00e9citait des vers tout en marchant. Les gens du march\u00e9 y \u00e9taient accoutum\u00e9s; aussi, d\u00e8s qu'ils entendaient la voix de quelqu'un qui chantait, ils savaient que Tchou arrivait avec sa charge de bois.\n\nComme Tchou \u00e9tait un lettr\u00e9, tout le monde avait piti\u00e9 de lui et lui achetait des fagots, et que, de plus, il ne discutait pas sur le prix et qu'il acceptait la somme qu'on lui offrait, il vendait sa marchandise plus facilement que les autres. Cependant un certain nombre de jeunes gens le m\u00e9prisaient, et souvent les gamins, qui le voyaient lire, tout pli\u00e9 qu'il fut sous son fardeau, s'attroupaient autour de lui et le tournaient en ridicule. Mais Tchou ne s'en souciait en aucune mani\u00e8re.\n\nUn jour, la femme de Tchou Ma\u00ef-tch'en, \u00e9tant sortie pour aller puiser de l'eau, vit son mari entour\u00e9 et suivi d'une foule qui battait des mains en se moquant de lui: elle en rougit et en fut toute honteuse; aussi quand son mari revint de la ville apr\u00e8s avoir vendu ses fagots, elle lui dit:\n\n\u2014Si tu veux \u00e9tudier, ne vends pas de bois, ou si tu veux vendre du bois, n'\u00e9tudies pas. Es-tu donc fou et idiot pour te conduire ainsi \u00e0 ton \u00e2ge? N'est-ce pas honteux d'\u00eatre ainsi la ris\u00e9e des jeunes gens!\n\n\u2014Je vends du bois pour vivre, r\u00e9pliqua Tchou Ma\u00ef-tch'en; j'\u00e9tudie pour arriver \u00e0 la fortune et aux honneurs: l'un n'em-\n\n\u00b9. \u90ed \u7a3d Kouei-tsi, d\u00e9partement actuel de Sou-tch\u00e9ou.\n\u00b2. \u7fc1 \u5b50.\np\u00eache pas l'autre; que l'on se moque de moi si l'on veut, cela n'est indiff\u00e9rent.\n\n\u2014Si tu veux parvenir \u00e0 la fortune et aux honneurs, reprit la femme, ne vend pas de fagots: a-t-on jamais vu un b\u00fbcheron arriver \u00e0 exercer une charge publique? Ne dis donc pas des choses qui n'ont pas le sens commun!\n\n\u2014La richesse et la pauvret\u00e9 ont chacune leur temps, r\u00e9pliqua Tchou. Un devin qui a tir\u00e9 mon horoscope m'a pr\u00e9dit qu'\u00e0 cinquante ans je serais quelque chose: d'ailleurs on dit constamment que l'on ne peut mesurer l'eau de la mer avec un bateau.\u00b9 Ainsi ne vous occupez pas de moi.\n\n\u2014Ce devin, interrompit la femme, a vu que tu \u00e9tais stupide et a voulu te tromper: ne crois pas qu'\u00e0 cinquante ans tu ne porteras plus de bois sur le dos; tu seras certainement mort de faim avant cette \u00e9poque.

Toi, tu lis des livres inutiles ; tu auras beau \u00e9tudier pendant cent ans, cela ne te servira de rien.

Il eut occasion d'adresser une lettre \u00e0 l'empereur, mais cette lettre resta longtemps sans r\u00e9ponse.

Apr\u00e8s diverses vicissitudes de fortune (Tchou tomba un moment en disgr\u00e2ce), l'empereur, sachant qu'il \u00e9tait originaire de Kouei-tsi, pensa qu'il devait \u00eatre habitu\u00e9 au climat de cette localit\u00e9, et qu'il \u00e9tait au courant des bons et mauvais sentiments de la population; il le nomma \u592a\u5b88 t'ai-ch\u00e9ou ou pr\u00e9fet de Kouei-tsi.

Tous les officiers et fonctionnaires assistaient alors \u00e0 un grand festin: Tchou, sans \u00eatre remarqu\u00e9, entra dans la salle o\u00f9 il avait lieu. Mais son ancien bienfaiteur, l'ayant reconnu, lui d\u00e9signa une place parmi les assistants: Tchou, apr\u00e8s avoir bien bu et bien mang\u00e9, laissa voir un peu le cordon appendu au sceau. \u00c0 cette vue, son ami fut \u00e9tonn\u00e9, et, tirant le cordon, amena le sceau lui-m\u00eame. C'\u00e9tait le sceau de pr\u00e9fet de Kouei-tsi. L'officier, surpris, fut le dire aux autres convives qui, pris de vin, s'\u00e9cri\u00e8rent: \"c'est une fausset\u00e9, cela ne peut \u00eatre!\u2014Venez voir vous-m\u00eames, r\u00e9pondit celui-ci. Un de ceux qui avaient m\u00e9pris\u00e9 jadis Tchou alla voir et revint en criant: \"c'est vrai! c'est vrai!\" alors tous rest\u00e8rent un instant immobile d'\u00e9tonnement; puis, revenus \u00e0 eux-m\u00eames, ils all\u00e8rent chacun selon son rang, saluer Tchou et le f\u00e9liciter.\n\nPeu apr\u00e8s, le chef des haras de Tch'ang-an, conduisant un char attel\u00e9 de quatre chevaux, vint prendre le nouveau pr\u00e9fet. Tchou monta dans le char et se dirigea vers la ville.\n\nLe sous-pr\u00e9fet de Kouei-tsi, averti de la venue prochaine de son chef, s'\u00e9tait h\u00e2t\u00e9 d'envoyer un grand nombre d'habitans r\u00e9parer la route par o\u00f9 il devait venir.

Celui-ci, alors assis dans un char magnifique, le reconnut aussi : il s\u2019arr\u00eata, envoya un de ses officiers la chercher, fit venir un char de sa suite et invita les deux \u00e9poux \u00e0 y monter. Une fois \u00e0 la pr\u00e9fecture, la femme, toute honteuse, ne savait quelle contenance tenir : elle se prosterna aux pieds de Tchou en reconnaissant qu\u2019elle avait eu tort. Tchou lui dit de prier son mari de venir pour qu\u2019il le vit. Ce dernier accourut et se prosterna sans oser lever les yeux sur le pr\u00e9fet.\n\n\u2014 Eh bien ! dit en riant Tchou \u00e0 sa femme, il me semble que ce mari n\u2019est pas plus riche que Tchou Ma\u00ef-tch\u2019en !\n\nLa femme, repentante, fit trois salutations et pria Tchou de la prendre pour servante : elle jurait de le servir jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la mort. Mais Tchou ordonna d\u2019apporter un sceau plein d\u2019eau ; il en versa le contenu \u00e0 terre et dit \u00e0 sa femme :\n\n\u2014 Tu ne peux pas plus revenir avec moi que l\u2019on ne peut ramasser cette eau r\u00e9pandue ; mais, comme je me souviens de notre ancienne affection, je te donne un terrain derri\u00e8re mon jardin : tu pourras le planter et y vivre.\n\nLa femme suivit son second mari : tous les passants la montraient du doigt en s\u2019\u00e9criant :\n\n\u2014 Voici l\u2019ancienne femme du nouveau pr\u00e9fet !\n\nElle en \u00e9tait toute confuse et toute honteuse : arriv\u00e9e au jardin, elle se jeta \u00e0 l\u2019eau et p\u00e9rit.\n\nLa morale de cette histoire peut se r\u00e9sumer dans les quatre vers suivants :\n\n\u679d\u5728\u5899\u4e1c\u82b1\u5728\u897f\n\u81ea\u5f9e\u843d\u5730\u4efb\u98a8\u5439\n\u679d\u7121\u82b1\u6642\u9084\u518d\u767c\n\u82b1\u82e5\u96e2\u679d\u96e3\u4e0a\u679d\n\n1.

Les Annales des Han (Livre LXIV, Biographie de Tchou Ma\u00ef-tch\u2019en) rapportent ainsi la fin de notre h\u00e9ros : \u201cUn an apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Kouei-tsi,\nLes branches sont \u00e0 l'est du mur et les fleurs sont \u00e0 l'ouest :\nD\u00e8s que les fleurs sont tomb\u00e9es \u00e0 terre, le vent les emporte \u00e0 sa guise.\nSi les branches n'ont pas de fleurs, elles pourront en produire plus tard ;\nMais si les fleurs quittent la branche, on ne peut les y replacer.\n\nCela veut dire que la femme doit suivre son mari comme la fleur accompagne la branche : si la branche n'a pas de fleurs, au printemps prochain elle en produira de nouvelles ; mais si la fleur quitte la branche, on ne peut l'y r\u00e9unir \u00e0 nouveau.\n\nEn ce monde, la femme doit servir son mari, n'en avoir jamais qu'un seul, et partager ses peines comme ses plaisirs : gardez-vous donc bien, \u00f4 femmes, d'avoir l'esprit incertain, de ne songer qu'aux riches, et de m\u00e9priser les pauvres, car plus tard vous vous en repentirez !\n\nEn sortant du temple nous gravissons le sommet du K'ioung-loung-chan ; il y avait l\u00e0, jadis, un \u00e9l\u00e9gant kiosque d'o\u00f9 l'on pouvait admirer le Grand Lac, les vall\u00e9es et campagnes voisines, et, inspir\u00e9 par l'aspect de la nature, faire des vers en d\u00e9gustant une tasse de th\u00e9. Les rebelles, v\u00e9ritables vandales, l'ont pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 dans la vall\u00e9e et il n'en reste plus aujourd'hui que les fondemens de pierre sur lesquels il reposait.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 l'empereur le nomma g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et lui donna le commandement de l'arm\u00e9e dirig\u00e9e contre Toung-yu\u00e9 : Tchou se distingua dans cette guerre et fut r\u00e9compens\u00e9 par de nouveaux titres et de nouvelles fonctions. Plus tard, tomb\u00e9 derechef en disgr\u00e2ce, d\u00e9grad\u00e9, puis revenu en faveur, il eut \u00e0 soutenir une lutte d'intrigues contre un censeur puissant : il voulait le faire assassiner, quand un complot dans lequel celui-ci \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9 fut d\u00e9couvert ; le censeur n'entra\u00eena personne \u00e0 faire que de se donner volontairement la mort. Incontinent apr\u00e8s, par un de ces retours de fortune dont l'histoire chinoise ne fournit que trop d'exemples, Tchou Ma\u00ef-teh'en fut mis \u00e0 mort sur l'ordre de l'empereur.\"\n\n1. \u00c0 quelque distance \u00e0 l'est du K'ioung-loung-chan, se trouve le \u5ca9\u5c71 Ling-yen-chan, Montagne de la Terrasse Divine, appel\u00e9e aussi \u786f\u77f3\u5c71 Yen-che-chan, Montagne de pierres \u00e0 broyer l'encre : elle produit en effet des pierres avec lesquelles on peut faire des enciers. Il y avait jadis au sommet de cette montagne un magnifique palais, le Kowan-oula-koung, b\u00e2ti par le roi de Vou, \u592b\u5dee Fou Tch'\u00e2, fils de H\u00f4-Lu, pour la belle \u897f\u65bd Si Che, la V\u00e9nus chinoise (voir \u00e0 ce sujet, Mayers, Chinese Reader's\nD\u00e9l\u00e0 nous prenons un sentier \u00e9troit et rocailleux couch\u00e9 comme un serpent le long de la cha\u00eene des hauteurs; ce chemin n'est pas sans danger, car il est en quelque sorte suspendu au-dessus d'un ab\u00eeme et le moindre faux pas peut pr\u00e9cipiter le passant, d'une hauteur prodigieuse, dans une profonde vall\u00e9e o\u00f9 les hommes n'ont plus que la taille d'une grosse mouche. Au fond de la vall\u00e9e, \u00e0 gauche, appara\u00eet un temple pittoresquement entour\u00e9 d'un bouquet d'arbres: vu \u00e0 cette distance, il semble tout petit, mais il doit en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00eatre assez consid\u00e9rable. Au dire de notre guide, il para\u00eetrait que l'on trouve dans les environs des chevreuils et des sangliers. Avis aux chasseurs. Apr\u00e8s mille fatigues et non sans p\u00e9ril, nous atteignons le plus haut pic de cette cha\u00eene rocailleuse et nue: c'est le T\u00e2-m\u00e2-fou, au nord-ouest du K'iong-loung-chan. Il y a l\u00e0 encore les ruines d'une maison de briques. On jouit de ce sommet d'une vue splendide sur le grand lac, ses \u00eeles, ses bateaux \u00e0 voiles jaun\u00e2tres. Cet aspect nous remet en m\u00e9moire deux vers d'un po\u00e8te de l'\u00e9poque des T'ang:\n\n\u9060\u6c34\u7121\u908a\u5929\u4f5c\u5cb8\n\u4e82\u5e06\u4e00\u6563\u5f71\u5982\u9d09\n\nL'eau qui s'\u00e9tend au loin n'a pas d'autre rivage que le ciel (l'horizon); les voiles qui sont dispers\u00e9es \u00e7a et l\u00e0 ressemblent \u00e0 des canards \u00e9parpill\u00e9s.\n\nAu nord du lac on aper\u00e7oit un amas de tuiles grises; c'est une ville dont la pagode est \u00e0 peine visible dans le lointain. Derri\u00e8re le T\u00e2-m\u00e2-fou sont de hautes collines, parmi lesquelles on nous cite le Yang-chan; plus loin, le T'ien-p'ing-chan qui ne semble plus \u00eatre la montagne la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\n\nManual, pp. 39,42,87 et 177). On pouvait de l\u00e0 admirer \u00e0 son aise l'\u00e9tendue du T'ai-shou et ses deux K'iong-t'ing-chan: il y avait l\u00e0 un puits appel\u00e9 le puits du roi de Vou. Dans la suite on \u00e9l\u00e8ve sur le m\u00eame emplacement un temple et une pagode: ce fut le Ling-yen-sseu, Temple de la Terrasse Divine. On y conservait une pierre o\u00f9 l'on pouvait ais\u00e9ment distinguer les traces d'un pied d'homme et d'un pied de femme: c'\u00e9taient, disait-on, les pas du roi de Vou et de la belle Si Che, (Sou-tch'ou-fou-tche). Durant leurs voyages dans le sud de la Chine, les deux illustres empereurs K'ang-Hi et K'ien-loung vinrent \u00e9tablir leur palais de voyage ou r\u00e9sidence temporaire (\u884c\u5bae) au sommet du Ling-yen-chan.\nNous descendons la montagne par un sentier glissant, et regagnons notre bateau \u00e0 travers champs; \u00e0 peine \u00e0 bord, le l\u00f4 la largne les amarres et nous fait reprendre notre course. Notre canal se dirige d'abord vers le sud-ouest, traverse M\u00f4-d\u00f4 (\u00e0 deux heures de K'ioung-loung-chan), tombe \u00e0 gauche dans un cours d'eau qui lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9bouche \u00e0 son tour \u00e0 droite dans une rivi\u00e8re assez large. Cette derni\u00e8re va vers l'ouest et aboutit au grand lac.\n\nLe temps, couvert depuis le matin, s'assombrit encore davantage, et le vent augmente de violence; notre l\u00f4d\u00e2 interroge anxieusement l'horizon et ne semble pas rassur\u00e9. \u00c0 ce moment, notre bateau, toutes voiles d\u00e9hors, file sur la rivi\u00e8re avec une rapidit\u00e9 vertigineuse. C'est l\u00e0 que nous avons la facult\u00e9 d'appr\u00e9cier l'habilet\u00e9 et le coup d'\u0153il de nos marins; lanc\u00e9s ainsi \u00e0 toute vitesse sur les ailes du vent, nous arrivons droit sur un pont peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. \u00c0 un m\u00e8tre de distance environ et juste au moment o\u00f9 l'on peut croire que le tablier du pont va briser notre m\u00e2t, nos hommes larguent la voile et abaissent le m\u00e2t en un clin d'\u0153il. Le bateau glisse rapidement sous le pont et, de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, en moins qu'il ne faut pour l'\u00e9crire, le m\u00e2t est redress\u00e9, la voile hiss\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau, et nous continuons notre course sans nous \u00eatre arr\u00eat\u00e9 un seul instant....Bient\u00f4t la rivi\u00e8re s'\u00e9largit et ses deux rives se terminent par deux langues de terre couvertes de roseaux: ses eaux se confondent l\u00e0 avec celles du Grand Lac.\n\nLe Ta\u00ef-hou ou Grand Lac a, disent les g\u00e9ographies chinoises, 200 li de l'est \u00e0 l'ouest et 120 du nord au sud; il a 500 li de circonf\u00e9rence, et renferme en tout 72 \u00eeles, grandes et petites. Les trois d\u00e9partemens de Sou-tch\u00e9ou, Hou-tch\u00e9ou et Tch'ang-tch\u00e9ou l'entourent de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Il para\u00eetrait qu'autrefois, au dire des annales de la contr\u00e9e, il y avait l\u00e0 o\u00f9 existe aujourd'hui le Ta\u00ef-hou, cinq lacs distincts qui plus tard se r\u00e9unirent en un seul: de l\u00e0 viendrait le nom de \u4e94\u6e56 ou-hou, les cinq lacs, que l'on donne quelquefois au Ta\u00ef-hou. Selon d'autres, \u4e94\u6e56 ou-hou serait une abr\u00e9viation de l'expression \u4e94\u767e\u91cc\u4e4b\u6e56\nou pa\u00ef li tche 'hou, lac de 500 li, par laquelle on d\u00e9signait ce grand lac.\u00b9\n\nLa plus grande \u00eele de ce lac est le \u897f\u6d1e\u5ead\u5c71 Si Toung-t'ing chan, l'\u00eele occidentale de Toung-t'ing. Elle renferme une grotte jadis visit\u00e9e et d\u00e9crite par M. Medhurst: apr\u00e8s elle vient, comme grandeur, le \u6771\u6d1e\u5ead\u5c71 Toung t'oung-t'ing chan, l'\u00eele orientale de Toung-t'ing.\n\nLorsqu'il vente assez fort, les eaux du grand lac ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas cl\u00e9mentes, et comme les vagues en sont semblables \u00e0 celle de la pleine mer, ce n'est pas sans appr\u00e9hension que les chinois s'y aventurent par un mauvais temps avec leurs bateaux \u00e0 fond plat. Notre locataire aurait bien voulu que nous fissions halte dans l'une des anses de la baie pour attendre une accalmie; malheureusement nos jours sont compt\u00e9s, il nous faut \u00eatre de retour \u00e0 Changha\u00ef \u00e0 une \u00e9poque d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Nous le for\u00e7ons \u00e0 braver les ondes courrouc\u00e9es et \u00e0 naviguer vers le Toung t'oung-t'ing chan. Tant que notre bateau cingle le long du bord, tout va bien; les vagues n'y sont pas fortes et nous filons rapidement. Mais nous avons un instant de crainte. \u00c0 un moment certain nous donnons si violemment plusieurs coups de talon que nous pensons avoir touch\u00e9 un roc. Encore que l'eau ne soit pas profonde \u00e0 cet endroit, il ne nous aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9able de prendre un bain dans les eaux jaun\u00e2tres du Ta\u00ef-hou. Notre \u00e9quipage en alarme se h\u00e2te d'examiner le fond du bateau de peur qu'une voix d'eau ne s'y soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e; heureusement qu'il n'en est rien. Notre batelier nous assure que nous avons sans doute talonn\u00e9 la carcasse de quelque jonque naufrag\u00e9e.\n\nUne fois en plein lac, les vagues sont plus mena\u00e7antes et viennent heurter avec fracas les parois du bateau; le mat craque en fl\u00e9chissant sous le vent; des objets mal amarr\u00e9s courent l'un apr\u00e8s l'autre d'un bord \u00e0 l'autre et semblent se chasser mutuellement. Notre esquif penche de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et effleure de sa voile l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 des vagues. C'est une vraie\n\n\u00b9. Sou-tch\u00e9ou-fou-tche.\ntemp\u00eate, non pas dans un verre d'eau, mais dans un des plus grands lacs de la Chine. Nous ne sommes pas sans inqui\u00e9tude, car la moindre fausse manoeuvre peut faire chavirer notre barque \u00e0 fond plat; mais l'\u00e9quipage est adroit, et le l\u00f3da, qui tient le gouvernail \u00e0 deux mains, manoeuvre \u00e0 la lame avec adresse.\n\nNous avan\u00e7ons, n\u00e9anmoins, peu \u00e0 peu vers l'\u00eele orientale de Toung-t'ing, et, au fur et \u00e0 mesure que nous approchons, nous distinguons ses pics \u00e9lev\u00e9s, ses montagnes profondes et ses villages \u00e9pars. Nous avons le cap sur une anse de l'\u00eele pr\u00e8s de laquelle se trouve un grand village: une fois \u00e0 l'abri de l'\u00eele, les vagues deviennent moins soulev\u00e9es et le vent est plus maniable. De ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve une petite for\u00eat de pieux de bambous dispos\u00e9s pour la p\u00eache par les habitants de l'\u00eele; \u00e0 travers, circulent des troupes de canards sauvages qui se laissent bercer par les vagues et voyagent de conserve. Nous passons ensuite une digue de rochers, destin\u00e9e \u00e0 briser les lames et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les navires qui se r\u00e9fugient dans cette anse contre la furie des eaux du lac, et apr\u00e8s une travers\u00e9e p\u00e9rilleuse agr\u00e9ment\u00e9e de mal de mer (si toutefois l'on peut s'exprimer ainsi) nous pouvons enfin jeter l'ancre dans une baie tranquille et calme. Avant le diner, nous parcourons le village et les alentours, et, malgr\u00e9 le vent qui souffle encore avec force, quelques canards tombent sous nos coups de fusil: la montagne, nous dit-on, regorge de chevreuils. Mais, le jour baisse, nous devons remettre au lendemain le soin de v\u00e9rifier l'exactitude de cette assertion.\n\nL'\u00eele orientale de Toung-t'ing est un peu plus petite que sa voisine de l'ouest: elle a 80 li de tour, mais elle a presque le m\u00eame aspect que le Si-toung-t'ing-chan dont elle est \u00e9loign\u00e9e de 18 li. On lui donne quelquefois le nom de \u83ab\u91d0\u5c71 M\u00f2-li chan, Montagne de M\u00f2-li, parceque, rapporte l'histoire, un g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de ce nom, qui v\u00e9cut sous la dynastie des Souei, y habitait. De l\u00e0 vient aussi le nom du pic le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de l'\u00eele, le \u83ab\u91d0\u5cf0 M\u00f2-li foun, Pic de M\u00f2-li.\nA l'est de ce pic s'\u00e9tend, du nord au sud, une cha\u00eene de collines dont les principaux sommets portent les noms de \u8299\u5bb9\u5cf0 Fou-joung-foung pic du Fou-joung (*Hibiscus mutabilis*), de \u7fe0\u5cf0 Ts'ouei-foung, pic vert, etc. Sur ce dernier, para\u00eet-il, existe une source appel\u00e9e \u767d\u9f8d\u6cc9 pa\u00ef-loung-tsuan, Source du Dragon Blanc. Au sud, on distingue le \u9f0e\u725b\u5cf0 Si-ni\u00e9ou foung, pic du Rhinoc\u00e9ros.\n\nD'apr\u00e8s la tradition, il y aurait sous le Pa\u00f4-chan, une des montagnes de cette cha\u00eene, l'entr\u00e9e d'un immense souterrain qui s'\u00e9tendrait jusque sous le lac m\u00eame : on lui a donn\u00e9 le nom de \u5730\u8109 ti-m\u00f4, raie (*litt.* pouls) de la terre. Le roi H\u00f4-lu y envoya jadis un certain Ma\u00f4 Tchang, surnomm\u00e9 \u9f8d\u5a01 Loung-ou\u00ef, la majest\u00e9 du Dragon, qui, la chandelle \u00e0 la main, marcha pendant dix jours et dix nuits dans ce souterrain sans en trouver la fin. Quand cet explorateur revint, il dit au roi : \"A l'entr\u00e9e, le souterrain \u00e9tait tellement \u00e9troit que je fus oblig\u00e9 de ramper : au bout de quelques li, j'arrivai dans une chambre de pierre haute de deux tchang, o\u00f9 l'eau suintait de toutes parts : il y avait l\u00e0 un lit de pierre et une petite table sur laquelle \u00e9taient trois volumes : je les ai rapport\u00e9s.\" Il pr\u00e9senta ces ouvrages au roi qui ne sut pas ce que c'\u00e9tait : H\u00f4-lu pria Confucius de venir les examiner. Ce grand philosophe dit : \"c'est le livre de l'Empereur Yu des Hia : il renferme tout ce qui a rapport aux G\u00e9nies et \u00e0 la Grande Doctrine.\"\n\nH\u00f4-lu ordonna \u00e0 Ma\u00f4 de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer de nouveau dans le souterrain ; Ma\u00f4 revint apr\u00e8s vingt jours d'absence : \"le chemin que j'ai suivi, dit-il, n'\u00e9tait pas le m\u00eame que celui que j'avais pris la premi\u00e8re fois. Au dessus de ma t\u00eate j'entendais le bruit des vagues ; des insectes extraordinaires venaient en grand nombre nous entourer et voler autour des lumi\u00e8res ; des hirondelles et des chauve-souris voltigeaient alentour. Il nous fut impossible d'aller plus loin.\" En souvenir de ce hardi explorateur on avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 un endroit le nom de\" Demeure du V\u00e9n\u00e9rable Ma\u00f4.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9. Sou-tch\u00e9ou-fou-tche ; Kiang-nan-t'oung-tche.\nLe lendemain matin, \u00e0 l'aube, nous quittons notre bateau le fusil sur l'\u00e9paule et nous gravissons la montagne. Les flancs en sont couverts d'arbustes peu \u00e9lev\u00e9s et de broussailles : les chevreuils s'y cachent et s'y dissimulent. Une battue est organis\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce au concours d'indig\u00e8nes soudoy\u00e9s par notre l\u00f3ld\u00e1 et, en peu d'heures, plusieurs chevreuils tombent sous nos coups.\n\nLes habitans de l'\u00eele ne nous voient pas d'un bon \u0153il nous livrer \u00e0 ces exercices cyn\u00e9g\u00e9tiques ; en effet, eux aussi chassent le chevreuil mais d'une fa\u00e7on fort primitive. Arm\u00e9s d'une longue latte de bambou et d'un couteau, et suivis d'un chien, ils tentent de surprendre l'animal au g\u00eete, de l'assommer ou de lui ouvrir la gorge. Aussi faut-il recourir \u00e0 un argument ad hominem tr\u00e8s en honneur en Chine et qui a toujours grand succ\u00e8s aupr\u00e8s des indig\u00e8nes de ce pays, la piastre, pour les d\u00e9cider \u00e0 nous servir de rabatteurs.\n\nTout en chassant, nous sommes arriv\u00e9s au sommet de la montagne ; \u00e0 nos pieds les versans forment une sorte de vall\u00e9e en entonnoir, vall\u00e9e profonde toute parsem\u00e9e de tombeaux et de monuments fun\u00e9raires. Les parois en sont tapiss\u00e9es, aussi bien que le fonds, de tombes \u00e9tag\u00e9es. Les unes, dont les habitans sont sans nul doute des gens de la classe ordinaire, consistent en une simple dalle et un \u7891 pet ou colonne o\u00f9 sont grav\u00e9s les noms et pr\u00e9noms du d\u00e9funt et le nom de la dynastie sous laquelle il a v\u00e9cu ; les autres, appartenant \u00e0 des gens d'une classe sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 des fonctionnaires ais\u00e9s, se composent d'une sorte d'autel o\u00f9 se lisent les noms et titres du d\u00e9funt, et d'une ou plusieurs basses enceintes circulaires ; quelques unes de ces derni\u00e8res sont \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9tages. Presque toutes sont en ruines : la main impitoyable du temps a pass\u00e9 par l\u00e0. Le sol est jonch\u00e9 de d\u00e9bris de colonnes comm\u00e9moratives, de balustrades renvers\u00e9es, de murs d\u00e9molis. L'\u00e9tat dans lequel sont ces tombes est la preuve m\u00eame de leur antiquit\u00e9 ; les familles auxquelles elles ont appartenu n'ont plus aujourd'hui...\nhui de repr\u00e9sentans et personne ne vient plus accomplir les sacrifices usuels ni entretenir ces derni\u00e8res demeures.\n\n\u00c0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la vall\u00e9e, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle se r\u00e9tr\u00e9cit et est domin\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement par la c\u00f4te \u00e0 pic de la montagne, existe un petit temple ombrag\u00e9 par quelques arbres. Dans la grande salle du milieu sont deux ou trois statues bouddhiques min\u00e9es par le temps. Nous y faisons la rencontre d'un vieux gardien qui, sans \u00eatre effray\u00e9 le moins du monde par notre attirail guerrier, nous offre, selon les rites, la pipe \u00e0 eau, le tabac et la tasse de th\u00e9 classiques. Remarquons \u00e0 ce propos que les europ\u00e9ens, surtout quand ils peuvent s'exprimer en chinois, sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement bien re\u00e7us par les paysans et gens de la campagne certainement moins hostiles aux \u00e9trangers que l'habitant des villes. Le vrai chinois des champs, tout ignare et hirsute qu'il soit, n'en est pas moins plus poli et de commerce plus facile que les citadins soi-disant civilis\u00e9s. Notons aussi que parmi ces derniers, ce sont ceux qui ont eu des rapports constants avec des europ\u00e9ens, ou qui ont v\u00e9cu avec eux, qui sont les plus insolents et les plus canailles.\n\nEn parcourant les coteaux, nous nous trouvons tout d'un coup, au d\u00e9tour d'un chemin, en face d'un enfant de neuf \u00e0 dix ans qui, \u00e0 notre vue, se met \u00e0 pousser des cris \u00e0 pleurer \u00e0 chaudes larmes et \u00e0 trembler comme une feuille. Il voit sans doute des europ\u00e9ens pour la premi\u00e8re fois et les armes dont nous sommes munis ne sont pas faites pour le rassurer; peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame nous prend-il pour le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre M\u00e2-t\u00e2-fou, le croque-mitaine chinois. Nous tentons de le calmer \u00e0 l'aide de quelques saupiquets, mais tout est inutile; un passant qui l'a pris dans ses bras nous fait signe de nous \u00e9loigner.\n\nNous gravissons le M\u00f4-li foung; au sommet existe un petit temple orn\u00e9 de quelques statuettes dor\u00e9es; les paysans des environs y viennent faire br\u00fbler des b\u00e2tonnets d'encens et accomplir les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies exig\u00e9es par l'inexorable rite. Une jeune fille de vingt \u00e0 vingt-cinq ans (on ne peut jamais dire exactement l'\u00e2ge des femmes chinoises) est la seule gardienne\ndu temple. Elle est aussi fort effray\u00e9e de notre apparition et c'est \u00e0 peine si les *fe nia g\u00f4*, ne craignez rien! de notre *l\u00f4d\u00e2* parviennent \u00e0 la rassurer un peu.\n\nDu haut de ce pic on jouit d'une belle vue sur le lac, les \u00eelots et les rivages lointains o\u00f9 se dressent les montagnes que nous avons visit\u00e9es ces jours derniers. Derri\u00e8re nous s'aper\u00e7oit l'\u00eele enti\u00e8re avec ses villages \u00e9paris, ses anses, ses collines couvertes de pins et de d\u00e9bris de tombeaux. Sur le chemin qui se d\u00e9roule le long des hauteurs, de bonnes paysannes et des petits gar\u00e7ons joufflus, tout endimanch\u00e9s, et charg\u00e9s de paquets de lingots de papier argent\u00e9, se rendent au temple pour y faire une c\u00e9r\u00e9monie en m\u00e9moire de parens d\u00e9funt.\n\nL'\u00eele de Toung-Toung-t'ing est notre derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape et marque la fin de notre voyage; il nous faut au plus vite rentrer \u00e0 Changha\u00ef et nous replonger dans le tourbillon des affaires. Apr\u00e8s une nuit pass\u00e9e dans l'\u00eele, nous sortons de l'anse le lendemain matin au jour, hissons la voile et traversons \u00e0 nouveau le grand lac. Seulement, cette fois les ondes en sont apais\u00e9es et le vent souffle l\u00e9g\u00e8rement. Nous reprenons le m\u00eame canal, passons M\u00f4-d\u00f4, puis, \u00e0 une heure et demie de l\u00e0, le village de Ouang-doung o\u00f9 l'on peut voir un joli pont de trois arches surmont\u00e9 d'un \u00e9l\u00e9gant kiosque rectangulaire. Apr\u00e8s deux heures de navigation \u00e0 la cordelle (le vent ne nous \u00e9tant pas favorable), nous atteignons le faubourg de Si-meun, porte de l'ouest de Sou-tch\u00e9ou. Le soir, nous couchons sous les murs de K'oun-chan, ayant fait halte en route pour tirer quelques faisans le long des canaux. Le lendemain nous descendons tout le Vou-soung-kiang et, pouss\u00e9s par un vent favorable, arrivons \u00e0 Changha\u00ef \u00e0 la tomb\u00e9e de la nuit.\nARTICLE V.\n\nSOME NOTES OF A TRIP TO COREA, IN JULY AND AUGUST, 1883.\n\nBY\n\nG. JAMES MORRISON, Esq.\n\nIn placing the following paper before the Society I hope it will be understood that it is only intended to be of a superficial character. In first visiting a strange country one sees many new things, but one is sure to make egregious mistakes if he generalizes too quickly and on insufficient bases, and I would rather have the paper characterized as incomplete than as incorrect.\n\nI left Shanghai on the morning of Sunday the 8th July, and after a rather stormy passage the Ferrier Islands were sighted on the morning of Tuesday the 10th.\n\nThese islands are at what may be called the entrance to the harbor of Jenchuan, inasmuch as after passing them the course lies among islands all the way up to the anchorage. Passing the Ferriers at about 10 o'clock, we arrived at Roze Island at about 5 p.m. The official name of the port is Jenchuan which is the name of the nearest place of any importance, but the spot where the Custom House has been temporarily located and where it is purposed to make the foreign settlements, is called Chi-mul-poo and the port is usually spoken of by that name. In front of Chi-mul-poo there is an island called by the French Roze Island, immediately to the west of which there is good anchorage for a large number of vessels. The scenery between the Ferriers and Roze Island is very pleasing when the water is high, but at low tide the vast extent of mud flats detract much from the beauty of the landscape. There is a rise and fall of about 28 feet at spring tides at Chi-mul-poo, and at low water there is a foreshore of mud\nabout two-thirds of a mile in width. In some of the bays in the neighbourhood the extent of foreshore is very much greater. The Custom House has been placed close to a small bluff which projects some distance into the bay, and here it has been possible to construct a small jetty of reasonable length reaching down to low water. At present the vessels lie about half a mile to a mile south-west of Roze Island, and against the tide it sometimes takes an hour for a boat to reach one from Chi-mul-poo. The charge for a boat to a steamer and back is from $1 upwards, but as trade increases this charge will no doubt be much diminished.\n\nOn a bright day and at high tide the view of the islands from Chi-mul-poo is very picturesque; the view of the mainland from the sea is not so pleasing,\u2014still it compares very favorably with Chefoo or any of the places which residents in Shanghai have opportunities of visiting during a short holiday, and there is every reason to hope that some day a very delightful watering place may exist on some point on the south-west coast of Corea.\n\nChi-mul-poo can hardly as yet be called a model settlement, but it may possibly have a great future in store.\n\nImmediately to the south of the knoll or bluff above-mentioned lies the Japanese settlement. Here the Japanese have built a considerable number of wooden shanties, and offer for sale a most heterogeneous mass of commodities. They seem to have settled down determined to cast in their lot with the place, and it may only be a few years before some of these men who are at present owners of a shanty and a few dollars' worth of stores will be wealthy storekeepers. The great difficulty to be encountered is the absence of the trading class, who could exchange commodities with the foreign importer. I feel quite certain, however, that the difficulty does not arise from the inability of the country to furnish exports, but from the absence of a class which hitherto has not been required, and which the usual law of supply and demand will soon call into existence.\nAmong the Japanese storekeepers there are I believe now one or two Europeans, but there were none when I was at Chi-mul-poo.\n\nImmediately to the south of the Japanese settlement lies the foreign settlement\u2014for foreigners other than Japanese. I cannot say that I think the choice of a site has been a happy one. The ground is low and must be raised with disintegrated granite, a process which is generally considered very unhealthy; but putting aside this, which after all is but a temporary difficulty which will disappear after the settlement is all raised, nothing can ever improve the two-thirds of a mile of mud foreshore at low water. Even if after 30 or 40 years the place became rich enough to reclaim all this, it is very doubtful if the result would not be to throw out another mud flat in front.\n\nThere were no houses on this settlement when I was there, and it is to be hoped that the question of the location of the settlement may be reconsidered. The anchorage is undoubtedly very good, and if the settlement must be in that neighbourhood, either Roze Island or the land immediately to the north of the Custom House knoll would be preferable to the present place. As all the goods would be taken into the country in boats by the Seoul river, there is very little objection to the settlement being on an island, particularly when the distance to the mainland is only a few hundred yards.\n\nThe European portion of the population is almost entirely confined to the customs staff. The Commissioner, Mr. Stripling, is an old and valued member of this Society, whose hospitality to strangers in that country will astonish no one who knows him here. His residence is situated rather more than a mile from the settlement, and most of the staff live in the adjoining house; but ere long (that is as soon as the receipts begin to flow in) it is intended to build houses better suited to the requirements of the place.\n\nOn landing at Chi-mul-poo I found that I could ride to the capital, but my baggage would have to be carried by bulls.\nThe idea of veritable bulls being used as beasts of burden was new to me, but it appears that when hard-worked they are very quiet, and I soon got accustomed to seeing them toil along under enormous loads. A few cows are used for the same purpose, but their number is very limited compared with the number of bulls. (It may be remarked here that all the male cattle as well as the horses are entire, the process of castration not being practised in Corea except in the case of eunuchs required for the palace).\n\nThe breed of cattle is remarkably handsome, but the cows do not seem to give much milk.\n\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Stripling I was provided with a first-rate pony, but in spite of this the journey to the capital was rather tiresome. The country, though somewhat pretty, is on the whole uninteresting. The soil consists of disintegrated granite and other rocks, and consequently there are many large barren patches to be seen in every direction, some of the hills being absolutely bare.\n\nAs usual when travelling in such countries with some of the attendants on foot, it was necessary to go at a walk, and the consequence was that starting from Chi-mul-poo at 10 a.m. on Wednesday the 11th, we did not reach our resting place at the capital till 7.30 p.m.,\u2014the distance being about 25 or 26 miles.\n\nThe Capital of Corea\u2014Han-yang or Seoul as it is called on maps, Seoul as it is generally known by Koreans and by foreigners, and Hwang-ch\u00eang as it is usually called by the Chinese\u2014is a large but not very densely populated city.\n\nIt is surrounded by a wall, and has large and somewhat handsome gateways. The main roads are very wide, somewhat after the character of the roads in Peking, but being composed of disintegrated granite they dry very quickly after rain, and are much cleaner than the roads in the Chinese capital. The smaller sheets are filthy. They have side ditches into which is thrown all the refuse from the houses, and the smell is almost unbearable. The palaces\nand some of the public buildings are fine compared with the general run of house in the country, but compared with the public buildings of Western countries, or of those of Eastern countries which retain buildings erected in the days of their prosperity, they are very inferior.\n\nThe shops are very poor, many if not most of them being mat sheds erected in the main streets, but they are good enough for the wares exposed for sale. The natives display some ingenuity in ornamenting their pipe stems and in the manufacture of articles inlaid with mother-of-pearl, but a visitor wishing to bring away some memento of his trip may walk about a long time before he finds anything worth carrying away which is at the same time characteristic and pretty.\n\nAt Seoul I was most hospitably entertained by Mr. P. G. von M\u00f6llendorff, a member of the Corean Foreign Office and Chief of the Customs. The house in which he lives is one of the best in Seoul. It was the residence of one of the princes, who was murdered in it at the \u00e9meute in 1882. In consequence of this murder having taken place, none of the native officials cared to live in the house, and thus it was available when a residence was required for Mr. von M\u00f6llendorff. There is a large enclosure with several detached buildings.\n\nThe Coreans are in the habit of removing their shoes on entering a house, and the floors of the better houses are polished or covered with strong oiled paper. The roofs are low, and the doors being made to suit the small proportions of the Coreans, are in many cases very trying to the skulls of foreign visitors.\n\nAfter spending a few days at Seoul I received permission to make a trip into the interior. One of my greatest difficulties was an interpreter; I found to my horror that no one could be found who could speak Corean and English, and I feared my intercourse would be confined to what could filter through my boy, whose knowledge of English was of the most limited character, and a Corean who spoke Chinese; but I soon found that though my Chinese is of the feeblest, it was exactly the\nsame dialect as that of my interpreter, and before the end of the journey we got on capitally.\n\nMy party consisted of myself, an interpreter, a boy, and a coolie, all mounted on ponies, three ponies carrying baggage, and a chair and two chair coolies. The greater part of the time I travelled in company with a Corean official, and thus was permitted to lodge at the Yam\u00eans in the various cities which I visited. This official had a servant who rode a pack pony, while he himself had a chair with four bearers. The speed at which such a party can travel does not exceed $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles per hour, so that a 30 miles journey takes nine hours besides the time lost in stoppages, say two hours per day. Thus starting at 6.30 and travelling 30 miles one may expect to arrive at his destination at about 5.30 p.m.\n\nMy pony was only about ten hands, and I feared he would not be able to carry me, but he stood the journey remarkably well, only requiring a little care when the day's distance was exceptionally long. The chair was taken in case the pony should give out, and I tried it once to see how I liked it. Like other Corean chairs it had no seat, so that one had to sit cross-legged, and ten minutes was enough for me.\n\nEvery Corean who rides has a man to lead his pony. The saddles of the officials are so high that one wonders how the rider manages to keep his balance. The lower classes when riding have generally a certain amount of baggage, on top of which they sit. The servant of the official in whose company I travelled rode a China pony, and the baggage was so arranged as to give a level surface right across the two bundles and the pony's back. On top of this was laid a carpet, and there the servant squatted, sitting cross-legged, and smoking and fanning himself all day, while a mafoo led the pony. The Coreans exhibit considerable ingenuity in packing their own baggage on the pack ponies, but foreign baggage bothers them a good deal, and even such a thing as a bundle made up in a different way from what they are accustomed to, seems to present difficulties, though square boxes, large boots, jars of\noil, deer's horns, and all sorts of incongruous articles to which they are accustomed, seem to fit together like the parts of a dissected map. My portmanteau, if I did not watch it, was sure to be placed so that any rain would run into it; and on one occasion my bed, which was wrapped up in a waterproof sheet, was placed so that when opened after some three hours' heavy rain the sheet was half full of water, and I could not use my bed for three nights, while enough rain had got in at one end of my portmanteau to wet about two inches of every article in it. My baggage sustained a little damage on another occasion in fording a river which turned out to be a little deeper than was expected, but luckily at the worst ford which I crossed I was without baggage, as I was making only a day's excursion from a village where I was staying. At the last mentioned ford the water took the men nearly up to the arm pits. There was a village close by where the inhabitants were expected to supply men to carry travellers across the stream. The stream runs with considerable velocity when in flood, and it is hardly safe for one man to cross it alone. I was taken across on a chair, borne on the shoulders of six men; the officials, interpreters, &c., were carried in the same way; while the attendants and all the tag-rag and bob-tail that fasten on to a travelling party stripped, placed their clothes on their heads, and forded the stream two or three in company. Some ponies swam by themselves, others were held by a halter. I passed this same ford a week later with baggage, but the water was then low and there was no trouble. Getting one's baggage wet is one of the greatest annoyances in travelling, and I could not bear having my sleeping room heated to dry it, as I had had one night's experience of that and preferred damp clothes.\n\nIn a short visit one has hardly time to form any definite ideas regarding the manners and customs of the people, but certain peculiarities are sure to be brought prominently to one's notice.\n\nThe first night after I left Seoul I got into a miserable\ninn, and after having some dinner sat down on my bed to write a few notes. The night seemed oppressively hot but I saw no help for it, so had my mosquito net put up; but in tucking it under my bed, I found the floor so hot as almost to burn my hand. On enquiring I found that all proper sleeping rooms had fire places under them to warm them in winter, but in the poorer class of houses, for the sake of economy, this heating was done by the kitchen fire. As the thermometer during the day had been over $80^\\circ$, I felt no inclination to be cooked at night, so declared my intention of sleeping in the stable. At last, however, a room was found in a house about a quarter of a mile off where the fire had been out for some hours, and I managed to get through the night there, though the heat and the insects allowed me little rest. Subsequently in the better places I took care to give orders not to light the stove under my room, but I found that the native officials sometimes had theirs lighted in wet weather, in spite of the heat.\n\nWhen travelling by night it is necessary to get a proper pass from the officials. With this one has a right to demand torches and guides at each village. Sometimes the people object, and occasionally it results in a fight. It so happened that on the only two occasions when I travelled all night I was not in company with any official, and although I ordered all the torches to be paid for and all the guides to have a small present, I don't feel sure that the money always went to the right person. On one occasion at a lonely hamlet the people were very wroth at being turned out at one o'clock, and declared they had no torches; however, after a little bit of a free fight and a fruitless search in one or two houses, the attendants broke into one rather better-looking house and soon appeared with a large bundle of torches. Proceedings of this sort are to be deprecated, but at the moment I was passing on over an uninteresting bit of country to reach a city I wanted to see before the arrival of the steamer, and as I had had no-\nthing to eat since tiffin, and my boy nothing to eat since early breakfast at five o'clock, we were too anxious to get torches to be over particular as to the action of our attendant guards, who after all were only acting according to usual custom.\n\nSome of the torches consist of bundles of straw, but the best are branches of Scotch fir dried and partially split. On a dark night when the atmosphere was clear, our party of half a dozen ponies with their mafuos, and six or eight attendants with large torches looked quite picturesque. The route I followed from the time of landing at Chi-mul-poo till I embarked was Chi-mul-poo to Seoul, thence to a point some 30 miles beyond Kin-ching, thence by a somewhat different route back to the capital, thence to Chio-ha, and thence by an entirely different route to Chi-mul-poo, a distance altogether of about 350 miles. During my stay in the capital I had seen very few women; that is to say, most of those I had seen had their faces covered to a greater or less extent. Subsequently when travelling in the country I saw many. These were so ugly that at first I thought the pretty ones must all take great care to conceal their charms, but after having caught sight of a few whom I managed to see before they had time to wake up, I got fair proof that the uglier the women were the more they tried to hide themselves. I was confirmed in this view of the case by the fact that the only decent specimens of feminine humanity which I met with made no attempt at concealment, and I finally came to the conclusion that the women knew how hideous they were, and for the credit of their country they hid themselves from strangers as much as possible.\n\nThe attempts at hiding occasionally gave rise to amusing manoeuvres. On one occasion I came suddenly on a woman who had just crossed a river. The bank at which she had arrived offered no means of shelter, while the other bank was wooded. Though the river was 100 yards broad and tolerably swift, she at once turned and recrossed it, and as the\nwater came a long way above her knees the proceeding was not one which modesty would have suggested to a European.\n\nThe dress of the women consists of loose trousers covered by a skirt somewhat larger than that worn by Milk women in London. The skirt or petticoat has a very high waist. The shoulders and arms are covered by a very short jacket with long sleeves. The jacket is so short that it is little more than a collar, and between it and the skirt there is a lucid interval of five or six inches through which the breasts protrude or generally hang. Even when the face is carefully concealed, the women think nothing of exposing this part of their persons, and if the cloak over the face covers this also, it is only as a secondary affair.\n\nThe dress of the men is too well known by residents in Shanghai to require much description: trousers covered by a loose robe generally of linen, and a sort of long scarf of blue gauze, with a wide-brimmed hat of black horsehair. This hat is rather an elaborate affair; first there is a sort of fillet which encircles the head and is fastened by strings and connected with the knot of hair, which all Corean married men wear on the top of the head. On top of this a small brimless hat fits. This hat is worn in-doors, and varies in shape according to the rank of the official. The non-official class wear a very plain hat, but almost all have a slight knob or boss in front to make room for a jewel, which is often worn attached to the fillet above mentioned. This brimless hat is worn in the house, and in the case of the non-official class the wide-brimmed hat is worn over it. In the case of high officials the indoor hat is of too elaborate a description to be worn under the other hat, and it is therefore replaced by a plainer one before the out-of-doors hat is put on. To a European it would appear that if it were not for the honor of the thing a man would be as well off without a hat as with it, because being composed of very open horse-hair gauze it must offer very little protection from the sun or wind. The unmarried men do not tie up the hair\nin a knot, but part it in the centre and plait the ends into a queue at the back. Many of them have a great deal of hair, and when a traveller first sees them (generally in a boat at some little distance) he almost invariably supposes them to be women.\n\nIn some respects one travels in Corea with much more comfort than in China. Although a foreigner is much more of a curiosity there than in the latter country, he is much less pestered by inquisitive crowds. In those parts of China where a foreigner is nearly unknown, the crowds of rough natives are a source of much inconvenience and discomfort, even where they have no wish to do any harm. In Corea there are not so many large cities where roughs abound, and besides this the people are much more gentle in their ways, and though anxious to see seem equally anxious not to annoy. The accommodation, except in the Yam\u00eans, is simply filthy. Even there, although there is a show of cleanliness, as exemplified by the men taking off their shoes and by papering the floor, there is an amount of insect life perfectly appalling to a European, and I would strongly advise any intending traveller to provide himself with a pail of Keating's insect destroying powder.\n\nThe food which one can obtain is pretty much the same as in China: rice, chickens, eggs, vegetables of various sorts, Indian corn, beef, dried fish, and I presume in some localities fresh fish. The general drink of the people seemed to be cold water. This is accounted for by the magnificent streams of water, as clear as crystal, which are met with all through the country. Pools five or six feet deep are perfectly transparent, and even when the rivers are in flood after heavy rains only the slightest possible trace of turbidity is discoverable. This description does not apply to the tidal portions of the Seoul River. After passing Mapoo (near Seoul) this river runs through a great deal of low-lying alluvial country, and towards its mouth becomes muddy; and the mud from this and similar rivers seems to be the source of the soft slime which covers the foreshore in the neighbourhood of Jenchuan.\nIt was with difficulty that I could be persuaded that the Corean rivers in the district which I visited contained no fish, but such I found to be truly the case, and it is accounted for by the fact that at certain seasons they are nearly dry.\n\nBefore passing from the drink question, I may mention that the Coreans seem to be much more advanced in the matter of the use of spirituous liquors than their neighbours the Chinese. Their ordinary spirit is I think a good deal stronger than the ordinary Chinese samshoo, and either from this cause or from their imbibing in larger quantities, numerous drunken men may be seen reeling or lying about the streets. That this is due entirely to the spirit and not to any special inability to carry it is rendered quite certain by a series of most careful experiments with Scotch whiskey.\n\nAs one travels into the interior of Corea, though the formation of the country cannot be said to be materially changed, the scenery and the general appearance of vegetation gradually improves. Towards the coast the rock is near the surface and is barely covered with a thin stratum of poor soil. Inland, though the rocks still belong to the very old formation, there is a covering of rich black mould. The fields are more fertile and better cultivated; one sees rice, millet (Kao-liang), small millet (Siao-mi), beans, Indian corn, oats, barley, cotton, jute, flax, tobacco, and numerous other crops. The hills in many places are cultivated to the summit; in other places they are covered with woods. As far as I went I saw no forests, but at the furthest point which I reached some large trees were to be found in the woods.\n\nFor some distance inland the bottoms of the valleys were level plains from which the hills rose abruptly on either side, and through which ran a winding stream, clearly indicating that the valleys had been filled up by material brought down by the streams from the higher districts, and that little of the material was derived from the hills at the side. It seemed hard to reconcile this with the fact of the extraordinary clear-\nness of the water, but most of the detritus consists of clean sand, and a considerable quantity of that can be rolled along the bed of a river without making it in the least turbid. After getting 60 to 80 miles inland, I found the character of the valleys changed entirely. The hills no longer rose abruptly from level plains, but from the bottom of the hills proper there was a slope more or less steep reaching down to the stream, which no longer seemed free to wind about the valley at its pleasure, but was confined to one bed. After this country was reached, the scenery was very fine indeed. There were no mountains to be seen, but there were numberless very high hills, and when one reached the summit of a pass and could get an extensive view of the surrounding country, he felt well repaid for all the discomforts of a pretty trying journey.\n\nThe people as a rule seem poor. The cities, with the exception of Seoul, are without walls, and the villages are collections of miserable huts. In one city which I visited, Chia-ho, or Chio-ha, not only were there no ponies to be had, but there was not even a stable to be found. Notwithstanding this, the chief magistrate when carried in a chair was preceded by trumpeters and men with gongs, and was accompanied by a band, and the people prostrated themselves before him with the greatest respect. In every city which I visited I saw the same submission to the officials.\n\nAt a magistrate's Yain\u00ean at night a piece of music is played by a band. This music which lasts four or five minutes could not be mistaken for Chinese music; but further than saying that it has a character of its own I am unable to describe it.\n\nLike China the country is cursed with an inordinate number of officials, and expectant officials. There being no road to distinction except through office, the number of candidates is necessarily out of all proportion to the posts. Many of the subordinate expectant officials have an allowance of rice and about $2 a month. Under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that on one occasion on leaving a place I\nwas told I owed a dollar for some eggs and a few other little things I had bought, and when I paid it at least 20 respectable-looking men sat down on the floor and went into an elaborate system of accounts to see how much belonged to each for the portion he had provided. These men seem to be absolutely without occupation, and appear to a stranger to be a useless, lazy lot of hangers-on at the Yamcha. If any man can stand several years of such a life and still preserve some energy for work when his time comes, he must be a man of considerable strength of character, and perhaps well worthy of the respect which is shown him.\n\nThe agricultural classes seem to a great extent to provide for their own wants, that is to say they grow crops in the first place for their own use, and only sell the balance. One came upon no districts where apparently the people grew one crop for sale and lived on the proceeds. The whole family works, when necessary, in the fields. I saw women on many occasions transplanting rice, a sort of work which I have never seen them perform in China. There seems to be an utter absence of the class of merchant. The producer seems to sell his surplus to the retail dealer, and there are no large stocks of manufactured articles anywhere. I was informed that even in the matter of hats it was difficult to find one ready made; they were all made to order.\n\nThe Coreans make use of very few mechanical contrivances, but I noticed one for hulling rice similar to the ones used in Formosa and other parts of China. It can only be used in places where the streams have a considerable fall, and is unsuitable to a flat country. A long beam fixed on a pivot carries a sort of cistern at one end, and a hammer or pestle at the other. This is placed on the bank of a stream, and water from a higher portion of the stream is brought along an artificial channel and made to discharge into the cistern. As soon as the cistern is full, it weighs down that end of the beam\u2014raising the pestle, but in doing this it practically upsets the\ncistern and allows the water to run out into the stream below. When the cistern is emptied, the pestle falls with great force on the rice which is placed in a mortar. This action brings the cistern again under the spout of water, and the process is repeated. The cistern holds about a ton of water, and the machine gives about four strokes per minute.\n\nThere is one implement, I might almost say one agricultural machine, in use in Corea which deserves some notice, viz: the spade. I have heard of an egg so big that it required two hens to lay it, and of a window so large that it required two people to see out of it, but I never expected to see in Corea a spade so large that it required five men to use it. The spade or shovel consists of a flat piece of wood shod with iron, and provided with a long handle. To each side of the blade of the shovel there is attached a rope, and in the larger shovels each of these ropes is split into two. When in use one man takes the handle of the shovel to direct it, but apparently does little in the way of supplying power, which is furnished by the four men who pull the ropes. The directing man, the helmsman so to speak, inserts the point of the shovel in the stuff to be moved, the rope pullers give a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, and, if the ropes do not break, about half a shovelful of earth is detached and thrown a small distance. To any one who believes that it is the duty of a government to find the greatest amount of work for the greatest number this invention would appear to be of the highest utility.\n\nThere is I believe an abundance of game in some parts of Corea, but there was very little to be seen along the route that I travelled.\n\nI saw some deers' antlers, and the skins of some small wild pigs, but I saw no live specimens, and only one pheasant and a few cranes and any number of paddy birds. I was told there were tigers in the woods, but that they were never seen. Probably there used to be tigers, but they have now gone north to the more thinly populated districts.\nOf the insect life (with the exception of the domestic parasite above alluded to) I can say little, but one could not fail to remark the magnificent butterflies, some gaily colored and others jet black, with wings as large as the palm of my hand. The green and red dragon flies, metallic beetles and other attractive insects were very common. Near Seoul there are numerous scizzor-grinders; up-country I heard scarcely any, but there were millions of wee-wees which, as far as I know, are unknown south of Peking.\n\nThe measures of weight, of distance and of value are apparently much the same in Corea as in China, though it is really difficult to get information on such apparently simple matters. The Coreans had, however, the picul, the catty, and the tael for weight, and their li is as nearly as possible the third of an English mile. For money they have little besides cash in use, but they count by the tael. A short time ago silver coins of 1, 2 and 3 mace value were struck or rather cast, but they have been recalled, being supposed to be rather too high in value, and likely to leave the country. The ordinary cash are about the size of Chinese cash, but they are exchanged at the rate of 750 cash to a tael or 525 to a dollar.\\(^1\\) This makes them equal in value to about 2 Shanghai cash.\n\nThe exchange does not vary, but this of course arises from the fact that practically all transactions are in cash, and when one speaks of a payment of 100 taels one only means 100 bundles of 750 cash each. When business begins to flourish, and traders begin to make bargains for payment in silver, exchange must vary unless the system of a standard coin and token currency can be introduced, which would be very difficult, though the attempt would probably not be so hopeless as in China. At present the tael may almost be taken as a token for 750 cash, and the large cash which are equal to 5 small cash invariably pass at their proportionate value. The gener-\n\n\\(^1\\) A few months after this was written, foreign intercourse had raised the rate of exchange of the dollar at Chi-mul-poo to over 700 cash. G. J. M.\nal impression left on my mind was that Corea was a country of great capabilities, but the primitive condition of the people and the absence of any large native trade place great obstacles in the way of a rapid opening-up of the country.\n\nThe country is capable of producing exports of many kinds, but these have not yet been produced in sufficient quantities to exchange them for any considerable quantity of imports. It is impossible to produce any of the export articles at a moment's notice, and for several years while an export trade is being worked up, a small amount of imports must be doled out to them, leaving a very small and very problematical profit to the foreign merchants. The fact that the country was shut up inspired most exaggerated ideas regarding the enormous trade that was sure to spring up immediately it was opened. These ideas have I think been pretty well dissipated, but believing as I do that the poverty is more in the people than in the country, I think there is fair reason to hope that ere many years are past the open ports of Corea may be flourishing centres of trade.\nARTICLE VI.\n\nNOTES ON SOME DIKES AT THE MOUTH OF THE NANKOW PASS.\n\nBY\n\nH. B. GUPPY, M.B.\n\nSURGEON, R.N.\n\nWhilst remaining a day at Nankow during an excursion to the Great Wall in November 1878, I came upon three basaltic dikes cutting through the outcropping edges of the limestone beds; they were lying close under an old square tower which is situated on the north side of the small stream where it passes the town. They pierced the limestone beds at right angles to the strike: their direction therefore corresponded with the dip, being S.S.E.\u2014N.N.W.; (the beds of limestone of the district are inclined to the S.S.E. at an angle varying from 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0). The smallest of the three dikes, which was a foot in width, became at one portion of its course suddenly contracted; and it assumed a rather tortuous outline before it was lost to view, where its width was about three inches. The dike adjacent, which was separated by about four feet of rock, was about two and a half feet across. Next to it and separated by about two feet of rock was another dike\u2014also two and a half feet wide. The extent of surface over which they could be traced I roughly placed at from 25 to 30 yards. The want of correspondence between the portions of the dikes on the opposite sides of a little hollow between two beds of limestone afforded evidence of a lateral movement; which, after the consolidation of the intrusive basalt, fractured the dikes and displaced the limestone beds along the line of strike. There seemed to have been a lateral movement of about a foot in the case of the two left-hand dikes (vide diagram); whilst the one on the right only exhibited about\nhalf a foot of displacement. The limestone in contact with one and adjacent to the basalt did not display those well-marked effects of the proximity of an igneous rock which one might have anticipated. A tendency to become more fissile, and the formation of concentric concretions some two or three inches wide which projected above the surface of the rock, appeared to me to be the most noticeable signs of \"alteration.\" Such are a few notes on the subject of these dikes, which deserve a careful examination from any one who may interest himself in the geology of this region. It is worthy of note that Sir Charles Lyell in his \"Student's Elements of Geology\" describes some dikes of vesicular and amygdaloidal lava near Palagonia in Sicily, which, as shewn in a ground-plan in his work (page 532), exhibit evidence of lateral movement as well as of tortuosity.\n\nH.M.S.

GUPPY, M.B.\n\nSURGEON, R.N.\n\nWhilst at Tientsin in the winter 1878-1879, I visited two of the Samshu breweries in the suburbs of that city, and made the following notes on the mode of preparation of this spirit.\n\nThe first step in the process is concerned with the production of the fermenting-element or yeast. This is obtained by grinding down a quantity of oats and barley or some other cereals; the powder is then moistened and shaped into brick-like cakes, and is kept for a period varying between six and twelve months before it is ready for use: some of these cakes, which I observed stowed away like bricks in the corner of one of the buildings, were much worm-eaten and partially encrusted with mould. When required for use the cakes of this fermenting-element are reduced to a fine powder, which is kept dry and ready at hand. This powder when examined microscopically is shewn to be composed in great part of the starch-cells of either barley or wheat, together with a large number of small disconnected bodies which exhibit a lively molecular motion when moistened, and are evidently the spore-cells of the ferment-fungus.\n\nThe next stage\u2014that of fermentation\u2014may be thus described. In a building, which is kept cool in summer and artificially warm in winter, a number of large earthen jars are buried in the ground with their mouths on a level with the surface; these jars are filled with millet-grains previously mixed with about five catties of the powdered yeast-cake, and moistened with water; when filled, each jar\nis plastered over with mud and covered with millet-refuse; and there it is allowed to remain undisturbed for ten or eleven days, during which time the fermentation is in active operation. On examining with the microscope a small portion of millet which had been thus fermenting for ten days, I found it composed of starch-cells scattered sparsely about, and of an abundance of smaller yeast-cells sometimes disconnected and at other times developing in chains or rows.\n\nThe process of distillation occupies about an hour. When the fermented millet is taken out from the jars, it is placed in a large wooden vat or tub, the bottom of which is made of a kind of grating; and beneath this vat is placed a large boiler of water which is heated by an adjacent furnace. The steam ascending through the grating and passing through the fermented millet finally comes into contact with a cylinder of cold water; it is there condensed, and trickling off into a little gutter finds its way out through a long spout in a clear stream of veritable samshu. After the process is completed, the vat is emptied of the millet, which is subsequently dried and sold as fodder for ponies, donkeys, etc.\n\n\"Kow-liang\" is, I believe, the name of samshu thus prepared from millet. The spirit to which these notes refer, is that which is in common use amongst the poorer classes in Tientsin; and in two different samples which I examined the proportion of alcohol by volume varied between 48 and 54 per cent. I was informed that the samshu drunk by the higher ranks is a weaker spirit, and is only prepared on the approach of the warm season.\n\nH.M.S. Lark.\nSolomon Islands, April 13th 1883.\nMr. Little, in introducing his paper, remarked; that, it was only owing to the urgent solicitation of their energetic President, who had exerted himself so successfully to procure papers for the meetings, that he had consented to produce before the members his notes on a subject which had been already thoroughly treated by travellers so distinguished as Blakiston, Baber, Richthofen and Armand David. He had gone over no new ground and had nothing new to tell. He hoped that the relation of what he had seen would prove interesting and lead to a discussion on the points raised in his paper. He would begin by giving a general outline of the main physical features of the Yangtze valley and conclude by a brief account of his journey to Chungking.\n\nThe Yangtse River which, traversing the country from West to East, may be said to divide the Chinese Empire into two nearly equal portions,\u2014eight provinces being situated on its left bank with precisely the same number on the South; two only, Ngan-hui and Kiang-su, lying partly on both banks,\u2014has a course of about three thousand miles in length. For two-thirds of this distance it runs through a mountain land in a continuous ravine, the valley being nowhere wider than the actual river bed. In the lower portion of its course, which forms the remaining third of the distance, the valley widens out and the stream flows through an alluvial plain, following\ngenerally the southern boundary of its valley except where it forces its way through the limestone range which forms the boundary of Kiangse and Hupeh, above the town of Kiukiang, past the vertical cliffs called Split Hill and Cock's Head in our English charts, until it emerges into its delta proper near Kiang-yin, 110 miles above the entrance to its estuary at Yangtse cape. The stream issues from the mountains at the Ichang gorge, just 1,000 nautical miles from its mouth; and some 50 miles below this point the boulders and gravel of the upper river disappear to give place to banks of soft alluvium, the outline of which varies every season, notwithstanding the gigantic embankments with which it is sought to retain the stream in its channel. These begin a short distance above the important emporium of Shasze, situated in the middle of the great plain of Hupeh, 83 miles below Ichang. Here we find the river at the time of its summer floods running with a four and five knot current at a level of 15 or 20 feet above that of the surrounding country, the great dyke on the North bank being continuous nearly to Hankow, while the South bank is open to the floods as far as the eye can reach; a vast inland sea is then formed, which mingles its waters with those of the Tung-ting lake proper, from which its outline is undistinguishable. The fall of the bed from Hankow downwards must, if Mr. Baber's observations are to be relied on, be extremely slight. But for the accuracy for which that model traveller's work is undeniably distinguished, one would almost be inclined to doubt his results. A comparison of three years' simultaneous barometrical readings at Chungking and Sikawei the resum\u00e9 of some 4,000 observations given in Mr. Baber's work, exhibits a difference in level between the two places of only 630 feet. This altitude is correct only upon assuming the two places to be on the same isobaric, which is hardly likely. I think, all things considered, we may safely assume the normal mean pressure at the inland station to be not more than one-tenth greater than that on the sea-coast, in which case the\nmaximum possible addition to Mr. Baber's altitude would be 100 feet and this puts the height of Chungking at the still comparatively low level of 730 feet. Let us take half this difference and assume the level to be 680 feet. Now as the average rate of the current down the rapids which, large and small, obstruct the river throughout the whole distance of 400 nautical miles between Chungking and Ichang, is not less than six knots, the estimate of Captain Blakiston, (another traveller remarkable for his assiduous work,) of a fall of 14 inches to the mile between these two places, cannot be considered excessive. This would give a total of 467 feet as the fall for the 400 miles between Chungking and Ichang, leaving 213 feet only for the 1,000 miles between Ichang and the sea. It will be interesting, now that an efficient Customs' staff is engaged at Ichang in recording the needful observations to test this datum by their results when published. If correct, it would show that Hankow is little more than 150 feet above sea level, a fact not generally credited. The great fall in the river bed is as is only natural, in the upper half of its course, where the stream rushes, as an unnavigable mountain torrent through the defiles of the almost impenetrable ranges of Western Szechuen and Thibet, and where Mr. Baber estimates the fall at no less than six feet per mile. The average speed of the, by comparison, more tranquil lower half of the river's current, say from Pingshan to the sea, a distance of 1,600 miles is still, as Captain Blakiston points out, double that of the Nile and Amazon and 3 times that of the Ganges. The volume of water brought down per second as measured by the same observer, is at Ichang in June 675,800 feet; that at Hankow at the same period according to Dr. Guppy of the \"Hornet,\" who utilised his stay there to carry out an elaborate series of observations on the subject, being nearly one million feet, the increase being due to the influx from the Tungting Lake and from the Han river the only true affluents between these two points. Compared with these figures it is curious to note that the\nwater discharged into the sea by the old familiar Thames is estimated at 2,300 cubic feet per second. Reducing the figures given by Captain Blakiston for Ichang in June to the average of the whole year on the basis of Dr. Guppy's monthly observations in Hankow, we find the discharge at the former port to be actually 560,000 feet per second for the whole year round which would make the volume of water at Ichang, 1,000 miles from the sea, just 244 times that of the Thames at London.\n\nThe comparison of the sediment annually brought down by the respective rivers at these two points is as 2,000,000 cubic feet to 5,000,000,000 or as 1 to 2,500. Taking the drainage area of the upper Yangtse at 500,000 square miles and estimating the sediment discharged as above both Captain Blakiston's and Dr. Guppy's figures give a rate of subaerial denudation for the whole catchment basin of about one foot in 3,000 years. This consideration becomes important when we come to study the geological formation and natural aspect of the province of Szechuen of which I propose to give a brief outline before we conclude.\n\nIt seems to me a matter of no doubt that in ancient times the Yangtse River upon leaving the mountains discharged its waters into the ocean through a series of lakes analogous, in a way, to the manner in which at the present day the waters of the Saskatchewan discharge themselves through Lake Winnipeg and the great Canadian Lakes into the Atlantic. The remains of these lakes are still visible in the flooded country which extends each summer many miles back on either bank, the whole distance from a little below Ichang right down to Chinkiang,\u2014a length of 800 miles. When we see that each summer nearly half an inch of sediment is deposited and the level of the surrounding country raised each year to that extent, we cannot help being struck with two facts: one, the vast depth of the original lake bottoms; the soil set free by the erosion of the Szechuen water-courses to a level of many\nhundred feet below that of the original plain has failed even now entirely to fill up the vast cavities once occupied by these ancient lakes; the other striking fact is the very recent formation of the existing landscape. China, in fact, the oldest extant country politically, is geographically one of the very newest. A few years more, geologically speaking, and these basins will be entirely filled and the whole of the sediment brought down will be available for promoting the advance of the coast seawards, an advance even now so great that every resident of a few years only in Shanghai has had ocular demonstration of it.\n\nI think then we may assume that the first of these Great Lakes extended from the Western Mountains, formerly known as the Y-ling or Hills of the Barbarians, the easternmost spurs of which are lost near the village of Tungche some 30 miles below Ichang, down to the range of the Wu-hs\u00fceh hills which occupy nearly one hundred miles, or two thirds of the distance between Hankow and Kiukiang, and through which the river flows with a rapid current in a confined channel joining, much as the Detroit river connects Lake Michigan with Lake Ontario, this upper lake with the next in the series of small lakes, through which the river at one time discharged into the ocean. The first of these I take to be represented by the plain North of Kiukiang and the valley west of Ngan-king. Below this again we have the small plain, of which Wuhu is the centre, forming another lakelet and connected with the lake above by the winding, rock-infested channel which flows round Hen Point and athwart the mountain ranges of Ngan-hui. The Eastern boundary of this lake would seem to be the hills environing the old city of Taiping-fu. We then come to Nanking, to the South of which now stretches a large alluvial plain, 25 miles across, the lower portion of which is still, for a considerable period of the year, below the level of the river and which apparently formerly communicated with the Tai-Hu and the series of lakes of lower Kiangsu. At the present day we find these ancient\nlakes practically filled up, being only just in time to see the finishing touches being given by the annual summer floods, to the land that now occupies their site. Formerly the bulk of the sediment was arrested in these lakes and the turn of the delta had not then come. At that time doubtless the river flowed through \"the Pillars\" which were then close to its mouth, in a comparatively pellucid stream, an hypothesis which is confirmed by the fossils of the old beaches found in the neighbourhood. I have myself at rare intervals in the depth of a dry winter, noticed clear water and an absence of current at this very spot.\n\nAt the same time, however, we have no reason to expect that as the banks become thus rapidly raised, in a short time the floods will cease altogether, natural as this result would at first sight seem to be:\u2014for, the bed of the river must be rising simultaneously in the ratio of its extension seawards, and thus higher and higher banks are constantly needed.\n\nMarco Polo, 600 years ago, in his chapter on the \"Great River Kian\" says \"It is in some places 10 miles wide, in others eight, in others six, and it is more than 100 days journey in length from one end to the other\u2014\u2014It seems indeed more like a sea than a river.\"\n\nNow if, as is probable, Marco visited the river during the summer floods, this is no exaggeration and it is curious to find Colonel Yule criticising this passage as exaggerated and giving, as a probable explanation, the fact that Marco's expressions about the river were perhaps accompanied by a mental reference to the term \"Dalai\" The sea, which the Mongols appear to have given to the river.\n\nWe thus ascend by a series of wide steps, to Ichang a total height of about 200 feet. Here, where the river issues from the mountains, we continue our ascent by a series of short steep steps, well described by the Chinese as M\u00ean-ka'rh, or thresholds, and over each of which flows one of the famous Yangtse rapids\u2014\"effrayantes cataractes\" as they are termed\nby the worthy P\u00e8re Amand David; but at the same time rapids amenable in my opinion to steam power, should the Chinese ever take the matter seriously in hand and encourage Western enterprise in that direction. These steps lead us by way of the celebrated gorges through the limestone ranges which bound Szechuen on the East and divide it from the wide plain of Hu-koang, the province of Broad Lakes. We are now in the Red Basin of Richthofen and traverse the vast modern sandstone formation of Eastern Szechuen in a ravine cut down 1,000 feet or more below its surface. Here owing to the softer nature of the rock the rapids are less violent, although still of almost continuous occurrence and we have always a fierce current to contend against. These conditions prevail until, on the one hand, in the Kin-sha-kiang we meet with a torrent flowing through inaccessible gorges and on the other hand, in the Min river which, by the Chinese, is regarded as the true Kiang or main-stream, we ascend to the unique plateau of Cheng-tu. This plateau is our next step upwards from Chungking and is just 1,000 feet above the level of that city. Beyond this plain, famous for its fertility and elaborate system of irrigation and which runs in a N.W. and S.E. direction 90 miles in length by 40 in width, the mountains on the West, (the nearest conspicuous peak of which is the famous O-shan) rise rapidly to a height of 12,000 feet and upwards, and form the Eastern bulwarks of the great Thibetan plateau beyond. This alluvial plain of Cheng-tu through which now flows a net-work of clear streams with gravelly beds, was also once a lake whose basin was gradually filled with the boulders and coarser detritus from these Western mountains. Below that, possibly in tertiary times, we have the evidence of the sea that formerly occupied the now rugged country of Eastern Szechuen and in which the coal measures with the superincumbent sandstones of which the surface is now composed, were deposited. At a subsequent period, as the land rose, the surface of the former sea-bed must have gradually become exposed to denudation and then the channels of the\npresent rivers began to be cut out; and if as seems probable, a dam then existed on the Eastern border of this sea, it had not been broken through nor had the gorges, through which the water subsequently escaped seawards, then been opened. Through and across this sandstone plain, run a succession of parallel ranges of limestone mountains, all trending more or less in a N. and S. direction and rising to a height of 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the sea, forming the \"cross ranges\" through which the Yangtse and its affluents now break their way in a series of magnificent gorges. The intervening plateaus, originally level, except where tilted up against the steep flanks of these ancient ranges, have since been worn away by erosion into a fantastically rugged landscape, reminding one of the picturesque scenery of the Saxon Switzerland but on a grander scale. Every stream, large and small, has cut its way down and flows in a steep ravine, ascending which, except always in the neighbourhood of the \"cross ranges\" a small stretch of comparatively level ground is reached until the next ravine is met with. Hence the land roads are mainly a succession of ascending and descending stone staircases, up and down which, the sturdy little Kueichow ponies, to the manner born, scamper with astonishing nonchalance. It is in spots where these sandstone cliffs overhang the stream that we find the square, port-hole looking, entrances of the ancient cave-dwellers described by Mr. Baber and spoken of by the modern inhabitants of the province as Mantze. Coal underlies the whole formation and is exposed at the surface in the gorges of the Yangtse and its affluents where these cut through the cross ranges. It is largely mined, coal forming the staple fuel of the country; the junks of the upper waters all have their brick chimney and at meal times when vomiting the soft-coal smoke have the appearance of antediluvian steamers.\n\nThe peculiarity of the Yangtse, as distinguished from the other great rivers which take their rise in the South-eastern\ncorner of the Thibetan plateau, the Irrawaddy, the Salween and the Mekong, is that, whereas all four, in the early part of their courses flow close together in parallel valleys running North and South, the three latter alone continue to follow the prevailing lay of the mountain ranges and retain a Southward course. On the other hand the Yangtse, or Kin-sha-kiang as it is here designated, after accompanying its neighbours down through nearly ten degrees of latitude, upon reaching the vicinity of Talifu in Yunnan, recurves suddenly northwards, abandons its associates and strikes out a course of its own athwart the rows of mountain barriers which fail to turn it aside from its steady progress to the Eastern sea. Owing to the circumstance of its course being thus mainly in a direction transverse to the axes of the ranges traversed by it, we find its channel down to its emergence in the plains of Hupeh to be a series of zigzags, consisting of a succession of reaches running at right angles, alternately S. W. and N. E. and N. W. and S. E. In the former it runs in comparatively open ravines parallel to the radial axes of the mountains enclosing it. In the latter it breaks through them by the magnificent clefts of the gorges. The strata in these are for the most part horizontal or only slightly inclined and it would appear that they are natural splits in the rocks and not gorges gradually formed by erosion like that below the falls of Niagara. In some of the gorges, and these spots naturally afford the most striking views, the split takes a sharp rectangular turn such as is only likely to occur in horizontal strata with vertical cleavage, the absence of more extended denudation being very wonderful and, to me, inexplicable.\n\nIn the outlying spurs which extend Eastwards from the Ichang gorge we find sandstone and coarse conglomerate, the latter predominating, isolated ranges composed almost entirely of conglomerate rising to a height of 2,000 feet and upwards. South-East of Ichang up the Itu river, a small affluent taking its rise in Honan, which enters the right bank 32 miles below\nJehang in a country not yet explored by the geologist, copper has been found; and a native mining engineer in the pay of Mr. Tong-king-sing was engaged at the time of my visit in attempting to open up mines of that metal. Extensive iron mines are worked by the natives along the river's course between Wu-shan and Wan-hsien, a distance of 100 miles. The iron is brought down in the minute bars affected by the native trade, by numerous small affluents on the left bank, at and between these two places. The sandstones of Szechuen are largely impregnated with iron the washings from which give the red colour to the summer floods. There seems little doubt that these floods which culminate each summer in the Hankow plain, are mainly attributable to the spring rains, the snow from the mountains of the Thibetan frontier yielding only a limited contribution. On the other hand these mountains undoubtedly furnish the golden sands of which a fresh layer is deposited each summer in the river's bed. Throughout the whole course of the upper Yangtse, down to the entrance of the Tungting lake, in winter when the sand and boulder flats are laid bare, gold washing is steadily carried on and a journey up the river immediately before the spring rise exhibits these flats connected into stretches of mounds, having the appearance of a native graveyard; this is due to the refuse heaps of the few cradles employed which are moved from spot to spot and gradually traverse the whole bank. The earnings are small but it is worth the while of the country people to employ their winter leisure at this work. Their earnings, as I gathered from numerous enquiries on the spot, seldom exceed 20 cents per day per man, but the steady supply would seem to indicate the presence of a rich matrix beyond. Immediately below Kuei-chow-fu or Kuei-koan, the famous Likin station situated at the head of the big gorges, salt-wells are in full swing throughout the winter, from the time the large boulder-bank, through which the borings are made, is exposed in December until it is again covered in May. The brine is hoisted to the surface and evaporated, by the aid\nof coal, on the spot. Having only been able to make a flying visit last spring, I had no opportunity of stopping to make an examination of this nor of many other interesting spots. I propose merely to give you a rapid outline of my journey with a slight notice of the aspect of the country I traversed. At the time of my departure from Hankow last February the river was at its lowest and the Kiang-tung, the steamer by which communication is maintained with Ichang, had ceased to run, there being little more than four feet of water in the channel which meanders through the extensive sandflats at Sunday Island and Salamis Point, the native name for the spot being Tien-hsing-chow. Until I arrived in Hankow, I had no idea that the river was unnavigable for steamers in winter and, misled by the standing advertisement of the \"China Merchants\" Company in the North-China Daily News attached to the departure notice of each Hankow steamer\u2014\"taking through cargo for Ichang\" I arrived at Hankow in the expectation of proceeding by steam. I, however, found myself dependent upon native means of transport and upon enquiry found that at that time, February, junks often occupied five and six weeks in the ascent, having to wait for a fair wind to take them through each of the many winding reaches which meander through the Hupeh plain. But only heavy goods take this route. A short cut across the lakes to the North of the river, which extend from the banks of the Han to above Shasze, is used for all light traffic. This route begins in a creek, the mouth of which is situated at a place called Kin-kou, 7 miles above Hankow, and ends in a canal, the head of which abuts against the great dyke upon which the emporium of Shasze is built, thus necessitating a short portage for all goods destined for Ichang or higher up. The creek by which the lakes are entered, and which I call a creek advisedly, although it is known to the natives of the place as the \"Chang-ho\" or \"Long River,\" is one of those peculiar channels which exists throughout the whole of the lower division of the Yangtse valley and which communicate\nwith the existing limited remains of the ancient lakes of which I just now spoke. Their peculiarity consists in the fact of their being effluents in summer and affluents in winter. At one season they drain off the surplus water which they have conveyed inland in the other; taking the sand-laden water up and returning it pure. The Yangtse being now at its lowest, we found the water running out through a narrow channel between high mud-banks in a six-knot torrent and we tracked up with three men in the small flat-bottomed boat I had hired for the trip, with great difficulty. It took us a week to crawl up this desolate stream whose length I estimated at 60 or 70 miles, the current higher up slackening to a more manageable speed. At its source in the lakes, however, there was a sharp overflow, of beautiful bright clear water which we surmounted not without some trouble and delay. Another week was spent in traversing the lakes, which consist of a string of shallow lagoons, from 2 to 10 miles across, connected together by embanked channels, on and behind which the wretched looking towns and villages of this poverty-stricken province are built. The current in these canals was at times favourable, though generally adverse, making the hydrography of the district a puzzle which it would require some study thoroughly to unravel. In one place we passed from a lake into a canal by a breach in the embankment, through which rushed a torrent of water which necessitated our hiring 20 extra coolies to pull us through. The lakes were entirely covered with the Chiaopai, a jointed waterplant, with edible celery-like roots: the dead leaves and stalks covering the surface in a tangled mass and contributing another shade of brownish yellow to the dull monotone of the mud-coloured landscape. The presence of this water plant enables the lakes to be navigated in safety during the winter gales by the smallest craft, as no sea can get up. The channels radiate through the weeds like roads drawn by a ruler across the map. Millions of water-fowl have here their winter home, different sections of the lake\ncountry being parcelled out among the fowlers who make a business of netting them: these men pay a fixed tax for the privilege and are very jealous of a foreign sportsman. The fortnight I passed in this boat was one of the worst in the year; rain and snow-storms were almost continuous and the hills on the North-West, whence, I was informed by the natives, the excessive water-supply was derived, were nowhere visible. The lakes were all above their normal level, the reclaimed portions at their edges and along the banks of the canals which are cultivated with paddy, being all submerged. This state of things had existed two years during which time no crops had been reaped and the misery of the residue of population left in the country and the consequent rebellious spirit of the Hupeh peasantry, may be imagined. Nearing Shasze the country assumes a more civilised aspect, the last six miles of the journey being through cultivated fields and the grave-mounds, which cover such an extensive surface in the neighbourhood of all Chinese cities. Arriving at Shasze, and mooring at the head of the canal, the population, largely composed of Hunan people, fully maintained their reputation of \"barbarian-compelling braves\" by saluting me with the too-customary brickbat, a supply of which obnoxious article seems always ready to hand in such places. I had to retreat for the night to a sequestered spot lower down the canal, leaving my native companion to charter a boat on the Yangtse side of the embankment, for the continuation of my voyage to Chung-king. I may here mention that I paid $6 for the hire of my boat with three men from Hankow to Shasze and $16 for that from Shasze to Chung-king; the distance in the one case being about 200 miles and in the latter 500. The distance by the windings of the river from Hankow to Shasze is, according to the admiralty chart, 287 knots. Shasze is the natural meeting-point of the navigations of the Upper and Lower Rivers and it has thus become the transit station and great inland shipping emporium for the interchange of Western produce\nor \"Chuen-ho\" i.e. goods from Szechuen, with the cotton, piece-goods and sea products of the plain and coast. In this respect its rise and situation are analogous to that of Hankow at the terminus of the Han navigation and like that mart, it is built, as its name implies, on a sand-bank surrounded by water and at times entirely submerged in it. The unruliness of the Shasze population is due to the floating nature of its inhabitants and the absence of any high official authority, the nearest walled town being the prefectural city of Kin-chow where the Taotai resides: this city is situated a few miles higher up and about a mile inland and is not visible from the river, its walls and roofs being below the level of the huge embankment. All along the face of the town this embankment which, at the time of my visit, towered some fifty feet above the water, is handsomely faced with stone, not unlike the somewhat similarly situated British concession at Hankow. The Chinese speak of Shasze as the \"Ch\u00ean,\" Hankow the \"K'ow\" and Shanghai the \"Hsien\" par excellence, of the Empire. There is no doubt that, under present circumstances, the opening of this port to foreign trade, in lieu of Ichang, would have been productive of far better results, although possibly, with steamers running through Szechuen, a contingency probably contemplated by the advocates of Ichang, (but who, I am convinced, cannot have visited the place themselves) a transfer of the trade to the latter depot may, in time, be effected. At present, that any transhipments of downward produce at all are made in Ichang is due to the fact of the half duties, under the transit-pass system, being payable at the Ichang customs. Ichang itself is a pattern specimen of the dirt decay and misery of almost every inland town (always excepting those in Szechuen) to which the revivifying influence of foreign contact, direct or indirect, is wanting. Let us hope that the Chinese authorities, by the real opening up of the rich country beyond, will do their best to encourage such revival.\nNotwithstanding that the port has been opened six years, no merchant has thought it worth his while to settle there, though there are rumours of more than one effort being about to be made in that direction. Thus far, the foreign community of Ichang comprises only the Customs' staff, the inevitable missionary and about the tenth part of a Consul who has an office here which he periodically visits but who in view of the barrenness of the field, is considerately allowed to have his home in Hankow. Shasze is one of the Yangtze stages, socalled, and the shipment and delivery of goods by steamers is permitted there under the new Customs regulations promulgated in 1877, for that object. But so many difficulties are connected with the working of these regulations that as yet the China Merchants Co. has found it impossible to avail of the privilege.\n\nThe distance from Shasze to Ichang is 83 nautical miles which, favoured by the usual up-river breeze, it took us a little over three days to accomplish. On the morning of the second day, I first noticed boulders covering the sand-flats and this evidence of our approach to the mountains put me in high spirits after the long monotony of the dreary mud flats I had hitherto been traversing. Above this the river quickly changed its character and from a huge ditch with perpendicular walls of crumbling mud became transformed into the semblance of what we usually understand by a river in Europe;\u2014a clear blue stream with clean gravelly banks along which one could walk with comfort and pleasure, with high ground in the near distance. The dejected looking hamlets of mud and wattle, temporary erections which have to be removed each summer, with no vestige of vegetation near them and which are the sole signs of human activity visible to a traveller on the river in winter, gave place to substantial villages embowered in groves of willow and fruit-trees, these latter bursting into blossom. The winter wheat which, lower down, was only just appearing above the ground, was here,\nalready in early March, over a foot high, the shelter of the distant mountains inducing a milder climate. Soon the lower spurs of the hills themselves reached to the bank and on the third day we coasted for some distance under a veritable sandstone cliff 10 feet in height. Thence we sailed past the walled city of Itu 20 miles from Ichang, to the Tiger Teeth gorge, where the hills are at length throughout conterminous with the banks. This gorge, which is situated 10 miles below Ichang consists of a low range of conglomerate, through which a channel has been probably eroded by the river. The walls of the gorge, which is only a mile long, are vertical for about 200 feet only, steep hills rising from them some 500 feet higher. The conglomerate of which they appear to be entirely composed is coarse and very hard. Ichang itself, situated on the left bank, is built upon a ledge of conglomerate, formerly an island submerged in the summer floods, curiously undermined in places, the actual site of the city being quite level. At the back is a depression now occupied with paddy fields and behind this the ground rises gradually to a height of 100 feet at a mile's distance; the whole is entirely covered with a thick eruption of ancient grass-covered grave-mounds. Below the conglomerate ledge there extends, in winter, nearly half way across the river, a level sand-flat forming the anchorage of the port. The right bank is steep-to and even now, in winter, a three-knot current runs under it: in summer the current there often attains a velocity of seven knots. Upon this bank sandstone and conglomerate hills alternate in an unexpected manner, the former being of pyramidal form and the latter, though almost equally steep, exhibiting more rounded outlines. Immediately opposite Ichang is a striking isolated pyramidal hill, 600 feet high, its steepest side descending in an almost vertical cliff sheer into the deep water at its base. This picturesque but obtrusive object is a sad blow to the complacency of the good people of Ichang. It has the effect, so the geomancers say, of conveying the wealth of the place into the pockets of the strangers who come there and of\npreventing its accumulation in the hands of the poverty stricken natives. But a remedy has at last been found and thirty thousand taels have been collected wherewith to \"pu\" or \"supplement\" the deficient Fengshui. On the rise behind the town a three-storied temple, which promises to be an unique work of its kind, is being erected. Let us hope it will not have the effect of preventing any unfortunate stranger who may now go to tempt fortune in Ichang from attaining his desires!\n\nAfter spending two days at this retired spot, investigating the curious otter fisheries and enjoying the hospitality of the genial Commissioner of Customs, I proceeded on my voyage up the gorges proper. The first gorge commences 5 miles above Ichang and is known to foreigners as the Ichang gorge and to the Chinese as the \"Hsi-ling-hsia\" or Gorge of the Western Mountains. The reach here is in winter fully half a mile wide and doubtless was once much wider, the whole of the low land on the left bank being once probably under water when the aspect would have been even more lakelike than now, when in summer the width just below the gorge is little less than a mile. Expression seems to have been given to this condition in the district name of Ichang-fu which is \"Tung-hu-hsien\" or \"district of the Eastern Lake.\" Tracking up this reach along the left bank, no signs of the approaching gorge are witnessed and one would imagine oneself in a lake with high land on the left hand and in face (by which, of course, the mountains, through which the gorge is cleft, are hidden) and low, gently undulating country on the right. Suddenly we come to a split in the hill on the left and the entrance to the gorge is before us and we look down a narrow water alley with walls of limestone rising to pinnacles of 3,000 feet on either side. Through this gate, which is about 400 yards wide, the whole body of water from Szechuen and the country beyond pours forth into the lake-like expanse below. The contrast is inexpressibly grand. We\nsuddenly leave the brawling rapid and find a still, deep current without a ripple on its surface, flowing with majestic slowness through a bottomless chasm, and the gloom and the dead silence add immeasurably to the imposing grandeur of the scene. As one penetrates the gorge, which is about 10 miles long and which takes a sharp rectangular turn near its upper end, one has leisure to observe the fantastic outline of the mountain peaks which are composed of pure white limestone. The first entrance into the gorge produces an impression such as one experiences once in a lifetime.\nAPPENDICES\n\nTO THE\n\nJOURNAL OF THE CHINA BRANCH\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nFOR THE YEAR 1883.\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nLIST OF MEMBERS,\n\nCorrected up to 30th September 1884.\n\nHONORARY.\n\nHis Majesty Leopold II., King of the Belgians.\n\nAlcock, Sir Rutherford, K.C.B., London.\nHart, Sir Robert, K.C.M.G., Peking.\nLegge, Rev.

B. Drew, President.\nT. W. Kingsmill, F. Hirth, Ph. D. Vice-Presidents.\nE. Rocher, Hon. Sec. and Treasurer.\nLieut. G. von Kreitner, Hon. Librarian.\nF. W. Styan, Hon. Curator of Museum.\nG. James Morrison, Max. Sievogt, C. Deighton-Braysher, T. S. Southey, Councillors.\n\nThere has been no change in the staff of Office-Bearers during the year, excepting that Capt. von Kreitner on the 1st December 1884 resigned the office of Librarian, owing to his transfer to Yokohama. The vacancy has not since been filled.\n\nMeetings and Papers.\u2014Thirteen General Meetings of the Society were held during 1884, and the following papers\u2014thirteen in number\u2014were read:\n\n1.\u2014A Buddhist Sheet-tract, with an Apologue of Human Life, translated, with Notes, by the Right Rev. Bishop G. E. Moule of Hangchow; 22nd January.\n\n2.\u2014The Claims of the Chinese as the Inventors of Gunpowder and Fire-arms, by Dr. D. J. Macgowan of Wenchow; 14th March.\n3.\u2014Trade Routes in Western China, by Alex. Hosie, Esquire, of H.B.M.'s Consular service, Chungking, Szechuen; 25th March.\n\n4.\u2014A Journey in Chekiang\u2014First Part\u2014by E. H. Parker, Esquire, H.B.M.'s Acting Consul at Wenchow; 28th March.\n\n5.\u2014The ancient Trade Routes between China and the Roman Empire (Ta-tsin), by F. Hirth, Ph. D., of Shanghai; 4th April.\n\n6.\u2014At the meeting of 11th April, no paper was read.\n\n7.\u2014A Journey in Chekiang\u2014Second Part\u2014by E. H. Parker, Esquire; 16th April.\n\n8.\u2014Un Po\u00ebte Chinois du XVIII Si\u00e8cle, Yuan Tseu-tsin, sa Vie, et ses \u0152uvres, by C. Imbault-Huart, Vice-Consul of France; 20th October.\n\n9.\u2014A journey in Fukien,\u2014Wenchow to Foochow, near the sea coast, by E. H. Parker, Esquire; 27th October.\n\n10.\u2014A journey through Central Fukien,\u2014Foochow to Wenchow, by E. H. Parker, Esquire; 10th November.\n\n11.\u2014The Kaaba, or Great Shrine at Mecca, as described by Chinese,\u2014with notes on the old Arab Trade and remarks on Mahommedanism, by H. Kopsch, Esquire, Commissioner of Customs at Ningpo; 24th November.\n\n12.\u2014The Serica of Ptolemy and its Inhabitants, by T. W. Kingsmill; 2nd December.\n\n13.\u2014The Navigation of the S\u00f6ul River, Corea; by Capt. F. W. Schultze; and the Early Use of Telephones in China, by Dr. D. J. Macgowan; 15th December.\n\nMembership.\u2014During the year 8 new members have been added to the Society's roll; and the number of members on the 31st December 1884 was as follows:\u2014honorary 13, corresponding 28, and ordinary 120. The roll of a year previous (31st Dec. 1883) bore 14 honorary, 27 corresponding, and 138 ordinary members.\n\nThis falling off in membership means merely that the names of many persons have been removed from our list, who from long absence or other similar reasons have in point of fact ceased to be members, without actually resigning.\n\nThe Council regrets having to record the death of two members, viz.: Monsignor de la Place, and Mr. Geo. Carter Stent, both well\nknown to all students of subjects pertaining to China and the Chinese Language.\n\nFour members have resigned.\n\n**Lease to Shanghai Library.**\u2014On the 24th of December 1884 the Agreement between the Asiatic Society and the Shanghai Library was renewed, whereby the Asiatic Society engages to continue to let the East Wing of the Society's building to the Library for the 10 years, beginning 1st January 1883 and terminating on the 31st December 1892, at an annual rental of 100 Shanghai Taels. The deed, dated on the 24th December, was signed by Messrs. Drew, Kingsmill, and E. Rocher, as representatives of the Council, and by Messrs. P. J. Hughes and T. Latham for the Library.\n\n**Journals: Reprints.**\u2014Of the three early Journals which were to be reprinted, one has been published, viz: New Series V, 1868. A second (Old series, No. II May, 1859) is ready for distribution and sale: 450 copies have been prepared, at a total cost of \u00a3178.20. The third reprint has not yet been undertaken; but it has been found that it will cost \u00a3351.60 to reprint 450 copies. This journal contains a very large number of wood-cuts,\u2014hence its high cost.\n\n**Journal for 1883**\u2014The Journal for 1883, 226 pages, contains eight articles, besides Reports, Accounts, Lists of Members, Rules, and a List of Birds in the Shanghai Museum. The number of copies printed is 468 (not including 20 author's copies), and the cost is \u00a3482. It is ready for distribution and sale.\n\n**Journal for 1884.**\u2014The journal for 1884, First Part, about 130 pages is nearly ready for issue. It is to contain, besides Reports, Accounts, and the like, six articles. The first is entitled Animal, Fossil, Mineral and Vegetable Productions of the Ichang Consular District, by Consul C. T. Gardner. (This paper was not read before the Society, because its character was not considered to be of a kind suitable for reading.) Then follow the three articles by Mr. Parker descriptive of his journeys in Chekiang and Fukien, Bishop Moule's Description and Translation of a Buddhist Tract, and Mr. Hosie's paper on Trade Routes in Western China, all which articles were read before the Society in the Spring of 1884. Of this volume 500 copies will have been prepared, besides 20 author's copies.\nUnpublished Papers.\u2014The paper by Dr. Hirth entitled \"The ancient Trade Routes between Ta-ts'in and the Chinese Empire\" is not to be published in our journal, as it forms part of his study entitled \"China and the Roman Orient,\" which will shortly leave the press as an independent work. Respecting the remaining papers named at the beginning of this Report as having been read in 1884, it will be for the incoming Council to determine as to the publication of all or a portion of them as a Second Part in the Journal for 1884.\n\nShanghai Museum.\u2014The Council calls the attention of the Society to the work accomplished during the year in the Museum: many old specimens have been replaced by new, public attention has been called to the want of more specimens of birds, and this call has been well responded to; and new show cases are being put up. The location of the Museum, as is universally admitted, is not such as to attract the public to it: but the present time is not a favorable one for bringing forward proposals for any radical changes respecting this institution.\n\nSociety's Finances.\u2014As to the finances of the Society, the showing at this moment is not at first sight a very good one; but it need only be stated that the present want of a larger balance in the form of money is due to the fact that this balance is partly represented just now by an exceptional amount of books,\u2014i.e. the new Journals, and the Reprint, all as yet undistributed\u2014by the sale of which funds will soon be again realised. We have good reason to expect a remittance from Tr\u00fcbner & Co. in April for journals sold; and we are looking to a like settlement with M. Leroux, the Paris bookseller.\n\nSociety's Library.\u2014During the year 1884, but very few additions have been made to the Library; and the condition and requirements of this department ought, we think, to receive the special attention of the incoming Council. It is remarkable and no less a matter of regret, that our excellent library is so little used.\n\nWant of public interest in meetings.\u2014The fact is beyond question that little or no interest in our meetings is taken by the general public in Shanghai. During 1884 the meetings were held with\ngreat regularity, both in the Spring and Autumn sessions, and they were freely advertised. The effect of these measures was, however, only insignificant. The questions whether the Society ought or ought not to endeavour to attract the public to our meetings, and, if so, how this is to be brought about, are for the new Council to deal with.\n\nSubscriptions in arrear.\u2014The only remaining matter to be referred to is the difficulty of obtaining from many of our members the regular and prompt payment of their subscriptions.\n\nPossible usefulness of the Society.\u2014It is beyond question that the China Branch of the Asiatic Society is an institution which foreign residents in China could ill do without. But it is equally beyond question that the value of the Society is not at this moment sufficiently appreciated as a means and a stimulus to the study of Sinology.\nTreasurer's Report.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn submitting to you the accounts of the society for the year just ended, I have much pleasure in being able to report favorably on the financial condition of the Society.\n\nYou will see from the enclosed statement that on the 1st of January 1884 the Society was credited with the sum of Tls. 188.65, and that during the year the receipts amounted to Tls. 899.76, derived from Subscriptions, the sale of re-printed Journals and rent from the Shanghai Library.\n\nThough the income is more than last year, the Expenditures have been unusually heavy, amounting to Tls. 793.17. The cost of printing of journals for 1883-1884, wood-cuts, etc., amounted to Tls. 639.76. Out of this sum Tls. 429.51 have been paid, leaving a balance due of Tls. 210.25.\n\nYour treasurer regrets to say that the uncollected subscriptions amount to $475.00, and it is not anticipated that these arrears will bring more than about $250.00.\n\nAs regards the Museum, the income for last year including the liberal grants of the English and French Municipal Councils, amounted to Tls. 684.36 and the expenditures to Tls. 652.66, leaving a balance of Tls. 31.70 which has been carried to the new account. I am glad to say that the funds have admitted of two years' interest being paid on the Loan made by the Recreation Fund, thus leaving the interest due at date only two years in arrears.\n\nE.

B. M.'s Consul.\n\nI.\u2014ANIMAL PRODUCTS.\n\nThe Ichang Consular District produces few animal products. Some are valuable and might be increased:\n\nI.\u2014The Ateuchus or Tumble Dung beetle, used as medicine.\n\nII.\u2014Bones of Tiger.\u2014The Tiger is rarely found in this district. The bones are much valued by natives as medicine. The beast is welcomed here as it keeps down the number of wild pigs which are a great pest to the mountain farmers.\n\nIII.\u2014Cicada.\u2014The cast pupal shell of the Cicada is used as a medicine.\n\nIV.\u2014Furs of Leopards, the Golden Monkey, Fox, &c., are occasionally to be bought. A trade might be done in skins of Otters, which abound here, and are bred and domesticated for fishing purposes.\nIII.\u2014Barytes.\u2014150 miles S.W. of Consulate.\n\nIV.\u2014Calcareous Spar \u585e\u6c34\u77f3, Chang-yang.\u2014It is ground for making medicine.\n\nV.\u2014Coal.\u2014It would be more difficult to name hills in this Consular district where coal does not exist than where it does. It is only when the coal is exactly suited to the natives\u2019 requirements, or where the mine is favourably situated, that the coal is worked to any extent.\n\nThere is a light, greenish-coloured coal said to be of excellent quality produced in Siangyangfu on the Han River.\n\nIn many places the shafts are left open and coal extracted as people in the neighbourhood require it either as fuel or for burning lime.\n\nVI.\u2014Copper has been sent me from four places in Chang-lo, viz.: \u4e5d\u53f0\u5c71, \u694a\u5bb6\u53f0, \u5c0f\u6eaa, \u8def\u62b5\u6eaa. It doubtless exists elsewhere. The ore from \u4e5d\u53f0\u5c71 is said to yield 20 per cent of pure metal.\n\nVII.\u2014Gold must exist in the neighbourhood. During winter there is a little washing for gold dust below Chih keang, 45 miles S.E. of this; gold in bars is exported concealed about the person. The silver of Szechuan and Yunnan contains a certain percentage of gold, and there is an importation here, in native boats, of sulphuric acid to extract it. Further veins of quartz exist in the lime stone, some of which are said to be auriferous.\n\nVIII.\u2014Granite and Syenite exist about 20 miles up the river at Nanto, where they are chipped into mill stones, mortars, cattle troughs, &c.\n\nIX.\u2014Iron exists in various forms in this Consular district. I have found iron ore at Chingshuiwan, 95 miles S. by W. of the Consulate (near Chingshuiwan there are small smelting works). On the banks of the Yangtsze, 20 miles above the Consulate, I found iron ore under the granite boulders. At Itu, 30 miles below the Consulate, I found Iron Pyrites. I found iron ore and iron stone at Chin kangshan, about 20 miles N.W., and also at Nan chiehah, 40 miles N.E. of the Consulate. Mr. Ts\u00eang, a native engineer, found iron nodules at Hsiangchi, 50 miles above here, and red oxide of iron at Wantan, about 160 miles to the S.W. Iron exists almost all over the district. Iron cauldrons and rude agricultural implements are to a certain extent exported in native vessels.\nX.\u2014Lead and Lead Ore.\u2014I have obtained from three places in the Ichang Consular district:\n\nHsingshan .............. 70 miles N. by W.\nHof\u00eangchow ............150 ,, S. by W.\nChiutaishan ............160 ,, S.\n\nPlasters made of lead \u9632\u50e7 are produced in Hof\u00eangchow and are exported in native vessels.\n\nXI.\u2014Lime.\u2014Burning lime is a large industry here; all over the country there are large and small lime kilns.\n\nXII.\u2014Lime Stone is much used for foundations of houses and walls. In the quarries at Kwangmeushan on the Ching river, 10 miles above Itu, over 500 men are employed. At the quarries at Hoaitsze, some 18 miles above Ichang on the Yangtsze, over 100 men are employed. The rough stone costs at the quarries about two pence half penny per foot, and can be delivered at Ichang for three pence per foot.\n\nXIII.\u2014Marble is said by the Ichang gazetteer to exist at Hsiangchi. I have not seen any.\n\nXIV.\u2014Mercury is said to be found in small quantities, 95 miles S.E. of the Consulate near Shasze.\n\nXV.\u2014Oolite exists in many places.\n\nXVI.\u2014Rockeries.\u2014The water trickling over lime stone covers stalks and leaves of plants with a thick coating of lime and forms stones of curious shape, which are cut out and planted with ferns, cineraria, &c. About \u00a3350 worth of these rockeries are sent from this yearly by the steamer to Hankow.\n\nXVII.\u2014Saltpetre is found in caves in the lime stone; being contraband of trade it is only exported in native vessels.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Sandstone exists in a belt of country running west. It is not much quarried.\n\nXIX.\u2014Silver.\u2014The mines of this metal are principally situated in Yunnan, which belongs rather to the Chungking than to the Ichang Consular district. There is reported to be a silver mine at Hushui, about 100 miles N.E. of the Consulate.\n\nXX.\u2014Slate.\u2014Shaly slate is found running for miles under the red clay and white lime stone of the coal-producing hills. A solid slate is found at the top of the white lime stone cliffs of the Ichang gorge. At this spot\nmany of the houses of the natives are roofed with slate. There used to be quarries in the caves near for obtaining slate to make native ink palettes, but they have been recently closed for fear of the roof of the caves giving way.\n\nIV.\u2014PLANTS AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTS.\n\nThe following are the plants and vegetable substances produced in the Ichang Consular District as far as I have as yet been able to ascertain and identify them.\n\nMonsieur Fauvel, of H. I. M. Customs, has been kind enough to go over the list and to make some corrections.\n\nI.\u2014Acacia.\u2014The Acacia Concinna [Mimosa Saponaria Roxburgh] \u7682\u835a. This tree produces a reddish-tinged flower and a black seed from which soap is made; other kinds of Acacia (among which is the Acacia Ferox) grow in this district, but they are not as far as I know put to any use.\n\nII.\u2014Aconite \u8349\u70cf\u982d\u2014The roots of various Aconites are used as heroic remedies. I know of three varieties produced in this district:\n\n1. Aconitum Sinense \u8349\u70cf (monk's hood.)\n2. Aconitum Lycoctonum \u72fc\u6bd2 (wolf's bane.)\n3. Aconitum variegatum \u9999\u9644.\n\nIII.\u2014Acorus.\u2014One species \u83d6\u84b2 is used as a tonic, and the root of another \u9999\u6839\u8349 as a nutritive.\n\nIV.\u2014Adenophora verticillata \u6c99\u53c3.\u2014The root of this campunalaceous plant is supposed to have the restorative effects of ginseng.\n\nV.\u2014Ailanthus Glandulosa \u6ab5.\u2014The leaves of this plant are used as an astringent.\n\nVI.\u2014Alder \u67b3\u6728 is said to grow in the Chang-lo district.\n\nVII.\u2014Aloes Lign. (Aquilaria Agallocha Roxburgh) \u6c89\u9999\u6728 is said to grow in Hsing-shan.\n\nVIII.\u2014Amaranth \u91ce\u845b (Love lies bleeding) is eaten as a vegetable, as is also \u99ac\u9f52\u845b or \u9577\u547d\u83dc Amaranthus Oleraceus (goosefoot). Portulaca is also eaten. The root of the Amaranth pupalia geniculata \u725b\u819d is prescribed for rheumatism and syphilis. There is another variety of Amaranth here \u9ec3\u82b1\u845b or \u8349\u845b.\n\nIX.\u2014Amaryllis \u6148\u83c7.\u2014The native gazeteer classes this plant among fruit bearing shrubs.\nX.\u2014Amomum \u767d\u53ca.\u2014The paste made from this plant is used to cure wounds. The Rhizome of another variety of Amomum \u4e09\u4e03 is used as a restorative and sells for a high price.\n\nXI.\u2014Anchusa Tinctoria (Borage wort) \u7d2b\u8349.\u2014The root is used in small pox.\n\nXII.\u2014Andrographis paniculata \u9ec3\u9023.\u2014A drug made from this plant is given to new born infants.\n\nXIII.\u2014Angelica \u524d\u80e1.\u2014The root of the Archangelica Officinalis is given as a tonic, as is also the root of the \u72ec\u6d3b a plant very sensitive, perhaps a species of Angelica.\n\nXIV.\u2014Auisse \u516b\u89d2.\u2014The growth of this plant in this district is probably recent as it is not mentioned in the native gazetteer.\n\nXV.\u2014Apricot (Amygdalus).\u2014Four varieties grow in this district. The Silver, Golden, Sand and Plum Apricot \u674f.\n\nXVI.\u2014Aralia Palmata \u4e94\u52a0\u76ae.\u2014A tincture made from this plant is prescribed for rheumatism and syphilis.\n\nXVII.\u2014Arbor Vitae \u5927\u67cf.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Arbutus (Myrica Sapida) \u694a\u6885 Arrowroot.\u2014See Starch.\n\nXIX.\u2014Artemisia Abrotanum (Southern wood) \u8335\u9673\u84bf.\u2014A decoction from this is given for colds. The Artemisia Moxa (Mugwort) \u827e is used as a counter irritant. The Artemisia Dracunculus \u9752\u84bf (wormwood) in skin diseases, and the Artemisia Leonuris Sinensis in puerpeval fevers \u76c6\u6bcd\u8349.\n\nXX.\u2014Arums, Aroids and Aracious plants.\u2014The number of these in this district is considerable. I have identified the \u534a\u590f the Arisema triphyllum and Pythonium used as an anaesthetic, the \u5929\u5357\u661f Arum Pentaphyllum given in apoplexy the \u842c\u5e74\u9752 Arum ophioglossum, and the \u89c0\u97f3\u84ee Arum Lily.\n\nXXI.\u2014Ash.\u2014I fancy I have seen the Ash in Chang yang and Chang lo. They call it there \u67f3 a name given to the Tamarisk Tree.\n\nXXII.\u2014Ash Mountain \u6995\u68a8 (Grewia elastica).\u2014I fancy I have seen this plant, but Mons. Fauvel thinks I must have mistaken another plant for it.\n\nXXIII.\u2014Asparagus.\u2014A species of \u9f8d\u9b1a\u83dc.\n\nXXIV.\u2014Aster \u7c89\u5718.\nXXV.\u2014Atractyloides rubra \u8349\u6728 is used as a tonic.\u2014A lotion is also made from it for sore eyes.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Araucaria Imbricata?\u2014Identification doubtful.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Autumn tree (Catalpa Bungei) \u67ab\u6728\u2014Of the leaves of this tree a lotion is made for wounds.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014Azalea pontica and Azalea procumbens \u6620\u5c71\u9ec4 or \u9ec4\u675c\u9e43 and \u6620\u5c71\u7ea2 or \u7ea2\u675c\u9e43\n\nXXIX.\u2014Balsam (Impatiens Balsamina) \u51e4\u4ed9\u82b1 or \u6307\u7532\u82b1.\u2014The seeds are given to women in childbirth.\n\nXXX.\u2014Bamboo.\u2014Of the 60 kinds of Bamboos known to Chinese botanists, 20 grow in this Consular district:\n\n1. \u5357\u7af9 Southern or Giant Bamboo used for masts, water pipes, buckets, &c.\n\n2. \u7b14\u7af9 The kwei bamboo.

When Chang lo was governed by native chieftains, i.e., before A.D. 1740, this rice was sent to the emperor of China as tribute. It is still produced in the high valleys of Chang lo. I there saw it; the grain is whiter and longer than the ordinary Chinese rice.\n\nCCXXI.\u2014Rose.\u2014There are many varieties here such as \u73ab\u7470 Red rose, \u85b0\u9999 Cinnamon rose, \u6708\u5b63 Rosa Semperflorens, and \u6728\u9999 Dwarf rose, \u8336\u6a39, &c.\n\nCCXXII.\u2014Rottlera Japonica \u6a1f\u6728 grows in Patung, and has been called by travellers the \"China Birch.\"\n\nCCXXIII.\u2014Rouge Plant \u81a0\u8102\u82b1.\u2014This is a species of Carthamus; from it is made the Chinese rouge used as a cosmetic.\n\nCCXXIV.\u2014Ruppia Rostellata \u85cd.\n\nCCXXV.\u2014Safflower [Carthamus Tinctorius] \u7d05\u82b1 is exported from this place.\n\nCCXXVI.\u2014Sage [Salvia Plebeia] \u834a\u82a5.\u2014Used medicinally as a restorative.\n\nCCXXVII.\u2014Sandal wood [Santalum Album] \u6a80.\n\nCCXXVIII.\u2014Sedges.\u2014Several varieties exist here, \u4e00\u7c50\nCarex, Cyperus Esculentus, another Cyperus, Scirpus Scapularis, from the last lamp wicks are made.\n\nCCXXIX.\u2014Sesamum Indicum \u829d\u9ebb.\nCCXXX.\u2014Shallot [Allium Ascalonicum] \u85a4 or \u842c\u5b50\u982d.\nCCXXXI.\u2014Shancha [Crataegus Cuneata] \u5c71\u6942 or \u7334\u6942.\u2014A preserve prized by the Chinese is made from the fruit.\n\nCCXXXII.\u2014Shepherd's Purse [Capsella Bursa Pastoris] \u5730\u7c73\u83dc, \u8568\u83dc, or \u5e1d\u5bc6\u83dc is eaten as a vegetable here.\n\nCCXXXIII.\u2014Shoddy \u7dbf\u7d17.\u2014A fabric made here of a mixture of silk and cotton.\n\nCCXXXIV.\u2014Siegesbeckia Orientalis \u7a00\u8513.\u2014Used as an emetic.\n\nCCXXXV.\u2014Silene Saponaria \u738b\u4e0d\u7559\u884c.\u2014The seeds and shoots are made into medicine for wounds.\n\nCCYXXVI.\u2014Soap Tree [Gleditschia Sinensis] \u7682\u89d2.

In autumn the leaves are of a brilliant red, and as these trees are plentiful here, they add greatly to the beauty of the scenery. They are hardy plants, and grow from seed. They might, I think, be acclimatized in Cornwall, Devonshire and South Wales.\n\nCCXLIX.\u2014Tamarisk Tree [Tamarix Sinensis] \u67f3.\n\nCCL.\u2014Taro [Caladium] \u828b.\n\nCCLI.\u2014Tea is produced in small quantities all over this district. In many parts the peasants grow their own tea, as our peasants grow their own potatoes. Tea of a fine quality grows in the gorges of the Yangtsze and tributary rivers. There are large tea plantations in the Chang-lo district. A tea firing establishment was set up at Y\u00fc-yang-kwan \u6d41\u6d0b\u95dc (80 miles from this) to prepare this tea for the English market. A small quantity was sent to England and realized a good price, but the firing establishment did not pay and was moved to Ni-sha-ho \u6ce5\u6c99\u6cb3 just within the Hunan border. The tea is now sent to Hankow by way of the Tung-ting lake. The largest tea plantations of Chang-lo are at Nan-p'ing-ho \u5357\u5e73\u6cb3. A very fine tea is produced in Yunnan, called P'u-erh-ch'a \u666e\u6d31\u8336. It is not exported to England; it is made up into small bricks about half a pound each, and packed in baskets made of the leaves of the Bambusa Latifolia. Eight bricks go to the basket.\n\nIn Chang-lo, tea is carried in canvas bags placed in square crates which are attached to the porter's back by bamboo thongs, while in Kweichow the tea is packed in oval crates, lined with oak leaves, which are carried on a bamboo.\n\nCCLII.\u2014Thalictrum Rubellum \u5347\u9ebb.\u2014Given in female disorders.\n\nCCLIII.\u2014Timber.\u2014A large trade might be done in timber here, were it not for the obstacles placed in the way by the Chinese authorities. The reason alleged for dis-\ncouraging the trade is that the inhabitants of the forests are wild and lawless, and trade might lead to riots; perhaps the real reason is that they fear the country would be deforested. The taxes and cost of carriage for bringing down timber from places under forty miles distance add several hundred per cent to the prime cost. Forests with fine timber exist in Itu, Chang-lo, Chang-yang, Kwei-chow, Patung, and other places in this Consular district.\n\nCCLIV.\u2014Toad Flax.\n\nCCLV.\u2014Tobacco [Nicotiana Sinensis] is largely grown all over this district.\n\nCCLVI.\u2014Tournefortia Arguzina.\n\nCCLVII.\u2014Tricosanthes \u67b8\u675e\u6839 and \u5929\u82b1\u7c89.\u2014The powdered roots are given as a febrifuge.\n\nCCLVIII.\u2014T'ung Tree [Jatropha Curcis] \u6850\u6a39.\n\nCCLIX.\u2014Turmeric [a species of] \u675c\u82e5.\n\nCCLX.\u2014Turnip \u767d\u7f85\u8514.\u2014There is a medicine \u85af\u6839\u5b50 prepared here from turnip seeds.\n\nCCLXI.\u2014Uncaria Procumbens \u921e\u85e4.\u2014A wine somewhat resembling tincture of Catechu is made from this plant and is prescribed for infantile maladies.\n\nCCLXII.\u2014Valisneria is given by the Chinese the same name \u85fb as Mare's tail.\n\nCCLXIII.\u2014Varnish Tree [Rhus Succedanea] \u5973\u8c9e.\u2014Gallnuts are produced on this tree.\n\nCCLXIV.\u2014Vermicelli \u9eaa\u7c89.\u2014Bad and dear; made from wheat and barley.\n\nCCLXV.\u2014Vervain \u9999\u9700.\n\nCCLXVI.\u2014Vetch [Vicia Sativa] is given by the Chinese the same name \u7da0\u8c46 as the Phaseolus Angulatus.\n\nCCLXVII.\u2014Viburnum Opulus is given by the Chinese the same name \u96ea\u7403\u82b1 as the Hydrangea.\n\nCCLXVIII.\u2014Vipers Grass [Scorzonera] is given the same name \u83ca\u9580\u51ac as the Ancilema Commelynna Medica.\n\nCCLXIX.\u2014Violet; \u8cb4\u982d or \u7d2b\u91d1\u82b1, or \u7d2b\u834a\u82b1.\n\nCCLXX.\u2014Walnut Tree \u6838\u6843.\n\nCCLXXI.\u2014Water Caltrops [Trapa Bicornis] \u8c46.\n\nCCLXXII.\u2014Water Chestnut [Scirpus Eleocharis Tuberosus] \u8377\u8449, or \u8377\u82b1.\n\nCCLXXIII.\u2014Water Lily.\u2014Of the Nelumbium Speciosum there are two varieties used as food, the \u85d5 and the\nAnother species of Water Lily [Euryale Ferox] is used as a tonic and astringent.\n\nCCLXXIV.\u2014Water Shield [Hydropeltis] \u85cd.\n\nCCLXXV.\u2014Wax Tree [Ligustrum Lucidum] \u8721\u6a39 and Ligustrum Japonicum Obtusifolium \u51ac\u9752 or \u842c\u5e74\u679d. \u2014It is on these trees that the insect, belonging to the Fulgorida family of the Homoptera, which produces white wax feeds.\n\nCCLXXVI.\u2014Wheat \u5c0f\u9ea5.\n\nCCLXXVII.\u2014Whin [Ulex] \u91d1\u96c0\u82b1.\n\nCCLXXVIII.\u2014Willow [Salix Alba and Salix Pendandra] \u6953.\n\nCCLXXIX.\u2014Wine made from Indian corn.\n\nCCLXXX.\u2014Yam [Dioscorea Sativa] \u5c71\u85e5.\n\nCCLXXXI.\u2014Yarn Cotton.\n\nCCLXXXII.\u2014Yew \u7fe0\u67cf and the Dwarf Yew [Podocarpus Thuja] \u7f85\u6f22\u677e.\u2014Besides these there are 92 plants or varieties of plants mentioned in the Chinese Gazetteer of the Ichang prefecture which I have not been able to identify.\nON the 11th November, 1889, I started from W\u00eanchow, with tide and wind in my favour, upon a visit to Hangchow, by way of Ch\u2019u-chou, Yen-chou, and Kin-hwa Prefectures. There had been no rain to speak of for six weeks previous to the 9th of November, on which and the following days the weather was wet and gloomy; but it cleared up on the 11th, and thus my boats had the advantage of the recent rain in shallow places, whilst I had the immediate personal benefit of the sun; so that the start was in every way of good augury. The river for ninety miles takes a zig-zag course alternately West and North. At the town of Y\u00fce-ch\u2019i \u6e29\u6eaa (W\u00ean-ch\u2019i), 30 miles from W\u00eanchow, it entirely changes its characteristics, and, from a comparatively deep, muddy river, changes to a clear, shingly bottomed, but still broad stream, impeded as regards navigation by a succession of shallow rapids. The wind was so favourable that the boatmen of their own accord sailed on late into the night, in consequence of which we reached a suitable mooring nook two miles below the city of Ts\u2019ing-t\u2019ien \u9752\u7530 in nine hours, doing nearly 40 miles in all. I heard the boatmen several times make use of the expression \u201ccarry\u201d over the rapids, and was somewhat puzzled to imagine how that could be done with a boat 40 feet long, and capable of carrying 10 tons of cargo at least. A yoke of bamboo is fastened across the bows of the boat, and two of the three boatmen jump into the water: placing the ends of the yoke across their necks, they thus guide the boat up the rapids, any other available hands meanwhile poling vigorously with the pikes. There is very little level land to be seen between W\u00eanchow and Ts\u2019ing-\n\n* Read before the Society on the 28th March and 16th April, 1884.\nt'ien, or even Ch'u-chow; the river is enclosed on either side by hills ranging up to 1,000 feet high, with occasional spits or valleys of flat land between them. The general aspect of the scenery is not unlike that of the Foochow River, but terrace cultivation of the hills here is not so general, probably on account of their more precipitous nature. Only paddy land is taxable. The rapids are caused by the river running across broad shingly beds, and through them finding its way to the lowest levels; they resemble very much the rapids of the Ho-chou River, which runs from the Shen-si frontier down to Ch'ung-k'ing; but the water being usually shallow here, they can hardly be called in any way dangerous. There seems to be almost everything necessary provided by nature to encourage the development of foreign trade as far as Ch'u-chow; for the cost of boat-carriage is exceedingly low (say one shilling and six-pence a day for a good-sized barge manned by three men), and our own experience shows that, with a fair wind, Ts'ing-t'ien can be reached in a single afternoon. Travellers must content themselves with the rudest of flat-bottomed barges, protected from the weather by nothing but a strong coarse mat-housing, which, however, is tolerably waterproof; there is nothing available at all resembling the comparatively luxurious travelling boats of the Canton and Yangtsze Rivers. Ts'ing-t'ien is a picturesquely situated district city, subordinate to the Ch'u-chow Prefecture, and is built on a small area of slightly elevated ground, occupying the corner of a sand-bank between the hills. From its position it commands the river approaches in all directions, and of course the most prominent edifice is the Lekin Station, a sort of elevated watch-tower sweeping the river. A gunboat lies below, so that the chances of running the barrier successfully are reduced to a minimum. Here are levied dues on the timber rafts, bamboo wares, and fuel which come down the river, and on imports, especially salt, from Wenchow. There is a very pretty glen about 75 miles above Ts'ing-t'ien, called Shih-m\u00ean Tung or \"Stone Gate Hollow.\" Part of the waterfall, of a type much resembling the average Scotch or Norwegian foss, can be seen from the river, and a quarter of a mile's walk brings the visitor to the foot of the fall, where are to be seen numerous tablets and inscriptions commemorating\nthe visits of distinguished persons. The most prominent amongst the trees observable on the way from Wenchow to Ch'u-chow are the \"feathery\" bamboos, the fir, the vegetable tallow tree, (here called Chung-tsz and la-tsz or \"wax berry\"), the camphor tree, (from which camphor is not here extracted), and occasionally the wood-oil tree. The banks present the same style of scenery all the way up, but above Ts'ing-t'ien the shingle beds are pleasantly relieved by turf, in places almost as smooth as an English lawn. The dialects of Ts'ing-t'ien and Ch'u-chow differ from that of Wenchow about as much as the broad Hunan dialects differ from ordinary Kwan-hwa. The dialect of Wenchow is the broadest, and the divergencies of the Ts'ing-t'ien or Ch'u-chow dialects are generally nearer approaches to the standard sounds. There seemed to be very little valuable cargo upon the river. Most of the upward-bound boats carried a very large package of salt, of the fine or local Wenchow manufacture. The Foochow salt, which costs four cash a catty at Wenchow, is loosely stowed in larger boats, and after being washed and ground down at Ch'u-chow, circulates in the Prefecture at about 10 to 12 cash. The downward craft seemed to be usually laden with firewood, charcoal, bamboo-wares, and other homely articles. Should this part of China ever become freely open to foreign trade, the way to utilize this river to the best advantage would be to construct light-draught steam-launches, with sufficient power to draw, each, half a dozen flat-bottomed junks, carrying, say, ten tons apiece. At this time of the year, when the autumn rice, (of which there has been an unusually plentiful crop), is all gathered in, there is nothing much to be seen in the way of cereals. The boatmen said, however, that the poppy is on the increase in Li-shui \u9e97\u6c34 (Ch'u-chow central) and Ts'ing-t'ien districts, as well as around Wenchow, and that the price of wheat (the once usual winter crop) has gone up in consequence. The young wheat, I noticed, was just appearing above the ground in many places.\n\nThe fifty miles from Ts'ing-t'ien to Hia-ho \u4e0b\u6cb3, a mile below Ch'u-chow, occupied us four days, the weather being wet, and the rapids strong. There is no place of any importance on the way, unless the village of Hai-k'ou \u6d77\u53e3 thirty miles above Ts'ing-t'ien, deserves to be singled out for mention as a larger village than the others.\nThere is river communication between the mountain district of King-ning \u666f\u5be7 (Ch'iu-chow Prefecture) and Ts'ing-t'ien by a river, locally called the \"Small Stream,\" which joins the Wenchow river a mile or two above Ts'ing-t'ien. Hia-ho is the point of departure from Wenchow and Ch'iu-chow for the Kin-hwa and Hangchow Prefectures, etc. On the afternoon of my arrival, I took a walk to and through the city of Ch'iu-chow Fu and back. Though the examinations were going on, I passed along almost unnoticed, and the people I addressed were all very civil. A good deal of Kwan-hwa or Official Chinese is spoken here, as at Wenchow. The city is prettily situated on a spit formed by a bend in the river, which winds round the southern end of a small plain bounded on the other three sides by a range of hills.\n\nThe walls enclose an elevation surmounted by a showy temple. The interior of the city is a miserable collection of ruins and shanties, and there seems to be only one busy street or centre. The Yamens are in the usual dilapidated condition. The circuit of the walls is three miles.\n\nThe porter and chair-bearer organization at Hia-ho appears to be excellently managed, and though I only gave notice of my intended departure after dark, I was on the road by nine o'clock next morning, with a written contract in my pocket, an official guild list of bearers' names, and an escort of police and soldiers.\n\nWe cut across the plain in a northerly direction for about five miles, and then commenced an ascent in the same direction for a second five miles to Yin-ch'ang T'ang \u9280\u5834\u5858 (Niang Dziao Doa), where we refreshed ourselves. Continuing our ascent for another six miles, by a good road paved with round stones, we reached a height of 2,000 feet, and put up for the night at K'ioh-king Kwan \u5374\u666f\u9928. The bearers were a dissolute-looking but good-humoured crew, and appeared anxious to give information. They were all very well posted in opium matters, and declared with one voice that Malwa (hsiau-t'u) was almost the only kind of opium smoked, by those who could in any way afford it, in the prefectural neighbourhood. The better quality costs a dollar for 2.4 Chinese ounces, and the inferior quality a dollar for 2.6 ounces. It all comes from Lan-ch'i and Hangchow,\u2014that is, from Ningpo. There are several porters\nregularly employed in conveying this opium from Lan-ch'i.\n\nThe local poppy has been grown during the past five years in several of the ten districts under Ch'u-chow, but in Ts'ing-t'ien and Tsin-y\u00fcn more especially. In Li-shui and the more western districts it does not appear to have been so successful, as the people are said to be unskilled in lancing the capsule.\n\nThe crops in the ground in the plain were buckwheat, \"hairy\" beans (just being gathered), excellent cabbages, and occasional patches of tobacco, hemp, mustard, brinjals, peanuts, flax, etc. The maize and rice had been harvested. The mountain-road passed through scenery of the same kind as that enclosing the river we had ascended. By far the commonest tree was the tallow tree, and beyond this, with the bamboo, coir, fir, and pine, other trees were exceptional. All the villages were small, but the people, though poor-looking, were uniformly civil; in fact, I have never yet been in any part of China where less hostility was shown in the bearing of the people. No coal is burnt at Ch'u-chow, and I saw nothing and heard little of iron, which, however, is undoubtedly smelted at Ts'ing-t'ien and Y\u00fcn-ho districts.\n\nThere is river communication for rafts with Tsin-y\u00fcn district city by a river which joins the Wenchow River, two miles below Ch'u-chow.\n\nOn the second day of our journey across the T'ao-hwa range, we again travelled 50 li, or sixteen miles, our highest point being at T'ao-hwa Tung, or \"Peach-flower Gap,\" 2,600 feet above Ch'u-chow. I estimated the height of the river at the last-named place at not more than 100 feet above the sea. There are villages with passable accommodation for man (but not beast, for there are none) every three miles across the pass, and sometimes oftener. The mountain scenery is decidedly fine, but hardly to be called grand. The river at the unwalled district city of Tsin-y\u00fcn is, according to the aneroid barometer, 600 feet higher than where it joins the Wenchow River, but, as the rapids are stated to be very \"fierce,\" and no boats can navigate the stream, whilst the timber rafts for which it is available of course only descend, these 600 feet in 33 miles may be satisfactorily accounted for, always assuming that meteoro-\nThere is river communication between the mountain district of King-ning (Chu-chow Prefecture) and Ts'ing-tien by a river, locally called the \"Small Stream,\" which joins the Wenchow river a mile or two above Ts'ing-tien. Hia-ho is the point of departure from Wenchow and Chu-chow for the Kwan-hwa and Hangchow Prefectures, etc. On the afternoon of my arrival, I took a walk to and through the city of Chu-chow Fu and back. Though the examinations were going on, I passed along almost unnoticed, and the people I addressed were all very civil. A good deal of Kwan-hwa or Official Chinese is spoken here, as at Wenchow. The city is prettily situated on a spit formed by a bend in the river, which winds round the southern end of a small plain bounded on the other three sides by a range of hills.\n\nThe walls enclose an elevation surmounted by a showy temple. The interior of the city is a miserable collection of ruins and shanties, and there seems to be only one busy street or centre. The Yamen are in the usual dilapidated condition. The circuit of the walls is three miles.\n\nThe porter and chair-bearer organization at Hia-ho appears to be excellently managed, and though I only gave notice of my intended departure after dark, I was on the road by nine o'clock next morning, with a written contract in my pocket, an official guild list of bearers' names, and an escort of police and soldiers.\n\nWe cut across the plain in a northerly direction for about five miles, and then commenced an ascent in the same direction for a second five miles to Yin-ch'ang T'ang (Niang Dziao Doa), where we refreshed ourselves. Continuing our ascent for another six miles, by a good road paved with round stones, we reached a height of 2,000 feet, and put up for the night at K'ioh-king Kwan (K'ioh-king). The bearers were a dissolute-looking but good-humoured crew, and appeared anxious to give information. They were all very well posted in opium matters, and declared with one voice that Malwa (hsiao-t'u) was almost the only kind of opium smoked, by those who could in any way afford it, in the prefectural neighbourhood. The better quality costs a dollar for 2.4 Chinese ounces, and the inferior quality a dollar for 2.6 ounces. It all comes from Lan-chi and Hangchow,\u2014that is, from Ningpo. There are several porters\nlogical changes have not again disturbed barometrical calculations, as they did on the river.\n\nThe Taipings seem to have made great havoc with this neighbourhood, and possibly the rickety aspect of everything means only that recovery is yet incomplete. Near the junction of the Li-shui and Tsin-y\u00fcn districts, on the south side of the Peach-flower Gap, there is a mountain tomb, where are promiscuously collected the bones of rebels and slaughtered innocents alike which were found lying unidentified around the spot. Prayers are offered at the grave thrice a year.\n\nThe Ch'\u00fc-chow Prefecture appears to supply itself with tobacco and tea, of which latter article, and tallow, it exports a certain quantity. The Ts'ing-t'ien tea is the best. Tobacco is also imported from Fu-kien; and cotton, of which the local supply is insufficient, from T'ai-chow Fu. Silk is produced, but not so as to form an industry, and supplements are imported from Hangchow. I doubt, however, if many people can afford this luxury. Bees' wax is produced, and used for greasing shoe-thread,\u2014a hawker showed me a cake; and I bought excellent honey at Tsin-y\u00fcn. The people eat a good deal of the sweet potato, and make a sort of cheap \"bean\"-curd out of the wild chestnut.\n\nThe wayfarers corroborated the statement that no tax was paid on land other than wet, levelled, or paddy-lands, and gave as a reason that Liu P\u00e8-w\u00ean \u5289\u4f2f\u6eab (one of the worthies whose reminiscences we saw at the Stone Gate waterfall), had begged the Ming Emperor Hung Wu to remit it in perpetuity. This Liu, known as Kwoh-shih, or Kuin-shih, \u570b\u6216\u8ecd\u5e2b, appears to bear the same sort of repute here, as the local hero of antiquity, that the famous Chu-ko Liang \u8af8\u845b\u4eae does in Eastern Sz-ch'uen.\n\nCh'\u00fc-chow is the seat of a Brigadier, who has under him 1,200 soldiers, garrison and active. There are no \"braves,\" or fighting soldiers. It appears to be the custom of respectable small landowners to become garrison soldiers, and even to buy the position, for the sake of the pay\u2014but to arrange for substitutes in the rare event of being called out for active service.\n\nThe 25 miles from Tsin-y\u00fcn district,\u2014the water-shed of several rivers,\u2014to Yung-k'ang \u6c38\u5eb7 district city were over an almost level plain, very richly cultivated and watered\nby a river which rises somewhere in the Tsin-y\u00fcn district: it is navigable for small boats from Yung-k'ang down to Kin-hwa Fu, and there for good-sized junks to Hang-chow.\n\nThe chief productions of Tsin-y\u00fcn are tea, coir, and indigo, of which last we saw numerous pits and dyeing establishments. The rice crop had been plentiful this year, and rice was selling for a penny a pound. Cotton, silk, and opium are grown, but not in sufficient quantity for local requirements. We met cotton and lampwick grass coming overland from T'ai-chow \u53f0\u5dde, and large quantities of native cotton cloth from Y\u00fc-yao \u9918\u59da district, near Ningpo. Iron-wares are obtained from Y\u00fcn-ho district, and salt via Ch'u-chow. Malwa is smoked by all opium smokers who can afford it: it all comes via Lan-ch'i, and its prices are slightly lower than at Ch'u-chow. Native opium is also imported from T'ai-chow. The land-tax collected is over Tls. 20,000, and for this purpose the people are made to pay in large cash at 2,480 the tael, the market rate being 1,800 cash the tael, or 1,150 the dollar. The unit of land measurement is 10, which means $\\frac{1}{10}$, i.e. 10 fathoms or $\\frac{1}{24}$ part of a mu of land,\u2014one mu being $\\frac{1}{6}$ acre. The statement about the freedom of certain places from tax on Ti \u5730 or non-paddy land was qualified by the assertion that the exemption was confined to the district of Ts'ing-tien.\n\nThe city of Tsin-y\u00fcn is a mere village of 1,200 houses, hemmed in at each end of the gulley in which it is situated by gates, and two morsels of wall, 100 yards long. It has two very fine stone bridges of nine and thirteen arches respectively, crossing the river at the south end of the town;\u2014the river which communicates with Ch'u-chow, and takes its rise near the town of Hu-ch\u00ean in the Tsin-y\u00fcn district, 60 li to the east. It has also a smaller stone bridge at the north side, spanning the stream which runs down to Yung-k'ang. There are villages every ten miles, between Tsin-y\u00fcn and Yung-k'ang, and they grow more considerable as the latter city is approached. Tsin-y\u00fcn is said to have been terribly ravaged by the Taipings, and since the anarchy the people have become less tractable; but I saw no sign of hostility or sullenness anywhere. I found the dialects of Ch'u-chow and Tsin-y\u00fcn sufficiently near that of Wenchow to enable me to follow tolerably well the conversation of\nthe bearers and villagers, and to make myself understood in cases where Kwan-hwa was unintelligible to them.\n\nHu-ch\u00ean is 60 li or 20 miles east of both Tsin-y\u00fcn and Yung-k'ang; it is thence 80 li to P'an-t'an-ch\u00ean \u5883\u7e23, which communicates by river with T'ai-chow, by way of Sien-ch\u00fc \u5c71\u5c45 district city. Tsin-y\u00fcn is distant 150 li by mountain-road from Ts'ing-t'ien.\n\nYung-k'ang is a wall-less district city under the Kin-hwa \u91d1\u83ef Prefecture. It was occupied for several years by the rebels, who utterly destroyed it. At present it consists of about 2,000 houses, many of which have a well-to-do aspect. It is distant from the prefectural city 40 miles by land, or 50 by water. Agriculturally, the district has fairly recovered from the effects of the rebellion, which carried off about 70 per cent of the population, but as yet its commerce and productivity go no further than supplying local wants. Exactly the same account of opium was given as at Ch'u-chow and Tsin-y\u00fcn. Malwa and T'ai-chow are both smoked, and a little is grown locally. The district supplies itself with grain, tea, and tobacco; imports salt from T'ai-chow and Ch'u-chow, and native and foreign piece goods via Lan-ch'i. Its land tax is considerable, and 2,300 and 1,700 large cash respectively are the official and business values of the tael. The clean dollar, which is current throughout Ch\u00eakiang, is worth 1,130 cash. As at Tsin-y\u00fcn, the popular unit of land measurement is 10.\n\nA very striking feature in Yung-k'ang is its two bridges; one, a short one of three spans, is entirely built over with houses; the other, built on eleven strong stone piers, is about 200 yards long, and is roofed in and battened in on both sides with palings which give it a most unusual and picturesque aspect. I was told that inside it is provided with stalls for the use of hawkers and bamboo merchants, and that all the bridges in Ch'u-chow prefecture to the south-west were built on the same principle.\n\nThe Yung-k'ang river takes a tortuous but due westerly course for 150 li to Kin-hwa Fu. To the south is a well-wooded range of hills, but to the north and west the country is more undulating and level. The willow, (hitherto rarely seen since leaving Wenchow), and fir line its grassy banks, and cover the country in great profusion, and, with the\nautumn-red tints of the tallow-tree, give a singularly warm and park-like aspect to the neighbourhood. The river is shallow, and frequently unnavigable for anything but bamboo rafts; it is beset with harmless rapids, and after heavy rain runs very swiftly. There were great numbers of geese, duck, teal, wild cormorants, herons, and other waterfowl to be seen at every moment, and a sportsman would doubtless have pleasant experiences here. The same story was everywhere told about the Taipings; everyone had suffered in some way; had either been forced to labour, beaten, or kidnapped; had had his house burnt; his relations killed; or had seen his family starve to death.\n\nT'ung-k'in \u92fc\u7434 is a considerable village on the left bank, six miles from Yung-k'ang under the joint jurisdiction, or on the joint borders of Yung-k'ang and Wu-i \u6b66\u7fa9 districts. Thence it is 10 miles by land to Wu-i district-city, which the river passes to the west at Ting-siang, a distance of two miles, and with which it communicates by a branch stream navigable for rafts and small boats up to the city. Immense rafts of pine are floated down from Wu-i to Lan-ch'i and Hangchow. Wu-i, which I could not see from the river, is said to be a walled city, smaller than Yung-k'ang, with no particular industry, having, as usual here, suffered much at the hands of the rebels.\n\nThe boundary between Wu-i and Kin-hwa districts, (the latter the head prefectural district of Kin-hwa Fu), lies 10 miles further down at a place called Ts'iao-ngan \u7464\u5ca9. The river abounds with rapids and wild-fowl, and runs through a richly-wooded hilly country. In many places the current is guided by weirs thrown across the stream, into a narrow channel just large enough to admit one boat or raft. The rafts are often 200 yards long, but never more than 12 feet wide, and are so constructed that they can be divided or moored at any joint, and turned by long bow or stern sweeps in any direction. The boatmen said that there was plenty of opium grown in Wu-i, and that natives of T'ai-chow (the great opium-producing region) were usually engaged to manage the crop. Sugar of the red kind is produced in both Yung-k'ang and Wu-i, but the grey cane so common in Kiangnan is not found south-west of Lan-ch'i. All the raftmen and boatmen whom I addressed spoke excellent \"southern\" Kwan-hwa, but they conversed with each other\nin a local dialect akin to those of south Ch\u00eakiang; but at last differing so much that both my servants and myself had to abandon the latter, except every now and then where an uncommon word had to be uttered in the two extremes in order to arrive at an uncertain mean. Salt from T'ai-chow at Wu-i costs from 24 to 30 cash the catty, six times the price of salt at Wenchow. As far as I could follow the tortuous course of the river, it trends rather northerly than westerly after entering the Kin-hwa district. Raft cargoes of cotton from Shao-ling by way of Siao-shan \u856d\u5c71 and I-ch'iao; also brine blocks (for bean curd) or the curdled lees of salt from Hangchow; piece goods from Y\u00fc-yao; grain for wine manufacture, &c., were met as we advanced. I tasted excellent wine of local distillation at various of the districts through which I passed.\n\nKin-hwa Fu is a finely situated city approached from the south by a venerable and lofty sandstone bridge of fifteen arches, which, for solidity and graceful construction, might compare not altogether unfavourably with the London bridges. In style it is precisely like the Roman bridges, such as one still sees in certain Spanish and French towns. I failed to gather the history of this monument, which must be interesting, but the fact that its construction is popularly ascribed to genii vouches for its age. The interior of the city was not much damaged during the rebel occupation, but the suburbs were destroyed, partly by the inhabitants themselves, in order to have a clear range from the walls; yet the exterior of the town has not been much rebuilt. Kin-hwa is celebrated all over the empire for its hams, fermented eggs, bean-curd, and sauce. I was told that it also produces ginseng for the Court. The only taxing-station in the prefecture appears to be at Lan-ch'i, where there are three stations guarding the exits and entrances of the trifurcated river.\n\nThe 20 miles by water, (50 li by land), almost due west from Kin-hwa to Lan-ch'i, lie through a rather flat and not very visible country. A branch river runs south-west to Kin-hwa from I-wu \u7fa9\u70cf and Tung-yang \u6771\u967d, which two districts, like Wu-i, send down quantities of indigo and lumber to the great mart of Lan-ch'i. A small river, available for rafts, also runs south to parts of T'ang-ch'i \u6e6f\u6eaa district, from a point half way between Kin-hwa and Lan-ch'i.\nI managed to solve here the knotty question of land measurement, which is after all simply a question of words. A *pa* or \"span\" is simply the local word for the tenth of a *kung* or \"fathom\" of 5.6 to 5.8 Chinese feet. Sixty \"hundreds\" (*i.e.* six thousand *pa*) make $2\\frac{1}{2}$ *mu*, or half an acre, *i.e.* twenty four \"hundreds\" make one *mu*. But at Wenchow the *mu* consists of 24 *kung*. Hence it is evident that the *pa* is $\\frac{1}{70}$ of a fathom. In Wenchow the common tenures take 5.8 Chinese feet to the fathom, whilst reclaimed shore-lands take but 5.6.\n\nSouth-east of Kin-hwa, at a distance of eight or ten miles, the Fowl's-claw Hill \u96de\u722a\u5c71 stands out prominently as a landmark, and enables one to fix the bearings of I-wu, Yung-k'ang, and Wu-i, which are respectively about north-east, south-west by west, and south-west of Kin-hwa. I-wu is distant by land 160 li from Yung-k'ang.\n\nThe great mart of Lan-ch'i, the Ch'ung-k'ing of Chekiang, both as to size, situation, and wealth, is the true key to the trade of the province. The city was utterly destroyed by the rebels, who wreaked their vengeance on this town and Yung-k'ang more especially on account of the resistance offered. Large junks are first seen at Kin-hwa, to which place and Lan-ch'i the produce of T'ang-ch'i, Tung-yang and the other districts just named is brought down on rafts or in boats. The prefecture of K'\u00fc-chow sends immense quantities of paper, grain, indigo, lumber, bamboos, &c., down to Lan-ch'i; in good sized boats from Ch'ang-shan \u5e38\u5c71, Lung-yu \u9f8d\u6e38, and Kiang-shan \u6c5f\u5c71, or in rafts from K'ai-hwa \u958b\u5316, whence there is land communication with Hwei-chow \u5fbd\u5dde Fu in An-hwei province. It is a significant fact that elsewhere in Kin-hwa Fu there are no tax-stations; hence it is, probably, that the Lan-ch'i traders, who import by excellent water routes from Hangchow and Ningpo, are enabled to sell to the Ch'u-chow prefecture so cheaply as to check the development of Wenchow. In any case, the T'ao-hwa range is sufficient to confine the sphere of Wenchow's trading ventures, as far as Chekiang is concerned, to the two prefectures of Wenchow and Ch'u-chow. The pawn-shops and banks at Lan-ch'i are chiefly in the hands of An-hwei men, the \"foreign goods\" and native cloth shops are kept by Shao-hing men; the sugar, dates, fruit, and \"south goods\" trade\nis in the hands of Fukien men; the pottery in those of traders from Kiangsi. The salt consumed at Lan-ch'i comes via I-k'iao from Shao-hing, and sells at 30 cash, or, further up at K'\u00fc-chow \u8862\u5dde, for about 35 cash. Lung-yu is 90 li distant from both Lan-ch'i and K'\u00fc-chow Fu, which is 90 li from Ch'ang-shan, distant again from its subordinate town Hwa-pu \u534e\u57e0 60 li.\n\nLan-ch'i seems to have quite recovered from the effects of the rebel devastation. I walked through the chief street, and was greatly struck by the solid aspect of everything around me. I also walked along part of the wall, and down several cross streets; everywhere the town seemed to be rebuilt or rebuilding. I noticed here the poles of the telegraph line between Hangchow and Foochow. As at Ts'ing-t'ien, Ch'u-chow, and, in fact, nearly all Chinese towns, a pagoda stands at the corner hill which one must fetch in approaching the town. A pagoda may be said to have something like the same effect in regard to the rank of a Chinese town that a Russian church has in distinguishing a selo from a derevnya,\u2014a parish-town from a market village.\n\nIn leaving Lan-ch'i and taking a northerly direction we have on our right the range of hills which shelter Kin-hwa on the north; the K'\u00fc-chow prefecture is, I am told, comparatively level. There is from this point a marked difference in the aspect of the hills, which now become thinly wooded, and account for the large lumber export from the west. The boundary between Lan-ch'i district and Kien-t\u00ea \u5efa\u5fb7, the prefctural district of Yen-chow \u5ef6\u5dde Fu, is at Shang-ho, a village 50 li distant from Lan-ch'i, and 40 from Yen-chow. This and other villages passed have a well-built and comfortable appearance. After entering the Kien-t\u00ea district, the left bank becomes mountainous, and the river is once more enclosed between hills.\n\nThe opening of W\u00eanchow has greatly interfered with the revival of Lan-ch'i. The small steamer Yungning carries 800 tons of cargo and 100 passengers, both ways, thrice a month. Taking 10 tons as an average junk cargo, she may be said to divert from Lan-ch'i thirty junks. But as a junk would not make its average round voyage westward under a month, she may be said to divert the trade of 90 or\n100 cargo junks, and the same number of passenger junks. The largest cargo junks on this river can carry 300 tui \u514b or 900 peculs, say 50 tons, but this is only when the water is at its greatest flood height, during three or four uncertain months (usually spring) out of the twelve.\n\nYen-chow Fu is a well-situated town on the left bank of the river which communicates to the west with Hwei-chow Fu in An-hwei; it is also on the left bank of the Hangchow river, but a mile to the west. The distance by land to the great An-hwei mart of T'\u00ean-ch'i \u96fb\u6eaa is 400 li by land, or 500 by water, and the land distances are 160 li to Shun-an \u6e58\u5b89 district-city, 60 to Wei-p'ing \u5a01\u576a, 20 to the frontier Kai-k'ow, 50 to Sing-tu \u8056\u6e21, 50 to Hwei-chow, and 50 to T'\u00ean-ch'i. The Sui-an \u9042\u5b89 and Shou-ch'ang \u5bff\u660c rivers are navigable for rafts only.\n\nMy escort being several days behind me, preparing despatches, &c., I took the prefectural city by surprise, and walked round part of the wall, up the main street, and round to a second gate. There are no foreigners in this part of Ch\u00ea-kiang, and probably few have ever appeared in this city dressed in western clothes; at any rate, my advent created some sensation, but not a single hostile word was uttered within my hearing, though I was unattended by anyone but my own servants in unofficial dress, and though the people had not the remotest idea who or what I was. The area of the city is three parts in ruins, having been razed to the ground by the rebels; the business quarter at and near the Great South Gate, and the main street are well built and prosperous looking. I should estimate that there were 3,000 or 4,000 houses in the town, not counting the \"villages\" and farms, dotted about amongst the ruins and sheets of water. I believe the minimum circumference of a Fu city is fixed by law at 10 li, or 3 miles, so that the vacant spaces often met with in them are by no means conclusive evidence of decay.\n\nThe exports from the interior districts to Yen-chow are bees' wax from Sui-an, and indigo, lumber, and paper, from the same and the other districts. The prefecture is said by the boatmen to be hilly throughout.\n\nAt Yen-chow, I was told at the Kin-hwa guild that there were, besides, Kiangsi, Hwei-chow, Fukien, and Shao-hing guilds in the city. Malwa opium was quoted at\n2.4 oz. the dollar, but the city practices adulteration (ch'ung) of the drug for interior consumption. Pistachio nuts are extensively produced in the Kien-t\u00ea (prefectural) district, and the Ts'ih-li Lung region yields lime, charcoal, fuel, and excellent Samlai fish.\n\nThere is no terrace cultivation of the rocky hills from Lan-ch'i northwards; they are covered with small brushwood, and have the appearance of having been stripped of their timber.\n\nThe trade on the river, I should think, was equal to half that between Ch'ung-k'ing and Sha-shih, but the junks are smaller, run shorter distances, and take much less cargo at a time. Most of them are comfortably provided with passenger bunks. The reason why the Ch'ung-k'ing trade seems so enormous to many appears to me to be that the whole trade of Sz-ch'uan, and part of that of Y\u00fcn-nan, Kwei-chow, Hu-nan, and Hu-peh with the east, is forced into one single channel between Fu-chow and Sha-shih, a distance of 400 miles, whilst here it is better circulated.\n\nA remarkable feature about the boats all along this river is that they are drawn by thin hemp cord, almost as slender as whipcord, instead of the bamboo lines so common in other parts of China. Two or three cords, each not more than the eighth of an inch in thickness, made out of the Boehmeria nivea or grass-cloth hemp, are sufficient to draw a large junk up the rapids.\n\nA small stream, navigable at certain seasons for small boats and rafts, enters the Hangchow river at Si-k'ou.\n\nI saw fishing with cormorants going on at several places. Two or three boats form a triangle, and, beating the water between them, with yells drive their cormorants down; in a few seconds they rise, some with a fish in the mouth, which, on account of their throats being tied tight, they cannot swallow. The boatman grasps the fish, and rewards the bird with a morsel. It is a singular thing to find that here the heron (lu-su) is called the cormorant, and the cormorant (ga-ng) the heron. But I believe there is a classical name lu-tsz for the cormorant which may perhaps be confused with lu-sz, a heron.\n\nThe boundary between Kien-t\u00ea and T'ung-lu\ndistricts is at the Lu-sz M\u00ean (or exit from the gorge enclosing the Ts'il-li Lung fishery), a small fishing village on the right bank, 50 li from Yen-chow Fu. At this point we met a fleet of forty I-wu and Kiang-shan junks, bound upwards with cargoes of salt, cotton, beche-de-mer, &c. The country here opens out a little, and the river, when the water is low, divides for a few miles into two streams, enclosing an islet between them. A small rivulet from the interior of the Kien-t\u00ea district also joins the Hangchow river here.\n\nT'ung-lu district city is unwalled, and appears to contain almost as many houses, and to be as well built as Yen-chow Fu; further, to have almost recovered from rebel ravages. A branch stream, joining the Hangchow River on the north side of T'ung-lu, brings down grain, charcoal, firewood, &c., from F\u00ean-shui \u5206\u6c34 and Ch'ang-hwa \u660c\u5316 districts.\n\nA little coal appears to be produced in Kiang-shan, whence it is brought to Lan-ch'i. Some is also produced in Kien-t\u00ea, where it is locally used in the lime production.\n\nAs far as I could gather no iron is obtained anywhere in the south, north, or west parts, except in the Ch'u-chow prefecture.\n\nThe lime is used here in pounding away (ch'ung or t'ao) the second shelling of paddy after the first husk has been ground off (lung). Gypsum is used for the same purpose at Shanghai, and oyster-shell lime at Canton; rice-husk ash is used at W\u00eanchow; hence it is, perhaps, that rice is always so carefully washed before cooking. Yet in the north, I believe, rice is only once shelled by a process called nien, and no lime is used, though washing is still needed.\n\nThe boundary between the Yen-chow and Hangchow prefectures is at Tsa-ch'i \u6842\u6eaa, (30 li from T'ung-lu), a considerable village on the right bank. The Tsa-ch'i river, opposite, is navigable up to Sin-ch'\u00eang \u65b0\u57ce district town.\n\nAbout 20 or 30 li further down, at some undefined spot near where the river takes a bend eastwards, is the boundary between the Sin-ch'\u00eang and Fu-yang districts; and a small stream on the right bank gives access to parts of P'u-kiang \u6d66\u6c5f district when the water is high. The\nboatmen say that a few li of land inwards on the right bank belong to the Fu-yang district.\n\nFu-yang city is also unwalled, and appears to have recovered even more than T'ung-lu from rebel devastation. It has no special features distinguishing its trade. As at T'ung-lu, there is a salt likin office. It appears that salt pays a loading tax at Hangchow, a small examination fee at places en route, and likin at the place of consumption. General taxing stations are only found at Tung-kwan (Yen-chow Fu), and Lan-ch'i on the way to Kin-hwa city, and at K'\u00fc-chow Fu and Kiang-shan in the west.\n\nBelow Fu-yang, a small stream from the country joins the Hangchow river, and a few miles further east the latter widens out into what looks like a beautiful lake six miles in width. The river then narrows and turns suddenly west at W\u00ean-chia Yen.\n\nBefore reaching the true outskirts of the provincial capital by water from the south, a straggling suburb of two miles in length is passed to the left; then there is a miserable apology for a wharf, whence it is another mile to the nearest gate. From this wharf a free ferry, consisting of a score or so of large boats, runs every few minutes to the opposite bank, about a mile across.\n\nThe famous western lake, a mile or two outside the north-west gate is, in spite of recent devastation, a beautiful spot, and the eccentric Admiral and General P'\u00eang Y\u00fc-lin has fitted up an island in the midst of it where he lives a sort of hermit-priest life when not on circuit. The area enclosed by the walls of Hangchow must rank with the areas of Peking and Nanking, though the walls are not nearly so substantial. The main street runs between three and four miles in an almost straight line. The circuit of the walls is variously estimated at from 20 to 25 miles. Previous to the rebellion, it is said, even the enclosed hills were covered with houses, but, though rebuilding is rapidly going on, scarcely a third of the area is yet filled in, and there is a filthy slovenliness about municipal and sanitary arrangements. Notwithstanding this, I think that Hangchow as it stands must, (with perhaps the exception of Ningpo, which I have only touched at), be the most populous city in Ch\u00eakiang. The Europeans seem to be congregated in\nthe northern or least recovered portion, called the \"lower\" city, and during my walks and rides there I never heard an uncivil word. When paying my official visits, however, in the Tartar quarter, (a small walled enclosure at the north end), and in the upper city, or busy portion, I heard the words Yang Kwei-tsz pretty often. Though the missionaries say that a local brogue is spoken, I heard nothing but Kwan-hwa, nor could I distinguish the language of the local bannermen from that of the Chinese. Both seem to have merged into an impure sort of \"southern mandarin.\" There are 8,000 opium dens in the town; and about 20 wholesale opium houses. The daily trade in the drug, I was told, reached $20,000 a day, and is apparently nearly all in Malwa, some coming from Shanghai, but most from Ningpo.\n\nThough this is a country of silk, it seemed to me that very few had silk on their backs, and indeed the city is poor. The Yam\u00eans are little better than our lumber-rooms or out-houses.\n\nI noticed the Sh\u00ean-pao being taken into several Yam\u00eans and hawked in great numbers about the streets; this paper has made itself a high reputation throughout the northern, western, and central provinces.\n\nFrom the opposite bank a raised path runs 10 li to the market town of Si-hsing \u897f\u8208, under the Siao-shan district. Thence a \"blind\" canal passes through Siao-shan city (10 li) and Ch'ien-ch'ing Ch\u00ean \u9322\u6e05\u93ae (40 li) to Shao-hing Fu (60 li), in all 40 miles. There are various branch canals to I-ch'iao \u7fa9\u6a4b, 60 li, W\u00ean-chia Yen, 30 li, and Pai-ho Ch'ang \u767d\u9db4\u5872, 35 li. Before approaching Hangchow, I had noticed we were getting into a mulberry region, and I rode through some very dense mulberry groves on the Western lake. The country quite changes on the Shao-hing side; for the first ten miles, there is hardly anything to be seen but rice, for which (and its wine) the prefecture is famous. No opium, accounts tend to shew, has been grown in the five northern prefectures; Ningpo finds cotton to pay better; Shao-hing, rice; the others, silk. Yet, during the past two years, the poppy has been planted in Shang-y\u00fc \u4e0a\u865e district.\n\nThe district-city of Siao-shan is traversed by the canal which passes in and out by water-gates under the walls, and\nhas a very picturesque effect. Thence to Shao-hing Fu is 100 li, and branch creeks intersect and irrigate the country in every direction. This is without exception the fattest stretch of land I have ever seen in China or elsewhere. The autumn crop of rice is gathered in two relays, called the early and late kinds, one six weeks or two months later than the other. Strange to say, the quality of the land in the Shan-yin \u5c71\u9670 district differs so much from that in Siao-shan, that there the rice crops are again reaped considerably later. Shan-yin and Kwei-chi \u958b\u79a7 are the prefectural districts, and seem to reek with richness. Substantial villages and market-towns, many as large as the more Western district-cities, succeed one another at distances of half-a-mile, and are to be seen thickly dotted over the country. There being no danger of drought, husbandry is mathematically exact and minute, cultivation being carried to the very water's edge. With the exception of the substantial stone pathways between the cities, there seems to be little means of intercommunication except by boat, and these boats are externally adorned with such consummate art that they have the appearance of being made of fine porcelain. Large and small, they are all fitted up with rain-proof telescope mats, and can be used as dwellings, cargo boats, or passenger and pleasure barges; they fully merit the name of gondola; many of the small ones are worked with the feet, and thousands are passed during a day's travel. The country realizes to the full the \"willow pattern\" idea of China. Stone bridges of elegant shape are seen or passed every few moments; remarkable arches and monuments are thickly strewn about; the willow, tallow, soap, and camphor trees adorn the graves and villages; and all the ideal Chinese scenes, such as goose and duck breeding, weir and basket fishing, &c., recur at every moment. The country is flat, but the graves (which waste a great deal of good land) and village-clusters deprive the landscape of monotony. Towards Shao-hing the hills to the right are approached more closely, and it is thence that the excellent stone is obtained which seems so cheap and plentiful. The highroad canal runs both round and through Shao-hing, and the passage of 10 li through the busiest part of the town affords an excellent opportunity of inspecting it at ease. I noticed the words \"Holy Protestant Chapel\" largely painted upon\na prominent corner house, and I was surprised to see a \"Widow's arch\" of the purest type dedicated in French to Lieut. Le Brethon de Caligny, of the French Navy, and about 20 of his compatriots, who \"died in delivering the Province\" in 1862, 1863, and 1864. Shao-hing is 45 li in circuit, but only the north portion seems to have recovered from the occupation of the rebels, who were here and at Siao-shan for three years,\u2014probably the three above enumerated. It is said that the southern portion furnishes enough paddy to feed the city for three years. There is little about here beyond the dilapidation of cities to shew that the T'aip'ings damaged the country, unless it be that great potential wealth and comfort are accompanied by a maximum of rickettiness and filth in household arrangements; yet some well finished temples, ancestral halls, and even houses are to be seen. The boats are the most desirable resting spots for a European, and next to them (if they were only dry) would be the open paddy fields, notwithstanding the way in which they are fertilized. The winter crops are beans, vegetables, and wheat. The land-tax is very heavy, about 830 cash (in practice) the mu, with $\\frac{8}{10}$ of a pint of rice, commuted for 35 cash.\n\nCultivators' rack-rents range from 250 to 300 catties of paddy (equals half the weight of rice) a mu, that is, nearly one half of an average harvest. The landlord pays the tax, and tenant pays for the beasts and implements.\n\nIt is a remarkable thing that the rebels have nowhere succeeded in destroying the pagodas; every city I have visited has one or more, those of Hangchow and Shao-hing being the finest; in many cases great damage has been done, but this only gives them a quainter appearance of antiquity.\n\nShao-hing produces large quantities of cotton and tea for export, but is of course chiefly noted for its wine; and I noticed several wine-jar potteries. Its trade with Lan-ch'i is by way of I-ch'iao, and of course the canal leads to Ningpo. The telegraph wires are laid double between Ha'gchow and Shao-hing, but only single between Shao-hing and Ningpo. I observed an advertisement by a telegraph agency in a village near Shao-hing, offering codes at 20 cents each, and undertaking to send messages as far South as Swatow, besides Nanking, the Northern towns, and foreign countries; the wires are along the canal the whole way,\ninvariably passing to the rear of villages, and apparently avoiding as far as possible private land.\n\nThe northern shore of Shao-hing produces excellent salt, which (apparently) is both sun-dried and boiled before it is consumed; the flats are under official management, and the local price varies from 20 to 30 cash the catty, according to weather. Ningpo salt which is only dried in the sun seems partly to command the more eastern markets.\n\nAbout 70 li from Shao-hing there is a canal to the south, which leads 20 li to, and ends in, a market-town called Hao-pa \u842c\u5872, under the Shang-y\u00fc district; at the other end of the town a creek joins the tidal river running down to P\u00ea-kwan Ch\u00ean \u767e\u5b98\u93ae near the coast (20 li), from Ch'eng district city (120 li). In a very few moments the broker at Hao-pa provided me with a boat and a written contract. This broking system in Chekiang seems to work very well and advantageously for all parties. The rice crops of Shang-y\u00fc district are liable to destruction by high tides, wherefore the 8 pint of commuted rice tax has been remitted for many generations.\n\nThe reason why a canal is not cut through the few hundred yards which separate the tidal river and the canal might seem to be that the level of the former was originally much higher, and as the sea water, which is not usually found above P\u00ea-kwan, occasionally breaks the dykes, it might ruin a fine rice country. Yet it seems that Ningpo boats can struggle over the two banks which separate the Shang-y\u00fc and Kwei-chi water systems, and that there is still no risk of tidal floods there. On the other hand, the Si-hsing end of the canal is higher than the river at Hangchow. The problem of the respective levels is one which, therefore, I am compelled to abandon; further enquiry is necessary. Small steam launches could do excellent service on these canals.\n\nThe river which runs from Ch'\u00eang \u9806 district passes through a hilly country, in the low parts of which the tallow and mulberry trees are the most prominent objects. The young wheat was everywhere springing up between the latter; the hills are fairly wooded with pine, fir, willows, bamboo, and camphor wood. As far as I could make out, the water level is at times both much higher and much lower than when I was on it. The breadth is\nvery irregular, and there are numerous loops, islands, and short creeks. Judging from the amount of scum and d\u00e9bris, and the facts that the country is muddy and that the rains have been incessant for a month, I presume that I witnessed a moderate freshet. There was water enough everywhere for good-sized steamers. Tall fresh-water grass is here cultivated as fuel; the same sort, grown on salt-water land, is used as string for packing, &c.\n\nCh'\u00eang district produces large quantities of a vegetable called pai chu \u767d\u672f, eaten when young as food, and used as a drug when old; also pears, silk, tobacco, and tea, all of which are exported. The imports are \"South goods,\" salt fish, rice, and pulse. The city is walled, and has been almost entirely rebuilt since the rebel occupation.\n\nThere are numerous prosperous villages and market towns on the banks, amongst which may be named San-kai on the joint frontiers of Kwei-chi, Shang-y\u00fc, and Ch'\u00eang districts.\n\nNavigation, except for a few rafts, ceases at Ch'\u00eang city, but in advancing South-east towards T'ai-chow we kept one branch in sight up to Pan-chu \u73ed\u7af9, a mountain village 40 li further on than Sin-ch'\u00e2ng \u65b0\u660c city, to which district it is subordinate. Another branch runs down from somewhere in the Tung-yang district, and meets the first mentioned just below Ch'\u00eang city. The Sin-ch'\u00e2ng branch is crossed by a ferry by travellers leaving the town of Ch'\u00eang hien in a southerly direction, and again, about 25 li further on, shortly after passing the Sin-ch'\u00e2ng border.\n\nSin-ch'\u00e2ng is a snugly situated city looking like a flat square box set down between the spurs of two hills; our road skirted the walls, over which we could see that the town was fairly well filled with buildings. We were told that not much opium was grown in the neighbourhood, and that barely two ounces of Malwa were purchasable for a dollar. The paddy crop was in, and the young wheat rapidly coming up in its place; the millet (here seen for the first time) was gathering; here also for the first time in China, and subsequently in Hwang-yen district, I saw the water-chestnut (Eleocharis tuberosus) growing in large quantities.\n\nThe mountain scenery, which is constant in its kind throughout the province, becomes exceptionally pretty\nbetween Sin-ch'ang and Pan-chu; the latter place is 500 feet above the plain. The f\u0113ng or maple tree in its autumn yellow was an especially ornamental feature in the landscape. There was nothing of particular interest to note en route, except that lampwick grass was being taken from and cotton to T'ai-chow in large quantities, the latter partly for distribution, perhaps, in the Kin-hwa prefecture.\n\nI should mention that just after entering the Sin-ch'ang district I saw a proclamation regarding the new telegraph line, issued in the joint names of the magistrate and lieutenant in command: it stated that the object was to facilitate the transmission of military intelligence for the better security of the people's hearths and homes. Graves and private property would not be disturbed.\n\nThe road which leads in a south easterly direction from Pan-chu over the hills to the plain of T'ien-t'ai district \u5929\u53f0 crosses three ridges, the highest of which is not more than 1,200 feet above the plain. A manifest difference in the appearance and character of the people is perceptible the moment the limits of the T'ai-chow prefecture, to which T'ien-t'ai is subordinate, are reached. They are both sturdier in build and manlier in bearing than any other of the inhabitants of Ch\u00ea-kiang amongst whom I have been. At the same time they are inclined to be curious and insubordinate, and I should think would require but little provocation to conduct themselves disagreeably.\n\nA small but, at least after the rain, rapid river emerges from the hills and runs through Ts'ing-ch'i, \u6e05\u6eaa (the port of T'ien-t'ai), where it is crossed by a very substantial stone bridge perhaps 200 yards in length, directly after which it joins the Sien-ch\u00fc \u5c71\u5c45 river. I saw no opium, and was told that the district of Hwang-yen \u9ec3\u5ca9 was the one which produced most in T'ai-chow Fu. The plain seemed to be planted everywhere with wheat and winter vegetables.\n\nThe distance from T'ien-t'ai by land to Tung-yang is 160 li: the distance between T'ien-t'ai and T'ai-chow Fu is officially and really 90 li, but popularly 120. I find that one hour is average good time for travelling 10 li by land in China, and I was here on the move nine hours. Ten li are often called a p'u, which term may be compared with the German Stunde, as often meaning the time occupied by the traveller irrespectively of the actual distance traversed.\nA mountain \"three miles high\" may be a mountain from 1,000 feet to 10,000 in height, and from a quarter of a mile to three miles along the usual road from the foot to the summit, but which takes a man an hour to mount on foot.\n\nThe journey from T'ien-t'ai to T'ai-chow may also be made by water, but the river was so swollen that no boats could get up to the town during the two days I was there. Sien-ch\u00fc district, 100 li further up, is to be reached by two-ton boats, and P'an-t'an (previously mentioned when at Tsin-y\u00fcn), 50 li still higher, by rafts. The river scenery, hilly and well wooded, is very pretty, and the ferry has to be used twice on the way. Sien-ch\u00fc appears to be distant by land only 45 li from Ta-ching and about 120 li from Yo-ch'ing. This town (T'ien-t'ai) imports silk from Ch'eng and Sin-ch'ang districts; it appears to be the extreme limit to which Malwa opium reaches, and even then it is barely known to be purchasable in the town. T'ai-chow salt, which costs 3 cash on the coast, and 7 at Hwang-yen, sells at 15 or 16 cash a catty at T'ien-t'ai. Tea seems to be the chief production of the district. I was told that iron was obtained from Chu-chi.\n\nT'ai-chow Fu is a finely situated city, the houses of which are built round one side of a hill whose toe almost cuts the town in two; the walls enclose part of the heights behind. The rebels did no damage during the first year of their occupation, as the inhabitants had opened their gates to them and offered supplies of food; but disputes arose later on; plundering took place in the villages; and the Eastern part of the town was subsequently partly destroyed. The rebels by all accounts do not seem to have much injured the country parts of T'ien-t'ai and Lin-hai, (the T'ai-chow prefectural district); at all events these have now the appearance of being very thickly populated with (for China) well-to-do communities. The river at T'ai-chow is crossed by two bridges of boats, and then takes a bold sweep north, after which its course down to Kiang-k'ou \u6c5f\u53e3 (the port of Hwang-yen) is exceedingly tortuous, as it passes through pleasant hill and village scenery. The effect of the tides is felt up to within 20 li of T'ai-chow; 40 li below T'ai-chow I moored whilst the tide\nran suddenly and rapidly up for three hours, rising perhaps 12 feet during that time, after which it carried us down 16 or 18 miles in three hours. The next tide took us up from Kiang-k'ou to Hwang-yen. Steam gunboats can at all times get up to Kiang-k'ou, but except when swollen by floods, the river between Kiang-k'ou and T'ai-chow is only navigable by small boats. The Hwang-yen river is hardly navigable at all 10 miles above the town.\n\nThe notorious bandit Chin-man \u91d1\u6eff, who is often known by his adopted surname of Hwang \u9ec3, is still in the mountains, although he has nominally given in his submission, and draws $300 a month from the Prefect's chest for the support of himself and his immediate followers. At the same time he now refrains from plunder, and has nominally surrendered, and keeps the bandit class well in hand. As he is a sort of Robin Hood in his ways, and always treats the poor kindly; the rich and official classes are the only ones who in the least fear him.\n\nThere is an extensive and rich plain between Hwang-yen and the boundary of Yo-ch'ing \u6a02\u6e05, after which two ridges, each of a few hundred feet in height, have to be crossed. It was too early for opium, (which is planted a month later than in Sz-ch'uan), but large tracts of land were being prepared for it. Wheat, rape, and vegetables of all sorts were springing up, and water chestnuts, tallow-berries, and rice were stored or storing. Hwang-yen is famous for its oranges, and it also produces an inferior sort of silk stuff. The celebrated Wenchow tribute oranges are grown from slips of one kind grafted on to trees of another dwarf variety.\n\nIt is 75 li from Hwang-yen to the walled town of Ta-ching \u5927\u834a (under Yo-ch'ing district), which place is distant from T'ai-ping \u592a\u5e73 district city 80 li. Hwang-yen city is also distant from T'ai-ping 80 li. Hung-ch'iao \u8679\u6a4b is 60 very long li from Ta-ching, and Chu-hs\u00fc \u7af9\u5dbc (on the coast) is half the way from Hung-ch'iao to Ta-ching, which in all is 80 li. Ta-ching and a place called Wu-yung, farther south, produce considerable quantities of iron, but no coal. Tea, however, is the chief staple, and \"tea-tax assistant sub-prefect\" is the title of the civil official at Ta-ching. Later on, I was informed, the whole country would be covered with the poppy.\nThree inconsiderable ridges have to be crossed between Ta-ching and the city of Yo-ch'ing; the road skirts the coast inlets, and a considerable river has to be crossed 20 li to the north of Hung-ch'iao; this river appears to communicate with Wu-yung, the iron-producing spot above mentioned, 30 li distant eastwards from the ferry.\n\nThe fine range of mountains known as the Yen-tang Hills is left on the right, and either Yo-ch'ing or Ta-ching may be made the base of an exploring trip amongst the numerous temples and remarkable crags which have obtained a holiday seeker's celebrity in this region. A great portion of the coast-land about here has been enclosed by strong dykes, and reclaimed for agricultural purposes. Considerable tracts are also given up to mussel, cockle, and clam breeding. Both these descriptions of land add largely to the revenue collection of the district, and are exceedingly profitable to the owners. A creek leads from Hung-ch'iao to Yo-ch'ing, but, as it is interrupted in several places by banks and dams, it is not of much commercial importance.\n\nFrom Yo-ch'ing to Kwan-t'ou, a small town belonging to Yo-ch'ing, and situated on a loop of the W\u00ean-chow river, it is 30 li to the city of W\u00eanchow. This journey from Yo-ch'ing may be made either by canal or road, but the canal is blind at the Kwan-t'ou or port end, and is only used by small boats.\n\nYo-ch'ing city is finely situated near the end of a tunnel-like valley, and at the foot of the Yen-tang range of hills. The circuit of the new city is double the size of the old walls, which occupy another site a mile further to the north, and are inhabited only by a few stragglers. The country here abounds with handsome women, who are very neatly dressed, and all wear a comely apron made out of a sort of \"Scotch\" plaid. No traces whatever of the rebel occupation are now visible at or near Hwang-yen, Ta-ching, or Yo-ch'ing. Prosperous villages succeed each other along the road with great frequency.\n\nW\u00eanchow city itself was never entered, although the suburbs were partly in rebel hands. The numerous canals, which intersect the city and communicate with the river and tidal creeks, enabled the inhabitants to obtain external supplies of food on the one hand, and to keep the besiegers at a harmless distance on the other.\nWe did not enter the T'ai-p'ing district. This produces rice for export, opium, tea, and a small quantity of silk.\n\nThe stretch of country between T'ai-chow Fu and W\u00ean-chow Fu is still a good deal harassed by local bandits. On the road I met the Hwang-yen magistrate, who turned out to be an old Kewiang acquaintance. He was escorted by 30 soldiers armed with rifles, and informed me that the country was so thickly populated that the improvident classes had scarcely any resource but plunder.\n\nIt is 80 li from Yo-ch'ing city by land and water to the island and sub-prefectural city of Y\u00fc-hwan \u7389\u74b0. It is 60 li by either land or water to Kwan-t'ou; and 90 li by land to F\u00eang-lin \u6a0a\u6797.\n\nTo sum up: it will be seen from the above account that the province of Ch\u00ea-kiang is or might be almost self-supporting in all commodities except coal, iron, and opium, of which last two she still imports perhaps a good half of her total consumption: coal she does not much use, nor perhaps require, being specially rich in lumber. The western half has recovered from the effects of the rebellion, whilst the eastern half still requires time.\n\nMy journey was so arranged that I actually visited all the prefectural towns, except the two to the extreme north, and one to the extreme west. These I propose to visit on future occasions. In addition there remain to be inspected the communications with Fukien in the south, and Kiang-si and Anhwei in the west. I wish also, if possible, to examine the Zik'a tribes of western Ch'u-chow prefecture. It will be seen that at least a glimpse has been obtained at all the arteries of the province, with the exception of those named, and that the command of Ningpo, Shanghai, and Hangchow (including Lan-ch'i) over all but the Ch'u-chow and W\u00eanchow prefectures is quite natural and legitimate, as the T'ao-hwa range to the west and the Yen-tang range to the east are sufficient to exclude W\u00eanchow from competition with Ningpo in the K'\u00fc-chow, T'ai-chow, and Kin-hwa prefectures.\n\nUnder the head of Ningpo, a map of Ch\u00eakiang will be found in the Annual Customs Trade Reports for 1881 and 1882. In this there are some important errors and omissions. The river which runs from King-ning \u9752\u5be7 to T'sing-t'ien \u9752\u7530 is not given. The city of Yung-k'ang\n\u6c38\u5eb7 is omitted, and the river which runs from Yung-k'ang past Wu-i \u6b66\u7fa9 to Kin-hwa \u91d1\u83ef is made to end in the sand. There is no such branch river as that given south of I-wu \u7fa9\u70cf; it should branch off at Kin-hwa; and it is to be doubted whether the left and right bank river boundaries of Yen-chow Fu and Kin-hwa Fu respectively are correctly given. The space distances of places between Hangchow and Shao-hing \u7d39\u8208 are disproportionate, and the vast vacant space south of T'ai-chow \u53f0\u5dde exists not, or belongs to the northern part of W\u00ean-chow Fu, the towns of which have been cramped into an excessively reduced area. The Hwang-yen \u9ec3\u5ca9 tidal river is of no size or importance above Hwang-yen, and is only navigable for small boats as far as Ta-ch'i \u5927\u6eaa a few miles above that city. Hou-so \u5f8c\u6240 is not south, but a mile to the north of Yo-ch'ing \u6a02\u6e05, (not L\u00ea-ch'ing).\n\nComparing the size of Ch\u00ea-kiang with that of England, and considering the comparatively small number of large towns in the former, I am inclined to think that the population of 11,000,000, officially reported by the governor, is not far from the mark; more especially as, in the east portion at least, quite half the population must have perished during the rebellion. Unlike what is the case in An-hwei, no influx of immigrants from other provinces has taken place.\nARTICLE III.\n\nA JOURNEY IN FUKIEN.\n\nBY\n\nE. H. PARKER, Esq.,\n\nOf H. B. M.'s Consular Service.\n\nI LEFT the Prefect's Bridge of W\u00eanchow on the 11th of January 1884, bound for the south. Poling the boat for half a mile through a noisome liquid which looked like dye-wash or ink, we emerged at the water-gate adjoining the Small South Gate of the city, and followed the wall to the Great South Gate. Then, turning once more south, we continued in this direction past the Shan Ch'ien Hill \u5c71\u524d with its inclined pagoda, known as the Sun T'a \u7570\u5854, for twenty li, as far as the market town of Pai-siang \u767d\u50cf (with a pagoda), after which we turned south-west, passed through the hills which encircle W\u00eanchow to the south, and continued ten li due south to Wang-yu \u7fc1\u6e38, the last town in the Yung-chia \u6c38\u5609 district, and found ourselves in a small valley surrounded by rather bare but picturesque hills, ranging up to 1,000 feet in height. The country is very thickly populated, and admirably provided with fresh water canal intercommunications: it is not unlike the rich flat stretch between Hangchow and Shao-hing, but hardly so teeming with fatness. The most striking novelties are the innumerable orange groves, producing the celebrated Ou kan \u9178\u67d1, or bitter tribute-orange. The fruit of the Cantonese K\u00eam ku\u00eat \u91d1\u6a58 (cumquot) is sown in the ground, and slips of the Kan or Citrus Margarita are grafted upon the young roots: the result is the large bitter orange, no higher than a gooseberry bush. If encouragement were given to this trade by the steamers, and care taken in transhipping the fruit at Shanghai, and getting it to Tientsin before the close of the river, an enormous trade with Mongolia would inevitably follow; but the speculators have been discouraged by the carelessness of their agents,\nwho have more than once left large speculative consignments to rot in Shanghai. At Wenchow the oranges cost about a penny a pound, but the Mongols (and indeed the northerners generally) have so high an opinion regarding the febrifuge effect of this fruit that they will pay even sixpence apiece at times. The stalks are often lime-washed to keep off the insects, and straw is frequently inserted in the fork of the tree as an encouragement to spiders to spin there, and not about the leaves, which the web causes to wilt.\n\nThe canals swarm with innumerable small craft, and besides there are fairly comfortable hwa ch'uan \u82b1\u8239, i.e. passenger or \"pleasure\" boats, and hang ch'uan \u822a\u8239, or cargo boats, carrying also passengers between Jui-an \u745e\u5b89 and Wenchow at 40 cash, or twopence, a head. These last invariably run at night, and during the busy or winter season four leave each end every evening with the greatest regularity. One centime or less a mile is certainly cheap travelling. The chief cargo from Jui-an is P'ing-yang \u5e73\u967d tea of very excellent quality.\n\nA considerable amount of fishing is done on these canals in the same way as at Ich'ang \u5b9c\u660c. A dozen small boats, each worked by a lad, move to a position in Indian file; they then wheel across; a man in the bow of each casts a large net into the water, and several other boatmen occupy themselves further down with beating the water; the roach-like fish rush towards the barrier of nets, and are taken in great numbers.\n\nSouth-east from Wang-yu lies Shwang-sui Ch'ang \u7a3b\u5872, a salt-producing district from which a superior kind of fine white sea salt is obtained: it sells for about 16 cash a catty at Wenchow. Wenchow, Shwang-sui, and Jui-an are all 70 li from one another. Convenient free-ferries, consisting of a flat square barge, large enough to hold a dozen men, with ropes attached to each bank and to each end of the boat, enable passengers to pull themselves across from village to village. Boats going south have to be poled or \"yuloed\" to a point about 10 li from Wenchow, after which there is an admirable embankment and towing-path all the way to Jui-an. The canal looks more like a broad clear river than anything else. Not much is to be seen at this time of the year in\nthe way of crops, as, except where occupied by orange groves, the land is all ploughed up in readiness for seed. Splendid old specimens of banyan trees are passed at intervals, some of which are deeply rooted into the stones, and have the appearance of being many centuries old.\n\nThirty-five li from Wenchow, and about a mile from the main canal, is the picturesque town and congeries of monasteries called Sien Yen \u4ed9\u5ca9, or \"Fairy Rock.\" This name is derived from a picturesque grotto and waterfall behind the town. I walked through the town with two of my own servants only in plain dress as escort, and the people behaved very well: only a few boys (as they do even at Wenchow) shouted out Fa Nang (Fan Jen, \u6cd5\u4eba). Shortly after passing Sui-feng \u968f\u98ce, 40 li from Wenchow, the canal or river takes a turn to the right or south-west; then a pagoda looms out from a hill to the west, and the canal bends sharply round in that direction, pierces the hills, and runs through water-gates into Jui-an city. The canal also passes round by the East Gate to the South Gate, where it ends: twenty yards further is the sea. I had a particular reason for passing through and staying at Jui-an; for no one had, at least for some time, actually spent a night in the town. I put up at a small inn conveniently situated on the narrow strip separating the end of the canal from the bay, and was very hospitably received. In other respects the choice was undesirable, for passengers arriving by canal and river or sea clamoured all night long for admission in the first instance to our inn, and kept us all awake. There had been an attempt made by some boys to get up a hooting as I removed from my house-boat to a small sampan outside the first water-gate, but this display of emotion was promptly suppressed by the elders.\n\nThe Magistrate had evidently taken satisfactory precautions to prevent any mobbing in my case. Though I walked along the street, and stood prominently in the high stern of the ferry-boat, the large concourse of people uttered no uncivil word in my hearing.\n\nThe Fei-y\u00fcn Kiang \u98de\u96f2\u6c5f, or Jui-an river, runs down from T'ai-shun \u6cf0\u9806 district city, 400 li to the west, and broadens out into an arm of the sea below Jui-an. The breadth of the river opposite the city is half a mile, and a rapid tide renders the passage of the huge clumsy ferries\na very tedious operation, except at low or high water. It took us an hour to cross. Seventy li below the city is Hai-an So \u6d77\u5b89\u6240, the territorial name of the salt-producing flat Shwang-sui Ch'ang. Fine salt from the depot sells for 8 cash in Jui-an, and Fukien salt (which only costs one cash where it is produced in Fukien) for 6 cash.\n\nJui-an seems to produce for export nothing but water-chestnuts, fruits, and of late opium, which is of superior quality, and was quoted to me at four ounces the dollar. Foreign opium is purchasable, but very little known or smoked. The mountain district of T'ai-shun sends down nothing but bamboo, lumber, fuel, &c. Jui-an is of course supplied with foreign goods from Wenchow, with which place its water and land communications are perfect. The P'ing-yang teas also come this way, but the vast alum export is from Ch'ih-ch'i \u8d64\u6eaa, a port further south. The boatmen I spoke to at Jui-an said that no steam gunboats had ever been up the river to the city, but at high water I think large steamers could undoubtedly come up; that is, supposing that bars and banks lower down would not prevent or hamper navigation. The water is so muddy that there must be a great deal of silt.\n\nWalking half a mile from the ferry, we came to another blind canal at Ma-t'ou Pu \u99ac\u982d\u57e0, and took sampans to P'ing-yang city (30 li). The small valley between the two cities is surrounded by considerable hills on all sides but the East, and is quite the characteristic Chekiang picture, an enclosed valley ten or twenty miles in diameter. It would not be too bold to describe the whole province as a succession of these, each one being a district or a well-defined fraction of one. The P'ing-yang valley is a repetition of the country from Wenchow,\u2014flat, hedgeless, rich fields, and perfect water communications. We made the journey in open sampans in three hours. The city is prettily situated at the foot of two lofty hills which slope down on each side to a col or pass, surmounted by a pavilion or pagoda to the south of the town. The walls do not appear to be more than a mile or a mile and a half in circumference. The dividing line between Jui-an and P'ing-shan districts is at T'u-shan T'ou \u571f\u5c71\u982d, almost a mile from the tidal river at Jui-an. Barley (for making sugar-cake) and rape were the chief crops just sown; the boatmen said that the cultivation of the\npoppy was rather on the decrease, as it did not pay very well; cotton had once been the rule, but that also had not been found to pay, on account of the heavy spring rains and strong autumn winds. As usual throughout Chekiang, the tallow tree (the berries of which had been gathered at this time) was the commonest tree, whilst, for ornamental trees, fine specimens of the banyan relieved the monotony of the flatness here and there.\n\nWe passed in our sampans round the walls to the east side of P'ing-yang, and crossed another gap in the hills to Pu-nan \u57d4\u5357, a busy-looking suburb, a mile distant from the city. Here we witnessed the uncommon spectacle of a pagoda undergoing repairs. A blind canal communicates with Ku-ngao-t'ou \u53e4\u9c32\u982d to the south-east, and Ts'ien-ts'ang \u524d\u5009 to the south-west, both 30 li from P'ing-yang. The former place is the centre of the Ningpo alum trade, and is the port of P'ing-yang. The sea-going junks load at Ch'ih-ch'i on the other side of the arm of the sea, cross over to Ku-ngao-t'ou, where the Ningpo merchants have their guild and establishments, and thence clear for Ningpo. The alum export by this route reaches 200,000 piculs, or quite 12,000 tons a year.\n\nWe took the Ts'ien-ts'ang route, passing at the village of Jui-yang \u745e\u967d (20 li) under the very prominent and savage-looking peak known as Kin-chi Shan \u91d1\u96de\u5c71, a little to the north-west of which is the almost equally prominent peak of T'ang-ts'un Shan \u5858\u6751\u5c71, and again to the west the considerable Ts'ien-ts'ang Hills. These three may be considered as the southern limit of the lofty Yen-tang range \u96c1\u8569\u5c71, which runs from T'aichow \u53f0\u5dde south to the sea. Indeed, the P'ing-yang teas are known as South Yen-tang, just as the Yo-ch'ing \u6a02\u6e05 teas are known as North Yen-tang.\n\nThe boatmen on these canals have an ingenious way of passing the tow-rope under the numerous bridges. A ball of twisted bamboo is attached to the end of each tow-line. This is flung in a direction contrary to that in which the boat is moving, and, by a jerk, made to come up on the other side,\u2014thus saving delay.\n\nConsidering the importance of the alum trade, it is astounding how little of the country is known at Wenchow, or even at P'ing-yang. The maps and charts at\nhand also appear hopelessly at sea as to the exact configuration of the country. At Ts'ien-ts'ang I succeeded, by dint of cross-questioning boatmen and porters, in eliciting the following information, which, coupled with the fact of my having visited most of the places named, shews that, far from being (as is supposed at Wenchow), a hazardous and difficult journey, it is actually almost as short and easy to go to Foochow by way of the alum mountain as not. We travelled comfortably 60 li from Ts'ien-ts'ang, with the tidal river which runs past Ts'ien-ts'ang to Ku-ngao-tou, southwest to Liu-shih \u67f3\u77f3 in four hours; thence we travelled south-west, through a series of very fine gorges, past Sao-ch'i \u64ad\u6eaa (10 li), over two ridges 1,000 and 1,500 feet high, 30 more li to Fan Shan \u78c1\u5c71 or alum mountain, the valley at the foot of which is about 750 feet above the sea. From Fan Shan to Ts'ien-ch'i \u524d\u5c90 it is 30 li by land, and a tidal river takes you from Ts'ien-ch'i to T'ung-shan \u6850\u5c71 (as Fuh-ting \u798f\u9f0e city, the first district in Fukien, is usually called, from the name once given to the whole region). The main road from P'ing-yang to Foochow also passes Ts'ien-ts'ang, and thence the ferry-towns of north and south Siao-tu \u85a9\u6e21 (10 li), Lin-k'i \u51cc\u6eaa (30 li), K'iao-tou M\u00ean \u6a4b\u9661\u9580 (80 li), F\u00ean-shui Kwan \u5206\u6c34\u95dc 30 li, to Fuh-ting (30 li), 130 li in all, nearly all by land, instead of 160 li by Fan Shan, of which all but 70 li can be done by boat. The forty li between Liu-shih and Fan Shan are, however, often called, and are certainly in labour equal to 60 li, and the people, though not hostile to strangers, are unsophisticated and very independent. Near Sao-ch'i we witnessed an instance of this. The sound of cannon and gongs attracted our attention to the movements of certain villages: passing through one, we saw an assembly of yokels going through some formal act, with rough policemen-like hats on their heads, outside the temple grounds; then we met a file of twenty more villagers marching with spears and match-locks towards the first group; in the far distance we descried another army of about 50, similarly armed, and advancing rapidly in martial style. One account was that two rival surnames had decided to fight out at an agreed spot some question connected with a theft, and that the custom oft he country was to have \"trial by combat\" in this way, and to report then first to the authorities when the dead bodies had\nbeen counted. Another account was that a handsome empty coffin had been stolen from the ancestral hall of one surname and sold by a man of another surname, and that the thief had been made by his own elders to point out the receiver of the coffin, whose house was going to be pulled down formally by an armed body made up of the two surnames, though he was admittedly ignorant of the source whence the coffin had been derived, and though the thief, on confessing, had been dismissed. Whichever way it was, it shews that the people have a will of their own. Meanwhile, the women and children seemed to be watching with equanimity these warlike operations, and the passers-by talked of the matter as if it were a daily and unimportant occurrence. It was as though the village blacksmith, grocer, tailor, doctor, cobbler, &c., of rival English villages were to assemble in their working clothes, put on \"chimney-pot hats\" for the sake of formality, and sally forth to fight on the village green or manor common. Probably the fighting in the Chinese case would consist largely of yells and pirouettes executed by the older and wiser heads, until a couple of young simpletons on each side would get sufficiently excited to poke each other with spears; the wounded would then be rushed upon and butchered by the enemy; the armies of both sides would run away; the bodies would be left alone, or conveyed to the nearest temple, and the timid magistrate be asked to come with his \"coroner\" to hold an inquest. Some one, however, must be killed on each side, just to leave a salutary impression of awe as a warning to future thieves or ill-doers.\n\nAnother way to the alum hills is by way of Ku-ngao-t'ou (10 li east or south-east lower down the river than Ts'ien-ts'ang), 40 li by either land or water to Wu-shih Ling \u70cf\u77f3\u5dba, and 20 li thence to Sao-ch'i. Or Ch'ih-ch'i, which is 80 li to the west of Fan Shan, can be made the base of operations, as appears to have been the case with the only foreigner (apparently Mr. Gutzlaff) who has hitherto visited the mines. His description is quoted in the Ningpo Customs Report for 1868. As far as I could learn, Ch'ih-ch'i is about 60 li, or \"one tide\" (that is the time taken to run up or down with the tide) from Ku-ngao-t'ou by sea, or by another blind canal or river. The alum export used to be by way of Liu-shih, but the land journey to Ch'ih-ch'i was found easier. At a point called locally Ngie-lung K'ae (which probably is\nin official Chinese Yen-lung K'\u00eang \u56b4\u9f8d\u5751), halfway between Liu-shih and Fan Shan, a road runs (80 or 40 li) south to Ch'ih-ch'i.\n\nThere are three places marked on the map published with the Ningpo Customs Trade Reports for 1881-2: namely, Ch'ien-k'u \u524d\u5eab, P'u-m\u00ean \u6d66\u9580, and Chin-hsiang \u91d1\u9109. I was told at Ts'ien-ts'ang that it was 30 li from Ku-ngao-t'ou (also known as Wu-shih T'ou \u70cf\u77f3\u982d or Ho-ts'a'o T'ou \u6cb3\u69fd\u982d, locally U-z\u00f6 diu), and that Chin-hsiang was 25 or 30 li south-east from Ku-ngao-t'ou, and also 80 li from Ts'ien-ts'ang. P'u-m\u00ean was said to be 40 li from Ch'ih-ch'i and 70 from Chin-hsiang, and Sha-ch'\u00eang \u6c99\u57ce 40 li south of P'u-m\u00ean. Ku-ngao-t'ou is also 30 li from the two Siao-chia Tu (north and south), and Sha-ch'\u00eang 70 li from Fan Shan.\n\nAt Liu-shih there is a prominent hill called Wan-ching Shan \u842c\u666f\u5c71, and this with one or two other peaks near are visible from the 1,000 and 1,500 feet elevations above alluded to, and lie exactly north-north-east of Fan Shan, which is therefore south-south-west of P'ing-yang, Jui-an, and Wenchow.\n\nA mile nearer Fan Shan than Ngie-lung K'ae, a road branches off to Ts'ien-k'i, (40 li).\n\nI hope this dry enumeration of names and distances will be of use to any European who may in future make what is undoubtedly an interesting visit.\n\nBetween Liu-shih and Fan Shan we passed through many tea plantations, most of them on flat land, which, if there were water enough, would be given up to rice. Except the prominent and rocky peaks alluded to, and the hills enclosing the gorges, most of the hills south of P'ing-yang are terraced for cultivation to a greater extent than is usual in Chekiang, and look very like parts of Eastern Sz-ch'uan.\n\nThe alum is taken in stone blocks (first split with fire, not with powder, and then broken with a sledge hammer) out of the bowels of a mountain perhaps 10 miles round at the base, the top of which may be 1,000 feet above the valley. This mountain is honeycombed and turned up in every direction. It seems to consist of earth, grit, and yellow sand-stone, interstrewn with huge boulders of alum-stone, like plums in a pudding. The stone is carried to covered kilns, and there stowed for two days and two nights law lin-\nlike stacks at each side of a mild furnace of brushwood. A long pole like a battering ram is held by three men: lumps of stone are placed on the end of the pole lying inside the furnace door, and are swung up in layers or walls on each side by a sudden thrust and turn. After being thus heated and softened, the stones are placed in a sunken vat or hole, and slaked for a few minutes; they are then placed in a shallow pit, and broken into small pieces. The next step is to place them in other sunken vats, and soak them with water for three days and three nights. Then this smoking lime-like mess is placed in a huge mud boiler (at the back of the kiln) with a tiny iron pan or base at its bottom or apex, and boiled by the same furnace which softens the stones. Another flue-like fire runs round the mud boiler, half way up. This thick soupy decoction is then placed in other sunken stone pits, and allowed to cool. The pure alum crystallizes about six inches thick in beautiful stalactite form, and adheres to the sides; it is then sawn off in blocks of 50 or 100 pounds weight, and carried straight away down to Ch'ih-ch'i by an army of porters. The cooled water which collects in the centre is used again for slaking. The grit, which sinks, is thrown outside. The alum thus purified (the factor told me) fetched about a dollar a picul at Ch'ih-ch'i. He said he boiled from 20 to 40 piculs a day, but never reached quite 10,000 a year; he also said there were 24 boiling establishments now working, all of the same size; this supports the independent total estimate of 200,000 piculs a year given to me by another man. Each establishment employs about 100 hands in all, and there are about 5,000 porters, of whom half are Zik'a \u5973\u5ba2 women. Thus about 10,000 people at least are locally supported by the alum trade.\n\nWater for tea-making and drinking has to be brought from a distance, so impregnated with alum is the local fluid.\n\nI met three Zik'a women. The Hunan braves at once called them Yao \u732a, probably from some resemblance to Hunan tribes. They looked to me something like the Miao-tsz women I once saw in Kweichow, but were rather more Chinese, possibly on account of their dress. This was very like that of Chinese women, except that the ornaments were somewhat barbaric. The hair was collected and twisted into a point at the top of the head, and the feet were natural.\nAs the three fresh and rosy ladies I met were as curious to inspect me as I was to examine them, we had a good stare at each other. The men of the Zik'a race as a rule live at their ease at home, and even lie abed (it is I think said) when their wives have children; but here they join in the alum porterage business. They wear the queue, and dress as usual with Chinese. I am not quite sure that I saw any, though some faces decidedly looked barbarian, i.e. not rus\u00e9s.\n\nFrom what I was told of their language, I think these people at least must be the same race as the Sia-po \u659c\u5a46 of Foochow, of whom, however, I have not hitherto met specimens. The Chinese in Chekiang call them Kou-tou-fan \u72d7\u982d\u756a or \"dog-head barbarians,\" from some peculiarity in their head-dress, or from the ridiculous notion that they are the offspring of dogs and human beings.\n\nThe road from Fan Shan to Fuh-ting city (which as I have said is usually called by its military divisional appellation of T'ung-shan), goes off to the west, and from it shortly branches off to the south a road to P'u-m\u00ean, the distance of which was variously stated at 40 and 60 li. A curious livid-green-coloured rivulet runs down to Fan Shan in a picturesque gulley to the left, and two descents and one ascent of 250 feet amongst the mountains bring the road to the Fukien frontier (Fuh-ting district), 25 li from Fan Shan. Five li further on is the busy market town of Ts'ien-k'i, apparently at the head of one inlet in what is called \"Gordon Bay\" in the Admiralty Charts. We just caught the last of ebb at this point, sailed down in a southerly direction past two islands, forming (\"Tau-mun \u982d\u9580\") a sort of triple gate southwards from the sea; then west to another arm of the sea said to lead to the Fukien port of Sha-ch'\u00eang (120 li), and then north-west to a point one mile distant from the tiny walled city of Fuh-ting, where a small river runs into the arm of the sea. I enquired after Pei-kwan Hill, which is said on the charts to be prominent, and, from the indications given, conclude that it is, as printed, somewhere on the left bank of the sea arm which runs down to Sha-ch'\u00eang. P'u-m\u00ean was said to be 30 li to the east of Sha-ch'\u00eang, and 95 li from Ts'ien-k'i. The members of our party spoke half a dozen leading dialects between us, but we found communication with the\nrustic natives utterly hopeless, though I could clearly detect in the few words identified a regular passage from the Wenchow to the Foochow dialect; for instance the fa of the former became at last distinctly hwang in the latter, as the epithet fun \u756a applied to me, and the dji of Ts'ien-ki became clearly k'iu \u5cb8. Opposite this island gate, a third arm of the sea runs north to Ta-ho (in Fukien). The distance round the bay from Ts'ien-ki to the point above mentioned is 35 li, but a land journey of 30 li is alternative.\n\nThe authorities at Fuh-ting were extremely civil to me. The colonel in command, the captain, and the magistrate all called in person, and the last-named posted a proclamation outside my inn, worded in very gratifying terms. As I was on this occasion travelling without uniform, in fact walking, I excused myself from the disrespectful act of receiving them thus attired, but we interchanged small presents and many compliments. The people were of course curious, but (herein differing from the people in P'ing-yang and Jui-an) wore no sullen air of suspicion; in fact I had been astonished at my hearty though boisterous reception by the alum miners, whose children even were not afraid to stand by and have their cheeks pinched, whilst along the road, almost up to the Fuh-ting frontier, the expression on the majority of faces was one of patronising good nature. The fishing and coast populations were not, however, very nice to look at, I thought.\n\nAt Ts'ien-ki I noticed large quantities of oysters ready shelled and sold in a liquid mass; shrimps, cockles, and innumerable other things of a fishy nature and smell; also quantities of very pungent smelling sea grass, used for dyeing; and loads of gypsum, which is found amid the \"rotten rocks\" (as my informant put it) in the neighbouring hills, and simply washed with water before being sold; it is extensively used in the bean curd manufacture as a rennet.\n\nPrevious to the reign of K'ien-lung, (say that of our King George the Third) the modern Fuh-ting Hien was, I at last found, called T'ung-shan \"Ch\u00eau,\" or so to speak \"unchartered borough.\" It produces for export tea and tobacco, and of course fish. Over two thousand tons of alum are said to come annually through the town or district into Fukien, but I saw nothing of it. The climate became perceptibly milder, and the hills softer in every sense, lower,\nand more cultivated from the moment we crossed the Ch\u00e9kiang and Fukien frontier. Only Tls. 8,000 of land tax (and this is a fair gauge of a district's importance) are collected. Patna, or \"great earth,\" is the only foreign opium smoked, and its local price is 22 clean or 26 average value chopped dollars a ball. Chopped dollars are the currency of Fukien as clean are that of Ch\u00e9kiang, and clean are as exceptional in the former as chopped in the latter. \"Juice,\" as native Opium is simply called, runs considerably under four ounces for the local dollar.\n\nWe left the city in a southerly direction, and if that course is continued 10 li a boat can be taken 30 li round by the inlets from Chiang-ka \u8523\u5bb6 to Lin-ka-tu \u6797\u5bb6\u6e21, 10 li from Pai-lin \u767d\u7433.\n\nWe went by land the whole 50 li to Pai-lin, and as our general direction was south-west, by way of Ngan-ch'\u00fcan \u5ca9\u6cc9 (10 li), no doubt both these first named places are at the heads of the great inlet, or of the two inlets, the mouth or mouths of which are given in the chart.\n\nThere is a large fishing village named Tien-t'ou \u5e97\u982d 30 li from Fuh-ting, and here a tea-tax is collected on the leaf coming south. We crossed two unnavigable streams before arriving at this place. As we approached Pai-lin, which on account of the poverty of (even from a Chinese point of view) decent inns must perforce be made a terminus, we passed through some very extensive red-soiled tea hills, looking very much like the coffee hills of Ceylon, and drained by a network of deep diagonal channels; some tea also occupied furrows in the fields, between narrow stretches of cereals or vegetables. The chief of these for the day were rape, saffron-flower, wheat, beans, mustard, and peanuts.\n\nAt Tien-t'ou I was met by a simple and wild looking official emissary from Ha-p'u \u971e\u6d66 Hien, (Fu-ning Fu). He created a great deal of hilarity amongst my followers in making them understand (with difficulty) that the kaing (hien) had sent him; as ye is the Wenchow form of this word, and hs\u00fcan that of Hunan, the transition to kaing was altogether too bold for them all, nor did the addition of the prefix ti (chih) \u77e5 facilitate matters. He produced his papers, which shewed that the border authorities were taking most considerate steps to secure my safety. At Tien-t'ou also I was interested to see a Zik'a woman with her head\ndress, which indeed looks very like a dog's snout made of felt, a red tassel behind representing the ear.\n\nThe journey of seventy or eighty li from Pai-lin (the celebrated Paklum) to Yang-chia-ch'i \u694a\u5bb6\u6eaa once more lies through a magnificent mountain country, the road passing over two ridges 1,500 feet above the sea, and whilst incessantly twining, and ascending or descending a few hundred feet, keeping on the average at an altitude of 1,000 feet. Some of the mountains in the neighbourhood must have been close upon 4,000 feet in height, but the cultivation of tea and poppy in slopes and terraces was carried wherever practicable to the very tops. Notwithstanding this, the country has an unkempt look, and is not neatly tilled, whilst the villages are as filthy as any I have seen in China. On the whole the inns, however, though sorry quarters, compare favourably with those of that much overrated province Sz-ch'uan; neither in Ch\u00eakiang nor Fukien are pigstyes placed in such close proximity to the best rooms as is usually the case in Kweichow and Sz-ch'uan. The places passed are Wu-p'u-ling \u4f0d\u92ea\u5dba, San-shih-liu Ngao \u5341\u516d\u5747 (or Wan) (or \u6e7e), Tsiang-yang \u8523\u6d0b, Tu-chia \u675c\u5bb6, and Lung-t'ing \u9f8d\u4ead, and the first part of the road is considered dangerous, on account of the predatory habits of the people,\u2014who look dirty, hungry, and sullen. The proclamations show that the authorities are obliged to compromise with them a little in matters of local interest. At Tsiang-yang I saw a very interesting proclamation, too, upon the subject of opium, stating that it was all Patna, all came from Foochow, paid there in a single lump sum Tls. 2.496 a ball, (Tls. 100 a chest), should not be further taxed; that rogues were in the habit of selling en route, and then conveying inferior and illicit opium under cover of their warrants; and that in future only 12 days would be allowed within which the warrants or passports issued at Foochow must be surrendered at Fuh-ting.\n\nA tea-tax is collected at Pai-lin, which becomes a very busy place indeed during the influx of tea-purchasers in the spring.\n\nOpium, though not much, is grown in both Fuh-ting and Ha-p'u, but the authorities discourage its cultivation. At Tsiang-yang there was also a long telegraph proclamation, from which it appears that the K'\u00fcchow \u8862\u5dde route was\nselected in preference to the T'aichow \u53f0\u5dde and Wenchow route on account of the unsettled state of out-of-the-way coast districts of T'aichow.\n\nThe road to Foochow descends from the hills, and crosses at Yang-chia-ch'i \u694a\u5bb6\u6eaa a rivulet navigable for rafts; and I think from its appearance that probably a very strong current runs during the rainy season. The Ha-p'u district is entered about half a mile before arriving at Lung-ting. All the hills are either cultivated or covered with brushwood, but we did not see many trees, except bamboo, fir, and pine, until we reached Yang-chia-ch'i, 300 feet above the sea.\n\nOur next day's journey from Yang-chia to Funing \u798f\u5be7 Fu consisted of, first, a 20 li mount of 1,600 feet to Hu-p'ing \u6e56\u576a (1,900 feet); then a winding about for 20 li among paddy fields and tea and coir plantations to Tsaoi k'\u00eang \u7076\u5751; and lastly a gradual descent to the Funing plain, which is only a few feet above the sea level. At a village called Shui-m\u00ean-k'\u00eang \u6c34\u9580\u5751, a mile to the north of Tsao-k'\u00eang, we passed within a mile of sea water, and got a beautiful glimpse through a fine gorge or gulley (from which the place evidently takes its name) at what appeared to be a lagoon or enclosed sea, possibly the \"Li-shan\" channel of the charts. The ascent and descent were as fine from a scenic point of view as anything we saw the day before, but the plateau was somewhat tame. Several enormous banyan trees attracted my attention. One must have measured 50 feet in circuit, and cast a shade of at least an acre. Foochow is poetically called the \"Banyan City,\" probably on account of the marked magnificence of these trees in the province.\n\nI noticed a proclamation by the judge upon the subject of coolies fraudulently changing tea-boxes en route and adulterating tea intended for export abroad. I also observed notices in each village fixing the weight of official salt at 240 catties; the price at Yang-chia-ch'i was 5 cash a Chinese pound, and it was stated to come from Ch'\u00fcanchow (Chinchew) \u6cc9\u5dde and Hinghwa \u8208\u5316.\n\nAt Yang-chia-ch'i, Wenchow opium is smoked (which is singular, seeing that chiefly Patna is smoked at Fuh-ting), and fetches a dollar for three ounces. I saw a field or two of poppy coming up very well in both Fuh-ting and Fu-ning. Funing Fu is a very small city, and is not seen in\napproaching it from the north until you are upon it, as the foot of a hill juts out and conceals all its suburb (called locally Ni-ki-a \u4e8c\u6a4b\u4e0b) but one or two houses which look like a small village. There are here opium and salt lekin collectorates. A mile to the south-east is T'a-t'au-nwi \u5854\u982d\u5c3e, the port of Funing, with a pagoda. Shortly before reaching Funing, the road from the north appears to be leading to T'a-t'au-nwi, the two hills commanding the sea-exit from which stand out very prominently. Large junks and steam gunboats cannot, it is said, get nearer than within 10 li of the port, but I noticed junk masts at the port itself.\n\nFuning Fu is a long narrow town, in some places not more than 200 yards across from wall to wall. At one time the sea came up to the walls, but now the intervening plain is securely laid out for paddy. At one time, and, it appears in a measure, even until recently the city was a port of some importance, but Wenchow seems to have done a humble stone in killing its sea-trade. Notwithstanding this, the city looks fairly prosperous and busy, and the yamens are unusually imposing as viewed from the outside. Funing is the seat of an admiral, who has under him 1,000 \"braves,\" besides about 3,700 men, in seven divisions or ying, of regular troops or \"yeomanry\" (as I think they should be called).\n\nThe best evidence of the fact that the maritime trade of Funing is on the decline is the circumstance that Fukien (Hinghwa) salt is brought overland from Yen-t'ien \u8c50\u7530, 40 li nearer to Foochow, and costs 12 cash a catty, or double the price of the same salt at Fuh-ting. Opium is grown in most of the five districts under Funing, but accounts vary as to how far the poppy cultivation is discouraged; the local drug is said to be superior to that of Wenchow, but the presence of the latter proves that, as there is a demand for both that and Patna, any local supply must fall short of local needs.\n\nThe road from Funing to Foochow leads for a few miles up a narrow valley to the west, and then across a ridge 800 feet higher than the plain. The most interesting feature in this part are the Sia-po \u7d2b\u5a46 (the Wenchow Zik'abu) woman. Hundreds of these were met carrying loads of produce on poles. They are an extremely hardy-looking race, and all the\nmarried women wear a most peculiar head-dress, consisting first of all of a felt cap, cocked forward like a malt-factory stack, covering the twisted knot of hair at the back part of the crown. Over this is worn a lofty tiara or helmet, ornamented with small plates of silver in front; it is square as far as half-way up, and triangular at the top; a sort of fringe of red thread hangs on each side of this helmet, which seems to be supported behind only by the felt cone it half covers. The earrings are usually coarsely fashioned in silver, and broad gold or copper rings are worn on the fingers. The clothes in shape are not unlike those worn by the Tan-ka \u86c7\u5bb6 women of Canton, except that they are invariably made of an evidently homespun sleazy material, looking like an extremely fine coat of mail. The few Sia-k'a \u659c\u5ba2, or male Sias, I met were at first to me undistinguishable from the Hans or Chinese, the majority of whom wear a turban about here. However, it was pointed out to me that most of them had their back hair cut moderately short, and twisted into a half knot instead of a queue; it seemed to me also that their hair was rather very dark brown than black. All accounts agreed that they ate, married, buried, and lived generally like the Chinese, and were not at all averse to intermarrying with them, but that they did not marry persons of the same surname amongst themselves. There were only four surnames in Funing.\u2014Pwang \u87f2, Lang \u85cd, Loui \u96f7, and Chung \u937e, but no Pwangs in Lo-yuan \u7f85\u6e90 district.\n\nI have pointed out elsewhere that the Hak-kas \u5ba2\u5bb6 near Canton often call the Pun-tis Sha-p'o and Sha-lao \u86c7\u5a46\u4f6c, and that the Miao-tsz I met in Kweichow call the Chinese Shwa. Now, though different characters are locally used, there is one character \u86c7, \"a snake,\" which hits off from every etymological point of view the Hak-ka Sha, the Wenchow Zi, and the Foochow Sia; and it would therefore seem possible that the old race anciently occupying the hills of Y\u00fceh \u8d8a were once called by some such name. From the few examples given to me of their language, it is evident that they are essentially of Chinese stock, and that they speak a sort of mandarin dialect flavoured with that of Foochow, just as the Hak-kas speak a corrupted mandarin dialect flavoured with that of Canton. Owing to the suspicions which would have arisen had I endeavoured to\npersonally cross-question a woman, I was obliged to content myself with second-hand evidence.\n\nWe now descended a few hundred feet, and kept on an average high level, passing no place of any size, but winding through charming glen scenery, after which we descended once more into a small plain, crossed to the west a low ridge, and found ourselves at the port of Yen-t'ien, up to the very houses of which good-sized junks can moor. Since, some years ago, the mountain road from Funing by way of Ning-t\u00ea \u90a3\u5fb7 district city (160 li) to Lo-y\u00fcan district city (65 li) was infested by bandits, the sea route of 180 li from Yen-t'ien to Fei-lwan-tu \u98de\u6e7e\u6e21 and 40 li thence to Lo-y\u00fcan, has become a permanent institution; yet the literary chancellor on his rounds still takes the regulation land-route. I enjoyed immensely my five hours' voyage in a regular sea-going junk, though, owing to our having nothing on board but a few tons of stone ballast, I must say I felt relieved whenever a reef was taken in. We had such a magnificent breeze that we made what is called a day and a night's voyage between the hours of 4 and 9 p.m., and I was thus able to watch the configuration of the land. First we went south-west for about ten miles, past a lorcha gunboat lying at anchor, down a beautiful bay a mile to two miles broad, lined on both sides by hills prettily wooded and cultivated, passing small islets to the north and west. Then, for about twenty miles, we sailed down a broader bay due south, past a solitary rock and a considerable inlet running in or out due east. The weather was not now so clear, so that the hills on each side were not distinctly visible in detail, but the breadth of the bay appeared to be from 5 to 10 miles across. An island about two miles long formed a sort of gate to this bay, one narrow strait giving access to the south-east, and another which we took, much broader, to the south. Having got clear of a headland and a small island to our right, we turned southwest for about 10 miles having land at a distance of two or three miles on each side. Then we turned west, and land was only visible in the darkness to the left. Next morning when looking back from the heights ashore, I found we had come from the north-east in rounding our last promontory, and that, between this promontory and our land, there was still another inlet to the north, apparently\nfull of shallows at low water. I think this must lead to Ning-t\u00ea city. We were high and dry on the bank of a small tidal creek when I woke, lying off the market town and military picket station of Fei-lwan, belonging to Ning-t\u00ea district. The \"official\" price of a fifty-ton junk, worked by five men, for 60 miles was 600 cash, or, say, half-a-crown, but I added a dollar. These junks are admirably clean inside, and are fitted with very strong bulk-heads and watertight compartments.\n\nVery shortly after leaving Fei-lwan, we soon again began an ascent of the beautiful mountain pass bearing that name. We had a most superb view of the valley below, and of the sea route by which we had come, from a height of 1,750 feet. All along this pass there were, amongst other trees, some very fine specimens of the Pinus Bungeana (the same tree as the \"Big Trees\" or Wellingtonia gigantea of California), some of them twelve feet in circumference. It is a curious thing that the vulgar name for s\u00eeng, \"banyan,\" is pronounced s\u00eeng in Fukien, and the s\u00eeng or fir tree is distinguished from it only by the addition of the word pa (vulgar for paik) \"a cedar.\" There were still 150 feet to mount before we reached the highest point of 1,900 feet, shortly after which we commenced a descent into the lovely plain (as seen from above) of Lo-y\u00fcan, even steeper than our ascent on the other side. We found the Sia-po of this district somewhat different from those of Funing. The clothes were much alike, except that the women wore neat coils of cloth from the knee (and possibly higher) down to the ankle; these coils were often adorned at the lower end with a turn of gay ribbon or braid. Many of the women were bare-legged, but I was informed that they wore short trousers beneath their skirts; but anyhow the knee is often bare. The unmarried girls here and elsewhere wear no headgear over their twists or plaits, which appear to vary in style according to the taste of the subject. But the head dress was something really outrageous. The hair was gathered into a sort of long roll, projecting beyond the forehead and lying in a filigree silver boat, like a nutmeg grater. A stick or pin formed a sort of horn forward of this, to which was attached a small red flag or tassel. Above the boat was what looked like a red heel-less shoe reversed. Another arrangement of sticks extended nearly a foot behind,\nand supported a hollow silver horizontal half-moon or crescent, also of filigree, tapering at each end, and as thick as a man's thumb in the middle; and behind this, again, hung a red flag or curtain of cloth about four inches square. Possibly the bow is the origin of the crescent, and the quiver of the slipper. The women were very nimble in their movements as soon as they saw me, and gave me very little opportunity of examining them closely. At one spot we came across a Sia-po and Sia-k'a going through what looked like the gambols of Venus and Adonis on the high-road. She was doubled up in his lap, with her pointed head lying affectionately pillowed on his breast, and he was sitting down, clasping her with one hand and patting her hard little back with the other. She had just fallen and hurt herself badly, he said, and he was her husband. It was rather a touching sight, and though even a Chinaman could not have avoided assisting his wife in public had she met with a similar accident, there would hardly have been the same straightforward simplicity of attitude.\n\nThe Sia-k'a or male Sias twist their cloth above the ankle, like the women, round the shins, whilst the Chinese porters wear a much shorter cloth bound just round the ankle, as in Hukwang and Sz-ch'uan. The material out of which the men's clothes are made is often of the same sleazy stuff as that worn by nearly all the women. The coats are usually shorter than those worn by the male Chinese, and a very short pair of trowsers, scarcely bigger than bathing-drawers, is worn over the ordinary loose knee-breeches. Most of the men wear a sort of fillet or ring of cloth embracing the head and the coiled queue.\n\nA mile east of Lo-y\u00fcan city there is a small river which runs into the sea at Wu-li-k'ou \u4e94\u91cc\u53e3, 15 li away. Lo-y\u00fcan is supplied with Hinghwa salt brought in junks hither. The monopolists join interests with the likin offices, and charge 12 cash a catty in the city, though it is delivered at the port for 6 cash. Patna opium seems to be that most smoked, and its price runs very high, from Tls. 18 to Tls. 20 a ball, and less than an ounce for a dollar if bought retail. The Fukien authorities have evidently a closer grasp on taxable commodities than the people will submit to elsewhere. At Lo-y\u00fcan there is a very neat Roman Catholic Chapel just outside the north gate, and I found\nlater on that a still more extensive Protestant establishment was building next door to it inside the walls. There are about 1,000 Protestant converts in the neighbourhood, of all ages and both sexes, and as yet only 30 at Funing Fu. Not much native opium is grown in Lo-y\u00fcan, at least for sale, and Wenchow opium fetches a dollar for three ounces. Fu-ch'ing \u798f\u6e05 district is (it was stated) the one in Foochow Fu which grows the most. It was explained to me that the people are not yet expert at cultivating the drug, and that the services of P'ing-yang (Wenchow) men are usually requisitioned. Lo-y\u00fcan is, like Funing, a long narrow city at and round the toe of a hill. On the south and west, very fine mountains 2,000 and 3,000 feet high shut in the city; the east is open, and the north covered by the low hills over which we passed. The colonel in command has under him 300 troops.\n\nAt and from Funing the dialect, which had hitherto been mixed and unsatisfactory, developed into almost the pure Foochow tongue; but here the lisp is so strong that such words as sing, sik, are pronounced by many precisely like the English words thing, thick. Those peculiarities which I have explained elsewhere, under which the vowels, finals, and tones of all words radically change in combination according to fixed though locally unknown rules, exist in full force here. For instance, pa\u00f6k in the entering tone is \"north,\" but p\u00f6pieng (if uttered quickly) in the even tone is \"the North.\" This, as I have endeavoured to show, is nothing more nor less than the Sandhi, Vriddhi, and Guna of Sanskrit, as explained by Professor Max M\u00fcller. The Foochow dialect, though full of localisms, archaicisms, and vulgarisms, is one of the sweetest to the ear,\u2014even more so perhaps than the Pekingese; the tones and the lisps seem to impart to the speakers a somewhat languid or effeminate air, which, however, is not in accordance with their character.\n\nOn the whole the mountain scenery of this much of Fukien (except near the border) must be given a place distinctly ahead of that in any part of Chekiang. It is more varied, more accident\u00e9 (as the French say), or strongly marked; not so much heaped together; it is bigger, and rougher. Perhaps a circuit of 20 miles radius round Lo-y\u00fcan city would comprise the finest portions. I am\ntold that the road to Ning-t\u00e9 crosses mountains 3,500 feet in height. The road from Lo-y\u00fcan, past the Lien-kiang \u9054\u6c5f boundary (30 li) and Tan-yang \u4e39\u6d0b (20 li) in the Lien-kiang district, to T'ai-shih \u53f0\u5e02 (30 li), 80 li in all, keeps at an average height of 500 feet or so above the plains; never more than 800. But this stretch very strongly resembles the inland parts in the immediate neighbourhood of Ch'ungk'ing. There are few even small plains, and very little level ground. On all sides are to be seen fine mountains a dozen miles or so away, but the intervening space is an irregular congeries of mounds, terraced and given up to paddy, amongst which the road winds, ascends, and descends at every instant. The peculiarity of Ch\u00e9kiang scenery, a small valley surrounded by hills, ceases almost as soon as the frontier is crossed, until Foochow is thus nearly approached. At Tan-yang there is a large tea-tax office in charge of a deputy; apparently each district fattens on exported tea, of which even at this time numerous loads were being carried to Foochow. The crops in the ground, which was as a rule not yet cleared of its paddy roots, were rising wheat and vegetables. The tallow tree, here called k'\u00f6ing or k'\u00fcng-ch'eu, which had almost disappeared since we left Ch\u00e9kiang, began to grow common once more; also coir, maple, firs, pines, many kinds of bamboo, and a great many trees of which even the Chinese names were doubtful, such as p'ieu, ko\u00e4, &c.\n\nLeaving T'ai-shih the road runs for 10 li along a valley of the Ch\u00e9kiang type surrounded on all sides by hills. At P'an-tu \u6f58\u6e21 a river is crossed, which runs down over 300 li from parts of the Ping-nan \u5c4f\u5357 and Ku-t'ien \u53e4\u7530 districts to Lien-kiang city (30 li), and is navigable for mastless boats for a hundred li up. We followed the right bank of this river for a few miles west, and then left it to continue south-west and ascend the Hia-hu-ling. This pass runs at an average height of 1,500 feet for several miles to P\u00e8-ling \u5317\u5dba, whence from an elevation of 1,750 feet, a superb view of Foochow, Ku-shan, Pagoda Anchorage, Disraeli Rock, &c., &c., is obtained.\nARTICLE IV.\n\nA JOURNEY FROM FOOCHOW TO W\u00caNCHOW,\nTHROUGH CENTRAL FUKIEN.\n\nBY\n\nE. H. PARKER, Esq.\n\nI LEFT the Foochow bridge on the 29th of January 1883, and, passing through the well known and beautiful scenery of the Min, with its olive, lungan, and pear orchards, reached in one hour the picturesque old bridge called Hung-shan Ch'iao \u6d2a\u5c71\u6a4b, which, like the celebrated Foochow bridge, is occasionally partially carried away by the floods. At Hwai-an \u61f7\u5b89, ten miles from Foochow, a navigable branch river connects the Min with Ch'ang-loh \u9577\u6a02 district. The next place of any size passed is Chu-ch'i \u7af9\u5d0e (40 li), and we anchored at Ta-muh-k'i \u5927\u76ee\u6eaa, 40 li further up, having made 110 li in all during the half-day of six hours. The scenery was very pretty all the way. From Ta-muh-k'i the river winds in a general north-westerly direction past An-j\u00ean-k'i \u5b89\u4ec1\u6eaa (70 li) to Shui-k'ou \u6c34\u53e3 (40 li). This place is in the Ku-t'ien \u53e4\u7530 district, but the left bank a mile below is still in the Hou-kwan \u5019\u5b98 (Foochow) district, and the opposite or right bank belongs to the district of Min-ch'ing \u9593\u6e05. Some short time ago passenger steam-launches were allowed to run daily as far as Shui-k'ou, up to which place there seems to be plenty of water at all times, and very little obstruction from sand-banks; but above this progress is not so easy. The banks are exceedingly pretty, even in winter, though the hills are seldom more than 200 or 300 feet high. A stream, navigable for small boats, runs down from near the Min-ch'ing district city to the river Min, which it joins at Min-ch'ing-k'ou \u9593\u6e05\u53e3, 30 li below An-j\u00ean-k'i, where there is also a rivulet), and 70 li below Shui-k'ou. There does not seem to be very much trade on the river, except tea and firewood coming down from the country, and going upwards; in fact (apart from tea) the traffic is very\ninfluence, whether in trade or otherwise, is confined to a comparatively small area around Foochow, which appears to have been an unimportant provincial capital until filled into activity by the advent of foreigners.\n\nThe road to Hwang-t'ien \u9ec3\u7530 (50 li), the first of the four short stages to Yenp'ing Fu \u5ef6\u5e73\u5e9c, crosses at Ch'ao-t'ien-k'iao \u671d\u5929\u6a4b (10 li) the unnavigable rivulet which runs down from Ku-t'ien city. A ridge called Siu-ling \u79c0\u5dba, 700 feet above the river level, is then crossed, and at Ngo-yang \u8972\u6d0b, 30 li from Shui-k'ou, the road again descends to the main river side. Here I met Messrs. Baun and Gandil, Danish gentlemen superintending the erection by Honan braves of the poles and wires belonging to the new telegraph line, which had advanced thus far from Foochow and was proceeding at the rate of about a mile a day. Another constructing party was gradually meeting them from the north. They had had a little trouble with the people at one place a few miles lower down, but on the other hand there were here no explanatory proclamations posted up on the poles as was the case in Ch\u00eakiang. The line is double, and seems to follow the left river-bank where this is fairly straight; otherwise cutting across the hills. From Ngo-yang it is 20 li past Ku-k'ou \u8c37\u53e3 (10 li) to Hwang-t'ien. The river is very rocky all the way from Shui-k'ou, and in winter its channel is usually confined to a very small portion of the catchment area, which looks as if during the spring rains the navigation of it must be very intricate, full of rapids, and dangerous. Gunboats are then stationed at intervals along the banks in order to protect the tea-purchasers and tea-cargoes from robbers. The porters with me quoted Patna opium at $19, $24, and $25 the ball at Foochow, Yenp'ing Fu and Kienning \u5efa\u5be7 Fu respectively. At Shui-k'ou they paid 1,100 to 1,200 cash the ounce for the prepared drug, and 600 for native \"juice.\" Fu-an \u798f\u5b89 district, they said, produced by far the most opium in the province (which statement corroborates what the missionaries had told me), and the price there was 300 cash. Likin was charged, and confiscation the penalty for evasion. Some opium was also grown in Min-ch'ing and Ku-t'ien, but not much in the last-named district. Salt all comes from Fu-ch'ing \u798f\u6e05 district (Foochow Fu), and costs 16, 18, 24, 28, and 32 cash respectively at Foochow,\nMin-ch'ing, Shui-k'ou, Yenping and Kienning. The hill country between Shui-k'ou and Hwang-t'ien did not strike me as being much or carefully cultivated, and had in many places barely been cleared of brushwood; tea, however, is produced in Ku-t'ien district, and the porters said paid taxes amounting to $9 for fine and $4 for coarse the load, irrespective of distance. This hardly corresponds with the Tls. 2.2 and Tls. 1.6 of a previous informant, but the exchange tricks of tax-gatherers may account for the difference.\n\nThe second stage of 50 li between Hwang-t'ien and Ch'ing-feng \u6df8\u98a8 lies through the same class of country,\u2014hills covered with brush, and little in the way of cultivation but paddy in the hollows. The places passed are Y\u00fcn-ting \u96f2\u9802 (13 li), San-tu-k'ou \u4e09\u90fd\u53e3 (7 li), Ts'ang-hsia-t'ang \u50b3\u5cfd\u5858 (10 li), and Wu-pu-k'ou \u6b66\u6b65 (10 li), which last is 10 li from Ch'ing-feng, where the district of Nan-p'ing \u5357\u5e73 begins. Malwa opium is smoked as well as Patna at Hwang-t'ien, and was quoted at 600 cash the ounce (unprepared); prepared Patna cost 1,100 cash. I do not quite understand why this hill country is so thinly inhabited and little cultivated; possibly the production of fuel is found as profitable as tea, for little coal is used at Foochow, and large cargoes of fire-wood go down the river. The land-tax of Ku-t'ien district is about Tls. 18,000, though nothing of commercial importance is produced. The road between San-tu and Ts'ang-hsia skirts the river, which is now more than ever beset with savage black rocks standing upon very white sand. There are eighteen rapids in this short stretch; but, though one or two are dangerous to unskilful boatmen, they are trifles compared with those of the Yangtsze. Here, as on the Kung-t'an \u8ca2\u7058 River which runs from Kweichou province to Fuchou \u6f14\u5dde, the use of enormous stern sweeps, 80 to 100 feet in length, worked from a high bridge, is found necessary for steering. Near Wu-pu an unnavigable stream runs into the main river. The ten li thence to Ch'ing-feng are called \"long,\" and are indeed equal to twenty. There are no hang-chia \u884c\u5bb6 or road agents in this province as in Ch\u00eakiang, and the engaging of porters by private persons is not conducted on satisfactory principles. Fortunately for me the excellent wei-yuan sent from Foochow had authority to demand bearers at official\nrates at each stage, and to lodge me in the hsing-tai \u884c\u81fa, or \"Dak bungalows,\" used by the literary chancellor, otherwise I should have found considerable difficulty in getting along without delay, annoyance, and extortion.\n\nThe next 50 li march to Kin-sha \u91d1\u6c99 was a comfortless plod in heavy rain, but as long as it is possible to induce porters to travel, the weather may well be given secondary consideration, for a whole day's stay in any possible Chinese lodging-house is just as comfortless as a wet journey. Feng-ch'ing is 1,500 feet above the river, and the places between it and Kin-sha are Lung-yuan \u9f8d\u6e90 (10 li), Pai-sha \u767d\u6c99 (10 li), Ngo-k'i \u5cb3\u6eaa (5 li), Ch'a-yang \u8336\u6d0b (10 li), and Hu-lu-shan \u8377\u84ee\u5c71 (10 li), which is 5 li from Kin-sha. These stages are always called p'wo \u9928 (Pekingese p'wo), or the German Stunde, and the word tang \u5858 is usually suffixed to the official territorial name. In the latter half of the journey we followed the left river-bank. There was nothing new to notice either on land or river, except that the current of the latter looked very rapid, probably the more so by reason of the last night's steady rain. An unpleasant incident occurred to me on the way. As I was walking along amongst the hills, I observed an abandoned-looking dog crouching suspiciously by the road side, and whilst I was speculating upon his sanity, he deliberately walked up and seized me by the leg; fortunately for me I was sufficiently on the alert to save my skin at the expense of my trousers and of my only weapon, an open umbrella, the sudden transformation of which at one swoop into rags and splinters served to mystify the dog until the coolies drove him off.\n\nThere are no Sia-po \u90aa\u5a46 anywhere along this route, nor are there any of those fine large-footed Han \u6f22, or Chinese, women who are employed in such large numbers as public scavengers in and about Foochow. These, like the Sia-po, are somewhat extravagant in their head-dress, and their earrings especially, but, though bizarre, the head-dress has nothing essentially non-Chinese about it. It has, and they have, the appearance of having been toned down from Sia-po to Ilan. The views previously expressed by me as to the \"snake\" origin of the Sia received a remarkable confirmation at Foochow. I was enquiring of an official (who had of course never heard of the Shwa, Sha, and Zi of the Miao-tsz, Hakkas, and Wenchow people) whether the\nscavenger women were in any way related to the \"heterodox\" women or Sia. He said \"No; they are stated \"to be Sie \u86c7, or snakes (not Sia-po), the ancient race which \"dwelt in Wu-chu \u7121\u8af8 country during the Han times.\" Now this striking if not quite correct impromptu statement appears to me to confirm the speculative view I expressed regarding the generic application of the word snake, the identity of the Shwa, Sha, Sia, and Zi, and the historical reasons for the deduction.\n\nThe fifty li to the ferry opposite Yenping Fu are over comparatively level ground, the places passed being Kih-k'\u0131 \u5409\u6eaa, An-tsi \u5b89\u6e13, Ma-li \u9ebb\u68a8, and Shih-li-an \u5341\u91cc\u5eb5. The scenery became more beautiful as we advanced, until it reached a climax at Yenping, grandly situated at the foot of lofty (then slightly snow-clad) mountains, at the junction of the two rivers running down from Kienning and Shaowu \u90b5\u6b66 prefectures. I could not have believed, had I not witnessed with my own eyes, the difference one single night's rain could make in the river. From a clear narrow stream winding its way through a broad, sandy, and rocky bed, it had changed to a broad muddy sluice, filling every inch of space, covering the highest rocks, and absorbing all rapids into one great current running six miles an hour at least. No doubt up-country rains must have had a greater effect than local ones in producing this metamorphosis. At Kih-k'\u0131 a mountain stream which could be jumped over at ordinary times had to be crossed in boats amid the branches of a forest of tall trees.\n\nYenping Fu is a rustic sort of city; unpopulous, and apparently without anything artificial of striking interest or value, either inside the walls or outside amongst the villages. Two pagodas as usual crown the nearest hills. The main street had just been partially rebuilt after a fire, and the river was now up to the walls; the rest of the town appeared to be the usual collection of tumble down shanties and pigstyes. I occupied the best room at an inn which for filth, darkness, and intimacy with pigs reminded me of Szechuan experiences. The neighbourhood seems to produce nothing in particular of commercial value; but a few miles north, on the way to Kienning, dense tea-plantations begin to occupy the mountain sides, the land having now become more suitable therefor. Patna\nopium was quoted at Yenping at Tls. 24 the ball, or at the rate of nearly \u00a3200 sterling the chest. Retail, the prepared drug cost 1,200 cash, or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a tael, the ounce, or at the rate of \u00a3370 the chest. Malwa, which on enquiry turns out to be \"false Malwa from Wenchow,\" was quoted at 520 and 800 cash the ounce unprepared and prepared respectively. Salt from Foochow by boat was about 20 cash the catty. Cotton was imported from Foochow, and the women spun no yarn. Silk goods also came from Foochow. So far, Fukien strikes me as being (apart from tea and salt, which are its great wealth and tax-producing commodities) quite as poor a province as Kweichow.\n\nThe road from Yenping to Kienning crosses the river again at the east end of the town (Shui-tung \u6c34\u6771) and once more at K'iu-tun \u576a\u58a9 (10 li), taking a northeasterly direction past Shang-king \u4e0a\u4eac (10 li) and Kau-tung \u9ad8\u6850 (10 li) to Ta-heng \u5927\u6a2a (10 li). The local brogue of Yenping was quite incomprehensible to me, but the Foochow dialect seemed to be pretty generally understood. The commonest tree along the road thus far from Foochow is the maple, which is usually called pien \u7562 (Pekingese pien) in this province. Just at this time the peach and plum blossoms were coming out, and occasionally we saw a fine camphor tree, but the hills generally are covered with bamboos, fir, pine, long grass, and scrub.\n\nThe second 40 li stage between Ta-heng and T'ai-ping \u592a\u5e73 was again travelled in the wet; the direction was still north-east; the places passed were Wu-li-pai \u4e94\u91cc\u724c (the frontier village of Kien-an district \u5efa\u5b89); then across a creek to Fang-ts'un \u623f\u6751 (10 li), with a likin office, L\u00fc-k'ou \u8386\u53e3 (10 li), and Pa-sien \u516b\u4ed9, which is 10 li from T'ai-ping. All these places are poverty-stricken villages of the third or fourth order, like all others without exception between Foochow and Kienning. Nearly opposite Pa-sien, however, there is a very large village called Ta-ma-k'ou (?) \u5927\u9ebb\u53e3, and I had also noticed one equally large opposite An-tsi; indeed I saw several away on the right bank. This road is the highroad to Peking, but with the exception of the official hostelries, which are at the disposal of any one with money or influence, there is no decent accommodation for man,\u2014beasts there are none,\u2014of any kind on the highroad, i.e., the\nbridle path. I could not get flour or sugar when I enquired for some, and even pork is only occasionally seen. Opium dens abound everywhere, and as in Ch\u00e8kiang seem to sap the wealth and life of the lower orders. The idleness, delay, thriftlessness and poverty induced by opium-smoking is much more apparent here than in Szechuan, for of course 800 and 1,200 cash an ounce is a very different thing from 200 and 300,\u2014not to mention the different physical effects of the foreign and native drug. The absolute want of everything else in the way of pleasure, comfort, amusement, quiet, privacy, and luxury is quite sufficient to account for the charm which this indulgence, coupled with that of gaming, exercises upon the Chinese imagination. Except in such great centres as Canton, Foochow, Hankow, &c., I have never seen in China anything so nearly approaching household comfort as is to be met with in the villages near Peking.\n\nThere was still nothing of novelty to remark during the day's journey, except that the deep red-soiled tea-plantations became more numerous, and that the river bed was not so completely covered over by the freshet. Judging from the height of the villages above the river, I think the level must occasionally be 20 feet higher than it is now, but the flood disappears as quickly as it comes, and this fact points to a very rapid fall in the ground level. I made out Yenping to be between 400 and 500 feet higher than Foochow (400 li), whilst Ch'ungk'ing (4,500 li) is only 800 feet above Shanghai. The people along the road are only moderately curious; they seem ignorant; resigned, if not contented; quietly and (for Chinese) kindly disposed; rather spiritless, and lacking in intelligence; but not so greedy for gain and so quarrelsome as is usually the case. The road for the 40 li from Tai-p'ing to Kienning Fu runs nearly all the way along the right bank of the river, which is very tortuous just here. The places passed are Sie-k'eng \u8b1d\u5751 (10 li), Pau-en \u5831\u6069 (10 li), Liu-k'eng \u5289\u5751 (10 li), and Ch'eng-si \u57ce\u897f (10 li), which is just opposite Kienning. The scenery improves, whilst remaining of much the same character as heretofore; the snow on some of the higher mountains near the city sets off the red tea slopes and the dense masses of young fir and scrub. At Pau-en I noticed a proclamation calling for strong, non-opium-smoking braves for the defence of Foochow,\u2014payment Tls. 4.2 a\nmonth. The usual telegraph proclamations were to be seen,\u2014one by the Tartar-general, viceroy, and governor, a second by the trade board and special board, and a third and fourth by the local civil and military authorities.\n\nKienning Fu is situated on the point formed by the two rivers running down from Sung-k'i \u6851\u6eaa (180 li) district city, and from P'u-ch'\u00eang \u6d66\u57ce (about 350 li) and Kien-yang \u5efa\u967d (120 li) district cities. The excellent quarters allotted to me were on the right bank of the latter, and were apparently the embryo offices of the new telegraph company, as coils of wire and busy clerks seemed to testify. All the way from where I met the Danes, tarred poles were lying at intervals in readiness for erection, but here they were already up, though the wires were not yet attached. An extra proclamation hurrying the workers on was posted, and inn-keepers were ordered to turn out all other guests in favour of the telegraph cavalcade.\n\nThe largest sized tea-boats do not go higher than Kienning, above which another class of barge travels. All boats on this river are of a gingerbread character, and appear to be constructed in a curve, probably in consequence of the frequent bumps they get. There is a saying on the river, Chai sung t'ie(k) su\u00f6 (k)ung \u7d19\u8239\u9298\u68a2\u516c, which at once illustrates the popular view of the boats, the importance of the stern \"sweep,\" and the irregularity of the language. In this dialect not only are all tones and vowels subject to what may be called grammatical inflection, but all initials and finals may, under certain circumstances, be left out.\n\nWe crossed the river on starting from Kienning, and again at Pei-tsin \u5317\u6d25 (20 li), passing Si-ch\u00ean-ts'un \u897f\u93ae\u6751 (10 li). Thence we cut across a bend to Yeh-fang \u8449\u574a (20 li), passing Kiao-k'i \u4ea4\u6eaa (10 li). These absurdly short stages of 40 and 50 li a day shew that the Fukienese are no travellers. The scenery consisted of the usual fir and brushwood clad hills, interspersed with red patches devoted to tea. One of the chair-bearers, a scarred veteran who had fought under General Tso Tsung-t'ang in ten provinces, gave me some valuable general information. He said that the four districts under Funing Fu, namely Fu-an, Siu-ning \u50e7\u5be7, Ning-t\u00ea \u5be7\u5fb7, and Ha-p'u \u971e\u6d66 were the only ones in North Fukien which seriously produced opium, and that Fu-an was a long way the first. In the South,\nChangchow \u6f33 and Ch'\u00fcanchow \u6cc9 (Chinchew) prefectures grew the poppy successfully. He said that the soil in the rest of Fukien was too \"salt\" \u54b8, and that opium would never succeed unless human ordure and urine (the chief Chinese fertilisers) were withheld for three years, and the ground sweetened at the same time with lime. Ch\u00eakiang native opium was the only home sort imported into Fukien, but Kiangsi and Hukwang took the Szechuan and Shansi drug. The T'ai-p'ing rebels had only ravaged three prefectures in Fukien, the seven district cities under Changchow in the south (but not Amoy), the four under Shao-wu in the west, and five of the seven under Kienning, the two which escaped being Ou-ning \u9075\u5be7 and Kien-an, the two prefectural districts. The rebels surrounded the city for 32 days, and blew breaches into the walls several times, but never succeeded in getting in. In Ch\u00eakiang the prefectural city of K'\u00fcchow \u8862 escaped, as well as those of T'aichow \u53f0 and W\u00eanchow \u6e29.\n\nKienning is the seat of a brigadier, who has under him a colonel stationed at Yenping Fu, the seat of the Taotai. The city is, and looks from the outside, better built and more populous than Yenping, but seems to have no important trade (apart of course from salt and tea); but considerable business is done in lotus-seeds, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. The double telegraph line is complete from Kienning northwards, and runs along the right bank as far as Kien-yang. This portion does not seem to have been so carefully laid as the Foochow section.\n\nWe accomplished 80 li in one day between Yeh-fang and Kien-yang district city; the aspect of the country was the same,\u2014still very little cultivation, and the hills somewhat lower. The river is not as a rule more than 100 yards broad, and it is, as before, very full of rocks. In leaving Kienning we walked over a soft mud road 20 feet above the river, which had been but the day before flowing over it. The places passed between Yeh-fang and Kienyang, at distances of 10 li, are Nan-ling \u5357\u5dba, F\u00eang-loh \u8c50\u6a02, Chung-h\u00eang \u4e2d\u6a6b, Hwang-k'ou \u9ec3\u53e3, past the boundary to Ch'ang-t'wan \u9577\u6e4d, Wu-tun \u5433\u58a9, and Pai-ch'a \u767d\u69ce. Between Hwang-k'ou and Ch'ang-t'wan there is a large village called Kin-p'an \u91d1\u76e4 with an official resting house. I should have been greatly at a loss for both\nlodging and porters had it not been for the *wei-y\u00fcan*. Kien-yang was partly destroyed by the rebels, but has now a closely-built appearance from the outside. It is situated on the left bank of the river which runs down from Ma-sha \u9ebb\u6c99 sub-district city (60 li), and on the right bank of a river running from Ch'ung-an \u5d07\u5b89 district city (120 li). The first river is crossed by a most picturesque roofed bridge, nearly a quarter of a mile long, and well paved with stones; the city is on the spit formed by the two rivers, and a bridge of boats attached to each bank and to each other by two strong iron chains then crosses the Ch'ung-an river. A brook running westwards joins this latter river a few hundred yards further up, and the telegraph poles, with the high road to P'u-ch'eng, follows this brook up for about 20 li. Our direction was north-east for 50 li, and then east for the remaining 20 li of the day's journey. The places passed were Pai-t'a \u767d\u5854 (15 li), Ts'ih-ku-tien \u4e03\u59d1\u5e97 (15 li), Ma-y\u00fcan \u9ebb\u6e90 (30 li), An-k'ou \u5b89\u53e3 (10 li), J\u00fcn-shan \u4ec1\u5c71 (10 li); and between Ma-y\u00fcan and An-k'ou, where the Ou-ning district is again entered, a ridge about 500 feet higher than the adjacent plains is crossed. From the other or north-east side of this ridge a rivulet takes its source and runs east: we crossed shortly afterwards at An-k'ou another forming itself more from the north. This last joins the river which runs down from P'u-ch'eng at Ying-t'ou \u8425\u5934, our journey's end (70 li in all). Opposite Ying-t'ou is a very large village containing 4,000 or 5,000 houses called Shui-ch'i \u6c34\u6eaa, and the distance by river from this place to Kienning is only 120 li, 70 li shorter than the official high road travelled by us. No trouble seems to have been taken northwards from Kienning to avoid interfering with private rights in setting up the telegraph poles, which are again posted with proclamations, and are stuck right in the middle of the paddy-fields between the hills on each side. At Kien-yang the floods had swept down several posts carelessly planted too near the river, and the wires were twisted together and lying across the road. Both here and at Kienning, where there is usually also a bridge of boats at the place we crossed by ferry, the bridges are unsafe when the river is much swollen, and they are then swung back along the banks for safety.\n\nThere were of course a great many tea hills to be seen,\nbut not so many as I expected; a large proportion were abandoned or unsuccessful. It appears that the plant becomes exhausted after 20 years, and that its seventh year is usually its best. The trade has not flourished lately, as the supply has been greatly in excess of the demand. At An-k'ou I saw a notice issued last year by the tea-hongs stating that both foreigners and natives had lost on the new season's teas, and threatening with a fine of Tls. 1,000 any storing-house which should pay duty for any planter or owner after the 8th moon, by which date all bonds must be handed in. The meaning I take to be this. The supercargo does not pay duty en route, but gives a bill, which is taken up by the tea guild at Foochow and honoured on arrival and claim of the tea. If the tea be lost on the voyage, of course no one applies to (so to speak) take it out of bond. The finest tea comes from Ch'ung-an (Bohea Hills \u6b66\u5f5d\u5c71), and the commonest from Shaowu. The country prices for the fine teas range from Tls. 10 to Tls. 85 a picul, and there are \"two payments and two examinations, \u96e8\u8d77\u5169\u9a57,\" on the way. The accounts differ as to the amounts per picul for which bills are given at each paying station, and as to which those places severally are, but they agree that an average of about Tls. 2 a pecul is what in effect is charged for duty and likin on tea,\u2014say a penny a pound; the effect of this penny is probably quite as onerous as the sixpence levied in England. The telegraph should be of great value to the planters in future.\n\nNorth of Yenp'ing periodical markets are held in the villages every three, five, or ten days. The larger ones are called hui, and perhaps resemble the Pekingese hui \u6703. The ordinary ones are called h\u00fc \u5834, as around Canton,\u2014the same as the ch'ang \u5834 of Szechuan. Even in England legal sale in market-overt can only take place on certain days of the week, unless ancient charter allows of daily market-overt, as is the case in the City of London.\n\nFrom Ying-t'ou to Ma-lan \u9ebb\u5dd6 we followed pretty closely the telegraph poles along the tortuous right bank of the P'u-ch'eng River, which is here not so rocky nor so beset with rapids as I expected to find it; the main direction was north-east. The places passed were Kung-tun \u8ca2\u58a9 (6 li), Hwui-lung \u8ff4\u9f8d (10 li), and Hu-chow \u6f22\u6d32 (10 li), which is 15 li from Ma-lan, all in the Ou-ning district. I noticed\nthat in this part of Fukien the graves are often dug horizontally in the sides of the hills, and resemble the much-talked of but far more elaborate Man-tsz-tung \u883b\u5b50\u6d1e of Szechuan, which it now strikes me for the first time must have been graves rather than residences. There seems to be plenty of sport in the country, but I never saw any water fowl. At Kien-yang we met a party of hunters and dogs with three wild pig; at one place we saw a (?) wild cat \u732b, said to be good eating, exposed for sale, and I started several pheasants, and bought a (?) capercailzie \u7af9\u96de. At Kung-tun we saw a huge performing black bear caught in the neighbourhood of Tsinan \u6fdf\u5357 Fu; my servants recognized the Shantung man in charge as an old acquaintance, he having previously exhibited at Wenchow.\n\nThe boundary of the P'u-ch'\u00eang district is crossed at a distance of 20 li from Ma-lan, the direction being still north-east, and the village of Tsiang-k'i \u8523\u6eaa (10 li) being passed on the way. The road then turns north-west, and follows up a branch of the P'u-ch'\u00eang River, navigable for small boats for another 30 li. The main stream comes from P'u-ch'\u00eang (80 li) past Chiu-kwan \u85e4\u7ba1, a little north-east from the junction, and the road then quits it for a while. At a place called Y\u00fc-lin-kau \u70cf\u6797\u6a4b, 10 li higher up the branch from the junction, still another, but unnavigable, stream joins it from the west, and the road crosses this stream and then follows the main branch as far as the considerable village of Shih-pi-kai \u77f3\u9642\u8857, 50 li from Ma-lan. Large villages are thickly dotted over the small and now better cultivated bits of plain enclosed between the hills, and both road and river are said to be very busy during the tea season, when thousands of Kiangsi labourers cross the frontier to aid in picking and rolling the leaf, which is purchased in driiblets in the villages by the Cantonese dealers from Foochow. Though filth and dilapidation are as much the rule here as farther south, yet the country appears more prosperous the more north one travels from Yenping. Innumerable telegraph proclamations were here again everywhere seen, some explaining that the line was intended to defeat the aims of outsiders.\n\nIn one or two places tariffs were already published: ten cents a word to Lan-ch'i \u862d\u6eaa or Kienning; 11 to Shao-hing and Hangchow; 12 to Nan-zing, Wu-si \u7121\u932b, Ch'\u00fcan-\nchow \u6cc9\u5dde, Ningpo, and Soochow; 13 to Shanghai, Chin-\nkiang, and Changchow \u6f33\u5dde; 14 to Swatow and Yang-\nchow; 16 to Tsi-ning \u6f6e\u5be7; 17 to Nanking and Tientsin;\n18 to Taku and Wusung. When the whole line was open,\nmessages would be conveyed gratis for ten days. All the\nway from Foochow there were posted proclamations against\ngaming, especially at hwa-hwei \u82b1\u6703, and frequent notices\nwarning tea-dealers not to travel without an escort of braves,\nwhich the authorities would always detach free of charge.\nCertainly the government appears to take pains to foster the\ntea trade, which now embraces all Fukien north of Shui-k'ou.\n\nThe eighty li from Shih-pi-kai to P'u-ch'\u00eang were the\nmost interesting of this on the whole rather uninteresting\nroute. The level of P'u-ch'\u00eang is over 1,000 feet above that\nof Foochow and over 250 feet above that of Shih-pi. The\ngradual rise is manifest from this last point to Pai-chia-\nshih \u767d\u5bb6\u5e02 (20 li). A ridge 500 feet high called Ta-hu-\nling \u5927\u6e56\u5dba is then crossed, and the villages of Shih-ling\n\u77f3\u5dba (10 li) and Lin-kiang \u81e8\u6c5f (15 li) are passed. A second\nsteeper and very beautiful ridge covered with tall firs called\nLin-kiang or Si-yang-ling \u5915\u694a is then ascended and descended.\nThe next places are Y\u00fc-hwei \u4f59\u5efb (10 li), Hia-sha \u4e0b\u6c99 (10 li),\nand Kiu-ts'iu \u4e5d\u79cb (8 li), which is 7 li from P'u-ch'\u00eang.\nAt Kiu-ts'iu we came upon the river which we had left\nat Ma-lan, and which is navigable for one and two ton boats\nup to the city. The two sources of this river enclose P'u-\nch'\u00eang on the east and west, and are both crossed by\ngood bridges. The villages passed during the day were\nvery much larger and more prosperous-looking than any-\nthing yet seen in Fukien; the people seemed well-fed and\nhealthy; more of the flat land, of which there were\nlarger stretches, was under cultivation, and P'u-ch'\u00eang,\nthough damaged by the rebels, is as considerable a town\nas either Yenp'ing Fu or even (as regards area, at least,)\nKienning Fu. It is well situated in a small plain sur-\nrounded by fine hills; has a striking pagoda, and is\ngenerally a place of importance. The products are tea\n(of which, however, we saw almost none on the hills), lotus-\nnuts, bamboo-shoots, &c.\n\nAt Lin-kiang and Hia-sha we crossed two good-sized\nrivers, rising west and running into the P'u-ch'\u00eang river\nfarther to our cast. The very fine covered-in Lin-kiang\nbridge was used as a market. We must have crossed or seen on the day's journey at least twenty roofed bridges over creeks and gulleys. The road from Shih-pi to P'u-ch'\u00eang is excellent, though the stones are somewhat rough for walking; indeed from Kienning northwards the road ceases to be the rambling path-way which it is further south. The rice crops over a large tract of north Fukien had failed last year for want of rain, and were still standing withered in certain places; instead of being planted with wheat, vegetables, or hemp, the paddy-land in Fukien seems to lie idle during the winter; from a pecuniary point of view, therefore, it would be advantageous to introduce the poppy, that is, if the ground would stand it. The people all the way from Foochow to P'u-ch'\u00eang were quite as quiet and civil as in Chekiang, and, though perhaps more thriftless and ignorant, struck me as being more confiding and warm-hearted than any Chinese I had met before. I had no escort but the wei-yuan for any part of the way except for 40 li north from Yenping Fu, and I doubt whether I should have been in any way unpleasantly molested even without the wei-yuan. I had always heard and read of Fukien and Chekiang as the places where the people were most \"ferocious,\" and I have on the contrary found them the least offensive.\n\nPatna at P'u-ch'\u00eang costs $8.20 a catty raw, and $1 for 1.2 oz. prepared. Malwa costs $1 for 1.85 oz. raw, and for 1.2 oz. or 1.4 oz. prepared, accordingly as it is or is not adulterated with Patna dross. Both sorts come from Foochow alone. Wen-chow drug is not allowed to be imported or sold. Tea passing into Chekiang pays Tls. 2.8.8, or, with scale charges, $5 a pecul duty and lekin, and this even though its original cost be only $1 a pecul, as it in fact is. Tea used until very recently to pass through P'u-ch'\u00eang from Ch'ung-an to Chekiang, but now the heavy taxation completely drives it away. I ascertained at P'u-ch'\u00eang the exact charges on tea for Foochow per picul. They are as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Likin} & : \\quad \\text{Tls. } 0.195 \\\\\n\\text{Duty} & : \\quad \\text{Tls. } 0.392 \\\\\n\\text{Scale} & : \\quad \\text{Tls. } 0.072 \\\\\n\\text{Rations} & : \\quad \\text{Tls. } 0.628 \\\\\n\\text{Extra Likin} & : \\quad \\text{Tls. } 0.700 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTls. ..... 1.867\n\nplus 2 cash a box for the Orphanage at Yenping.\nplus 14.4% on duty } added,\u2014say 30% on Tls. 1.2.\n\n,, 16.6% on likin\n\nFukien salt (known as Ch\u00eakiang salt) brought from Fukien by sea to Wenchow, and by river thence to Ch\u2018uchow \u8655\u5dde and Lung-ch\u2018\u00fcan \u9f8d\u6cc9, is charged 2 cash a catty on crossing the Fukien frontier, and sells at P\u2018u-ch\u2018\u00eang for 22 cash. The same salt, brought through Fukien, and inferior in quality or adulterated, is called \u201cclandestine,\u201d and sells a little lower. Thus the Fukien authorities hold salt, tea, and opium in an iron grasp.\n\nThe next day\u2019s journey was a complete puzzle to me, and it appears that, owing to the imperfection of maps, I have wandered far out of my way. I might have gone from Kienning 180 li by land or river to Sung-k\u2018i district city, and thence 80 li across the border to K\u2018ing-y\u00fcan \u5ee3\u5143 district city of Ch\u00eakiang. Instead of this, I went 360 li from Kienning to P\u2018u-ch\u2018\u00eang, and found that this place was distant 160 li from Sung-k\u2018i, 180 li from Lung-ch\u2018\u00fcan, and 220 from K\u2018ing-y\u00fcan. So little is known of the border, that I only found one man (the veteran chair-bearer previously mentioned) all the way from Foochow who even knew the bare names of Lung-ch\u2018\u00fcan and K\u2018ing-y\u00fcan. At P\u2018u-ch\u2018\u00eang the magistrate declined and the wei-y\u00fcan, knowing which way I had resolved to go, perforce accepted the responsibility of sending me to such an out-of-the-way place as Lung-ch\u2018\u00fcan; and when we actually did start, not one of the bearers, soldiers or police escort had ever been to either city. Yet I found a thickly populated and prosperous country, and an excellent level road through the mountains.\n\nPassing round the wall of the city, and leaving to the north the telegraph and high road to K\u2018\u00fcchow \u8862\u5dde, we turned east, and crossed by a long plank bridge, ingeniously built on piers consisting of simply two crossed trees, a river (5 li) which runs down from F\u00eang-ling \u6a2a \u6797 the military border station 60 li to the north. Five li from the last named river, we crossed at So-p\u2018o \u6f31 \u6865 another river running down from Fou-lou-k\u2018iao \u6d6e \u697c \u6865; these rivers join at the south gate of P\u2018u-ch\u2018\u00eang. Five more li brought us to the low ridge called Mu-ling-t\u2018ou \u5bcc \u6797 \u5934, and 15 li further on south-east we came to the sub-district town Fu-ling \u5bcc \u6797, a salt likin station, where we crossed\na river which enters the P'u-ch'\u00eang river 90 li below P'u-ch'\u00eang, at a place called Ta-shih-k'i \u5927\u77f3\u6eaa, which is 60 li above the point where we had left the river two days previously near Chiu-kwan \u820a\u95dc. Leaving Fu-ling, we followed the left bank a little, and again crossed twice, reaching the village of Kwan-chwang \u5b98\u5e84, 15 li from Fu-ling. Then the river divides at Nan-k'ou-t'ang \u5357\u53e3\u5858, the last (or first) Fukien salt station; the main branch, running down from Ts'ien-yang \u524d\u6d0b, disappearing to our left. We cross the smaller stream, running from Ch\u00eang-k'\u00eang \u912d\u5751, at the Nan-k'ou likin station, and continue to keep pretty close to the left bank as far as Ts'ien-yang, 70 li from P'u-ch'\u00eang, and 15 li from the Lung-ch'\u00fcan frontier. Thus it is evident that the provincial boundaries are fixed by the watersheds. The mountain scenery throughout this day's journey was exceedingly fine; the people sturdy and healthy looking; and the flat parts of the country closely cultivated, and thickly dotted with villages.\n\nShortly after leaving Ts'ien-yang the road to Lung-ch'\u00fcan branches off to the north, the road to K'ing-y\u00fcan continuing south 160 li from Ts'ien-yang. K'ing-y\u00fcan is only 80 li from Sung-k'i in Fukien, which is 180 li from Kiennung; there is, I was assured, no water communication of any sort at K'ing-y\u00fcan with any place whatever. K'ing-y\u00fcan is 180 li from Lung-ch'\u00fcan, and 180 li also from Pa-tu \u516b\u90fd, the end of our second day's journey from P'u-ch'\u00eang, and 60 li from Ts'ien-yang. The frontier of Fukien and Ch\u00eakiang is at Hwa-k'iao \u82b1\u6a4b, 15 li from Ts'ien-yang. All on one side of the bridge belongs to Fukien, and all on the other to Ch\u00eakiang, the right bank of the brook belonging to Lung-ch'\u00fcan and the left to K'ing-y\u00fcan. Hwa-k'iao is 1,500 feet above the sea, and uninterrupted raft navigation is possible from thence to Foochow. An ascent instantly begins as far as Kung-ts'un \u8cb4\u6751, 2,000 feet (5 li), in the K'ing-y\u00fcan district, and 5 li further is the considerable village of Wu-tu-liu \u4e94\u90fd\u5289, belonging to Lung-ch'\u00fcan, 1,750 feet. We now follow one of the earliest sources of the Wenchow River for 15 li, and, crossing a low ridge, suddenly find ourselves upon a large town called Mu-tui-k'ou \u6c34\u982d\u53e3, situated on the left bank of a good-sized stream navigable for rafts. We cross and re-cross this last several times, and follow\ni down 15 li as far as Pa-tu which is the highest point to which the Ch'uchow salt boats can come. About a mile above Pa-tu, another stream from the north-west joins the Lung-ch'\u00fcan river, and gives it volume sufficient to carry one-ton boats. The mountain scenery even surpassed that of the day before, and I was more than ever surprised at the populousness of the district, many of the villages in which are larger, I am told, than K'ing-y\u00fcan city, which, like all of the ten districts subject to Ch'uchow Fu, except the prefectural (Li-shui \u9e97\u6728) district and that of Ts'ing-t'ien \u9752\u7530, is unwalled. Four rivers take their rise from the range of hills forming what is known as the Sien-hia-ling \u4ed9\u971e\u5dba. A man can take his choice whether he will go thence, in a boat or on or raft, direct to Kewkiang, Foochow, Wenchow, or Hangchow.\n\nFrom Pa-tu, where we crossed the river, to Lung-ch'\u00fcan it is 60 li, still in a north-westerly direction, but before the road reaches the first considerable village, Pu-t'ou \u5351\u982d (15 li), it leaves the river bank and does not meet it again until the city of Lung-ch'\u00fcan is entered. At Sung-k'\u00fc \u677e\u6e20, 5 li beyond Pu-t'ou, a small stream, which we cross, runs down to the main river from the north-west. For 5 more li, as far as Kau-ta-m\u00ean \u9ad8\u5927\u9580, we follow up a second tributary rivulet, which runs down from the north-east, and mounting gradually, pass Yuan-k'\u00eang \u5143\u5751 5 li and Sin-ling \u65b0\u5dba 5 li, 2,000 feet. At Niu-k'ou-ling \u725b\u53e3\u5dba, 1,700 feet, 5 li further, we come across a new stream from the north-west, and follow the right bank down to Lung-ch'\u00fcan (15 li) where we cross it by a beautifully paved, roofed, and panelled bridge, elegantly supported on untrimmed trees. A short distance above this bridge, yet another river joins the Niu-k'ou tributary, which meets the main river at Lung-ch'tian, where there is now a considerable volume of water, the result of all these contributions. Lung-ch'\u00fcan city is (subject to meteorological change affecting the aneroid) 1000 feet above the sea. The district produces almost nothing for export beyond lumber and a fine hard bamboo, which is taken in bundles of slips all the way to Shaohing for making into fans. Nothing comes from Fukien, for the simple reason that everything is so highly taxed that the object is rather to keep out or to tax Ch\u00eakiang produce. Malwa is the only opium smoked in the district, and of course it comes from Lan-ch'i\nvia Ch'uchow; it was quoted to me at $19 the 50 ounces raw, or 600 cash an ounce prepared. Two sorts of salt are brought from Wenchow, the grey (evidently unrefined Fukienese) at 11 cash, and the white at 16 cash.\n\nIn this country the singular custom exists of building the pigsty on the street at the front of the house, just like a dog kennel. I saw none of the Zikas \u8d64\u5bb6, who I had heard are very numerous in this district, but the present mention of them reminds me of an interesting discovery I made with reference to the Hakkas of Canton. The wei-yuan, who came from Fuchou \u6c5f\u5dde in Kiangsi, used some expressions which were purely Hakka. On examining him as to the dialects of Kiangsi, I found that the peculiar aspirates and pronunciation were almost exactly like those of the Hakka, and he quite understood me when I spoke to him in the Hakka dialect. As the only tradition I could find in Canton was that the Hakkas had fled from Kiangsi for some political reason several centuries ago, I think these two pieces of evidence may be taken to definitively explode the idea that there is anything \"non-Han\" in the Hakkas.\n\nAt the lower end of Lung-ch'\u00fcan, there is a magnificent roofed bridge at least a quarter of a mile long partly occupied by shops and hawkers' stalls, and forming a continuation of the high street. A fleet of 5,000 or 6,000 sampans, each carrying about a ton of salt (2,000 catties), is regularly employed in carrying Fukien (Hinghwa \u798f\u5316) salt from Ch'uchow and Wenchow. At the latter place, the salt costs 3 to 4 cash; at Ts'ing-tien it pays 1.3 likin; at Ch'uchow 1.9; and Lung-ch'\u00fcan 1.5 cash a catty; here it sells for 11 to 12 cash, so that a profit of 4 cash or so remains. Each boat worked by one man averages a round journey a month, so that 72,000 tons of salt give employment and $7 a month to 5,000 men. The boats are very much like a gig in shape, size, and framing, but the ends are pointed; each costs about $10 new; and each carries a tunnel-like matshed cover, which costs about $1. They move in fleets of 10 or 20, for mutual aid is required in getting over the shallows and rapids. The sail of T'aichow cloth ($1), mast, pike, stove (12 cents) and pan are all on exactly the same patterns, and they may be said to march, bivouac and manoeuvre like companies of soldiers. I came down in one of these boats all the 200 miles from Lung-ch'\u00fcan to\nWenchow. Rapids succeed each other every half mile or so for the first 50 miles, and small streams help to swell the river at intervals, but none of them are navigable even for rafts; these salt boats bring down cargoes of paper, bamboo-ware, dried edible bamboo-shoots, &c.\n\nThe Y\u00fcn-ho \u96f2\u548c boundary is entered at Wei-ning-k'ou \u5a01\u752f\u53e3 (60 li) on the right bank, and Mu-ch'i \u6728\u6eaa (90 li) on the left. This district is one of the few in Chekiang which produces iron, an article not mined anywhere in Fukien. Y\u00fcn-ho city is on the right bank, and not on the left as marked in the map published in the Customs Reports; it is 15 li from the river, and is reached thence by raft only. The port of Y\u00fcn-ho, very beautifully situated, is called Ch\u00fco-ts'un \u8173\u6751, 135 li from Lung-ch'\u00fcan, and 150 li from Ch'uchow by land. The boundary between Y\u00fcn-ho and Li-shui (Ch'uchow Fu) districts is at Ch'ih-tsi-t'ing \u8d64\u6fdf\u4ead, 35 li below Ch\u00fco-ts'un. Ten li further down is the embouchure of the Sung-yang \u6851\u967d river, the only tributary above Ch'uchow, navigable by even one-ton boats; thence it is 60 li to Ch'uchow, and 70 li to Sung-yang city. Sung-yang and Sui-ch'ang \u90b5\u660c cities are both 180 li overland from Lung-ch'\u00fcan. The mountains become bare, and the country opens out for a while after the Y\u00fcn-ho district is quitted. The river, which was as clear as crystal down to Ch\u00fco-ts'un, is muddied for a certain distance by the Y\u00fcn-ho creek. I only saw one single specimen of the Zika women walking along the bank,\u2014which was very disappointing, as my chief object in coming to Lung-ch'\u00fcan was to find out more about them.\n\nTen li above Ch'uchow a river, navigable for rafts, and even for boats at the freshet period, joins the main river from S\u00fcan-p'ing \u5b9c\u5e73 district city.\nARTICLE V.\n\nA BUDDHIST SHEET-TRACT,\n\nContaining an Apologue of Human Life.*\n\nTranslated, with Notes, by Bishop Moule of Hangchow.\n\nTHIS tract, one of very many circulated as an act of meritorious devotion, is printed in clear woodcut on a sheet of thin white paper about twenty-five inches by eleven.\n\nThe upper half presents a symbolical picture in outline, the blank spaces filled with inscriptions in metre.\n\nIn the upper corner to the right is Buddha, a nimbus round the head, and throned on clouds.\n\nImmediately below is a group consisting of Buddha, 'The Venerable One,' conversing with king Ud\u0101yana who is followed by an attendant. They are observing an elephant standing near a well, its head raised with threatening tusks towards a man, who clings to a wild-vine, pendulous in mid-air. From the well emerge three dragons. Around it are four serpents. They all threaten the man who hangs above them.\n\nThe man regards them not, intent on watching birds that flit around him. On the branch from which his vine depends, are a black and a white rat gnawing so as gradually to sever the branch. But the man takes no notice of the rats either.\n\nInscription below the enthroned Buddha (pentasyllabic).\n\nKind parents and kinsfolk\nAre short lived as a puppet-show:\nWhen King Yen (1) has once called thee,\nNone of them whatever can be thy substitute.\n\n* Read before the Society 22nd January, 1884.

Eitel) put a question to the Venerable One, Pinteulu (*), saying: In the law of Buddha what is the principle of religious (ascetic) observance?\n\nThe Venerable One answered and said:\u2014Figure to yourself a man journeying in a wilderness, surrounded by a conflagration, and pursued by a mad elephant.\n\nHe sees a well, beside which stands a tree. On the tree grows a wild vine drooping over the well. The man to escape the elephant seizes the vine, and climbs up above the well. In the well are three venomous dragons, and without it, four venomous serpents, together watching (for prey). In the tree are a black and a white rat gnawing at the wild vine in order to sever it. There are venomous bees, too, which sting the man. But the bees from time to time distil a tiny drop of honey into the man's mouth.\n\nThe man in his craving for the honey straightway forgets his peril!\n\nIs the man wretched, say you, or happy?\n\n(*) I have no (Buddhist) data by which to fix the meaning of these metaphysical lines. I suspect that \"will\" would fit them better than \"mind\" as the equivalent of \u610f, but am not sure.\n\n(*) (?) Negative and positive alike are gone.\n\n(*) Pinteulu does not occur in Eitel as a name of Buddha, so far as I can find.\nThe King made answer: This man's condition is wretched wholly, what happiness hath he?\n\nThe Venerable One proceeded; All knowledge (? or all the wise) needs parable to unfold it.\n\nThereupon he spake a sacred rhythm (g\u0101tha. See Eitel) as follows: The attack of the two rats on the vine is, verily, the hundred miseries. The four serpents around the well are, too, the thousand cares. When on a sudden the vine-root is gnawed asunder, down plunging, when can he raise his head again?\n\nThe wilderness is the (10) three worlds. The tree is the human body. Man, in the midst of all miseries, sins nevertheless beyond possibility of computation. The vine is the root of destiny (or life). The Elephant is the man-slaying demon, Wu-ch'ang (11). The two rats are the two discs (? or orbits) of the sun and moon, which in their revolution urge on the man. The well is the path of the (12) yellow pool. The three venomous dragons are Concupiscence, Wrath, and Insane Desire; whose threefold poison results in the three evil ways (or conditions) of Tartarus, the Starving Ghosts, and Brute Beasts. The four serpents are Earth, Water, Fire, Air, those four great (elements); or Wine, Beauty, Wealth, Envy, those four mischiefs; or Birth, Age, Disease, Death, those four gates (of life).\n\nThe hand that clings to the vine is the covetous hankering of the foolish and insane mind after the world's entanglements. The bees' honey is the dear love of husband and wife, the infection of the heart by the lewd lust and sensual love of animate beings. The heart is a fire; the body a tenement. The man in his burning house perceives not that it is being day and night consumed by the crowd of miseries combined. He covets but that dear love (till) one morning the stem of destiny cut through; down for evermore he falls into perdition, and his human form once lost, he shall hardly recover it in a myriad of Kalpas.\n\nI exhort all men (therefore), whilst still this body of\n\n(10) The three worlds (Tra\u00efloka) of desire, of form, and of formless ness (See Eitel).\n(11) Wu-ch'ang\u2014\"Transitory,\"\u2014the messenger of Hades.\n(12) The Grave.\u2014Mencius (iii, 2, x) speaks of the worm that \"feels on the dry dust and drinks of the yellow pool.\"\nform is hale and strong, in the midst of business to snatch some leisure, and daily at dawn and dusk recite, with single heart, NAMA AMIDA BUDDHA! (13) This done a thousand or a myriad times in the present world will add to your happiness and diminish calamity. And when you reach the end of life, you will assuredly migrate by (14) a birth to the most blissful world of the Western clime. (15)\n\nThere is a Hymn (16) that says:\n\nThe wild-vine (as it severs) hurries us down into the pit. Elephant, rats, serpents assail us; the hand must needs hold fast!\n\nOur self-nature Mita waits (longing) that we may awake betimes, (17)\n\nAnd not be suffered to incur (18) the three paths of misery.\n\nThe rich sweetness of wine and flesh are honey in arsenic.

He quotes it from Deslong-\n\"champ's Fables Indiennes, but I do not think it has ever\n\"yet been found in any Sanscrit original, though we\n\"doubt not it will be found in some yet unpublished Pali\n\"or Northern Text. I found it in the early medi\u00e6val\n\"romance of Josaphat and Barlaam which Max M\u00fcller\n\"has shewn to be only a Christian adaptation of the\n\"Buddha legend, and I have also read it in the great\n\"Persian mystical poem of the 18th century, the Masnav\u00e9.\n\"But I think you will be most interested to hear that\n\"Julien gives it in his 'Avad\u0101nas ou Contes et Apologues\n\"Indiens,' translated from the Chinese. He gives two\n\"versions of it\u2014Nos. xxxii and liii. The former he says\n\"is an extract from 'l'ouvrage intitul\u00e9 Fo-pi-yu-king, ou\n\"Livre des Comparaisons, expos\u00e9 par le Bouddha.

'Behold in the water, etc.,'\n\"though I am not sure that I understand it aright.\"\n\nThe Professor (who has been for some years a student\nof Buddhism in the Thibetan Mss. preserved in the University\nLibrary) proceeds to give his view of the meaning in a\nsentence or two which I have quoted above, p. 2, notes.\n\nIn a subsequent letter he has sent me an extract in\nGreek from the Legend of Barlaam and Josaphat curiously\nlike our tract, which I subjoin.\n\nAn interesting account of the Legend will be found in\nCol.

audience.\n\n\"I consider those who allow their souls to be wasted with hunger and distressed with a myriad evils to resemble a man flying before a raging unicorn (rhinoceros), who, not enduring the sound of his roaring and his frightful bellowing, but running off with might and main to avoid becoming a meal for him, in his swift course has fallen into a vast pit. But as he falls, extending his hands and grasping a shrub he clings to it with all his strength, and steadying his feet on some support fancies himself, for the rest, in peace and safety. He looks and sees two mice, the one white the other black, ceaselessly eating through the root of the shrub to which he has attached himself, and going on so as only not yet quite to sever it. Then he considers the bottom of the pit and perceives a dragon terrible to see, breathing fire and grimly awe-inspiring, gaping fearfully too and eager to swallow him up. Once more fixing his gaze on that support on which he has his feet planted, he sees four serpents' heads projecting out of the wall on which he has got his support. But casting his eyes upwards he sees from among the branches of the shrub a little honey distilling. Giving up at once the consideration of the calamities that surround him,\u2014how that from without the unicorn awfully raving seeks to devour him, and from beneath there is the savage dragon yawning to swallow him up, and the shrub he has grasped is going, only not yet, to be severed, and that he has planted his feet on a slippery and unsafe support,\u2014most unreasonably, I say, forgetting all these great sights of terror, with his whole mind he becomes enchained by the sweetness of that mere drop of honey.\"\n\nThe Professor gave me the following explanatory note. \"In the explanations the unicorn is said to represent Death, the pit is the world, the plant is our life consumed by day and night, the four serpents are the four elements which compose the body, the dragon below is Hades, and the honey is the sweetness of the pleasures of the world, by which it deceives its friends, and will not let them take thought for their own salvation.\"\nARTICLE VI.\n\nTRADE ROUTES TO WESTERN CHINA.*\n\nBY\n\nALEX. HOSIE, Esq.,\n\nOf H.B.M.'s Consular Service.\n\nBARON F. VON RICHTHOFEN in his valuable letter addressed to the Committee of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in 1872 devotes an occasional page to the subject of Trade Routes in Western China, more especially in the province of Y\u00fcnnan; but, as that distinguished traveller was, owing to an unfortunate accident, compelled to abandon his projected journey from Ss\u016b-ch'uan into Y\u00fcnnan, and his descriptions of the trade roads in the latter province were therefore derived from hearsay, it may not be out of place for one who has recently performed the journey which he abandoned, and who has traversed four trade roads to Y\u00fcnnan, to endeavour to supplement his remarks.\n\nI shall not, however, confine my attention to the province of Y\u00fcnnan; but I shall endeavour briefly to point out the existing trade routes to Western China, and to examine their relative advantages.\n\nBy Western China I mean the provinces of Ss\u016b-ch'uan, Kueichou, and Y\u00fcnnan.\n\nI.\u2014SS\u016a-CH'UAN.\n\nThe great trade highway into Ss\u016b-ch'uan is the River Yangtsze and its numerous tributaries.\n\nBy the Agreement of Chefoo facilities were granted for the navigation of the Upper Yangtsze by the opening of the port of Ichang and the permission to ascend by steamer as far west as Ch'ungk'ing, the great commercial centre of the province of Ss\u016b-ch'uan.\n\nAdvantage has been taken of these facilities to navigate as far as Ichang; and, except during the winter months when shallows interfere with vessels drawing more than six\n\nRead before the Society on the 25th March, 1884.\nfeet, a steamer runs regularly between Hankow and Ichang; and I understand that a Company has recently been formed whose object it is to run a couple of steamers between these two places at all seasons.\n\nNo attempt has yet been made, however, to steam as far west as Ch'ungk'ing; and one would naturally assume that obstacles bar the way. All the year round native boats navigate the waters between Ichang and Ch'ungk'ing, and we hesitate to be driven to the conclusion that obstacles surmountable by native craft are insurmountable by steam.\n\nThe obstacles to native craft are the rapids and the strong current, the former when the river is low, that is, during winter and spring, and the latter during the rest of the year when the river is flooded. Many of the larger boats have a draught of more than five feet, and insufficient depth of water has never been adduced as an obstacle to steam. In ascending from Ichang these boats, except in the gorges where the current is sluggish, are tracked by the river's bank; and when the river is low, they are dragged over the rapids by sheer human strength. I say, when the river is low, for during summer and autumn the rapids disappear under the great rise of water, and then there exists no obstacle to prevent a steamer of sufficient power from ascending as far as Ch'ungk'ing and even as far as Hs\u00fc-chou Fu, better known as Sui Fu, which for all practical purposes is the highest navigable point on the River Yangtsze.\n\nWe have said that the Yangtsze is the great trade highway into Ss\u016d-ch'uan, and from and to it goods are carried by land and water, principally the latter.\n\nThe Kia-ling, which enters the Yangtsze at Ch'ungk'ing, supplies the north and partly the east; the T'o, which enters the Yangtsze at Luchou, supplies the centre; and the Min, which joins the Yangtsze at Sui Fu, supplies the capital and the west of the province. These streams also bring down to the Great River, as the Yangtsze is called between Ichang and Sui Fu, the products of the districts which they drain.\n\nIn addition to these three streams which enter the Yangtsze from the north, are several others which join it from the south; but they are more concerned with supplying goods to and bringing produce from Kueichou and Y\u00fcnnan.\nthan the south of Ss\u016d-ch'uan, and will be noticed when we come to deal with these provinces.\n\nThe time and labour required to carry the goods by native craft from Ichang to Ch'ungk'ing and to distribute them throughout the province, seriously raise the value of the goods and necessarily limit their consumption; and there cannot be the least doubt that, were the facilities granted by the Agreement of Chefoo taken advantage of, goods could be laid down economically and without risk in Ch'ungk'ing, and a great development of the trade in substantial foreign manufactures would be the result.\n\nThe province of Ss\u016d-ch'uan contains a population some five or six times greater than either Kueichou or Y\u00fcnnan, and a population wealthy as compared with the populations of these smaller provinces; and the energy of the foreign merchant instead of being wholly diverted to supplying the requirements of Y\u00fcnnan\u2014requirements insignificant when those of Ss\u016d-ch'uan are considered\u2014should be devoted to availing himself of the advantages conceded by the Agreement of Chefoo, and thereby open up to foreign trade the largest province in the Empire with its population of about thirty millions.\n\nBut let not the foreign manufacturer and merchant think, as some recent writers would have then believe\u2014that these millions of Western China are waiting to array themselves in foreign piece goods. No such thing. For the ordinary working classes, such as agriculturists, carriers and coolies, which form a large proportion of the population, these goods are altogether unsuited; and to supply their wants Ss\u016d-ch'uan annually imports from the Hukuang provinces raw cotton and manufactured goods, the value of which cannot be placed at less than two millions sterling. These cottons are warm and substantial; and when the wear and tear of years have reduced them to rags, they are converted to numerous other uses.\n\nThe foreign manufacturer and merchant may well be content if they can supply that percentage of the population, such as shopkeepers and the wealthier classes, which has not to earn its livelihood by hard manual labour.\n\nIn a word, the trade highway into Ss\u016d-ch'uan is the Upper Yangtsze. For conducting and developing this trade, facilities have been granted by the Agreement of Chefoo;\nbut hitherto they have not been taken advantage of, owing to certain obstacles which sooner or later will be found to be more imaginary than real.\n\nIs the trade of Ch'ungk'ing, which now falls little short of forty million taels a year, to be left undeveloped? I leave the answer to the foreign merchant. That no other trade route can possibly compete with the Yangtsze route I shall endeavour to show anon.\n\nWhen the Yangtsze is flooded the greater part of the junks are laid up, the owners preferring to relinquish freight rather than expose their property to the numerous risks which threaten unwieldy craft during summer and autumn; and since at these seasons no obstacles exist to the navigation of the Upper Yangtsze, almost the entire carrying trade would fall to a steamer.\n\nThere is a trade route from Canton to Ss\u016d-ch'uan\u2014before the opening of the Yangtsze a most important route\u2014a great part of which can be accomplished on the inland waters of the provinces of Kuangtung, Hunan, and Ss\u016d-ch'uan. The trade along this route is now insignificant, consisting for the most part of peddlery, and is of no interest to foreign commerce with which in these pages we are more immediately concerned. For the same reason I pass over without remark the great northern trade road to Ch'eng-tu, the provincial capital of Ss\u016d-ch'uan, and the road from the latter city to Thibet by way of Lithang and Bathang.\n\nII.\u2014KUEICHOU.\n\nThe River Yangtsze is also the basis of trade routes to the province of Kueichou. These we shall discuss in order, beginning from the east.\n\n(1). One of the most important trade routes to Kueichou begins at Hankow, crosses the Tung-t'ing Lake, and ascends the Yian River as far as the city of Ch\u00eany\u00fcan Fu, the highest navigable point in Kueichou, and distant seven days' journey from Kueiyang Fu, the capital of the province. This is well known as the route followed by the late Mr. Margary on his way to Y\u00fcnnan.\n\nGoods intended for the east of Kueichou are mostly carried by this route, which, although occupying more time\u2014at least two months\u2014than the Great River route to Ch'ung-\nking and thence overland to Kueichou, is preferred to the latter for various and some of them obvious reasons. The whole journey into eastern Kueichou can be performed by water without a single transhipment; the imposts leviable in Ss\u016d-ch'uan on goods passing through the province are avoided; and, although there are numerous rapids which seriously interfere with the navigation of the Y\u00fcan River, they are not so dangerous or formidable for native craft as the rapids on the Great River.\n\nFor northern and western Kueichou other routes are followed; and, with one exception, they all lie to the west of Ch'ungking. This exception is the\n\n(2). Kung-t'an River or Wu River route.\n\nThe Kung-t'an River, which enters the Yangtsze at Fuchou, seventy-two geographical miles to the east of Ch'ungking, derives its name from a place called Kung-t'an near the Ss\u016d-ch'uan-Kueichou border, and distant four hundred and fifty li from its mouth. This river, which rises in the west of Kueichou and crosses the province, is known as the Wu River until it reaches the frontier. It is also called the Fuchou River from the city at its mouth.\n\nIt is not navigable the whole distance from Fuchou to Kung-t'an, for goods have to be transshipped at a place called Yang-ko-ch'i, 120 li from Fuchou, and carried overland a distance of about a mile. The chief places on its banks are Yang-ko-ch'i, Chiang-k'ou, P\u00eang-shui Hsien, and Kung-t'an, distant respectively 120, 210, 330, and 450 li from Fuchou.\n\nThe up trade is insignificant; but the down trade is important, consisting principally of wood-oil, bean-cake, opium, hemp, indigo, charcoal, firewood, Indian corn, potatoes, cereals, and drugs.\n\nThe river is shallow, and only boats of light draught attempt the up-journey, which occupies some five days.\n\n(3). The Ch'ungking overland and\n\n(4). Chi-chiang River routes.\n\nThese are virtually one route, as the Ch'ungking overland route passes Chi-chiang Hsien from which the river derives its name. The overland journey from\nCh'ungk'ing to Ch'i-chiang Hsien occupies three days, while four days are required to accomplish the journey by boat from the mouth of the river to the district city. Above Ch'i-chiang Hsien the river is very shallow and is navigable only by the smallest craft as far as Hsin-chan in Kueichou, another two days' journey. From Ch'i-chiang Hsien goods can be carried to Kueiyang Fu, the capital of Kueichou in twelve days or even less.\n\nThis is an important trade route, and by it northeastern Kueichou is supplied with salt from Ss\u016d-ch'uan.\n\nCh'i-chiang Hsien is distant 360 li from the river's mouth; and the chief places on its banks are Pei-tu, Kuang hsing-ch'ang, Wu-ch'a-'ho, Chia-hsi-ch'iao, Ch\u00ean-wu-ch'ang, J\u00ean-shih-'to, and Chiang-k'ou at its junction with the Great River.\n\n(4). The J\u00ean-'huai River or Chih-shui River route.\n\nThis river which in its upper waters is known as the Chih-shui, flows past J\u00ean-'huai T'ing in northern Kueichou and enters the Great River at Ho-chiang Hsien, 95 geographical miles west of Ch'ungk'ing, and a three days' journey by river.\n\nA glance at a map of China will show that at this point the Great River is no great distance from the Kueichou frontier; and the up-river journey from Ho-chiang Hsien to J\u00ean-'huai T'ing occupies only a couple of days. Between these two cities there are only two places of any importance, namely, Li-ch'i-tz\u016d and Ch'uan-shih. The up trade consists almost entirely of Ss\u016d-ch'uan salt; the down trade in pine trees and in pine boards, bamboos, wood-oil, rape-seed oil, indigo, charcoal, firewood, lump coal, paper, cereals, and soot for the manufacture of ink.\n\n(5). The Luchou and Yung-ning River Route.\n\nWith the exception of the Tung-t'ing Lake and Y\u00fcan River route, this is the most important trade road to Kueichou; and, in my opinion, it is the best line of communication with Y\u00fcnnan, from the Yangtsze.\n\nLuchou is a city of great commercial importance on the north bank of the Great River at its junction with the T'o River, 129 geographical miles west of Ch'ungk'ing. It is the great salt depot of Ss\u016d-ch'uan. Thirteen miles west\nof Luchou and on the opposite bank of the river is the district city of Na-chi, a place of no importance in itself; but it lies on the right bank and at the mouth of the Yung-ning River, a waterway of the highest commercial value, for by this route the total salt supply of western Kueichou finds its way from Luchou. It is navigable as far as the district city of Yung-ning,\u2014from which it derives its name,\u2014and which is distant a three days' journey from the Kueichou frontier. From the frontier another three days are required to reach the flourishing district city of Pi-chieh, which, although one of the most important commercial cities in Kueichou, is not to be found on the ordinary foreign maps of China. This city is distant seven days' journey from Kueiyang Fu and fifteen days from Y\u00fcnnan Fu.\n\nThe whole journey from Y\u00fcnnan Fu to Luchou can thus be performed in twenty-two days, for the Yung-ning River can be descended in a single day, although during last year I was, owing to certain mishaps, detained a couple of days on it. On the up journey from Luchou to Yung-ning Hsien, boats have to be tracked the whole way, and a week or more is required to accomplish it according to the state of the river. The overland journey between these two places occupies four days. In many places the river is very narrow, and it has a fair number of rapids.\n\nThe road from Yung-ning Hsien to Y\u00fcnnan Fu is one of the best I have seen in China. It is paved and in good repair throughout its whole length. Before the rebellion it was the chief outlet for the copper from the numerous mines in the west of Kueichou; and an attempt is now being made by the provincial authorities concerned to induce trade to revert to this channel. Unfortunately, however, there are three great obstacles to a swifter means of communication between the Yangtsze and Y\u00fcnnan Fu. They are the valleys of the K'o-tu, Chi-i-hsing, and Chih-shui Rivers respectively. Were these three deep and broad chasms bridged, as doubtless they could be, but at an enormous expense, we should not despair of seeing Y\u00fcnnan Fu connected with Shanghai by steam.\n\nAs I have said above, the salt supply of western Kueichou follows this route, which is also followed by piece goods manufactured in Ss\u016d-ch'uan from Hukuang\ncotton. I was surprised that the trade with Y\u00fcnnan by this route was not more extensive; but the reason is not far to seek. Goods intended for Y\u00fcnnan by this route have to pass through the province of Kueichou and thus incur additional taxation. It is only natural, therefore, that merchants should prefer to carry their goods into Y\u00fcnnan by the Sui Fu route, of which I shall speak anon.\n\nIII.\u2014Y\u00dcNNAN.\n\nI pass now to the province of Y\u00fcnnan which has occupied so much of the attention of recent writers.\n\nThe trade routes to this province are\n\n(1). The Nan-kuang River route;\n\n(2). The Ta-kuan River route.\n\nThese two rivers enter the Yangtsze the one below and the other above Sui Fu; and they constitute what may be called the Sui Fu route to Y\u00fcnnan. These two roads converge and meet at the town of Lao-ya-t'an\u2014usually known as Lao-wa-t'an\u2014which lies on the left bank of the Ta-kuan River within the Y\u00fcnnan border in the prefecture of Chaot'ung. Lao-ya-t'an is distant from Chaot'ung Fu, Tungch'uan Fu, and Y\u00fcnnan Fu, six, eleven, and nineteen days' journey respectively. From Lao-ya-t'an to Sui Fu the Ta-kuan River route is preferred because boat can be taken at Lao-ya-t'an; whereas the Nan-kuang river is not navigable until the town of Huang-shui-k'ou, more than a three days' journey from Lao-ya-t'an and within the province of Ssuch'uan, is reached. Neither of the two rivers is navigable throughout; rocks bar the Nan-kuang River at its very mouth, while on the Ta-kuan River goods have to be transhipped and carried overland a distance of fifteen li near the Y\u00fcnnan-Ssuch'uan frontier. The road from Y\u00fcnnan Fu to Lao-ya-t'an is difficult beyond description; it is infinitely inferior to the Luchou route; and it may safely be predicted that it will always remain what it is\u2014a very bad horse road. By this route northern Y\u00fcnnan is supplied with foreign piece goods, salt, and Hukuang cottons, while lead, copper, sugar, and P'u-\u00earh tea are the principal exports.\n\n(3). The Chien-ch'ang valley route to Y\u00fcnnan.\n\n(4). The Chien-ch'ang valley route by way of\nNingyuan Fu, Yen-yuan Hsien, and Yung-pei Ting to western Yunnan.\n\nGoods are carried from Sui Fu up the Min River to Chiating Fu on its right bank and at its junction with the Ta-tu River. Here they are transhipped into smaller boats which carry them up the Ya-chou River, which enters the Ta-tu before its junction with the Min, to Yachou Fu, an important city four days south west of Ch'engtu. From Yachou Fu they are conveyed overland south through Ching-chi Hsien, Yueh-hsi Ting, Ningyuan Fu, and Hui-li Chou to Yunnan.\n\nIt is a fourteen days' journey from Yachou Fu to Ningyuan Fu, and from the latter city nine more days are required to reach the Yunnan frontier.\n\nThe hopes which the traveller in search of trade routes clings to with tenacity are rudely and summarily blasted by a glance at the mountainous country through which this road passes; nor is there any improvement when as a last chance he turns west from Ningyuan Fu in the desperate attempt to reach western Yunnan.\n\nThis latter route (No. 4) was described to Baron von Richthofen as the great trade highway from Tali Fu to Ch'engtu previous to the Mahomedan rebellion. I wish he had seen it! I was told the same story, and doubtless there is some truth in it; but the vestiges of this great highway are few indeed\u2014a yard or two of unburied pavement may be discovered occasionally on a mountain side\u2014but the greater part of it between Ningyuan Fu and Tali Fu is a mere bridle path winding up and down mountain sides. As evidence in support of the \"great highway\" theory I may state that I met a Thibetan caravan between these two places.\n\n(5). Instead, however, of striking west from Ningyuan Fu the traveller may proceed south to Huili Chou, and thence turn south west to Tali Fu. Of this route, which is described as difficult, I have no personal knowledge; but knowing the routes from Tali Fu to Yunnan Fu, and Tali Fu to Ningyuan, Fu I can easily imagine what the intermediate route is like. The journey by it occupies twenty-three days, as against twenty-one days by route (4).\n\nBefore entering Shang-kuan (\"Upper Pass\"), which guards the northern approach to Tali Fu, the Thibetan\nroad, which joins the Ch'\u00eangtu road to Thibet at Bathang, strikes the Tali Fu road. Of this road I know nothing, and will say nothing. It is the route followed by the Tibetans who flock to the fair which is held annually outside the west gate of Tali in the third Chinese moon.\n\n(6). The Bhamo route by way of T\u00eangy\u00fceh Chow and Yungch'ung Fu to Tali Fu.\n\nThis journey has been so frequently described that it is probably the best known route to Y\u00fcnnan. The difficulties of the road have been carefully pointed out; and those travellers who have performed the whole journey are agreed that these difficulties are a barrier to a swifter means of communication.\n\nAt present the journey between Tali Fu and Bhamo can be performed in some four-and-twenty days; and, as the result of inquiry at the former place and at Hsia-kuan, the great trade depot of western Y\u00fcnnan through which the highway passes a few miles to the south of Tali, I believe I am near the mark when I say that the total annual value of the trade between Bhamo and Tali amounts to about half a million sterling.\n\n(7). The Songkoi or Red River route to Southern Y\u00fcnnan.\n\nAnyone wishing to obtain information regarding this important trade route to Southern Y\u00fcnnan would do well to turn to the \"China Review\" for May and June, 1881, where he will find an interesting article, entitled \"The Province of Y\u00fcnnan,\" which contains a translation of the Trade Report for 1879 of Comte de Kergaradec, then Consul for France at Hanoi. In addition to careful statistics of the trade between Y\u00fcnnan and Tonquin he will find desirable information regarding the navigation of the Songkoi. Here we are told that the total value of the trade between Y\u00fcnnan and Hanoi during 1879 amounted to 3,225,000 francs, or \u00a3169,000; and that \"in ordinary times thirty to forty days are occupied in the voyage from Hanoi to Lao-kai, and ten or twelve from Lao-kai to Man-hao.\"\n\nIf this river, as some French writers have asserted, is capable of steam navigation in its upper waters, it is\nwithout doubt a very valuable trade route to Southern and South-eastern Y\u00fcnnan. But these writers disagree as to how far it is navigable; and M. Rocher, in his work \"La Province Chinoise du Y\u00fcnnan,\" says \"There is every reason to believe that Lao-kai, considering the propinquity of Y\u00fcnnan and Tonquin, will become the extreme point of steam navigation, and the entrep\u00f4t of Y\u00fcnnan.\" If M. Rocher had said \"the entrep\u00f4t of South-eastern Y\u00fcnnan,\" we should have been disposed to agree with him; but we cannot for a moment accept the conclusion that the trade of Western and Northern Y\u00fcnnan would be affected by the opening of the Songkoi to steam navigation. Le Comte de Kergaradec sums up his Report in the following words: \"In conclusion we are compelled to admit that under the most favourable circumstances, under conditions very different from those of to-day, the trade by the Red River could hardly attain a total of twenty million francs,\" say \u00a3800,000; but the writer of the article thinks that \"if free access were obtainable via the Red River, the neighbouring provinces would also benefit, and take advantage of this outlet.\" I fear that those acquainted with the physical characteristics of Western China will think otherwise. But there is one point on which I wish to put this writer straight. He says in his next sentence, \"Passengers from Y\u00fcnnan might then reach the capital, Peking, in 30 days instead of 100 days, the time it now occupies via the Hankow route.\" By Y\u00fcnnan I presume the provincial capital is meant, and by the \"Hankow route\" \"the Tung-t'ing lake and Y\u00fcan River route.\" Whether by this route, or by the Sui Fu or Luchou routes, passengers can in point of fact reach Peking from Y\u00fcnnan Fu in less than half a hundred days.\n\n(8). The Canton and West River route to Y\u00fcnnan.\n\nThe West River is navigable by native craft from Canton to P\u00e8se, a prefectural city in the west of the province of Kwangsi, whence goods are carried overland to Y\u00fcnnan Fu. The journey by this route is long and tedious; but it has one advantage over the Yangtsze routes to Y\u00fcnnan Fu, namely, that the overland journey from P\u00e8se can be performed in several days less than by the Sui Fu or Luchou routes. But so far as foreign manufac-\ntures are concerned, the Yangtsze routes at present do not compete with the Canton route to Y\u00fcnnan Fu; they are more concerned with the supply of northern Y\u00fcnnan. When steamers run to Lao-kai or Man-hao on the Songkoi, and to Ch'ungk'ing, Luclhou and Sui Fu on the Upper Yangtsze, this trade route must inevitably suffer the fate of the once important trade route from Canton through Hunan to Ss\u016d-ch'uan, which has, as I have already stated, become insignificant since the opening of the Lower Yangtsze to steam navigation.\n\n(9). The route to Y\u00fcnnan by way of Kueiyang Fu.\n\nThis route is too far from water communication to be of any importance. Y\u00fcnnan Fu is distant twenty-one days' journey from Kueiyang Fu, whence another seven days are required to reach Ch\u00e9nyuan Fu, which is, as I have already mentioned, the highest navigable point on the Yuan River. Kueiyang is also distant thirteen days from Yung-ning Hsien on the Yung-ning River, twelve days from the Chi-chiang River, and fifteen days from Ch'ungk'ing. The road from Kueiyang to Y\u00fcnnan Fu, with the exception of the last five stages, is exceedingly mountainous and difficult, and the little trade there is consists principally of opium from Y\u00fcnnan.\n\nI have thus endeavoured briefly to point out the existing trade routes to Western China. I have not in a paper like the present entered into the details of trade, for they would fill a volume. Nor have I spoken of the attempts that have recently been made to find a trade route to South-western Y\u00fcnnan. But the foreign merchant in China may rest assured that were a dozen trade routes to Western Y\u00fcnnan found to-morrow they will not affect the Yangtsze routes which supply Ss\u016d-ch'uan, Kueichou, and Northern Y\u00fcnnan. On the other hand, he may be assured that the present trade, great as it is, is capable of enormous expansion, and that the first step to ensure such expansion is to open the Upper Yangtsze to steam navigation. Let not the words 'rapids' and 'gorges' dissuade him from the attempt.\nERRATA.\n\nPage 28, line 6 from bottom, for \"75 miles\" read \"75 li.\"\n\" 39, \" 2 \" top, \" \u514b \" \u5151\n\" 48, \" 9 \" \" \"ragarding\" \" regarding.\"\n\" 51, Paragraph 3, for \"it is 30 li\" read \"it is 60 li, and thence 30 li.\"\n\" 61, bottom line, for \"law lin-\" \" in wall-.\"\n\" 84, line 14, for \"follows\" read \"follow.\"\nCONTENTS.\n\nPage.\n\nArticle I.\u2014Un Po\u00e8te Chinois du XVIIIe Si\u00e8cle, Y\u00fcan Tseu-ts\u2019ai, sa Vie et ses \u0152uvres.

Peu de sinologues se sont occup\u00e9s de cette partie difficile de la litt\u00e9rature chinoise, et ceux qui l\u2019ont fait ont surtout pris pour sujet d\u2019\u00e9tude ce que j\u2019appellerais la po\u00e9sie classique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le Che-king ou Livre des Odes, le po\u00e8me Li-sao et les po\u00e9sies de l\u2019\u00e9poque des T\u2019ang. D\u2019aucuns ont bien donn\u00e9, par aventure, des traductions de chansons, romances ou morceaux populaires, mais ces fragments et lambeaux, \u00e9pars ici et l\u00e0, ne peuvent permettre d\u2019avoir une id\u00e9e juste de la muse chinoise de nos jours. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cette heure, les savants semblent avoir regard\u00e9 avec le m\u00e9pris le plus profond la v\u00e9ritable po\u00e9sie moderne.\n\nQuiconque conna\u00eet tant soit peu l\u2019histoire litt\u00e9raire de la Chine s\u2019explique facilement ce d\u00e9dain. Du petit au grand, tout dans ce pays n\u2019est qu\u2019un pastiche de l\u2019antiquit\u00e9; les temps anciens constituent son \u00e2ge d\u2019or : ce qui s\u2019est fait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de Yu le Grand, de Ya\u00f4, de Chou, de Confucius, doit se faire\nencore aujourd'hui*. Ainsi raisonne et parle tout bon et patriote Chinois ; en industrie, en m\u00e9canique, en art militaire, en diplomatie, aussi bien qu'en litt\u00e9rature, il faut s'appliquer \u00e0 imiter scrupuleusement les anciens. \u00c0 ce prix seul on peut r\u00e9ussir. On n'\u00e9crit bien en chinois, ai-je dit ailleurs\u2020, que si l'on se rapproche le plus possible du style antique, et celui qui, d'expressions et d'allusions cucill\u00e9es \u00e0 droite et \u00e0 gauche dans les Canoniques, les Classiques et les meilleurs ouvrages post\u00e9rieurs, arrive \u00e0 faire une sorte de mosa\u00efque dont les raccords ne sont pas perceptibles \u00e0 l'\u0153il, celui-l\u00e0 fait preuve d'une vaste \u00e9rudition et est r\u00e9put\u00e9 un ma\u00eetre dans l'art d'\u00e9crire. De m\u00eame que les prosateurs se sont toujours plu et se plaisent encore \u00e0 modeler leurs productions sur les immortels \u00e9crits de Confucius et de ses disciples, de m\u00eame les po\u00e8tes ont fait et font aujourd'hui encore tous leurs efforts pour imiter les vers du Che-king et de l'\u00e9poque de T'ang.\n\nDans le Livre des Odes, la po\u00e9sie chinoise est en quelque sorte \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat d'embryon : la Muse y est comme \u00e9touff\u00e9e. On en suit le d\u00e9veloppement progressif, encore lent, \u00e9peur\u00e9, mesur\u00e9, dans les po\u00e8tes plus modernes, mais c'est sous la dynastie des T'ang qu'on la voit prendre tout-\u00e0-coup son essor et s'\u00e9lever \u00e0 une hauteur depuis inaccessible. Sans s'astreindre, en effet, \u00e0 suivre pas \u00e0 pas leurs devanciers, les chefs de l'\u00e9cole po\u00e9tique des T'ang entr\u00e8rent plus d'une fois dans la voie de l'innovation et surent principalement donner \u00e0 leurs pens\u00e9es un vivant d'expression et une teinte de coloris qu'on chercherait en vain ailleurs. Ils eurent le m\u00e9rite et l'honneur de fixer la po\u00e9sie d'une fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive et d'en \u00e9tablir \u00e0 jamais les r\u00e8gles.

L'estime que la gent lettr\u00e9e professe pour ces po\u00e8tes a \u00e9t\u00e9 traduite dans le dictum suivant :\n\nLisez les trois cents stances des Tang :\nAlors seulement vous pourrez faire des vers.\n\nSans aller jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre d'une mani\u00e8re absolue que la po\u00e9sie des Tang a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la moderne ce que la grecque fut, en Europe, \u00e0 la latine, on pourrait cependant, pour mieux faire sentir les attaches qui lient l'une \u00e0 l'autre, employer la spirituelle et pittoresque expression que Victor Hugo appliquait nagu\u00e8re \u00e0 Virgile par rapport \u00e0 Hom\u00e8re, et dire que la seconde est pour ainsi dire la lune de la premi\u00e8re. Imiter la po\u00e9sie du Che-king et des Tang a \u00e9t\u00e9 un devoir sacr\u00e9 pour tout po\u00e8te chinois : que dis-je ? c'est encore celui des litt\u00e9rateurs de nos jours. Mais l'imitation n'est pas une : elle a des degr\u00e9s ; si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 servile pour certains po\u00e8tes sans imagination, sans talent, destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre emport\u00e9s sans merci par la vague des ans, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 libre pour ceux qui ont m\u00e9rit\u00e9 de passer \u00e0 la post\u00e9rit\u00e9 : ces derniers ne se sont pas attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la lettre des mod\u00e8les et ont pris garde de produire un calque po\u00e9tique. Ils n'ont voulu mettre dans leurs vers qu'un p\u00e2le reflet des \u0153uvres de la grande \u00e9poque.\n\nOn comprend d\u00e8s lors comment les savants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fatalement attir\u00e9s vers ces po\u00e9sies c\u00e9l\u00e8bres, tant de fois vant\u00e9es, tant de fois cit\u00e9es, et pourquoi ils les ont traduites en premier lieu : il fallait appr\u00e9cier les mod\u00e8les avant que de songer \u00e0 aborder les imitateurs ; il \u00e9tait de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de traduire Hom\u00e8re avant que de feuilleter Virgile. Quiconque d\u00e9sire se livrer \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de la po\u00e9sie chinoise doit en effet commencer par la lecture du Che-king, de Li T'ai-p\u00f4 et de Tou Fon : autrement, on ne serait jamais s\u00fbr d'en comprendre les finesse et les allusions. La science sinologique peut donc avec raison remercier les savants d'avoir entrepris la t\u00e2che ardue de faire conna\u00eetre en Europe ces \u0153uvres po\u00e9tiques : mais elle ne saurait manquer de s'\u00e9tonner, \u00e0 bon droit, qu'ils se soient arr\u00eat\u00e9s brusquement dans le chemin o\u00f9 ils avaient fait leurs premiers pas, et qu'ils aient pu penser que les po\u00e8tes modernes ne m\u00e9ritaient pas d'\u00eatre connus.\n\nEn effet si, chez nous, on admire les ma\u00eetres de la po\u00e9sie latine du temps de C\u00e9sar et d'Auguste, on n'en go\u00fbte pas moins les auteurs de la d\u00e9cadence ; de m\u00eame en Chine, on v\u00e9n\u00e8re en classiques Tou Fon et Li T'ai-p\u00f4, ou les prend comme mod\u00e8les de\nstyle et d'\u00e9l\u00e9gance, mais on ne se lasse pas toutefois de lire et de relire les nombreuses pi\u00e8ces dues aux pinceaux brillants de \u8607\u8efe Sou Che ou \u8607\u6771\u5761 Sou Toung-p\u014d, de la dynastie des Sung (1036-1101), des empereurs K'ang-chi, Young-tcheng, Kien-loung, et de \u8881\u5b50\u624d Yuan Tseu-t'sai, l'un des plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres \u00e9crivains de la dynastie actuelle.\n\nFrapp\u00e9, il y a bient\u00f4t deux ans, du peu d'estime que les sinologues semblaient avoir \u00e0 l'endroit de la po\u00e9sie chinoise, j'entrepris d'\u00e9tudier la Chine po\u00e9tique dans les trois phases de son histoire, \u00e0 son \u00e9closion dans le Che-king, durant son \u00e9panouissement sous les T'ang et pendant son \u00e9tiollement successif sous les dynasties suivantes*. Apr\u00e8s avoir parcouru, la plume \u00e0 la main, les recueils classiques de Tou Fou et de Li Tai-p\u014d, les collections volumineuses de Sou Toung-p\u014d, de K'ang-chi, de Young-tcheng et de K'ien-loung, j'en vins \u00e0 attaquer les essais po\u00e9tiques de l'Acad\u00e9mie de \u96a8\u5712 Souei-yuan (jardin de Sonci) dont le chef ou le pr\u00e9sident fut ce Yuan Tseu-t'sai que je viens de citer. Ce livre, fort pris\u00e9 en Chine, o\u00f9 il a sa place sur les rayons d'une biblioth\u00e8que choisie, est, je crois, inconnu des sinologues : du moins je ne sache pas que l'on ait jamais extrait et traduit quoique ce soit des huit t'ao ou volumes dont il se compose. Le nom m\u00eame de celui qui y tient la place d'honneur passe peut-\u00eatre ici pour la premi\u00e8re fois sous les yeux du lecteur : Yuan Tseu-t'sai est bien cit\u00e9 dans le petit dictionnaire biographique de Mayers, mais ce savant et regrett\u00e9 sinologue ne lui consacr\u00e9 que deux lignes d'un laconisme d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rant. Les autres ouvrages sur la Chine que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame de consulter sont tous muets \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Le hasard a fait que nul n'a encore song\u00e9 \u00e0 sonder la mine litt\u00e9raire que Yuan et ses disciples nous ont laiss\u00e9e, et \u00e0 en exploiter les richesses au profit de la science.\n\nLa lecture rapide que je fis d'abord du \u96a8\u5712\u4e09\u5341\u7a2e Souei-yuan san-che-tchoung (tel est le titre de ce recueil), me parut attrayante, mais, l'ayant recommenc\u00e9e peu apr\u00e8s avec plus de soin,\n\n* \"A Chinese writer in his preface to a collection of poems, compares the progress of poetry in China, to the gradual growth of a tree.

Les Belles-lettres \u00e9taient sa vocation : il ne voulait point sortir de leur domaine, il s'y pr\u00e9lassait avec amour. Son objectif \u00e9tait la science, et non pas, comme la plupart des jeunes chinois, la r\u00e9ussite aux examens universitaires et l'obtention de dipl\u00f4mes qui ouvrent d'ordinaire la porte du fonctionarisme et de la fortune. C'est ainsi qu'il atteignit l'\u00e2ge de vingt-et-un ans sans s'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 encore, malgr\u00e9 ses talents r\u00e9els, aux concours pour le baccalaur\u00e9at.\n\nA cet \u00e2ge, une circonstance toute fortuite le mit en lumi\u00e8re et lui annon\u00e7a pour ainsi dire l'avenir qui lui \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9. Son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait alors secr\u00e9taire au pr\u00e9toire de Kin Koung, gouverneur de la province du Kouang-si. Yuan alla un jour lui rendre visite : le gouverneur, \u00e0 qui le jeune lettr\u00e9 fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme un \"savant en expectative,\" voulut mettre celui-ci \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve et lui demanda de composer quelques vers sur un tambour de bronze plac\u00e9 dans son yamen. Yuan saisit imm\u00e9diatement un pinceau et composa instantan\u00e9ment une pi\u00e8ce de vers sur ce sujet difficile et pr\u00eatant si peu \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie. Kin Koung fut \u00e9merveill\u00e9 autant de la promptitude avec laquelle le fils de son secr\u00e9taire avait improvis\u00e9 ces stances, que des pens\u00e9es graciennes qu'il avait su couler dans ces vers : il pensa qu'un talent si pr\u00e9coce devait conduire rapidement Yuan Ts'en-t'ui \u00e0 une c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame \u00e0 de hautes dignit\u00e9s, et il envoya un rapport sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 l'empereur pour lui recommander le jeune po\u00e8te et le prier de permettre \u00e0 celui-ci de se pr\u00e9senter, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de vieux lettr\u00e9s \"blanchis sous le harnois,\" au concours extraordinaire qui allait avoir lieu pour tous les savans de l'empire.\n\nL'empereur K'ien-loung, alors sur le tr\u00f4ne, venait en effet de d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter une session de l'examen sp\u00e9cial appel\u00e9 P\u00f4-chi\u00f4-\n'houng-ts'eu*', et faisait appel aux plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres litt\u00e9rateurs de ses vastes \u00c9tats (1736). Dans la lice, devaient se trouver en pr\u00e9sence et rivaliser d'\u00e9rudition et de talent, tous les lettr\u00e9s de l'empire renomm\u00e9s par leur ouvrages et leurs savoir et qui, soit qu'ils n'eussent pas r\u00e9ussi aux examens ordinaires (affaire de chance aussi bien en Chine qu'en Europe), soit qu'enz-m\u00eames n'eussent pas voulu les affronter, n'avaient pas encore obtenu de degr\u00e9s universitaires. Cette jo\u00fbte devait avoir lieu durant le neuvi\u00e8me mois (septembre) dans la salle du palais \u4fdd\u548c\u6bbf Pa\u00f4-h\u00f4-ti\u00ean, sous l'\u0153il auguste de l'empereur m\u00eame\u2020. Plus de deux cents lettr\u00e9s se pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent : mais, comme toujours en pareille occurrence, il y eut beaucoup d'appel\u00e9s et peu d'\u00e9lus, et Yuan Tseu-ts'ai, le plus jeune de tous les concurrents, dit son biographe, se trouva parmi ces derniers. La jalousie de quelque vieil examinateur, farieux de voir un si jeune candidat lutter avec les plus savants de l'empire, fut peut-\u00eatre la seule cause qui l'emp\u00eacha de r\u00e9ussir! Ce ne fut toujours point l'insuffisance de ses connaissances, car, deux ans apr\u00e8s, il \u00e9tait re\u00e7u Kiu-jen ou licenci\u00e9 \u00e0 l'examen de P\u00e9king (1738) et, l'ann\u00e9e suivante, il devenait tsin-che ou docteur (1739).\n\nEn conformit\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements si minutieux qui r\u00e9gissent les examens chinois, Yuan Tseu-ts'ai, class\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier concours parmi les premiers, re\u00e7ut le titre de Chou-ki-che, ou bachelier Han-lin\u2021. Ainsi lui furent ouvertes les portes du Han-lin-yuan ou Acad\u00e9mie de la For\u00eat de Pinceaux. Le jeune docteur dut alors suivre les cours du \u5eb6\u5e38\u9928 Ohou-tch'ang-kouan pour se perfectionner dans la litt\u00e9rature : mais il para\u00eet qu'il n'avait aucune aptitude pour l'\u00e9tude des langues ; il ne s'adonna pas en effet suffisamment \u00e0 celle du Mandchou, et le peu de progr\u00e8s qu'il avait fait de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9, le fit \u00e9chouer \u00e0 l'examen de sortie\u00a7. Ne pouvant d\u00e8s lors collaborer aux doctes travaux des Immortels chinois, il fut r\u00e9duit \u00e0 accepter une place dans les rangs des fonctionnaires provinciaux : il re\u00e7ut une charge de Tche-chien ou Magistrat de district dans la province du Kiang-nan.\n\n* Voir \u00e0 l'appendice une note sur cet examen.\n\u2020 Souei-yuan-che-'hou\u00e2, livre VI, et Biographies des Hommes C\u00e9l\u00e8bres.\n\u2021 Voir pour les d\u00e9tails Mayers, The Chinese Government, p. 25.\n\u00a7 Les Chou-ki-che qui r\u00e9ussissent \u00e0 l'examen de sortie passent \u6aa2\u8a66 Kien-t'ao, gradu\u00e9 du 3e. degr\u00e9, ou \u7de8\u4fee Pien-si\u00e9ou\u00e2, compilateur du Han-lin-yuan (Mayers, p. 25).\nII.\n\nLe district de \u6ea7\u6c34 Li-choue\u00ef, d\u00e9pendant de la pr\u00e9fecture de Nanking, fut le premier poste qu\u2019occupa Yuan Tsou-t\u2019sai : de l\u00e0 il fut envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 \u6c5f\u6d66 Kiung-pou, puis \u00e0 \u6dee\u967d Chou-yang* ressortissant \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne capitale du sud, et enfin \u00e0 Nanking m\u00eame, toujours en qualit\u00e9 de Tche-chien. Dans ces divers endroits il s\u2019acquit une grande renomm\u00e9e d\u2019habile et int\u00e9gr\u00e9 administrateur : plein de z\u00e8le, juste et \u00e9quitable, compatissant aux maux des habitans, il s\u2019effor\u00e7ait toujours de se mettre en contact quotidien avec ses administr\u00e9s, d\u2019\u00e9couter patiemment leurs r\u00e9clamations et de trancher leurs diff\u00e9rends bien plus-d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi naturelle que d\u2019apr\u00e8s les codes qui, en Chine comme ailleurs, sont quelquefois injustes. Il avait en quelque sorte devin\u00e9 la maxime de Ch\u00e2teaubriand : \u201cLe salut d\u2019un peuple d\u00e9pend plus encore de l\u2019administration que des lois.\u201d Il fit dispara\u00eetre des pr\u00e9tories nombre d\u2019abus existants et mit \u00e0 la raison les y\u00e2-y ou satellites, cette vermine des tribunaux chinois qui ronge tout ensemble plaignants, d\u00e9fendeurs et t\u00e9moins. Il avait accoutum\u00e9 de dire que \u201cles magistrats doivent tenir s\u00e9v\u00e8rement en bride leurs esclaves et leurs satellites pour qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait aucun obstacle entre eux et le peuple\u201d\u2020. Aussi chacun avait-il libre acc\u00e8s aupr\u00e8s de lui : le premier venu pouvait venir d\u00e9poser une plainte entre ses mains sans passer par des interm\u00e9diaires rapaces. Toute la journ\u00e9e, Yuan Tsou-t\u2019sai si\u00e9geait dans la grande salle d\u2019audience de son pr\u00e9toire dont les portes \u00e9taient ouvertes \u00e0 tout venant : il \u00e9coutait avec soin les r\u00e9clamations qu\u2019on portait \u00e0 son tribunal. Quand il ne s\u2019agissait que d\u2019affaires de peu d\u2019importance ou de diff\u00e9rends sans cons\u00e9quence, Yuan jugeait imm\u00e9diatement afin de ne pas perdre de temps.\n\nYuan Tsou-t\u2019sai s\u2019appliqua surtout \u00e0 r\u00e9primer les vols et les brigandages : il employa \u00e0 cet effet, dit son biographe, un moyen qui r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 sonhait ; il r\u00e9unit les \u912d\u4fdd Chiang-pao ou Maires des villages plac\u00e9s sous sa juridiction et s\u2019enquit minutieusement des volours et des vauriens de la localit\u00e9 ; puis, pour qu\u2019on ne le tromp\u00e2t point, il fit des recherches dans les archives du district et compara les noms de ceux qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s\n\n* Yuan Tsou-t\u2019sai a souvent parl\u00e9 de ces divers endroits dans ses po\u00e9sies : voir passim son recueil, livres XX, XXIV, XXX, XXV, XXVI.\n\n\u2020 \u7232\u5b88\u4ee4\u8005\u7576\u56b4\u675f\u5bb6\u5974\u540f\u5f79\u4f7f\u5b98\u6c11\u7121\u9055\u9694.\n\nBiographies des Hommes C\u00e9l\u00e8bres.\navec ceux qui \u00e9taient inscrits dans les registres : s\u00fbr alors de n'\u00eatre pas dans l'erreur, il fit afficher les noms de ces individus \u00e0 la porte du pr\u00e9toire et promit \u00e0 tous que, s'ils ne commettaient aucune mauvaise action pendant l'espace de trois ans, il effacerait leurs noms : \"les vanriens n'os\u00e8rent plus sortir de chez eux.\"\n\nL'auteur des Biographies rapporte plusieurs affaires que Yuan Tsen-t'sai trancha avec autant d'intelligence que d'habilet\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re rappelle de loin le jugement de Salomon, quoique le grand roi n'eut pu r\u00e9gler de m\u00eame la dispute de la vraie et de la fausse m\u00e8re. Deux individus se disputaient la possession d'un terrain sis au del\u00e0 de la rivi\u00e8re et de la grotte de Fang-chan (Montagne carr\u00e9e) : ni l'un ni l'autre n'avaient de pi\u00e8ces pour prouver leurs pr\u00e9tentions. Ce proc\u00e8s durait depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es : on ne savait comment le terminer. Lorsque Yuan vit la montagne des pi\u00e8ces et documents ayant rapport \u00e0 cette affaire, il dit en riant : \"cela rappelle la plaine de Yu-tch'ang-toun-ki\u00e9ou qui existait entre les deux pays de Tsin et de Tcheng et que, au dire de Ts\u00f4 Ki\u00e9ou-ming, ces deux \u00c9tats se disputaient. Ce proc\u00e8s a dur\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 trop longtemps ; il a ruin\u00e9 deux familles. Je vais vous le terminer.\" Il repoussa alors tous les documents, partagea le terrain contest\u00e9 en deux parts qu'il distribua aux deux plaigneurs et d\u00e9livra \u00e0 chacun d'eux un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. \"Ceux qui apprirent la mani\u00e8re dont la question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue furent transport\u00e9s d'admiration.\"\n\nUne autre fois, on amena \u00e0 son tribunal un colporteur qui, possesseur d'un bateau, allait de rivi\u00e8re en rivi\u00e8re vendre de la toile. Un abordage venait d'avoir lieu entre le bateau de cet industriel et une canonni\u00e8re de rivi\u00e8re : un des soldats appartenant \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipage de ce \"navire de guerre\" avait \u00e9t\u00e9 noy\u00e9. Yuan vit imm\u00e9diatement que le colporteur n'\u00e9tait coupable que d'une mort par imprudence, et pensa que si on poursuivait l'affaire, le pauvre homme ne saurait manquer de perdre tout ce qu'il poss\u00e9dait. Sous pr\u00e9texte de s'assurer lui-m\u00eame de la fa\u00e7on dont l'accident \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, il se rendit sur le bord de la rivi\u00e8re o\u00f9 \u00e9tait amarr\u00e9e la barque du colporteur : il ordonna \u00e0 ce dernier de hisser sa voile, puis lui dit : \"Profite du bon vent et vas-t-en !\" On pense bien que l'inculp\u00e9 ne se le fit pas dire deux fois. Yuan donna ensuite quelque argent pour faire enterrer le noy\u00e9.\n\nII Bourg d\u00e9pendant du district de Lan, pr\u00e9fecture de Ta\u00ef-yuan, province de Chan-si.\nAinsi finit l'instance qui eut certainement ruin\u00e9 le n\u00e9gociant ambulant.\n\nUn autre jour, Yuan fut saisi d'une affaire dont les cons\u00e9quences enserrent pu \u00eatre f\u00e2cheuses pour lui s'il n'avait su la r\u00e9gler adro\u00eftement. Comme un vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'un des minist\u00e8res, Yn 'Houey-y, r\u00e9cemment nomm\u00e9 Chi\u014d-tai ou Examinateur, se rendait \u00e0 Nanking pour prendre possession de son poste, deux courriers \u00e0 cheval, au verbe haut et \u00e0 l'air insolent, bouscul\u00e8rent son cort\u00e8ge et invectiv\u00e8rent les gens de sa suite. Plainte fut port\u00e9e devant le magistrat le plus voisin, mais les deux courriers se disant les serviteurs d'un prince du sang, le mandarin n'osa pas instruire l'affaire ; Yuan, ne connaissant que son devoir, les fit arr\u00eater incontinent et les interrogea : de leur interrogatoire il r\u00e9sulta qu'ils \u00e9taient porteurs d'une bo\u00eete contenant des lettres du mar\u00e9chal Nien Keng au Vice-roi du Kiang-nan. Yuan ouvrit la bo\u00eete et y trouva dix lettres fort importantes et tr\u00e8s compromettantes pour ces deux hauts fonctionnaires : il les br\u00fbla toutes, fit administrer quelques centaines de coups de bambou aux porteurs et les renvoya.\n\nLa treizi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e K'ien-long (1749), lors de la terrible famine qui ravagea le Kiang-nan, des gens de T'oung-kin, transportant du riz \u00e0 Vou-mcunt, vinrent se plaindre qu'on leur avait vol\u00e9 leur cargaison. Comme la faim avait pu pousser les voleurs \u00e0 commettre une telle action, Yuan Ts'en-ta\u00ef ne voulut pas agir avec rigueur : il fit venir le chef de la bande et l'interrogea. Il d\u00e9couvrit ainsi que l'on n'avait nullement vol\u00e9 du riz aux plaignants, mais seulement emp\u00each\u00e9 ceux-ci d'en vendre : le riz fut rendu aux gens de T'oung-kin et tous furent renvoy\u00e9s chez eux. Avec intelligence et talent, dit son biographe, il tranchait les affaires de ce genre.\n\nYuan Ts'en-ta\u00ef a narr\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame dans une de ses Notes comment ses connaissances litt\u00e9raires lui permirent un jour de r\u00e9gler une question d\u00e9licate soumise \u00e0 son tribunal. \"En 1745, dit-il, j'\u00e9tais tche-chien \u00e0 Nauking. Le 15 du cinqui\u00e8me mois (avril) il s'\u00e9leva un grand vent ; le jour fut tout obscur. Une jeune fille de la ville, Han de son nom de famille, \u00e2g\u00e9e de dix-huit ans, fut enlev\u00e9e par le vent et transport\u00e9e au village de T'oung-kin, \u00e0 quatre-vingt-dix li de la ville. Les habitans de ce hameau lui demand\u00e8rent son nom, s'enqu\u00e9rirent de sa famille\n\n* Village \u00e0 neuf lieues de Nanking.\n\u2020 Un des noms litt\u00e9raires de Sou-tch\u00e9ou.\net, le lendemain, la reconduisirent chez elle. Or, cette jeune fille \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fianc\u00e9e au fils du bachelier Li du quartier de l'Est. Ce Li douta que le vent ait pu transporter quelqu'un \u00e0 quatre-vingt-dix li de distance, et soup\u00e7onna que la jeune fille avait eu quelque rendez-vous suspect. Il porta l'affaire devant le tribunal pour demander l'annulation du contrat. Sachant ce qu'il en \u00e9tait, je lui dis : \"Jadis, un coup de vent a emport\u00e9 une jeune fille \u00e0 six mille li de distance : savez-vous cela ?\" Li ne le crut pas. Je pris l'ouvrage intitul\u00e9 Ling-tch'ouan-tsi, de H\u00f4 Ouen-tchoung, de la dynastie des Yuan, et le lui montrai en disant : \"H\u00f4 a \u00e9t\u00e9 le fid\u00e8le ministre d'une dynastie : est-ce qu'il aurait voulu dire un mensonge ? La jeune fille de Von-menn (Souch\u00e9ou), enlev\u00e9e jadis par le vent, \u00e9pousa un homme qui devint plus tard premier ministre. Je crains bien que votre fils n'ait pas le m\u00eame bonheur que ce dernier.\" Li lut le passage et fut tr\u00e8s content. Les deux familles rest\u00e8rent unies comme auparavant. Le Vice-roi Yn, ayant appris cette solution, dit : \"On peut dire avec raison que, pour magistrats de districts, il faut employer des lettr\u00e9s*.\"\n\nLe Vice-roi de Nanking, Yn Ouen-tonan, que Yuan a cit\u00e9 dans cette page, connaissait les talents du savant tche-chien : il avait la plus grande confiance dans son habilet\u00e9 et son exp\u00e9rience et, toutes les fois qu'il se pr\u00e9sentait quelque affaire difficile \u00e0 traiter, il avait recours \u00e0 ses lumi\u00e8res. \u00c0 plusieurs reprises, le Vice-roi signala \u00e0 l'empereur le z\u00e8le, l'intelligence, l'aptitude pour l'administration et le profond savoir de son subordonn\u00e9.\n\nAim\u00e9 des ses chefs, ch\u00e9ri des populations\u2020, Yuan semblait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 parcourir une brillante carri\u00e8re : sans doute il fut parvenu aux premi\u00e8res dignit\u00e9s de l'Etat, si une grave maladie, due \u00e0 un travail trop assidu et trop consid\u00e9rable (car il menait de front les \u00e9tudes litt\u00e9raires et les obligations de sa charge), ne l'e\u00fbt contraint \u00e0 demander un cong\u00e9 et \u00e0 se confiner dans sa famille pendant quelque temps. Revenu \u00e0 la sant\u00e9, mais rest\u00e9 aigri et morose, il re\u00e7ut l'ordre de se rendre dans la province du Chan-si\n\n* Souei-yuan-che-hou\u00e9, livre IV.\n\u2020 Notre po\u00e8te a \u00e9crit, dans ses stances chi-la\u00f3, Plaisirs du vieil \u00e2ge :\n\n\u5341\u8f09\u5bb0\u5b98\u8eab\u3002\u540f\u6c11\u5c1a\u61f7\u5fb7\u3002\nPendant dix ann\u00e9es je fus magistrat de district,\nMes employ\u00e9s et mes administr\u00e9s se rappellent encore mes vertus.\npour y prendre la direction d'un district : l\u00e0, malheureusement, il ne put s'entendre avec son chef direct le Vice-roi 'Huang Ning-kouei. De froissements continnels, les deux mandarins en vinrent \u00e0 des paroles acerb\u00e9es : bref une brouille compl\u00e8te s'ensuivit. Ne voulant plus continuer \u00e0 servir l'empereur dans des conditions si difficiles et si d\u00e9licates, Yuan pr\u00e9senta une nouvelle demande de cong\u00e9, que le Vice-roi, charm\u00e9 de se d\u00e9barrasser ainsi d'un inf\u00e9rieur qui le g\u00eanait et le contrecarrait souvent, appuya de toute son influence : Yuan fut autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 se retirer dans sa famille ; il avait alors quarante ans.\n\nIII.\n\nRentr\u00e9 dans la vie priv\u00e9e, ma\u00eetre \u00e0 sa guise de tous ses instants, il s'adonna d\u00e8s lors tout entier aux Belles-lettres, et, pour n'\u00eatre point distrait de ses \u00e9tudes par les soucis de ce monde, il fut se fixer dans un jardin qu'il avait achet\u00e9 aux portes de Nanking, alors qu'il \u00e9tait l'un des tche-chien de cette ancienne capitale.\n\nDans ses Essais litt\u00e9raires, il a laiss\u00e9 quelques notes sur ce jardin, son histoire, ses environs, etc. ; j'en extrais et traduis les passages suivants*.\n\n\"A deux li \u00e0 l'ouest du pont de la porte septentrionale de Nanking, je trouvai le \u5c0f\u5009\u5c71 siao-ts'ang-chan, la Colline du Grenier. Se d\u00e9tachant de la montagne \u6e05\u6dbc Ts'ing-leang, cette hauteur formait deux pics et venait mourir au pied du pont : longue et \u00e9troite, elle faisait mille zigzags. Au centre \u00e9tait un \u00e9tang limpide entour\u00e9 de champs humides : son nom vulgaire \u00e9tait \u4e7e\u6cb3 Kan-'ho (Rivi\u00e8re s\u00e8che.) Le Ts'ing-leang-chan \u00e9tait jadis la r\u00e9sidence d'\u00e9t\u00e9 des empereurs des T'ang m\u00e9ridionaux\u2020. Du sommet de la Colline du Grenier on aper\u00e7oit tous les lieux et sites renomm\u00e9s de Nanking et de ses environs : au nord-est, le \u96de\u9cf4\u5bfa Ki-ming-sseu, Temple du Chant du Coq ; au sud-est, le \u83ab\u6101\u6e56 M\u00f4-tch'\u00eaou-'hou, Lac sans chagrins ; au nord, le \u937e\u5c71 Tehoung-chan, Mont de la Cloche ; au sud le \u96e8\u82b1\u81fa Yu-'hou\u00e2-t'uai, Terrasse des fleurs qui tombent en forme de pluie, etc., etc.\n\n* \u5c0f\u5009\u5c71\u623f\u6587\u96c6 Siao-ts'ang-chan-fung-ouen-tsi, Recueil de litt\u00e9rature de la maison de la Colline du Grenier, livre XII, \u96a8\u5712\u8a18 Souet-yuan-ki, Histoire du Souei-yuan.\n\n\u2020 \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque des \u4e94\u4ee3 ou-tai ou cinq dynasties, les \u5357\u5510 Nan T'ang ou T'ang m\u00e9ridionaux ont r\u00e9gn\u00e9 de 923 \u00e0 936 de notre \u00e8re.\nL\u00e0, au temps de l'empereur Kang-chi, un certain Souei, Directeur de la Fabrique Imp\u00e9riale de Soieries, avait \u00e9lev\u00e9 un pavillon sur le pic septentrional de la Colline, avait plant\u00e9 autour des arbres, des arbustes, et avait circonscrit le tout d'un mur. Tous les habitans de Nanking venaient se promener et admirer la nature dans cet endroit : on l'appelait Souei-yuan, Jardin de Souei, du nom de son propri\u00e9taire.\n\n\"Trente ans plus tard, lorsque je fus nomm\u00e9 Tche-chien \u00e0 Nanking, ce jardin \u00e9tait presque enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9truit et le pavillon s'\u00e9tait transform\u00e9 en un vulgaire cabaret o\u00f9 les charrettiers et les porteurs de chaises se disputaient tout le jour. Les oiseaux ne voulaient plus r\u00e9sider en ce lieu ; les fleurs elles-m\u00eames, malgr\u00e9 les z\u00e9phyrs du printemps, se refusaient \u00e0 fleurir. A cette vue j'eus le c\u0153ur serr\u00e9 ; je pris ce jardin en piti\u00e9 et demandai le prix du terrain : il \u00e9tait de trois cents taels.

Plusieurs parents de Yuan y avaient leur place naturellement marqu\u00e9e. Sa famille \u00e9tait po\u00e9tique : ses trois s\u0153urs faisaient des vers\u2020 et deux de ses neveux, Ouang Lan-fou et Me\u00ef-kiun, versifiaient agr\u00e9ablement\u2021.\n\nDe temps en temps on se r\u00e9unissait au Souei-yuan pour lire des vers, pour discuter sur le style et sur le go\u00fbt, enfin pour go\u00fbter en commun, comme parle Pellisson dans l\u2019Histoire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, \u201cles plaisirs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des esprits et de la vie raisonnable.\u201d La journ\u00e9e se passait en causeries, en tournois po\u00e9tiques ; \u00e0 la nuit tombante, une table charg\u00e9e des mets les plus d\u00e9licats r\u00e9conciliait vainqueurs et vaincus, et, apr\u00e8s le d\u00eener, les convives se promenaient dans le jardin \u00e9clair\u00e9 \u00e0 Giorno, \u00e0 la lueur de mille lanternes multicolores.

Yuan Tseu-t\u2019sai pr\u00eatait sa maison \u00e0 ces assembl\u00e9es pacifiques mais \u00e9tait loin d\u2019observer la m\u00eame prudence, car, pr\u00e9sident de fait et de droit, il prenait part active \u00e0 toutes les discussions litt\u00e9raires, passait sentence sur tel ou tel point en litige et discourait agr\u00e9ablement sur la litt\u00e9rature en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et la po\u00e9sie en particulier.\n\n* Leurs \u0153uvres, sans doute retouch\u00e9es par le Ma\u00eetre, font partie de la collection Souei-yuan-san-che-tchoung.\n\n\u2020 Yuan Tseu-t\u2019sai a maintes fois parl\u00e9 de ses s\u0153urs dans ses vers, ses lettres et ses notes : \u80fd\u8a69, elles pouvaient versifier, a-t-il dit souvent (Voir entr\u2019autres, Che-houd, livre X).\n\n\u2021 Dans le Souei-yuan-che-houd, Yuan Tseu-t\u2019sai a laiss\u00e9 quelques lignes sur \u6c6a\u862d\u5712 Ouang Lan-fou, surnomm\u00e9 \u5ead\u8431 Ting-y : il a m\u00eame cit\u00e9 plusieurs vers dus \u00e0 son pinceau.

On sait le vers sarcastique et peut-\u00eatre trop mordant de Boileau :\n\n... ... Imitant de Conrart le silence prudent.\nNotre po\u00e8te d\u00e9pensa ainsi la seconde partie de sa vie au milieu d'occupations litt\u00e9raires, de discussions, de critiques et de causes-r\u00e9es ; la vieillesse m\u00eame, qui fut cl\u00e9mente et douce pour lui, ne lui fit pas tomber le pinceau des mains : jusqu'\u00e0 son dernier jour les Muses lui sourirent. Parfois, sans doute, il tenta de les fuir, et les premi\u00e8res atteintes de l'\u00e2ge lui firent dire : \"la po\u00e9sie est comme la sant\u00e9 ; quand l'homme devient vieux, sa sant\u00e9 est ruin\u00e9e.\" et\n\n\u9daf\u8001\u83ab\u8abf\u820c \u4eba\u8001\u83ab\u4f5c\u8a69\n\nLorsque le loriot devient vieux, il ne remue plus la langue (ne chante plus) ;\nQuand l'homme vieillit, il ne fait plus de vers*.\n\nMais un po\u00e8te ne peut renoncer \u00e0 ses premi\u00e8res amours : une fois qu'on a sacrifi\u00e9 aux Muses, il est impossible de leur \u00eatre infid\u00e8le. Voltaire, lui aussi, d\u00e9clarait \u00e0 quarante-trois-ans qu'il ne voulait plus faire de vers et qu'on peut \"\u00eatre pape et empereur dans la plus extr\u00eame vieillesse, mais non pas po\u00e8te,\" et il annon\u00e7ait qu'il allait \"donner son automne et son hiver \u00e0 des choses plus faciles\u2020.\" Il ne se tint pas parole, comme l'on sait, puisque, malade et octog\u00e9naire, il versifiait encore. Yuan Tsen-ts'ai fit de m\u00eame : apr\u00e8s avoir jur\u00e9 de renoncer aux Muses il se laissa de nouveaux s\u00e9duire par leurs attractions. On peut toutefois dire, \u00e0 sa louange, que l'\u00e2ge n'influa gu\u00e8re sur son talent : la meilleure preuve, c'est qu'il \u00e9crivit la jolie pi\u00e8ce \u559c\u8001 Chi-lao, les Plaisirs du vieil \u00e2ge, lorsqu'il \u00e9tait presque aux portes du tombeau, et ces stances ne sont certes pas les moins bonnes de celles qui composent son \u0153uvre po\u00e9tique.\n\nEntour\u00e9 de l'affection des siens, de l'estime et de l'admiration des ses contemporains\u2021, Yuan Tsen-ts'ai v\u00e9cut jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de quatre-vingt-un ans, ou, comme les chinois comptent, de quatre-vingt-deux ans, et mourut dans le courant du onzi\u00e8me mois de la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e Kia-king (18 d\u00e9cembre 1797 \u00e0 17 janvier 1798).\n\n* Souei-yuan-che-'houa, livre XIV.\n\u2020 Correspondance de Voltaire.\n\u2021 On peut en voir pour ainsi dire la mesure dans les stances qui lui furent adress\u00e9es \u00e0 l'occasion du 80e. anniversaire de sa naissance (\u516b \u5341 \u5bff) par les plus hauts fonctionnaires et les plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres lettr\u00e9s de l'empire : treize cents pi\u00e8ces de po\u00e9sies lui furent alors offertes. Un millier environ a trouv\u00e9 place dans le Souei-yuan-san-che-tchoung.\nIV.\n\n\"Yuan Tseu-tsa\u00ef, nous dit son biographe chinois, \u00e9tait grand de sa personne ; il n'avait qu'un seul d\u00e9faut, il n'agissait qu'\u00e0 sa guise et n'observait aucune r\u00e8gle. Toute sa vie, il mit en pratique les cinq vertus cardinales, les cinq relations sociales et les devoirs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des parents : il traita toujours avec la plus grande piet\u00e9 filiale sa m\u00e8re qui v\u00e9cut jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de quatre-vingt-quatorze ans*. Il se montra toujours bon pour ses s\u0153urs dont trois pouvaient aussi faire des vers. Lorsque sa s\u0153ur ain\u00e9e devint veuve, il la fit venir aupr\u00e8s de lui et la garda jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort qui eut lieu \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de quatre-vingt-dix ans\u2020.\n\n\"Il pratiqua constamment les devoirs de l'amiti\u00e9 : un de ses amis peu fortun\u00e9, qui lui avait emprunt\u00e9 cinq mille taels, \u00e9tant venu \u00e0 mourir, Yuan lui fit faire des fun\u00e9railles et br\u00fbla la reconnaissance de la dette ; il fit plus encore : il prit sous sa protection le fils de son ami rest\u00e9 orphelin. Pendant trente ann\u00e9es, il alla r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faire les sacrifices usuels sur la tombe d'un autre de ses amis.\"\n\nYuan Tseu-tsa\u00ef n'avait pas qu'un seul d\u00e9faut, comme le dit si charitablement son biographe : il en avait plusieurs, et m\u00eame de grands. \"Constamment, il \u00e9tait amoureux des femmes et du vin.\" Il tournait un peu au genre anacr\u00e9ontique. D\u00e9crivant son jardin en vers \u00e9l\u00e9gants et gracieux, il a dit au sujet de ses kiosques et de ses pavillons :\n\n\u5404\u653e\u786f\u4e00\u5177 \u5404\u5b89\u7b46\u6578\u679d\n\nDans chacun j'ai plac\u00e9 un encrier,\nDans chacun j'ai d\u00e9pos\u00e9 quelques pinceaux . . .\u2020\n\nIl eut pu ajouter avec raison, qu'\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ces engins litt\u00e9raires se trouvaient invariablement dispos\u00e9s plusieurs tasses et un vase \u00e0 vin. Au reste, il semble que souvent les grands po\u00e8tes ont aim\u00e9 chercher des inspirations au fond de la \"dive bouteille.\" Ennius avait fort affection\u00e9 le vin ; Cratinus avait pr\u00e9tendu que\n\n* Il a dit lui-m\u00eame :\n\n\u990a\u6bcd\u4e09\u5341\u5e74 \u6668\u660f\u5e38\u4f8d\u5074\nPendant trente ans j'ai entour\u00e9 de soins ma m\u00e8re :\nMatin et soir, j'\u00e9tais toujours \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s, attendant ses ordres.\n\n\u2020 \u8001\u59ca\u76f8\u4f9d\u4f4f\nMa vieille s\u0153ur ain\u00e9e habite avec moi.\n\n\u2021 \u96a8\u5712\u96dc\u8208, Sur le jardin de Souei, Recueil, livre VI.\n\u201csans le vin on ne pouvait rien faire de bon en po\u00e9sie.\u201d Enfin Bacchus lui-m\u00eame avait admis les po\u00e8tes dans son cort\u00e8ge, au milieu des satyres et des fannes. Notre po\u00e8te, pour s\u2019excuser, pouvait d\u2019ailleurs citer en Chine m\u00eame d\u2019illustres exemples : entr\u2019autres celui de Li T\u2019ai-p\u00f4, l\u2019un des chefs de la Pl\u00e9iade des T\u2019ang : ce dernier avait des habitudes toutes bacchiques et un vase de \u73ab\u7470\u9152 Mei-kouei-lou, Ros\u00e9e de la rose, ou de \u7d05\u9152 Chao-ching-tsi\u00e9ou, vin de Cha\u00f4-ching, \u00e9tait une sorte d\u2019Hippocr\u00e8ne qu\u2019il se plaisait \u00e0 voir jaillir sous ses pas.* On peut donc dire que la plupart des \u201cNourrissons des Muses\u201d ont sacrifi\u00e9 au vin et que bien des pi\u00e8ces que nous admirons aujourd\u2019hui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites par un pinceau l\u00e9g\u00e8rement vacillant entre les doigts allourdis du po\u00e8te.\n\nYnan Tseu-t\u2019sai fut presque universel : tour \u00e0 tour philosophe, critique, historien, biographe, po\u00e8te, nouvelliste, il m\u00e9riterait en outre d\u2019\u00eatre appel\u00e9 le Brillat-Savarin chinois, puisqu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un Manuel de Cuisine et de Physiologie du go\u00fbt qui n\u2019est pas la partie la moins curieuse de ses \u0153uvres. Mais, de l\u2019avenir m\u00eame des lettr\u00e9s chinois, ce fut dans le genre po\u00e9tique qu\u2019il r\u00e9ussit le mieux et qu\u2019il se distingua le plus. \u201cLa po\u00e9sie, dit son biographe, n\u2019avait plus de difficult\u00e9s ni de secrets pour-lui ; il atteignit en ce genre une hauteur \u00e0 laquelle personne n\u2019\u00e9tait encore parvenu. Aussi nul, depuis les plus hautes fonctionnaires jusqu\u2019aux commer\u00e7ants et aux colporteurs, ne peut se lasser d\u2019estimer et d\u2019admirer la collection de ses po\u00e9sies.

Je le savais bien ; je dis alors : Les po\u00e9sies sont comme les fleurs qui naissent naturellement ; au printemps, c'est l'\u00e9pidendrum ; en \u00e9t\u00e9, c'est la Chrysanth\u00e8me. Chacune a son temps marqu\u00e9 pour fleurir ; chacune doit admettre qu'on estime les unes et m\u00e9prise les autres. La po\u00e9sie est un art sophistiqu\u00e9, qui est toujours aux r\u00e8gles, qui rend...\nen soi. Jamais il ne croyait avoir fait quelque chose de bien. Maintes fois il remettait son \u0153uvre sur le m\u00e9tier pour le polir \u00e0 nouveau. Il n\u2019agissait point comme certains hommes de g\u00e9nie qui, croyant toujours bien faire, produisent \u00e0 toute vapeur des volumes de tous formats, productions h\u00e2tives que le public accueille avec faveur seulement parce qu\u2019elles sont sign\u00e9es d\u2019un nom illustre. Plusieurs personnes ayant r\u00e9uni quelques uns de ses jugements et morceaux po\u00e9tiques, les firent imprimer et r\u00e9pandre partout: Yuan leur dit que \u201ccela ne valait pas grand chose et qu\u2019il ne fallait pas agir ainsi.\u201d N\u00e9anmoins, il savait lui-m\u00eame fort bien la valeur de son talent et il \u00e9tait loin de s\u2019affubler d\u2019une rougissante modestie : il a dit en effet\u2014un peu pompusement peut-\u00eatre\u2014dans une de ses po\u00e9sies :\n\nSous les trois derniers empereurs* qui peut m\u2019\u00eatre compar\u00e9 en litt\u00e9rature\u2020 !\n\nYuan Tseu-t\u2019ai \u00e9tait un lettr\u00e9 dans toute l\u2019acception du mot; il mettait sans cesse en pratique cette parole de Confucius:\n\n(t\u2019ai-p\u00f4), Tou (Fou), Han (Yu), P\u00f4 (King), sous les T\u2019ang ; \u00d4 (Yang-si\u00e8ou), Sou (Toung-p\u00f4), Lou (Ki\u00e8ou-yuan), Fan (Tsou-yu), sous les Sonng, sont regard\u00e9s, comme de grands po\u00e8tes (\u5927\u5bb6). Si l\u2019on voulait absolument \u00e9l\u00e9ver un seul homme pour dominer toute une dynastie, c\u2019est comme si on faisait de la pivoine la reine des fleurs : il ne faut pas oublier que l\u2019\u00e9pidendrum a aussi un parfum royal. On ne peut donc dire quelle est la premi\u00e8re des plantes : \u00e0 plus forte raison ne peut-on le faire pour les po\u00e9sies.\u201d\n\n(Souei-yuan-che-ihoua, livre III).\n\n* Il \u00e9crivait ceci sous Kia-king, ayant vu les r\u00e8gnes de K\u2019ang-chi, de Young-tcheng et de K\u2019ien-loung.\n\n\u2020 Au reste, les po\u00e8tes ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas modestes : c\u2019est le moindre de leurs d\u00e9fauts. La princesse de Conti disait un jour \u00e0 Malherbe : \u201cJe veux vous montrer les plus beaux vers du monde, que vous n\u2019avez point vus.\u2014Pardonnez-moi, Madame, r\u00e9pondit le po\u00e8te, je les ai vus ; car, s\u2019ils sont les plus beaux du monde, il faut n\u00e9cessairement que ce soit moi qui les aie faits.\u201d \u2014Le m\u00eame Malherbe disait en vers :\n\nApollon \u00e0 portes ouvertes,\nLaisse indiff\u00e9remment cueillir\nCes belles feuilles toujours vertes\nQui gardent les noms de vieillir :\nMais l\u2019art d\u2019en faire des couronnes\nN\u2019est su que de peu de personnes ;\nEt trois ou quatre seulement,\nAu nombre desquels on me range,\nPeuvent donner une louange\nQui demeure \u00e9ternellement.\n\net ailleurs :\n\nLes puissantes faveurs dont Parnasse m\u2019honore ;\nNon loin de mon berceau commenc\u00e8rent leur cours ;\nJe les poss\u00e9dai jeune, et les poss\u00e8de encore\nAu d\u00e9clin de mes jours.\nEtudiez toujours comme si vous n'\u00e9tiez pas arriv\u00e9 (\u00e0 la science) ; Craignez de plus de perdre ce que vous savez*. \"Etudiez, disait-il, et vous saurez que vous ne savez pas assez : il est \u00e9vident que ceux qui croient assez savoir sont des gens qui n'\u00e9tudient pas. Il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant alors qu'ils se croient sup\u00e9rieurs aux autres\u2020.\" Il avait pour les Belles-lettres un amour solide, et j'ajouterai, d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 : s'instruire \u00e9tait son but. Il travaillait pour la gloire et n'admettait pas qu'un sordide gain put \u00eatre l'objet d'un \u00e9crivain. Souvent il s'\u00e9levait contre la tendance de ses contemporains \u00e0 se faire un marche-pied de la litt\u00e9rature pour parvenir aux honneurs et \u00e0 la fortune : de nos jours, s'\u00e9criait-il\u2021, on ne prend de le\u00e7on d'un ma\u00eetre que dans le dessein unique de r\u00e9ussir aux examens \u7232\u79d1\u7b2c\u8d77\u898b\u00a7 ; puis, quand on a r\u00e9ussi, on est comme le p\u00eacheur qui oublie le filet apr\u00e8s avoir pris le poisson \u79d1\u7b2c\u65e2\u5f97\u800c\u5f97\u9b5a\u5fd8\u7b4c\u2225.\"\n\nLe meilleur conseil qu'il croyait pouvoir donner \u00e0 ceux qui veulent faire des vers \u00e9tait d'\u00e9tudier les anciens : \"il n'y a personne, disait-il, qui puisse faire des vers sans avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les anciens\u00b6\" et il recommandait la lecture assidue et intelligente des \u0153uvres de quatre grands po\u00e8tes : Li T'ai-po, Tou Fou, Han Yu, de la pl\u00e9iade des T'ang, et de Son Tonng-p\u00f4, de la dynastie des Soungh** : il les citait \u00e0 tout propos comme des mod\u00e8les. Cependant, il ne voulait pas qu'on se born\u00e2t \u00e0 les imiter servilement : il d\u00e9sirait qu'on e\u00fbt en soi, comme parle Montaigne, une \"condition aucurement singeresse et imitatrice,\" une condition intelligente et judicieuse : \"Ceux qui ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s doivent \u00eatre comme les p\u00eacheurs qui apr\u00e8s avoir pris le poisson, oublient le filet dont ils se sont servi\u2020\u2020\" c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'une fois qu'on\n\n---\n\n* Loun-yu, Morceaux de Controverse, chap.

Les grands sujets et les morceaux de longue haleine ne sont pas du tout leur fait : ils paraissent s'en \u00e9carter avec une sorte de crainte m\u00eal\u00e9e de respect. Yuan Tsen-t'sai n'a donc produit que des petites pi\u00e8ces, des miniatures po\u00e9tiques : mais toutes sont finement cisel\u00e9es et valent certes mieux que bien des longs po\u00e8mes. Dou\u00e9 d'une \u00e2me tendre et d'une imagination \u00e9mue, mais aussi d'un scepticisme endiabl\u00e9, il a su mettre dans ses vers de jolis traits de sentiment, de gracieuses images, une vivacit\u00e9 et une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de description qui charment et qui enchantent. Son vers facile condoie de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s la prose: pas de recherche, pas d'affectation, il semble parler en vers. Le sujet n'y est pas celui sous un amas de fleurs et d'\u00e9pines : on dirait que le pr\u00e9cepte de Pascal: \"Il faut se renfermer le plus possible dans le simple naturel\" a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la devise de notre po\u00e8te: il n'a nullement la d\u00e9mangeaison de briller, il ne se charge pas de d\u00e9tails inutiles, ni de tournures lourdes et obscures : sans doute il fait souvent appel aux tien-kou, aux allusions litt\u00e9raires et historiques, aux figures des anciens temps : ce n'est pas toutefois, comme la plupart des po\u00e8tes de nos jours, pour faire parade d'une vaine \u00e9rudition: il s'assimile ces expressions anciennes, les fait entrer dans ses vers sans nulle violence, et\n\nT\u00e2che de rendre sien cet air d'antiquit\u00e9\u2020.\n\n* Andr\u00e9 de Ch\u00e9nier, ardent disciple des anciens, a dit dans une pi\u00e8ce dont je ne puis malheureusement citer que des fragments:\n\nJe lui montrerai l'art, ignor\u00e9 du vulgaire,\nDe s\u00e9parer aux yeux, en suivant leur lien,\nTous ces m\u00e9taux unis dont j'ai form\u00e9 le mien . . .\nTant\u00f4t chez un auteur j'adopte une pens\u00e9e,\nMais qui rev\u00eat, chez moi, souvent entrelac\u00e9e,\nMes images, mon tour, jeune et frais ornement;\nTant\u00f4t je ne retiens que les mots seulement;\nJ'en d\u00e9tourne le sens, et l'art sait les contraindre\nVers des objets nouveaux qu'ils s'\u00e9tonnent de peindre.\n\n\u2020 La Fontaine, le Culte des Anciens, \u00e0 Mgr. l'Ev\u00eaque de Soissons.\nSans faire un inventaire minutieux des \u00e9l\u00e9ments et ornements po\u00e9tiques auxquels notre po\u00e8te a eu recours dans ses vers, je crois cependant utile et int\u00e9ressant d'en signaler ici les principaux : les sources les plus f\u00e9condes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pour lui l'histoire, la l\u00e9gende, la mythologie, la th\u00e9ologie, la g\u00e9ographie et l'astronomie.\n\nChez les Chinois, l'histoire ancienne et la l\u00e9gende ont \u00e9t\u00e9 deux soeurs jumelles : la seconde est presque ins\u00e9parable de la premi\u00e8re. Yuan Tseu-tsa\u00ef a donc puis\u00e9 dans l'une comme dans l'autre : dans ses vers, l'historique Yu, le Grand Yu, de la dynastie des Chia, marche \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du l\u00e9gendaire Fou-chi, le fondateur de la monarchie. Souvent les faits historiques ne sont indiqu\u00e9s que par un mot, par une expression : c'est \u00e0 la sagacit\u00e9, ou plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l'\u00e9rudition du lecteur, \u00e0 comprendre l'allusion, \u00e0 la d\u00e9velopper et \u00e0 en d\u00e9couvrir toutes les finesse. Tout le corps des Annales a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 contribution par le po\u00e8te : mais il semble toutefois que celui-ci ait eu une pr\u00e9dilection marqu\u00e9e pour le Che-ki, ou M\u00e9moires historiques de l'historien Sseu-ma Ts'ien. Le style concis \u00e0 la Tacite de cet ouvrage, les pens\u00e9es hautes ou nobles qui y sont sem\u00e9es, un air tout ensemble simple et grand qu'on y voit \u00e0 chaque page devaient attirer un esprit comme celui de Yuan. Il faut avoir lu, \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le Che-ki et ses commentaires pour bien saisir le sens de la plupart des po\u00e9sies de notre auteur. Je ne citerai que quelques vers pour montrer l'emploi de ces ornements po\u00e9tiques : ils sont extraits de la pi\u00e8ce intitul\u00e9e \u695a\u59cb\u7687\u9675 Mansol\u00e9 de Ts'in Che-houang*, morceau excessivement difficile qui est une sorte de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des principaux \u00e9v\u00e9nements du r\u00e8gne de cet empereur et que l'on ne peut entendre sans l'intelligence des M\u00e9moires historiques\u2020 :\n\n* Recueil des Po\u00e9sies, livre VIII.\n\u2020 Il est \u00e9crit dans le style \u00e9lev\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u53e4\u98a8 kou-foung, en vers in\u00e9gaux de cinq, sept et neuf pieds : ce style exige des expressions pomp\u00e9es, de profondes pens\u00e9es, une recherche excessive et, par suite, il est h\u00e9risse de mille difficult\u00e9s.\nLe Dragon Anc\u00eatre (1), natif de Han-tan (2),\nIssu d'une Marchandise rare qui attendait un acheteur (3),\nAvait les yeux du vautour et la voix du loup :\nSa f\u00e9rocit\u00e9 n'a pas eu d'\u00e9gal dans toute l'antiquit\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9teint l'empire gouvern\u00e9 par la Maison des Tch\u00e9ou\ndepuis huit cents ans (4),\nIl a de plus balay\u00e9, comme de la cendre, les trois\nEmpereurs et les cinq Souverains (5)\nSa ceinture de la Grande Muraille \u00e9tait le mur de la Chine (6)\nLes statues d'or brillaient d'un \u00e9clat et le bronze reluisait (7)\n...

Cette femme \u00e9tait connue sous le nom de Han-tan-fou-jen, la Dame de Han-tan ; elle \u00e9tait d'une bonne famille de cette ville ; elle excellait \u00e0 chanter et \u00e0 danser (Cf. la biographie de Lu Pou-ouei dans le Che-ki, livre LXXXVI).

Le mot du tyran d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant l'autodaf\u00e9 de la litt\u00e9rature chinoise, tel qu'il nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9 par Sseu-ma Ts'ien, est des plus \u00e9nergiques et m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre cit\u00e9 : \"puisque j'ai r\u00e9uni le monde (\u5929\u4e0b i.e. tout l'empire) sous ma domination, dit Che-houang-ti, les livres sont inutiles \u975e\u4e0d\u4e2d\u7528, d\u00e9truis-les tous ! \u71d2\u53bb\u4e4b (Che-ki, livre VI.)\u2014Les San-houang, Trois Empereurs, sont Fou-chi, Chen-noung et Houang-ti (cf. Mayers, p. 297, No. 24). Les Ou-ti, cinq souverains, sont T'ai-ha\u00f4, Yen-ti, Houang-ti, Cha\u00f4-ha\u00f4, Tch'ouan-chiu (cf. Mayers, p. 319, No. 168.)\n\n(6)\u2014On sait que ce fut Che-houang-ti qui con\u00e7ut le projet de construire le \u842c\u91cc\u9577\u57ce Ouan-li-tch'ang teh'eng, la Grande Muraille, pour mettre ses \u00c9tats \u00e0 l'abri des incursions des Tartares : il mourut du reste sans l'avoir achev\u00e9e.\n\n(7)\u2014Allusion \u00e0 douze statues que l'empereur fit faire : \"Che-houang-ti donna l'ordre de r\u00e9unir toutes les armes de l'empire : il les amassa \u00e0 Chien-yang, sa ville capitale, puis il les fit fondre et faire une cloche et douze hommes d'or qui pesaient chacun mille \u65a4 tan. Il fit placer ces statues au milieu de son palais.\" Tel est le texte m\u00eame du Che-ki, livre VI ; les commentaires nous fournissent les d\u00e9tails suivants : La vingti\u00e8me ann\u00e9e de r\u00e8gne de Che-houang-ti, vinrent \u00e0 la cour douze hommes de cinq toises de haut, ayant des pieds de six pieds de long, habill\u00e9s \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re des barbares. L'empereur voulut conserver et transmettre leur image \u00e0 la post\u00e9rit\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence il mit \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution un projet qu'il m\u00e9ditait depuis longtemps : craignant, comme tout despote, que ses peuples ne se r\u00e9voltassent contre son autorit\u00e9, il ordonna que quiconque de ses sujets aurait des armes serait tenu de les livrer. Toutes ces armes furent accumul\u00e9es dans l'arsenal de Chien-yang et fondues. Il para\u00eet qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque la plupart des engins de guerre \u00e9taient en cuivre : les statues furent sans doute faites avec ce cuivre et n'\u00e9taient donc pas en or. Un livre rapporte qu'elles pesaient 240,000 \u65a4 kin ou livres chinoises l'une. Elles existaient encore \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des Han et s'\u00e9levaient \u00e0 la porte du palais de la Grande Joie (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae). Le \u9b4f\u5fd7 Oue\u00ef-tche nous apprend ce qu'il advint de ces \u0153uvres d'art (Biographie de Toung Tch\u00f4) : \"l'usurpateur Toung Tch\u00f4 (sur leq. voir Mayers, No. 687) en brisa dix avec sa massue, ainsi que la cloche (\u9418\u9438), pour en faire de petites sap\u00e8ques.\" Les deux autres auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truites plus tard par Fou-kien, lorsque ce rebelle entra en vainqueur \u00e0 Tch'ang-an, la capitale d'alors (cf. Mayers, No. 141).\n\n(8)\u2014De ces deux hauteurs le T'ai-chan est la plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, elle est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 cinq li au nord de T'ai-an-tou, province du Chan-toung. C'est l'orientale des Ou-y\u00f4 ou cinq montagnes sacr\u00e9es.\n\n(9)\u2014Le Che-ki, livre VI, mentionne un certain \u5f90\u5e02 Siu Che qui adressa \u00e0 l'empereur un m\u00e9moire dans lequel il disait \"qu'il y avait\ndans la mer trois montagnes (\u00eeles) surnaturelles (\u4e09\u795e\u5c71) appel\u00e9es \u84ec\u840a P'oung-lai, \u65b9\u4e08 Fang-tchung et \u6f22\u6d32 Yng-tch\u00e9ou, habit\u00e9es par des g\u00e9nies,\" il demandait en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 aller \u00e0 leur recherche avec des jeunes gens et des jeunes filles (\u7ae5\u7537\u5973). L'empereur acc\u00e9da \u00e0 cette demande et envoya l'explorateur, accompagn\u00e9 de plusieurs milliers de jeunes compagons, \u00e0 la recherche des g\u00e9nies. \u5973\u6578\u5343\u5165\u6d77\u6c42\u50b3\u4eba\" (Che-ki loco citato.) Il faut sans doute voir l\u00e0 une tentative de colonisation d'un pays jusqu'alors peu connu, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame de quelque \u00eeles du Japon (cf. Mayers, No. 647.)\n\nYuan Tseu-ts'a\u00ef n'a pas seulement emprunt\u00e9 des id\u00e9es ou des expressions \u00e0 la th\u00e9ologie, il lui a de plus d\u00e9coch\u00e9 des traits mordants et satiriques qui l'ensent impitoyablement fait chasser par Platon de la R\u00e9publique id\u00e9ale de ce philosophe. Cependant, sans imiter Socrate qui combattait la religion m\u00eame de l'Etat, renversait le culte h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire et paternel, il semblait plut\u00f4t suivre Aristophane et s'en prenait \u00e0 la th\u00e9ologie publique, \u00e0 la religion populaire : pour lui, mod\u00e8le du lettr\u00e9, la doctrine de Confucius \u00e9tait chose sacr\u00e9e, mais la religion du profanum vulgus, le bouddhisme, il la ha\u00efssait et ne cessait de la ridiculiser. \"Je n'aime pas la doctrine de F\u00f4 (Bouddha), a-t-il dit maintes fois*.\" Il ne croyait pas \u00e0 ces dieux contemplatifs \u00e0 larges oreilles, \u00e0 bouche b\u00e9ante, \u00e0 ventre rebondi, et se moquait ouvertement des marques de respect dont ils \u00e9taient l'objet :\n\n\u53ef\u7b11\u4e16\u9593\u4eba\n\u7d1b\u7d1b\u4ed9\u4f5b\u4f9b\n\u4fee\u7149\u65e2\u8eab\u52de\n\u79ae\u62dc\u4ea6\u982d\u75db\n\nIl est risible que tous les hommes, en ce monde,\nAillent en foule adorer les g\u00e9nies et le Bouddha :\nPratiquer l'asc\u00e9tisme fatigue le corps ;\nSe prosterner selon les rites fait mal \u00e0 la t\u00eate :\nEn somme, toutes ces choses l\u00e0 sont des tromperies ;\nOu ne peut pas saisir \u00e0 l'ombre du vent\u2020.\nSi vraiment les dieux venaient quand on les appelle,\nAvec un \u00e9clat de rire je suivrais la foule.\n\nLes ministres du culte bouddhique avaient naturellement part \u00e0 ce m\u00e9pris ; Yuan ne les m\u00e9nageait point, quoique cependant\n\n* \u4f59\u4e0d\u559c\u4f5b\u6cd5 Souei-yuan-che-houa, livre III.\n\u2020 i.e., les dieux ne sont ni tangibles ni visibles, donc ils n'existent pas plus que le vent n'a d'ombre ; figure hardie des plus irr\u00e9v\u00e9rencieuses \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du Bouddhisme.\nil aimait mieux les saluer que se prosterner devant F\u00f4 ; il se plaisait \u00e0 citer ces vers d'un de ses coll\u00e8gues en po\u00e9sie :\n\nLorsque je rencontre un bonze, je ne manque pas de le saluer ;\n(Mais) quand je vois une statue du bouddha je ne me prosterner pas :\nSi on se prost\u00e9rne devant F\u00f4, celui-ci n'en sait rien ;\nSi on salue un bonze, celui-ci est l\u00e0 (pour vous r\u00e9pondre)*.\n\nLorsque Ynan alla au T'ien-t'a\u00ef-chan, les bonzes de tous les temples sonn\u00e8rent les cloches et frapp\u00e8rent du tambour, et invit\u00e9rent le po\u00e8te \u00e0 \"se prosterner devant F\u00f4, \u00e0 rendre ses devoirs au Bouddha.\"(\u79ae\u4f5b), \"mais, dit Yuan, je ne m'en souciais nullement.\"\n\nNotre po\u00e8te est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sobre de d\u00e9tails g\u00e9ographiques : ignorant, comme tout bon chinois, des pays \u00e9trangers et des choses du dehors, il ne pouvait parler que de l'empire chinois ; le champ, il est vrai, est vaste, et les lieux c\u00e9l\u00e8bres dont les noms eussent pu charger ses vers sont en grand nombre. Yuan a su faire un usage judicieux de ces ornements po\u00e9tiques et n'a pas m\u00e9rit\u00e9 les reproches spirituels que Boileau adressa nagu\u00e8re \u00e0 certains versificateurs de son temps :\n\nIrai-je dans une ode, en style de Malherbe,\nTroubler dans ses roseaux le Danube superbe . . . \u2020\n\nNon certes : chez lui, la g\u00e9ographie n'est pas un vain placage, et, comme dans Horace, elle a sa raison dans la nature des id\u00e9es qui l'am\u00e8nent, des sentiments qui s'y m\u00ealent : souvent c'est l'expression d'un souvenir personnel et vif des lieux, de l'attachement qu'il a conserv\u00e9 pour sa province et sa ville natale. Ainsi il a dit :\n\nIl y a un an j'ai pass\u00e9 par la route de Yu-yang\u2020 ;\nAujourd'hui (j'entends) le corbeau croasser d\u00e8s le matin \u00e0 P\u00f4-meun\u00a7,\n\n* Souei-yuan-che-houa, libre XIV.\n\u2020 Boileau, Satire IX.\n\u2021 Nom de chef-lieu d'arrondissement de Ki-tch\u00e9ou, province de Tche-li, sous les Ts'in et les Han, et rest\u00e9 le nom litt\u00e9raire et po\u00e9tique de cette ville.\n\u00a7 Un des noms litt\u00e9raires de Nanking ; Yu-yang, ville du nord, fait opposition avec p\u00f4-meun, ville du sud.\nLes hommes sont comme les hirondelles, il sont toujours errants \u00e7a et l\u00e0*.\n\nEt ailleurs :\n\n\u98db\u9ce5\u76f8\u77e5\u6200\u6545\u90fd\n\u6211\u4f86\u5fc3\u6b32\u5225\u897f\u95dc\n\nL'oiseau qui s'envole semble avoir de l'affection pour son ancien nid :\nAussi viens-je dans le dessein de voir le Si-hou avant mon d\u00e9part\u2020.\n\nL'astronomie a peu de place dans les vers de Yuan Tseu-tsa\u00ef : sans doute les noms de la lune, des constellations du Berger et de la Fileuse\u2021 et de quelques \u00e9toiles connues, apparaissent ci et l\u00e0, mais il semble que cette science n'\u00e9tait pas famili\u00e8re au po\u00e8te. Elle rev\u00eat chez lui un caract\u00e8re un peu astrologique : les saisons, les f\u00eates de l'ann\u00e9e, les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, voil\u00e0 les rares \u00e9l\u00e9ments auxquels Yuan a recours.\n\nLa derni\u00e8re classe d'ornements po\u00e9tiques, la plus attrayante et la plus habituelle c'est celle des traits descriptifs, parsem\u00e9s \u00e0 tout instant : Yuan ne cesse jamais de peindre et ses coups de pinceau sont toujours brillants, vifs et pr\u00e9cis ; j'oserai appliquer \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re descriptive du po\u00e8te, ce que mon savant et regrett\u00e9 ma\u00eetre, M.

W. KINGSMILL.\n\nMuch confusion has arisen from haphazard identifications of cities and tribes mentioned in ancient Chinese history, so following remarks on the geography of the districts on the Pamir and China at the beginning of the Christian era may be found useful. We still find Chinese students writing Hinn-g-nu as Huns, of the Yueh-ti as Get\u00e6 or Massagetae, Tahia as Dah\u00e6, &c. Those who desire to maintain these slavish fallacies will of course continue to do so. I would rather fain believe that there are rising students who desire to study the older history of China, and to search for themselves native authorities. To them I would point out how important it is that they should start with a knowledge of the various times have come in contact with Chinese civilization. To gain this knowledge it is not sufficient to study the writings alone, which at best give a loose account of the geography and ethnology of countries outside the Central State; it is necessary also to consult what is available from other sources, notably the Greek and Latin classics as well as the Sanskrit and Parsi writings, should they really wish to gain an insight into the tribal migrations, which have had so powerful an influence on the growth of modern society.\n\nPtolemy for long occupied a commanding position amongst geographers: almost up to the discovery of America he was the authority to which disputed points were referred; and although he has long lost this pre-eminence, no one desirous of studying ancient geography can afford to ignore the lights, that is true deceptive, which he brought to bear on the subject. It is interesting then to enquire what he knew of\nChina and its western neighbours. His 6th Book, in the 15th and 16th chapters, treats of Scythia without the Imaus and of S\u00e9rika. I shall give a literal translation of what he has to say.\n\nSCYTHIA beyond Imaus is bounded on the West by inner Scythia and the Sacae along the whole diversion of the mountains towards the north; on the North by the unknown land; on the East by S\u00e9rika along a straight line the extremities of which are situated respectively in E. Long. 150\u00b0 N. Lat. 63\u00b0 and Long. 160\u00b0 Lat. 35\u00b0; on the South by part of India beyond the Ganges along a parallel line joining the aforesaid extremities.\n\nIn this part lies the western portion of the Auxakian mountains, whose extremities are situated in Long. 149\u00b0 Lat. 49\u00b0 and Long. 165\u00b0 Lat. 54\u00b0. Also the western part of those called the Kasian mountains extending from Long. 152\u00b0 Lat. 41\u00b0 to Long. 162\u00b0 Lat. 44\u00b0. And the western part of the Em\u00f4dan mountains in Long. 163\u00b0 Lat. 36\u00b0 and Long. 165\u00b0 Lat. 36\u00b0. And in the Auxakian mountains the source of the Oikhardes River Long. 153\u00b0 Lat. 51\u00b0.\n\nThe northern part of this Scythia is occupied by the Abii Scyths, and under these the Horse-eating Scyths, adjoining whom stretches the country of Auxakltis; and under it beside the said starting point the country of Kasia, below which are the Khatae Scyths and the country of Akhasa; and under this last beside the Em\u00f4dan mountains the Kharauanaean Scyths.\n\nIn this portion are the below mentioned cities:\n\nAuxakia ... ... ... ... Long. 144\u00b0 Lat. 49\u00b0 40'\nScythic Iss\u00e9don ... ... ... 150\u00b0 48\u00b0 30'\nKhaurana ... ... ... 150\u00b0 37\u00b0 15'\nSoita ... ... ... 145\u00b0 36\u00b0 20'\n\nS\u00c9RIKA is bounded on the West by outer Scythia along the before set-out line; on the North by unknown land along the parallel of Th\u00fble; likewise on the East by unknown land along the meridian line of which the ends are situated respectively in Long. 180\u00b0 Lat. 63\u00b0 and Long. 180\u00b0 Lat. 35\u00b0; on the South by the remaining portion of India beyond Ganges along the same parallel to the extremity whose position is Long. 173\u00b0 Lat. 35\u00b0; and farther to Sinae along an extended line to its extremity at the unknown land.\n\nMountains surround S\u00e9rika, amongst them those called the Anniba whose extremities lie respectively in Long. 153\u00b0 Lat. 60\u00b0 and Long. 171\u00b0 Lat. 56\u00b0. The eastern portion of the Auxakian range of which extremity is situated Long. 165\u00b0 Lat. 54\u00b0. Those called the Asmir\u00e6an from Long. 167\u00b0 Lat. 47\u00b0 30' to Long. 174\u00b0 Lat. 47\u00b0 30'. And the eastern portion of the Kasian lying between Long. 162\u00b0 Lat. 44\u00b0 and Long. 171\u00b0 Lat. 40\u00b0. Also the Mt. Thaguron whose middle is in Long. 170\u00b0 Lat 43\u00b0. The eastern portion of those called the Em\u00f4dan and S\u00e9ric extending to Long. 165\u00b0 Lat. 36\u00b0. And the range called the Ottorokoras whose extremities lie Long. 169\u00b0 Lat. 36\u00b0 and Long. 176\u00b0 Lat. 39\u00b0.\n\nTwo rivers flow through the greater part of S\u00e9rika; the Oekhardes whose rise in the Auxakian mountains has been noticed, it also has a source in the Asmir\u00e6an range in Long. 174\u00b0 Lat. 47\u00b0 30', and bends towards the Kasian in Long. 160\u00b0 Lat. 49\u00b0 30', in which also is a source\nLong, 161\u00b0 Lat. 44\u00b0 15\u2032; and that known as the Bautisos rising in the Kasian range in Long. 160\u00b0 Lat. 43\u00b0, and in the Ottorokorras in Long. 176\u00b0 Lat. 39\u00b0, and bending towards the Em\u00f4dan in Long. 168\u00b0 Lat. 39\u00b0, in which mountains is a source Long. 160\u00b0 Lat. 37\u00b0.\n\nRaces of cannibals pasture the most northern parts of S\u00e9rica, south of which the Annibi inhabit the mountains called by their name. Between these and the Auxakian are the Sizyges, south of whom are the D\u00e2mnae, also along the Oekhardes river the Pialae or Piaddae and below these, called after the river, the Oekhardae.\n\nMore easterly still than the Annibi are the Garinse\u00ef, and the Rabannae or Rabbana\u00ebi; south of whom along the like-named mountains is the country of Asmiraea; and below this amongst the Kasians are the Iss\u00e9dones, a powerful tribe; more east than they are the Throani, and below these the Ithag\u00fbri. On the east of the like-named mountains below the Iss\u00e9dones are the Aspak\u00e2rea, and still to the south of these the B\u00e2tae, and to the extreme south along the Em\u00f4dan and S\u00e9ric mountains the Ottorokorrae.\n\nThe towns of S\u00e9rika are named as below:\n\n| Town                  | Long. | Lat.   |\n|-----------------------|-------|--------|\n| Damna                 | 156\u00b0  | 51\u00b0 20\u2032|\n| Piala or Piadda       | 160\u00b0  | 49\u00b0 40\u2032|\n| Asmiraea              | 170\u00b0  | 48\u00b0    |\n| Throana               | 164\u00b0 40\u2032 | 47\u00b0 40\u2032|\n| S\u00e9ric Iss\u00e9don         | 162\u00b0  | 45\u00b0    |\n| Aspakara or Aspakaea  | 162\u00b0 30\u2032 | 41\u00b0 40\u2032|\n| Dr\u00f4sakh\u00ea or Rosakla   | 167\u00b0 40\u2032 | 42\u00b0 30\u2032|\n| Paliana               | 162\u00b0 30\u2032 | 41\u00b0    |\n| Abragana              | 163\u00b0 30\u2032 | 39\u00b0 30\u2032|\n| Thogara               | 171\u00b0 20\u2032 | 39\u00b0 40\u2032|\n| Dazata                | 174\u00b0  | 39\u00b0 30\u2032|\n| Orosana               | 162\u00b0  | 37\u00b0 30\u2032|\n| Ottorokorra           | 165\u00b0  | 37\u00b0 15\u2032|\n| Solana                | 169\u00b0  | 37\u00b0 30\u2032|\n| S\u00e9ra Metropolis       | 177\u00b0  | 38\u00b0 35\u2032|\n\nTwo things are more especially worthy of note in the above; the first is the eastern displacement of S\u00e9rica with regard to India, Ptolemy actually placing Khoten (xa\u016bpasa) four degrees east of the mouths of Ganges; and secondly, that of China itself he knew nothing except the name, or rather names, by which it was popularly known, and more curiously still that he applied these names, not to China itself but to the neighbouring lands. The second statement is almost a corollary of the first, as he had to fill up somehow the void space which on his principles of geography lay north of Indo-China. Knowing nothing of China beyond the vague S\u00e9ra Metropolis (i.e., Changan in Shensi) he made his S\u00e9rica extend into the unknown land, which had indeed once been Str\u00eek, i.e., \u79e6\u570b Sir-kwook (Ts'in-kuoh), and which was in his time Thinac, i.e., \u6f22\u570b Dh\u00e1n-kwook the country of the Dh\u00e2ns or\nHans, for in modern Chinese the original aspirated initial has dwindled to a simple h.\n\nChina itself in his pages is still the \"\u0391\u03b3\u03c5\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b3\u1fc6, the \"Unknown land,\" which bounded S\u00e9rica and Thinae, both names of itself on the west and north respectively. Nor is this much to be wondered at: the Chinese author of the How H\u00e4n Sh\u016b was equally ignorant of Rome; Tats'in, the great S\u00ear (i.e., Syria) of the west bounded his geographical view, as to the Mid-Asiatic of to-day India obscures the vision of the ruling but distant power of England.\n\nOf S\u00e9rica Ptolemy seems to have had information from two separate authorities at least, both apparently Indian, and the attempt to combine these sources has led him to dislocate strangely the geography of Eastern Turkestan,\u2014Scythia beyond Imans as one of his authorities not inaptly denominated it. With the other S\u00e9rica (i.e., Ts'in-kwoh) a name by which China was known for a brief period, came to be applied to the same district, and hence we find Auxakitis and the Kasian country divided into two by an imaginary line, and the Abian Scyths made a different people from the Annibi, while the chief town of the Iss\u00e9dones is divided into two with an interval of no less than twelve degrees of longitude. To the critical student these errors afford proof of the general trustworthiness of Ptolemy's work, and show, though unwittingly, that he was conscientious in the reproduction of his authorities.\n\nScythia beyond Imans, he tells us, is bounded on the west by inner Sythia and the Sakae, north by the unknown land, east (correctly) by S\u00e9rica, i.e., the country of Ts'in, and south by part of India beyond the Ganges. It contains the western portion of the Auxakian mountains (the modern Altai range), as well as the Kasian and Em\u00f4dan, the former containing the sources of the Oekhardes. Dwelling in it are the Abii Scyths, the horse-eating Scyths, the countries of Auxikitis and Kasia; the Khatae Scyths and the Akhasan country, and beyond all these beside the Em\u00f4dan mountains the Kharanna\u00e7an Scyths. Its towns are Auxakia, Scythic Iss\u00e9don, Khanrana and Soita. Strange as these names seem at first sight, we have the means of identification from other sources. In Imans and Em\u00f4dus we have the Indian Him\u00e2yalas and Himavat, the Snowy mountains par excellence. In Kasius we must find the Tien-shan or Tengri-tagh of to-day, though we seem to meet with no direct analogue of\nthe name from other authorities. Both the Chinese and Turkish names seem to have originated from an old Aryan form Indragiri, Indra's mountains; Kasius we may refer to the root k\u00e2s, to glow, and both have probably their origin from the glowing aspect of the range seen from the plains of Turkestan. The latitude given for the Kasian range 41\u00b0 to 44\u00b0 north is sufficiently near their actual position. North of these lay the Auxakian range, but here Ptolemy's geography becomes sadly confused with the increasing distance from his sources of information; the situation corresponds roughly with the ranges north of the modern Sergiopol.\n\nNorth of these lay the Abii, whom we may connect with the Annibi of the subsequent chapter, associated with horse-eating Scyths, probably Mongol or Turkish. In connection with these mountains, probably to the south in the valleys of the Ili, the Chn and the Narin was the country of Auxakit\u00eds, in which, if Ptolemy's longitudes are to be trusted, lay Scythic Iss\u00eadon, pointing to a connexion, or confusion between Auxakians and Iss\u00eadones. Now the Arang or Arg r\u00fbt of the Bandehesh was the Jaxartes, the Araxes of Herodotus \"over against the Issedonians*,\" and this district was called in the Pahlavi Vendidad Arangist\u00e2n\u2020; of this form Araxikitis (from verb *k\u0113p\u0101i) shortened to Auxakit\u00eds was a simple translation. Ammianus Marcellinus\u2021 gives us yet another form in Nazavicium apparently a corruption for Araxavicium as if Rangwik; but see below.\n\nSouth again of the Kasian range is Akhasa with its inhabitants the Khatae Scyths. There is little difficulty in the identification. of the first with Kashgar the Kangku, \u5eb7\u5c45, of the Shi-ki It seems to have a respectable antiquity; \u5eb7 delightful is phonetically connected with Sans. jush, amare, desiderare, Zend zush; and both with Sans. ras, Zend ra\u00f1h, whence the name \"Ra\u00f1ha upon the waters\u00a7\" the sixteenth best of created countries. Kashgar (j\u00e2gr\u00e2mi, vigilo) is then the \"delectable watch tower;\" and the Chinese form seems to imply that this name is antecedent to the Christian era.\n\nBelow Akhasa again were the Kharann\u00e9an Scyths, whom we must identify with the great Turkish tribe called by the Chinese\n\n* Her. I., 201, 202.\n\u2020 Haug's Essays on the Parsis, 2nd Ed., 364.\n\u2021 Am. Mar. XXIII, vi. 64.\n\u00a7 Vendidad, I. 20.\nHiungn\u00fb, but whose name I have elsewhere shown* was Kara N\u00fbr or Kara Niru. This tribe according to Ptolemy lay along the Em\u00f4dan mountains, a position which might have been assigned to them about 176 B.C. when they dominated the districts lying east of Khoten, but was scarcely correct in his own time, after their successive defeats at the hands of the H\u00e2n emperors.\n\nThe cities referred to outer Scythia are Anxakia explained above; Scythic Iss\u00eadon; Khaurana evidently an error of the transcriber for Khautana, i.e., Khotan and placed almost correctly in N. Lat. 37\u00b0 15\u2032; and Soita which must represent the modern Swat north of the Peshawur valley. Ptolemy it will be noticed places Khaurana in Long. 150\u00b0 E. fifty-one degrees out of its true position, or according to his own reckoning with regard to India about thirty degrees too far east.\n\nThis discrepancy is to be explained by his duplication of outer Scythia as well as in part by his insertion of the Sakae as a different nation, and this last enables us to replace Yarkand, omitted from its list in its proper place. Amongst the list of tribes inhabiting Sakae he mentions the Toornae apparently for To-yornae. Now Sze-ma Tsien call the district of Yarkand (Shi-ki, chap. cxxiii) Taynan \u5927\u5b9b i.e., Ta-yar, and calls its chief town Urh-shi \u8c9d\u5e2b apparently Urdu or Urdhva, a regularly walled town with a citadel inside, and though Ptolemy tells us that the inhabitants of Sakae were nomads living in woods and caves, we know from other sources that such could not have been the case. We therefore can have little difficulty in identifying the two, and likewise can understand better the growth of the name\u2020.\n\nLeaving outer Scythia we shall notice in Ptolemy\u2019s description of S\u00e9rica how much is repeated. S\u00e9rica he informs us is bounded north and east by unknown lands, and on the south by further India and Sinae, and is surrounded by mountains. North are the Auxakian, as before, the Anniba and the Asmirae\u00e6n, of the latter of which I shall speak below; between these and the next the eastern portion of the Kasian and Mount Thag\u00fbron, and in the south the eastern part of the Em\u00f4dan and S\u00e9ric mountains, corresponding to the northern range of the\n\n---\n\n* China Review, VII. 387.\n\u2020 Possibly the original of the present name was Tuiryakanda \u201cTur\u2019s Castle,\u201d equivalent to Samarkand for Salmar-kanda or \u201cSelma\u2019s Castle.\u201d\nHim\u00e1layas, the Kwenl\u00fbn of geographers; beyond which taking a direction towards the E.N.E. is the Ottorokorras range extending to the frontiers of the district as known.\n\nNow in the last we seem to have a clue to the rendering of Ptolemy's nomenclature. We shall not greatly err in accepting Ottorokorras, as his rendering of Sanscrit Uttarakurn; in contradistinction to the Thag\u00fbron, which the name of the adjoining tribe the Ithag\u00fbri shows to have lost its initial vowel, so that we may safely restore it as Adharakuru. We have then in these two names the appellations of Upper and Lower Kuru respectively, associated and apparently derived from the two tribes mentioned as inhabiting their skirts. The word Kuru is by the ordinary phonetic change represented in Chinese by the Kiang \u84bc (old Chinese Kur), who in Sze-ma T'sien's time inhabited the N\u00e2ns'h\u00e2n, the mountainous district between Tun-hwang and Thibet. The Ithag\u00fbron mountain is then to be found in the Altyn Tagh of Prejevalsky and its eastern continuation, while the Ottorokorras corresponds to the great snowy line of peaks forming the western continuation of the Burkhan Buddha, and called by him the Shamen-tagh. These Kiangs or Kurus seem to have been the direct ancestors of the present Tanguts, associated however with a portion of the Yuehti, who, Sze-ma Ts'ien informs us took refuge in these districts after their great defeat in B.C. 176 at the hands of the Hiung'n\u00fb. Ptolemy seems to have entirely misplaced the Asmir\u00e6an mountains, and to have confused inextricably the two rivers, the Oekhardes and the Bantisos.\n\nHe goes on to tell us that the greater part of S\u00earica is watered by two rivers\u2014the Oekhardes and the Bantisos, and it so happens that all tradition Indian, Iranian and Chinese places two, or four, rivers in this position. The Vishnu Purana describes the Ganges as descending from heaven on Meru, and dividing into four mighty streams flowing north, south, west and east; the two latter being the Chak-shu or rather Vakhshn*, the Oxus, and the Cita, or Sita; the Alakananda, the upper Ganges flowing south; and the Bhadra washing the country of the Uttarakurus and flowing thence to the northern ocean. The Bundahesh (chap. xx) tells of only two rivers. The Arang which rises in the country of S\u00fbr\u00e2k and flows west through \"Sp\u00eat\u00f4s (Egyptus)\n\n* Rawlinson's Monograph on the Oxus (J. of R.G.S. XLII., 494.\nwhich they also call Mesr, and they call it then the Niv (or Nil), and the Veh (Oxus) which passes by on the east, and goes through the land of Sind and flows to the sea in Hindustan!\"\n\nSo even the matter of fact Sz-ma Ts'ien tells how the Emperor Wu of the early Hans sent an expedition to Khotan to explore the sources of the Hwangho which ancient charts and books told him rose in the Kwenlun-shan, i.e., mountains of Gandhara. West of Khotan the rivers flowed to the western sea, east of it to the salt water (Lob or Lavapa) which had an underground communication with the Hwangho. This mythical geography lived long; the Buddhist canon received it, and Yuenchwang tried hard to reconcile it with the facts of the case*. It is no wonder then that Ptolemy's informants told him of the fabled rivers, and that he sought to find a place for them in S\u00e9rica.\n\nThe Oekhardes is evidently an attempt at transliterating V\u00eakh or V\u00eakh-r\u00fbt (the Vakh or Oxus); the Bantisos apparently a transcriber's error for Badrisos, the Bhadra, which skirted Uttarakurn. The Sita the black, or rather yellow, river which flowed through Bhadra\u00e7va being omitted. As the mythical rivers flowing out of heaven took no account of mountains, valleys or even of seas, so it is not to be wondered at that Ptolemy's Oekhardes took similar liberties. One of its sources is accordingly in the Altais\u2014the Irtish; another springs from the Kasian range\u2014the Ili; while yet another rises in the Asmiraean mountains, whose true position is described below.\n\nThe Bantisos is however more plainly defined; its sources are, first in the Kasian mountains, the Akssai; second, in the Ottorokorras, the Cherchen daria; and third, in the Em\u00f4dan, the Khotan river, in fact agreeing fairly with the course of the Yarkand-daria or Tarim, called also in Chinese maps the Ergon.\n\nThis confusion regarding the rivers of S\u00e9rica may, however, afford us some means of understanding the position of one at least of the tribes misplaced by Ptolemy, and which has apparently, like the river, been duplicated; I refer to the Pialae, or by a better reading the Piaddae which I take to be for Piaddhal, i.e., Viddhal or Yuehti tribe. This tribe he places adjacent to the Oekhardes, and is therefore compelled to locate their chief town Piala or Piadda in latitude 49\u00b0 40'. He, however, duplicates the name in the town of Paliana which he places 12\u00bd degrees east\n\n* Eitel, Jour. N.C.B.R.A.S. VI., 50.\nof Khoten in latitude 41\u00b0, a site which would be found in the plain adjoining the mouth of Prejevalsky's Lake Lob. This would not be true in Ptolemy's time but did represent the position of the tribe at the rise of the Han dynasty. It had long been resident in the district between Lake Lob and Suhchow in the extreme west of Kansuh. Here on the great migration of the Chows they found the tribe settled about 1100 B.C. Here too it remained till dispossessed by the Hiungnu, B.C. 177 (Shi-ki, cxxiii) when the tribe broke up, the greater part migrating to Baktria, where for a time they associated with the Tokhars \u5927\u590f, afterwards appearing as the Ephthalite of the later Greek historians. A part called by the Chinese the lesser Yuehti crossed the mountains to the south of Lob Nor, and established themselves in the Nanshan between it and Tibet, where in the course of time they seem to have been absorbed amongst the aboriginal inhabitants. They are said to have been a handsome light complextioned people.\n\nSouth-east of Paliana, Ptolemy places the town of Abragana which we may restore as Avanjana or Varchana, apparently from the root varch, to shine\u2014Chinese \u707f Hwang, splendid. We therefore are fully justified in identifying it with the Chinese \u707f Tuhhwang, the Far-shining, in Sanscrit Tanuvarchana, the Chinese adopting (as frequently happened) the native name of the place, especially where, as in this instance the roots in the two languages were identical. This situation of Tuhhwang in the loess strait between the plains of Kansuh and Lobnor has at all times made it the key of the road westward, and it still survives close to its ancient site, and under its ancient name.\n\nSome forty miles north of Paliana our author places the town of Aspakara or Aspakaea. The latitude given 41\u00b0 40' does not correspond with any modern town, the nearest being Hami Lat. 42\u00b0 50', while the most probable identification is with Barkul in Lat. 43\u00b0 40'. The original name was probably Asvacharya, i.e., Horse-run.\n\nEight degrees east of Abragana was placed the town of Thogara; the name seems again a corruption of an Aryan form, in Sanscrit Dhojalya, i.e., Drinking fountain, and as such the equivalent of the Chinese name \u9152\u6cc9 Tsui't'swan Wine-fountain given to town and district temp. Wu-ti 140-86 B.C. now Suh-chow, in old Chinese Suk-chow; the word Suk apparently being a travesty of the initial syllable Dhoj. It is difficult to judge\nwhether the Chinese name here is rendered from the Aryan or whether both may not be transcripts of an older original. Ptolemy is here very far out of his longitude, Suh-chow being really only four degrees east of Tunhwang.\n\nTwo and a-half degrees further east was situated, we are told, the town of Daxata, which we must refer to Kanchow-fu formerly \u5f35\u591c Chang-y\u00ea,\u2014Danukshetra, the Plain of the bowmen, where \u591c is for \u62d4 or \u7bad. The distance is here again exaggerated, being only slightly in excess of two degrees of longitude.\n\nThree degrees east of Daxata and in N. Lat. 38\u00b0 45' Ptolemy places the capital,\u2014S\u00eara metropolis. Assuming the position given for Khotan as our starting point this would place it in 107 E. Long., or almost identical with that assigned to Ninghis, namely, E. Long. 106\u00b0 08', Lat. 38\u00b0 33'. Singan-fu, first the capital of Ts'in \u79e6 or Sir, was in Ptolemy's time the chief city of all China, but the name S\u00eara metropolis as apposed to Thinae metropolis was distinctly a survival of the former period. Ninghia was the Capital of the northern Kiangs, though in the previous century it had been within Hiungn\u00fb limits; it was however far removed from trade routes, and never seems to have acquired any importance as a trade centre. Notwithstanding the error in the latitude we must continue to identify the S\u00eara metropolis of Ptolemy with Singan-fu. It was the furthest point of which he could gain any information, and he and the west generally long remained ignorant of the great empire of which, although the capital, it was almost the frontier city.\n\nAs Ninghia was the chief seat of the Northern Kiangs, Sinling appears to have been of the southern, and represented the Ottorokorra of the geographer, who however places it some six degrees west of its proper position in what would be the plain of Tsaidam. Four degrees east of Ottorokorra is placed the town of Solana; with the identification of Sinling as above, Solana may be accepted as the L\u00e2n-chow of to-day. The district was formed 121 B.C. out of the territories of the Hwanyas and was given the name of Kim-ch'eng \u91d1\u6210 Gold-city. As the names given to towns by the Chinese were generally in the first instance translations or modifications of the native appellations, we might possibly, but that I am loth to locate an Aryan speaking tribe so far to the eastward, compare Ptolemy's Solana with\nSans. hiranya gold. The name L\u00e4n-chow given to the town during the Sui dynasty is probably a survival of the old name.\n\nThe districts between L\u00e4n-chow and Suh-chow were B.C. 150-120 inhabited by the Hwanyas \u6f22\u90aa, a tribe of whom we learn little except that owing to their position they became the buffer between the Hiungnus and the Chinese. Finally reduced in numbers and broken in spirit they, in 122 B.C. submitted to the latter, who formed the design of handing over the depopulated country to the Wusuns. These refused the offer and the country was partly settled by immigrants from Kwantung. The Hwanya* may be identified with Ptolemy's Garinaei whom he associates with the Rabannae or Rabbanaei who lay along the skirts of the Asmiraean mountains; of the Rabannae I shall speak below.\n\nThe Asmiraean mountains Ptolemy locates in Lat. 47\u00b0 30', which is probably an error arising from the displacement of the Oekhardes river, and which quite dislocates his geography. On the other hand he has left a complete blank between Khotan and Tunhwang and here in about Lat. 37\u00b0 30' I am disposed to place his Asmiraean mountains. They would then tally with the range which forms the continuation westwards of the Altyn-tagh and skirts the country of Aymardana, of which more below. This would then place the Garinaei and Rabannae in their proper place extending along the Nanshan and its continuations into Kansuh.\n\nWe have then left in their true position along the Kasian mountains the people called by Ptolemy the Iss\u00e9dones and described as an important tribe. As stated at the head of these notes he has duplicated this people and given them two capitals Scythic and S\u00e9ric Iss\u00e9don. The name of Iss\u00e9don may be looked upon as a geographical survival, having been first used by Herodotus, and after dropping out of use been revived by Ptolemy. Strabo speaks of the tribes along the upper Jaxartes as the Asii and the Pasiani probably for Vasiani. Arrian, again calls them Abii, which Ptolemy in turn adopts for the Altaic tribes, probably Mongol or Turkish. In the name adopted by the Chinese \u70cf\u5b6b Wusun or Vasun we probably are not far from the original sound.\n\n* \u6f22 or \u904b Hwan or Yun, to revolve, move to and fro Sans.-gh\u0101r\u016b-Ami. \u2014id.\nOn the flank of the Asmiraean mountains he locates the town and country of Asmiraea; I have shown above what must have been the true position of the range. Asmiraea then would answer to the Che-mo-t'o-na (i.e., A\u00e7madhana or A\u00e7mardana) of Yuen-chwang. Che-mo-t'o-na, Yuen-chwang states, was originally called \u6f22\u672b, which Julien transcribes as Nimo, an appellation affording no clue to the name; I however take \u9060 to be a transcriber's error for \u6f22 nau or rather ch'ek, so that the transliteration should be Ch'ek-m\u00f4t for A\u00e7madha or A\u00e7marda. The Shui-king likewise calls it \u4e14\u672b C'he-m\u00f4t, and Remusat translating from the Chinese in his \"Histoire de la ville de Khotan\" transliterates the name as Thsie\u00ef-mo. Now A\u00e7ma or A\u00e7mansa is old Aryan for stone, from the former of which seems to come Turkish Yeshim, and possibly Persian Yashf, the jade stone. I say possibly as the Persian may have come from the Hebrew Yashpheh through Arabic, as the Greek inspis certainly did through Phenician channels. The original Aryan root has however a wide extension, for with the Sanscrit A\u00e7mansa we have to connect the Chinese \u7389\u77f3 yun-k, the jade stone, the Slavonic Kamy and the Lithnanian Akmu. Now Che-mo-t'o-na we learn from the above sources lay, somewhat to the S.E. of Khotan or rather Kiria, on the road to Lowlan the Cherchen of to-day. Either it took its name from the jade produced, A\u00e7madhana the jade-bearing or possibly the current name of jade was derived from the locality. The Khoten river is still the Karakash, \"Black jade\" while the river flowing east of Kiria was known to the Chinese as the \"White jade.\"\n\nWith this correction we obtain likewise an intelligible position for Throana. Ptolemy places it E.S.E. of Asmiraea, but if the position assumed for A\u00e7madhana and its identification be correct this is impracticable. About 140 miles N.E. of the latter lies the assumed site of Cherchen, known in the Shi-ki as Lowlan but by subsequent writers as Shanshan \u83bd\u83bd; both names, as well as modern Cherchen indicating an original Dardan or possibly Dharshana, the latter form probably the original of Ptolemy's Throana as indicated below. There is more than passing interest attaching to the locality, the first allusion to it belonging to prehistoric times. Under divine instruction Wan-wang is represented in the Hwang-i (Shi-king iii. 1, vii. as attacking and utterly destroying T'sungyynng the warlike in\nthe great migration of the Chows. The Wan-wang-yu-sheng (iii. 1. x.) sings;\n\nWan-wang received the ordinance\nIn reward of his warlike prowess;\nHaving utterly destroyed Ts'ung\nHe fixed his capital at Fung.\n\nThe Ts'unggyung of the ballad is phonetically identical with the other names, Lowlan and Shanshan. Lowlan was always a place of importance in the early days of Eastern Turkestan: in the reign of Wu-ti of the Han dynasty it was captured by the Chinese and its king taken prisoner, and from this time it seems to have gradually decayed owing to the encroachment of the desert. Yuenchwang in the seventh century seems to have found it much reduced; its name Shanshan seems to have been disused and the site of the town to have been removed, as he speaks of Na-fo-pu, i.e., Navapur, Newtown, as the representative of Lowlan. In Marco Polo's time it still existed, but since his time it has been practically forgotten, having dwindled down to the petty village of Cherchen, not thought worthy of record in the Chinese maps of Turkestan. If the form Dharshana be the original, Ptolemy has duplicated it in the town of Orosana (\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1 as if for \u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1) the position given for which, three degrees west of Sining (Ottorokorra) would place it in the salt plain of Tsaidam, an impossible locality.\n\nOne other tribe the Batae, Ptolemy seems to have somewhat displaced, locating them still to the south of the Aspakarae, an indefinite description at best. He evidently refers to the Bo'ts the old inhabitants of Bod or Tibet. Ammianus Marcellinus more correctly places his Betae to the south on the highest slopes of the mountains.\n\nFrom the above and the information we gain from Sze-ma Ts'ien we may begin to have a fair idea of the ethnology of Mid-Asia between the Pamir and western China about the opening of the Christian era. Between the Kwenlun and the Tien mountains the original population had been Aryan, and their remains even then extended as far east as Kan-chow, then Changy\u00ea, i.e., Dhannkshetra. We find Aryans in Khotan \u62dc\u5d11, in Khoria \u6241\u5f4c (Kiria), in Sorghul \u8607\u845b (T\u00e2-b\u00f4-l\u00f4 \u90fd\u8ca8\u7f85 of Yuenchwang), in Asmiraca or Acmardhana \u4e14\u672b (\u6298\u6469\u9ed8\u90a3 of Yuenchwang), Lowlan \u6a02\u862d (Darshana) between the Kwenlun and Lobnor. Wan or Taynan \u5927\u5b9b (Yarkand),\nof the Hwanyas, the Garinsei of our author, whose disappearance from history I have noted above. Associated with them were the people called by him the Rabannae or Rabbanasi. I can find no direct allusion to them in Chinese writers, but they seem to have left their mark in the local nomenclature of Kansuh. The original denomination from which Ptolemy devised his Rabannae was probably Dravanyae which we see in names like those of the river T'ao \u6d2e, i.e., Drav, a large affluent of the Hwangho in Kansuh flowing through the tribal territory, in the district of Lint'ao \u9748\u6d2e now Titan-chow, but a ki\u00fcn in the days of Ts'in. It also seems to survive in the old territory of \u8cfd lung, the old name of eastern Kansuh, and in \u7da0 Liang-chow of the Y\u00fc-kung, which survives in the city of Liang-chow \u6f22\u5dde.\n\nAbout the first quarter of the second century B.C. the Turkish empire of the Hinngn\u00fb or Kara-n\u00fbrs had attained under the Shenyu Maotun its greatest development. It included the greater part of northern Shansi, Shensi and Kansuh to about 37\u00b0 N. Lat. Maotun and his successor Laoshang were threatening the south of Kansuh, and more than once surrounded P'ing-liang-fu. Meeting with serious reverses, they commenced to move westwards, and about 177 B.C. poured down into western Kansuh and what is now eastern Turkestan. They overran the country of the Hwanyas, defeated and drove out the Yuehti, and attacked Lowlan and the Wusun. For a time their southern frontier was the N\u00e2ush\u00e2n and its western prolongation into the districts about Lobnor, i.e., Lav\u00e2pa, Salt water (the In-shui \u76d0\u6c34 of the Chinese). Although after a time the Chinese extended their influence over these districts the Turkish elements seem ever afterwards to have remained paramount; the Yuehti never returned to their old houses, and the constant warfare between Hans and Turks depopulated the territories of the Hwanyas. Further west the advance of the desert encroached on Lowlan and the district about Lake Lob, though even now amidst its marshes survives, according to Prejevalsky, a feeble remnant of the old Aryans in the debased tribe of the Lobnortsi, sunk beneath the level even of their Mongolian neighbours.\n\nWest of the Hinngn\u00fb on the flanks of the Kasian mountains lay a nation of fair haired and blue eyed people, the \u70cf\u5b6b Wusuns, Asii or Vasiani, i.e., the Vasons from the root vas to dwell,\nsignifying simply the \"dwellers.\" They were pastoral in their habits, and raised horses of the celebrated breed the \"western paragons\" \u897f\u6975. Their king was known as the \u8c9d\u83ab or \u8c9d\u83ab Kw'en-moh or Kw'en-erh, Kuning compared with Sans janaka, Goth.kuning; nor are other traces of Teutonic affinities wanting; one of their leaders who fell in the battle with Alexander is called by Arrian Satrakes, i.e. Sitrik; their king when the Chinese sought to open negotiations with them was \u96e3\u515c\u6469 Nanthorm or Danthorm, his son was \u5927\u8d6b Thorluk, his grandson \u5948\u5a46 Sham-t'su, Damdir. The name of the district Rangwik reminds us of forms like Ringau, Ringkj\u00f6bing, &c., so too other names of the tribes immediately in contact with the upper Jaxartes as given by Ptolemy tell of Teutonic associations. The S\u00fbob\u00eani, the Sy\u00eabi, the Asmani, the Sasones, the Tektosaks (? Tentosaks,) all have a Teutonic appearance, closely resembling the Swevi, the Ostmen, the Saxons and the Tenton of the European immigration. The physical features of the tribes seem to have survived amongst the Kirghiz of to-day, amongst whom in spite of their Mongol-Turkish origin red hair and light eyes are described as of not infrequent occurrence*.\n\nIn Eastern Turkestan itself, especially in the Yarkand and Kashgar districts, the Aryan type of the settled inhabitants has been remarked by all recent travellers. Shaw on his visit was much struck by the marked difference between the towns' people and agriculturists, and the moving tribes of Mongol or Turkish descent, and General Mesny has told me that on his first introduction to a Yarkandese of rank he addressed him in French, so thoroughly was he convinced of his European origin. Notwithstanding the foreign influence to which it was subject for two thousand years the Aryan type in these districts has been very persistent. In Yuanchwang's time it prevailed everywhere to the south of Lowlan, and Khotan was steeped in Aryan tradition. Shaw describes them as having long faces, well formed noses, and full beards, and describes their affinities as being rather with the Iranian than Sanscritic branch; and this coincides with what I have remarked as to Kashgar being probably the representative of the \"Rangha upon the waters,\"\n\n---\n\n* So we may apparently accept the name Iss\u00e9dones (Essedones of Pliny) as the equivalent of Gothic Westsetones, \"West dwellers,\" to be compared with the Ist\u00e6vones, i.e., West-wohner, of Tacitus.\nthe sixteenth best created locality. Their weakness was not physical, but lay in their incapacity for concentration: the petty kings of Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, Lowlan and Kash could do little against the strongly centralized powers of China or the Hiangnu, and so by degrees eastern Arya (to devise a name for a territory never sufficiently autonomous to create one for itself) lost its independence, its language and its traditions, and became transformed into Chinese Turkestan. Had a Cyrus risen amongst the Eastern Aryans the face of modern history might have been changed; but no power strong enough to check the Turkish invasion arose, and the dispossessed tribes poured down on Europe and destroyed the older civilization, to erect in its stead the states of modern Europe.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nCHINA BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1884.\n\nNEW SERIES, Vol. XIX, Part II.\n\nAgents for the Sale of the Society's Publications:\n\nSHANGHAI, HONGKONG AND YORKHAMA.
