WYLIE.\n\nTravellers from the city of Peking to the town of Kalgan on the great wall of China, must make the journey by the rugged defile known as the Nankow Pass. Five miles north of the entrance, where the village of Nankow stands, is the smaller village of Keu-yung kwan. Fortifications there run up the steep slopes of the mountains on both sides of the valley; and besides arched gateways at the two ends of the village, the highway passes under a limestone archway of a much more striking appearance. This is covered with mythological and symbolic sculptures of obviously Indian origin. The tradition of the natives in the neighbourhood asserts it to have been the basement story of a pagoda which stood there; and the name by which it is still designated, \u904e\u8857\u5854 Ku\u00f2 keae t'\u00e2, \"Pagoda crossing the street,\" bears out the statement. We are told that this pagoda, though erected for the benefit of the locality, proved an object of such terror to the superstitious Mongols, coming south from their native wilds, that they could not be induced to pass under the ominous-looking structure; and thus it was found necessary in the early part of the Ming dynasty, to remove the upper stories of the erection; the policy of the government being to conciliate and attract these wild nomades.\n\nKeu-yung kwan was once a place of much greater pretension and importance than it is at present; and it can boast of historical memories of considerable interest; not the least being the fact that there Genghis khan was successfully resisted in his attempts to force the pass.\n\nSeveral Europeans who have passed that way, have noticed the village and the archway, in recounting their travels. Father Gerbillon, who was there on his way to Mongolia in 1688, says\u2014\"The village might pass for a little town. The\ngate by which it is entered is very like a triumphal arch. It is all marble, and about thirty feet thick, with figures in half relief up to the spring of the arch.\"\u00b9 The same father, returning that way in the suite of the emperor in 1697, remarks:\u2014\"The heir apparent, accompanied by five of his brothers, and some magnates of the empire who had remained at Peking, came to meet the emperor in the middle of the Pass, in a village, named Kiu y\u00fcm quan, where they remained some time.\"\u00b2 Bell of Antemmony, who accompanied the Russian embassy to Peking in 1720, speaks of it as the town of Zulin guang, where he says they passed the night of November 15th.\u00b3 Timkowski, who headed a similar embassy in 1820, speaks thus of the place:\u2014\"Here the road begins to be very difficult, especially for carriages, and does not change for a distance of about five verst, as far as the fort of Kiu young (kouan), the principal defence of this passage. The interior of the middle gate is ornamented with figures of heros sculptured on the walls.\"\u2074\n\nNone of the preceding writers however, nor others who had been there, seem to have thought it worth while to direct attention to the inscription which is found on this archway; and the first notice of it brought before the European public, so far as I am aware, was in a paper by myself, published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1860.\u2075 I had found it registered in a Chinese work on stone inscriptions, published towards the close of last century.\u2076\n\nWhile on my return from England to China, via Siberia and Mongolia, in 1863, I first saw this arch.\u2077 At that time\n\n\u00b9 Du Halde. \"Description G\u00e9ographique, Historique, Chronologique, Politique, et Physique de la Chine, etc.\" Hague.

J. Edkins, of Peking, in anticipation of my arrival,\nI could only succeed in getting an impression on paper of a portion of the inscription on the west side of the archway; which was exhibited at the first meeting of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at Shanghai, in 1864. A short paper on the same was published in the Society's Journal for that year.\\(^1\\)\n\nhad come to the Mongolian plateau to meet me, but being a fortnight too early, he left a note for me at Kalgan, which, however, I never received. In that note he called my attention to the inscription on the arch, which he had observed in passing.\n\nAn engraving of the arch has recently been published by Professor Pumpey, who saw it in the spring of 1863. In his new work, \"Across America and Asia,\" he thus describes the place:\u2014\u201cThe next morning, leaving the plain, we entered the narrow valley, winding for several miles through a desolate gorge, enclosed by lofty walls and yellow cliffs of limestone. The mountain torrent, which at certain seasons dashes wildly through the valley, makes the construction of a durable road almost impossible, and it was only with difficulty, and with faith in the sure feet of our horses, that we managed slowly to pick our way through the long and narrow valley of sharp-edged boulders and masses of fallen rock. After several miles of this work we came to a point where the remains of an ancient road rising some distance above the bed of the valley was preserved along the mountain side. Ascending this by a long flight of steps, of highly polished blocks of limestone, granite, and porphyry, we passed through a gateway in an inner branch of the great wall, and came soon after to a beautiful white marble arch built during the Chin dynasty. This structure is remarkable from the fact that while its blocks are cut for a circular arch, the inner surfaces are hewn to produce a ceiling of semi-hexagonal form. It is interesting also to the student of the Chinese language, from the fact that the interior contains inscriptions in an ancient Chinese character. As Dr. Pogojeff wished to photograph this monument, we remained here till the next day, etc.\u201d\n\nIn the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, vol. ii. p. 190, are the following remarks in the journal of a missionary lady who lately passed Keu-yung kwan on her way to Kalgan:\u2014\u201cThe inner line of the great wall is at the entrance to the Nankho, and three or four branches cross it. We passed through ten gateways. These are double, as is customary with cities. The wall is dilapidated in some places, but the gateways are all solidly built, and in good repair. One was very fine, having much carved work, and inscriptions in six different languages. One of these European scholars cannot read.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, New series, No. 1, pp. 133\u2013136.\nAs there stated, the inscription is engraved in the characters of six different nations, and covers the greater part of the inner facing of the structure on both sides, from the basement to the spring of the arch. Two of the parts are inscribed in horizontal lines at the top, in antique Devanagari and Tibetan characters respectively, twenty feet long on each wall. Below these are four compartments inscribed respectively in Mongol, Ouigour, Neuchih and Chinese characters, all in vertical lines.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, when on a visit to the north of China, I succeeded in completing my impression of the four last-named parts of the inscription, but could not get the Sanscrit and Tibetan portions, on account of their great height from the ground. At a subsequent period, however, these were procured by Mr. Edkins, and he has kindly sent me a hand tracing by a Chinese, from his impression.\n\nIt will be seen that the great interest of this inscription is the large and correct specimen it offers of the Neuchih character, the national writing of the Kin dynasty Tartars, the knowledge of which is now absolutely lost in China, and very few specimens are known to exist or to be accessible.\n\nThe great age of this piece of art however,\u2014more than five centuries,\u2014taken into consideration, it is not surprising that it has suffered much from various causes; large portions of the stone have dropped out in many places; the surface, especially towards the base, is much chipped and defaced, and in some places the characters have become so filled up with hard matter, as scarcely to give any legible impression on the paper. The numerous lacun\u00e6 thus produced form the chief difficulty in the decipherment.\n\nA slight comparison of the different parts was sufficient to show that they were all transcripts of a Sanscrit original. On the eastern wall the correspondence for the greater part is tolerably close throughout. That on the western side is much less regular, no one version being the exact counterpart of any other, gaps and redundancies occurring in many places, especially in the latter part.\n\nThe present paper then will be occupied specially with the\neastern side of the archway, leaving the opposite one as a subject for future investigation; as I find each side is complete in itself.\n\nOutside the original inscription, there is an intimation in smaller Chinese characters, on the right-hand border, towards the top, to the effect that the structure was \"repaired with funds given by the meritorious and believing official Lin P\u2019oo-heen, on the 15th day of the 5th month of the year 1445.\" It is to be noticed, that this is exactly a century after the date of the original inscription, 1345, which by a singular accident is preserved, in a line where little else is legible.\n\nAs the Chinese characters were more easily intelligible to me than any of the others, and consequently promised the readiest key to the mystery, I naturally turned to that part of the inscription first. Unfortunately I found it specially faulty and illegible; and it was necessary to supply large lacun\u00e6 by analogy, and with the aid derivable from the transcripts in the other characters. There are twenty-one columns of large characters, which are succeeded by twenty columns of a smaller size; and with the exception of the Sanscrit, which consists entirely of large characters, all the other compartments have, like the Chinese, part in large characters and part in small. Of the large character portion, which it was at once obvious was a mere transcript of Sanscrit sounds, I have lately found another rendering in a Chinese ritual, the \u7985\u9580\u65e5\u8aa6 Shen mun jih sung, \"Daily recitations of the Shen sect;\"\u00b9 in which it is spelt out with a set of characters differing almost entirely from those on the inscription; so that it is only by the phonetic approximation that the identity can be detected. The title of the piece, as given in the ritual,\u2014but omitted in the inscription,\u2014is \u4f5b\u9802\u5c0a\u52dd\u5927\u9640\u7f85\u5c3c Fuh ting tsun shing ta to lo ne, \"Great dh\u00e2ran\u00ee of the honoured diadem on Buddha\u2019s cranium.\"\u00b2 It may be remarked that in every instance where a\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Edkins identifies the Shen sect with the Jains of India.\n\n\u00b2 In another ritual, the \u745c\u4f3d\u7130\u53e3 Yu kea yen kow, \"Flaming mouths of the Yoga,\" in the possession of W. Lockhart,\ncompound character is used in the Sanscrit,\u2014and such instances are very numerous,\u2014the same is expressed by two Chinese characters in the column, followed by two smaller ones, \u4e8c\u5408 urh h\u00f6, \u201ctwo combined,\u201d placed horizontally. This practice is invariable, both in the inscription and in the ritual. The copy in the ritual is marked off by stops, into words or clauses throughout. By the discovery of this duplicate, I have been enabled to fill up the gaps in the Chinese part of the inscription almost without the chance of error.\n\nHaving ascertained that all the different portions were transcripts or transliterations of a Sanscrit original, the importance of restoring and analyzing this original was apparent; and for this purpose I have turned to account the tracing sent to me by Mr. Edkins. This consists of five horizontal lines of characters, each two inches in depth and twenty feet in length. Besides being in an obsolete form of the Devanagari, the Chinese copyist, as might be expected, has made numerous errors in his endeavours to extricate the complex characters from the half-obliterated legend on the stone. So great was the confusion thus produced, that it would have been hopeless for any but a Sanscrit scholar to have succeeded in restoring the half-obscured forms. At this stage I was under obligation to Dr. E. Haas, of the British Museum, who kindly identified the greater number of the characters for me. Having this clue to start with, by a comparison of the several transcripts, I was able to make an approximate restoration of the whole, and wrote out the same in English letters. Being in G\u00f6ttingen shortly after, I showed this transcript to Professor Benfey, who readily gave me a partial translation, and pointed out many errors in the proposed restoration; although a failure of eyesight, from which he was at the time suffering, prevented him entering so minutely into the details, as he otherwise would willingly have done. These hints however put me in the way of\n\nEsq., the same is given with the abbreviated title \u5c0a\u52dd\u5492 Tsun shing chow, \u201cPrayer to the honoured diadem.\u201d\nmaking numerous corrections; and after repeated amendments, in which Dr. Haas has taken much trouble to assist me, I am indebted to that gentleman for a complete and independent translation of the whole; which is subjoined hereafter the phonetic transcript. A few places, and only a few, have persistently refused to submit to the rigour of grammatical laws; and it is not surprising, in the case of a dead language being traditionally preserved for centuries among a people by whom it is not understood, that a few errors should creep in. It is rather to be wondered at, and indicates a remarkable veneration for the sounds of the sacred language, that the text as preserved should be able to give out such a complete and intelligible meaning.\n\nTRANSLITERATION.\u00b9\n\nOm namo bhagavate sarvatrailokyaprativi\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ya buddh\u0101ya te nama\u1e25 tadyath\u0101 om bh\u016br om bh\u016br om sodhaya sodhaya vi\u1e63odhaya vi\u1e63odhay\u0101sama samant\u0101vabh\u0101s\u0101vara\u1e47a gatigaganasvabh\u0101vavi\u1e63uddhe abhishinchena\u00b2 tu m\u0101\u1e41 sarvatath\u0101gata sugata varavachan\u0101mrit\u0101bhisekair mah\u0101mudr\u0101\u00b3 mantrapadail\u0101 \u0101hara \u0101hara mam\u0101yu\u1e25 sant\u0101ra\u1e47i sodhaya sodhaya vi\u1e63odhaya vi\u1e63odhaya gaganasvabh\u0101vavi\u1e63uddhe ushn\u012bshavijayapari\u1e63uddhe sahasrara\u1e63misamchodite sarvatath\u0101gat\u0101valokini \u015batp\u0101ramit\u0101parip\u016br\u1e47i sarvatath\u0101gatamatida\u015babh\u016bmipratish\u1e6dhite sarvatath\u0101gatahrday\u0101dhish\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101dhish\u1e6dhite mudre mudre mah\u0101mudrevajrak\u0101yasamahatanapari\u1e63uddhe sarvakarm\u0101varapa-visuddhe pratinvartaya mam\u0101yu\u1e25 vi\u1e63uddhe sarvatath\u0101gatasamay\u0101dhish\u1e6dh\u0101nuddhishthite om muni muni mah\u0101muni vimuni vimuni mah\u0101vimuni,\u2074 mati mati mah\u0101mati mamati\u2075 sumatitath\u0101t\u0101bh\u0113 ko\u1e6dipari\u1e63uddhe visbutabuddhi\u1e63uddhe\u2076 he he jaya jaya jaya jaya samara\n\n\u00b9 The italics represent the restorations, which are illegible in the Sanscrit.\n\u00b2 Dr. Haas corrects this to abhishinches.\n\u00b3 Dr. Haas adds m here.\n\u2074 Dr. Haas thinks the inscription is in error here, and that the preceding six words should end in ne instead of ni.\n\u2075 Dr. Haas thinks this word should be mah\u0101mati.\n\u2076 I understand that sbu is an impossible combination in Sanscrit; and although the Sanscrit character is missing on the stone, yet the several transcripts in the other characters are so distinct that I do not feel at liberty to abandon it.

Perhaps it means that a stop is to be made for meditation on the particular merits of each Bodhisattva. But it may also be an abbreviation, indicative of the repetition of the whole formula.\" (Dr. Haas.)\nthe mysteries of that abstruse subject. Suffice it to say that, according to the general definition, they are certain mystical formul\u00e6, supposed to carry with them a magical influence in the recitation, and this influence is not simply dependent on their utterance as a whole, but is supposed to be inherent in the single words, and even in the separate letters of the forms. In a system where all the objects of sense are but so many ideas in a world of unreality, words constitute not merely names, but the actual essence of the things named; and the possession of the name is consequently the possession of the object. This may account for the incoherent and almost meaningless ejaculations observable throughout the inscription; and it is but a refinement of the same notion to attribute a similar virtue to the elements of which the words are made up. From words and letters, the same occult efficacy was transferred to symbols made by a particular placing of the fingers, which is called mudr\u0101, or \"the seal,\" and this appears to be personified here as an object of adoration.\n\nThe above translation seems to be tolerably near the meaning of the text; and although after every effort at reconstruction, a few grammatical solecisms still remain, yet I believe there are very few places now, where the original syllables are not correctly restored. It is indeed interesting to have an exact interpretation of the text; but the main thing for our present purpose, is to identify the vocables without error; and when once assured of the powers of the Sanscrit characters, we can proceed with confidence to the analysis and restoration of the several transliterations.\n\nThe dh\u0101rani concludes near the end of the fourth line on the stone, thus:\u2014\"with the words of mystic prayers (mantra). Sv\u0101h\u0101.\" The doxology that follows is only found in one of the transliterations. From the remarks of Burnouf on the subject,\u00b2 I am inclined to think that this concluding piece is the mantra alluded to in the final sentence of the dh\u0101rani.\n\n\u00b9 See Vassilief's \"Le Bouddisme,\" translated by La Comme, p. 141, passim.\n\u00b2 Introduction \u00e0 l'histoire du Bouddhisme Indien, p. 540.\nIt may be remarked that the invocation *Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101*, by which the Chinese and three of the others commence, is omitted in the Sanscrit.\n\nImmediately below the Sanscrit text is the transcript in three horizontal lines of Tibetan characters, below which are four lines of Tibetan in smaller characters. The Tibetan character being a direct derivative from the Devanagari,\\(^1\\) it might be expected that this would prove the most important of the transcripts for identifying the original text. Unfortunately however, the breaks in the face of the stone are so extensive, that not much more than half of the writing is preserved; and the indistinctness of that, probably, has led the copyist into so many errors and omissions, that the tracing serves for little more than mere hints; but it may in great part be corrected by the other transcripts. This contains the introductory invocation *Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101*, and the *dh\u0101rani* occupies about two lines and a third; the remaining portion being totally different from the Sanscrit, though it is evidently Sanscrit also.\n\nThe first of the vertical portions below the preceding, beginning from the left hand, is in that form of the Mongol known as the B\u0101shpah\\(^2\\) alphabet. This consists of twenty lines in large characters, the lines succeeding from left to right; which are followed by eight lines of Mongolian in a smaller character. The transcript commences with the invocation *Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101*, and contains the whole of the *dh\u0101rani*, but nothing additional.\n\nAlthough the history of this alphabet and writing is dis-\n\n\\(^1\\) The Tibetan characters were invented by Thumi Sambhota, the Prime Minister of Srongtsan Gampo, King of Tibet, from the Devanagari alphabet, about the middle of the seventh century.\u2014Schlagintweit.

Pallas writes the name Pagba. Remusat gives it Phaspa, Paspa, B\u0101schpah, and Pa-sse-pa, in different places of his Recherches sur les langues Tartares. Klaproth uses Bh\u00e2chbah, as the Tibetan transcript of the original Sanscrit. Pauthier uses Pa-sse-pa.\ntinetly related in the Chinese annals, yet its actual existence seems, up to a very recent period, to have been a matter of doubt with European writers.\n\nChinese history tells us that the emperor Kubla commissioned the Tibetan lama Bashpah to construct an alphabet or syllabary specially adapted to the Mongol language. His task was completed, and the alphabet initiated for public use by an imperial decree in 1269. Schools for the study of this character were also instituted the same year. Several notices on record lead us to believe that the Chinese never took willingly to the use of this alphabet; but there is no doubt it was the official writing during the Yuen dynasty; and it appears to be the one known as the Mongolian character in the Chinese records of that period.\n\nPallas gives the same account of Bashpah's invention,\\(^1\\) derived apparently from a Mongol source; and the last plate in his work contains what he calls a specimen of Bashpah's square character,\\(^2\\) but he does not tell us where he got it. That plate has been repeatedly quoted as the first specimen of Bashpah's alphabet published in Europe; but I am very doubtful if Bashpah had anything to do with the character there given,\\(^3\\) or if Pallas had ever seen the writing invented\n\n\\(^1\\) Sammlungen historischer Nachrichten \u00fcber die Mongolischen V\u00f6lkerschaften, vol. ii. p. 358.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. vol. ii. plate 22.\n\n\\(^3\\) When on a visit to the great lamasary Yung-ho-kung, in Peking, I observed in one of the temples a pall inscribed in the common Tibetan character, with a horizontal heading in a character which was unknown to me. I thought it of sufficient interest to take a copy of it, which I give here:\n\n```\nom a \u00e1 e \u00e9 i \u00ed u \u00fa o \u00f3 k kh ng ch ch' gn t th n\npph m y r l b v j s ya g ds d' w sh k' b\nri ri li li kr\n```\n\nSubsequently, when I saw Pallas' work for the first time, I was surprised to find my copy almost identical with his plate, except\nby that celebrated lama; for it will be observed that all the known examples resemble much more closely the common Tibetan character, than does that of Pallas, which is evidently a modification of the Scharr form.\n\nIn the Appendix to Courtin's \"Encyclop\u00e9die Moderne,\" Klaproth, in an article on \"Grammaire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\" gives an alphabet which he calls \"Square Landsha,\" being nearer in resemblance to B\u00e2shpah's than the preceding; but though some have taken it to be identical with his invention, I do not believe there is any direct connection between the two.\n\nSchmidt seems to ignore the existence of a separate alphabet under the name of B\u00e2shpah, as having been ever used among the Mongols.\n\nRemusat says this alphabet was never used out of Tibet, notwithstanding the reiterated orders of the emperors. He promises to give an exemplar of the alphabet in his second volume, from the Suh hung keen luh, together with some explanatory details; but the second volume never appeared. Never having seen an instance of the employment of this character, he seems to have been unable to divest himself of the idea, that the invention of B\u00e2shpah was nothing more than the application to the Mongolian language, of the common characters used by the Tibetans at the present day. That hypothesis however is totally refuted by the present inscription, where we have the Tibetan portion in the identical character used by that people now, and the Mongol portion in the B\u00e2shpah character.\n\nKlaproth, while arguing for this writing having been used in China, says there are a great many medals of Kubla khan in existence, of which the legend is entirely or in part in the\n\nthat he gives an additional portion at the beginning and end; but he gives no explanation of what are the characters. I conclude, from examination, that they are simply the alphabet, and have identified the greater number with tolerable probability; believing that the additional ones given by Pallas are compounds.\n\n1 Plate 7.\n2 Forschungen im Gebiete der \u00e4lteren religi\u00f6sen, politischen, und literarischen Bildungsgeschichte der V\u00f6lker Mittel Asiens.\n3 Recherches sur les langues Tartares, p. 193.\nsquare characters. These seem to be the only evidence that he was able to adduce of the use of this character in China. While I think it very doubtful however, whether there be any such medals of the reign of Kubla, it is very easy to understand how Klaproth should have been led into such a mistake. I have never seen any, or a description of any in Chinese books on medals; but I have a number of coins in the B\u00e2shpah character, dating at various periods from 1308 to 1354.\n\nI have seen several stone slabs inscribed with this character, and notices of a good many more, the present one dating so late as 1345. In 1307, it is recorded that Polo Timor, a high dignitary, presented to the emperor a copy of the Hcaou king, or \"Book of Filial piety,\" written in the B\u00e2shpah character, which the monarch ordered to be printed and circulated. I am only aware of one little book in that character having survived to the present day, i.e. the Pih kea sing, or \"Book of Surnames,\" which has been preserved by being reprinted in the King chuen pae peen, a work in 120 books, published in 1581, consisting of extracts from other works on every class of subjects. The eighty-first book is occupied exclusively with the reprint of the Pih kea sing; but so unmercifully mutilated are the characters, that without the Chinese key, it would have been an utter impossibility to have deciphered them. These facts then leave little doubt that this character was used to a considerable extent in China, till near the end of the Yuen dynasty.\n\nIn 1838, H. Conon von Gabelentz published the first specimen in Europe, of the actual employment of the character. This was an inscription in the Mongolian language, which he had extracted from a reprint of the Shih mih tseuen hwa, a Chinese work on lapidary inscriptions, first published in 1618.\n\nA silver plate with a gilt inscription in this same character, was found in 1846, in the district of Minusinsk and govern-\n\n---\n\n1 M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l'Asie, tome ii.\n2 Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. ii. p. 1, etc.\nment of Jenissei, in Eastern Siberia. This was deposited in the Asiatic Museum of the Academy of Sciences at Petersburg; and gave rise to a protracted controversy in various periodicals between Messrs. Habakkuk, Grigorief, Hyacinth, Schmidt, Schott, and Banzarof. Mr. Grigorief published a facsimile and an essay on the subject, in the Journal of the Administration of the Interior.\\(^1\\)\n\nAn edict in honour of Confucius published by the emperor Woo-tsung on his accession in 1307, was engraved in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese and Bashpah Mongol characters. An impression of the same is preserved in the Asiatic Museum at Petersburg, and a copy of it was given by Father Hyacinth in his work on the statistics of the Chinese empire.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn 1853, another silver plate, with an inscription similar to the preceding, was discovered at Verchni Udinsk, to the east of Lake Baikal; and is now preserved in the Hermitage Palace in Petersburg. An account of this was given by Mr. Sav\u00e9lief in the fifth volume of the Transactions of the Archaeological Society at Petersburg.\\(^3\\) These plates seem to have been signets given to military envoys, and those holding imperial commissions.\n\nIn an article on Sanscrit and Mongolian characters by Mr. Edkins, published in 1855,\\(^4\\) he has given a facsimile reproduction of the \\(Pth kea sing\\), from the King chuen pae peen.\n\nWithout knowing anything of what had been done by Von Gabelentz and the Russian orientalists, I chanced one day during the occupation of Shanghae city by the Triad rebels in 1854, to notice in the Confucian temple, an inscription in this character,\\(^5\\) which proved to be a transcript\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal Asiatique, 5e s\u00e9rie, pp. 527-558.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. p. 526.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ibid. pp. 527-558.\n\n\\(^4\\) Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, part v. pp. 101-108 and 5 plates.\n\n\\(^5\\) The Confucian temple was afterwards burnt down, and this slab was broken and otherwise injured by the fire. When Shanghae was retaken by the imperialists, the temple was rebuilt in another part of the city, and most of the old tablets found a place in the\nof an edict by Kubla khan, the Chinese original of which was engraved below it. At some risk and trouble I procured a few impressions from this stone, and sent one of them, through Sir John Bowring, to the Royal Asiatic Society in London, where it still remains. A short article on the subject, by myself, appeared in the \"Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\"\u00b9 for 1855, giving a copy of the inscription in the Mongol and Chinese characters, and also cuts of several coins of the Yuen dynasty.\u00b2 There is also a restoration of the commencement of the P\u00eeh kea sing noticed above.\n\nIn 1860, M. Pauthier gave a French translation of the inscription which I had published in the Hongkong Transactions. This appeared in the Journal Asiatique,\u00b3 together with some interesting details on the B\u00e2shpah alphabet.\n\nThe same year a very neat fount of type for this character was cast at the Imprimerie Imp\u00e9riale at Paris, under the instructions of M. Pauthier.\n\nAn article which I had written on the Mongolian inscrip-\n\nnew erection. This place was afterwards used as a lodging for the British officers during the military occupation of that city; and in their little arrangements to make things comfortable, all the inscribed tablets in the walls had been covered with plaster and whitewash.

The cut of the coin to note || on page 55 is erroneously placed as note* on page 58. The note marked || at the foot of page 55 should be referred to the word P\u00eeh, in the third line of page 56. The Mongol letter p, placed on its side, thus ||, on page 64, should be ||. The four Mongol characters at the top of page 65 are upside down. Engravings of some of these coins may be seen in an article by C. B. Hillier, on \"Chinese Coinage,\" in the Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, part ii., 1848\u201350, pp. 105\u2013110; also in the works of De Chaudoir, Endlicher, and others, on Chinese numismatics. A special article by Pauthier, on one of these coins, appeared in the Journal Asiatique, 5me. s\u00e9rie, tom. xv. pp. 321\u2013337, 1860.\n\u00b3 Vol. xix. pp. 5\u201347.\ntion, translated and published by Von Gabelentz, in the \"Zeitschrift,\" was translated into French by M. Pauthier, and appeared in the Journal Asiatique for 1862.\\(^1\\)\n\nBoth this inscription and the edict of Kubla were reproduced with the new type, in the Appendix to Pauthier's splendid edition of Marco Polo.\n\nThe vertical portion to the right of the Mongol is in the Ouigour character, consisting of twenty lines in a large type and twelve in a smaller. The large character part corresponds almost literally throughout with the Sanscrit. There is no initial invocation, and the doxology at the end of the dh\u00e1rani is a transcript of the Sanscrit, with one slight deviation.\n\nThe Ouigour branch of the Turkish race seem to have been in close proximity and intercourse with the Mongols during the Yuen dynasty. They are reported to have been in possession of an alphabet and literature from an unknown antiquity; and scholars are divided in their opinions as to the origin of their written character. The Syriac,\\(^2\\) the Sab\u00e6an,\\(^3\\) and the Zend,\\(^4\\) have each been proposed as the most probable source whence derived. The earliest mention of Ouigour literature is to be found in the Chinese records, about the middle of the fifth century, at which time we are informed that they possessed in their language Maou's \"Book of Odes,\" the \"Confucian Analects,\" and the \"Book of Filial Piety,\" besides some Poets and Historians.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn giving an analysis of a catalogue of Buddhist works, published in China in 1306, Professor Julien makes the following interesting remarks, bearing on Ouigour literature:\n\n\"The last preface dated in 1306, gives the names of twenty-nine savans versed in the Tibetan, Ouigour, Sanscrit, and Chinese languages, who were charged, as appears by the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vol. xix. pp. 461\u2013471.\n\\(^2\\) Remusat, Recherches sur les langues Tartares, p. 29, passim.\n\\(^3\\) Klaproth, Abhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren, p. 53.\n\\(^4\\) Davids, Grammaire Turke, p. xvi.\n\\(^5\\) Remusat, Recherches, etc., p. 284.\npreface of 1289, to compare the texts with each other, to collate the translations, and to revise and fix them definitively for the general re'impression. Their work, begun in 1285, was finished in 1287. Among these savans, we observe a Buddhist priest from Toufsan, versed in the knowledge of every branch of the sacred literature, who was charged by imperial order to verify the Indian words, and an academician, named To-in-tou-tong, who was commissioned to translate the Ouigour words. An extremely curious fact, unknown hitherto, seems to result from the last-named fact, that is, that the greater part of the Buddhist books must have been translated into Ouigour for the use of the subjects of the Chinese empire who spoke that language. This conjecture is fully justified by the following testimony. I read in the history of celebrated Buddhists, published under the Sung in 988, a passage which shows that anciently the Buddhist books were translated, not only in Tibetan and in Chinese, but also in the languages of people now under submission to the Chinese, and whom the latter treated as barbarians:\u2014'When the Sutras and works on discipline from India were taken to Koutch\u00e9, on the north of the Tsung-ling mountains, to L\u00e8ou-lan, to Kharachar, to Khotan, and to Khashgar, the natives not understanding the language of India, the books were translated for them into the barbarian languages which they spoke.' Now several of the above-named countries, which at present form part of Bucharia, were previously occupied by Ouigour tribes, at the epoch when our catalogue was published. Scarcely more than two or three Ouigour manuscripts are known in the great libraries of Europe; should there exist then at Peking any considerable portion of the Buddhist books in this ancient dialect of oriental Turkish, so precious for philology, and so little known, it would be an object of the highest interest, to purchase them there at any price, and to place them within the reach of scholars.\"\n\nOf the very few specimens of the ancient language and\n\n1 M\u00e9langes de G\u00e9ographie Asiatique, pp. 223, 224.\nliterature of the Ouigours known in Europe, the oldest of the manuscripts does not date earlier than the 10th century.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhen the Mongols under Genghis khan began to attain their immense power, they were a comparatively unpolished people, and possessed no literature of their own. On the defeat of the Naimans by that nation, Tatatonggo, the secretary of the Naiman prince, a Ouigour by birth, was made prisoner; but was instated by Genghis as Professor of the Ouigour language and literature, for the benefit of his subjects, the princes and nobles of the Mongol nation.\\(^2\\) Being thus initiated into the literature of the Ouigours, as a matter of necessity the Mongols had naturally fallen into the habit of using the same character for the purpose of committing their own language to writing; and this practice continued to prevail during the supremacy of Ogdai, Guyu, and Manggu, the three successors of Genghis khan. Ruysbruk, who went on an embassy to the Mongolian court, from France, in 1253, speaking of the Ouigour characters, says:\u2014\u201cMangu khan has sent to your Majesty (St. Louis) letters written in the Mongol or Tartar language, but in Ouigour characters.\u201d\\(^3\\)\n\nWhen the dynasty took possession of China, under the succeeding monarch, Kubla, and the exigencies of a fixed government were more urgent, the inadequacy of the Ouigour character fully to express the articulations and vocables of the Mongol language were felt to be a source of embarrassment. As, it would seem, no man among the Mongols was found to possess sufficient philological tact and inventive skill to remedy this inconvenience, the venerable Tibetan lama Saadja Bandida, under special invitation, took up his residence at the court of Kubla, and applied himself to the task of so modifying the Ouigour character as to adapt it to the requirements of the Mongol. In his scheme he had retained the fourteen Ouigour consonants, but he died while engaged on the work, leaving it still incomplete. The result was, the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Davids, Grammaire Turke, p. xviii.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. p. xviii.

Although the latter was promulgated in 1269, as the official character of the dynasty, yet in 1272, we find a memorial to the throne complaining that the officials persist in writing their documents in the Ouigour character. An edict followed thereupon, condemning the practice, and insisting upon the adoption of B\u00e2shpah\u2019s character. In 1278 the use of the Ouigour character on the military signets was forbidden. In 1284, an imperial decree forbade the use of the Ouigour character in all memorials and documents presented by the metropolitan functionaries.\n\nAbout the beginning of the 14th century, Eldja\u00eftu, the successor of Kubla, commissioned the priest Tsordji Osir to translate the Tibetan sacred books into the Mongolian language, and write them out in the B\u00e2shpah character. The lama, however, failed in the attempt; and in order to supersede the difficulty, he reverted to the unfinished work of Saadja Bandida, made such additions as were needful for his purpose, and wrote out with it a Mongol translation of the Tibetan work Bangcha Ruktcha, but found it necessary to express a great many words in Tibetan characters.\n\nUnder the direction of Kaisun-killik, the succeeding Emperor, who reigned from 1307 to 1311, Tsordji Osir made such further additions as were needful for adapting the Ouigour alphabet to the perfect transcription of the sounds of the Mongol language. These details, drawn mostly from Klapproth\u2019s \u201cAbhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren,\u201d are found in the Chinese history of the Yuen dynasty, and also in a Mongol work, Brulba Saagdja Bandida yin gar-gaksan Mongol Usuk, \u201cThe Mongol literature invented by the holy Saagdja Bandida,\u201d published in China in 1730.\u00b9\n\nAhmed Ibn Arabsch\u00e2h, an Arabian author, who wrote about 1440, gives a short notice of the Ouigour alphabet, in which he says:\u2014\u201cThe Djaghat\u00e2iens have a writing which they call Ouigour, and which may be recognized as the same\n\n\u00b9 See Remusat\u2019s Recherches, etc. p. 154. Pallas, Sammlungen, etc. vol. ii. p. 356. Klapproth, Abhandlung, etc. p. 57.\nas that of the Mongols; it is composed of fourteen consonants, which have the forms following.\" Here he inserts a copy of the Ouigour alphabet.\n\nThe work above named, Brulba, etc., also gives a table of the fourteen consonants of the Ouigours, combined respectively with the three vowels, \\(a\\), \\(\u00e2\\), and \\(i\\), as used by the Mongols, previous to the improvement of the lamas. It is doubtful, however, if this be altogether trustworthy; for we find nothing in it to represent the vowel \\(o\\), a letter which is of constant occurrence in the specimens of Ouigour literature preserved in Europe. Were it not so, I should have been disposed to think that in the present transcription we had a specimen of the writing in a transition stage; but from the close resemblance which it bears to the caligraphy of the two Mongolian letters discovered by Remusat in the archives of France, I have no doubt that it is a pure specimen of the character as used by the Ouigours. These two letters,\u2014addressed to Philip the Fair of France, the first by Argun, the Mongol prince of Persia, in 1289; and the second by Eldjaitu, his successor, in 1305;\u2014were thought by Remusat to be in the original Ouigour character, though the documents are in the Mongol language.\n\nIn 1845, a silver plate similar to the signets bearing the B\u00e2shpah superscriptions noticed above, but having the superscription in the Ouigour character, was found at Grouchovka, on the Dnieper, in the government of Ekat\u00e9rinoslaf, in Southern Russia. A report on this plate was made to the Academy of Sciences at Petersburg, in 1848, by Mr. Banzarof, which was published in their \"Bulletin historico-philologique,\" with a facsimile engraving; from which we see that the writing is almost identical with that on the in-\n\n---\n\n1 Langl\u00e8s, in Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Biblioth\u00e8que Royale, tom. v.

As we know that the use of the Ouigour character on these signets was prohibited in 1278, it must have been made previous to that date.\n\nThe portion to the right of the Ouigour is in the Neuchih character, consisting of twenty-seven lines of large size and twenty-one lines of a smaller type. The large character portion is almost a counterpart of the Sanscrit, down to about the middle of the twenty-fifth line, where the dh\u00e1rani concludes. It commences with the invocation Om bh\u016br om sv\u0101h\u0101, the same as the Chinese and others, and the portion following the dh\u00e1rani is evidently a doxology, though I have only succeeded in identifying a small portion of it.\n\nAlthough the name of this writing is not unknown to orientalists, yet beyond the name very few facts have been gathered; and this inscription I believe to be unique, not only as giving a correct specimen of the caligraphy, but as being the only piece yet discovered, in which there is any clue to the powers of the characters.\n\nThe Neuchih Tartars succeeded the Tsitans as the dominant power in the north of China, in the early part of the 12th century, under the name of the Kin dynasty. Originally a rude unlettered tribe, they were dependent upon the Chinese and Tsitans for their correspondence and literary negotiations; but they learned to rise with their position, and it was not long ere they began to feel the inconvenience of transacting their diplomacy through interpreters in an alien language. Impressed no doubt with the importance of possessing a national literature, the preliminary necessity of a written character capable of expressing the sounds of their language became apparent. They saw that their predecessors and vanquished rivals, the Tsitans, had been placed at a similar disadvantage at the beginning of their rule, and had invented a character which had been the national writing of the Leaou dynasty for about two hundred years.\u00b9 Following their precedent, Akuta, the founder of the Kin, resolved upon\n\n\u00b9 I only know of the existence of one inscription in this character, and as there is no translation of it in Chinese or any other language,\nhaving special resources for reducing to writing the language of his tribe; and having among his captives many subjects of the Chinese and also of the Leaou, a special study was made of the literature of these two nations. The result was that an imperial commission, consisting of Ouy\u00e9, Moulianho, and Kuhshin, was appointed to form a new set of symbols, from the elements of the Chinese pattern-hand characters, on the same principle as those of the Tsitan, but adapted to the sounds of their national language.\\(^1\\) In a few months the characters were formed, and an imperial decree issued in the eighth month of the year 1119, ordered their general adoption.\\(^2\\) In 1138, He-tsung, the third emperor, originated a new set of characters for the Neuchih language, and these were named Small Neuchih characters; while those which Kuhshin and his colleagues had invented were termed the Large Neuchih characters.\\(^3\\) The small characters were brought into use officially, in the fifth month of the year 1145.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe Vandalism attendant on the overthrow of dynasties in China, has been especially destructive to the literary productions of the conquered party, and it is scarcely to be expected that many traces of the literary ingenuity of the Neuchih would survive their subjection to another race. A note to the *Suh wan heen t'ung k'aou* tells us that the Chinese Classics and Histories were translated in this character; and a catalogue of the imperial library during the Ming\\(^5\\) gives it remains at present a dead letter. The following five characters are preserved with their interpretation in the Chinese \"Topography of Ching-tih prefecture.\" \n\n- \u652f (as used by the emperor);\n- \u652f To run;\n- \u9a6c Horse;\n- \u6025 Urgent.\n\nThe history of the Leaou dynasty speaks of an edict having been engraved on stone, in the characters of the Tsitans, Turks, and Chinese, but I am not aware if that inscription is still extant.\n\n\\(^1\\) *Suh wan heen t'ung k'aou*, book 184, p. 31.

Whether any of these are still in existence is I think at least doubtful, but M. Rosny expresses a more hopeful view of the case.\u00b9\n\nThat the language and literature of the Neuchihs did not at once disappear with the extinction of the dynasty we have evidence, for in 1407, when a translatorial institution was established by the Ming, for the purpose of facilitating correspondence with foreign nations, one of the languages to which special attention was directed was the Neuchih. The students were examined periodically, and the most efficient appointed to offices in connection with the embassies. In 1470 seven interpreters were officially designated for the Neuchih language, and the number was afterwards increased to nine. The translatorial office was re-established on the accession of the present dynasty in 1644, with a president and corps of fifty-six professors. Long before this, however, it is probable that the cumbrous Neuchih character had become obsolete, for in the accounts we have of the invention or rather adaptation of the present Manchu character, there is no hint of any kind of writing in existence peculiar to the tribe. The Manchus being the actual descendants of the Kin dynasty Neuchihs, there would scarcely be a distinct language, and we consequently find the Neuchih department of the translators\u2019 office suppressed in 1659, and the ancient Neuchih character entirely superseded by the modern Manchu.\n\nRemusat, in his \u201cRecherches sur les langues Tartares,\u201d has written at greater length on this subject than any other European author, having collected together what few notices he could find in Chinese works; but having never seen a\n\n\u00b9 He says: \u201cWhen the friends of science shall have undertaken scientific journeys, for the purpose of exploring the great public and private libraries of China, libraries whose number is immense, and the preservation of which has been the object of the greatest care and attention, we shall doubtless find the greater part of the literary monuments for which we are now anxious, and a number of others, which will prove so many revelations in the midst of this old Chinese world, whose destiny on earth may probably have been to preserve to us vestiges of primitive and forgotten ages in the history of the globe.\u201d\u2014Revue Orientale et Am\u00e9ricaine, 1\u1d49 s\u00e9rie, tom. vi. pp. 386, 387.\nspecimen of the Neuchih writing, he was induced by the descriptions to believe that the character now used by the Coreans was identical with that of the Kin dynasty. This hypothesis at least we are now in a position to meet with a direct negative. An inscription in an unknown character, at the Imperial Mausoleum at Keen-chow, in the Province of Shense, has been preserved to us in a Chinese work published in 1618, the \u77f3\u58a8\u942b\u83ef Shih mih tseuen hwa.\\(^1\\) From a Chinese translation and note given on the tablet, we learn that this is an inscription in the Neuchih or national character of the Kin dynasty. The date given is 1134, from which we see that it was cut previous to the invention of the Small Neuchih character; so that there is no doubt we have there a specimen of the Large Neuchih character, invented by Kuhshin and his colleagues.\n\nA facsimile of this inscription from the Che p\u00fch ts\u00fch chae ts'ung shoo, was published by Professor Neumann in 1837, in regard to which he remarks:\u2014\u201cI am not able to read the Kin writing, much less to translate it; but it is obvious from the frequent repetitions of characters in the text of our memorial that this Kin writing consists of a syllabary composed of abbreviated and modified Chinese characters.\u201d\\(^2\\)\n\nShortly after this the same inscription seems to have attracted the attention of the Archimandrite Habakkuk, while he was residing at Peking, and he communicated it to Father Hyacinth at Petersburg in 1841. The latter gave a facsimile of the same in his work on the statistics of China.\\(^3\\)\n\nI was not aware of this inscription having been noticed or\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This work was reprinted during the present dynasty, in a collection entitled \u85dd\u5703\u641c\u5947 Epoo sow ke.

The same inscription is reproduced in the \u91d1\u77f3\u8403\u7de8 Kin shih tsuy peen, published in 1805. It is noticed in several other works on lapidary inscriptions.\n\n\\(^2\\) Asiatische Studien, p. 41.\n\n\\(^3\\) See Journal Asiatique, 5e s\u00e9rie, tom. 17, p. 532.\npublished by any one in Europe, when it occurred to me to collect what information I could regarding the system of writing used by the Neuchih; and the inscription in question, which I found in the Shih mih tseuen hua, being the only specimen of the character that I could discover, I forwarded a facsimile, with some remarks, to the Asiatic Society in 1859. The same appeared in the Society's Journal the following year.\u00b9\n\nIn 1861, Professor de Rosny, of Paris, published an article on \"The Neuchih, their language and literature,\"\u00b2 by which it appears he has misunderstood my remarks; but he expresses, with considerable confidence, his belief that the writing is ideographic and not alphabetic. Although my opinion was decidedly in favour of the Neuchih being an alphabetic or syllabic writing, I find, on referring to my former article, that I scarcely expressed such a view, preferring to leave the question to be decided when we should acquire more light on the subject. It was something novel to me to find M. de Rosny advocating the ideographic as the most probable, to the exclusion of the alphabetic, and I regret that he has not given us a fuller development of his reasons, for, from his extensive knowledge of the written characters of various nations, probably few are in a more favourable position to form a correct appreciation of the matter.\n\nIf my tendency was formerly towards the alphabetic theory, my views are now so far modified by the analysis of the newly-found inscription, that I incline to the view at first expressed by Professor Neumann, that the Kin was a syllabic writing.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 17, pp. 331, passim.\n\u00b2 \"Revue Orientale et Am\u00e9ricaine,\" 1re s\u00e9rie, tome 6, pp. 379\u2013387.\n\u00b3 The accompanying cut, taken from a Chinese brochure on coins, which has merely the title \u5916\u570b\u9322\u6587 Wae ku\u014d tseen uan, \"Superscriptions of foreign money,\" is termed a \"Sanscrit character coin;\" but as the character bears no resemblance to any known form of Sanscrit writing, and as it presents a strong similarity to that on the Keen-chow tablet, I am induced to think it is\nHaving ascertained, then, with tolerable certainty that the preceding inscription is a specimen of the Large Neuchih character; and being assured that the one with which we are now occupied is also Neuchih\u2014observing the radical difference in the formation of the characters; we are shut up to the conclusion that this is a specimen of the Small Neuchih character, invented in 1138. The date is more than two centuries later, being 1345.\n\nThanks to the transcripts in the other characters, and especially the Sanscrit, there are scarcely any of the Neuchih in the larger size part to which I cannot attach the sounds with a high degree of probability, if not absolute certainty. The conclusion at which I have arrived is given in the plate facing this page.\n\nThe last character in the list \u9f8d\u9f9c to which I have not put any sound, is one of very frequent occurrence, being found 39 times; that is, it is distinctly legible 33 times, and in six other places I have supplied it, as I think, on unquestionable authority. It is to be noticed that in every case this is written smaller than the other characters; a peculiarity which belongs only to two or three others in certain places, and appears to me to indicate that the sign so written plays a secondary part in the syllable. Another peculiarity which attaches to \u9f8d\u9f9c is, that while every other Neuchih sign is represented by a corresponding one in Chinese, there is in no case any counterpart to this in Chinese. Of the 39 places where it is found, 30 times it stands against the long vowel \u00e1; i.e. in \u00e1, 2; b\u00e1, 1; d\u00e1, 1; dd\u00e1h\u00e1, 1; h\u00e1, 7 (3 of which I have supplied); k\u00e1, 1; m\u00e1, 2; n\u00e1, 3 (one of which I have\n\na relic of the Kin. The paucity of documents in that character may warrant its insertion here. The explanatory note says:\u2014\"This Sanscrit character coin is eight-tenths of an inch diameter, and weighs 3 choo (\u9296) 6 ts'au (\u53c3). It is copper, of a pure red colour. The superscription is undecipherable, but it bears a general resemblance to the coins of \u5c4b\u99dd Uh-t'o and Turfan (or Tibet).\"\nsupplied); p\u0101, 1; sv\u0101, 1; t\u0101, 2; th\u0101, 7 (one of which I have supplied); y\u0101, 1; and twice it is found against the long vowel \u0101; i.e. in bh\u0101, 1; p\u016b, 1. Seven times it is found appended where there is no long vowel in the Sanscrit, of which four of the syllables end in a; i.e. na, 1; ra, 1; ta, 1; ya, 1;\u00b9 one ends in e; i.e. ddhe; and two end in i, i.e. ddhi, 1; and ti, 1 (which I have supplied).\n\nFrom the preceding analysis of 39 occurrences of this character, I am disposed to think that it is a sign indicating the lengthening of the vowel in the syllable to which it is attached, and that the seven (or perhaps six) exceptions are irregularities.\n\nSuch is the result of the inscription on the east side of the arch, and the decipherment of the west side would probably add a few more to the number of the identified vocables. From an examination of these 81 characters, I am convinced that the Neuchih writing was pre-eminently syllabic, and not alphabetic, as I inferred on a former occasion. The selection of symbols appears to me to be the most arbitrary, nor can I see any approach to principle or mutual relation in comparing the one with the other. Not only do we find the utmost diversity in the forms of any series of syllables we may select, classified either according to their initials or finals, or any other principle that I can think of; but there are also characters nearly similar in form, which express widely different sounds.\n\nThus the characters .va and .wa, although nearly allied phonetically, are yet totally unlike in every part. If there is any difference in sound between m\u0101n and m\u0101n, it is merely one of tone, as indicated by the Chinese equivalents; and yet their forms would never lead any one to suspect a phonetic connection. So also the two characters for ga and , although so utterly dissimilar, yet they represent precisely the same syllable. Again, if we have diversity of forms corresponding to similar sounds, there are also similar forms answering to very different sounds; thus ki only differs by one stroke from va.\n\n\u00b9 It is doubtful if this syllable ought not to be y\u0101.\nIt would seem as if a number of Chinese characters had been selected to represent the sounds in the Neuchih language, on the plan adopted by the Japanese, but abbreviated and disfigured after a fashion of their own, to which we have now no key. While the original or Large Neuchih characters, of which the specimen at Keen-chow has been published, show some traces of the form of Chinese, this latter invention of the Small Neuchih characters appears to be a more elegant and abbreviated form, in which the slight traces retained in the earlier invention are altogether obliterated, and the faintly-pictorial forms of which each character was made up are represented by merely conventional collocations of strokes. Thus we have all the cumbrous variety of a pictorial system adapted to the expression of a simple series of vocables. The scheme is, probably, unique in the history of chirography, and is not a little suggestive in reference to the condition of the people among whom it took its rise. It seems strange that a complex syllabary like this should have been adopted by a people living so near the tribes who were using the simple Ouigour alphabet, and would imply a very restricted intercourse with such tribes. Instead of wondering that such a method of writing should be neglected and become obsolete, we may rather be astonished that it was able to maintain its ground for two centuries and more, as is proved by this inscription.\n\nIt is probable that the eighty-one signs here given are but a small portion of the Neuchih syllabary, as it is not at all likely that the simple sounds of the Sanscrit alphabet would anything like exhaust the vocables of the Neuchih language. Accordingly we find in the twenty-one lines of small characters at the end of the large, a great number of new ones which do not occur in the preceding portion. Now as every several character has to be learned by itself, and the knowledge of any one or more gives no clue to what is the sound of another, here is a study of a much more difficult nature.\n\nI have mentioned that each of the parts except the Sanscrit concludes like this, with some lines in a smaller size character. On looking over the Chinese part, I saw at once that\nthat was not a mere transcript of foreign sounds, but a veritable piece of composition in the Chinese language. Although very much defaced and obliterated, I have been able to get an approximate sense out of the several detached fragments, though the omission of so many links necessarily prevents a perfect translation even of what remains.\n\nHaving shown the Tibetan portion to Professor Foucaux, at Paris, I ascertained from him that that was in the Tibetan language, and not a transliteration from another tongue. From a cursory inspection of that hopelessly imperfect portion, he could give me the meaning of such fragments, that I felt assured, if it was not the exact translation of the Chinese, it was at least the same in substance.\n\nA superficial examination of the Mongol portion satisfied me that that was also in the Mongol language; and the Ouigour portion seems to be in the Ouigour language. Under these circumstances, the presumption is almost a certainty that the small-size Neuchih is a specimen of the Neuchih language as well as writing. This imparts an additional interest to it; and while the difficulty of interpretation is thereby increased, its philological value is greatly enhanced.\n\nAppended is an interlinear restoration of the inscription, and the sounds of the syllables given in Latin characters, according to the Sanscrit. The columns coincide in length and number with the original lines of the Neuchih portion, and the corresponding syllables in each of the six lines are placed horizontally opposite, as near as the peculiarities of the respective systems will admit. The portion in black is what is preserved of the original inscription, and the missing parts which have been supplied are represented by the red.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 A reduced facsimile of the four vertical portions of the inscription, produced by photo-lithography, from the original rubbing, will appear in Col.
