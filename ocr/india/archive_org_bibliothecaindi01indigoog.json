B.\n\nCALCUTTA:\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL, 1 PARK STREET.\n\n1948\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION\n\nColonel Jarrett's English translation of the *Ain-i-Akbari*, Vol. III, (first published in 1893-'96) has been long out of print, though there is always a demand for it and second-hand copies are now selling at fancy prices. But a mere reprint of his edition would not do justice to the present state of Oriental scholarship and would naturally disappoint the modern reader. Jarrett began the preparation of his translation about 1890, that is fully 57 years ago. Among the authorities he most frequently quotes in his notes are D'Herbelot's *Bibliotheque Orientale* (1697 A.D.), D'Ohsson's *Histoire des Mongols* (1834), De Guignes's *Histoire Generale des Huns* (1756), Max Muller's *History of Sanskrit Literature* (1859), Davies's *Hindu Philosophy*, Colebrooke's *Essays* (1805-37) and Elphinstone's *History of India* (1841).\n\nSince then a complete revolution in our knowledge of these branches of orientology has been effected by the publication of Hastings's *Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics*, the *Encyclopaedia of Islam*, the *Grundriss* (Indo-Aryan ed. by Buhler and Iranian by Geiger and Kuhn), Winteritz's *History of Sanskrit Literature*, and the histories of Hindu Philosophy by Radhakrishnan and S. N. Das Gupta, besides many learned special monographs. In Oriental geography, the work of the modern French and German explorers in Arabia, Persia, Syria and Africa is, except for one or two of the earliest published, entirely unrepresented in Jarrett's notes, and how valuable their information is we can judge by contrasting his remarks on any place-name with the account of it given in the *Encyclopaedia of Islam*.\n\nThus, the first task of an editor of Jarrett's translation is to modernise his notes and elucidations by sweeping away his heaps of dead leaves. My second aim has been to lighten the burden of his notes, many of which are not only obsolete in information but prolix to the extent of superfluity. It is, I hold, a mistake of the translator's duty to try to make a modern reader get all his ideas of Hindu philosophy, literature, science and mythology, or Islamic hagiography, topography and science from an English translation of Abul Fazl's *Ain-i-Akbari*.\nAbul Fazl's original work was meant to serve as a handy encyclopaedia for readers of Persian who knew no other language and had no access to standard works even in the Persian and Arabic languages. The modern reader, versed in English, will find very much fuller and far more accurate information on these subjects in the voluminous encyclopaedias and standard monographs in the English language which have been published in our own times. The law of copyright would probably not permit me to transfer column after column of matter from these modern works to my footnotes, as Jarrett has done with the works of D'Herbelot and other antiquated sources. I have, therefore, totally omitted his lengthy quotations from these authors and given instead exact page references to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, and other modern authorities, which are available to serious students in the libraries of learned societies and Universities.\n\nI have also economised space and saved the reader from frequent unnecessary interruptions by the omission of the notes on the emendations of the printed Persian text made by the translator. The editing of many of the volumes in the Persian and Arabic section of the Bibliotheca Indica series, was not done with the necessary care and accuracy, as learned circles have found to their vexation. Therefore all obvious misprints and wrong readings have been silently corrected in this new edition of the translation and hundreds of notes of the first edition under this head eliminated. For example, on p. 68, we had \"Lakhnauti, in Bengal\" followed by the translator's note \"The text has Nek for Bang.\" Such errors, due to the careless placing of dots (nuqta) by copyists or proof-readers, are too obvious to raise any doubt; this note has been excluded by me as unnecessary. But in every really important case, where the emendation of the text raises a vital question or leaves room for difference of opinion, the notice of such emendation has been retained in the new edition.\n\nAbul Fazl's copyists or their successors made many errors and omissions in the matter of the latitude and longitude of places, all of which were corrected with meticulous care by Jarrett; I have retained all his corrections but dropped his references to the errors in the Persian text. On p. 104, Jarrett himself admits in despair, \"The whole (geographical) list of Abul Fazl is the work of a scribe, not of a geographer\".\nAbul Fazl's professed aim in writing the *Ain-i-Akbari* was to give the Persian-reading world of his day a clear idea of the literature, philosophy, arts and sciences of the Hindus, and the saints and heroes of India; but he also tried to adorn the subject by giving a brief account of the Muslim world, both in and out of India,\u2014by means of a short compilation from well-known Arabic and Persian authorities composed outside India. The portions of the *Ain* which serve the second purpose, make no claim to originality and have no historical value; their accuracy is vitiated by Abul Fazl's possession of very poor manuscripts of the Arabic works used by him. It is therefore not worth the while to note every one of the mistakes he (or his copyists) made for this reason.\n\nNo remark made above should be taken to cast any reflection on Col. Jarrett's scholarship or belittle the stupendous task that he accomplished with immense industry and deep and varied learning,\u2014combining the wisdom of the East and the West,\u2014in translating and annotating the *Ain-i-Akbari*, volumes II and III. He had to translate a very difficult book from a few badly transcribed and unhelpful texts, and to throw light on a wide range of technical subjects current in the middle ages but now obscure.\n\nAs will be seen, I have ventured to differ from him and given my own version in only four cases of importance,\u2014viz., the trick for curing gluttony (p. 432 of this edition), Alexander's stratagem against Porus (p. 440), the benefits of hunting (p. 451), and Akbar's principles of marriage (p. 449); the remaining examples of change are mostly verbal. In all other places the changes made in the present edition consist merely of the omission of obsolete or useless notes, the compression of prolix or partly irrelevant ones, and the modernisation of the information in all the notes that remain. Jones's translation of the *Hitopadesa* (p. 438, note 11), has been corrected as he had dropped the word *iba* (=as if) of the original Sanskrit verse. The next most noticeable difference in this edition is the omission of all Greek extracts and literary quotations from Latin. This change has been rendered necessary by the difference between the class of readers whom Jarrett had in view in 1890* and those who will mostly consult this second edition of 1947. The present conditions of paper supply and printing in Calcutta\n\n---\n\n* On p. 54 of his edition, Jarrett, in referring to the holy city of Medinah, distinguished it not by the English epithet of the \"best known\", nor by the French phrase *par excellence*, but by a Greek phrase meaning the same thing and printed in Greek type!\nmade such compression and omission necessary, if this edition was to be printed at all.\n\nAbul Fazl, unlike Al Biruni, admittedly had no personal knowledge of the Greek and Sanskrit languages. Therefore, with Sachau's English version of Al Biruni in our hands, we do not require the detailed correction or amplification of Abul Fazl's notes on Indian science and philosophy down to the time of Al Biruni, where the ground is better covered by that greater scholar. The real value of the Ain-i-Akbari lies in what it tells us about India under Muslim rule after Al Biruni's time (c. 1020 A.D.) and the much ampler details about Hindu philosophy and manners that Abul Fazl derived from the pandits engaged for his \"Imperial Gazetteer\" by order of Akbar. This latter portion alone has been fully annotated in the present edition.\n\nThe considerable amount of space saved by the rejection of hundreds of useless notes and the compression of many others of the first edition, has been put to a better use by employing a larger type and clearer spacing. This is of a special value in a book bristling with oriental proper names and technical terms. The reader of this new edition will, I hope, also appreciate the help that I have tried to provide for him by dividing the book into numbered chapters and sections, and adding descriptive section headings and summaries of contents, in imitation of the device employed in Professor Cornford's recent translation of Plato's Republic, which has been highly commended in England.\n\nThe elaborate system of transliteration at present followed by the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal in its Journal, could not be observed in this edition for three reasons: (1) The Society has changed its system several times during the last sixty years, so that no particular method can be rightly regarded as definite and final. In the case of a long volume in the Bibliotheca Indica series which has been issued in periodical fasciculi and completed after many years, (such as Beveridge's translation of the Akbarnamah), two different methods of romanising Oriental words are found in the earlier and latter parts of the same book!\n\n(2) Jarrett has not been uniform in his system of transliteration in this volume and his system (or systems) are not the one ruling in the Society at present. He represents kaf-i-qalmun sometimes by k with a dot below it, and sometimes by q. His 'ain is a with a dot below it, and his hamza is a with an inverted comma, and so\non. If we had to follow the latest system of romanisation throughout this second edition, the press-copy prepared from the printed first edition would have been scrapped up and the whole book typed again and the typescript collated with infinite labour. Hence, too, certain breaches of uniformity on some pages.\n\n(3) Only two presses here possess all the diacritical marks, and they can use them only in hand setting up, while linotype composition was considered necessary for this edition. To get over this difficulty, I have been compelled to follow a simple and practical method of romanising, using only two diacritical marks, namely \u0101 for the long vowel and an inverted comma to mark 'ain, while the two k\u0101fs have been represented by q and k respectively. But no distinction could be made between the two t's, the two h's, the three s's, and the four z's of the Arabic alphabet; nor has the underlining and underdotting of letters been possible. As this is not a book on Arabic philology, the general reader will hardly feel any loss from the absence of the host of diacritical marks, while the learned will be easily able to trace the Persian (or Sanskrit) equivalents of the words in question, as they are mostly well-known.\n\nThe index has been prepared by Prof. N. B. Roy. Instead of giving merely the names of places and persons or oriental terms without any explanation as in the index of the 1st edition, he has tried to help the reader by inserting the positions of places and the English renderings of most of the oriental words, besides plenty of cross references (e.g., Yajna and Sacrifice, Jyotisha and Astronomy, &c.) In order to save paper the obscure place and personal names which occur only once in the book have been omitted in my index. For the same reason, only the significant portions of Jarrett\u2019s preface to the third volume are reprinted below.\n\nDec. 1947.\n\nJADUNATH SARKAR.\n\nABUL FAZL AND AL BIRUNI COMPARED\u2014THE GREAT MERITS OF THE Ain-i-Akbari.\n\nThe range and diversity of its subjects (i.e., of the Ain-i-Akbari) and the untiring industry which collected and marshalled, through the medium of an unfamiliar language, the many topics of information to their minutest details, treating of abstruse sciences, subtile philosophical problems, and the customs, social, political and religious of a different race and creed, will stand as an enduring\nmonument of his learned and patient diligence... Though there is much to be desired, his comprehensive and admirable survey yet merits the highest praise...\n\nHe laboured under the disadvantage of unfamiliarity with Sanskrit, and he had to take the statements of his Pandits tested through translations at second-hand. He found his Hindu informants, as he says, of a retrograde tendency, spinning like silk worms, a tissue round themselves, immeshed in their own opinions, conceding the attainment of truth to no other, while artfully insinuating their own views, till the difficulty of arriving at any correct exposition of their system left him in a bewilderment of despair. His description of the nine Schools of Philosophy has the merit of being, as far as it goes, scrupulously precise...\n\nAfter a careful study of both these authors (Al Biruni and Abul Fazl), I am the more convinced that Abul Fazl borrowed the idea and arrangement of his work from his great predecessor. I have shown in his account of the Sark\u0101r of K\u0101bul instances of direct plagiarism from the Memoirs of Baber, and in his lives of Moslem Saints in the third Volume, verbatim extracts without acknowledgment from the Sufic hagiography of J\u0101mi'. The same volume displays other examples suggestive rather than definite, of his indebtedness to an author whom he never names. The difference between the two men in this particular is most remarkable. Al Biruni's reading was far more extensive and scholarly. The Sanskrit sources of his chapters are almost always given, and Sachau's preface has a list of the many authors quoted by him on astronomy, chronology, geography, and astrology. He was also acquainted with Greek literature through Arabic translations, and in comparing its language and thought and those of Hindu metaphysics, selects his quotations from the Timaeus and its commentator the Neo-Platonist Proclus, with judgment and rare ability. And he rarely fails to record his authorities. With Abul Fazl it is the reverse. He rarely names them, and borrows from every side without scruple as without avowal. The difference in the manner of the two authors is not less conspicuous. Al Biruni quotes freely from his authorities, and where these seem to exaggerate or to be inaccurate, his citations are followed by some sharp brief commentary which gives a ceaseless interest to his pages...\n\nHis treatment of these topics is throughout scholarly, showing extensive reading and precision of thought acquired by a study of\nthe exact sciences. Abul Fazl, on the contrary, transcribes either from existing works or from oral communication. His compilation is extremely careful and carried out with the most laborious and marvellous exactitude, but it is unenlivened by those masterly criticisms which give Al Biruni his unique position among Eastern writers...\n\nWhen all is said, however, which a strict impartiality must weight in counterpoise to Abul Fazl's sterling merits, there remains ample justification for the high place held by this great work in the West as well as the East, and as a record of the extension of the Mughal empire of India under the greatest of its monarchs and the ability with which it was administered, it must always remain of permanent and fascinating interest. It crystallizes and records in brief, for all time, the state of Hindu learning, and besides its statistical utility, serves as an admirable treatise of reference on numerous branches of Brahmanical science and on the manners, beliefs, traditions, and indigenous lore, which for the most part still retain and will long continue their hold on the popular mind. Above all, as a register of the fiscal areas, the revenue settlements and changes introduced at various periods, the harvest returns, valuations and imposts throughout the provinces of the empire, its originality is as indisputable as its surpassing historical importance. The concluding account of the author and his family and the persecutions to which they were subjected will, perhaps, be read with as much interest as any other portion of the work.\n\nH. S. Jarrett.\n\nCalcutta, 17th May, 1894.\nETHNOGRAPHY OF HINDUSTAN\n\nPREFATORY REMARKS\n\n[The author's object in writing this account is to show that the Hindu religion has true and sublime conceptions of the Deity.]\n\n[P. 1] It has long been the ambitious desire of my heart to pass in review to some extent, the general conditions of this vast country, and to record the opinions professed by the majority of the learned among the Hindus. I know not whether the love of my native land has been the attracting influence or exactness of historical research and genuine truthfulness of narrative, for Ban\u0101k\u012bti, H\u0101fiz Abru and other ancient chroniclers have indulged in vain imaginings and recorded stories that have no foundation in fact. Nor were the motives altogether these, but rather that when I had arisen from the close retirement of studious application and discovered somewhat of the ignorance and dissensions of men I formed the design of establishing peace and promoting concord. My original desire now renewed its possession of me, but a multiplicity of occupations prevented its gratification until the turns of fate brought about the composition of this striking record which has already branched out into such numerous details. Although my pen had occupied itself with the description of the Subahs and had briefly recorded the annals of Hindustan, and now that the ambition of my heart had attained the time of its realisation, not content with [P. 2] the information I had already acquired, I had recourse to the knowledge of others and set myself to gather instruction from men of true learning. As I was unfamiliar with the science of terms in the Sanskrit language and a competent interpreter was not available, the labour of repeated translations had to be undertaken, until by good fortune and my own steadfastness of purpose, my object was at length\nattained. It then became clear that the commonly received opinion that Hindus associate a plurality of gods with the One Supreme Being has not the full illumination of truth, for although with regard to some points and certain conclusions, there is room for controversy, yet the worship of one God and the profession of His Unity among this people appeared facts convincingly attested.\\(^1\\) It was indispensable in me, therefore, to bring into open evidence the system of philosophy, the degrees of self-discipline, and the gradations of rite and usage of this race in order that hostility towards them might abate and the temporal sword be stayed awhile from the shedding of blood, that dissensions within and without be turned to peace and the thornbrake of strife and enmity bloom into a garden of concord. Assemblies for the discussion of arguments might then be formed and gatherings of science suitably convened.\n\n[The various causes of misunderstanding and quarrels between different religions in India.]\n\nNotwithstanding that at all periods of time, excellent resolutions and well-intentioned designs are to be witnessed and the extent of the world is never lacking in prudent men, why does misunderstanding arise and what are the causes of contention?\n\n\\(^1\\) This is confirmed by Colebrooke. \"The real doctrine of the Indian Scripture is the unity of the Deity, in whom the universe is comprehended; and the seeming polytheism which it exhibits, offers the elements and the stars and planets as gods. The three principal manifestations of the divinity, with other personified attributes and most of the other gods of Hindu mythology, are indicated in the Veda. But the worship of deified heroes is no part of the system: nor are the incarnations of deities suggested in any portion of the text which I have yet seen, though such are sometimes hinted at by commentators.\" H. H. Wilson in commenting on this passage admits that the worship of the Vedas is for the most part domestic, addressed to unreal presences and not to visible types, and not idolatry. Vishnu. P. Pref. ii. [H. S. J.] See also Max Muller on henothemism, and Hastings, Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion, vi. 283 and 289; viii. 810-811. [J. Sarkar.]\nThe First cause is the diversity of tongues and the misapprehension of mutual purposes, and thus the alloy of ill-will is introduced and the dust of discord arises.\n\nSecondly, the distance that separates the learned of Hindustan from scientific men of other nationalities who thus are unable to meet, and if chance should bring them together, the need of an interpreter would preclude any practical result. An accomplished linguist capable of mastering the intricacies of science and the abstruse speculations of philosophy among various nations and competent to give them luminous and efficient expression, is very rare. Even at the present time, when through His Majesty's patronage of learning and his appreciation of merit, the erudite of all countries are assembled, and apply themselves with united effort in the pursuit of truth, so proficient a person is not to be found. Such as thirst after the sweet waters of wisdom and who leaving their native land undertake the wanderings of travel and with diligent assiduity employ their energies in the acquisition of various languages, are indeed uncommon.\n\nIt needs a seeker such as Anushirw\u0101n, who amidst the pomp of empire should yet search for the jewel of wisdom, and a minister like Buzurjmihr, void of envy, as his counsellor, and both king and minister combined, to discover a coadjutor so unique and one so upright and intelligent as the physician Barzawaih, and then to send him with abundant means disguised as a merchant to Hindustan in order that with this capital stock-in-trade he might obtain the interest of acquired wisdom; and again this sagacious personage, making no distinction between the absence or presence of his employers, must be diligent in his inquiries and succeed in the accomplishment of his desire through the frankness of his demeanour and his largesse of gold. Or the occasion would demand an indefatigable and lofty intellect like that of Tumtum the Indian, who to receive the instruction of the divine philosopher Plato, passed from Hindustan into Greece and freighting\nhis caravans with the requisites of travel, set himself to face the dangers of seas and deserts, and with the medicinal simples of wisdom perfected his spiritual health and the harmonious [P. 3] balance of his soul. Or a powerful mind and vigorous body such as Abu Maashar of Balkh, enamoured of wisdom, who holding exile and his native country and toil and ease undissociated, travelled into India from Khor\u0101s\u0101n and garnered a store of knowledge at Benares and carried it as a gift of price to the learned of his own land.\n\nThirdly, the absorption of mankind in the delights of corporeal gratification, for men regard the absence of beauty in an object as placing it beyond the pale of existence and therefore not to be thought of as worth acquisition or productive of enjoyment. Their fastidiousness is averse from listening to accounts of foreign peoples even by way of apologue. And forasmuch as their moral obliquity refuses to lend an ear and the glitter of this deceptive world lets fall a veil of ignorance before their eyes, what must be their state and how may grace illumine for them the lamp of guidance?\n\nFourthly, indolence. Men account what is ready to hand as more precious than the chance of future possession and prefer ease to exertion. They will not undertake the trouble of profound investigation, and content with a superficial view, will not move a span\u2019s length to acquire a deeper insight. He alone is the true promoter of wisdom who, setting before his resolve the investigation of the concealed beauties of meaning, under the guidance of assiduous research and undaunted desire, plants his foot in the dread wilds of research, and reaches the goal of his ambition undismayed by countless labours, sustaining the burden of the road by the force of capacity on the shoulders of his ever resolute will.\n\nFifthly, the blowing of the chill blast of inflexible custom and the low flicker of the lamp of wisdom. From immemorial time the exercise of inquiry has been restricted, and questioning and investigation have been regarded as precursors\nof infidelity. Whatever has been received from father, director, kindred, friend or neighbour, is considered as a deposit under Divine sanction and a malcontent is reproached with impiety or irreligion. Although the few among the intelligent of their generation admit the imbecility of this procedure in others, yet will they not stir one step in a practical direction themselves.\n\n[It is only by meeting on a common platform of study and discussion that different religions can be correctly understood and their true worth appreciated. This book will promote that aim.]\n\nSixthly, the uprising of the whirlwind of animosity and the storms of persecution have stayed the few earnest inquirers from uniting to discuss their individual tenets and from meeting in friendly assemblies in a spirit of sympathy, and from distinguishing commonalty of bond from vital estrangement, under the guidance of impartiality, in order that error may be severed from truth and the why and the wherefore weighed in the scales of sound judgment. Even just monarchs, unconscious of their obligations, have herein neglected them. Arrogance and self-interest have intervened and occasions of intercourse have been marred by perplexities. Some have taken refuge in silence; others have found evasion in obscurity of language, while others again have extricated themselves by time-serving utterances. If temporal rulers had interested themselves in this matter and assuaged the apprehensions of men, assuredly many enlightened persons would have delivered their real sentiments with calmness of mind and freedom of expression. Through the apathy of princes, each sect is bigoted to its own creed and dissensions [P. 4] have waxed high. Each one regarding his own persuasion as alone true, has set himself to the persecution of\n\n---\n\n2 I select a variant relegated to the notes, in place of the text, and amend the doubtful reading that follows by omitting the be before \u0101z\u0101ram. With this alteration the difficulty is cleared and its simplicity recommends the correction.\nother worshippers of God, and the shedding of blood and the ruining of reputation have become symbols of religious orthodoxy. Were the eyes of the mind possessed of true vision, each individual would withdraw from this indiscriminating turmoil and attend rather to his own solicitudes than interfere in the concerns of others. Amidst such unseemly discord, main purposes are set aside and arguments disregarded. If the doctrine of an enemy be in itself good, why should hands be stained in the blood of its professors? And even were it otherwise, the sufferer from the malady of folly deserves commiseration, not hostility and the shedding of his blood.\n\nSeventhly, the prosperity of wretches without principle who deceitfully win acceptance by affected virtue and rectitude. Such as these do much harm and truths are obscured through unrecognition.\n\nCease, Abul Fazal, cease! The manifestations of divine wrath are illimitable and infinite are the marvels of their record. Loose not thy hand from the cord of peace seized by thy good intention. Follow out thy long projected design. Though some of thy hearers will attain to wisdom and meet in rejoicing union, yet many will fall into sorrows and reap bewilderment. Thanks be to God that thou art not a hostage to the lament of ignorance nor the extoller of those that are in bonds.\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE BOUNDARIES OF HINDUSTAN AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION THEREOF.\n\nINDIA\u2014ITS BOUNDARIES, SEASONS, NATURAL BEAUTY, AND CROPS\n\nHindustan is described as enclosed on the east, west and south by the ocean, but Ceylon, Achin, the Moluccas, Malacca and a considerable number of islands are accounted within its extent. To the north is a lofty range of mountains, part of which stretches along the uttermost limits of Hindustan, and its other extremity passes into Turkestan and Persia. An intermediate region lies between this and the vast frontiers\\(^1\\) of China, inhabited by various races, such as Kashmir, Great and Little Tibet, Kisht\u0101war and others. This quarter may therefore be likened to another ocean. With all its magnitude of extent and the mightiness of its empire it is unequalled in its climate, its rapid succession of harvests and the equable temperament of its people. Notwithstanding its vast size, it is cultivated throughout. You cannot accomplish a stage nor indeed travel a \\(k\\)os without-meeting with populous towns and flourishing villages, nor without being gladdened by the sight of sweet waters, delightful verdure and enchanting downs. In the autumn and throughout the depth of winter the plains are green and the trees in foliage. During the rainy season which extends from the close of the Sun\u2019s stay in Gemini to his entry into the sign of Virgo\\(^2\\), the elasticity of the atmosphere is enough to transport the most dispirited and lend the vigour of youth to old age. Shall I praise the refulgence of its skies or the marvellous fertility of its soil?\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit., Chin and M\u0101chin, feigned or believed by Orientals to be the descendants of Japhet and applied by metonymy to express the full extent of the Chinese dominions.\n\n\\(^2\\) Middle of June to end of August.\n[Noble character of the people of India, monotheism the universal root of their religious belief, while their image-worship is not idolatry, but an \"aid to fixing the mind and keeping the thoughts from wandering\".]\n\nShall I describe the constancy of its inhabitants or record their benevolence of mind? Shall I portray the beauty that charms the heart or sing of purity unstained? Shall I tell of heroic valour or weave romances of their vivacity of intellect and their lore? The inhabitants of this land are religious, affectionate, hospitable, genial and frank. They are fond of scientific pursuits, inclined to austerity of life, seekers after justice, contented, industrious, capable in affairs, loyal, truthful and constant. The true worth of this people shines most in the day of adversity and its soldiers know not retreat from the field. When the day is doubtful, they dismount from their steeds and resolutely put their lives to hazard, accounting the dishonour of flight more terrible than death, while some even disable their horses before entering the fight.\n\nThey are capable of mastering the difficulties of any subject in a short space of time and surpass their instructors, and to win the Divine favour they will spend body and soul and joyfully devote their lives thereunto. They one-and all believe in the unity of God, and as to the reverence they pay to images of stone and wood and the like, which simpletons regard as idolatry, it is not so. The writer of these pages has exhaustively discussed the subject with many enlightened and upright men, and it became evident that these images of some chosen souls nearest in approach to the throne of God, are fashioned as aids to fix the mind and keep the thoughts from wandering, while the worship of God alone is required as indispensable. In all their ceremonial observances and usage they ever implore the favour of the world-illumining sun and regard the pure essence of the Supreme Being as transcending the idea of power in operation.\nBrahm\u0101, of whom mention was formerly made, they hold to be the Creator; Vishnu, the Nourisher and Preserver; and Rudra, called also Mah\u0101deva, the Destroyer. Some maintain that God who is without equal, manifested himself under these three divine forms, without thereby sullying the garment of His inviolate sanctity, as the Nazarenes hold of the Messiah. Others assert that these were human creatures exalted to these dignities through perfectness of worship, probity of thought and righteousness of deed. The godliness and self-discipline of this people is such as is rarely to be found in other lands.\n\nThey hold that the world had a beginning, and some are of opinion that it will have an end, as will be mentioned hereafter.\n\nAn astonishing circumstance is this, that if an alien wishes to enter the Brahman caste, they would not accept him, and were one of these to adopt another religion and subsequently desire to revert to his own, he would not be suffered so to do save in case of his apostasy under compulsion. They have no slaves. When they go forth to battle or during an attack by an enemy, they collect all their women in one building, and surround it with wood and straw and oil, and place on guard some trusty relentless men, who set fire to it when those engaged in fight despair of life, and these chaste women vigilant of their honour are consumed to death with unflinching courage.\n\nIn times of distress, moreover, should any one, though unconnected by ties of intimacy, implore their protection, they are prompt to aid and grudge neither property, life nor reputation in his cause.\n\n---\n\n3 The same things were observed by the Chinese pilgrim Yuan Chwang in the 7th century: \"The ordinary people, although they are naturally light-minded, yet they are upright and honourable... They are faithful to their oaths and promises... In their behaviour there is much gentleness and sweetness.\" (Beal, i. 83.) And of the Marathas: \"The disposition of the people is honest and\nIt was also the custom in former times for each warrior in battle to challenge a foe and to encounter none other than him. [P. 6]\n\n[The Soil and its Produce\u2014Arts and Crafts of the People of Hindustan.]\n\nThe soil is for the most part arable and of such productive power that the same land is sown each year and in many places three harvests and more are taken in a single twelve-month and the vine bears fruit in its first year.\n\nMines of diamond, ruby, gold, silver, copper, lead and iron abound. The variety of its fruits and flowers proclaim its luxuriance. Its perfumes and melodies, its viands and raiment are choice and in profusion. Its elephants cannot be sufficiently praised, and in parts of the country the horses resemble Arabs in breed and the cattle are uncommonly fine. But for its lack of cooled water, its excessive heats, the scarcity of grapes, melons and carpets, and of camels, it was open to the cavils of the experienced. His Majesty has remedied these deficiencies. Saltpetre is now extensively used for its cooling properties, and high and low appreciate the benefit of snow and ice brought down from the northern mountains. There is a slender fragrant root called khas (the odoriferous grass *Andropogon Muricatum*) of which, under His Majesty's instructions, the fashion of constructing trellised chambers has come into vogue, and upon this if water be sprinkled, another winter arises amid the summer heats. Skilled hands from Turkestan and Persia under His Majesty's patronage, sowed melons and planted vines, and traders began to introduce in security the fruits of those countries, each in its season and with attention to their quality, which occasioned an abundance here when they were not procurable in their own. Through the favour of His Majesty, all\n\nsimple; . . . to their benefactors they are grateful; to their enemies relentless.

It will be sufficient to mention three of them. The first is that God who has no equal, taking upon himself the form of man appeared under the special manifestation called Brahma already alluded to, and by his mere volition produced four sons, Sanak, Sanandan, San\u0101tan, and Sanatkum\u0101r. Each of these was commanded to engage in acts of creation, but lost in rapture of contemplation in the divine essence they neglected to comply. In anger, the Supreme being formed another design and came forth from his own forehead under another semblance and name as Mah\u0101deva. His sublime immensity unfitted him for creative action. Ten other sons issued from his volition and then from his body he fashioned the forms of male and female. The former was called Manu and the latter Sata-rup\u0101. These two are the progenitors of mankind. [P. 7.]\n\n---\n\n4 The reference is to Babur, who writes in his memoirs: \"Hindustan is a country of few charms; there are no good horses, no good dogs, no grapes, musk-melons or first-rate fruits, no ice or cold water... There are no running waters in their gardens and residences.\" (Beveridge's tr. 518. J.S.)\n\n5 A variant has, \"two\".\u2014The text has incorrectly Satruka, for which error Abul Fazl is responsible. The Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a says that he divided his male being into eleven persons. Next he created himself the Manu Swayambhuva and the female portion of himself he constituted Sata-rup\u0101 whom the Manu took to wife. There are also other complications of birth and intercourse which may be pursued by the curious in the Pur\u0101\u1e47a itself, p. 51 et seq.\nSecondly, it is maintained that God\\(^6\\) the Creator of the world, manifested himself under the form of a woman whom they call Mah\u0101-Lachhmi. Three qualities are incorporated with her, Satva, Raja and Tama. When she willed to create the world, through the instrumentality of Tama, she manifested herself under another form which is called Mah\u0101-K\u0101li and also Mah\u0101-M\u0101y\u0101. By her union with Satva, a further genesis proceeded called Saraswati, and at her command each brought forth a male and female and these two forms she herself inspired with life. Thus two beings were born of each. From Mah\u0101-Lachhmi sprung Brahma under the form of a man, and Sri under the guise of a woman who is also called S\u0101vitri. From Mah\u0101-K\u0101li, were brought forth Mah\u0101-deva and Tri the latter of whom is also distinguished as Mah\u0101-bidya and K\u0101mdhenu, and from Saraswati came forth Vishnu and Gauri. When these six forms took birth, Mah\u0101-Lachhmi proceeded to their conjugal union, and joined Brahma with Tri, Gauri with Mah\u0101-deva, and Sri with Vishnu. The conjunction of Brahma and Tri produced an egg\\(^7\\) which Mah\u0101-deva divided into two parts, from one of which originated the devat\u0101s, daityas and the like super-\n\n---\n\n\\(^6\\) Hari, the lord of all, called also Jan\u0101rdana (from Jana, \"men\" and Arddana, \"worship\"\u2014\"the object of adoration to mankind\"). He is the one only God, taking the designation of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, according as he creates, preserves or destroys:\u2014This is the invariable doctrine of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. See Wilson, Vishnu, P. p. 19.\n\nThe three qualities or attributes are shared by the Hindu Triad; Brahma being the embodiment of Raja-guna, the desire that created the world; Siva that of Tama-guna, the attribute of wrath; and Vishnu is Satwa-guna or the property of mercy and goodness.\n\n\\(^7\\) The Brahmand or egg of Brahma is applied by Albiruni to the whole ether on account of its supposed spherical shape and its division into upper and lower and he says that when the Hindus enumerate the heavens they call them in their entirety, Brahmand.\n\n[The latest and best account of Hindu Cosmogony and Cosmology is the one by H. Jacobi in Hastings's Encyclo. of Religion, iv. 155-160. Var\u0101ha-Mihir the author of Surya-Siddh\u0101nta, died in 587 A.D. The old notes of Jarrett based on Bentley have been omitted here. J. S.]\nnatural beings; from the other, men, animals, and the vegetable and mineral worlds.\n\nThe Third opinion is accounted the most authentic. In the work called *Surya-Siddh\u0101nta* composed some hundreds of thousands of years ago, it is circumstantially related that towards the end of the *Satya-yuga*, flourished the great Demon Maya. That sage was lost in astonishment at the wonders of creation, and confounded by his own ignorance, applied himself to a supplication of the Sun to discover the mode in which creation was effected and passed some thousands of years in these entreaties and desires. After he had undergone surpassing trials, that bestower of radiance on the heavens and the earth appeared to him under a beautiful form and asked him what he desired. He said, \"Draw back the veil from the marvels of the stars and the skies and from the mysteries of wisdom and illuminate the darkness of my understanding with the light of knowledge.\" It was answered: \"Thy desire shall be granted. In a certain shrine unite in spirit with me and a celestial being shall appear and instruct you in wisdom.\" The seeker was comforted. He waited in expectation at the shrine appointed and near the close of the *Satya-yuga*, the giver of his desire appeared. The sage entered into much questioning regarding the mysteries of heaven and earth and received replies that satisfied him. [8]. The questions and answers were compiled in one volume under the name of the *Surya Siddh\u0101nta*, and to this day the astronomy, of entire Hindust\u0101n is based upon it. In this work the origin of creation is said to be from the Sun, which is regarded as a divine manifestation. The Almighty Creator of the world formed a hollow sphere of gold composed of two parts which he rendered luminous with somewhat of His own glory and it was called the Sun. The Sun produced the signs of the Zodiac and from the same source sprung the four *Vedas*, and afterwards the moon, the ethereal fluid, air, fire, water and earth, in this order. From\nthe ether he produced Jupiter; from the air, Saturn; from fire, Mars; from water, Venus; and from the earth, Mercury. Through the ten portals of the human frame-work he brought various matter into being. The ten portals are thus numbered: the two eyes, the two ears, the nose, the mouth, the navel, the anterior and posterior foramina, and the tenth, the crown of the head, which last is closed. It opens, however, at the time of death in some of those who are about to quit life and body, and this is considered singularly auspicious. His Majesty has increased the number of portals by the two breasts, and counts the number as twelve. After a long course the human race became of four kinds as shall be presently related.\n\nON THE INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR COSMIC PHENOMENA.\n\nThe Hindu philosophers maintain that the elements have a spherical form\\(^8\\) and they have added Ether to the number. They hold it to pervade all things and that no space is void of it. They do not incline to the notion of a celestial substance (\\(\u0101sm\u0101n\\)) but adopt the account of the spheres on the system of the Almagest of Ptolemy.\\(^9\\) The Zodiac is divided into twelve signs, each of which is termed \"r\u0101s.\"\n\nThey are as follows:\n\n1. Mesha.\n2. Vrisha.\n3. Mithuna.\n4. Karkata.\n\n1. Aries.\n2. Taurus.\n3. Gemini.\n4. Cancer.\n\n\\(^8\\) The authorities for this are Arya-bhata, Vasistha and L\u0101\u1e6da. Albiruni, 26.\n\nEther is so called by the Greeks from its being in perpetual flow. Arist., De C\u00e6lo, iii.\n\n\\(^9\\) Ptolemy's first book of the Almagest treats among other matters of the spherical form and motion of the heavens, the spherical form of the earth and its location in the centre of the heavens and of the two circular celestial motions which all the stars have in common.\n5.

It is not compounded of bodies variously organised, neither is it affected by heat, cold, moisture, nor dryness, nor can lightness or gravity be predicated of it.\\([9]\\) It possesses life and continuity of existence, and is not subject to desire or anger. It is called \"asman.\"\\(^{11}\\) The general opinion is that the Universe (to p\u0101n) includes nine spheres, but some think eight, others, eleven,\n\n\\(^{10}\\) Capricornus was represented on ancient monuments with the fore part of a goat and the hind part of a fish. The Hindu Makara, according to the Sanskrit verses of Sripati, quoted by Sir W. Jones, (I, 336) is a sea-monster with the face of an antelope. The question at once presents itself as to the relative antiquity of the Greek and Indian Zodiacial signs. [H. S. J.] On the relation between Greek and Hindu astronomy, see Kaye in J.R.A.S., 1910, p. 759 and J.A.S.B., 1911, p. 813, and the volume on Astronomy in the Grundriss. The relation between Hindu and Arab astronomy is best described briefly in Hastings, Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion, xii. 95, the writer of which article has treated the same subject again in Ency. Islam, i. 497-502. [J. S.]\n\n\\(^{11}\\) These are the attributes of the Pradh\u0101na, (chief principle or primary crude matter) ascribed to it by the Sankhya philosophy. It is independent and co-ordinate with primary spirit. See Vishnu P, p. 9 et seq. The greater part of this passage is almost identical with the description of the word, falk, the Arabic equivalent of \u0101sm\u0101n, in the Istil\u0101h\u0101t u'l Funun, pp. 1134-5 quoted from the Hid\u0101yat u'l \u1e24ikmat (Institutus philosophiae recta) of Maibudi. I have not been able to trace the passage in the latter work verbatim, but in scattered references only. The notion is taken from Aristotle, De C\u00e6lo, iii.\nothers, seven, and it is even affirmed that there is but a single Kosmos.\n\nThe Hindu philosophers acknowledge the existence of the planets and fixed stars, but assert that their substance is of water\\textsuperscript{12} congealed like hail, and that they receive their light from the sun. Others maintain that it is from the moon, and that these luminous bodies dominate the aspects of fortune. They also hold the connection of a celestial spirit with each. Some suppose the stars to be human beings, who by suppressing the emotions of anger and desire, and by mortification and moral beauty of life, have reached this exalted eminence.\n\n**Names of the Planets\\textsuperscript{13} and the Days of the Week.**\n\nSanichar is Saturn (Saturday). Brihaspati is Jupiter (Thursday). Mangal is Mars (Tuesday). Aditya, the Sun (Sunday). The Hindus have more than a thousand names for the sun. His Majesty knows by heart the whole of these and uses them in his prayers, but the name Suraj is the one in common use among all classes. Sukra is Venus (Friday). Budh is Mercury (Wednesday). Soma is the Moon (Monday).\n\n---\n\n\\textsuperscript{12} Albiruni mentions this in his LV Chap. \"The Hindus believe regarding the bodies of all the stars that they have a globular shape, a watery essence, and that they do not shine, whilst the sun alone is of fiery essence, self-shining and per accidens illuminates other stars when they stand opposite to him. They reckon according to eyesight among the stars also, such luminous bodies as in reality are not stars, but the lights into which those men have been metamorphosed who have received eternal reward from God. The Vishnu-Dharma says: 'The stars are watery and the rays of the sun illuminate them in the night. Those who by their pious deeds have obtained a place on the height, sit there on their thrones, and when shining, they are reckoned among the stars!' Sachau's Trans. II, 64.\n\n\\textsuperscript{13} The 19th Chap. of Albiruni's India begins with the same subject and the similarity of treatment and expression, though not of the order, is so striking that, as I have before had occasion to observe, there is little doubt of Abul Fazl's indebtedness to this author. Albiruni's handling of any subject he discusses is that of a philosopher who is master of it; Abul Fazl is purely the compiler and scribe.\nEach of these planets has several names, and each day of the week has a special connection with and is named after its planet, with the addition of the word 'w\u0101r.' Thus, Sunday which begins the week is called *Aditya-w\u0101r*; Monday, *Soma-w\u0101r*; Tuesday, *Mangal-w\u0101r*; Wednesday, *Budh-w\u0101r*; Thursday, *Brihaspati-w\u0101r*; Friday, *Sukra-w\u0101r*; Saturday, *Sanichar-w\u0101r*.\n\n**The Institution of the Ghary\u0101l.**\n\nThis is a round gong of mixed metal,\\(^{14}\\) shaped like a griddle but thicker, made of different sizes; and suspended by a cord. It may not be sounded except by royal command, and accompanies the royal equipage.\n\nThe Hindu philosophers divide the day and night into four parts, each of which they call *pahr*. Throughout the greater part of the country, the *pahr* never exceeds nine *gharis* nor is less than six. The *ghari* is the sixtieth part of a nychthemeron, and is divided into sixty parts, each of which is called a *pal* which is again subdivided into sixty *bipal*.\n\nIn order to ascertain and indicate the time, a vessel of copper or other metal is made of a hundred *t\u0101nks*, weight. In Persian it is called *ping\u0101n*, as an ancient sage sings,\n\n[10] Why reck\u2019st thou of a world whose span  \nA clepsydra doth mete to man?\\(^{15}\\)\n\n\\(^{14}\\) Lit. *Haft-josh*, a metal compounded of iron, antimony, lead, gold, tin, copper and silver. The ordinary bell-metal is an alloy of 80 parts of copper and 20 of tin, though some English bells have been found to consist of copper, tin, zinc and lead.\n\n\\(^{15}\\) These lines are from *Hadiqah* of Hakim San\u0101\u012b, p. 298, of the lithographed edition. The clepsydra was known in Greece in the time of Aristophanes and was used for regulating the time allowed for speeches of accused persons before courts of justice. But in this, the water was allowed to escape through the orifice of the vessel. (See Lewis' *Ast. of the Ancients*, p. 182.)\nIt is in the shape of a bowl narrower at the lower part, twelve fingers in height and breadth. A perforation is made below to admit of a golden tube being passed through of the weight of one M\u0101sh\u0101, and in length the breadth of five fingers. It is placed in a basin of pure water in a place undisturbed by the wind. When the bowl is full of water, one ghari is elapsed,\\(^{15a}\\) and in order that this should be known to far and near, the gong is struck once, and for the second time, twice, and so on. When a pahr has elapsed, the number of gharis expired therein is first sounded and then more deliberately from one to four (according to the pahr), thus announcing the pahr struck. Thus when it is two pahr, (twelve o\u2019clock), the gong is struck twenty-sixth times, taking the pahr at eight gharis. The Emperor Baber in his Memoirs writes: \u201cWhen at the end of a pahr a certain number of gharis had elapsed, this number was sounded while the pahr just expired was unknown. I ordered that the number of the pahr should be repeated after a brief interval.\u201d The Hindu philosophers account 360 breathings of a man in good health as a ghari of time, and each is formed of six inspirations and respirations, of which 21,600 are drawn in the course of a nychthemeron.\n\n\\(^{15a}\\) The Hindu hour-glass is thus described in the Surya Siddh\u0101nta, Chap. XIII. \u201cThe copper vessel (in the shape of the lower half of a water jar) which has a small hole in its bottom and placed upon clean water in a basin, sinks exactly sixty times in a nychthemeron, is called the Kap\u0101la Yantra. In the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, p. 631, it is said to be \u201ca vessel made of 12\u00bd Palas of copper, in the bottom of which there is to be a hole made with a tube of gold, of the weight of 4 M\u0101shas and 4 inches long.\u201d A commentary is more explicit. \u201cA vessel made of 12\u00bd Palas of copper, and holding a Prastha, (a Magadha measure) of water, broad at top and having at bottom a tube of gold of 4 M\u0101shas weight, 4 fingers long, is placed in water, and the time in which the vessel is filled by the hole in the bottom is a N\u0101dika.\u201d It is therefore clear that there must be a pipe of the metal and of the length given, and not a simple aperture only. See a paper on Horometry in the As. Res. V, 87.\nTHE ORDER OF THE SPHERES.\n\nThe first is the Earth, over which is Water, but not encompassing it entirely. Above this is Fire, towards its northern extremity shaped like a myrobalan. Above this again is the Air, but its concave surface is not spherical. The Air is of nine kinds. Bhuv\u0101yu, is the atmosphere extending up to the height of forty-seven kos from the globe of the earth. It is volatile in every direction and is the region wherein rain, thunder and lightning take their origin. Avaha is the air from the last-mentioned body to the moon. Pravaha, from the second to Mercury. Udvaha from the third to Venus. Samvaha, from the fourth to the Sun. Suvaha, from the fifth to Mars. Parivaha, from the sixth to Jupiter. Par\u0101vaha, from the seventh to Saturn. Pravah\u0101nila, from the eight to the fixed stars. Day and night are formed by the revolution of this wind, with a movement from east to west, the other seven winds reversing this order of motion.\\(^{16}\\) But their more authoritative opinion is that those seven form the Pravah\u0101nila, and are named after the seven planets and all revolve from east to west.\\(^{17}\\) Their knowledge does not extend beyond the fixed stars. Ether transcends all other spheres and is unfathomable.\n\n\\(^{16}\\) I am uncertain of this meaning. The elements in successive order are supposed to acquire the property of causality one to the other. The order in all the Pur\u0101nas but one is the same according to Wilson (Vish. P.), and agrees with the text. The seven winds occur in this order in the Siddh\u0101nta Siromani which adds; 'The atmosphere extends to the height of 12 yojanas from the earth. Within this limit are the clouds, lightning, &c. The Pravaha wind which is above the atmosphere moves constantly to the westward with uniform motion. As the sphere of the universe includes the fixed stars and planets, it therefore being impelled by the Pravaha wind is carried round with the stars and planets in a constant revolution,' Wilkinson's Translation, p. 127.\n\n\\(^{17}\\) Compare with this the direction of the planes of the winds and their names according to the Moslem theory, in Albiruni's Chronology of Anc. Nations, Sachau, p. 341. In Vol. I of his India, (p. 280 Sach.) Brahmagupta says 'The wind makes all the fixed stars and the planets revolve towards the W. in one and the same\nThe mean motions of the planets which they call *Madhyama* differ from the Greek reckoning in the seconds and thirds. Thus, in a nychthemeron [P. 11] extending from midnight to midnight, the Surya-Siddh\u0101nta gives the following calculations.\n\n|          | Degrees | Minutes | Seconds | Thirds |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Moon     | ...     | 13      | 10      | 34     | 53     |\n| Mercury  |         |         |         |        |        |\n| Venus    |         | 0       | 59      | 8      | 10     |\n| Sun      |         |         |         |        |        |\n| Mars     |         | 0       | 31      | 26     | 28     |\n| Jupiter  |         | 0       | 4       | 59     | 9      |\n| Saturn   |         | 0       | 2       | 0      | 23     |\n\nAccording to the Greeks.\n\n|          | Degrees | Minutes | Seconds | Thirds |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Moon     |         |         | 35      | 2      |\n| Mercury  |         |         |         |        |\n| Venus    |         |         |         | 19     |\n| Sun      |         |         |         |        |\n| Mars     |         |         | 27      | 40     |\n| Jupiter  |         |         |         | 16     |\n| Saturn   |         |         |         | 35     |\n\nrevolution, but the planets move also in a slow pace to the E. like a dust atom moving on a potter's wheel in a direction opposite to that in which the wheel is revolving.\" Albiruni considers their speaking of the wind as a *motor* is intended only to facilitate the idea to the vulgar comprehension, but when they come to speak of the *first-mover* (God) they at once lay aside comparison with the wind whose essence is not moving but is a body acted upon by external influence. According to the *Surya-Siddh\u0101nta* the rapid movement of the planets is caused by the wind *Pravaha*.\nThe motion of the Planets is considered of their essence and is of equal velocity in all. When calculated in kos their rate of motion is said to be 11,858 yojana\\(^{18}\\) and 3 kos in the space of a nychthemeron, and their direction is from west to east. The difference in their periods arises from the greater or less extent of their orbits, the superior being greater than those lower in position.\n\nThe progression of the fixed stars they consider to be somewhat similar to that of the planets, but differing from the Greeks, they assert that with regard to the Lunar stations, there is a motion of 54 seconds in one year, or one degree in 66 years and 8 months. They compute that the asterisms advance 27 degrees from the beginning of Aries, or according to another calculation, having advanced 24 degrees, they have a retrograde motion till they reach the 28th degree of Pisces whence they return to Aries, and the same movement re-commences.\\(^{19}\\) The Ursa Major which is called in Sanskrit Sapta-rishi (the seven Sages) has a precession in one year of 17 seconds, 47 thirds from west to east, or one degree in\n\n---\n\n\\(^{18}\\) A yojana is four kos. Albiruni in his India, Chap. XV, (Sach. I. 167) makes 1 krosa = 1 mile or 4,000 yards, and 1 yojana = 8 miles or kroh or 32,000 yards. Some, he adds, thinks that the krosa = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) farsakh, and so make the farsakh of the Hindus 16,000 yards, but this is not so, as this latter (farsakh) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) yojana. Sachau has made a slight oversight in this last passage by translating 1 krosa = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) yojana. But this cannot be as he already says above that 1 yojana = 8 krosa. The Farsakh is reckoned by Albiruni in his V Chap. as 3 miles, and = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) yojana which being reckoned above at 32,000 yards, gives the length of the farsakh necessarily at 16,000. But with this result he appears to quarrel.\n\n\\(^{19}\\) In the Surya-Siddhanta, the precession of the equinoxes is thus described: \"The circle of Asterisms librates 600 times in a great Yuga (that is, all the Asterisms at first move westward \\( 27^\\circ \\). Then returning from that limit they reach their former places. Then from those places they move eastward the same number of degrees, and returning thence come again to their own places. Thus they complete one libration or revolution as it is called). Bapu Deva. Burgess has a long note on this mode of statement in his translation, p. 100.\n200 years and 6 months, and accomplishes its revolution. One sect considers the operation of these forces to depend solely on the power of the Almighty.\n\nThe ancient Greeks, including Aristotle, were ignorant of the motion of the fixed stars and Hipparchus observed a few\\(^{20}\\) with a motion from east to west in the Zodiac, but he was unable to calculate their dimensions. Ptolemy determined the motion of the stars in longitude to be one degree in a hundred solar years. Ibn Aalam and others reckoned sixty. The observations of Nasir\u2019uddin Tusi agree with this last, but Muhyiddin Maghrabi\\(^{21}\\) and a number of experts at the same observatory discovered that Aldebaran, the Heart of Scorpio (\u03b1 Scorpii), and others, advanced a degree in 66 years. In the Gurg\u0101ni Tables (of Ulugh Beg) this is made to occur in 70 Yazdajirdi years, each of which is 365 years without a fraction.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{20}\\) M. Montulca observes that Hipparchus, according to Ptolemy, suspected that only the stars in the Zodiac or in its vicinity had been disturbed in position as if, being the nearest in some measure to the great route of the planets, they had been more exposed to share in their motion. But he soon discovered that the movement was general around the poles of the Zodiac, and he transmitted a large number of observations on the fixed stars for the use of his successors. They served to assure Ptolemy of the perfect immovability of the fixed stars with regard to each other and of the movement of the whole starry sphere around the poles of the Zodiac. Hist. des Math. 265, I.\n\n\\(^{21}\\) Called al Maghrabi from his residence in Spain and Africa. He was spared in the sack of Aleppo by Holagu and associated with Tusi at Mar\u0101gha in A. H. 658. He thus took part in forming the Ilkh\u0101ni Astronomical Tables. He had a wide reputation as a philosopher and mathematician. D\u2019Herb.\n\nPtolemy following the steps of Hipparchus, established conclusively his theory of the movement of the fixed stars. In comparing the longitudes of several of these with those found by Hipparchus, he showed that they had advanced parallel to the Ecliptic by \\(2^\\circ 40'\\) since his day and as 265 years had since then elapsed, he concluded the movement to be one degree in 100 years. The more exact calculation of modern days shows it to be one in 72. Hist. des Math.

They are also given in 12th chapter of the *Surya-Siddh\u0101nta* with some slight variation from the text.\n\n23 This sentence is not in two MSS. and as it stands, appears incomplete. The remaining terms of the proportional are missing, and are probably the number of *yojanas* of the diameters, to the *yojanas* of the circumferences. Thus the minutes of the diameter of the moon are to the minutes of her circumference, i.e., 21600, as the number of the *yojanas* of the diameter, i.e., 480, are to the *yojanas* of the circumference of her whole sphere, and in the same way with the Sun, as shewn by Albiruni, Chap.

It consists of 3 stars between the 21st and 22nd stations.' According to Albiruni, Abhijit is the Falling Eagle.

The details were the diameters and dimensions of the planets and their distances from the earth's centre in *farsakhs* and *yojanas* according to the Hindus, to Ptolemy and to modern astronomers, but as Albiruni observes, the Hindu astronomers themselves are not agreed in their computations. Pulisa reckons the diameter of the earth as 1,600 *yojanas*, and its circumference as $5026\\frac{14}{15}$, whilst Brahmagupta reckons the former at 1,581 and the latter at 5,000 *yojanas*. The table of Yaqub-b-T\u0101rik, will be found in Albiruni's *India*, Vol. II, p. 68.]\n\n**Magnitudes of the Fixed Stars.**\n\nThe Hindu philosophers reckon seven magnitudes as follows:\n\n| Magnitudes | Minutes | Seconds | Yojanas | Kos. | Dand. | Cubit. | Digit. |\n|------------|---------|---------|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Diameter of the 1st | 7 | 30 | 90,239 | 2 | 700 | ... | ... |\n| 2nd | 6 | 15 | 75,199 | 2 | 1,250 | ... | ... |\n| 3rd | 5 | 30 | 66,175 | 2 | 1,580 | ... | ... |\n| 4th | 4 | 0 | 48,127 | 3 | 238 | 2 | 2 |\n| 5th | 3 | 0 | 36,095 | 0 | 678 | 3 | 13 |\n| 6th | 2 | 0 | 24,063 | 3 | 1,119 | 1 | 1 |\n| 7th | 1 | 0 | 12,031 | 3 | 1,559 | 2 | 12 |\n\nThe Greeks mention six.

The intervals of the hexade were measured by sixths. Some supposed that a diameter of a star of the 1st magnitude was six times the diameter of the smallest; but a manifest error occurred in calculating the volumes and distances intervening, by concluding that the volume of a mean star of the 1st magnitude must therefore be six times larger than the volume of a star of the 6th magnitude. But Euclid has demonstrated in the last proposition of the 12th Book of the Elements, that circles are to one another as the squares on their diameters, that is, if the ratio of one diameter to another be one-half or less, there will be three times the ratio between the spheres. For instance, if the diameter of one sphere be half the diameter of another, the smaller sphere will be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of the larger; and if the diameter be \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), the smaller sphere will be \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{27} \\) of the larger, and so on. Therefore, if the case be as those have conjectured, the volume of a star of the 1st magnitude will be greater than that of one of the 6th by a very considerable difference.\n\nThe largest of the fixed stars that have been observed, is 222 times, and the smallest of them twenty-three times as large as the earth. From their multitude they cannot be numbered, but the position of 1022 has been fixed.\n\ndivision of each of the six classes of Hipparchus and Ptolemy into three subordinate groups: distinctions being drawn between the small, intermediate and large stars of the second magnitude.\n\nThis is the catalogue of Hipparchus which gives the longitudes and latitudes of the number described, by their position in the constellations as shown in the 8th book of the Almagest. Montucla observes that only 1,022 were observed, though there are a great many more, and some among them visible to the naked eye, but the number is far below what is vulgarly imagined. Hist. des Math. I, p. 295. I add on the authority of Humboldt. (Cosmos III, 143) that Pliny could count only 1,600 stars visible in the fine sky of Italy. In this enumeration he had descended to stars of the 5th, whilst half a century later Ptolemy indicated only 1,025 stars down to the 6th magnitude. The number of stars visible to the naked eye in the horizon of Berlin, Humboldt gives as 4,022 and in that of Alexandria 4,638.\nOf these\u2014\n\n15 are of the 1st Magnitude. 474 are of the 4th Magnitude.\n45 ,, ,, 2nd ,, 217 ,, ,, 5th ,,\n208 ,, ,, 3rd ,, 49 ,, ,, 6th ,,\n\nThere are besides, 14 whose magnitudes are not catalogued, nine of which are obscure and five nebular. This is the theory of Ptolemy. According to Abdul Rahm\u0101n-b- Omar al Sufi,29\n\n37 are of the 2nd magnitude\n200 ,, ,, 3rd ,,\n421 ,, ,, 4th ,,\n267 ,, ,, 5th ,,\n70 ,, ,, 6th ,,\nand four nebular.\n\n29 There is little known of this astronomer, but that he was a native of Rai, and according to D'Herbelot, preceptor of Adhadul Daulah of the Bowide dynasty. Hammer Purgstall gives the date of his death in A. H. 376, (A. D. 986) at the age of 85. He was the author of a work on the fixed stars with illustrations and two [three] others less important. [See Ency. Islam, i. 57.]\nCHAPTER II\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EARTH\n\nThe Earth is spherical and its centre is the centre of the Universe. The elevations and depressions caused by the action of water or violence of the winds do not affect its spheroidity. Its circumference is 5,059 yojana,\\(^1\\) 2 kos, 1,154 dand. The ancient Greeks reckoned the circumference to be 8,000 farsakh\\(^2\\) and its diameter 2,545 \\(5/11\\) farsakh. Modern geometers give [16] 6,700 farsakh for the circumference and 2,163 \\(7/11\\) farsakh for the diameter. All concur in making one farsakh equal to 3 miles.\n\nThe Hindu philosophers have the following rule for determining the diameter and circumference. To find the circumference. Multiply the given diameter which they call biy\u0101ns by the multiplier 3,927 termed gunit, and divide the product by the divisor 1,250 called bh\u0101g; and the quotient, labdhi will be the circumference.\\(^3\\) To find the diameter. Multiply the given circumference by 1,250 the former divisor, and divide the product by 3,927, the former multiplier, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The calculations are discrepant. Pulisa reckons 5,026 \\(14/15\\) and its diameter 1,600, while Brahmagupta gives 5,000 and 1,581 respectively and Ibn T\u0101rik 6,596 \\(9/25\\) and 2,100. Albiruni, India, I, p. 312, II, p. 66.\n\n\\(^2\\) The calculation of Eratosthenes (276-196 B.C.), determined by a method identical with that which would be employed by a modern astronomer, gives the circumference at 250,000 stadia; Posidonius (135 B.C.) made it 240,000 stadia or 30,000 miles. Lewis, Astron. of the Anc., pp. 199-215.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u092c\u093e\u0932\u094d\u092f, biy\u0101nam. Sanak. biy\u0101ns. \u0917\u0941\u0923\u0915, gunak.

Sansk. bh\u0101g.\n\nThe rule in the Surya-Siddh\u0101nta is to multiply the square of the diameter by 10, and the square root of the product will be the circumference. The diameter is taken at 1,600 yojana. Pulisa reckons the relation of the diameter to the circumference as 1,250 : 3,927, and Brahmagupta as nearly 12,959 : 40,980. Alibiruni, II. 71\u201472.\nthe quotient will be the diameter. The rule of Archimedes as given in Greek works, is accepted by the Hindus in the same manner, as an approximate calculation. The gist of the rule is that the relation of the diameter to the circumference is the ratio of $7:22$, or about thrice the diameter and one-seventh. Any given diameter is multiplied by 22, and divided by 7, the quotient being the circumference. Again the circumference multiplied by 7 and divided by 22 gives the diameter. The fraction, however, is really less than $1/7$ and greater than $10/71$. It is evident that the Hindu rule was unknown to the Greeks or they would have vaunted it in their own praise. Glory be to Him who alone knoweth the relation of the diameter to the circumference.\n\nNow the method of ascertaining the diameter of the (earth's) circumference was after this manner. On a level plain by means of instruments like the astrolabe, the armillary sphere or the quadrant of altitude, taking the elevation of the north pole of the Equinoctial, they proceed northwards, or southwards on the meridian line guided by the astrolabe, and raise the vertical indices above the plane of the circle so that they cover one another. And thus a distance is traversed which exceeds, or is less than the elevation above-mentioned by one degree. If the advance be to the north, it will increase; if to the south, the reverse. The distance from beginning to end is measured and the result forms a degree. Thus the circumference is found.\n\n---\n\nAccording to Albiruni, Archimedes defined it to be something between $10/70$ and $11/70$. (Chap. XV, p. 80), but the statement of Abul Fazl is correct. The book of Archimedes on the Dimensions of the Circle consists of three propositions. 1st, every circle is equal to a right angled triangle of which the sides containing the right angle are equal respectively to its radius and circumference. 2nd, the ratio of the area of the circle to the square of its diameter is nearly that of 11 to 14. 3rd, the circumference of the circle is greater than three times its diameter by a quantity greater than $10/70$ of the diameter, but less than $1/7$ of the same. Smith. Art. Archimedes.\nThe ancients by this operation found the degree to be 22 farsakh and \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) or \\( 66\\frac{2}{3} \\) miles. When the plain of Sanj\u00e4r near Mausil, was selected by the Caliph Al M\u0101mun for this experiment, Kh\u0101lid-b-Abdu\u2019l Malik Marwarudi with a body of scientific men went towards the north, and Ali-b-Is\u0101 [17] Usturl\u0101bi with another to the south. The former party found the degree longer than the latter; for when each had measured their respective distances, it was found to be 18 farsakh or \\( 56\\frac{2}{3} \\) miles. The difference between the two was \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of a mile.\\(^5\\) M\u0101mun as a test, asked the two parties the distance between Mecca and Baghdad. According to the above calculation, multiplying \\( 12^\\circ 40' \\) by \\( 56\\frac{2}{3} \\) miles which is a degree, they made the distance to be 720 kos.\\(^6\\) By the order of the Caliph the most level and shortest route between the two cities was measured and the difference was found to be slight. It is strange that the accurate (N\u0101siruddin) Tusi in his Tazkirah (u\u2019l N\u0101siriyah. Liber Memorialis de astronomia) should ascribe to the ancients what is related of the astronomers of M\u0101mun\u2019s age regarding the measurement of a degree in the plain of Sanj\u00e4r. Mulla Qutbu\u2019ddin Shir\u0101zi\\(^7\\) in his Tuhflat (u\u2019l Sh\u0101hiyah, Donum regium) and other works, expresses the opinion of the moderns in regard to the astronomers of that Caliph, in the manner I have related. There has been undoubtedly a slip of the pen in the Tazkirah. The Hindu astronomers make the degree 14 yojanas, 436 dand, 2 cubits and 4 digits, and explain it after the former manner.\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) Mr. Reuben Barrow [in his notes in Gladwin\u2019s trans. of the Ain,] here remarks, that from the spheroidity of the earth, the degrees ought to increase towards the north: but this difference is much greater than it ought to be according to theory.\n\n\\(^6\\) Mr. Barrow here notes in Gladwin\u2019s work, that as the true length of a degree is between 69 and 70 miles, and there is reason to believe that the measures could not be far wrong, it follows that we have not the true length of their measures.\n\n\\(^7\\) H\u0101ji Khalifah gives the year of his death as A. H. 720 (A. D. 1370). He composed the astronomical work alluded to, for the Emir Sh\u0101h Muhammad-b.-Mutazz-b.-T\u0101hir,\nAlso on a level plain at sunrise they regulate the course of ghari by means of the Siktajantra which is an instrument like an hour-glass, measured for 60 ghari. With this they walk eastwards. After 84 yojanas and a fraction, there is a difference of one ghari and the day advanced by that time. This multiplied by 60 gives the circumference of the Earth.\n\n**Description of the Insular Continents.**\n\nThe Hindu philosophers describe the terraqueous globe as comprising seven insular continents and seven seas, the whole area of land and sea measuring 7,957,750 yojanas.\n\n1. *Jambu Dwipa* is an island surrounded by the ocean, and is the habitation of the human race and the greater part of the animal creation. They consider it together with half the ocean, as equal to a half of the whole globe. The breadth of the ocean is 130 yojanas, and the breadth of the island is\n\n---\n\n8 Mr. Reuben Barrow's note on this is as follows: \"Their intent was evidently to measure a degree of longitude in a parallel circle. The principle of the method was the same as that of our modern longitude watches; and the general practice was to adjust the Siktajantra to the time of the meridian they set out from: and to go eastward till the difference of the times shewn by it and by observation appeared to be one ghari. For if the instrument was exact, whatever meridian it was carried under, it would still continue to show the time under the meridian of the first place: and if the place arrived at was one degree more to the east, the time found at that place (whether by the sun's rising or any other method) would be one ghari more, and so in proportion; and this is what is meant by the day being more advanced. The Hindus must doubtless have observed the necessity of allowing for the change of declination in the time of sunrise; but according to the mode prescribed by the author, it would be requisite to restrict the time of making the experiment to that of the solstice.\"\n\n9 The description of these islands, their extent, position and reference to European Geography, form a literature of their own, too disputed and uncertain in their details for dogmatism, were the Puranic Cosmography credible enough to be worth it. \"Manifold are the opinions of people,\" says Brahmagupta, \"relating to the description of the earth and to Mount Meru, particularly among those who study the Pur\u0101nas and the religious literature.\" I content myself with indicating for reference, Chaps.

They say that in the centre of the Earth is a mountain of gold like an axis, and that part of it which with reference to Jambu Dwipa is above the Earth, is called Sumeru and is 84,000 yojanas [18] high. They believe that the degrees of paradise are on its summit and around its sides. It is said to be the same depth below the surface, and this is known as Badw\u0101nal and extraordinary fables are told of it. This is the account of the fanatical traditionists of this people, but the learned among them, like the Greeks, do not admit of a height over $2\\frac{1}{3}$ farsakh.\n\n2. Sh\u0101ka-dwipa: half the sea bounds it on one side, and its superficial extent is 427,424 yojanas. Beyond this is a sea of milk, of 801,097 yojanas.\n\n3. Sh\u0101lmali Dwipa; 320,120 yojanas.

In these six last Dwipas, are located the degrees of the lower regions. The seven seas measure together 3,079,474 yojanas and the dry land 4,878,278 yojanas.\n\nThe habitation of men and animals extends to the 53rd degree of latitude, being 728 yojanas.\nDESCRIPTION OF JAMBU DWIPA.\n\nThe legends regarding the six islands being beyond the limits of credibility, I put them aside and confine myself to a few particulars regarding Jambu.\n\nDividing the ocean, at each of the four cardinal directions with relation to the equatorial line, stands a city whose fenced walls are of bricks of gold. 1. Yamakoti. The earth's longitude is reckoned from this, but in the Greek treatises the Hindu canon is said to be based (as $0^\\circ$ of longitude) on Gangdizh,\\(^{10}\\) the Greeks being really unaware from what point their [19] longitude was taken.\\(^{11}\\) 2. Lanka.\\(^{11}\\) 3. Siddhapura. 4. Romaka. Each of these is distant 90 degrees from its neighbour and $180^\\circ$ from that which is opposite to it. The mountain Sumeru is distant $90^\\circ$ from each. The northern sides of these lie under the equinoctial circle which in Sanskrit is called Vishuva-vritta. This circle passes over the zenith of the inhabitants of these four cities, and the sun twice in the year reaches the zenith, and day and night throughout the year are nearly equal. The greatest altitude of the sun is $90^\\circ$. His progression is from Lanka to Romaka, from thence to Siddhapura, continuing to Yamakoti and back to Lanka. When the sun is in the meridian of Yamakoti, it is sunrise at Lanka, sunset at Siddhapura, and midnight at Romaka, and when it is midday in Lanka, it rises at Romaka, sets at Yamakoti, and is midnight at Siddhapura. When he is in the meridian of Romaka, it is sunrise at Siddhapura, sunset at Lanka and midnight at Yamakoti. When in the meridian of Siddhapura, the sun rises at\n\n\\(^{10}\\) This is said to be a fortress built by Zoh\u0101k in the city of Babylon. Some account of it will be found in the 2 Vol. (Macan's edit.) of the Sh\u0101hn\u0101mah. According to Albiruni, Abu Maashar based his canon on this place as a first meridian.\n\n\\(^{11}\\) Lanka and Ujjain. With Adelard de Bath, Gerard of Cremona, Albert the Great and Roger Bacon the name appears as Arim or Arym, and this place received the name of the Cupola of the earth which was also applied to Lanka. Rein, ccxlvii. 1.\nYamakoti, sets at Romaka and it is midnight at Lanka. There is a difference of 15 gharis between each of these four places.\n\nAgain, north of Lanka towards Sumeru there are said to be three mountains: Him\u0101chala, Hemakuta and Nishadha. These three mountains in this order stretch across from the shore of the eastern sea to the western quarter. From Siddhapura to Sumeru also are three other ranges. Sringavanta, Sukla, and Nila. There is another mountain between Yamakoti and Sumeru, called M\u0101lyavanta adjoining Nishadha and Nila, and another between Romaka and Sumeru called Gandham\u0101dana whose extremes meet the same two ranges.\n\nExtraordinary are the legends regarding these mountains which cannot here be particularised, but something shall be set down of the region between Lanka and Him\u0101chala, and a little stand exemplar for much. This intervening country is called Bharata-khanda. Bharata was a mighty sovereign and this tract was named after him. From Lanka to Him\u0101chala which is 52 degrees, the country is inhabited, the settlements being particularly frequent up to the 48th degree, and less so through the remaining four, on account of the extreme cold.\n\nAccording to their supposition a celestial degree is equal to 14 yojanas on earth; the whole fifty-two degrees therefore are 728 yojanas which they consider to represent the habitable world. Between Him\u0101chala and Hemakuta lies Kinnara-khanda comprising 12 degrees of latitude. Between Hemakuta and Nishadha is Harikhanda comprising the same number of degrees. Between Siddhapura and Sringa-vanta is Kuru-khanda occupying 52 degrees. Between Sringavanta and Shukla lies Hiranmaya-khand with 12 degrees of latitude, the whole of which is of gold. Between Shukla and Nila is the tract called Ramyaka-khanda comprising the same number of degrees of latitude, and between Yamakoti and\nM\u0101lyavanta is Bhadr\u0101sva-khanda with an extent of $76^\\circ$. Intermediate between Gandham\u0101dana and Romaka is Ketum\u0101la of $76^\\circ$. Between M\u0101lyavanta, Gandham\u0101dana, Nishadha and Nila is Il\u0101vrita and extends $14^\\circ$ on each quarter.\\footnote{These tracts are named after the nine sons of Agnidhra, the king of Jambu-dwipa, who were named, N\u0101bhi, Kimpurusha, Harivarsha, Il\u0101vrita, Ramya, Hiranvat, Kuru, Bhadr\u0101sva, and Ketum\u0101la. Vishnu Pur. See also the Siddh\u0101nta Siromani where all these names and divisions occur.} The superficial measurement of these nine divisions is said to be equal, though the breadth of some is less than that of others.\n\nOn the four sides of Sumeru are four other mountains; that on the side of Yamakoti is called Mandara; that towards Lanka, Sugandha Parvata; on the Romaka quarter, Vipula, and towards Siddhapura, Suparsva. The height of each is 18,000 yojanas.\n\nThe nine divisions of Jambu-dwipa having been recorded, I now proceed to relate some particulars of the first division, Bh\u0101rata-khanda. Between Lanka and Him\u0101chala are said to be seven mountain ranges, extending from east to west and smaller than the former ranges. These are, Mahendra, Sukti, Malaya, Riksha, Pariy\u0101tra, Sahya, Vindhya.\\footnote{I correct the readings of the text from the Vishnu Pur\u0101na. The Mahendra chain extends from Orissa to Gondwana, part of which near Ganjam is still called Mahendra Malei or hills of Mahendra. Sukti or Suktimat is doubtful. Sahya is the northern portion of the W. Ghats, the mountains of the Konkan; Riksha, the mountains of Gondwana. Vindhya is here restricted to the eastern division of the chain. Pariy\u0101tra or P\u0101rip\u0101tra is the northern and western portion. The classification seems to have been known to Ptolemy. See Wilson's note. Vish. P. 174.}\n\nThe tract between Lanka and Mahendra is called Indra-khanda; between it and Sukti, Kaser; between Sukti and Malaya, T\u0101mravarna; between Malaya and Riksha, Gabbhistimat; between Riksha and P\u0101riy\u0101tra, N\u0101g-khanda; between P\u0101riy\u0101tra and Sahya, Saumyakhanda. The tract between Sahya and Vindhya is divided in two parts, the eastern of\nwhich is called Kum\u0101ra-khanda, and the western V\u0101runa-\nkhanda.\\textsuperscript{14}\n\nThe upper half of the globe would be represented by the accompanying plate.\n\n\\textit{Lacuna.}\n\nThe Hindus also divide the world into three regions. The upper is named Swar-loka, where the good receive the reward of their virtuous life. The middle region is Bhur-loka, which is the abode of mankind. The lower is called P\u0101t\u0101la-loka, where the wicked receive the punishment of their evil deeds.\n\nThe religious teachers of this creed conceive the world to be a superficies divided into fourteen parts. Seven superior, \\textit{viz.}, Bhur-loka, Swar-loka, Mahar-loka, Jana-loka, Tapo-loka and Satya-loka and the same number inferior, Atala, Sutala, Vitala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, and Patala. They relate extraordinary legends regarding the inhabitants of each region which cannot be inserted in a summary narrative.\n\nThis people also speak of seven seas and seven islands (\\textit{dwipas}), and nine divisions of Jambu-dwipa, but there is considerable diversity in their order, extent and other particulars; as for instance, the mountain Sumeru is reckoned to be 84,000 yojanas above ground, and 32,000 in breadth and 16,000 below the surface of the earth and the same in breadth. The habitable earth is not confined, they think, only to Bharatakhanda nor even to Jambu-dwipa. They say that beyond the ocean there is a land of gold\\textsuperscript{15} which is the abode of men. Their duration of life extends to a thousand years, neither more nor less. Sickness and grief come not nigh them, neither have they fear nor greed nor ignorance. They follow not evil speaking nor jealousy nor calumny and live in peace, in rectitude and in charity. They lose not the\n\n\\textsuperscript{14} For Kum\u0101ra, which is Kum\u0101rika in Wilford, the Vishnu P. has Gandharva.\n\n\\textsuperscript{15} This is Pushkara the 7th Dwipa, and recalls \"the land of Hevilath where gold groweth\" in the 2nd Chap. of Genesis.\nvigour of youth, neither are they invaded by [P. 22] weakness or decrepitude. They are of the same creed and race and have no distinction of food or clothing, and their wishes are gratified without toil. Of the other islands in like manner are wonderful legends told which the ordinary rigid formalist would not admit to a hearing, but do not surprise the adoring believer in Divine Omnipotence.\n\nThey also divide Kum\u0101rakhanda into two parts. The country where the black antelope is not found they call Mlechchha-des,\\(^{16}\\) and regard it with contempt and unworthy of existence. The region where that animal is indigenous is called Jag-des, and it is subdivided into four parts. 1. Aryavarta, bounded on the east and west by the ocean, and north and south by two mountain ranges of Hindust\u0101n; 2. Madhya-des, to the east of which is Illah\u0101b\u0101s and to the west the river Vin\u0101s\u0101, twenty-five kos from Thanesar, and bounded to the north and south by the same ranges. 3. Brahmarikh-des (Brahmarshi), comprises five places: 1. Thanesar and its dependencies; 2. Bair\u0101th (var. Pair\u0101th); 3. Kampila (var.\n\n\\(^{16}\\) The Mlechchhas are the Kir\u0101tas of the Vishnu Pur., the inhabitants of the mountains east of Hindustan according to H. H. Wilson. Wilford places them in the mountains of the Deccan. All this passage is taken from the ordinances of Manu and the names are marred in the taking. Manu writes as follows in Sir W. Jones' translation: Chap. II.\n\n(17.) Between the two divine rivers Saraswati and Drishadwati lies the tract of land which the sages have named Brahm\u0101varta because it was frequented by gods.\n\n(19.) Kurukshetra, Matsya, Panch\u0101la or K\u0101nya\u015bubja Surasena or Mathura form the region called Brahmarshi, distinguished from Brahm\u0101varta.\n\n(21.) That country which lies between Himavat and Vindhya to the east of Vinasana and to the west of Pray\u0101ga, is celebrated by the title of Madhya-desa or the central region.\n\n(22.) As far as the eastern as far as the western ocean, between the two mountains just mentioned lies the tract which the wise have named Ariavarta, or inhabited by respectable men.\n\nBurnell in his translation explains Vinasana as the terminus of the Saraswati. Pray\u0101ga is of course, Allahabad. Wilford identifies the Drishadwati as the Caggar or Gagar, but the courses of these rivers must have considerably altered. Cf. Wilson, Vishnu Pur\u0101na, p. 181, note.\nKanilah), 4. Mathur\u0101; 5. Kanauj. 4 Brahm\u0101varta, the fertile tract between the Sarsuti (Saraswati) and R\u0101kasi (Drishadwati) rivers.\n\nON TERRESTRIAL LONGITUDE.\n\nThe Hindus term longitude lambana, and make it consist of $180^\\circ$ after the manner of the Greeks. They reckon its beginning (as $0^\\circ$ of longitude) from Yamakoti in the farthest east, apparently because following the movement of night and day, the nearest point to its origin is selected. The Greeks reckon from the Islands of the Blest. There are six islands of the western ocean formerly inhabited, but now submerged beneath the sea. From their delightful climate, their choice production of fruits and flowers and the luxuriance of their vegetation, they were accounted a paradise. Men call them the Eternal Islands (Kh\u0101ld\u0101t) or the Fortunate (Sa\u02bfd\u0101). Some assert that the Fortunate Isles are 24 in number between the Eternal Islands and the sea-shore. Of the Greeks, some take the reckoning of longitude from the shore of the western (Atlantic) ocean which they call Okean\u00f3s which is $10^\\circ$ east\n\n---\n\n17 The number mentioned by Ptolemy and Pliny instead of seven, the actual number of the ai ton Makar\u014dn nysoi. A table of their ancient and modern names will be found in W. Smith\u2019s Dict.\n\nReinaud notices the distinction or confusion made by the Arabs between the Eternal Isles or Islands of the Blest, and the Fortunate Isles. Abulfeda confounds them, but Ibn Sayd places the Fortunate Isles among the Eternal and about them, making the latter 6 in number and the former 24 and distributing them among the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd climates between the 16th and 30th degrees of north latitude, thus allowing the inference that the Fortunate Isles are the Canaries and the Eternal the Cape de Verde. Geog. Abulf. Intro. ccxxiv.\n\n18 According to a fragment of Phavorinus, not a Greek word, but derived from the barbarians probably connected with Sanskrit. Among the Greeks the son of Uranus and Gaia, became in physical geography, a river or stream circumfluent round the earth, and the large expanses of water are distinguished by Herodotus as seas. But the idea of the encircling waters became transferred as a secondary meaning to the ocean and specially to the Atlantic which was called the Great Sea, the Outer Sea, the Atlantic or simply the Ocean. Smith\u2019s Dict. Geog.\nof the Eternal Islands. The distance of the shore from the islands is $222\\frac{2}{9}$ farsakh according to the system of the ancients, or $189\\frac{8}{9}$ farsakh according to the moderns, the latter being guided to this conclusion by observation of the motion of the Zodiacial signs in succession and the proximity of the place. In the longitudinal reckoning of places both are agreed. The longitude is an arc of the equatorial between its point of upper intersection with the meridian measured from the beginning of the habitable earth (the first meridian), and its point of upper intersection with the meridian of the given place, and the interval is the distance between the place and the first meridian at its nearest side.\\footnote{This is the literal translation, but it must be taken to include the meaning that the arc of the equator intercepted between the two meridians may be reckoned on any parallel of latitude as well as on the equator. It must be remembered with reference to what is termed the point of upper intersection that all south of the equator is supposed to be water and uninhabited and that therefore the upper half circle only of the equatorial is considered.}\n\nTo find the longitude; at the first meridian or a place whose longitude is known, observe the exact time of the occultation of light in a lunar-eclipse, its duration and initial or total reappearance, and let a similar observation be made at the place whose unknown longitude is required. If the time be the same on both, their longitude will be the same. If the time be later at the place required, the city is more to the eastward.\\footnote{The rule in the Surya Siddh\u0101nta is as follows: At the given place if the Moon's total darkness (in her eclipse) begins or ends after the instant when it begins or ends at the Middle line of the Earth, then the given place is E. of the Middle line, (but if it begins or ends) before the instant (when it begins or ends on the Middle line, then) the given place is west of the Middle line.} The difference of the times of observation is taken, and an excess in the number of degrees over the place whose longitude is known, is allotted on the calculation of six degrees for every ghari and fifteen degrees for every hour, reckoning 4 minutes to the degree. If the time be earlier, the city is more westerly and the calculation is the\nreverse of that for the east. According to the system of the Hindu astronomers who begin their reckoning of longitude from the east, in the first instance, the number of degrees will diminish, and in the second case, increase.\n\nON TERRESTRIAL LATITUDE.\n\nThis is called by the Hindus Aksha. It is reckoned from Lanka and carried to the 52nd degree of latitude. All within this region is populous, but less so up to 14\u00b0 further (north) on account of the severity of the cold. The Greeks reckon their latitude from the equator, and as their circle passes through Lanka, there is no discrepancy and the result is the same. The latitude of a place is an arc extending from the equator between the meridian of the place, and its upper intersection with the equinoctial. In short it is the distance of the meridian of the city from the equinoctial, and that is the degree of the elevation of the pole (above the horizon of the place).\n\nTo find the latitude.\\(^{21}\\) Take the latitude of a (circumpolar) star that is constantly visible, and ascertain its highest and lowest points of ascension. Subtract the lesser from the greater and add half the remainder to the lesser, or subtract it from the greater. The result of this process of addition and subtraction gives the latitude of the place. Or\n\nDuring either equinox, take the altitude of the sun at noon. Subtract this from 90\u00b0 and the remainder is the latitude of the place. Or\n\nWhen the sun enters the first of Cancer, take its greatest altitude and subtract its total declination. The remainder will give the co-latitude. Subtract this from 90\u00b0 and the remainder gives the latitude of the place.\n\n\\(^{21}\\) Albiruni says in his 29th Chapter on India, that the Hindu method of determining the latitude of a place had not come to his knowledge.\nEvery place whose longitude is less than $90^\\circ$ is called west longitude, and greater than $90^\\circ$ east longitude. According to the Hindus it is the reverse. Every place whose latitude is less than $33^\\circ$, is south, and greater than $33^\\circ$, north latitude.\n\nIn order to ascertain the (times of) worldly events, at the sun\u2019s first entry into Aries, they observe its rising at Lanka, and finding the horoscope, they assemble to determine the calculation and this they call *Lankudaya Lagna*.\\(^{22}\\) The oblique ascension is used to determine the relative conditions of any particular place, and is called *Nagr-udaya Lagna*. The Greeks observe this system, but they have two *ascendens* or horoscopes, one at the extreme east to ascertain the circumstances of one hemisphere and the second at the cupola of the earth which is the means of discovering the conditions of the other. They consider that as the circle of the meridian cuts the globe of the earth, it appears as a circle on its circumference and intersects the equatorial line. The point of intersection (Lanka) is called the cupola or the centre of the earth. Some\n\n\\(^{22}\\) The etymology of these terms is thus given in the *Siddh\u0101nta Siromani*.\n\nThat point of the ecliptic which is, at any time, on the eastern horizon is called the Lagna or horoscope. This is expressed in signs and degrees and reckoned from the first point of stellar Aries. That point which is on the western horizon is called the Asta-Lagna or setting horoscope. The point of the ecliptic of the meridian is called the Madhya-Lagna or middle horoscope (culminating point of the ecliptic). The Udaya-Lagna is the rising horoscope or the point of the ecliptic which comes to the eastern horizon at the same time with the planet, its Asta-Lagna being the setting horoscope or the point of the ecliptic which is on the eastern horizon when the planet reaches the western horizon.\n\nAccording to a paper in the *As. Res.* II, by Samuel Davis, the Hindus signify by the *Lagna of Lanka*, those points of the equator which rise respectively with each 30th degree of the ecliptic in a right sphere, answering to the right ascension in any latitude. By the Lagna of any particular place, the oblique ascension or the divisions of the equator which rise in succession with each sign in an oblique sphere. By the horoscope is signified the point of the ecliptic rising at a given time after sunrise, the rule to find which is given in the *Surya Siddh\u0101nta*, (B\u0101pu Deva, p. 39). The omphalos which marked Delphi as the centre of Greece and of the Earth, existed in the temple of Delphi during the historic period.\nsuppose the cupola to be in the middle of the oikoim\u00e9ny, that is at a spot situated in Lon. 90\u00b0, Lat. 33\u00b0. Others place it in the fourth climate, Lon. 9\u00b0, Lat. 36\u00b0.\n\nA brief description of the cosmogony according to the strange theories of Hindu sages having been given, I here note some particulars of the system of the Greeks to relieve the dryness of this exposition.\n\nThere are nine integral heavens\\(^{23}\\). 1. The greatest heaven, called also the crystalline, whose revolution is the cause of night and day. 2. The heaven of the fixed stars. 3. The heaven of Saturn. 4. The heaven of Jupiter. 5. The heaven of Mars. 6. The heaven of the Sun. 7. The heaven of Venus. 8. The heaven of Mercury. 9. The heaven of the Moon. There are besides fifteen minor spheres. Again, the elemental spheres are nine in number.\n\nThe first is of Fire: its convex adjoins the concave of the sphere of the moon.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{23}\\) The Istil\u0101h\u0101tu'l Funun describes the heavens (\u0101fl\u0101k) as of two kinds: (1) the integral or independent (Kullya) which are not parts of other heavens, and, (2) the supplemental or dependent (juzya) that are so. The integral sphere is simple (mughrad) when it has no dependent sphere, such as the great or crystalline heaven; and it is compound (markab) if it has such, like the heavens of the planets. Its definition of the word \"heaven\" (f\u0101lk) corresponds to that of \u0101sm\u0101n at p. 14. The great or crystalline heaven, the sphere par excellence which includes all others is called also the heaven of heavens, the universal heaven (f\u0101lk-ul-kul), the starless, the lofty, the all-comprehending, &c. It is the primum mobile having a swift motion from E. to W. completed in less than 24 hours, and its movement carries round the other heavens and all in them, for being itself the prime motor, it possesses the force to compel the motion of all included by it, for it is the motor of them in essentia rei and of all in them per accidens. The crystalline sphere of Anaximander was handed down to the middle ages as a cosmical theory and the firmament was supposed to consist of from 8 to 10 glassy spheres encasing each other like the coats of an onion. The vault was called crystalline from the supposed condensation of the air into a solid transparent body by the action of fiery ether.\n\nAlbiruni (Chap. XX) accepting the necessity of eight spheres, sees no object in a ninth, which was unknown to Plato. For Islamic astronomy, see Ency. Islam, i. 497-501.\nThe second, of Air: of this there are four strata, viz.,\n\n1. volatilised where the fluid is permeated by vapour, for the ascending vapours do not reach this point but become dissipated. It is here that comets, Zodiacal light,\\textsuperscript{24} luminous streams and meteors and the like have their origin. The Hindus regard them all as astral bodies of which they number a thousand kinds, and believe that they are always in existence but only occasionally visible:\\textsuperscript{25} 2. predominant, where the shooting stars are observed; 3. boreal, which is a vaporous wind and extremely cold in which clouds, lightning, thunder and thunderbolts take their rise; 4. dense, and this adjoins the spheres of Water and Earth.\n\nThe third, of Water: this surrounds the earth and from the effect of light and contact with earth, does not retain its original purity and thus waters varying in sweet, saline, clear, and turbid qualities spring from the soil and are diverse in their scantiness, excess, limpidity and density.\n\nThe fourth, Earth: this according to their notions lies in three strata (\u03b1) that which by the bounty of the Creator came forth from the waters and subjected to heat became dry land, wherein is the region of mountain and mine and the habitat of the greater number of animals; (\u03b2) clay, which is earth\n\n\\textsuperscript{24} The term Nezak or Nayzak (a short spear) was first applied, according to Humboldt, \\textit{(Kosmos I, 128 Otte)}, by the Court astronomers of Persia to the strange light never before observed, seen in 1688 in Persia and described by the great traveller Chardin. In his \\textit{Atlas du Voyage}, however, he applies the term ny\u0101zak to the famous comet which appeared over nearly the whole world in 1688 and whose head was so hidden in the west that it could not be seen in the horizon of Isfahan.\n\n\\textsuperscript{25} \"The belief in the existence of non-luminous stars was diffused amongst the ancient Greeks and in the early ages of Christianity. The doubt as to the passing away and reappearance of stars is expressed by Pliny in his mention of Hipparchus, 'Stellae an obirent nascenturve?'\" The authority of Humboldt is opposed to the doctrine of their annihilation and affirms that the cosmical alteration is merely the transition of matter into new forms and that dark cosmical bodies may by a renewed process of light again become luminous. \\textit{Kosmos III}, pp. 222\u2014254. Otte.\nmixed with water; (v) earth simple, and this is about the centre of the globe.\n\nSome writers blindly following traditional lore hold that the Earth like the heavens consists of seven vaults, and another school believes that the heavens overshadow them all, and that each earth is surrounded by a mountain, as the mountain of Q\u0101f\\(^{28}\\) surrounds this habitable world. They also assert that the earths are of gold, and ruby and the like. Some pretend that beyond Q\u0101f there are seventy regions of gold, followed by as many of musk and imagine similar extraordinary strata. Though fable may create a hundred other such fancies, no proof can substantiate them.\n\n**Extent of Desert and Habitable Land.**\n\nThe equinoctial is a great circle, the two poles whereof are the two poles of the earth. The one which is in the direction of Ursa Minor called also Ban\u0101t u\u2019n Naash, is the north pole. The constellation of the [P. 25] Kid\\(^{27}\\) is adjacent to it. The other is the south pole\\(^{28}\\). When the sun passes over this circle, night and day are of equal length in all places, either actually or approximately, and this occurs in the first\n\n---\n\n\\(^{26}\\) Albiruni says (XXIII) that the mountain called by his people Q\u0101f, is Lokaloka with the Hindus, 'a fabulous belt of mountain boundary, beyond the seven seas and dividing the visible world from the regions of darkness).\n\n\\(^{27}\\) Jidy. It is not a constellation but a of Ursa Minor, i.e., the polar star. Reinaud (Abulf. I. cxciv) calls it le Chevreau and points out that its other signification of Capricorn has led astray several savants, notably Silvestre de Sacy (Recueil des Notices t. VIII, p. 146, et. 178). The Bear which does not set for those who live north of the equator, serves the Arabs to mark the north while Canopus which is always visible to them, marks the south. Reinaud. Ibid.\n\n\\(^{28}\\) \"It is well known\", says Albiruni (xxii) \"that the north pole with us is called the Great Bear, and the south pole, Canopus. But some of our people maintain that in the south of heaven too, there is a Great Bear of the same shape as the northern, which revolves round the southern pole.\" The Greek word \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 originally signified a ball or sphere and hence was applied to the cavity of the heavens.\nof Aries and Libra. From this imaginary circle being drawn upon the concave surface of the *magnus orbis*, a great circle is delineated upon the earth which divides it into two-halves north and south, the periphery being called the equatorial line where night and day are always equal.\n\nThe horizon is of two kinds, the *real* and the *sensible*, and the latter is to be understood in two ways. The first is a circle parallel to the *real* horizon and contiguous to the surface of the earth. The second is a circle which divides the visible portion of the sphere from the invisible, and this horizon is also called the visible, the radial and the horizon of vision. The zenith and nadir are its two poles, which vary with the spectator and his position. The *real* horizon is a great circle, having the same two poles, and the distance of the first sensible horizon from the *real*, is half the earth's diameter, and by this the *real* horizon is obtained.\\(^{29}\\) And as the equatorial line divides the earth into two halves, the northern and the southern, the circle of the *real* horizon divides those two halves again into two, an upper and a lower. Thus by these two circles, the earth is apportioned into four quarters, an upper and lower northern, and similar southern divisions. The Greeks supposed the northern quarter only to be above water, but they have determined this by no proof. Its creation was assigned to the power of the Sun, in order that animal life to which breathing is a necessity, might secure the capacity to exist and the wondrous power of human speech become manifest. Through the force of the celestial light and the accretional properties of matter in the upper\n\n\\(^{29}\\) That is, in those regions where the sun's rays fall directly and not obliquely upon the earth. So Albiruni says \"The country S. of the Line is not known and the earth is too much burnt to be habitable. Parts of the inhabited world do not reach nearer the equator than to a distance of several days journey. There the water of the sea is dense because the sun so intensely vapourises the particles of water that fishes and other animals keep away from it. . . . The sun when reaching the perigee of his excentric sphere, stands nearly in its utmost southern declination and burns all the countries over which he culminates.\" *Chronology*, 249.\nregions, and by the action of the winds and the commotion of the seas, lofty mountains and marvellous configurations of hills and profound abysses were produced. And because the tendency of water is to flow downwards and the earth thereby becomes viscous, the fermentation of heat and the disintegrating process of time caused the rise of mountainous ranges.\n\nWhen the sun culminates in the northern signs of the ecliptic from Aries to Virgo, its lowest declination from the equator will necessarily occur in the southern signs. From Libra to Pisces are the signs culminating in the winter solstice. At this time the sun is nearest the sphere of the earth and the warmth is excessive, the heat absorbing moisture as may be witnessed by experiment with a lamp. The solstice continues in the same sign during 2,100 years and the entire revolution is made in 25,200 years, one-half of this period being occupied in the northern and the other in the southern signs. It is now in the 3rd degree of Cancer and the opposite solstitial point is in the same degree of Capricorn. It is this ecliptic movement that has caused the northern quarter of the globe to become terra firma. Its superficial area, according to the ancients, is 5,090,000 and according to the moderns 3,678,233\u00bd farsakh. The rule to find this is to multiply the diameter by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the circumference and the product will be the measurement of the quarter of the globe, or divide the superficial area of the whole globe by 4 and the quotient gives the area of the quarter. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the quarter of the globe was created terra firma or became so at a later period. The majority incline to the latter belief from the consideration of the proximity of the solstitial points. They affirm that the whole of the fourth\n\n---\n\n30 The precession of the equinoxes was discovered by Hipparchus. At that time the point of the autumnal equinox was about 6\u00b0 east of Spica Virginis. In 1750, i.e., about 1900 years afterwards, this point was observed 26\u00b0 21' west of that star. Hence the equinoctial points will make an entire revolution in 25,745 years.\npart of the globe was *terra firma*, but that now a great part of it is submerged, such as the Eternal Islands, Greece and other places.\n\n[26] The *Oikoim\u00e9ny* is declared not to extend in latitude beyond the complement of the greatest declination of the Sun from the equator\\(^{31}\\) which is \\(60^\\circ 29' 43''\\), as animal life could not exist beyond this point from the severity of the cold. The superficial area of the *oikoim\u00e9ny* is taken by the ancients from the equatorial line to a place whose latitude is equal to the complement of the sun's greatest declination from the equator. According to the Gurg\u0101ni Canon, the superficial area is \\(4,668,502 \\frac{7}{60} \\text{ farsakh}\\) and according to the moderns \\(3,370,992\\frac{3}{4} \\text{ farsakh}\\). Some say that a portion of the upper southern quarter adjoining the northern quarter is *terra firma* but not inhabited. Others affirm that it is inhabited as far as \\(10^\\circ\\) south. Ptolemy\\(^{32}\\) in his Geography allows \\(16^\\circ 25'\\) and near the Zanj and Abyssinian, further still. A few even suppose that the other three-fourths of the globe are also above water and inhabited.\n\nAncient traditions relate that Alexander after his conquest of the northern quarter of the globe, desiring to obtain some information of the remaining quarters and of the seas thereof, named several bold and scientific explorers for this duty, and supplying them, confident in their providential\n\n---\n\n\\(^{31}\\) That is to say, the greatest northern declination from the equator being according to our calculation \\(23^\\circ 27' 27''\\); this subtracted from \\(90^\\circ\\) will give the complement of the arc from the equator to the north pole; and this complement, viz., \\(66^\\circ 32' 33''\\) reckoned from the equator measures the limit, in the sense of the text, within which men can live and beyond which in a northerly direction, they cannot.\n\n\\(^{32}\\) Ptolemy placed the southern limit of the habitable world as Abul Fazl rightly states later in the parallel of \\(16\\frac{1}{4}\\) degrees of S. Lat. at Antimerooe, and the northern limit in \\(63^\\circ\\) N. Lat. which passes through Thule, supposed to be the Shetlands. This range therefore includes \\(79\\frac{1}{4}\\) degrees. The total degrees of longitude of the habitable parts of the earth he accounts to be \\(177\\frac{1}{4}\\). *Cosmog. Fol. Venet.* 1486, Chap. XII and Mc. Crindle, *Anc. Ind.* 5.\nmission in the pursuit of knowledge, with six months' provisions, embarked them in a sea-going vessel. After sailing day and night, through the period mentioned, they fell in with some vessels, but from diversity of tongues they were unable to understand each others' intentions. A fight ensued and Alexander's party was victorious. With some of the captives they intermarried. The children of these marriages spoke the languages of both their parents and from these nurslings of life it was discovered that a certain prince had despatched this band also with the same object, and after a three months' continuous sail the encounter had taken place. But this account is disputed.\\(^{33}\\) In other ancient writings it is related that Alexander sent out a party of scientific men thoroughly proficient in the knowledge of various languages, on an expedition by sea with provisions for three years. They were instructed to sail eastwards for a period of a year and a half towards the rising places of the stars, and then to return and relate their experience. This party after sailing the appointed time reached a flourishing coast and they learnt that they had penetrated to the country of Bactria. Alexander for a time appointed some of his ministers to the government of this province.\n\nAt the present day, those of more exact information declare that the south is inhabited in the same way as the north. Of late years the Europeans have discovered an extensive and populous insular continent which they have called the New World. Some shattered vessels had been here driven ashore. A man mounted on horseback was seen by the inhabitants. Mistaking the man and his horse for a single animal they were overcome by fear and the country fell an easy capture.\n\n\\(^{33}\\) Such is the literal translation of this ridiculous account but nothing is too childish or incredible for Abul Fazl's narrative,\nDIVISION OF THE EARTH INTO COUNTRIES.\n\nThe learned have divided the oikoy mene into seven parts, to each of which they have given the name of klima. Some reckon from the equator as Ptolemy shows in his [27] Almagest. Another school omitting 12\u00b0 45' north of the equator, divide the remainder and terminate as is known at the 50\u00b0 31\u00b0 parallel of latitude. In the former case, therefore, the parallels from the equator will be seven circles and in the latter, eight. The seven belts which these lines form are called climates. A climate therefore is a belt on the surface of the earth between two semi-circles parallel with\n\n---\n\n34 In the Almagest (II. 6) he marks ten climates north of the equator, beginning at the parallel of Taprobane in lat. 4\u00b0 15' and ending at that of Thule in lat. 63\u00b0; and in the south, beginning at the equator or the parallel of Cape Raptum and ending at the parallel of Antimeroe in 16\u00b0 25'. In the Geography he gives 19 climates; as far as the 16th climate, which is the arctic circle, twelve are determined by the increase of half an hour in the length of the longest day, the 13th and 14th, one hour, and the 15th and 16th, two hours. In the remaining climates within the arctic circle, the days no longer increase by hours but by months. Dict. of Antiq. W. Smith.\n\n35 The double theory of longitude is thus explained by Albiruni in his XXIX Chap. (Sachau's Transl. I. 304). \"Some adopt as the beginning of longitude the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and they extend the first quarters as far as the environs of Balkh. . . . So that Shaburgan and Ujjain are placed on the same meridian. A theory which so little corresponds to reality is quite valueless. Others adopt the Islands of the Happy Ones as the beginning of longitude and the quarters of the oikoumene they extend thence as far as the neighbourhood of Jurjan and Nishapur.\" That is, with Ptolemy's division of the circumference of the globe into 360\u00b0, the 90\u00b0 naturally fell in the middle of the habitable world and was taken as the central meridian. This was accounted to pass through Lanka and Ujjain but they deflected it for some strange reason to the N.W. Among the Arabs, some, after the example of Ptolemy, took their first meridian from the Fortunate Isles, others from the W. Coast of Africa making a difference of 10\u00b0. According to the first computation the 90\u00b0 fell on Nishapur in Khorasan, and according to the second on the town of Shaburgan about a day's march W. of Balkh. See Reinaud, Geography, I. ccxlv. This difference of 10\u00b0 may be constantly observed in comparing Abul Fazl's longitude with the authorities of Abulfeda.\neach other and with the equator. A climate increases in length as it approaches the equator; moreover its first parallel will be longer than its second. It is demonstrable from (experiment with) spheres that every parallel circle increases as it nears the equatorial line. The length of the first parallel of the first climate is said to be 11,856 miles approximately, and the length of its second parallel 11,230, while the length of the last parallel of the seventh climate is 1,627 farsakh. But every climate, like the longitudinal extension of the earth from west to east, is divided into an equal number of degrees of longitude, and not more or less in proportion to its length. The latitude of each belt varies.\n\nThere are two reasons given for the selection of seven as this number. The first is that ancient sages have verified by experience that each tract of superficial area was specially connected with one of the planets, as for instance, the first climate with Saturn. For this reason the inhabitants of that zone generally are dark-skinned, curly-haired, long-lived and indolent in action. The second climate, according to the Persians, had an affinity with Jupiter, but according to the Romans, with the Sun. The third climate, in the opinion of the former, with Mars, in that of the latter, with Mercury. The fourth, with the Sun, as the first mentioned suppose, but with Jupiter according to the second opinion. Both concur in ascribing the fifth to Venus. The sixth is allotted by the first to Mercury, by the second to the Moon. The seventh, the former connect with the Moon, the latter with Mars. The second opinion is that in former ages a single monarch ruled the whole habitable earth. With far-seeing and prudent policy he divided it severally among his seven sons.\n\nThe word climate may be taken in two senses, viz., the ordinary sense in which men commonly speak of a tract of country as a climate, such as Rome, Tur\u0101n, Ir\u0101n and Hindust\u0101n; and the true signification already explained. In\nthe latter meaning India is an aggregate of the first, second, third and fourth climates.\n\nThe beginning of the first climate is defined by general opinion to be north of the equator. Its latitude according to accurate information is $12^\\circ 42' 2'' 39''$. Its longest day is 12 hours and 45 minutes. Its centre has a location according to concurrent testimony, where its longest day is 13 hours. Its latitude is $16^\\circ 37' 30''$. Twenty large mountains and thirty considerable rivers are comprised in it, and its population are generally black in colour.\n\nThe beginning of the second climate has a latitude of $20^\\circ 31' 17'' 58''$. Its longest day consists of 13 hours fifteen minutes. The longest day at its centre is 13 hours, 30 minutes. Its latitude is $24^\\circ 40'$. It includes 27 mountains and 27 rivers. The colour of the inhabitants of this zone is between black and wheat colour.\n\nThe beginning of the third climate has a latitude of $27^\\circ 34' 3'' 33''$. Its longest day is 13 hours, 45 minutes. Its day at the centre is of 14 hours and the latitude $30^\\circ 40'$. It comprises 33 mountains and 22 rivers, and its inhabitants are generally of a wheat colour.\n\nThe beginning of the fourth climate has a latitude of $33^\\circ 43' 17'' 36''$. Its longest day, 14 hours, 15 minutes. At the centre the longest day is of 14 hours, 30 minutes. Lat. $36^\\circ 22'$. It includes 25 mountains and 22 rivers; the colour of its inhabitants is between wheat colour and a fair skin.\n\nThe beginning of the fifth climate is in Lat. $35^\\circ 0' 19'' 5''$. Longest day, 14 hours, 45 minutes. Longest day at centre, 15 hours. Lat. $41^\\circ 15'$. Colour of inhabitants fair. Has 30 mountains and 15 rivers.\n\nThe beginning of the sixth climate is in Lat. $43^\\circ 29' 58'' 8''$. Longest day, 15 hours, 15 minutes. Longest day at centre, 15 hours, 30 minutes. Lat. $45^\\circ 21'$. Has 11\nmountains 40 rivers. Colour of inhabitants fair inclining to tawny and with tawny hair.\n\nThe beginning of the seventh climate is in Lat. $47^\\circ 58' 59'' 17'''$. Longest day, 15 hours, 45 minutes. Longest day at centre, 16 hours. Lat. $48^\\circ 52'$. Its mountains and rivers as in the sixth climate. Colour of inhabitants ruddy and white. Its extreme parallel according to general opinion is in Lat. $50^\\circ 31' 31'' 54'''$. The longest day 16 hours, 15 minutes.\n\nThe differences in latitude of these climates are determined by the increase of half an hour in the length of the longest day. From the last parallel to the furthest inhabited point is not included in a climate on account of the paucity of its inhabitants. Some suppose the northern-most parallel of the seventh climate to be the extreme of the habitable world. According to others, the parallel of $50^\\circ 20'$ is inhabited, but they do not include it in this climate; and there is an island called Thule in Lat. $63^\\circ$. From the severity of the cold the inhabitants pass their days in heated chambers. In Lat. $63^\\circ 30'$ is habitable land the dwellers wherein are Scythians as recorded by Ptolemy. In Lat. $66^\\circ$ a tract has been discovered the inhabitants of which resemble wild animals, as mentioned [29] by him in the Geographia. The remaining portion of the quarter of the globe is according to some, a tenantless waste, while others regard it as simply unknown country. In Lat. $54^\\circ$ and a fraction, the longest day is 17 hours; in Lat. $58^\\circ$, 18 hours; in Lat. $61^\\circ$, 19 hours; in Lat. $63^\\circ$, 20 hours; in Lat. $64^\\circ 30'$, 21 hours; in Lat. $65^\\circ$ and a fraction, 22 hours; and in $66^\\circ$ 23 hours, and in the latitude, equal to the complement of the sun's greatest declination from the equator, 24 hours. In Lat. $67^\\circ$ the day increases by one month, in Lat. $70^\\circ$, $1\\frac{3}{4}$ months; in Lat. $73^\\circ 30'$, three months; in Lat. $78^\\circ 30'$, four months; in Lat. $84^\\circ$, five months, and in the Lat. $90^\\circ$ which is the extremity of the\nearth, the day is said to be of six months, and the other six months is night. But it is more correct to say that a year is one nycthemeron. If the day be reckoned from sunrise to sunset, the day there would be seven nycthemera longer than the nights, but if it be calculated from the dawn of light and the disappearance of the fixed stars, to the occultation of light and the reappearance of the stars, the day there would be seven months and seven days and the remainder (of the year) night.

It was visited by Ibn Batutah (IV, 269), called by the translators Thsiuantchoufou.\n\nSufarah, China, Long. 104\u00b055, Lat. 19\u00b020.\u2014There are but two of this name in Abulf., one in Africa below Zanzibar, the other in India, a flourishing port known for its fisheries and pearls, five marches from Sind\u0101n.\n\nSind\u0101n in China, Long. 114\u00b020, Lat. 19\u00b050.\u2014In Abulf., another reading is said to be Sindapur, placed by one authority at 3 days' march from T\u0101nah on the frontier between Guzerat and Malabar. Another account places it within 15 parasangs of Mansurah. Y\u0101qut places it between Daybul and Mansurah.\n\nKh\u0101nku in China, Long. 150, Lat. 14.\u2014This is on the Hangtcheou. Abulf.

If this be the Yang-tsze-kiang, the towns of Hangkow and Hwang-choo seem to answer this description, as Abulf. says that T\u0101jah (Taichow) is to E. of Khanjow. Their identification is not attempted by Guyard.\n\nSand\u0101bil in China, a city of the first magnitude, Caret.\u2014Not mentioned by Abulf., but this is evidently a corruption of Kh\u0101nb\u0101ligh, a well-known name of Pekin, already mentioned in Vol. II, p. 118, see De Guig, Hist. des Huns. III, 147. Y\u0101qut\ndescribes Sand\u0101bil in terms that leave no doubt as to its identity. It is the Cambalu of Marco Polo. *Ency.

See D\u2019Herbelot.\n\nSof\u0101lah of India, here is found a bird that talks better than a parrot. Of this town Gildemeister says, (*De Reb.

L\u0101njuyah, according to Y\u0101qut is a large island, capital of the Zanj kingdom, frequented by ships from every port, now deserted, the inhabitants who are Muslims having moved to another island called Tambatu. He also mentions the fruitfulness of its vines. This is the island of Zanzibar, which in Cust\u2019s map (*Modern Language of Africa*) is marked Ungujah.\n\nAlanjah, one of the towns of north Africa, has an emerald mine . . . I find no other trace of this name, but it is again referred to under the 2nd Climate as an emerald mine. The *Nuzhat ul Musht\u0101q* says that near Assouan south of the Nile, there is a mountain with an emerald mine and this gem is found alone here.\n\nShil\u0101 (or Shabl\u0101)\u2014A district called Shilha is marked in Cust\u2019s map of North Africa, opposite the Canaries and stretches towards the Mediterranean.\n\nQulzum on the Red Sea littoral.\u2014The ancient Clysm\u0101.

Niebuhr (p. 225) treats of the allied clans of Hashid and Bakil at some length and gives their romantic origin. Y\u0101qut speaks of this tree without naming it, and says it is as much or more prized and guarded by the people there than the balsam by the Egyptians. It was in special request for removing crowned heads, and the chiefs of the Bani Najah and their ministers are distinguished by having been the frequent subjects of experiment as to the deadly effects of its poison.\n\nKa'\u0101rah.\u2014A village in Yemen, in the neighbourhood of Damar.

The Takrur country corresponds, according to Reinaud, with the region of which Timbuctoo is the principal town. Ency. Islam, iv. 632.\n\nR\u0101mani.\u2014Y\u0101qut gives a village of this name two leagues distant from Bokhara, now in ruins.

Sana'a has already been given, and the Medinah par excellence comes in the next climate, with a similar epithet somewhat differently written. For the holy Medina of the Prophet, Ency. Islam, iii. 83.\n\nSahar, in Yemen.\u2014Niebuhr gives the name with a different spelling Shahr, as a small coast town in Yemen in the province of Yafa' from which incense is exported. Abulf. places it between Aden and Dhafar,\nTHE SECOND CLIMATE\n\nSus al Aqsa, Long. 15\u00b030', Lat. 22.\u2014Sus the remote, was so named from its situation at the extreme of Mauritania. It was a town according to D'Herb. at the foot of mount Atlas and was also called Taroudant, but Abulf. makes the latter the capital of Sus. It would cover the extent now known as Morocco. Ency. Islam, iv. 568.\n\nLamtah, do., called also Nawa, Long. 17\u00b030', Lat. 27.\u2014Lamtah and Lamtun\u0101 are two Berber tribes in the south of Morocco. Ency. Islam, iii. 14-15. The home town of the former is called Nul (?=Nawa.)\n\nDar'ah, do., Long. 21\u00b06', Lat. 27\u00b010'.\u2014Ibn Sayd says it stands on the river Dar'ah.

Another account makes it a large tract of which the capital goes by the same name and is situated on the mountains S. of Sejelm\u0101sah and 40 marches distant. Major Rennel supposes it to be the modern town of Aghades, N.W. of the Lake Tchad.\n\nT\u0101khm\u0101bah, Long. 32\u00b015', Lat. 25\u00b015'.\u2014I do not find this name.

Ptolemy places this in Long. 66\u00b0, Lat. 29\u00b015'.\n\nIsland of Suli, off Hij\u0101z, Long. 81\u00b0, Lat. 25\u00b015'.\u2014See this name in the 1st Climate.

But its position in Abulfeda seems to mark it as the I. of Sumak in the Bahrein Gulf. In Istakhri's peculiar geographical map, it is located as one of 3 large islands in a sea which no imagination can shape into the semblance of any waterway of the world.\n\nIsland of Sil\u0101b, Long. 88\u00b030', Lat. 25.\u2014I do not trace the name.\n\nHormuz, Long. 92, Lat. 25.\n\nJir\u0101f, Long. 98, Lat. 27\u00b030.\u2014A flourishing town in Kirm\u0101n; a rendezvous for merchants from Khur\u0101s\u0101n and Sijist\u0101n, 4 days' march from Hormuz.

It is 3 marches N. of Aleppo, and at no great distance is the ruined fortress of Doluk, which name frequently recurs in the history of the wars between Saladin and Nur-u\u2019ddin. Doluk or Delouc as he writes it, De Sacy identifies with the ancient Doliche, (Chrest.

Y\u0101qut gives the origin of its name from the abandonment of the town by the male population on the advance of the Muhammadans. Seeing no men, but only women, they exclaimed. \"These are women, let us go and fight elsewhere,\" and the name Nis\u0101 or Nasa was thus commemorated.

It fell into ruin and was replaced by Yahudiyyah, a mile distant from Shahrist\u0101n and two from Jayy. The name of Yahudiyyah arose from the tradition that Nabuchadnezzar, after the destruction of Jerusalem transported its inhabitants to Isfah\u0101n. Jayy-Isfahan fell into decay, but the Jewish quarter prospered. This tradition according to Guyard is to be found in the Talmud, v. Abulf. II. II. 160.

Abu Bakr al-Harawi who saw it, says that it is situated at the foot of a mountain, the entrance to it being through the gate of a fort. A subterranean passage leads to a wide space in the side of a hill with an aperture to the sky. In the middle is a pool round which are houses or chambers for the peasantry, whose fields are without. A church and a masjid are hard by for the needs of both religions. In the Crypt are several dead men with marks of spear and sword wounds, the bodies dressed in cotton garments. In another spot four bodies are buried with their backs against the wall and with them a boy whose hand is on the head of a very tall man, the face of the latter is sallow, the palm of the hand open as if he were about to take the hand of another, and the head of the boy leaning on his breast. By his side is a man with his upper lip cut\nopen, showing his teeth. They all wear turbans. The body of a woman suckling her child is near. Five other bodies are standing with their backs against a wall, and apart on an eminence is a couch on which are 12 men and a boy, whose hands and feet are stained with *hinna*. The Greeks claim them as their own people but the Muhammadans say that they are Muslims, slain in the wars of Omar b-ul Khatt\u0101b. Some pretend that their nails have grown long and that their heads are shaven. This is not the case, but their skins have dried and shrivelled on their bones without other alteration.\" I suppose this to be Prusa ad Olympium in Bythinia, the modern Brusa, but the history of this town affords no clue to the above narrative and Ibn Batutah, who describes it under the name of Barsi, (II. p. 321) makes no mention of a curiosity which would scarcely have escaped his notice.

The excess difference between each is multi-\n\n---\n\n36 In his XXI Chap. of the Indica, Albiruni refers to several of his publications in which the method of finding the distances has been worked out. These are not repeated, but he gives the calculation of the des\u0101ntara, i.e., difference between the places according to the Hindu method as reported by Alfaz\u0101ri, in his Canon, viz., \"Add together the squares of the sines of the latitudes of the two places and take the root of the sum. This root is the portio. Further square the difference of these two sines and add it to the portio. Multiply the sum by 8 and divide the product by 377. The quotient is the distance between the two places according to a rough calculation. On this Albiruni remarks, \"This method is found in the astronomical books of the Hindus, in conformity with the account of Alfaz\u0101ri save in one particular. The here-mentioned portio is the root of the difference between the squares of the sines of the two latitudes, not the sum of their squares.\" I do not find the calculation mentioned by Abul Fazl, of this astronomer.\nplied into itself and the products which are called squares (for the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself) are set down and the two squares added together and their square root extracted. This root is then multiplied into $56\\frac{2}{3}$ Karoh which is the extent of a degree according to the moderns, or into $66\\frac{2}{3}$ which is the degree according to the ancients, and the product is the distance of the two places from each other. As long as a variation in the extent of longitudes and latitudes arises, the excess is multiplied proportionately and the result ascertained; where the longitudes and latitudes are equal, the rule does not hold good. This distance is calculated on the straight line, but some discrepancy will occur from the curve in direction. Abu Raih\u0101n Biruni has calculated this approximately and added a fifth of the result found.\n\n**Singular Results Arising from Accident of Location.**\n\nAt the equator all the stars rise and set and the periods of both are equal. Night and day are constant in twelve hours each, and the movement of the celestial sphere is circular. In the first of Aries and Libra the sun is in the zenith and casts two shadows, and at these two periods where the temperature is equable over the greater part of the oikoumeny, at the equator the heat is excessive and the gnomon has no shadow. When the sun passes the first of Aries and inclines to the north, the shadow is thrown to the south, and when he passes the first of Libra and moves southwards, the shadow is cast to the north. The year has six seasons. Two summers, from the 1st\u00b0 of Aries to the 15th\u00b0 of Taurus, and from the 1st\u00b0 of Libra to the 15th\u00b0 of Scorpio; two winters, from the 1st\u00b0 of Cancer to the 15th\u00b0 of Leo, and from the 1st\u00b0 of Capricorn, to the 15th\u00b0 of Aquarius. At the change of the Sun into Cancer, the temperature rises in the climatic zones inclined from the equator, whereas at the equator it is the beginning of winter. It has also two springs, from the\n16th\u00b0 of Leo to the end of Virgo, and from the 16th\u00b0 of Aquarius to the end of Pisces; and two autumns, from the 16th\u00b0 of Taurus to the end of the Gemini and from the 16th\u00b0 of Scorpio to the end of Sagittarius. Avicenna and some learned men maintain that the equator is the most equable in temperature of all countries, because the seasons of cold and heat follow in close succession and the sun does not remain long in the zenith. Fakhr-R\u0101zi\\(^{37}\\) and another school select the fourth climate and say that \"although the sun's stay in the zenith is but for a short period, on the other hand he is never more remote than 23 degrees and a fraction, and we observe that in places where the greatest altitude of the sun is less than its altitude at the equator, as for instance at Khwarizm, where his altitude on the first of Cancer is 71\u00b0 which is 5\u00b0 lower than his altitude at the equator, the people are much inconvenienced by the heat, while at the equator it is the cold season. But as the altitude there is 5\u00b0 greater, it follows that the winter of the equator should be hotter than the summer of Khwarizm; what then would its summer be? And the colour and appearance of the Ethiopians who are near the zone of the equator support this view.\" The partisans of each school maintain their several opinions at considerable length. The true resolution is this, that equability in the sense of approximate similarity of conditions is more apparent at the equator, and great heat on account of this assimilation, is to a certain extent unfelt, because the sensations caused by physical impressions succeeding each other rapidly have less force, while sensations directly antagonistic are more perceptible though disregarded in view of the equality in the constant proportions of heat and cold. In the first mentioned sense, therefore, Avicenna is correct, while in\n\n\\(^{37}\\) Abu Bakr, Ency. Islam, iii. 1134 under ar-R\u0101zi. Muhammad Ibn Zakariyy\u0101 ar R\u0101zi is known in the Schools of Medicine of the middle ages as Rasis, Rhazes or Rhazis, b. 864, d. 925 A.D., as distinguished in Philosophy, Chemistry and Astronomy as in Medicine.\nthe latter, the opinion of Ar R\u0101zi is tenable. Every place which has not the equinoctial and its pole directly in the zenith is accounted among climatic zones inclined from the equator, and these are specially differentiated in five classes. The first is in a latitude less than the greatest declination of the Sun from the equator; the latitude of the second is equal to the greatest declination; that of the third is greater than the declination but less than its complement measured from the equator; that of the fourth is equal to the complement; that of the fifth is greater than the complement but less than $90^\\circ$. In the first, the sun is twice in the zenith, from the 1st of Aries to Cancer and from the 1st of Cancer to Libra and casts here also two shadows. In the second he is only once in the zenith, in Cancer. Here and in the remaining zones where the sun does not culminate, the shadow is thrown to the north. At the spot where the pole of the equinoctial is directly perpendicular it is $90^\\circ$ and the movement of the celestial sphere is like a mill. The year there forms a nycthemeron as has already been explained. There is no doubt that the fabled darkness\\(^{38}\\) which is the tradition of the vulgar, refers to the gloom of these nights. The points of the east, west, north and south are not here distinguishable.\n\nSome divide the oikoemeny into three parts. The first is from the equator to a position the latitude of which is equal to the greatest declination of the sun from the equator. The inhabitants of this region are called Sud\u0101n (blacks), because the sun shining directly above them, they are coloured by its rays and their hair is curly. Those who dwell proximate to the equator are called Zingis.\\(^{39}\\) They are\n\n\\(^{38}\\) Ency. Islam, ii. 862, under al-Khadir. It is here that eastern fable locates the fountain of the water of life, which the mythical prophet, saint, or bard al Khidr is said to have discovered and tasted, and received his immortality.\n\n\\(^{39}\\) The inhabitants of Zanguebar, including the \"Zingis\" of Ptolemy near the entrance of the Red Sea and a large portion of inner Africa, v. Lane. Lex,\nabsolutely black and scarce resemble human beings. Those who live near the region of the greatest declination, are less swarthy and being of moderate stature and equable disposition are more of a class with the natives of Hindustan, and Yemen and some of the Mauritanian Arabs. The second is the region of which the latitude extends from the greatest declination to a quarter parallel with the Great Bear.\\(^{40}\\) The colour of its inhabitants is inclined to fairness and as the sun does not shine perpendicularly above them and yet is never far removed, their bodies are fashioned in a naturally-adjusted mean, as the Chinese, the Turks, and the people of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, Ir\u0101q, Persia and Syria. Of this race, those who dwell nearest to the south have a subtler intellect because they are nearer the zodiac and the orbits of the five planets, while those are of a more powerful build who inhabit the regions to the west. Proximity to the east produces a softness of frame and by such as these great deeds are never accomplished. The third region is parallel with the orbit of the Great Bear such as the country of the Sclavonians and Russians, and as it is distant from the Zodiac and little affected by the heat of the sun, the cold impels to hardihood, moisture is predominant, and natural living products do not mature. Their colour is fair, their hair red and worn long, their bodies sleek, their temper fierce and their disposition inclined to evil. Hermes,\\(^{41}\\) the most\n\n\\(^{40}\\) According to the Vishnu Dharma, the orbit of the Great Bear lies under the pole: under it the orbit of Saturn: then that of Jupiter: next, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon. They rotate towards the east like a mill in a uniform motion peculiar to each star, some moving rapidly, others slowly. Albiruni criticises this statement with his usual intelligence. See Indica, Chap. XXVII, Sachau, p. 288.\n\n\\(^{41}\\) The Hermetic books are said by Fabricius to be the forgeries of a Jew or of a semi-Platonic semi-Christian writer of about the 2nd century after Christ. Hermes Trismegistus himself is a fiction of the Neo Platonists and was the offspring of the Oriental and Hellenic philosophies. He was the supposed mystic author of all knowledge and the author, on the authority of Manetho, of 36,525 books. His principal works published under this name are given in the Class. Dict. of Dr. W. Smith.\ncelebrated of the name, divides the earth into seven parts analogous with the seven spheres, one within the other. The first towards the south is the continent of India: the second, Arabia, Yemen, and Abyssinia: the third, Egypt, Syria and Mauritania: the fourth, Persia: the fifth, the Greeks, Slavonians, Franks: the sixth, the Turks and the Khazars: the seventh, China, Khotan and Tibbet.\n\nIt is said that Noah apportioned the length of the habitable globe into three lots. The southern he gave to Ham, and this is the country of [50] the blacks and the Arabs: the northern to Japhet, where the fair-skinned, ruddy faced races dwell: the middle portion was assigned to Shem, inhabited by the wheat-coloured people. Feridun divided the breadth of his dominions into three parts; the eastern he gave to Tur: the western to Salm and the intermediate tract to Iraj. Some of the Greeks have made two sections of the habitable earth latitudinally from Egypt. The eastern they call Asia, the western which is the Mediterranean Sea, they subdivide into two, that on the south being named Libya, the country of the negroes, and that on the north Europe\\textsuperscript{42} where dwell the white and ruddy-complexioned races. Bisecting Asia from the angle between the east and north transversely in a southerly direction, they divide it into two segments, of which the inner is the less and the outer the greater. The middle is called Asia Minor and comprises the country of Ir\u00e4n, Hij\u00e1z, Yemen and Khur\u00e1s\u00e4n. The outer is Asia Major, comprising China,\\textsuperscript{43} India and Sind. Some say that Hindu philosophers\n\n\\textsuperscript{42} This tripartite division into Europe Asia and Libya was unknown to Homer, and the earliest allusions to it are found in the writers of the 1st half of the 5th century B.C., viz., Aeschylus and Pindar and the logographers Hecataeus and Pherecydes; v. Art Asia, Smith C. D. Herodotus discusses it in Melpomene (42) with some wonder at the character of the division.\n\n\\textsuperscript{43} This partition into A. Major and A. Minor was not made, according to a writer in the Cl. Dic. till the 4th century of our era. Asia Major (A. y megaly) was part of the continent E. of the Tanais, the Euxine, an imaginary line drawn from the Euxine at Trebizond to the Gulf of Issus and the Mediterranean. It in-\npartition the habitable earth into a diagram of nine parts, viz., the south (dahkhin) the Arabian country; the north (uttar), that of the Turks; the east, (purab), China; the west, (pachchim), Egypt and Barbary; the north-east (is\u0101n), Khata and Khotan; the north-west (b\u0101yab), the Greeks and Franks; the south-west (nairit) the country of the Copts and Berbers, Africa and Spain. The middle country was called Madhyadesa. But this account is not found in this order in any Sanskrit work nor is it thus handed down by any of the learned of this country.\n\n**The Scale of Notation.**\n\n| Units up to 9 | ... | ... | Ekam. |\n|---------------|-----|-----|------|\n| 10            | 100 | ... | Dasa. |\n| 100           | 1000| ... | Sata. |\n| 1,000         | &c. | ... | Sahasra. |\n| 10,000        | &c. | ... | Ayuta. |\n| 100,000       | ... | ... | Laksh vulg. lakh. |\n| 1,000,000     | ... | ... | Prayuta. |\n| 10,000,000    | ... | ... | Koti, vulg.

Asia Minor (A. y mikra Anatolia) was the peninsula on the extreme W. of Asia, bounded by the Euxine, \u00c6gean and Mediterranean.\n\nHe has omitted the S. E. The diagram will be found in Albiruni's *Indica*, Ch. XXXIX, 262, Sachau, with the authorities. Abul Fazl's ill-digested knowledge is heaped up indiscriminately without order or method and without heed or consciousness of the worthlessness of so much of it.\nThe Brahmans have not more than eighteen places of notation, the first being units, *Ekam*, and the rest proceeding by multiples of ten. All above units have a separate designation as above noted, thus differing from the Greek compounds of notation. An intervening number of this scale, for instance, fifteen, is included in the second, one hundred and [52] twelve, in the third place, and so on.\\(^{45}\\) And further by the addition of eleven places to the eighteen, they reckon up to twenty-nine places and employing the terms of six of the series, the remainder are suffixed as compounds, as will be seen from what follows. Thus: Tens, hundreds, thousands, lakhs, tens of lakhs, krors; krors tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, lakhs, tens of lakhs, krors of krors; krors of krors tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands\u2014nineteen places from the unit's place, and this illustrates the foregoing description. Krors or krors tens of thousands is $1,000,000,000,000,000,000$, up to nine tens of thousands of krors of krors, and in a descending scale, nine thousand krors of krors and nine hundred so on to nine. Again, krors of krors lakhs, tens of krors of krors of lakhs, krors of krors of krors; krors of krors of krors tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, lakhs, tens of lakhs, krors of krors of krors of krors,\\(^{46}\\) which series proceeds in the manner above given.\n\nThe Greeks have their scale of notation from one to nine, and the recurring ternary series they call a cycle. Thus from one to nine are units, from ten to ninety, tens, and from one hundred to nine hundred, hundreds. This is termed the first cycle. From one thousand to nine thousand are units of\n\n\\(^{45}\\) Read the 16th Chapter of Albiruni's India in connection with this reckoning. He says some maintain a 19th order called Bhuri. According to others the limit of reckoning is *koti* and starting from *koti* the succession would be *koti*, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. Sachau has inadvertently reversed this order. Albiruni adds that *Dasa sahasra*, and *Dasa laksha* are used for the 5th and 7th orders respectively, as the terms *Ayuta* and *Prayuta* are rarely employed.\n\n\\(^{46}\\) $10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000$. Twenty-nine places from the units.\nthousands, from ten thousand to ninety thousand are tens of thousands, and from one hundred thousand to nine hundred thousand are hundreds of thousands. This they call the second cycle. And thus at the end of each cycle the word \"thousands\" is added, as for instance, the third cycle begins with units of thousands of thousands, i.e., a thousand thousand, followed by tens of thousands of thousands, i.e., ten thousand thousand up to ninety thousand thousand. Next follows hundreds of thousands of thousands, i.e., a hundred thousand thousand. The beginning of the fourth cycle is units of thousands of thousands of thousands, and so on throughout the remainder of the series. The designations in all are but three, viz., tens, hundreds, thousands, and as to what is said in ancient books of this system being borrowed from the Greeks, the version above given certainly does not support it.\n\n**The Quarters of the Globe.**\n\nThe Hindus term a quarter dis\u0101 and also dig and of these they reckon ten. Each of them they consider to be under a tutelary spirit whom they name Dig-p\u0101la as will appear in the following table:\n\n| Sanskrit name of quarter | English       | Regent |\n|--------------------------|---------------|--------|\n| Purva                    | East          | Indra. |\n| Agni                     | South-east    | Agni.  |\n| Dakshina                 | South         | Yama.  |\n| Nairrita                 | South-west    | Nairrita. |\n| Paschima                 | West          | Varuna. |\n| V\u0101yaviya                 | North-west    | Vayu.  |\n| Uttara                   | North         | Kuvera. |\n| Is\u0101na                    | North-east    | Is\u0101na. |\n| Urddhva                  | Above         | Brahma. |\n| Adhah                    | Below         | N\u0101ga.  |\n\n47 Indra is the Indian Jupiter; in Sansk. Dyaush-pitar, or that one among the many Jupiters which personified the firmament.\nSome assign a quarter to the interval between the upper and lower regions and thus reckon eleven. The regent of this is Rudra.\n\nAgni is the god of fire, and one of the most ancient objects of Hindu worship who answers to the Vulcan of Egypt. Yama in the Vedas is the god of the dead with whom the departed spirits dwell. The S.W. regent is a demon or Rakshasa. Varuna is one of the oldest vedic deities, and like its derivative Ovaranos a personification of the all-encompassing sky. The name also designates one of the lunar mansions. The god of the air, the Hindu Eolus is represented by Vayu and is associated in the Vedas with Indra, riding in the same car. Kuvera, as living in the shades and being the god of wealth, unites the characteristics of Pluto and Plutus. Isana is a name of Siva or of one of his manifestations. The serpent-worshipping Nagas may boast of their connection with or descent from this regent of the nether world. Hastings, Encyclopaedia of Religion, xi. 560, xii. 602\u2014610 and Macdonnell and B. Keith's Vedic Index. [J.S.]\nCHAPTER III.\n\nANIMAL LIFE.\n\nThis subject cannot be altogether omitted and shall be cursorily touched upon. In what relates to man, somewhat has already been set down. In distinguishing the finer shades observable in the measure of divergence in the dispositions of men in this region of the globe, investigation points to little discovery. Judges of character, generally, when considering the Hindu people, incline to the ancient opinion that each of them is a presentment of the race contained in the individual. One, from the eminence of his virtues will be beyond price; another will be dear at the basest coin. If regarded with the eyes of impartiality, the sincerely devout of this country are unlike the seekers of God in other lands and in warring with interior spiritual foes that wear the guise of friends, they are rarely to be matched. Their knowledge of affairs, capacity in execution, recklessness of valour, fidelity, especially in times of difficulty, their devoted attachment and disinterested service, and other eminent good qualities are beyond measure great. And yet there are many obdurate and pitiless spirits, devoid of gentle courtesy who for the merest trifle will rise to the shedding of blood, and marvellous are the tales told of these ravening fiends in the guise of angels.\n\nThe Hindu philosophers reckon four states of auspiciousness which they term varna.\\(^1\\) 1. Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. 2. K\u1e63atriya vulgarly, Khatri. 3. Vaisya, vulgarly Bais. 4. Sudra, vulgarly sudra. Other than these are termed Mlechchha. At the creation of the world the first of these classes was pro-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The term in its primitive meaning signifies 'colour', the Aryans from the north priding themselves on their fair complexion, in contradistinction to the 'black skin' typical of the indigenous races. The term subsequently was applied to caste.\u2014Hastings, Encyclop\u00e6dia, iii. 230-239, Muir's Sansk Texts, i., and Vedic Index (under Varna.)\nduced from the mouth of Brahma, a brief account of whom has already been given: the second, from his arms; the third, from his thigh and the fourth from his feet; the fifth from the cow K\u0101madhenu,\u00b2 the name of Mlechcha being employed to designate them.\n\nThe Brahmins have six recognised duties.\u00b3 1. The study of the Vedas and other sciences. 2. The instruction of others (in the sacred texts). 3. The performance of the Jag, that is oblation of money and kind to the Devatas. 4. Inciting others to the same. 5. Giving presents. 6. Receiving presents.\n\nOf these six the Kshatriya must perform three, 1. Perusing the holy texts. 2. The performance of the Jag. 3. Giving presents. Further they must, 1. minister to Brahmins. 2. Control the administration of worldly government and receive the reward thereof. 3. Protect religion. 4. Exact fines for delinquency and observe adequate measure therein. 5. Punish in proportion to the offence. 6. Amass wealth and duly expend it. 7. Supervise the management of elephants, horses, and cattle and the functions of ministerial subordinates. 8. Levy war on due occasion. 9. Never ask an alms. 10. Favour the meritorious and the like.\n\n[55] The Vaisy\u0101 almost must perform the same three duties of the Brahman, and in addition must occupy himself in: 1. Service. 2. Agriculture. 3. Trade. 4. The care of cattle. 5. The carrying of loads.\n\nFrom birth to the time of investiture with the sacred thread, these ten duties may be performed by all the three castes above-mentioned.\n\nThe Sudra is incapable of any other privilege than to serve these three castes,\u00b3 wear their cast-off garments and eat\n\n\u00b2 The granter of desires,' said to have been produced at the churning of the ocean, belonging to the sage Vasishtha. Called also K\u0101ma-duh, Saval\u0101 and Surabhi. Dowson.\n\n\u00b3 See these duties in the Institutes of Manu, I, 88, and ff., p. 12, Burnell's Trans.\ntheir leavings. He may be a painter, goldsmith, blacksmith, carpenter, and trade in salt, honey, milk, butter-milk, clarified butter and grain.\n\nThose of the fifth class, are reckoned as beyond the pale of religion, like infidels, Jews and the like. By the inter-marriages of these, sixteen other classes are formed. The son of Brahman parents is acknowledged as a Brahman. If the mother be a Kshatriya, (the father being a Brahman) the progeny is called Murdhavasikta. If the mother be a Vaisya, the son is named Ambastha; and if a Sudra girl, Nishada. If the father and mother are both Kshatriya, the progeny is Kshatriya. If the mother be a Brahman, (and the father a Kshatriya) the son is called Suta. If the mother be a Vaisya, the son is Mahisya. If the mother be a Sudra, the progeny is Ugra. If both parents be Vaisya, the progeny is Vaisya. If the mother be a Brahman, (which is illicit) the progeny is Vaideha but if she be a Kshatriya, which also is regarded as improper, he is M\u0101gadha. From the Vaisya by a Sudra mother is produced a Karana. When both parents are Sudra, the progeny is Sudra. If the mother be a Brahman, the progeny is Chandala. If she be a Kshatriya, it is called Chatta. From a Sudra by a Vaisya girl is produced the Ayogava.\n\nIn the same way still further ramifications are formed, each with different customs and modes of worship and each with infinite distinctions of habitation, profession, and rank of ancestry that defy computation.\n\n4 These names and many other variations of the progeny of inter-marriages will be found in the tenth chapter of the Institutes of Manu. The management of horses and driving wagons, is therein said to be the occupation of Sutas; the practice of medicine that of Ambasthas; attendance on women, that of Vaidehakas; trade that of M\u0101gadhas; killing fish that of Nish\u0101das; carpentry of Ayogavas. Catching and killing animals that live in holes, is the occupation of Ksattars, Ugras, and Pukkasas.\n\n5 According to Burnell, (X. 306) the term is Ksattar, Sir W. Jones writes Cshattri. Muir (Sans. Texts, I. 174), Kshattri.\nThe Brahmans, in regard to the study of the Vedas, are of four classes, and each occupies himself with the perusal of a special sacred work. There are twenty ways of reading the Rigveda; the Yajurveda has eighty-six; the S\u0101maveda, one thousand, and the Atharvaveda, five, and their several disciples fall into distinct categories. There may be also ten distinctions of Brahmans, according to their occupations.\n\n1. Deva. 2. Muni. 3. [56] Dvi-ja. 4. R\u0101j\u0101. 5. Vaisya. 6. Sudra. 7. Bid\u0101laka. 8. Pasu. 9. Mlechchha. 10. Chand\u0101la.\n\nThe first named perform the Hom for themselves, not for others, and give presents, but do not receive them, and learn, but do not teach. The second perform the Hom for others as well as for themselves and receive gifts and teach. The third class have twelve distinctive notes,\u2014The six aforesaid and 7. Meekness. 8. Restraint of the five senses from things unlawful. 9. Unshrinking from austerities. 10. Attachment to the precepts of the Vedas. 11. Taking no life. 12. Attributing the possession of nothing to themselves. The fourth class perform the same offices as the Kshatriya. The fifth, those of the Vaisya. The sixth, those of the Sudra. The seventh class have the characteristic of cats,\n\n* According to Albiruni, Vy\u0101sa divided the Veda into the four parts named below, and to each of his four pupils, he taught a separate Veda to be learnt by heart. They are enumerated in the same order as the four parts of the Veda: Paila Vaisamp\u0101yana, Jaimini, Sumantu.\n\nThis oblation consists in casting clarified butter, etc., into the sacred fire as an offering to the gods, with invocations and prayers according to the object of sacrifice.\n\nThe three castes of the Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaisya, were called, dvi-ja, twice-born, from their title to investiture with the sacred thread which literally constitutes the second birth, but the term is particularly applied to the Brahmans, who maintain that their caste alone remains, the other three having been lost or degraded and it is generally accepted that the pure Kshatriya or Vaisya does not now exist. The intercourse and inter-marriage of various castes have produced the mixed castes called Varna-Sankara, see Dowson, 336.\n\n* The Bid\u0101laka, from Sanskrit.\ngo from door to door and mix with high and low. The eighth, like brutes, know not good from evil. The ninth follow the practices of the Mlechchhas (barbarians or non-Aryans), and the tenth are low outcasts and eat carrion.\n\nThe Kshatriya form two races, the Surajbansi (Solar dynasty) and the Somabansi (Lunar dynasty). The first mentioned are descendants of the Sun. It is said that by the volition of Brahma, Marichi was created who begot Kasyapa (Muni), from whom the Sun (Vivasv\u0101n or Surya) sprung. From him was produced Vaivaswata from whose nose Ikshv\u0101ku came forth by a sneeze and from him the succeeding generations proceeded. Three princes of this race ruled the world and extended their dominion over the seven climes. These were R\u0101j\u0101 Sagara, R\u0101j\u0101 Khatw\u0101nga, and R\u0101j\u0101 Raghu.\n\nThe second race is descended from the Moon. From Brahma was born Atri, from whose right eye came forth the Moon (Soma) who begot Mercury (Budha) and from him proceeded the succeeding generations. Two princes of this race held universal sway, namely, R\u0101j\u0101 Yudhisthira and R\u0101j\u0101 Sat\u0101nika. There are more than five hundred tribes of the Kshatriyas of whom fifty-two are preeminently distinguished and twelve are of considerable importance. At the present day, no trace of the true Kshatriya exists. Some of their descendants, abandoning the profession of arms, have taken\n\n---\n\n* The Pasu from Sansk.\n\n10 Abul Fazl's names and transliterations are incorrect. I substitute the true readings of the names as far as I am able to discover them.\n\n11 Notices of these three legendary princes will be found in Dowson. After Raghu the line practically loses its original name of the Surajbansi and is known as Raghubansi or Raghu-bansa from whom R\u0101ma Chandra descended and whose epic the Raghu-vansa in 19 cantos was sung by K\u0101lid\u0101sa. Sagara was a king of Ayodhy\u0101 and his wife Sumati was delivered of a gourd containing 60,000 seeds which became embryos and grew. The anxious father placed them on milk but afterwards provided each with a nurse and at ten months' old they were all able to run about.\nto other occupations and this class is known to the world by this name. Another body of them adopting the sword as their calling are designated R\u0101jputs, and are divided into thousands of septs. I record the names of a few of the most renowned, that are now in His Majesty's service.\n\n[57] 1. The R\u0101thor; there are several tribes of this clan in service. They number sixty thousand cavalry and two hundred thousand infantry. 2. The Chauh\u0101n are divided into several branches, viz., Sungira, Khichi, Deora, H\u0101d\u0101, and Narb\u0101n. The troops of the clan number fifty thousand cavalry and two hundred thousand infantry. 3. The Panw\u0101r. In ancient times, of this tribe was the royal dynasty in Hindust\u0101n, and it numbered many clansmen. At the present time their force consists of twelve thousand cavalry and sixty thousand foot. 4. The J\u0101don. Fifty-thousand cavalry and two hundred thousand foot. 5. Bh\u0101ti. 6. J\u0101rejah. 7. Januhah, to which clan the Kh\u0101nz\u0101dahs of Mew\u0101t belong. 7. Gehlot. Twenty thousand cavalry and three hundred thousand foot. 8. Sesodia. 9. Chandr\u0101wat. 10. The Kachhw\u0101hah, who are celebrated among the R\u0101jputs, and number twenty thousand cavalry, and one hundred thousand infantry. 11. The Solankhi. Thirty thousand cavalry and one hundred thousand infantry. 12. Parih\u0101ra. 13. Tonwar, for a time the sovereignty of this country rested in this tribe. They number ten thousand horse and twenty five thousand foot. 14. Badgujar. Ten thousand horse, and forty thousand foot. Each of these tribes claim an ancestry traced back to hundreds of thousands of years, a source of splendid pride to the intelligent judgment and is indeed a theme far above the level of an idle tale to distract the mind.\n\nThe Vaisya and the Sudra are in the same way divided into numerous branches. For instance, there is one caste of\n\n---\n\n12 Sherring gives the names of twenty-four branches, I, Chap. V. The deeds of many of these famous clans are preserved by Tod in his R\u0101jasth\u0101n.\nthe Vaisyas called Banik, more commonly termed Baniy\u0101, (grain-merchant). The Persians name them Bakk\u0101l and of these there are eighty-four divisions.\n\nThere are besides troops of astonishing sorcerers, cunning jugglers, [58] wonder-working magicians, and conjurers of such sleight of hand, performing such extraordinary feats that not the vulgar alone, but the acutest minds are deceived into a belief in their miraculous powers. For instance, one of them will say in broad day-light to one of the spectators: \"I have just returned from heaven, and having there been assured of your honour and probity, I entrust my wife to your care.\" Then placing her in his charge, he takes a coil of rope of untanned hide, one end of which he holds in his hand, and flings the coil to such a height that the other end becomes invisible. By means of this he mounts up and is lost to sight. After a little time his limbs one after the other come falling from above, upon which the woman, after their national rite, burns herself in presence of the spectators and is consumed to ashes. In a brief space of time, the man himself reappears and claims his charge. The spectators relate to him what has happened which he affects to disbelieve, and hastening to the house of the person to whom he had entrusted her, calls to his wife from the door. She comes forth, giving thanks for his safety, and leaves the spectators in bewilderment. Again he will cut a man up into forty pieces, and cover him over with a sheet. Then at his summons, the man will appear unhurt and answer for his reality.13\n\n13 Similar performances are described by Ibn Batutah who witnessed them at an entertainment of the Viceroy of Khansa (Kinsay of Polo). Another witness to similar feats is Edward Melton, an Anglo-Dutch traveller who was present at a like scene in Batavia in 1670, where the limbs that fell successively were caught up and cast into a basket. The last fragment was the head and no sooner had it touched the ground than the man who had gathered up the limbs into the basket, turned them all out topsy turvy. Melton continues as follows: \"Then straightway we saw with these\nOr, he will place some grains of mustard seed in the palm of his hand, and by some incantation, will make it straight way shoot and bear leaves and fruit. In the same way they will produce mangoes and melons out of season. In short, the marvels of their sorceries, and snake-charming and the like, are beyond expression.\n\nLANGUAGES.\n\nThroughout the wide extent of Hindustan, many are the dialects that are spoken, and the diversity of those that do not exclude a common inter-intelligibility are innumerable. Those forms of speech that are not understood one of another, are the dialects of Delhi, Bengal, Mult\u0101n, M\u0101rw\u0101r, Gujar\u0101t, Teling\u0101nah, Marhatta, Karn\u0101tik, Sind, Afgh\u0101n of Sh\u0101l (between Sind, K\u0101bul, and Qandah\u0101r), Beluchist\u0101n, and Kashmir.\n\nFAUNA.\n\nA summary description of the noblest of the animal creation having been given, I proceed to notice the lower types of animal life.\n\nThe Ban-m\u0101nus is an animal like a baboon, dark in colour, and in stature and face resembling a human being and eyes, all those limbs creep together again, and in short, form a whole man who at once could stand and go just as before without showing the least damage. Never in my life was I so astonished as when I beheld this wonderful performance and I doubted now no longer that these misguided men did it by the help of the Devil.\" The Memoirs of the Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br furnish further testimony of similar performances by seven jugglers from Bengal. In one feat, a man is severed limb from limb and decapitated and reproduced from under a sheet. In the other the Emperor says, \"They produced a chain 50 cubits in length and threw one end of it towards the sky where it remained as if fastened to some thing in the air. A dog was brought forward and being placed at the lower extremity of the chain, immediately ran up and disappeared in the air. In the same manner, a hog, a panther, a lion and a tiger were successively sent up and all equally disappeared. At last they took down the chain and put it into a bag, no one discovering in what way the different animals were made to vanish. Yule's Marco Polo. (Ed. 1871), p. 281.\nwalks on two feet. Although it has no tail, its body is slightly covered with hair. One of these was brought to His Majesty from Bengal which performed the most astonishing antics. Elephants, lions,\\textsuperscript{14} leopards, panthers, tigers, bears, wolves and dogs of various breeds, and monkeys, lynxes, hyenas, jackals, foxes, otters, cats, white and tawny and even winged that will fly for a short distance, and other kinds of animals are numerous. \\textit{Sardul} is the name of an animal smaller than a dog but preys upon lions and other wild beasts. Through the encouragement of His Majesty, the breed of horses is as fine as those of Ir\u0101k and Arabia. The rhinoceros is a stupendous creature. He is twice the size of a buffalo and much resembles a horse in armour. His feet and hoofs are like those of an elephant, and his tail similar to a buffalo's, and he has a pastern-joint like a horse. On the point of his snout he carries a single horn and his hide is so thick that an arrow will not pierce it. Of this, breast-plates and shields and the like are made, and he is bold enough to charge a man on horseback. The black antelope, has two long horns and for beauty and swiftness is unrivalled among his kind. The deer, from which the musk is taken, is larger than the fox, and his coat is rough. He shows two tusks and protuberances in place of horns. They are common in the northern mountains. The Y\u0101k approximates to the domestic cow but of its\n\n\\textsuperscript{14} Lions are mentioned, according to Lassen, in the oldest Indian writings. They have now nearly disappeared, as they have from Persia, Syria, Asia Minor and Macedonia. Alexander found them in the Eastern Panjab. Lassen supposes the tiger to have advanced as the lion disappeared. The Indian hounds were famous and a Babylonian satrap had so many that four villages were specially taxed for their maintenance. They were considered worthy to be presented to Alexander the Great by king Sopeithes. See Lassen's note on this.\n\nThe winged cat is probably the flying squirrel which Mr. Routledge informs me is called by the natives \\textit{urti billi}.\n\n\\textit{Sardul} in Sanskrit signifies a tiger, but here is perhaps meant some species of wild dog which in packs of 6 or 7 will hunt down the fiercest game.\ntail is made the kut\u0101s\\textsuperscript{15} or fringed tassel, and many they join together.

Its name is from its cry of koil-koil which increases in volume of sound as it goes on. The female lays its eggs in the nest of the common crow, generally only one and sometimes destroys the eggs of the crow at the time of depositing her own. The crows appear to be aware of the fact when too late and often pursue these cuckoos with great fury.\n\n\\textsuperscript{19} Coccytea Melanoleucos, Jerdon. The piedchested cuckoo. It is found all over India, and is above of a uniform black with a greenish gloss. Jerdon unromantically describes it as very noisy with a high pitched metallic note, which would appear highly calculated to reopen any old wounds or cause a fresh one. It is best known in Hindu poetry under the name of Ch\u0101tak.\nnote and its plaintive strain is heard oftenest at night, and makes love's unhealed wounds bleed anew. It is from its note that the word *piu* is taken, which in Hindi signifies 'beloved.'\n\nThe *H\u0101r\u012bl* has green plumage with a white bill and crimson irides, smaller than the ordinary pigeon. It never settles upon the ground and when it alights to drink, it carries with it a twig which it keeps beneath its feet till its thirst is quenched.\n\nThe *Baya* is like a wild sparrow but yellow. It is extremely intelligent, obedient and docile. It will take small coins from the hand and bring them to its master and will come to a call from a long distance. Its nests are so ingeniously constructed as to defy the rivalry of clever artificers.\n\nThe astonishing feats which the animals of this country can perform and their beautiful variety of colouring is beyond the power of my inexperience to describe. Former romancers have related stories in abundance of their extraordinary characteristics, but the writer of this work mentions nothing that he has not himself seen or heard from accurate observers.\n\nI write of things within my ken,\nNor tell a twice-told tale again.\n\n---\n\n20 Also *Hariy\u0101l*, the *Crocopus Ph\u00e6nicopterus*, or Bengal Green Pigeon, (Jerdon). The text is evidently in error, omitting the negative before the word 'settles', which stultifies the sense of what follows.\n\n21 *Ploceus baya* or common weaver-bird. Its long retort-shaped nest is a familiar sight in India. Jerdon says that it can be taught to pick up rings or such like articles dropped down a well or carry a note on a given signal. Mr. Blyth has seen it fire off a miniature cannon and apply the match five or six times before the powder ignited, which it finally did with a report loud enough to frighten all the crows in the neighbourhood, while the little bird remained perched on the gun without moving. In their breeding plumage, the old males have the crown of the head yellow, the rest of the upper plumage with the wings and tail, dull brown, edged with pale fulvous brown; the breast is bright yellow, but in the younger, pale rusty; while the females and the males in winter dress totally want the yellow head, the crown being brown with dark streaks.\nANIMAL LIFE\n\nWeights and Measures.\n\nMeasures.\u00b2\n\n6 Atoms = 1 Marichi.\n6 Marichi = 1 Khardal, (Brassica nigra).\n3 Khardal = 1 Sarshaf, (Brassica juncea).\n8 Sarshaf = 1 Barley corn.\n4 Barley corns = 1 Surkh (Abrus precatorius).\n6 Surkh = 1 M\u0101shah.\n4 M\u0101shah = 1 T\u0101nk.\n2 T\u0101nk = 1 Kaul.\n2 Kaul = 1 Tolchah.\n2 Tolchah = 1 Sukti.\n[60] 2 Sukti = 1 Pal.\n2 Pal = Palm of the hand.\n2 Palms = 1 Anjali, (two hands joined with the palms hollowed.\n2 Anjali = 1 Manika.\n2 Manika = 1 Prastha.\n4 Prastha = 1 Adhaka.\n4 Adhaka = 1 Drona.\n2 Drona = 1 Surpa.\n2 Surpa = 1 Kh\u0101ri.\n\nThe Kh\u0101ri of the present day is three times this measure.\n\n\u00b2 See Vol. I, p. 16, n. and p. 36, for some of these measures and the weights that follow. The 15th Chapter of Albiruni deals with the metrology of the Hindus and may be compared with these measures. I append a very valuable note by Dr. Prain, Curator of the Herbarium, Royal Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, on the distinction between the kinds of mustard called 'Khardal' and 'Sarshaf' in the text and which remarkably confirms by actual experiment the accuracy of the weights. To Dr. King, the distinguished Superintendent of the Gardens, to whom I have already expressed my many obligations in the 2nd Vol. of the work, I am again indebted for the learned co-operation of Dr. Prain.\n\n\"Khardal\" and \"Sarshaf\" are both names that are applied to BLACK-MUSTARD (BRASSICA NIGRA).\n\nThe former name is, Watt says, (in Dict. Econ. Prod. I, 521)\nJEWELLER'S WEIGHTS.\n\nThese are based on the T\u0101nk and the Surkh. A T\u0101nk is equal to twenty-four Surkh, and the ordinary Miskal is two Surkh more. The Surkh is divided into twenty parts, each part being termed a biswah. Formerly two and a half biswah were reckoned to one rice-grain, but the grains of that time were larger. His Majesty's foresight and sagacity have adjusted the proportion of two biswah to the grain. Each Surkh was equal to ten rice-grains. His Majesty in his wisdom directed that the grains should be made of the cat's eye stone and thus obviated the defect of currency. The standard weights kept ready for use are the following: the biswah, the rice-grain, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of Surkh, 2 Surkh, 3 Surkh, 6 Surkh (which is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a T\u0101nk), \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 T\u0101nk. Any other gradations may be compounded of these weights,\n\napplied, with a qualification, to WHITE MUSTARD; the latter apparently is not.\n\nThere is little doubt that by the lower unit of the two (Khardal) the seed of Black or true mustard is meant.\n\nThe question is as to the identity of the other unit.\n\nHad \"Sarshaf\" been applied to both and \"Khardal\" restricted to black mustard, one would have felt inclined to say that white mustard (Sinapis alba) was intended. But it must be remembered that white mustard is an uncommon plant in Asia; and that Boissier only speaks of it as a plant of waste places and groves in Greece, Palestine and Taurus, (not even admitting it as a Persian species) and that its seeds, though much larger than those of B. nigra, do not suit the conditions required better than those of another species to be mentioned immediately. This is Brassica juncea\u2014the well-known Indian mustard or Rai which is cultivated in Persia, as it is in India, for its oil. The vernacular names given by Watt do not include \"Khardal\" alone or qualified, but apparently the \"Sarshaf\" appears (e.g., in the Bengali name \"Rai Sarisha\") and this, therefore, seems to be the species that best suits the conditions; for Abul Fazl would be most probably referring to a well-known and common plant by his second word.\n\nAs regards the physical conditions, Rai seeds seem to suit very well, so far as the Calcutta Herbarium material goes. For in weighing 3 ripe seeds of Brassica nigra from Madeira against one ripe seed of India Brassica juncea, the scale shows very close approximation in weight; and 8 ripe seeds of Brassica juncea from India exactly balance a ripe grain of barley from Afghanistan, though a ripe barley-corn from Europe outweighs them.\nand for the imperial service, weights of cat's eye up to 140 T\u0101nks have been made of such brilliancy that they cannot be distinguished from gems.\n\n**Banker's Weights.**\n\nThese are based on the Tolchah, the M\u0101shah, and the Surkh.\n\nFormerly 6 now 7\u00bd rice-grains = 1 Surkh  \n8 Surkh = 1 M\u0101shah  \n12 M\u0101shah = 1 Tolchah.\n\nThe ordinary weights in use are \u00bd, 1, and 4 Surkh: 1, 2, 4, 6, M\u0101shah: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 Tolchah. But in the imperial Exchequer, the gradations of weight kept ready are very numerous.\n\n**Other Trade-Weights.**\n\nFormerly in Hindust\u0101n, the ser weighed 18 and in some places 22 d\u0101m. In the beginning of His Majesty's reign it was current at 28 and is now fixed at 30, each d\u0101m being 5 T\u0101nk. In the transactions in coral and camphor the d\u0101m was reckoned at 5\u00bd t\u0101nk, but the price of these articles having fallen, it is valued at five only. The weights in ordinary use are \u215b, \u00bc, \u00bd of a ser; 1, 2, 5, 10 ser; \u00bd, 1 man which consists of 40 ser.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE LEARNING OF THE HINDUS\n\n[Editor's explanation\u2014Abul Fazl wrote his Ain-i-Akbari to serve as a popular summary of or general introduction to Hindu philosophy and science for the benefit of the Muslims, and not as a help to a deeper study. In a work of this type it is useless to reprint in 1947, Col. Jarrett's long notes and quotations (made in 1895) from works on Hindu philosophy by the earliest Orientalists and his parallels from Muslim philosophy, because his authorities have long been superseded by the works of more modern scholars, and these latter books can be easily consulted in our libraries, while the obsolete works cited by Jarrett are now extremely rare. Moreover, highly specialised and erudite monographs on the different branches of Hindu learning are now easily available, and the student wishing to follow the subject up further will be much better helped and more correctly guided by references to these modern special treatises than by the mere extracts from obsolete books which Jarrett gave in the 1st edition of his translation. I have therefore omitted most of his lengthy notes and quotations. The modern student of the subject is referred to the authoritative histories of Hindu philosophy by Radhakrishnan and S. N. Das Gupta, the Grundriss monographs, and (for a shorter study) to the two best Encyclopaedias, the Encyclopaedia of Islam and Dr. Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics. Jadunath Sarkar.]\n\nThroughout the wide extent of Hindustan there are three hundred and sixty systems of philosophy and conduct. By such means is the warfare with the malice of the spirit carried on, and the hand of violence extended against the deceits of our internal foes. The desire unto evil leadeth to perdition\nand the worship of the Lord exalteth the heart. The writer of his work has mixed with many of the leaders of thought and has made himself acquainted to some extent with the discussions of the different schools. A considerable body do not rise beyond the experience of sight and hearing. They consider argument as idle discussion and accept no proof other than tradition of the past. Another school profess acceptance of demonstration, but from interior blindness remove not the rust of doubt. Another sect urge on the swift and light-paced dromedary of vision to the halting-place of truth in some questions, and from self-esteem imagine that they have likewise attained the same goal in others. And yet another body submit their intellects to those who affect stoicism and indifference, and in pursuit of their desire, lend to what is not the deceptive gloss of what is. Volumes would not contain the full tale of these. Who thinks to break his fast at the board of the parasite? But for the benefit of real seekers of knowledge, I here set down the series of fundamental systems which may be considered as nine in number and present the doctrines of each without discussion of their merits. It is my hope that inquirers may carefully study them and compare them with the principles of the Platonists, the Peripatetics, the Sufis and dogmatic theologians, and removing the obstructions of prejudice, seek alone for demonstration, and putting aside the estrangements of ignorance, exercise scrutiny with caution.\n\nIn this country there are eight sects who professedly teach the doctrines of the emanation of the world, of a life to come, of the essence and attributes of the verities that underlie superior and inferior cosmic phenomena, and the ceremonial and modes of worship and the forms of monarchial government both visible and symbolic: the ninth denies the existence of God and rejects the belief in a beginning or end of existence. Each of these have their special doctrines and rules of conduct and an ample nomenclature, but the\nsystem is that of the Greeks before the time of Aristotle. Formerly they wrote with an iron style on the leaves of the palm and the tuz, but now on paper, and from left to right. The leaves are kept separate and it is not the practice to stitch them together. Their mystic idealism enlightens the understanding and invigorates the soul. But how shall I proceed? for my heart inclines from speech to silence. Time after time, the ordinary subjects of knowledge, sinking deep into my mind oppress me to use true science, by which stair the soul might rise to insight into truth, as a means to procure rank and wealth, and again, at times, my understanding is luminously inspired not to make bread-winning and pencraft the end of knowledge. The searcher after a formula is unable to express it, of if discovered, the mind suffices not for its full cognition. For this reason, the tongue of speech adheres to the palate of silence and the head of thought sinks into the collar of depression, although it is said that he whose leisure is undisturbed, may in stillness be inspired to eloquence and the lover of taciturnity find voice though the inspired himself shall be dumb. But in truth to sully the tongue with utterance is to expose oneself to error. My own spirit is weary with discussion and my tongue oppressed by declaiming. I know not if this be lassitude of the disposition or the first revelation of truth, whether darkness overshadow my path with confusion or the leader of the caravan on this long journey be not yet arrived. Speech is a beverage filled with poison, and silence is a desert of sweet waters, the hidden source whereof flows from the possessors of truth. I have taken no quarry better than prayer and have seen no lamp brighter than silence. If my state were not one of such perplexity, and my mind not so averse from lengthened discussion, I would expound the philosophy of the Hindus after the systems of the Greeks, but as it is, in accordance with my design, I here set down what befits the scope of this work and my leisure permits.\nNaiy\u0101yika is one who is versed in the Ny\u0101ya philosophy. Vai\u015be\u1e63hika treats likewise of philosophy and its professors will be later on noticed. Ved\u0101nti is one who is conversant with the Ved\u0101nta System. Mim\u0101msaka is a follower of the Mim\u0101ms\u0101 philosophy. S\u0101\u1e45khya, P\u0101tanjala, Jaina, Bauddha, N\u0101stika. Each of these is distinct in its doctrine and their several principles will be hereafter explained. The Brahmins consider the last three as heretical and they admit no philosophical systems beyond the first six which they term shaddarsana, that is, the six modes of knowledge. The Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63hika agree in many points, as do the Ved\u0101nta and Mim\u0101ms\u0101, and the S\u0101\u1e45khya and the P\u0101tanjala.\n\nNy\u0101ya. The founder of this school was the sage Gautama. It comprises within its field, physiology, theology, mathematics, logic and dialectics. Its followers hold the Supreme Being to be exempt from plurality, neither begotten nor begetting, incorporeal and free from all defect. He is without beginning as without end, the Creator, the Preserver, and they regard Him as pure Spirit: but they assert that he created a bodily form and united Himself thereto in a determinate manner; and as the body is capable of action through its union with the soul, so does this corporeal form energize in union with the Deity without sullying the robe of its inviolable sanctity. This doctrine is akin to that of the Christians. The appellations of divinity are conceded to it, but it is not believed to be from all eternity. The Creator of the world, through the instrumentality of this Being, revealed His words unto men, and this revelation they call Veda. It [63] consists of upwards of one hundred thousand verses (sloka) each of which comprises four feet (charana) each foot being of not less than eight or more than twenty-six letters (Akshara). In this book it does not exceed twenty. An akshara consists of either one or two letters; if of two, the last is quiescent. A holy man\nnamed Vy\u0101sa divided this book into four parts to each of which he assigned a separate name, viz., the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. These four are considered divine books. Some assert that the First Being had four mouths from each of which a Book issued. Every Brahma who appears, wonderful to relate, delivers the same letters and words without diminution or addition.\n\nThey maintain that God is the absolute Efficient Cause and that the works of men are produced by these two sources of causation, (viz., God and Brahma). The moral distinctions of good and evil in actions are deduced from the divine books. They believe in hell and heaven. The former they term Naraka and locate it in the lower region. The latter is called Svarga and is assigned to the celestial region. They do not believe in a perpetual duration of existence in either paradise or hell, but that men in the measure of their evil deeds may descend into hell and receive condign punishment, and thence coming forth assume other bodies, and for their good works obtain happiness in heaven, and again issuing from it, return into new forms; thus they will come and go until they have fully received the recompense or punishment of their former deeds, after which freed from the necessity of these two states, they will be liberated from joy and sorrow as will be hereafter related.\n\nSome believe that portions of the world are from eternity and that some are created, as will be afterwards mentioned. They assign eight attributes to the Deity which they call accidents. 1. Gy\u0101na, omniscience, by which He knows the future and the past, all that is secret or manifest, in whole and in part, and ignorance and forgetfulness cannot approach Him. 2. Ichchh\u0101, will. All things at His pleasure are created or fall into nothingness. 3. Prayatna, providential order and the due procession of causes so that existence and non-existence may have their realisation. 4. Sankhy\u0101, numerical series, and this is of three kinds, unity, duality and excess.\nof these. The first named is an attribute of the Almighty.\n\n5. Pram\u0101na, extent, and this is of four kinds as will be hereinafter mentioned. As they believe God to be omnipresent, his extent must be infinite [64]. 6. Prithaktva, severalty and individuality. As of Sankhya, this is of three kinds, the first being a Divine attribute. 7. Samyoga, co-inherence, because all things unite in Him. 8. Vi-bh\u0101ga, disjunction. The last six of these are accounted to have been from all eternity.\n\nSixteen subjects called predicaments (pad\u0101rtha),\u00b9 are discussed by this system and these topics comprise all the objects of thought. Although it does not strictly proceed beyond the second, nor, indeed, beyond its subordinate classification of Artha, yet a few details are here set down for information.\n\n**The Sixteen Predicaments.**\n\n| 1 Pram\u0101na. | 2 Prameya. | 3 Sansaya. | 4 Prayojana. |\n|------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| 5 Drisht\u0101nta. | 6 Siddh\u0101nta. | 7 Avayava. | 8 Tarka. |\n| 9 Nirnaya. | 10 V\u0101da. | 11 Jalpa. | 12 Vit\u0101nd\u0101. |\n| 13 Hetv\u0101bh\u0101sa. | 14 Chhala. | 15 J\u0101ti. | 16 Nigraha-sth\u0101na. |\n\nThe First Predicament, Pram\u0101na (proof), is of four kinds.\n\n1. Pratyaksha, (perception) by the six perfect senses, viz., the five external senses together with manas which will be hereafter explained. 2. Anum\u0101na, inference. 3. Upam\u0101na, resemblance and analogy. 4. Sabda, tradition of trustworthy and pious men. These four are held to embrace a considerable extent of knowledge.\n\n\u00b9 This term is translated by Colebrooke indifferently as category or predicament, and by Dr. R\u00f6er as Category. Davies in his Hindu Philosophy, uses predicaments and categories as synonymous (p. 127) in his rendering of pad\u0101rtha. I have distinguished these sixteen subjects as predicaments to avoid confusing the numbers with the subordinate categories given by Abul Fazl under the heading of artha, the 4th classification of the second predicament, prameya.\nThe Second Predicament. *Prameya* signifies the objects of thought, and this which is beyond the reach of numeration, is yet classed under twelve heads. 1. *Atman*. 2. *Sarira*. 3. *Indriya*. 4. *Artha*. 5. *Buddhi* [65]. 6. *Manas*. 7. *Pravritti*. 8. *Dosha*. 9. *Pretyabh\u0101va*. 10. *Phala*. 11. *Dukkha*. 12. *Apavarga*.\n\nI. *Atman*, soul, is a subtile, all-pervading substance which is the seat of the understanding, and it is of two kinds. The first kind is *Jiv\u0101tman* (the vital principle), which vivifies human bodies and the animal and vegetable creation. Each body is supposed to be informed by a distinct spirit whose perceptions, through the senses and operations of the intellect, can be exercised only in conjunction with the substance *manas*\u00b2 to be subsequently explained. The second kind is *Param\u0101tman*, the Supreme Soul, which they hold to be One and from all eternity. Its intellectual cognitions are independent of the operation of *manas*.\n\nII. *Sarira*, body, is also of two kinds. *Yoni-ja* (uterine), sexually produced. *Ayoni-ja*, that which is not so produced. The first mentioned has two further subdivisions, viz., *jar\u0101yu-ja*, viviparous, and *anda-ja*, oviparous, and both are formed of the five elements. The latter, *ayoni-ja*, has four subdivisions. 1. *P\u0101rthiva*, formed of earth; 2. *Apya*, formed of water; 3. *Taijasa* of fire. 4. *V\u0101yaviya*, of air.\n\nIII. *Indriya*,\u00b3 signifies the five organs of sense together with *Manas* (the internal organ), a subtile substance intimately connected with the cone-shaped human heart. It is the source\n\n---\n\n\u00b2 The distinction between the sensitive material organ *manas* and the rational conscious soul *jiv\u0101tman*, is the *thimos* and *phr\u00e9n*, of Pythagoras, one perishing with the body, the other immortal, v. Colebrooke, *Essays*, I, 442. For the Hindu conception of the mind, see Hastings, *Encyclo.* i. 137 (*mind*), ii. 824-831 (*brain and mind*), i. 774-778 (*body and mind*), ii. 773 (*body and future life.*). The Ny\u0101ya system in *ibid.* 442 and the Atomic theory in ii. 199-201. [J. S.]\n\n\u00b3 These are: the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue and the skin; the five organs of action being the voice, the hands, the feet, the arms and the organs of generation. *Manas* or mind, is the\nof perception, and it is by its action, they consider, that a man roams in imagination through distant countries. In contradistinction to Atman, it is not considered to be all-pervading, but the Mim\u0101msa School maintain that it possesses this quality.\n\nIV. Artha (objects of sense). Under this head are seven categories [66]. 1. Dravya. 2. Guna. 3. Karman. 4. S\u0101m\u0101nya. 5. Visesha. 6. Samav\u0101ya. 7. Abh\u0101va.\n\nThe first signifies substance, which they conceive to be all-pervading and eternal, while with regard to the four elements, its indivisible atoms only are held to be eternal in duration. (It is subdivided into) Atman; Manas; Ak\u0101sa; the four elements, k\u0101la and dis.\n\nThe first two have been already mentioned. The third is a subtile fluid, all-pervading, and has the quality of sound. The four elements are recognised after the system of the Greeks, but air is regarded as the highest in order. K\u0101la organ of the bodily senses. By union with the external senses it produces knowledge of exterior objects. Its office is to separate the sensations and to present them singly to the soul; since the soul does not receive more than one perception at the same instant. The Manas is minutely small as an atom: for otherwise it might come into connection with many things or sensations at one time. It is eternal and distinct both from soul and body. Davies, Hind. Phil., pp. 21, 122.\n\nThis first category dravya (substance) is subdivided by Davies into nine divisions. 1 Earth (prithivi); 2 water (\u0101pas); 3 light (tejas); 4 air (v\u0101yu); 5 Ether (\u0101k\u0101sa); 6 time (k\u0101la); 7 space (dis); 8 Soul (\u0101tman); 9 mind (manas), p. 128.\n\nSubstance is defined by Kan\u0101da to be the substrate of qualities and actions and possessing intimate causality. This is explained in the commentary of Bh\u0101s\u0101 Parichcheda to be the substrate of qualities either in the relation of intimate union (Samav\u0101ya Sambandha) or in the relation of antecedent negation (Pr\u0101gabh\u0101va) that is, of future existence. The latter definition is to obviate an objection which may be raised from the condition of substances at the time of their production. When substances are produced, they have, according to the Ny\u0101ya, no qualities. If they have no qualities, they are no substances according to the definition that substances are the substrate of qualities. By the second definition that they are substrates of qualities either in the relation of intimate union, or of future existence, this objection is removed. Categories of the Ny\u0101ya Philosophy. Dr. E. R\u00f6er, p. 3.\ntime,\\(^5\\) is a substance impalpable and universal. *Dis*, space, has the same character.\n\nAttributes are of the following six kinds. (1) *Karman*, action, the third category, is divided into five varieties, progressive action, upward and downward action, contraction and dilatation, and is non-eternal. (2) The fourth category is *S\u0101m\u0101nya*,\\(^6\\) community, and is one, expresses existence, and denotes qualities. Its generic character is eternal, and it resides in substance, quality, and action. It is also called *J\u0101ti S\u0101m\u0101nya* (generic community) and secondly *Up\u0101dhi* (discriminative or specific) *S\u0101m\u0101nya*; it has an objective existence, having qualities common to all objects.\n\n(3) The fifth category *V\u012bse\u015bha*,\\(^7\\) particularity, is an attribute, being of its own essence dissociated from everything, has a separate resting-place, and is based only upon eternal matter. *Prithaktva*, individuality, is, on the other hand, a quality, and although it implies disjunction, it does not do so to the same degree, and is not in the same manner distinguished.\n\n(4) The sixth category, *Samav\u0101ya*, denotes the co-inherence of five entities with their correlatives, such as (1) movement and its author; (2) quality and substance; (3) matter\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) Time is inferred from the relation of priority and subsequence other than that of place. It is marked by association of objects with the sun's revolutions. Space is inferred from the relation of priority and subsequence other than that of time. It is deduced from the notion of here and there. Davies, p. 130.\n\n\\(^6\\) Davies' definition is that it expresses only existence in its highest degree, and is the source of our notion of genus. It denotes also species as indicating a class, these genera and species having a real objective existence.\n\n\\(^7\\) The difference between this and the following term is explained as follows by Prof. Cowell, \"Particularity is the individuality which characterises simple substances,\u2014it is 'their ultimate, and not further explicable difference'. All compound substances from jars down to the combination of two atoms, are mutually separated by the difference of their component parts, but particularity is the only mutual difference of atoms. This difference is differenced through itself only.\" Siddh-Muktau. Colebrooke. I. n. p. 308.\nand the thing made, as clay and the vessel of clay, yarn and its cloth; (4) the whole and its component parts; (5) particularity and eternal matter.\n\nStrangely enough they regard Samav\u0101ya\\(^8\\) as one and eternal. This school classes co-inherence under three heads. The first as mentioned above, and if it occurs between two substances, it is termed Samyoga, simple conjunction, as is stated in the mention of qualities, and they consider it to possess plurality. Secondly, the connection of the immaterial with the material, as the soul with the body. This they call Svarupa, natural form.\n\n(5) The seventh category is abh\u0101va, privation or negation, and is of two kinds. Samsarg\u0101bh\u0101va universal and anyony\u0101bh\u0101va, mutual negation between two things, as one might say \"this is not that\". This reciprocal negation must be one in time and place.\n\nThe first kind includes three species: (1), pr\u0101gabh\u0101va, antecedent negation; [67] (2), pradhanas\u0101bh\u0101va, emergent negation; (3), atyant\u0101bh\u0101va, absolute negation, that is a negation of what is not one in place, while one in time as, \"Zayd standing on the bank of the river, is lost in the desert.\"\n\n(6) Attributes that do not come under these last five categories are qualities\\(^9\\) and termed guna, (second category)\n\n---\n\n\\(^8\\) Numerically it is one, and then it is the same Samav\u0101ya that connects a jar, and its colour in India, and another jar &c., in Europe, and that connected Adam's soul with its qualities, and that of the reader's with its own. They affirm that substance may want qualities altogether as the latter are not produced till after the production of the substances themselves, so that a jar, when first produced, may be devoid of colour, smell, taste and tangibility, and in the next moment become endowed with them. A whole has no qualities, whereas its parts have, by the relation called Samav\u0101ya. Smoke is said to reside in a place by relation of Samyoga and in its parts by Samav\u0101ya. Therefore by asserting that whenever there is smoke there is fire, they contradict it by this distinction, for smoke, besides residing in a given place by Samyoga, resides by Samav\u0101ya, in its own parts, where fire is not. V. Dr. Fitz-Edward Hall, p. 94-5.\n\n\\(^9\\) Quality is closely united with substance; not, however, as an intimate cause of it, nor consisting in motion, but common: not a\nof which there are twenty-four varieties: (1), Rupa, colour (or form) of which five are elementary, namely, red, yellow, blue, black, white, the other colours being compounded of these; (2), Rasa, savour. This is of six kinds: sweet, bitter, acid, saline pungent and astringent; (3), Gandha, odour; (4), Sparsa, tangibility, that is the perception of touch which is of three kinds, cold, hot, and temperate; (5), Sankhy\u0101, number which is also of three kinds, unity, duality, and plurality; (6), Parim\u0101na, quantity, which is of four kinds, (\u03b1) anu, atomic, (\u03b2) hrasva, the measure of two atoms, also called dvya-anuka, (\u03b3) dirgha, the measure of three or more atoms, (\u03b4) mahat, (vast) the measure of the ethereal firmament and the like; (7), Prithaktva, individuality, distinguishes one of two things from the other. It is in itself common to all, and is not defined in the same manner as visesha. It is of three kinds, as for instance, \"one is unlike that\", or \"two or more are unlike it\"; (8), Samyoga, is the conjunction of two substances, eternal and non-eternal, which are united by a mutual attraction. They do not consider it to be one, like samav\u0101ya; (9), Vibh\u0101ga, disjunction; (10), Purvatva, priority in time and place; (11), Aparatva, posteriority; (12), Buddhi, intellect; (13), Sukha, pleasure; (14) Duhkha, pain; (15), Ichchh\u0101, desire; (16), Dvesha, aversion; (17), Prayatna, volition or effort; (18), Gurutva, gravity. [68] Lightness is not held to be quality, but the negation of gravity: (19), Dravatva, fluidity; (20), Sneha, viscosity; (21) Sansk\u0101ra, reproduction (of thought) which is of three kinds. (\u03b1) Vega (Sansk\u0101ra) (velocity) a quality which springs from mobility and genus, yet appertaining to one. It is independent of conjunction and disjunction, not the cause of them, nor itself endued with qualities. Colebrooke, Essays, I. 296.\n\nThis word in Sanskrit signifies, less, little, small, short, and in grammar a short vowel. Dvy-anuka, is transliterated by Abul Fazl, dinkua. Dirgha signifies the quantity of a long vowel.\n\nRajendral\u0101la Mitra in his translation of the Yogas of P\u0101tanjali thus expresses himself:\u2014\"The most important word in the aphorism is Sansk\u0101ra which has unfortunately not been\nproduces motion, like the flight of an arrow from the bow, for according to this school, motion is destroyed in the third moment after its production, and hence this quality must of necessity be called into action and produce moment.\n\n(8) (Bh\u0101van\u0101) Sansk\u0101ra thinking, is a special characteristic of the reasoning faculty, and since knowledge does not endure in the mind beyond the space of three moments of time, recourse to this quality is imperative, and through the operation of the intellect, analogy, induction or intuition becomes the effective cause of the recollection of what has passed from the mind. (7) Sthitisth\u0101paka, elasticity, that is the resilience of what is bent to the contrary direction. (22), dharma, merit, or the state of rectitude in the intelligent soul. (23), adharma, demerit. This school believes that souls through these two qualities, assume various bodily forms, and receive their due recompense in sorrow or joy. The first have their portion in Paradise: the second, in hell, and the world of death is the ultimate end of both. (24), sabda, sound.\n\nThe rational soul is distinguished by fourteen qualities: (1) intellect, (2) pleasure, (3) pain, (4) desire, (5) aversion, (6) effort, (7) merit, (8) demerit, (9) thinking, (10) number, (11) quantity, (12) individuality, (13) conjunction, (14) disjunction. The first nine are inseparable from it, while number (viz., unity), quantity, individuality, conjunction, dis-\n\nexplained in the commentary of Bhoja or in the P\u0101tanjala Bh\u0101shya. In ordinary Sanskrit it has many meanings. In the Ny\u0101ya it occurs in three different senses, velocity (vega), thinking (bh\u0101van\u0101) and elasticity (sthitisth\u0101paka). Adverting to the second meaning the Bh\u0101\u015b\u0101 Parichcheda says: \"Sansk\u0101ra, called thinking (bh\u0101van\u0101) resides in sentient beings and is imperceptible to the senses.\"\n\n12 The commentators, who are generally under a Vedantic influence, explain virtue, dharma, as including humanity, benevolence, acts of restraint (yama) and of obligation (niyama). Acts of restraint, according to Gandap\u0101da, are restraint of cruelty, falsehood, dishonesty, incontinence and avarice! Acts of obligation are purification, contentment, religious austerities, sacred study and divine worship. Davies, p. 57,\njunction, and sound, are referrible to ether. Sound is its chief characteristic. With the exception of sound, these five are qualities of time and space, and the eight formed by these four together, with priority, posteriority and velocity are qualities of *manas*\u2014Tangibility, number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority and velocity are the nine accidents of air. Colour, tangibility, number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, fluidity, velocity, are the eleven qualities of light (fire), and motion and tangibility, are its characteristics. Colour, taste, tangibility, number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, gravity, fluidity, viscosity and velocity are the fourteen qualities of water. Motion, viscosity, and tangibility are its characteristics. The same fourteen are likewise those of earth, substituting for viscosity odour which abides in earth alone.\n\n[69] Eternal qualities. Of these, six characterise the deity, *viz.*, intellect, desire, effort (one), number (*i.e.*, unity), vastness of quantity (one), and individuality. Three qualities connote the vital principle, (*jiv\u0101tman*), the mind (*manas*) and ether, time and space, *viz.*, quantity (one), number (unity), individuality. Four belong to the indivisible atoms of air, tangibility (one), number, quantity (one), individuality. Five to atoms of light (fire), colour, tangibility (one), number, quantity (one), individuality. Nine to those of water; *viz.*, colour, savour, tangibility, viscosity (one), number, quantity (one), individuality, gravity, and fluidity. Four to those of earth, *viz.*, number (unity), quantity (one), individuality, and gravity. They affirm that qualities, in their non-eternal (transitory) aspects, including desire, effort, and intellect, are sited in other than the Deity, and pleasure, pain, aversion and sound are produced in one moment of time, do not endure to the second, and are lost in the third, and the rest are not of great length of permanence.\nEight qualities are universal: number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, gravity. Four are incident to all substances: namely, conjunction, disjunction, number other than unity, and individuality likewise not single. Those that alone are united in manas, are held to be intellect, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, and effort. Such as are cognisable by inference are merit, demerit, thinking and gravity.\n\nThis much will suffice for example from among a multiplicity of division of these qualities.\n\nHaving now discussed the various categories of artha, I come to the fifth classification of Prameya, namely,\n\nV. Buddhi\\(^{13}\\) (intellect). Although it has been mentioned under the second category (guna) of artha, a somewhat more extended explanation will be of service. It is two-fold: (1) anubhava, (notion or concept), which is produced by means of the four kinds of proof,\\(^{14}\\) and (2) smriti,\\(^{15}\\) recollection, which is effected through bh\u0101van\u0101 sansk\u0101ra, (present consciousness\n\n---\n\n\\(^{13}\\) In the system of Kapila, buddhi is the faculty or organ, by which outward objects are presented to the view of the soul in their proper and definite form, and he assigns to it every quality or state that is connected with the active life, as its primary seat and the first emanation of Nature (Prakriti). Davies, p. 57.\n\n\\(^{14}\\) These are pratyaksha (perception), anum\u0101na (inference), up\u0101m\u0101na (analogy) and sabda (verbal testimony). To these four kinds of proof of the Ny\u0101ya or logical school, the Vedantic adds arth\u0101patti (presumption) an informal kind of inference; as, \u201cDevadatta does not eat by day and yet is fat, it is presumed therefore that he eats by night\u201d; and abh\u0101va (non-existence), a method of proof from an impossibility, or a \u2018reductio ad absurdum\u2019 as, \u201cthere can be no flowers in the sky.\u201d Davies, p. 24.\n\n\\(^{15}\\) Smriti signifies also tradition, the institutes of law as opposed to sruti, the Veda or revelation. The laws of the Hindus, civil and religious, are believed by them to be founded on revelation, of which the Vedas are preserved in the very words. Another portion has been preserved by inspired writers who having revelations present to their memory, have recorded holy precepts for which divine sanction is presume. The latter is smriti, recollection, (remembered law), in contradistinction to sruti, audition, revealed law. Colebrooke.\nof past ideas). *Anubhava* is of two kinds, a right notion or a wrong one. A wrong notion, *i.e.* (one not derived from proof) is threefold, namely, *sansaya*, doubt; *viparyaya*, error, and *tarka*, false premises. This last is a *pad\u0101rtha* (predicament) and will be explained in its place.\n\nVI. *Manas*, although referred to under substance, requires to be mentioned next in order.\n\nVII. *Pravritti*, activity, or employing the mind, tongue and other organs in good and evil works. They maintain that four functions are necessary to an outward action, knowing, willing, resolving and bodily motion.\n\nVIII. *Dosha*, (fault) they assert to be a cause of *prayatna* (effort), and is of three kinds; *r\u0101ga*, passion or extreme desire, *dvesha*, aversion; and *moha*, delusion of mind.\n\nIX. *Pretyabh\u0101va*, (transmigration) signifies life, after death and the union of the soul with the body, followed by death after life and dissolution succeeding connection.\n\nX. *Phala* (retribution) is the fruit of merit and demerit.\n\nXI. *Duhkha*, is the opposite of *Sukha*, joy, which is not here introduced, as the pleasures of this world are by them accounted misery.\n\n---\n\n16 Is the first of the internal organs receiving the impression made upon the senses. Primordial matter, the *Elei* of the Greeks, produced *buddhi* or intellect, from which proceeded *Ahank\u0101ra* or egotism, and from this latter proceed the five organs of sense (*indriya*) and the five organs of action, and lastly *Manas*, the receptive or discriminating faculty. The tongue is classed as an organ of action, and the faculty of speech is as much sensation as touching or walking. The *Manas* has the nature of both classes, being formative or plastic and a sense organ. In the S\u0101\u1e45khya system of Kapila, it is not to be confounded with mind or the rational faculty of the soul, but is regarded as a form of matter. I refer the reader to Davies\u2019 work whence I have taken in scattered notices the substance of the above, and to Colebrooke. This dismal philosophy is curious as an intellectual product, the precursor of the ghastly metaphysics of Hartmann and Schopenhauer. The Hindu has the merit of originality and a better excuse.\nXII. *Apavarga*, (emancipation) is eternal release from pain. There are twenty-one varieties of pain, or evil, and these reside in the six organs of sense, the six objects (*vishaya*) of sensation, the six mental apprehensions that proceed from them, the body which is the centre of evil, pleasure itself which is filled with pain, and pain. In short, pain signifies all that men are averse from and by which distress occurs. The attainment of that state where these effects disappear, is called *mukti*, or final emancipation, where the soul rests without perception or consciousness, is no longer connected with the body and is delivered from heaven and hell. They consider the union of the soul with body which they call *janman* (birth),\\(^{17}\\) as the source of pain. Its existence is due to merit and demerit, and through its companionship with the soul, it receives the recompense of good and evil. The cause of this is *karman* (action), from which proceeds befitting time, or unsuitable deed and pain or pleasure. *Yatna* (effort), which is synonymous with *prayatna*, and *pravritti*, activity, produce these consequences, and this in turn results from *r\u0101ga* or passion, which springs from *mithy\u0101-jn\u0101na*,\\(^{18}\\) erroneous opinion, originated by *bh\u0101van\u0101 sansk\u0101ra*. By mortification of spirit and body and by good works, the means of perfect knowledge are secured, resulting in the attainment of perfected capacities. Ignorance is destroyed, true knowledge acquired, and the flux and reflux of existence vanish for ever.\n\nSome say that when the intelligence attains its highest illumination, error and ignorance are annihilated and with them *r\u0101ga* and *dvesha*, that is passion and aversion depart,\n\n---\n\n\\(^{17}\\) In every form of earthly life, the soul is united to its own peculiar vehicle or body, but is not blended with it but enveloped by it. By this is meant, not the gross material body which perishes at each migration, but the *linga*, the subtle *umbra* or sheath formed from the substance of the three internal organs, and the finer elements of matter (*tanm\u0101tra*). For Body and Soul, see Hastings' Encyclo., xi. 742-744. [J. S.]\n\n\\(^{18}\\) *Mithy\u0101-jn\u0101na* is used to signify that special misapprehension which estops release from the world.\nand hence pravritti, activity, is extirpated, and by its disappearance janman (birth), is no more, and pain and grief are dissolved and mukti brings everlasting bliss. Another opinion is that tattvajn\u0101na, true knowledge, dispels mithy\u0101-jn\u0101na, or error, which causes the subversion of desire, which overwhelms prayatna. By its fall karman (action) is subverted and overturns with it dharma and adharma (merit and demerit). Janman (birth), thus, is swept away carrying with it duhkha (pain) in its overthrow. The Ny\u0101ya school assert that when the material body perishes, knowledge dies with it. Perfect knowledge depends upon three conditions: (1) sravana, hearing, and studying the Vedas and the existing traditions of the sages, and this cannot be attained except by the aid of one who has travelled this road: [71] (2) manana, consideration, by which the sacred books and the precepts of the virtuous are when apprehended, studiously illumined by proofs that convince the mind. The effect of this study, according to one opinion, issues in a speculation as to the nature of the rational soul and whether it is not apart from all else; (3) nididhy\u0101sana, profound contemplation; by frequent reflection and reiterated thought on the objects of contemplation in their entirety, the mind becomes habitually absorbed herein and advancing beyond the objective sensations of sight and deed, becomes the recipient of truth.\n\nIt is asserted that the contemplation of the rational soul may be so continuous as not to be interrupted. When these three conditions are fulfilled with diligence and unwavering resolve, a sublime knowledge is attained and liberation secured from pain and pleasure and the fetters of the corpo-\n\n---\n\n19 In Kapila's system, the soul is solitary and perfectly distinct from matter and therefore from the modifications the modes of Nature produce. It beholds as an eye-witness, for insight and cognition are not properties of matter. It is neutral (Madhyastha, lit. standing between) \"as a wandering ascetic is lonely and unconcerned, while the villagers are being engaged in agriculture\". The soul in its regal grandeur, has no part in the inferior life of action. It directs as a sovereign but does not work. Davies.\nreal state. This school professes the doctrine of K\u0101ya\u015byuha, multiplication of bodies.\\textsuperscript{20}\n\nThey maintain that when any of the specially favoured are illumined by the light of this knowledge, and are cognisant of their past existences and future destiny, and know that a course of further transmigration awaits them, and desire to complete it, they receive a special power from the Supreme Being, and in a brief space receive these various forms and endure the pains and pleasures of life with the same spirit and the same intelligence, and when these forms pass away, attain eternal bliss. It is also said that all men will\\textsuperscript{21} arrive at final emancipation, and that though the world is without a beginning, birth and production will eventually cease.\n\nThe third predicament Sansaya, doubt, is three-fold: (1), it may arise from the sight of objects with common qualities, as for example, an object may be seen from a distance, and not distinctly, known whether it be a tree or a man, and the like; (2), cause of doubt is likewise (a non-general or special attribute) in regard to a particular object which is separate from the notion of eternal or non-eternal, substance or quality, and the doubt arises whether it be eternal or non-eternal, substance or quality: (3), Cause of doubt lies also in controversy when a subject may be the occasion of contradictory affirmation and denial between two learned disputants.\n\n\\textsuperscript{20} This subject is touched upon in the fourth chapter of the Yoga aphorisms of Patanjali. \"When a Yogi, who has a mastery over the cardinal principles, with a view to enjoy at once the fruits of his actions, from the perception of his own superior transcendental powers, wishes to assume many bodies at the same time, whence does he derive many thinking principles\" (to vitalize these bodies)? In reply the author says: \"the created thinking principles (proceed) solely from egoism.\" That is, that his own consciousness or rather his absolute Ego, (for Fichtte distinguishes between the two) by force of will evolves the power, as fire emits sparks. \\textit{Vide} R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra's translation, p. 171-72.\n\n\\textsuperscript{21} A variant, the reading of one MS., has a negative. According to the S\u0101\u1e45khya (and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sa) systems, acquiring knowledge and thus gaining deliverance from contact with matter is the privilege of the few rather than a duty manifest on all. See Davies, p. 114.\nThe fourth predicament, Prayojana, motive, is that which necessarily precedes and produces an effect and is termed causality. Of this there are not accounted more than three kinds: (1), the presence of efficient conditions and means is termed nimitta k\u0101rana, or instrumental causality; (2), the material cause is samav\u0101yi k\u0101rana, intimate or direct causality; (3), the indirect or non-intimate causality is called asamav\u0101yi k\u0101rana. Cause is termed k\u0101rana and effect k\u0101rya, and s\u0101magri is total causality, (the aggregate of conditions necessary for the forming of either, a material product or a physical state). This subject is treated in Sanskrit philosophy under the first predicament.\n\n[72] The fifth predicament is Drisht\u0101nta, instance or example, showing invariable connection (between subject and predicate).\n\nThe sixth predicament, is Siddh\u0101nta, dogma or determinate truth.\n\nThe seventh predicament is Avayava, (members of a) syllogism. This consists of five members.  \n\n---\n\n22 The usual order is the intimate, non-intimate and instrumental. An instance of the first, is thread from which cloth is made; for the second the conjunction of the threads; for the third, the loom. Intimate causality belongs to substances, non-intimate causality to qualities and actions. R\u00f6er, p. 10.\n\n23 The members are these:\u2014\n\n1. This hill is fiery.\n2. For it smokes.\n3. Whatever smokes is fiery.\n4. This hill is smoking.\n5. Therefore it is fiery.\n\nor\n\n1. Sound is non-eternal.\n2. Because it is produced.\n3. Whatever is produced is non-eternal.\n4. Sound is produced.\n5. Therefore it is non-eternal.\n\nSome confine the syllogism to three members, either the first three or the last. In the latter form it is the syllogism of Aristotle. According to R\u00f6er, the Ny\u0101ya knows only the two first figures of syllogism, and of these only the two moods Barbara and Camestres. A complete syllogism is properly termed ny\u0101ya, the five members or component parts are called avayava.\nproposition, as in the statement, \"there is fire in this hill\".\n\nII. *Hetu*, the concomitant reason supporting the proposition, \"for it smokes\", by which the presence of fire is apprehended which is the ground for the inference, and this, in regard to the invariable connection (between subject and predicate), is threefold. If the necessary connection is affirmative, it is called *keval\u0101nvayin* (concomitancy of affirmatives), and if negative, *kevala-vyatirekin* (concomitancy of negatives), and if both, *anvaya-vyatirekin* (affirmative and negative induction). Of this third kind five members are necessary for a complete syllogism. (1) *Paksha sattva* (subject of the conclusion) where the subject to be proved is supposed to be in a given place. (2) *Sapaksha sattva* (similar instance, involving the major term) where the place of the subject and predicate are with certainty known or inferred as smoke and fire in a kitchen hearth. (3) *Vipaksha sattva* (negative instance) where the subject and predicate exclude each other as water (and fire). (4) *Ab\u0101dhita vishayatva*, non-negation of the object of proof (by other proof). (5) *Asatpratipakshatva*, (non-equalisation), where there is no counterbalancing reason proving the negation of what is to be proved. In the first classification of *Hetu*, (*keval\u0101nvayin*), the third of these five is absent. In the second, (*kevala-vyatirekin*), the second of the five is absent.\n\nIII. *Udh\u0101harana*, the instance or example. The subject of a proposition is called *vy\u0101pya*: the predicate is the *vy\u0101paka*,\n\n---\n\n24 These and the following terms are thus rendered in Dr. Richard Garbe's translation of Aniruddha's commentary on the S\u0101\u1e45khya Sutras. \"By means of a syllogism construed in this manner we discern (1), that the invariably concomitated (*vy\u0101pya*) is an attribute of the subject of the conclusion (*paksha-dharmatva*), (2), that the *vy\u0101pya* exists in those things in which the invariable concomitant (*vy\u0101paka*) undoubtedly exists (*sapaksha-sattva*), (3), that the *vy\u0101pya* is excluded from those things from which the *vy\u0101paka* is also excluded (*vipak\u1e63h\u0101dv\u0101vritti\u1e25*), (4) that no equally strong reason can be adduced against the reason which proves the proposition (*asatpratipakshatva*), (5), that the *vy\u0101pya* is not such that its object does not exist in the subject of the conclusion (*ab\u0101dhita-vishayatva*).\nand *vy\u0101pti*, pervasion [73] or invariable concomitance, is the mutual relation of the subject and predicate.\n\nIV. *Upanaya* is the application of the reason to the subject in question.\n\n*Nigamana* is the conclusion. Although it lies implicate in the major premise, it forms the statement in the general proposition and becomes the consequent in the fifth.\n\nThe eighth predicament *Tarka*, is inadmissible conclusion at variance with proof, that is, the perception of a deduction from wrong premises.\\(^{25}\\) By its statement the disputant removes the doubt in the relation of subject and predicate. For instance to one who denied the existence of fire (in the hill) he would rejoin that without it there could be no smoke, of which fire is the cause.\n\nThe ninth predicament is *Nirnaya*, (ascertainment), or a certainty of conclusion on the completion of proof.\n\nThe tenth *V\u0101da*, (controversy) is the expression of their respective views of a subject by two seekers after knowledge, supported by reasons brought forward with good feeling, and in the interests of truth, allowing neither their several convictions nor self-assertion to influence them. Verily such courteous\\(^{26}\\) disputants, like the phoenix, move with steps that leave no trace.\n\nThe eleventh *Jalpa*, or wrangling, is the debate of disputants contending for victory.\n\nThe twelfth is *Vitanda*, objection or cavilling: The object of one disputant being the advancement of what is true and reasonable, and of the other to dispute his statements.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{25}\\) The text is corrupt. The words of the *Tarka Sangraha*, are thus translated by Vidy\u0101 S\u0101gara, *Reductio ad absurdum* or *Tarka* is that which consists in founding the pervader (*vy\u0101pya*) (here supposed to be denied) through the allegation of the pervaded (*vy\u0101paka* here supposed to be taken for granted). As for instance: If there were not fire (which you do not grant), there would not be smoke (which you admit there is). V. 68.\n\n\\(^{26}\\) I would read *jarohindah* for *jarohidah*. It is not wisdom nor ingenuity that is rare, but courtesy and good temper.\nThe thirteenth is *Hetv\u0101bh\u0101sa*, fallacy. This is a syllogism with the semblance of a reason, of which there are five kinds. If this predicament were placed in order above *V\u0101da*, the tenth, or below the three following, it would be more in place.\n\nThe fourteenth is *Chhala*, perversion of an adversary's statement through malice, and disputing it.\n\nThe fifteenth is *J\u0101ti*, futility, or a reply both irrelevant and reprehensible, advanced with speciousness and cavilling. This is of twenty-four kinds.\n\nThe sixteenth predicament is *Nigrahasth\u0101na*, the confutation of an adversary, and is of twenty-two kinds.\n\nEach of these sixteenth subjects have numerous questions arising out of them, supported by a variety of opinions, arguments and instances.\n\nIt is believed that whosoever apprehends these sixteen in their integrity, is released from further birth and death, lives in freedom from pleasure and pain, and attains his final end by three degrees of knowledge: viz. (1), *uddesha* (enunciation), by which he distinguishes the name of each of these sixteen predicaments and bears them in memory; (2) *lakshana* (definition), by which he arrives at their essential truth; (3) *parik\u1e63\u0101* (investigation), by which he ascertains the sufficiency and pertinence of their definition.\n\nThis school, though not acknowledging that the world had a beginning, yet believes in its final destruction. This they term *pralaya*, which is of two kinds.\n\nIn the first, Brahm\u0101 slumbers in the chamber of non-existence, and appears no more, and all created forms perish. His absolute cause is the divine will, the completion of a decreed period and the coming of an appointed time. When this time arrives, by the will of God, merit and demerit cease to exist, and by the same divine will, the indivisible atoms (of primordial matter) are set in agitation, from which\nbh\u0101ga,\\textsuperscript{27} (disjunction), is brought into reality, and samyoga (union from contiguity) is dissolved. First the globe of the earth, next fire, followed by air and water are successively destroyed and creation ceases to exist and all souls attain final emancipation. This is termed mah\u0101pralaya. In the second, is the final emancipation of Brahm\u0101, which is called Khand\u0101-pralaya (partial dissolution). In this, with the exception of merit and demerit, present consciousness, and action, all else perish. At the close of one hundred extraordinary years,\\textsuperscript{28} of which mention has been made, Brahm\u0101 attains this accomplishment of desire. After the lapse of this period, a succeeding Brahm\u0101 is born. Another opinion is that there are four dissolutions. Besides the above two, there is a third when right apprehension is taken up from mankind and this will happen at the close of a cycle of the four ages. The fourth is the dissolution of each particular thing which is called its pralaya, as when the manas first dissolves its connection with the rational soul, and following this, when the union of soul and body is then severed.\\textsuperscript{29}\n\n\\textsuperscript{27} Earth according to the Ny\u0101ya, is eternal in its atoms, non-eternal in its parts. An atom is defined thus: \"an atom is; what exists has no cause and is without beginning and end: an atom is contrary to what has a measure.\" R\u00f6er, p. 14. Colour, taste and the like are said to be eternal, or otherwise according to the substances in which they exist, these two being eternal in the atoms of water and light but in other substances have a cause. The atomic nature of the mind is inferred from the fact that several objects of knowledge are not perceived by it at once.\n\nI believe vibh\u0101ga is here meant, and the suffix has been omitted by the error of a copyist. This is undoubtedly the sense of the passage.\n\n\\textsuperscript{28} The aggregate of the four ages, Krita, Treta, Dw\u0101para and Kali multiplied by a thousand, constitute a day of Brahm\u0101; his night is of equal duration, and of such days and nights is the year of Brahm\u0101 composed. One hundred such years constitute his whole life. A great Kalpa, as distinguished from a minor Kalpa, is properly not a day but a life of Brahm\u0101. Vishnu Pur\u0101na, Wilson, pp. 23, 25, 6.\n\n\\textsuperscript{29} The following are the four kinds of dissolution as given by the Vishnu Pur\u0101na. 1. Naimittika occasional; Pr\u0101kritika,\nThe (renewed) creation of the world is called *srishti*. Through the volition of the Supreme Being, and after the lapse of ages and at the advent of a special time, merit and demerit recover their sway, and the indivisible atoms of matter are again moved. Two atoms first combine: this is called *dvya-anuka*; then three *dvya-anukas* unite and are named *try-anuka*; the union of four *dvya-anukas* is termed *chatur-anuka*, and thus they gradually coalesce, till numerous forms are manifested, and contrariwise to their dissolution, they are produced in the following order: air, fire, water, earth, and subsequently, Brahm\u0101, Vishnu and Mah\u0101deva. The three last are not apparent to the light of vision but assume shape and are beneficent in their operation. From air spring aerial forms which reside in *V\u0101yuloka*, a sphere above the earth, and the sense of touch and the blowing wind whose energising\n\nelemental; *Atyantika*, absolute; *Nitya*, perpetual. The first, also termed the Brahm\u0101 dissolution, occurs when the sovereign of the world reclines in sleep. In the second, the mundane egg resolves into the primary element from whence it was derived. Absolute non-existence of the world, is the absorption of the sage through knowledge into supreme spirit. Perpetual destruction is the constant disappearance, day and night, of all that are born. *Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a*, 56. The first three kinds are very powerfully described in the 6th book, the fourth chapter of which represents the elemental dissolution in very striking language. The third kind, involving the final liberation from existence, is the subject of the 5th Chapter, where the sufferings of infancy, manhood and old age are portrayed in a manner not surpassed in power by any description in literature. With no hope beyond the grave, with hell for the wicked and no cessation from pain even in heaven, whose inhabitants are tormented with the prospect of descending again to earth, no wonder that exemption from birth was the desire of the wise, and annihilation the last hope of those who were doomed to the sorrows of conception, birth and decay.\n\n30 \"Then ether, air, light, water, earth, severally united with the properties of sound and the rest, existed as distinguishable according to their qualities, but possessing various energies they could not without combination create living beings. Having combined therefore, they assumed the character of entire unity and from the direction of spirit with the acquiescence of the indiscrete Principle, Intellect and the rest, to the gross elements inclusive, formed an egg. This vast egg was the abode of Vishnu in the form of Brahm\u0101.\" *Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a*, p. 18.\nessence is called in Sanskrit, pr\u0101na (vital breath), of which there are five kinds\\(^{31}\\) as will be related.\n\nFrom fire (light) spring fiery bodies dwelling in Adityaloka\\(^{31}\\) which is the sphere of the sun, and vision and the modes of heat. From water are the aqueous bodies dwelling in Varunaloka\\(^{32}\\) which is said to be near the mountain Sumeru, and the rudiment of taste and the seas and ice and hail. From earth, are earthly forms, and the rudiment of smell, minerals, plants and animals. Brahm\u0101 by his volition first brings into being all (immovable)\\(^{33}\\) forms produced without generation,\n\n\\(^{31}\\) These are (1) pr\u0101na, breath, the ordinary inspiration and expiration.\n\n(2) Ap\u0101na, downward breath, the air or vital force acting in the lower parts of the body.\n\n(3) Sam\u0101na, collective breath, so named from conducting equally the food, &c., through the body.\n\n(4) Ud\u0101na, separate breath, the vital force that causes the pulsations of the arteries in the upper portions of the body from the navel to the head.\n\n(5) Vy\u0101na, separate breath, by which internal division and diffusion through the body are effected.\n\nThese airs are not the elemental air, but subtle inward forces necessary to vitality and the efficacy of the organic functions of the human frame.

By immovable things are meant the mineral and vegetable kingdoms.\nand wonderful are the details they give herein, and it is said that a single eternal volition of the Deity at their appointed times operates to create and destroy. The creative will is called Chikirsha (desire to act) and the destructive will Sanjhirsha (desire to take away).\n\nTheir works are in a five-fold series. (1) Sutra, a short technical sentence; (2) bh\u0101shya, commentary on a somewhat difficult sutra; (3) v\u0101rttika, a critical annotation on the two; (4) tik\u0101, commentary (properly of the original or of another commentary) on No. 3; (5) nibandha, an explanation of technical rules. Another opinion is that the series runs to twelve. Besides those enumerated, (6) vritti, a brief elucidation of some complicated subjects in the first-mentioned; (7) nirukta, etymological interpretation of a word. Sound is held to be of two kinds, (\u03b1) inarticulate, which is termed dhvani (sound, noise), and (\u03b2) articulate, varna (a letter,) also called akshara. The junction of several letters is called pada, a word, and several words in connection form, v\u0101kya, a sentence, and a collection of these make a sutra, or aphorism, and several sutras are called prakarana (article or section). These last again when connected are [76] termed \u0101hnik\u0101, and an aggregate of the latter, adhy\u0101ya, which combined together compose a s\u0101stra or didactic work. In some treatises, ambiguities are discussed regarding the definitions of pada which are therein resolved: (8) prakarana, is a section treating of one or two topics; (9) \u0101hnik\u0101, a short task sufficing for a diurnal lesson; (10) parisishta, a supplement to a technical work; (11) paddhati, a manual of the texts relating to each of the six sciences in prescribed order; (12) sangraha, an epitome of the sciences. These classes of works are not confined to this school alone. Vrajya is a compendium or homogeneous collection, and instead of the divisions into sections and chapters, the following ten words are used.\n\n(1) anka, (2) uchchv\u0101sa, (3) sarga, (4) visr\u0101ma, (5) ull\u0101sa, (6) patala, (7) adhy\u0101ya, (8) uddesa, (9) adhina, (10) tantra.\nThe Ny\u0101ya philosophy is divided into five adhy\u0101yas. The first gives a list of the sixteen subjects to be discussed, and a definition of each. The second deals with the detail of pram\u0101na (proof or evidence) and accurate knowledge and the like. The third is on the six kinds of objects of thought, namely, soul; body; organs of sense; objects of sense; intellect and mind. The fourth treats of its remaining heads. The fifth is on j\u0101ti (futility) and nigrahasth\u0101na (confutation of an adversary). Although the system of Kan\u0101da is antecedent in date, yet since the Ny\u0101ya treats of a multiplicity of subjects, and is generally the first studied, I have given it priority of place.\n\nVAISESHIKA.\n\nThis great system of science owes its origin to Kan\u0101da. It agrees in the main, with the Ny\u0101ya, differing from it only on a few points.\n\nIn the works of this school, seven predicaments are named which comprise the entire scheme. [77] These are dravya, substance, guna, quality, karman, action, s\u0101m\u0101nya, community, visesha, particularity, samav\u0101ya intimate relation, and abh\u0101va, negation. Of pram\u0101na, proof or evidence, they accept only pratyak\u1e63ha, (perception) and anum\u0101na (inference). The change in qualities occurring in the process\n\n---\n\n34 The Vaiseshika school as represented by Kan\u0101da, the reputed author of the Vaiseshika system, in Hastings, Encycl., xii. 568-570. [J. S.] Of Kan\u0101da little is known. The Vaiseshika system is one of physical science; the Ny\u0101ya deals with elementary, metaphysical notions, and the forms of the syllogism, and is the standard work in logic among the Hindus. I refer the reader for a critical account of the system to the introduction to the Categories by Dr. E. R\u00f6er, Colebrooke (Miscellaneous essays), to the Dialogues on Hindu Philosophy by Dr. K. M. Banerjea and Dr. Fitz-Edward Hall's Refutation of Hindu Philosophy.\n\n35 The text has \u0101tm\u0101, a copyist's error for anum\u0101na, which it would closely resemble even to the diacritical points. The Vaiseshika system differs from the Ny\u0101ya in this very point, admitting only two kinds of proof, perception and inference.\nof cooking termed p\u0101ka-ja, arises from the sun's rays or heat of the fire. These qualities are colour, taste, smell and tangibility.\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas assert that bodily substance is unchanged, whether in its natural state or under the influence of heat. The Vaiseshikas, that the (conjunction of) atoms forming the body, disintegrate through the action of heat and are reunited by divine power.\n\nAgain, the Ny\u0101ya school make samav\u0101ya (constant intimate relation), perceptible to vision, while the Vaiseshikas allow it to be cognisable only by argument and proof.\n\nMIMAMSA.\n\nThe founder of this school was the sage Jaimini. It is more ancient than the two already described, and the chief exponents of its philosophy are Kum\u0101rila Bhatta, Prabh\u0101kara Guru, and Mur\u0101ri Misra. Its professors are said to reject the notion of a Supreme Being, while some accept it, but do not\n\n---\n\n36 \"The change produced by cooking takes place according to the Vaiseshikas in the single atoms\". So the Bh\u0101sha Parichchheda. The commentator observes on this, that as long as the parts are retained in the compound, no change by cooking is possible, but when by the union of fire, the compound substances have been destroyed, change occurs in the atoms which become independent units. Again by the junction of atoms changed by process of cooking, a production is effected from the compound of two, three &c., atoms, again to a compound of many parts, for by the extraordinary velocity of heat, the transition from the destruction of one compound to the formation of another is sudden. The Naiy\u0101yika view is that compound substances have pores and the minute parts of fire enter them and therefore the change by the process of cooking is possible, although the parts be retained in the compound.\n\n37 The Mim\u0101msa is classed sometimes as the Purva or Prior and the Uttara or Posterior. The object of the first was to support the authority of the Vedas, to maintain their ritual, and interpret their true meaning. The second is the Ved\u0101nta or supplement of the Vedas, and was formed at a later date based on the synonymous term Upanishads, or the mystic teaching of the Vedas. The Upanishads are called Ved\u0101ntas, and their philosophy is known as the Ved\u0101ntic System. For Mim\u0101ms\u0101, see Hastings, viii. 648, also i. 137.\nallow of a Creator, attributing the production of existing things to merit and demerit. When an assembly of the learned was convened with a view to ascertain the truth as to their creed, it was discovered that they were all of this latter opinion, but in deference to the variable character of minds, they are silent as to the nature of the Divinity, and lay the principal stress in discussion on the diversities of works. But men from ignorance and captiousness lay this opinion to their charge. Quantity is not accounted by them as attributable to God. *Parim\u0101na*, quantity, which the Ny\u0101ya school places among qualities, is not predicated by them of the Deity, and they do not allow that Brahm\u0101, Vishnu and Mah\u0101deva are divine manifestations, affirming that human souls attain that eminence through good deeds. They hold mystic hymns in the place of particular deities whose potency they ascribe to the subtile spells of sound. They allow no beginning, nor end to the world, and believe the four elements, the mountains, and the great seas to be eternal. They believe that bodies are produced from an aggregate of minute atoms, and not from one substance; *manas* and *\u0101tman* are all pervading, and a man\u2019s actions are the result of his own free will and initiative, and while granting the states of hell and heaven, and transmigration into lower and higher forms of being, and final emancipation, they do not believe that the latter is attainable by all men but is the result of the union of perfected understanding and action, and a sublime knowledge and an ineffable repose will be the eternal portion of that state.\n\n[78] The perception of sound by the ear, they believe to be one of the qualities of air. The Ny\u0101ya places it in ether. The second of the two philosophers above-named teaches that *samav\u0101ya*, co-inherence, exists as eternal in things eternal and non-eternal in things non-eternal, and everywhere separate, and they interpret it by the term *t\u0101d\u0101tmya* (identity of nature). They reject *visesha*. According to Kum\u0101rila\nBhatta and Mur\u0101ri Misra, there are ten predicaments (pad\u0101rtha): (1) substance, (2) quality, (3) action, (4) community, (5) identity of nature, and (6) negation. (7) Vaisishtya (endowment with attributes), is the term applied to the connection of non-existence\\textsuperscript{38} which they regard as a separate \u00e9ntel\u00e9kheia, as the Ny\u0101ya regards Svarupa (true nature) and Sabda. (8) Sakti (energy) is a characteristic imperceptible to sight but efficient in action, like the property of burning in fire, and quenching of thirst in water. This they affirm to be two-fold; essential (j\u0101ti) as has been exemplified, and accidental, such as may be produced by incantation and the like. The Ny\u0101ya school recognises the properties of burning and quenching of thirst as inherent in fire and water. (9) S\u0101drisy\u0101, similarity between two objects. (10) Sankhy\u0101, number, is not regarded as a quality but as a distinct substance. Prabh\u0101kara Guru reckons nine predicaments and excludes abh\u0101va (negation) from the notion of things.\n\nKum\u0101rila Bhatta acknowledges eleven substances, the nine already given and (10) andhak\u0101ra, darkness. The Naiy\u0101yikas, with the Guru and Mur\u0101ri Misra recognise the negation of light, but this school makes it a separate object of knowledge, which casts its shade over everything. Colour quantity, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, and posteriority, are qualities appertaining to it. (11) Sabda (sound) is considered eternal\\textsuperscript{39} and all-pervading. Letters are substance and possess the same qualities as darkness, except colour. Qualities are twenty-two in number. Prabh\u0101kara Guru and Mur\u0101ri Misra do not hold sound to be substance, but acknowledge its eternity. According to Kum\u0101rila Bhatta,\n\n\\textsuperscript{38} See the Sarva Darsana Sangr. Udayana tries to establish that although ether, the site of sound, is imperceptible, the non-existence of that which abides in this site is perceptible, p. 194.\n\n\\textsuperscript{39} The Naiy\u0101yikas deny this, asserting that it is non-eternal. The eternity of the Veda depends on the Mim\u0101msa doctrine that sound is eternal. The arguments pro and con are stated at some length in the Jaimini Dar\u015bana, v. Sarva Darsana-Sangraha.\nintelligence operates like cognition arising from inferential reasoning. The Guru teaches that its own (indwelling) illumination proceeds from intelligence, as a lamp illumines itself while revealing other objects. The Misra holds with the Ny\u0101ya that it proceeds from the manas. This school does not accept the four kinds of proof (pram\u0101na) but only the two first, perception and inference.\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas say that gold has its origin in fire, the Mim\u0101msakas, in earth. The notion of time with the former, is apprehended by the reason, with the latter, by the senses, who also consider colour, among qualities, to be eternal, and each of the five colours in all diversities of position, to be one. Generality is innate in substance. They do not accept the notion of Vega Sansk\u0101ra, (velocity) and ascribe its effect to karman (action or motion).\n\nAccording to Bhatta and Misra, pram\u0101na (proof) is of six kinds, four of which are the same as those of the Ny\u0101ya, and the senses are said to be seven, as they add t\u0101masendriya by which the quality of darkness is cognized. They reject keval\u0101nvayin, (con-comitancy of affirmative) and kevala vyatirekin (concomitancy of negatives); and the Guru, mithy\u0101j\u00f1\u0101na (erroneous opinion). Sansaya (doubt)\u2074\u2070 and viparyaya (misconception), are recognised as two forms of veritable knowledge. [79] The Naiy\u0101yikas prove the existence of air from inference, the Mim\u0101msakas from touch. The fifth kind of pram\u0101na is arth\u0101patti (presumption), discerning the subject and assuming the predicate.\u2074\u00b9\n\nThe sixth kind of anupalabdhi, non-perception of things. They assert that perception of the non-existence of things\n\n\u2074\u2070 Doubt is founded on the notion whether a thing is what it seems to be, as a man or the stump of a tree; misconception is incorrect notion, as the notion of silver in mother o' pearl.\n\n\u2074\u00b9 That is, the assumption of a thing not itself perceived, but necessarily implied by another which is seen, heard or proved. Colebrooke, I. 329.\narises from the non-knowledge of those things. The M\u012btra like the Naiy\u0101yikas includes this in pratya\u015baksha.\n\nThe cardinal point of their system lies in works, which are of two kinds; vihita (enjoined), a work productive of good, and nishiddha (prohibited), resulting in pain. The first is again fourfold, (1) nitya (constant), that is, a daily duty, reprehensible to omit: (2) naimittaka (occasional rites), necessary duties at special times such as eclipses: (3) k\u0101mya (desirable), things done with desire of fruition: (4) pr\u0101ya\u015bchitta, expiatory acts. Of the nine schools, the first six recognize these obligations and carry them into practice to the prosperous ordering of their lives. A separate order of ceremonies is appointed to each of the four castes of men.\n\nThe questions comprised by this philosophy are set forth in twelve books. The first treats of the predicaments and of proof: the second, of various rites and certain elucidations of the Vaidic text: the third, of certain important ceremonies the results of rites which are revealed in that sacred volume and other minor points accessory to the main objects. The fourth, that the acquisition of worldly goods is twofold, personal comfort and (to procure oblations) for casting into the fire (for sacrificial purposes). The fifth, of the order of various duties. The sixth, of the substitutes for various rites.\n\nThe sophism anupalabdh\u012b-sama is the trying to establish a fact from the impossibility of perceiving the non-perception of it. For the Ny\u0101ya on pratya\u015baksha see R\u00f6er, p. 26.\n\nJacobi in his translation of the Ved\u0101nta-S\u0101ra, illustrates \u201cnitya\u201d constant rites, such as the Sandhy\u0101 prayers and the like, (which) cause ruin if left undone, and Naimittika, occasional rites, as the birth-sacrifice following the birth of a son, &c. The prohibited things are the slaying of a Brahman, &c., which result in hell: and the \u201cthings done with a desire of reward\u201d (k\u0101mya) are such as are done to procure heaven.\n\nI have no doubt that the Persian words \u2018casting into the fire\u2019 is a translation of the Sanskrit homa which exactly expresses this meaning, that is, the oblations such as butter, &c., which are part of the ceremonial of worship, and the ability to purchase these goods is one of the advantages of wealth. Abul Fazl appears to assume in his readers a general acquaintance with the subjects he expounds, and the half lights under which he displays them, mislead and perplex.\nThe seventh, of the detail of the ceremonies to be performed which are only briefly described in the Vedas. The eighth is an exposition of dependent rites which are included in the performance of the primary. The ninth, a discussion of the mystic verses specified for a particular case in the sacred book, when quoted in a new connection, and hymns of praise. The tenth, the discussion of dependent rites which are precluded by non-performance of the primary rite. The eleventh discusses the occasion where one act suffices for the fulfilment of two (or more) acts. The twelfth, where the chief purpose of the rite is one only, but has a further reference without express assignment.\\footnote{This synopsis of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka treatise is very imperfect and would be unintelligible without the aid of an exact and scientific summary of its contents. Fortunately this is furnished by the Sarva-Darsana Sangraha or review of the different systems of Hindu philosophy by M\u0101dhava Ach\u0101rya, translated by Messrs. Cowell and Gough. This work was composed by the author in the 14th century.}\n\n\\textbf{VEDANTA.}\n\nThe founder of this school was \\textit{Vy\u0101sa}.\\footnote{For the Ved\u0101nta school, see Hastings, ii. 597-598, i. 137-9 (advaita), ii. 796-799 (brahma), xi. 185-189 (Sankara), besides very many excellent modern works and exact translations. The legendary personage, known as Veda-vy\u0101sa or divider of the Vedas, is represented in the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as an incarnation of Vishnu. He is also the reputed author of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, known to mortals as Krishna Dwaip\u0101yana, and to the gods as the deity N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, for none else, but a deity was considered capable of the feat. The name of B\u0101dar\u0101yana is also given to him. The principal tenets of the Ved\u0101nta are that God is the omniscient and omnipotent cause of the existence, continuation, and dissolution of the universe. Creation is an act of His will. At the consummation all things are resolved into Him. He is sole existent, secondless, entire, sempiternal, infinite, universal soul, truth, wisdom, intelligence and happiness. Individual souls emanate from Him like sparks from a fire and return to Him, being of the same essence. The soul is a portion of the divine substance. Colebrooke, \\textit{Misc. Essays}, Ed. Cowell, I. 394. The original Ved\u0101nta did not recognise the doctrine of M\u0101y\u0101 or illusion.} The Hindus ascribe extreme longevity to him among nine other persons as follows: Lomasa, M\u0101rkandeya, Vy\u0101sa, Ashwatth\u0101m\u0101,\nHanumant B\u0101li, Vibhishana, Kripach\u0101rya, and Parasur\u0101ma, and relate wonderful legends regarding them. [80]\n\nThe professors of this important school of philosophy follow the Mim\u0101msa in the definitions of *pad\u0101rtha*, and *pram\u0101na* and other points, and accept the teachings of Bhatta, but heaven and hell, rewards and punishments and such other cosmical phenomena, they look on as a delusion under the appearance of reality. In some works there are two predicaments, (1) *drik* (discerning) = *\u0101tman* (soul): (2) *drisya* (the visible creation). They allow of no existence external to God. The world is a delusive appearance, and as a man in sleep sees fanciful shapes, and is affected by a thousand joys and sorrows, so are its seeming realities. One effulgent light conveys a multiplicity of impressions and assumes diversity of names.\n\nThe subjects of discussion in this great system are six: *Brahman*, *Iswara*, *Jiva*, (intelligent sentient soul), *Ajn\u0101na* (Ignorance), *Sambandha* (relation), *Bhed\u0101*, difference. These six are held to be without beginning, and the first without end.\n\nBrahma is the Supreme Being; and is essential existence and wisdom and also bliss which is termed *\u0101nanda*. These three alone are predicated of the Inscrutable. *Ajn\u0101na*, Ignorance, in opposition to the ancients, is regarded as having a separate existence, and two powers are attributed to it. (1) *vikshepa-sakti*, the power of projection: (2) *\u0101varana-sakti*, the power of veiling the real nature of things. *Sambandha* is the relation of Ignorance with the first-mentioned. *Bhed\u0101* is the disjunction of these two.\n\nIt is said that Ignorance in connection with the first is called *M\u0101y\u0101*, or the power of Illusion, and with the second, *avidy\u0101* (nescience).\n\n[81] By the association of Illusion (*m\u0101y\u0101*) with the essential sanctity (of Brahma), a definite hypostasis arises which is called *Iswara* in whose omniscience there is no defect.\nThis Supreme Being in his association with nescience (avidy\u0101) is called j\u012bva (the soul) and also j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101, (rational, conscious soul). Knowledge lurks behind the veil of concealment, and the dust of defect falls not on the skirt of the divine majesty. One sect believe that as avidy\u0101 is one, j\u012bva can be only one, and these aver that none has ever attained emancipation. Another sect affirm that as avidy\u0101 is distributively numerous, so likewise is j\u012bva; and that many of the wise have attained that accomplishment of desire which consists in the removal of aj\u00f1\u0101na (ignorance) before-mentioned, by right apprehension. Aj\u00f1\u0101na has three qualities: sattva (goodness), which is attended with happiness and the like: rajas (foulness or passion), from which spring desire, pain, pleasure, and similar effects: tamas, darkness, which is accompanied by anger, dullness, love of ease, and the like. Isvara, in union with rajas, takes the name of Brahman from whom, emanates the appearance of creation. Isvara, in union with sattva, becomes Vishnu, whose office is the preservation of the created. Isvara united with tamas is Mah\u0101deva, who annihilates what has been created. Thus the chain of creation is linked in these three modes, and all are unreal appearances produced by ignorance.\n\nLike the ancients they hold the elements to be five, but each is twofold:\u2014(1), sukshma, (subtile), imperceptible to the eye which is termed apanchikrita, (non-quintuplicated)\n\n47 Literally \"not becoming five by combination,\" that is, rudimentary. It is thus explained in Jacobi's Vedanta-S\u0101ra. \"From Intelligence associated with ignorance, attended by its projective power, in which the quality of insensibility (tamas) abounds, proceeds ether, from ether, air, from air heat, from heat, water and from water, earth. The prevalence of insensibility in the cause of these elements is inferred from observing the excess of inanimate-ness in them. Then in those elements, ether and the rest, arise the qualities of pleasure, pain and insensibility in the proportion in which they exist in their cause.\" These are subtile, rudimen-tary or non-quintuplicated elements. \"The gross elements are those made from combining the five (subtile elements).\n\n...Then in ether, sound is manifested, in air, sound and touch, in heat, sound, touch and form, in earth, sound, touch, form, taste\nin which the quality of *tamas* is more largely associated: (2), *sthula* (gross), the reverse of the other, and this is named *panchikrita* (quintuplicated). It springs from the greater admixture of foulness, and carried to a greater degree, receives the name of ether, the quality attaching to which is sound, and thus considered, air takes its origin which has the two qualities of sound and touch. From predominance of goodness, fire is generated, from which proceed three qualities, the two former and form. From the greater proportions of goodness and foulness, water is manifested which has four qualities, the three former and savour. From excess of darkness, earth is produced, to which appertain the whole five qualities, viz., the four former and smell.\n\nIt is said that through the predominance of goodness, hearing is manifested from ether, tangibility from air, vision from fire, taste from water, and smell from the earth. These five are termed *j\u00f1\u0101nendriya*, organs of perception. From ether comes the power of utterance termed *v\u0101ch*, (speech). From air, the power of the hand (*p\u0101ni*) is manifested: from fire, [82] the power of the foot (*p\u0101dah*). From water, the power of evacuation, *v\u0101yu*; from earth, urinary discharge, called *upastha* (*t\u0101 aidoia*).\n\nIn each of the five, foulness is predominant, and they are called *karmendriya*, organs of action. The majority of Hindu philosophers hold to these opinions.\n\nThrough the predominance of *sattva* a subtile substance proceeds called *antahkarana* (the interior sense), which under four distinct states, has four separate names. That in which goodness predominates and where the intention of distinguishing and investigating enter, is called *chitta* (thinking-principle). Where foulness (or passion) has more promi-\n\nand smell.\" The process of quintuplication is described later by Abul Fazl.\n\n\"The organs of action are the mouth, hand, foot, arms and organ of generation, the five organ of sense are the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the skin.\nnence and doubt arises, it is called *manas*, (mind), and where the proportion of goodness exceeds to such an extent that certainty is attained, it is called *buddhi* (intelligence), and when through excess of darkness, it regards itself and attributes to itself what is extraneous to its own nature, it is called *ahank\u0101ra*, egotism or consciousness.\n\nFrom the non-quintuplicated elements, through the predominance of foulness, five vital airs are generated:\u2014(1), *pr\u0101na*, respiration from mouth and nose; (2) *ud\u0101na*, breathing upwards from the wind pipe; (3), *sam\u0101na* from the stomach; (4), *ap\u0101na*, flatulence; (5), *vy\u0101na*, pervading the whole body. The ten organs (of perception and action) with *antahkarana*, (the interior sense) and the five vital airs, sixteen altogether, are called *lingasarira*\u2074\u2079 or *sukshma-sarira* (the subtile frame). Some distinguish *antahkarana*, the internal sense, as two in regard to (a) intelligence (*buddhi*) and mind (*manas*), and (\u03b2) the thinking principle (*chitta*), with egotism (*ahank\u0101ra*), and thus make seventeen members.\n\nThis body is affirmed to exist in all animals, but by reason of its tenuity is not apprehended by the senses. A living principle is generated which is cognisant of all subtile frames in their entirety, called *Hiranyakarba*\u2075\u2070 (golden womb, or\n\n---\n\n\u2074\u2079 The soul whose desire is fruition is invested with a subtile person, towards the formation of which the evolution of principles proceeds no further than the elementary rudiments (non-quintuplicated). The body is propagated by generation and is perishable. The subtile person is more durable, and capable of transmigration through successive bodies which it assumes as a mimic shifts his disguises. It is primeval, produced by original nature at the initial development of principles, and is of atomic size. v. Colebrooke, I. 257-58.\n\n\u2075\u2070 This is the name given to Brahm\u0101 (in the masculine gender) the intelligent spirit whose birth was in the Golden mundane egg from which he is thus named. M\u0101y\u0101 or the cosmical illusion, is fictitiously associated with Brahma from all-eternity. In the series of aeons without beginning or end, the forms of life have at the beginning of each aeon emanated in, first \u012bvara, the unreal figment of the cosmic fiction, unreal to the philosopher, real to the ignorant multitude; secondly Hiranyakarba, the golden germ, or Pr\u0101na, the breath of life, or Sutr\u0101tman, the Thread-spirit, which is the totality of migrating souls in the state of dreaming sleep. His body\nf\u0153tus) and all that is generated subsequently is believed to emanate from this immaterial form.\n\nThe origin of the gross body is thus described. Each of the (five) subtile elements is divided into moieties, and each of the first five of the ten moieties is subdivided into four equal parts. The remaining (undivided) moiety of subtile ether, combined with one part from each of the other four subtile elements, air, fire, water and earth, produces the coarse or mixed [83] element of ether. The (undivided) moiety of air, combined with one part of ether, fire, water, and earth becomes the mixed element of air. The (undivided) moiety of fire, with one part of ether, water, earth (and air), becomes the mixed element of fire, and so on with water and earth. Others say that the mixed elements of ether and air are formed without the combination of fire, water and earth, but that the mixed elements of fire, water and earth are formed as described. Each of these three is divided into two moieties; one moiety of each is left undivided and the other is divided into three equal parts, which are combined in the manner above stated, and thus these three mixed elements of fire, water, and earth are produced: from these quintuplicated elements, by the predominant combination of one of the threefold qualities (of goodness, foulness and darkness) the fourteen worlds\\(^{51}\\) and their inhabitants are brought into existence. It is said, that a living principle is generated, which discerns all gross bodies. This is termed *Vir\u0101t*.\n\nis the sum of invisible bodies, the tenuous *involucra* in which the soul passes from body to body in eternal palingenesia. (Gough, 53-55).\n\n\\(^{51}\\) These *lokas* or worlds are Bhur, terrestrial; Bhuvar, the atmospheric sphere from the earth to the sun; Svar-loka, heaven; ten million leagues above is Maharloka, the inhabitants of which dwell in it through a day of Brahm\u0101; at twice that distance is Janaloka where Sanandana and other pure-minded sons of Brahm\u0101 reside; at four times the distance is Tapo-loka, the sphere of penance inhabited by deities called Vaibhraj\u0101s, who are unconsumable by fire. At six times the distance is Satya-loka, the sphere of truth, the inhabitants of which never again know death. *Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a*, 213. The remaining seven are the nether worlds.\nThe annihilation of the world is thus described. The earth will be destroyed by water, the water by fire, the fire by air successively, and the air in its turn perishes in ether and ether in M\u0101y\u0101 or illusion, and Ignorance (ajn\u0101na) with its results rises out of this Unreality. Three degrees of this (dissolution) are described. (1) Dainandina (daily), when the (close of) the day of Hiranyakarbh\u0101 which is the same as that of Brahm\u0101, destroys the greater part of creation.\\(^{52}\\) (2) Pr\u0101k\u1e5bita, (elemental), when all creation is absorbed in ajn\u0101na (Ignorance). (3) Atyantika (absolute), when Ignorance ends and Right Apprehension sheds its radiance. The first kind has frequently occurred and will recur. The others happen but once, and Ignorance, with the constant recurrence of works and the co-operation of the wise of heart, together with the three principles [satva, rajas and tamas] before mentioned, will be absorbed into non-existence.\n\nThis system of philosophy is laid down in four books. The first contains an account of Brahma: the second removes the (apparent) discrepancies between form and substance: the third is the preparation of the soul for the reception of divine knowledge, and the fourth on the modes, forms, fruit and effect of its attainment.\n\nThe Hindu sages have divided the Vedas into three portions. The first is the karmak\u0101nda (relating to works), the practical section termed Purva Mim\u0101msa, which has been briefly described as the third school. The second is the j\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101nda, the speculative section, called also Uttara Mim\u0101ms\u0101, celebrated as the Ved\u0101nta. The third is the Up\u0101sana (service) \\([84]\\) which is termed Sankarshana\n\n\\(^{52}\\) The destruction of creatures, not of the substance of the world. The incidental or occasional dissolution is termed naimittika (see p. 147) of this Vol. It is called incidental as occasioned by the interval of Brahm\u0101's days, the destruction occurring during the night. The elemental occurs at the end of Brahm\u0101's life, and the absolute or final, is individual annihilation and exemption from future existence. V. P. 630. Dainandina-pralaya is the destruction of the world after 15 years of Brahm\u0101's age. Monier Williams, Sansk. Dict,\nMim\u0101ms\u0101. This regards the worship of God under a personal aspect, and is not now extant.\n\nThey profess that the study of the Ved\u0101nta is not suitable for every person, nor are its mysterious doctrines to be heard by every ear. The inquirer should accurately investigate what is eternal and non-eternal and discarding from his mind belief in the actuality of existence, he should zealously pursue the objects to be attained. He will then be no longer distressed by the annihilation of sense-perceptions, nor be fettered by pain and pleasure; and will gain a daily increasing hope of final liberation.\n\nS\u0101\u1e45khya.\n\nThe founder of this philosophical system was Kapila. Some assert that the followers of this school do not believe in God. The fact is, however, that they do not affirm the existence of a creator, and creation is ascribed to Nature (Prak\u1e5biti), and the world is said to be eternal. All that is veiled by non-existence is not believed to be non-existent but the caused is absorbed in the cause, as a tortoise retracts its feet within its shell. They accept the doctrine of freedom of will in actions, and of hell, of heaven, and the recompenses of deeds. With regard to emancipation, they agree with the Mim\u0101ms\u0101. Proof (pram\u0101na), is of three kinds. They do not\n\n---\n\n53 For S\u0101\u1e45khya, see Hastings, xi. 189-192. vi. 454, and for Yoga, xii. 831-833. Wilson's Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, ii. 346. Davies and Colebrooke.\n\n54 That is, that the existent is produced from the existent only, as the S\u0101\u1e45khyas hold. Thus, cloth is not distinct from the threads as it abides in the latter. \"As the limbs of a tortoise when retracted within its shell are concealed, and when they come forth are revealed, so the particular effects as cloth, &c., of a cause, as threads, &c., when they come forth and are revealed, are said to be produced; and when they retire and are concealed, are said to be destroyed: but there is no such thing as the production of the nonexistent, or the destruction of the existent.\" Sarva Darsana Sangraha. Cowell, Gough, pp. 225-26, and Colebrooke, i, 266.\n\n55 Perception, inference, and fit testimony.\nbelieve in the soul (\u0101man). Analogy and comparison are not accounted sources of knowledge, nor are time and space, substances, but caused by the motion of the sun. The word tattva (first principle) is used in their treatises for pad\u0101rtha, of which there are twenty-five, and these are comprised under four heads. 1. Prakriti (Nature), which is evolvent and not evolute. 2. Prakriti-vikriti (developments of Nature), evolvent and evolute; these are of seven kinds, viz., mahat (the great one, Buddhi or Intellect), ahank\u0101ra (consciousness or egotism), and five tanm\u0101tra (subtile elements). 3. Vikriti (modifications), are evolutes only, and are not more than sixteen, namely the eleven indriya\u2014(five senses, five organs of action and manas) and the five gross elements (ether, air, light or fire, earth and water). 4. The fourth is neither Nature, nor modification, nor evolvent nor evolute, and is called Purusha, that is Atman, the soul.\n\nThe first of the principles above-mentioned is primordial matter, ilei, which is universal, indiscrete, and possessing the modes of goodness, passion and darkness. The fourth is viewed under two aspects, (a) the Supreme Being, as absolute existence and knowledge, (b) the rational soul, omnipresent, eternal and multitudinous. By the union of the first and fourth, existence and non-existence come into being. Nature is said to be blind. It has not the power of vision nor of perception but only that of flux and reflux and the soul is\n\n---\n\n56 It exists as pure inward light without any instrumentation by which it can become cognisant of the external world. This has been supplied, but it is foreign to the soul and as objective to it as any form of matter. Like Kant, the S\u0101\u1e45khyas hold that there is no knowledge of an external world save as represented by the action of our faculties to the soul, and they take as granted the objective reality of our sense-perceptions. The soul is different in kind from all material things, and will be finally severed from them by an eternal separation. It will then have no object and no function of thought, and will remain self-existent and isolated in a state of passive and eternal repose. v. Davies, pp. 18-20.\n\n57 The theistical S\u0101\u1e45khya, as opposed to the system of Kapila, understands by Purusha, not individual soul alone, but likewise God (\u012asvara) the ruler of the world. Colebrooke, I. 256.\nregarded as a man without feet. When the two conjoin, [85] the renewal and destruction of life come into successive operation. At the time of elemental dissolution, the three modes (of goodness, passion and darkness) are in equipoise. When the time of creation arrives, the mode of goodness preponderates, and Mahat (Intellect) is revealed, and this is considered the first emanation, and it is separate for every human creature. It is also called Buddhi, and is a substance, and the primary seat of eight states or qualities, viz., virtue, vice, knowledge, ignorance, absence of passion or passivity (vir\u0101ga), from which springs perception of the nothingness of worldly things, and indifference; avir\u0101ga its opposite: aisvarya, supernatural power acquired through austerities, and acts that seem incredible or impossible to human vision, of which eight kinds are given in the P\u0101tanjala system: anaisvarya its opposite. Four of the above positive states arise from the predominance of the mode of goodness and the other four from that of darkness. From Mahat (Intellect), proceeds consciousness (ahank\u0101ra). It is the principle of egotism and is the reference of every thing to self. In Mahat (intellect), when the mode, goodness predominates, it is called vaikrita ahank\u0101ra, modified consciousness. If under the influence of the mode, darkness, it is called bhutadi ahank\u0101ra (source of elemental being). If passion is in the ascendant, it becomes taijasa ahank\u0101ra or impellent consciousness. From the first kind of consciousness, the eleven organs proceed, six of sense (including manas) and five of action, as before described. From the second, the five tanm\u0101tra (subtile elements), sound, tangibility, colour or form, savour and odour. These are regarded in this system as subtile substances from which the five gross elements take their rise: from sound, ether; from tangibility, air; from form, fire; from savour, water, and from odour, earth.\n\nThat is, not the exaltation but the predominance of self in thought to the supreme conviction of the sole subjective personality of the thinker. v. Davies and Colebrooke.\nFrom this exposition it is clear that the seven substances mentioned (intellect, consciousness, and the five subtile elements) are on the one hand evolvents, and on the other evolutes; and the sixteen, that is, the eleven organs and the five gross elements, are evolutes. The soul (\u0101tman) is considered neither evolvent nor evolute. The five senses are held to be organs of perception, and manas discriminates between advantage and detriment. Consciousness cognizes itself by act or the omission of act, and intellect determines one or the other. From the five gross elements, other productions are evolved, but as tattvas, are incapable of further creations, causality is not attributed to them.\n\nThe elemental order of creation is sixfold:\u2014(1) svarga-loka, the world above, in the constitution of which goodness prevails: (2) mrityu-loka, (world of death), the abode of men, in which foulness or passion predominates: p\u0101t\u0101la-loka, the world beneath, in which darkness is prevalent: devat\u0101 (superior order of being) in which the element of goodness is predominant. [86] Through their extraordinary power they can appear in divers shapes, and assume astonishing appearances, and from the transparency of their essence their true forms are invisible to the sight. There are eight orders of these:\u2014(1) Br\u0101hma, blessed spirits, that inhabit the abode of Brahm\u0101. (2) Pr\u0101j\u0101patya: Praj\u0101pati is the name of a great divinity to whom is assigned a sphere, and those that dwell therein are thus styled. (3) Aindra: Indra is the regent of the heavens, to whom a sphere is likewise referrible, and its dwellers are thus denominated. (4) Paitra: the belief of the Hindu sage is that each individual\u2019s progenitors that have died after a life of good works, will receive celestial shapes and enjoy their recompense in a special abode. The devat\u0101s therein, are called by this name. (5) Gandharva: this is said to be a sphere where the heavenly choristers reside. (6) Y\u0101ksha: in this sphere the Yakshas dwell; they are great\n\n59 Relating or consecrated to the Manes, Sanskrit pitarah.\nministering spirits, the guardian of the north. (7) R\u0101k\u1e63asa, is a sphere inhabited by the R\u0101k\u1e63hasas, who are the malignant fiends of these orders and who slay men. (8) Pi\u015b\u0101cha: by this name an order of beings is defined who are characterized by an evil nature and perverted intelligence. They are less powerful than the R\u0101k\u1e63hasas, and are assigned a special sphere, and extraordinary legends are related of each of these orders.\n\nThe Animal creation (tiryagyonya) is one in which the mode rajas (passion or foulness), prevailed at its production and is of five kinds:\u2014(1) pasu, domestic animals; (2) m\u1e5biga, wild animals; (3) pakshi, birds; (4) sarisripa, creeping things applied to the different reptiles and fishes; (5) sth\u0101vara, the vegetable kingdom. M\u0101nushya, man, was produced through excess of the quality of passion. The general opinion adopts this division and belief. At the dissolution of the world, these creations perish with the five elements, and the elements are absorbed in the five tanm\u0101tras (rudimentary elements) which again are veiled in egotism (ahank\u0101ra), and this in turn is absorbed in the secret recesses of mahat, intellect, which is (finally) lost in the pure depths of Prakriti (Nature).\n\nPain is of three kinds:\u2014(1) \u0101dhy\u0101tmika, intrinsic pain, both bodily and mental; [87] (2) \u0101dhidaivika, supernatural pain or calamity from a divine source, and (3) \u0101dhibhautika, extrinsic pain arising from the natural source of the elements. Bandha, bondage, is the source of all that fetters the spirit and debars it from emancipation.\n\nPr\u0101kritika signifies one who holds Nature (Prakriti), in place of God. Vaikritika is one who from ignorance assumes the eleven organs (of action and sense), (indriya) to be the Supreme Being. Dakshina (religious offerings or oblations\n\n---\n\n60 An account of these various orders will be found in the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a.\n61 This was the fifth or animal creation. The compound is derived from the Sanskrit tiryak, crooked or horizontal, applied to an animal (as not erect) and yoni, womb, or source.\nin general) implies the being attached to the performance of works and believing them to be the ultimate aim of spirituality.\n\nThey affirm that he whose mind is concentrated upon one object (of contemplation) and the fruition of the celestial abode, if the subject of his absorption be the first-mentioned and his thoughts be thus continuously applied in efficacious devotion, he attains to the enjoyment of bliss in the sphere above for a hundred thousand manvantaras,\\(^{62}\\) after which he returns to this world; in the organs of sense and action (indriya), during ten manvantaras, in the elements during one hundred, in consciousness (ahank\u0101ra), during one thousand, and in intellect (mahat), during ten thousand, he enjoys the fruition of heavenly delights; after which term he reverts to this earth. A manvantara is one and seventy enumerations of the four ages.\\(^{63}\\) For each good action a period of heavenly bliss is allotted: for instance, he who gives to a Brahman sufficient ground for the erection of a house, will be compensated by ten kalpas in heaven, a kalpa being equivalent to four yugas. He who bestows a thousand cows in charity, passes one kr\u014dr and 14,000 kalpas in paradise, and after numerous alterations of earth and heaven, the severance between nature (Prakriti) and the soul (Purusha) is evolved before the vision, and right apprehension arises. This is the\n\n\\(^{62}\\) 12,000 years of the gods or 4,320,000 mortals.\n\n\\(^{63}\\) Thus the Krita Yuga 4,800  \nTreta ,, 3,600  \nDv\u0101para ,, 2,400  \nKali ,, 1,200  \n\n12,000 years of the gods.\n\nBy multiplying each of the above by 360, a year of men being a day of the gods, the total is 4,320,000 for a Mah\u0101-yuga or great age: this multiplied by 71 = 306,720,000. According to the Vishnu Pur\u0101na there is a surplus which Wilson shows to be the number of years required to reconcile two computations of the Kalpa. The later is equal to 1,000 great ages or \\(4,320,000 \\times 1,000 = 4,320,000,000\\). But a day of Brahm\u0101 is also 71 times a Great Age, multiplied by 14: or \\(4,320,000 \\times 71 \\times 14 = 4,294,080,000\\) or less than the preceding by 25,920,000 and it is to make up this deficiency that an addition is made to the computation by manvantras. See the V. P., p. 24, p. 6. Abul Fazl makes a Kalpa to consist of four Yugas only.\ngoal of emancipation and the renewal of embodiments ceases for ever.\n\nThis school also like that of the Ved\u0101nta, recognises two kinds of body, the linga sarira, or subtile frame, consisting of eighteen members, viz., the eleven organs of action and sense with manas, the five subtile elements, with intellect and consciousness. The other is the sthula sarira or gross body, and death signifies the divulsion of the one from the other, the subtile frame continuing till final liberation.\n\nThe subjects of this system are treated in sixty tantras which like the term adhy\u0101ya is used for division or chapter.\n\nThe first treats of the existence of Nature and the soul; the second describes Nature as one: the third shows the distinction between the soul and Nature: the fourth, that there is no effect without a cause: the fifth that Nature exists as the root-evolvent of all other forms: the sixth, that all evolved action must be associated with one of the three qualities; [88] the seventh, that the separation of the soul from Nature is attained through perfect knowledge: the eighth, the association of these two with Ignorance: the ninth, that in the light of perfect knowledge when Nature ceases from alterations of embodiment, if for a time the elemental form should continue to endure, it is solely through the residuum of ignorance otherwise it would also perish: the tenth, that causality lies in Nature and not in the soul, and it treats of the five states of the five afflictions (klesa), viz., ignorance, egotism, desire, aversion and ardent attachment to life, as briefly alluded to in the P\u0101tanjala school. Twenty-eight topics treat of the defect of the twenty-eight faculties of the eleven indriya, and the seventeen injuries of Intellect. Nine topics treat of the nine distinctions of acquiescence (tushti):\u2014(1) Prakriti-tushti, (relating to matter), concentration of thought on Nature and contemplation thereof, in the belief that Nature will increase knowledge and sever the soul from itself: (2) Up\u0101d\u0101na-tushti (relating to means), the knowledge that Nature of itself will\nsolve no difficulty, and that until the heart is detached from all objects, the end is not attainable: (3) K\u0101latushti, (relating to time), the notion that all desires are fulfilled by the passing away of time, upon which therefore, the mind should be fixed while the heart is detached: (4) Bh\u0101gya-tushti (relating to fortune); in the knowledge that to the many the world passes away and effects nothing, to understand that the solution of difficulties rests with fortune and to turn thereunto freeing the mind from all other attachment; (5) P\u0101ra-tushti, withdrawal from all worldly unsubstantial pleasures in the assurance that thousands have sought them with pain and profited nothing thereby, and hence to abandon their pursuit: (6) sup\u0101ra-tushti, to detach the heart from personal possessions, in the view that they have no stability, since tyrants may take them by force, and thieves may by cunning, steal; (7) P\u0101r\u0101p\u0101ra-tushti, abstinence from pleasures of sense with the knowledge that even if followed by personal gratification, they must cease, and to such as these, attachment is vain: (2) Anuttam\u0101mbhas-tushti, detachment from all enjoyments, from consciousness of pain in their loss: (9) Uttam\u0101mbhas-tushti, detachment from pleasure with the motive of avoiding injury to others.84\n\nEight tantras or topics treat of the eight perfections (siddhi): (1) uha-siddhi (reasoning), without the necessity of reading to understand a subject by the light of reason: (2) sabda siddhi (oral instruction), without need of teaching, to understand by the mere hearing of the words: [89] (3) adhyayana-siddhi (study), becoming wise by the perception of truths: (4) suhridpr\u0101pti-siddhi, attaining knowledge by intercourse of friends: (5) d\u0101na-siddhi, (gift), serving one who accepts an invitation to a repast, or the bestowal of a gift.\n\n84 Three kinds of prevention of pain which would make up the eight, have been for some reason omitted by Abul Fazl, and he has accounted for only fifty-five out of the sixty topics. The remainder are partly included in those mentioned, and may be seen in Colebooke, and in Dr. Garbe's translation of Aniruddha's Commentary.\non him, and manifesting a desire of knowledge and success in obtaining it.\n\n**PATANJALA.**\n\nThe founder of this system was the sage Patanjali.\\(^{65}\\)\n\nWith regard to the predicaments and the nature of proof and other points, he follows the S\u0101\u1e45khya, but he acknowledges a Supreme Being whom he holds to be absolute existence and intelligence. The creation\\(^{66}\\) of the five subtile elements (tanm\u0101tra), he believes to proceed directly from intellect (mahat) without the intermediate agency of ahank\u0101ra (consciousness). From vaikrita ahank\u0101ra (modified consciousness), when the mode of goodness prevails, the five external senses are produced, and from taijasa ahank\u0101ra, (ardent consciousness), when the mode of passion is predominant, the five organs of action (karmendriya) arise, and from the combined\n\n---\n\n\\(^{65}\\) For Patanjali, see Hastings, ix. 670, and for Yoga sutra also vii. 565. The Yoga sutra has been translated into English with a commentary, by Dr. R. L. Mitra. The accounts of this philosopher and grammarian are like those of the founders of the preceding systems, meagre and legendary. The period in which he flourished is disputed. But though the antiquity of the system is undoubted, it is not the case with the text-books which are, of all the systems, of later date than Buddha. The Yoga Sutra takes for granted the twenty-five categories of the S\u0101\u1e45khya as the basis of its doctrine and copies some of its aphorisms verbatim. I have previously mentioned the common references to each other of the text-books of the other schools. The cardinal difference between the S\u0101\u1e45khya and the Yoga lies in their theistic and atheistic belief, and hence, it is that the Hindus call the Yoga the Sesvara S\u0101\u1e45khya or theistical, as opposed to the atheistical or Nirisvara S\u0101\u1e45khya.\n\n\\(^{66}\\) The punctuation in the text is incorrect and misleading and must be altered in accordance with the translation. The physical substratum of consciousness is affected by the modes like every other emanation of Prakriti. From the influence of 'goodness', it produces the ten organs and the manas which are called 'good', because of their utility: but it is only when affected by the mode 'darkness' that inanimate matter is created. The passion-mode, (taijasa) ardent or glowing, being the exciting mode, must co-operate in the production of all. Davies, p. 60. The Supreme Being with this system is a soul untouched by affliction, action, fruit or stock of desert, who of his own will assumed a body to create. Sarva Darsana Sangraha. He facilitates according to Dr. Mitra the attainment of liberation, but does not directly grant it and though the creator of the world is absolutely unconnected with it.\ninfluence of goodness and passion springs *manas* or mind. They believe that the subtile frame (*sukshma sarira*) is subject to extinction, but receives new birth when another body is produced until final liberation is accomplished. But this is not attained without Yoga which is the cardinal doctrine of this attractive system. The thinking principle, *Chitta*, is the substrate of *manas*. *Vritti* (function), is the action of *manas* in the acquisition of good and evil qualities. *Nirodha* (suppression) is the restraint of those functions in action and the attainment of quiescence. Yoga or meditation is then secured when the root of desire is obstructed from advance. Certain means to this end are laid down, and I here make a brief abstract in the hope that it may prove of value to the heart-stricken in the path of search. It is said that through the union with *Mahat* (Intellect) of *manas* and the three qualities, five conditions or states of the thinking principle arise which are called the five stages (*bhumi*). These are, (1) *kshipa* (restless activity), the heart from the predominance of passion being never at rest; (2) *mudha* (bewildered), from excess of darkness, being quiescent without attaining the object sought; (3) *vikshipa* (voluptuousness), from excess of the quality of goodness, the goal is reached and a certain repose is secured, but through excess of passion (*rajas*), this is not lasting, and the mind becomes dissipated; (4) *Ek\u0101gra* (concentration), through excess of goodness, power is obtained to keep the mind from wandering from the subject of meditation; (5) *Niruddha* (the suppressive state) is a condition in which by dissolution of the three qualities, the mental *residua* (*anamneisis*) of active volition are effaced and (those of) the quiescent or suppressive state arise.\n\n---\n\n67 This is the same as the S\u0101\u1e45khya *mahat* and the Buddhist *buddhi*, or what Schopenhauer understands by Will, the absolute existence from which primordial root all organic and inorganic being proceed.\n\n68 I read *numaid* for *nam\u0101nd*. The definition of the suppressive state seems to apply to what is called \"suppressive modification\" (*nirodhaparin\u0101ma*) thus defined by the *Parichchhed\u0101 Bh\u0101\u1e63ya*: \"the\nUnder the first three conditions, Yoga or meditation, is rarely obtained. They assert that under the first condition manas is the recipient of unrighteousness: [90] under the second, of ignorance; under the third, of sensuousness (avir\u0101ga) and impotence (anaisvarya); under the fourth, of virtue, (dharma), absence of passion (vir\u0101ga), and supernatural power (aisvarya); and under the fifth, the residua of good and evil are suppressed and functions (vritti), are dissolved. These latter are of two kinds, klishti (painful), tendency to evil works, and aklishti, tendency to good works and each according to its good or evil tendency is five-fold. (1) Pram\u0101navritti (right notion); perception of things by proof is attained through prevalence of sattv\u0101 (goodness); (2) viparyaya, (misconception) arises from prevalence of goodness and darkness.\n\nIf this abides in the person forming a definite conclusion it is called vipariti, (perverted) but if he be in uncertainty whether a thing be itself or some thing else, it is called sansaya, doubt; (3) vikalpa (fancy), ambiguity regarding a thing, arising from goodness and darkness; (4) nidra (sleep), the state of sleep arising from excess of darkness in which consciousness is lost. The opinion of other Hindu philosophers is\n\nresidua of the waking state are the attributes of the thinking principle, but they are not intelligent. The residua of suppression produced by the intelligence of the suppressive state, are also the attributes of the thinking principle. On the overthrow and success (prevalence) of the two, the residua of the waking state are put down and those of the suppressive state rise up, and there is then a correlation of the thinking principle, and the changes thus constantly occurring in a thinking principle is suppressive modification.\" Dr. Mitra deserves, \"The theory is, that every image, shape, or idea exists from eternity in a latent form, circumstances make it manifest, and when those circumstances are over it reverts to its former condition.\" This is in fact that Platonic notion of ideas, and their objective reality either ante rem as eternal archetypes in the divine intelligence or in re, as forms inherent in matter. This formed in the 12th century, the Realist side of the controversy with Plato and Aristotle, against the Nominalists with Zeno.\n\n\"A notion without reference to the real character of the object.\" Dr. Mitra.\n\n\"The aphorism is, 'sleep is that function (of the thinking principle) which has for its object the conception of nothing': that\nthat the mind is withdrawn from its peculiar association with the senses; (5) smriti (memory), is the recovery through the influence of goodness of what has passed from the mind. In the fourth state, the second, third and fourth functions cease and in the fifth, the first and fifth are dissolved and final liberation is attained.\n\nAlthough this sublime contingency does not occur save by prosperous fortune and the divine favour, yet the sagacity of the experienced base its acquisition on twelve principles.\n\n1. Meditation on the divinity (Isvara-up\u0101sana), that is, to illuminate the interior spirit by constant thought of God and to be conscious of its freedom from four things, afflictions, works, deserts, desires. Klesa (affliction) signifies the sum of grief and pain, and this is five-fold: (1) avidy\u0101, ignorance of the reality of things; (2) asmit\u0101 (egotism), conceiving oneself to possess that which one has not; (3) r\u0101ga, desire for one's own gratification; (4) dvesha, aversion, or anger; (5) abhinivesa (ardent attachment to life), fear of death. Karma (works), signifies merit and demerit (from works). Vip\u0101ka, (deserts), the recompense of actions. Asaya, thought regarding merits and demerits which after effacement may recur.\n\n[91] Those who have reached the goal in this path, assert that assiduous meditation on God after this manner, annihilates all evil propensities and exterminates nine depredators of the road. These are (1) vy\u0101dhi, sickness; (2) sty\u0101na (langour), indisposition (of the thinking principle) to efficacious work; (3) sansaya, doubt regarding the (practicable) means of meditation and its results; (4) pram\u0101da (carelessness), forgetfulness of the duties of meditation; (5) \u0101lasya, slothfulness in the performance of these duties; (6) avirati, (worldly mindedness), propensity (of the thinking principle) to enjoy the pleasures of the world; (7) bhr\u0101nti-darsana, error in per-\n\nthis is a function of the thinking principle and not a mere blank is said to be proved by our recollection on arising from sleep of having slept well which could not happen without a consciousness of it. Yoga Aph., 12.\nception, (such as mistaking mother of pearl for silver): (8) alabdha-bhumikatva, (non-attainment of any stage), the non-attainment of the fourth out of the five states: (9) anavas-thitatva (instability), not abiding in the fourth stage and receding from it.\n\nII. Sraddh\u0101, (inclination), zeal in following the Yoga and making it the sum of desire.\n\nIII. Virya (energy), seeking the fulfilment of the object sought with much eagerness.\n\nIV. Sm\u1e5biti (memory), retaining in view the transcendent advantages and great results of this devotion, and never relaxing attention.\n\nV. Maitri (friendliness), desiring the welfare of humanity.\n\nVI. Karun\u0101, (compassion), being distressed at the sorrows and affliction of mankind, and resolving to relieve them.\n\nVII. Mudit\u0101, (gladness), being pleased in the happiness of others.\n\nVIII. Upek\u1e63h\u0101, (indifference), avoiding the wrong-doer lest evil principles be acquired, and yet not entertaining malevolence nor rebuking him.71\n\nIX. Sam\u0101dhi, (meditation), unity of intention and contemplation of one object.\n\nX. Praj\u00f1\u0101 (discernment), allowing only understanding, rectitude, and the search after truth to enter the mind.\n\nXI. Vair\u0101gya, (dispassion), is of various kinds, its ultimate stage being detachment from all, and contentment with only the Supreme Being.\n\nXII. Abhy\u0101sa (exercise), being uninterruptingly assi-\n\n---\n\n71 This indifference is to be acquired both as to pleasure and pain, by friendliness towards the happy, compassionating the sorrowful, being content with the virtuous and neither encouraging nor reproving the vicious. This condition of mind facilitates the meditation called Sam\u0101dhi, in its external aspect by removing distractions, and producing concentration, through cheerfulness of mind,\nduous in the control of knowledge and action till this (steadfastness) becomes habitual.\n\nIn the works on this system, Isvara-up\u0101san\u0101, vair\u0101gya and abhy\u0101sa are treated together: five separate expositions are allotted to virya, sraddh\u0101, smriti, sam\u0101dhi and praj\u00f1a, and the four following maitri, karun\u0101, mudit\u0101 and upek\u1e63h\u0101 are likewise separately discussed. They have all been concurrently reviewed in this work.\n\nIn this field of philosophy, Yoga is regarded as two-fold, (1) sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi (conscious meditation), directing the easily distracted mind to one object and gradual concentration on the ideal conception of the Divine Being; and (2) asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta (unconscious meditation), in which this ideal conception of the divinity ceases, and absorption in unitive communion with its essence is obtained. The first is of three kinds, (1) Gr\u0101hya-sam\u0101patti (Tangible Forms), meditation on one of the five gross elements. With regard to the gross and subtile elements it is two-fold. The latter is termed vitark\u0101nugati, (attendant argumentation) and the former vich\u0101r\u0101nugati, (attendant deliberation). Vitark\u0101nugati is of two kinds; savitarka (argumentative meditation), when the cogitation is regarding the relation of words to their meanings, and nirvitarka (non-argumentative), when it is independent of this relation. Vich\u0101r\u0101nugati is cogitation on one of the eight principles, viz., nature, intellect, consciousness, and the five subtile elements. If the element be considered in its relation to time and space, it is called savich\u0101ra (deliberative), and if otherwise nirvich\u0101ra (non-deliberative).\n\nII. Grahana-sam\u0101patti (Acceptance Form), is cogitation on one of the organs of sense which with reference to time, space, and cause is termed savitarka, and if in regard to the inherent meaning only, vitarka, and both kinds are called S\u0101nanda (joyous).72\n\n72 The commentator explains that when the quality of goodness of the internal organ, tinctured with a little of the qualities of foul-\nIII. Grihitri-sam\u0101patti (Form of the taker). In this stage the votary withdraws himself from all other pre-occupation, and is merged in the single contemplation of the Supreme Soul. This also in relation to time and space receives the two names above-mentioned, and both kinds are termed Asmit\u0101 (Egotism).\n\nAsampraj\u00f1\u0101ta is two-fold:\u2014(1) Bhavapratyaya (caused by the world), not distinguishing Nature from the soul, nor holding it to be separate from the elements or the organs of action and sense. If Nature is cognized as soul, this meditative state is called Prakritilaya (resolved into nature), and if the elements and organs be so cognized, it is termed videha, (unembodied). (2) Up\u0101ya-pratyaya (means of ascertainment); by good fortune and a happy destiny, under the guidance of the twelve principles above-mentioned, the cognition of the soul is attained and the fruition of bliss secured at the desired goal where final emancipation presents itself to view.\n\nThe devotees of the Yoga practice are of four classes. The first, called Pr\u0101thama kalpika, (entering upon the course) is he who with firm resolve and steadfast foot enters upon this waste of mortification. The second, Madhubhumika (in the honey-stage), is he who by mortification of the senses and right conduct, effaces rust from the mirror of the heart to such degree that he can divine the reflections in another's mind and see whatever from its minuteness is imperceptible to others. The third, Praj\u00f1\u0101jyotis (illuminated), by happy fortune and zealous endeavour subdues the organs of sense and the elements, and the far and the near, with reference to sight and hearing, &c., become relatively the same to him, and he acquires power to create and destroy. The fourth, Atikranta bh\u0101vaniya (attaining the highest dispassion), is one to whom the past becomes present.\n\nness and darkness, is pondered, then consciousness being under the influence of goodness, becomes S\u0101nanda or joyous. Yoga Aphorisms, p. 18.\nIt is said that conscious meditation consists of eight particulars and these are, as it were, intrinsic parts thereof, in contradistinction to the twelve principles which are accounted extrinsic means. They are called *Asht\u0101\u1e45ga-Yoga* (meditation on eight particular parts of the body). [94] These are:\u2014(1) *Yama*, (2) *Niyama*, (3) *Asana*, (4) *Pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma*, (5) *Praty\u0101h\u0101ra*, (6) *Dh\u0101rana*, (7) *Dhy\u0101na*, (8) *Sam\u0101dhi*.\n\n*Yama*, restraint, is five-fold:\u2014(1) *Ahins\u0101* (non-slaughter), avoiding destruction of life and injury (to others). When this habit is formed, in a devotee, enemies are conciliated: (2) *Satya* (veracity) is the habitual practice of speaking the truth, and thus securing acceptance of his desires\\(^{73}\\): (3) *Asteya*, (non-theft), the non-appropriation of goods beyond what is customarily permitted: the keys of the world\u2019s treasures are entrusted to the observer of this principle: (4) *Brahmacharya* (continence), to obtain from women, by which means the ignorant will be able to light the lamp of knowledge from the inspired efficacy of his will. (5) *Aparigraha* (non-avarice), retaining nothing of worldly goods which, being regarded as the capital source of pain, should be abandoned and by this the future will be revealed.\n\n*Niyama* (obligation), is also five-fold:\u2014(1) *Saucha* (purification), internal and external purity, avoiding association with men, and acquiring self-control; (by this means) the mind is rendered essentially stainless, commendable desires bear fruit, and the fourth state is reached: (2) *Santosha* (contentedness), desisting from improper desires and being satisfied with the fulfilment of this excellent devotion. Happiness is thus obtained and worldly pleasures have no relish: (3) *Tapas*, (penance), mortification of the spirit and body and enduring heat, cold, hunger, thirst, and silence, until all five afflictions are effaced from the tablet of the mind. Through this practice the votary gains the faculty of seeing\n\n\\(^{73}\\) Another reading runs 'and thus desires cease to be inclined to evil.'\nthings distant, concealed or minute and can assume any form at will. (4) Sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya (sacred study), repetition of the names of the deity, and recounting his attributes and all that is conducive to liberation. If there is inability to read, then by the constant repetition of the word Omk\u0101ra,\\textsuperscript{74} the deities and other celestial spirits associate with him and vouchsafe him their assistance. [95] (5) Isvara pranidh\u0101na (devotion to God), is absolute resignation to the will of God; by this means various faculties of knowledge are acquired and illumination regarding all the degrees of perfection is attained.\n\nAsana (posture), signifies sitting. The austere recluses of this temple of retirement, give the number of these as eighty-four, of which thirteen are esteemed the most efficacious, and each has a special mode and a separate name. Under their influence, cold, heat, hunger and thirst are little felt. Some learned Hindu authorities reckon the same number of sitting attitudes for those who are still attached to worldly concerns but of a different kind. The writer of these pages who has witnessed many of these postures, has gazed in astonishment, wondering how any human being could subject his muscles, tendons and bones in this manner to his will.\n\nPr\u0101n\u0101y\u0101ma, regulation of the breath at will, is three-fold:\u2014(1) Puraka (inspiration), drawing in the breath by the nose in the following manner: with the thumb of the right hand let the left nostril be closed and the breath slowly inspired by the right nostril. (2) Kumbhaka\\textsuperscript{75} (suspension),\n\n\\textsuperscript{74} The abbreviated form of this ejaculatory prayer, Om, is a combination of three letters a, u, m, invested with a peculiar sanctity. According to Wilson (Vish. Pur.) it is typical of the three spheres of the world, the three steps of Vishnu, &c., and in the Vedas is said to comprehend all the gods, and one text of the Vedas, \"Om, the monosyllable Brahma,\" is cited in the V\u0101gya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, which devotes a whole chapter to this term, as signifying by the latter word, either the Supreme Being or the Vedas collectively, of which the monosyllable is the type.\n\n\\textsuperscript{75} This term is derived from kumbha, a jar, because the vital air at that time remains quiescent as water in a jar. Hastings, Ency. ix. 490-492, long discussion of Om.\nto retain the breath within and to make as long an inspiration as possible closing both nostrils with the thumb and little finger of the right hand. The ascetics of this country can so hold their breath that they will breathe but once in twelve years. (3) Rechaka (expiration), letting out the drawn breath, very gradually, with the thumb pressed below the right nostril and removing the little finger from the left nostril, suffering it to escape. In short, to inspire with the right and expire with the left nostril. These three functions constitute the Pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma. It is said that the breath extends as far as sixteen fingers from the nose, and some say twelve. By this operation the mind is quiescent, and perfect knowledge is obtained; but this is secured only through the assistance of an experienced master of this knowledge.\n\nAt this time the devotee should abstain from meat, hot spices and acid and saline food, and be content with a little milk and rice. He must also avoid the society of women lest his brain be distracted and melancholy ensue.\n\nPraty\u0101h\u0101ra (abstraction), is the withdrawal of the five senses from their respective objects of perception. When the mind is quiescent, these perforce cannot escape. Thus objects may present themselves before him without exciting desire.\n\nDh\u0101rana (steadiness), is the confinement of the thinking principle to one place, such as the navel, the crown of the head, between the eyebrows, the point of the nose, or the tip of the tongue.\n\nDhy\u0101na (contemplation), is uninterrupted reflection on what is before the mind, and the absence of every thing but the object, the thought, and the thinking principle of the individual contemplating.\n\n[96] Sam\u0101dhi (meditation); in this the thinker and the consciousness of thought are both effaced. At this stage the\n\n74 This is a more advanced stage of contemplation than Dhy\u0101na in which the ideas of objects other than the one in view are suppressed, but not altogether effaced. In sam\u0101dhi the effacement\ndegrees of conscious meditation are surmounted and unconscious meditation begins, till perfect knowledge is attained and Yoga is finally reached. This condition is called Sam\u0101dhi.\n\nThe first and second of these eight processes are likened to the sowing of seed in a field; the third and fourth are as the commencement of growth; the fifth is the flower; the sixth, seventh and eighth are regarded as the stages of fructification.\n\nThe last-named three-fold acts are termed Sanyama.\\(^{7}\\) At this period, the most extraordinary powers are witnessed in the adept which astonish the beholder.\n\nThe occult powers are termed Aisvarya and are eight in number.\n\n(1) Anim\u0101 (molecularity), the power of minute disintegration so as to pass through the tissues of a diamond. (2) Mahim\u0101 (illimitability), capacity of prolongation so as to touch the moon. (3) Laghim\u0101 (tenuity), to possess such extreme levity as to ascend to the upper regions on a beam of light. (4) Garim\u0101 (gravity) to acquire illimitable ponderosity. In some works the word Pr\u0101pti (accessibility), is used for the fourth term, and signifies to reach to any point at will. (5) Pr\u0101kamya (irresistible will), to sink into the earth and to rise up elsewhere as if in water. (6) Isitva (sovereignty), the power of creating or destroying. (7) Vasitva (subjugation), to command the elements and their products. (8) K\u0101m\u0101vas\u0101yitva (self-control), the fulfilment of every wish.\n\nAlthough this language may seem incredible in the eyes of those affected by the taint of narrow custom, those who\n\n\\(^{7}\\) The word is derived from the intensive particle sam prefixed to yama, restraint, and means vow, binding or confinement, and indicates three means of accomplishing the Yoga. Yoga Aph., p. 125.\nacknowledge the wonderful power of God will find in it no cause of astonishment.\n\nThe doctrines of this great system are comprised in one 'Adhy\u0101ya or section, divided into four charana, (feet or) chapters. The first is an exposition of the nature of Yoga meditation. The second on the means of its acquirement. The third, on the wonders of the occult powers. The fourth on the liberation of the soul.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nJAINA\n\n[97] The founder of this wonderful system was Jina, called also Arhat' or Arhant. With regard to the Supreme Being, and the doctrines of voluntary actions, rewards, punishments, hell and heaven, they follow the Mim\u0101ms\u0101 and the S\u0101\u1e45khya. In Svar-loka twenty-six degrees are assigned to the last mentioned abode (heaven) in three groups of twelve, nine and five, in the highest of which dwell the most perfect among the chosen of God. Bodies are believed to be compounded of indivisible atoms. The four elements are composed of homogeneous atoms, and the substrate of each element is different. The world regarded in its atoms is eternal, but non-eternal in its form. Existence takes place on the union of five principles:\u2014(1) Niyata (crude matter) potentiality of cause. (2) K\u0101la, determinate time. (3) Svabh\u0101va\n\n1 For the Jaina philosophy, Hastings, vii. 465-574, x. 493-495 (purification), and xii. 799-80 : (worship). The Jains take this name from the term Jina, a deified Saint, a being worthy of universal adoration and having subdued all passions, equivalent to Arhat, Jinesvara, T\u012brthankara and other synonyms of this incarnate being. Colebrooke (Essay, II, 171) mentions 24 Jinas or Arhats, who have appeared in the present Avasarpini age. The most celebrated of the Jinas, was P\u0101r\u015bvanatha of the race of Ikshw\u0101ku, and is thought by Colebrooke and Lassen to be the real founder of the sect. The last Jina, was Vardham\u0101na, named also Vira, Mah\u0101v\u012bra &c. His life and institutions form the subject of the Kalpa Sutra translated both by Stevenson (very faultily according to Weber), and Jacobi. They deny with the Bauddhas or Saugatas, the divine authority, of the Vedas, and admit like the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, the eternity of matter and the perpetuity of the world. Their avoidance of injury to life is wellknown. Like the Buddhists they are divided into a clerical body, Yatis or ascetics, and laity, Sravakas, (hearers) and observe the rules of caste without attaching any religious significance to it.\n\nHermann Jacobi in his preface to the Jaina Sutras, with Colebrooke and Stevenson asserts the independent rise of the Jaina creed against the combined authority of Lassen, Wilson, Weber and Barth, who derive it from Buddhism. This point is discussed in Hastings, Ency., ii. 495-496;\ninherent nature. (4) Atma the rational soul. (5) Purvakrita, the result of good and evil in former births. Some Hindu philosophers ascribe the creation to God, some to Time, and others to the results of actions, and others again to inherent nature (svabh\u0101ba). Their belief is that the whole universe will not perish, but that some of every kind will survive from the whirlwind of non-existence whence creation will be renewed.\n\nThis sect allow only two predicaments:\u2014Pram\u0101na (proof) and Prameya (objects of thought). The first of these is two-fold:\u2014(1) Pratyaksha, perception by the five external senses, and by the mind and the soul. The Ny\u0101ya, applies this term to the means by which perfect knowledge is obtained. (2) Paroksha (imperceptibility), knowledge obtained not mediately through the senses.\n\nPratyaksha (perception) is two-fold. (1) Vy\u0101vah\u0101rika (conventional, or practical): this is acquired by the five senses and manas, is employed in external affairs, and called matij\u00f1\u0101na (mind-knowledge). This is also two-fold, namely, that which (\u03b1) is apprehended through the five senses, and (\u03b2) apprehended through manas (mind), which this sect does not include among the five senses; and each of these two again is four-fold: (1) Avagraha, distinguishing from the type whether it be horse or man but not discerning the characteristics: (2) Iha inquiring, as to whence the man, and from what country the horse: (3) Av\u0101ya arriving at a correct identification of the above: [98] (4) Dh\u0101rana, recollecting the thing particularised and keeping it in mind. (II) P\u0101ram\u0101rthika (transcendental), knowledge that comes from the illumination of the rational soul and is profitable to emancipation. It is two-fold: viz. Vikala (defective), knowing something and not knowing some other: and Sakala, (entire), knowing all, called also Kevala-j\u00f1\u0101na (pure unalloyed knowledge). Vikala is again subdivided into Avadhi-j\u00f1\u0101na (limited knowledge), knowledge of special objects which near or remote,\nare not differentiated;\u00b2 and Manas-pary\u0101ya-jn\u0101na, definite knowledge of another's thoughts and the laying bare of the secrets of the heart.\u00b3\n\nParoksha (imperceptibility) is five-fold. (1) Smarana, recollection of what is unseen. (2) Praty-abhijn\u0101na, knowledge derived from witness of another. (3) Tarka, the knowledge of the mutual relation between subject and predicate. (4) Anum\u0101na, knowledge from inference, which is established in a series of ten terms, given in detail. (5) Sabda, the knowledge obtained from the narration of a speaker without partiality or affection, of clear understanding and true in speech.\n\nPrameya (objects of thought) are six-fold and each is regarded as an eternal substance, and not an aggregate of a determinate measure of atoms; they are likewise held to be imperceptible to the eye and pervade all space. The first is the soul which is a subtile substance in which intelligence abides. It is to the body as the light of a lamp to a house and is believed to be the active agent, or passive recipient of good and evil. It is, of two kinds, Par\u0101tm\u0101 and Jiv\u0101tm\u0101. The first is restricted to the Supreme Being and is distinguished by four attributes. Ananta-jn\u0101na or analytic knowledge extending to the most minute atoms. Ananta-darsana or synthetic knowledge of things collectively. Ananta-virya, infinite power. Ananta-sukha, infinite happiness.\n\nThey do not accept the doctrine of divine incarnations but believe that a man by virtue becomes omniscient, and his utterances in regard to the things appertaining to the spiritual and temporal life are the word of God, and such a one is termed S\u0101k\u0101ra-Paramesvara (Divinity in bodily form). [99] In the six aras,\u2074 of which mention has been made in a previous\n\n\u00b2 That is, the abolition of hindrances causes their right intuition.\n\u00b3 By the absence of all envy, by sympathy and the like.\n\u2074 These are the six periods into which each of the Utsarpini and Avasarpini ages are divided. Their names are given in Major Mackenzie's account of the Jains in Vol. IX. As. Research, p. 257.\nsection, twenty-four such beings come into existence, and in the third and fourth, their earthly existence terminates.\\(^5\\)\n\nThe first being of this series was *Adin\u0101tha*, and the last, *Mah\u0101v\u012bra*. Each of them is named a *Jina*, and wonderful legends are told of them which will be briefly noted later on. The Supreme Being is called *Nirguna Paramesvara*, or the Deity without qualities.\n\n*Jiv\u0101tm\u0101* (soul) is variously distinguished. It may be two-fold, *viz.*, locomotive and immovable, as a man or tree; or three-fold, as man, woman, hermaphrodite; or four-fold, namely, forms of men, of vegetable life, of beings of heaven, and those of hell; or five-fold, possessing but one sense, [touch] as the four elements and trees. And these also are of two kinds: (1) such as can be seen, (2) such as are too minute to be perceptible. Each of these (last) five possesses life and has the sense of touch. There are those that possess (at least) two senses, touch and taste, such as shell-fish, leeches &c.; those with three, as the ant which has the additional sense of hearing; those of four, *viz.* flies and wasps which to the above three senses, add that of sight; those of five, mankind. There is a further division of soul into two kinds;\\(^6\\) those possessing an internal sense and such as are without it, as a leaf. The Ny\u0101ya school also hold this opinion. Since the first and the fifth are of two kinds, animal life collectively does not exceed seven, and each may be classed\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) The periodical creations and destructions of the world form part of the Pauranic legends and of the Jaina creed. The heavens and earth in general, are supposed to be eternal, but this portion of the earth, Arya or Bharata, is liable to destruction and renovation.\n\n\\(^6\\) More correctly, the division of souls is into 'mundane' and 'released'. The \"mundane\" pass from birth to birth and are divided into two, those possessing an internal sense (*samanaska*) and those destitute of it (*amanaska*). The former possess *samjn\u0101*, the power of apprehension, talking, acting or receiving instruction, and the latter are without this power. These last are again divided into the locomotive and immovable. Those that possess only the one sense of touch are considered as 'released', as incapable of passing into any other state of existence. (Jacobi, *Jaina Sutras*, 5n.)\nunder two heads: (1) Praj\u0101-pati possessor of six powers, namely, of bodily form, of reception of food, of organs of sense, of the powers of speech, of breathing, and the internal sense (manas); (2) Apraj\u0101pati, life which is incapable of these functions. All that possess but one sense, have four faculties, viz., capability of nourishment, assuming form, command of the organs of sense, inspiration and expiration of breath. All that possess two, three, four or five senses, without the internal sense, have five faculties, viz., the four former and that of speech. Those that possess the internal sense have six faculties.\n\nThey consider the conjunction in the soul of ten qualities, entitles it to be called living, otherwise it is dead; they are severally called pr\u0101na, viz., the five senses, the internal sense, faculty of speech, reception of form, inspiration of breath, duration of life. Those that possess five senses are of four classes. (1) Devat\u0101 (celestial spirit); (2) Manusha (man); (3) N\u0101raki (inhabitant of the infernal regions); (4) Tiryagyoni (animal creation). The Devat\u0101 is formed of a subtile luminous substance by the volition of the Deity, without the process of birth. Their bodies are not of flesh and bone, nor defiled by impurities, and their breathings are redolent of fragrance. They suffer not from maladies, nor does age steal away the freshness of youth. [100] Whatever they desire is fulfilled; they can assume a thousand shapes, and they move at four fingers' breadth above the surface of the earth. They are of four classes:\n\n1. Bhavana-pati. The Jainas believe the earth to consist of seven tiers superimposed one above the other. The earth inhabited by mankind includes a space of 180,000 yojanas. The intervening region between one thousand yojanas and as many below, is the location of the Bhavana-\n\n---\n\n1 These ten are the progeny of Asuras, Serpents, Garuda, Dikp\u0101las, Fire, Air, the Ocean, Thunder and Lightning, who are\npatis. They are of ten orders, each governed by two rulers, one for the northern, the other for the southern region. The colour, appearance, raiment, food and modes of life of each are separate. Their duration of life extends between a minimum of ten thousand and a maximum of an ocean (sagara) of years, and this is considered the lowest order of all.\n\n2. Vyantara. These inhabit a region extending between a thousand yojanas above and a hundred below, and they pass likewise into the sphere allotted to men. They are of sixteen orders, each governed by two rulers. Their age extends from ten thousand years to one palyopama.\n\n3. Jyotishka. Their location is seven hundred and ninety yojanas above the level of the earth, and one hundred and ten yojanas is its eastern limit. They consist of five orders (of luminaries), the first are stars; the second, suns throned at a distance of ten yojanas above the stars; the third are moons, eighty yojanas higher than the suns; the fourth, constellations of twenty-eight mansions; the fifth, planets at an altitude of four yojanas above the mansions, eighty-eight in number. Of these the five most important are Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn with an interval of three yojanas in altitude between them severally. The duration of life of each of the five, ranges between the eighth part of a palya at the lowest, to one palya and a hundred thousand years as an extreme limit.\n\nsupposed to reside in the several hells or regions below the earth. The Vyantaras have eight orders. These are the Pisachas, Bhutas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas and other monstrous divinities inhabiting woods, and the lower regions and air. The third has five orders, the Sun, Moon, Planets, Asterisms and other heavenly bodies. The fourth includes the gods of present and past Kalpas. Of the first kind are those born in the Heavens Saudharma Isana, Mahendra, Brahm\u0101 Sanatkum\u0101ra, Sukra, &c., to the number of twelve. A great number of Indras are recognised, but Sukra and Isana the regents of the North and South are chief. Above all these rank in dignity as objects of worship the twenty-four Tirthankaras or with those of the past and future periods, seventy-two. Wilson (Essays, I, 320).\n4: *Vaim\u0101nika*. Their abode is the highest of all, and they are of two orders. The first, *kalpupapanna*, (existing age), dwell in the twelve zones of heaven each with a special presiding deity, but four have (only) two regents. These ten principalities possess ten illustrious distinctions, (1) a just prince, (2) a capable minister, (3) a benevolent sage, (4) loyal counsellors, (5) sword bearers, (6) guards, (7) commanders of seven armies of elephants, horses, chariots, bulls, footmen, sword players and musicians, (8) administrators of state, (9) news reporters, and (10) sweepers. This sublime order is said to dwell at a little less than the distance of a *r\u0101ju* in altitude. The second order is *kalp\u0101tita* (past age). They do not occupy themselves with others, but keep aloof from friendship, enmity, governance and subjection, and are engaged only in contemplation of the Deity. Above these again are twelve abodes of rest in nine tiers, one above another, and five others like a face, two above, and one below and one between, making fourteen tiers in all.\n\n[101] They consider the world to be composed of three spheres.\u2079 (1) *Manusha-loka*, nine hundred *yojanas* from the\n\n\u2078 A measure of space through which the gods are able to travel in six months at the rate of 2,05,7152 *Yojanas* of 2,000 *Krosa* each in the twinkling of an eye. Colebrooke, II, 198, but Abul Fazl gives another measure lower down.\n\n\u2079 The world, writes Colebrooke, (*Essays*, II, 198) which according to the Jains is eternal, is figured by them as a spindle resting on half of another, or as three cups of which the lowest is inverted and the uppermost meets at its circumference the middle one. The spindle above is the abode of the gods, and the inferior part of the figure comprehends the infernal regions. The earth which they suppose to be a flat surface, is bounded by a circle of which the diameter is one *r\u0101ju*. The lower spindle comprises seven tiers of inferior earths or hells, at the distance of a *r\u0101ju* from each other and its base is measured by seven *r\u0101jus*.\n\nThe upper spindle is also seven *r\u0101jus* high and its greatest breadth is five *r\u0101jus*. Its summit which is 4,500,000 *yojanas* wide, is the abode of the deified saints; beneath this are five *Vim\u0101nas* or abodes of gods. The earth consists of numerous distinct continents in concentric circles separated by seas forming ways between them of which the first is *Jambu-dwipa* with the mountain *Meru* in the centre.\nlowest extremity of the earth to nine hundred above. This is the sphere of men. The earth is said to be one r\u0101ju in length and the same in breadth, and within 4,500,000 yojanas of this space, mankind dwell. Below this is (2) Patala-loka. Its extent is nine hundred yojanas less than seven r\u0101jus. The second is twice the size of the first, and to each tier is added a r\u0101ju so that the seventh is something less than seven r\u0101jus. (3) Svarga-loka is the celestial region, and is a little less than seven r\u0101jus high. Its inhabitants possess five organs of sense. Among them the Vaim\u0101nikas dwell in twenty-six orders which represent paradise. They attain to these bodies and enjoy happiness through good works. Eight orders of Vaim\u0101nikas dwell within five r\u0101jus, and four in the sixth r\u0101ju. Fourteen orders of the inferior class occupy one r\u0101ju. A r\u0101ju is the distance traversed by an iron ball of three and a half Akbari ser\u2019s weight, thrown downwards and continuing to fall for a period of six months, six days and twelve gharis. It is said that for six karoh [krosa] above the twenty-six orders aforesaid, there is a circular area like crystal. Its length is 4,500,000 yojanas and its breadth the same, with a height of eight yojanas. After traversing a distance of three and five-sixth of a Karoh upwards, the sacred haven of final liberation is reached where men are absorbed in the divinity as light in light.\n\nThe ages of the gods extend from something less than a palyopama to not more than a S\u0101gara. The four classes of deities including two orders of the Vaim\u0101nikas have a stature of seven cubits; the third and fourth are of six cubits; the fifth and sixth, of five; the seventh and eighth, of four; from the ninth to the twelfth, of three; from the thirteenth to the twenty-first of two, and from the twenty-second to the twenty-sixth of one cubit, but all of them possess the power of assuming various shapes. All the deities are said to have the desire of food, but it is not taken by the mouth, as they are satisfied by mere volition. Each of the deities who arrives at the age\nof ten thousand years, requires food every other day, and breathes once during the time in which a healthy man would breathe forty-nine times. Those whose age extends beyond this term to one S\u0101gara, eat once between a minimum and maximum of three and nine days and breathe once between four and eighteen gharis. Those who live beyond the period of a S\u0101gara, eat once after a thousand years, and breathe once in fifteen days. Such as live to a still greater term than this, for each S\u0101gara, allow upwards of a thousand years to elapse before they touch food, and in the same proportion of time, increasing intervals of fifteen days pass before a breath is drawn. They also believe that all the deities including two orders of the fourth class, (the Vaim\u0101nika), have sexual intercourse after the manner of mankind, but pregnancy does not take place: the third and fourth orders by conjunction and the sense of touch; the fifth and sixth by sight, and the seventh and eighth, by hearing; four other orders, by mere effort of imagination, while fourteen orders of the second class are innocent of this intercourse. These are said to attain to this eminence by good works. Extraordinary legends are told of these beings, of which let this little from among much be a sufficiency.\n\nThe mundane (manushya), consists of (souls) of two kinds:\u2014(1) Samjna, possessing the power of apprehension, and (2). Asamjna, without power of apprehension. The latter appear (as animalcula) in the flesh, blood and saliva of men and do not live more than the space of two gharis. The Samjna class is sub-divided into two. The Jainas apportion the earth into two parts, and assign one to each division. In the first, commands and prohibitions are in full force, and happiness and misery are the recompense of good and evil actions. Fifteen considerable portions of the earth are allotted to this division.\n\nThe Jainas believe that during the six aras, the extent of which has been mentioned in a former section, twelve\nChakravartis successively appear. Thirty-two thousand kingdoms are beneath his sway, and thirty-two thousand princes are subject to him. He possesses 8,400,000 elephants and as many horses and chariots. He has likewise fourteen thousand ministers of state, nine hundred and thirty millions of footmen, eighty thousand sages, three hundred thousand cuirassiers, five hundred thousand torch-bearers, thirty millions of musicians, sixty-four thousand wedded wives, one hundred and twenty-eight thousand female slaves, sixteen thousand mines of gems, nineteen thousand mines of gold and twenty-eight thousand of other minerals, sixteen thousand provinces of barbarians (mlechchhas), that is, of races foreign to his institutions, thirty-two thousand capital cities, sixteen thousand royal residencies, three hundred and sixty millions of cooks for the royal table, and three hundred and sixty for his private service. Many other endowments are attributed to him. The first cycle of these began with R\u0101j\u0101 Bharata (Chakravarti), son of Adin\u0101tha. Some of these on account of their good works, are translated to heaven while others go down to hell. They assert that nine other individuals are born, entitled V\u0101sudevas, which is a rank possessing half the powers of a Chakravarti, and they believe that these dignitaries descend into a hell, and that Krishna is among their number. Nine other persons, designated Baladevas, are said to exist who possess half the powers of a V\u0101sudeva. Over all these, the Tirthankara, who will be presently described, is the supreme head. Much has been written regarding the denizens of this sphere.\n\nThere is another extensive region, where its people have garments of the leaves of its trees\\(^{10}\\) and their food is wild fruits or the sweet verdure produced by its soil. They are beautiful of countenance and pleasing in disposition. Their stature varies from one to three karoh, in height. One son or\n\n---\n\n\\(^{10}\\) These are the kalpa-vrikhas or celestial trees, of which Major Mackenzie mentions nine varieties. Their gradual disappearance portends the destruction of the world.\ndaughter is born to them after which they die. They are called *Juglyah*\u00b9\u00b9 and when they grow to adolescence, they marry, and their duration of life extends from one to three *palyopama*.\n\nIt is said that those who have not been charitable in deed, nor practised good works, pass after death among this race, and obtain the recompense thereof and bear no burden of pain.\n\nThe *N\u0101rakis*, like the *devat\u0101s*, can assume various shapes and many of their conditions, but their aspect is terrible and always in dejection and gloom. In the six degrees in which hell is said to be divided, they are agitated in burning torment, and though in agony are ever maleficent and from innate wickedness torture each other.\n\nThe class called *Bhavana-pati* have ingress to three degrees of this sphere and are the ministers of chastisement to these fiends. The stature of the dwellers in the first degree is from three to thirty one cubits and six fingers, and their age between ten thousand years and one *S\u0101gara*. The stature of those in the second degree is double that of the first, and this proportion of increase runs through the remaining degrees: the duration of life in the second degree is from one to three *S\u0101garas*. The age of the denizens of the third degree extends from a minimum of three *S\u0101garas* and attains to a maximum of seven: of the fourth, from seven to ten; of the fifth, to seventeen; of the sixth, to twenty-two; and of the seventh, to thirty-three.\n\n*Tiryagyoni* signifies the rest of the animal creation and is three-fold:\u2014(1) aquatic; (2) terrestrial; (3) aerial. The first named order is five-fold, viz., (1) aquatic animals like the *Susm\u0101r*,\u00b9\u00b2 which resemble men, elephants and horses etc.;\n\n---\n\n\u00b9\u00b9 For Pr\u0101krit, *Jugala*, Sanskrit, *Yugala*, a pair, turned into adjectival form.\n\n\u00b9\u00b2 Derived from the Sanskrit *Sisum\u0101ra* (child-killing), the Gange-tic porpoise: in Persian it commonly means a species of lizard, *Kar\u0101h*, probably some kind of eel.\n(2) fishes of various kinds; (3) the tortoise; (4) the Kar\u0101h, an animal in the shape of a tent-rope, four yards long and more, which twines itself round the legs of elephants and other animals and prevents their getting out of the water; (5) the crocodile.\n\nThe second order is of three kinds: quadrupeds like cattle: those that creep on their bellies, as snakes: and such as can move upon two feet like the weasel.\n\nThe third order is of four kinds: two domesticated with man, viz., whose pinions are of feathers, like the pigeon, or of skin, like the bat; and two others that fly in the blissful abodes of the gods, each of which is described with its peculiar characteristics, and many circumstances are related of them. The duration of life in the first class is from two gharis to one purva which is equal to seventy krors of lakhs and fifty-six thousand krors of years. (70,560,000,000,000). The second and third classes in their minimum are like the first, but the second does not extend beyond three palyopama, while the third has no determinate limit. They assert that the duration of age among such as have but one sense, if formed of the subtile elements, is two gharis, and the gross body of the earth does not endure above twenty-two thousand years, nor that of water, above seven thousand; nor of fire, above three days, nor of wind, above three thousand years. Such as have two organs of sense live twelve years; such as possess three organs, forty-nine days, and four organs, six months. The animal creation possessing five organs of sense together with mankind have a life of three palyopama, while the N\u0101rakis and devat\u0101s live thirty-three S\u0101garas but not beyond this term.\n\nIn the interchange of embodiment of these four classes, they allow twenty-four habitations to the soul which enters into air, fire, water, earth, the vegetable creation of two, three and four organs of sense, quadrupeds born of the womb, the ten classes of the infernal regions, the Bhavanapati,\nVyantara, Jyotishka, Vaim\u0101nika, men and devat\u0101s. After death, [104] it enters into one of the following five, viz., mankind, the animal creation with five organs of sense, water, earth, and vegetable forms. The souls of men may come and go through twenty-two forms and when they pass into air or fire, no more assume human shape. Hell-bodies may assume two forms, those of men or of animals with five senses born of the womb, and their lives like those of the Juglyah class are not of any considerable length, nor do they ever enter paradise. Those of the seventh degree of hell, do not even enter human bodies, but each of the (other) three kinds of animals having five organs of sense, have entry and exit through all the twenty-four habitations.\n\nThe arithmeticians of this sect apply the term laksha to one hundred thousand, which the vulgar pronounce lakh. Ten lakhs make a prayuta, and ten prayutas are termed a koti, called generally a kror. One hundred krors make an arba (Sansk. arbuda), and ten arba or kharba, and ten kharbas a nikharba, ten nikharbas, a mah\u0101-saroja, called also padma. Ten padmas make a S\u2019ankha, ten S\u2019ankha, a Samudra, called also Kor\u0101kor.\n\nThey state that if of a seven day\u2019s child of the Juglyah age, the hair, being four thousand and ninety-six times as thick as the hair of the Delhi people, be taken and cut up till further sub-division be impracticable, and a well, four karoh in length, breadth and depth, be filled with such particles, and a single one of the aforesaid particles be taken out of the well at the expiry of each hundred years till the well be emptied, this period would constitute a palyopama. The lapse of ten Samudra of a palyopama constitutes a S\u0101gara.\n\nHaving now discussed the first of the (six) objects classed under Prameya, I briefly mention the other five. The second,\n\n---\n\n13 Lake-born; an epithet of the lotus which in Sanskrit is also called padma.\nAk\u0101sa, ether, is a subtile substance, eternal and all pervading, possessing neither intelligence nor soul. The third, k\u0101la, time, is a substance like the preceding, but not all-pervading. It circumscribes the terrestrial abode of man. The fourth Pudgala\\(^{14}\\)(matter or substance), is four-fold. If not divisible (atomic), nor compounded with another body, it is called pram\u0101na, and if in conjunction, pradesa. When, several pradesas unite, they are called desa, and the conjunction of several desas is termed skandha.\\(^{15}\\) The first is accounted eternal and has five qualities, colour, odour, phlegm, and two out of eight opposite states of gravity or tenuity, rigidity or softness, heat or coldness, greediness or its contrary. [105] The fifth is Dharm\u0101stik\u0101ya, (the predicament virtue). It is a substance by the instrumentality of which, the rational soul and mind (manas), and matter (pudgala), are capable of movement, as a fish by means of water. The sixth is Adharm\u0101stik\u0101ya (the predicament vice). This is a substance, quiescent, and favourable to repose. In some works there is mention of nine first principles called tattvas, viz., (1), Jiva,\\(^{16}\\) soul; (2), Ajiva, the contrary to this, as ether, time, &c.; (3), Punya; (4), P\u0101pa. By the conjunction of a multiplicity of matter and soul-forms, joy and sorrow, ease and pain are produced and this conjunction is termed karman (works), and is also distinguished as prakriti. All that is productive of virtue is\n\n\\(^{14}\\) Compounds sometimes arise from separation and conjunction combined and hence are called pudgalas, because they \"fill\" (par) and \"dissolve\" (gal). Sarva Darsana Sangr., p. 52. Weber translates it Atom-Stoff. Fragment der. Bhag., p. 236.\n\n\\(^{15}\\) This word signifies the elements of being or the forms of mundane consciousness of which there are five in the Buddhist philosophy. Pradesa, one of the forms of the soul's bondage, is the entrance into the different parts of the soul by the masses, made up of an endless number of parts, of the various bodies developed by the consequences of action. S. Darsana, p. 56.\n\n\\(^{16}\\) Lebens-geist. Weber. There are three descriptions of this: the perfect soul of the deified saints; the liberated soul; and the soul in bondage. Ajiva comprehends the four elements and all that is fixed, as mountains, or moveable, as rivers, and is synonymous with Pudgala.\ncalled *punya*, and *p\u0101pa* is vice. *Karman* is eight-fold:\u2014\n\n(1). *Jn\u0101na-varaniya* (shrouding of knowledge), forms of matter that by their conjunction veil each of the five kinds of knowledge that have been noticed. (2). *Darsana-varaniya* (shrouding of study), shrouds apprehension by the five organs of sense. (3). *Vedaniya* (individual consciousness), conjunction of matter by means of which the soul is affected by joy or sorrow. (4). *Mohaniya*, (producing delusion), conjunction of atoms which causes good to be mistaken for evil and the reverse. (5). *Ayus* (age), conjunction of atoms on which depends the continuance of animal life. (6), *N\u0101man*, (name), conjunction of things which is the creative complement of genus, species and individual existence. (7). *Gotra* (race), the conjunction of atoms by which the soul assumes the forms of eminent and ignoble persons. (8). *Antar\u0101ya* (interference), conjunction of atoms by which men abstain from works, are unable to take nourishment, have no inclination for sexual intercourse, take no profit in trade nor practise liberality or mortification.\n\nV. *Asrava*\u00b9\u2077 (flow, movement), evil actions of five kinds, viz. bodily injury, falsehood, theft, incontinence, unbridled desire.\n\nVI. *Samvara* (stopping), is abstention from the above five actions.\n\nVII. *Bandha* (bondage), is the union of matter with soul.\n\nVIII. *Nirjar\u0101* is the gradual disruption of conjoined atoms by the mortification of the body.\u00b9\u2078\n\n\u00b9\u2077 This means the movement or natural impulse of the soul to act, called *Yoga*. As a door opening into the water is called *Asrava*, because it causes the stream to descend, so by this impulse, the consequences of acts flow in upon the soul. It is the association of the body with right or wrong deeds and comprises all the *karmans*. All these eight classes of acts are mentioned in the Bhagavati. v. Weber's *Fragment der Bhagavati*, p. 166, II.\n\n\u00b9\u2078 *Nirjar\u0101* is that which entirely (*nir*), wears and antiquates (*jarayati*), all sin previously incurred and the whole effect of works.\nIX. Moksha, called also mukti, is the total disseverance of atoms, which cannot be attained without knowledge and works. As when a fire takes place in the dwelling of a lame and a blind man, neither of them [106] alone can escape, but the blind man may take the lame on his back, and by the vision of the one and the movement of the other they both may reach a place of safety.\n\nIt is said that without concurrence of three conditions, this great end cannot be secured: (1). knowledge of the Supreme Being; (2). the acquisition of a guide who makes no distinction between praise and blame, wounding and healing; (3). constancy in good works. These three take rise in obedience and service, by which knowledge is gained. This latter is the chief source of a passionless state (vir\u0101ga) which annihilates the impulse (\u0101svara) of the embodied spirit, whence proceeds the closing (samvara) of the passage to such impulses, and this again incites men to austerity whereby they are occupied in the mortification of the spirit and the body. This mortification is of twelve kinds:\u2014(1). not to eat at particular times. Formerly abstinence from solid food for a whole year was practised, and by some for nine months, but in these days six months is the longest duration; (2). to eat sparingly, and to beg for food from not more than five houses, and to fast till the next day if none be forthcoming, and to abstain from five things: viz., milk, curds, butter, oil of sesame and sweets; (3). mortification of the body in enduring the sun\u2019s heat; (4). to take rest on hot sand; (5). to endure nakedness in cold; (6). to draw up the arms and legs and sit on the haunches. They say that it requires a long time before these six practices can be successfully accomplished, and many fail in their performance.\n\nIt consists chiefly in mortification. Bondage is that which binds the embodied spirit by association of the soul with deeds. Moksha is its deliverance from the fetters of works, v. Colebrooke I, p. 407.\nRegarding the expiation of sins, strange penances are prescribed for each transgression, such as, obedience to the religious director; service of ascetics; reading of voluminous books; bowing the head in meditation. This latter must not be for less than two gharis, and some among former devotees continued it for twelve years: to stand with the arms hanging down, and to refrain from movement. These six exercises quickly lead to perfection.\n\nThere are forty-five great texts among this sect, of which twelve are termed Angas, considered to be sacred books. (1). Ach\u0101r\u0101\u1e45ga, rule of conduct for ascetics. (2) Sutrakrit-\u0101\u1e45ga, containing three hundred and sixty precepts of devotees and demonstrations of each. (3). Sth\u0101n\u0101\u1e45ga, in which from one to ten (acts) essential to purity are enumerated, beginning with one, applicable to the upper and lower worlds, and so throughout the series to ten. (4). Samav\u0101y\u0101\u1e45ga; herein from ten to ten millions are enumerated and divers other truth. (5). Bhagavaty\u0101\u1e45ga; this contains thirty-six thousand questions put by Gautama to Mah\u0101deva\\(^{19}\\) and the answers thereto. (6). Jnat\u0101dharmakath\u0101, containing thirty-five million ancient legends. [P. 107] (7). Up\u0101sak\u0101das\u0101, an account of ten devotees of Mahadeva. (8). Antakriddas\u0101, on those who have attained the eternal beatitude of liberation. (9) Anuttaropap\u0101ti-kadas\u0101\u1e45ga, on the blessed who for their good works have passed into the twenty-sixth degree of paradise. (10). Prasnavy\u0101karan\u0101\u1e45ga, mentions various works, the source of good and evil acts. (11). Vip\u0101kasrut\u0101\u1e45ga, former consequences of actions, which having borne the recompense of good and evil are forever laid to rest. (12): Chaudah-purv\u0101\u1e45ga (anga of fourteen Purvas), containing questions that concern mankind generally, with various reflections and classes of acts.\n\nThe twenty-four T\u012brthankaras having in these deliverances revealed the will of the Supreme Being, their successors\n\n\\(^{19}\\) An error for Mah\u0101v\u012bra.\ncollected them and reduced them to writing. Twelve of them are termed *Up\u0101ngas*, in which the purport of the former books has been concisely recorded with some additional matter. Four books are called *Mula-Sutras*, in which are given the usages of religious preceptors, the mode of begging, manner of life, mortification, worship of God and rules of composition. Six works are termed *Chedda-grantha*, on expiation of sin. Ten others are called *P\u0101inna*, explanation of the anatomy of the limbs, the manner of birth in animals, and all that takes place at the dissolution of elementary connection, and other subjects. Another work designated *Nandi-Sutra*, treats of the five kinds of knowledge, which have been already mentioned.\n\nThe devotees of this sect are called *Yatis*. *Sishya* (disciple), is an inquirer who enters on this path. *Ganesa-sishya* is an ascetic who for six months at a stretch restrains the inordinate spirit within the prison of freedom from desire.\n\n---\n\n20 The Sanskrit for this Pr\u0101krit word is *Prakirna*, and signifies a collection of miscellaneous rules.\n\nWeber in his *Sacred literature of the Jains* says that the third group of texts of the Siddh\u0101nta is formed by the ten *p\u0101innas*, a name which denoting \"scattered, hastily sketched\" pieces, well suits their real nature as a group of texts corresponding to the Vedic *parisishtas*. It is as yet undetermined how old is their position as the third part of the Siddh\u0101nta and what caused their location there. They are with few exceptions in metre and a considerable portion of them refers to the proper sort of euthanasy, the confession required for this end and the abjuration of everything evil. Physiology, mythology and astrology and hymns are also treated. (*I. A.* Part CCLIX, April 1892). Weber is unable to make out the significance of the title *Mula-Sutra*, of which there are four. The text is composed in metre and principally *slokas*. The entire Siddh\u0101nta according to Weber, at present embraces 45 texts divided into six groups. (1) eleven or twelve Angas. (2) twelve Up\u0101ngas. (3) ten Painnas. (4) six Cheddasutras. (5) two Sutras without a common name, Nandi and Anuyogadv\u0101ram. (6) four Mula-Sutras.\n\nThe names of all these will be found in *I. A.* Part CCXIII, October, 1888.\n\n21 From *Gana-isa* lord of troops; *Gana* with the Jains signifies a school or a school derived from one teacher, and *Ganadhara*, the head thereof.\nIf he eats one day, he fasts two, and defiles not his hand with milk, curds, butter, oil, nor sweets. He eats only of a little parched wheat thrown into hot water, and begs for alms only from one house; his nights are spent till morn in prayers, and five hundred times during each night he prostrates himself in worship, and in the day reads the book of Bhagavati. [P. 108]\n\nThe Pravartaka (founder), has much the same character, but on account of his zeal and experience is nominated by the chief religious authority of the time over the pilgrims in this desolate wilderness, to superintend their daily actions and appoint suitable penance for such as are idolent and inclined to ease. The Sth\u0101vira (elder), is an assistant to the preceding who controls the refractory and aids the languishing. The Ratn\u0101dhika, or Paniy\u0101sa as he is also called, is zealous in the service of God wherever duty calls and thither speeds to remedy disorder: he also prepares the place for the Ach\u0101rya or spiritual teacher, and has the care of his garments and the settlement of disputes among the ascetics is committed to him. The Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya (sub-teacher), has nearly the same rank as an Ach\u0101rya, and the disciples verify under his direction the words of the sacred texts and the questions thereto appertaining. These teachers possess nothing of their own but the garments which will be particularised later. The Ach\u0101rya is a personage of a genial disposition, reverent of aspect, pleasant of speech, grave, learned and benevolent. He must be acquainted with the proofs of the doctrines of his sect, and learned in the precepts of the other eight schools and skilled to refute them, and no treatise\n\n---\n\n22 This work is mentioned by Wilson (I. 281. Essays 1862, Rost) as one of the eleven primary works of the Jainas, an instruction in the various sources of wordly pain, or in the paths of virtue, and consists of lessons given to Gautama by Mah\u0101v\u012bra and is in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, in 36,000 stanzas. It consists of a series of questions by Im\u0101dabhuti, Roha, and other disciples of Mah\u0101v\u012bra to that sage, and his answers, relating to a variety of topics.\nshould be unknown to him. The burden of the care of his flock lies upon his shoulders, and to promote the welfare of his institute must be his chief aim. Garments and books that are in excess of ordinary requirements are in his keeping for supply at need to inquirers of this road. The Ganadhara by fullness of knowledge and good works arrives at an exalted degree of wisdom, and possesses the eight miraculous endowments mentioned in the P\u0101tanjala system. He is the representative of the Jina. The Jina who is also called Tirthankara (creating a passage through the circuit of life), surpasses this dignity and attains omniscience, is beautiful of countenance, and perfect in the moral order. His breath is redolent with fragrance and his words full of wisdom. His flesh and blood are white, and none has ever seen him eat or defecate. Neither sickness nor sweat nor dirt contaminate his holy person. His nails and hair grow not long. His words fall so harmoniously that every listener might deem that his speech was music. In whatsoever land he resides, snakes, scorpions and other venomous reptiles disappear, neither excess nor deficiency in rainfall occurs, and war, pestilence and drought cease. When he moves abroad, the trees are voiceful in praise, and many ministering spirits attend to guard him. It is said that his beautiful soul is imprisoned in the ventricular cavity of his form by a special connection, and in contradistinction to men in general, he is illumined by three kinds of apprehension, obtains cognition through the organs of sense and mind (manas) and the purport of all books is laid open to him. He discerns all that has form whether far or near, and after being born, and through the discipline of austerities, he becomes cognisant of the secret thoughts of men and arrives at the sublime degree of omniscience. These qualities belong to the whole twenty-four Tirthankaras of whom mention has been made. [P. 109]\n\nThe ascetics of this body have no intercourse with women, and avoid the spot where the sound of her voice is\nheard. They abstain from meat, fruit and sweetmeats. They cook no food in their own dwellings, and at the meal-time of others, they approach a house and there stand and announce themselves by the words, \"dharma labha\" that is, 'he who doeth good, receiveth a reward', and without importunity, take whatever of daily cooked food is brought. They may not take away milk, oil and rice together for food, and without being covetous of the taste thereof must speedily swallow their meal. And they must not knowingly accept food cooked especially for them or for the sake of mendicants in general, nor which has been brought from out of a dark room, nor fetched by mounting from a low to an elevated place, nor for which the lock of a door has been opened nor brought out having been previously purchased. They drink nothing but warm water and do not eat or drink during the night. They never light a lamp nor have a fire in the house in which they dwell. They may not pick up any thing fallen nor wash any member of the body but that which is actually soiled. They must avoid avarice and anger, and abstain from falsehood, from injury to life and from theft, and may have no worldly goods, but only necessary raiment. This, in other than winter time, consists of three robes. One of these is used as a loin cloth, a second thrown over the shoulder like a belt and the third worn over the uncovered head. In winter a special woollen garment is added. They have also a cloth a little more than a span and a half in length and breadth which they keep folded in four. This is placed over the mouth when reading and the two ends are stuffed into the ears so that no\n\n---\n\n23 I translate with diffidence this crabbed and ungrammatical sentence.

They also carry a Dharmadhvaja made of woollen hairs like a tassel, bound with scarlet cloth and fixed in a wooden handle. As they constantly sit on the ground, they first gently sweep it with both hands that nothing may remain beneath. The elders of this sect, who have been briefly mentioned, spread an old woollen cloth by way of carpet, and spend their days profitably in fasting and good works. Every six months they pull out the hairs of their head with their hands and nails, and go barefoot among thorns and stony places, but in the rainy season they do not stir abroad.\n\nThe laity of this sect are called Sravaka. They observe, firstly, the following twelve rules. I. Never to injure the innocent. II. To avoid (the following) five kinds of untruths which are accounted great falsehoods; (1) false testimony, (2) breach of trust, (3) regarding land, (4) in praise and blame of others, (5) concerning a cow. III. Not to stain their hands with dishonesty. IV. Not to look upon the wife of another. V. To be content with a moderate share of worldly goods. VI. To give the surplus in charity. VII. On journeys, to move stated distances. VIII. To determine the daily need of food and other necessaries, and to live accordingly. IX. Not to approach a spot where a sati has taken place or a robber executed. X. To set apart two or three gharis of the twenty-four hours, and with complete detachment of heart to employ these in devotion to the bountiful Creator. XI. At the hour of sleep to resolve on abstention from further food, and effacing the suggestions of desire, to lay down to rest. XII. On the 8th, 14th, 15th, and 1st day of the 1st quarter of the moon, [P. 110] to abstain from food and drink through-\n\n---\n\n26 \"The emblem or ensign of religion\".\n27 The reason of this is, that many living beings are produced and many seeds spring up, the footpaths are not recognisable. (Jacobi), p. 136.\nout the day, and to feed the first beggar (met with) on the morn of the break of fast. The points aforesaid should be gone over every day and at the time of rest, and the conscience be therein examined.\n\nThe claim of rectitude of life in this austere sect is applicable to a man who fulfils the following conditions:\u2014 He should constantly listen to the reading of the sacred texts, perform work of charity, make a practice of praising the virtuous, defile not his tongue in disparagement of another, especially of temporal rulers. He should take in wedlock one who is his equal, and be ever in fear of committing sin. He should conform to the laws of the land wherever he abides, and should so choose his dwelling that it be not public to every passer-by, nor yet so secluded that none can discover it, and it should not have more than two or three doors. He should choose good neighbours and associate only with the virtuous. He should be dutiful to his father and mother, and avoid a city or a province invaded by foreign troops. He must regulate his expenses in accordance with his income, and make his dress conform to the same standard. He must be assiduous in reading the divine books, and avoid an unrestrained spirit in the regulation of his life. He must take his meals at stated times, and observe due measure in his regard for wordly wealth, and the getting thereof and attachment thereunto, and should be zealous in hospitality to a guest, an ascetic, and in the care of the sick. He should not be self-opinionated, nor a lover of his own speech. He must prize learning. He must not journey out of season, nor into a country where he cannot practise his religion, nor enter into a quarrel without discerning his ally from his enemy. He must sympathize with his kindred, and be provident and far-sighted, and recognize the claims of gratitude, and so bear himself in his outward conduct that men may hold him in regard. He must be modest, gentle and courteous in demeanour, and exert himself in the interests of others, and\nsubduing his internal enemies, hold his five senses under the control of reason.\n\nThe prohibitions to be observed by both the ascetics and the laity are, to abstain from flesh-meat, wine, honey, butter, opium, snow, ice, hail, everything that grows beneath the earth, fruits whose names are unknown, or that contain small seeds, and from eating at night.\n\nThe Jaina institutes recognize two orders, the Svetambaras (clad in white) and Digambaras (sky-clad). The latter wear no clothes and go naked. According to the Digambaras, a woman cannot attain final liberation.\\(^{28}\\) They say that when any one arrives at the sublime degree of mukti, he needs no food till he dies. They are at one with the Svetambaras on many points. The writer has met with no one who had personal knowledge of both orders and his account of the Digambaras has been written as it were in the dark, but having some acquaintance with the learned of the Svetambara order, who are also known as Sewra he has been able to supply a tolerably full notice. From ancient times, throughout the extent of Hindustan, the Br\u0101hmans and Jains have been the repositories of knowledge and ceremonial observance, but from short-sightedness have held each other in reproach. The Br\u0101hmans worship Krishna as a deity, while the Jainas relegate him to service in hell. The Br\u0101hmans deem it better to face a raging elephant or a ravening lion than to meet with one of this sect. His Majesty, however, in his earnest search after truth, has partially dispelled the darkness of the age by the light of universal toleration, and the numerous sectaries, relinquishing their mutual aversion, live in the happy accomplishment of a common harmony.\n\n\\(^{28}\\) There is a division between the Digambaras and Svetambaras on this point, the latter conceding the doubtful privilege of final annihilation to women also. The other points of difference may be read in Wilson's Essays, I. p. 340.\nBAUDDHA.\n\nThe founder of this rational system of faith is known as Buddha, and is called by many names. One of these is S\u0101kyamuni, vulgarly pronounced Sh\u0101kmuni. It is their belief that by the efficacy of a life of charity, he attained to the highest summit of wisdom, and becoming omniscient, secured the treasure of final liberation. His father was R\u0101ja Suddhodana, prince of Beh\u0101r, and his mother's name was M\u0101y\u0101. He was born by way of the navel and was surrounded by a brilliant light, and the earth trembled, and a stream of the water of the Ganges showered down upon him. At the same time he took seven steps, uttered some sublime words, and said, \"This will be my last birth.\" The astrologers foretold that on his attaining the age of twenty-nine years and seven days, he would become a mighty ruler, institute a new religion, and accomplish his final liberation. At the very time foretold, he renounced the world and retired into the desert. For a short period he lived at Benares, R\u0101jgir, and other sacred places, and after many wanderings reached Kashmir.\n\nMany of the Hindu race, and from the coasts, and from Kashmir, Tibet and Scythia were converted by him. From the date of his death to the present time, which is the fortieth year of the Divine Era, two thousand nine hundred and sixty-two years have elapsed. He possessed the gift of an efficacious will and the power of performing miracles. He lived one hundred and twenty years. The learned among the Persians and Arabs, name the religious of this order\n\n---\n\n29 For Buddhism, see Hastings, Encyclo. ix. 846-853; Kern, Manual of Indian Buddhism (Grundriss series), and the works of the two Rhys Davids.

[J. S.]\nBhikshus; in Tibet they are styled L\u0101m\u0101s. For a long time past scarce any trace of them has existed in Hindusthan, but they are found in Pegu, Tenasserim and Tibet. The third time that the writer accompanied His Majesty to the delightful valley of Kashmir, he met with a few old men of this persuasion, but saw none among the learned, nor observed anything like what is described by H\u0101fiz Abru and Ban\u0101kati. The Br\u0101hmans regard him as the ninth avat\u0101ra, but do not accept the doctrines commonly ascribed to him, and deny that he is their author.\n\nThey hold the Deity to be undefiled by incarnation, and with the S\u0101nkhya, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, and Jaina systems, do not consider him the author of creation. The world, they deem to be without beginning or end, and the whole universe to be at one moment resolved into nothingness, and at another created again as before. They accept the doctrine of the recompense of good and evil deeds, and of hell and heaven, and knowledge, according to them, is a quality of the rational soul. The ascetics of this religion shave their heads, and wear garments of leather and red cloth. [P. 112]\n\nThey are frequent in their ablutions, and refuse nothing that is given them as food, and hold all that dies of itself as\n\n---\n\n30 In the text Bakhshi. This word occurs in Marco Polo (Yule I, 293) as Bacsi and in a note (p. 305) it is explained to be a corruption of Bhikshu, the proper Sanskrit term for a religious mendicant and in particular for a Buddhist devotee. The word was probably applied, adds the note, to a class only of the Lamas, but among the Turks and Persians became a generic name for them all, and this passage from the Ain is quoted in support. It continues, that according to Pallas the word among the modern Mongols is used in the sense of teacher, and is applied to the oldest and most learned priest of a community, who is the local ecclesiastical chief. Among the Kirghiz Kazz\u0101ks the word survives in Marco Polo's sense of a \"medicine-man\" or conjurer. In Western Turkist\u0101n it has come to mean a bard. From its association with persons who could read and write, it seems to have gradually passed into the sense of a clerk. Under the Mahomedan rule, it was applied to an officer who performed duties analogous to those of Quarter-master General and thence came to mean a paymaster. Ency. Isl. i. 600. [J. S.]\nkilled by the act of God, and therefore lawful. They hold no commerce with women, and kill nothing that has life, and looking on plants as possessing it, they refrain from digging them up or cutting them.\n\nTheir spiritual energies are directed to six objects: the repression of anger, the pursuit of wisdom, soliciting alms, true understanding of the worship of the Supreme Being, fortitude in austerities, perpetual commune with God. Three things are affirmed by them to be the source of goodness: knowledge, disinterestedness, freedom from envy; and twelve seats the source of good and evil, viz., the five senses, their faculties, the common sensory, and intellect. These twelve, they term Ayatana (seats).\n\nThere are four objects of thought which in place of pad\u0101rtha (categories), they call (chaturvidha) Arya-satya, four sublime truths. The first is Duhkh\u0101-satya reality of misery, which is of five kinds. (1). Vijn\u0101na, (sensation). (2) Vedan\u0101, consciousness, the recompense of good or evil. (3). Sanj\u00f1\u0101, name or denomination of things. (4). Sansk\u0101ra, (impression), aggregate of merit and demerit. Some assert that since all things are in a state of momentary flux and reflux of existence, the intellectual consciousness thereof is designated by this term. (5) Rupa (form) comprehends the five elements, and their evolutes, and because all these five produce bodily sufferance, they are distinguished under this head.\n\nThe second, Samudaya-Satya (progressive accumulation of evil), is all that arises from desire and anger, and which under its influence says, 'I am,' or, 'that is mine.'\n\nThe third is M\u0101rga-satya (reality of means), the habit of thought that the world is in momentary annihilation and\n\n---\n\n*So in the Sarva Darsana Sangraha, \"After acquiring wealth in abundance, the twelve inner seats are to be thoroughly reverenced: what use of reverencing aught else below.\" The five organs of knowledge, the five organs of action, the common sensory, and the intellect have been described by the wise as the twelve inner seats.\"*\nreproduction. The fourth is *Nirodha-satya* (reality of annihilation) which they call *Mukti* or final liberation. Ten conditions are necessary to attain this degree: (I). Charity. (II). Abstention from evil and practising virtue, that is, to refrain from the following ten actions, *viz.*, taking life, molesting, taking that which is not given, incontinence, falsehood, speaking ill of the good, irascibility, idle speech, evil intention, intercourse prohibited by religious precept. Seven duties are to be fulfilled. Respect for religious guide and spiritual director; veneration of idols; observing the service of others; praise of the good; influencing to good works by gentle speech; perseverance through success or failure in sustaining others in virtue; learning the duties of worship. (III). To be neither elated nor depressed by praise or blame. (IV). To sit in a particular posture. (V). To introduce an idol into a temple which they call *chaitya*. (VI). To regard the things of the world [P. 113] as they really are. (VII). To be zealous in the seven practices of *Yoga* prescribed in the P\u0101tanjala system. (VIII). To acquire the habit of five duties, *viz.*, a true and firm acceptance of the commands of the religious director; to be mindful of them and to carry them out; to reduce the body and spirit by rigid austerities; to efface from the heart all external impression; to keep the mind fixed only on the Supreme Being. (IX). To strengthen the bonds of knowledge so that they cannot be broken. (X). To enter upon the knowledge by which final liberation is accomplished. *Pram\u0101na*, proof, with this sect, consists of *pratyaksha* (perception), and *\u0101tman* (self), and there are two causes of knowledge, evidence of the senses, and demonstration. The first is four-fold, *viz.*, apprehension by the five\n\n---\n\n32 The Buddhas do not recognize soul (*j\u012bva* or *\u0101tman*) distinct from intelligence (*chitta*). This latter dwelling within the body and possessing individual consciousness, apprehends objects and subsists as self. In that view only is *\u0101tman*, self or soul. Colebrooke, I. 47.

S.]\nsenses, or perception by the common sensory or apprehension of the knowledge of the things themselves, or when by reason of the mortification of the senses, the non-apparent and the visible become identical.\n\nIn regard to inference and the exposition of the external percipibile their argumentation is lengthy and extremely subtle.\n\nThe Buddhas are divided into four sects.\n\n1. The Vaibh\u0101shikas, like the Ny\u0101ya school, believe in separate indivisible atoms for each of the four elements but perceptible by the eye; and with them existence is predicable of two entities, cognition and its objects, the latter being apprehended by the senses.\n\n2. The Sautr\u0101ntikas affirm that objects are cognised by inference.\n\n3. Yog\u0101ch\u0101ras admit only intellect which produces the forms of objects.\n\nThe M\u0101dhyamikas hold both cognition and objects to be void (sunya, Hindi sun) and confounded existence and non-existence.\n\nMany treatises have been written on each of these divisions and there is considerable variance of opinion on questions of objective and subjective existence. Three sciences are regarded by them as important; the science of proof; the science of administration; the science of the interior life.\n\nNASTIKA.33\n\nCh\u0101rv\u0101ka, after whom this school is named, was an unenlightened Br\u0101hman. Its followers are called by the Br\u0101hmans, N\u0101stikas or Nihilists. They recognise no existence apart from the four elements, nor any source of perception save through the five organs of sense. They do not believe\n\n---\n\n33 For the N\u0101stika philosophy, Hastings, Encyclo. viii. 493-494. The term N\u0101stika signifies one who disowns the existence of a future life.

Paradise, they regard as a state in which man lives as he chooses, free from the control of another, and hell the state in which he lives subject to another's rule. The whole end of man, they say, is comprised in four things: the amassing of wealth, [P. 114] women, fame and good deeds. They admit only of such sciences as tend to the promotion of external order, that is, a knowledge of just administration and benevolent government. They are somewhat analogous to the sophists in their views and have written many works in reproach of others, which rather serve as lasting memorials of their own ignorance.\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE EIGHTEEN SCIENCES.\n\n(Ath\u0101ra Vidy\u0101).\n\nHaving taken a brief survey of the nine schools of philosophy existing in this country, I proceed to state some of the points on which the Br\u0101hmans of the first six systems are agreed and thus brighten the interest of this exposition.\n\nThey say that he has attained the summit of knowledge who has garnered his stores of wisdom from this number of sciences and by fathoming their depths, satisfied the desire of his heart.\n\nThe first division consists of the Rig Veda; the second is the Yajur Veda; the third is the S\u0101ma Veda; and the fourth, the Atharvan.\n\nThese four are considered to be divine books, as already mentioned. Each of them treats of four matters:\u2014(1). Vidhi, precept and its cogency; (2). Arthav\u0101da, praise and its recompense; (3). Mantra, invocation and prayer which are profitable in particular cases; (4). N\u0101madheya, appellation of important acts. Each of them also treats of three things:\u2014(1). Karma, exterior works; (2). Up\u0101sana, religious meditation; (3). Jn\u0101na, perfected knowledge.\n\nThe fifth, the Pur\u0101nas. Eighteen distinct works are styled by this name. They explain in a clear manner the difficulties occurring in the four Vedas above mentioned, and each of them treats of the following five subjects:\u2014(1). The creation of the world. (2).

They likewise mention the fourteen Indras associated with them, (for they say that [P. 115] during Brahm\u0101\u2019s life, fourteen deities will successively rule the celestial regions), and the actions by means of which they attain to this dignity.

These recollections have come down by unbroken tradition, and are known under the title of Dharma-S\u0101stra, the institutes of law, civil and religious.

At each of these times special prayers and important ceremonies are required.\n\nThe ninth is Vy\u0101karana, the science of grammar and linguistic analysis, upon which are based the rules for the composition of letters. Firstly, they reckon fifty-two letters under three kinds. Fourteen are vowels (Svara) which are both letters and diacritical accents, and can be pronounced without extraneous adjunct: These are, a (\u0905) : \u0101 (\u0906) : [118] i (\u0907) : i (\u0908) : u (\u0909) : u (\u090a) : ri (\u090b) : ri (\u0960) : li (\u090c) : li (\u0961) : (diphthongs) e (\u090f) : ai (\u0910) : o (\u0913) : au (\u0914). Thirty-three letters are called Vyanjana, consonants which cannot be sounded without a vowel. These are k (\u0915) : kh (\u0916) : g (\u0917) : gh (\u0918) : n (\u0919) which is a letter having a nasal sound produced by the throat and nose, ch (\u091a) : chh (\u091b) : j (\u091c) : jh (\u091d) : n (\u091e) : t (\u091f) : th (\u0920) : d (\u0921) : dh (\u0922) : n (\u0923) : t (\u0924) : th (\u0925) : d (\u0926) : dh (\u0927) : n (\u0928) : p (\u092a) : ph (\u092b) : b (\u092c) : bh (\u092d) : m (\u092e) : y (\u092f) : r (\u0930) : l (\u0932) : v (\u0935) : s (\u0938) : sh (\u0936) : s (\u0937) : h (\u0939) :\n\nThere are five other letters, one of which is called\n\nture, p. 113, ff. The first are considered requisite for reading the Veda, the two next for understanding it, and the last two for employing it at sacrifices. Siksha is derived from sak to be able and means a desire to know. The doctrine of the Siksha was embodied in the Aranyakas, and perhaps the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Kalpa or Ceremonial is the fifth and most complete Ved\u0101\u1e45ga. The ceremonies mentioned by Abul Fazl, are described in the Grihya-Sutras and are briefly alluded to by M\u00fcller, p. 264.\n\n*The third Vedanga is Vy\u0101karana or Grammar, represented by the grammarians ending with P\u0101nini, whose work however, superseded those of his predecessors to such an extent that little but their names and a few rules under their authority have come down to us, V. Hist. Sansk. Lit.*\nAnusv\u0101ra, sounded like kan with a quiescent nasal. Another is visarga (a surd breathing), like the final h in kah. A third is called jihv\u0101muliya, a letter between an h and a kh, and occurs as a medial and is sounded from the root of the tongue. The fourth is called gaja-kumbha kriti, a quiescent medial letter approximating in sound to a bh\u0101. The fifth is ardha-bindu, a quiescent nasal, like a suppressed nun (\u03c5).\n\nSuch is the exposition of the Sanskrit alphabet as far as I have been able to transcribe it. Some points which it has been beyond my power adequately to explain I have but alluded to. The last five letters are employed with vowels and consonants alike, and each consonant is capable of being vocalized with the fourteen vowels. At the present day the fourteen vowels (sv\u0101ra) are called m\u0101tra and two being commonly omitted, eight only are employed. Each written letter is separate and unconnected with the next. Letters are of four kinds. If without a [P. 119] moveable vowel a letter is called (vy\u0101njana). If it be a simple short vowel or if it add one m\u0101tra to a quiescent long vowel, it is called hrasva. Twice the prosodial time of a short vowel is called dirgha, and if longer than two (i.e. three m\u0101tras) it is called pluta or prolated.\n\nEight modes of utterance are reckoned, viz., from the middle of the chest: the throat: the root of the tongue: between the teeth: the nose: the palate: the lip: and the crown of the head. There is considerable diversity of opinion in all that they discuss but I have chosen the most generally accepted view. Before the writer had gained any acquaintance with this language, he considered the grammatical structure of Arabic to be without a rival, but he is now more fully\n\n---\n\n7 Properly the prosodial time of a short vowel.\n8 These are the long i and the long l: the latter does not occur in a single genuine word in the language, and is added, says Whitney, for the sake of an artificial symmetry.\naware of the immense labours of Hindu philologists, and the powerful regulative influence of their system.\n\nThe tenth science is Nirukta, (etymology), a detailed commentary of Vedic texts.\\(^9\\)\n\nThe eleventh Jyotisha\\(^{10}\\) is on astronomy and its wonders.\n\nThe twelfth Chandas is on metre and the classes of verse.\n\nThe last six are called Angas, that is to say that a knowledge of these six is necessary to the comprehension of the Vedas.\n\nThe thirteenth is the Mimamsa of which the three kinds have been already mentioned.\n\nThe fourteenth is the Nyaya which has been summarily treated among the sciences.\n\nThe fifteenth is the Ayur-veda, the science of anatomy, hygiene, nosology and therapeutics. It is taken from the first Veda.\\(^{11}\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^9\\) This is the fourth Vedanga as represented by the Nirukta of Yaska and applies to Vedic etymologies exclusively. It is important to distinguish his Nirukta, the text of which is usually called Nighantu, from his commentary of the Nirukta to which the term Nirukta alone is often applied. The Nirukta consists of three parts; the Naighantuka, the Naigama, and the Daivata, in five chapters, containing lists of synonyms, words and Divinities. Max Muller points out that the Greeks and Hindus alone of all nations have had independent conceptions of the sciences of Logic and Grammar, but they started from opposite points. The Greeks began with philosophy and endeavoured to adjust its terminology to the facts of language. The Hindus began with etymology and their generalisations never went beyond arrangements of grammatical forms, partly due to the sacred character of the Vedic hymns, wherein a mispronunciation might mar their religions effect. Thus the grammar of the latter has ended in a colossal pedantry, while that of the Greeks still influences modern culture throughout the civilised world. Hist. Sansk.

It is of four kinds.\n\nThe First Kind discloses the particular action which has brought a man into existence in one of the five classes into which mankind is divided, and the action which occasions the assumption of a male or female form. A Kshatriya who lives continently, will, in his next birth, be born a Br\u0101hman. A Vaisya who hazards his transient life to protect a Br\u0101hman, will become a Kshatriya. A Sudra who lends money without interest and does not defile his tongue by demanding repayment, will be born a Vaisya. A Mlechchha who serves a Br\u0101hman and eats food from his house till his death, will become a Sudra. A Br\u0101hman who undertakes the profession of a Kshatriya will become a Kshatriya, and thus a Kshatriya will become a Vaisya, and a Vaisya a Sudra, and a Sudra a Mlechchha. Whosoever accepts in alms a Krishn\u0101jina or skin of the black antelope, or the bed on which a man has died, or a buffalo, or receives an alms in the shrine of Kurukshetra, will, in the next birth, from a man become a woman. Any woman or Mlechchha, who in the temple of Badari-N\u0101r\u0101yana sees the form of N\u0101r\u0101yana, and worships him with certain incantations, will in the next birth, if a woman, become a man, and if a Mlechchha, a Br\u0101hman. This shrine is in the hills north of Hardw\u0101r. They say that for any one who has not an accurately defined caste, the horoscope of the result of any particular action is taken, and the place of Mars is observed. Whatever may be its position, the dominus domus shows the caste of the inquirer, and the dominant of the seventh house of Mars shows the caste of the inquirer in his former birth. If Venus and Jupiter, his caste is Br\u0101hman; if the sun and Mars, a Kshatriya; if the\n\n---\n\n15 Commonly Badrin\u0101th, a peak of the Himalayan range in Garhwal Dist. N. W.

I refer the curious reader to the tabular representations of the different planets, their aspects, influences, houses and indications, together with the tables of the Zodiacial signs and their dominants which are there given.}\n\nThe Second Kind shows the strange effects of actions on health of body and in the production of manifold diseases. Physicians attribute these to constitution, but this science to the results of former conduct. Hindu philosophers class diseases under three heads:\u2014(1). Those that can be cured by medicinal treatment; (2). Those that are removable by observing the following courses of procedure; (3). Those that require the application of both. To diagnose each of these, certain symptoms are recognised which are classed under three states, viz., (1). actions deliberately committed in a state of wakefulness; (2). such as are unconsciously done [121] in that condition;\\footnote{\"By what is a man impelled, O Varshneya!\" says Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, \"when he commits sin even against his will, as if compelled by force?\" \"It is lust;\" replies Krishna \"it is wrath born from the 'passion' mode: know, that this all-devouring, all-defiling is here our foe. Knowledge is enveloped by this which is the eternal foe of the wise man . . . and is an insatiable flame.\" Davies' Translation.} (3). and those that are effected during sleep. In the first, the sickness is incapable of remedy; in the second a remedy can be applied; in the third case, medicinal treatment to some extent restores health, but there is liability to relapse. Disorders of the heart, they consider, as originating in intention, and those of the body from inadvertency and error. Volumes have been written on this subject and the advice of physicians disregarded as unprofitable. Some of these causes of sickness are here set down for purposes of illustration.\n\nHeadache is caused by former violent language used to father or mother. The remedy is to make the images of\nKasyapa\\textsuperscript{18} and Aditi of two tolahs of gold and give them to the poor. The first of these two is regarded as the father of the Devat\u0101s, and the latter as the mother.\n\nMadness is the punishment of disobedience to father and mother. The cure is to perform the Ch\u0101ndr\u0101yana, which is to eat one mouthful on the first day, and to increase the food daily by the same quantity for one month, and then to decrease in the same measure till one mouthful is again reached, and to make two images as above of two tolahs of gold and bestow them in alms with one cow.\n\nEpilepsy results from having administered poison to another at the command of a superior. The cure consists of these two images, a cow, a piece of land and thirty-two sers of sesame-seed, with a repetition of some incantations in the name of Mah\u0101deva.\n\nPain in the eyes arises from having looked upon another's wife. The cure is Ch\u0101ndr\u0101yana.\n\nBlindness is the punishment of a matricide which is followed by many years of suffering in hell. The cure is Praj\u0101patya,\\textsuperscript{19} which is of five kinds:\u2014(1). Bestowing a cow in charity; (2). Or one tolah of gold; (3). Or feeding twelve Br\u0101hmans; (4). Or throwing into the fire ten thousand times a mixture of sesame-seed, butter, honey and sugar; (5). Or walking a yojana, bare foot to a shrine. Let one or several of these be done in charity thirty times. Or let him make a boat of four tolahs of gold, the mast of silver, and six paddles of copper. Or, if it be a punishment of disobedience to father and mother, the cure is, as already described, the images of\n\n\\textsuperscript{18} One of the Praj\u0101patis or mind-born sons of Brahm\u0101.

Wilson, v. also Vol. II, 38.\n\n\\textsuperscript{19} Sacred to Praj\u0101pati. It signifies the giving away of the whole of one's property before entering on the life of an ascetic. It is also a kind of fast lasting twelve days and likewise a form of marriage. Monier Williams.\nKasyapa and Aditi. These should not be of less than two tolahs.\n\nDUMBNESS is the consequence of killing a sister. The cure is to bestow in charity a cow made of four tolas of gold, its horns be of two tolahs of silver, its hump of two or three m\u0101shas of copper with a brass vessel for milk, and for seven days he should eat a mixture of curds, butter, urine and cowdung.\n\nCOLIC results from having eaten with an impious person or a liar. The cure is to fast for three days, and to give twelve tolahs of silver in charity.\n\nSTONE IN THE BLADDER is the punishment of incest with a step-mother. [P. 122] The cure is Madhu-dhenu (honey-milch cow). Let it be supposed that milch-cow of honey is formed thus:\u2014Fourteen vessels full of honey, each of which shall contain a man and a quarter, must be placed with one tolah of gold in front to represent the mouth; four sers of sugar-candy must represent her tongue; thirty-two sers of fruit, her teeth; pearls for the two eyes; and two sticks of lignum aloes for her horns; two plantains stand for her two ears; and barley-flour for her teats, with three sticks of sugar-cane for each leg. A white woollen cloth is thrown over the vessels to represent her hide, and D\u0101ba, which is a particular kind of grass, is strewn above it. The hoofs are to be of silver, the hump of a ser and a quarter of copper: the tail of silk, thirty fingers in length, with skeins of silk eleven fingers long hanging therefrom. Two pieces of red cloth must be thrown over her neck, and seven heaps of grain, each of two sers weight, must be made, and a brass vessel placed in front, and another vessel full of honey set near to represent her calf, and a copper vessel filled with sesame-\n\n---\n\n20 The Kusa, Poa Cynosaroides; a sacrificial grass. A Br\u0101hman when he reads the Vedas, must, according to Manu (Institutes, II. 75), sit on kusa grass with the points to the east.\nseed. Next, certain incantations are made, and prayers are said, and alms given.\n\nLAMENESS is the result of having kicked a Br\u0101hman. The cure is to bestow in charity a horse made of a tolah of gold, and to feed one hundred and eight Br\u0101hmans.\n\nFEVER arises from killing an innocent Kshatriya. The cure: thirteen Br\u0101hmans should read incantations in the name of Mah\u0101deva one hundred times, and sprinkle water over his image.\n\nCONSUMPTION is the punishment of killing a Br\u0101hman. A lotus flower of four tolahs weight of gold should be made, and the ceremony of the Homa performed and alms given to righteous Br\u0101hmans.\n\nTUMOUR is caused by killing a wife without fault on her part. The cure is to spread a black antelope-skin (Krishn\u0101jina) and place thereon a heap of sesame-seed and a hundred tolahs or more of gold, and read incantations and perform the Homa oblation. But the acceptance of such an offering is considered blameable.\n\nASTHMA results from having accepted of this oblation, or of one of the sixteen great offerings, or of an alms at Kurukshetra. The cure is to take a buffalo of iron, with hoofs and horns of lead, and to make a sectarial mark of stone on its forehead, garland it with flowers of the Kaner (Nerium odorum), and place upon it a black blanket and four tolahs of gold, and three man and a half of pulse (M\u0101sh, Phaseolus mungo). The performer must have a sectarial mark drawn upon his forehead with the finger. The accepter of this charity is not well regarded. [P. 123]\n\nDYSENTERY is the punishment for robbing a house. The cure is to give in alms a house and its necessary furniture, and seven kinds of grain, thirty-two sers of each kind, a handmill, a pestle and mortar, a repository for drinking\n\n---\n\nThis is an obligation to the gods made by casting clarified butter into the fire, accompanied by prayers and invocations.\nwater, a kitchen-hearth, a broom, a cow, and money according to means.\n\nThe Third Kind indicates the class of actions which have caused sterility and names suitable remedies.\n\nA woman whose husband dies before her, was in a former birth of a great family and followed a stranger and on his death consigned herself to the flames. The cure is self-martyrdom by austerities, or suicide by throwing herself into snow.\n\nA woman who does not menstruate, in a former existence while in her courses, roughly drove away the children of her neighbours who had come as usual to play at her house. The cure is to fill an earthen vessel with water from a hundred wells, and to throw therein a betel-nut and one m\u0101sha of gold, anoint it with perfumes and give it to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. She should also give five, seven, nine or eleven kinds of fruit to children to eat.\n\nSterility is occasioned by a man or woman in a former birth having sold the children of other people, or the young of an oviparous animal, or reproached others for barrenness. Cure: the man and woman should enter the water at the meeting of two streams, wrapped in a single sheet, and bathe, and reciting certain incantations, pray to Mah\u0101deva and give one mohar each to eleven Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and a cow in alms on certain conditions, and make two images of Kasyapa and Aditi of two tolahs of gold each, and making an image of Vishnu in his dwarf incarnation (V\u0101mana), bestow it in charity. And they should also fill eight winnowing-baskets with seven kinds of grain, and lay upon it a cloth and cocoanuts and various kinds of fruit, with flowers of saffron, and sandal-wood, and give each of these to a virtuous woman, and hear the recital of the Harivansa, which is the conclusion of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\n\nA woman whose son dies shortly after his birth is thus punished for having in a former birth followed a common\npractice in Hindustan of exposing any child to die that is born when the moon is in the lunar station called Mula (v. Scorpionis) or Aslesha (1 and 2 Cancri) or near the end of Jyeshtha (Scorpionis, Antares), and a birth is especially a matter of reproach in Mula. The cure is to make a cow of four tolahs of gold, its hoofs of a tolah of silver, jewels for her tail, brass bells on her neck, a calf of a tolah of gold, its hoofs being of half a tolah of silver.\n\nA woman who gives birth to only daughters is thus punished for having contemptuously regarded her husband from pride. The cure is to plate the horns of a white cow with four tolahs of gold and burnish its hoofs with four tolahs of silver, and make a hump of one ser and a quarter of copper and a vessel of two sers and a half of brass, and bestow this in charity. One hundred Br\u0101hmans should also be fed and she should fashion a figure of the deity of ten m\u0101shas and two surkhs of gold, and reciting incantations, give alms and feed fifty Br\u0101hmans.\n\nA woman who has had but one son, is punished for having taken away a calf from its dam. Cure: let her give away a fine milch-cow with ten tolahs of gold.\n\nA woman who has given birth to a son that dies and a daughter that lives, has in her former existence, taken animal life. Some say that she had killed goats. The cure is the fast of the Ch\u0101ndr\u0101yana, a cow given in charity and the feeding of twelve Br\u0101hmans.\n\n[124] A woman who has continued in a state of pregnancy for sixteen years, has in a former birth been burnt when pregnant; the cure is an alms of Hiranya-garbha.\u00b2\u00b2\n\nBeing a maid-servant is the punishment for having in a former existence, from ignorance, had criminal intimacy with the husband of another and been burnt for his sake. The cure is, if she be in the house of a Sudra, to convey her to the\n\n\u00b2\u00b2 That is, the figure of Brahm\u0101.\nhouse of a Vaisya, and thus by graduation of caste to a Brahman's, where she should remain in service till her death.\n\nIn order to discover whether these punishments are for the deeds of the man or the woman, they should both take the horoscopes of the results of particular actions. If in the horoscope, either the fifth or eleventh (mansion), shows the ascendens to be the Sun, Mars, or Saturn or the head or tail of the Dragon (ascending or descending node), and these affect the character of the woman (as based on the three modes of goodness, passion and darkness) which is considered under the influence of Saturn, the punishment is reckoned to be that of the woman, otherwise it appertains to the man. If in both mansions, the results apply to both.23\n\nThe Fourth Kind treats of riches and poverty, and the like. Whoever distributes alms at auspicious times, as during eclipses of the moon and sun, will become rich and bountiful (in his next existence). Whoso at these times, visits any place of pilgrimage, especially Ilah\u0101b\u0101s (Allahabad), and there dies, will possess great wealth, but will be avaricious and of a surly disposition. Whosoever when hungry and\n\n---\n\n23 Each of the Zodiacial signs has peculiar qualities, and these have been tabulated by Albiruni, from the Lagh\u016bj\u0101takam. The cardinal points of Hindu astrology, as he observes, are the planets, zodiacal signs and the houses. The nature of the aspect of every sign depends upon the nature of the ascendens which at a given moment rises above the horizon. The aspect between one sign and the fourth or eleventh following, is a fourth part of an aspect: that between one sign and the fifth or ninth following, is half an aspect; between the sixth and tenth, three quarters, and between a sign and the seventh following, a whole aspect. If a planet stand in signs which in relation to its rising, are the 10th, 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th signs, its nature changes for the better: if in other signs for the worse. The Houses indicate severally, various parts of the body, future events as to life, property, disposition, the influences of particular planets and Zodiacial signs, etc. Some of the signs are male and others female alternately from Aries to Pisces. The first half of each male sign is unlucky, as under the influence of the sun which produces males, while the second half is lucky under the influence of the moon which produces females. Women are indicated by the seventh House which is under the influence of Saturn, as Abul Fazl rightly observes.\nwith food before him, hears the supplication of a poor man and bestows it all upon him, will be rich and liberal. But whosoever has been deprived of these three opportunities, will be empty-handed and poor in his present life. The cure is to fulfil scrupulously the duties of his state to whichsoever of the five classes he belongs, and also at Kurukshetra, in times of eclipse of the moon and sun, to bury in the ground a piece of gold, if it be but one m\u0101sha, as an oblation.\n\nWorks have been written on each of these four kinds, detailing the causes, symptoms, and remedies of these actions. I have but adduced a little as an exemplar of much by way of illustration.\n\nSVARA\n\nIs the extraordinary science of predicting events by observing the manner in which breath issues from the nostrils. The expiration of breath from the nostrils is in three ways. The first is when it comes principally from the left nostril, and this they ascribe to the influence of the moon. It is then called Id\u0101 (vital spirit), or Chandra-n\u0101di.24 The second is chiefly from the right nostril, and is called Pingala (sun, or fire) and Surya-n\u0101di. The third is when the breath issues from the nostrils equally, which is styled Sushumna and also Sambhu-n\u0101di. This is attributed to the influence of Mah\u0101deva. [P. 125]\n\nExperts in this science distinguish the excess or even breathings by placing the thumb beneath the nostril. Two and a half gharis is the time usually allotted to the two former kinds. The third occupies the time taken to pronounce a long vowel (guru), that is, a prolated vowel, as in m\u0101, thirty-six times. From the first tithi called pariw\u010125 to the third tithi,\n\n---\n\n24 N\u0101ri, or properly, N\u0101di, signifies in Sanskrit any tubular organ of the body, vein, etc.\n25 A lunar day, or the thirtieth part of a whole lunation, the first of which is called pariw\u0101.\nthe order of breathing is the Chandra-n\u0101di, followed by the Surya-n\u0101di for the same period, and, so on, alternately, to the end of the month. Some authorities regulate the order by weeks, allotting Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday to the Surya-n\u0101di, and Monday, Wednesday and Friday to the Chandra-n\u0101di; others, according to the sun's course through the Zodiacial signs, beginning with Aries for the Surya-n\u0101di breathings, Taurus for Chandra-n\u0101di, and so alternately through the signs to the close of the year. Others again take the retardation of the moon in the Zodiacial signs in the same manner. All are however agreed that irregularity in the prescribed order is productive of temporal misfortune. If the intermission continue for two or three days, quarrels will ensue; if for ten days, a misfortune will befall the wife; if for fifteen days, a severe illness will disturb the happiness of the house. Should it last for a month, the brother will die. If the Surya-n\u0101di breathings are in excess for one day and night, the man will die after the expiration of a year. If this anomaly continues for two and three days at a time, he will live a year for every day after the close of the year, according to the number of days. But if it continue for one month, he will die in a month. If the excess of the Chandra-n\u0101di be a day and night, the man will fall ill after expiration of the year, and in the same way, according to the number of days, after the close of the year, his sickness will continue. If the irregularity last for one month continuously, he will be ruined in estate. If the excess of Sushumna continues for ten days, the man will die at the entry of the sun into Aries. If Chandra-n\u0101di last this period, perturbation of mind and sickness will ensue. If Chandra-n\u0101di continues in operation throughout sixteen days after the entry of the Sun into Aries, symptoms of sickness will supervene. When the Sun is in Scorpio, if Chandra-n\u0101di continues in operation for two or five days, the man will die in eighteen years, but if the Sun be in Virgo, in fifteen years.\nAll are agreed that if at sun-rise, either Surya-n\u0101di or Chandra-n\u0101di will be operative, and the reverse of either at its setting, good fortune will result, otherwise a calamity will ensue, and if the Chandra-n\u0101di breathing be reversed in four gharis, it is a sign of the occurrence of fortunate events. [P. 126]\n\nAccording to the varied conditions of hours, days, Zodiacial signs, planetary movements, and manner of breathing in the three ways, divers events attended with joy or sorrow and other circumstances may be predicted. The Surya-n\u0101di and Chandra-n\u0101di are each five-fold, and each division is named after one of the five elements. In two gharis and a half, twenty pals are allotted to air; thirty pals to fire; forty pals to water; fifty pals to earth; and ten to ether. Some however give five pals to ether, ten to air, fifteen to fire, twenty to water, and twenty-five to earth, which are altogether equal to a ghari and a quarter. When this revolution is completed, the recurring series begins with earth, followed by water, fire, air and ether. Some suppose one ghari to be allotted severally to the elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether, and each element is distinguished by the manner of the breathing. If it rise upwards, it appertains to the element of fire; if laterally and not beyond the measure of four fingers' breath, to that of air; if it descend, to that of water, its motion being sensible at a distance of twelve fingers. If the impulse be on a level with the nostril, neither upwards nor downwards, nor high nor low, and extending to a distance of eight fingers, it belongs to ether.\n\nIn what relates to the particular conditions affecting human actions, this science also furnishes information. Repose betokens the elemental influence of earth; love of sensual pleasures and interior coldness signifies that of water; anger and the conditions that dispose the good inclinations of men to evil are the result of the fiery influence; and that\n\n* Two and a half gharis = 60 minutes, and a pal is equal to 24 seconds.\nof ether produces states of divine contemplation, and the emptying of the interior soul of extraneous affections.\n\nThey also erect a gnomon on a level surface of ground, and take the extent of its shadow according to determinate finger-measures, counting the length of one finger for Sunday, two for Monday, and so on, up to seven fingers for Saturday. To this they add twelve more and divide the whole into five parts. If no digit-index is left, it is ascribed to ether; if one, to air; if two, to fire; if three, to water; and if four, to earth.\n\nAnother practice is to insert the two thumbs in the orifices of the ears, and to close the mouth with the little and fourth fingers of each hand, while the middle fingers press each nostril, and the corners of the eyes are drawn down by the fore-fingers, and the glance is directed between the brows. A spherule then becomes visible. If it have a quadrangular shape, and as if liquefied, it appertains to the element of earth; if it be the shape of a half-moon, and incline to white and appear hard and cold, it is of water; if it be round, bright, hard and black, and variously spotted, it is thought to belong to the element of air; if triangular and luminous, to that of fire, and if no spherule be visible, it is the effect of ether.\n\nImparting instruction, donations, visiting religious teachers and guides, repairing to the presence of idols, entering a city or house, and other particulars of movement and change of place, and (according to one opinion), undertaking a journey into a foreign country (and in accordance with general custom), buying and selling, the antidotes to various poisons, the repelling of ominous stellar influences, conditions of friendship, culling medicinal plants and herbs in the woods, operations in alchemy, works relating to Yoga and other duties of the same gracious character, are believed to be most salutary during the Chandra-n\u0101di period; while entering the presence of kings, and undertaking war are best during the Surya-n\u0101di. In the Chandra-n\u0101di times, in battle, the enemy should be engaged from the left; during\nthe Surya-n\u0101di, from the right. Bodily safety is generally ascribed as dependent on the particular side of the breathing. The conquest of a province and (according to one opinion) travelling in one's own country, eating, sexual intercourse, bathing, imprisonment, withdrawing from any work, obstructing another's affections, and the like inauspicious actions, are suitable to the Surya-n\u0101di. In the Sushumna period, no work is undertaken.\n\nAll works of an auspicious nature are undertaken under the influence of the elements of water and earth, while those that are to be durable are chosen with reference to the elements of fire and air. No good work is ascribable to ether. When proceeding to any place, that foot is first lifted on whichever side the breathing is greatest, and if a person meets a superior to whom reverence is due, or from whom he expects to receive a favour, he takes care in his movements to keep that personage on the side on which he himself breathes; but an evil-disposed person, or a creditor, and the like, should be kept on the non-respiratory side. They also say that upper and forward situations are dominated by Chandra-n\u0101di, and those inferior and behind, by Surya-n\u0101di, and in both cases the parties must continue in their several positions till the action is concluded.\n\nANSWERS TO INQUIRERS.\n\nShould any one inquire whether a child about to be born, will be a boy or a girl, the person questioned must ascertain from which of his own nostrils the breathing is greater. If the questioner be on that side, he will gladden him with the news of a son; if not, he will reply that it will be a girl. If he breathes equally through both nostrils, there will be twins. If it should so happen that during the inquiry, he should breathe through one nostril more than another, he will predict the extinction of that life. Another opinion is that if the\nquestioner stand on the Chandra-n\u0101di side, it will be a girl; if on the Surya-n\u0101di, a boy, and if the breathing be of the kind Sushumna, an hermaphrodite. Some say that the times referrible to the elements of earth and water, indicate a boy, and those of fire and air, a girl, and ether implies death. If the inquiries relate to matters concerning study, tuition, marriage, menial service or its employment, attendance on the great, and buying and selling, the element of water prognosticates speedy success; that of earth, more tardy; of air, the success will be small; of fire, gain followed by loss. Ether shows no benefit. If the inquiry be regarding rain, the elements of earth and water indicate that rain will fall, but in the latter there is great evidence of a plentiful supply to the crops. The element of air predicts clouds without rain; and fire, gentle showers. Regarding questions as to crops, water and earth show that they will yield the revenue, and in the latter case a full harvest; air indicates a moderate crop, and fire that it will be burnt up. No evidence of result is shown by ether. Should the inquiry be relative to sickness, and if the period be Chandra-n\u0101di, and the questioner be on the Surya-n\u0101di side, or vice versa, the sick person will die, but if he stand on the Chandra-n\u0101di side, the patient will quickly recover. Should the question be made on the Surya-n\u0101di side, the illness will be protracted, but recovery will follow. Others look to the manner of the breathing. If the question be put during an inspiration which is called living breath, it is a sign of life; but if during an expiration, which is styled lifeless breath, the patient will die; in all inquiries this rule is regarded. A man bitten by a snake or under demoniacal possession, or mauled by a hy\u00e6na\\(^2\\) is accounted among sick persons. [P. 128]\n\nShould the question be regarding invasion by a foreign\n\n---\n\n\\(^2\\) That is, a mad hy\u00e6na, which only in that state is supposed to attack a man.\nforce: if the period be Chandra-n\u0101di, and the questioner stand on that side, it indicates an affirmative; if he stand on the Surya-n\u0101di side, a negative. Others say that if the times appertain to the elements of earth and water, no invasion will occur, but those of fire and air denote an advance. Ether gives no response. If the inquiries be concerning war and peace, Chandra-n\u0101di implies the latter, and Surya-n\u0101di the former. Some maintain that the earth-periods predict a severe engagement and that many will be wounded, while fire, air and ether point to losses on both sides. Water signifies a peace. If the question relate to the issue between the querist and his enemy, earth implies war, and that many will fall; fire predicts victory to the questioner; air defeat, and ether his death in the engagement; water indicates a coming peace.\n\nIf information be sought regarding the result of hostilities between defenders of a country and foreign troops, Chandra-n\u0101di denotes victory to the former, and Surya-n\u0101di to the latter. Some are of opinion that if the questioner stand on the left, and the period be Chandra-n\u0101di, if the letters of the name of the questioner be even, he will be successful: if he stand on the right, and it be Surya-n\u0101di, and the number of the letters be odd, victory will rest with the latter. If both names have an equal number of letters, and the questioner be on the side of the breathing nostril, the former will have the advantage; if on the side of the non-breathing nostril, the latter.\n\nIf information is asked, regarding a person absent, the water-periods indicate his speedy arrival; earth, that he is settled where he is; air, that he has emigrated to another country, and fire implies his death. Ether reveals nothing. If the thoughts of the questioner refer to any subject of the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, earth-periods imply the vegetable; water and air, the animal, and fire, the inorganic and mineral; the ether-periods point to the absence of these thoughts from the mind of the questioner.\nSuch is this strange account, of which let the foregoing suffice:\n\n**AGAMA**\n\nis a doctrinal treatise on incantations relative to things that will produce advantage or repel hurt, increase knowledge and remedy diseases, augment wealth, destroy enemies, cement friendship, secure conquest and advance good government, and the like.\n\n**SAKUNA**\n\nor augury,\\(^{28}\\) is the extraordinary art of predicting events from the motions of birds. Their song, their silence, their movements and repose, and indications of pleasure and sadness, and similar signs, discover the present and the future. There are many in this country who are skilled in this important science. One day, in a royal preserve, two *main\u0101s*\\(^{29}\\) sat perched side by side chirping low together. His Majesty deigned to inquire the subject of their converse from an expert in this divination, who replied [129] that were he to reveal their confidence to his Majesty, he would not be believed. The male desired to pair while the female excused herself. It was not improbable that if the nest were searched stains of blood would be found. On examination being made, his words were found to be true. The sooth-sayers of Hindustan foretell future events chiefly by means of five methods, the stars, breathing from the nostrils, augury, incantations, and *kevala*,\\(^{30}\\) which is divination by the throwing of dice, and it comprises various other kinds of prognostication.\n\n\\(^{28}\\) Augury in Hastings, iv. 800.\n\n\\(^{29}\\) *Acridotheres tristis*. The word is *s\u0101r* in the Persian, a starling. The *Sturnus vulgaris*, or common starling, is the *teliy\u0101 main\u0101*.\n\n\\(^{30}\\) Abul Fazl spells this word carefully as *kyul*. But the Sanskrit word *kevala* has nothing to do with dice-casting. The word nearest to that sense is the Arabic *Ka'b*, meaning a cube or die, also *Ka'bt*. In Sanskrit the word *kevala* means spiritual liberation or pure unalloyed knowledge. [J. S.]\nor Palmistry, predicts events from observation of the character of the members of the body\u2014and their movements, and from lines and marks, and the results are generally accurate.\n\n**Garuda**\n\nis a science treating of snakes, scorpions, and other venomous reptiles, the effects of whose injuries it averts. By reciting incantations and repeating the genealogical descent (of the person affected) and praising his ancestry, the animal is made to appear. An extraordinary circumstance is the following: They take an old snake of a particular kind, and after certain incantations they make it bite a Br\u0101hman. When the poison works, the man becomes senseless, in which state he answers any questions put to him, and these prove correct. The Hindu sages believe that during the Kali cycle, nothing can be more true than these revelations of the unknown, and several works containing these answers are still extant.\n\n**Indra-Jala**\n\nis the art of sorcery, of magical spells, and sleight of hand. The wonders performed by these means are beyond the power of expression.\n\n---\n\n31 This is the name of the 17th Pur\u0101\u1e47a relating to the birth of Garuda, the mythical bird of vulture, half-man, half-bird, on which Vishnu rides. He is the king of birds, descended from Kasyapa and Vina\u1e6d\u0101, a daughter of Daksha, and a great enemy of serpents; a hatred inherited from his mother, who had quarrelled with her co-wife Kadru, the mother of serpents. He is represented as having the head, wings, and talons of an eagle, and the body and limbs of a man, and has many names and epithets. According to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, his parents gave him liberty to devour wicked men, but was recommended not to touch a Br\u0101hman. Curiosity, or hunger, however, once prevailed, and he is said to have swallowed a Br\u0101hman and his wife together; but his throat was so burnt in the act that he was glad to disgorge them. It is probably this circumstance which gave rise to the practice mentioned by Abul Fazl.\nRASA-VIDYA\n\nor Alchemy, is the science of the fusing of mercury (rasa), gold, silver, copper, and the like. It is by this art that the elixir, or philosopher's stone, is produced.\n\nRATNA-PARIKSHA\n\nis the art of testing jewels and precious stones of various kinds, and treats of their production, properties, value, and kindred subjects.\n\nKAMA-SASTRA\n\ntreats of the generation of the human race. [P. 130]\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nSAHITYA\n\nor rhetorical composition, is a science comprising various kinds of knowledge. It sets forth the shades of signification in words, appropriateness of expression, and solecisms of language. They hold the Supreme Being to be its author. The meaning underlying a word is said to be four-fold:\u2014(1). Sakti (power of a word), is denotation and its conventional relation to the thing designated. (2). Lakshan\u0101 (indication)\u00b9 communicates the applied meaning desired. (3). Gauna, (qualitative), illustrates figuratively the thing compared. (4). Vyanjan\u0101 (suggestion), is to say one thing and mean another which has no apparent application. As, for example, a woman sent her maid-servant with a message to call her husband who, when she entered his private apartment, used criminal familiarity with her and sent an excuse by her for his not returning. When she took back the message, from the pallor of her face\n\n\u00b9 This term is thus explained in the S\u0101hitya Darpana, by Visvan\u0101tha Kavir\u0101ja, to which work Abul Fazl is apparently indebted for his information. The power by which in such an expression as \"the impetuous Kalinga,\" a word such as \"Kalinga,\" incompatible with the epithet 'impetuous,' if taken in its own sense of a particular country on the Coromandel coast, causes one to think not of the country, but the men connected therewith . . . . this power communicated to it, other than that which belongs to it naturally, is called Indication. Of this element in the drama there are 6 kinds. The treatise classes a word according to the three-fold accident of its function, as Expressive, Indicative and Suggestive. The expressed meaning is termed V\u0101chya, conveyed to the understanding by the word's denotation (abhidha, literally, power or sense of a word) as a 'cow', or 'horse'; the meaning indicated is held to be conveyed by the word's indication, lakshan\u0101, as above explained: the meaning suggested (vyangya), is conveyed by the word's Suggestion (vyanjana). \"Indication\" has a further eight-fold subdivision, into pure (suddha), and qualitative (gauna), which latter Abul Fazl classes separately, though acknowledging, later on, its inclusion by some authors under the second head. c. p. 16 and ff. of Pramad\u0101 D\u0101sa Mitra's translation of the above treatise.\nand the obliteration of her marks of sandal-wood and collyrium, and of the colour (from her lips), the wife understood what had really occurred. Though much pained, she showed no signs of it in her speech, but said,\u2014\u2018You are speaking on untruth; you never went to fetch him, but you went to the banks of the stream and bathed, for the collyrium is no longer round your eyes nor the sandal-wood unguent on your person.\u2019 By this delicate irony she discovered her knowledge of what had taken place, and her own distress of mind.\n\nSome consider the figurative sense (gauna), to belong to the second head, and they describe with peculiar force and elaborate detail all that makes for literary ornament and grace of expression. It is held to be the highest form of dramatic poetry, of rhetorical art, and metrical composition. This science also comprises the Navarasa, or the nine sentiments, which inspire universal interest. The first is Sring\u0101ra-rasa (the erotic passion), that is, the mutual affection of men and women, and all that relates to their union and separation. Secondly, H\u0101sy\u0101-rasa, mirth of various kinds. This is produced, they say, by variations in person, speech, action and dress. It is three-fold:\u20141. Smita, (smile), a slight alteration in cheek, eye and lip. (2). Vihasita (gentle laugh), in which the mouth is a little open. (3). Apahasita, laughter accompanied by sound of the voice. [P. 131] Thirdly, Karun\u0101-rasa, pity or regret, as at the loss of a friend or property. Fourthly, Raudra, anger. Fifthly, Vira (heroism), the admiration produced by acts of munificence, clemency and valour.\n\n---\n\n2 This identical example occurs in the S\u0101hitya Darpana.\n\n3 This refers to Chapters IV and V on what is called \u201cSuggestive poetry,\u201d which is regarded as its chief beauty. The Sanskrit term for this figurative style is Dhvani, and it is said by the author of the work of this name, \u201cLike a beautiful woman with a single member ornamented, the sentence of a good poet shines with \u2018Suggestion\u2019 displayed by a single word.\u201d\u2014S\u0101hitya Darpana, p. 150.\n\n4 A fourth division is mentioned in the S. D., viz., Atihasita, convulsion of laughter, where the limbs lose all control.\nSixthly Bhay\u0101naka, terror. Seventhly, Bibhatsa, aversion. Eighthly, Adbhuta, wonder, as at the sight of any (extraordinary object. Ninthly, S\u0101nta (quietism), the tranquillity that comes of knowledge and the indifference which regards friend and foe as alike. Of these they make various subdivisions and illustrate them by delightful examples.\n\nThe relations between the sexes are also considered in this branch of knowledge, and the passion of love amply discussed. In Ir\u0101n and Tur\u0101n, this affection chiefly subsists between men; in Hindustan and Hij\u0101z, between men and women. Devotion to the female sex is the characteristic of the Arab, while the native of India includes both sexes alike in his regard.\n\nThe Hindus term a heroine (in dramatic poetry), n\u0101yika, and three kinds are named. (1). Sv\u012by\u0101, (own wife), a virtuous woman devoted to her husband: from modesty she looks neither to the right hand nor to the left, but only from the corner of her eyes so that her glance is rarely seen: her laugh does not pass beyond her lips and her teeth are not disclosed: she speaks seldom and never loudly: she rarely loses her temper, and if she be provoked to anger, it is restrained within her heart and does not appear in her eyes or manner. (2). Parakiy\u0101, (belonging to another), is one who clandestinely carries on an intrigue with other than her husband. If a married woman she is called Praudha; a maiden, Kanyak\u0101. Other classifications of this kind are carried to an indefinite extent. S\u0101m\u0101ny\u0101 (courtesan), is the property of none, and is concerned only in making money.\n\n5 A tenth is sometimes added, v\u0101tsalya, paternal fondness; but according to others there are only eight rasas, the last two being omitted. These affections are supposed to lend to dramatic composition its relish and interest, and examples are culled from works that illustrate their force and beauty, as for instance, Bhava-bhuti's drama of the Vira-charita exemplifies the rasa of heroism, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that of quietism or tranquillity, etc. These various sentiments are discussed and evidenced by instances from dramatic poetry, in the S\u0101hitya-darpana.\nSviy\u0101 is classed under three heads:\u2014(1). Mugdh\u0101, (artless), one who from her childish age and inexperience goes out-of-doors, and in whom youth begins to grow headstrong, and who may be to some extent conscious of her beauty or otherwise, and shrinks from the embraces of her husband. When she retires to sleep, she regards him furtively and pretends to slumber lest he should enter into conversation but from fear of him sleeps not. The age of such a one ranges from eight to twelve and at times to thirteen.\n\n(2). Madhy\u0101 (middling or adolescent) is one in whom modesty and love for her husband are combined in an equal degree. She may speak in anger [132] but never thus to her husband. Her age does not exceed thirty-two. (3). Pragalbh\u0101 (bold or mature) makes her love and address pleasing to her husband and captivates him by her experienced arts. The age of this kind extends to fifty-two years.\n\nThe last two are further subdivided into three classes. (1). Dhir\u0101 (constant). If her husband pay attention to another woman, though fired by jealousy, she becomes more assiduous in her devotion and service and by this means makes him ashamed of his conduct. (2). Adhir\u0101 (capricious). Such a one takes no notice of his infidelity and holds her peace, but she will address him cheerfully so as to cover him with confusion and say:\u2014\"It is strange that while you are wakeful, my eyes glance love and while you are drunk with wine, my heart is in agitation.\" (3). Dhir\u0101 Adhir\u0101, is one who unites both these dispositions and sighs to show that she understands. Some add a conversation after the manner above indicated.\n\nSviy\u0101 is also of two kinds. (1). Jyesht\u0101 (pre-eminent, eldest), is one who is preferred by her husband above all\n\n---\n\n*This appears to be an error. The S\u0101hitya Darpana says that she 'never goes out of the inner apartments, no longer laughs unconstrainedly, but practises every moment some bashful restraint. Little she speaks,' etc. Verses, taken from the marriage of Prabh\u0101vati by the author.*\nwomen. (2). Kanisth\u0101 (inferior, youngest) is one for whom her husband\u2019s affection is less strong.\n\nParakiy\u0101 is of five kinds. (1). Gupt\u0101 (guarded) covers her conduct, and skilfully conceals her past indiscretions and her future designs, feigning plausible excuses. If for instance she has been scratched by her lover\u2019s nail, she will say \u201cI cannot sleep in this room:\u2014a cat chases a mouse, and in the scramble gives me this scratch.\u201d (2). Vidagdh\u0101 (adroit or artful). By her persuasive speech she acquires influence and her winning manners secure it. (3). Laksh\u012bt\u0101 (notorious), shows her affection openly and without fear. (4). Kulat\u0101 (unchaste), has many lovers and retains the affections of each without pecuniary considerations. (5) Anusay\u0101n\u0101 (regretting), is one who from timidity does not keep her assignation and is fearful lest her lover come and not find her.\n\nThey also class women under eight heads:\u2014(1). Proshitabhartrik\u0101 is one whose husband is abroad, and she is distressed at his absence from her, or he is on the point of setting out and she is disquieted by her fears. Other opinions subdivide this, making nine classes. (2). Khandit\u0101 is one who is disconsolate at being betrayed by her husband or lover. [P. 133] (3). Kalah\u0101ntarit\u0101 is one who has quarrelled with her lover and is penitent and wishes to appease him. (4). Vipralabdha goes to an assignation but is disappointed at not finding her lover. (5). Utk\u0101r is disconsolate at her lover\u2019s not coming, and seeks the cause thereof. (6). V\u0101sakasajj\u0101 is joyful at the coming of her lover, and is dressed in her ornaments to receive him. (7). Sv\u0101dhina-patik\u0101, (independent\u2014having her own way), is a woman whose lover is obedient to her wishes. (8). Abhis\u0101rik\u0101, is one who invites her lover, or herself goes to him.\n\nAnother classification of women is of three kinds:\u2014(1). Uttam\u0101 (best), is one who is in love with her husband\n\n---\n\n7 Utkanthit\u0101 is the more correct term in the heroic drama for a woman who longs after her absent lover or husband.\nthough he show her no affection. (2). *Adham\u0101* (worst), opposite of the above. (3). *Madhyama* (intermediate), is sometimes united in harmony and affection with her husband and at times is unfriendly and estranged.\n\nA further division is four-fold:\u2014(1). *Padmini*, is incomparable for her beauty and good disposition, and is tall of stature. Her limbs are perfectly proportioned; her voice soft, her speech gracious though reserved, and her breath fragrant as the rose. She is chaste and obedient to her husband. (2). *Chitrini*, is somewhat inferior to the former; is neither stout nor thin, has a slender waist and a full bust. (3). *Sankhini*, is fat and short, constantly quarrelling with her husband and has a violent temper. (4). *Hastini*, is repulsive in appearance and manners.\n\nAll these are treated at length, with the particular classes of men that are suited to each. *M\u0101na* signifies indignation in a woman at misconduct on the part of her husband. It is of four kinds:\u2014(1). *Laghu*, (trifling), when she gives herself airs at the least caress or endearment of her husband or lover. (2). *Madhya* (middling), is when she is estranged by some slight provocation. (3). *Guru* (weighty), when after much exertion [entreaty] on his part, [P. 134] she lays aside her wayward humour. (4). *Ras\u0101bhasa* (simulated sentiment), is when she refuses reconciliation.\n\nThe lover or hero (in a drama) is called *N\u0101yaka*. These also are named suitably to the heroines, but are restricted to three:\u2014(1). *Pati* (lord or husband), chooses in wedlock only a Hindu woman. (2). *Upapati* (paramour). (3). *Vaishayika*, a sensualist.\n\nEach of these is subdivided into four kinds:\u2014(1). *Anukula*, (faithful), is attached to one woman only. (2). *Dakshina* (impartial), pays his addresses to many, and adroitly secures the favours of all. (3). *Dhrishta*, (cool or impudent), is one whom the heroine in her indignation repels while he caresses and flatters her the more. (4). *Satha*,\n(perfidious), by cunning and simulating affection wins her heart (though attached to another).8\n\nIn the treatment of love-episodes, the greatest art is shown in the situations of the hero and heroine and the dramas abound with the most felicitous passages.\n\n*Sakhi* is the term for the usual female confidante on whose faithful service the heroine relies. Her advice and devotion are of the greatest comfort. She jests and amuses her mistress and never fails her in the time of need. She arranges her ornaments and assists in tiring her. By her persuasive representations she removes the misunderstandings between husband and wife and effects a reconciliation. She is ever ready with her counsel and good offices, and is entrusted with messages. Such a female is called *duti*; if a man, *duta*. She is conversant with all the mysteries of union and separation and is an expert in matters connected with love and rivalry.\n\nIn this art the manners and bearing of the hero and the heroine are set forth with much variety of exposition, and illustrated by delightful examples. The works on this subject should be consulted by those who are interested in its study.\n\n**SANGITA**\n\nis the art of singing, accompanied by music and dancing. The subject is treated in seven chapters (*adhy\u0101yas*).\n\nThe first is *Svar\u0101dhya\u015ba*, on musical tone which is of two kinds. [135] (1). *An\u0101hata*, sound produced without cause (i.e., otherwise than by percussion). This is considered to be one and eternal. If a man close both orifices of his\n\n---\n\n8 These four divisions are subdivided into sixteen. The cool or impudent lover is thus amusingly exemplified in the *Sahitya Darpana*: \"Perceiving her countenance crimson with passion, I went near intending to kiss her. She spurned me with her foot; but having humbly caught hold of it, I burst out laughing. O my friend, the anger of the fair-browed one, shedding tears, from her then being unable to do anything, prolongs, whenever thought of, the amusement of my mind,\" p. 59.\nears with his fingers, he will be conscious of a resonance, and this is signified by the above term. They believe this to proceed from Brahma, and when the consciousness of it becomes habitual and it is heard without mediate aid, final liberation (mukti) is then attained. (2). Ahata, sound produced by a cause, which, like speech, is accounted a quality of air and is produced by percussion and protrusion. They say that in each of the three locations of the abdomen, the throat, and the head, twenty-two fibres or chords have been divinely created. The primary movement of air is from the navel, and the volume of sound produced depends upon the strength or softness of the initial force exerted.\n\nThe doctrine of the vital airs has already preceded in the account of the schools of Hindu philosophy. The abdomen is supposed to be the seat of the fire which keeps up the heat of the body, and this fire is surrounded and retained in place by the airs called Samana. In the Patanjala system, by the subdual of this air, the perfected Yogin appears illumined by the radiance of the flame which then escapes from the body. The same internal heat plays an important part in the production of the voice. According to Rajah Sir Sourindro Mohun Tagore, in his pamphlet, The Twenty-two Musical Srutis of the Hindus, when the animal soul wishes to speak, the mind acts on the abdominal fire which mixes with the vital air pervading the ligament known as Brahma Granthi, below the navel. This vital air thus expands, causing in the navel the ati sukshma nada, or the very minute sound; in the chest, the sukshma or the minute; in the throat, the pushta, or the developed; in the head, the apushta, or suppressed; and in the mouth, the kritrima, or artificial. Connected with or based upon these chords, are the twenty-two srutis, or particles of sound sensible to the ear, which are essential to the formation of the Hindu Saptaka, or heptachord.\n\nIt is strange that, though the srutis form the basis of Hindu Music, Abul Fazl does not mention the term nor allude to them except by implication as vocal chords in the human frame.\n\nThe Srutis are personified as Nymphs, and have each their name, though varying in different writers. The 21 murchhanas, which also play an important part in Hindu Music, are omitted by Abul Fazl.\n\nSangita Ratnakara, (Ed. Vedantavagisa and Sarada Prasada Ghosha, p. 61). These Murchhanas and not the ragas may be said to correspond to the Greek\u2014modes of the Aeolian, Lydian, Ionic, Doric or Phrygian, so named according to the character of the sentiments they inspired. The effect of the different murchhanas when played on the sitara, is very striking.\nThey consider that the fifth, sixth, eighteenth and nineteenth chords are mute and the remaining eighteen are classed under the seven primary notes in the following order:\n\n(1). *Shadja*,\\(^{10}\\) is taken from the note of the peacock (and extends to the fourth chord). (2). *Rishabha*, is taken from the note of the *Papiha* (Coccystes Melanoleucos), and beginning after the fourth chord (omitting the fifth and sixth), extends from the seventh to the tenth. (3). *G\u0101ndh\u0101ra*, is from the bleating of a he-goat and its compass extends from the ninth to the thirteenth. (4). *Madhyama*, resembles the cry of the Coolen Crane\\(^{11}\\) (*Ardea Sibirica*), and its compass is from the thirteenth to the sixteenth. (5). *Panchama*, is taken from the note of the *Ka\u2019il* (*Cuculus Indicus*), and is attuned on the seventeenth. (6). *Dhaiavata*, is like the croak of the frog, and its compass extends from the twentieth\\(^{12}\\) to the twenty-second. (7). *Nish\u0101da* is taken from the sound of the elephant and its compass is from the twenty-second to the third of the next series (of twenty-two). Each heptachord occurs successively in each series, and in the third, *Nish\u0101da*, cannot, of course, go beyond the twenty-second chord.\n\nA system of intervals in which the whole seven notes of the gamut are employed, is termed *Sampurna*. If there be only six, the fundamental must be one of them, and it is styled *Sh\u0101dava*; if five, *Audava*, the fundamental being of necessity one of them. None has fewer than these, but the *t\u0101na* which is a separate intonation may consist of two.\\(^{13}\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^{10}\\) Pronounced *Sharja*. It means literally six-born; i.e., the fundamental from which the other six notes arise.\n\n\\(^{11}\\) According to the *Sangita Darpana* the note is that of the *Krauncha*, or heron (*Arden Jaculator*).\n\n\\(^{12}\\) The text has eight, which must be an error for twenty. The seven notes of the scale are represented by the seven initial syllables of their names, after the manner of Guido\u2019s notation, thus: Sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, corresponding to our,\u2014D. E. F. G. A. B. C.\n\nand the *Sr\u016btis* are allotted to the several notes, as follows: to *Sa*, *ma* and *pa*, four; to *ri* and *dha*, three; to *ga* and *ni*, two.\n\n\\(^{13}\\) By the term *naghma* which I have rendered system of intervals, a *murchhan\u0101* must be meant. Each *murchhan\u0101* is said to\nThe second is R\u0101ga-vivek\u0101dhy\u0101ya, on divers musical compositions and their variations.\u00b9\u2074\n\nTheir origin is ascribed to Mah\u0101deva and (his wife) P\u0101rvati. The first-mentioned had five mouths, from each of which issued a melody in the following order:\n\n1. Sri-r\u0101ga.\n2. Vasanta.\n3. Bhairava.\n4. Panchama.\n5. Megah.\n6. Nata-Nar\u0101yana was produced by P\u0101rvati.\n\nbe sampurna, or complete, when all seven notes are employed, and asampurna when defective. When wanting one it is called Shadava and wanting two Audava. In the murchhan\u0101s of Sharja, sa, ri, pa, ni, and in those of Madhyama, sa, ri, ga, used to be omitted one at a time, to make Shadavi Murchhan\u0101s which were 49 in number, viz., 28 of Sharja and 21 of Madhyama. The Audavi murchhan\u0101s of Sharja were formed by omitting sa, pa, or ri, pa, or ga, ni, and were therefore 21. The omission of ri, and dha, at one time, and at another of ga and ni, formed the twelve Audavi murchhan\u0101s of Madhyama. The total number of these latter is therefore 35 in the two gr\u0101mas which with the 49 \u015b\u0101davis make 84 asampurna murchhan\u0101s which were called t\u0101nas by some authors.\n\nThe various combinations of the different notes in a murchhan\u0101, are called t\u0101nas, each, from seven notes to one, having a separate name. The aggregate combinations of all these by a process of simple arithmetic show a total of 13,699.\n\n\u00b9\u2074 So I render \"maqam\" and \"shubah\" by which Abul Fazl signifies r\u0101gas and r\u0101ginis. Willard and Carey dispute the usual translation of r\u0101ga by mode, and Sir S. M. Tagore confirms their dissent by his own; he says there is no corresponding term in English for r\u0101ga. From an able article in the Cal. Rev., CXXXVII. of 1879, by S\u0101rada Pras\u0101da Ghosha, the learned co-editor of the Sangita Ratnak\u0101ra, to which I am already indebted for the substance of this information on the murchhan\u0101s and t\u0101nas, I borrow the following explanation of the r\u0101ga. It is defined as a musical composition consisting of not less than five notes of a Murchhan\u0101 (mark this term) in accordance with certain rules with a view to a particular aesthetic effect. The chief rules are that a note is assumed with which the R\u0101ga begins. This is called graha; another with which it must invariably end, called ny\u0101sa; a third, which is the tonic or predominant, repeated oftenest than the others, and perhaps more noticeable also in the time, and called ansa or b\u0101di; a fourth, which is 9 or 13 struts above or below the b\u0101di, used almost as frequently and termed samb\u0101di. A r\u0101ga differs from another consisting of notes of a different murchhan\u0101, when a b\u0101di, samb\u0101di or gr\u0101ha, etc., in the one is not the same in the other. Other distinctions and subtleties of interchange and mutilations of the scale produce countless varieties of the r\u0101ga. It will be thus seen that the r\u0101ga depends chiefly on its murchhan\u0101 which can produce only r\u0101gas in a certain setting, the change of the murchhan\u0101, b\u0101di and samb\u0101di altering the class of the r\u0101ga.\nEach of these six modes is called in Sanskrit R\u0101ga, and they are reckoned the primary orders of sound. Each of them has numerous variations.\n\nThe Sri-r\u0101ga has the whole seven notes (sampurna) of the gamut. In this, Rishabha has a compass to the eighth chord, Gandh\u0101ra to the tenth, Madhyama to the thirteenth, and Dhaivata to the twenty-first: Nish\u0101da is allotted but one. And in like manner other changes occur throughout all the modifications.\n\n1. Variations of Sri-Raga:\u2014(1). M\u0101lavi. (2). Tirovani. (3). Gauri. (4). Ked\u0101ri. (5). Madhu-m\u0101dhavi. (6). Vih\u0101ri.\n\n2. Variations of Vasanta:\u2014(1). Desi. (2). Devagiri. (3). Vair\u0101ti. (4). Todi. (5). L\u0101lit\u0101. (6). Hindoli.\n\n3. Variations of Bhairava:\u2014(1). Madhya-m\u0101di. (2). Bhairavi. [137] (3). B\u0101ngah. (4). Var\u0101taka. (5). Sindavi. (6). Punarjney\u0101.\n\n4. Variations of Panchama:\u2014(1). Vibh\u0101sa. (2). Bhup\u0101li. (3). K\u0101nar\u0101. (4). Badhansik\u0101. (5). Malasri. (6). Padhamanjari.\n\n5. Variations of Megha:\u2014(1). Mal\u0101r. (2). Sorathi. (3). As\u0101vari. (4). Kaisuki. (5). Gandh\u0101ri. (6). Harsing\u0101ri.\n\n6. Variations of Nata Narayana:\u2014(1). Kamodi. (2). Kaly\u0101n. (3). Ahiri. (4). Suddhan\u0101ta. (5). Salak. (6). Nat-Hamira.\n\nSome allow only five variations to each mode and numerous other differences occur. Others in place of Vasanta,\n\n---\n\n15 I take the following variants from the Sangita Darpana,\u2014Trivan\u0101, Ked\u0101r\u0101, and Pah\u0101ri. Many of the terms given by Abul Fazl below, also differ from the names in the S\u0101hitya Darpana.\n\n16 This is a blunder through ignorance of Sanskrit from which Abul Fazl\u2019s pandits should have saved him. This list is taken from Hanum\u0101n who gives but five R\u0101gin\u012bs in the exact order of the names in Abul Fazl and concludes the fifth in the S. D., with the sloka \u092a\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0947 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f \u092d\u0948\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u0930\u0923\u093e\u0903 i.e., \u201cand (Sindavi, etc.) are to be understood as the beautiful wives of Bhairava\u201d. The words in italics have been mistaken by Abul Fazl for the name of a R\u0101gini.\nPanchama and Megha, substitute M\u0101lakausika, Hindola and Dipaka, and make five instead of six variations to each, with a few other discrepancies of less importance. Others again, in place of the second, third, fourth and fifth modes, have Suddha-bhairava, Hindola, Desak\u0101ra and Suddha-n\u0101\u1e6da.\n\nSongs are of two kinds. The first is called M\u0101rga or the lofty style as chanted by the gods and great Rishis, which is in every country the same, and held in great veneration. The masters of this style are numerous in the Dekhan, and the six modes abovementioned with numerous variations of which the following are examples, are held by them to appertain to it.\n\n(1). Surya-prak\u0101sa. (2). Pancha-t\u0101lesvara. (3). Sarvato-bhadra. (4). Chandra-prak\u0101sa. (5). R\u0101ga-kadamba. (6). Jhumara. (7). Svaravartani.\n\nThe second kind is called Desi or applicable to the special locality, like the singing of the Dhrupad in Agra, Gwalior, B\u0101ri and the adjacent country. When M\u0101n Singh (Tonwar) ruled as R\u0101j\u0101 of Gwalior, with the assistance of N\u0101yak Bakshu, Macchu, and Bhanu, who were the most distinguished musicians of their day, he introduced a popular style of melody which was approved even by the most refined\n\n---\n\n17 According to Capt. Day (The Music and Musical Instruments of Southern India, Chap. VIII), from early times Tanjore has been the chief seat of Music in Southern India, and most of the chief Karn\u0101tik musicians have either lived there or were educated in the Tanjore School.\n\n18 See p. 611 n. Vol. I. The fame of the Gwalior School of Music dates from the reign of this prince. Bakshu continued at the court of Bikram\u0101jit, the son of M\u0101n Singh, and after his death entered the service of R\u0101j\u0101 Kirat of K\u0101linjar, whence he was invited to the court of Gujar\u0101t. Bayley in his History of Gujar\u0101t, speaks of a minstrel called Bacchu attached to Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur\u2019s court, who was taken before Hum\u0101yun on the capture of Mandu in 1535. The Emperor had given orders for a general massacre, but being told that this musician had not his equal in Hindustan, he was directed to sing and so charmed the royal ear, that he was given a dress of honour and attached to the court. He subsequently fled to Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur who was so rejoiced at his return that he declared his every wish fulfilled and sorrow banished from his heart.\ntaste. On his death, Bakshu and Machhu passed into the service of Sult\u0101n Mahmud of Gujar\u0101t where his new style came into universal favour.\n\nThe Dhurpad\\(^{19}\\) (Dhruva-pada) consists of four rhythmical lines without any definite prosodial length of words or syllables. It treats of the fascinations of love and its wondrous effects upon the heart. In the Dekhan these songs are expressed in their language by the term Chind, and consist of three or four lines, and are chiefly laudatory. In the Tilanga and Carnatic [P. 139] dialects they are called Dhruva, and their subject is erotic. Those of Bengal are called Bangala, and those of Jounpur, Chutkala, while the songs of Delhi are called kaul and tar\u0101na. These last were introduced by Amir Khusaru, of Delhi, in concert with S\u0101mit and Tat\u0101r, and by combining the several styles of Persia and India, form a delightful variety. The songs of Mathura are called Bishn-pad, (Vishnu-pada) consisting of four, six and eight lines, sung in honour of Vishnu. Those of Sind are styled K\u0101mi and are amatory. Those in the dialect of Tirhut are called Lahch\u0101ri, and are the composition of Biddy\u0101-pat, and in character highly erotic. In Lahor and the adjacent parts, they are called Chhand; those of Gujar\u0101t, Jakri.\\(^{20}\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^{19}\\) Willard calls the Dhurpad the heroic song of Hindustan, the subject being frequently the recital of the memorable actions of their heroes, and also treating of love and even of trifling and frivolous topics. Its origin he ascribes to R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh whom he calls the father of Dhurpad singers. Chind in the text I suspect to be an error for Chhand, (Sansk. Chhandas) a sacred hymn and also a musical measures; Dhruva signifies the introductory stanza or recurring verse of a poem or song repeated as a refrain. Chutkala is a jest or pleasantry and these songs resemble probably the ancient Fescennine verses designed to catch the coarse and indelicate humour of the mob. The Bishan-pad according to Willard, was introduced by the blind (sur) poet and musician Sur Das. His name occurs in Blochmann\u2019s list, p. 617, l. Of S\u0101mit and Tat\u0101r I find no mention. Some of these singers came from Mashhad, Tabriz, Kashmir, and from beyond the Oxus.\n\n\\(^{20}\\) By Willard, Zikri, a much more probable name, as they are on the subject of morality. This class of religious song was introduced into Hindustan by Qazi Mahmud. V. Willard\u2019s treatise on The Music of Hindustan,\nThe war songs and heroic chants called Karkha, they term S\u0101dara, and these consist also of four, six, and eight lines, and are sung in various dialects.\n\nBesides these that have been named, there are numerous other modes, amongst which are the following:\n\nS\u0101rang; Purbi; Dhan\u0101sri; R\u0101mkali; Kur\u0101i, (which His Majesty has styled Sughr\u0101i); Suha; Desak\u0101la and Desakha.\n\nThe third is called Prakirn\u0101dhy\u0101ya or a chapter of miscellaneous rules and treats of Al\u0101pa, which is of two kinds. (1). R\u0101g\u0101l\u0101pa, the development of the r\u0101ga, commonly termed (in Persian) ad\u0101 and tasarruf, and (2). Rup\u0101l\u0101pa: which comprises the metrical setting of the words to the air and their vocal expression. [P. 140]\n\nThe fourth, or Prabandh\u0101dhy\u0101ya, is on the art of composing a rhythmic measure (g\u012bta) to vocal music. It consists of six members, viz. (1). Svara, (notes as sa, ri, &c., taken at their proper pitch). (2). Viruda, panegyric. (3). Pada, name of its object. (4). Ten\u0101, a cadence of notes on a symbolic standard, as ten\u0101, ten\u0101, and the modulation of the lines. (5). P\u0101ta, the continuous imitation of sounds (proceeding from percussion instruments) as ten\u0101, ten\u0101, m\u0101n\u0101, &c., from three letters to twenty, in a specific order as a supplementary guiding measure. (6). T\u0101la, rhythm expressed by beat.\n\n---\n\n21 Probably to change the ominous name, Kur\u0101i, signifying stocks for the feet, and Sughr\u0101i, beauty or grace.\n\n22 Sir S. M. Tagore explains in his \"Six Principal R\u0101gas,\" that it is a practice with singers, before commencing a song to develop the character of the r\u0101ga by means of gamakas, and t\u0101nas. This is called al\u0101pa in which the notes peculiar to the r\u0101ga are sung as a prelude to show its character.\n\n23 Pada technically is a sentence formed of words having a meaning. Tena, meaningless words used by singers to exhibit the air alone, unaccompanied by words. The six members of the G\u012bta may be thus briefly exemplified:\u2014\n\n1st (Svara), sa, ga, ri, sa.\n2nd (Viruda), Thou art my God.\n3rd (Pada), I look to thee.\n4th (Tena), Ten\u0101, na, te, na.\n5th (P\u0101ta), Dha, Dhin, Kath, Thege.\n6th (T\u0101la), beats by hand at equal intervals.\nwhole six members be present, the composition (prabandha) is called medini; if one less, it is termed \u0101nandini; if two less, dipani; if three less, bh\u0101vani, and if four less, t\u0101r\u0101vali; but with only two it does not (commonly) occur.\n\nThese four adhy\u0101yas treat of the various refinements of melody.\n\nThe fifth is T\u0101l\u0101dhy\u0101ya, on the nature and quantity of the musical beats.\n\nThe sixth is V\u0101dy\u0101dhy\u0101ya, on the various musical instruments. These are of four kinds.\n\n(1). Tata, stringed instruments. (2). Vitata, instruments over which skin is stretched. (3). Ghana, all that gives resonance by the concussion of two solid bodies. (4). Sushira, wind instruments.\n\nThe First Kind, or Stringed Instruments.\n\nThe Yantra is formed of a hollow neck of wood a yard in length, at each end of which are attached the halves of two gourds. Above the neck are sixteen frets over which are strung five steel wires fastened securely at both ends. The low and high notes and their variations are produced by the disposition of the frets.\n\nThe Vin\u0101 (Hindi Bin) resembles the Yantra, but has three strings.\n\nThe Kinnar resembles the Vina, but with a longer fingerboard and has three gourds and two wires.\n\n---\n\n24 Sir S. M. Tagore makes t\u0101la synonymous with chhandas, or metre, and guiding its movement. The beat conforms to the variety of the metre, upon the rhythmic feet of which is based, as with the Greeks, their musical measure.\n\n25 Yantra (Hindi Jantra) signifies an instrument of any kind. I do not anywhere find mention of a particular musical instrument under this name.\n\n26 A coloured drawing of this instrument, as well as of the Vin\u0101 and most of those mentioned in the text, will be found in Capt. Day's superb volume, Music of Southern India. The plates, besides their utility as illustrations, are artistically beautiful and a description of the instrument accompanies each.\nThe Sar-vin\u0101 is also like the Vina but without frets.\n\n[141] The Amriti has the finger-board shorter than the Sar-vin\u0101, and a small gourd below the upper side, and one steel wire upon which all the scales may be played.\n\nThe Rab\u0101b\\(^{27}\\) has six strings of gut, but some have twelve and others eighteen.\n\nThe sarmandal\\(^{28}\\) is like the K\u0101nun. It has twenty-one strings, some of steel, some of brass, and some of gut.\n\nThe S\u0101rang\u012b is smaller than the Rab\u0101b and is played like the Ghichak.\\(^{29}\\)\n\nThe Pin\u0101k, called also Sur-bit\u0101na, is of wood about the length of a bow and slightly bent. A string of gut is fastened to it and a hollow cup inverted, is attached at either end. It is played like the Ghichak, but in the left hand a small gourd is held which is used in playing.\n\nThe Adhati has one gourd and two wires.\n\nThe Kingara resembles the Vina, but has two strings of gut and smaller gourds.\n\nThe Second Kind of Instruments.\n\nThe Pakh\u0101waj\\(^{30}\\) is made of a thick shell of wood shaped like a myrobalan and hollow. It is over a yard in length and if clasped round the middle, the fingers of the two hands will meet. The ends are a little larger in circumference than the\n\n---\n\n\\(^{27}\\) This name, if not the instrument, is of Arabian origin. Specimens of the Rab\u0101b, as well as of the k\u0101nun, the lute and other instruments are given in Lane's Modern Egyptians, Chap. XVIII.\n\n\\(^{28}\\) Capt. Day writes the name Sv\u0101ra-M\u0101ndala, and calls it the K\u0101nun or Indian Dulcimer, the strings of brass and steel, and occasionally gut, and played with two plectra worn on the finger-tips.\n\n\\(^{29}\\) This is a kind of Persian lute. A specimen of the S\u0101rang\u012b, or fiddle, will be found in Day.\n\n\\(^{30}\\) One of Capt. Day's plates represents this drum under the name of the Mridang by which it is best known in Southern India. The two heads are tuned to the tonic, and fourth or fifth. The centre of the smaller head is coated with a composition of resin, oil, and wax and an embroidered cloth is commonly stretched over the upper side of the shell as an ornament. It is beaten by the hands, finger-tips and wrists, and is well enough known throughout India.\nmouth of a pitcher and are covered with skin. It is furnished with leather braces which are strained, as in the nak\u0101ra or kettle-drum, and four pieces of wood, under a span in length, are inserted (between the shell and the braces) on the left side and serve to tune the instrument.\n\nThe Awaj is made of a hollow piece of wood, and might be described as two kettle-drums joined at the reverse ends and their heads covered with skin and braced with thongs.\n\nThe Duhul\\(^{31}\\) (drum) is well-known.\nThe Dhadda is like the Duhul but very small.\nThe Ardhaawaj is half the size of the Awaj.\nThe Daf, or tambourine, is well-known.\\(^{32}\\)\n\nThe Khanjari is a tambourine smaller than the Daf, but with cymbals, and its surface is about the size of a pitcher.\\(^{33}\\)\n\n**The Third Kind of Instruments.**\n\nThe T\u0101la is a pair of brass cymbals like cups with broad mouths.\n\nThe Kath T\u0101la, or castanets, are small and fish-shaped. The set consists of four pieces, of wood or stone.\n\n**The Fourth Kind of Instruments.**\n\n[142] The Shahn\u0101,\\(^{34}\\) called in Persian Surn\u0101.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{31}\\) This is the Persian equivalent of the ordinary Dhol of Hindustan.\n\n\\(^{32}\\) Capt. Day describes it as an octagonal frame of wood, about 6 inches deep and 3 feet in diameter, covered on one side with skin and strained by means of a network of thin leather thongs.

They are mostly from Gujar\u0101t and M\u0101lwah. [P. 143]\n\nThe Natwas exhibit some graceful dancing, and introduce various styles to which they sing.

The sixth in the Sanskrit original is really \u201csinging\u201d.\n[J. Sarkar.]\nwith these eighteen sources of crime. If they are unable to avoid them altogether, they should never transgress due measure in their regard. They say that a prince should be God-fearing, circumspect and just, compassionate and bountiful, recognising virtue and the distinctions of rank and merit. He should be courteous in speech, kindly in aspect and condescending in his manner. He should be ever ambitious of extending his dominions, and should protect his subjects from the exactions of revenue-officers, from thieves, robbers and other evil-doers. He should proportion the punishment to the offence and be firm of purpose and yet clement. His intelligencers should be appointed from among men of trust and sagacity. He should never despise his enemy nor be remiss in vigilance nor be proud of his wealth and power. He should not admit to his court venal and corrupt designers. A king resembles a gardener and should carry out, in regard to his subjects, the course pursued in the care of his garden by the other, who puts away thorns and weeds and keeps his flower-beds in good order, allowing no depredations from without. In the same way a prince should transfer to the frontier of his dominions the turbulence of the seditious, and free the courts of his palace from their machinations, and allow no other evil designers to enter them. The gardener, likewise, from time to time, prunes the redundancy of leaf and branch on his trees, so the king should isolate from each other the more powerful nobles whose friends and dependants are dangerously numerous. The gardener also invigorates his weak saplings with water, and the king should similarly sustain with beneficence his impoverished soldiery.\n\nThe king should choose a circumaspect person of exemplary piety, courteous in disposition, vigilant, zealous, and masterful, reading the signs of the times and divining the intentions of his lord, and ready of speech, and in consultation with him, provide for the spiritual and temporal affairs of his kingdom. But if he finds himself physically unable to carry\non these duties, he should entrust their complicated direction to him. In important affairs he should not consult with many advisers, because the qualifications necessary in such cases are fidelity, breadth of view, fortitude of spirit, and perspicacity, and the union of these four priceless virtues in any one man is uncommonly rare. Although some statesmen of former times consulted with men of a different stamp with the intention of acting directly contrary to their advice, in the majority of cases this course did not answer and many disasters were the consequence, for this special reason, that it is difficult to efface from the mind the suspicions aroused by the insinuations of cowardly, unprincipled, short-sighted and base men.\n\nFormer princes adopted the practice of selecting from four to eight intelligent counsellors with the qualifications above-mentioned, under the presidency of one of their number. The opinion of each of these was separately taken on matters concerning the welfare of the State and the revenues, after which they were assembled in consultation and their several opinions carefully weighed without disclosing the author.\n\nFurther, a prince is in need of a faithful attendant, a profound astrologer, and a skilful physician. His wide experience will enable him to surround himself with friends, to maintain a well-appointed force, and to fill his treasury. He will portion out his dominions and entrust them to just and circumspect governors, and unite them in a befitting co-operation of government. He is jealous in the construction and provision of his fortresses and careful in their maintenance.\n\nWith his equals in power he is on terms of amity and concord and exacts tribute from the weak. He sows dissensions in the armies of one more powerful than himself by skilful intrigue, or failing this, he conciliates him with presents. As long as possible he avoids hostilities with all, but when war is inevitable, he enters upon it with fearlessness and vigour and upholds his honour. He should consider a prince whose territories are conterminous with his own, as his\nenemy though he be profuse in demonstrations of friendship. With one whose country is situated next beyond, he should form an alliance. With a third more remote, he should avoid all intercourse whether hostile or friendly.\n\nAfter the above manner have statesmen laid down rules of government, suggesting approved modes of conduct and enforcing them with numerous happy illustrations, all of which are referrible to the qualities of wisdom, recognition of merit, bravery, good temper, reserve in speech, zeal, and benevolence.\n\n**Vyavahara**\n\nor\n\n**The Administration of Justice.**\n\nThe learned among the Hindus say that litigation in its various kinds falls under eighteen titles, for each of which there is a separate course of procedure, viz.\u2014(1). Non-payment of debt. (2). Deposits. (3). Sale without ownership. (4). Disputes in partnership. (5). Reclaiming a gift. (6). Disputes between master and servant regarding wages, under which head are included labourers and such as work for hire. (7). Default of revenue by the cultivator. (8). Recision of purchase between buyer and seller. (9). Mulcts on herdsmen. (10). Boundary disputes. (11). Slander. (12). Assault. (13). Theft. (14). Violence with bloodshed. (15). Adultery. (16). Altercation between man and wife. (17). Inheritance. (18). Gambling disputes.\n\n---\n\n38 For Hindu Law, Hastings Ency. vii. 850-853. iv. 283 (crimes). Abul Fazl's authority seems to be the Ordinances of Manu of which the 8th chapter deals with Civil and Criminal law. The eighteen titles are somewhat differently worded in Manu, and I give them for comparison. Non-payment of debt; pledges; sale without ownership; partnership and non-delivery of what has been given; non-payment of wages; breach of contract; revocation of sale (and) purchase; disputes between master and servant; disputes about boundaries; assault (and) slander; theft; violence; adultery; the law between man and woman; partition; dicing; games with animals.\"\nThe king in his judicial character must erect his tribunal facing the east. He must conduct the duties of his office in person, and if he cannot always himself attend to them, he must delegate his authority to a wise, fearless and painstaking deputy. [P. 147]\n\nThe plaintiff is termed V\u0101din and the defendant Prativ\u0101din. A child under twelve years of age may not be summoned to court, nor one who is drunk; nor one crazy, nor one who is sick or engaged in the service of the State, nor a woman without relations, or of high family, or who has recently given birth to a child. A discreet person should be commissioned to interrogate in such cases, or they should be brought into the royal presence.\n\nThe plaintiff's statement is taken down in writing, with the date of the year, month, and day, and the names of the two parties and their ancestors for three descents, and many other particulars. The reply of the defendant is then recorded and both their statements are carefully investigated. The plaintiff is then asked for any documentary evidence and for his witnesses. These should not be fewer than four, though some allow only three, and even one is considered sufficient if he be a person of known veracity.\n\nA child under five may not serve as a witness, nor a man broken down with age. The evidence of a Sudra is only available for a Sudra, and that of a handicraftsman for one of his own trade. The evidence of a blind man may not be taken, nor of one who is deaf, or diseased, or drunk, or crazy, nor a gambler, nor of a notorious evil-liver, nor of one oppressed by hunger and thirst, nor of an angry man, nor of a thief, nor of one who is being taken to execution. For women, women should serve as witnesses. A friend may not witness for a friend, nor an enemy against an enemy, nor partners for each other. In all oral litigation, dryness of the lips, and biting them, and licking the sides of the mouth,\nalteration of voice and change of colour, should be taken into consideration as collateral proof.\n\nIn all suits these conditions of evidence are imperative except under titles eleven to fourteen.\n\nIf there be no documentary evidence or witnesses, the judge must decide to the best of his ability, with caution and prudence; but if he cannot discover the facts of the case, he must cause the plaintiff or, as some say, either of the two parties, as he thinks best, to undergo the ordeal.\\(^{39}\\) This is of eight kinds.\n\nThe first kind. The man is weighed and taken out of the scales, and after some prayers and incantations, he is again weighed. If his scale rises, his claim is allowed, but an even balance or his scale preponderating, are proofs of its falsehood. Some authorities say that the balance is never even. This ordeal is only for Br\u0101hmans.\n\nThe second kind. Seven or nine circles are drawn with a distance of sixteen fingers' breadth between each periphery. The person is then bathed and religious ceremonies and incantations, as above described, are gone through. His two hands are then rubbed over with rice-bran, and seven green leaves of the pipal-tree (Ficus religiosa) are placed upon them and bound round seven times with raw silk. A piece of iron, weighing \\(3\\frac{1}{3}\\) sers and heated red-hot, is then placed upon the leaves which, thus heated, he carries and advances taking one step between each circle, till, on arriving at the last, he throws the iron down. If there is no sign of a burn, his word is accepted. If the iron fall from his hands mid-way, he must begin again.\n\nThe third kind. The person is made to stand in water up to his naval and dips under with his face to the east. Then,\n\n\\(^{39}\\) The word used in the text is oath, a translation of the Sanskrit sapatha, which means also ordeal. It is an asseveration by imprecating curses on the head of the taker of the oath. In this case, ordeal is evidently the true signification.\nfrom a bow measuring 106 fingers breadth, a reed arrow without an iron point, is shot off so that it shall fly with the wind and a fast runner is sent to fetch it. If he can keep under water from the time the shaft is loosed till the runner returns with it, his cause is declared just. This ordeal is especially for the Vaisya caste. [P. 148]\n\nThe fourth kind. Seven barley corns of a deadly poison are administered in the spring season (Vasanta), or five in the heats (Grishma), or four in the rains (Varsha), six in the autumn (Sarad), and seven in the winter (Haimanta). These are to be mixed with thirty-three times the quantity of clarified butter and given to the man after certain incantations. The face of the patient must be towards the south, and the person who administers must face the east or north. If during a period in which the hands may be clapped 500 times, the poison does not take effect, his truth is proved. Antidotes are then given to him to prevent any fatal effects. This ordeal is peculiar to the Sudra caste.\n\nThe fifth kind. An idol is first washed, and after worship is paid to it, incantations are pronounced over the water it was washed with, and three mouthfuls of it are given to the person under ordeal. If no misfortune happens to him within a fortnight, the justness of his cause is acknowledged.\n\nThe sixth kind. Rice of the class called S\u0101thi\u2074\u2070 is placed in an earthen vessel and kept all night. Incantations are next morning pronounced over it, and the person is made to eat it while facing the east. He is then required to spit upon a leaf of the pipal (Ficus religiosa), or the bhojpatra (Betula bhojpatra). If there should be any marks of blood, or the corners of the mouth swell, or symptoms of ague supervene, the untruth of his case is inferred.\n\nThe seventh kind. An earthen or stone vessel is taken, measuring sixteen fingers in length and breadth, and four\n\n\u2074\u2070 Produced in the rains, and so called because it ripens in 60 days from the time of sowing.\nfingers deep. Into this forty d\u0101ms weight of clarified butter or sesame-oil is poured and brought to boiling point, and one m\u0101sha of gold, which is equal to four surkhs, is thrown into the boiling-oil. If the person can take out the gold with two fingers without being scalded, his cause is just.\n\nThe eighth kind. A symbol of Dharma, or Innocence, is fashioned of silver, and one of Adharma, or Guilt, of lead or iron; or the former word is written on a piece of a white cloth, or a leaf of the bhoj tree, and the latter on a piece of black cloth, and these are put into a jar which has never held water. The person under ordeal is then told to draw out one of these. If the symbol of innocence is drawn out, his cause is just. This ordeal is applicable in determining the righteousness of all four castes.\n\nIf a suit cannot be decided in one day, bail is taken; and a second suit may not be brought against the same person till the first is disposed of. When a claim is proved, the plaintiff is put in possession, and a fine of an amount equal to the value of the suit is exacted of the defendant. If the plaintiff loses his cause, he pays double the value of the suit.\n\nHaving cursorily explained the procedure regarding suits, evidence and ordeal, I now as briefly record the mode of adjudication under the eighteen titles of law-suits.\n\n1. Non-payment of debt. If the debt be without deposit and the dispute be regarding the amount of interest, a Br\u0101hman shall pay two per cent. (per mensem), a Kshatriya three, a Vaisya four, and a Sudra five per cent. If there be security, only one-fourth of the above amounts are recoverable though a higher rate may have been agreed to. For risks by land-travel, up to ten per cent. is allowed, and not exceeding twenty-five per cent. for risks at sea. If interest has been agreed upon, and ten times the length of the stipulated period has elapsed, a claim shall not be allowed for [149] more\nthan double the principal.\\textsuperscript{41} When the interest is paid on corn, the sum of the interest and principal should not be more than five times the principal. If the debtor is unable to pay, he must renew the obligation bringing the instrument\\textsuperscript{42} and witnesses for its verification.\n\n2. Deposits. If the receiver of a deposit make use of it without the owner's permission and delay its restoration when claimed, he shall forego half the interest due (in compensation). If he deny the deposit and there be no documentary evidence or witnesses, the judge may privately direct a third person to make a deposit with the same man and after some time to demand it back. If he acts as before, he shall be compelled to satisfy the first claim, or submit to trial by ordeal; but if the pledge be stolen by a thief, or if it be burnt, or washed away by water, or plundered by an enemy, restitution shall not be made. If he has dealt fraudulently with it, he shall make restitution and pay a similar amount as a fine.\n\n3. Sale without ownership. If a man claim possession of property, it shall be restored to him free on proof of ownership, and the money taken back from the seller. And if it be sold privately or under its value, or by a person not entitled to do so, the judge shall fine the offender as he thinks proper. And if he brings forward the thief,\\textsuperscript{43} it shall not be imputed\n\n\\textsuperscript{41} That is, the sum of interest plus principal must not exceed twice the original debt. According to Manu, five times the principal is payable on corn, fruit, wool and draught animals.\n\n\\textsuperscript{42} It is worth while noticing that the Sanskrit for this term \\textit{karanam} is translated by Hopkins 'proof', while stating in a note that the meaning 'document' given by commentators is not necessary and seems improbable. Yet this is exactly the translation of Abul Fazl, the word 'Sanad' employed by him signifying document or instrument.\n\n\\textsuperscript{43} Or \"if he appear a thief.\" The elliptical language of the text can be understood only by comparison with the text of Manu: verses 197-198 run as follows:\u2014(197.) \"If a man not being himself the owner, sells the property of another without the owner's permission, one should not allow him to be a witness, (since he is) a thief (although) he may not think he is a thief.\nas the crime of a thief, but a fine shall be exacted from him as a thief.\n\n4. Partnership. If there be a dispute between partners and any formal deed of partnership exist and be proved, it shall be carried out in accordance with its terms; otherwise the profit and loss shall be divided according to the proportions of capital invested. If one of the partners dissipate the joint property or, without the consent of the other, remove it or otherwise fraudulently deal with it, he shall make it good to the other by a fine. Or if on the other hand, he make a profit, he shall not be required to give more than one-tenth to his partner. If one of them is guilty of fraud, he shall be ejected from partnership and the interest due to him shall be exacted by the judge. If one of the partners be left in charge of the joint property and any deficiency or injury occurs through his neglect, he shall make it good.\n\n5. Reclaiming a gift. If a gift is made under the influence of anger, sickness, grief, fear, or as a bribe, or in jest, it may be recalled: also what has been given by a child, or a drunken or crazy man. In other cases it may not be reclaimed. And if the gift be made for a future benefit or in exchange, it may not, under any pretence, be resumed.\n\n6. Wages, Hire, Rent. If wages, hire, or rent be received in advance, the agreement may not be violated. If it be broken, the offender shall be fined to the amount of double the sum; but if the money has not been actually paid, the fine shall extend only to the amount originally fixed. If a servant loses his master's property, he must make good the equivalent, but if it be taken from him by violence, he is not liable to restitution.\n\n7. Revenue. If any one fail to pay the usual revenue,\n\n(198.) He should be held to a fine of 600 panas if he is a near relation: if he is not a near relation and has no excuse, he would incur the fine of a thief.\"\nthe whole of his effects shall be confiscated, and he shall be expelled the country.\n\n8. Purchase and sale. A purchaser may on the day of purchase return the goods bought; on the second day he may return them on a forfeit of a twentieth of their cost: on the third day, of a tenth, after which they cannot be sent back. But a maid-servant may be sent back within one month; a slave, within fifteen days; corn, within ten days; jewels, within seven days; cattle in general, within five days; a milch-cow, within three days; iron, within one day; unless there be any stipulation to the contrary. The same conditions hold good with the seller, but he must sustain the loss in the same proportion as the excess payments of the purchaser in the opposite case.\n\n[150] 9. Herdsmen. If through the neglect of a herdsman a beast is lost or dies or is injured, he must make good the loss. If cattle eat a grain-crop near a village or city, the herdsmen is not amenable to fine. Sown-fields should be distant from a small village four hundred cubits; from one of moderate size, eight hundred, and from a large settlement, sixteen hundred cubits. If the trespass should occur through the neglect of the keeper, he must pay the value of the crop destroyed, otherwise the owner of the cattle is responsible. For a buffalo, a camel or donkey the fine is seven m\u0101shas of silver: for an ox, half the above: for a sheep or goat, half the fine for an ox. If the beast lies down to eat, the fine is doubled. An elephant, a horse, as well as cattle set at liberty as an act of piety, (it being the custom, eleven days after the death of a Br\u0101hman, thirteen days after the death\n\n---\n\n44 \"Round about every village there should be a strip of land one hundred bows or even three casts of a staff in width: around a city, it should be three times as wide.\" Manu. VIII, 237. This land is intended for a common and not to be tilled. The staff is picked up after the first cast, and again as it falls, and so on three times. The strength of the cast might fitly be that of Polypoetes. Iliad, XXIII, 845.\nof a Kshatriya, sixteen after that of a Vaisya, and thirty after the death of a Sudra, to let loose eight or four bulls, or one bull with a number of cows after branding them in a special manner) or a cow that has lately calved, or animals that have strayed, or not amenable to fine if they damage the crops. The same rule applies to royal preserves as to crops.\n\n10. Boundaries. Disputes regarding boundaries may be adjudicated at any season save during the rains.\\textsuperscript{45} The owners of land define their boundaries by burying charcoal, stones, potsherds, hair, bones, and the like that do not perish even after a long time; and sometimes a tree is made the boundary. The judge determines the dispute on the production of such evidence, and the witness of four, eight, or ten husbandmen, keepers,\\textsuperscript{46} or hunters.\n\nThe witnesses shall wear red garments, place earth upon their heads and wear a string of red flowers round their necks, and shall swear that their good deeds may lose all merit if they lie. If there be no witnesses nor boundary mark, the judgment of the king shall determine the line.\n\n11. Slander. This is of three kinds, viz.\u2014(1). Reviling another to his face. (2). By insinuation and suggestion. (3). Reviling his mother, sister, or such other improper language. For the first two, if the abuse be from one of inferior towards one of a superior caste the fine is twelve-and-a-half d\u0101ms; to an equal, half that sum; towards an inferior, one-fourth. For the third kind, the fine is twenty-five d\u0101ms, if between equals, or if a Br\u0101hman reviles a Kshatriya; but fifty,\n\n\\textsuperscript{45} If a dispute has arisen between two villages in regard to a boundary, the king should determine the boundary in the month of Jyai\u1e63\u1e6dha (middle of May to middle of June) as the boundary marks are then very plain.\" Manu, viii. 245.\n\n\\textsuperscript{46} The men named by Manu are hunters, bird-catchers, cowherds, fishermen, root-diggers, snake-catchers, gleaners, and other men who wander about the woods. The text has sip\u0101h\u0101n (which Jarrett trans. as keepers), a misprint for p\u0101sb\u0101n\u0101n or watchmen. [J. S.]\nif the abuse is from a Kshatriya to a Br\u0101hman. If a Vaisya reviles a Br\u0101hman he is fined seventy-five d\u0101ms, but in the opposite case the fine is twelve-and-a-half. If a Sudra thus offends against a Br\u0101hman, he is fined one hundred d\u0101ms, a Br\u0101hman reviling a Sudra pays six-and-a-quarter. A Vaisya reviling a Kshatriya pays fifty, and the fine in the opposite case is twelve-and-a-half; and the same proportion between a Vaisya and a Sudra. If one of the gods be reviled, or the king, or a Br\u0101hman who has read the four Vedas, the fine is 540 d\u0101ms. If the abuse be directed against the people of a quarter, half of the above; and one-fourth if against the inhabitants of the city.\n\n12. Assault. This is of four kinds: (1) Throwing earth, clay or filth upon any one. (2) Putting him in bodily fear by threatening him with the fist, a stick, or other weapon. (3) Striking with the hands or feet and the like. (4) Wounding with any weapon.\n\nThe first kind. In the first case, the fine is five d\u0101ms, but if filth is thrown, ten, provided the parties are equals; but twice as much if it be an inferior against a superior, and only half in the opposite cases.\n\nThe second kind. Threatening with the hand, etc., five d\u0101ms, and (with stick or other weapon) between equals, eleven; between superiors and inferiors, as above.\n\n[151] The third kind. If the blow cause a swelling or pain in the limb, 270 d\u0101ms. If by an inferior against a superior, the hand or foot, or other offending member be cut off, or a suitable fine inflicted. In the instance of a Kshatriya against a Br\u0101hman, the fine is 540 d\u0101ms; a Vaisya against a Br\u0101hman, 1,080; a Sudra against a Br\u0101hman, 2,160, a Vaisya against a Kshatriya or a Sudra against a Vaisya 540; a Sudra against a Kshatriya, 1,080; a Br\u0101hman against a Kshatriya, 135; or against a Vaisya, 67\u00bd; or against a Sudra, 33\u00be; a Kshatriya against a Vaisya, 135; against a Sudra 67\u00bd.\nThe fourth kind. Between those of like caste if the skin be abraded, fifty d\u0101ms, and if the flesh is cut, twenty tolahs of gold, and if a bone be broken, the offender is banished. If an inferior against a higher caste, the fine is doubled, and in the opposite case, it shall be a-half. If treatment is necessary, the offender shall pay the expenses of medicine and daily 'keep' till the injured man be restored to health.\n\nIn the case of a sheep, antelope\\(^4\\) and the like, if there be hurt, the fine is eight d\u0101ms; if it be rendered useless, the value must be paid to the owner, with a fine of 125 d\u0101ms; and twice as much, if it be killed. For a horse, camel, or ox, the fine is also double. When damage is done to valuable plants, the value must be paid to the owner and a fine of ten d\u0101ms, but eight d\u0101ms if they be of small value.\n\n13. Theft. If any one steal above one hundred tolahs of gold or silver or any valuables up to this amount, or more than \\(66\\frac{2}{3}\\) mans of corn, or the child or the wife of any person of distinction, he shall be liable to the punishment of death. If the amount be less than one hundred and more than fifty tolahs, he shall suffer the loss of his hand. If fifty or less, he shall pay eleven times the amount as a fine. The same applies to corn. In all cases the equivalent of the amount stolen shall be made good to the owner, and if the thief is unable to pay, he shall work out the amount in menial service. In other cases of theft, corporal punishment, imprisonment or fine, is at the discretion of the judge.\n\n14. Violence with bloodshed. If a man of inferior caste kill a man of a higher caste, the penalty is death. If a Br\u0101hman slay a Br\u0101hman, his entire estate shall be confiscated, his head shaved, his forehead branded and he shall be banished from the kingdom. If a Br\u0101hman slay a Kshatriya, he shall pay a fine of 1,000 cows and a bull; if he slay a Vaisya, 100 cows\n\n\\(^4\\) Different sorts of antelopes and deer, flamingoes and parrots, are \"propitious\" forest animals, and a fine imposed for killing them: also the small animals, such as crows, cats, etc.\nand a bull, or if a Sudra, 10 cows and a bull. The same rule applies to Kshatriyas and Vaisyas. If a Sudra slay a Sudra, he shall be fined 500 cows and a bull. If the murderer be not found, the people of the city, village, or quarter in which the murder was committed shall produce some of his family or pay in default any fine that the king may inflict.\n\n15. Adultery. Commerce between a woman and a man other than her husband, is of three kinds: (1) When they converse and jest together in private. (2) When a present is sent to the house of the other. (3) When they meet and criminal intercourse ensues. In the second case, a fine may be inflicted at the discretion of the king. The third is of two kinds, viz., with a maiden and one who is not a maiden. The former may be dishonoured . . . . The latter may be women who are guarded, or such as gad abroad. In each of these four cases it may occur with the woman's consent or otherwise, and of these eight, the criminality may take place between two of a like caste. In the latter instance if it be a girl and she consent in all these offences, and no force is offered on one side or resistance on the other, the man shall be compelled to marry her whether he will or no. In the case of pollution and the like, he must pay a fine of 200 d\u0101ms. If he violate her without her consent, he shall be put to death, but the woman is not liable to punishment. If he forcibly pollute her, he must suffer the loss of his fingers, and pay a fine of 600 d\u0101ms. If the offender be a Br\u0101hman, he shall be banished, but no other penalty is exacted. If the man be of higher caste, he shall be made to take her in marriage, even if he be unwilling, in which case an additional fine is imposed. If she be not a maiden, and both be of like caste, and she be guarded, and give her consent, the man is fined 270 d\u0101ms, but if without\n\n48 Hopkins translates 'wandering women' (Manu. VIII. 363), and supposes them to be possibly Buddhistic nuns. Sir W. Jones interprets 'female anchorets of an heretical religion'. Abul Fazl's rendering is kucha gard, gadding, about the streets.\n\n49 Under the protection of her husband or other male relative.\nher consent, the fine shall be 540 d\u0101ms. If she be one used to gad abroad and consents, the fine is 250 d\u0101ms; if forced, 500. If the man be of higher caste, the fine in all cases shall be 250 d\u0101ms; if of inferior caste, death is the penalty in every instance, and the ears and nose of the woman shall be cut off.\n\n16. Altercation between man and wife. If after marriage a man discovers any natural defect in his wife, he may put her away without remedy on her part, but the woman's father shall be fined. If a man offer one daughter in marriage and substitute another in her place, he shall be compelled to give both. When a man has journeyed on a pilgrimage to holy shrines and is absent beyond the term agreed upon, the wife shall wait at home for eight years whatever her position in life may be.\\(^{50}\\) If he has gone abroad for the sake of knowledge or fame or wealth, she shall wait six years: if he journeys to seek another wife, three years. At the expiration of these periods, she is at liberty to leave her husband's house to obtain a livelihood. The husband on his return from abroad, if he wishes to put her away on account of her departure, is not permitted to do so. If the wife does not observe the condition of these periods, the husband is at liberty to put her away. If the husband fall sick and the wife does not minister to him, he may not, on his recovery, for this cause divorce her, but he may refuse intercourse with her for three months and deprive her of all that she possesses, after which period he shall be reconciled to her. With Br\u0101hmans, divorce does not take place but a husband may avoid the sight and presence of his wife: her maintenance must nevertheless be continued. The wife may not take another husband. If he be guilty of great crimes or have any contagious disease, the wife is at liberty to separate from him. If a Br\u0101hman have a wife of\n\n\\(^{50}\\) One commentator's opinion is, that, after the eight years she must follow him. Another states that she may marry another husband. The former opinion, says Hopkins, rests on a later view of second marriages.\neach of the four castes, he shall assign them their respective social functions. In religious ceremonies, and personal attendance such as anointing with oil and adorning\\textsuperscript{51} him and similar duties, he must employ only his own caste.\n\n17. \\textit{Inheritance}. While a son lives, no other relation or kinsman shares the estate except the wife who is equal to the son. If there be neither son nor wife, the unmarried daughter inherits. If there be also no daughter, the mother is the heir. [P. 153]\n\nIf there be no mother, the father takes possession.\n\nIf there be no father alive, his brother shall be heir.\n\nIn default of a brother, the brother\u2019s son inherits.\n\nIn default of a brother\u2019s son, the estate is divided amongst the surviving kindred.\n\nIf he leave no relations, the teacher inherits, or in default of the teacher, his fellow pupils.\n\nIn the absence of all these the estate lapses to the Crown.\n\n18. \\textit{Gambling}. Whosoever plays with false dice shall be banished. If he refuse to pay his stake, it shall be taken from him, and of his winnings, the king shall receive one-tenth, and one-twentieth shall be taken for dues.\\textsuperscript{52}\n\nTo each of these eighteen titles there are many illustrations, and conflicting opinions are recorded. I content myself with this short exposition.\n\n\\textsuperscript{51} The duties of a Br\u0101hman\u2019s wife are to give food to beggar guests, and attend to her part of the sacrificial preparations. She bathes and adorns her husband, cleans his teeth and anoints him; and since she holds the highest rank she gives him his food, drink, wreaths, clothes and ornaments.\n\n\\textsuperscript{52} I presume the reading is questionable. It probably refers to a licence for the tables, or permission to play. For Hindu gambling rules, Hastings, Ency. iv. 284.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE FOUR PERIODS OF RELIGIOUS LIFE.\n\nHaving reviewed the various branches of learning in their scientific aspects, I proceed to some account of their practical modes of life.\n\nAmong the Br\u0101hmans, the period of individual life, after the intelligence is to some degree matured, is divided into four portions, to each of which is assigned its special important duties. These periods severally receive the name of \u0100\u015brama.\u00b9\n\nThe First Period is the Brahma-charya, or religious studentship. Investiture with the sacred thread is regarded by the Br\u0101hmans as the first principle of their creed, and the three superior castes do not acknowledge the right of due membership without it. With a Br\u0101hman it must be made in the eighth year, or if this auspicious time is suffered to elapse, it may be performed up to sixteen years of age. A Kshatriya may be invested between eleven and twenty-two years of age, and a Vaisya from twelve to twenty-four, but a Sudra is not considered a fitting recipient. It is imperative that the investiture should take place for each caste within the prescribed periods from which date the initiation is reckoned, otherwise there is exclusion from caste. The Br\u0101hman receives the sacred string from his father or teacher, and the two other castes from a Br\u0101hman. None but a Br\u0101hman may twist the string, and that which he wears for the first time must be twisted by his father or teacher or by himself. The teacher\u2019s son has also the same privilege. Three strands, in length ninety-six times the circumference of the fist, are united and twisted, making a twist of nine strands. This is again folded into three without twisting and secured\n\n\u00b9 For \u0100\u015bramas, Hastings Encyclo. ii. 128-131 (by Deussen) and details about the duties in each stage of life, Wilson\u2019s Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Ch. ix\u2014xii and Manu Samhit\u0101.\nby a knot at each end. This is the sacred thread. It is placed on the left shoulder and carried across the body to the right side, and thus the length is from the shoulder to the thumb of the right side, and thus the length is from the shoulder to the thumb of the right hand. It is worn diagonally like a belt. A Br\u0101hman wears five together, the other two castes, but three. Some authorities say that a cotton thread is for the special use of the Br\u0101hman, woollen for the Kshatriya and hempen thread for the Vaisya. Similarly, a thong of deerskin, three fingers in breadth, is worn with it but not of the same length. A Br\u0101hman [154] uses the skin of the black antelope; a Kshatriya the skin of any other kind of deer, and a Vaisya of a goat. At this period they also wear round the waist a girdle of a particular kind of grass called in Sanskrit Munja (Saccharum Munja).\n\nHe next learns the g\u0101yatri, which are certain words in praise of the sun, resembling the kalimah or profession of faith in Isl\u0101m. He also receives a staff of pal\u0101sa wood (Butea frondosa), but for the other two castes it is made of some other wood.\n\nHe leaves his father's house and chooses a lodging near his teacher, learns his letters and begins reading the Vedas. He first reads that Veda which it is his special duty to learn, and then the remaining three. They relate that when the sage Vy\u0101sa divided the Vedas into four parts, he instructed one of his pupils in each, from which time the descendants and the pupils of these respectively read their own Veda first. The Vedas are never read during the first degree of the moon's\n\n---\n\n2 The G\u0101yatri verse is taken from the Rig Veda III. 62, and is repeated by every Br\u0101hman at his morning and evening devotions. From being addressed to the sun (Savita) as generator, it is also called S\u0101vitr\u012b. The verse runs:\n\n```\n\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0927\u0940\u092e\u0939\u093f \u092c\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u094b\u093d\u092f\u0902 \u0928\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091a\u094b\u0926\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0964\u0964\n```\n\n\"Of the god-like sun this surpassing radiance we contemplate which excites to action our intelligence.\"\ncourse (pariwa), nor during the eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, or thirtieth, nor on the night of the fourth, eighth, or fourteenth, nor during an eclipse of the sun, but any of the other acts may be performed at those times.\n\nWhen a Br\u0101hman goes to relieve the necessities of nature, he hangs the sacred thread upon his right ear, and on such an occasion by day, turns his face to the north and by night to the south. He washes himself five times, each time first mixing the water with earth, and then washes the left hand ten times in the same manner, and next both hands seven times, and lastly both his feet in the same way. After he urines, he washes the part as above described and the left hand three times and each hand and foot once. From the day of his investiture till sixteen years of age, this number of purifications must be observed and doubled after he exceeds that age. Next, in a chosen spot, he should sit down on his haunches facing the east or north, keeping his knees erect and with his hand between them should drink three fills of his palm. A Br\u0101hman should swallow as much water as will reach his chest; a Kshatriya as much as will suffice to reach his throat; a Vaisya, as far as the root of his tongue. A Sudra may drink but once. He then uses a tooth stick (misw\u0101k) twelve fingers breadth in length, taking a fresh one every day.\n\nHe may not wear more than four coverings for his person. These are: (1) Langoti, or waist-cloth, which is worn to cover only two parts of his body. (2) A small lung worn above the other. (3) A sheet without suture, over his shoulders. (4) A small cap for his head. He should bathe before sunrise, wearing only the sacred thread, the girdle of munja, and the langoti. He first takes up a little water in his right hand, saying: \"I pray that any fault I have committed may be put\n\n---\n\n5 This is a cloth worn round the loins and passed between the legs and tucked in behind. It differs from the langoti in reaching to the knees.\naway from me.\" After which he throws the water away. With this intention his ablutions are entered upon. Then he rubs himself all over with earth, and if he be in a river, he dips three times, otherwise, he pours water over himself thrice and rubs his body all over with his hands. He then pronounces the name of God, and taking water three times in [P. 155] the hollow of his hand sips a little and begins to repeat certain prayers, at the conclusion of which he continues sprinkling water upon his head. He next closes his nostrils with two fingers and dashing water over his face, repeats other prayers and dips or throws water over himself thrice. Then wetting both his hands, he sprinkles his forehead, chest and both shoulders seven times, and taking up water with joined hands, casts it towards the sun eight times, repeating special prayers, and sips some water thrice. He next performs the pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma as described in the section on the P\u0101tanjala system. The ablutions are meritorious in degree according to their performance in the following order\u2014in a river, a tank, a well, or a house. He then clothes himself. If he be a follower of R\u0101ma, he marks his forehead horizontally with ashes; if of Krishna, he draws the sectarian mark in twelve places, viz., on his forehead, his breast, his navel, the right and left sides thereof, his right and left shoulders, the two lobes of his ears, his loins, the crown of his head and the throat. The clay of the Ganges is considered the most efficacious for this purpose but saffron and the like are also used. A Sudra marks his forehead with only a circle. After this he takes his staff and slings across his shoulders the deer-skin and occupies himself with the Sandhy\u0101, which consists of certain religious exercises, sprinkling and sipping water, and the like.4 Next comes the lighting of the fire and certain burnt offerings are made which is called the Homa sacrifice.\n\n4 These rites are performed at morning, mid-day, and evening.\nWhen these ceremonies are concluded, he goes to his teacher and gains merit by waiting upon him and reading the Vedas. At midday, the ablution and the ceremonies aforesaid are repeated with some variation and some increase in their number. When these are over he sets out begging alms and solicits from three, five, or seven houses, but avoids a Sudra. After cooking a sufficient meal he carries it to his teacher and with his permission, eats it. He precedes his meal with prayers and a few ceremonies and eats in silence and then repeats other prayers. When it is near dusk, he again performs the Sandhy\u0101 and Homa rites and occupies himself with reading. After a watch of the night has elapsed, he sleeps upon the ground, making his couch of straw or a tiger's skin or deer-skin or the like. He should avoid honey, betel-leaf, and perfumes. He should shave his head, keeping a tuft only, but the hair of the other parts of the body should be suffered to grow. He should not use collyrium nor anoint himself with oil, and should abstain from singing, dancing and gaming. He should not kill any animal nor have any commerce with women nor eat of anything not tasted first by his teacher. He should abstain from falsehood, anger, avarice and envy, and not defile his tongue by speaking ill of anyone though he deserve it, and make his days meritorious by practices of piety. In prayer he should turn to the east or north and he should not look towards the sun in its rising or setting. Some pass forty-eight years in the Brahmacharya stage, allowing twelve years for the study of each Veda. Some take only five years, and others till the Vedas are learnt. Others again spend their lives in this manner and undergo austerities in the hope of final liberation.\n\n[156] The Second Period is the G\u0101rhashthya, or a state in which the duties of a householder are observed and the person so engaged is called Grihastha. When the Brahmac\u0101rin has completed his studies, if he feels called to the religious life and his heart is estranged from the world, nothing\ncan more conduce to his welfare than the endeavour to attain eternal bliss, but if he has no such vocation, he should seek the consent of his teacher and, having obtained permission, return to his father's house. He then puts away all but his sacred thread, but continues the oblations and some other ceremonies, the number of the oblations being the same as during his period of pupilage as Brahmac\u0101rin. If he be a Br\u0101hman, he wears a turban, and a sheet eight cubits in length and two in breadth is put on in the fashion of a loincloth, one end being passed between his legs and fastened behind to the waist-piece, and the other end brought forward and tied similarly in front. Another sheet, five cubits long and two broad, is worn over the shoulders, and this may have a suture. A householder of other castes wears different garments. He now marries in the manner that shall be presently described.\n\nThe householder repeats certain prayers and thus performs the Homa sacrifice. He takes in his hand a stick of pipal or pal\u0101s wood, a span in length and burns it in the Homa fire. Another stick of the same kind is taken and passed into the fire and reserved, and when the next Homa takes place, this stick is burnt and another like the first is scorched and reserved, and this is continued till the time of the Agni-hotra. This is a special kind of Homa or oblation. A pipal stick is set alight by means of two other sticks and a cord forcibly worked by the hand, and the fire is placed in three round earthen vessels. The figure of a tortoise is then made of a ser and-a-quarter of rice-flour, and the three portions are cooked in one lump and dressed with oil, and part of this is thrown into the three fires as an oblation to the deities, and the remainder is given to Br\u0101hmans. One of the three portions of the sacrificial fire is reserved, and throughout his whole life,\n\n---\n\n5 This is a Vedic oblation to Agni, chiefly of milk, oil and sour gruel; there are two kinds, nitya, or of constant obligation, and k\u0101my\u0101, or optional.\nthe daily *Homa* oblation is made with that fire; the oblations cast into the fire in the name of the deities consist of any barley, rice, clarified butter, milk, wheat, that may be available, and once every fifteen days in the first degree of the moon's course he carries out the ceremony as before. The ceremony of the *Agni-hotra* may not take place till the period has elapsed between the fourth day after his marriage and that on which the bride leaves her father's house (to join her husband). With the exception of the Sudra and the *Mlechchha*, the rest of the people come generally under this second denomination.\n\nFour *gharis* before day-break, the householder awakes and passes some little time on his bed in prayer. He divides his day into eight portions, thus profitably employing his time.\n\nFirst, when the rays of the sun appear, he refreshes his sight with its lustre, and next by looking upon fire, water, gold, a just prince, a Br\u0101hman, a cow, and clarified butter. If none of these eight be present, he must look upon the palms of his hands, and proceed to wash his mouth and perform the *Sandhy\u0101* ceremonies. The second portion of his time he must employ in study and occupy himself in the interpretation of the Vedas [P. 157] and other branches of knowledge. The third he spends in attendance on his prince, and engages in state affairs. The fourth is occupied with his own household. The fifth, which is about the entry of noon, he spends in ablutions and the *Sandhy\u0101* ceremonies, and taking up water in both hands, offers it to the deities, the great *Rishis* and (the manes of) his ancestors, and repeats certain prayers. This libation is called *tarpana*. During the sixth, he prays to Vishnu, Mah\u0101deva, the Sun, Durga, and Ganesa. This is called *Deva-puja*, or worship of the gods, as will be more fully described hereafter. In the seventh,\n\n---\n\n*This is the true interpretation of the sentence, as I learn from a Br\u0101hman pandit. Abul Fazl's language is terse to obscurity without a knowledge of the subjects he treats of. The Agni-hotra ceremony cannot be performed till after marriage, and the presence of the wife is a necessary part of it.*\nhe casts into the fire some of his food as an offering to the gods, and makes the *Homa* sacrifice. Next follows the *Atithi-puja* (or the religious reception of a guest). He waits expectantly for any hungry person, and when he meets him, treats him with respect and satisfies his need, after which he himself eats, and this act is called the *Vaisvadeva-puja* (or offering to all deities). A Br\u0101hma\u1e47a obtains his food in the following way. When the husbandman has reaped his field and the poor have gleaned their fill, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a then follows in quest, and takes what he can find, and if he does not feel content with this, he may receive from his own people; and if this is insufficient, he may accept whatever is given to him without solicitation by another Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya. If this is not his choice, he may beg; and if he will not submit to this, he may cultivate land. Trade is considered more objectionable. A Br\u0101hma\u1e47a should not keep more than twelve days' supply of food, but to others an abundance is permitted, as has been explained. In the eighth, he listens to the recital of the lives of former holy men and performs the ceremonies of the *Homa* and *Sandhy\u0101*. If he is hungry, he takes his meal. He then occupies himself till the first watch of the night, in studying works of philosophy and reading the lives of ancient sages, after which he goes to rest. Such are the means by which he profitably employs his day and night. Other ceremonies performed during times of eclipse and festivals, are numerous. Those practised by the Kshatriyas and Vaisyas who follow their special occupations, are fewer as shall be presently described.\n\nThe third period is that of the *V\u0101naprastha* or anchorite, a name given also to the person so engaged. This is forbidden to a Sudra.\n\nWhen one (of the other castes) arrives at old age, or has a grandson, he may wisely give up the management of his household to his son or to a relation, abandon worldly concerns, and leaving the city, retire into the desert. He\nmay there build himself a hermitage, and putting away the outward pleasures of sense, practise mortification of his body in preparation for his last journey. If his wife, through affection, desire to accompany him, he may suffer it and not deny her, but he must resist all carnal inclinations. Here he preserves the sacred fire of his daily sacrifice and clothes himself with the leaves of trees or with skins, and he may wear [158] a coarse loin-cloth. He should never cut his hair or his nails and morning, noon, and evening he should perform the prescribed ablutions and the Sandhy\u0101. Like the Grihastha, he should perform the Homa sacrifice morning and evening, but his ablutions are three times more numerous, in as much as he performs them ten times to the other's three. He must always keep his head bowed down and follow the instructions given in the P\u0101tanjala system and carefully control the emotions of the spirit. He should employ his time in reading the Vedas, sleep only at night, and lie on the bare ground. During the four months of the hot season he sits between five fires, lighting four about him, and having the sun burning over head. During the four months of the rains he should live upon a stage sustained by four poles, so that he may not be in danger from a flood nor injure minute animals by his movements, nor must he protect himself from the weather. During the four months of the cold season, he should pass the night sitting in cold water. He should always observe the Chandrayana fast and eat only at night. He is permitted to keep a store of food sufficient for a year and should accept nothing from others, living on grain and gathering wild fruits that have fallen. He eats nothing that is cooked, but he may moisten his food. If he can obtain naught else, he may beg of other anchorites, and failing them, he may go into the town to seek the necessaries of life but he must not remain there.\n\nIf he is unable to live in this manner, he abandons all sustenance and journeys onwards to the east or north till his\nbodily powers are exhausted, or he throws himself into fire or water in self-destruction, or casts himself down from a precipice and thus ends his life. They consider that heaven is the reward of this course and final liberation is dependent on the profession of asceticism. What is understood by some as mukti, or final liberation, is, that in a former birth, this stage of abandonment of the world had been attained.\n\nThe fourth period is Sanny\u0101sa, which is an extraordinary state of austerity that nothing can surpass, and which when duly carried out is rewarded by final liberation. Such a person His Majesty calls Sanny\u0101si.7\n\nAfter the completion of the third stage, and the habit of self-denial in all sensual pleasures is acquired, the disciple first obtains the permission of his teacher and then quits his wife, shaves his head, beard, and the hair of his face and abandons all worldly concerns. His teacher presents him with a loin-cloth and some covering and accepts a trifle in return. He does not occupy himself with reading, but applies himself entirely to spiritual contemplation. He passes his life alone in the wilds, performs his ablutions morning, noon, and evening, and is scrupulous in self-purification and practises the duties described in the Patanjala system, carrying them out after his own method. He performs the Sandhy\u0101 and then repeats from one to twelve thousand times the word Om, which is the beginning of the Vedas. At the fourth ghari before the close of day, he goes into the city, and repeats the name of God, begging at three, five, or seven houses of Br\u0101hmans, but does not take more than a handful of food [159] from each. If they put it into his hand he straightway eats it, or if they throw it on the ground, he takes it up with his mouth or gathers it in a cloth and eats it after cleansing it in a stream. He then retires to a place where there is no sign of the cooking of food or lighting of a fire.\n\n7 The term Sanny\u0101sin was applied many centuries before His Majesty was born.\nHe avoids a Sudra or a Mlechchha and if he is not quickly supplied with food, he does not wait. After eating he directs his eyes to the tip of his nose or to his brow and passes a brief space in meditation. He walks with his head and feet bare and does not remain in any one place. If he is compelled to pass through a city or village, he does not remain in the former more than three days nor in the latter more than one. In the rains he abides in one spot and thus is his life passed. Some adopt the course of religious abandonment both during the first and second periods.\n\nSome say that the first period extends to twenty-five years, and the same is allowed for the three other periods. The second is lawful to all the four castes; the first and third to all but Sudras, but the fourth is exclusively for Br\u0101hmans.\n\nWORSHIP OF THE DEITY\n\nThe Hindu sages declare that whoever seeks to do the will of God, must devote certain works exclusively to purposes of worship and the first six of the nine schools already alluded to, comprise this under four heads.\n\nThe First is\u2014\n\nISVARA-PUJA,\n\nor\n\nDivine Worship.\n\nSince according to their belief, the Supreme Deity can assume an elemental form without defiling the skirt of the robe of omnipotence, they first make various idols of gold and other substances to represent this ideal and gradually withdrawing the mind from this material worship, they become meditatively absorbed in the ocean of His mysterious Being. Sixteen ceremonies conduce to this end. After the performance of the Homa and Sandhy\u0101 obligations, the devotee sits\ndown facing the east or north, and taking up a little rice and water sprinkles (the idol) with the intention of beginning the worship of God. Then follows the Kalasa-puja or pitcher-worship. The water of the pitcher which is required for the ceremony is venerated after a special manner. He next performs the Sankha-puja, wherein the white shell is venerated which is filled with water to be poured over the idol. Next follows the Ghanta-puja, in which the gong is plastered with sandalwood unguent and worshipped. When these are concluded, he sprinkles a little rice with the intention of soliciting the manifestation of the deity. Such is the first of the sixteen ceremonies. (2) The intention is made that the prayer of the supplicant may be accepted. A throne of metal or other substance is placed as a seat for the deity. (3) He pours water into a vessel that he may wash his feet when he comes, it being the custom of the country to wash the feet of superiors when they enter a house. (4) He throws down water thrice on the ground to represent the rinsing of the mouth by that mystical being, as it is also a custom of this country among the more refined classes to offer this service to a superior before meal-time. (5) Sandal, flowers, betel, and rice are thrown into water and thus offered. (6) The idol is lifted up with its seat and carried to another place. With the right hand a white conch-shell is held while with the left a gong is struck and the water is poured over the idol which is then washed. (7) The idol is then dried with a cloth and placed upon its throne and it is dressed in such costly robes as circumstances can furnish. (8) It is then invested with the sacred string. (9) The sectarian mark is next made in twelve places with sandal. (10) Flowers or leaves are then strewn over it. (11) It is fumigated with perfumes. (12) A lamp is lit with clarified butter. (13) Food according to ability is then\n\n* A twig of each of the following sacred trees: Ficus religiosa, Ficus indica, Ficus glomerata, Mimosa albida and the Mangifera Indica are placed in the pitcher of water as an oblation.\nplaced on a table before the idol, which is then distributed to people as the idol's leavings. (14) Is the Namas-k\u0101ra which is a posture of supplication. He repeats the praises of God with heart and tongue and falls prostrate with his whole body like a staff. This prostration is called danda-vat (staff-like); he so prostrates himself that eight of his limbs touch the earth,\u2014the two knees, the two hands, the forehead, the nose, and the right and left cheeks. This is called S\u0101sht\u0101\u1e45g\u0101, (eight members). Many perform one of these two obeisances in supplication before the great. (15) Circumambulating the idol several times. (16) Standing like a slave before it, and taking leave.\n\nIn each of these ceremonies, prayers are repeated and particular acts are performed. Some consider only five of these ceremonies from the 7th to the 13th, as imperative, others practice more; except a Sudra and a Sanny\u0101sin, all others perform this worship thrice daily.\n\nWorship is of six kinds: (1) In the heart. (2) Making the sun a means of divine adoration. (3) Causing fire to serve the purpose of spiritual recollection. (4) Worshipping in presence of water. (5) Cleaning a spot of ground as a place for worship. (6) Making an idol a representative object of prayer. They also make images of those who have attained to God and account their veneration as a means of salvation.\n\nThe Second kind is\u2014\n\nYAJNA,\u2079\n\nor\n\nSacrifice.\n\nBy this the favour of the deities is obtained and it becomes the means [P. 161] of securing the blessing of God. The\n\n\u2079 For the Hindu yajna, Hastings Encyclop. ii. 800-801, xii. 611-618, iv. 770-771, v. 13-16, and ii. 160. J\u0101g is the popular Hindi form of the Sanskrit yajna.\nterm *J\u0101g* is also used. *P\u0101ka-yajna* (simple or domestic sacrifice) is making the *Homa* in the name of the deities and bestowing charity before taking food. This is variously performed. *Japa-yajna* is the muttering of incantations and the names of God. These two, like the first, are of daily practice. *Vidhi-yajna* or ceremonial act of worship is of numerous kinds, in each of which important conditions are prescribed, large sums of money expended and many animals sacrificed. One of these is the *Asvamedha*, or horse-sacrifice, which is performed by sovereign princes. When its necessary preparations are completed, a white horse having the right ear black, is brought out and consecrated by certain incantations, and (being turned loose) it is followed in its march by an army for conquest which in a short time subdues the world and the king of every territory (which it enters) tenders submission and joins the victorious forces. They pretend that whoever performs this sacrifice a hundred times, becomes lord of heaven. Many are said to have attained this rank and marvellous legends are told of them. If he cannot perform that number he obtains an eminent place in that region.\\(^{10}\\)\n\nAnother is the *R\u0101ja-suya-yajna*, one of the conditions attached to which is the presence of all the princes of the world at the great festival, each of whom is appointed to a particular duty, and the service at the banquet can be performed only by them. Whoever has twice inaugurated this ceremony becomes lord of heaven, and many (are said) to have obtained this happiness. There are manifold kinds of these sacrifices, but the two herein mentioned must suffice.\n\n\\(^{10}\\) After the return of the king, if successful, with the vanquished princes in his train, the horse was sometimes immolated, after the festival of rejoicing. Failure in conquest was followed by contempt and ridicule of overweening pretension. The antiquity of this sacrifice goes back to Vedic times. Albiruni briefly describes it in Chap. LXV. *Asvamedha* in Hastings, ii. 160,\nThe Third kind is\u2014\n\nDANA,\nor\nAlms giving.\n\nThere are numerous forms of this meritorious precept and various are the modes by which the provision for man's last journey is secured. The following sixteen are accounted the most important:\n\n(1) Tula-d\u0101na or the weighing of the person against gold, silver and other valuables. (2) Hiranyagarbha-d\u0101na: an idol of Brahm\u0101 is fashioned of gold, having four faces in each of which are two eyes, two ears, a mouth and nose. It must have four hands, and the rest of the members are after the form of men. It must be 72 fingers high and 48 in breadth. Its weight may vary between a minimum of 33 tolahs and 4 m\u0101shas and a maximum of 3,410 tolahs. It is decked with jewels, and incantations are pronounced over it. (3) Brahmanda-d\u0101na, or alms of the egg of Brahm\u0101. An egg is made of gold in two parts which when joined together have an oval shape. Its weight varies between a minimum of 66 tolahs and 7 m\u0101shas and a maximum of 3,633 tolahs and 4 m\u0101shas. [162] Its length and breadth may not be less than twelve fingers nor greater than one hundred. (4) Kalpa-taru-d\u0101na. This is the name of a tree\\(^{11}\\) (taru) which is one of the fourteen treasures brought out of the sea, as will be related. A similar tree is made of gold, and birds are represented sitting on its branches. It should weigh not less than 12 tolahs, and the maximum weight as above. (5) Go-sahasra-d\u0101na, is the alms of a thousand cows with one bull, having the tips of their horns, according to ability, plated with gold or silver and their humps covered with copper, with bells and tassels of y\u0101k's hair round their necks, and pearls in the tails.\n\n\\(^{11}\\) Of Indra's paradise, granting all desires. D\u0101na, Hastings, iii. 387-389 (under Charity).\n(6) Hiranya-k\u0101madhenu-d\u0101na. A golden cow and calf are made; they may be of three kinds; the first weighs 3,410 tolas; the second, the half of this weight, and the third weighs one-fourth. (7) Hiranyak\u1e63va-d\u0101na. A golden horse is fashioned weighing from ten tolas to 3,633 tolas and four m\u0101shas. (8) Hiranyak\u1e63va-ratha. A chariot of gold of the first of the above-mentioned weights is made with four wheels and from four to eight horses weighing from ten to 6,606 tolas and eight m\u0101shas. (9) Hemahasti-ratha-d\u0101na is an alms of a chariot of gold drawn by four elephants. Its weight is from sixteen tolas and eight m\u0101shas to the maximum aforesaid. (10) Pancha-l\u0101ngala-d\u0101na is a gift of five ploughs of gold of the above weight. (11) Dhara-d\u0101na, is a figure of the surface of the earth made of gold, upon which are represented mountains, woods and seas, weighing not less than sixteen tolas, eight m\u0101shas, and not more than 3,633 tolas. (12) Visva-chakra-d\u0101na. A complete radiate of eight petals is made of gold representing the entire dome of the heavens, and is of four weights, viz. 3,333 tolas, four m\u0101shas: half of the above: one-fourth: 66 tolas, 8 m\u0101shas. (13) Kalpalatad\u0101na is in the shape of a creeper. [P. 163] Ten tendrils are made of gold, weighing from sixteen to 3,330 tolas, four m\u0101shas. (14) Sapta-sagara-d\u0101na. The seven seas are represented in gold weighing not less than twenty-three tolas, four m\u0101shas, and not more than the weight above given. The length and breadth of each of these are twenty-one fingers, or the half thereof. The first sea is filled with salt; the second, with milk; the third, with clarified butter; the fourth, with molasses; the fifth, with butter-milk; the sixth, with sugar; the seventh with Ganges-water. (15) Ratna-dhenu-d\u0101na, the\n\n---\n\n12 Dhenu is a milch-cow, or a cow that has calved. K\u0101madhenu is the cow of plenty, belonging to the sage Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, yielding all that is desired. For Hiranya-garbha. See p. 163.\n\n13 Mah\u0101-bh\u016bta signifies a 'huge creature' and 'ghata' is the frontal sinus of an elephant. Ganesa was the son of \u015aiva and P\u0101rvat\u012b and is invoked at the beginning of undertakings as removing\nrepresentation of a cow with a calf made up of jewels. (16) Mah\u0101bhuta-ghata-d\u0101na, is a representation in gold of the figure of a man surmounted by the head of an elephant, which is called Ganesa. Its weight is from sixteen tolahs, eight m\u0101shas to 3,330 tolas, four m\u0101shas.\n\nIn some works the first or Tula-d\u0101na, the weight whereof should be not less than 106 tolahs, eight m\u0101shas, nor more than 833 tolahs, four m\u0101shas, is alone given, and the remaining forms are omitted. There is also some difference of opinion regarding the distribution. Some give only to the Ach\u0101rya or teacher who shares the alms with others, while some bestow it also upon other Br\u0101hmans.\n\nFor each of these forms of charity, there are various injunctions. Although no distinct season is fixed, they are regarded as of more efficacy in times of eclipse and when the sun enters Capricorn and on some other occasions. Strange legends are told of them and of their results, as for instance regarding the first kind, if the giver weighs himself against gold, he will remain in paradise for a thousand million kalpas and advance from degree to degree of beatitude, and when he re-assumes human form will become a mighty monarch.\n\nThe Fourth kind is\u2014\n\nSRADDHA,\n\nor\n\nCeremonies in honour of deceased ancestors.\n\nThe charity is given in the name of deceased ancestors and is of various kinds, but four are specially observed: (1) On the day of decease and its anniversary. (2) On the first day of the first quarter of the new moon. (3) On the sixteenth lunar day of the month of Ku\u0101r, (Sept.-Oct.).\n\nobstacles. He is represented as a short pot-bellied man frequently mounted on a rat or attended by one, and to denote his sagacity, has the head of an elephant, with, however, but one tusk.\u2014Monier Williams.\n(4) Bestowing charity in a place of worship in the name of the deceased.\n\n[164] The manner of performing it is to bestow money and gifts in kind, dressed and undressed, on Br\u0101hmans in the name of father, grandfather and great grandfather including their wives, and in the same way on the three directly ascending male ancestors of the mother and their wives. All four castes may perform this ceremony.\n\nWhen these four duties of worship, sacrifice, alms-giving and commemoration of the deceased, as now described, are performed, the worship of God is accounted to be perfectly carried out, and without them it is not effected.\n\n**AVATARAS,**\n\nor\n\n**Incarnations of the Deity.**\n\nThey believe that the Supreme Being in the wisdom of His counsel, assumes an elementary form of a special character for the good of the creation, and many of the wisest of the Hindus accept this doctrine. Such a complete incarnation is called *Purn\u0101vat\u0101ra*, and that principle which in some created forms is scintillant with the rays of the divinity and bestows extraordinary powers is called *Ans\u0101vat\u0101ra* or partial incarnation. These latter will not be here considered.\n\nOf the first kind they say that in the whole four *Yugas*, ten manifestations will take place, and that nine have up to the present time appeared.\n\n**MATSYAVATARA,**\n\nor\n\n**Fish-Incarnation.**\n\nThe Deity was herein manifested under the form of a fish. They say that in the Dr\u0101vid\u0101 country at the extremity\n\n---\n\n14 For the Avat\u0101rs, see Hastings, *Encyclop.* vii. 193-197 (by Jacobi).\nof the Dekhan in the city of Bhadr\u0101vati, during the Satya Yuga on the eleventh lunar day of the month of Ph\u0101lguna (Feb.-March), R\u0101j\u0101 Manu, having withdrawn himself from all worldly concerns, and being then ten hundred thousand years of age, lived in the practice of great austerities. He was performing his ablutions on the banks of the river Kritam\u0101la when a fish came into his hand and said \"preserve me.\" It remained in his hand a day and night and as it increased in size, he put it into a cup, and when it grew larger, he placed it in a pitcher. When the latter could not contain it, he put it into a well and thence transferred it to a lake and afterwards to the Ganges. As the Ganges could not hold it, he gave it place in the ocean, and when it filled the ocean, the R\u0101j\u0101 recognised the origin of the miracle and worshipped it and prayed for a revelation. He heard the following answer: \"I am the Supreme Being. I have assumed the form of this creature for thy salvation and that of a few of the elect. After seven days the world will be destroyed and a flood shall cover the earth. Get thou into a certain ark with a few of the righteous together with the divine books and choice medicinal herbs and fasten the ark to this horn which cometh out of me.\" The deluge continued one million, seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand years after which it subsided.\n\n---\n\n15 The story is told in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata with reference to the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a as its authority which would imply that the poem is later than the Pur\u0101\u1e47a, but according to Wilson, the great epic is much older than any extant Pur\u0101\u1e47a, and the simplicity of the story in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is of much more antique complexion than the extravagance of the actual Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a. In the former, Manu collects the seeds of existing things in the ark, explained in the latter, as effected by the power of Yoga. In the latter, the great serpents come to serve as cords to fasten the ark to the horn of the fish; in the former, a cable of ropes is used. As the ark is borne on the waters, Manu enters into converse with the fish, and its replies which concern the creation, regal dynasties and the duties of the different orders, form the subject of the Pur\u0101\u1e47a. \u2014Wilson, V. P.\nKurmaavatara,\n\nor\n\nTortoise-Incarnation.\n\nIn the Satya Yuga in the light half of the month of Karttika (Oct.-Nov.), on the twelfth lunar day, the Creator manifested himself in the shape of a tortoise. They relate that the deities wished to obtain the water of immortality after the manner of butter by churning the ocean [165] of milk. Instead of a churning-stick, they used the largest of the mountains, Mandara. From its excessive weight the mountain sank into the ocean, and great were their difficulties. The Deity assumed this shape and bore up the mountain on his back and the gods obtained their desire.\n\nBy this miraculous act, fourteen priceless objects were brought up from the sea:\u2014(1). Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune, appeared as a bride and thus a source of happiness to all creatures was obtained. (2). Kaustabha-mani, or the wonderful jewel Kaustabha, of extraordinary lustre and in value beyond price. (3). Parijataka-vriksha, the miraculous tree Parijataka whose flowers never fade and whose fragrance fills the universe. Some say that it grants all desires. It is called also Kalpavriksha. (4). Sura, (the goddess of) wine. (5). Dhanvantari, the physician (of the gods) who could heal the sick and raise the dead to life. In his right hand, he held a leech and in his left (a branch of) the myrobalan tree. His Majesty considers that these two should be regarded separately and the number of treasures be accounted sixteen. (6). Chandra-mani, the (moon-gem or) world-illumining moon. (7). Kama-dhenu, the miraculous cow which gave forth from her udders the gratification of every wish. (8). Airavata, the white elephant (of Indra) with four tusks. (9). Sankha, the white conch-shell of wondrous sound that bestowed victory.\n\nThe coral tree, Erythrina Indica, one of the five trees of Paradise.\non whomsoever possessed it. (10). Visha, deadly poison. (11). Amrita, the water of life. (12). Rambha,\\(^{17}\\) the nymph, beautiful and sweet-dispositioned. (13). Asva, the horse with eight heads. (14). S\u0101ragadhanus, or the bow S\u0101ranga of which the unerring arrow carried to any distance.\n\nAfter producing these inestimable treasures, the tortoise descended into the earth and is believed still to exist.\n\nVARAHAVATARA,\n\nor\n\nBoar-Incarnation.\n\nIn the Satya Yuga, on the day of the full moon in the month of K\u0101rttika (Oct.-Nov.) in the city of Brahm\u0101varta near Nimish\u0101ra\\(^{18}\\) and Ayodhya, this manifestation took place. [P. 166] One of the Daityas named Hiranyaksha had passed a long period in the practice of austerities and the worship of God. One day the Deity appeared to him in visible form and asked him what he desired. Rejoiced at these gracious words, he enumerated many noxious animals and prayed for exemption from their injury and that he might be monarch of the whole universe. Shortly after he obtained his wishes, and dispossessing Indra of the sovereignty of heaven, committed its charge to one of his own kindred. The deities and Brahm\u0101\n\n---\n\n\\(^{17}\\) A nymph of Indra's paradise, sometimes regarded as a form of Lakshmi, and popularly accepted as a type of female beauty. The order and number of these ocean treasures varies in different accounts. See the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a on the churning of the ocean. I. IX.\n\n\\(^{18}\\) Or Naimisha from S. nimisha, a twinkling; the name of a forest and shrine, celebrated as the residence of certain Rishis to whom Sauti related the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The district was so-called because the sage Gaura-mukha destroyed an army of Asuras in a twinkling. Monier Williams, who refers to the Mah\u0101bh. Adi., p. 7275, Vana, p. 6079. It is called Nimkh\u0101r in the I. G., a town in the Sitapur Dist., Oudh, on the left bank of the Gumti, 20 miles from Sitapur town. Lat. 27\u00b0 20' 55\" N. and long. 80\u00b0 31' 40\". It is described as a place of great sanctity with numerous tanks and temples. In one of the tanks, R\u0101ma is said to have washed away his sin of slaying a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 in the person of R\u0101vana, the ravisher of S\u012bt\u0101.\nhastened to Vishnu and besought his aid. As in the request for exemption the name of the boar had been omitted, they received this answer, \"I will manifest myself under that form and deprive him of life.\"\n\nSoon afterwards, Vishnu took this shape and entering his capital, destroyed him. This is pointed out as having taken place at Soron. The earth was again peopled with the virtuous and Indra recovered his sovereignty of the world above.\n\nThe period of this manifestation was a thousand years.\n\nNARA-SINHA,\n\nor\n\nMan-Lion-Incarnation.\n\nThis was a form from the head to the waist like a lion and the lower parts resembling a man, and was manifested in the Satya Yuga on the fourteenth of the light half of the month of Vais\u0101kha (April-May), in the city of Hiranyakapura now commonly called Hindaun near the metropolis of Agra. They say that Hiranyakasipu of the Daitya race spent many long years in a life of austerity until the Deity appeared to him and asked his desire. His first prayer was that his death might not take place by night nor by day, and next, he begged protection against all noxious animals which he severally named, and lastly, that he might obtain sovereignty over the realms above and below. His request was granted. The deities yielded submission to him and the world was filled with the righteous. The chief spirits implored aid of Vishnu through Brahm\u0101 and their prayer was heard. It is\n\n---\n\n19 In the Etah district, N. W. P. It is a town of great antiquity according to the I. G. and was originally known as Ukala-Kshetra, but after the destruction of Hiranyaksha, the name was changed to Sukara-Kshetra (beneficent-region). Devout Hindus after visiting Mathur\u0101, go on to Soron to bathe in the Barhgang\u0101 which is here lined with handsome temples and gh\u0101ts.\n\n20 In the Jaipur State, situated in 26\u00b0 44' N., and long. 77\u00b0 5' E., on the old route from Agra to Mhow, 71 miles S. W. of the former.\nsaid that Hiranyakasipu had a son called Prahl\u0101da who, like the deities, worshipped the Supreme God and followed the path of truth in spite of his father, who though he subjected his son to much persecution, was unable to turn him from that course. One evening his father asked him where the Supreme Being dwelt. He replied that he was omnipresent and to explain his meaning, pointed to a pillar in which also he declared the Deity to be. The king in folly smote it with his sword, and by a miracle from heaven, the above form came forth from it and tore him to pieces at the interval of time between night and day, and his death was caused by an animal of a specially-created type. It is said that this divine form asked Prahl\u0101da to choose some boon. The great-souled youth prayed only for final liberation (jivan-mukti), [167] which is eternal life freed from the defilement of corporal existence and from the bonds of joy and sorrow. This manifestation continued one hundred years.21\n\nVAMANA,\nor\nDwarf-Incarnation.\n\nIn the Treta Yuga, on the twelfth day of the light half of the month of Bh\u0101drapada (H. Bh\u0101don, Aug.-Sept.) in the city of Sonbhadra on the banks of the Narbad\u0101, this new manifestation was born of Aditi in the house of Kasyapa, the son of Marichi, the son of the legendary Brahm\u0101. This incarnation continued a thousand years. Bali of the Daitya race underwent an austere penance to obtain the sovereignty of the three worlds. The Bountiful Giver of all desires revealed himself and granted his wish and Bali thus obtained a mighty dominion. Having subdued the throned princes of the gods, he left them in possession of their principalities.\n\n21 Four chapters of the Vishnu Pur\u0101na, from the 17th to the 21st, are taken up with the history of the legend. The story is told in detail only in the Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101na.\nHe performed many sacrifices, but neglected to present to the deities their customary offerings. The latter, through the intercession of Brahm\u0101, implored Vishnu to dethrone him who comforted them by revealing the issue of events. In the same year this moon-orb displayed its radiance, and when the child grew in wisdom, in conformity with rule and custom he was placed under the tuition of the sage Bharadw\u0101ja. With his preceptor he attended the sacrifice which the king had inaugurated at Kurukshetra, and after the royal custom, Bali asked him what boon he desired. He replied, \"I ask of thee as much ground as I can cover with three steps.\" The king in amazement rejoined, \"Is so slight a gift craved of a monarch so illustrious and powerful?\" When at last, after some debate he consented, the first step was so great that it covered the earth and the lower regions. The second measured the extent of the celestial world. The R\u0101j\u0101 delivered himself up in bonds in commutation of the third step. On account of the natural goodness of the R\u0101j\u0101's disposition, after depriving him of his universal sovereignty, he conceded to him the rule of the nether world.\n\nPARASURAMAVATARA,\n\nor\n\nIncarnation of R\u0101ma with the axe.\n\nIn the house of Jamadagni a Br\u0101hman, and of his wife Renuk\u0101, during the Treta Yuga, on the third day of the light half of the month of Vais\u0101kha, in the village of Rankatta near Agra, this human form was born.\n\nK\u0101rttavirya of the Daitya race, who had neither hands nor feet, was at that time on the throne. In great affliction\n\n---\n\n22 This is an error, probably of a copyist. He was sovereign of the Haihaya tribe, descendants of Yadu from the twelfth prince of the lunar line. Of this tribe there were five great divisions, the T\u0101lojanghas, Vitihotras, Avantyas, Tundikeras and J\u0101tas. They dwelt in Central India. The capital of the first named was M\u0101hishmati or Chuli Maheswar, still called, according to Col. Todd\non account of his misfortune, he abandoned the world and retired to the Kail\u0101sa mountain to undergo penance. Mah\u0101deva vouchsafing his favour, gave him a thousand arms and at his prayer bestowed on him the sovereignty of the three worlds. But he oppressed the deities for which reason they implored his destruction, and their supplication was heard. They say that Jamadagni was descended from Mah\u0101deva and Renuk\u0101 from Aditi mother of the deities (Adityas). She had five sons, the fifth being Parasur\u0101ma. He was instructed by Mah\u0101deva in the Kail\u0101sa mountain, and Jamadagni his father worshipped in the desert. K\u0101rttavirya was one day engaged in the pastime of hunting and he happened to pass by the hermitage of Jamadagni and sought there to satisfy his hunger and thirst. The hermit brought forth food and drink, besides jewels and valuable presents befitting a monarch. The king was amazed and refused to touch them till he was informed concerning their possession. He replied that Indra, the ruler of the celestial regions, had bestowed upon him the cow K\u0101madhenu which supplied him with all that he required. The king, seized with avarice, demanded the cow. He answered that he could not comply with his request without the sanction of Indra, and that no earthly power could take possession of it. The king enraged determined to use force, but notwithstanding all the troops he could collect and his hostile attempts, he could not prevail. At length one\n\nSahasra-b\u0101hu ki basti, 'village of the thousand armed,' i.e., of K\u0101rttavirya. (R\u0101jasth\u0101n, l. 39, n.). These tribes must have preceded the R\u0101jput tribes by whom their country, M\u0101lwa, Ujjain and the valley of the Narbad\u0101, is now occupied. A remnant of the Haihaya still exists at the top of the valley of Soh\u0101gpur in Bagel-khand, aware of their ancient lineage and celebrated for their valour. Their predatory connection with the Sakas, suggests their Scythian origin, which the word Haya, meaning in Sansk. a horse, is supposed to confirm, perhaps from their nomadic habits implied in the Homeric name, Hippemolgi. Wilson hints their connection with the Huns. See his notes to Book, IV, Chapters III and XI, V. P. The Kail\u0101sa mountain, the fabled Paradise of Siva is placed by the Hindus, north of the M\u0101nasa lake and regarded as one of the loftiest peaks of the Himalayas. Vide Vol. II, 313, n. 2.\nnight he came secretly and slew Jamadagni, but found no trace of the cow. Renuk\u0101 sent for her son Parasur\u0101ma, and performing the funeral ceremonies of the deceased, burnt herself according to the custom of her people and laid upon her son the injunction to avenge her. Parasur\u0101ma, endued with miraculous power, set out to engage the king, and twenty pitched battles took place. In the last, the king was slain and the deities recovered their sovereignty. He then collected the wealth of the universe and bestowed it in alms at a sacrificial ceremony, and then abandoning the world, retired to the obscurity of a solitude.\n\nHe is still believed to be living and his habitation is pointed out in the mountain Mahendra of the Konkan.\n\n**Ramavatara,**  \nor  \n*R\u0101ma-Incarnation.*\n\nThey relate that R\u0101vana one of the R\u0101kshasas two generations in descent from Brahm\u0101, had ten heads and twenty hands. He underwent austerities for a period of ten thousand years in the Kail\u0101sa mountain and devoted his heads, one after another in this penance in the hope of obtaining the sovereignty of the three worlds. The Deity appeared to him and granted his prayer. The gods were afflicted by his rule and as in the former instances, solicited his dethronement which was vouchsafed, and R\u0101ma was appointed to accomplish this end. He was accordingly born during the Treta Yuga on the ninth of the light half of the month of Chaitra.\n\n---\n\n23 This fable is taken from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and inserted in the 7th Chapter, Book IV, of the Vishnu Pur\u0101na. In this, R\u0101ma uses his axe to cut off his mother's head at the command of his father, who restored her again to life at his son's request. The sons of K\u0101rttavirya are there said to revenge the death of their father by slaying Jamadagni in R\u0101ma's absence.\n\n24 He was the son of Visravas, son of Pulastya, son of Brahm\u0101.\n(March-April) in the city of Ayodhya, of Kausalya wife of R\u0101j\u0101 Dasaratha. At the first dawn of intelligence, he acquired much learning and withdrawing from all worldly pursuits, set out journeying through wilds and gave a fresh beauty to his life by visiting holy shrines. He became lord of the earth and slew R\u0101vana. He ruled for eleven thousand years and introduced just laws of administration.\\textsuperscript{25}\n\n\\textbf{Krishnavatara,}\n\nor\n\n\\textit{Incarnation as Krishna.}\n\nMore than four thousand years ago, Ugrasena of the Yadu race bore sway in his capital of Mathur\u0101. His son Kansa rebelled and dethroning his father ruled with a persecuting hand, while at the same time Jar\u0101sandha, Sisup\u0101la and other princes of the Daityas exercised unbounded tyranny.\n\n[P. 169] The afflicted earth assuming the form of a cow, hastened with Brahm\u0101 to Vishnu and implored their destruction. The prayer was granted and the divine commission was entrusted to Krishna. They say that the astrologers foretold to Kansa that a child would shortly be born and that his reign would be at an end. He thereupon ordered the slaughter of all infants and thus each year the blood of many innocent children was shed until his sister Devaki married Vasudeva of the Yadu race. Now Kansa heard a report that Devaki\u2019s eighth son would be the cause of his death. He therefore confined them both in prison and put to death every son that was born to them. In the beginning of the Kali Yuga, on the eighth lunar day of the dark half of the month of Bh\u0101dra-pada (Aug.-Sept.), in the city of Mathur\u0101 near the metropolis\n\n\\textsuperscript{25} The literature of the R\u0101m\u0101yana in various languages is sufficiently well-known to dispense with a reference to the details of this Avat\u0101ra. For the R\u0101m\u0101yana, see Hastings, Encyclo. x. 574-578 and Winternitz, History of Indian Literature.\nof Agra, the child was born while the guards were negligent. The fetters fell off and the doors were opened and the child spoke thus. \"On the other side of the Jamuna, a girl has even now been born in the house of the cowherd Nanda, and the family are asleep. Take and leave me there and bring the girl hither.\" As Vasudeva set out to fulfill this injunction, the river became fordable and the command was obeyed. Krishna in his ninth year killed Kansa, released Ugrasena from prison and seated him on the throne. He also engaged the other tyrants and overthrew them.\n\nHe lived one hundred and twenty-five years and had 16,108 wives, each of whom gave birth to ten sons and one daughter, and each wife thought that she alone shared her husband's bed.\n\n**Buddhavatara,**  \nor  \n**Buddha-Incarnation.**\n\nHe was born of M\u0101ya in the house of R\u0101j\u0101 Sudhodhana of the race of R\u0101machandra during the Kali Yuga, on the eighth of the light half of the month of Vais\u0101kha in the city of Magadh.\n\nThey say that as many sacrifices were performed at this period and the number of animals sacrificed was very large, Vishnu willed to appear in human form to condemn the Vedic institutions and their sacrificial rites. For this reason he became incarnate in that year and lived to the age of a hundred. Some account of him has already preceded.\n\n**Kalkyavatara,**  \nor  \n**Kalki-Incarnation.**\n\nAt the close of the Kali Yuga, in the tenth of the light half of the month of Vais\u0101kha, this birth will take place in\nthe family of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 Vishnuyasas from the womb of his wife Yasovati in the town of Sambhala.\\textsuperscript{26}\n\nThey say that a time will come when a just prince will not be left upon the earth, iniquity will abound, grain become excessively dear, and [P. 170] the age of men will become shortened so that they will not live beyond thirty years, and deaths will be rife. For the remedy of these disorders, the Deity will become incarnate and renew the world in righteousness.\n\nSome add fourteen other Avat\u0101ras, making them twenty-four, and have written works on the histories of each, relating many extraordinary legends.\n\nMany men fashion images of these Avat\u0101ras in silver and gold and worship them, but the Jainas and Buddhas do not believe in the complete incarnations (Purnavat\u0101ras).\n\nUnclean Things.\n\nThese are,\u2014wine, blood, semen, excrement, urine, excretions from the mouth, nose, ears and eyes, sweat, hair, detached nails, bones of animals whose flesh is forbidden, a woman in her courses, and one newly delivered during the period hereinafter stated, any dead animal, forbidden food, a sweeper, an ass, a dog, (tame) swine, the dust that rises from off an ass, goat, sheep or broom, and the mud shaken out of a garment, a sinner guilty of the five great sins, or whoever touches such, a crow, a (tame domestic) cock, a mouse, a eunuch, the smoke from a burnt corpse, a washerman, a hunter, a fisherman, a gamester, a spirit-seller, an executioner, a tanner, a dyer, a currier, and an oilman.\n\n\\textsuperscript{26} See Vol. II. He is to appear on a white horse with a flashing sword for the final destruction of Mlechchhas and those that love iniquity, and to re-establish righteousness. The similarity of the idea and expression to the Apocalyptic vision of the white horse and its rider will readily occur to mind and the analogy between some of these manifestations and certain scenes in the New Testament has often been observed, and is not the result of accident.\nPurifiers.\n\nKnowledge, austerity, suspension of breath (pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma), religious exercises of the Sandhy\u0101, sun-light, moon-light, fire, water, air, earth, ashes, mustard-seed, wild produce of the earth, shade of a tree, the back and legs of a cow, a plough, a broom, sour things, salt-water, mouth of a horse or goat, eating certain food, the lapse of time, milk, butter-milk, clarified butter, and the dung and urine of a cow.\n\nState of Purification.27\n\nKnowledge and austerity purify the soul. When the inward person is unclean by improper food, it is purified by suppression of breath and the wild produce of the earth: a drunkard by molten glass. When the body is defiled by ordure, wine, blood and the like, it becomes pure by cleansing below the navel with earth and water, and above it with earth and water, rinsing the teeth, washing the eyes, bathing, abstaining for a day and a night from food and drink, and afterwards eating five things from a cow.28 A pathway or water that has been polluted by the shadow of a Chand\u0101l (pariah) is again purified by sunlight, moonlight, and air. If the ordure of any animal falls into a well, sixty pitchers full of water must be taken out; if into a tank, a hundred pitchers;\n\n27 On Hindu ideas of purification, Hastings, Encyclo. x. 490-491, and food, vi. 63-65. Prohibitions and permissions in regard to food and ceremonial purification are treated in the V. Lecture of Manu's Ordinances. Albiruni says that he was informed by Hindus that before the time of Bharata, the meat of cows was permitted, and cows were killed at certain sacrifices and that the reason of the prohibition was their unwholesomeness as food. In a hot climate the inner parts of the body are cold, the natural warmth is feeble and the digestion is so weak, that it has to be strengthened by chewing the betel-nut. The betel inflames the bodily heat, the chalk in the betel leaves dries up everything wet, and the betel-nut acts as an astringent on the teeth, gums and stomach. Hence cow's meat was forbidden as it is essentially thick and cold. II. Chapter 58.\n\n28 Milk, buttermilk, ghee, dung of a cow and its urine. [Sanskrit pancha gavya.]\nany part of a river, is purified by its own flow. From oil that is defiled, the contaminating matter is taken out and the oil is boiled. Milk cannot be purified except only when the shadow of a Chand\u0101l may have fallen upon it, in which case it becomes pure by boiling. Cotton, leaves, molasses, grain become pure by the sprinkling of a little water after removing the defilement. Gold, silver, stone, vegetable produce, rope and whatever grows beneath [P. 171] the earth and utensils of cane are purified by water, and if they have been defiled by unclean oil and the like, by hot water. Clothes are purified by water. Wooden vessels if defiled by the touch of a Chand\u0101l cannot be made pure, but if touched by a Sudra or any unclean thing, may be purified by scraping; and wood and bone and horn must be treated in the same manner. Anything made of stone after being washed must be buried for seven days. A sieve, a winnowing basket, a deer-skin, and the like, and a pestle-and-mortar, are purified by being sprinkled with water. A cart may be scraped in the part defiled and the rest dashed with water. An earthen vessel is purified by being heated in the fire; and the ground by one of the following: sweeping, lighting a fire thereon, ploughing, lapse of a considerable time, being touched by the feet or back of a cow, sprinkling with water, digging or plastering with cow-dung. Food smelt by a cow or into which hair, flies or lice have fallen, is purified with ashes and water. If anything is defiled by excretions from the mouth, nose, eyes, ears, or sweat, or touched by hair or nails detached from one's own body, it should be first washed, and then scoured with clean earth, and again washed until the smear and smell have gone. Excretions from the mouth, nose, ears, or eyes of another, if they come from above the navel, must if possible, be purified as above described, after which he must bathe: all below the navel, and the two hands are purified by cleansing in the same way. If he be defiled with spirituous liquor, semen, blood, catamenia, (the touch of) a lying-in woman,\nordure and urine, he must wash with water and scour with earth, and again wash with water if the defilement be above the navel; if it extend below, after the second washing, he must rub himself with butter from a cow and then with its milk, and afterwards with its butter-milk, and next smear himself with cowdung and wash in its urine, and finally drink three handfuls of water from the river. If he touch a washerman, or a dyer, or a currier, or an executioner, or a hunter, or a fisherman, or an oilman, or tame swine, he is purified by water only. But if he touch a woman in her courses or a lying-in woman, or a sweeper, or a great sinner, or a corpse, or a dog, or an ass, cat, crow, domestic cock, mouse or a eunuch, or the smoke of a burning corpse, or the dust from an ass, dog, goat or sheep reach him, he must enter the water in his clothes and bathe and look at the sun and pronounce incantations to it. After touching a greasy human bone, he must bathe with his clothes on or else wash himself and drink three handfuls of water and look at the sun and put his hand upon a cow. Where the sun is not visible, he must look upon fire. If silk or wool come in contact with any thing the touch of which (in a man) would require his bathing, it is purified by air and sunshine if it be not actually defiled, otherwise it must also be washed. A woman in her courses becomes pure after the fourth day.\n\nIf it is not known whether a thing be clean or unclean, they accept the decision of some virtuous person regarding it or sprinkle it with water. The details on this subject are numerous.\n\nImproper Dress.\n\n[172] A blue garment, unless it be of silk or wool, is improper for any caste except a Sudra, but a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s wife at night, and a Kshatriya woman as a bride or at a feast, may wear it, and a Vaisya woman must avoid it when perform-\ning the Sr\u0101ddha or funeral rites. The women of all three castes may not wear it when cooking or eating.\n\nPROHIBITED FOOD.\n\nHuman flesh, beef, horse-flesh, domestic cocks and hens, the parrot, the S\u0101rika, the Mynah, the pigeon, the owl, the vulture, the chameleon, the bustard, the S\u0101ras (Ardea antigone), the Papiha and waterfowl, frogs, snakes, weasels and animals whose toes are joined (web-footed birds): animals that abide in towns, except the goat; the ruddy goose (Anas casarca), the pond-heron (Ardea torra), dried fish or flesh, five kinds of fish, viz.:\u2014(1). The Rohu, (Cyprinus Rohita). (2). The Patthar Chat\u0101 (Stone licker). (3). The Sankara (probably a skate the Raia Sankar). (4). The R\u0101jiva. (5) The B\u0101rahi: carnivorous animals, the camel, the elephant, the rhinoceros, the monkey, the various reptiles; all that produces intoxication, camel\u2019s milk, mare\u2019s milk, and the milk of all animals that divide not the hoof; goat\u2019s and ewe\u2019s milk, the milk of forest animals, woman\u2019s milk, milk from a cow in the first ten days after calving, milk of a cow whose calf has died, till she calves again; garlic, leeks, carrots, the Sebesten plum (Cordia Sebestena) the produce from unclean land, or food which a man\u2019s foot has touched or the hand of a woman in her courses; anything from the house of a courtesan, or a thief, or a carpenter, or a usurer, or a blacksmith, or a polisher, or a goldsmith, or a washerman, or a weaver, or a tanner, or a currier, or a singer or dancer, or an armourer, or\n\n---\n\nThe last named, of which there are several variants, and the second and third, are not in Manu who mentions the pathina and simhatunda which together with the r\u0101jiva and rohu or rohita are declared to be lawful, but the commentator Medha-tithi limits the two latter to use at sacrificial ceremonies. I do not find the Patthar-chata mentioned in Day\u2019s Fishes of India. Stone-licking is common to a good many if not to all. The Sank\u0101ra is perhaps, a skate, the Raia Sankur; R\u0101jiva signifies streaked or striped, and is mentioned by Monier Williams as a fish whose spawn is said to be poisonous. I cannot identify it nor the following name B\u0101rahi. The rhinoceros is a disputed animal, M.

No one but the person who cooks may occupy the spot, and he must first bathe and put on a loin-cloth and cover his head and thus complete his meal. If a piece of paper or dirty rag or other such thing fall on the plastered space, the food is spoilt. He must bathe again and newly plaster the ground and provide fresh materials. The cook must be either the mistress of the family or a Br\u0101hman whose special duty this may be, or a relation, or the master of the house himself. [173.]\n\nBefore eating, the place where they sit must be plastered in the same way, and they occupy it without spreading any covering on the ground, but a stool or a wooden board, bare as aforesaid, may be used.\n\n\\textsuperscript{30} Slaying a Br\u0101hman, drinking spirituous liquor, theft, adultery with the wife of a Guru are the four great crimes; associating with those who commit them is the fifth. Manu IX, 235, and X, 55.\n\n\\textsuperscript{31} Curdled milk and all produced from it are expressly allowed. V. 10.\nNext, the following five ceremonies are regarded as indispensable:\u2014(1). Reading some portion of the Vedas. (2). Sprinkling water as a libation to departed ancestors. (3). Placing some food in front of the idol. (4). Throwing a little food on the ground in the name of the deities. (5). Giving some to the poor. First the children eat, then the relations satisfy themselves, after which the man himself partakes, but not out of the same dish with another even though it be a child. None but the cook may bring any provisions to the gathering. If by accident his hand touches any one, or he is touched by others, whatever food he holds in his hand at the time he must throw away, and bathing anew, bring fresh materials; unless the cook be a woman, for whom it will suffice to wash her hands and feet. The cook eats last of all. In drinking also, each person must have a separate vessel.\n\nFormerly it was the custom for a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a to eat at the house of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a or of a K\u1e63\u0101\u1e6driya or of a Vaisya, and a K\u1e63\u0101\u1e6driya might eat at any house but that of a Sudra; and a Vaisya in the same way; but in this cycle of Kali Yuga, each must take his meal in the house of his own caste. The utensils from which they eat are generally the leaves of trees, and fashioned of gold, silver, brass, and also of bell-metal, and they avoid the use of copper, earthenware, and stone vessels. They also consider it improper to eat from a broken dish or from the leaves of the bar or banyan tree (ficus Indica), the pipal, (ficus religiosa) and the swallow-wort (Asclepeas gigantea). To eat twice either in the night or day is not approved.\n\n---\n\n32 These being sacred; the flowers of the Asclepeas are placed upon the idol Mah\u0101deva. It secretes an acrid milky juice which flows from wounds in the shrub, and is applied to various medicinal purposes, and preparations of the plant are employed to cure all kinds of fits, epilepsy, hysterics, convulsions, poisonous bites. The flowers are large and beautiful, a mixture of rose and purple; there is also a white-flowered variety. Roxburgh, Flora Indica.\nRULES OF FASTING.\n\nThese are of numerous kinds, but a few will be mentioned.\n\nThe first kind is when they neither eat nor drink during the day and night, and twenty-nine of these days are obligatory during the year, viz., on the eleventh day of each lunar fortnight of every month; the Sivar\u0101tri, the fourteenth of the light half of the month of Vais\u0101kha (April-May) in which the birth of the Nara-Sinha, or Man-lion took place; the third of the light half of the same month being the anniversary of the birth of Parasur\u0101ma; the ninth of the light half of the month of Chaitra (March-April), the nativity of R\u0101ma; and the eighth of the dark half of the month of Bh\u0101dra-pada (Bh\u0101don, Aug.-Sept.), the nativity of Krishna. On these occasions, some abstain from grain only, and other authorities lay down particular details.\n\nThe second kind. They eat only at night.\n\nThe third kind. They take only water, fruit and milk.\n\nThe fourth kind. They eat but once during the day and night, but may drink water at any time.\n\nThe fifth kind. They do not of their own desire eat during twenty-four hours, but if pressed to do so, they may partake of food not more than once.\n\nThe sixth kind is the Chandr\u0101yana, which is in five ways:\u2014(1). On the first day of the month, one mouthful is taken and an increase of one mouthful made daily till the fifteenth, from which date it diminishes daily by the like quantity. [P. 174] (2). Or on the first of the month, fifteen mouthfuls are taken and the consumption daily diminishes till the fifteenth, when it is reduced to one mouthful; after which it again increases by one mouthful daily. (3). Some\n\n---\n\n32 Siva's night, a popular festival in honour of Siva kept on the 14th of the dark half of the month of M\u0101gha (Jan.-Feb.). When Siva is worshipped under the type of the Linga, a rigorous fast is observed. Monier Williams. Hindu fasting, Hastings, Encyclop., v. 761, vii. 362.\nsay that instead of this, three mouthfuls, should be taken each half-day, and nothing else should be touched. (4). Or, again, eight mouthfuls each half-day, four in the morning and four in the evening. (5). Or two hundred and forty mouthfuls may be eaten (during the month) in any manner at will: The size of the mouthful should be that of a pea-hen's egg, and the faster should bathe regularly morning, noon, and evening.\n\nThe seventh kind. They neither eat nor drink for twelve days.\n\nThe eighth kind. Out of twelve days, they eat a little once daily for three days consecutively, and once at night only for three days; during three other days and nights they do not eat unless some one brings them food, and for the remaining three, they fast altogether.\n\nThe ninth kind. For three days and nights they eat no more than one handful, and for three other days the same allowance only at night: for three more days and nights if any food is brought to them, they may take one handful, and for three days and nights they eat nothing.\n\nThe tenth kind. For three days and nights, they swallow only warm water: for three other such periods only hot milk, and again for three days and nights hot clarified butter, and for three days and nights they light a fire and put the mouth against an opening by which the hot air enters, which they inhale.\n\nThe eleventh kind. Out of fifteen days, for three days and nights they eat only leaves, and for three days and nights only the Indian fig; for three days and nights they are content with the seeds of the lotus; for three days and nights, leaves of the pipal; for three days and nights, the kind of grass called d\u0101bha.34\n\n34 Or darbha, the name specially of the kusa-grass (Poa Cynosuroides) used at sacrificial ceremonies, but also applied to the Saccharum spontaneum and S. cylindricum.\nThe twelfth kind. For six days out of the week they must content themselves with one of the following six consecutively, the produce of the cow:\u2014(1). Urine. (2). Dung. (3). Milk. (4). Buttermilk. (5). Butter. (6). Water. On the seventh he must abstain from food altogether.\n\nDuring every kind of fast they must abstain from meat, the pulse Adas, (Cicer lens), the bean Lobiya, (Dolichos Sinensis), honey and molasses; they must sleep on the ground; they may not play at such games as chaupar and solah; nor approach their wives at night, nor anoint themselves with oil, nor shave, and the like, and they must give alms daily and perform other good works.\n\nEnumeration of Sins.\n\nAlthough these exceed expression, and a volume could not contain them, they may be classed in seven degrees.\n\nThe first degree comprises five kinds which cannot be expiated.\n\n(1). Killing a Br\u0101hman. (2) Incest with the mother. (3). Drinking spirituous liquors by a Br\u0101hman, Ksh\u0101triya or Vaisya; accounted no sin, however, in a Sudra. Some authorities name three kinds of spirits, viz., distilled from rice or other grain: from mahwa (Bassia Latifolia), and the like: from molasses and similar things. All three are forbidden to the Br\u0101hman; the first-named only to the Ksh\u0101triya and the Vaisya. (4). Stealing ten m\u0101shas of gold. (5). Associating for one year with anyone guilty of these four.\n\nThe second degree. Untruth in regard to genealogy, carrying a slander to the king, and false accusation of a Guru, are equivalent to slaying a Br\u0101hman.\n\n---\n\n35 Both are games of hazard: the latter is also called solah-bagghu.

Stealing fruit, flowers, and firewood; want of mental firmness on important occasions.\n\nFor each of these degrees of sin certain penances have been appointed, the performance of which releases from further penalty: for instance, they say that whoever kills a Br\u0101hman will transmigrate into the form of a deer, a dog, a camel, or boar. When he takes human form he will be subject to diseases and end his life in great afflictions. The expiation is to cut off pieces of his own flesh and skin and throw them into the fire, or for twelve years forsake his family and taking a human skull in his hand, go abegging and from street to street and door to door proclaim his wickedness; this is, provided it was accidental, otherwise this penance lasts twenty-four years.\n\nThat is, teaching the Vedas for hire working in mines and dykes and bridges and other mechanical works, serving a Sudra, all of which are forbidden.\nINTERIOR SINS.\n\n[176] Although they hold these to be very numerous twelve are accounted heinous:\u2014(1). Krodha, being under the influence of anger. (2). Lobha, inordinate desire of rank and wealth. (3). Dvesha, hatred towards men. (4). R\u0101ga, love of worldly pleasures. (5). M\u0101na, esteeming one's self above others. (6). Moha, ignorance. (7). Mada, intoxication from spirituous liquors or wealth or youth or station or knowledge. (8). Soka, absorption in grief through loss of goods, reputation or honour, or separation from friends. (9). Mamatva, considering the things of the world as one's own. (10). Ahanak\u0101ra, egoism. (11). Bhaya, fearing other than God. (12). Harsha, joy in one's own virtue and the evil of others.\n\nThe endeavour of such as desire to know God should be first to restrain themselves from these twelve sins until they acquire virtuous dispositions and become worthy to attain to the divine union. Some say that all evil actions are reducible to ten heads, of which three corrupt the heart, viz., coveting the goods of another; resolving on any forbidden deed; scepticism in regard to the chosen servants of God. The same number defile the members of the body, viz., taking the goods of another by force; injury to the innocent; adultery.\n\nThe sins of the tongue are four, viz., scurrilous language, falsehood, slander, and useless tattle.\n\nMay the omnipotent Lord keep us from these ten sins and bring us to the goal of our desire.\n\n---\n\n*This is taken from Manu, XII. 5, 6, 7. Resolving on forbidden things is defined by a commentator as desiring to kill a Br\u0101hman and the like, and the third in conceiving notions of materialism and atheism.*\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nSACRED PLACES OF PILGRIMAGE.\n\nAlthough profound and enlightened moralists are convinced that true happiness consists in the acquisition of virtue and recognise no other temple of God but a pure heart, nevertheless the physicians of the spiritual order, from their knowledge of the pulsation of human feeling, have bestowed on certain places a reputation for sanctity and thus rousing the slumberers in forgetfulness and instilling in them the enthusiastic desire of seeking God, have made these shrines instruments for their reverencing of the just, and the toils of the pilgrimage a means of facilitating the attainment of their aim.\n\nThese holy places are of four degrees.\n\nThe first is termed deva or divine and dedicated to Brahm\u0101, Vishnu and Mah\u0101deva. The greatest among these are twenty-eight rivers in the following order:\u2014\n\n(1). Ganges. (2) Sarasvati. (3). Jamuna. (4). Narbad\u0101. (5). Vip\u0101s\u0101, known as Bi\u0101h (Hyphasis). (6). Vitast\u0101 (Hydaspes or Bidaspes) known as the B\u012bhat. (7). Kausiki, a river near Rhot\u0101s in the Panj\u0101b, but some place it in the neighbourhood of Garhi in the eastern districts. (8). Nand\u0101vati. (9). Chandrabh\u0101g\u0101, known as the Chen\u0101b. (10). Sarayu (Sarju) known as the Sar\u0101u. (11). Satyavati. (12). T\u0101pi known as Tapti upon the (north) bank of which is Burh\u0101npur. (13). P\u0101r\u0101vati. (14). P\u0101s\u0101vati. (15). Gomati (Gumti) near Dv\u0101rak\u0101. (16). Gandaki, upon the banks of which is Sult\u0101npur of the Subah of Oudh. (17). B\u0101hud\u0101. (18). Devik\u0101 (Deva or Gogra). (19). God\u0101vari, called also B\u0101nganga. Pattan of the Dekhan is situated on its bank. (20). T\u0101mraparni at the extremity of the Dekhan. Here pearls are found. (21). Charmanvati. (22). Varana, near Benares. (23). Ir\u0101vati,\nknown as the R\u0101vi (Hydraotes). Lahor is on its bank. (24). Satadru (the hundred-channelled), known as the Sutlej. Ludhiana is upon its bank. (25). Bhimarathi, [178] called also the Bhim\u0101, in the Dekhan. (26). Parnason\u0101; (27). Vanjara, in the Dekhan. (28). Achamiyy\u0101. Some include the Indus, but it is not of the same sanctity.\u00b9\n\nEach of these rivers as dedicated to one of these deities, has peculiar characteristics ascribed to it: Some of the places situated on their banks are esteemed holy, as, for example, the village of Soron on the Ganges, to which multitudes flock on the twelfth of the month of Aghan (Nov.-Dec.). Some regard certain cities as dedicated to the divinities. Among these are K\u0101si, commonly called Benares. The adjacent\n\n\u00b9 Sacred rivers\u2014An earlier list of names is given in Alberuni's India (Sachau's trans.), i. 257-262. Abul Fazl's transliteration of Sanskrit geographical names is even more puzzling than Alberuni's and any attempt to identify the doubtful names must be largely conjectural.\n\nKausiki, evidently the Kosi in North Bihar, and therefore Abul F.'s location of it \"near Rhotas in the Panjab\" is incorrect; he probably confounded it with Rohtas in south Bihar, near which there is no sacred river. \"Garhi is a pargana of Purnia (N. Bihar) through which the Kosi flows.\" A. F.'s Nand\u0101vati\u2014Alberuni's Nandan\u0101, A. F.'s P\u0101rvat\u012b=Alberuni's Par\u0101 and P\u0101vani, probably the Parvati river (a tributary of the Bias) in the Kangra district, or a lesser river of the same name in M\u0101lwa. Satyavat\u012b of A. F.=Sailod\u0101 of Alberuni. But Jarrett suggests that it is \"the same as the Kausiki, because Satyavati the mother of Jamadagni (the father of Parasur\u0101ma) became the Kausiki river.\" On this view Abul F.'s Kausiki cannot be the Kosi of North Bihar, but the Kausik\u0101, \"one of the seven mouths of the God\u0101vari, branching off from the Gautami, near Mandapalle.\" A. F.'s B\u0101had\u0101=Alberuni's B\u0101hud\u0101sa (probably a mistake for the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 near M\u0101lda or for the Bhadr\u0101, which joins the Tung\u0101 in the Deccan). A. F.'s Parna Son\u0101 stands for the Son river (the name of which means gold, son\u0101), Parn\u0101 being the old name of Panna (popularly called Jharn\u0101-Parn\u0101) through which State the Son flows. For P\u0101\u015bavat\u012b (Alberuni's Pis\u0101vika) I suggest the Pamp\u0101-nadi in Travancore, or more probably the Pamp\u0101 lake near old Vijaynagar. A. F.'s Vanjara is evidently a mistake for the Manjar\u0101 river, a tributary of the God\u0101vari. For A. F.'s Achamiyy\u0101 I hazard the guess Ujjainia or the river of Ujjain, known as the Sipr\u0101, a very sacred water, which Alberuni gives under its proper name. The T\u0101mr\u0101parni flows in the Tinnevelly district of Madras. (J. Sarkar).\ncountry for five kos around the city is held sacred. Although pilgrimages take place throughout the year, on the Siva-r\u0101tri multitudes resort thither from distant parts and it is considered one of the most chosen places in which to die. Final liberation is said to be fourfold:\u2014(1). S\u0101lokya, passing from the degrees of paradise to Kail\u0101sa. They say that when a man goes to heaven through good works, he must return to earth, but when after various transmigrations, he attains that region, he returns no more. (2). S\u0101rupya (assimilation to the deity); when a man partakes of the divine elementary form, he does not revisit the earth. (3). S\u0101nipya (nearness to the deity) is when a man after breaking the elemental bonds, by the power of good works is admitted into the presence of God\u2019s elect, and does not return to earth. (4). S\u0101yujya (absorption into the deity); after passing through all intermediate stages, he obtains the bliss of true liberation. They have likewise divided the territory of Benares into four kinds. The characteristic of two parts is that when a being dies therein, he attains the fourth degree of Mukti; if he dies in one of the others, he reaches the third degree, and if in the remaining one, the second degree.\n\nAyodhy\u0101, commonly called Awadh. The distance of forty kos to the east, and twenty to the north is regarded as sacred ground. On the ninth of the light half of the month of Chaitra a great religious festival is held.\n\nAvantik\u0101, Ujjain. All around it for thirty-two kos is accounted holy and a large concourse takes place on the Siva-r\u0101tri.\n\nK\u0101nchi (Conjevaram) in the Dekhan. For twenty kos around it is considered sacred.

On the Diw\u0101li\u2075 festival, crowds resort hither.\n\nM\u0101y\u0101, known as Haridv\u0101ra (Hardwar) on the Ganges. It is held sacred for eighteen kos in length. Large numbers of pilgrims assemble on the 10th of Chaitra.\n\nThese seven are called the seven (sacred) cities.\n\nPray\u0101ga now called Illah\u0101b\u0101s. The distance for twenty kos around is venerated. They say that the desires of a man that dies here are gratified in his next birth. They also hold that whoever commits suicide is guilty of a great crime except in this spot where it meets with exceeding reward. Throughout the year it is considered holy, but especially so during the month of M\u0101gha (Jan.-Feb.).\n\nNagarkot.\u2076 For eight kos round it is venerated. On the eighth of the months of Chaitra and K\u0101rttika, many pilgrims assemble.\n\nK\u0101shmir is also accounted of this class and is dedicated to Mah\u0101deva. Many places in it are held in great veneration.\n\nThe second are the shrines of the Asuras, which are\n\n---\n\n\u2074 The former is the anniversary of the birth of Krishna, i.e., adding 15 days of the light half to 8 of the dark half, making it the 23rd day.

In many things they share the privileges of the devat\u0101s; but the latter are more pure, while the others are filled with the principle of tama\u015b (darkness). Their temples are said to be in the lower regions (P\u0101t\u0101la).\n\nThe third are called Arsha, or shrines of the great Rishis, men who by virtue of austerities and good works are in near proximity to the deity. [180] Their shrines are counted by thousands. Amongst them are Nimkh\u0101r (Nimish\u0101ra), Pukhra (Pushkara), Khush\u0101b, and Baddiri.\n\nThe fourth are called M\u0101nusha, or appertaining to men who by their power of good works are superior to mankind in general, though they do not obtain the rank of the third degree. Their shrines also are numerous. Among them is Kurukshetra, which for forty kos around is considered holy, and numerous pilgrims resort thither during eclipses of the sun and moon.\n\nCeremonies are laid down for each pilgrimage and their various meritorious results are declared.\n\nO THOU! that seekest after divine knowledge, learn wisdom of these Hindu legends! Each particle among created atoms is a sublime temple of worship. May the Almighty deliver mankind from the wanderings of a vain imagination troubled over many things.\n\n---\n\n7 \"Brahm\u0101, then, being desirous of creating the four orders of being termed gods, demons, progenitors, and men, collected his mind into itself; whilst thus concentrated the quality of darkness pervaded his body and thence the demons (the Asuras) were first born, issuing from his thigh.

S.]\nCUSTOMS OF MARRIAGE.\n\nThis is of eight kinds:\n\n1. Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The girl's father with other elders of the family visit the bridegroom and bring him to his house where the relations assemble. Then the grandfather, or brother, or any other male relation, or the mother, says before the company:\u2014\"I have bestowed such and such a maiden upon such and such a man.\" The bridegroom in the presence of the same company gives his consent. Certain incantations are then pronounced and the Homa sacrifice is performed. It is then declared that the girl's mother has borne male children and was of smaller stature than her husband, and that the bridegroom is not impotent, and both parties declare that they have not been subject to leprosy, phthisis, dyspepsia, hemorrhoids, piles, chronic issue of blood, deformity of limb, or epilepsy. At the nuptials an attendant of the bride washes the feet of the bride and bridegroom and draws the sectarial marks upon them. Three vessels filled severally with rice and curds, after certain incantations have been pronounced, are then given to them to eat. When this is concluded they are dressed out and taken to a retired chamber and a curtain is hung between the bride and bridegroom. The father takes each of the young people and turns them facing the east and\n\n---\n\n9 For Hindu marriages, see Hastings, viii. 449-454.\n\n10 I do not find this condition. It might possibly mean inferior in caste but in that sense Abul Fazl uses safl. Manu requires a bridegroom to avoid the ten following families whatever their wealth in gold or kine, viz., the family which has omitted prescribed acts of religion; that which has produced no male children; that in which the Veda has not been read; that which has thick hair on the body; and those subject to hemorrhoids, phthisis, dyspepsia, epilepsy, leprosy and albinism, also a girl with reddish hair, a deformed limb, troubled with habitual sickness; and one with no hair or too much, and immoderately talkative and with inflamed eyes. She must not bear the name of a constellation, of a tree, of a river, of a barbarous nation, of a mountain, of a winged creature, a snake, or a slave. She must have no defect, walk like a goose or an elephant, have hair and teeth of moderate quantity and length, and have exquisite softness of person. M. III. 7, 8, 9, 10.\na Br\u0101hma\u1e47 repeats certain prayers and places in the hand of each some rice and five betel-nuts. The curtain is then removed and they present to each other what they hold in their hands. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47 next places the two hands of the bride in those of the bridegroom and repeats certain prayers and then reverses the ceremony; after which he binds them both with loose-spun cotton thread, and the girl's father taking [P. 181] her hand gives her to the bridegroom and says, 'May there be ever participation between you and this nursling of happiness in three things\u2014in good works, in worldly goods, and tranquillity of life.' Finally, a fire is lit and the pair are led round it seven times, and the marriage is completed. Until this is done, the engagement may be lawfully cancelled.\n\n2. Daiva (of the Devas). At the time of a sacrifice, all is given away in alms and a maiden is bestowed on the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 performing the sacrifice. The betrothal is then made and the other ceremonies are conducted as aforesaid.\n\n3. Arsha (of the Rishis). This rite takes place when a pair of kine have been received from the bridegroom.\n\n4. Pr\u0101j\u0101patya (of the Praj\u0101patis). The man and woman are brought together and united by this bond.\n\n5. Asura (of the Asuras). The maiden is received in marriage after as much wealth has been presented to her kinsmen (as the suitor can afford).\n\n6. Gandharva (of the Gandharvas). The pair enter\u2014\n\n---\n\n11 Properly in seven steps. The marriage is not completed till the seventh step is taken. Manu, VIII. 227, and note. Hopkins.\n\n12 \"The gift of the maiden is called the Pr\u0101j\u0101patya rite (when made) after reverencing and addressing (the pair) with the words, 'together do ye both your duty.'\" Ibid. 30. The Arsha rite is the commonest form now. Burnell.\n\n13 A recognised sale is here meant. This form is practised at the present day by people claiming to be Br\u0101hma\u1e47s, e.g., the Saiva Br\u0101hma\u1e47s called Gurukkal in Southern India, who seldom can get wives for less than a thousand rupees. It often happens that low caste girls are palmed off upon them. Manu, III. 31, n. 2.\ntain a mutual affection and are voluntarily united in wedlock without the knowledge of others.\n\n7. R\u0101kshasa (of the R\u0101kshasas), is the forcible seizure and abduction of a girl from her people by the ravisher to his own house and there marrying her.\n\n8. P\u0101s\u0101cha (of the P\u012bs\u0101chas). This rite receives this name when the lover secretly approaches a girl when asleep or intoxicated or disordered in mind.\n\nEverywhere there is some difference in the preliminary betrothals, but the concluding ceremonies are after the manner above described. The four rites are lawful for a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a; and besides the second, all are within his privilege. The fifth is lawful to Vaisya or a Sudra; the sixth and seventh for a K\u1e63atriya. The eighth is held disgraceful by all.\n\nA dower is not mentioned in the case of Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and divorce is not customary: In the former ages of the world, it was the rule for B\u0101hmins to take wives from among all the castes, while the other three castes considered it unlawful to wed a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a woman. The same practice obtained between all superior and inferior castes reciprocally. In the present Kali Yuga no one chooses a wife out of his own caste, nay, each of these four being subdivided into various branches, each subdivision asks in marriage only the daughters of their own equals.\n\nAlthough there are numerous classes of Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the noblest by descent are from the (seven) Rishis, K\u0101syapa, Atri, Bharadv\u0101ja, Visv\u0101-mitra, Got\u0101ma, Angiras, and Pulastya. Each of these has numerous ramifications. [P. 182] When any member of one of these families attains to any worldly and spiritual eminence and becomes the founder of any class of institutes, his posterity are called by his name. The family\n\n---\n\n12 The Satapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata differ a little from the text and from each other; in Manu they are reckoned as ten. The seven Rishis form in Astronomy, the Great Bear. Monier Williams, S. D.\ncaste of each is called *Kula* (Hindi *kul*) or *gotra*,\\(^{15}\\) (Hindi *gotar*), and the rule is that if a youth and maid be of the same *gotra*, however distant be the relationship, their marriage is unlawful; but if one be of a separate *kula*, they may lawfully marry. Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras are dependent for their marriage ceremony on a family priest (*purohita*), and each class has a special Br\u0101hma\u1e47 from one of the seven lines of descent. If the maid and the youth have their several family priests belonging to the same *kula*, their marriage is held unlawful. When united in marriage, the wife leaves her own *gotra* and enters that of her husband.\n\nWhen the betrothal is first proposed the lines of paternal and maternal ancestry of both the woman and the man are scrutinised. In computing either of the two genealogies, if within each fifth degree of ascent the lines unite, the marriage is not lawful. Also if in the two paternal genealogies, they unite in any generation, the marriage cannot take place. Scrutiny of the maternal descent on both sides is not necessary. If in the paternal genealogies of both parties, consanguinity through a female occurs in the eighth generation, it is held lawful, but if in the paternal lines of both, consanguinity through a female occurs in the sixth generation it constitutes a fresh (impediment of) kinship. The same result occurs if the consanguinity occurs in the sixth generation by the mother's side.\n\nUntil the elder brother is married, the younger may not lawfully be so.\n\nIt is held expedient that the bride should not be under eight,\\(^{16}\\) and any age over ten is thought improper. The man\n\n\\(^{15}\\) Among the Br\u0101hmans, twenty-four *gotras* are reckoned, supposed to be sprung from and named after celebrated teachers, as S\u0101ndilya, K\u0101syapa, Gautama, Bharad-v\u0101ja, &c. *Ibid.*\n\n\\(^{16}\\) \"A man aged thirty years, may marry a girl of twelve, if he find one dear to his heart, or a man of twenty-four years, a damsel of eight; but if he should finish his studentship earlier and the duties of his next order would otherwise be impeded, let him marry immediately.\" M. IX, 94. Sir W. Jones.\nshould be twenty-five, and marriage after fifty years of age, they regard as unbecoming. Excepting in the king, it is not considered right for a man to have more than one wife, unless his first wife is sickly or proves barren, or her children die. In these cases, he may marry ten wives, but if the tenth proves defective, he may not marry again. If his first wife is suitable, and he desires to take another, he must give the first a third part of his estate.\n\nIt was the custom in ancient times for the daughters of kings when they sought a husband, to hold a great festival. Her suitors were assembled together and the damsel attended the banquet in person. Of whomsoever she made choice, she placed upon his neck a string of pearls and flowers. [183] This custom was called Svayamvara, or self-choice.17\n\nQuando mulier mensium suorum expers sit quod post quatriduum contingit, si maritus ejus intra duodecim dies proximos in quibus satis probabilis est conceptus, ineat eam, necesse est illi perlutum esse.

Y\u0101jnavalkya and others permit it when there are no relatives to give away the girl in marriage.

The sleeves of some reach to the fingers, of others to the elbows. A jacket without a skirt called angiy\u0101 (Sansk. angik\u0101) was chiefly worn, and instead of drawers, a lahang\u0101 which is a waist-cloth joined at both ends with a band sewn at the top through which the cord passes for fastening. It is also made in other forms. Others wear the dandiy\u0101 which is a large sheet worn over the lahang\u0101, part of which is drawn over the head and the other end fastened at the waist.

Indica, and is not a native of Hindustan, but domesticated. The seeds are largely used in cookery, and in Bengal are named Kala jira or black Cumin-seed. The flower has a calyx of delicate fibres dishevelled in appearance and is commonly known as \"Love-in-mist.\" From the specimen Dr. King has been good enough to send me, the ornament imitates the appearance admirably.\nthe nose. (15). *Laung*, an ornament for the nose in the shape of a clove. (16). *Nath* is a golden circlet with a ruby between two pearls, or other jewels. It is worn in the nostril. (17). *Guluband* consists of five or seven rose-shaped buttons of gold strung on to silk and worn round the neck. (18). *H\u0101r* is a necklace of strings of pearls inter-connected by golden roses. (19). *H\u0101ns* is a necklace. (20). *Kangan* is a bracelet. [185] (21). *Gajrah*, a bracelet made of gold and pearls. (22). *Jawe*, consisting of five golden barley-corns (*jau*) strung on silk and fastened on each wrist. (23). *Chur*, (a bracelet) worn above the wrist.

(26). *B\u0101zuband*, (armlet); of these there are various kinds. (27). *T\u0101d*, a hollow circle worn on the arm. (28). *Anguthi*, finger ring. Various forms are made. (29). *Chhudr-Khantik\u0101*, golden bells strung on gold wire and twisted round the waist. (30). *Kati-mekhl\u0101*, a golden belt, highly decorative. (31). *Jehar*, three gold rings, as ankle-ornaments. The first is called *Chur\u0101*, consisting of two hollow half-circlets which when joined together form a complete ring. The second is called *dundhani*, and resembles the former only engraved somewhat. The third is called *masuchi* and is like the second but differently engraved. (32). *P\u0101il*, the anklet, called *Khalkh\u0101l* (in Arabic). (34). *Ghungru*, small golden bells, six on each ankle strung upon silk and worn between the *Jehar* and *Khalkh\u0101l*.

(37). *Anwat*, an ornament for the great toe.\n\nAll these ornaments are made either plain or studded with jewels, and are of many styles. What words can express the exquisite workmanship of the trade? Their delicacy and skill is such that the cost of the work is ten *tolahs* for each *tolah* of gold. Her Majesty has suggested\nnew patterns in each kind. A few of these have been represented in plates for illustration. [P. 186]\n\nWORKMEN IN DECORATIVE ART.\n\nIn other countries the jewels are secured in the sockets made for them, with lac, but in Hindustan, it is effected with kundan which is gold made so pure and ductile that the fable of the gold of Parviz which he could mould with his hand becomes credible.22\n\nThe mode of preparation is as follows:\u2014Of a m\u0101sha of gold they draw out a wire eight fingers long and one finger in breadth. Then the wire is coated with a mixture of two parts of the ashes of dried field-cowdung23 and one part of S\u0101mbhar salt, after which it is wrapped in a coarse cloth and covered with clay. This is generally of not more than ten tolahs weight, and it is placed in a fire of four sers of cow-dung which is then suffered to cool down. If there is but little alloy in it, it will become of standard fineness after three fires, otherwise it must be coated with the same mixture and passed through three more fires. It is generally found that three coatings and three fires are sufficient for the purpose. It must then be washed and placed in an earthen vessel filled with limejuice or some other (acid) which is heated to boiling. It is then cleaned and wound round a cane and taken off (when required), and re-heated from time\n\n---\n\n22 This was one of the seven unequalled treasures possessed by Khusrau Parviz. It was said to be a piece of gold that might be held in the hand and as ductile as wax. The others were his throne T\u0101ghdis; his treasure called the B\u0101d\u0101vard, or wind-borne, because being conveyed by sea to the Roman emperor, the vessel was cast upon his shores; his horse shabdiz; his minstrel B\u0101rbud; his minister Sh\u0101hpur, and above all his incomparable wife Shirin.\n\n23 Sargin g\u0101o sahr\u0101i is translated by Blochmann (l. 21) incorrectly the dry dung of the wild cow. It merely means the cowdung picked up in the fields and jungles; in Hindi p\u0101chak and kanda.\n\nS\u0101mbhar, the well-known great salt-lake in the States of Jaipur and Jodhpur.\nto time, and used for setting by means of an iron style and so adheres that it will not become detached for a long period of time. At first the ornament is fashioned quite plain and here and there they leave sockets for the setting of the jewels. These sockets are filled with lac and a little of the gold is inserted above it, and on this the jewel is pressed down. The overflow of the lac is scraped off and it is then weighed. They next cover the lac with the kundan by means of a needle, and finally scrape and polish it with a steel-pointed tool.\n\nThe fee of a skilled artificer for this work is sixty-four d\u0101ms on each tolah.\n\nThe Zarnish\u0101n or gold inlayer, is a workman who cuts silver agate, crystal and other gems in various ways and sets them on gold. He inlays silver and steel with lines of gold and embellishes agates and other stones by engraving and cutting them. On steel and gems, if he uses one tolah of gold, he receives one and a half as his charge; if he inlays on ivory, fish-bone, tortoise-shell, rhinoceros-horn or silver, his charge for every tolah of gold is one tolah of the same.\n\nThe Koftgar or gold-beater, inlays on steel and other metals, markings more delicate than the teeth of a file, and damascenes with gold and silver wire. He receives one hundred d\u0101ms for each tolah of gold and sixty for a tolah of silver. His work is principally on weapons.\n\nThe Min\u0101k\u0101r or enameller, works on cups, flagons, rings and other articles with gold and silver. He polishes his delicate enamels separately on various colours, sets them in their suitable places and puts them to the fire. This is done several times. His charge is sixteen d\u0101ms for each tolah of gold, and seven for a tolah of silver.\n\nThe S\u0101dah-k\u0101r, a plain goldsmith, fashions gold-work and other articles [187] of gold and silver. His charge is five and a half d\u0101ms on every tolah of gold and two for every tolah of silver.\nThe Shabakah-k\u0101r executes pierced-work in ornaments and vessels. His charge is double that of the S\u0101dah-k\u0101r.\n\nThe Munabbat-k\u0101r works plain figures or impressions on a gold ground, so that they appear in relief. His charge is ten d\u0101ms for a tolah of gold and four for a tolah of silver.\n\nThe Charm-k\u0101r incrusts granulations of gold and silver like poppy-seeds on ornaments and vessels. For every tolah weight of golden grains his charge is one rupee, and half of this for silver.\n\nThe Sim-b\u0101f or plaiter of silver, draws out gold and silver wire and plaits them into belts for swords, daggers and the like. He receives twenty-four d\u0101ms on a tolah of gold and sixteen for a tolah of silver.\n\nThe Saw\u0101d-k\u0101r grinds a black composition (saw\u0101d) and lays it smoothly over traceries of gold and then polishes the ground evenly with a file. The saw\u0101d consists of gold, silver, copper, lead and sulphur mixed together in certain proportions. The work is of several kinds. The finest is on gold and the charge is two rupees per tolah of saw\u0101d. For the middling kind, the charge is one rupee, and for the lowest, eight annas.\n\nThe Zar-kob or gold beater, makes gold and silver leaf.\n\nLapidaries, metal casters, and other artificers produce designs which excite astonishment, but this exposition is already sufficiently protracted. Artists of all kinds are constantly employed at the Imperial Court where their work is subjected to the test of criticism.

Munabbat comes from the Arabic root 'nabt' and is pass. part. of II. conj., 'to cause to grow out'; hence repousse-work.\n\n25 Charm signifies leather and the granulated kind of it called kimukht or shagreen (from the Pers. S\u0101ghari) would represent the style of work which the text refers to. The granulation of the shagreen is produced by embedding in the leather when it is soft, the seeds of a kind of chenopodium and afterwards shaving down the surface. The green colour is produced by the action of salammoniac on copper filings.\nCEREMONIES AT CHILDBIRTH.\n\nAs soon as a child is born, the father bathes himself in cold water, worships the deities and performs the Sraddha ceremonies, and stirring some honey and ghee together with a gold ring, puts it into the infant's mouth. The midwife then cuts the umbilical cord, and immediately upon its severance the whole family become unclean. In this state they refrain from the Homa sacrifice and the worship of the deities and from repeating the gayatri and many other ceremonies, contenting themselves with interior remembrance of the Deity. If this takes place in a Br\u0101hman's family, his children and relations to the fourth degree of consanguinity are ceremonially unclean for ten days; the relations of the fifth degree, for six days; those of the sixth degree, for four days; of the seventh, for three; of the eighth for one day and night, and those of the ninth continue so for four pahrs.\n\nAt the close of these periods they are freed after ablution of the body. But the usual rule is that a Br\u0101hman together with his kindred to the seventh degree, are unclean for ten days; a Kshatriya, for twelve days; a Vaisya and the superior class of Sudra for fifteen days, and the inferior Sudras for thirty days. During this time strangers avoid associating or eating with them. This state is called Sutaka (impurity from childbirth). A prince and his attendants, his physician, cook, overseer, and other servants of the crown are not subjected to this condition, but on the sixth day certain prayers are offered to the Deity and rejoicings are made, and the mother and child are bathed.\n\nThe day after the expiration of the Sutaka, they name the child and look in the astronomical table for the sign and station of the rising of the moon. The initial of his name is\n\n---\n\n26 By these are meant the Ahir and Kurmi castes or shepherds and agriculturists, from whose hands Br\u0101hmans and Kshatriyas will drink, the inferior Sudras being Cham\u0101rs and the like who are held unclean.\ntaken from the letter which is therewith connected\\textsuperscript{27} and a name of more than four letters is considered blameworthy. In the fourth month they bring it into the sun before which time it is never carried out of the house. In the fifth month they bore the lobe of the right ear. In the sixth month, if the child be a boy, they place various kinds of food around him, and feed him with that for which he shows a preference. If it be a girl, this is not done till the sixth or seventh month. When it is a year old, or in the third year, they shave his head, but by some this is delayed till the fifth year, by others till the seventh, and by others again till the eighth year, when a festival is held. In the fifth year they send him to school and meet together in rejoicing.\n\nThey observe the birthday and annually celebrate it with a feast, and at the close of each year make a knot on a thread of silk. He is invested with the sacred string at the appointed time. At each of these occasions they perform certain works and go through some extraordinary ceremonies.\n\nThe number of Festivals.\n\nCertain auspicious days are religiously observed and celebrated as festivals. These are called te'oh\u0101r and a few of them are here indicated.\n\n\\textsuperscript{27} This requires explanation. The day is divided into 60 dandas=24 hours, the four divisions of which allow 15 dandas to every six hours. Now each of the 28 asterisms (v. p. 21) is symbolised by a fanciful name of four letters; e.g., the first asterism \u0100s\u016bni is called chu, che, cho, l\u0101, the second Bharani lo, lu, le, l\u0101. To each of the periods of six hours a letter is allotted, as chu from 6 A.M. to noon, che from noon to 6 P.M., cho from 6 P.M. to midnight, and l\u0101 from midnight to 6 A.M. A child born in the first period has a name beginning with chu, as Chur\u0101mani: in the second with che, as Chet-R\u0101m, and so on. This is termed the r\u0101si name from Sanskrit r\u0101si, the passage of any planet through a sign of the Zodiac. A second name is subsequently given when the child is two or three, at the fancy of the parents without any ceremonial observance. Thus a man's r\u0101si name will be Panna L\u0101l, and the name by which he is generally called, D\u0101modar. This practice is mostly confined to the more cultivated classes.\nDuring the month of Chaitra (March-April, Hind. Chait) eight occur:\u2014[P. 189] (1). Srishty\u0101di,\u00b2\u2078 the first lunar day of the light half of the month. (2). Nava-r\u0101tra (Hind. Nau-r\u0101tr); the nine first nights of the year are chiefly employed in ceremonial worship and prayer and pilgrims from afar assemble at Nagarkot (K\u0101ngra) and other places dedicated to the worship of Durga. (3). Sri-panchami, the fifth lunar day (of the light half of the month). (4). Asok\u0101shtami,\u00b2\u2079 the eighth of the light half of the month. (5). R\u0101ma-navam\u012b, ninth day of the light half of the month, the birthday of R\u0101ma. (6). Chaturdasa (Hind. Chaudas) the fourteenth. (7). Purna-m\u0101sa (Hind. Purnam\u0101si), the fifteenth. (8). Pariv\u0101 (Sansk. Pratipada) the sixteenth calculating from the Suklapaksha or light fortnight, or counting from Krishna-paksha (dark fortnight), the 1st, and according to the computation by which the beginning of the month is taken from Krishna-paksha, this day will fall in the beginning of the second month which is Vais\u0101kha. Therefore with those who hold this view, the festival will occur on the 1st of Krishna-paksha which preceded the aforesaid Suklapaksha,\u00b3\u2070 and so with all the festivals that fall in Krishna-paksha, the difference of a month one way or the other arises between the two methods of calculation.\n\n\u00b2\u2078 The transliteration is incorrect. The luni-solar year of Vikram\u0101ditya begins from this festival.\n\u00b2\u2079 Asoka is the tree Jonesia Asoka which is held sacred. In a grove of these trees Sita, the wife of R\u0101ma, was imprisoned in Lanka by R\u0101vana. R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a; Sundar K\u0101nda.\n\u00b3\u2070 Cf. p. 17, Vol. II. The two modes of reckoning, viz., by the mukhya ch\u0101ndra or principal lunar month which ends with the conjunction, and the gauna-ch\u0101ndra or secondary lunar month which ends with the opposition, are both authorized by the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. The latter mode begins the month with the Krishna-paksha or dark half of the month, in which differences of reckoning occur; the Suklapaksha or light half from which the mukhya-ch\u0101ndra reckoning begins, is the same, of course, for both modes, and therefore no difference can arise. Cf. Sir W. Jones. \"Lunar months of the Hindus.\" Works I. 374.\nDuring Vais\u0101kha (April-May) there are four:\u2014(1). Tij (Sansk. Tritiya), during the third lunar day of the light fortnight, the birthday of Parasur\u0101ma. (2). Saptami, the seventh. (3). Chaturdasi, the fourteenth, the birthday of Nara-Sinha. (4). Am\u0101vasa, the thirtieth.\n\nDuring the month of Jyeshtha (Hind. Jeth, May-June), there are three:\u2014(1). Chaturthi, the fourth lunar day. (2). Navami, the ninth. (3). Dasami, the tenth which is called Dasa-har\u0101.31\n\n[190] In the month of Ash\u0101dha (Hind. As\u0101h, June-July), the seventh, eighth and eleventh, and according to some the fifteenth.32\n\nIn the month of Sr\u0101vana (Hind. S\u0101wan, July-Aug.) three:\u2014(1). Purnam\u0101sa, the fifteenth of the light half of the month. This is the greatest festival with the Br\u0101hmans throughout the year upon which they fasten the amulet called raksha-bandhana on the right wrists of the principal people. It is a cord of silk and the like, decorated by some with jewels and pearls. (2). (N\u0101ga-panchami)33 the fifth of the light fortnight.\n\nIn the month of Bh\u0101dra-pada (Hind. Bh\u0101don, Aug.-Sept.) there are five; the fourth, fifth, sixth, twelfth, and\n\n---\n\n31 Vulg. Dusserah. There are two festivals, viz., that in the text, which is the birthday of Ganga, in which whoever bathes in the Ganges is said to be purified from ten sorts of sins, and the second on the 10th of Asvin Sukla-paksha (Hind. Ku\u0101r, Sept.-Oct.) in honour of Durga. This worship continues for nine nights, and images of Devi are thrown into the river. R\u0101ma is said to have marched against R\u0101vana on this day and hence it is called Vijay-dasami or the Victorious Tenth. It is held as a most auspicious day for all undertakings and especially for operations of war.\n\n32 This is called the Vy\u0101sa-puja, in honour of Vy\u0101sa the divider of the Vedas. He is supposed to be represented on this festival by the teachers or gurus.\n\n33 Abul Fazl has omitted the name. A snake is worshipped on this day to preserve children from their bites. The text also omits altogether the third festival, the Sr\u0101vani, held by Br\u0101hmans only, spent in reading the Vedas and bathing, and changing the sacred thread.\ntwenty-third. The latter is the birthday of Krishna. Some hold this to be on the eighth of (the dark half of) Sravana.\\(^{34}\\)\n\nIn the month of Asvin there are two. As aforesaid (in the month of Chaitra) nine nights are accounted holy and the tenth (of the light fortnight) is called Dasa-har\u0101. According to their writings the festival previously mentioned is called Dasa-har\u0101 and this is known as the Vijay-dasami. On this day they pay particular attention to their horses and decorate them and place green sprouts of barley on their heads, and all workmen venerate their tools, and it is held as a great festival and particularly for the Kshatriyas. (Another) they call Sraddha-Kanya-gata\\(^{35}\\) on the fifteenth of Krishna-paksha of the month of Asvin by common consent, but those who compute the beginning of the month from its Krishna-paksha place it in the month preceding. During these fifteen days (of the dark fortnight) they give alms in the name of their deceased ancestors, either in money or kind, as has been related.\n\nIn the month of K\u0101rttika (Oct.-Nov.) there are six. The 1st or pariv\u0101. This is called Balir\u0101jya or the principality of Bali.\\(^{36}\\) On this day they deck themselves and their cattle and buffaloes.\n\n\\(^{34}\\) That is, with those who take the beginning of the month from Krishna-paksha of Sravana or Bh\u0101dra-pada, it will fall on the 8th; with those who begin with the following Sukla-paksha of Bh\u0101dra-pada, it will fall on the 23rd of Bh\u0101dra-Asvin, making the difference of the month as before stated. The festival of the fourth is called Ganeshcha-chaturthi, the birthday of Ganesha. The fifth is Rishi-panchami, a fast in honour of the Rishis. The sixth is called Lalit\u0101 Shashthi, and in Hindi Lalhi chhat and also Gayhat as Albiruni observes (XVI). In Kanauj it is known by the latter name.\n\n\\(^{35}\\) Kany\u0101-gata is the dark lunar fortnight of this month and the name and period mark the position of a planet, especially Jupiter in the sign Virgo (Kanya).\n\n\\(^{36}\\) This is the name of the Daitya prince whom Vishnu subdued in the dwarf incarnation. A great deal of gambling goes on for three nights. They give alms and bathe and make presents of areca nuts to each other. It is said that Lakshmi, wife of Vasudeva, once a year on this day liberates Bali from the nether world and allows him to go about the earth. Cf. Albiruni.\nThe second, ninth, eleventh and twelfth are also festivals. The thirtieth is the Dip\u0101li or row of lamps (Hind. Diw\u0101li). A difference occurs in the calculation of its date. According to the Sukla-paksha computation, it is as above stated, but by the Krishna-paksha this is called the 15th of M\u0101rgasirsha (Hind. Aghan, Nov.-Dec.) and they therefore hold this festival on the 15th of the Krishna-paksha of K\u0101rttika. Lamps are lit as on the (Muhammedan) festival of Shab-i-bar\u0101t. It begins on the 29th, and this night is considered auspicious for dicing and many strange traditions are told regarding it. It is the greatest of the festivals for the Vaisya caste.\n\nIn the month of M\u0101rgasirsha, there are three viz., the seventh of Sukla-paksha and the eighth and ninth of Krishna-paksha. In both these last a difference of computation as above occurs.\n\nIn the month of Pausha (Hind. Pus, Dec.-Jan.) the eighth of Sukla-paksha is held sacred.\n\nIn the month of M\u0101gha (Jan.-Feb.) there are four, viz., the third, [191] fourth, fifth and seventh. On the fifth a great festival is held called Vasanta in which they throw different coloured powders upon each other, and sing songs.\n\nThis is the beginning of the spring among the Hindus. Although this is much regarded among the people, yet in old works the seventh was considered the greater festival.\n\nIn the month of Ph\u0101lguna (Feb.-March) there are two. The fifteenth of Sukla-paksha is called the Holi\\(^{37}\\) and extends from the 13th to the 17th. They light fires and throw various articles into them and fling coloured powder upon each other.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{37}\\) 'Holik\u0101' is said to be the name of a female R\u0101kshasi, killed and burnt by Siva on this day, but her penitence for the fault of a too turbulent disposition secured for her the promise of this annual celebration in her remembrance, and that all who perform this worship, in this month, would be prosperous for the year. See M\u0101h\u0101tmya of Ph\u0101lguna, which quotes the Bhavishya Pur\u0101\u1e47a. Songs are sung in honour of Krishna of the broadest and coarsest kind.\nand indulge in much merriment. It is a great festival among the Sudras. The night and day of the 29th are held sacred: the night is called Siva-r\u0101tri. Some make this occur on the 14th of Krishna-paksha and by this computation the Siva-r\u0101tri falls on the 14th of the dark fortnight of Ph\u0101lguna, a month earlier. They keep the night in vigil, narrating wonderful legends. The Br\u0101hmans also consider five days in each month sacred, the 8th, 14th, 15th and 30th, and Sankr\u0101nti which is the day on which the sun passes from one Zodiacial sign into another.\n\nRegarding the celebration of the various festivals marvellous legends are told, and they are the subject of entertaining narratives.\n\nCEREMONIES AT DEATH.\n\nWhen a person is near unto death, they take him off his bed and lay him on the ground and shave his head, except in the case of a married woman, and wash the body. The Br\u0101hmans read some prayers over him and alms are given. They then plaster the ground with cowdung and strew it over with green grass and lay him down at full length face upwards, with his head to the north and his feet to the south. If a river or tank be hard by, they place him up to his middle in water. When his dissolution is at hand they put into his mouth Ganges water, gold, ruby, diamond and pearl, and give away a cow in charity, and place upon his breast a leaf of the Tulasi (Ocymum sanctum) which they hold sacred, and draw the sectarial mark on his forehead with a particular kind of earth.\n\n38 V. p. 298, n. 2. It is mentioned in some Dictionaries as occurring on the 14th of the dark half of M\u0101gha, but this is also counted as Ph\u0101lguna by those who begin the month with the Krishna-paksha, the same fortnight being either one or the other, according to the order of the primary or secondary lunar months.\n\n39 This is either earth taken from the banks of the Ganges if possible, or ashes from the Homa fire.\nWhen he expires, his youngest son, his brother, and his pupil and particular friends shave their heads and beards. Some defer this till the tenth day. The body dressed in its loin-cloth is wrapped in a sheet. The corpse of a married woman is dressed in the clothes she wore in life. The body is borne to the river side and a funeral pile of Pal\u0101sa-wood (Butea frondosa) is formed, upon which the body is laid. Prayers are read over ghee, which is put into the mouth and a few grains of gold are put into the eyes, nostrils, ears and other apertures. It is advisable that the son should set fire to the pile, otherwise the youngest brother of the deceased or, failing him, the eldest. All his wives deck themselves out and with cheerful countenances are burnt together with him in their embrace. A pile of lignum aloes and sandalwood is fired for those who are wealthy. The wives are first advised not to give their bodies to the flames. [P. 192]\n\nThis mode of expressing grief among Hindu women applies to five classes:\u2014(1). Those who expire on learning the death of their husbands and are burnt by their relations. (2). Those who out of affection for their husbands voluntarily consign themselves to the flames. (3). Who from fear of reproach surrender themselves to be burnt. (4). Who undergo this death regarding it as sanctioned by custom. (5). Who against their will are forced into the fire by their relatives.\n\nIf an ascetic (Sanny\u0101sin) dies or a child that has not yet teathed, the body is consigned to earth or launched into the river, and they do not burn those who disbelieve the Vedas or who are not bound by the rules of any of the four castes, nor a thief, nor a woman who has murdered her husband, nor an evil liver, nor a drunkard.\n\n*The ceremonies of cremation are under the authority of the youngest son, and in his absence, of the eldest. The intervening sons have generally no ceremonial powers. For Sati see Hastings, Encyclo. iv. 428-429, xi. 207 and its later history in Edward Thompson's Sati.*\nIf the corpse cannot be found, an effigy of it is made with flour and leaves of the *Butea frondosa* and reeds covered with deer-skin, a cocoanut serving for the head. Over this prayers are said and it is then burnt.\n\nA pregnant woman is not suffered to be burnt till after her delivery. If the man dies on a journey, his wives burn themselves with his garments or whatever else may belong to him. Some women whom their relations have dissuaded from burning themselves, or whom their good sense has convinced that burning is a fictitious grief, live afterwards in such unhappiness that death becomes preferable.\n\nOn the day on which the corpse is burnt, the relations and friends repair to the riverside and undo their hair, put on the sacred string across the other shoulder, and bathe themselves and place two handfuls of sesame-seed on the bank. They then collect in any open space and the friends of the deceased after a consolatory address to the mourners, accompany them home, the younger members of the family walking in front and the elders following. When they reach the door of the house, they chew a bit of Nimba leaf (Hind. *Nim*, *Melia Azadirachta*) and then enter.\n\nOn the fourth day after the death of a Br\u0101hman, the fifth after the death of a Kshatriya, the ninth and tenth after that of a Vaisya and Sudra respectively, the person who had set fire to the funeral pile, proceeds to the place, performs some ceremonies, and collecting the ashes and remnants of bones together, throws them into the Ganges. If the river be at any distance, he places them in a vessel and buries them in the jungle, and, at a convenient time, exhumes them, puts them into a bag of deer-skin and conveys them to the stream, and concludes with certain ceremonies.\n\nIf the deceased is a Br\u0101hman, all his relations for ten days sleep on the ground on a bed of grass and eat only what is sent to them, or what may be procured from the market (cooking nothing for themselves).\nDuring ten days, the person who had fired the pile cooks some rice and milk and makes an offering of it as nourishment to the new body of the deceased. When the natural body dies, the soul takes a subtle frame which they call *Preta*.\\(^1\\) Their belief is that while it is invested with this body, it cannot enter Paradise, and during the space of ten days this body continues in being. Subsequently, on the conclusion of certain ceremonies, it abandons this form and assumes another fitted for Paradise, and by the performance of manifold works, it finally receives its heavenly body. For other castes the time of detention (in the *Preta*) continues throughout their respective *Sutaka* periods.\n\nSome further ceremonies for Br\u0101hmans and others take place on the eleventh and twelfth days also. [P. 193]\n\nIf a Br\u0101hman dies out of his own house and information of his death is received within ten days of it, his family during the remaining period of those days, continue unclean. If the news arrives after the ten days, they are unclean for three days, but his son, at whatever time he hears of it, is unclean for ten days. If the death take place before investiture with the sacred string, or (if a child) before it has teathed, or is of seven months, the impurity lasts one day, and is removed by bathing. If the deceased child be above this age up to two years old, the impurity lasts one day and night; from the time of cutting the hair to that of investiture with the sacred thread, three days and nights. For the death of a daughter up to ten years of age, ablution suffices to purify. After that age till the time of proposal when she is betrothed before marriage, there is one day\u2019s impurity. After betrothal, the father\u2019s family and that of the suitor are unclean for three days.\n\n\\(^1\\) This is properly the spirit of the deceased before the obsequial rites are performed and is supposed still to haunt its abode. Hastings, *Ency.* ii. 810.\nMERITORIOUS MANNER OF DEATH:\n\nThe most efficacious kinds of death are five:\u2014(1). Abstaining from food and drink till dissolution. (2). Covering the person with broken dried cowdung like a quilt or pall, and at the feet setting it on fire which creeps gradually from the toe-nails to the hair of the head, while the mind is fixed on divine contemplation till death. (3). Voluntarily plunging into snow. (4). At the extremity of Bengal where the Ganges divided into a thousand channels falls into the sea, the foe of his carnal desires wades into the sea, and confessing his sins and supplicating the Supreme Being, waits till the alligators come and devour him. (5). Cutting the throat at Illahabas at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jamuna.\n\nEach of these modes is described with its appropriate details.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nCOMERS INTO INDIA.\n\nForasmuch as the fenced city of tradition is unfrequented and the wastes of legend are stony places, knowledge that seeks after truth kept me from connection therewith, but the decree of fate unexpectedly drew me from silence into speech, and intent on freshening the interest of my narrative, I have been led into entering upon a multiplicity of details. A review of the general history of Hindustan has induced me to mention the comers into this vast country, and thus by recalling the memory of the great give a promise of currency to this important exposition.\n\nADAM.\n\nThey say that Adam after his fall from Paradise was thrown on the island of Ceylon, his consort on Juddah, Azr\u0101'il in Sist\u0101n, the Serpent in Isp\u0101h\u0101n, and the Peacock in\n\n---\n\n1 This is the true orthography, but commonly written Jiddah, on the Red Sea. Azr\u0101'il is the angel of death who though connected with the creation of Adam, having been sent by God to bring various kinds of clay from the earth for the formation of his body, and having fulfilled the mission in which Gabriel and Michael had previously failed, is not mentioned as sharing his sin or punishment. Ibl\u012bs or Satan must be here meant whom the chroniclers unanimously declare to have been cast out of Paradise, though they differ as to the place of his fall, Mas\u0101udi naming Bais\u0101n; and Tabari, Simn\u0101n near Jurj\u0101n. He penetrated into Paradise notwithstanding the vigilance of its porter, by entering the mouth of the serpent that had on one occasion strayed outside. The latter was at that time a quadruped, but being cursed at the fall, was deprived of its feet and condemned to the form of a reptile. The peacock is said to have conducted Eve to the forbidden tree. At its expulsion it was deprived of its voice. The relation of these puerilities may be pursued in Tabari, Mas\u0101udi, D'Herbelot. For Adam, Ency. Islam, i. 127 and in Sale's Kor\u0101n, and in most general histories of Muhammadan chroniclers who are never more at home or more precise than when referring to events of which they can know nothing.\nHindustan. Imaginative writers have embellished this fable with abundant details, but in Sanscrit works which treat of the events of myriads of past ages not a trace of this story is to be found.\n\n**HUSHANG**\n\nWas the son of Siy\u0101mak and grandson of Kayumars, and succeeded his great ancestor, ruling with justice and liberality. He is accounted the first to whom the name of sovereign virtually applies.\u00b2 He came to India where he displayed the lustre of virtue. [194] The work called 'Eternal Wisdom' (Javid\u0101n Khirad) is said to be the fruit of his mature experience.\n\nH\u0101fiz,\u00b3 in his *Istit\u0101lah* (*Per illustris*) says that when M\u0101mun conquered Khur\u0101s\u0101n, the various chiefs sent presents to his court. The governor of K\u0101bul sent a sage named Dub\u0101n\u2074 on an embassy to Mamun and mentioned in his letter of homage that he was despatching to his court an offering of great price, than which nothing more valuable was known. The Caliph on receiving this information appointed his minister Fadhl (Ibn-i-Sahl) to inquire what it referred to. The envoy replied that the allusion was to himself. They said to him, \"How doth a distinction so great concern such as thee?\" He answered, \"In enlightened knowledge, judicious counsel, and right guidance,\" and he spoke such parables of wisdom that all were amazed. It happened that at this time the Caliph designed to enter upon hostilities against his brother Muham-mad u'l Amin and all parties were endeavouring to dissuade\n\n---\n\n\u00b2 Firdausi imputes to him the discovery of fire from the concussion of two stones. Hushang obtained by merit or adulation the epithet of Peshd\u0101d or the Lawgiver, when the Peshdadian kings took the name of their dynasty.\n\n\u00b3 See Vol. II, p. 36, n. 4. Of the T\u0101rikh of H\u0101fiz Abru, no copy was known by Sir H. Elliot, to exist in India. The Istit\u0101lah is not mentioned by H\u0101ji Khalifah under that title.\n\n\u2074 The reader will recall the story of the Grecian king and his physician dub\u0101n in the thirteenth of the \"Arabian Nights.\"\nhim from it. He therefore consulted Dub\u0101n, whose clear-\nsighted reasoning confirmed his resolution of marching into\nIr\u0101q and pressing on the war. The sage's advice was the\nmeans of resolving all political difficulties. M\u0101mun treated\nhim with great favour and commanded that a large sum of\ngold should be bestowed upon him. Dub\u0101n excused himself\nsaying, \"It is not the practice of my sovereign to allow his\nenvoy to receive anything, but there is a work called 'Eternal\nWisdom' composed by the farsighted intellect of Hushang\nand is said to be in the Mad\u0101in. On the conquest of that\ncountry, when the Caliph obtains the work let him graciously\nbestow it upon me.\" His proposal was assented to. When\nMad\u0101in was taken, he pointed out that in a certain quarter of\nthe city, by a certain tree there was a large stone. This they\nwere to lift and to dig down till they came to a subterranean\nchamber in which were a number of chests and a large\nquantity of valuables, none of which were to be touched as\nthe time for removing them had not arrived. In a certain\ncorner of the chamber a box of certain shape would be found\nwhich they were to bring out, wherein would be discovered\nthe work they sought. Sharp-eyed and experienced men were\nsent in search, and all happened exactly as he had described.\nSome portion of this work was translated into Arabic at the\npressing insistence of Fadhl, but as it was treasured by Dub\u0101n,\nhe did not suffer its translation to be completed.\n\n5 The original of this collection of moral fables is the Sanskrit\nPanca-tantra, from which were made the Arabic version named\nKalila-wa-Dimna and the Persian translation named Anw\u0101r-i-Suhaili.\nDe Sacy supposes that in this last \"we have the olden J\u0101v\u012bd\u0101n\nKhirad.\" [See Ency. Isl. ii. 694-698. J. S.] Known to Europe\nas the Fables of Pilpay.\n\n6 The ancient Ctesiphon. It passed into the possession of the\nArabs in the Caliphate of Omar in A.D. 637. During the insurrec-\ntion against al Mamun by the Alide party under the leading of\nAbu Saraya, Madain was taken by the latter, but recaptured during\nthe same year, A.D. 815.\nHAM\n\nWas the son of Noah. After the subsidence of the deluge he came to Hindustan. Annalists of other countries than this believe the Hindus to be descended from him.\n\nJAMSHID\n\nWas the son of Tahmuras Devband or the binder of the demons. When by the Almighty decrees he became a wanderer in the desert of misfortune, he happened to pass through Z\u0101bulist\u0101n. For sixteen years he dwelt in Kabul and secretly married the daughter of the prince Kaurnak. When the news was bruited abroad the prince bade him, one night, take his departure for Hindustan. The poet Asadi says of this night: [P. 195]\n\nBlack as an Ethiop grew the night whose veil\nO'er the moon's face its sable shadow flung,\nSad as the stifled sob whose scarce-heard wail\nDies on the ear from some despairing tongue.\n\n7 He receives this surname in the Sh\u0101h N\u0101mah. His justice and vigour cleansed the country of crime, and produced the rebellion of the Devs or demons, probably the barbarous neighbouring peoples who resented his iron control. They were defeated by him and bound. He introduced the solar year among the Persians, the first day of which, when according to Tabari he administered justice in open darbar, was called Nauroz when the sun enters Aries. His prosperity turned his head and he proclaimed himself a deity, which disgusted his subjects and led to the invasion of the Syrian prince Zoh\u0101k, the descendant of Shed\u0101d, and according to some the nephew of Jamshid. Malcolm says that the wanderings of the exiled prince are wrought into a tale which is amongst the most popular in Persian romance. He was pursued through Seist\u0101n, India and China by the agents of Zoh\u0101k and carried before his enemy who, after every contumely he could inflict, placed him between two boards and had him sawn asunder. When the news of his death reached his widow in Seist\u0101n she put an end to her life by poison. The son of this marriage was Atrut, whose son was Garsh\u0101sp, whose son was Narim\u0101n, father of S\u0101m, whose son Z\u0101l was the father of Rustam. See Malcolm, Hist. Persia, I. 3, and Atkinson's Abridgment of the Sh\u0101h N\u0101mah.\n\n8 The quotation must be from the Garsh\u0101sp N\u0101mah of Hakim Asadi of Tus, one of the seven poets at the court of Mahmud of Ghazni.\nFor some time he employed himself in the profession of arms and when his secret was on the point of being discovered, he set out for China by way of Bengal, and on the road fell in with the emissaries of Zoh\u0101k.\n\nZOHAK\n\nWas the son of Mard\u0101s, the Arabian. He passed into India several times as Asadi says:\n\nZoh\u0101k the conqueror ere the year had gone,\nTo K\u0101bul swiftly passed from Babylon,\nResolved to launch o'er India's plains once more\nThe invading legions he had led before.\n\nGARSHASP\n\nWas the son of Utrut.\u2079 The Garsh\u0101sp N\u0101mah narrates his invasion of India and the astonishing actions in which he engaged.\n\nISFANDYAR OF THE BRAZEN BODY\n\nWas the son of Gusht\u0101sp,\u00b9\u2070 the son of Luhr\u0101sp. In obedience to the commands of his father he propagated the doctrines of Zoroaster, and his zeal caused the universal acceptation of that creed. He honoured the institutions which were the bequest of Faridun, applying them after his own direction. Firdausi thus alludes to him:\n\nThis mighty warrior of a line of kings\nFrom clime to clime his rapid conquest wings;\nO'er Greece and India his proud standards fly\nTo unknown seas where realms of darkness lie.\n\n\u2079 Malcolm gives Atrut, but the Dictionaries write the name as I have rendered it. Firdausi makes him the son of Zav. He was the last of the Peshdadian monarchs.\n\n\u00b9\u2070 The conjecture that Gusht\u0101sp was the Darius Hystaspes of the Greeks accords with the chronology of Herodotus; and starting from this first secure footing amid the quicksands of fable, the identification of Isfandyar with Xerxes is historically probable. The arguments in favour of this hypothesis are marshalled by Malcolm.\nNariman, son of Garshasp,\nthe son of Utrut.\n\nSam, son of Nariman.\n\nZal, son of Sam.\n\nFaramarz, son of Rustam.\n\nBahman, son of Isfandyar.\n\nWhen the astrologers announced to Garshasp the future sovereignty of Bahman and the overthrow of his own family, the devastation of Z\u0101bulist\u0101n, the slaughter of the descendants of Rustam, the disentombment of himself and his sons, and the burning of their bodies, he enjoined his sons to erect his tomb and that of his children at Kanauj in Hindustan. When Garshasp died, Narim\u0101n conveyed his remains thither, and on the death of Narim\u0101n his body was also taken to that country by S\u0101m. On S\u0101m's death, Z\u0101l transported his body to the same city whither, likewise, Faramarz carried Rustam when he died. When Bahman defeated Z\u0101l and Faramarz and the latter was killed in the engagement, Bahman overran Z\u0101bulist\u0101n and advanced to Kanauj desiring to view the royal mausoleum. A superstitious awe restrained him from entering it. Each of these four great men in anticipation of this event had left a great treasure within it. Among them was the world-displaying mirror of Kaikhusrau (Cyrus), which at his death [P. 196] he bequeathed to Rustam, and ninety maunds weight of diamonds belonging to Garshasp. Each of them also inscribed on a tablet a brief record of memorable\n\n---\n\n11 Whatever doubt may exist regrading the identification of Xerxes with Isfandy\u0101r, there is little or none regarding that of Bahman with Artaxerxes Longimanus. Bahman was known to the Persian historians as Ardishir Dar\u0101zdast, the similarity of the epithet adding conclusive evidence to the similarity of the name. Firdausi says that 'when he stood upon his feet; his closed hand reached below his knee.'\ndeeds, praying that the conqueror would not desecrate the tomb. Bahman, struck by the sight of these splendid offerings and the prescient sagacity of the gift, fell into a profound melancholy and withdrew from his previous resolve.\n\nFaramarz, indeed, had twice entered this country, for Rustam after his combat with Barzu by whose mace his arm had been disabled, said to Kaikhusrau, \"if my son Faramarz returns this night from India, he will deal with Barzu,\" upon which followed his sudden arrival and the overthrow of the latter.\n\nAlexander of Greece.\n\nWhen Alexander had completed the conquest of Ir\u0101n and Tur\u0101n and laid the foundations of Marv, Her\u0101t and Samarqand, he entered India by Ghaznin and in the neighbourhood of the Panj\u0101b gave battle to the Hindu prince, Porus, who had advanced from Kanauj to engage him, and by stratagem put him to rout. From thence he turned to the country of the Br\u0101hmans. The chiefs of that region represented to him that if the conqueror sought riches and worldly goods they were destitute of these.\n\nWisdom and knowledge dwell with us, nor cease\nTo fill our bosoms with untroubled peace:\nThe earth a couch, the skies their covering lend,\nSo turn our thoughts to our appointed end.12\n\n\"If thy design be the gathering of knowledge and the search for truth, let those who seek it come not in this guise.\" Alexander, therefore, leaving his army, set out at the head of a few followers. A court was held to secure a just hearing and their peculiar views were discussed in audience. The king approved their speech and conduct and announced to them that whatever they desired should be granted. They\n\n---\n\n12 These lines are taken from Firdausi and vary somewhat from the ordinary text, where they are not consecutive. The substance of a great deal of what follows in the reply of the Brahmans, is from the same sources.\nreplied that they had no other wish than that the king should live for ever. He answered that this wish was inconsistent with mortality. They rejoined: \"If the instability of worldly things is so evident to your Majesty, why these fatigues in the tyrannous oppression of mankind?\" Alexander for a space bowed his head in humiliation and imputed his actions to the decrees of fate.\n\nAccording to some Christian writers, when the standards of Alexander were raised on the shores of the Indian Ocean, accounts of the island of the Br\u0101hmans reached him and he determined to take possession of it. They sent an envoy to him and made the following representation:\u2014\"Sovereign ruler of the world! The fame of thy conquests and thy successes has been constantly in our ears, but what can content a man to whom the possession of the world is insufficient? We enjoy no outward splendour, nor bodily vigour that thou shouldst deem us worthy to measure thy prowess in war. The worldly goods that we own are shared in common amongst us, and we are passing rich on what may satisfy our hunger. Our costliest robes are garments worn with age. Our women are not in bondage to adornment for the seduction of hearts, and account no beauty or charm of price, save [197] that inherited from their mothers. Of our lowly habitations we ask but two things, a shelter in life and in death a grave. We have a king for considerations of dignity, not for the administration of justice or law. What\n\n---\n\n13 The term tars\u0101 which I have rendered in its usual acceptation may be also applied to the Zoroastrians. For tars\u0101, see Hastings, Encyclopaedia of Religion, iii. 576. For the general idea of the letters, Abul Fazl is indebted to Firdausi, who in turn in one passage regarding the unprofitable questions put by Alexander to confound the Br\u0101hmans, is in agreement with Plutarch. The jazira or isle of the Br\u0101hmans is perhaps Br\u0101hman\u0101b\u0101d, identified by Genl. Cunningham as the town where Ptolemy was wounded by a poisoned sword (Quintus Curtius IX. 8), the Harmatelia of Diodorus, described by him as the last town of the Br\u0101hmans on the river. For the Islamic traditions about Alexander, see Encyclo. Islam, ii. 533 (Iskandar).\nuse would punishment serve in a land where none is wicked and there is no thought of crime?\" The sagacious monarch was struck by this affecting address and leaving them their freedom, abandoned his project.\n\nThe following letter was addressed by Alexander to Didim, the head of the Br\u0101hmans; for he had often heard that they did not live as other men. The novelty excited his wonder and made his life seem insupportable to him:\n\n\"O Didim, after learning thy message, I desire again to be informed of thy precepts and doctrines. If what thou hast represented bears the light of truth and is the result of experience, answer speedily, so that, putting this system to the proof, I also for justice sake and in search of truth, may follow thy footsteps.\"\n\nDidim thus replied: \"What I have stated results from profound knowledge. You have not chosen to believe in its truth and you reject what you do not incline to. Many blameable actions were favourably represented by you in our interview. Now, therefore, with full knowledge believe my words. Hir\u0101bud, the Br\u0101hman, does not yield to the promptings of desire. Content with the measure of his needs, he opens not the door of greed.\"\n\n---\n\n14 This crabbed and obscurely-worded sentence is capable of a different, but in my opinion, not so satisfactory an interpretation. The name Didim in the text is not in Firdausi. It occurs in Plutarch (Alex. LXXXVI.) and in Arrian (Anab. VII. 2) as Dandamis; in Strabo (LXIV.) as Mandanis. The name is most probably Dandin, meaning an ascetic who always carries a rod in his hand after his initiation. Mandanis is evidently an error; there was a real Hindu scholar bearing the name Mandan Mishra who figures in the stories of Sankar\u0101ch\u0101rya's disputations, but that was in the 8th century after Christ. [J. Sarkar.]\n\n15 This probably refers to the embassy of Onesicritus to the Gymnosophists, who endeavoured to persuade some of them to return with him to Alexander's camp. Plutarch says that Calanus insolently told him to divest himself of his robe in order to hear his precepts in nakedness, symbolical doubtless of humility and ignorance. He was however induced by Taxila to visit Alexander who retained him in his suite with distinguished favour. His self-chosen death by burning at Pasargadce in Persia, when suffering from a fit of choleric, is told by Arrian [Bk. vii. ch. 3 and 18], Diodorus, and Plutarch.\nnot such as the four elements cannot easily supply. The earth gives us of its produce. In our meals intemperance has no place, for this reason we have no need of medicine or physician, and thus we enjoy perpetual well-being. We are not indebted to each other for assistance. We Br\u0101hmans have equality in all things; what room then is there for indigence? In a land where the seeds of arrogance and vain glory grow not, universal poverty is consummate fortune. We have no governor, for our actions are not subjects for penal inquiry. We disapprove of a variety of creeds for they are produced through exceeding unrighteousness and manifold iniquities. Our only religion is the worship of conscience. From what it restrains us we withhold our hearts. We do not submit to the tyranny of the pursuit of wealth for it fosters greed and brings disappointment in its train. We disdain idleness and hold it in reproach. We are not rendered averse from the delights of wedlock by incapacity, for all things are in our power as we can also forego them. From the sun we receive warmth, from the dews moisture. Our thirst is quenched from the stream and we have no couch but the earth. Desire does not rob us of sleep, nor leave us a prey to care. We lord it not over our equals through pride; we seek service from none save of our own bodies, for\u2014we consider the body subservient to the spirit. We bake not stone in the fire for the raising of palaces, for we dwell in the hollows of the earth according to the measure of our needs, nor do we go in fear of the violence of the wind nor of storms of dust, for there we are safer than in houses of reed. We wear no costly robes; we cover our nakedness with leaves, or to speak truly, with modesty; our women are at no pains for their adornment, for who can add beauty to the creations of God? and after they are arrayed [198] it profiteth them nothing. Our sexual commerce cometh not sinfully from carnal desire, but continuance of the race is kept in view. We are not prone to violence and we lay the\ndust of discord by the agency of right conduct, and though dependent on the guidance of destiny we do not resign ourselves to inactivity. Over our head we erect no edifices in the guise of temples of worship. Give your commands to those who have flung wide for themselves the door of avarice and make their treasure of the things of this world. The ravages of pestilence do not reach us for we defile not the skirts of heaven with evil deeds. We are prepared to meet the vicissitudes of the seasons, and thus summer's heat and winter's cold distress us not, and therefore we live careless of the exigencies of those times. We do not deaden our minds with games and shows of elephants and horses and with dancing, and when a desire for worldly pageants seizes us, the sight of the record of your actions withholds us therefrom, and recalling your deeds which indeed more deserve a smile, we are moved to many tears. Worldly splendours make us rejoice in another spectacle, for amidst the varied beauties of the universe, the heavens glowing with the radiance of their myriad stars, the sea, coloured by its skies, that clasps in a fond embrace its sister earth, the revel of its fish that leap in play from its foam-tossing waves, fill our eyes with delight. Wandering through the woods with the fragrance of flowers and by running springs in the shade of abundant trees gladdens us in a hundred ways, while the sweet songs of birds render us unenvious of all the festal banquets of the rich. Such is the theatre we possess, to share in the enjoyment of which is difficult, to erase it from our minds, a crime. We plough not the seas in barks and vessels. Our hearts are not aflame with passion for the beauty of others, and we affect not the language of flattery or eloquence. The redundance of professed eulogists obtains no credit in this land, for the practice of this base crew which gives to the creature the praise due to God and overlays the purity of faith with error, darkens celestial light with reprehensible\ndeeds. Of a truth you are the most unfortunate of mankind for your worship is sinful and your life is chastisement.\"\n\nThe monarch thus replied: \"If your language reflects the light of truth, I should infer that the Br\u0101hmans alone are robed in the true characteristics of humanity and that this sect are to be regarded as incorporeal spirits. To hold as altogether unlawful the acts of the natural man is either to be God or to be envious of the Supreme Being. In short these principles, in my opinion, proceed from madness not from the fulness of wisdom. O, Didim, I have not fixed my abode in this hired dwelling, nor made of a passing-resthouse a settled habitation, but prudently looking on myself as a sojourner, hasten, unencumbered with guilt, to my true country. This language is not the making of self a god, but like dark-minded bigots that are enemies to their own happiness, I do not affect to make the attributes of the Creator the instruments of my salvation. And whosoever under the guidance of a wakeful fortune, abandoning sinful actions, walks in the way of virtue is not a god, but by means of the grace of that Supreme Lord, rises above his fellow men.\" The writer [P. 199] continued: \"My royal master observes that you call yourselves fortunate in that you have chosen a retired spot of earth where the comings and goings of those without and the busy movement of the world are not heard, and that you consider this praiseworthy as proceeding from your attachment to your hearths and love of your native land. The lowness and poverty that you cannot avoid is not worthy of commendation: on the contrary, the Almighty has inflicted this as a punishment for your evil deeds. True merit consists in living abstemiously amid abundant fortune, for ignorance and want cannot exhibit the lustre of virtue. The first cannot see what to avoid, the second has not the means by which it may possess. I, who with all the resources of pleasure and enjoyment at my command,\nhave refrained from them altogether and have sternly chosen a life of toil, am more deserving of a glorious reward.\"\n\nSome say that after his victory over Porus, Alexander heard that at the extremity of India, reigned a king called Kayd,\\(^{16}\\) possessed of many virtues, and who for three hundred years had passed a blameless life. To him he despatched a letter that appealed to his hopes and fears. The king read the letter and thus replied: \"I have heard of the successes of your Majesty and would deem the honour of a personal visit the source of fortune, but stricken in years, strength fails me. If my excuse is accepted, I will send as an offering four matchless treasures which are the pride of my life; an accomplished and virtuous maiden of incomparable beauty; a sage unequalled in penetrating the secrets of the heart; a physician, in healing as the Messiah; a cup which though drunk from is inexhaustible. Alexander accepted the gifts and despatched Balin\u0101s with some experienced associates to bring them. The envoy returned to the court with these treasures of price together with forty elephants of which three were white, and numerous other presents. Alexander first essayed to test the Hindu sage. He sent him a bowl full of clarified butter. The sage thrust a few needles therein and sent it back. Alexander fused the needles and forming the metal into a ball returned it to him. The sage fashioning of this a mirror, again sent it back. Alexander placed it in a basin full of water and despatched it once more. The sage made of the mirror a drinking cup and set it upon the water of the basin. The monarch filled it with earth and returned it. At the sight of this, the sage fell into a profound melancholy and bitterly reproached himself and directed it to be carried back. Alexander was perplexed at this action.\n\n\\(^{16}\\) This story is told at considerable length by Masaudi in the 26th Chapter of the 'Meadows of Gold'. The king's name is there Kend. Firdausi's version is somewhat different, but the name is Kayd, as in the text.\nnext day he held an assembly of the learned to discuss these mysteries. The seer was introduced and honourably received. He was of prepossessing exterior, with a noble brow, tall and powerfully made. Alexander on seeing him, thus reflected: \"If to such a presence, he also unites a lofty wisdom, quickness of penetration and strength of will, he is unparalleled in his generation.\" The sage read his hidden thoughts and making a circuit of his face with his forefinger rested it on the point of his nose. When asked for an explanation, he replied: \"I understood your Majesty's reflections and by this gesture I meant to express that as the nose in the face is one, I also am unique in my time.\" He was then required to expound the enigmas of the preceding day. He answered: \"Your Majesty wished to signify the profundity of your wisdom, for as the bowl was full so the royal mind was filled with various knowledge and could contain no more. I, on the other hand, showed that as needles could find a place therein, so could other lore find room in your mind. By fashioning the ball your Majesty's intention was to discover that the clearness of your intellect was not like the bowl of butter in which other things could be contained, but resembled a ball of steel. The construction into a mirror signified that though steel be hard, it is capable of such polish as to reflect the face. By your sinking the mirror in water, I understood the shortness of life and the vast extent of knowledge. By fashioning it into a cup, I answered that what sank in water might with skill be made to float; thus also immense erudition may be acquired by severe application and the shortness of life be prolonged. The filling it with earth implied that the end of all things is death, and the return to earth. This was capable of no answer, and I was silent.\" Alexander praised his sagacity and penetration and said: \"The profit that I have reaped from India has been my meeting with thee.\" He took him into his companionship and intimacy and parted from him only when he left\nIndia. The other three treasures also were subjected to a similar ordeal and their worth approved.\n\nSome writers narrate the history of Porus after the particulars regarding Kayd, and state that he fled without fighting to distant parts and that his dominions were conferred upon another.\n\n**Mani the Painter.**\n\nHis presumption led him to claim the authority of a prophet and he composed a work which he pretended had come down from heaven affirming also that he was the Paraclete announced by the Messiah; S\u0101pur, the son of Ardshir B\u0101bag\u0101n favoured him. It was not long before his imposture was discovered and he was condemned to death, but he contrived to escape by flight. For a time he remained in Kashmir and from thence entered India where his doctrines received some acceptance. From thence he went to Turkistan and China and resided chiefly in the eastern parts till his wanderings brought him to a mountain where he discovered a cave which was untrodden by human foot, and to this he brought provisions sufficient for a year. One day, in the course of conversation, he said to his followers: \"I have been summoned to heaven where I shall remain for a twelve-\n\n---\n\n17 This account appears to be taken from Khondemir and agrees in the main with D'Herbelot's sketch from the same historian. Firdausi makes him a native of China and places his death in the reign of Shahpur by whom, he says, Mani was flayed alive and his skin stuffed with straw as a warning to his followers. The Manichean sect takes its rise from this impostor who, according to D'Herbelot, was a Christian priest in the province of Ahw\u0101z and had many controversies with the Jews and Magians and maintained the Indian doctrine of metempsychosis. He named twelve apostles to preach his doctrines in India and China, and gave them his book called the \"Anghelion\". \"Anghelion, c'est \u00e0 dire l'Evangile.\" One of his principles was abstinence from all flesh, and he forbade the taking of animal life. He admitted two principles of good and evil and the dual soul, one bad and created with the body by the evil principle, and the other the good created by the good principle. He denied free-will and the necessity of baptism. *Dubistan* (Shea and Troyer), i. 205, Hastings, *Encyclo.* viii. 396.\nmonth: be not troubled at my absence nor withdraw from the worship of God and the practice of virtue. At the end of the year, go, some of you, to a certain mountain and wait in expectation.\" Previous to his concealment he had learnt the art of painting in which he had attained incomparable skill. After he had ascended the mountain, he painted some wonderful figures which are celebrated by the name of Artang, or Arzhang,\\(^{18}\\) and at the time that he had said, he came forth with the book in his hand. Those who saw it were filled with amazement. He exclaimed: \"This is not the work of mortals that ye should wonder; I brought it from heaven and it is painted by the angels.\" This he brought forward as a witness of his prophetic mission and deceived the ignorant and credulous. He attempted to impose upon Bahr\u0101m Gor, the son of Hormuzd, the son of Ardeshir, but he failed in his purpose, and in this criminal venture staked and lost his life.\n\n[201] **BAHRAM GOR**\n\nWar the son of Yezdejird, the Wicked, of the Sassanian dynasty. Since the lust of the world fills the brain with extraordinary fancies in the first flush of his success he was seized with the frenzy of adventurous travel, and leaving one of the Magi of the line of Bahman, son of Isfandy\u0101r, as governor in his stead, he set out for India in a disguise which defied recognition. In those parts there was a raging elephant which put the whole country in terror. Although the bravest warriors had attempted to kill it, they lost but their own lives. Bahr\u0101m hearing of this event arrived at the place and by sheer strength of arm destroyed it. The prince\n\n\\(^{18}\\) Hammer Purgstal supposes that the *Artang* might have been an ensign upon which cabalistic fingers were represented, and which the Mongols and Buddhists used to call M\u0101ni. (Jahrb. der Lit. for April, May, June, 1840, p. 28 quoted by Troyer. *(Dabistan*, I. 205).\nof that region received him at his Court with much favour.\\textsuperscript{19} In his vicinity a powerful enemy had arrived to dispute his sovereignty, and he saw no resource but in the payment of tribute. Bahr\u0101m dissuaded him from this course, and opposed the invader in person and defeated him. The prince gave him his daughter in marriage, but when he discovered his illustrious descent, he became apprehensive and dismissed him loaded with presents back to his own country. It is said that Bahr\u0101m took with him 12,000 musicians; and many other wonderful adventures are related of him.\n\n\\textbf{BURZUYAH.}\n\nNushirw\u0101n spent his days in the assiduous pursuit of knowledge, solicitous to discover erudite minds and interesting literary works. He opportunely fell in with a learned Br\u0101hman with whom he frequently held familiar discussions. Enquiry was made regarding the truth of a universal report to the effect that in a certain mountainous part of India certain herbs grew which could restore the dead to life. The Br\u0101hman replied: \"The report has a semblance of fact, inasmuch as by the mountain is meant a wise man, by the herbs knowledge, and by the dead an ignorant person,\" and he proceeded to expound the various lore of the country and the advantages thereof. In this he included the story of Kalilah and Damnah, and briefly recounted its merits and said, \"the rulers of Hindustan keep this manual of statecraft studiously concealed and do not show it to every one.\" The desire to obtain this work rendered the monarch\n\n\\textsuperscript{19} See Vol. II, for the connection of Bahr\u0101m Gor with the royal house of M\u0101lwah. The adventures of this monarch were the subject of a poem by the Persian poet K\u0101tibi, and they are amply narrated in the Sh\u0101hn\u0101mah. Firdausi gives the name of the Indian prince as Shangal. Bahr\u0101m is represented as having fled from Kanauj with his wife after his marriage, being wearied of his splendid exile. The monarch pursues, but after an interview becomes reconciled to his departure.\nimpatient. He commanded his ministers saying: \"I need a judicious and discerning person who to a strong bodily constitution unites firmness of purpose and various learning, besides a knowledge of foreign tongues.\" Burzuyah was found to possess these important qualifications and successfully proved his capacity. A large sum of money was entrusted to him in order that he might set out in the guise of a merchant to that country, and through inquiries of experts attain the object of his mission, and return with it and other scientific treatises to the court. He came to India, and setting up as a trader passed himself off as an unlearned person desirous of acquiring knowledge. In this way he secured an intimacy with the ministers of the Indian princes, and through their instrumentality returned to the imperial court with that volume of wise lore, together with other valuable objects. The king received him with favour and fulfilled his desires.\n\nMuhammad Qasim\n\nWas cousin to the celebrated Hajjaj. He received his commission in the reign of the Caliph Abdu'l Malik, as has been already noticed. [P. 202]\n\n---\n\nThis story is somewhat differently told by Firdausi. Burzuyah, he narrates, was one of the distinguished circle of learned men at the court of Nushirwan, and one day presented himself before that monarch saying that he had lately read in a Sanskrit work of a mountain in India where grew a herb bright as a Greek sword-blade, which skilfully compounded and sprinkled over a corpse would restore it to life, and he asked permission to go in search of it. The king despatched him to India ostensibly as a merchant, with many presents, steeds, and a letter addressed to the king of Kanauj, and with merchandise laden on 300 camels. The Indian prince offered him every facility in his search for the wonderful herb, of which no trace could be found. He was directed at last to a hoary sage who informed him that the mountain was wisdom, the herb an eloquent monitor, and the corpse an ignorant man and that this herb was fitly represented by the work called Kalilah which was in the king's treasury. Returning elated to Kanauj, Burzuyah petitioned the Prince for the gift of the work.\nAMIR NASIRUDDIN SABUKTIGIN\n\nWas the father of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. After Bahr\u0101m Gor none of the (Persian) kings entered India. Sabuktigin invaded it at the head of an army in the year A.H. 367 (A.D. 977), and after several engagements returned to Ghaznin.\n\nAMIR SULTAN MAHMUD GHAZNAVI\n\nLed twelve descents on India. The first was in A.H. 390 (A.D. 1000), and the last in A.H. 418 (A.D. 1027). Fanatical bigots representing India as a country of unbelievers at war with Isl\u0101m incited his unsuspecting nature to the wreck of honour and the shedding of blood and the plunder of the virtuous.\n\nSULTAN MASAUD\n\nWas son of Mahmud: He crossed into India in A.H. 426 (A.D. 1034-35).\n\nSULTAN IBRAHIM, SON OF SULTAN MASAUD\n\nAlthough a considerable territory in Hindustan was in the possession of the descendants of Sultan Mahmud, none of the undermentioned princes entered India:\u2014Makhul-b-Sult\u0101n Mahmud; Maudud-b-Masaud; Masaud-b-Maudud; Sul\u0101n Ali-b-Masaud-b-Mahmud; Sult\u0101n Abdu\u2019r Rashid-b-Mahmud; Farrukhz\u0101d-b-Masaud; but when in course of time\n\nwhich in Arabic was called Kalilah.

This prince also visited India.\n\n**KHUSRAU SHAH-B-BAHRAM SHAH.**\n\nOn the death of his father, he succeeded to the throne. It was about this time that Al\u0101u'ddin Husayn Ghori, known as *Jah\u0101nsoz* or Burner of the World, sacked Ghaznin and entered India. Sult\u0101n Ghiy\u0101su'ddin S\u0101m and Sult\u0101n Shih\u0101bu'ddin, nephews of Al\u0101u'ddin Husayn, on whom the latter had bestowed Ghaznin and the adjacent provinces, contrived to secure the person of Khusr\u0101u Sh\u0101h from India and put him in prison where he ended his days, and thus the dynasty of the descendants of Mahm\u016bd passed away. Some authorities, however, assert that Khusr\u0101u Sh\u0101h held his court at the capital of Lahore, and that on his death, he was succeeded by his son [203] Khusr\u0101u Malik who was taken by the Ghoris and placed in confinement, in which he continued till he died.\n\n---\n\n22 This poet was a native of Ghazni. His *Hadiqah* is well known and is altogether of a religious character, a mystical treatise on the unity of God and other devotional subjects.\n\n23 This latter version is correct. Khusr\u0101u Sh\u0101h died in A.D. 1160, after a reign of seven years. Khusr\u0101u Malik, his son prolonged his feeble rule for 27 lunar years to A.D. 1186. He was taken prisoner by Shih\u0101bu'ddin through a stratagem, and sent with his family to Ghirjist\u0101n where, some years after, he was put to death.\nSULTAN MUIZZ\u2019UDDIN MUHAMMAD SAM.\n\nHe is also called Sult\u0101n Shih\u0101bu\u2019ddin. After the capture of Ghaznin Al\u0101u\u2019ddin Husayn Ghori imprisoned Ghiy\u0101su\u2019ddin and Shih\u0101bu\u2019ddin.\n\nOn his death, his son Sayfu\u2019ddin came to the throne and by releasing them attached them to his person.\n\nOn the death of Sayfu\u2019ddin in his campaign in I\u2019r\u0101q,24 he was succeeded by Ghiy\u0101su\u2019ddin. During his reign Shih\u0101bu\u2019ddin led several expeditions into India, and the (defeat and) death of Prithvi R\u0101j and the conquest of Hindustan occurring about this time, he left his slave Qutbu\u2019ddin (Eibak) at Delhi as his representative. On the death of Ghiy\u0101su\u2019ddin, the throne was occupied by Shih\u0101bu\u2019ddin who favoured the Turkish slaves. Among these was T\u0101ju\u2019ddin Yildiz, upon whom he bestowed the governments of Mekr\u0101n and Sur\u0101n which are dependencies of India.\n\nSULTAN QUTBU\u2019DDIN AIBAK\n\nWas one of the slaves of Sult\u0101n Mu\u2019izzu\u2019din, and rose to eminence through his own valour and resolution. The Sult\u0101n entrusted to him the viceroyalty of Delhi. He made many successful campaigns in India and performed many acts of personal prowess.\n\nMALIK NASIRU\u2019DDIN QABACHAH\n\nWas also a slave of Mu\u2019izzu\u2019din. On the death of his master he made himself master of Uchh, Mult\u0101n and the Sind country.\n\nSULTAN SHAMSU\u2019DDIN ILTUTMISH\n\nSome account him to have been a slave of Shah\u0101bu\u2019ddin and others of Qutbu\u2019ddin Aibak. After the death of the\n\n24 Against the Turkish tribe of the Euz or Ghuz long settled in Kipch\u0101k.\nlatter, his son Ar\u0101m Sh\u0101h being defeated, the sovereignty devolved upon Iltutmish.\n\n**SULTAN GH\u0130YASU'DD\u0130N BALBAN**\n\nWas one of the slaves of Shamsu'ddin and brought from Tur\u0101n to India. For a time he held the title of Ulugh Kh\u0101n and subsequently obtained the sovereign power.\n\n**SULTAN MUHAMMAD-B-SULTAN MALIK SHAH SALJUQI**\n\nAccording to some authorities, towards the close of his life having settled his differences with his brothers, he invaded India and put many to death. A stone idol weighing ten thousand maunds fell into his possession. The Hindus sent him a message offering to ransom it at its weight in pearls. This offer he refused.\n\n**SULTAN JALALU'DD\u0130N MANKBURNI**\n\n[204] When Sultan Muhammad Khw\u0101razm Sh\u0101h took refuge from the troops of the great Q\u0101\u0101n, Changiz Kh\u0101n, in the island of Abaskun, he was accompanied by his son Jal\u0101lu'ddin who, on his father's death, set out for Khur\u0101s\u0101n\n\n---\n\n25 He was the fifth prince of the elder branch of the Seljuks of Persia, omitting the ephemeral reign of Malik Sh\u0101h, son of Barkiarok. He succeeded to power in A.D. 1105 and died in A.H. 511 (A.D. 1118). The author of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Guzidah, Hamdu'llah-b-Abi Bakr Qazwini, mentions his invasion of India and the capture of the idol. His reason for rejecting the offer of the Hindus was that as Azar, the father of Abraham, was a maker of idols (but tar\u0101sh), it should never be said of him that he was the seller thereof (but farosh). See Ency. Isl. iii. 673. He fled says De Guignes, into Ghil\u0101n, passed Astar\u0101b\u0101d and took refuge in \"the island of Abaskun\", where he died miserably abandoned by every one. As Suyuti narrates that he fell ill of a pleurisy and died alone and abandoned, and his corpse was shrouded in his bedding, A.H. 617 (A.D. 1220), v. Hist. of the Caliphs. Jarrett, p. 495.

The great Q\u0101\u0101n himself marched in person to remedy the disaster. Jal\u0101lu\u2019ddin unable to cope with him retired towards Hindustan. The great conqueror pursued him to the banks of the Indus and both armies were again engaged. Yielding at last to superior force he mounted his horse and seizing his royal umbrella in his hand plunged into the stream and crossing its raging waters landed at a point opposite the enemy. He there took off his saddle and flung his clothes in the sun, and planting the umbrella in the ground sat down under its shade. The Q\u0101\u0101n beheld this feat with astonishment and was loud in his admiration. For a night and day he remained there, and was joined by fifty of his men, and cutting some clubs, they made a night attack on a party of Indians and carried off a considerable booty, and in a short time ten thousand horsemen were assembled under his command. Sult\u0101n Shamsu\u2019ddin Iltutmish, Emperor of Hindustan, was under the gravest apprehension, and could not venture to engage him. Jal\u0101l\u2019ddin continued for nearly two years in India carrying on a desultory warfare, and made himself master of several fertile districts, but subsequently returned by way of Kach and Mekr\u0101n to the conquest of l\u2019r\u0101q.\n\nSome authorities assert that when the number of his followers amounted to a thousand, he marched towards Delhi, and sent a messenger to Sult\u0101n Shamsu\u2019ddin Altmish desiring a post in his service. The latter prudently declined, and after the manner of astute intriguers he poisoned his messenger, and sending him a number of valuable presents sped him towards Ir\u0101n.\n\n---\n\n27 See this story in the Tarikh-i-Jah\u0101n Kush\u0101 of Juwaini.

Malik Qar\u0101qash at that time held the government of Lahore on behalf of the Sult\u0101n and from want of spirit and the disunion among his followers, he set out one night for Delhi, and the town was sacked.\n\n---\n\n29 This name appears in the T\u0101rikh-i-Jah\u0101n Kush\u0101 as Turta\u012b (Elliot, II. 391), who was despatched by Changiz Kh\u0101n in pursuit of Sult\u0101n Jal\u0101lu\u2019ddin. He captured Mult\u0101n and ravaged the surrounding country returning through Sind to Ghazni. The word Noviana, (or Novian in oriental historians), in the Mogul language signifies chief or general, corresponding to the Arab word Emir (De Guignes a. III. p. 69), and will be found as an adjunct to many names in the history of the Moguls (Vol. III. Book XV). Raverty spells Novian as Nu-in and Nu-yin, and explains it on p. 164. He gives this general\u2019s name as Turmati or Turti and describes the attack on Multan in 621 A.H. on pp. 534-540. [J.

He advanced as far as Uchh in the reign of Sultan Alauddin Masaud Shah (A.D. 1242-46), who marched to give him battle. On arriving at the banks of the Bi\u0101h, the invader retreated to Khurasan. A year previous to the invasion of Mankuyah, a part of the army of Changiz Khan entered Bengal and hostilities took place with Tughan Khan, who was at that time governor on the part of Alauddin Masaud Shah (reign 639-643 A.H.), but terms of peace were agreed upon. In the reign of Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah, the Mughal troops again invaded the Panjab and retired.\n\nSARI NOVIAN\n\nInvaded Sind with a large army.

Algu, a grandson of Changiz Khan, with many other chiefs entered the service of the Sultan, who gave him his daughter in marriage. In the beginning of the reign of Sultan Alau'ddin, some of the Turan troops crossed the Indus, and he despatched (Almas Beg) Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan with a large force to oppose them. The Mughals were defeated, some were taken prisoners, but the greater number were slain.\n\nSALDI\n\nWas of the Mughal race and about this time invaded Sind. The Sultan (Alau'ddin) appointed Zafar Khan (to oppose him), who in a short time obtained a victory and taking him prisoner, sent him to the royal court.\n\n35 Barani's T\u0101rikh Firoz Shahi gives Barr\u0101m; a river divided the two armies, but there is no mention of the province in which the engagement took place. Elliot, iii. 147-148.\n\nFor Algu Barani reads Ulghu. The T\u0101rikhi Firoz Shahi says that these Mughuls embraced Isl\u0101m and were allotted residences in Ghiy\u0101spur, Kilughari, Indrapat and Taluka, which were called Mughalpur after them.\n\n36 Mentioned in the T\u0101rikhi Firoz Shahi.

Sult\u0101n Al\u0101u\u2019ddin resolved to give him battle and (Zafar Kh\u0101n) defeated him, pursuing him for sixteen kos. The chiefs through jealousy did not join in the pursuit and the enemy returning surrounded him. Though (Zafar Kh\u0101n) was offered the strongest assurances of advancement, he refused their terms and died fighting to the last.\n\nTARGHI NOVIAN.\n\nAt the time when Sulta\u0101n Al\u0101u\u2019ddin was investing Chitor, thinking the opportunity favourable, invaded India with a large army. The Sult\u0101n after the capture of that fortress, A.H. 703 (A.D. 1303), hastened to oppose him and Targhi possessed himself of the fords of the river Jumna, within five kos of Delhi. The Sult\u0101n entrenched himself in the vicinity outside the city walls. After some hostilities Targhi returned unsuccessful to his own country.\n\nALI BEG AND TARTAK\n\nWere descendants of Changiz Kh\u0101n. At the head of thirty thousand horse, skirting the (Sew\u0101lik) mountains, he penetrated to Amroha, A.H. 704 (A.D. 1304). Sult\u0101n Al\u0101u\u2019ddin sent an army to oppose them.

Zafar Kh\u0101n\u2019s reputation for valour among the Mughals resembled that of C\u0153ur de Lion in Syria. If their horses shied they would ask if they had seen the ghost of Zafar Kh\u0101n.

The year after, thirty thousand Mughals made an incursion through the Sewaliks. The Sult\u0101n sent a large army which seized the fords and skilfully obstructed them. In the retreat many of the Mughals perished and some were taken prisoners.\n\nIQBALMAND\n\nIn the reign of Al\u0101u\u2019ddin invaded the country at the head of an army of Mughals, but was killed in action.

At this period the Sublime Standards approached as has already been briefly described.

He trusts that this course will be pleasing to many minds and a source to them of eternal bliss. For himself he will inhale fragrance from the garden of truth and receive the meed of his abundant toil.\n\nAwliya is the (Arabic) plural of wali which is interpreted as signifying 'nearness', by which is intended spiritual proximity. Some authorities ascribe to wilayat with a kasa of the wao, the meaning of diversity of appearance, and to walayat with a fatha, that of authority. Others assert that the idea of a lover attaches to the first, and the state of the beloved to the second. The possessor of the former quality is called wali, that of the latter, w\u0101li. Another opinion is that the word (walayat) with the fatha, betokens the proximity (to God) of the prophets, and with a kasa (wilayat), of the saints. In ancient works many significations have been given,\n\n1 Compare with this, Jami's introduction to his Nafahatu'l Uns min Hadharati'l Quds (Halitus familiaritatis e vis sanctitate eminentibus prodeuntes), p. 3, Lees' edit. where the derivation and meanings of wali are discussed and illustrated. \"Do you desire to be a Wali?\" said the celebrated devotee Ibrahim Adham, to a certain man, \"then seek not the things of this world or the next, but resign thyself wholly to God and turn to Him.\" That is, that the selfish desire for the delights of paradise is an obstruction to perfect communion with God in a similar sense with worldly pleasures though, of course, differing in degree. [Jarrett.]\n\nAccording to Jurjani, a wali is one who knows God; he is delivered from the yoke of the passions; he has influence with\nthe outcome of which is that it means one who has attained to the knowledge of the Supreme Being; a lofty soul will indeed love God alone. To me the wonder is, what connection can exist between a dust-mote of creation and the self-existing sun, and what bond lies between the finite and infinity? A *wali*, in my opinion, is one who acquires four great virtues and avoids eight reprehensible actions. He should always wage a victorious war by circumspect conduct against the myriad disorders of the spirit, and never for an instant relax his attention from its deceits. This lofty station is attainable by the grace of God and the guidance of fortune, and is sometimes to be reached through the spiritual powers of a mediator, and sometimes without it. The latter state they call *Uwaysi* with reference to the example of Uways Qarani;\u00b2 and some say\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe former, who possess the power of revealing things not manifest to the senses, are classed under twelve orders, of which two are regarded as unorthodox:\u2014\n\n[208] (1).

Hall\u0101ji.\n\nGod, he can bind and loosen, he also has the gift of miracles (*Kar\u0101mat*). Ency. Islam, iv. 1109 under *Wali*, where the correct etymology is discussed. [J. S.]\n\n\u00b2 This personage is referred to in the 37th Mak\u0101mah of al Hariri; \"and the crowd thronged round Abu Zayd praising him and kissing his hand and seeking a blessing by the touch of his tattered garment till I thought that he must be Uways al Qaran or Dubays al Asadi.\" He was the son of A\u0101mir and one of the T\u012bb\u016bn (or those next in time to the companions of Muhammad) celebrated among the devotees of Kufah and was killed fighting at the battle of Siffin under Ali, in A. H. 87. Har\u012br\u012b, p. 506, for the prophetic announcements of his birth and sanctity, the visit of Omar and Ali to him, and their discovery of the \"white wonder\" of his hand in the Mosaic sense.\nI. The source of grace to the FIRST-NAMED was Abu Abdu'llah Harith b-Asad Muh\u0101s\u012bb\u012b, a native of Basrah. He mastered all secular and speculative science and was thoroughly acquainted with the inequalities of the spiritual road. He was the teacher of his time [ust\u0101d-i-waqt] and the author of many works. He died at Baghdad in A.H. 243 (A.D. 857). As he ever judiciously wielded the moral controlling authority of his age, he received this name of Muh\u0101s\u012bb.\n\nThe SECOND follow Hamdun, the son of Ahmad-b-Amm\u0101r, Qass\u0101r or the Fuller, his patronymic being Abu S\u0101lih. He studied under Thauri and acquired many spiritual benefits from Salm-b-Husayn B\u0101rus\u012b, Abu Tur\u0101b Nakshab\u012b and Ali Nasr\u0101b\u0101d\u012b, and was a disciple of Abu Hafs. He attained a high degree of perfection though the world gave loose to the tongue of slander against him. He died at Nishapur in A.H. 271 (A.D. 884).\n\nThe THIRD revere Tayfur-b-I'sa Bist\u0101m\u012b whose patronymic is B\u0101yazid. One of his great ancestors was a Magian called Sharosh\u0101n. His earliest education was received from the elders of Bist\u0101m under whom he studied science and\n\n---\n\n3 He is said by J\u0101mi never to have used any support for his back, night or day, for 40 years, but always to have sat resting his knees on the ground declaring it to be the proper attitude for a servant in front of his Lord the King, meaning the Almighty.\n\n4 Sufy\u0101n Thauri is noticed in J\u0101mi, p. 716; and in the same volume will be found the names of all the saints and doctors mentioned in the following pages. Internal evidence conclusively proves that Abul Fazl utilized J\u0101mi's work in this compilation, one sentence being taken almost verbatim in the account of the fourteenth name in the second list, and as usual without acknowledgment. I do not think it necessary to disturb the dust of these uninviting biographies which are often as brief and colourless as those in the text, a bald record of names and dates with laudatory epithets of erudition or sanctity, and concluding occasionally with a few devotional maxims. Many of these are excellent precepts of conduct and are proofs of a true interior spirit of piety, but this is not the place to record them. For the rest, the English reader can be neither edified nor instructed by a hagiography of fossil names, most of them as profoundly forgotten as if they had never survived. The few that require any special mention shall receive it.\nreached the rank of a mujtahid.\\(^5\\) Next, having mastered the ordinary subjects of knowledge, he attained to the highest grade of intellectual distinction. He ranked equal to Ahmad Khazrawaih, Abu Hafs, and Yahya-b-Ma\u0101z, and was contemporary with Sh\u0101qiq of Balkh. He died in A.H. 261 (A.D. 874-75), or according to another account, A.H. 234 (A.D. 848).\n\nThe fourth are adherents of Junayd Baghd\u0101di whose patronymic is Abu'l Q\u0101sim and who is styled Qaw\u0101riri, the flask maker, and Zajj\u0101j, the glass manufacturer, and Khazz\u0101z, the raw-silk merchant. His father sold glass and he himself traded in silk. His ancestors were from Nah\u0101wand, but he was born and bred in Baghdad. He studied, for a time, under Sariy Sakatiy, H\u0101rith 'al Muh\u0101sibi and Muhammad Qass\u0101b, and his connection is authoritatively traced with Kharr\u0101z [the Cobbler], Ruyam, Nuri, Shibli and many others among the chosen servants of God. Shaykh Abu Jaafar-b-Hadd\u0101d says that if wisdom could be incarnate, it would assume the form of Junayd. He died in A.H. 297-98 or 99 (A.D. 909-10-11).\n\nThe fifth are called after Abishkhwur Nuri Ser\u0101bdil. His name was Ahmad-b-Muhammad or according to some, Muhammad-b-Muhammad. He was commonly known as Ibn-i-Baghawi. His father was from Khur\u0101s\u0101n, but his own birth and origin are of Baghdad, and he is among those distinguished for wisdom and virtue. He was in friendly intercourse with Sariy Sakatiy,\\(^6\\) Muhammad Qass\u0101b, and Ahmad Abu'l Haw\u0101ri, and contemporary with Zu'n Nun\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) This term denotes a doctor who exerts all his capacity for the purpose of forming a right opinion upon a legal question, and the title assumes that he was successful. (Full discussion in Ency. Islam, ii. 448 (under Idjihad.)\n\n\\(^6\\) I am not sure of the orthography. Sakatiy signifies a dealer in small wares, a pedlar.\n\n\\(^7\\) Abu'l Fayz Thub\u0101n-b-Ibr\u0101him. The reputation for sanctity and miracles of this mystic extends throughout the Moslem world and his name constantly occurs in its literature. He died in A. H.\nof Egypt. He is considered equal in authority with Junayd, but somewhat more impulsive. He died in A.H. 295 (A.D. 907-8) or 286 (A.D. 899).\n\n[209] The sixth originate from Sahl-b-Abdu\u2019llah Tustari, who was a disciple of Zu\u2019n Nun of Egypt, and one of the most eminent of those who attained to this sublime vocation. He was among the associates of Junayd and died in the month of Muharram, A.H. 283 (A.D. 896), at the age of eighty-six.\n\nThe seventh revert to Abu Abdu\u2019llah Muhammad-b-Ali Hakim-i-Tirmidi. He was in intercourse with Abu Tur\u0101b Nakshabi, Ahmad Khazrawaih and Ibn-i-Jal\u0101, and was pre-eminent in all secular and speculative knowledge. He is reported to have been a voluminous author and to have had the gift of miracles.\n\nThe eighth look to Abu Said Kharr\u0101z, or the Cobbler. His name was Ahmad-b-Isa and he was a native of Baghdad. Through his inclination towards the Sufis he went to Egypt and resided in devout attendance by the temple of Mecca. His profession was that of a shoemaker and he was the disciple of Muhammad-b-Mansur Tusi. He associated with Zu\u2019n Nun of Egypt, Sariy Sakatiy, Abu Ubayd Basri, and Bishr Al H\u0101j, and derived much spiritual instruction from them. He is the author of four hundred works. Those uninstructed in his doctrine believed him to be an infidel. He died in A.H. 286 (A.D. 899). Khw\u0101jah Abdu\u2019llah Ans\u0101ri says that he knew none of the great doctors more profoundly versed in the mysteries of the Divine Unity.\n\n245 (A.D. 860), and a flock of birds of a kind never before observed, fluttered over his bier when carried to the grave. On the day following his burial was found written on his tomb-stone in characters dissimilar to those used among men: \u201cZu\u2019n Nun, the friend of God, and slain by this love of God.\u201d As often as this was erased, it was found ever freshly engraved. Ency. Islam, i. 963, under Dhu\u2019l Nun.\nThe NINTH invoke Abu Abdu'llah Muhammad-b-Khafif. His father was from Shiraz and he himself was the disciple of Shaykh Abu Talib. He was master of secular and spiritual science and had seen Khazraj al Baghdadi and Ruyam, and was a contemporary of (Abu Bakr) Kattani, Yusuf-b-Husayn Razi, Abu Husayn Malik, Abu Husayn al Muzayyan, Abu Husayn Darraj and many others of note. He wrote many works and died in the year A.H. 331 (A.D. 942-43).\n\nThe TENTH trace back to Abu'l Abbas Sayyari. His name was Qasim and he was the son of the daughter of Ahmad-b-Sayyar. He was a native of Marv and the disciple of Abu Bakr Wasiti. He pursued the ordinary curriculum of worldly studies as well as speculative science, and attained to an eminence in the practice of the spiritual life. He died in the year A.H. 342 (A.D. 953).\n\nThe ELEVENTH. The founder of this order was Halm\u00e4n of Damascus.\n\nThe TWELFTH. This order had its origin in a Persian who was one of the disciples of Husayn-b-Mansur Hallaj of Baghdad, not the celebrated Husayn-b-Mansur (of Bayza).\n\nThese last two have been the subject of much reviling.\n\nIn Hindustan fourteen orders are recounted which are styled the fourteen families and of these twelve only are described, omitting mention of those of Tayfur and Junayd:\n\n(1). Habibi. (2). Tayfuri. (3). Karkhi. (4). Saqatiy. (5). Junaydi. [P. 210] (6). Kazruni. (7). Tusi. (8). Firdausi. (9). Suhrawardi. (10). Zaydi. (11). I'yazi. (12). Adhami. (13). Hubayri. (14). Chishti.\n\n*He was crucified alive for three days from early morning till midday by order of the Caliph Al Muqtadir in A.H. 309 (A.D. 922). He was accused of blasphemy for his words \"Ana'l Haqq,\" \"I am the Truth,\" by which he was supposed to claim divinity. The best accounts of Hallaj are in Ency. Islam (ii. 239) and Hastings Ency. vi. 480-482. [J. S.]\nThey assert that Ali, the Prince of the Faithful, had four vicegerents, viz., Hasan, Husayn, Kamil, and Hasan Basri. The source of these orders they believe to be Hasan Basri who had two representatives, Habib-i-Ajami, from whom the first nine obtain their spiritual fervour, and the other Abdu'l Wahid-b-Zayd, from whom the last five are filled with consolation. The mother of Hasan Basri was one of the slave girls of Ummu Salimah, and he received his name from Omar-b-Kattab. He early became an orphan. From the dawn of intelligence his mind was illumined and through this brilliant destiny he chose the path of solitude and emaciated himself by austerities while he became filled with the good things of the spirit. He preached a discourse every week and gathered an assembly around him. When Rabi'ah was not present, he would not proceed. The people said to him, \"Why dost thou desist because some old woman does not come.\" He answered, \"The food prepared for elephants is of no profit to ants.\"\n\nThe first order trace their connection with Habib-i-Ajami. He was a man of substance and hypocritical in his life. His eyes were opened somewhat by Suhrawardi and he was directed to the true faith by Hasan Basri. Many disciples were instructed by him in the way of salvation. Once when he was escaping from the pursuivants of Hajjaj, he arrived at the cell of Habib. The officers asked him where Hasan\n\n---\n\n9 Hind, the daughter of Abu Umayyah, and the latest survivor of the wives of Muhammad. She died in A. H. 59 (A. D. 678). An Nawawi in his Tahzibu'l Asma (correctio nominum) says, that the mother of Hasan of Basrah was the favourite slave or freed woman of Ummu-Salimah, and Hasan was born to her two years before the close of the Caliphate of Omar (A. H. 21). When the mother was occasionally obliged to leave her infant, Ummu Salimah would nurse it from her own bosom, and it was through the blessing of this privilege that he afterwards attained to his eminence of wisdom and sanctity. He died in A. H. 110 (A. D. 728).\n\n10 Suhrawardi (Umar) in Ency. Islam, iv. 506.\nwas. He replied within the cell. They searched, but could not find him and reprimanded Habib and said, \"Whatever Hajjaj may do to you, will be deserved.\" He answered, \"I have spoken only the truth. If you have not seen him what fault is it of mine?\" They again entered and made a strict search and returned in anger and departed reviling him; Hasan thereupon came forth and said, \"O Habib, thou hast, indeed, truly done thy duty by thy master.\" He answered, \"O master, thou hast been saved by the telling of the truth. Had I spoken falsely we should both have been killed.\" One night a needle fell from his hand in a dark room. A miraculous light shone. He covered his eyes with his hands and said, \"Nay, nay, I wish not to search for a needle save by the light of a lamp.\"\n\nThe third order derive from Maruf Karkhi. They say that his father was a Christian and changed his faith under Im\u0101m Riz\u0101 and was honoured with the office of his doorkeeper. He associated with D\u0101ud T\u0101i and practised mortification and through his rectitude of intention and perfected acts he rose to be a spiritual guide. Sariy Saqatiy and many others profited by his instruction. He died in A.H. 200 (A.D. 815). It was about this time that Magians, Christians, and Jews thronged to him and each wished to practise his own faith under his direction, but it could not be carried out. Nevertheless he held a place in the pleasant retreat of universal tolerance. [P. 211]\n\nThe fourth follow Sariy Saqatiy whose patronymic is Abu'l Hasan. He is one of the great masters of the practical religious life and was the director of Junayd and many other servants of God. He was one of the associates of H\u0101rith Muh\u0101sibi and Bishr al H\u0101fi, and was the disciple of Maruf Karkhi. Adequate praise of him is beyond the capacity of my ignorance. In the year A.H. 253 (A.D. 867), he gathered up his garment from this dust-heap of a world.\nThe sixth acknowledge Abu Ish\u0101q-b-Shahry\u0101r as their head. His father abandoned the doctrines of Zoroaster and embraced the creed of Islam. He was instructed by Shaykh Abu Ali Firoz\u0101b\u0101di and was the contemporary of many doctors of the faith, and had mastered all secular and speculative science. He was released from the turmoils of earth in A. H. 426 (A. D. 1034-35).\n\nThe seventh was founded by Al\u0101u\u2019ddin Tusi, who was united in the bonds of a spiritual paternity with Shaykh Najmu\u2019ddin Kubra.\n\nThe eighth invoke Shaykh Najmu\u2019ddin Kubra. His patronymic was Abu Jan\u0101b, his name Ahmad Khiwaki, and his title Kubra, or the Greater. He was spiritually directed by Shaykh Ism\u0101il Kasri, Amm\u0101r Y\u0101sir and Rozbih\u0101n, and he had great repute for his insight into matters of the exterior and inner life. Shaykh Majdu\u2019ddin Baghd\u0101di, Shaykh Saadu\u2019ddin Hammawiyah, Shaykh Raziu\u2019ddin Ali L\u0101l\u0101, B\u0101b\u0101 Kam\u0101l Jandi, Shaykh Sayfu\u2019ddin B\u0101kharzi and many other religious obtained their eternal salvation through his efficacious prayers. He died by the sword in A. H. 618 (A. D. 1221).\n\nThe ninth is favoured through Shaykh Zi\u0101u\u2019ddin Abu\u2019n Najib \u2019Abdu\u2019l Q\u0101hir Suhrawardi. He was versed in the knowledge of the world and the spirit, and traced his descent from Abu Bakr as Siddiq by twelve intermediary links. His doctrinal precepts he derived in direct transmission from Shaykh Ahmad Ghazz\u0101li; and he was the author of many works, among them the Ad\u0101bu\u2019l Muridin (Institutiones Discipulorum). He passed to his heavenly abode in A. H. 563 (A. D. 1167-68).\n\nThe tenth follow Shaykh Abdu\u2019l W\u0101hid-b-Zayd.\n\n---\n\n11 Because in all controversies, says J\u0101mi, in which he was engaged in his youth, he was ever triumphant, and so received the appellation. He was killed by the Tartars on their invasion of Khw\u0101rzam after the flight of Muhammad Khw\u0101rzam Shah.\nThe eleventh acknowledge Fuzayl-b-l'y\u0101z. His patronymic is Abu Ali and he was a native of Kufah, but according to others of Bokh\u0101r\u0101, and other places are also named. He passed his days as a wandering dervish between Marv and B\u0101ward (Abiward), and from his natural goodness of disposition, received interior illumination and his virtuous conduct assured his salvation. He passed from the world in A.H. 187 (A.D. 802-3).\n\nThe twelfth take Ibr\u0101him Adham of Balkh as their guide. His patronymic was Abu Ish\u0101q. His ancestors were of princely race and the star of his happy destiny shone forth from his early youth, for he withdrew himself altogether from the world. He associated with Abu Sufy\u0101n Thauri, Fuzayl-b-l'y\u0101z, Abu Yusuf Ghasuli and was in intimacy with Ali-b-Bakk\u0101r, Huzayfah Marashi and Silm-al-Khawwas. He died in Syria in the year A.H. 161 or 162 (A.D. 777-78-79).\n\nThe thirteenth trace back to Hubayrah of Basrah.\n\nThe fourteenth are connected with Abu Ish\u0101q Sh\u0101mi who was the disciple of Shaykh U'luw Dinawari. When the Shaykh arrived at [212] the village of Chisht, Khw\u0101jah Abu Ahmad Abd\u0101l, who was the foremost among the Shaykhs of Chisht received instruction from him, and after him his son Muhammad illumined the lamp of sanctity. Following him, his nephew Khw\u0101jah Sama\u0101ni carried on the doctrine, whose son Khw\u0101jah Maudud Chishti succeeded to the leadership. His son Khw\u0101jah Ahmad also reached the same eminence.\n\nThere is, however, no exclusive claim in regard to either of these two lists. Any chosen soul who, in the mortification of the deceitful spirit and in the worship of God, introduced some new motive of conduct, and whose spiritual sons in succession continued to keep alight the lamp of doctrine, was acknowledged as the founder of a new line, for besides these twelve and fourteen orders, many another catena of religious schools has a worldwide repute, such as the\nwhich follows Shaykh Muhyi\u2019ddin Abdu\u2019l Q\u0101dir Jili. He was a Sayyid descended from Husayn. Jil is the name of a village near Baghdad. Some authorities state that he was from Jil\u0101n. He was supreme in his time for his secular and spiritual knowledge. He received his dervish\u2019s habit from the hands of Abu Said al-Mub\u0101rak (b. Ali al-Makhzumi), and is thus spiritually connected with ash-Shibli through four intermediaries. His sanctity and extraordinary miracles are world-famed. He was born into the world in A.H. 471 (A.D. 1078), and bade farewell to it in A.H. 561 (A.D. 1165).\n\nYASAWI.\n\nThese are disciples of Khw\u0101jah Ahmad Yasawi. In his youth he was under the supervision of B\u0101b Arsl\u0101n, who was an eminent spiritual guide among the Turks. On his death he profited by the instruction of Khw\u0101jah Yusuf Hamad\u0101ni. The Turks call him At\u0101 Yasawi; At\u0101 in Turkish signifying a father, and their saints are thus designated. He returned to Turkist\u0101n at the command of the Khw\u0101jah and ended his days in the spiritual instruction of the people. Many miracles are reported of him. Four spiritual delegates are celebrated as religious guides: Mansur At\u0101, Sa\u012bd At\u0101, Sulaym\u0101n At\u0101, and Hakim At\u0101. Yasi is a town in Turkist\u0101n, the birthplace and town of this Shaykh.\n\n---\n\n12 The references to the saints that follow are given here in one place: Ency.

In his infancy he refused his mother\u2019s milk at the appearance of the new moon, on the fast of the Ramaz\u0101n: a cow that he was tending in his youth addressed him in Arabic and inspired him with his vocation: he fasted for 40 days. These are some of the miracles reported by Jami.\nNAQSHBANDI.\n\nThis school owe their eternal salvation to Khw\u0101jah Bah\u0101'u'dd\u012bn Naqshband. His name was Muhammad-b-Muhammad al-Bokh\u0101r\u012b. He was a disciple of Khw\u0101jah Muhammad B\u0101b\u0101 Samm\u0101si and received his religious instruction in regard to exterior conduct from (Sayyid) Amir Kul\u0101l, his delegate. Khw\u0101jah Samm\u0101si used often to say to Khw\u0101jah Ali R\u0101mit\u0101ni, [universally known as (Hazrat) Aziz\u0101n] as they passed in the vicinity of Qasr-i-Hindu\u0101n, \"From this soil there comes the fragrance of a man that will soon make the Qasr-i-Hindu\u0101n (Castle of Hindu\u0101n), be called the Qasr-i-A\u0101rif\u0101n (Castle of the Pious);\" till one day coming from the house of (Sayyid) Amir Kul\u0101l and passing the castle, he exclaimed, \"The fragrance has increased\u2014that man verily has been born.\" On inquiry it was found that three days had elapsed since the birth of the Khw\u0101jah. His father carried him to the B\u0101b\u0101, who said that he would adopt him as his spiritual son, and turning to his friends said: \"This is the one whose fragrance I smelt, and who will be the spiritual guide of the world.\" To Amir Kul\u0101l he said; \"Withhold no care or kindness in the bringing up [213] of our son Bah\u0101'u'dd\u012bn.\" His orders were carried out. After a time when his fame grew, B\u0101b\u0101 Samm\u0101si said to him: \"Your zeal has a loftier flight. You have my permission to go and beg of other souls.\" Thereupon he went to Qutham Shaykh and attended his instruction, and profited by the guidance of Khalil At\u0101 and realised his purpose through the spiritual aid of Khw\u0101jah Abd u'l Kh\u0101liq Ghujduw\u0101ni. The source of his interior illumination was (the prophet) Khizr; his faith and discipline were derived from Khw\u0101jah Yusuf Hamad\u0101ni. Khw\u0101jah Yusuf had four vicegerents, Khw\u0101jah Abdu'llah Barqi,\n\n---\n\n14 This account has been taken from J\u0101mi's notices of Khw\u0101jah Muhammad B\u0101b\u0101 Samm\u0101si and Bah\u0101'u'dd\u012bn Naqshbandi to which I refer the reader for those of the other doctors herein named.\nKhw\u0101jah Hasan Andaki, Khw\u0101jah Ahmad Yasawi, and Khw\u0101jah Abdu'l Kh\u0101liq Ghujduw\u0101ni. Khw\u0101jah Yusuf had received instructions from Shaykh Abu Ali F\u0101rmidi, and he from Shaykh Abu'l Q\u0101sim Gurg\u0101ni. The latter was the disciple of the following two personages, Junayd and Shaykh Abu'l Hasan Kharag\u0101ni, and these of B\u0101yazid Bist\u0101mi, and B\u0101yazid of the Im\u0101m Jaafar as-S\u0101diq. The Im\u0101m was himself nourished from two sources; on the one side from his father Muhammad B\u0101qir, and he, from his father Im\u0101m Zaynu'l A\u0101bidin, and he from his grand-parent the Im\u0101m Husayn, and on the other from his mother's father Q\u0101sim-b-Muhammad-b-Abu Bakr, and Q\u0101sim from Salm\u0101n al-F\u0101rsi (the companion) and Salm\u0101n' from Abu Bakr.\n\nIt is said that Khw\u0101jah Bah\u0101'u'ddin had neither a slave nor a handmaid, and when asked the reason of this, he replied that (\"the maintenance of) bondage was incompatible with the profession of a religious teacher.\" They inquired\n\n---\n\n15 Chujduw\u0101n is a small town in Bokh\u0101ra.

The same tomb contains the bodies of his father Muhd. al-B\u0101qir, his grand father Ali Zaynu'l A\u0101bidin, and his grand-father's uncle al-Hasan, son of Ali. \"How rich a tomb,\" says Ibn Khallik\u0101n, \"in generosity and nobility.\" See Ency.

His father was headman of the village and a Magian. The youth fled from his home and fell in with some monks, in whose company he remained till their death. The last of them directed him to go to Hij\u0101z and foretold the coming of a prophet. He travelled thither with some Arabs who sold him to a Jew of Quraydha at W\u0101di'l Qura, who took him to Medina. There he met Muhammad and recognized his prophetic mission, from his signet ring, and from an alms twice offered to him which were the three signs announced to him by the last of the monks. He is said to have been one of the most learned, pious and liberal of the companions.\nof him: \"To what stage does your spiritual ancestry go back?\" He replied, \"No one reaches any stage by virtue of a spiritual ancestry.\" On the night of Monday, 3rd Rabii' l, A.H. 791, (4th March, A.D. 1389) he disburdened himself of his elemental body.\n\nThe case of these orders is similar to that of the four schools of theology. Any one reaching the rank of Mujtahid may become a doctrinal authority, and there is no difficulty in the recognition of this as fourfold.\n\nBut it is better that I should desist from further details and seek the divine mercy by mentioning the Saints of God. In the following enumeration, under the title of \"Saints\", I have recorded the names of forty-eight only among thousands, and make this a means towards the attainment of eternal bliss.\n\n**SHAYKH BABA RATN**\n\nWas the son of Nasrat-Tabrindi; his patronymic was Abu'l Riz\u0101. In the time of ignorance he was born at Tabrindah and went to Hij\u0101z and saw the Prophet, and after many wanderings returned to India. Many accepted the accounts he related, while others rejected them as the garrulity of senile age. He died at Tabarindah, in A.H. 700 (A.D. 1300-1), and was there buried.

Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Qahandazi, a man absorbed in divine things, regarded him with an eye of favour and set aflame the gathered harvest of wordliness with the fire of divine ardour, and guided him in his quest. In Harun, a village of Nish\u0101pur, he attended Khw\u0101jah Othm\u0101n Chishti, and practised a mortified life and received the habit of Khalifah or vicegerent. Subsequently he reached a higher degree of perfection and was spiritually benefited by Shaykh Abdu'l Q\u0101dir Jili and other holy men. In the year that Mu'izzu'ddin S\u0101m took Delhi (A.H. 589, A.D. 1193), he arrived at that city, and with a view to a life of seclusion withdrew to Ajmer and there inspired the same zeal among numerous disciples by his own efficacious will. He shared the reward of a heavenly kingdom on Saturday, the 6th of Rajab, A.H. 633 (18th March 1236). His resting place is at the foot of the hilly range of that district and is visited to this day by high and low.\n\nSHAYKH ALI GHAZNAVI HAJUBARI.\n\nHis patronymic was Abu'l Hasan. His father was Othm\u0101n-b-Abi Ali Jull\u0101bi. He lived secluded from ordinary worldly concerns and obtained a high degree of knowledge. An account of him is given in the Kashfu'l Mahjub li Arb\u0101bi'l Qulub (delectio eorum qui relata sunt in favorem cordatorum).

His father died when he was a child; he grew in wisdom and studied in Turan and Iran. He received his doctrine from Shaykh Shihabuddin Suhrawardi at Baghdad and reached the degree of vicegerent. He was on terms of great friendship with Shaykh Farid (u'ddin) Shakkarganj, and lived with him for a considerable time. Shaykh (Fakhruddin) l'raqi and Mir Husayni were his disciples. On the 7th of Safar, A.H. 665 (7th November 1266), an aged person of serene aspect sent in to him a sealed letter by the hand of his son Sadru'ddin. He read it and gave up the ghost, and a loud voice was heard from the four corners of the town: \"Friend is united to Friend.\" His resting place is in Multan.\n\nQUTBUDDIN BAKHTYAR KAKI\n\nWas the son of Kamalu'ddin Musa and came from Ush of Farghanah. He lost his father when very young and privileged by the vision of (the Prophet) Khizr was keenly desirous of meeting with a spiritual guide till the arrival in Ush of Khwajah Mu'inuddin. At the age of eighteen he received his doctrine and became a vicegerent. He profited by the instruction of many saints at Baghdad and other places. In the desire of [P. 215] meeting with a holy director he came to India and for a time attended Shaykh Bahauddin Zakariya. He arrived in Delhi in the reign of Shamsuddin Iltutmish.

He was of great service to the people in general. He died on the 14th of Rabii\u2019 I, A.H. 633 (Saturday, 27th November, A.D. 1235). His tomb is in Delhi where it is visited by all classes.\n\nSHAYKH FARIDU\u2019DDIN GANJ I SHAKKAR\n\nWas the son of Jam\u0101lu\u2019ddin Sulaym\u0101n, a descendant of Farrukh Sh\u0101h K\u0101buli. His birthplace was the village of Khotwal, near Mult\u0101n. In his early youth he followed the common course of studies. At Mult\u0101n he met Khw\u0101jah Qutbu\u2019ddin, went with him to Delhi and was instructed in his doctrine. Some authorities state that he did not accompany him to Delhi, but took his leave on the way and hastened to Qandah\u0101r and Sist\u0101n, where he set himself to the garnering of knowledge. He then came to Delhi and put himself under disciplinary rule. He had many warrings with the spirit in which he eventually triumphed. When Khw\u0101jah Qutbu\u2019ddin was on the point of death, there were present Q\u0101zi Hamidu\u2019ddin N\u0101gori, Shaykh Badru\u2019ddin Ghaznavi and many other holy men. They agreed that the habit and other personal belongings of the dying man should be committed to Shaykh Faridu\u2019ddin. The Shaykh who was then at the town of Jh\u0101nsi, on hearing this, went to Delhi, and taking possession of the trust, returned. He was the source of blessings to many people. He bade farewell to this fleeting world on the 5th of Muharram, A.H. 668 (Monday, 5th September, 1269), at (P\u0101k) Pattan in the Panj\u0101b, which at that time was called Ajodhan.20\n\n---\n\n20 Ferishta gives various accounts of the derivation of his epithet Ganj i Shakkar, (the treasure-house of sweets). Once on going to see his spiritual director, being weak from fasting, his foot slipped and he fell in the mud, it being the rainy season. Some of the mud entered his mouth and was changed into sugar. His director, on his arrival, had preter-natural intuition of the event, and told him that the Almighty had, probably, designed him to be a store-house of sweet things and would preserve him in this condition. On his return home, he found that this epithet had spread\nSHAYKH SADRUDDIN AARIF\n\nWas the son of Shaykh Bahauddin. During his father's life-time he reached the highest degree of sanctity.

He died in Multan, where he is buried, in A.H. 709 (A.D. 1309).\n\nNIZAMUDDIN AULIYA.\n\nHis name was Muhammad and he was the son of Ahmad Danyal who came from Ghaznin to Badon in A.H. 632 (A.D. 1234-35), where Nizamu'ddin was born. For a time he went through the ordinary course of studies and received the epithet of Nizam al-Bahhath, or the Controversialist, and Mahfil Shikan, the Assembly-router. At the age of twenty he went to Ajodhan and became the disciple of Fariduddin Ganj i Shakkar and obtained the key of the treasury of inward illumination. He was then sent to Delhi to instruct the people, and many under his direction attained to the heights of sanctity, such as Shaykh Nasiruddin Muhammad Chiragh i Dilhi, Mir Khusrau, Shaykh Alau'l Haqq, Shaykh Akhi Siraj, in Bengal, Shaykh Wajihu'ddin Yusuf in Chanderi, Shaykh Yakub and Shaykh Kamal in Malwah, Maulana Ghiyas in Dhara, Maulana Mughis in Ujjain, Shaykh Husain in Gujarat, Shaykh Burhanuddin Gharib, [216] Shaykh Muntakhab, Khwajah Hasan, in the Dekhan. He died in the forenoon of Wednesday, the 18th Rabii II, A.H. 725 (3rd April 1325). His tomb is in Delhi.\n\namong the people who designated him by it. Another account is that meeting with some banjaras who were taking salt to Delhi, they asked him to bless their bales that they might sell with profit. He did so, and on their arrival the sacks were discovered to be full of sugar.\n\n\"In Ghiyaspur,\" says Ferishta, \"which is one of the quarters of new Delhi.\" He relates that Ghiyasuddin Tughlak Shah who then reigned at Delhi, though outwardly treating Nizamu'ddin with consideration, was in reality displeased with him. When about to return from his expedition to Bengal he sent a message to the Shaykh directing him not to await his arrival at Delhi, and that henceforth he was no longer to remain in Ghiyaspur. The Shaykh\nSHAYKH RUKNU\u2019DDIN\n\nWas the son of Sadru\u2019ddin A\u0101rif and the successor of his eminent grandfather [Bah\u0101-ud-din Zakariya]. At the time when Sult\u0101n Qutbu\u2019ddin (Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h Khilji, A.H. 717 (A.D. 1317), regarded Shaykh Niz\u0101mu\u2019ddin with disfavour, he summoned Shaykh Ruknu\u2019ddin from Mult\u0101n in the hope of disturbing his influence. On his arrival near Delhi he met Shaykh Niz\u0101mu\u2019ddin. Qutbu\u2019ddin on receiving the Shaykh (Ruknu\u2019ddin) asked him \u201cWho among the people of the city was the foremost in going out to meet him?\u201d He replied: \u201cThe most eminent person of his age.\u201d By this happy answer he removed the king\u2019s displeasure. His resting place is Mult\u0101n.\n\nSHAYKH JALALU\u2019DDIN TABRIZI\n\nWas the disciple of Said Tabrizi. After some wanderings, he fell in with Shaykh Shih\u0101bu\u2019ddin Suhrawardi and by his zealous service attained the office of vicegerent. He was on terms of intimacy with Khw\u0101jah Qutbu\u2019ddin and Shaykh Bah\u0101u\u2019ddin Zakariy\u0101. Shaykh Najmu\u2019ddin Sughra, who was Shaykh u\u2019ll Isl\u0101m at Delhi, bore enmity against him and maliciously incited a disreputable woman to accuse the Shaykh of incontinence. Through the miraculous powers of Shaykh Bah\u0101u\u2019ddin Zakariy\u0101, the falsehood of the charge was established. He then went to Bengal. His tomb is in the port of Dev Mahal.\n\nSHAYKH SUFI BADHNI.\n\nHis birthplace was Oudh. He lived a life of extraordinary abstraction, heedless of all save the worship of God.\n\nreplied, hanuz Dilhi dur ast: Delhi is still far off.

The proverb Dilhi dur ast owes its origin to this event.\nIt is said that Khw\u0101jah Qutubu\u2019ddin and he, with a number of others, were taken prisoners by the Mughals. Hunger and thirst drove the captives to the greatest straits. It was then that the Khw\u0101jah, by supernatural power, drew forth from his wallet warm cakes (k\u0101k), with which he supplied each one of the party, while the Sufi gave them all to drink from his broken water-vessel (badhn\u0101). From this circumstance the Khw\u0101jah was called K\u0101ki, and the other Badhni.\n\nKHWAJAH KARAK.\n\nOne of the greatest of the ascetics. He lived apart from worldly intercourse and passed his days in ruined places. Khw\u0101jah Qutbu\u2019ddin Ushi sent him the habit of a recluse, which he took and threw into the fire. The bearer reviled him to the Khw\u0101jah who replied, \u201cGo and demand it back, so that thou mayest know what has in reality happened.\u201d When he made his request, Khw\u0101jah Karak said, \u201cGo, and take out a cloak from the fireplace, but only your own.\u201d When he went to look, he found that habit among many others, and repented of his conduct. His tomb is at Karrah, M\u0101nikpur.

Abandoning the world he journeyed to Baghdad and became the disciple of Shaykh Shih\u0101bu'ddin Suhrawardi. There he entered into intimate friendship with Khw\u0101jah Qutbu'ddin and after travelling to Hij\u0101z came to Delhi.

In his old age when he was unable to move, the sound of a hymn would excite him to ecstasy and he would dance like a youth. When asked how it was that the Shaykh could dance notwithstanding his decrepitude, he replied: \u201cWhere is the Shaykh?

At Ajodhan, in intercourse with Ganj i Shakkar, his doubts were removed, and becoming his disciple he set himself to mortify his senses. The Shaykh conferred on him the distinction of being both his vicegerent and his son-in-law.

Unexpectedly I received a call from God, and throwing all my learned books into the Jumna, I set out on travel. In Roumelia I fell in with Shamsu\u2019ddin Tabrizi and Maul\u0101n\u0101 Jal\u0101lu\u2019ddin Rumi who presented me with a robe and turban and with many books, which in their presence I threw into the river.

The Shaykh meanwhile had died, but others affirm that he saw him and by his direction went to Najibu\u2019ddin Firdausi, and after discipleship became his vicegerent. Shaykh Sham-su\u2019ddin Muzaffar of Balkh and Shaykh Jal\u0101lu\u2019ddin Awadhi, called also Jam\u0101l Qit\u0101l, received the vicegerency from him.

His profession was to deliver discourses and pronounce judical decisions, but renouncing this office he became the disciple of Shaykh Farid Ganj i Shakkar and reached a high degree of virtue. To whomsoever the Shaykh Farid gave a certificate of vicegerency, he would send him to Jam\u0101lu\u2019ddin on whose approval the certificate took effect. If he did not approve the Shaykyh would say that what Jam\u0101l tore up Farid could not repair. He was buried in H\u0101nsi.\n\n---\n\nAccording to Beale he is the founder of the Malang and Jal\u0101liya Fakirs, and his memoirs, called the Kit\u0101b-i-Kutbi, have been written by one of his disciples.\nSHAH MADAR.\n\nHis title was Badii'u'ddin.

Strange tales are told of him. The Mad\u0101ri order take their origin from him. His resting-place is in Makanpur.\n\nOn the anniversary of his decease every year, crowds of people from distant parts flock thither, carrying banners of all colours, and recite his praises.

Others again derive his genealogy thus,\u2014that he was the son of Phineas, the son of Eleazar (I'iz\u0101r), the son of Aaron the brother of Moses. There is also a disagreement regarding his prophetical office. The Qutbs, Abd\u0101ls, and Khizr, stand to him in the light of disciples and revere him. He is tall of stature, with a large head; is reserved in speech and absorbed in thought. He has a solemn and awe-inspiring exterior, and the mysteries of all things are revealed to him. It is said that he was raised up for the defence of the faith of Moses\n\n\\textsuperscript{28} J\u0101mi, a great authority on points of mysticism, says that the saints are providentially raised to prove the truth of the prophetic mission, and are the sources of grace to the faithful and an assurance of victory to them over the infidels. They are 4,000 in number; do not recognise each other, nor know their own dignity and are hidden both from themselves and mankind. Three hundred among these have the office of binding and loosing, and are called Akhy\u0101r (the Good). Forty others are called Abd\u0101l (Just). Seven others are termed Abr\u0101r (Pious). Three others are Nuqaba (Leaders) and one is termed Qutb (Pillar), or Ghaus (Defender).\n\n\\textsuperscript{29} He received this epithet says Tabari because he traversed the world from end to end, the word Qarn signifying a horn, a term applied also to the extremities of the universe. It is given to him in the Qur\u0101n (Sur. xviii. vv. 82, 84, 92).\nand was sent as an inspired guide to the people of Baalbak; when he found that his admonitions were of no avail, he asked for his deliverence from the Almighty, and his prayer was heard. One day he went up into a hill with Eliseus, the son of Akhtub, and a fiery chariot with its equipage and harness appeared, and leaving Eliseus as his successor he mounted the chariot and vanished from sight. [P. 225]\n\nExtraordinary accounts are told of these two personages Khizr and Elias. The first mentioned roams chiefly over dry land and brings those who have strayed into the right path; the latter keeps by the coasts. Some reverse these conditions. Each has ten holy persons as their assistants, and both are said to have lived for many years and associate together. Some of the learned, however, do not believe in their existence. Elias is prayed to for the prevention of calamities, and Khizr for their remission after they have befallen.\n\nPRAISE BE TO GOD\n\nThat a general review of the state of Hindustan has been now presented and the modes of thought and the customs of its people explicitly recorded. As time pressed and my mind was ill at ease, I did not formulate the proofs of their doctrine nor compare them with the systems of Greece and Persia. Neither did I set down the various conflicting opinions among the Hindus, nor express the thoughts that occurred\n\n---\n\n30 \"And when he was there and sat under a juniper tree he requested for his soul that he might die and said, 'It is enough for me, Lord, take away my soul: for I am no better than my fathers.'\n\nIII. Kings xix. 4.\n\nThus spoke Eliseus as he fled from Jezabel to Bersabee of Juda. Abul Fazl confounds Samaria with Heliopolis, and, perhaps, from the similarity of names, places the slaughter of the false prophets of Baal at Mount Carmel in Baalbak. Mount Carmel is still remembered as the Jabal M\u00e4r Ely\u0101s. Eliseus was the son of Saphat of Abelmeula. Tabari gives Elias the genealogy assigned by Abu'l Fazl and calls Eliseus the son of Akhtub. See Tabari, Zotenberg, p. 419, 10.\nthereon to this bewildered member of the synod of creation. Were my spirit not too much oppressed by the gloomy toil of these pages and the deciphering of the characters of manuscripts, and did fortune favour and continue its aid, I would first arrange these systems of philosophy in due order and weigh them with those of the Grecian and Persian Schools, contributing somewhat of my own impartial conclusions in measured approval or disapproval, as my fastidious judgment dictated:\n\n[A. F. disappointed by the talk of his 5 Muslim and 9 Hindu philosopher companions.]\n\nBefore I had left my obscure home and had approached the gracious threshold of majesty which is the abode where truth meets with recognition, and had mixed with the learned of all creeds, it had been my constant wish that the Bountiful Giver of all desires would vouchsafe to me the companionship of five intelligent and well-disposed persons, namely, a scholar of literary attainments; a profound philosopher; a mystic of holy life; an accomplished rhetorician; and a thinker of speculative and lofty spirit. It was herein my desire that each of these through his own perspicacity and just views of the divine Government, should not regard the truth as captive to his own discoveries, but ever suspicious of his own liability to error, advance in his inquiries with a bold step so that in the common pursuit of truth, the opinions of each might be lucidly set forth. The prescriptive duties of investigation might, in such circumstances, be exercised, and convincing argument distinguished from specious fallacy and proof from all beside it, in the hope that from the heart-lacerating thorn-brakes of discord there might be a happy transition into the garden of unity. When from seclusion I became engaged in public affairs, the five wishes of my aspiring mind grew to fourteen, and nine Hindus increased the contemplated list. I found the majority of them, however, of a retrograde tendency, spinning like a silk-worm,\na tissue round themselves, immeshed in their own conclusions,\nand conceding attainment of the truth to no other, while\nfoxlike, artfully insinuating their own views. In dejection of\nspirit [P. 226] as one crazy, I nigh came unto losing the\ncontrol of my reason and breaking the warp and woof of life.\nOn a sudden the star of my fortune blazed in the ascendant\nand the Imperial grace interposed in my favour, and thus\nrescued in some measure from vain imaginings, I found peace\nin the pleasant pastures of universal toleration (sulh-i-kul).\n\nI trust that by the happy destiny of this God-fearing\nmonarch this union will be realised, and my long-cherished\ndesires bloom with the radiance of fulfilment.\n\nO Lord! Unto my soul its sight restore,\nAnd let my feet Thy stair of Truth explore.\nThe treasures of Thy clemency set free\nAnd bid my spirit find its goal in Thee.\nGrant through life's busy ways still at my side,\nThy grace may aid me and Thy mercy guide.\nBOOK THE FIFTH.\n\nCOMPRISING THE HAPPY SAYINGS OF HIS MAJESTY,\n\nAND THE CONCLUSION,\n\nWith a brief notice of the Author.\n\nAs I have now succinctly described the Sacred Institutes, in acknowledgment of my own obligations and as a gift of price to the rest of mankind, it appears fitting that I should record somewhat of the sayings of His Imperial Majesty in relation both to secular and spiritual concerns, in order that his words and actions may become known to far and near.\n\nThe following are among his utterances:\n\nThere exists a bond between the Creator and the creature which is not expressible in language.\n\nEach thing has a quality inseparable from it and the heart is influenced by some irresistible attachment to the power of which it submits and builds thereon the foundation of its sorrows and joys. Whosoever by his brilliant destiny withdraws his affections from all worldly concerns, attains to the Divine love which is above all others.\n\nThe existence of creatures depends on no other bond than this. Whoever is gifted with this wisdom shall reach a high perfection.\n\nWhosoever habituates himself to preserve this sacred relation, will be withheld from it by no other occupation.\n\nHindu women fetch water from their rivers, tanks or wells, and many of them bear several pitchers one above the other upon their heads and converse and chat freely with their companions, walking the while over any inequalities of ground. If the heart in like manner preserves the balance\nof its pitchers, no harm will befall them. Why should men be inferior to these in their relations with the Almighty.\n\nWhen this interior affection both in its immaterial and material aspects is thus strengthened, who can sever the attachment of the rational soul to the Supreme Being?\n\nFrom the practice of real asceticism the transition is easy to unlawful mendicancy. Since a thing is best comprehended by contrast with its opposite, the latter also thus comes to be pleasurably regarded.\n\nThe intellect will not with the full assent of reason, confessedly oppose the divine law, but some do not believe in the divine books, nor credit that the Supreme essence that is tongueless will express itself in human speech, while others again differ in their interpretation of them.\n\nThe divine grace is shed upon all alike, but some from unpreparedness in due season and others from incapacity are unable to profit thereby; the handiwork of the potter evidences this truth.\n\nThe object of outward worship which they affect to call a new divine institute, is for the awakening of slumberers, otherwise the praise of God comes from the heart not the body.\n\nThe first degree of dutiful obedience is not to scowl with knitted brows when trials befall, but regarding them as the bitter remedies of a physician, to accept them with a cheerful countenance.\n\nThat which is without form cannot be seen whether in sleeping or waking, but it is apprehensible by force of imagination. To behold God in vision is, in fact, to be understood in this sense.\n\nMost worshippers of God are intent on the advancement of their own desires not on His worship.\n\nAs the dark hair turns to grey, the hope arises that this hue which is never far distant, may be kept burnished by the\nwondrous workings of destiny, in order that the rust of the heart may be cleansed with it and its vision illumined.\n\nSome there are who maintain that men walk in opposition to the will of God, and that their salvation depends on their renunciation of this evil habit; but he who is spiritually illumined knows that none can effectually oppose His commands, and physicians from this reflection provide a remedy for those that are sick.\n\nEach person according to his condition gives the Supreme Being a name, but in reality to name the Unknowable is vain.\n\nThe object of an appellative is the removal of ambiguity, but this is not predicable of the All Holy Essence.\n\nThere is no need to discuss the point that a vacuum in nature is impossible. God is omnipresent.\n\nAll that men account good and bad and virtue and vice, arises from the wondrous phases of God's grace: the discordant effects result from human action.\n\nTo impute the existence of evil to Satan is to make him a co-partner of the Almighty. If he is the robber, who is responsible for his being one?\n\nThe legend of Satan is an old-world notion. Who has the power to oppose the will of God?\n\nA peasant was seized with a desire to seek the Lord. His spiritual guide learning his love for his cow, placed him in a confined space and directed him to exercise himself in meditation on that object. After a time he called him forth to test him. As the man had been absorbed in that contemplation, he persuaded himself that he had horns, and replied that his horns prevented his exit. His director seeing his single-mindedness, by degrees weaned him from his error.\n\nThe superiority of man rests on the jewel of reason. It is meet that he should labour in its burnishing, and turn not from its instruction.\n\nA man is the disciple of his own reason. If it has naturally a good lustre, it becomes itself his director, and if\nit gains it under the direction of a higher mind, it is still a guide.\n\nCommending obedience to the dictates of reason and reproving a slavish following of others need the aid of no arguments. If imitation were commendable, the prophets would have followed their predecessors.\n\nMany whose minds are diseased persuade themselves into an affectation of health, but the spiritual physician recognises the impress on their brows.\n\nAs the body becomes sickly from indisposition, so the mind has its disorder; knowledge decays until a remedy is applied.\n\nFor a disordered mind there is no healing like the society of the virtuous.\n\nTo read the characters of men is a thing of great difficulty and is not in the power of every one.\n\nThe soul notwithstanding its superiority, takes the tone of the natural disposition by association with it and the brilliancy of its lustre thus becomes dimmed with dirt.\n\nThrough dullness of insight the concerns of the soul which are the source of happiness are neglected, while the pampering of the body which enfeebles the spirit, is eagerly practised.\n\nMen through attachments to their associates acquire their disposition, and much of good and of evil thus results to them.\n\nWhen his understanding is still undeveloped, man is in constant change of mood; at one time taking joy in festivities, at another sitting disconsolate in the house of mourning. When his vision is raised to higher things, sorrow and joy withdraw.\n\nMany in the conceit of their imagination and entangled in the thornbrake of a blind assent to tradition, believe themselves to be followers of reason, whereas if it be carefully regarded they are not in its vicinity.\n\nMany simpletons, worshippers of imitative custom, mis-\ntake the traditions of the ancients for the dictates of reason, and garner for themselves eternal perdition.\n\nActs and words are variously the effects of good sense, or of desire or of passion, but through the withdrawal of impartial judgment the facts are noisily misrepresented.\n\nWhen rising from sleep which is a semblance of death, one should be earnest in giving thanks for a renewed life by seemly thoughts and virtuous actions.\n\nConscience requires that rectitude and probity which is commendable in the sight of all men, should be associated with appropriate action.\n\nOne should first labour for one's own edification and then turn to the acquisition of knowledge in the hope of lighting the lamp of wisdom and extinguishing the risings of dissension.\n\nAlas! that in the first flush of youth our inestimable lives are unworthily spent. Let us hope that in future they may virtuously terminate.\n\nThe vulgar believe in miracles, but the wise man accepts nothing without adequate proof.\n\nAlthough temporal and spiritual prosperity are based on the due worship of God, the welfare of children first lies in obedience to their fathers...\n\nAlas! that the Emperor Hum\u0101yun died so early and that I had no opportunity of showing him faithful service!\n\nThe sorrows of men arise from their seeking their fortune before its destined time, or above what is decreed for them.\n\n(To his son.) My good counsel is your brother. Hold it in honour.\n\n(P. 231.) Hakim Mirz\u0101\u00b9 is a memorial of the Emperor Hum\u0101yun. Though he has acted ungratefully, I can be no\n\n\u00b9 Akbar's brother, king of K\u0101bul. He rebelled against Akbar, invaded India and besieged Lahor in the 11th year of Akbar's reign. See Akbarnamah, Eng. tr., vol. ii. 407-412, vol. iii. 532-543.\nother than forbearing. Some bold spirits asked permission to lie in ambush and put an end to that rebel. I could not consent, thinking it remote from what was befitting in his regard. Thus both that distinguished memorial of majesty escaped from harm, and my devoted friends were shielded from peril.\n\nThe concerns of men are personal to themselves but through the predominance of greed and passion they intrude upon (those of) others.\n\nIt is meet that worldlings should lead a busy life in order that idleness may be discouraged and the desires may not wander towards unlawful objects.\n\nIt was my object that mendicancy should disappear from my dominions. Many persons were plentifully supplied with means, but through the malady of avarice it proved of no avail.\n\nThe world of existence is amenable only to kindness. No living creature deserves rejection.\n\nThe impulse of avarice, like pride, is not consonant with magnanimity; and, therefore, should not be suffered to enter or influence the mind.\n\nThe office of a spiritual director is to discern the state of the soul and to set about its reform, and lies not in growing the locks of an Ethiop and patching a tattered robe and holding formal discourses to an audience.\n\nBy guidance is meant indication of the road, not the gathering together of disciples.\n\nTo make a disciple is to instruct him in the service of God, not to make him a personal attendant.\n\nFormerly I persecuted men into conformity with my faith and deemed it Isl\u0101m. As I grew in knowledge, I was overwhelmed with shame. Not being a Muslim myself, it was unmeet to force others to become such. What constancy is to be expected from proselytes on compulsion?\nClemency and benevolence are the sources of happiness and length of days. Sheep that produce but one or two young ones in a year are in great numbers, while dogs notwithstanding their prolificacy are few.\n\nThe phrase is remarkable that one sits down [when asked] to show the road, but one rises to rob it.\u00b2\n\nThe difficulty is to live in the world and to refrain from evil, for the life of a recluse is one of bodily ease.\n\nAlthough knowledge in itself is regarded as the summit of perfection, yet unless displayed in action it bears not the impress of worth; indeed, it may be considered worse than ignorance.\n\n(P. 232.) Men from shortsightedness frequently seek their own advantage in what is harmful to them: how much the more must they err in regard to others.\n\nMen through blindness do not observe what is around them, intent only on their own advantage. If a cat defiles its claws in the blood of a pigeon they are annoyed, but if it catches a mouse they rejoice? In what way has the bird served them or the latter unfortunate animal done them wrong?\n\nThe first step in this long road is not to give the rein to desire and anger, but to take a measured rule and align one's actions thereon.\n\nWhen the light of wisdom shines, a man distinguishes what is truly his own. What he has is only borrowed.\n\nIn a storehouse, mice and sparrows and other animals have a common interest but from ill-nature each thinks the place his own.\n\nMost people avoid the society of those they dislike, and do not let the displeasure of God occupy their thoughts.\n\nIt is my duty to be in good understanding with all men. If they walk in the way of God's will, interference with them\n\n\u00b2 Alluding to the Persian idiom. Ba-r\u0101hnum\u0101i nishistan wa bar\u0101hzani barkh\u0101stan.\nwould be in itself reprehensible: and if otherwise, they are under the malady of ignorance and deserve my compassion.\n\nAn artisan who rises to eminence in his profession has the grace of God with him. The worship of God is the occasion of his being honoured.\n\nSleep and food are a means for the renewal of strength in seeking to do the will of God. Miserable man from folly regards them as an end.\n\nAlthough sleep brings health of body, yet as life is the greatest gift of God, it were better that it should be spent in wakefulness.\n\nA man of penetration finds no (preordained) injustice. He regards adversity as a chastisement.\n\nA wise man does not take heed for his daily sustenance. The analogy of bondsman and servant is an exhortation to him.\n\nHappy is he who hath an ear wherewith to hear and an eye to see, for as truth cannot be overthrown, [even] a blind man in possession thereof will not choose a bad path.\\(^3\\)\n\nChildren are the young saplings in the garden of life. To love them is to turn our minds to the Bountiful Creator.\n\n(P. 233.) To bestow in alms a coin which bears the impress of the name of God is very reprehensible.\n\nIn our prayers we should avoid the asking of temporal blessings in which the humiliation of another person is involved.\n\nAs to the seeking after God being thought to consist in controlling the natural bent of the spirit, most people find the solution of their troubles therein; were it otherwise, fruition would in many become a stair to further gratification.\n\nThe material world is analogous to the world of the spirit, for as in the one what is given in trust is again reclaimed,\n\n\\(^3\\) The latter part of this sentence is corrupt in the reading. My rendering is, therefore, conjectural.\nso in the other, works are required in accordance with knowledge.\n\nIn the receiving of admonition there is no respect of age or wealth. No distinction is recognized between the tender in years or the poor and others in the necessity of listening to the truth.\n\nThe prophets were all illiterate.\\(^4\\) Believers should therefore retain one of their sons in that condition.\n\nSince the poet builds on fiction, his creation cannot be seriously accepted.\n\nA rope-dancer performs with feet and hands, a poet with his tongue.\n\nHe who happily introduces the verses of another in his own compositions or appositely quotes them, discovers the other's merit and his own.\n\nA certain seeker after God was addicted to gluttony. He went to an adviser of practical experience, who gave him a bowl made of (the shell of a dried) pumpkin which he was told to fill in measuring his daily food and also to grind its edge a little (daily) and apply (the paste) to his forehead as a sectarian mark. At the same time, to throw him off the scent, he taught him a prayer to be recited. In a short time his failing was cured.\\(^5\\)\n\nWould that we did not hear of such differences of opinion among professors of secular learning, nor were confounded by contradictory commentaries and explanations of tradition.\n\n---\n\n\\(^4\\) \"Who shall follow the apostle, the illiterate prophet.\" Qur\u0101n, vii; and again \"It is he who hath raised up amidst the illiterate Arabians an apostle from among themselves.\" Sur. lxii.\n\n\\(^5\\) Thus, starting with his accustomed quantity of food on the first day, the amount of it was reduced imperceptibly day by day and the patient felt no sudden privation. I have heard of a Bengali Vaishnav s\u0101dhu who reduced his food in old age by measuring out his daily portion of rice in a half cocoanut shell, whose edge he used to rub against his curry-stone once daily, thus decreasing its capacity imperceptibly. Jarrett missed the point of the anecdote in his translation, which I have rejected. (J. S.)\nDiscourses on philosophy have such a charm for me that they distract me from all else, and I forcibly restrain myself from listening to them, lest the necessary duties of the hour should be neglected.\n\nThere are but three causes of aberrant judgment, viz., incapacity of mind; the society of enemies in the guise of friends; the duplicity of friends that seek their own interest.\n\nWould that none other than the prudent had the reading and writing of letters, in order that the base might have no opportunity of fabrication for their own purposes, or of persuading short-sighted simpletons by every specious lie.\n\nThe detection of fabrication is exceedingly difficult, but it can be compassed by weighing well the words of the speaker.\n\nAlthough I am the master of so vast a kingdom, and all the appliances of government are to my hand, yet since true greatness consists in doing the will of God, my mind is not at ease in this diversity of sects and creeds, and my heart is oppressed by this outward pomp of circumstance; with what satisfaction can I undertake the conquest of empire? How I wish for the coming of some pious man, who will resolve the distractions of my heart.\n\nOn the completion of my twentieth year, I experienced an internal bitterness, and from the lack of spiritual provision for my last journey, my soul was seized with exceeding sorrow. [P. 234.]\n\nA darvesh on the northern bank of the R\u0101vi, entered his cell and allowed no one to frequent it. On being asked the reason, he replied, that he was engaged in a special devotion, and that until the death of Abdu\u2019llah Kh\u0101n, governor of Tur\u0101n, he would not leave it, nor allow any one access to\n\n---\n\n6 See Vol. I. XXX. and 468; this prince had written to Akbar regarding his apostasy from Isl\u0101m, and Mir\u0101n Sadr and Hakim Hum\u0101m were sent to him on an embassy to explain matters with an ambiguous Arabic verse to the effect that, as God and the Prophet had not escaped the slander of men neither could His\nhim. His majesty said, \"If he is one whose prayers are heard, then let him gird up his loins for my welfare, and refrain from this foolish prayer.\"\n\nIf I could but find any one capable of governing the kingdom, I would at once place this burden upon his shoulders and withdraw therefrom.\n\nIf I were guilty of an unjust act, I would rise in judgment against myself. What shall I say, then, of my sons, my kindred and others?\n\nThe Giver of desires has committed to my charge many a noble fortress. No one has thought of provisioning them, yet confiding in the strength of God, no further apprehension alarms me.\n\nWhoever seeks from me permission to retire from the world will meet with cheerful acquiescence in his desires. If he has really withdrawn his heart from the world that deceives but fools, to dissuade him therefrom would be very reprehensible; but if he only affects it from ostentation, he will receive the requital thereof.\n\nIf in ailments of the body which are visible, its physicians have made and do make such errors of treatment, in the disorders of the soul which is invisible and its remedies scarce attainable, what medicine will avail?\n\nIt was the effect of the grace of God that I found no capable minister, otherwise people would have considered my measures had been devised by him.\n\nOn the day when the Almighty wills that my life should cease, I also would not further prolong it.\n\nMy constant prayer to the Supreme Giver is that when my thoughts and actions no longer please Him, he may take my life, in order that I may not every moment add to His displeasure.\n\nMajesty. I am not sure whether I have seized the sense of the concluding lines. I infer that Akbar wished it to be known that he had no grudge against Abdu'llah. [Jarrett] [The translation of the last sentence has been changed by me. J. S.]\nThe solution of difficulties depends on the assistance of God, and the evidence of the latter is the meeting with a wise spiritual director. Many persons through not discovering such a one, have their real capabilities obscured.\n\n[P. 235.] One night my heart was weary of the burden of life, when suddenly, between sleeping and waking, a strange vision appeared to me, and my spirit was somewhat comforted.\n\nWhosoever with a sincere heart and in simplicity of mind follows my institutes will profit, both spiritually and temporally, to the fulfilment of his wishes.\n\nThe source of misery is self-aggrandizement and unlawful desires.\n\nThe welfare of those who are privileged to confidential counsel at the court of great monarchs has been said to lie in rectitude and loyalty; no self-interest or mercenary motive should intervene; and especially in times of the royal displeasure, if no conciliatory language will avail, they should be silent.\n\nA special grace proceeds from the sun in favour of kings, and for this reason they pray and consider it a worship of the Almighty; but the short-sighted are thereby scandalized.\n\nHow can the common people possessed only with the desire of gain, look with respect upon sordid men of wealth. From ignorance these fail in reverence to this fountain of light, and reproach him who prays to it. If their understanding were not at fault how could they forget the Surah beginning \"By the sun,\" &c.?\n\n---\n\n7 The XCI. of the Kur\u0101n. \"By the sun and its rising brightness; by the moon when she followeth him: by the day when it showeth its splendour: by the night when it covereth him with darkness: by the heaven and him who built it: by the earth and him who spread it forth . . . . how is he who hath purified the same, happy, but he who hath corrupted the same is miserable.\"\u2014Sale.\nThe reason why the hair of the head turns grey first is because it comes before the beard and the whiskers.\n\nI have heard no good reason from the Hindus for the sounding of the gong and blowing the conch at the time of worship. It must be for the purpose of warning and recollection.\n\nWhen it rains, if light breaks from the west, the air will clear, for, radiance from the quarter whence darkness proceedeth is a harbinger of light.\n\nThe reason why under the Muhammadan law an inheritance seldom passes to the daughter notwithstanding that her helplessness seems deserving of greater consideration, is that she passes to her husband's house and the legacy would go to a stranger.\n\nThe meat which is nearer the bone is sweeter because it contains the essence of the nutriment.\n\nFruit in a plentiful season is never so luscious and sweet, because the source of supply of these qualities is proportionately subdivided.\n\nThe tales of the ancients, that, in certain places of worship fire from heaven was present, were not credited, and it was held to be exaggeration, it not being known that a mirror or the sun-crystal* being held to the sun would produce fire.\n\nFor all kinds of animals there is a fixed breeding season. Man alone is constantly under the impulse of desire to that end. Indeed, by this providential multiplication of the species a greater stability is given to the bond of union upon which the foundation of social life depends.\n\n[P. 236] Eating anything that dies of itself is unlawful. There is a natural repugnance to it.\n\n* The Surya-k\u0101nta or 'sun-loved,' a sunstone or crystal, cool to the touch and supposed to possess fabulous properties because, like a glass lens, it gives out heat when exposed to the rays of the sun. Monier-Williams, S. D.\nA man's being eaten after he has been killed is the just requital of his own baseness.\\(^9\\)\n\nThe prohibition against touching anything killed by the act of God, the cause of which is unknown, is in order to respect the dead.\n\nBlood contains the principle of life. To avoid eating thereof is to honour life.\n\nThe birth of ugliness from beauty is not surprising. Indeed, if a man were to beget a different kind of animal, it would not be extraordinary, for as a matter of fact forms are designed from concepts, and since these are capable of being imagined, their production may take place.\n\nIf the love of the husband prevail, he but idolises his own partialities and begets a daughter; if the wife has the stronger affection, the image of her husband is oftenest present, and a boy appears.\n\nAs to what is said in ethical treatises, that an enemy should not be despised, the meaning is that since friendship and enmity are but phantasms of the divine dispensation, one should overlook the intervening enemy and view the Deity beyond.\n\nMany a disciple surpasses his master, and his attitude to him must be one of deference and submission.\n\nMiracles occur in the temples of every creed. This is the product of mental enthusiasm, for the truth can be but with one.\n\nA gift is the deposit of a pledge and a lightening of an obligation from a former debt.\n\nThe origin of wearing the sacred thread (in a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a), is that in ancient times they used to pray with a rope round their necks, and their successors have made this a religious obligation.\n\n\\(^9\\) Or perhaps 'his own gormandising nature.' (Khw\u0101r\u012b.)\nIn Hindustan no one has ever set himself up as a prophet. The reason is that pretensions to divinity have superseded it.\n\nWhen any one is said to be of a good, or low origin, what is meant is, that one of his ancestors attained to spiritual or temporal distinction, or was known to fame from connection with some city or profession. It appears to me that good-breeding should involve good works.\n\nIt is said that greater friendship is shown by the receiver of a gift than by the giver; but I consider that in the giver it is personal. He does not give but to a worthy object, and this can be evidenced in a receiver only by a gift.\n\n(P. 237.) In Hindu treatises it is said that, in the acquisition of learning or of wealth, a man should so toil as though he were never to grow old, or to die. But since the luxurious, from fear of these two sources of despair, withhold themselves from labour, it appears to me that in acquiring these twin needs of a worldly career, we should regard each morrow as our last, and postpone not the work of one day to the next.\n\nThe Hindu philosopher says that in the garnering of good works, one should have death constantly in view, and, placing no reliance on youth and life, never relax one's efforts. But to me it seems that in the pursuit of virtue, the idea of death should not be entertained, so that freed from hopes and fears, we should practise virtue for the sake of its own worth.\n\nIt is strange that in the time of our Prophet no commentaries on the Qur\u0101n were made, so that differences of interpretation might not afterwards arise.\n\n10 Cf. Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, ch. vi. An old maxim I had learned . . . says, \"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.\" [J.

S.]\n(Regarding the saying), \"the love of a cat is a part of religion,\" if the noun of action is not in construction with the agent, as Mir Sayyid Sharif put it to escape a difficulty, it would not be humane to avoid a cat or regard it with repugnance. The silence of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Saadu'ddin from this (obvious) reply is, therefore, not to be defended.\n\n\"What the ancients have said, viz., that the heaviest trials fall on the prophets, next upon the saints, and by proportionately diminishing degrees upon the virtuous, does not commend itself to me. How can the elect of God be thus punished?\" Some of the philosophers suggested to his Majesty that these were trials sent by God. The king was amazed and said: \"How can trials be justifiable by one who knows both what is hidden and what is manifest?\"\n\nEvery sect favourably regards him who is faithful to its precepts and in truth he is to be commended. If he be engaged in worldly pursuits he should pass his days in righteousness and well-doing, and in garnering the needs of the time;\n\n---\n\n12 The ephemeral controversies of the Court which Abu'l Fazl seemed to regard as enduring to all time, and of which the subjects and actors have long been forgotten, are to be elucidated only on conjecture. The saying alluded to in the text appears to be a parody on the tradition, 'the love of country is a part of religion'. Some traditions regarding the cat have been preserved and will be found in the Hay\u0101t u'l Hayaw\u0101n [Vita animalium : auctore Shaykh Kam\u0101lu'ddin Mkh. b-Ben Isa Demiri, anno, A.H. 808 (A.D. 1405) mortuo, H\u0101j. Kh\u0101l]. One of these, on the authority of Salm\u0101n al-F\u0101rs\u012b, says that \"the Prophet gave an admonition respecting the cat,\" i.e., its humane treatment. Abu Hurayrah, the well-known companion, who received his epithet (father of the kitten), on account of having always a kitten with him, narrated a tradition that a woman was punished in hell for maltreatment of a cat. Ayesha asked him if this was true. He replied, he had heard it from Muammad's own lips. She rejoined that a Muslim woman could not have been so punished on account of a cat, and that the culprit was an infidel. He should, therefore, be careful how he repeated these traditions. In explanation of the grammatical point, I suggest that what is meant is the duty of mankind in the humane treatment of cats, and, no doubt, all other animals; but if the word 'love' be in construction with a definite agent, and it be said that \"the love of Zayd towards a cat is a part of religion,\" the application is censurable.\nand if of a retired habit, he should live in warfare with himself and at peace with others, and regard praise and blame indifferently.\n\nSome are of opinion that the greater the number of intermediaries between him that seeks the truth and him that has reached it, the more the grace of God abounds. But this is not so: rather the attainment thereto is dependent on attrahent grace and good works.\n\nIt is strange that the Im\u0101mis make beads of the earth of Karbal\u0101, and believe that it is mixed with the blood of the Im\u0101m (Husayn).\n\nWhoever bestows his garments upon ignoble people, upon rope-dancers and buffoons, it is as though he went through their antics himself.\n\nHe alone whose knowledge is superior in degree to that of the author of a work should make selections therefrom, otherwise it is not a choice of passages but showing his own merit. [P. 238.]\n\nThe legend of Alexander\u2019s stratagem against Porus does not carry the appearance of truth. A man raised to power by the Almighty does not act in this manner especially when he thinks his end drawing near.\n\n---\n\n13 The stratagem is thus described by Firdausi: Now spies arrived from Hind before the world-lord and informed him at large of how the elephant contendeth in warfare! \u201cIt will rout two miles of horse. No cavalier will dare to face that beast.\u201d Then the Shah (Alexander) assembled all the master-smiths . . . who made a horse with saddle and rider complete, of iron . . . They charged it with black naphtha, and then ran it on wheels before the troops . . . He bade to make a thousand such and more . . .\n\nNow when Sikandar was approaching Fur (Porus), eager for the fray the warriors advanced. They lit the naphtha in the steeds: Fur\u2019s troops were in dismay. The naphtha blazed: Fur\u2019s troops recoiled because those steeds were iron. Whereat the elephants when their own trunks were scorched, fled likewise . . . Thus all the Indian host and all those huge high-crested elephants were put to flight. (Warner\u2019s translation of Shahnamah, vi. 115-116. Jarrett entirely missed the context. J. S.)\nOne should write out a quatrain of Omar Khayy\u0101m, after reading an ode of H\u0101fiz, otherwise the latter is like drinking wine without a relish.\n\nMen give the names of eminent men to their sons. Although it is done by way of good augury, it is not respectful. And what is most curious is that this is chiefly practised by theologians who do not believe in metempsychosis; while the Hindus who do, refrain from it.\n\nIt is a remarkable thing that men should insist on the ceremony of circumcision for children who are otherwise excused from the burden of all religious obligations.\n\nIf the reason of the prohibition of swine (as food), be due to its vileness, lions and the like should be held lawful.\n\nBurial of the dead is an ancient custom: otherwise why should a traveller on the road of annihilation bear a load. He should return as he came.\n\nOne day Qalij Kh\u0101n brought a register to His Majesty, and said, \"I have named this the Khul\u0101satu'l Mulk\" (the Abstract of the Kingdom). His Majesty replied: \"This name would more befit a province, a district, or a town: it should rather be called Haqiqatu'l Mulk\" (the Real State of the Kingdom). Qalij Kh\u0101n then represented his own capacity in affairs. Others who were present raised objections: During the discussion his knowledge of mathematics was questioned; on this he was silent, but introduced religion. His Majesty uttered the following verse:\n\n\"Hath earth so prospered 'neath thy care,\nThat heaven thy vigilance must share?\"\n\nOn one occasion at a meeting for philosophical discussion, one of the poets in the assembly uttered the following couplet:\n\n\"The Messiah his friend, Khizr his guide, Joseph\nriding at his rein,\nOh! would that my sun might meet with this honour.\"\nHis Majesty said \"instead of 'my sun' if you read 'my knight', it would be more appropriate.\" Discerning judges were loud in applause.\n\nOne day the following quatrain of Mulla T\u0101lib Isfah\u0101ni, in an elegy on Hakim Abu'l Fath and congratulatory on the arrival of Hakim Hum\u0101m,\\(^{14}\\) was quoted in His Majesty's presence:\n\n\"My brothers in their love what concord show!\nThis homeward comes ere that doth journeying go.\nThat went, and behind him all my life he bore,\nThis comes, and coming doth that life restore.\"\n\nHis Majesty remarked that the word dumb\u0101lah (behind) was prosaic and it would better run, ze raftanash (from his going). The critics much approved.\n\n(P. 239.) Solicitation is reprehensible from every man, especially from those who are disinterested and of lofty spirit for these defile not their hands save with necessities: therefore to solicit of them is to dishonour oneself and them.\n\nDifference of capacity is the cause of the continuance of mankind.\n\nThe truth is such that where it reaches the ear it must penetrate the heart. Conviction is irresistible.\n\nThe severe illness of the young suggests the doctrine of metempsychosis.\n\nWhat the divine books say, that great sinners in ancient times were changed into monkeys and boars, is credible.\n\nIf the idea were merely that souls were transfused into a few determinate shapes, this would be unworthy; but if the strange workings of destiny joined them to mineral, vegetable and animal life in serial progression till they were exalted to a high dignity, where would be the wonder?\n\nSome of the ancients say that the punishment of each continues through various bodies, and that a body is thus\n\n\\(^{14}\\) See Vol. I, p. 474.\nprepared for the expiation of each period\u2014this corroborates the above.\n\nTo light a candle is to commemorate the (rising of the) sun. To whomsoever the sun sets, what other remedy hath he but this.\n\nThe darkness of smoke is due to the absence of light and its own worthlessness.\n\nWhen the time of death approaches, a certain sadness supervenes, and when it is at hand, a faintness also ensues. This, indeed, indicates that the gift and withdrawal of life are in the hands of God.\n\nThe ear is the sentinel of the voice. When the speaker becomes deaf he loses the need of speech.\n\nAlthough thieving is worse than fornication when it is practised when the faculties are first developed and in old age, yet because the commission of the latter grave sin contaminates another as well as the doer thereof, it involves the greater guilt.\n\nIt is not right that a man should make his stomach the grave of animals.\n\nThe killing of an innocent man is a benevolence towards him, for it is committing him to the mercy of God.\n\nThe authority to kill should be his who can give life, and he who performs this duty at the command of right judgment, does so with reference to God. [P. 240.] When an inheritance passes, while a daughter is alive, to the brother's child, it having been transmitted to the deceased from his father, there is justification, otherwise how can it be equitable?\n\nA city may be defined to be a place where artisans of various kinds dwell, or a population of such an extent that a voice of average loudness will not carry at night beyond the inhabited limits.\n\nA river is that which flows throughout the whole year.\nKingdoms are divided from each other by rivers, mountains, deserts or languages.\n\nIn cold climates such as K\u0101bul and Kashmir guns should be made thicker than ordinary, so that dryness and cold may not crack them.\n\nA moderate breeze differs relatively in reference to a mill or a ship, but what is commonly understood by this term is one of sufficient force to extinguish a lamp.\n\nThe interpretation of dreams belongs to the world of augury. For this reason it is established that none but a learned man of benevolent character should be entrusted to draw a good omen therefrom.\n\nRhetoric consists in the language being commensurate with the capacity of the hearer, and that a pregnant meaning shall be pithily expressed in a manner intelligible without difficulty. Eloquence requires the delivery to be accompanied with elegance of diction.\n\nOne moral may be drawn from the instances of the ruler of Egypt (Pharaoh), and Husayn Mansur (Hall\u0101j) namely that presumptuous contemplation of one's self (khud-bini) and gazing at God (Khud\u0101-bini) are things different from each other.\\(^{15}\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^{15}\\) And Pharaoh said, 'O ye nobles, ye have no other God that I know of but myself. Burn me then, Hamam, bricks of clay, and build me a tower, that I may mount up to the God of Moses, for, in sooth, I deem him a liar . . . But we seized on him and his hosts and cast them into the sea: Behold, then the end of the wrongful doers'. (Quran, xxviii. 38-40).\n\nAbul Mughith Husain bin Mansur, surnamed Hall\u0101j (from his profession of cotton-carding) was a celebrated ascetic and preacher. \"He is considered by the Sufis to be one of their most spiritual leaders, who, they believed, had attained the fourth or last stage of Sufism (perfect union with the Divine spirit). He was condemned by the Khalif of Baghd\u0101d, Muqt\u0101dir and was put to death because he used to proclaim Ana-l-Haqq, i.e., 'I am the Truth' or in other words, 'I am God,' . . . on 26th March 922 A.D.

He replied, \"The one injures no animal, and the other hunts them.\n\nOn this His Majesty remarked, \"If the penalty to a hawk that lives only on animal life, be a brief span of existence, what shall happen to man who notwithstanding abundant provision of other kinds, does not restrain himself from meat? Nevertheless, the thought that harmless animals are lawful and animals of prey forbidden food, is full of suggestion.\n\nLearning to speak comes from association, otherwise men would remain inarticulate. But when the experiment was tried it was shown through the instance of a dumb man, how, though silent in such a case, he might make himself understood by strangers.\n\n(P. 241.) Whosoever imprecates upon another the vengeance of God will not be heard. It was this reflection that comforted a man who had been cursed by others.\n\nSince I used nitre (for cooling water), I recognise the rights of salt (fidelity) in water also.\\(^{15}\\)\n\nWhen I came to India I was much attracted by the elephants, and I thought that the use of their extraordinary strength was a prognostication of my universal ascendancy.\n\nMen are so accustomed to eating meat that were it not for the pain, they would undoubtedly fall to on themselves.\n\nWould that my body were so vigorous as to be of service to eaters of meat who would thus forego other animal life,\n\n\\(^{15}\\) This is a conceit on the well-known eastern duty of protecting a guest who has eaten of one's salt. This protection does not extend to the offer of water, but the use of nitre gives water this salt and its consequent rights.\nor that as I cut off a piece for their nourishment, it might be replaced by another.\n\nWould that it were lawful to eat an elephant, so that one animal might avail for many.\n\nWere it not for the thought of the difficulty of sustenance, I would prohibit men from eating meat. The reason why I do not altogether abandon it myself is, that many others might willingly forego it likewise and be thus cast into despondency.\n\nFrom my earliest years, whenever I ordered animal food to be cooked for me, I found it rather tasteless and cared little for it. I took this feeling to indicate a necessity for protecting animals, and I refrained from animal food.\n\nMen should annually refrain from eating meat on the anniversary of the month of my accession as a thanksgiving to the Almighty, in order that the year may pass in prosperity.\n\nButchers, fishermen and the like who have no other occupation but taking life, should have a separate quarter and their association with others should be prohibited by fine.17\n\nA merchant was approaching his end and his four sons were about to quarrel over his property. He directed them with due counsel, and told them that he had providently bequeathed them equal portions and had left these, one for each, in the four corners of his house, and that when he died they were to take their several shares. When his instructions were carried out, one found gold, another grain, and the other two paper and a bone respectively. Not com-\n\n---\n\n17 This was the old Hindu and Buddhistic rule. Fa Hien observed in North India in 399 A.D.,\u2014\"Only the Chand\u0101las are fishermen and hunters, and sell flesh meat... They are [held to be] wicked men, and live apart from others.\" [Legge's tr. ch. xvi.] Yuan Chwang noticed the same practice about 629,\u2014\"Butchers, fishers, dancers, executioners, and scavengers, and so on, have their abodes outside the city.\" [Bk. II. 5, Beal's tr. i. 74.] J. S.\nprehending this they began to make a disturbance. The King of Hindustan, S\u0101liv\u0101hana, thus interpreted it: \"By the bone is meant that cattle should be demanded (by its holder) of the first, and by the paper, a money credit of the second.\" When the whole was computed, the shares were thus found to be equal.\n\nHasan Sabb\u0101h\\(^{18}\\) was once on journey by sea with a numerous company. Suddenly a storm arose, and consternation seized the people. He himself was cheerful, and when questioned thereon, he announced to them that [P. 242] they would be saved. On reaching land all of them were assured that the future was revealed to him. In point of fact he was undisturbed through his assurance that the will of God could not be altered, and his announcement of the good tidings of their security was caused by this reflection, that if they were drowned no one could save them; had they thought otherwise they would have taken to (vain) supplication.\n\nAli, called also Kh\u0101rw\u0101\\(^{19}\\), used to say that he had seen a person in Bali\u0101 whose upper part consisted of two bodies, each possessing a head, eyes, and hands, with but a single body below. The man was married, and a jeweller by profession.\n\nIn the year [968 A.H. = 1560 A.D.] that Bayram Kh\u0101n received permission to depart for Hij\u0101z, a hunting\n\n---\n\n\\(^{18}\\) This was the famous chief of the Persian Ismailians and known in the history of the Crusades under the name of the 'Old man of the Mountain', by which is meant, the mountainous district from Isfah\u0101n to Zanj\u0101n, Qazwin, Hamad\u0101n, Dinawar and Qirmisin. Founder of the sect of Assassins. The legends about his life are given in Sargudhast-i-Sayidn\u0101. He ended his reign and life in A.H. 518 (A.D. 1124) Enc.

For the man's name I suggest Kh\u0101rijah \"a certain man whose mother is called \u0101mm-i-Kh\u0101rijah who is also the mother of several tribes.\" [Richardson's Dict.], and for the place Malib\u0101r.

S.]\nleopard killed a doe near, Sikandrah; a live young one was taken from its stomach. I separated the flesh from the bone myself and gave the leopard its fill. In doing so something pricked my hand. I thought it was a piece of a bone. When carefully examined, an arrow-head was found in its liver. The doe must have been hit by an arrow when young, but by God\u2019s protection it had touched no vital part, and did not hinder the animal from waxing strong and becoming pregnant.\n\nA mouse will take an egg in its paws and lie on its back, while the others seize him by the tail and drag him into his hole. It will also give a twist to its tail while inserting it into a bottle and draw out opium or whatever else may be inside. There are many such instances of their ingenuity.\n\nIf a wolf opens its mouth impelled by desire to seize its prey, it can do so. At other times it cannot open it however much it may wish. When captured it utters no sound.\n\nThe difference between stone and salt\\(^{20}\\) lies in this, that the former is not soluble in water and the latter dissolves.\n\nOnce in a game preserve, a tame deer had a fight with a wild one. The latter was cleverly caught. Some of the spectators quoted the following line: \u201cWe have never seen any one who could overtake a deer by running.\u201d The point was thus explained, that *ahu* \u201ca deer\u201d in Persian, means also \u201ca defect,\u201d and this is not (required to be) secured by pursuit and effort.\n\nThe marriage of a young child is displeasing to the Almighty, for the object which is intended is still remote, and there is proximate harm. In a religion which forbids the re-marriage of the widow, the hardship is grave.\n\n\\(^{20}\\) I hazard the emendation of *mang* into *namak*. [J. S.]\nMarriage between those who are not related is commendable in order that heterogeneity may become kinship, and between relations, the more remote the affinity the closer is the concord; and what has been recorded of the time of Adam, viz., that as sons and daughters were born to each, the son of one was given to the daughter of another, sustains this view.\n\nAs to the kinship between cousins being within the permitted degrees under the Muhammadan law, this was established in the beginning and was analogous to (the custom in) the time of Adam's birth. [P. 243]\n\nIt is improper to consort with a woman when moved by concupiscence, or with one too young or too old,\u2014most of the latter cease to be capable of child-bearing after 55,\u2014with a pregnant woman or a female during her monthly course . . . [Reason given in every case, not translated. Akbar followed the Hindu maxim, putr\u0101rthe Kriyate v\u0101ry\u0101, i.e., a man takes a wife with the object of having sons. J.

In case she were barren or bore no son, it might then be expedient.\n\nHad I been wise earlier, I would have taken no woman from my own kingdom into my seraglio, for my subjects are to me in the place of children.\n\nThe women of Hindustan rate their dear lives at a slender price.\n\nIt is an ancient custom in Hindustan for a woman to burn herself however unwilling she may be, on her husband's death and to give her priceless life with a cheerful countenance, conceiving it to be a means of her husband's salvation.\n\nIt is a strange commentary on the magnanimity of men that they should seek their deliverance through the self-sacrifice of their wives.\n\nA monarch is a pre-eminent cause of good. Upon his conduct depends the efficiency of any course of action. His\ngratitude to his Lord, therefore, should be shown in just government and due recognition of merit; that of his people, in obedience and praise.\n\nThe very sight of kings has been held to be a part of divine worship. They have been styled conventionally the shadow of God, and indeed to behold them is a means of calling to mind the Creator, and suggests the protection of the Almighty.\n\nSovereignty is a supreme blessing, for its advantages extend to multitudes, and the good works of such as have attained to true liberty of spirit also profit these.\n\nA monarch should not himself undertake duties that may be performed by his subjects. The errors of others it is his part to remedy, but his own lapses who may correct?\n\nSovereignty consists in distinguishing degrees of circumstance and in meting out reward and punishment in proportion thereto. This quality of appreciation adds dignity to the pursuit of happiness and is the chief source of success.\n\nWhat is said of monarchs, that their coming brings security and peace, has the stamp of truth. When minerals and vegetables have their peculiar virtues, what wonder if the actions of a specially chosen man should operate for the security of his fellows. [P. 244.]\n\nIn the reciprocity of rule and obedience, the sanctions of hope and fear are necessary to the well-ordering of temporal government and the illumination of the interior recesses of the spirit; nevertheless a masterful will, never suffering the loss of self control under the dominance of passion, should weigh well and wisely the measure and occasion of each.\n\nWhoever walks in the way of fear and hope, his temporal and spiritual affairs will prosper. Neglect of them will result in misfortune.\n\nIdleness is the root of evils. The duty of one who seeketh his own welfare is to learn a profession and practise\nit. It is imperative in prefects never to be remiss in watchfulness.\n\nThe anger of a monarch like his bounty, is the source of national prosperity.\n\nTyranny is unlawful in everyone, especially in a sovereign who is the guardian of the world.\n\nDivine worship in monarchs consists in their justice and good administration: the adoration of the elect is expressed in their mortification of body and spirit. All strife is caused by this, that men neglecting the necessities of their state, occupy themselves with extraneous concerns.\n\nA king should abstain from four things: excessive devotion to hunting; incessant play; inebriety night and day; and constant intercourse with women.\n\nAlthough hunting suggests many analogies of kingly action, certainly the foremost of them is that the granting of life [to the doomed] becomes a habit.\\(^{21}\\)\n\nFalsehood is improper in all men, and most unseemly in monarchs. This order is termed the shadow of God, and a shadow should throw straight.\n\nSuperintendents (Daroghahs) should be watchful to see that no one from covetousness abandons his own profession.\n\nShah Tahmasp, king of Persia, one night forgot a verse. His torchbearer quoted it. He punished the speaker somewhat, and said, \"When a menial takes to learning he does so at the expense of his duties.\"\n\nA king should not be familiar in mirth and amusement with his courtiers.\n\nA monarch should be ever intent on conquest, otherwise his neighbours rise in arms against him. The army should be exercised in warfare, lest from want of training they become self-indulgent.\n\n\\(^{21}\\) I have modified Jarrett's translation here. There are many instances in Mughal Indian history of the Emperors ordering the encircled deer in a qamurgha hunt to be set free. [J. Sarkar.]\nA king should make a distinction in his watch over the goods, the lives, the honour and the religion of his subjects. If those who are led away by greed and passion will not be reclaimed by admonition, they must be chastised.\n\nHe who does not speak of monarchs for their virtues will assuredly fall to reproof or scandal in their regard.\n\nThe words of kings resemble pearls. They are not fit pendants to every ear.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[The author toiled hard for seven years in completing this book.]\n\n(P. 245.) Praise be to God that this royal treasure of record, this register of knowledge, the syllabus of the volume of wisdom, the summary of administrative writings, the tablet of instruction in the school of learning, the exemplar of ceremonial among men of understanding, the code of polity of the imperial court, this patent of morality in the audience-hall of justice and mercy, has been brought to completion. Much labour had to be endured and many difficulties overcome before the inception of this antidote for the world's constitution, this prophylactic for those envenomed by sensuality and suffering could be successfully undertaken. Many a dark night passed into morning and many a long day grew to eve, ere this mine of the diadem of eternal happiness, this pearl of the throne of everlasting sovereignty could be publicly displayed. What warring of the capacity with the natural constitution took place, how many a struggle between myself and my heart drove me to distraction ere the count of this investigation fleeting as the world, the result of this search deluding as the waters of a mirage, could be set down! Prayers were poured forth before the Almighty throne, supplications were offered up on the threshold of divine light, in order that this amulet on the arm of the wise, this magic spell of those who love knowledge, written in my heart's blood, might have the spirit of life breathed into its lettered form.\n\nWhat toil endured through love that work so planned,\nWatered by tears and blood, should rooted stand!\nAlas! Alas! that one nurtured by the divine bounty and long suffused by the radiance of truth, should defile his tongue with murmurs of toil and labour, and record his harrowing of soul and his travail on the tablet of illustration!\n\n[The author's gratitude to Akbar for his encouragement and guidance during the composition of this book: its high value to mankind.]\n\nIt is through the wondrous workings of His Majesty's favour and the spell of his enduring prerogative that this dissertation has been set forth and a great work brought to its conclusion. That cynosure of divine unity to the virtuous, by the efficacy of a direct intention and the probity of unswerving rectitude appointed a treasurer to the stores of his wisdom and sagacity, and gave him access to the recesses of his sanctuary. That gem of singlemindedness, in honour of the Supreme Being and in thanksgiving for ever increasing bounties, brought forth a work of knowledge by a (P. 246) master-spirit of wisdom for the profit of inquirers, and a royal mandate from the tabernacle of sanctity for the seekers of happiness. By a sublime favour he endowed this fortunate and loyal nature with the capacity of reading and understanding it, and by his all-embracing condescension permitted me to reproduce somewhat thereof as came within my limited intelligence and to be honoured with the stewardship of the divine bounty. Far and near, friend and stranger, participate therein, and all classes of mankind illumine their minds with the splendour of truth. Thanks be to God that in these noble maxims of conduct, the visible world finds its remedy, and the things of the invisible are by them harmoniously regulated!\n\nThe light that o'er seven spheres celestial plays,\nWins all its radiance from imperial rays.\nThe blind need now no more a staff to take,\nWhile those that see find luminous their ways.\nThe garden of prosperity blooms unto good-will and for joy has come a day of festival. The eye opens in cheerfulness and the night of sorrow has passed. Many a truth in the orders of nature and grace, and many incidents of binding and loosing have been set down in despite of fraudulent concealers of the truth, and an illumination of wisdom is displayed for the guidance of the sightless and faint of heart and for the purblind that lose their way. Through a lofty destiny for which sincere loyalty is another name, a new canopy of wisdom has been erected, and the duty of thanksgiving which is the final cause, has reached its accomplishment.\n\nIn honour of my liege, the king,\nWith all true loyalty I bring\nA cypress set in garden fair,\nWherein shall trysting all repair,\nAnd with full draughts of wine elate,\nIts happy growth commemorate.\n\n[Firdausi wrote his Book of Kings in 30 years, but earned obloquy by demanding from his royal master payment in gold commensurate with the size of his epic. Abul Fazl, in a nobler spirit has written his Book of Akbar in seven years out of pure gratitude to his master, who has made his subjects happy and prosperous and set up a model of wise and beneficent government before all mankind.]\n\nNotwithstanding the coming and going of so many leaders of the caravans of knowledge and the gathering together of treatises from the schools of learning, to-day only can the purity of the jewel of wisdom be assayed and its weight tested by another scale\u2014now only is sovereign intellect arrayed on the throne of empire and its sway enforced by a later ordinance. Now must the field of gift and offering be made wide and the festal melodies and peans of success resound, but not as Firdausi, who in a\ngrovelling spirit, fell into the aberration of greed and made\nthe curtain of his honour an object for the haggling of traffic.\nHe was a seller of words and knew not their value.\nThinking them interchangeable with a few pieces of metal,\nlike shameless hucksters of the market, he lost his credit\nin stickling for price. He sought to make rateable worth\nincalculable, and the measurable measureless.

To the rich and prosperous it adds another dignity: the wise that love truth it favours with another aid. The simple-minded that seek after happiness are familiarized with the gains and losses of life, and it pours out for the many who resent the disappointments of toil, the healing balm of resignation. To the faint of heart it lends courage: to those who have the craft of the fox it gives the boldness of the lion and the fury of the alligator. Upon the intolerant and narrow-minded it bestows cheerfulness and large views, and stimulates the magnanimous and raises them to the pinnacle of greatness.\n\nAlthough to outward appearance he was but rendering a service to the great ones of the earth, he was implicitly bearing the jewels of his wisdom to the market of appreciation. Had he not been under the influence of cupidity, nor exposed his penetrating genius to the spoil of misplaced desire, he could never have been sufficiently grateful for the divine favour in the opportunity of winning the applause and admiration of mankind. Nay, had he possessed any\nsense of justice and any knowledge of the world, besides this rare product of intellect, he would have carried some substantial offering to the throne of majesty, in order that the royal approval might be the means of displaying the quality of his jewel, and that he might bequeath as a gift of price, a memorial to his successors in the pursuit of intellectual fame.\n\nPraise be to God! that by the divine grace and providential assistance, I have not set my heart upon the composition of this work with a view to approbation or to listen to my own praises, into which pitfall of the imagination so many have sunk, nor suffered my natural constitution to be trodden under foot by ambition, not even with regard\\(^1\\) to the large field of its acquired characteristics, far less its innate qualities in any abundance.\n\nHe who is deficient in a lofty spirit and noble sentiments is ensnared by a desire of worldly goods. But even the stranger knows that the [P. 248] odour of misrepresentation has not entered my nostrils, and the alien recognises in me a critical judge. What analogy is there between the painted silks of China and the raw yarn of a hair-rope maker? between a keen blade of Egypt and a piece of coarse iron? How can the priceless gem of truth descend to the level of worldly potsherds? Why exchange eternal bliss for the silvered inanities that soon decay? And especially at this time when by the wondrous workings of destiny and a smiling fortune, priceless jewels are but as gravel before the palace of auspiciousness, and my loyal spirit, illumined by the rays of wisdom, has found rest on the heights of joy. Were I even destitute of the goods that pass from hand to hand in the market-square of the material world, and fortune through malice or fickleness, sent not wealth to serve me, I would never entertain such a feeling nor approve in my\n\n\\(^1\\) I should alter the punctuation of the text and place the stop after tabi'at-i-u.

The second consideration of the mind with a view to human needs is that the eminent men of future time and the learned of the present, may bring up gems of purest ray from this fathomless sea to beautify the mansions of their deeds. Had I possessed a lofty spirit, I should not have descended from the summit of the heights of unity to the level of polytheism, but what is to be done?\u00b2 I quote the words used by the leader of the enlightened minds of the past, the spiritual doctor (Maul\u0101n\u0101 Rumi)\u2014\n\nSince I am linked with those who see awry,\nIdolater!

Abul Fazl's success in life illustrates this truth.]\n\nThough every one cannot comprehend the object of this fast in the morning of existence and this mirage in the noon of life, I think that all should perceive and bear in mind that the exertions of the wise and the good should be restricted to two objects, and the supreme purpose of pursuit in those of lofty penetration and wakeful destiny should not exceed these. The first is to secure the benediction of God and to lay the foundations of a stately fabric in the pleasant meads of His holy pleasure, and this is the means to eternal life and the nature of enduring bliss.

Biography xvii.\nfor their abode go not down unto death, and the sound of body therein behold not the face of sickness. Its vigorous dwellers know not of debility, nor those that thrive there, of decay. Wealth does not decline in poverty, and loss of vision enters not therein. This is to be obtained only by a sincere intention and the possession of the four excellent qualities together with the avoidance of the eight vicious characteristics of which books of wisdom have fully treated. The second is a good repute in this fleeting world, which signifies an enduring existence and a second life. Although this also is accomplished through the same source of enlightenment by which a virtuous disposition is formed, yet it is chiefly secured by a smooth tongue and an open hand, and sincerity of intention and rectitude of mind are not imperative. Blest is he who by the divine auspices links the first with the second, and prospers in the temporal as well as in the spiritual world. The means adopted by the seekers of truth to participate in social enjoyments and yet to win peace with some comfort to their consciences, are these, that with strenuous endeavour and by the favour of fortune, [P. 249] they separate good resolutions and virtuous conduct from the disorders of self-regard and the labyrinth of hypocrisy, and submitting their minds to the dictates of sovereign reason and the divine pleasure, live apart from the blame and praise of mankind; and the profit which these simple dealers obtain from their inestimable lives and the advantage secured by their exertions, are a perpetual remembrance and an illustrious name.\n\nThe leaders in the four quarters of the visible and invisible worlds, and the deep thinkers that betake themselves both to occupation and retirement, who through their comprehensive views and wide survey of the field of knowledge penetrate the mysteries of these two sublime principles, sustain by the grace of God the weight of the two worlds on the shoulders of their capacity, and in the strength of the Almighty arm move lightly under the burden. The harmo-\nnious operation of these two opposite interests, one alone of which is rarely attainable under the most capable and statesmanlike administrators even under the sanction of penal law, is by them so successfully carried out under the guidance of celestial favour that the primordial intelligence of nature itself stands amazed and the wonder-working heavens are confounded. By them, moreover, the sources of advantage and detriment, both temporal and spiritual, are commanded, and these antagonistic dual elements simultaneously co-operate in the establishment of festal conviviality of intercourse.\n\n[Akbar's unrivalled greatness as a ruler and Abul Fazl's duty to record His Majesty's great acts and rules for the benefit of posterity.]\n\nAnd for exemplar of such a one, lo! from the brow of this prosperous reign that irradiates the face of the State, what splendour is reflected and as a glory shines upon the raiser of its auspicious banner in this our happy age!

May the Almighty vouchsafe long life to this incomparable wonder of the kingdom of wisdom, and eternal happiness to his subjects. This sovereign of the orders of nature and grace, by the light of his God-given intelligence and the night-beacon of his powerful will, has so organized the measureless limits of these two dominions and moves through them with such prudence and sagacity, that aspiring discerners of each form of progress look to no other than him, and each and all consider as their own this pearl of wisdom that enlightens the world.

Thus he has outward obligation with liberty of spirit.\n\nLo! from his brow behold the pure of sight\nGod's love and knowledge beam with radiant light.\nA crowned monarch\u2014a throne's rightful heir\u2014\nLord of the world\u2014the kingdom's founder there!\n\n[P. 250.]\n\nIt is imperative upon the ambition of all masters of eloquence to decorate the ears and throat of the age with a description of the virtues of such a choice specimen of the court of existence and to adorn with its beauty the bosom and skirt of Time. A rare treasure will thus be prepared for future travellers in the caravans of being, and seekers from afar will come into the possession of knowledge. Although the spheres themselves in their courses by gesture and speech, tell thereof and transmit it to succeeding generations, yet by the workings of destiny accidents befall and the thread of continuity is often severed. When, however, works are written to record these wondrous deeds and they are inscribed upon the tablets of time, the hand of vicissitude less frequently affects them and they endure to distant ages. A fabric that is laid upon virtue, the summit of the porches thereof reaches\n\n3 That is, preparing for the world to come while yet in this, or facilitating the salvation of others.\nto the pinnacles of the seventh heaven, and a foundation whereon fortune builds is not sapped by revolving cycles.\n\nBehold the recompense of noble toil\nThat guards the C\u00e6sars' halls from Time's despoil!\n\nIt is evident that of mighty monarchs of old there is no memorial except in the works of the historians of their age, and no trace of them but in the chronicles of eloquent and judicious annalists, yet the ravages of time obliterate them not. Of the splendour of the House of Buwayh no record exists save in the labours of the pens of S\u0101bi\u02bf and Muhallabi, and the noble pages of Rudaki, U\u02bfnsari and U\u02bftbi alone tell of the glories of the kings of Ghazni.\n\nMahmud hath many a palace raised on high,\nThat with the moon might well dispute the sky:\nYet of all these no stone doth now remain,\nWhile Time doth roll o'er U\u02bfnsari in vain.\n\nAbu Ish\u0101q Ibr\u0101h\u012bm-b-Hil\u0101l, as-S\u0101bi or the Sabean, author of some celebrated Epistles, was clerk of the Baghdad Chancery office in which he acted as secretary to the Caliph al-Muti l\u02bfIl\u0101h and to I\u02bfzzu\u02bfd Daulah Bakhty\u0101r of the family of Buwayh the Daylamite. He was born about A.H. 320 (A.D. 932), and died in 384 (A.D. 994.) He wrote a history of the Buwayh dynasty under the title of T\u0101ju\u02bfl Milal or T\u0101ju\u02bfl Daylamiyah.\n\nAl-Muhallabi was descended from Ibn Abi Sufra al-Azdi and was appointed Wazir by Mu\u02bfizzu\u02bfd Daulah Ibn Buwayh in A.H. 339 (A.D. 950). Ibn Khallak\u0101n says that his powerful influence and firm administration, as well as his acquaintance with literature, made him celebrated. He was born in A.H. 291 (A.D. 903) and died in A.H. 352 (963), and was buried at Baghdad. A few of his verses are given by his biographer.\n\nRudaki flourished in the reign of Amir Nasr, son of Ahmad of the Sam\u0101nide dynasty, and was extraordinarily favoured by that prince. He turned the Arabic translation of Pilnay's 'Fables' into Persian verse in A.H. 313 (A.D. 925), and was the first who wrote a Diw\u0101n or collection of odes in Persian. He died in A.H. 343 (A.D. 954). Beale. U\u02bfnsari lived in the court of Mahmud of Ghazni and wrote an heroic poem on the deeds of Sult\u0101n Mahmud. He was also the author of a Diw\u0101n. He ranked not only as one of the first poets in that celebrated court, but was versed in all the learning of that age. His death is placed variously in A.H. 1040 and 1049.

By this means the writer will secure a determinate sustenance from these divine treasures and a large provision from the table of manifold graces.\n\nThis lasting work I consecrate to Fame,\nAnd to all time commemorate his name;\nAbove its page its syllables enrolled\nShall turn the pen that writes them into gold.\n\nBut if through the strange effects of self-interest such fact is unperceived and this pious intention is hidden from his view, at least this measure of knowledge will be secured and the collyrium of vision in this sufficiency will be prepared, that the design of the mind that employs the pen and the object of this benevolent purpose is the happiness of the people [P. 251] at large and the prosperity of the commonwealth.\n\n[This history is intended to serve as a lesson-book of political science for the instruction of mankind and as a moral treatise for the practical teaching of subjects in the right conduct of life.]\n\nThe primary purpose of these annals of wisdom is the distinguishing of right from wrong, for the feet of many have been worn in the search of this recognition and have effected nothing; and secondly, to appreciate the results of virtuous and vicious conduct, of which this work is full.

Dumb as I am and dejected of heart, what are these vain imaginings and this apparatus of chronicle and pen-craft! What connection is there between enemies of the flesh who love retirement, and the showy and affected scribblers of the world? And what analogy between those who abate the price of their own wares and the displayers of adulterated goods?\n\nMy thoughts do modestly my works decry\nWhile Gebirs, Moslems hawking run, \"who'll buy?\"\n\n[Abul Fazl's early studies\u2014his mental conflict and despair.]\n\nHow shall I write of the strange ways of fortune and the delusive workings of destiny? In the beginnings of knowledge, I was overwhelmed with sorrow at the thought of existence, and at sacred places and auspicious times I prayed for release from the flesh. But, unawares, my spirit drew me by degrees to the school of research, and in confusion of heart which leads men astray, I sought the world. The ordinary course of learning was opened before me, and my mind became stored with ample measure of knowledge which raised in me an extraordinary arrogance. Under the guidance of a happy fortune, from a perusal of the works of the ancients, my mind was convinced that men must necessarily be comprised under three classes. The first is characterized by evil disposition and conduct, and this is evidenced in the traducing of one's neighbour and disclosing his faults. The second by good intentions and virtuous purposes; and the\npossessor of these they describe as half a man. From amiableness in his judgments and a large tolerance of views, he speaks charitably of all men. The third by a lofty spirit and eminent virtue; and these reveal the perfect man. The master of these qualities from transcendent elevation of mind, regards not mankind at all, and, therefore, much less virtue and vice in the abstract. Objective ideas find no entrance into his mind. His contemplation ever traverses the field of his own heart, and discovering his own defects, he labours to remedy them, and finally he adorns the sanctuary of his soul with the true principles of virtue in the hope of attaining by their means to the goal of deliverance in the fruition of eternal bliss. When I read these seductive and winning numbers on the dice-tables of wisdom, I woke somewhat from my slumber and began to inquire. Withdrawing from worldly concerns, I fell to a critical introspection and began to transcribe the roll of my sins. When I had traversed a portion of this terrible road, veils in fold on fold were suspended before my vision. It [P. 252] seemed as though I could not advance a step, and save a few venial errors which I had committed in my youth, I believed myself innocent. As the very delusion of this mocking fancy awoke me to consciousness, I was not undone by my spiritual enemies. I was compelled to turn back and alighted at the first station of abstraction from being, and made the transcription of the failings of my fellow creatures a mirrored reflection of my own. I thus became aware of many reprehensible qualities. In this ghostly and spiritual warring and distress of mind and body, leaving the recess of seclusion, I came to the court of His Majesty and the star of my fortune rose on the horizon of desire.\n\n[Abul Fazl's mind was liberalised and his spirits exhilarated by his contact with Akbar.]\n\n*The influence of the Sanskrit Schools of Philosophy is here very distinct. This passage breathes the spirit of the Vedanta,*\nBy his great condescension His Majesty resolved my doubts, and I surmounted the heights of the visible and invisible worlds. I was honoured with the guardianship of the treasure of truth and entrusted with the keys of familiar intercourse, as has been briefly adverted to at the close of the first and second books. My heart emptied itself forth, and a treatise on morals was composed. A new life arose in the framework of language. For a long period the provision of bodily sustenance, the furnishing of which is approved in the truth-desiring eyes of sovereign reason, made my mind uneasy. What I had read in ancient works, occasioned only further bewilderment. One morning I craved for a scintillation from the court of the lord of light, and sought the exhibition of the talisman that resolved all difficulties. And as fortune befriended me and my heart was attentive, a refulgence from the luminary of grace shed its rays and the wondrous enigma was solved, and it was made clear that daily provision was under the pledge of royal justice and the acceptance of duty by grateful servants, as I have to some extent notified at the beginning of the last book. Most strange of all, however much from time to time the desire for seclusion which innate in me renewed its impulse, the thought of increased worldly advancement likewise gained strength. With this provision secured of appropriate sustenance and due supply of bodily vigour on which the success of every undertaking depends, I withdrew from various other pre-occupations and turned my attention strenuously to military matters, and like those exclusively occupied in business, whom more solemn considerations do not affect, severing not the night from day, I sat at the gate of expectation. Since in this profession centres the interest of life and\n\n---\n\n* He required a large provision. His enormous appetite needed for its gratification or surfeit twenty-two *sars* of solid food daily. See Vol. I. Biography, xxviii.

Biography, xv.\nit adorns the acquisition of perfect and accurate judgment, in uniting the coruscation of political ability with the glitter of the sword, my whole ambition was to perform some service and to dare some signal deed in honour of this chosen profession, which would astonish even experienced statesmen and amaze the perusers of the history of the ancients, in order that the duties I had undertaken might be adequately fulfilled. This desire every moment increased, but the inopportuneness of the season suffered me not to speak. I had come from a religious house and a college to the royal court.\n\n[Abul Fazl's secret longings gratified by Akbar's command to him to write the history of his reign\u2014the other courtiers envy him.]\n\nThose who regard outward circumstances only might impute designs to me that had never crossed my mind, and I judged from appearances that if this secret intention got wind, they would blame me and loosen the tongue of reproach. But since the luminous mind of majesty is a mirror of verities and a world-displaying cup, without representation on my part or communication, the king vouchsafed to favour and honour with a commission my obscure personality that was unassisted by patronage, and raised me to an exalted rank and to the degree of a very distinguished command. For some days among the learned at their meetings considerable jealousy was excited, and the courtiers had for a long time banded together in envy against me. It was a strange coincidence that I should be about the arsenal in search of a sword, while fate would force a pen into a master hand. I was examining the burnish of the lance-head while destiny\n\n---\n\n7 The cup or mirror of Jamshid, as well as of Solomon, Cyrus, and of Alexander, which mirrored the universe, according to Oriental tradition.\n\n8 He received in 1585, the command of a thousand horse. In 1592 he was promoted to be commander of two thousand horse, and about 1595 to the command of two thousand five hundred horse, and became one of the grandees of the empire. See Vol. I. xv, xviii, and xxi.\nwas sharpening the point of the reed in order that the ordinances of the sovereign might be reverently proclaimed in the publication of these important records. I was a prey to conflicting emotions. Since I had not the capacity for this office, and my mind had no inclination to this kind of historiography, I was on the point of declaring my incompetence and standing aside, withdrawing from so onerous a task. But as I was impressed with His Majesty's knowledge of things that are hidden and with the obligation of responding to his favours by some signal service, I was unable to decline his command. The thought then occurred to me that His Majesty had in view my own application and industry as well as the literary capacity of my brethren, so that the materials which I might with indefatigable assiduity collect together, that accomplished and eloquent writer [Fayzi] might harmoniously set in order and thus bring to completion this stupendous task. In a little while under the strenuous support of a will of miraculous efficacy, I opened my eyes to an interior illumination, and reflected that the royal command was a magic inspiration to literary effort and a talisman for the illumining of wisdom. With a sincere mind and a lofty determination this complex of sorrow and joy set his face to the duty. My chief reliance was in this, that by the grace of the divine favour, having diligently collected the necessary facts and given material embodiment to their spiritualized form, the eulogist of the court of the Caliphate, the erudite scholar of the Imperial House, the first writer of his age, the laureate among accomplished poets, Shaykh Abu'l Fayz-i-Fayzi my elder brother and superior, would graciously supervise it, and under the correction of that master of style, a fresh texture would be hand-woven into a fabric of beauty.\n\n[Just after one-half of this book had been written, Abul Fazl's collaborator and guide, his elder brother Faizi died,\n\n* For the names of these see Vol. I., xxxiii.\nbut our author steeled his heart to carry his task to comple-\ntion, in spite of grief and heavy administrative duties.]\n\nScarce half of the first book had been written, when\ndestiny worked its spell, and that free spirit in the fulness of\nits knowledge, took its last journey and afflicted my heart\nwith an exceeding grief. When, by the talisman of the\nroyal sympathies, I was recalled from the desire of aimless\nwandering to the city of service, manifold kindnesses were as\na balm to the open wound of my soul, and I applied myself\nzealously to my great task. A light dawned on me as to the\nobject of the royal command and the aim of its lofty view.\nI brought my mind to that consideration and with a prayer\nto the Almighty, I set out on the road. On the one hand lay\nthe painful feeling of incompetency and a heart overwhelmed\nwith affliction and stress of occupation which no material\nsuccesses however numerous could remedy, and the ulcers\nof which no profusion of outward gratifications could salve,\n\u2014on the other was the ebb and flow of the sea of my heart\nwherein human efforts were of no avail, nor could the door\nof its secret retirement be closed and the busy world kept out!\nHow can I describe the violent conflict of these two unusual\nstates of mind, or with what capability express the inter-\ncurrency of this strange dual operation. The first conjured\nup in the clear recesses of my mind, a fanciful play of wave\nand leap of fountain with swirl of rain and fall of dew; it\nwove thousand fictions and suggested frequent supernatural\ninterventions [P. 254] and seemed to assure him who chose\nit, of the attainment of the truth and the honour of presidency\nin the state-council of wisdom. From the second, a vision of\nflinty stones, of strewn fragments of brick and as of clod-\nheaps and scatterings of blackened soil appearing from the\nsame source of discernment, arose with a warning aspect.\nCoarseness of speech, scurrility, vauntings and vain babble\nof which the characteristics are a moral decadence and a\ndesire of associating with the base, time after time, in a novel\nguise came flaunting by. Accompanying this miserable condition and disorder of mind, the stress of helplessness and isolation now and again received a fresh impulse. Although it is the way of the world seldom to form bonds of attachment, but rather the more constantly to sever the ties of friendship, my plain speaking and discernment of hypocrisy co-operated with this worldly tendency. Some friends of Baber's household and intimates of long standing withdrew from association with me. With the burden of affairs on my shoulders and journeying over inequalities of ground and moving through perilous paths, how could I in utter loneliness, reach half way on the road, or when arrive at my destination? But by the advent to the gardens of blessedness of one or two godly friends who in this dearth of manhood were obtained by me, I triumphed over all my difficulties.\n\n[Akbar's sympathy and interest hearten Abul Fazl in writing this book.]\n\nStrangely enough, with all this apparatus that inspired fear and this struggle within and without, I did not withhold my hand from writing nor did my resolution flag, nay rather, every moment fresh vigour was aroused in me and this momentous conflict grew stronger and the strife of the flesh and the spirit increased until the light of truth shone forth and my difficulties were solved, the wondrous effects of the holy spirit of His Majesty were again evidenced in me, and my heart and vision were flooded with an extraordinary light. The writings of the wise of ancient times to some extent corroborated the accuracy of my own course and excused my sorry conscience with its ignoble tendencies. What the sages of old affirm is this, that the leader of the caravans of hallowed sovereignty is supreme over high and low, and that the pleasant mead of spiritual and temporal concerns blooms fair under the beneficent lustre of such unique wonder of the world of wisdom; moreover that the visible ruler who is the chosen among thousands of mankind to reduce to order the\nscattered elements of social organisation holds sway over all men, but his power extends only to their bodies and finds no access to their souls. The lords of spiritual dominion, on the other hand, have no authority save over pure consciences, as the practice of the saints in general and of all holy men illustrates. The ordinary class of professors of learning and the shallow sciolists of the world influence solely the minds of the vulgar, and the effect of their instruction is to be found only in such waste ground. But as the monarch of our time has been appointed sovereign likewise over the invisible world, his sacred inspiration has wrought these extraordinary effects in me who am rude of speech, ignorant and helpless, and raised me from the deeps of ignorance to the heights of knowledge.\n\nWith joyful omens blest, my strain\nShall celebrate his glorious reign;\nHis praises shall my pen proclaim,\nAnd here enshrine his royal name.\n\n[How Abul Fazl secured the materials of his history.]\n\n[P. 255] My first care was to collect by the aid of heaven, all the transactions of his enduring reign, and I used exceptional and unprecedented diligence in order to record the chief events of my own time. In many of these occurrences I bore a personal share, and I had a perfect knowledge of the under-currents and secret intrigues of State, to say nothing of the ordinary drift of public affairs. And since the insinuations of rumour had prejudiced me and I was not sure of my own memory, I made various inquiries of the principal officers of State and of the grandees and other well-informed dignitaries; and not content with numerous oral statements, I asked permission to put them into writing, and for each event I took the written testimony of more than twenty intelligent and cautious persons. The flagrant contradictory statements of eye-witnesses had reached my ears and amazed me, and my\ndifficulties increased. Here was date of an event not far distant\u2014the actors in the scenes and transactions actually present\u2014their directing spirit exalted on the throne of actual experience\u2014and I with my eyes open observing these manifold discrepancies. By the blessing of daily-increasing favour I determined to remedy this, and set my mind to work out a solution. The perplexity disentangled itself and my bewildered state of mind began to grow calm. By deep reflection and a careful scrutiny, taking up the principal points in which there was general agreement, my satisfaction increased, and where the narrators differed from each other I based my presentation of facts on a footing of discriminate investigation of exact and cautious statements, and this somewhat set my mind at ease. Where an event had equal weight of testimony on both sides, or anything reached me opposed to my own view of the question, I submitted it to His Majesty and freed myself from responsibility. By the blessing of the rising fortunes of the State and the sublimity of the royal wisdom, together with the perfect sincerity of the inquirer and his wakeful destiny, I was completely successful and arrived at the summit of my wishes.\n\n[How Abul Fazl worked up the raw materials collected for his history.]\n\nWhen I had safely traversed these difficult defiles, a work of considerable magnitude was the result. But since at this formidable stage, in the arrangement of these events no minute regard to details had taken place, and their chronological sequence had not been satisfactorily adjusted, I commenced the methodizing of my materials anew, and began to rewrite the whole, and I took infinite pains especially bestowing much attention on the chronology of the Divine Era. And since I had the assistance of the highest scientific experts, this task also was with facility completed and a separate table was drawn out. When through supernatural illumination, the announcement of a new basis of computa-\ntion entered the ear of intelligence, that old and tattered garment was cast aside and a robe of honour newly woven of grace, was substituted, and by the power of the Being who created speech, this great work, with all the difficulties it presented, was brought to a conclusion, and numerous expressions of satisfaction were felicitously evoked.\n\nAs this world of tribulation is not a home for the wise of heart, the more so that friends who live for the happiness to come are covered by the veil of concealment and on account of the ingratitude of the incapable, have withdrawn their hearts from participation in the false shows of its delusive scene, I looked upon each of my days as though it were to be my last, and employed myself only in the preparations for my final journey. In this sorrowful condition I hastened along my road, and the labours on the fulfilment of which I had counted were not ordered according to my desire.\n\n[He repeatedly revised his composition to give it literary grace.] As by [P. 256] the decree of destiny my life was still prolonged, for the fourth time I renewed the task and gave it all my solicitude. Although my first efforts were now directed to remove all superfluous repetitions, and give continuity to the easy flow of my exposition, I perceived the incomplete arrangement of my fresh materials, and the due ordering of this was undertaken. And since I was new to the road and stricken with grief and friendless, an exceeding depression of spirit came upon me, in that, with all my toil and with such excessive care these many lapses had occurred and such frequent errors had appeared. What would be the result, and where would it all end? I began a fifth revision and went over the work from the beginning. Although all my acknowledged endeavours were directed to immortalize these events and to place their issues in due order, yet as sagacious writers consider that verse is as the savour of salt to prose, I took much pains in the introduction of a few stanzas which should be in harmonious accord with\nthe composition, and many a correction and emendation was made, independently of any consideration of the cavils of numberless critics. The truth is that men close their eyes in regard to their own faults and their own offspring. However much they may oppose the feeling, these defects are approved as merits. I who have made it a practice to be critical of self and indulgent towards others, could employ no collyrium regarding this question, nor devise any remedy for this defect of vision, but on this five-fold revision a rumour of this new development spread abroad. Some of my acquaintances joined in supporting me; others were as unanimous in an underhand depreciation. I formed a resolution, for the sixth time, to set my mind free of its waverings of suggestions, and to exercise the most minute and fastidious criticism; but the frequent calls upon me made by His Majesty left me no time.\n\nI was compelled therefore to present him with this fifth revision, and was rewarded with a perpetual satisfaction.\n\nWhat mine hath ever yielded gem so fair?\nWhat tongue-born treasure can with this compare?\nBeneath each letter is a world concealed,\nEach word's expanse shows worlds on worlds revealed.\nIts every pearl bedecks the earth and sky,\nAnd if ye see it not\u2014be yours the penalty.\n\nIt is my hope that by the blessings of a sincere intention and its own merits, the task which was set before my grateful heart may be happily concluded, and my mind be disburdened in some measure from the distress of its many anxieties. Within the space of seven years, by the aid of a resolute will and a lofty purpose, a compendious survey covering a period from Adam down to the sacred person of the prince regnant, has been concluded, and from the birth of His Imperial Majesty to this day, which is the 42nd of the\nDivine Era,\\textsuperscript{10} and according to the lunar computation 1006, the occurrences of fifty-five years of that nursling of grace have been felicitously recorded, and my mind has been lightened in some degree of its stupendous burden.

By the aid of the Almighty three have been written, and many a secret of wisdom has been revealed and a treasure of truth weighed in the balance.\n\nI bear from wisdom's inmost store\nThe royal House this treasured lore,\nAnd pray its justice and its grace\nMay ne'er my memory efface.\nAnd let this loyal offering be\nAccepted of its Majesty.\nMay God His favour grant benign,\nAnd His acceptance deign with thine,\nAnd raise its dignity on high\nWith thy name's glorious currency,\nThat it from thee may win renown\nAnd link my fortunes with the throne.\n\n[The last two sections of the Akbarnamah are yet to be written.]\n\n\\textsuperscript{10} The starting point of the Divine Era was Friday, the 5th of Rab\u012b\u2018 II.

If not, let others, guided by grace and a propitious fate, set down, year by year, the events of this enduring reign, with a lofty resolution and unremitting industry, in right understanding, with a noble purpose and in a spirit of freedom, rendering populous the habitations of Church and State and fertilizing the gardens of grace and nature with refreshing waters. Let them not forget this obscure wanderer in the desert of aberration and in their glad work acknowledge their obligations to me who first displayed the continuous succession of this series, and suggested to them the manner of its record. But if this be not approved and they desire, by recommencing on a new method or fashion of language of the day, to compile the transactions of this never-fading dominion,\n\nBe it unto thy peoples' welfare, Lord,\nBeneath the shadow of King Akbar's sway.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR.\n\n[P. 258] The writer of this important work had it in his mind to draw up a memoir of his venerable ancestors and some particulars of strange incidents in his own life, and form of them a separate volume which should be a source of instruction to the intelligent who look afar; but various occupations, especially the composition of this work, absorbed his attention to the exclusion of all else. At this juncture a secret inspiration prompted the thought that the world would not welcome the detailed journals of personal biography in an isolated form, and that it would be more opportune to append an account thereof to this work and to intersperse here and there some practical and didactic comments. Accepting this happy suggestion, I have thrown off this sketch and liberated my soul.\n\nSince to vaunt of lineage is to traffic from empty-handedness with the bones of one's ancestors and to bring the wares of ignorance to market, and is to be foolishly vain of the merits of others while blind to one's own defects, I was unwilling to touch the subject or indulge in such idle vapouring. In this demon-haunted wilderness, to be linked by any chain deters advance and the irrigation of the genealogy of the outer world is of no profit to the interior spirit.\n\nBe not, as fools, alone thy father's son;\nForget thy sire; choose merit for thine own.\nWhat though should fire beget a scion as bright,\nSmoke can be ne'er the progeny of light. [P. 259.]\n\nIn ordinary parlance genealogy signifies seed, race, tribe and the like, and the term embraces the distinctions of high and low. Any rational man recognises that the one reverts to\nthe other, inasmuch as among intermediaries in the line of descent some one individual has become distinguished for material wealth or spiritual eminence, and thus become celebrated by name or title or profession or place of birth; whereas the vulgar who, though accounting mankind to be the sons of Adam their primitive father, yet by attending to romantic fictions accept only these assumptions, are evidently led astray in this matter by the remoteness of the line and do not realize the actuality of that patriarch. Why then should any upright and discerning man be deluded by these fables and trusting to them, withdraw from the pursuit of truth? What availed the son of Noah his father's communion with the Almighty, and how did the idolatry of his race injure Abraham the friend of God?\n\nJ\u0101mi! serve God through love, nor lineage heed,\nFor such road knows no son of this or that.\n\nNevertheless through the decrees of fate I am linked to worldlings and associated with those who give priority to birth above worth. Thus I am compelled to alude to it, and to furnish a table for such as them.\n\n[Abul Fazl's ancestors in their home in Yemen. His fifth forefather settles in Sewistan as a teacher and pious man.]\n\nThe count of honourable ancestry is a long history. How may I retail their holy lives for the unworthy inquisitiveness of the moment? Some wore the garb of saints, some were immersed in secular studies, some were clothed in authority, some engaged in commerce and others led lives of solitude and retirement. For a long period the land of Yemen was the home of these high born and virtuous men. Shaykh Musa,\u00b9 my fifth ancestor, in his early manhood, withdrew from association with his fellows. Abandoning his home he set out on travel, and accompanied only by his knowledge\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Vol. I. Biography of Abul Fazl.\nand his deeds he traversed the habitable globe with a step that profited by what he saw. In the ninth century by the decrees of heaven, he settled in quiet retirement at R\u00e9l, a pleasant village of Sewist\u0101n, and married into a family of God-fearing and pious people. Although he had come from the desert to a civilized town, he did not exchange his retired habits for the occupations of the world. Ever contemplative on his prayer-carpet of introspection, he wrestled in prayer with himself and spent his precious days in the ordering of the wayward spirit. His virtuous sons and grandchildren following his example lived happily, and were instructed in the esoteric and exoteric doctrines of philosophy. In the beginning of the tenth century Shaykh Khizr set out impelled with the desire of visiting the saints of India and of seeing Hij\u0101z and the people of his own tribe. Accompanied by a few of his relatives and friends he came to India. At the city of N\u0101gor, Mir Sayyid Yahy\u0101 Bokh\u0101ri of Uch, who was successor to Makhdum-i-Jah\u0101niy\u0101n and had a large portion of the spirit of sanctity, Shaykh Abdur Razz\u0101q Q\u0101diri of Baghdad (who was one of the distinguished descendants of that paragon among eminent saints, Sayyid Abdu'l Q\u0101dir Jili), and Shaykh Yusuf Sindi who had traversed the fields of secular and mystic lore and had acquired many perfections of the religious life, were engaged in the instruction and guidance of the people, and multitudes were profiting by their direction. In his zeal and affection for these eminent teachers and under the attractive influence of the soil of this ancient country, that wandering exile there took up his abode. [P. 260]\n\n[Author's father Shaikh Mub\u0101rak N\u0101gori\u2014his birth, precocious genius, vast learning and long travels.]\n\nIn the year A.H. 911 (A.D. 1505), Shaykh Mub\u0101rak (my father) came forth from the realm of conception into visible personality and was clothed in the mantle of existence. Through a miraculous efficacy of will, at the age of four he\ndisplayed the light of his intelligence and a daily-increasing illumination shone from his auspicious countenance. When nine years old he was already considerably well-informed, and at fourteen had run through the usual course of the studies and had by heart the text-books of every science. Although the grace of God guided the caravan of his wakeful fortune and he had received alms from the street of many a learned mystic, he principally attended Shaykh Atan through whose instruction he increased his interior thirst. This Shaykh was of Turkish extraction and lived to the age of one hundred and twenty. In the reign of Sikandar Lodi he had taken up his residence in that city and had attained to an eminent degree of knowledge under Shaykh S\u0101l\u0101r of N\u0101gor who had studied in Ir\u0101n and Tur\u0101n.\n\nBriefly to resume, Shaykh Khizr returned to Sind, his whole object being to bring some of his relations back with him to this country. He died on his journey. Meanwhile a severe famine had befallen N\u0101gor, and an epidemic plague added to the disaster. Except his mother, all other members of his family perished. A resolution to travel had always been uppermost in the enlightened mind of my venerable father, and the desire of seeing the eminent doctors of every land and of soliciting their godly assistance was vehement within him; but that queen of virtue, his lady mother, suffered him not, and no thought of disobeying her entered his righteous mind. In this hesitancy of spirit, he came under Shaykh Fayy\u0101zi of Bokh\u0101r\u0101\u2014may God sanctify his soul:\u2014and his agitation of mind increased. In his early days of study the peerless eyes of that discerning sage had fallen upon a certain servant of God with whom it was his daily fortune to receive interior enlightenment and (guidance to) eternal salvation. He solicited his direction in the choice of a settled course of life. He received the following answer: \"About this time a certain person will become an acknowledged master of instruction and will be established as a guide\nto those who seek knowledge; his name is U'baydu'llah and his distinguishing epithet Khw\u0101jah-i-Ahr\u0101r, (master of the free of spirit): attend his lectures and follow the course he points out.\" The Khw\u0101jah at that time was footsore from his long investigations and assiduously sought the great theriac of truth. In due time he attained this eminent rank and Fayy\u0101zi learnt from him how to seek God. His seclusion was directed to be in absolute obscurity and his (spiritual) office was determined without formal delegation. Wherever the Khw\u0101jah in his allusions refers to \"the dervish,\" he means this wonder of the world (Fayy\u0101zi). For forty years he resided in Turkist\u0101n, and in deserts and mountains enjoyed the ecstasy of solitude. He had attained the age of one hundred and twenty years and the fire of his soul was burning with undiminished intensity. One night my father, in the city of my birth, was discussing the subject of religion with some godly and pious persons and many edifying matters had been brought forward, when suddenly the sound of a sigh was heard and a flash of heavenly light shone. However much they attempted to account for this, they could find nothing. The next day after much investigation [P. 261] and a diligent search, it was discovered that this mystic personage was in retirement in a potter's house. My father now for a space reposed in the light of his direction and his own distracted mind ceased to wander. For four months consecutively he enjoyed this happiness and was daily tested by the alchemy of his glance. Within a short period, the time of the Shaykh's departure to heaven drew nigh, and with his mind filled with divine truths, he gave forth his counsels of guidance for those who were seeking revelation, and in ecstasy of spirit and with a serene mind he passed away.\n\nThis passage is so obscure from the confusion and omission of pronouns that it is with great difficulty I have been able to disentangle and determine what I conceive is its sense,\nAbout this time that pattern of pure womanhood who had given my father his earliest instruction, departed this fleeting life. The affair of Maldeo,\\(^3\\) caused an interregnum; my venerable father withdrew towards the seacoast with a view to greater seclusion. His sole purpose was to travel over the country and to derive some profit from intercourse with various classes of men.\n\n[Mub\u0101rak's encyclopaedic scholarship\u2014his teachers.]\n\nAt Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d he fell in with distinguished doctors and further improved his knowledge, and received a high diploma for every important branch of learning. He acquired a various acquaintance with the doctrines of M\u0101lik, of Sh\u0101fi'i, of Abu Hanifah, of Hanbal, and of the Im\u0101miy\u0101h [Shi'a] school, both in the principles of law and the law itself, and by strenuous application acquired the dignity of a mujtahid. Although traditionally from his ancestors he belonged to the theological school of Abu Hanifah yet he had always adorned his conduct with discretion, and avoiding a servile following of opinion, submitted only to demonstration and took upon himself the things which the flesh resisted. Thus by his greatness of soul and fortunate destiny he passed from the knowledge of the visible to the understanding of the invisible, and the pleasure-ground of the material world led the way to the kingdom of truth. He had read treatises on Sufism and transcendental theology, and had perused many works on contemplation and worship, especially the verities of Shaykh-b-Arabi, of Shaykh-b-F\u0101ridh\n\n\\(^3\\) See Biog. Vol. I. ii. Blochmann refers to this as \"the Maldeo disturbances\" without further comment. I think he misapprehends the sense. Abul Fazl must refer to the affair subsequent to the final defeat of Hum\u0101yun by Sher Sh\u0101h, near Kanauj, in A.H. 947 (A.D. 1540). Hum\u0101yun fled to Sind, and failing in his attempts there marched by way of Jesalmer to N\u0101gor and Ajmer then ruled by Maldeo the most powerful of Hindu R\u0101jahs. This prince determined to seize him and make him over to Sher Sh\u0101h. Warned in time Hum\u0101yun fled at midnight to Amarkot.\nand of Shaykh Sadru'ddin of Iconium. Many doctors of physics and ontology honoured him with their countenance, and many successes attended him and uncommon precepts of direction added to his fame. Among the chief divine graces vouchsafed to him was that he became a disciple of the Khatib Abu'l Fazl K\u0101zarun. This personage from his appreciation of merit and knowledge of men, adopted him as a son and diligently instructed him in various knowledge, and made him commit to memory the subtleties of the Sh\u012bf\u0101,4 the Ish\u0101r\u0101t, the Tazkirah and Ptolemy's Almagest. Thus the garden of learning was refreshed with irrigation and the penetration of his vision was further increased. That learned man at the instance of the princes of Gujar\u0101t, had come from Shir\u0101z to the country, and the groves of wisdom received a renewal of bloom. He had acquired learning under divers theologians of the time, but in the great branch of mystical contemplation he was the disciple of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Jal\u0101lu'ddin Daww\u0101ni. That learned doctor had first received the leading principles of science from his own father, and subsequently, in Shir\u0101z had attended as a pupil the lectures of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Muhyi'ddin Ashkbar, or the Weeper, and Khw\u0101jah Hasan Sh\u0101h Baqq\u0101l, these two theologians being among the principal pupils of Sayyid Shar\u012bf Jurj\u0101ni. He for a time also frequented the school of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Hum\u0101mu'ddin G\u016blb\u0101ri who was proficient in drawing horoscopes and there lit the lamp of erudition, [P. 262] and through good fortune thus acquired a wonderful extent of knowledge. He had also\n\n---\n\n4 The Sh\u012bf\u0101 and Ish\u0101rah are two works of the famous Avicenna, i.e., Abu Ibn Sina (980\u20141037 A.D.), whose full name was Abu Ali al-Husayn-b-Abdu'llah; the former on logic according to H\u0101ji Khal\u012bfah, but Ibn i Khallak\u0101n states its subject to be philosophy (hikmat), a term wide enough in application among Orientals to include medicine, and may signify science in general. The Ish\u0101rat i'la i'lm 'il Mant\u012bk (indicia ad scientiam logic\u00e6), is on the same subject and by the same author. There are many works under the title of Tazkirah. The reference is probably to the great work of the grammarian Abu Ali Hasan-b-A\u1e25mad al-F\u0101ris\u012b, who died in A.H. 989 or 1581 A.D. Ency. Islam. ii. 419.\nmade a thorough study of philosophical works the principles of which he explained with much elegance, as his treatises on that subject evidence and commendably illustrate. In the same city of grace, my venerable father had the good fortune to attend upon Shaykh U'mar of Tattah, who was one of the greatest saints of the time, and that night-illumining jewel possessing the power of an exquisite discernment, inspired him transcendentally with elevation of soul and sublime knowledge. He also fell in with many doctors of the Shatt\u0101ri, Tayfuri, Chishti and Suhrawardi orders, and profited by their instruction. In the city likewise, he made the acquaintance of Shaykh Yusuf, who was one of the most ecstatic and inspired of mystics, and through him was filled with new wisdom. He was ever absorbed in the ocean of the divine presence, and omitted no minute particular of ceremonial worship. From the holy influence by which he was surrounded, his desire was to erase altogether from the expanse of his mind the impressions of knowledge, and withdrawing entirely from the conventional obligations of intercourse, to become absorbed in the contemplation of the divine perfections. But that reader of the secrets of the heart's recesses discovering his intention dissuaded him therefrom, and he courteously communicated to him that a ship was about to sail, and that he should visit Agra, and if his difficulties were not there overcome, he should proceed to Ir\u0101n and Tur\u0101n, and wherever the spirit led him or a call directed him, thither should he go and occupy himself with secular teaching.\n\n[Mub\u0101rak comes to Agra in 1543 and marries.]\n\nConformably to this direction in the first of the (Persian) month of the Urdibihisht (April), in the Jal\u0101li year 465, corresponding to Saturday, the 6th of Muharram 950 A.H. (A.D. 10th April 1543), he happily alighted in that prosperous seat of empire which may God guard from all adversity! In that delightful residence he happened to become acquainted with Shaykh Al\u0101'u'ddin Majzub or the ecstatic,\nwho could read the tablets of the heart and the secrets of the tomb. This saint, in one of his returns to consciousness from an ecstatic trance, informed him that it was God\u2019s will that he should remain in that city and abandon further wanderings, and he announced to him good tidings and comforted his roving spirit. He took up his residence on the banks of the Jumna, in the vicinity of Mir Rafi\u2019u\u2019ddin Safawi of Ij. He here married into a Quraysh family distinguished for wisdom and virtue, and lived on terms of intimacy with its head, the chief of the quarter; and this upright personage, looking upon the arrival of that nursling of wisdom as a rare distinction, received him with warmth of affection and cordiality. Since he was a man of much wealth, he wished my father to share his mode of life; but by the guidance of fortune and grace, he did not consent, and preferring the threshold of reliance and an independent mind, he pursued a life of interior recollection combined with worldly pursuits. The Mir was one of the Hasani and Husayni Sayyids. Some account of his ancestors is given in the works of Shaykh Sakh\u0101wi. Although their birthplace was originally the village of Ij of Shir\u0101z, yet for a long time past they preferred to live at Hij\u0101z, and some members of the family have been continually settled in both places where they have been the givers and recipients of benefit. Although he had studied [P. 263] philosophy and theology under the direction of his own parents, he nevertheless, as a pupil of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Jal\u0101lu\u2019ddin Daww\u0101n\u012b, reached a higher distinction therein. In Arabia he studied the various branches of traditional lore under Shaykh Sakh\u0101wi of Cairo in Egypt, who was a disciple\n\n---\n\n3 Blochmann has \u201cIjuju (Shir\u0101z),\u201d but Y\u0101q\u016bt gives no such name. The text has distinctly Ij and Y\u0101q\u016bt locates Ij in the district of D\u0101r\u0101bjird, and states that the Persians pronounce it \u201cEek.\u201d One D\u0101r\u0101bjird he places in the district of Istakhr adjacent therefore to Shir\u0101z, Abul Fazl intends this locality, as he shows lower down. The present ruins of D\u0101r\u0101bjird formed the ancient citadel of Pasargadae which contained the tomb of Cyrus.\nof Shaykh Ibn-i-Hajr al-Asqal\u0101n\u012b, and when he died in A.H. 954 (A.D. 1547), my father retired to his own seclusion.\n\n[Mub\u0101rak sets up as a teacher at Agra.]\n\nHe continued his efforts in the regeneration of his soul while attending to the perfect propriety of his exterior conduct, and was assiduous in his worship of God. He employed himself in teaching various sciences and made the expounding of the opinions of the ancients an occasion for withholding his own, and gave no tongue\u2014that fatal member\u2014to the expression of desire. Some few prudent and virtuous persons of whose sincerity he was assured, he admitted to his society and appreciated their merits, but from the rest he held himself excused and avoided association with them. In a short time his house became the resort of the learned where high and low were honourably received. Among gatherings of friends, there were also conclaves of the envious, but these did not depress him, nor those elate. Sher Kh\u0101n, Salim Kh\u0101n and other grandees proposed for him a stipend from the State revenues and to settle on him a suitable freehold, but as he possessed a high spirit and lofty views he declined and thus raised his own reputation.\n\nAs he was gifted with an innate aptitude for the direction of men, and held a divine commission for the enunciation of truth, while at the same time he had the concurrence of the saints of his time and the affection of his well-wishers daily increased, he undertook the guidance of those who frequented his lectures and sought enlightenment, and he denounced all evil habits. Self-interested worldlings took offence and entertained unseemly intentions. As he had no desire to oppose any hostile discussion and allowed no thought of acrimony or servility to enter his mind, he did not the less continue to\n\n---\n\n* Shih\u0101bu'ddin Abu'l Fazl Ahmad-b-Ali-b Hajr al Asqal\u0101n\u012b, the well-known author of the Is\u0101bah fi tamyiz is-Sih\u0101bah (recta institutio de distinctione inter socios prophetae). He died in A.H. 852 (A.D. 1449). Ency. Islam, ii. 379, under Ibn-Hadjar.\nspeak the truth boldly and to reprove evil doers, and did not attempt to win over quarrelsome seceders. And this occasioned that the Almighty miraculously blessed him with true friends and spiritually-minded sons. Although he employed his hours in teaching philosophy, during the time of the Afgh\u0101ns he lectured little on theology. When the lofty crescent-bearing standards of Hum\u0101yun shed a new splendour over Hindustan, some students from Ir\u0101n and Tur\u0101n attended the school of that knower of the mysteries of the spirit and of the world, and his lectures grew in repute, and the field of the thirsty in the drought-year of discernment overflowed with water, while timid travellers encamped in the pleasure-ground of repose. Affairs had now scarcely got into train when the evil-eye fell on them, and Hemu' now rose in the ascendant. The well-disposed withdrew into obscurity and retired in disappointment. My venerable father with a stout heart, continued firm in his own seclusion, and by the favour of God, Hemu sent messengers with expressions of apology, and through the interposition of a man of my father's excellent character many were released from the oppression of anxiety and entered the meads of joy.\n\n'Hemu was a shop-keeper whom Salim Sh\u0101h had made Superintendent of the markets, and who was raised by Muhammad Sh\u0101h A\u0101dili to the highest honours and entrusted with the whole administration. He certainly proved his great capacity, for he suppressed the revolt of Sikandar Sur in the Punjab, crushed Muhammad Sur in Bengal, captured Agra from the Mughal troops, and defeated Akbar's general Tardi Beg at Delhi. He was, however, eventually beaten at Panipat by Bayr\u0101m Kh\u0101n on the 5th November 1556, after a desperate battle in which he fought with the greatest bravery. He had been shot in the eye by an arrow in his howdah, and though in great agony, he drew the arrow with the eye-ball out of its socket and wrapt it in his handkerchief, and continued the fight to encourage his troops. He was taken prisoner and carried before Akbar. Bayr\u0101m recommended the king to slay him with his own hand and fulfil a meritorious act. Akbar lightly touched him with his sabre and became entitled to the honours of a Gh\u0101zi\u2014a slayer of infidels. The deed itself he suffered Bayr\u0101m to execute, who decapitated Hemu at a single blow. Salad\u012bn, a true Gh\u0101zi, would have spared so gallant a foe.\n[Abul Fazl's recollections of the famine and plague in Hindustan in 1556.]\n\nIn the beginning of the year of the accession of His Majesty to the imperial throne, as though wild rue\\(^8\\) [P. 264] were set on fire upon the State with the view of arresting the evil-eye, a great famine occurred, which raised the dust of dispersion. The capital was devastated and nothing remained but a few houses. In addition to this and other immeasurable disasters, a plague became epidemical. This calamity and destruction of life extended throughout most of the cities of Hindustan. Still that enlightened sage remained in his seclusion and the dust of tepidity settled not in the serene chamber of his mind. The writer of this work was then five years old,\\(^9\\) and the luminary of discernment so blazed before the arch of his vision that its expression cannot enter the mould of language, nor, if expressed, would it find access to the narrow hearing of mankind. He has a perfect recollection of this event, and the evidence of eye-witnesses confirms his testimony. The distress of the times ruined many families and multitudes died. In that habitation\\(^{10}\\) about 70 people, in all, male and female, high and low, may have survived.

Text, Vol. II. 35.\nand incantation. Sometimes a ser of grain would be obtained, which was set to boil in earthenware vessels, and the warm water distributed amongst these people. Most strange of all was that there occurred no difficulty of provision in my father's house, and except the worship of God no other thought disturbed his mind, and save an examination of his own conscience and a perusal of the travels of the spirit no other occupation employed him, until the mercy of God was vouchsafed unto all and a universal affluence lit the countenance of joy. The royal standards shone again with splendour and by a daily increasing justice filled the world with a new radiance. The palace of wisdom grew in amplitude and the wares of knowledge rose to a high price. Science in its many branches and learning of every kind were now diffused. New elucidations, high and lofty views and important discoveries were published abroad and all classes of men received countless benefits from the treasury of intellect. The quiet retirement of that discerning nature became the resort of the learned of the universe, and the highest topics were matters of discussion. But the envy that had been chilled now warmed to life, and the malevolence of the wicked increased. My father steadily followed his own course disregarding the fashion of the times and sitting at the gate of independence pursued not the road of prescribed conventionality. Men of little influence and envious, losing patience followed the path of detraction. Most of them accused him of attachment to the Mahdawi doctrines, and uttered the most absurd fictions. They stirred up the simple and ignorant, and did their best to produce keen annoyance by their evil intrigues. The chief instrument in their hands was the affair of Shaykh Alai.\n\n[Affair of Shaikh Alai, a follower of Mir Sayyid Md. of Jaunpur, who was regarded as the predicted Mahdi.]\n\n11 See Vol. I. Biog. iii, iv. ff. for the Mahdawi movement and the history of Shaykh Alai. On the Mahdawi sect, Ency. Islam, iii. 111. On the Mahdi, ibid, iii. 111-115. [J. S.]\nThere is a sect in India who regard Mir Sayyid Muhammad of Jaunpur as the predicted Mahdi and go to extreme lengths in this assertion, and forgetting the other demonstrations\\(^{12}\\) of this mission besides doctrine, works, and blameless moral conduct, adopt this movement. In the reign of Salim Kh\u0101n, a youth called Shaykh Al\u0101i, irreproachable in his character and conduct, fell into this whirlpool, and came into that auspicious city (of Agra), originally for the purpose of seeing my venerable father with a view to a life of seclusion and retirement. Certain seditious men who sought [P. 265] but a pretext, were loud in their frivolous accusations and gave occasion to scandal. The learned of the day who are ignorant pretenders and sell poisonous herbs under show of antidotes, rose up in malice against him and conspired to put him to death, and even obtained judicial decrees. My father did not concur with them and found neither reason nor tradition on their side. They sought to bring the dispute before the Emperor of Hindustan, and strove for their own undoing. The king assembled a council of the learned of the time, and great efforts were made to obtain a legal sentence. My venerable father was also summoned to attend. When his opinion was asked, he gave it against the crafty pretenders who sought but their own advancement. From that day, they maliciously imputed to him an attach-\n\n---\n\n\\(^{12}\\) Amongst these are that he must be of the tribe of the Quraysh and of the family of F\u0101tima. His countenance will be open and his nose aquiline, and he will fill the earth with equity and justice as it has been filled with tyranny and oppression. A rival, also of the Quraysh, will be raised up to oppose him, who will levy war against him and obtain aid of his uncles of the tribe of Kalb. During the reign of the Mahdi, heaven and earth will be pleased with him and there shall be abundant rains, and the earth will give forth her fruits and men\u2019s lives will pass pleasantly, and he will continue on the earth seven, eight or nine years, and dying, will be prayed over by the Muslims. Other tokens have been predicted, such as the black ensigns coming from the direction of Khor\u0101s\u0101n; but these were additions made in the interest of the Abbasides and for the glory of that house. See also Blochmann\u2019s extract from the Rauzat u\u2019l Aimma\u1e25. Vol. I. Biog. iii,\nment to that cause, and on so trifling a point as to whether the mission of the Mahdi is a tradition of authority or otherwise, out of sheer malignity, they proceeded to such lengths that he was ruined. Some evil-minded men reviled him for the Shiah tendencies which they presumed he held, not understanding that knowledge is one thing and profession is another.\n\n[Theologians opposed to Mub\u0101rak denounce Mir Muhammad as a heretic. Before Islam Shah Sur Mub\u0101rak defends the Mir's doctrines as orthodox.]\n\nAt this very time they also made a suspect of one of the Sayyids of I'r\u0101q who was among the choicest souls of the age, whose character and conduct were alike virtuous and his precepts harmonized with his actions; but by the royal favour their arm was shortened from reaching him. One day in the royal presence, they represented that no religious authority should be accorded to the Mir, and that since his views were repudiated, it would be inconsistent to recognize his leadership in religious functions. They adduced some cases in point from ancient Hanafi treatises in support of their contention that the teaching of I'r\u0101q dignitaries (ashr\u0101f), ought not to be accepted. The prospects of the Mir were gloomy. As he was on terms of fraternal religious intimacy with my father, he laid the whole truth before him, and my father comforted him with judicious counsel and encouraged him to confront more boldly the suggestions of the wicked,\n\n---\n\n13 I accept the variant reading in the note; traditions related only on one authority are in contradistinction to traditions supported by several contemporary and concurrent narrators.\n\n14 This was probably Miy\u0101n Abdu'llah, a Niy\u0101zi Afgh\u0101n and a disciple of Mir Sayyid Muhammad of Jaunpur. See Vol. I. Biog. v. Badauni's own version of the persecution of Shaikh Mub\u0101rak is given in Vol. II, text p. 198-200, where he says that Mub\u0101rak first took refuge with Shaikh Salim Chishti of Fathpur, who merely sent him money by some of his disciples and advised him to go away to Gujrat; Mub\u0101rak next appealed to Mirz\u0101 'Aziz Kokah, who praised the Shaikh to Akbar and secured the Emperor's pardon for him. [J. S.]\nand in refutation of the traditionary authority that had been cited against him, he stated that they had not understood its drift. What had been brought forward from the Hanafi works referred not to Persian but to Arabiah l\u2019r\u00e2q, and many passages he quoted in confirmation thereof; and further that they had not distinguished between dignitaries par excellence (ashraf i ashr\u00e2f) and the nobles (ashraf), for the degrees of royal rewards and punishments are assigned distributively to four classes. The first is the pre-eminent (ashraf i ash\u00e2f), such as doctors, divines, Sayyids, and holy men. The second is termed ashr\u00e2f, the noble, that is the officials and land proprietors and the like. The third is styled aws\u00e2t, or the intermediate, which is understood as comprising the industrial and commercial professions. The fourth comprises the inferior orders who do not rise to the preceding degree, such as the mob and the low rabble. Each of these orders is subject to a separate code of sanctions regulating the acknowledgment of honourable service and the penalties of misconduct. And, indeed, if every evil-doer was to receive the same punishment, this would be a deviation from justice. The Mir was emboldened by this assurance and much rejoiced, and in order to clear himself and expose the ignorance of his traducers, he submitted the opinion of the Shaykh for the royal consideration. Those wicked men with their evil machinations were confounded. When they discovered the source of their confusion, they were inflamed with jealousy. Similar instances of assistance such as this were divulged and contributed to the turbulence of the ignorant. Praise be to God that all men agreed in this, that there is no [P. 266] creed that may not in some one particular be in error, nor yet any such that is entirely false, and therefore, that if any one, according to his conviction, speaks favourably regarding a doctrine which seems at variance with his own faith, his motives should not be misunderstood, nor should people rise to decry him. After a long controversy, this point was abandoned and they\nreverted to the accusation of his Shiah tendencies; but by\nthe protection of God the detractor was covered with shame,\nhis infamy exposed and he was overwhelmed with confusion:\nnevertheless, in his recusancy and blindness he took no\nadmonition and continued to seek his occasion, confirmed in\nhis malice, until the wondrous ways of destiny and the\ncaprice of fortune were manifested, and a vast dispersion\ncame as an exemplary warning.\n\n[In 1570, Shaikh Mub\u0101rak sets up as a public teacher\nin Agra. The bigots in envy form a plot to ruin him.]\n\nIn the fourteenth year of His Majesty's reign, corre-\nsponding to A.H. 977 (A.D. 1569-70), my father came forth\nfrom his retirement, and great troubles presented themselves,\nof which I shall briefly make mention as a hortatory instruc-\ntion. Although the hornet's-nest of envy was still in-\ncommotion, and the viper's hole alive with the brood, the\nnight-lamp of friendship dim and even the good intent on\nmolestation had closed the door of estrangement, as has been\nalready alluded to, at this time I say, when learning was\nregarded with honour and the distinguished of the day were\nhis disciples and the numbers at his lectures were in full\nattendance and my father, according to his custom,\ndenounced all evil habits and exhorted his friends and well-\nwishers to avoid them, the learned doctors and divines of\nthe time who regarded his beautiful soul as a mirror to their\nown defects, maliciously conspired to restore their position.\nLabouring under the convulsions of their tortuous purposes,\nthey represented to themselves that if they could but adduce\nsome particular instance to convince His Majesty who loved\njustice, it would signally re-establish their former titles to\nesteem and result in a condition disastrous (to my father).\nOppressed by grief and vexation, they continued their\nintrigues and boldly advanced in a course of detraction and\nby their sophistries and crafty insinuation they led astray\nmany of the courtiers with their show of affected regrets.\nSome amongst the evil-disposed they roused by an appeal to their bigotry.\n\nAlthough for a considerable period this unseemly conduct had continued, yet by the aid of virtuous and truthful individuals, the conspiracies of the wicked had always been defeated. At this juncture, however, this honest and trusty band were remote, and the chief of these intriguers at court set himself to gratify his malice. These shameless wretches and unclean spirits of evil found their opportunity. My venerable father had gone to the house of a servant of God and I had the happiness of accompanying him. That overweening braggart\\(^{15}\\) with his affected haughtiness was also present at the visit and began his crafty discourse. The conceit of learning and exuberant youth possessed me. I had never before set foot outside of college to be present at any public functions, but his vain words drove me to open my lips and I spoke so much to the point that he was ashamed and the spectators were amazed. From that day, he vowed to avenge his being convicted of ignorance, and emboldened those who had lost heart. My venerable father was unconscious of their designs and I in my pride of knowledge, gave no heed. At first those worldlings without religion, like crafty schemers, convened assemblies ostensibly in the interests of truth and religion, and by persecuting assaults on those who sought but quiet, many were hunted to death.\n\n[P. 267] Whenever a monarch, well meaning and with every good intention, leaves the direction of religion, education and justice entirely to a body who are outwardly respectable, and himself assumes in their regard the mantle of indifference, the influence of the truthful and righteous wanes and the crooked-moving white-ants of learning and the\n\n\\(^{15}\\) This must refer to Makhdum-u'l-Mulk, whose bold opposition to Akbar's religious pretensions caused his dismissal from court, his banishment from the kingdom and finally his removal by poison at the instigation of Akbar, if the Sunnis are to be believed. See the notice of his life in Vol. I. Biog. vii,\ncourtiers unite in intrigue against these few and bigotry has full sway. And it comes to pass that families are subverted and reputations totally ruined. At such a time when these wretches had gained credit for virtue, like a bride that is falsely passed off for a virgin and proves a harlot, and when graceless worldlings were triumphant, and the sordid and blind of heart were united in purpose, sympathetic friends remote, the honest of speech secluded, and the gatherings of contention of the profane frequent, these conspiracies were hatched and compacts of persecution made.\n\n[In a dark night Shaikh Mub\u0101rak and his two elder sons flee from their home, on hearing a treacherous friend's false report of an impending attack by their enemies.]\n\nOne of the double-faced and fickle, a fallen angel of malevolent cunning who had insidiously crept into the lecture-rooms of my venerable father under a show of sincerity and was in collusion and understanding with that body, was found and despatched at mid-night inspired with impious deceits and spells to infatuate. That clever imposter at dead of night with a trembling heart and tearful eyes, a pallid colour and dejected countenance, hastened to my elder brother's chamber and his evil spells disturbed that simple soul and seduced one ignorant of guile and deceit. The purport of his information was this: \"The principal men of the day have been for a long time hostile, and the faithless and ungrateful without shame. They have now found this opportunity and mean persecution. Many of these turbaned divines are witnesses and having appointed a prosecutor, have incited him to procure an investigation on colourable pretexts into their slanders. Every one knows the influence these men have at court and how many eminent men for their own aggrandizement they have had put out of their way, and what high-handed persecutions they have enforced. I have a friend in their secret counsels. Even now at midnight he informed me of this, and I have in trepidation come to you lest when\nday breaks it may be too late to mend matters. Now my advice is that they should convey the Shaykh to some concealment without any one's knowledge and let him for a few days live retired until his friends can assemble and he can represent his case fully to His Majesty.\" That good soul [Faizi] took alarm and with much agitation went to the Shaykh's chamber and informed him of the case. He answered: \"Though my enemies may be powerful, the Almighty is vigilant and a just monarch now rules the world. If a handful of godless unprincipled men are unrighteously filled with envy, the obligation of pledges is still binding and the door of investigation is not closed. Moreover, if the decrees of God for my injury have not been issued, though all are united against me they can avail nothing and can do no evil nor inflict harm upon me; but if the will of the Creator be this, I will cheerfully and gladly give my life and withdraw from the possession of this fleeting existence.\" As my brother was scarce master of himself and afflicted with grief, mistaking truth for self-deception as he had mistaken a false pretext for condolence, he drew his dagger and said, \"Practical business is one thing and religious mysticism is another; if you do not go I will at once kill myself; for the rest, look you to it. I shall not await here the day of ruin.\" The paternal bond and fatherly affection induced compliance with his wish. At the command of that serene sage I was also awoke.\n\nUnder compulsion, then, in the darkness of that night, three persons set out, having no appointed guide and unequal to the fatigues of travel. My venerable sire, reflecting on the accidents of fortune, maintained silence, while between myself and my brother, than whom one more inexpert at the time in political dealings or worldly business one could not imagine, a conversation continued and we spoke of our place of retreat. Whomsoever he mentioned I objected to and whom I named he disapproved.\nWith outstretched arm against me comes the foe;\nNo trusty friend averts the threatened blow.\nThroughout the world man and his works I see,\nBut not a trace bespeaks humanity.\n\n[The helpless fugitive family of Mub\u0101rak remove from place to place but find no friendly shelter.]\n\nDriven to extremity, after a thousand difficulties we arrived at the house of a person regarding whose fidelity my brother was assured and of whom I, fasting in the morn of existence and of little account in the market of this elemental frame, had not the least suspicion. At the sight of his peaceful and dignified visitors, the man was surprised and regretted our coming and was in hesitancy how to act. At last he found a place for our lodging. When we entered the house it was more forbidding than his own heart. A strange scene took place and an exceeding sorrow filled our minds. My elder brother hung round me saying, \"Notwithstanding my greater experience, I have been mistaken, and thou with little knowledge of men hast judged aright. Now what is to be done and what is the course proposed, and where may we take refuge?\" I replied, \"Nothing has as yet happened; let us return to our own home and let me be the spokesman, and perhaps the badges of office of these worldlings will be removed and the trouble that threatens be overcome.\" My father applauded and approved the counsel, but my brother would not consent and said, \"Thou hast no knowledge of this business nor perceive the fraud and diabolical malignity of these men. Let us leave this place and discuss as we go along.\" Although I had not traversed the desert of experience nor the good and evil ways of men, a divine inspiration suggested a person to my mind and I said, \"It has occurred to me that if things go fairly well, such a one will help, but in a time of serious trouble it will be difficult for him to join us.\" As time was pressing and our minds in perplexity we set out in his direction. Footsore we pro-\nceeded through ways clogged with mud and reflected on the vicissitudes of fortune. Loosing hold of the \"strong handle\" of reliance in God, trudging onwards disspirited and thinking the world in pursuit, we advanced each step with difficulty, breathing with effort, oppressed with exceeding sorrow and believing the day of the resurrection of the wicked at hand.\n\nAt dawn we reached his house. At the news he met us with cordiality and found us a suitable lodging and our many cares were somewhat abated. [P. 269]\n\n[Shaikh Mub\u0101rak's enemies get a royal warrant issued to arrest him for trial according to the Qur\u0101nic law against heresy.\u2014Akbar orders his release\u2014Mub\u0101rak's enemies still persecute him.]\n\nIn this retreat after two days, we learnt that these envious agitators had lifted the veil of shame and openly divulged the intentions of their foul minds and like crafty intriguers on the morning of that night they represented their case to His Majesty and perplexed his august mind. An order was issued from the imperial palace that affairs of state should not be transacted without consultation with them, that this was a question of faith and religion the issue of which lay entirely in their hands, that the fugitives should be summoned before the judicial tribunal and whatever the illustrious law decided and the heads of the government determined should be carried out. The royal persuivants were set on and despatched in search, and when they learnt what had happened they made every effort at discovery. Some evil-doers, plotters of villainy, accompanied them and not finding us in our dwelling and believing a vain report, they surrounded the house and finding my brother Abu'l Khayr in the house they took him to the court and reported our flight with a hundred embellishments, and made it an occasion of shameless accusations. By an extraordinary favour of heaven His sagacious Majesty was apprised of this gathering of interested detractors and their manner of insinuation, and replied,\n\"Why is all this hostility shown against an obscure dervish and learned ascetic, and what is the object of this senseless clamour? The Shaykh constantly travels and has now probably gone abroad for recreation. Why have they brought this boy? and why interdicted the house?\" The boy was at once released and the prohibition against the house removed. The breeze of favour now blew upon that dwelling. Since some difficulties were in the way and apprehension was uppermost and various rumours contradicted the above, we fugitives disbelieving it remained in concealment. The base villains covered with confusion now thought that as their victims were without house and home, this was the time to carry out their designs and that some dark-minded miscreants should be engaged to kill them wherever they met them, lest they should learn what had happened and introduce themselves to the royal court and secure justice by the lustre of their talents. Concealing, therefore, the answer of the King, they put forth some alarming and awe-inspiring language as though uttered by his august lips and thus terrified unsuspecting and time-serving friends. And they issued some plausible documents misleading men into wrong conclusions and thus held them back from intended assistance.\n\nAfter a week, the master of the house too becoming discouraged, began to be vexatious and his servants discontinued their former civility. The minds of the fugitives were under apprehension, and their agitated hearts were convinced that the first report had no foundation, that the King was investigating and the world in pursuit, and that the master of the house would undoubtedly surrender them. An exceeding grief overwhelmed them and a great fear entered their hearts. I said: \"Judging for myself, of this much I am assured that the original rumour is correct, otherwise they would not have released my brother nor would the guards over our house have been removed. May not this supposed incivility [P. 270] be only outward? In a time of security whenever an ill\nrumour was heard, even good men, led away by it, rose against us; now if a man like the master of the house, is afraid, what is there to wonder at? and if he intended to apprehend us, there would have been no change in his outward demeanour and he would not have delayed. The fabrications of malevolent reprobates have undoubtedly bewildered him and have induced his men to this, so that seeing this discourtesy we should leave the house and relieve his mind of anxiety.\" Thus reflecting we were somewhat recovered and set ourselves to devise some plan, and a dark day dawned more distressful than the first night, and gloomy was the prospect before us. They applauded both my first opinion and this statement of my views and recognized me as a counsellor and trusted adviser and overlooking my youth they promised not to oppose my advice in future.\n\n[Wanderings of the persecuted Shaikh Mub\u0101rak and his sons\u2014the dangers and privations they underwent when fleeing from the bigoted heresy-hunters.]\n\nWhen evening drew on, with hearts filled with a thousand anxieties and wounded bosoms and minds oppressed with sorrow, we went forth from that dreadful abode of woe, without a helper in sight, with fainting limbs, no place of refuge visible nor any prospect of peace. On a sudden in that gloomy haunt of demons, a flash shone and gladness smiled again. The house of one of the disciples appeared in sight and there for a while we rested. Although his abode was darker than his heart and his heart blacker than our first night, we reposed a while and recovered from bewilderment; but though at the end of our resources and in the depths of depression, our minds continued active and our thoughts were roused to reflection. As we found no place of rest and nothing to comfort us I remarked that we had of late seen all that our best friends and oldest pupils and most steadfast disciples would do for us. The most advisable course to pursue was now to take ourselves away from this city of\nhypocrisy which was a dungeon inimical to learning and injurious to perfection, and to withdraw from these double-faced friends and unstable acquaintances whose loyalty rests on the breeze of spring and their performance on a rushing torrent. Perhaps a corner of privacy might be obtained and a stranger take us under his protection. There we might learn somewhat of the condition of His Majesty and discover the measure of his anger or clemency. It was possible to fall in with some kindly and upright friends and get a savour of the state of the times. If the occasion be favourable and fortune propitious we may again see better days, and if not, why the expanse of the world has not been contracted. Every bird has its perch and the corner of its nest and there is no commission of perpetual residence in this region of penalty. A certain noble, having obtained an assignment of land in the neighbourhood of the city had here settled; we might decipher the impressions of truth from the daily journal of his circumstances and the odour of his friendship be inhaled by the sense of a penetrating brain. Let us therefore abandoning all else, betake ourselves to him that we may repose somewhat in that inaccessible spot. Although the amity of worldlings has no fixed centre or constancy, there is this much at least that he has no further intercourse with those people. My good brother, changing his garments, set out at once on the road and hastened in that direction. Our friend was delighted at the news [P. 271] and cordially welcomed our advent as a piece of good fortune. And since it was a time of insecurity, he brought some soldiers\\textsuperscript{16} with him so that no harm could come to us on the road and we should not be at the mercy of evil-disposed pursuers. In the midnight of despair that ready and vigilant friend arrived and conveyed the good tidings of comfort and brought the message of repose. On the instant we changed our garments\n\n\\textsuperscript{16} Lit. Turks, but I apprehend the meaning is any guard of armed men. They were probably Mughals.\nand started on our journey and by divers roads arrived at his dwelling. He displayed great geniality and did us the highest service and an exceeding contentment was the harbinger of our happiness. For ten days we rested in his house and were safe from the warfare of the world, when suddenly a disaster more overwhelming than the preceding fell upon us from the firmament of fate. For, verily, the man was summoned to the royal court, and with the same strong potion with which the second man had been intoxicated, they finished this one's business and he became more hopelessly drunk than the former. He straightway rolled up the parchment of acquaintance.\n\nOne night, leaving that place we came to another friend. He welcomed our auspicious arrival as a privilege. But as he lived in the vicinity of an evil-disposed and turbulent person, he fell into great bewilderment and exceeding anxiety nearly drove him distracted. When the house was all asleep, we set forth without any definite destination in prospect and however much we thought and pondered we found no resting place and therefore with an agitated heart and minds oppressed with sorrow, we returned to his house. Strangely enough the men of the house were not aware that we had left it. For a short space we who had severed the cord of reliance on God, took repose and thus forgot our troubles. My brother expressed his opinion that our leaving the place was an impulse of fear not a counsel of wisdom. However much I represented to him that the man's vacillation was a sufficient guide and the change of manner in his servants a clear proof, it was of no avail and as the signs of dissatisfaction in our host increased, no other remedy was at hand. When that light-headed, improvident and overreaching individual reflected in his mind that these people ignorant of the inconvenience they cause, will take no hint and will not vacate the house, at daybreak without taking counsel with us or saying a kind word, he marched off and his venal servitors loading\ntheir tents took their departure. Here were we three left stranded in the wilds, in the neighbourhood of which a cattle-market had been established. A strange predicament it was\u2014no place to abide in\u2014no idea of whither to go\u2014and no veil to conceal us. On every side were double-faced friends, determined enemies, base and cruel men, and time-servers banded together in pursuit, and we sitting in the dust of helplessness, in a wilderness without shelter, with gloomy prospects, in present distress and sunk in prolonged grief. However, in any case it was necessary to rise and proceed. Through that concourse of miscreants we passed on; the protection of God hung a veil before the eyes of men, and under the divine assistance and guard we went forth from that place of terror, and abandoning the fears of companionship and all trust in men, we escaped from the reproach of strangers and the God-speed of friends. We happened to come upon a garden where some kind of refuge offered itself. Our lost vigour returned and our hearts were greatly strengthened. And now it suddenly became manifest that some of our graceless pursuers frequented the place. Wearied with our search we rested for a while. Then [P. 272] with minds distracted and outwardly woebegone we came forth. In whatever direction we went, some unforeseen calamity filled us with gloom and our places were scarcely warm ere we set forth again in the wilderness of danger, until at length in this restless wandering and blind vagrancy the gardener recognised us and our condition became desperate. We were nigh expiring and resigning the bond of life. That good man with many expressions of good will restored our drooping spirits and charitably took us to his house and endeavoured to console us. Although my dear brother was still in the same wretched state and every moment grew paler, my spirits on the contrary rose. I read the signs of probity in the countenance of that genial person. My venerable father himself in communion with God was on the prayer-carpet of prudence.\nand watched the course of events. Some part of the night had passed when the master of the gardener came forward with great cordiality and lengthened the tongue of reproof saying, \"What! with such a friend as I am here, do you alight in this place of confusion! Why have you plucked your skirts from me?\" and he acted in a manner which we could not have anticipated. I answered: \"In this storm, which is according to an enemy's desire, we sought withdrawal from all our sincere friends and loyal well-wishers lest any injury befall them on this account.\" He was somewhat confused and said: \"If you are not contented to stay in my house, let us see what can be done.\" He indicated to us a place of safety; the appearances of sincerity were evident from his language and following his wish, we chose a quiet nook and there alighted. We found here a retreat such as we desired, and from that place we despatched truthful accounts to people of just and commendable dispositions and to faithful friends, and each one became cognizant of our condition and set about remedying it and thus our pulses were quieted.\n\n[A noble intercedes for Shaikh Mub\u0101rak. Akbar summons the Shaikh to his presence.]\n\nWe remained a little more than a month in that restful place and my good brother went from Agra to Fathpur, meaning when he reached the royal camp, to make our devoted partisans more zealous in our behalf. One morning that all-loving and circumspect soul returned with a thousand anxieties and troubles, bringing distressing news. It seems that one of the chief nobles and grey-beard elders of the imperial court on the information of these envious wretches, became furious, and without soliciting the usual permission or paying his submissive respects, entered the presence of Majesty with brusqueness and roughly said, \"Has the world come to an end or is the day of resurrection at hand that in this court malicious fanatics have their way and good men are confounded? What ordinance is this that we have;\nand what ingratitude is this now shown?\" My brother who loved peace, acknowledging his good intentions said, \"To whom dost thou allude and what dost thou want of this person? Hast thou seen a vision? or is thy brain distracted?\" When he mentioned the name, His Majesty was surprised at his wrong impression and said: \"All the chief men of the day seem determined to persecute and do him to death and have passed judicial decrees against him. They give me no peace (P. 273) for a moment. Although I know that the Shaykh is in such and such a place (mentioning our retreat), I purposely take no notice of it, and I answer each one of them with a rebuke. Thou art clamorous without knowing and dost overstep due limits. Let some one go to-morrow morning and summon the Shaykh to the presence and an assembly of the divines shall be held.\" My good brother as soon as he heard of this disturbance came post-haste, and without any one's knowing, as before, we changed our clothes and set out and an anxiety more painful than on any previous occasion of disappointment, filled our minds with misgiving. Although it was in some degree evident how far people were in accord with us and what representations had been made by them to His Majesty and the extent of his knowledge of our circumstances,\u2014knowledge that could read the invisible\u2014nevertheless a greater apprehension disquieted us. Without our host's being aware, that very morning we began our journey. The blazing light of the sun, the dark plots of the wicked, the crush in the streets of the city, the movements of the spies, the absence of friends, the lack of these to share our burdens\u2014what power has a pen of wood to tell but a fraction of this situation? and where even eloquent lips would stammer, what craft can lie in its divided tongue? At last with many heart-sinkings we turned into unbeaten tracks and escaped in some measure the turmoil of the city and the eyes of enemies.\n\n[Painful wanderings of Shaikh Mub\u0101rak and his sons\nin search of a safe refuge\u2014no friend bold enough to shelter them\u2014their privations and residence in hiding.]\n\nSince the condescension of His Majesty had newly become manifest, we now proposed to get together some horses and from those wilds to hasten on to the city of auspiciousness and alight at the residence of a certain person of whose integrity we had had long experience. Then perchance this turmoil might abate and the King put forth the hand of clemency. Of necessity, then, like prudent men, we prepared the requisites of travel and on a night darker than the minds of the envious and more protracted than the machinations of the vain of speech, we set out on the road. Withal the inexperience of the guide and his crooked proceedings, in the dawn of morning we arrived at that gloomy place. Our not very cordial host though he did not deny us, yet told such a tale of discomfiture as cannot be expressed, and by way of consideration for us said that the occasion had now passed and that His Majesty's august mind was somewhat irritated; had we come before, there would have been no detriment and our difficulties would easily have been overcome: that he could point out a village, in the neighbourhood, in the obscurity of which we might pass a few days until the hallowed pleasure of the King might incline to favour. Putting us into a conveyance he sent us off in that direction. We became a prey to a variety of sorrows. When we reached the spot, the land-proprietor in dependence on whom we had been sent, was absent. We alighted without a shelter in that ruin in the midst of civilization. The overseer had occasion to read a document and discovering the signs of intelligence in our appearance, he sent for us. As we were pressed for time we hurried along the road of refusal and it shortly appeared that this village belonged to one of those said stony-hearted miscreants. The man in his stupidity had sent us here. With much disquietude and full of anxiety we flung ourselves out of the\nplace and taking an unknown guide we made for a village in the dependency of the capital city of Agra whence some savour of friendliness had reached us. Travelling for three kos, on the same day by devious paths we reached our destination. That good man shewed us every courtesy, but it was discovered that there also one of those vain schemers had a farm and that at times he visited the place. Retiring [P. 274] thence, at midnight with downcast hearts we set out for the city and reaching Agra, the capital, at daybreak we discovered the abode of a (supposed) friend. Here for a space in this dust-heap of disappointment and dormitory of oblivion, this place of depravity abounding in demons, this defile of ignorance, we reposed, but it was not long before he began to speak of those malevolent enemies of God and shameless intriguers. In the companionship as we were, of such a lying, crazed and quarrelsome fanatic, our minds were verily oppressed by a new grief and exceeding bewilderment. And since our feet were worn with tramping, our heads with thoughts of night-travel, our ears with the sound of \"come in\", and our eyes with the pricking of sleeplessness, an extraordinary anguish filled our spirits and a weight of grief was in stewardship of our hearts. Of necessity we thought of other plans and the master of the house also, occupied himself in finding a place for us.\n\n[A good householder kindly entertains Mub\u0101rak and his sons of two months, while they seek for some friend at Court who would speak for them to the Emperor. Mub\u0101rak and Faizi are presented to Akbar.]\n\nTwo days we spent in this interior agitation, and passed the hours in thinking each moment was our last until the recollection of a certain well-disposed person occurred to the saintly mind of that serene sage (my father), and by the aid of the master of the house and his assiduous search he was discovered and a thousand happy announcements brought us security. Straightway we went to that abode of peace and\nreceived comfort from the cordiality and genial reception of its master. The breeze of prosperity now blew upon the garden of our hopes and the face of our circumstances was newly refreshed. Although he was not one of the infallible guides to truth, he possessed a large share of virtue. In obscurity he lived with good repute; he was rich though possessing little, cheerful in his poverty, and though old in years, youth shone from his aspect. We here had a delightful retreat and we again began our correspondence and sought to repair our fortunes.\n\nFor two months we continued to abide in this home of comfort and the door of our desire was unclosed. Well-wishers seeking justice came to our rescue and men of experience and high position girt themselves in our aid. With speech of persuasive friendliness and sweet words of reconciliation they won over the seditious intriguers and ignoble wrong-doers, and next they brought before His Majesty the exemplary conduct of the Shaykh and made their representations in an engaging and conciliatory spirit. His Majesty in his foresight and knowledge of character, vouchsafed the most gracious answers and in his generous impulse and magnanimity desired his attendance. As I was inexperienced in worldly affairs, I did not accompany him, and that illumined sage with my elder brother set the face of supplication to the royal court. At once the hornets' nest of the ungrateful was quiet. The disturbed world was at peace. The courses of instruction and the quiet sanctuary of holy recollection were established as before, and the age again displayed the ways of the just.\n\nLove's quarrels of the past, O night, bring never back their pain,\nNor secrets of the heart reveal as yesterday again,\nFor wearily the hours crept by, thou knowest, with lagging feet,\nBut give, O, give me back the days of love and union sweet.\nShaikh Mub\u0101rak gives spiritual teaching to young Abul Fazl\u2014takes him to join a party of divines on a grand pilgrimage to the saints\u2019 tombs around Delhi, though he disapproved of such ostentation and mystic ecstacies. Abul Fazl comes out of his school-boy seclusion into busy society.\n\nAbout this time my venerable father went on a pilgrimage to holy Delhi and took me with him, accompanied by some of the disciples of his saintly conferences. Since the time he had taken up his abode in the metropolis he was so much absorbed in spiritual contemplation in that hermitage of light that he had had no leisure to observe the marvels of the earth. Suddenly this desire took possession of his heart and he loosened the skirt of resolve, and honouring me with unique consideration, he made me, who over and above the earthly bonds of sonship was attached by spiritual ties, a partaker of his secret.\n\nTo recount briefly; once at early dawn, when his heart was lifted up to heaven and he was upon the carpet of praise and supplication, between sleeping and waking, Khw\u0101jah Qutbuddin U\u2019shi and Niz\u0101mu\u2019ddin Awliy\u0101 appeared to him, and upon this numerous divines gathered together and a conference was held for consultation as to what it was advisable to do, and it was proposed to visit their tombs by way of propitiation (of the spirits of the two saints) immediately and there perform a religious ceremonial after their ordinances. My venerable father after the manner of his saintly ancestors, preserved an exact outward decorum and indulged not in the hearing of songs nor the vanity of silk attire, and did not approve of the ecstasies of music and dance affected by the Sufis. He spoke against the followers of this practice and he used constantly to say that on the assumption of the in-\n\n---\n\n17 The text (p. 275) reads bazm-i-mas\u0101lihat \u0101r\u0101stah \u0101mad, which Jarrett translates as \u201ca feast of reconciliation was celebrated\u201d. I suggest the emendation mas\u0101lihat (=advice, consultation) and take bazm to be Abul Fazl\u2019s usual bombast for an ordinary meeting. My other changes here are consequential. (J. Sarkar.)\ndifference between rich and poor, praise and blame, earth and gold, which was one of the principles on which this system proceeded, it contained within itself the volatility of unrest and he regarded it as a place of blacksiding unto the wise. He commanded a rigid abstention therefrom, withdrew from it himself and restrained his friends. But, in truth, on this night, these slumberers on the couch of vigilance who looked on this ceremony as they would on their last journey, went into such exhaustive proof of the innocence of their intention and the morality of the act that they carried away the concurrence of my father. In that happy journey many of the tombs of those who sleep in that land of roses were passed, and hearts were filled with light, and blessings were vouchsafed (whereof if the narrative were detailed, men would regard it as an idle fiction and in suspicion might impute the stain of sin), until I was carried from the hermitage of seclusion to the court of wordly intercourse and the gate of prosperity was opened and I obtained the summit of distinction. The condition of the inebriate with greed and those who were a prey to envy became gloomy and my heart was pained and compassionated their confusion. I made a steadfast vow to the Almighty and I promised myself that the wronging of these blind souls who are as a lamp without light and an invisible sign, should be effaced from the path of my upright heart and I would allow no feeling but kindness to enter therein. By the aid of the grace of God I enforced this resolve and gained new satisfaction and my mind new vigour. Men abandoning evil-doing took to sociability and drew the breath of repose. My venerable father occupied himself in admonition and exposed the quarrelsomeness, the crooked ways, the untruth and the unworthiness of men and enjoined the chastisement of evil-doers. I was inclined to be reticent about speaking of these close secrets and was ashamed to reply to my venerable father. Eventually I was compelled to represent what had\nhappened to him to His Majesty and relieved the ebullition of my father's spirit. Many of his anxieties were now relieved and his long open wounds were healed.\n\n[P. 276] To make a long story short, when the imperial standards advanced to the capital of Lahore for reasons of state, and my heart was sore at parting from that preceptor of truth, in the thirty-second year of the reign, corresponding with the lunar year 995 (A.D. 1586-87), I invited his gracious visit. On the 23rd of the 3rd month (Khurd\u0101d) of the Divine Era and the thirty-second year of the reign, coinciding with Saturday, the 6th of Rajab of the above lunar year (31st May, 1586), that knower of all things material and spiritual fulfilling my desire, cast the shadow of his beneficence on me who though engaged in the world preferred solitude, and honoured me by special kindnesses. He ever found delight in seclusion, and renouncing all else passed his days in self introspection and in the renovation of the ever-capricious spirit.\n\nInasmuch as he troubled himself little about worldly knowledge, his conversation was always regarding the essence and attributes of God and he took heedful warning and led an independent life apart and gathered the skirts of liberation of spirit until his august health lost its elementary equilibrium. Although he had often suffered in the same way before, he learnt on this occasion, that it was his last journey and summoning this bewildered creature addressed me in words of salutary advice and went through the last obligations of farewell. As all that he said was between us alone and he shared with me in confidence his inmost thoughts, I kept down my anguish of heart and with many efforts commanded some self-restraint and by the miraculous efficacy of that leader in the world of sanctity, to some extent was calm. After seven days, in full consciousness and at the very dawn of the 24th of the 5th month (Amurd\u0101d) of the Divine Era, on the 17th of Zi'lqaadah, A.H. 1001 (Tuesday,\n4th August, 1593) he passed into the gardens of paradise. The luminary of the firmament of knowledge became obscured and the light of an understanding that knew God grew dim. The back of Learning was bowed and the days of Wisdom itself passed away. Jupiter withdrew his robe from his head and Mercury destroyed his pen.\\footnote{In the Biography of Abul Fazl (Vol. I. xviii) Blochmann gives the date as the 4th September, but this cannot be, as the year 1001 began on Monday, 28th September 1592, and Zi'l Hijjah follows Zi'lqaaadah.}\n\nGone from the world is he its peerless sage\nThat to its gaze oped Wisdom's heavenly page.\nWhere shall his orphaned kin such marvel find,\nThe Adam and Messiah of his kind!\n\nThis has been to some extent evidenced in what has gone before.\n\n[Abul Fazl's birth\u2014his early intellectual brilliancy\u2014diversified education\u2014hard study for ten years.]\n\nAs I have now recounted somewhat of my ancestors, I proceed to say a few words regarding myself and thus unburden my mind, in order to refresh this narrative and loosen the bonds of my tongue. In the year 473 of the Jal\u0101li era, corresponding to the night of Sunday, the 6th of Muharram 958 of the lunar reckoning (14th January 1551), my pure spirit joined to this elemental body came forth from the womb into this fair expanse of the world. At a little over one year I had the miraculous gift of fluent speech and at five years of age I had acquired an unusual stock of information [P. 277] and could both read and write. At the age of seven I became the treasurer of my father's stores of knowledge and a trusty keeper of the jewels of hidden meaning and as a serpent,\\footnote{The office of Jupiter in the Oriental planetary system is supposed to be that of a Q\u0101zi, and the robe represents his official dignity. Mercury is the heavenly scribe.} guarded the treasure. And it was strange\n\n\\footnote{The Oriental legend of the fabulous guardianship of buried treasure by a serpent has its parallel in the myth of the Hesperides.}\nthat by a freak of fortune my heart was disinclined, my will ever averse, and my disposition repugnant to conventional learning and the ordinary courses of instruction. Generally I could not understand them. My father in his way conjured with the spell of knowledge and taught me a little of every branch of science, and although my intelligence grew, I gained no deep impressions from the school of learning. Sometimes I understood nothing at all, at others doubts suggested themselves which my tongue was incapable of explaining. Either shame made me hesitate or I had not the power of expression. I used to weep in public and put all the blame upon myself. In this state of things I came into fellowship of mind with a congenial helper and my spirit recovered from that ignorance and incomprehension. Not many days had elapsed before his conversation and society induced me to go to college and there they restored to rest my bewildered and dissipated mind and by the wondrous working of destiny they took me away and brought another back.\n\nThe temple as I entered, drew they nigh\nAnd brought their gift, a wine-cup brimming high.\nIts strength snatched all my senses, self from self,\nWherein some other entered and not I.\n\nThe truths of philosophy and the subtleties of the schools now appeared plain, and a book which I had never before seen gave me a clearer insight than any thing I could read. Although I had a special gift which came down upon me from the throne of holiness, yet the inspirations of my venerable father and his making me commit to memory the essential elements of every branch of science, together with the unbroken continuity of this chain, were of immense help, and became one of the most important causes of my enlightenment. For ten years longer I made no distinction between night and day, teaching and learning, and recognized no difference between satiety and hunger, nor discriminated\nbetween privacy and society, nor had I the power to dissever pain from pleasure. I acknowledged nothing else but the bond of demonstration and the tie of knowledge. Those who had a regard for my constitution, from seeing that two and sometimes three days passed without my taking food, and that my studious spirit had no inclination therefor, were amazed, and stood out strongly against it. I answered that my withdrawal was now a matter of habit and custom, and how was it that no one was astonished when the natural inclination of a sick man on an attack of illness was averse from food. If therefore my love of study induced forgetfulness, where was the wonder? Most of the current arguments of the schools, frequently misquoted and misunderstood when heard, and abstruse questions from ancient works, had been presented to the fresh tablet of my mind. Before these points had been elucidated and the attribution to me of extreme ignorance had passed to that of transcendent knowledge, I had taken objection to ancient writers, and men learning my youth, dissented, and my mind was troubled and my inexperienced heart was in agitation. Once in the early part of my career they brought the gloss of Khw\u0101jah Abu'l Q\u0101sim, on the Mutawwal. All that I had stated before learned doctors and divines of which some of my friends had taken notes, was there found, and those present were astounded and withdrew their dissent, and began to regard me with other eyes and to raise the wicket of misunderstanding and to open the gate of comprehension. In my early days of study, the gloss of Isfah\u0101ni more than half of which had\n\n---\n\n21 Commentarius longior, the name of a celebrated commentary of Saadu'ddin Masaud-b-U'marat-Taft\u0101z\u0101ni (died A.H. 792, A.D. 1389) on the Talkhisu'l Mift\u0101h of Shaykh and Imam Jal\u0101luddin Mahmud-b-'Abdu'r Rahm\u0101n al-Qazwini ash-Sh\u0101f\u012bai (died A.H. 739, A.D. 1338). The latter work is on the analysis of grammatical signification and the explanatory science, i.e., rhetoric. H\u0101j\u012b Khal\u012bfah devotes several pages to its detail and the glosses that have been written on it and on its commentary, the Mutawwal. That referred to the text is by Abu'l Q\u0101sim-b-Abi Bakr al-Laithi as-Samarqandi.\nbeen eaten by white ants, came under my observation. The public being in despair at profiting by it, I removed the parts that had been eaten and joined blank paper to the rest. In the serene hours of morning, with a little reflection, I discovered the beginnings and endings of each fragment and conjecturally penned a draft text which I transcribed on the paper. In the meanwhile the entire work was discovered, and when both were compared, in two or three places only were there found differences of words, though synonymous in meaning; and in three or four others, (differing) citations but approximate in sense. All were astounded.\n\n[Abul Fazl's strange mental disturbance at the age of twenty.]\n\nThe more my will was engaged, the more my mind was illumined. At the age of twenty the good tidings of my independence reached me. My mind cast off its former bonds and my early bewilderment recurred. With a parade of much learning, the intoxication of youth effervescing, the skirts of pretension spread wide, and the world-displaying cup of wisdom in my hand, the ringings of delirium began to sound in my ears, and suggested a total withdrawal from the world. Meanwhile the wise prince-regnant called me to mind and drew me from my obscurity, somewhat of which I have in its entirety and somewhat but approximately suggested and acknowledged. Here my coin has been tested and its full weight passed into currency. Men now view me with a different regard, and many effusive speeches have been made amid felicitous congratulations evoked.\n\nOn this day which is the last of the 42nd year of His Majesty's reign (A.D. 1598), my spirit again breaks away from its yoke and a new solicitude arises within me.\n\nMy songster heart knows not King David's strains:\nLet it go free\u2014'tis no bird for a cage.\nI know not how it will all end nor in what resting-place my last journey will have to be made, but from the beginning\nof my existence until now the grace of God has continuously kept me under its protection. It is my firm hope that my last moments may be spent in doing His will and that I may pass unburdened to eternal rest.\n\n[Thirty-two ways in which Abul Fazl has derived benefits from the grace of God.]\n\nAs the enumeration of the benefits of God is one way of expressing gratitude therefor, I here set down a few of these and invigorate my spirit:\n\nThe first blessing which I possessed was in belonging to a noble family. It may be hoped that the virtue of my ancestors may atone for my unworthiness and prove a restoration in allaying the turbulence of my spirit, as pain by medicine, fire by water, heat by cold, and a lover by the sight of his beloved.\n\nThe second, the prosperity of the age and the general security of the times. As eminent men of old have belauded the justice of strangers, what wonder if I glory in the puissance of the monarch of the visible and invisible worlds.\n\nThe third, the happy fortune that brought me from the womb of fate into so happy a time when the august shadow of majesty has fallen upon me. [P. 279]\n\nThe fourth, my noble birth on both sides. Somewhat of my father has already been said. What shall I write of her, (my mother), the fragrance of chastity? She possessed all the noble qualities of men and always adorned her precious hours with good works. She united modesty with strength of character, and her words were in accord with her deeds.\n\nThe fifth, soundness of limbs, proportionate balance of powers and their conformity.\n\nThe sixth, a long ministering unto those two blessed personages. It was a fortress against outward and inward disasters, and a fence against material and spiritual calamities.\n\nThe seventh, excellent health, and the antidote of bodily vigour.\nThe eighth, a good house.\n\nThe ninth, freedom from care as to means, and happy circumstances.\n\nThe tenth, a daily increasing delight in doing the will of my parents.\n\nThe eleventh, the kindness of a father which beyond the ambition of the times loaded me with many bounties and distinguished me as the true patriarch of his house.\n\nThe twelfth, prayerfulness at the throne of God.\n\nThe thirteenth, imploring the favours of pious ascetics and true seekers of wisdom.\n\nThe fourteenth, a perpetual guiding grace.\n\nThe fifteenth, the collection of books on sciences. Without dishonourable curiosity I became acquainted with the tenets of all creeds, and my spirit was weary of their multitude.\n\nThe sixteenth, the constant incitement to study on the part of my father and his restraining me from dissipating thoughts.\n\nThe seventeenth, virtuous companions.\n\nThe eighteenth, a material love, ordinarily the disturber of households and an earthquake of moral obligations, guided me to the goal of perfection. This wonder fills me every moment with a new astonishment and from time to time I am lost in amazement.\n\nThe nineteenth, the service of His Majesty which is a new birth and fresh happiness.\n\nThe twentieth, the recovery from my arrogant presumption through the grace of His Majesty's service.\n\nThe twenty-first, attaining to a perfect peace through blessings of the august condescension. For some turned from speech to silence; others [P. 280] joined in harmony with the upright of all sects, and for the remaining evil-doers, their penitence being accepted, a reconciliation was brought about. May Almighty God remove the impressions of evil by the rays of knowledge.\nThe twenty-second, my spiritual intercourse with the King of all those that know God.\n\nThe twenty-third, the raising of me up by His wise Majesty and the bestowal upon me of his confidence without the recommendation of men or my own seeking.\n\nThe twenty-fourth, the possession of brethren wise, virtuous, and seeking the pleasure of others.\n\n[His brothers.]\n\nOf my eldest brother what shall I say? who notwithstanding his spiritual and worldly perfections, took no step without my concurrence, indiscreet as I am, and devoting himself to my interests, advanced my promotion and was an aid to good intentions. In his poems he speaks of me in a manner which I cannot sufficiently acknowledge, as he says in his Eulogium:\n\nMy verse may share both great and little worth,\nIts theme sublime\u2014I lowlier than the earth.\nA father's virtues shall it far proclaim\nAnd vaunt the glory of a brother's fame;\nHe, touchstone of all wisdom, who inspires\nMy strain with sweetness that a world admires;\nIf through a riper age, I pass him by,\nIn merit, centuries between us lie.\nWhat though the branching savin taller grows,\nWhat gardener mates its beauty with the rose?\n\nHe was born in the Jal\u0101li year 469, corresponding to A.H. 954 (A.D. 1547). In what tongue shall I indite his praise? In this work I have already written of him and poured forth the anguish of my heart, and quenched its furnace with the water of narration and broken the dam of its torrents and alleviated my want of resignation. His works which are the scales of eloquence and penetration and the lawns of the birds of song, praise him and speak his perfections and recall his virtues.\n\nSee Vol. I. p. 548.\nAnother was Shaykh Abu'l Barak\u0101t. He was born on the night of the 6th of Mihr M\u0101h (September) of the Jal\u0101li year 475, corresponding to the night of the 17th Shaww\u0101l, A.H. 960 (25th September 1553). Although he has not attained to any high distinction in learning, he has nevertheless a considerable share of erudition, and in knowledge of affairs and as a military leader and for his practical sagacity he is considered one of the foremost. He is especially distinguished for his goodness of disposition, his reverence for holy men, and his benevolence.\n\nAnother was Shaykh Abu'l Khayr. He was born on the 10th of Isfand\u0101rmus (February) in the fourth year of His Majesty's reign, corresponding to Monday, the 22nd of Jum\u0101da I., A.H. 967 (18th February 1560). The highest morals and most excellent qualities distinguished his disposition. He understood the temper of the times and kept his tongue like all his other members under the command of reason.\n\n[P. 281] The next was Shaykh Abu'l Mak\u0101rim. His birth took place on the night of the 1st of Urdibihisht (April) in the 14th year of His Majesty's reign, corresponding to Monday, the 23rd of Shaww\u0101l, A.H. 976 (9th April 1569). Although at first he was a little unruly, the miraculous efficacy of my venerable father's will brought him back to the path of duty and rectitude and he read much of philosophy and tradition under that discerner of the mysteries of the spiritual and material worlds. Somewhat before his study of the ancient philosophers he read with Amir Fath u'llah Shir\u0101zi. He walks with circumspection and I trust he may reach the goal of his desire.\n\nThe next was Shaykh Abu Tur\u0101b. He was born on the 1st of Bahman M\u0101h (January), in the 29th year of the reign corresponding to Friday, 23rd of Zi'l Hijjah, A.H. 988 (27th\n\n---\n\n23 See Vol. I. p. 33. Vol. II. p. 30.\nJanuary 1581). Although he was by another mother, he has the happiness of being admitted to court and occupies himself in the acquisition of all perfections.\n\nThe next was Shaykh Abu'l H\u0101mid. He was born on the 6th of Day M\u0101h (December) the 30th of the reign, corresponding to Monday the 3rd Rabii' II., A.H. 1002 (17th December 1593).\n\nThe next was Shaykh Abu R\u0101shid. He was born on the 5th of Bahman M\u0101h i Il\u0101hi (January), the 23rd year of the reign corresponding with Monday, 1st of Jum\u0101da I of the same year (12th January 1594).\n\nAlthough these (last) two scions of the house of prosperity are of concubines, they bear on their countenances the marks of good breeding. That illustrious sage when informed of their coming birth, fixed the names they were to bear. Before they were born he died. I hope that through his inestimable prayers, fortune may wait on happiness and that they may become the recipients of numerous favours.\n\nAlthough my elder brother is dead and has thrown the world into mourning, I pray that the other nurslings of joy may attain to long life in glad prosperity and the fruition both of this world and the next and be blessed with good things temporal and spiritual.\n\nThe twenty-fifth, my marriage into an honourable house and a family distinguished for learning and the respect in which it was held. This gave my outward person credit and was as a leading rein to my unruly spirit; Hindu, Kashmiri and Persian wives were occasions of great joy to me.\n\nThe twenty-sixth, the blessing of a dear and virtuous son. He was born on the night of the 18th of Day M\u0101h (December) in the 16th year of the reign, corresponding to Monday night, the 12th Shab\u0101n 979 (29th December 1571). My father named him Abdu'r Rahm\u0101n. Although he is of Hindustani extraction, he has the Greek temperament and is fond of study, has much experience of the good and evil\nof life, and his countenance displays the marks of a happy fortune. His Majesty has allied him in marriage with his foster family.\\footnote{Akbar married him to the daughter of Sa\u0101dat Y\u0101r Kokah's brother. Blochmann, Vol. I. xxxv.}\n\n[P. 282] The twenty-seventh, the sight of a grandson. On the night of the 30th of the month of Amurd\u0101d M\u0101h i Il\u0101hi in the 30th year of the reign corresponding with Friday, 3rd Zi'l Qaadah 999 (13th August 1591), in an auspicious moment, this child of happy destiny appeared and the favour of God became manifest. His Majesty gave this sapling in the garden of felicity the name of Bishutan. It is my hope that he may be blessed with the highest perfections of nature and grace and attain to the fruition of eternal bliss.\n\nThe twenty-eighth, a love for the study of moral treatises.\n\nThe twenty-ninth, the knowledge of the rational soul. For many years I had studied the principles of ontology and physics and had conversed much with the professors of these two sciences and all the proofs by indagation and evidence, inductive and ocular, had come under my observation. Still the path of doubt remained unclosed and my mind was not satisfied. By the blessing of faith this difficulty was solved and I became convinced that the rational soul is a subtile divine essence separate from the body, having, however, a peculiar union with this elemental form.\n\nThe thirtieth, that from high principle, the awe of the great in place has never withheld me from speaking the truth nor interfered with my pursuit of knowledge and light, nor the fear of ruin to property, life and reputation made me falter in this resolution; thus my course has run on like a flowing stream.\n\nThe thirty-first, indifference to wordly considerations.\n\nThe thirty-second, the grace to complete this work. Although the motive of this divine book is the praise of God which I have proclaimed with a tongue under the spell of\na daily increasing felicity and gratitude for His favours expressed by the language of my pen, nevertheless it is the fountain head of various knowledge and a mine of wisdom to many. To industrious workers it is a guide, and the triflers and gay will find their portion therein. To youth it will be a source of pleasure, to manhood a cause of pride. The stricken in years will there find the experience of ages, and those who lavish the silver and the gold of this world will therein recognise the ordinances of manly fortitude. To the jewel of perspicacity it is a glad weighing-place; to the grasses of freedom, a fertile soil. It is the wicket of the laboratory of skill for the morn of felicity, the deep sea of creation's gem. The favored who seek for fame will in it find the road thereto, and the godly who pursue truth will rejoice in the custody of the volume of their deeds. Merchants of every kind of ware will learn the ways of profit, and champions in the arena of valour will read therein the tablets of heroism. Those who mortify the flesh for the edification of the spirit will take therefrom the institutes of virtue, and the blessed and sincere of heart will gather thence treasures without end, while those who repose in the pleasant vales of truth will by its means attain to their desire.\n\nA wondrous work herein behold\nThat wisdom's treasures all enfold;\nSo fair upon its page they show\nThat he who reads shall wiser grow.\n\nThese various benefits announce the good tidings which my heart hears in gladness that the conclusion of my task will make for goodness and avail me unto everlasting bliss.\n\n[Abul Fazl was both hated and admired.] [P. 283]\n\nAlthough the son of Mub\u0101rak is at the present time the object of resentment and held up as a warning to mankind, and a strife of love and hate is kindled in his regard, the worshippers of God who seek truth give him the name\nof Abu'l Wahdat, and account him a unique servant of the Supreme Giver. The valourous in the field of bravery style him Abu'l Himmat and deem him one of the wonders of carnal self-denial. Wisdom proclaims him Abul-Fitrat, and considers him a choice specimen of that sublime house. In the writings of the vulgar herd which are noisy dens of ignorance, some attribute wordliness to him and hold him to be one of those plunged into this whirlpool, while others regard him as given up to scepticism and apostacy, and band together in reproof and condemnation.\n\nOf me a hundred fictions rumoured fly,\nAnd the world stares if I a word reply.\n\nGod be praised that I am not moved from these honourable dispositions by watching the strange vicissitudes of life, nor turn from well-wishing both to those who blame and those who commend, and defile not my tongue with reproof or praise.\n\nThe dullard's eye to sterling merit dim,\nTrue ring of minted gold tells nought to him.\nWorth must from noble souls unhidden blaze,\nAs from the moon her light, from Jupiter his rays.\n\n---\n\n25 The Father of Unity, i.e., professing the unity of God, instead of Abu'l Fazl, the father of bounty. Abu'l Himmat signifies the father of resolution, and Abu'l Fitrat, the father of understanding.\nINDEX\n\nAbb\u0101d\u0101n, 75.\nAbdul Quddas (Shaikh), 417.\nAbdullah Kh., 384.\nAbdul Wahh\u0101b al Bokh\u0101ri, Shaikh, 417.\nAbdur Razz\u0101q, 417.\nAbr\u016bq, Brusa, 109.\nAbu Rashid, Shaikh, 521.\nAbu Tij, Nile in the Usyut territory, 80.\nAbu Tur\u0101b, Shaikh, 520.\nAbal Barkat, Shaikh, 520.\nAbul Fazl, his ancestors, 480-81;

The New Series was begun in 1860 and is still running.\n\nThe issues in the series consisted originally of fascicles of 96 or 100 pages in print, though occasionally numbers were issued of double, triple or larger bulk, and in a few cases even entire works were published under a single issue number. Of late years the single issues have been made, as much as possible, to constitute complete volumes. Several different works are always simultaneously in progress. Each issue bears a consecutive issue number. The Old Series consists of 265 issues; in the New Series 1556 issues have been published till December, 1st, 1947.
